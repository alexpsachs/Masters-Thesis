    "photonstorm": "Fixed in 0.9.3. Groups cannot (or rather, should not) manage anything that doesn't extend Basic at some point. Although technically from a JS point of view you could give it any object so long as it had the same properties as Basic does (not from a TS point though)\n. This should now be fixed in 0.9.3. When you add an animation I set currentFrame to point to the first frame of it.\n. Not on iOS :)\n. Do you mean being able to build your game using requireJS/etc, or moving the framework to use modules?\n. As it stands now none of the Phaser classes are independent (by design choice), but I could see a need for that once I introduce plugin support. As long as you can actually make a game using AMD your end and it's not blocking you in any way, then I'm happy with that. If someone wants to contribute additional grunt tasks/etc to make workflow easier for you then please do so.\n. This is now resolved in 0.9.4 thanks to HackManiac's updated grunt file.\n. Well spotted. This is fixed in 0.9.4.\n. This is now in 0.9.5, will do well until new sound manager goes in.\n. Agreed, good idea. Have made World._cameras public at World.cameras and Game.camera is now a getter for World.cameras.current - this is now in 0.9.4\n. What do you need to do that can't be done via Stage.canvas.style ?\n. myGame.stage.canvas.id = 'bob';\nAlso the canvas is injected into the given div, which can have any external CSS you want applied to it.\n. renderPoint is mostly used internally (re: parameter order) but I agree it makes sense to change it, so I have done. Fixed and updated in 0.9.5 :)\n. Thanks, I've merged this into 0.9.5 so it will be present in that release.\n. Actually this was a bug in 0.9.4, sorry. I have fixed it and given it a massive overhaul in 0.9.5 (which is on git if you want to check the repo out, but I'll make it live very soon, maybe even today).\nI've changed the way collision with tiles works a lot internally. It's a lot faster now, gives back much more useful data and I've made several examples in the test suite. Tiles can now be flagged to either separate objects or not, which is useful for different sorts of things - i.e. a \"speed boost\" tile in a racing game would be set to overlap but not collide with the object.\n. This has been fully merged with the 096 branch.\n. This has been fully merged with the 096 branch.\n. This sounds like it could be specific to the way you've implemented it - as there is a test case example of colliding with a tile that works fine from any side. Could you post it up to the forum for me with source so I can take a look for you? (or email it to me if you'd rather not post it).\n. Ok thanks - that's actually really useful to know (and doesn't surprise\nme). I'll address this when I implement the CollisionMask to the sprite\nobjects.\nCheers,\nRich\nPhoton Storm Ltd.\nhttp://www.photonstorm.com\nSkype: richard.davey\nTwitter / app.net: @photonstorm\nRegistered in England and Wales.\nCompany ID: 8036404\nVAT Number: 136 4333 27\nOn 14 May 2013 22:04, arnieforte notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHi,\nI did some additional testing and found that the texture atlas animation\nis causing the issue.

Closing this as it relates to the old 0.95 release of Phaser and is fixed in 1.0 (feel free to re-open if you find otherwise! but collision in 1.0 is totally different now).\n. Fixed in 0.9.6\n. This has been added to 0.9.6. At the moment it calls the destroy method and then carries on setting up the new state instantly. In future it should probably be expanded so that the destroy method controls when the set-up process carries on (i.e. if you wanted to do some kind of transition out of a state that took time).\n. It does.\n. I would set the InputManager to be resetLocked. Then it won't get cleared on a State change. It's up to you to manually manage the Input Handler as a result though.. I would set the InputManager to be resetLocked. Then it won't get cleared on a State change. It's up to you to manually manage the Input Handler as a result though.. States are allowed to have a public game property because they are never used WITHIN the Game framework, i.e. they are not objects that belong to Phaser. They are a list of short-cuts and proxy methods to make coding (on the game side) less verbose, I guess think of them as being stripped down versions of Phaser.Game.\n\nState could technically use a getter to _game instead, but it doesn't help consistency because it's still exposed as a public game property.\nEvery other class uses a private _game.\n. I'll add in a reference to State.ts from Game.ts to help the compiler, but there's no actual benefit of having a state property in Game that I can think of. It makes it massively complicated and verbose from a JavaScript point of view the moment you involve interfaces, so I'm not doing that.\nA state is just a bag of functions, it doesn't matter what object they reside within. It's actually a lot more flexible this way than forcing you to have to extend a State class, to the point where you can even have mini state processors for tiny specific tasks.\n. In Flixel everything was still bound to a single instance of a state. You could reference it through FlxG, but it was still all lost on state swap. You also couldn't access any properties of the state that weren't part of the FlxState class. For example if you had MyState extends FlxState with a property \"player\", you can't see that via FlxG.state.player at all, not without casting is back to MyState again, which was always clunky. It's the reason for the popularity of a Registry class (or some other kind of global property accessor), a conduit between game objects.\nYou can use exactly the same approach in Phaser/TypeScript. A Global object that contains references to all the important stuff, accessed from anywhere, without the issues of being explicitly state bound.\nThe reason I didn't use an Interface btw is because there are only 2 required things for a State: a reference to game and either an init or a create function, everything else is optional. An interface that tiny seems pointless imho.\n. btw I will add in Game.state as a reference to whatever state you give it, but it's going to be of limited use from TS (probably a lot more useful via JS where it won't check the type!)\n. This has been added to version 0.9.6. Have tested XML exports from Shoebox in this format and both normal sprite sheets and animations worked ok.\n. This was fixed in 0.9.6 (currently in the 096 branch)\n. This has been added in the 1.0 release. You can access it via sprite.events.onAnimationComplete\n. This is fixed in the 1.1 release (maybe even before, this is kinda an old issue :)\n. Shortly, yes.\n. Spaces are valid URL characters (when encoded to %20) so I won't be removing them, sorry. Going to close this issue now as lots of alternative web server methods were added to the docs / guides.\n. This is now fixed in the 1.1 release.\n. Could you re-test this against 1.1 final please.\n. \"webpages while offline.\"\nYou'll still need a local web server to serve the html pages or none of the examples will work, so it won't make any difference regarding \"offline\" (technically the php version can be run \"offline\" as well). What it will do is allow you to use a local web server that doesn't have php available.\nooflorent - you know what's in store for the examples already after our discussion the other day, so I'll let you know once the new template is ready. I'll also forward all support requests your way asking why when they open an example in their browser it doesn't run ;)\n. Yes, but there's no way in hell I'm advocating someone does that in a Beginners guide!\nBesides if they don't understand the need to launch an html page via a web server there's slim to no chance of them understanding how to add a command-line parameter when starting Chrome either.\n. I would like to offer a non-php version of the 2 build scripts if possible.\n. Ok this should no longer be an issue in the current version (1.1), but please do test and feel free to re-open with a sample case if you can still see it happening.\n. Hi - Thank you for doing this, however we were quite deep into applying jsdoc3 blocks to the dev branch and generating that (using DocStrap rather than YUI in the end) and we're very nearly finished now. So again, thank you for the time spent doing this, but hopefully what we've got now and will release shortly will be just as useful.\n. I've redone the Camera/World system and BitmapText (and normal Text) works fine with any x/y placement now.\n. You'd still do it like that, I've just not finished the physics updates in dev yet so it's conflicting. To get around it just do sprite.body.allowRotation = false and it will stop cancelling the update, or use sprite.body.rotation instead (either will work but note that body.rotation is in degrees not radians, as it works off sprite.angle and not sprite.rotation).\n. Yeah I've not looked at this yet. It's a bit of a strange one tbh, but will do so before release.\n. Traditionally you're supposed to set up and rip down quadtrees as you need them (even many times per frame), or once a frame at the most. I guess they could be used more long-term though, it's something I was exploring with the tilemaps, it's just they are very expensive to modify. You could remove an object but if you do it in a dirty fashion you'll leave an incorrectly divided quad (especially if you delete multiple items) - and if you recalculate the whole tree on removal to keep it clean then you may as well just rebuild it anyway :)\n. I don't use grunt, so docstrap is in there to keep everything I need in one single place.\nAnd of course we need to include the generated docs, just like Three.JS does and most other libraries I use. The whole point of docs is to avoid people having to pour through all the source code and hope they didn't miss anything, not to force them to do so.\n. I have to think \"end user\" though. I want them to download the zip (which a LOT do!) or pull the repo and that's it, they can just open an index file and be off. The more barriers I put in their way, the more of them drop off and never make it far enough to experience what they could do.\nre: Three.JS I just did a quick df on it and it appears you can blame 99% of the repo size to the assets the examples use! The actual code and docs are tiny by comparison.\nFor me I think that the API docs will remain part of the repo, because they're not going to change that often once they've been written. Things like long form tutorials can definitely go elsewhere though. For the same reason I think splitting out plugins will make sense too. In my mind the core lib should hit a happy stable point and then not really change much (we're just a way off from that so far), but the plugins will grow and grow and the docs for those specifically will too, so I probably ought to separate them.\n. Game.destroy has now been updated so that it closes down RAF and all the input managers, which should hopefully stop the above from happening.\n. Fixed in dev. Will upload to the web site when we go live with the 1.1 release.\n. Sprite.crop has been totally rewritten for the 1.1 release. It now caches values to avoid constant Texture refreshes and can be enabled and disabled via Sprite.cropEnabled = true/false. You can now do sprite.crop.width += 1 for example quite happily.\n. Can you give me some specific browser version / OS combinations it doesn't work on please.\n. Ok I have updated Loader to use responseText in the case of text, csv, json and xml files. Audio still uses xhr.response, but then it only does that on devices that support Web Audio anyway, in which case they will support xhr.response too.\n. Once they are finished, yes. For now they're in the dev branch only, as soon as this shifts to master they will be available prebuilt and online.\n. Be wary - there are some unstable or missing things in there at the moment (basically anything involving a tilemap), and it's changing daily, but other than that feel free to have a play :)\n. It's open source for a reason ;)\n. Have included a new phaser.d.ts TypeScript definitions file in the dev branch. Thanks for the heads-up on jsdocts, it helped loads :)\n. These issues should be fully resolved in the 1.1 version (currently in the dev branch but tomorrow will be made master), so I would urge you to upgrade and please re-test your code. Of course open a new issue if you find something wrong.\n. Any news on this? Want to get this fixed for 1.1 final for you, but am releasing tomorrow. If not can wait for the next version :)\n. Just to say that I managed to write a test case for this and fix the issue. You can now destroy objects even while being dragged and it's quite happy about it :)\n. Probably not :) But I am going to integrate a chat system into the HTML5 Game Devs forum, so we can talk there instead!\n. Honestly I just don't have the time or inclination to set one up. That doesn't mean someone else can't though.\n. Ok the new examples / build system is up on dev branch. Closing this off.\n. Just to say that I'd still really like this in Phaser, but didn't want to merge with 1.1 without testing first.\n. Yeah the WebGL detection was broken. Now fixed :)\n. Works flawlessly, thank you :) The only thing I'll need to do is resolve the version number if you include the js files directly (rather than the using a phaser.js file) otherwise the console output just shows <%= version %>\nBut on the whole this is great for those who like their Grunt. I'll fix the php version now so it pulls the version from the correct place.\n. Spoke too soon - works ALMOST flawlessly, but for some reason running a default build nukes the examples.json file totally (nothing gets written to it).\n. Just tried it again with the same results. I'm on Windows 8.1. Grunt reports no errors and everything else builds fine, but examples.json is an empty file with just {} in it. I wonder if the path you're using might be an issue? The examples/*/.js one. It appears it's not finding any js files to insert, hence the empty output.\n. I think the short answer is simply: ease-of-use.\nPlus it's the only way to guarantee version control, i.e. I know for a fact that the version of Pixi bundled with Phaser actually works. If someone isn't used to using a package manager (and let's remember I'm aiming at game devs, not web devs) they would have to assemble the build themselves by pulling from the pixi repo, which may be out of sync with a version Phaser supports.\nI'd be happy to support an additional (optional) build flag that compiled just Phaser without Pixi.\n. It's great in theory. Just not willing to make an external dependency like that right now (also not seeing any significant benefits tbh)\n. Ok. I've modified Input.onUp and onDown so they dispatch the original event as well as the pointer object:\n```\ngame.input.onUp.add(doSomething, this);\nfunction doSomething(pointer, event) {\n...\n}\n```\n. I get:\n```\nCommand-line options: --verbose\nReading \"Gruntfile.js\" Gruntfile...OK\nRegistering Gruntfile tasks.\nRegistering \"grunt-contrib-clean\" local Npm module tasks.\nReading D:\\wamp\\www\\phaser\\node_modules\\grunt-contrib-clean\\package.json...OK\nParsing D:\\wamp\\www\\phaser\\node_modules\\grunt-contrib-clean\\package.json...OK\nLoading \"clean.js\" tasks...OK\n+ clean\nRegistering \"grunt-contrib-concat\" local Npm module tasks.\nReading D:\\wamp\\www\\phaser\\node_modules\\grunt-contrib-concat\\package.json...OK\nParsing D:\\wamp\\www\\phaser\\node_modules\\grunt-contrib-concat\\package.json...OK\nLoading \"concat.js\" tasks...OK\n+ concat\nRegistering \"grunt-contrib-connect\" local Npm module tasks.\nReading D:\\wamp\\www\\phaser\\node_modules\\grunt-contrib-connect\\package.json...OK\nParsing D:\\wamp\\www\\phaser\\node_modules\\grunt-contrib-connect\\package.json...OK\nLoading \"connect.js\" tasks...OK\n+ connect\nRegistering \"grunt-contrib-copy\" local Npm module tasks.\nReading D:\\wamp\\www\\phaser\\node_modules\\grunt-contrib-copy\\package.json...OK\nParsing D:\\wamp\\www\\phaser\\node_modules\\grunt-contrib-copy\\package.json...OK\nLoading \"copy.js\" tasks...OK\n+ copy\nRegistering \"grunt-contrib-uglify\" local Npm module tasks.\nReading D:\\wamp\\www\\phaser\\node_modules\\grunt-contrib-uglify\\package.json...OK\nParsing D:\\wamp\\www\\phaser\\node_modules\\grunt-contrib-uglify\\package.json...OK\nLoading \"uglify.js\" tasks...OK\n+ uglify\nRegistering \"./tasks\" tasks.\nLoading \"examples.js\" tasks...OK\n+ examples\nLoading \"umd.js\" tasks...OK\n+ umd\nReading package.json...OK\nParsing package.json...OK\nInitializing config...OK\nLoading \"Gruntfile.js\" tasks...OK\n+ build, default\nRunning tasks: examples\nRunning \"examples\" task\nRunning \"examples:all\" (examples) task\nVerifying property examples.all exists in config...OK\nFiles: examples/_site/js/jquery-2.0.3.min.js, examples/_site/js/phaser-examples.\njs, examples/_site/js/phaser-sideview.js, examples/_site/js/phaser-viewer.js, ex\namples/_site/js/prettify.js, examples/_site/js/purl.js, examples/_site/js/run_pr\nettify.js, examples/animation/change texture on click.js, examples/animation/loc\nal json object.js, examples/animation/looped animation.js, examples/animation/mu\nltiple anims.js, examples/animation/sprite sheet.js, examples/animation/texture\npacker json hash.js, examples/audio/loop.js, examples/audio/pause and resume.js,\n examples/audio/play music.js, examples/basics/01 -

Perfect :) Is there any way to have the \"basics\" and \"games\" folders appear at the top of the file? (that is what the php version did), as I want people to look in those first. The rest can flow alphabetically.\n. Nice, that'll do it.\n. Could you please test the most recently pushed dev branch first? It's just that I've spent a long time tonight sorting this all out and I believe it's working fine now, but would love for you to test it to confirm.\n. Wow, thank you! That must have taken you ages :-/\n. Hey @TomTom1229 - do you have any ideas about this? http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/1822-difficulty-with-typescript-in-11/\n. You're right, will look at that later. Used to work fine, so probably something really small :)\n. Have dug into this a bit more and will get a patch rolled out early next week.\n. Just to say that I've been looking in to this and it's quite a bit more complex than I thought. It's actually nothing to do with tilemaps themselves, but actually how fixedToCamera sprites work (and also sprites that follow the camera), that causes their bodies to go out of sync. Still digging...\n. I actually made a lot of progress on this last night and the current implementation seems to be working great. Certainly fixed the tilemap demos I had previously and all the collision tests still work too. Please grab the latest dev branch release and test for yourselves.\n. Can you issue this against the dev branch please. I have made it fully up to date with master this morning.\n. Don't worry, I've manually merged this with the dev branch and it'll be part of the 1.1.1 release.\n. When an object extends an existing prototype (such as with Sprite or any other game object) you have to use the method I currently use, otherwise it overwrites the prototype. When I'm defining the prototype fully (as in StateManager and most other classes I use the more concise approach. I could use the longer form across them all but I prefer the readability of the shorter one and would use it everywhere if possible.\n. Resolved in 1.1.1\n. Fixed in 1.1.2\n. Fixed in 1.1.2\n. Thanks for this - happy to merge but could you issue against the dev branch please.\n. Eventually yes, but there are far more important things to be doing at the moment.\n. Ok I've tweaked the configuration in the JSHint file and re-pushed it, also have started going through the source applying my own rules :)\n. This has been added to 1.1.2\n. How strange, there are considerably more js files than there are css.\nI just did a count and there are 45 css files across the whole project, but 1,024 js files.\nSo not even close to 45% css.\n. Ahh it must be done on line-count rather than source files.\nOk, I'll move the un-used docstrap css :)\n. Done (on dev at least, will move to master when 1.1.2 goes live)\n. Yes it will happen while the preload is running. If you don't have a preload function then 'create' will always get called once before the render pass. Typically I'd inject the game into a container div that had the right background colour set on it, but if for whatever reason that's not possible then setting the colour in preload itself would be my next choice.\n. I just don't see it happen here, sorry. By default it sets a black canvas background, non-transparent. If you change the stage bg color it updates the css background property on the canvas object, so as long as this repaint happens before the canvas is rendered once it shouldn't flash black at all.\nI did just update it however to do something I've been meaning to do for a while: you can now pass in CSS rgba style values for the background color. This only works in Canvas games as Pixis implementation of WebGL background colors don't support alpha, but for Canvas games it seems to work great.\n. As soon as a State is added to a Phaser Game it is automatically given a game property (along with 14 others) which is populated with a reference to the current game. I guess it's possible you could nuke the property accidentally, but otherwise it would always be present from any of the callbacks without needing to be specifically fed a new reference.\nIncidentally it's impossible to embed 2 Phaser games on the same page. I had this feature in right from the start, but Pixi doesn't support multiple instances of itself :( so I removed it for now. Will re-implement if Pixi ever decides to change that fact.\n. I can see the benefit of avoiding using the global game var, but in a true State object (like that found in the Basic Project Template) you don't need to use \"this.game.load\" for a preloader, you just use \"this.load\" as \"load\" is already pre-mapped to the current games Loader instance.\nUnder your approach it would mean you could do \"game.load\" instead of (or as well as) \"this.load\" - which is no bad thing I guess, it's the same amount of typing anyway :)\nI guess it won't hurt to merge this request, at least it doesn't impact on the way it currently works, just provides a little nicety to those who don't use State objects.\n. To give you a better ETA on this we'll be releasing 1.1.2 on Friday (November 1st) which has fixed the tilemap collision issues and put those demos back into action again.\n. Because it was mostly fixed in 1.1.3, but I since found another issue with it (literally yesterday) where it would still break if the world was smaller than the game camera, but that is now fixed in 1.1.4 dev too.\n. I'm still in two minds about if this should be addressed or not. The issue is that I attach the mouse event listeners to the canvas, not the document body. If it was on the body it'd be far easier to detect this. I'm not a fan of html5 games overstepping their bounds, i.e. attaching to dom elements that don't belong to them, but at the same time it would help solve various issues. I guess all it would need are mouseup/down listeners on the body that simply have to check if the action put the mouse handler into an un-detected state.\nI guess it just stems back to me wanting to keep the design of Phaser clean, in the sense that it doesn't create global objects or listeners, or modify expected behaviour. Then again, I'd like to see this issue resolved too.\n. Right, this should be fixed in 1.1.3 now.\n. I'm closing this pull request because the feature has been added to the recent Button updates and upFrame is now used correctly, and is required.\n. This has been manually merged due to other changes in this file tonight.\n. I don't mind you adding querySelector but it will absolutely have to support the current method as well (i.e. either specifying no dom element at all, or providing a specific ID) as those are by far the most common methods of embedding games.\nI'm trying to think of a real world use-case where querySelector would be required - do you have one?\n. Still sounds a bit like personal preference over actual requirement to me, I would have thought the fact that there should only ever be a single instance of a game container in the page makes it a good candidate for an ID rather than an abuse of them (i.e. as opposed to using them for presentation) - but like I said I'm happy with this addition so long as it /extends/ what is currently there, and doesn't replace it.\n. Could it not be done by passing in the element itself? So if you pass in a string it will assume it's an ID and use the current method, but if you pass in an actual DOM element it will (try its best) to use that instead. Then it's up to you how you like to select that dom element in the first place.\n. This has been added to 1.1.3.\n. Could you please do PRs against the dev branch, not master. However you don't need to worry for this one as I've fixed it manually, but just in future, thanks :)\n. Merged manually.\n. We've already got a license file in the root of the repo and I'm not comfortable not mentioning anywhere in the readme what license we use, so I've gone for a merged approach, i.e. single-line license at the bottom linking to the full file. You can see this in the dev branch I just pushed.\n. Yeah I agree the list of changes was getting very long, mostly because 1.1 was such a massive update. I can't merge your PR because the readme was too out of date, but have manually made the changes anyway.\n. Explain? (ideally via a code sample)\n. Because Sprite.animations.updateIfVisible is true by default.\n. Actually hang on, if you switched tabs the game should have paused. I just tested it and if you click away from the browser, the game pauses and when you return the animation carries on correctly. But if you swap to another tab quickly it doesn't pause, so something must have changed in the visibility checks because that used to work fine.\n. Took a while, sorry, but this is now fixed in 1.2.\n. Yes, but you can still achieve the same overall result as before via the new methods.\n. Fixed in 1.1.3\n. In 1.1.4:\nGroup.destroy has a new parameter: destroyChildren (boolean) which will optionally call the destroy method of all Group children.\n. Done in dev.\n. Fixed in 1.1.3.\n. Fixed in 1.1.3.\n. Fixed in 1.1.3.\n. Fixed in 1.1.3.\n. Yes, we use an automated script to create the typescript defs file and obviously it doesn't work properly. Rather than fix them all by hand I'm tempted to just create a new script that will convert to a t.ds properly. Unless you've already been fixing this in a local version?\n. I'd rather have a correct but maybe out-of-date defs file than a totally wrong all over the place one!\nSo yes, please fork + send a PR.\n. Added and tidied up Graphics a bit more.\n. Very nice! I'll gladly merge these but you need to submit them against the dev branch please.\n. I noticed this the other day too. Damn annoying, will look into it next week.\n. This is fixed in 1.1.4 dev.\n. This is fixed in 1.1.4 dev.\n. Yeah I sort of agree (which is why this isn't merged yet) but I just need to find the right home for it all.\n. Just to say that I'm closing this because I've added proper native Tiled objectgroup support in 1.1.4.\n. Just to say that I'm closing this because I've added proper native Tiled objectgroup support in 1.1.4.\n. Awesome, thank you :) Do you mind closing whichever issues this new d.ts file fixes? (the ones that you opened of course) :)\n. Fixed in 1.1.3.\n. Fixed in 1.1.3.\n. Yes, I've already done this locally so will close this PR.\n. The decoding delay is normal. However could you try this - see what the values are of:\ngame.device.mp3\ngame.device.ogg\ngame.device.opus\ngame.device.m4a\nTry this with and without that media.gstreamer flag enabled.\n. Ok neat, am adding this one to the docs!\n. I'm going to close this as Pixi is under-going a large internal re-write at the moment, and hopefully one of their community will generate a defs file for it when finished, at which point we'll merge it with ours.\n. True. Added.\n. I don't believe any such commit has been made yet. I'm tempted to not mess with this just yet, as Pixi is just about to drop the massive 1.5 update which changes loads internally. So I may well just wrap it all up when we update to that.\n. Yes I will start doing this as of the next release, although it's a portal to trouble as well because I build against very specific and patched versions of Pixi, and just upgrading them willy-nilly is going to cause problems in your games.\n. Closing this off because:\n- Brand new Grunt task - creates each core library as its own file and a combined phaser.js.\n- New build script now cleanly splits Phaser, Pixi and p2 so they are each UMD wrapped and each available in the global scope (now more requireJS friendly!).\n- phaser-no-libs.js allows you to use your own version of p2.js or pixi.js with Phaser. Warning: This is totally unsupported. If you hit bugs, you fix them yourself.\n. I think it's sound. Merged :)\n. I think it's sound. Merged :)\n. This is now fixed in 1.1.4.\n. I'm quite tempted to rewrite the BitmapText handler anyway, there are a few things I'd like to add (support for other formats being one), but until I do that hopefully they can merge your PR to fix - although I wouldn't hold my breath.\n.

Thank you for submitting this. I'm sorry it never got merged with the core Examples, but as you may know we redid the way tilemaps work to allow for proper layer support from Tiled, although this would have been a good work-around prior to that :-/\n. The thinking behind it was something like this:\n1) The Tilemap object is just a bucket of data. It has no rendering responsibilities at all, in fact it shouldn't even care what Layers actually exist. It's just the parsed map data and the functions you need to modify that map data. Hence if you putTile, the map data has been invalidated and is dirty.\n2) Think of a Layer as being a 'view' into the Tilemap data, rather than explicitly bound to rendering just one layer of the map. There's no reason why you couldn't create 6 different TilemapLayer objects, all rendering different parts of the same layer in the map data (hmm this is getting confusing quickly, but do you see what I mean? :) I guess a good example might be a split-screen game with 2 players on the same map.\n3) So really I think it needs 2 dirty flags. One to say the map data is invalidated, and one per layer object. The layer may not have scrolled at all, but could still be dirty if the map data had changed. Equally it could be dirty on its own just by scrolling. So yes, the layer should not reset the map dirty flag, but equally I'm not sure if the map should care about maintaining a list of layers either.\n.

I don't think the issue is anything to do with the name, but to do with the parent. That is what controls the layering of objects and the display list.\nI wonder if it might be this line in Group.js (in the constructor):\nif (typeof parent === 'undefined' || typeof parent === null)\nIt should probably be:\nif (typeof parent === 'undefined' || parent === null)\nAs if you pass in null for the parent the second check will fail and the parent will be set to the game.world.\nTry modifying that and see what happens.\n.

Thought so. Have pushed up the fix but please don't just blindly grab the dev branch because I'm doing some intense refactoring across all the tilemap classes and they're all pretty broken right now :) Group on its own is fine though.\n.

Nice, thanks.\n. Nice, thanks.\n. I've tested this and it seems ok now (on latest dev branch) but feel free to re-open if it still doesn't work as expected.\n. If you run countLiving and get -1 back, it means the Group is empty. If you run it and get zero back, it just means there aren't any living children within it, so they are two very different outcomes.\nWhat needs fixing is Group.total and Group.length - currently they return the same value, but length is the one that should return 0 if the Group is empty.\n.

The original was generated but the generator is so unreliable we just edit it by hand now.\n. I'll merge this in for now, but it's likely to all change with the new State handler anyway (but we can keep the actual flow the same). Also I'm going to be removing the world quadtree phase and making quadtrees created dynamically on call to collide, as they're not working as well as I want them to right now.\n.

What font are you using? Does it have a space character defined in the XML? :)\n. Hmm I don't get this in Firefox, could you let me know which version it is please? Am going to edit the source so it skips zero sized characters.\n. Thanks, when we move to Pixi 1.5 this will be addressed automatically. In the meantime please edit the XML files to ensure no zero values are present.\n. To be fair it's because you're in the dev branch, where anything goes at the moment really. Edit it back to what you need it to show, because I need it to work like this for the time being until tilemaps are bedded down (when I'll restore it).\n. The way BitmapText works is to create a DisplayObjectContainer and then 1 Sprite per letter. So the container as a whole can't have renderable set on it, but each letter could. BitmapText is being redone for the next release after 1.1.4 so we'll add some methods in then to make this process easier. In the meantime I'll remove the renderable property from the class as it's not meant to be on there.\n. I think this is a duplicate issue? As you solved and closed the other one. But feel free to re-open if not.\n. Have you got a non-scaling viewport set in your html? As the browser will just scale it regardless if not.\n. I'm not happy with how camera follow works with tilemaps. Right now it can be EITHER following a sprite, and then you cannot scroll the tilemap yourself, or you can scroll the tilemap and have the camera break. Equally if the camera is smaller than the game world then scrolling the map breaks as well (collision gets offset by the difference between the camera and game size).\nWhat I need and am aiming for, is for you to be able to scroll the tilemap and follow a sprite as two unique things that could happen together if needed. Also right now I'm struggling with the ability to locate a tilemap anywhere in the game world. It renders just fine, but then obviously all of the world items are offset incorrectly against the collision. I'm not sure there is a way to resolve this one though, but it's frustrating me :)\n. What I want is for the camera to be able to automatically scroll, like on a fixed-path, and for the player to be moving around within that. Have a look at this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=qxciUa4YmeY#t=278 that sort of effect. Right now if the camera scrolled, the player would scroll off the left with it too. I guess in that example the sprite is 'fixed' to the camera, but that would of course break all collision currently.\n. It's only broken in dev, which no-one should be using for LD!\n. Closing as this is properly fixed in 1.2 (and 1.1.5 for that matter).\n. While this will work I'd just like to add that the Sprites body will be set to the same size as the source image. I have however just pushed up a new 1.1.4 build which fixes it properly, to a degree (if you rotate or scale the tilesprite, the bounds don't update correctly yet).\n. Already fixed in dev, please search gh issues for options.\n. Nope, they don't work that way. I've redone tiles and have removed this to avoid confusion, and added a callback so it can still be done in game code.\n. Closing this as it relates to 1.1.3 and has all changed in 1.1.4 - feel free to reopen if you find it doesn't work as expected when testing 1.1.4.\n. Is the TileSprite definitely using a power of 2 texture?\n. This should now be fixed in the dev branch, but please re-open if you don't see the desired results.\n. jsperf: On Chrome 31 (Windows 7), branch zeroes is by far the fastest. On iPhone 5S Mobile Safari I get the same result (180m ops, which to me seems like it may have just inlined the result somehow rather than actually calculating it every time?)\n. Yes updateBounds is a bit of a monster, 5 local position transforms, 2 min/max calls and possibly a couple of intersection tests too. It could be optimised, although I think everything that it actually does is required - even so, some thoughts I've had:\n- Add fixedRotation and fixedScale properties to Sprites. If set it can avoid a lot of costly transforms.\n- I'm pretty sure we can get away with calculating just the topLeft and bottomRight positions, and derive center, topRight and bottomLeft based on those 2 alone.\n- Possibly look at only invalidating the cache on integer changes rather than floats.\n. Update: the topLeft/bottomRight thing will only work if we get rid of those points as public properties and use them purely as a means to calculate the bounds. I wasn't sure if anyone actually used them for something else, custom collision maybe?\n. Yes, it's actually the transformed point - so could potentially be really useful. Although like I said, I don't know anyone actually using it (but that doesn't mean they aren't!). Having said that, I DO use it for Input hit detection. Hmmm.\nIn earlier versions I had a game object type called a 'Bullet'  - it was meant to be used for high-volume, low-feature objects. So a Sprite but without rotation, scale or input events. If it doesn't need input events (or rotation for that matter) then it could definitely use your simplified updateBody function as well.\n. Yeah the onStart was being called when the tween was created, not when it started actually tweening :)\nI have fixed this in the dev branch and created a new example showing how to use the events.\nhttps://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/commit/f991f9cee86696c7ac0599abeea729ac03ff96c3\n. That fix was applied almost 1.5 years ago, and worked at the time. Since then a lot has changed, so this should be opened as a new issue rather than resurrecting a very old one.\n. Nope. But there's no reason why you can't put those keys and paths into an array, then just iterate through it calling game.load.image on each element.\n. Yes that's right - you don't have to create a new Loader object each time though, you can just use the one that is already created: this.game.load - could be called anywhere in your game really.\n. Also every State can have its own preload function too, which is how I tend to part-load content. If you look in the repository in resources/Project Templates/Basic you'll see that Boot.js loads a few assets and then Preloader.js loads more.\n. This is now fixed in the dev branch. Please test and see what you think.\n. If the Sprite is fixed you should be adjusting cameraOffset.x/y and not Sprite.x/y (as they'll be ignored). I'll check the Sprite bounds though.\n. If the Sprite is fixed you should be adjusting cameraOffset.x/y and not Sprite.x/y (as they'll be ignored). I'll check the Sprite bounds though.\n. Ok InputHandler has been updated so both checkBoundsRect and checkBoundsSprite test if the sprite is fixed to the camera, and adjust the cameraOffset.x/y values instead of sprite.x/y. Please note that checkBoundsSprite will only work if BOTH sprites are fixed to the camera (or not), otherwise they would be comparing values in different coordinate spaces and would have gone wrong.\n. No it's not, sorry. For now the Arcade Physics classes are limited to Body operations only. For what you need I would suggest either waiting for us to implement Advanced Physics, by way of p2.js, in the next release - or look at maybe using Box2D.\n. Hi - could you submit this against the dev branch please (we never merge into master).

Without looking I suspect it pulls it from the base texture, so unless that is destroyed it allows it to render. If the sprite is killed you shouldn't be able to render it to a RenderTexture, I'm happy with that outcome, just not with the fact WebGL doesn't check it carefully. Will root around in the pixi source to find out why.\n. @MiltonW probably just something different in the way pixi handles it internally.

Feel free to re-open this if you believe it's still happening in 1.2.\n. Yeah the way we used to set the bgc (via canvas css property) failed in that instance.

I will be curious to see if this issue persists when we swap over to the new 1.5 branch of Pixi in the next release.\n. Well at least it will work eventually I guess?! :)\n. Thanks for this! I have manually merged your additions to the Device class. I'm not going to for Stage or Canvas only because you can now emulate the same end result using the new Game configuration object and setting a canvasID property in it. Basically this is a configuration object that can be given to the Phaser.Game constructor instead of the parameters and lets you set a lot more settings, a lot deeper in Phaser, one of which is passing in an ID for the canvas to use.\n.

Yes we updated Pixi to the latest dev release for 1.1.3, so I'm worried something in there has changed (as we certainly didn't touch TileSprite between those two versions ourselves iirc).

Yes this was left over by mistake and shouldn't have been in there. The 'feature' is now removed for 1.2.\n. Phaser used to be written entirely in TypeScript and I'm never going through that process again. It was an utter nightmare when they upgrade to 0.9.5, so many things broke within tsc, and it become a complete mess. My frustrations with it are well documented on the forum! In fact it was them screwing up TS so badly in that iteration that forced me back to JavaScript and it was the best move I ever made. Adoption of Phaser is now fantastic as a result of devs being able to just edit the code, patch it and help out. Very few people ever did that when it was made in TypeScript.\n. I've just double-checked this and you can also get the values from pointer.position - as this is updated as the pointer moves, so will always hold the most recent value, even when it doesn't touch any more.\n. Yes true. I tried to make BitmapData a drop-in for the EaselJS version, but actually that is pointless - so I've cut BitmapData right back to bare bones in 1.2 and instead will provide a bridge so EaselJS can update a Phaser canvas easily.\n. Closing this off as it's no longer required for the 1.2 branch - thank you for submitting it though!\n. I don't suppose you still have the test.html file do you? I would like to try it under 1.2.\n. Please re-open this issue if you do.\n. This is now all working as expected in 1.2 :)\n. This is now fixed in the 1.2 branch.\n. It definitely runs as expected here, but I neglected to say I only tested against the dev branch, not master.\n. Thanks :)\n. Could you upload some code that shows it?\n. JSON could be stored in its own cache, but there's absolutely no technical difference in doing that to doing it how it's handled currently, so 'proper practice' doesn't apply here, it's more a case of 'what would a developer expect?'.\n. Thanks for the PR but I've manually fixed this example today to tidy it up a lot, it was a bit messy and not much use imho.\n. Agreed. I've removed the parameter for now.\n. Yes the callback is fired before the startPointer function, so it won't have worked out coordinates or anything by that point. I could move it after startPointer, but then if the touch or input is disabled it will never get fired at all, where-as I always imagined you'd use the callback as a way to do your own touch handling, i.e. you'd set a callback and then disable the Touch handler, so you can then do whatever you want with it. A bit of a catch 22 really.\n. Thanks, this has been manually merged into the dev branch.\n. Hi - thanks for this, but it's already been added to the readme in dev :)\n. I thought IE11 changed to be MSPointer only now? Pretty sure those mouse events don't even fire in it (which is why your callback doesn't either).. These are all now working fine (test case here: http://labs.phaser.io/view.php?f=010+fixed+to+camera.js) confirmed across multiple devices.\n. Indeed it does. It's a bug with a sprite in a group and the current body code. I'm trying to fix it literally right now. 1.1.4 won't ship like this, I promise :)\n. Agreed, so I've added it. For the record though the way it originally worked was that when the game was paused it would call State.paused(false) and when it resumed it called State.paused(true) - so you could handle it in your code. But it makes more sense to split it out.\n. I blame n-way collision - it was all fine until I added that! I'll look into this as a matter of urgency.\n.

Ok done. Documentation updated in 1.2.\n. Hiya - Thanks a lot for this :) I have manually merged it into the 1.2 branch. I have a few questions though and would like your thoughts please:\n1) The Phaser.Gestures.add method has been defined twice, which is the correct one?\n2) The Gestures hook into the Input.setMoveCallback, which is fine but it means devs can't use a move callback and a gesture in the same game. We need to find a different way to handle this imho.\n3) There are a number of inlined functions and object creation in core loops. I'd like to try and find a solution to avoid doing that where possible.\n4) I have renamed the class names, so it's Gesture.SwipeLeft for example (rather than Gestures). However I think we could merge most of the functionality of the Swipe classes together. Only the middle of the update functions appear to be different between them, so I'm sure we could cut down on code and keep the same features as currently.\n5) Is there any control over the tolerance of the swipe? I.e. how far the pointer has to have travelled before it's considered a 'swipe'? Or how fast it happened? A really slow motion for example probably ought to be ignored as an actual swipe and would be more of a drag :)\nHappy to help code out most of the above, just wanted to get your take on it first.\n. Closing off very old PRs. This feature needs adding, to a degree, but things have changed significantly since the original PR and there are better ways of doing it now.\n. Closing off very old PRs. This feature needs adding, to a degree, but things have changed significantly since the original PR and there are better ways of doing it now.\n. Your parameters are wrong (x, y, width, height, key, frame).\n. It was always checked in the preUpdate loop (comparing Sprite.bounds to game world via an intersects). Now I've just basically confirmed it works fine via a test case.\n. Doesn't set what? checkWorldBounds and _bounds are both set in the constructor and checked in preUpdate.\n_currentBounds, despite what it says above it in the code, doesn't seem to be checked on a pixi level at all.\n. But it's disabled by default as it's so expensive, no-where in the phaser source should it ever be set to true. If you want to check the bounds you need to enable it yourself from the game code.\n. getBounds is never actually called by Pixi, so _currentBounds won't be populated (or current!). iirc it's called just once by the webgl filter manager.\nA safer bounds to use would be the texture frame dimensions imho, but that won't take into account rotation or offsets from parents. There's really no easy way to do it. I guess we could add a flag similar to \"this Sprite never rotates, scales or inherits from a parent\" - if that was true then you'd only need to do a getBounds once and store the result. And I think in a lot of cases it would be ok too, like bullets in a shmup, or in the Invaders example game. Like a fixed rotation / ultra simple AABB.\n. Int8 won't be big enough (the first 2 elements = xy coordinates). 16 maybe.\n. Agreed. Done.\n. Done :)\n. Actually that URL is wrong too! Will update now.\n. Hah beat you to it, I literally fixed this a few commits ago :)\n. All fixedToCamera code is disabled / non-working at the moment. It's next on my list after the commit I'm doing atm.\n. All done and pushed.\n. This was a problem with how tile collisions were dealt with internally, and should have been fixed with the 1.1.6 release yesterday.\n. The flappy bird clone above pauses just fine for me on Chrome on desktop (tested on OS X and Windows). Regardless I have updated the way visibility detection is handled in the latest version which should be a bit more robust, but it still relies on the browser sending either a window.blur event  or supporting the page visibility api. If it does neither there is nothing I can do really :/\n. Thank you for taking the time to report this issue and I'm sorry that we didn't manage to resolve it.

Sound.play has been updated to use the following:\nif (typeof loop === 'undefined') { loop = this.loop; }\nHowever there's nothing wrong with the 'loop2' section in your 2nd comment unless you care to explain further (examples/audio/loop.js uses the loop2 pass as it's not a sound sprite and works fine here), so more details needed.\n. This is fixed in 1.2.\n. Thanks. Fixed for 1.1.6.\n. Thanks, I've added this into the dev version.\n. Thanks, I've manually merged this into 1.2. I'm not going to merge as-is with master as there are some dev changes waiting to go across first, but to be honest I think the 1.2 release might beat them both to the gate.\n. It's impossible to set them to the 'current' values, because we've no way of knowing what that might be. But I agree it makes sense to swap isUp to 'true', so will do that in the 1.2 branch now.\n. Yeah I'm aware of this but still not really convinced anyone could do anything that terrible with it - what I mean is that they could spread a link with some XSS in it, but it'd never come from me (or my sites), and is kinda obvious when you look at it - meaning they may as well just do it off any old domain really. Unless you can think of another vector?\nEdit: To clarify I believe XSS is only really useful when it happens on the compromised site itself. I.e. if someone could hack the examples page listing and shove whatever JS they wanted in there, that would be a big issue for sure. But there's nothing on any of my sites that is dynamic / allows for uploads for them to compromise locally.\n. Thanks for the catch (obviously we've not had to run npm install here for a while now!), have fixed and pushed now.\n. Thanks for the catch (obviously we've not had to run npm install here for a while now!), have fixed and pushed now.\n. This should work fine now. It won't try and set anti-aliasing on the context unless you're running in Canvas 2D and not WebGL.\n. This should work fine now. It won't try and set anti-aliasing on the context unless you're running in Canvas 2D and not WebGL.\n. Can you post a code sample please.\n. I'm pretty sure the problem is the way you're loading them in a loop. Phaser.Loader isn't set-up to handle simultaneous downloads (it's on the roadmap but not included yet). So the first audio file starts and gets told to call Loader.fileComplete when it finishes (which then decodes it and adds it to the cache), but before it has a chance you've started the Loader again and it's going to try and call the same callback but with a different set of data, and a different file index. I just reckon a race condition is happening and it takes a cache load to manifest.\nI'm going to close this for now because I suspect the cause is simply trying to use the Loader in a way that it can't handle, but if you think otherwise feel free to re-open with a full code sample that I can run in browser.\n. Yes it's on my list :) I'm not sure if I will use a p2.Particle or a p2.Rectangle for the objects it emits yet. Maybe I'll make it a constructor option. a Particle would be much more efficient, but may not give the desired results, where-as in some cases it would be fine.\n. Closing as I've started work on it already.\n. It's probably dying because _bodyCallbacks doesn't exist on a. You can add p2 bodies directly to the world, but if you do you'll need to either turn off the World.impactHandler or just reassign it to your own function to deal with the events (probably easier and more flexible)\n. I've sorted out the impact handler a lot yesterday and created new examples for it. Seems to be working how I need it to now.\n.

I can't merge this with master, but I have manually merged them all into the 1.2 build.\n. Yeah quite a bit changed in there. Can you do a fresh pull (as it's updated a lot today) and tell me if it's still happening, and if so post a little bit of code up (also see examples/wip/state parameters.js or destroy state.js)\n. Actually don't worry, grab the latest push - I've fixed what was causing it.\n. Have applied your fix manually to 1.2, cheers.\n. I need more to go on. Please post a code sample.\n.

I'm going to close this as I've tested it in 1.2 using the new tilemap collision code and I can't pass through any vertical walls (or horizontal ones for that matter) any more.\n. It's because you're calling setMute directly, so it never gets a chance to set the internal _codeMuted flag. If you call game.sound.mute = true then it doesn't do what you describe.\nHaving said that I just noticed I forgot to do the jsdocs for setMute, which would have marked it as private. So I'll do that now.\n. Volume issue fixed - damn math.clamp :)\n. I don't understand your question, sorry. Please re-phrase or give example code. This is probably best addressed on the Phaser support forum.\n. Thanks for reporting this, and you used github issues just fine :) However this is now properly fixed in the 1.2 branch thanks to the change in the way Group works. So I'm going to close it off, although I appreciate it will remain an issue in 1.1.x.\n. Thanks for spotting this. I've merged a similar fix with the 1.2 branch.\n. Hi - thanks, there was one ! too many in the Stage.smoothed getter, causing it to report the opposite of the actual setting. But I've just made a test case (which I pushed to examples/wip for you) that shows it working correctly here, even through multiple state changes.\n. This is an interesting request. It's not something I will do for the 2.0 release, but I have added it to the README file under the Road Map, so it's not forgotten. Going to close this for now though.\n. Yeah sorry about that. That's what happens when you code all night :) I have already fixed it locally, so I'll close your PR if you don't mind.\n. Yes it's up to you to reset the velocity once it reaches its destination (or do something else with it, like send it off in another direction).\n. No worries, was a good reason to tidy that class up. Combined some functions, dropped some useless ones, dropped all the silly 'renderBlah' names too.\nThe only thing I've not yet tested is if the canvas needs clearing or not - i.e. if you render say a rectangle to it and move it around, does it all get messed up over time in webgl mode.\n. Thanks for spotting this. I've merged it manually with the 1.2 branch.\n. I'm happy to change this to include max in the range. I've updated the docs to reflect this. The issue was the Math.floor. Swapping for Math.round sorted it out.\n. I've seen this being a pain in both implementations (inclusive and exclusive).

If you've time I'd very much appreciate a plain vanilla version of physics_item.coffee. I'm sure that would be enough for now, rather than the whole world monitoring / body adding system you've got in place. As awesome as that is I think the simple approach will be plenty for now and we can revisit this post launch.\nIf you don't have time then no worries, I can pick through the coffee.\n.

But I cannot think of a clean way to do it for camera follow targets - the camera never changes the position of the target, it just focuses on it, but the object has gone 'off screen' because the camera is only displaying a zoomed-in portion of what it can normally see. It /thinks/ the rest is still there, it doesn't know it's hidden off the side of the canvas.\nI have tried shrinking the deadzone based on scale, but that doesn't stop the target object wandering off, although it possibly could in combination with adjusting the worlds pivot point. If you change the pivot of the world then all kinds of interesting and screwy things happen. My solution honestly would be to create a Group (or DisplayObjectContainer) that sits above the World on the Stage, and you pivot and rotate that as needed. Not ideal I know, sorry - but at least fixedToCamera was resolved! (unless pivot changes of course.. damnit)\n. Ok this is fixed now for objects that have fixedToCamera set.

It's been resolved in the sense that you're doing something the camera was never designed to handle, so the fact it can't cope with it isn't surprising. Realistically this won't get revisited until we look at replacing the camera entirely with a multiple camera system.\nIf someone wants to provide a pull request that solves it (without modifying the core API) then I'd always look at that in the meantime.\n.

Well spotted, thanks. And now fixed.\n. I've done  a lot of work on tilemaps today, mostly around collision but I've also sped-up the renderer a bit too. However it MAY not help in your situation mike - here are some things to test:\n1) Is the game running in WebGL or Canvas mode?\n2) What resolution is it running at? I.e. how large a canvas does it have to redraw all the time?\nIf in WebGL it will have to do a texture re-upload to the GPU every time the tilemap gets dirty (which if scrolling is every frame). On some GPUs, especially depending on the game resolution, this can be expensive and cause noticeable lag. My guess would be this is where the bottleneck is. Going to close as I'll need much more info to follow-up as a proper bug (dev tools dumps, etc). Feel free to discuss further on the forum though.\n.

I'm not seeing any camera jump as you describe, but I do see the Sprite itself 'stutter' up there if you drive it flat into the wall. It's possible the camera is trying to adjust itself based on this, but I'm struggling to reproduce it at all. P2 would certainly help as objects don't stutter against bounds :)\n. Thanks, merged manually.\n. Thanks, I've looked into this further and there shouldn't be any layer.callbacks array anyway, so have removed it for now. I guess I was checking for functionality that was never added!\n. Opps, referenced some consts that no longer existed. Fixed in dev, but in the meantime:\nbody.data.motionState = 1 for dynamic\nbody.data.motionState = 2 for static\nbody.data.motionState = 4 for kinematic\n. Yes. Could you submit this against the dev branch please? (and any future pull requests). Thank you :) dev is now bang up to date with master. Actually it's slightly ahead atm.\n. Oh and yes, they are private. Well, protected really.\n. Ah yes, if you look the 'enableBody' parameter got assigned to the enableBodyDebug value by mistake. Fixed in dev.\n. Sometimes they are really useful. Othertimes it's such an obvious error they're too much. Sadly I guess it's not easy for you to tell which :) You could start by just describing the problem, if I can't work it out I'll ask for more info / example. Should save time for you?\n. Agreed, I've added something to that effect in the guide.\n. This is now fixed and working in the dev branch (the 'blank tilemap' demo has been updated to reflect multi layers too)\n. You need to set body.moves = false for the objects being dragged. You can toggle this in realtime if you like, i.e. turn on during drag, turn off once placed.\n. You should set body values after enabling for physics.\n. I've uploaded an example to the phaser-examples repo showing how to do this.\n. To clarify, the new example requires the dev build of phaser to work. I've uploaded build files for this just now in case you don't use grunt.\n. Change (or reset) the offset values to shift it back again.\n. Can you please test the dev branch builds: https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/dev/build\nAs there have been loads of updates to ArcadePhysics tonight which should address the above. Feel free to comment if not (check the README for full details of what's changed).\n. Thanks, but please submit against the dev branch.\n. Sorry yes the error isn't in Phaser, it's in the examples. We failed to update them for launch. You'll notice the API has changed slightly for constructing a render texture (the key has moved to the end), which is what broke all the examples.\nAnyway we've since fixed the examples and you can find them in the examples repo.\n. Please don't submit a PR as this is already fixed in the dev branch!\n. Please try the latest build in the dev branch. Your test case works as expected now under that release: https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/dev/build\n. The issue is that integers and floats are being given to the Text function. If they are cast to strings they work fine. I'll update the example.to make sure they do that.\n. Not really sure what we can do about this, but happy to receive pull requests that address it somehow.\n. Updated in dev.\n. Ok reg-exp tweaked and testing fine now.\n. The example works fine here. If you're not actually positioning the sprite itself, but via a group, then you have to set the body to moves = false (as we did in the invaders example).\n. Use the version from the examples repo, it doesn't do it there. This should be on the examples site as well now too.\n. Sorry let me be more specific, you need the examples repo version of the game plus the dev branch of phaser. You'll find that combination will work as expected. Dev branch is literally just master with around 5 bug fixes in (so far anyway).\n. Yeah ArcadePhysics has always had its own version as it works off Sprite rotation values. But I'll check the Math one works correctly, so thanks for flagging it.\n. Ok, both done :)\n. I guess they could be, but to be in rnd they would need to be properly seeded, which just wasn't a requirement when they were added really.\n. Is the use of <T> above arbitrary, or an actual valid TypeScript data type?\n. Yes it's been called 'shutdown' since the first version really, so I can't change that now, but I may add in a check for 'destroy', although which should take priority I wonder, given how long shutdown has been used.\n. I think they should probably do 2 different things. On our roadmap is the ability for parallel states, so State.destroy should literally nuke everything within it, while shutdown is just when switching out.\nI'll update the State.js in the meantime and think it over :)\n. There are lots of use-cases for them, and they could share whatever is needed. An in-game shop could becomes its own state for example, without needing to destroy the currently running one in order to activate it. It is however a large change, so not to be undertaken lightly, hence why we're not starting development of this yet.\n. Thank you for you contribution, but please only submit against the dev branch.\n. Ok I have taken the core concept of what you did here and applied to a setAllChildren method, as I don't want to change the way setAll works like this because if you use lots of custom classes that extend Group (like I do) then it's useful for the property to be set ON the Group as well, not just its children. setAllChildren however does what you intended with your version.\n. Very old phone, but regardless do you actually get a console error or something to go on?\n. I think in the old Stock browser you can actually turn on a javascript console! It's only in Chrome you have to remote debug it. It's probably hidden under a browser flag / setting somewhere, but I'm sure I did it on my nexus 1. I'll close this for now but please re-comment if you manage it.\n. Ohh that's really interesting, thanks! I'm going to remove the use of the TypedArray internally. It's used for Sprite cache data. Should be a simple change, rather than having that massive polyfill. Of course P2 uses TypedArrays all over the place, but you simply can't use those on Android 2.x.\n. Could you grab the dev build for me and see if that fixes it please? :)\n. Yes you did it right. Awesome :)\n. Better than nothing :)\n. Actually the error was that the 'examples' task should have been removed from the grunt script, so I've addressed that directly. Also your commit was against master so I couldn't have merged it anyway. Please, always against dev, thanks.\n. Actually the error is in line 776 of Device.js, nothing to do with updateMotion.\nAnd it's caused by this: http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/blink?view=revision&revision=151136\nSo thanks for that Chrome team. Looks like it's no longer possible to tell. I will amend the documentation accordingly, and check for the existence of the profiles array before getting its length.\n. Hmm, this is the very first part of the separation code from 1.1.3:\n//  Can't separate two immovable bodies\n        if (body1.immovable && body2.immovable)\n        {\n            return false;\n        }\nSo even in that version they should never have collided.\n. Hiya - Thank you for this, but the 1.2 branch is really out-dated now. I've been meaning to delete it actually.\nDo you mind just zipping me the files and I'll sort it out manually this end? rdavey at gmail dot com.\n. The above little block of code is fine and runs ok here (substituting the font and position values though), so I assume it's something deeper or outside of this. Do you have an isolated example I can see? (online ideally)\n. Text handling hasn't changed that significantly really, just more properties to expose things that it didn't have before. I assume the Text Examples all work ok?\n. @sffetlio ah yes! I remember seeing this on the forum now.\n@UnlimitedX can you try toString()ing one of the offending Text values and see if it helps please?\nI remember I've updated the Text.text setter so that it casts anything passed to it into a string automatically, but if you're using setText that's at the Pixi level (where the bug originates iirc), skips Phaser and skips the safety net I put in place.\n. Ok cool. This is covered in 2.0.1 then, but I will submit a patch for Pixi to fix it down there.\n. You did, thanks :)\n. Please check the dev build: https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/dev/build\nI've made a LOT of changes tonight to losen things up a bit. You can now drag Sprites with physics bodies for example, without having to set moves to false (unless they are actually moving!)\n. Hi - could you check if this is still the case against the defs file in the dev branch please? As a lot of work has gone into that version to bring it more up to date.\n. @clark-stevenson do a pull from dev first if you do, as I've updated the defs today too.\n. The Phaser.Physics.P2 module = physics/p2/World.js\nThe Phaser.Physics.Ninja module = physics/ninja/World.js\n. @clark-stevenson I'd like to release 2.0.1 today but with the latest defs in, do you think they are safe to include now or should I hold back?\n. Awesome, thank you :) I'll prepare for release today then.\n. This has been fixed in the latest commit in the dev branch.\n. This is solved in the dev branch. Please don't duplicate issues, you only slow down fixes.\n. Well there's a condition I didn't consider before :) (scale zero). Have modified how the input check is done, should be tighter now. Same goes for the hand cursor.\n. Pretty sure this is fixed, but please test and let me know.\n. You should really use Debug.body(sprite) but I've fixed this anyway :)\n. Ok please check the dev branch version against this.\n. You're right, this one wasn't updated properly for the 2.0 release. I've fixed it, both online and in the Phaser Examples repository. Thanks!\n. Yes I've reverted quite a few ArcadePhysics things back to 1.1.3 level, so please give the dev branch version a go (you'll need to compile from grunt until I push a new package).\n. \n. This should now be added to the version in the dev branch. Please comment if you feel it doesn't work as expected.\n. Thanks. I cut them out of P2.World and obviously forgot to update properly.\n. I know it's asking a lot, but I think you'll find this is a limitation of the way Graphics are rendered in PIXI in WebGL, and if you tried to re-create the above in a pure Pixi environment, you'd still see the same happening. Geometry graphics objects in WebGL are really quite expensive the more you have of them, it's better to use the cacheAsTexture/Bitmap feature and then paste that to a RenderTexture (or just use it as the texture for a Sprite) instead. Or use Canvas.\n. Thanks for this :)\n. Basically the loadPolygon function was modifying the cache data array, hence the error. Fixed in 2.0.1 :)\n. Awesomeness :) I've had to tidy your code a bit to get it to pass jshint, but otherwise this is great, thank you!\n. We no longer use the Int16Array, so that should be fine now. The Float32 is coming from Pixi though, so may require a patch to their repo. Will have a look at it.\n. Ok I'm closing this as 2.0.1 is working in IE9 so long as you don't use the version that has P2 bundled into it (or if you do, you need the polyfill above).\n. Until we have somewhere better to collect these I'll merge it in. Thanks @Rafarel.\n. The above code shouldn't work in any version of Phaser - because you're telling it to use an image as the preloader sprite that hasn't yet been loaded! Look at the resources folder and then the project templates to see how you should be splitting up the boot and preload process.\nI expect the above only ever worked out of sheer fluke, i.e. the image maybe loaded fast enough locally in order to start rendering, but either way the approach above is wrong and needs fixing, sorry.\n. No worries. The basic issue is that the preload process starts at the END of the preload function :)\n. Thanks. I've merged this change locally as you submitted it against the master branch (we can only merge with dev branch).\n. Nice.\n. Thanks for the bug report. This has now been fixed.\n. Thanks, I had already implemented something similar to this earlier today! Almost identical to your approach :)\n. Yes I disabled it while working out a different issue, but it's all back in now and the Examples are working as expected.\n. Please always check the dev branch. This is where we work on the latest version. You'll find that the above situation won't ever happen in there, because it never gets as far as the separateX/Y methods.\n. (which means we ought to remove the parameter actually, so I'll do that today)\n. Your 'repeat' value is set to zero (6th parameter). Set it to a higher value, like 1000 for example, and try that.\n. I'll correct the docs, but you could use Number.MAX_VALUE as the repeat count, which is pretty much the same thing.\n. Please please please check the dev branch. This was fixed a while ago in there.\n. Again I can't merge this because it's against the wrong branch. It does say \"The Change Log for previous versions\", which would indicate to me all versions other than the current one. But I guess it won't hurt to duplicate the changes from the readme into there as well, so will start doing that from 2.0.1 and on.\n. There's something beautifully ironic about submitting a pull request for the Contributions.md file against the master branch, when the one thing the file was created to do was inform people how to submit against the dev branch ;)\nRegardless thank you for spotting these. I have adjusted them here manually in the dev branch.\n. Actually it should be this :)\nif (this.getLayerIndex(name) !== null)\n. If you set a customSeparateX/Y on the body then it will go into the separationX/Y methods, but not actually separate them, instead the overlapx/y values are populated and it's entirely up to your code to sort out how to move them apart again.\nThis will only work if you collide the objects, not overlap them.\nseparateX/Y are protected internal methods used by collide, and were never meant to be called directly. None of your process or collision callbacks can be fired if you hit them directly.\n. I've tagged this as enhancement, please leave it open for now. I'll close it once I've added it into dev.\n. I meant to remove the orientation image actually, which is why all the Project Templates do it via the DOM (far more accurately). Either way that's an aside to the actual request.\nI don't mind adding support for this, but I'm not sure it's as easy as just resizing the renderer. Or rather, it is that easy if that's all I want to support, but it means on a resize any Sprites already on the display list will now be in very weird locations unless you've written custom code for them to monitor the game size and adjust themselves accordingly.\nMaybe I shouldn't care about this though? The Stage resizes and it's up to you to sort out the coordinate mess that will arise. All I need to do is update the world and input scales.\nCould work as a 'stage 1' for this. Where Sprites positioned based on percentages or alignment values (i.e. \"bottom-right\") rather than pixels could be a stage 2 feature to come later.\n. How does it do it in Flash @georgiee ? (it's been a while, I forget :)) I thought you had a Stage size of say 640x480 with origin at top-left (0x0), the window gets larger, say 1280x700 and basically you've just gained a load of space on the right of your Stage and the origin remains 0x0 top left.\n. Thanks for the insights and video. We already use a concept of min/max ARs and letter boxing, but the cutoffOffset sounds very useful. What isn't exposed though is a proper resize event. The renderer remains fixed at the size it was generated. Mostly because in practise game sizes rarely actually change. People don't tend to scale their browser windows around much on desktop, and on mobile they can't anyway.\nWith a proper resize event the developers can do with that whatever they like, just like they did for years in Flash, including adjusting UI placements, cropping, etc.\nIt's also important to factor in that the device resolution is rarely used as the game resolution. Very often the actual canvas size and quantity of pixels is quite smaller than what the device is capable of, and for good reason too: speed. There are hundreds of thousands of devices out there that simply can't render canvas fast enough at their actual resolutions, so we up-scale. When WebGL finally lands everywhere (yay! thanks Apple!) this will be much less of an issue :) But it certainly was a year ago when we built this and still is really.\nHowever there are of course cases for sure when you absolutely need to fill every last single pixel natively (i.e. when you can ignore crappy legacy browsers!), so we'll definitely be looking at adding proper resize support soon.\n. Except it DIDN'T HAVE ONE. So, yeah.\n. Make sure you are using the version of 2.0.1 that we released today. But then try adding this:\nicon.body.moves = false;\nAs well as immovable. With that in place it seems to work as expected here, although it's a good question why it needs it. Right now I'm not really sure, will need to investigate further, but I suspect the scale was making it think it had velocity for some reason, and it just carried on moving. The direction was nothing to do with the bullet that hit it, had you scaled it to 1.2 it would have moved somewhere else entirely.\n. Sure, the issue is purely to do with the scaling re-positioning the body. It could also be stopped by setting a max delta value for the body as well, but I'd rather find out why it's happening in the first place.\n. Just so you know I've fixed this properly in the dev branch and will probably push out 2.0.2 later today to get it into wider circulation.\n. The reason we didn't adopt this approach is because ultimately we want (and need) to support multiple Phaser instances running on the same page, which this approach doesn't allow for. Obviously not an issue for the likes of Django, but would be a big one for us.\n. This feature request has been moved to the Phaser 3 feature list (so is being closed here)\n. It took me ages to check over every single file you updated :) But thankfully I can merge this into dev now, thank you.\n. Thanks :)\n. Added.\n. checkExists is optional, the rest are required. Will amend the defs now.\n. Yeah I know, it's all just a matter of priorities really, and right now fixing the Examples and 2.0.1 were higher for me. I'll address those soon.\n. Thanks. This is now fixed in the Phaser Examples repo.\n. Thanks :)\n. I wonder if this is a Pixi bug, as anchor is one of the few properties I don't touch and pass directly to Pixi :) I'll do some tests and see, and if it is I will elevate it to an issue there.\n. Yes, this is correct, although I appreciate no-where in the documentation does it say so. So I'll update that.\n. Thanks for this. I've manually merged it into the dev branch.\n. Thanks, done. Also Steffan suggested I split the P2 World bounds into 4 bodies, not 4 shapes in a body, as it will help with the initial sweep a lot. So I'll get that done soon too.\n. Right I've decided what to do, I'll merge this and push out a new beta build to the forum. I basically want as many people as possible to check it doesn't bork their games. If all looks good I'll keep the change in for 2.0.3.\n. If it's a really small change, then I'll accept a PR for this. Otherwise I would say don't bother please, because the whole particles system is due a complete overhaul soon anyway.\n. Then you need to join the discussion on the Pixi github and add your voice there. It's not something I'm shoe-horning in like this. It needs fundamentally changing across the whole of Pixi.\n. This is just one of the threads about it: https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js/pull/730\n. True, I'd best not actually change this so have updated the docs. Thanks.\n. Lovely :) Great example too (which I've added to the examples repo, hope you don't mind?!)\n. This has been requested in the past, but the reason I didn't add it was because Pointer.position contains the exact same value, so it felt strange to duplicate it.\n. Actually, what the heck.. it will stop people asking :) Merging now.\n. :+1: \n. Yes this is correct. It's not an error, it just doesn't parse them. Feel free to submit a pull request with the feature added.\n. Hi - this is failing Travis CI because it's against master and not dev (there's no travis config file on master until we push 2.0.3 live)\n. Edit the Phaser Stage src file and in this function add in a console.log to dump out the value, like so:\n```\nPhaser.Stage.prototype.visibilityChange = function (event) {\nconsole.log(this.disableVisibilityChange);\n\nif (this.disableVisibilityChange)\n{\n    return;\n}\n\n```\nWhat does it log out?\n. To be more specific, edit phaser/src/core/Stage.js to add the above (should be line 304)\n. Ok, so move the console.log down a bit, after the return where it checks the value of it. Does it still get output to the console?\n. I just tested the following in 2.0.3 and it worked ok:\n```\nvar game = new Phaser.Game(800, 600, Phaser.AUTO, 'phaser-example', { preload: preload, create: create, update: update });\nfunction preload() {\ngame.load.image('ball', 'assets/sprites/shinyball.png');\n\n}\nvar ball;\nfunction create() {\ngame.physics.startSystem(Phaser.Physics.ARCADE);\n\nball = game.add.sprite(game.world.randomX, 200, 'ball');\n\ngame.physics.arcade.enable(ball);\n\ngame.physics.arcade.gravity.y = 200;\n\nball.body.velocity.set(200, 200);\nball.body.bounce.set(1, 1);\nball.body.collideWorldBounds = true;\n\ngame.input.onDown.add(moveBall, this);\n\n}\nfunction update() {\n}\nfunction moveBall(pointer) {\nball.x = pointer.x;\nball.y = pointer.y;\n\n//  Give a little boost to velocity\nball.body.velocity.y *= 1.5;\n\n}\n```\n. :+1: \n. Fixed in dev.\n. :+1: \n. Can you please submit this PR against https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-plugins - thanks :)\n. Closing due to inactivity.\n. Thanks, I've updated this manually in the defs.\nAlso pinging @clark-stevenson to make sure this gets merged with his master copy.\n. No worries, glad you tracked it down.\n. Yup this is fair enough request, although I need to implement it slightly differently so have made the change locally.\n. It's not so much \"not working\" as \"not even part of Phaser yet\".\n. It's a fair request though, so have flagged as a future enhancement.\n. Actually I think the issue was given away by your code in your other issue, where you had the body created on an Image object instead of a Sprite. If that is actually the case then please close this issue, otherwise more details are needed, thanks.\n. A deltaCap of 0.001 would mean you are trying to achieve a rate of 1000 frames per second.\nHave a read of this thread: http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/5522-phaser-202-arcade-physics-bug/#entry33370\n. I just capped the delta at 0.001 in 10 of the Arcade Physics examples and in every single one the motion was, as to be expected, incredibly slow. Here's one such test:\n```\nvar game = new Phaser.Game(800, 600, Phaser.CANVAS, 'phaser-example', { preload: preload, create: create, update: update, render: render });\nfunction preload() {\n    game.load.image('arrow', 'assets/sprites/arrow.png');\n}\nvar sprite;\nfunction create() {\ngame.time.deltaCap = 0.001;\n\ngame.physics.startSystem(Phaser.Physics.ARCADE);\n\ngame.stage.backgroundColor = '#0072bc';\n\nsprite = game.add.sprite(400, 300, 'arrow');\nsprite.anchor.setTo(0.5, 0.5);\n\n//  Enable Arcade Physics for the sprite\ngame.physics.enable(sprite, Phaser.Physics.ARCADE);\n\n//  Tell it we don't want physics to manage the rotation\nsprite.body.allowRotation = false;\n\n}\nfunction update() {\nsprite.rotation = game.physics.arcade.moveToPointer(sprite, 60, game.input.activePointer, 500);\n\n}\nfunction render() {\ngame.debug.spriteInfo(sprite, 32, 32);\n\n}\n``\n. Totally correct, well spotted - thank you.\n. :+1: thanks\n. I've only seen this happen in Chrome Canary so far - which browser / version did you see it in? For me the current Chrome stable still seems to work fine, but Canary is blanking out GPU updated textures (happens for any bitmapData texture)\n. No it's fine, I'm keeping a close eye on this one as I can't tell if it's a Phaser/Pixi level issue that will eventually land in Chrome stable, or just some weird regression Canary is going through.\n. Just to add - I was (hopefully!) right, this was a Canary regression as my version literally just updated itself and no longer does the weird 'black textures' bug. Phew :) It's still not clearing text properly, but I'll have a look into that. Tilemaps, bitmapDatas, etc are working properly again now.\n. @MaximeCheramy this issue isn't related to what you're experiencing. The issue you are specifically experiencing has been fixed in the dev branch of Phaser. You can get new build files from here: https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/dev \n. It also depends _when_ you're trying to achieve it. You can test if the body is in preUpdate or postUpdate by checking body.phase. preUpdate will be 1, postUpdate will be 2. If it's phase 1 and you use sprite x/y values then they will have changed by the time the render pass happens (as the sprite is repositioned in postUpdate).\n. Fixed in dev as of a couple days ago: https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/commit/a7f6165e3901985c099861da02cc4b86e7c22958\n. This feature is now merged in the dev branch and will be part of the 2.3 release.\n. This feature request has been moved to the [Phaser 3 feature list](http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/7949-the-phaser-3-wishlist-thread) (so is being closed here)\n. Excellent, thanks :)\n.

Just wondering did this work at all?\n. Thanks for this, and yes I believe you're right. I can't merge your PR as its against master not dev, but have merged locally.\n. Fixed in the change log.\n. Had to merge manually (PRs against dev please), otherwise :+1: thanks\n. :+1: \n. Nice one, thanks.\n. Interesting. This works in either:this.stage.backgroundColor = 0x333333;` but I'll have a look into the string version.\n. Yeah don't worry I'll fix the string version too in 2.0.5, but the above will work in the meantime.\n. Ok this is now fixed in the dev branch. Tested working across WebGL / Canvas on desktop and iOS (canvas only of course).\n. You don't put hex values in quotes.\n'#000000' or 0x000000\nOn Saturday, January 10, 2015, cscott5288 notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI'm unable to set the background using Canvas 2d mode:\ngame.stage.backgroundColor = '0x000000';\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/issues/785#issuecomment-69438787.\n\n\nPhoton Storm Ltd.\nhttp://www.photonstorm.com\nSkype: richard.davey\nTwitter: @photonstorm\nRegistered in England and Wales.\nCompany ID: 8036404\nVAT Number: 136 4333 27\n. Have put a first pass attempt at a fix in, which I think should solve it. If you've time to test it'd be appreciated.\n. Awesome, thanks for confirming.\n. Actually the only constraint it breaks is Distance (and we fixed it in dev). We caught it in Revolute, the fix for which made it to master, but not this one.\nIt makes sense as all the other constraints used the options object signature and I guess it just bought these 2 in line with them.\n. If you don't, hold down a key, swap focus to another window and watch as the key continues to think it's held down and then doesn't unlock when the game resumes. Same for clicks. Most clearly seen when stage.disableVisibilityCheck is true.\n. But it doesn't do a hard reset on the Keyboard if the game pauses.\nGame.gameResumed calles input.reset() with no parameters.\nInput.reset with no parameters sets hard to false.\nThe false value is then passed to Keyboard.reset and in turn each Key.reset.\n. :+1: \n. Lovely - thank you :)\n. Yup, nice clean and simple :+1: \n. Hmmm interesting - the identifier property is set only when the pointer is pressed down onto the device, and is taken from the browser DOM event. Until that happens it doesn't exist. Where-as the id property is just which number pointer Phaser has created, so they're quite different things.\nThe Pointer.identifier property can change every time you press down as well. It's reset each time.\nI think what needs to change here is that the docs don't make this clear. Also Pointer.identifier was never set on the prototype and didn't exist in the API docs, so I've fixed that now, but fundamentally it still works in the same way.\n. Right but in the above you're assuming that the identifier will always be in the range 1 to 6, this isn't the case. It's a DOM set value and can (and does!) vary between them.\nWhat is it you're actually trying to do?\n. Gotcha - in that case Pointer.id is the internal ID set by Phaser when the pointer is created, so 1, 2, 3 etc and it doesn't change, it's fixed and safe to use.\nAnd Pointer.identifier (or Pointer.pointerId) is the one set by the browser on the DOM event, which can change all over the place and isn't set until the pointer is pressed down, and gets nulled when you let go again. I guess basically what you saw was that on Android the two aligned (so pointer.identifier equalled pointer.id), but on Safari they didn't. It's not a safe assumption that they will match though. I have added these details to the docs to avoid future confusion.\nI guess what you need is a getPointerId, but then again that would basically just be the pointer.id value, so game.input.pointer1 = pointer.id 1, game.input.pointer2 = pointer.id 2, etc. So you could probably get it from there quite easily without any kind of loop?\n. Looking at the log for that file I'm not seeing anything done to it apart from a destroyPhase property since version 2.0.1. However on the Pixi level it appears to have been modified ever so slightly, including some bounds calculations which I wonder if it may cause an issue.\nThis is going to need as small a test case as possible, ideally a pure Pixi one (but Phaser would do, I can abstract it back to Pixi only) so it can be raised as an issue there if it turns out to be such an isssue.\n. To wrap your code put 3 back ticks on their own line, then past the code, then close with the same.\nSo to confirm - the above isn't actually the issue, it's the stage background color that is?\n. Ok neat, so I'll close this one as it'll be fixed when the Stage colour issue is resolved.\n. Nice one. Can you ensure this passes jshint please? As the Travis CI failed, but otherwise looks great to implement. Might be worth throwing a few simple use-cases in the phaser-examples repo too (like your multi-screen one split up into 3?)\n. Can you please submit your PR against https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-plugins\nYou won't need to fix it for jshint then ;)\n. Nice catch. A time of 1ms is pointless though, that's the same as \"isDown\".\nThe point of the methods are to reflect if the key was pressed recently, not immediately. \"recently\" being arbitrary per game really.\n. Agreed, I too would like to see some test cases showing the improvements. I did take a look at your fork but I couldn't see anything that would change the way in which the physics delta timer was calculated at all (so surely the issues you outline above would remain in that one respect?), but that may have been one of your TODO items.\nThere is only one concept of Time in Phaser: real world time (i.e. the time specified by the device) and everything is based on this (Timers, tween durations, sound markers, animation frame rates, etc). The physics delta timer is simply a real-time based delta with optional cap, nothing more.\nIn order for swapping to Game Time to be an effective change all of these things would need to be modified to allow them to use custom Clocks. This isn't a problem as such, it's just a huge amount of API modifying work. Major point release level changes imho.\nHere are some issues that I'd be curious to know how you'd handle (I'm not trying to catch you out or anything, I'd just like to know how you'd deal with them):\n- Huge time spikes with no prior warning. I.e. the browser RAF has stalled (maybe the window was minimised) but no window event was received. When the game is next updated you've got a huge elapsed value but all the while the game thought it wasn't paused anyway. This could lead to stacks of backlogged Timer events wanting to fire at once, animation frames, etc.\n- On the roadmap are parallel running States. So being able to start another State while having the current one still running. In order to facilitate this we're looking at each state having its own tween manager, etc. It seems logical it could have its own Clock too?\n- Smoothing out the physics delta timer. This value could be interpolated rather than derived like it is currently, but it would still need a cap and knowing what to set the cap is tricky and forces you to make assumptions about the target platform.\nUnless the physics delta was linked to a Game Clock I can't see how you'd ever avoid your \"lava\" situation? I think the issue is deeper than this though, I think what you'd need is to have Game Clock level control over the physics step itself, otherwise surely you've got the same penetration issues as with the current set-up? (just in a slightly different time frame). Seeing as Arcade Physics doesn't work on a step basis I reckon you're dealing with a fundamental change to how its values are derived (and/or implementing a step), which may not be worth the effort involved given how primitive it is anyway?\n- Events and callbacks can happen at /any/ time, and I've seen users do things in callbacks (utterly out of sync with the game loop) that made me question my own sanity. This could happen before the master Clock update or mid-way while running through the list of active Timers (which in itself could adjust that list, add to it, remove from it, pause the game, etc).\n. To clarify the point about callbacks happening at any time: I meant DOM based events, keyboard, mouse, touch, etc, not Timer events. DOM level events happen out of sync and can impact a running Timer (destroy it, add new ones, etc). It's here that I see the most weird stuff happen.\n. Closing this request off as we have now fully implemented a proper physics timer internally and custom game specific fps rates. There is still no concept of a \"Game clock\" but that isn't going to be part of Phaser 2.\n. Closing as @clark-stevenson got this one covered :)\n. Thanks. I've merged this locally (PRs should be against dev branch)\n. :+1: \n. Thanks for this, but could you please issue PRs against the dev branch? As that is where we build out the next release.\n. Not sure how you're scaling it, but it's working fine in this test:\n```\nvar game = new Phaser.Game(800, 600, Phaser.CANVAS, 'phaser-example', { preload: preload, create: create });\nfunction preload() {\ngame.load.spritesheet('coin', 'assets/sprites/coin.png', 32, 32);\n\n}\nvar coins;\nfunction create() {\n//  Here we create our coins group\ncoins = game.add.group();\n\n//  Now let's add 50 coins into it\nfor (var i = 0; i < 50; i++)\n{\n    coins.create(game.world.randomX / 2, game.world.randomY / 2, 'coin', 0);\n}\n\n\n//  And now we scale it: x2 on the x and y axis\ncoins.scale.set(2, 2);\n\n}\n```\n. No because it works fine:\n```\nvar game = new Phaser.Game(800, 600, Phaser.CANVAS, 'phaser-example', { preload: preload, create: create });\nfunction preload() {\ngame.load.spritesheet('coin', 'assets/sprites/coin.png', 32, 32);\n\n}\nvar coins;\nfunction create() {\n//  Here we create our coins group\ncoins = game.add.group();\n\n//  Now let's add 50 coins into it\nfor (var i = 0; i < 50; i++)\n{\n    coins.create(game.world.randomX / 2, game.world.randomY / 2, 'coin', 0);\n}\n\n//  And now we scale it: x2 on the x and y axis\ncoins.scale.set(2, 2);\n\n}\n```\n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. Yay, a PR actually against the correct repo :)\n. I've removed the function (and Math.nearestAngleBetween too for a similar reason).\nWill fix it when I get a chance, but it's safe to remove as it didn't work anyway so it isn't considered API breaking as such :)\n. :+1: \n. Ok cool, please submit PRs against dev branch though.\n. :+1: \n. Most likely due to the delay inherent in DOM mouse / touch events vs. keyboard (which evidently polls at a far higher rate). I'm going to close this as justPressed(1) shouldn't be used anywhere really (for that we provided onInputDown events)\n. Lovely.\n. I've got a few demos where a bunch of Sprites share the same crop rect (a local single rect object) that has a tween running on it, so they're all sharing the reference. I would rather this than duplicate it, especially as Sprite.crop is meant to be able to be called in real-time in an update loop. However I will update the jsdocs to inform devs about this.\n. There are a lot of things I'd like Cameras to support - proper scaling for example, rotation, camera-in-camera, multiple cameras, etc. It just complicates pretty much everything adding it though (input events specifically, pointers overlapping multiple cameras, etc), and I've sort of been hoping it's something that would land in Pixi :)\n.

It doesn't, but it's something Mat and I have discussed on many occasions and we've come up with a few concepts on how it could work (without any major decoupling). The problem is the Phaser level API changes as soon as you introduce more than one camera, they are extensive and deep.\n.

Just tested this again (as I appreciate this issue is quite old now) and audio is working fine on a Samsung S3 and a Galaxy 10, so I'm going to close this off as it's codec / audio file format specific.\n. My first question would be: Do you actually need 2400+ sprites? The whole idea of a Group is that you pool them and re-use them as they are scrolled off the screen or killed off.\nRegardless of that - what platform you are testing this on? because I just changed the groups/call all animations.js example to create 2500 fully animated and rendering sprites and it did it in around 15ms (hard to tell exactly when it's so fast). This was on desktop / Chrome, but if you've got 2400 sprites in your game I can't imagine you're actually targeting mobile anyway.\n. Try tweaking the above example and see what happens for you. Or post up a working test case I can just run and see? Should get us closer to a cause.\n. @artyprog we can't do that for you, you need to visit the Phaser github page and do it from there (as you're subscribed to github notifications, which you control, not us)\n. @artyprog we can't do that for you, you need to visit the Phaser github page and do it from there (as you're subscribed to github notifications, which you control, not us)\n. Hmm I just tested and I see no difference between adding 2500 animations in 5 batches than I do just adding 12,500 animations in one go. In short, it's a hell of a lot of animation data, arrays, frame data and signals to set-up. It still doesn't take 30 seconds, but it definitely lags (took 1700ms for me), so I can see how it would carry on getting slower.\nThere's no easy fix for this, it's just a huge set of data. What we're looking at doing is having a single global animation cache which Sprites just reference. This should help a lot, but it won't be ready for the 2.0.5 release. I'll flag it as an enhancement for 2.0.6 though.\n. Hmm I just tested and I see no difference between adding 2500 animations in 5 batches than I do just adding 12,500 animations in one go.

Closing because this is covered in #826 - but thank you :) I've added you to the contributors list too.\n. :+1: \n. It doesn't, sorry, because it over-rides the Pixi frame values which are explicitly set for the atlas dimensions already. It could work if every crop stored its own local crop rectangle, and then applied that on-top of whatever the frame needed to be already (which would also need storing somewhere). I'll have a think about it, but for now just use a single non-atlas sprite.\n. I put in the docs for crop that it doesn't work on animation frames or atlases yet, but I didn't put that in the docs for setPreloadSprite, so I'll do so in the meantime.\n. Just to say that crop and preload sprites now work fine even on texture atlases or animated sprites :)\n. I couldn't merge this because it didn't actually work properly :) But it did give me the direction I needed for a full fix, which is now implemented in the dev branch and attributed to you.\n. :+1: \n.

In fact the amount of layers should not matter at all as you should render them all on a single canvas/texture one on top of another (according to z). \n\nThis simply isn't possible with the way Pixi (and display lists in general) work. In WebGL there is no \"single texture\" to render to. All objects in the display list need rendering, and then each layer of the tilemap needs rendering to its own unique texture, otherwise positioning it within the display list is impossible, it just becomes flat.\nThe performance killer for WebGL is creating new textures and pushing them up to the GPU. At the moment that is exactly what happens, one per layer. However there are alternatives we can explore - again this is for WebGL only. But we are experimenting using a RenderTexture instead of a Canvas, as they are incredibly fast to draw (being fully batched). We would still have to create one RenderTexture per layer, there is no other possible way, but they still perform so much better it's a safe trade-off. Another alternative we're looking at is a shader based tilemap renderer, but again you'd generate each layer on its own.\nIn Canvas games there are a couple of things we can try: 1) Render direct to the renderSession context, and not to its own canvas. This should help a bit as it removes the need for drawing the layers to their own canvas and then again to the Stage. However something better to test would be 2) Edge rendering. So if the tilemap has only scrolled say 16px horizontally, then we can shift the rest of it once by copying it as a whole chunk, and then only drawing the new tiles that have scrolled into view.\nThe downside of this approach is that it doesn't allow for tiles to animate or modify themselves once drawn. In most cases this is ok, but not all. If they are allowed to modify then you have to start calculating which tiles are dirty and replotting just those, and there becomes a finite point at which it's worse to do that than just re-paint every tile anyway. The other downside is that you can't combine it with rendering direct to the renderSession (because it's cleared every frame).\nSo as you can see we've been thinking quite hard about how to improve it, and work will start on it shortly. I do agree with @lewster32 though - actually figuring out what happens internally really doesn't take much time. You could grok it within just several hours of poking around. it does require motivation however.\n. @jloa\n\nhaving 6 layers should not result in having 6 canvases.

So if the tilemap has only scrolled say 16px horizontally, then we can shift the rest of it once by copying it as a whole chunk, and then only drawing the new tiles that have scrolled into view.\nThe downside of this approach is that it doesn't allow for tiles to animate or modify themselves once drawn. In most cases this is ok, but not all. If they are allowed to modify then you have to start calculating which tiles are dirty and replotting just those, and there becomes a finite point at which it's worse to do that than just re-paint every tile anyway. The other downside is that you can't combine it with rendering direct to the renderSession (because it's cleared every frame).\nSo as you can see we've been thinking quite hard about how to improve it, and work will start on it shortly. I do agree with @lewster32 though - actually figuring out what happens internally really doesn't take much time. You could grok it within just several hours of poking around. it does require motivation however.\n. @jloa if the fixes are to p2 itself they should be submitted as PRs to Stefans p2 repository, as then they will work their way back into Phaser via the correct route.\nWe're going to upgrade p2 to the latest release for Phaser 2.1 (as it's an API breaking upgrade we couldn't include it in 2.0.7) which will be the most current version of p2. So if your fixes are aligned with that build, then all is good. If you've been fixing the Phaser P2 classes instead then feel free to submit them as PRs (against the dev branch only) as long as they don't use a customised version of p2?\n. @jloa if the fixes are to p2 itself they should be submitted as PRs to Stefans p2 repository, as then they will work their way back into Phaser via the correct route.\nWe're going to upgrade p2 to the latest release for Phaser 2.1 (as it's an API breaking upgrade we couldn't include it in 2.0.7) which will be the most current version of p2.

Hmm, I'm in two minds about this one - because it's possible to use it both ways. However relying on AudioNode.input isn't actually correct as it's not a valid property, so I'm going to merge your change and stick it into the docs in case anyone was using the old format.\n. Yeah I saw the thread. From what I can tell it's just the alive property though, I can't see anything else missing. visible for example is most definitely defined properly.\n. Yeah I saw the thread.

I can happily click away in my games in IE10, so you need to show some code you've written where this is 'broken', or provide more details.\n. Yes because in IE10/11 you get a pointerDown event, not mousedown.\nDon't listen to the mouse directly, listen to a Phaser.Pointer, or Phaser.Input.activePointer:\nif (this.input.activePointer.isDown)\nThis will work as expected, because we abstract away the source of the event.\n. Yes you're right, the Right value given should be the new \"right\" coordinate.\n. :+1: \n. Nice one :+1: \n. Yeah I agree with this, but can't change it as it will potentially break lots of existing code. So I've done the next best thing: a new parameter to control it (forceQuantity) and 2 new methods: Emitter.flow and Emitter.explode to simplify the process and also resolve this at the same time.\n. update, create, preload etc are all State level methods and should not be used in the class that extends Phaser.Game (which is why it doesn't do that at all in the tutorial!)\n. I'm afraid I'm going to close this old PR off. The reason being that I feel this is probably best served via a plugin (as you've proven above) rather than merged in this manner into the core. If we're going to support slopes natively we ought to do it fully and properly really, but I do thank you for the time spent looking at this.\n. :+1: \n. Sensible suggestion - done :)\n. :+1: \n. Sorry buy this PR is very wrong (trying to merge the whole of dev into master) - however I understand what you're asking for in terms of a feature, and it makes a lot of sense, so please open it as a normal issue (if you haven't done so already) so we can consider it fully.\n. @raphaklaus I'm sure they would be very happy to receive the feature in the Phaser CE repo!. Agreed, this should sort it.\n. There, that should sort it now. It was resetting isPlayed too early. But on further inspection pause doesn't need to set it at all, as it's set in stop.\n. Very true, it's a left-over from an earlier version. There is no need for it any more as it would execute at the exact same time as update would anyway.\n. Actually I've decided to add this in :) It's now in 2.0.6-dev.\n. The issue is that your strokeThickness is a string, not an integer. Remove the quotes from the values and it works as expected.\n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. Thanks - fixed!\n. :+1: \n. Use a more recent version, this was fixed post 2.0.2.\n. Going to close this one off, as we've spent a good while writing our own documentation parser that can handle this - as the Pixi docs uses YUIdoc syntax and we use jsdoc, and the automatic parsing of both wasn't great, and they hated talking to each other too :) So in short we gave up trying to make it work and will be releasing our new documentation shortly, in a variety of formats.\n.

I'm going to close this off as I believe it's a PhoneGap / file format issue, but here are some things to try:\n1) Find a sound that you KNOW works in PhoneGap, that you have heard play perfectly when wrapped.\n2) Check to see the bitrate and encoder the file used, and see if it will play back in Phaser normally or not.\n3) Try disabling the SoundManager.touchLocked boolean - set it to false, it may just be that the device is locked waiting for input before it'll play anything.\n.

Cache.addSound is for adding an actual sound file to the Cache - i.e. an mp3 file or similar that has been pulled in from the Loader, so the above code is correct in what it's doing. However I'll update the docs to reflect that is what it means.\n. The issue was that the interesting faces list wasn't being updated on the tiles during setCollision. I pulled down your test files, made a small change in 2.1-dev and it works as expected now.\n. I've been going through this tonight:\n1) The _buttons array is populated only when a button is pressed. This is based on how Key presses are handled.\n2) Callbacks in the hotkeys array are called in the processButtonDown / Up / Float methods.\nHowever I'm not convinced that we need a buttons AND hotkeys array. For Keyboard it makes sense as it could create a whole load of Key objects otherwise, but for a Gamepad you're only ever dealing with around 16 buttons and really are only likely to have 1 (or 2 at the most) gamepads connected anyway, so it's a quite manageable number of objects.\nWith that in mind I'm going to refactor it now to remove the hotkeys array and auto-populate the buttons array when a pad is connected. I'll also add your PS3 mappings :)\n. I've been going through this tonight:\n1) The _buttons array is populated only when a button is pressed.

Thanks, this is now merged into dev.\n. Thanks, I have merged this manually (as your PR included some gitignore updates by mistake)\n. Every tutorial released since March has covered version 2. Anything before this will of course be Phaser 1. There are lots of tutorials listed on the phaser home page, hours and hours worth in fact and a sticky thread in the Phaser forum called \"List of Phaser Tutorials\" which even breaks them down by version, so you can skip all v1 tutorials (although in lots of cases they're still relevant).\nThe codevinksy ones are especially good and cover states and state management as well as lots more: http://www.codevinsky.com/phaser-2-0-tutorial-flappy-bird-part-1/ and the other 4 parts of it are excellent, and his recent videos are too.\nThe docs themselves are completely up to date. There isn't a single part of Phaser that isn't documented and nearly all have examples as well. The parts that we're yet to find a way to integrate properly into Phaser are all the Pixi level methods and properties (such as Graphics.drawRects), although they are documented on the Pixi site. Once we find a way to merge YUIdoc with jsdoc (easier said than done) we can incorporate their docs into ours. Or we may have to just bite the bullet and re-write all of their docs into jsdoc. Time consuming either way.\n. Thanks :+1: \n. Fair enough, seems like a harmless change so have implemented.\n. Fair enough, seems like a harmless change so have implemented.\n.

The problem with this approach is that it confuses what anchor actually does. I know lots of devs think it's for modifying the registration point of a display object, but it's actually just for texture alignment, and BitmapTexts don't have textures as they're a bundle of Sprites in a row. To be honest I see this issue all over the Pixi forum / github too, so it's clearly not well explained at that level either.\n. You could try submitting it as a request against the pixi repo, but I'm quite sure it's likely to be closed because it's mixing up what anchor actually does (it's not a registration point)\nI agree BitmapText needs a way to do what you're asking for, but it can't use that property to do it I'm afraid, just too risky as there's no real control over what pixi may decide to do with it in the future.\n.

Thanks, will check this out.\n. Tile.index is the index of the Tile within the tileset that the map is using. When you \"destroy\" a tile in the map data, it still has a Tile object present, but the index gets set to -1. Before (in 2.0.1) the tile object itself was replaced with 'null'.\n. Closing as your changes are now merged in, thanks.\n. I can't merge because you submitted against master instead of dev, but I have put your changes in manually.\n. Yes I no longer use the PIXI.TextureCache array, it's not actually required by Pixi at all and was causing issues with frame creation.\nThere is however currently an issue with animated + trimmed + anchor offset sprites, which I'm looking at today. But otherwise it's working much better now.\n. Each Sprite has its own texture property, which is basically exactly the same object as you'd find in the TextureCache. These objects are no longer shared so they can have their own frame properties.\n. Pretty sure you can get what you need directly from the cache? If not post up a short code sample and I'll make sure you have what you need exposed on a cache level :)\n. @clark-stevenson it's in Sound, not SoundManager :)\n. This is an error in p2 itself - could you please submit a issue / PR against their repo? I'm sure Stefan would appreciate it (if he hasn't already fixed it!)\n. :+1: \n. Very nice addition, thank you.\n. If you're destroying animations (or Sprites) via a setTimeout then it could happen at any point. Phaser may be part-way through a preUpdate loop already, it could even be within the Group.preUpdate while loop when it triggers, throwing things into disarray. We're looking at providing a deferred destroy method for situations like this, so a 'prune and sweep' would happen at the start of the core loop - but it introduces complications elsewhere, and it's still possible a setTimeout could happen in the middle of it. Even so, it's something we're looking at.\n. window.XDomainRequest returns undefined in Chrome, Firefox and IE11/12, so is ignored as it should be.\nWhat browser have you found that actually tries using it? (other than IE < 11 of course, which is the reason it's actually in there)\n. Yes this is correct for the moment, please try and avoid 2.0.6 if you can until we've resolved an issue with Pixi trimmed objects (which hopefully we'll do today).\n. This is now fixed in the dev branch.\n. Well, kind of :) emitter.width / height are currently replaced with emitter.area - because setting the width/height automatically scales the emitter. So if you set the width/height to 1 (as is the default) you get no emitter because it's so tiny the scale goes into Infinity.\nAm going to see how I can restore width/height parameters tomorrow, but for now 'area' works.\n. :+1: \n. I've done quite a lot of work on the way pixel perfect / pointers work in the dev branch. Please checkout the dev branch and see if it's now working as you'd expect (note: I didn't upload a phaser.js yet, you'll have to build with the provided grunt script)\n. There is now an optional flag to disable this - however I don't expect it will make any actual difference in this case.\n. This was fixed in #906 \n. This is fixed in dev (in the source files, not the build files).\n. preserveDrawingBuffer is now a game configuration parameter, it needs to be set on the context from the start (not added later) and should hopefully allow for canvas grabbing to happen, but try it and see.\n. Great addition - thanks :)\n. Great addition - thanks :)\n. Is there a stock browser that even supports WebGL?! Surely they all default to Canvas automatically?

I really like the thought of having a fixed number of times an animation will loop, but I'm not going to merge this because it will cause the class definition to invalidate as the signature will change (the boolean will change to a float). Feel free to add this feature in, but it needs doing properly, without the typeof check in the core and with a new Animation level property to handle the total.\n.

I don't think this ought to be an Arcade level constant, surely it should be Tile specific? And Tiles already have collision specific callbacks and collideUp/Down booleans to allow you to control things like this.\n. This is now directly supported in the dev branch of 2.3 (only nearly a year late, sorry!)\n. This is now directly supported in the dev branch of 2.3 (only nearly a year late, sorry!)\n. There are several issues with this PR:\n1) This fundamentally changes the way a number of Group methods work - they're now iterating in reverse over the children. You can't just make that kind of change, seemingly on a whim, and expect it to not have consequences.\n2) The bluebird optimisations are meant for hot path code specifically, where you need a function to be marked and opted. Several of the methods changed are not hot path targets at all. No-one in their right mind should be calling PluginManager.add or StateManager.start in a core loop! So it was never a candidate for inlining or hot/stable recompilation in the first place.\n3) Optimisations like this need more than a single jsperf test, as that's the wrong kind of test in this instance. What is needed is a trace-opt log proving that without the change Group.forEach is never optimised, and after the change it now is, and it remains that way!\nI know from looking through stacks of V8 phaser trace outputs recently that a number of the Group functions are never flagged as hot, and removing the use of arguments in some of them might resolve that. Or they may still not be flagged anyway. Either way it should be a case of adding it in to one function at a time and profiling that explicitly, rather than a wholesale copy/replace.\nIf you look through a trace dump you'll see there are a number of deopts going on that would be far more useful to fix initially. For example Rectangle.clone gets evicted, but more worryingly (given how often it's used) PIXI.DisplayObjectContainer.updateTransform and even PIXI.CanvasRenderer.renderDisplayObject are deopted as well (mostly due to unknown maps in the polymorphic calls).\n. Closing due to inactivity.\n. Closing due to inactivity.\n. I did consider it, but I hardly use bind at all in Phaser, and the big popular browsers support bind natively now so the polyfill is ignored. I'm more interested in the implication on this approach on the use of arguments than bind, which seems like it could be more beneficial. Still more in depth performance checks needed (and a time machine to fit all this stuff in too).\n.

Sound._sound.duration doesn't become available until you call play on it. At least that used to be the case when the Sound class was written (you'll even find a comment in there saying as much), but I guess it could be re-checked soon.\n. Sorted, sorry!\n. The events are being fired just fine, but the frame isn't changing. Having a look now.\n. Ok here's a simple workaround for now, pushed to dev only.\n. This is fixed properly in dev now.\n. I assume this is because the game gets a new scale of zero and the offset check didn't used to test for any changes in that. In the 2.1-dev version the new ScaleManager polls the bounding rect every frame, and resets the offset coords as required, which I'm hoping resolves this specific issue.\n. Thanks for the suggestion. I don't like using optional parameters, but I have implemented what you requested - you can now simply pass 'null' as the parent and it will default to game.world. Or if you pass no parameters at all it will do the same.\n. I'd need to see an actual example to understand what you're seeing here. The asset file + short test case will be enough.\n. I've tested your code under 2.0.7-dev just now and it's working as expected, with the correct widths in all cases. So we must have fixed something that fixed this, if somewhat inadvertently :)\n. Fixed in dev.\n. I felt 2.0 was a big enough release to warrant being Aes Sedai :) but also Lyrelle was a character, not a place. Technically Allorallen was a place I guess, but before the books timeline.\nAnyway I've uploaded the text file I was using into the repo and have renamed 2.0.7. We will carry on using place names (nations, cities or towns, sometimes maybe just places of interest) rather than characters.\n. This was fixed in 2.0.7 - so if you now pass a frame to the sprite, it will remain as that frame regardless if you add an animation or not.\n. Have you tried adjusting the World.TILE_BIAS value? It's 16 by default but controls penetration before separation, and may help resolve your issue by preventing it. Otherwise it's possible it's an internal browser / js vm float error actually causing it. I can't just add Math.round onto body coordinates or it will really mess-up motion, so this may have to be something that is handled specifically in your game code, sorry. You could also try adjusting the Time.deltaCap and World.OVERLAP_BIAS.\n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. I'm going to merge this for now, as it's a non-breaking change and a nice feature to add.

But it may just turn out that it gets compiled away anyway.\n. I'm not going to merge this, but I agree it needs doing - just in a different way.\nI've seen cases where the physics world needed to be smaller than the game world, but if I merge this it will create a reference from arcade to world, and whenever the world bounds changes arcade will too. It should be possible to over-ride that by tweaking the arcade bounds directly, but if I merge this and someone does that, it'll change the world bounds as well.\n. Maybe, but it breaks the API so I can't (knowingly!) make that change. It's already kept in sync from World to Physics (which I suspect is the most important direction), just not the other way around.\nEven so I've added in your most recent commit manually.\n. Yes good point. I've added in an optional stopAnimation boolean, which if true will basically just stop the current animation from running, otherwise it carries on going.\n. Going to merge this in \"as is\", although I think we can find a tidier way of handling it by just extending a Sprite object (rather than copying all the functions verbatim).\n.

Thank you for the clear test case.\nHowever could you give me a situation where you would ever create a tween that has autoStart set to true, and then immediately stop it?!\n.

I assume VS etc would still work if you included the defs in the right order?\n. It's actually quite dangerous to _not have Pixi as a global right now, because you cannot create multiple instances of Pixi and have them run independently under WebGL with all features working.\nProperly breaking Phaser up into modules is not a trivial task, and nothing that will be undertaken in the 2.x lifecycle to the degree we have in mind (it is something we've roadmapped for 2.5, but not in a UMD sense).\nWe've been testing ES6 modules for Phaser 3 and honestly, they're the future, so our first jump into a fully modular system will definitely be via those. This won't be until 2015 however. Until that point please feel free to carry on creating and maintaining unofficial packages as needed. If there are any trivial changes you'd like me to make to the structure to enable this, I will do so. Assuming Pixi isn't global is not one of them though. But anything else, feel free to suggest or show me a pull request for.\n. Would it even work with Browserify? From what I've seen of it I'd be surprised, but maybe I guess?\n.

It's because you're running in WebGL mode and it has to generate and push up a brand new texture, every single frame, which causes the GPU to suffer big time. Debug should never be enabled for a production game, and if you run into this you should set the game to use Canvas and it will mitigate the impact quite substantially.

I've tested this in IE11 and it's working fine:\nsprite.input.pointerDown(game.input.activePointer.id);\nI think the confusion arises from the docs, where the data-type for pointerDown incorrectly said \"Phaser.Pointer\" when it's actually needing the index of the pointer (see code above).\n. This doesn't surprise me as it needs a proper DOM event to work. Pretty sure Firefox and Chrome are the same actually. I usually bind it to the canvas object itself.\n. Ok I've been playing with this a lot tonight and was partly right in my comment above:\n1) Chrome / FF don't seem to care and will happily go fullscreen from a Signal, callback, etc.\n2) I cannot get IE11 to go fullscreen from anything other than a few different types of dom objects. If I bind the call to a button or link it works fine. But on a canvas object it just doesn't do anything for me. It's like the click event needs to be on a specific type of dom object, but the fullscreen request works fine against the phaser canvas. I have tried kicking off fs mode even from within the _onMouseDown function in Mouse.js, which is the absolute first level called from the listener and it still didn't work - which makes me think it tries to qualify the 'directness' of the click event.

I have tried kicking off fs mode even from within the _onMouseDown function in Mouse.js, which is the absolute first level called from the listener and it still didn't work - which makes me think it tries to qualify the 'directness' of the click event. If you can get it working, let me know, but I'm going to close this off for now.\n. We don't intend to fork p2, no. The fixes we made have been rolled into p2 already, and we're going to be updating to the latest release of p2 shortly. p2, as it stands \"out of the box\" is of little use to Phaser devs without our helper classes in the middle, so we'll always need to maintain those. We are however currently working on box2d support as well.\nThere are no plans to move Arcade or Ninja to their own repos at this point. There are plenty of good physics engines out there, that are designed to work entirely on their own, which neither of ours are. They are quite tightly coupled with Phaser, and as such wouldn't be all that useful to devs without it I'm afraid.\n. We don't intend to fork p2, no.

Back the background colour of your page that contains the game pure black. Also take it right back to a single small tiny test, that does nothing but load 1 single sprite (but still in AUTO mode). If even that doesn't work then it's possible there is either a Pixi level issue, or the device just doesn't really support WebGL at all.\n. Sounds like it could be a pre-multiplied alpha issue.

Email me your json file and I'll take a look.\nOn Tuesday, August 19, 2014, clark-stevenson notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nWe are having some difficulty with getting IE9 and Phaser (2.0.5 or 2.0.7)\nto work together.\nThe first thing that phaser tries to do on boot is load a config.json file\nwhich has been encoded in utf8 without bom. (According to Charles). I am\npositive the encoding is correct because I also have a profile.json which\nis loaded (outside of phaser) which looks the same and works.\nThe error I get with Phaser loading this JSON file is this:\nPhaser v2.0.7 | Pixi.js v1.6.1 | Canvas | HTML Audio | http://phaser.io\nSCRIPT10: The data necessary to complete this operation is not yet\navailable.\nDo you have any idea what causes this?\nSee my forum post for more information\nhttp://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/8580-ie9-loading-json/\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/issues/1116.\n\n\nPhoton Storm Ltd.\nhttp://www.photonstorm.com\nSkype: richard.davey\nTwitter: @photonstorm\nRegistered in England and Wales.\nCompany ID: 8036404\nVAT Number: 136 4333 27\n.

I'm going to close this issue off due to inactivity. If you would like to test it against the latest build I'm hopeful you'll find it works as expected now, if not feel free to re-open and throw a zip file at me which we can test locally.\n. Closing this off due to inactivity / approval of resolution.\n. Using the exact code + png from above it runs fine for me in Chrome 39 (Windows 7) and Canary (41) and any other browser I threw it at. I didn't test on OS X though. Does it do the same if you force CANVAS mode? Wonder if it might be WebGL specific.\n. I've retested this just now under 2.3-dev and I'm still unable to reproduce the error in any browser I throw it at. Going to close this off for now - that's not to say I don't believe it happens (clear it does), but am going to need a consistent test case, or some parameters to help define the cause, before it can be addressed.\n. Awesome. And thanks, I'll include the code as it's a very useful example to have :)\n. This feature request has been moved to the Phaser 3 feature list (so is being closed here)\n. This feature request has been moved to the Phaser 3 feature list (so is being closed here)\n. Awesome. If Stefan fixes it quickly it could still make it into 2.1.0.\n. I've pushed a version worth testing. However please note that 2.1.0 has API breaking differences to 2.0.7.\n. Please test against the dev branch.\n. Closing this off due to inactivity and the fact the fullscreen handling was rewritten extensively (as posted above). If you still find it's happening you're welcome to re-open with a test case we can run.\n. Edit the grunt manifest and create one? Just be aware that if you remove Arcade Physics you also need to remove Tilemaps and Particles as well.\n. You still need to include src/physics/Physics.js - it won't try and start any engine unless explicitly told to. It is effectively a stub.\nYou could also remove some of the Pixi extras if you don't need them: TileSprite, Rope, Strip (and the corresponding Phaser versions).\nActually if you don't need it, Sound is a good one to kill - but you will need to create your own stub to replace it, or just edit out the calls in core/Game.js to it.\n. I'm going to close this issue as you submitted a PR with your new build task in and it's merged.\n. Ah I fixed this locally while going through the issues, but thanks for the PR anyway :)\n. To be honest it was designed like this on purpose, because I never wanted to create any event listeners outside of the game canvas. However I ran into this issue recently too, so it makes sense to address it in the core (even though it was pretty easy to patch in with some custom code)\n. Thanks - well spotted! That must have been in there for ages too. Now fixed.\n. Thanks - added.\n. This feature already exists in Math.numberArray but without the step parameter. Would you mind moving the guts of your version into that instead? It will save duplicating the feature then.\n. Sweet, thanks.\n. Bum, I should have checked where numberArray is used because it used to be inclusive of the max value but your version doesn't include it. Should be fine, I'll document the change, but now need to search where in the rest of the framework I use it and adjust it.\n. It is, I'm tempted to move it back to Utils again as a result. Although there are lots of breaking changes in 2.1, one more may not matter too much.\n. Thanks, merged manually.\n. Please see #1092 for details about how this is fixed in the 2.1.0-dev branch.\n. I'm happy to remove it, but I'm sure it will introduce the 1px black lines error when scrolling a tilemap.\n. Ok Camera now has a new property: roundPx which will effectively allow you to disable this if your game requires it (by default it's on).\n. I think we should cache the config.\n. Ok in the latest build I now store the config object in P2.World.config. It still needs re-applying manually at the moment, but this should make it easier to do. P2 doesn't clear everything the config contains by the looks of it, only a few things. But I'm sure we can work out a way to reapply it.\n. I've addressed this in the dev build pushed just now. The problem was the World.apply at the end of P2s world.clear. I now handle that directly in Phaser and don't call it at all, which stops config settings being lost.\n. Can confirm this is working ok against dev branch. Full example below:\n```\nvar game = new Phaser.Game(800, 600, Phaser.AUTO, 'phaser-example', { preload: preload, create: create, render: render });\nfunction preload() {\ngame.load.image('atari', 'assets/sprites/atari130xe.png');\n\n}\nvar sprite;\nvar showDebug = true;\nfunction create() {\ngame.stage.backgroundColor = '#2d2d2d';\n\ngame.physics.startSystem(Phaser.Physics.ARCADE);\n\ngame.physics.arcade.gravity.y = 100;\n\nsprite = game.add.sprite(150, 100, 'atari');\n\ngame.physics.arcade.enable(sprite);\n\nsprite.body.velocity.set(-100, -100);\nsprite.body.bounce.set(1);\nsprite.body.collideWorldBounds = true;\n\ngame.input.onDown.add(toggle, this);\n\n}\nfunction toggle() {\nshowDebug = (showDebug) ? false : true;\n\nif (!showDebug)\n{\n    game.debug.reset();\n}\n\n}\nfunction render() {\nif (showDebug)\n{\n    game.debug.bodyInfo(sprite, 32, 32);\n    game.debug.body(sprite);\n}\n\n}\n``\n. :+1: \n. I use state changes from withincreatefunctions all over the place, in all of my client projects running on 2.1 without any issue, so will need to see an isolated code example please.\n. Basic template works fine on Chrome/Win7 for me, getting from Boot to Preloader and from Preloader to MainMenu without error. Didn't change anything. Would need to add some assets to get any further.\n. Hmmm almost certainly a result of #1173\n. Ok I spent a good while looking into this last night, and it wasn't as clear-cut as a simple logic error, it's actually race condition based (could the Loader fire the callback before or after the next _pendingState was nulled). Which would explain why we never saw it in any of our games. Regardless it needed fixing and we don't re-release versions, so this has gone out today in 2.1.1.\n. :+1: \n. Can you test something for me please - see if the build of Phaser that _doesn't_ include P2 errors as well? You'll find it in thebuild/custom` folder.\n. I don't use browserify, so if anyone wants to try this fix out and see if it works, then I'll happily merge it if it does.\n. Oh hell, another one?! It's times like this I wish all package managers would just die out leaving one dominant one left.\n. > Anyways, Phaser should rework its dependency management and build process to support CommonJS the right way.\nThis isn't going to happen, sorry. If someone wants to submit a PR that is proven to fix it, and doesn't mess anything else up, then I'll happily merge it, but that's all.\n. I'm tempted to create a version of Phaser.Device that contains only the parts Phaser needs in order to run and strips out everything else. I imagine it'd be a tiny file actually.\n. Yeah, am working on it. Will do the same for some other classes too.\n. This feature request has been moved to the Phaser 3 feature list (so is being closed here)\n.

I know some projects like to use it as a \"todo\" list as well, but I don't, sorry.\n. Just to say that I'm preparing 2.4 for release, so if anyone reading this wants or needs to get more changes in to make your module life easier, now is the time to submit PRs. I merged in one tonight that fixed the require issue with NW.\nAlso just to add that Phaser doesn't use any official release of Pixi any longer. We have diverged too far from the v2 codebase with our own fixes and updates. So if you're doing anything that is requiring Pixi from npm you'll need to change that.\n. No it doesn't use that fork any longer. It's a custom version specifically for Phaser, and is part of the core code base. I guess technically I could move it out to its own repo, but it's utterly useless on its own so I'm not sure it's worth the effort.\n. I'm afraid I'm not willing to spend any time doing that. It would require rewriting a good chunk of Pixi v2, which isn't a sensible use of my time.\n. Sounds better to me. If someone wants to go ahead and submit a PR that gets it working I'll happily merge. I reckon I've another couple days of testing and fixing before 2.4 is final.\n. There isn't a single module in Phaser, and never has been. It would require re-coding the entire thing from scratch, every single class, every single file. This is not something to be undertaken lightly, and I'm dubious of the merit of doing it at all, seeing as that's how Lazer is being built.\n. Moving this over to the phaser examples repo.\n. Which browser throws the warning?\n. Ok this seems safe enough to change, so I've done so in dev. Thanks.\n. This is only possible if we swap enabled to be a getter/setter, which we could certainly do. Feels like hell of an edge case though, and easily avoided by calling Key.reset and then disabling it. Will flag it as a change request and see about adding.\n. Agreed, we can do something about that in a future version.\n. Closing this one off as it's working perfectly in Chrome and Canary touch emulation as tested today (but maybe wasn't back then!) - all signals dispatch in the correct order, across device, tap only firing if the DOWN/UP was within the threshold.\n.

Welcome to the crapfest that is iOS UIWebView :( Although iOS8 should remedy this in a couple of weeks.\n. Are the iOS8 tests in WebGL or Canvas mode though?\n. WebGL mode shouldn't be used in CocoonJS (as counter intuitive as that sounds, Canvas+ is the accelerated mode). Regardless, the main issue here is the same as with the Debug layer.\nSee this comment for details about the only real way we can address it: https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/issues/839#issuecomment-52254368\n. Quantity of layers doesn't really matter, it just amplifies the problem. Pushing the texture up to the GPU is the issue, doesn't matter how that occurs - from a debug layer, tilemap, too many texture swaps on sprites, etc. We'll be looking at the RenderTexture tile map layer approach shortly, keep an eye on the dev commits.\n. Yes it will apply to both, but will have the largest impact for WebGL. @englercj is currently doing some work on Tilemap rendering in Phaser (based on the approach he used in grapefruit), so hopefully something neat will come from that. You can follow the discuss at #1145 \n.

Going to close this one off for now, as the optimisations made in the dev branch address most of the issues as best we can with the current architecture.\n. Yeah a side effect of uploading a huge canvas texture to webgl every frame. For heavy text only debugging that needs to be in webgl mode I tend to use a dom overlay and write to that, but in most cases running in canvas mode is fine too - depends what is being tested.\n. Well caught, thank you! I can't see any issue with passing it through Math.round. The values should never be that small anyway. I've also updated the jsdocs to reflect they should be integers.\n. Does Safari have native support for Uint32Array? If not my guess is that the polyfill for it isn't compatible with window.crypto. Or maybe the Safari Uint32Array is being overwritten regardless by one of the Pixi / P2 polyfills bundled in Phaser, and it's causing the same issue anyway.\nThis could actually explain the reason why lots of the pixel manipulation commands in BitmapData don't work in Safari, because they use Uint32Array too, and if something has borked Safaris use of it then it explains a lot. I'll investigate further.\n. Does Safari have native support for Uint32Array? If not my guess is that the polyfill for it isn't compatible with window.crypto.

The only issue I have with calling it aabb is that it assumes people know what that is. Lots don't. However there's nothing wrong in educating them I guess. The alternative would be something like getBounds, but Rectangle.getBounds doesn't actually make sense as that isn't what it does either :) Equally calling it fromPoints to me implies it would create a rectangle from 4 point objects (the corners, or similar). I think for sanity we could leave it as is. Unless someone has a brainwave of inspiration. \n. The only issue I have with calling it aabb is that it assumes people know what that is. Lots don't.

The word create implies creation of a new one, not getting an existing one (like getBounds would) and it doesn't include Point, which is good, because actually you can give it any kind of object. It's also shorter. Lots. :)\n. Honestly I think it can just be Phaser.Rectangle.createBounds.

This feature request has been moved to the Phaser 3 feature list (so is being closed here)\n. What do you reckon @clark-stevenson ?\n. I'd rather not have the defs at the whim of another repo owner. At least right now I can edit them and push them and it's just done.\n. Going to close this off, sorry. I feel I'd prefer to maintain full control over the defs.\n. Rectangle.intersects expects 2 Rectangle objects in order to work. Failing that, it needs 2 objects that provide all of the following properties (which must be accurate and in the same local space as each other)\nwidth\nheight\nx\ny\nbottom\nright\nP2.Body does not provide any of these (except x and y). You could perhaps get them from p2.Body.aabb (via conversion of the upper and lower bounds back to px).\nEither that or your body in the code above is actually a Sprite and not a physics body at all?\n. That's just a work-around. The real fix was the WebGL color call which Mat fixed in Pixi yesterday, so we'll roll into Phaser shortly.\n. If a Sound is playing and forceRestart is false then it shouldn't restart unless Sound.override is true (by default it's false). For me the following correctly restarts the Sound even if it's already playing:\nfx.play('shoot', 0, 1, false, true);\nand this ignores the play command if it's already playing:\nfx.play('shoot', 0, 1, false, false);\nSo this is definitely correct behaviour and not a mistake. However I can see how allowing for overlapping would be useful for Web Audio, so I've enabled it via a flag allowMultiple which you'd toggle in the Sound object itself. That would give you back what you had previously, while keeping the meaning for forceRestart correct.\n. Correct, this needs to be done as part of your workflow.\n. Filters in Phaser aren't passed through any middle layer, they go directly to Pixi, so whatever applies there applies to Phaser identically.\n. I like this, but we may as well adjust fadeIn and fadeOut to actually use it too.\n. Merged and I've updated fadeIn and fadeOut to use fadeTo. No point duplicating it :)\n. Yes, there is no concept of 'removed from world' anywhere in Phaser yet. I.e. when a group is removed from the world, it doesn't tell its children. There's no property that can be checked to tell if an object is in the world or not, so this needs implementing across the board really - which is definitely possible, but not a small change. Will flag as a feature for now. In the meantime, destroy your button or when you remove the group, use the destroy parameter to clear out its children. Then it won't still re-act.\n. This feature request has been moved to the Phaser 3 feature list (so is being closed here)\n. Hi - thanks for this. I'm going to merge your fix in, but I'm afraid I'm going to remove the @author block that was added (maybe automatically by your IDE?). You will of course be fully credited in the changelog, as is everyone who contributes to Phaser, but that block is restricted for the main developer/s of the class.\n. This feature request has been moved to the Phaser 3 feature list (so is being closed here)\n. Agreed, I like PRs that tidy things up like this. Merged :)\n. Yes I'm afraid this is the correct behaviour - a side-effect of the SpriteBatch. However it's important, so I've updated the docs to reflect this.\n. Phaser will happily load and play audio using the Opus codec if wrapped in an ogg container, the most common method of delivering opus files. We can add support for direct opus file formats as well in the next version.\n. Done.\n. You need to destroy the game instance itself (game.destroy()) and then null out the game variable.\n. There's no way to destroy AudioContexts, so this is the next best thing (in 2.2 in dev branch)\n. It's not a huge amount of effort to support this really so I'll flag it as a feature request for now and decide what to do later on.\n. This is now supported in 2.1.4 (dev branch atm)\n. Thanks for this. I can't merge it because it's on the wrong branch, but have made the change locally anyway.\n. It's not technically possible at the moment, Pixi uses YUIdoc syntax and Phaser uses JSDoc and it can't parse the Pixi classes. The only solution is for us to either swap to YUIdoc (which I'm reluctant to do as it's a huge amount of work) or create our own tool to parse both the Phaser and Pixi docs and merge them together, which is something we're nearly finished on now. Once this is complete it'll be provided as the default docs for Phaser, replacing the current ones.\n. :)\n. Hi - thanks for the PR but I can't merge this, sorry. Code changes should be made against individual files in the src folder, not the pre-built ones, and always against the dev branch of the repo.\nIf you'd rather just open an issue with a suggest fix we can implement it manually.\n. Sprites don't have a velocity property. Have a look at the code under the Arcade Physics section here: http://examples.phaser.io/\n. I need a test case / example URL really. Phaser.Canvas won't black screen Firefox unless there is something in the code that uses a WebGL specific feature, like a filter for example. Obviously on your machine Firefox doesn't work in WebGL mode - I suspect your GPU might be black listed. On mine it runs in WebGL for example. But if you have a test case somewhere we could try running it.\n. I'm using Firefox 33.0.2 right now (Windows 7 though) and running WebGL Phaser examples with no issues, so this isn't a browser version level issue, it has to be something more specific. Blacklisted GPU perhaps?\n. Closing due to inactivity.\n. I replied to your forum post, but for the sake of anyone else reading here:\nThe problem is that the Physics Body relies on the Sprites world value in order to calculate its position. A Sprite only has a current world value if it's visible, because otherwise it gets skipped in the transform updates. This happens down in Pixi, not in Phaser. Thus \"visible\" and physics updates are basically tied together in a way that isn't easy to modify.\nHowever all you are really doing is trying to stop the sprite from rendering, right? If so you can do sprite.alpha = 0 - this will keep the body alive, the position updated and still have its transform populated by Pixi, but it will skip the render phase entirely. It might feel a little counter-intuitive, but it works.\n. Hi - thanks for the PR but this is already fixed in the dev branch.\n. Please test the latest dev build.\n. Awesome.. please post any further findings as new comments, I don't think I get emails about edits. Thanks :)\n. Thanks, this is fixed in master too.\n. Yeah it's probably safe to disable this now. We used to need it all the time on our BBC projects, but are finding it's required less and less, so I'm making it disabled by default.\n. I'm really sorry but I'm not going to merge this in. I like the feature it provides, but the way it's hooked to velocity properties and has hard coded values make it a bit too restrictive. I do also wonder if it's the wrong way around - i.e. I think I prefer the concept of attaching a sound to a sprite (rather than a sprite to a sound) and being able to control the degree of the pan, i.e. screen based, world based, etc.\nThis has given me lots to think about though. I'm going to close it off so we don't have the PR hanging around (from your side or mine).\n. Blimey, it's taken nearly 3 years for someone to point this out!\nI'll have a deeper look, although I'm quite literally on the verge of dumping all of the jsdoc output anyway, at which point it seems crazy redefining property to member given it's feels like such an incorrect change (even though I can clearly see you're absolutely right, it just feels wrong if you know what I mean?)\n. Dumping as in getting rid of the API docs that jsdoc generates. I will keep doc blocks themselves in the source code, but won't be using jsdoc itself to do the actual parsing for much longer.\nThat isn't a reason to not change this however, although it does complicate matters somewhat as it means a small rewrite of how properties are handled by our new docs generator. However having looked further at this I believe that we could swap to use @member as long as it's combined with a @name tag as well. This is a very slight abuse of @name but would still be semantically correct.\n. This isn't about jsdoc and what it can / cannot do, it's about the fact it's utterly incompatible with the Pixi doc format and as such the Phaser jsdoc output is missing huge chunks of inherited properties and methods, leading to many issues being opened and confusion for beginners (and seasoned) devs alike. This is a situation that cannot continue I'm afraid. I have no intention of moving to YUIdoc format, and they don't want to move to jsdoc, so we built a bridge instead.\nIt's also not about being able to export to json either, we actually need the docs in multiple formats with a variety of different structures between each of them, pulling in and merging externally authored book content to final output pdfs and chapter / index lists.\nDue to the flat nature of the Phaser namespace we need custom organisational charts too, as classes are actually very carefully grouped together, but this is impossible to be determined by jsdoc introspection without re-namespacing the whole API. This becomes even more important when plugin docs are bought into the equation.\nIt's not a short-coming of jsdoc, it has served us well thus far, but we're doing things well beyond the bounds of what it was created for and it's unfair to assume it can cope with it, and we don't want to invest time forcing it to do so either.\n. If it's in the Phaser source already, it's supported. We won't be using any custom tags. This will allow devs to generate docs using jsdoc if they so wish, they'll just always be incomplete.\n. Closing this off as it's something you've been doing bit-by-bit anyway, and will be an on-going effort really.\n. Thanks for this. resolveUrl has certainly caused a couple of issues recently (the Safari double-load error being my favourite!), but this is an interesting manifestation for sure. Might be worth skipping the check entirely for all audio, or looking at other ways of implementing it.\n. This should now be resolved in the dev branch.\n. Closing due to inactivity. This is believed fixed in the current build of Phaser. If not, please re-test and re-open.\n. Hopefully this is now covered in the latest dev build. Feel free to re-open if not.\n. This was merged locally (along with some other fixes) in the recent commit.\n. Could we include the WebGL defs but NOT reference them from the Phaser defs? (or reference them, but leave them commented out). At least they will be available then?\n. That's fine by me, TypeScript 1.0 has been available for a long time now, so I'm happy to exclude earlier versions. I'll add a note to the readme to mention this.\n. Hmmm I've done some further digging into this and even calling the Pixi renderer destroy methods in a local build, but it still happens, so I'm suspecting the Pixi destroy doesn't actually work. I'll need to confirm in a Pixi specific build and file as an issue there if true.\n. I'm putting this down as a bug for now, because it definitely happens in my local test case, but I'm still convinced it's a Pixi level bug. Need more time to investigate.\n. It did, but Pixi changed _massively in 2.1.3\n. Thanks for your test case, it really helped me isolate and fix this!\n. :+1: nice one\n. Which version of Opera (on what OS) ?\nI don't even have it installed so will need to grab it now.\n. Sorry this took a while, but I've tested the Phaser Audio Sprite example in Opera 21 and Opera 27 on Windows 7 and they're working fine. So I'm afraid it must be something specific to your example / audio files causing it (or quite likely a problem with Phaser around the time you reported this, that has since been fixed)\n. Your code works perfectly for me in 2.1.3, with no errors. Here is my test case:\n```\nvar game = new Phaser.Game(800, 600, Phaser.CANVAS, 'phaser-example', { create: create });\nfunction create() {\ngame.stage.backgroundColor = '#0072bc';\n\nvar style = { font: 'bold 60pt Arial', fill: 'white', align: 'left', wordWrap: true, wordWrapWidth: 450 };\n\nvar text = game.add.text(game.world.centerX, game.world.centerY, \"phaser with a sprinkle of pixi dust\", style);\n\ntext.anchor.set(0.5);\n\n}\n```\n. Nice one! :+1: \n. Merged :)\n. With your change in place, the following code no longer works. Without it, it works fine. Do you have another test case that shows the opposite at all?\n```\nvar game = new Phaser.Game(800, 600, Phaser.CANVAS, 'phaser-example', { create: create, update: update, render: render });\nvar poly;\nvar graphics;\nfunction create() {\npoly = new Phaser.Polygon([ new Phaser.Point(200, 100), new Phaser.Point(350, 100), new Phaser.Point(375, 200), new Phaser.Point(150, 200) ]);\n\ngraphics = game.add.graphics(0, 0);\n\ngraphics.beginFill(0xFF33ff);\ngraphics.drawPolygon(poly.points);\ngraphics.endFill();\n\n}\nfunction update() {\ngraphics.clear();\n\nif (poly.contains(game.input.x, game.input.y))\n{\n    graphics.beginFill(0xFF3300);\n}\nelse\n{\n    graphics.beginFill(0xFF33ff);\n}\n\ngraphics.drawPolygon(poly.points);\ngraphics.endFill();\n\n}\nfunction render() {\ngame.debug.text(game.input.x + ' x ' + game.input.y, 32, 32);\n\n}\n```\n. This is now fixed in the dev branch. Thanks for reporting!\n. It's important to keep the game.* manager references, as they are part and parcel of how most devs use Phaser. However I don't believe there would be an issue with having them mapped to the current parent State managers.\nLots of devs don't realise you can do this.add for example within a State to access the GameObjectFactory and always use game.add instead. Then again, there are plenty who do use it this way too. Neither is right/wrong. Phaser is built around convenience over configuration, a mantra that has contributed significantly to its popularity, so not something I'm going to significantly change. \nHowever when it comes to child states we can afford to be a little different, and this will be an interesting way to test how devs respond to it.\n. The way I see the managers working is that game.* will always point to the parent State. If the child state has elected to use the parent managers, then it can use this.* or game.* and they'll be mapped to the same thing. If it has chosen to start its own managers then this.* will point to those (and game.* will always point to the parents).\n. I'm closing this off in order to tidy up the issues list. This will form part of Phaser 3 now.\n. Not yet, we're still discussing internally - will open up soon, likely on the phaser3 repo.\n. Thanks for this. I've taken the best bits from your version and merged them with some changes I had made locally already. The resulting class is a lot better as a result. I'd still like to get it at the point where it can replace PIXI.Polygon entirely, but it will need to be a major point release to do it (2.2 perhaps).\nThe Pixi Graphics class is in need of an overhaul as well imho, the way it creates brand new objects every single time you do drawPolygon (or similar) can't be efficient. But that's another task for another day.\n. Ninja Physics was removed several versions ago I'm afraid (2.1.0 iirc). You can find a custom build with it included in the repo (build/custom folder).\n. Whoops.. into master instead of dev :)\n. True, thanks. This is fixed locally as I can't merge your PR as it's against the wrong branch.\n. Merged for testing.\n. Looking good so far, will carry on testing later, but have run this through lots of large projects we've got in-flight with no issues so far. Awesome.\n. I'm going to close this off, sorry - as it's not really an issue with Phaser but with your code. I'd suggest doing as advised and posting to the forum, you're likely to get a much better response there (if you can provide as much information about the problem as possible.. don't just post your game and say \"it dosen't work\", be very specific)\n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. Ninja is still included in the custom build folder, so worth including I think. Or maybe as its own d.ts file?\n. Agreed, let's make a typescript folder in the root of the repo. Then we could put Phaser, Pixi and Ninja in there (and that WebGL optional one?)\n. Sure will do.\n. This is now fixed in the dev branch and should do until the new State manager is started.\n. This should now be fixed in dev. Test example here: https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-examples/commit/971f0c66d77b69064bb6289da112dd523433ab56\n. They've also (finally) added proper support for image-rendering: pixelated which works beautifully across canvas and webgl. It's in Canary right now, so hopefully will hit Chrome at some point soon. \nGoing to close this off as it's technically \"resolved\", even if most of the public can't see it yet.\n. Yeah this was well discussed on the Pixi repo, the current implementation is a lot better than before (still not perfect, but definitely a lot better). So I'm going to close this one off for now as it's working \"as expected\" imho.\n. This is an upstream Pixi v2 bug (confirmed with Mat today). I will merge Pixi 2.1.2 as soon as they release it, which will fix this.\n. Closing this off as I can confirm it works properly. See the following example:\n```\nvar game = new Phaser.Game(800, 600, Phaser.AUTO, 'phaser-example', { create: create });\nfunction create() {\nvar graphics = game.add.graphics(game.world.centerX, game.world.centerY);\n\n//  Our first arc will be a line only\ngraphics.lineStyle(8, 0xffd900);\ngraphics.arc(0, 0, 135, game.math.degToRad(0), game.math.degToRad(90), false);\n\n//  As we wish to draw a 2nd arc on the SAME Graphics object, we need to move the drawing operation\ngraphics.moveTo(-100, -100);\n\n//  This will reset the lineStyle\ngraphics.lineStyle(0);\n\n//  And this draws a filled arc\ngraphics.beginFill(0xFF3300);\n\n//  Note the 'true' at the end, this tells it to draw anticlockwise\ngraphics.arc(-100, -100, 135, game.math.degToRad(0), game.math.degToRad(90), true);\n\ngraphics.endFill();\n\n}\n``\n. Just pull it down and rungrunt` and it'll build one for you.\n. Ok a fresh build has just been uploaded - please test with that.\n. Ok let's see what this spits out!\n. This bug is specific to the version of IE11 being used. In short it means you're using an older version of IE11 that doesn't support UNSIGNED_BYTE. This is fixed in the current public release of IE11.\nThere's no (known) clean way to detect this automatically, and it won't be done by Pixi either  (https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js/issues/1383) so I'm reluctantly closing this off.\n.

You're right. I've dug a little deeper and it's because Sprite and Image were both calling updateTexture on the RenderTexture. Pixi has no guards in place against this, hence the errors in IE/Safari. So I've stopped both object types from calling updateTexture at all if they're using a RenderTexture. This appears to have solved this issue, along with a few others actually.\n. You're right.

Tweens are not delta time smoothed in any way in the versions you're testing, it's still \"stuttering\" on the bounce ones, etc but the motion is harder for the eye to discern.

There will always be a brief period of time when your game first starts up where things jitter a bit, as Chrome and its kind JIT and compile Phaser internally. There is no avoiding this. However it should settle down pretty quickly (depending on system spec) - however if your test is a simple 2 second tween across the screen it's likely it won't have compiled within this time.\n.

Hi Pete,\nObject creation in JavaScript is extremely expensive, yes. it also leads to gc build up, memory spikes and then frame drops as a result. It's why I favour parameters over magic objects for method properties, use a lot of internal vars within Classes to avoid creating them at run-time and try not to mix data types stored in arrays or objects. I don't often create new objects in core methods. In short I do whatever I can to try and help Chrome and its ilk to build strong compiled class types internally and then try carefully to never morph those class shapes, which invalidates them. As JS doesn't have any form of static typing yet everything is inferred, so you  do what you can to assist it in that and once set you try not to ever touch it again.\nThere are some cases where this breaks down - using \"arguments\" within a method for example means it can never be compiled. But not allowing that means a slightly less flexible API as a result. So it's a bit of a trade off between what's good for the developers vs. what's good for the compilers. Sadly decades of JS use for everything other than games has meant there are a lot of assumptions out there (magic objects for example) on how things \"should\" work. Also we're a bit bound by the way in which Pixi works too, so it's fair to assume that lots of my attempts to not morph classes are in vain anyway :) But it's something you and I need to be careful of when building out Phaser 3 in the New Year.\nSo anyway, yes.. Keys.. I think what we have now is fine :)\n. Hi Pete,\nObject creation in JavaScript is extremely expensive, yes. it also leads to gc build up, memory spikes and then frame drops as a result.

The latest version of Pixi is merged with Phaser dev branch, so if it's fixed in Pixi it should be fixed there now too.\n. I just tested this in Pixi directly and it doesn't work in there either. So still a downstream bug :(\n. I can confirm this is now fixed in dev. Phew!\n. Well spotted, thank you :) I've fixed this in Pixi, so it'll be part of Phaser 2.2 too.\nhttps://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js/commit/81edee16f487dac59252c4423dfff6f4f9aeca7f\n. Thanks - fixed!\nNoticed a couple of other small things which I'm addressing now.\n. Same build in IE11 works fine for me in WebGL, but it's a desktop class GeForce card - I'm wondering if IE11 has black listed your GPU for some reason. Or possibly just that one specific feature. Even so it should handle it better than that!\n. I'm afraid I'm going to close this one off for now. I'm not sure it will be addressed in Pixi 2 (if it is, I'll merge the fix for sure). Alternatively if they fix in Pixi 3, and we upgrade to that, it will be covered there. But it won't be fixed directly in the Phaser source, sorry.\n. Just for reference however the Pixi issue is https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js/issues/1201 (as the link above points to the phaser repo)\n. Good spot, thanks. Will make the needed changes elsewhere.\n. This is now fixed in dev.\n. Thanks. I can't merge this as it's against the master branch (PRs against dev only) but I've made the change locally anyway so all good :+1: \n. Closing this off for now as we've got fast-cache support in 2.3-dev, which should help, and it appears to be incredibly S3 specific (thanks Amazon). This issue will remain for anyone wanting to reference the thread and use some of the work-arounds posted above.\n. I've got the perfect project to test this on! Let's see what happens.\n. So far, so good! Will need some wider community testing, but looking great in our current client projects at least (which are massively heavy on the loader).\n. Just tested locally and looks fine to me in any browser, duration appears to be what it should be. The only particle demos that don't work are ones that use Tween.generateData internally (which most of them do) as that hasn't yet been converted to the new tween code.\n. All of those examples are now too working with the latest push.\n. The issue is with Sprite.lifespan being decremented in preUpdate by time.elapsed - which is hit every Game.updateLogic call. It most likely needs to be time.elapsedMS instead. It's a Sprite issue though, not an emitter one specifically.\n. Absolutely nothing internally relies on time.elapsed any more. That was the whole point of the change.\nThe latest push should be enough for lifespan to behave properly.\n. This feature request has been moved to the Phaser 3 feature list (so is being closed here)\n. I'll merge the changes but will need to fix Sprite because it's still checking the old count value. More importantly I'm not convinced it's worth doing the 1000 * physicsElapsed every frame. I appreciate that isn't a very expensive thing to calculate, it's just that it's a bit pointless because physicsElapsed never actually changes (unless the dev changes the actual desiredFps rate, which should never happen frequently) so we may as well just save the couple extra cycles per Sprite.\n. Which version did you upgrade from? This could well just be a Pixi change.\n. I just tried the following with the dev branch of phaser and nothing deformed:\n```\nvar game = new Phaser.Game(800, 600, Phaser.AUTO, 'phaser-example', { preload: preload, create: create});\nfunction preload() {\ngame.load.image('disk', 'assets/sprites/copy-that-floppy.png');\n\n}\nvar sprite;\nfunction create() {\nsprite = game.add.sprite(400, 100, 'disk');\n\ngame.add.tween(sprite).to( { angle: 45 }, 2000, Phaser.Easing.Linear.None, true);\ngame.add.tween(sprite.scale).to( { x: 2, y: 2 }, 2000, Phaser.Easing.Linear.None, true);\n\n}\n```\n. Voila :)\n. :+1: \n. Sweet. All done.\n. This is now merged with dev.\n. This is now merged with dev.\n. \"Fixed\" in dev.\n.

Trace out the velocity speed and you'll see it's all floats, it can't ever be only pure integers - well it could I guess, I mean you could extend the Sprite postUpdate and floor the body coordinates. Or maybe just do it in the States preRender method.\nThe question is if we can get the camera to move in sub-pixels or not. If we can then it should be fine, otherwise instead of sprite jitter you'd get the edges of the camera looking funny (1 pixel vertical strips appearing now and again)\n. I have, since forever now, used an invisible sprite called \"dolly\" for exactly this. It's in most of my games :) (the reason it's called \"dolly\" is because it works like a dolly cam :)\n. I'm wondering - could you guys check this against the new build in the dev branch please? I'm wondering if it's transform related, which it may well be.\n. I'm wondering - could you guys check this against the new build in the dev branch please? I'm wondering if it's transform related, which it may well be.\n. I've spent some time looking into this today - and the solution proposed in the PR doesn't actually solve the issue. Pixi by default works on sub-pixel boundaries when rendering. It does not compensate for this, and setting camera.roundPx = true won't make any difference in the jsfiddle above, because the Sprite itself is still at a non-integer position.\nThe solution is to tell Pixi to not render sub-pixels. This only needs doing once in the renderSession, and will stop all the 'jiggling' going on without having to round any values internally (physics, camera or otherwise):\ngame.renderer.renderSession.roundPixels = true\nAdd that line to the jsfiddle and notice the difference! I'm going to close this issue off as the above should be the way this is handled. I'm half-tempted to turn it on by default, but that's a considerable change and doesn't suite all art styles, so maybe not for now. I will however mention it in the Camera part of the docs.\n.

Chrome has some serious vsync issues at the moment as well, which doesn't help matters. I can have a perfectly smooth timeline audit yet see an erratic visual display because of this, but I know it's being worked on, so am hopeful they'll resolve it soon. I would ignore the values Phaser is reporting and instead turn on the Chrome fps tools and monitor it from there - check the timeline, use the fps overlay and see.\n.

For me I'm seeing some serious performance regression with render textures full stop.

Will ask Mat. In Canvas they're just hidden canvas objects, so no difference there.\n. For me I'm seeing some serious performance regression with render textures full stop.

Perfect, thanks. I'll raise these on the Pixi repo.\n. Fixed locally in Phaser :)\n. Split to a separate issue please.\n. Upon further digging it appears that the ScaleManager sets a min-height value on the  element itself which doesn't appear to be cleared or updated properly. If commented out in Dev Tools everything resizes perfectly.\n. I have a whole bunch of sprite alignment and updates hooked to the resize callback, which are being fired every couple of seconds (in some browser sizes only), so I'll be spending a little time on this next week to see if that can be minimised. I also saw it make a tilemap jump around by a few pixels every call, but I'm thinking that might be related to something deeper, like a world bounds update out of cycle for example. Not too sure, I will investigate next week. It's quite low priority really, but unexpected behaviour all the same.\n. Thanks. I've merged this manually into dev as we don't accept PRs against master.\n. Realistically I've no desire to get into the realms of iln8 with phaser.\nI think no matter how this is implemented it will break some language somewhere.\nIs it not better to leave it under the authors control? So they can add in the breaks as required?\n. What I meant was that as the game developer you should be perfectly aware already of what size fonts you're using, and trying to fit into which size area - and also which language and language direction you need. Meaning it's far safer for you to just add \\n where you need it than hope Phaser could ever accurately guess that.\n. Thanks for submitting this issue. We have fixed this, and the fix has been pushed to the dev branch.\n. @XekeDeath yup got it, no problem. Thanks to everyone who has emailed me.\nFor those who replied to the github email and maybe don't realise your address is part of this issue, you may want to edit it away :)\n. I think that's everyones posted now, so closing this off :)\n. I believe this was addressed in the Loader update in 2.3.\n. What do the signals give back? (either the onInit or onError).\nAlso have you specified a fullScreenTarget or not?\n. Just add reset to it for the moment and it'll be fine. Do it in your game init or boot state:\ngame.debug = { preUpdate: function () {}, update: function () {}, reset: function () {} };\n. Should now be fixed in dev. There's a major upstream Pixi issue with alpha on sprites at the moment, so I'm likely to release a 2.2.1 this week.\n. Thanks - the fact no-one spotted this shows how often people use those methods I guess!\n. This is fixed in the Phaser dev branch already too. I'll do a 2.2.1 release today to get it out there.\n. Yes good point. I've updated the README (in dev atm) to remove cdnjs and use jsdelivr instead.\n. Couldn't wait any longer, have merged this in myself :)\n. Closing this as there is plenty of sound advice in this thread already. If more is needed please take it to the Phaser forum, where more people will see it and be able to respond.\n. ```\nvar tween = this.add.tween(graphics.position);\ntween.to({ x: 100 }, 100 , \"Cubic.easeIn\");\ntween.to({ x: 200 }, 2000, \"Cubic.easeOut\");\ntween.to({ x: 0 }, 2000);\ntween.start();\n// or like this:\nvar tween = this.add.tween(graphics.position).to({ x: 100 }, 100 , \"Cubic.easeIn\").to({ x: 200 }, 2000, \"Cubic.easeOut\").to({ x: 0 }, 2000).start();\n``\n. Your scale tween code works fine for me here (I replaced tweenTime with 2000). That's the code shown in the first part of your message. The second one seems a very strange way of doing it, it's just effectively replacing the original tween object with a new one.\n. Ok cool. Just a note but you shouldn't call 'refresh' any more. It's not needed in 2.2.\n. Although it's the wrong way around it still shouldn't throw an error, it should just fail gracefully. So I'll fix it to at least do that.\n. Docs updated and fix in place.\n. Because there's no actual content, so it creates an empty / null texture.\n. Going to have to close this as it's how Pixi works. You're welcome to raise as an issue there, but I think it's probably better to just be aware of when using Text.\n.divs` are 100% width by default, with a zero height, hence why horizontal works 'as is'. If you don't actually need the div to be positioned anywhere specifically, and don't have any css on it or other content around the page, then personally I wouldn't use it at all. Just let Phaser add it to the body.\n. Fixed step can't deal with tunnelling. The old system at 10fps would exhibit the exact same behaviour. Pushing the fps higher than 60 is pointless unless you're running a 120Hz monitor and will lead to more miscalculations.\nWhat is needed is a proper CCD system, but we don't have it in AP and aren't likely to add it any time soon, although I did have an idea how it could be implemented the other day, so may investigate if I get time.\n. No of course not, an object can still be travelling too fast for even a fixed-step to pick up. What it would require is the objects previous position, calculated new position, and to then step every point between them doing full collision checks on the way.\nOr it could cast a ray from the objects old position to its new destination, then intersect check each point of the ray against all possible objects, but that only works if the objects being compared are similar sizes.\n. I don't believe the issue is anything to do with the fixed-step code itself. The logic is sound.\nI will investigate further tomorrow, but I'm convinced it's because the logic and render steps are deeply coupled, when they really shouldn't be.\nThe Sprite relies on its world property being populated by worldTransform. This is fed into Body.preUpdate (and elsewhere) and  used for all AP physics. The delta values are then passed back into Sprite.position.\nHowever if the game doesn't render then Pixi never updates the worldTransform. The Sprites new position doesn't get merged with the transform or any children. Thus if physics updates say twice, or more, because of the fixed-step / spiralling, then I'd expect the values may start going mental pretty quickly. I've got a proper test harness here to step through it, which I'll do tomorrow, but I'm pretty certain this is the root of it.\n. Well it's good to know my hunch was right, but frustrating at the same time :)\nPIXI.DisplayObject.updateTransform looks pretty expensive to me. That's a load of temp. vars being created each call, although at least it's just plain multiplication on them I guess. Even so it seems like something worth avoiding.\nI'm wondering if there's an easier way - perhaps modifying the worldTransform directly, which would then be overwritten when Pixi renders anyway, but may serve its purpose for the sake of AP. My worry is if there are then any child/parent transform relationships that wouldn't take care of.\n. Ok I've just pushed up a new version that I hope will address this better.\nThe previous attempt would only work if the display list was flat, or the parent was always updated before the children, but this can't be guaranteed. So now it updates all transforms across the whole display list once per updateLogic, as it needs to to keep physics in sync, but skips doing this twice if render doesn't need it.\nWould be good to know if this still works for you both. I'd assume so, but.. :)\n. Awesome. I'll do some wider testing, but this looks good for 2.2.2.\n. Closing this off as I've had several validations from forum members that this version is working much better for them.\n. The more I think about this the more I think it needs decoupling from physics or even Sprite.postUpdate at all, and just called on a global stage level basis every single logic update (in the core game loop). This would propagate the entire display list.\nThe reasoning is that while it makes sense that a Sprite should do it in its own postUpdate, this breaks if the Sprite is part of a Group that is itself being modified. For example a Group being tweened (ala a space invaders group of aliens) and yet each alien is needing its own physics updates applied too. If we only update the aliens in their own postUpdate then their coordinates will be wrong because the parent wasn't taken into consideration.\nThis actually simplifies everything - just calling it in the core game loop and should cover all bases fully. It's also the easiest to implement.\n. Sorry this didn't ever get merged, but I'm closing it off to tidy-up outstanding PRs.\n. This is now fixed in the dev branch. Interestingly I was using the sound.loop property! But the sound.start parameters were invalidating it.\n. Closing as I've resolved this both in dev and in the example itself.\n. I think there are lots of classes that would benefit from this (geometry ones, group, etc) but I'm just worried that Unit tests cannot cover the biggest area of all, and that's visual errors. However I guess at least it would rule out those visual errors arising from base class errors.\nSo yes I'm interested in seeing a PR for this. Please don't add it to the build step though, create a separate grunt task for it. And do the PR against the dev branch, not master, or I can't merge it. We've got a quite well defined folder structure going on now, so see if the tests will fit neatly into one of those if possible.\n. It's definitely useful, I just don't believe it's possible with the current tools we have. I guess what you could do (hypothetically speaking) is run a visual test, screen grab it at set points, then compare those images against grabs from known working tests. But I've yet to see a unit test system that can do that, and it would require so much effort to set-up.\n. Out of interest I went through the issues list and excluded feature requests or general \"support\" type issues. I picked the top 10 valid ones and of those I found only 3 that could potentially be caught by unit tests, and 1 of those was a device specific issue. The rest were all visual or audio related, or would need simulated conditions to manifest.\nThis is to be expected really.\nI still think they'd be really useful, but I'm sure it'll capture < 30% of issues reported here. Even so, that's still a lot of saved time when added up.\n. There isn't enough introspection to capture audio latency issues, filter uniforms not being applied, flickering issues, scroll bars appearing and God knows what other things can and will arise. Examples can't capture them either because it's not obvious what should actually happen, they also serve entirely different purposes, it's just they've been used as point of references for issues (rightly or wrongly)\nI can't believe this is an issue exclusive to Phaser though. Every game framework, ever, must have had to deal with this. I may ask some of the Unity team I know how they deal with it. I suspect it'd be tests for internals and then a QA team for the rest. Or maybe just the wider community!\n. Yes but there are only a handful and they only cover a few basic classes.\n. Apparently it's in skia too, so that may be well worth looking at.\nPart of me is more inclined to start this properly with Phaser 3 dev in the new year, rather than shoe horn it into Phaser 2, but I guess it won't be wasted either way.\n. It's also only partly true. There are lots of cases in Phaser where a unit test could easily be written post-code. Things like all the geometry classes, math classes, rnd, net, etc. Probably hundreds of methods and operations that you could write a test for by just working out on paper what the outcome should be, never mind needing specific code for it.\n. For Phaser 2, yes. Not for Phaser 3 though.\nPixi already has a few unit tests as well, could piggy back on them perhaps.\n. This feature request has been moved to the Phaser 3 feature list (so is being closed here)\n(and yeah I quite like the cjs way of matching against pngs, will give it a go in v3!)\n. I'm a bit worried about this - while at the same time I really want to do it.\nMy worry is that we would need so many tests to accurately cover the framework that it would take months of hard work to create them all. My other worry is that by implying we have tests we lull contributors into a false sense of security if they submit a change and run the tests and they all pass, but just because the tests don't even touch the part of the framework they contributed to.\nOn the flip-side perhaps some tests are better than none at all?\n. I couldn't require it until the framework is covered fully (it would just be unfair). But I could ask them to do it.\nOk fine, if someone wants to kick this off then go for it.\n. Don't rush it. I'd rather it be a really good solid foundation for other tests to be built from, than something squeezed out in an evening.\n. It might be that it does support WebGL, but just not the premultipliedAlpha flag.\nCould you try it on some non-Phaser WebGL demos? A simple Three.js scene for example. If those work then it does support WebGL after all, just not all of it.\n. If you don't get time to update the PR then let me know. I can't merge it as is, but can make the change manually as it's just one line of code.\n. Hi @neurofuzzy  - your jsfiddle is timing out loading the skies.png file, do you have it somewhere else so I can test this on my Mac please?\n. Hi guys - just to say that I can confirm this bug on Safari / iOS. Looking into it now. The second it tries to scroll it blanks out.\n. Very strange. @neurofuzzy is absolutely right. This line kills it:\ncontext.globalCompositeOperation = 'copy';\nYet Safari supports the copy operation just fine. But in this situation it dies big time. There's no console error, it's not a crash, it just blacks out. Which leads me to conclude the issue is when the copy is using the same target and destination, as it doesn't manifest if they're different.\n. From the Apple Safari site:\n\"copy\u2014Display the source image wherever it is opaque or translucent. Display the destination image only where the source image is transparent.\"\nI'm thinking this is basically cancelling each other out.\n. @pnstickne what's the immediate implications of not using copy ?\n. @pnstickne what's the immediate implications of not using copy ?\n.

I checked them out and they're better than before, but still don't work properly. In some of them the map will scroll horizontally perfectly, but as soon as you scroll vertically you get a big black area at the bottom. This is easy to see in the 'csv test' one. The 'raycast' one works fine as its all horizontal.\nIn SciFly strangely it screws up as soon as you scroll down, but then scrolling to the right brings the display back a little. Performance is shocking though, so not sure what's up there!\n. The scrolling-one-direction blackness was in Safari on OS X, so yeah desktop.

Also you don't need to remove a child from a Group before adding it to another one - just add it immediately to the other Group and it will re-parent itself, stopping it from becoming unparented.\n.

Yeah that's fair enough - have made them consistent.\n. Yeah that's fair enough - have made them consistent.\n. True, this is now added to the overlap jsdocs in dev branch.\n. This isn't technically a Pixi issue (it's a result of a change there, but not a bug they created).\nBecause PIXI.Circle uses x, y, radius where-as Phaser.Circle uses x, y, diameter.\nPhaser replaces PIXI.Circle with Phaser.Circle - but the PIXI Graphics class now creates these objects every single time you draw something (erk) so the docs are out of whack. I'll over-ride drawCircle from Phaser.Graphics and all should be fine then.\n. That comes from PIXI, not Phaser.\nIt is what it is. I've no intension of changing it for any v2 release. v3 yes.\n. Yes it will be conformed to for v3. I could add a note to the docs, but by the time you're reading that it's already clear what the constructor expects.\nPersonally I have always hated the fact it's the radius - I've lost count of the number of times in Flash I saw it given as x / 2 in the constructor.\n. This is now fixed in dev.\n. Well spotted, thanks. This one must have been in there since forever. Now fixed in dev.\n. This method doesn't create any Sprites, just p2 bodies, so it's right that the Sprite property should be null. There's no need for it to create sprites, as it would actually end-up creating one for every tile in the map, and that would mess-up the visuals because they are rendered via the TilemapLayer anyway.\n. Just tried it here with Firefox 35 and Firefox Developer Edition and all the audio examples work fine.\nNeed more info basically.\n. @Nidre  Thanks for the comment, but to be honest that information isn't much use, sorry :) (there's nothing I can actually debug, it sounds like FF just being a dick.. but who knows?)\n. Thanks. Merged into dev.\n. Thanks for this. All PRs must be against the dev branch though.\nAs the change is small I can make it manually, unless you'd like your PR merged (helps towards github stats!) in which case please re-submit it.\n. I'm afraid my recommendation for this is going to be to disable the mouse input handler on FirefoxOS - you can do this via game.input.mouse.enabled = false. This should stop all duplicate events firing.\nIn the meantime I've put this down as something to look at in Phaser v3 (Firefox OS specifically)\n. This is fixed in the dev branch.\n. Oh God, this is horrible. Trying to think of another way to handle this!\n. I'm really sorry, but as this is such a super edge-case, yet the change impacts performance for everyone, I think I'm going to have to insist it's handled in user-land code (i.e. over-write the Sound.play call with your own prototype replacement perhaps). Sorry, I wish I could merge it, but it just feels 'wrong' :(\n. If there is any latency involved in starting playback of the audio (i.e. decoding time, or seeking within a larger audio sprite) then it's entirely possible the timer will assume the sound has finished playing before it has even begun.\nI'm not sure of your exact set-up - this can be very specific to the actual audio files being used and the way they're encoded, so we'll need a proper test case to investigate further including the audio causing the problem. Feel free to re-open this if you can provide one.\n. Actually I've just pushed up a change to the Sound class that should help with this issue massively.\n. Thanks, this is now fixed in the dev branch.\n. This feature request has been moved to the Phaser 3 feature list (so is being closed here)\n. I wonder if an easy fix for this might be to scan all the tilesets used on a layer and calculate the largest width / height used across all of them. Then use these values to calculate the update area dimensions.\n. In order to keep the Github issues clear this feature request has been moved to the Phaser 3 wishlist.\n. Does it throw any kind of error, or just not play? (should be easy enough to debug Android, less so I expect for xbox/wii u)\n. Are you using Audio Sprites for this? If not, you probably ought to be - I'm highly doubtful Android 2.x can play multi-channel audio at all, so you're probably running out of sound channels as the previous effects lock onto the old ones. For Android 2.x (and even 4.x in stock browser) I would only ever use 1 single audio file personally.\n. I've just pushed up some changes to the Sound class which may help in these cases (if the browser can use Web Audio). For legacy audio, see my comment above. I would need actual errors / test cases if the recent changes didn't help.\n. We're a bit limited until the new jsdoc template lands unless someone wants to recode the current template for us!\n. Going to close this off for now - if someone would like to submit a PR that'd be great, but I won't have time to do this personally, sorry.\n. Addressed in the latest merged changes.\n. I'm wondering if this isn't environment specific, i.e. something to do with browser-side GPU handling on a specific machine, rather than a global thing that happens (because it's not something I can reproduce here).\nThe only way I can see resizing making a difference would be if:\n1) Phaser is using a RESIZE / % based canvas, so it's just creating a load more pixels in the first place - although I doubt that's the cause here as you would have realised it yourself.\n2) Something in the new Scale Manager is causing it to try to adjust the canvas or parent size maybe (hard to profile without an example though).\nFeel free to re-open this if you can provide a use-case.\n.

Off the top of my head: input detection (pixel perfect especially) or tween updates would all need the current updateTransform fix, as it's entirely possible that an object would be tested for a pointer event in an incorrect world coordinate. I'm sure there are others. Suffice to say if an object moves, we need to update its transform. And if it moves via physics, it's especially important to update the transform again, after that change. This is especially important when objects have children.\nIn other words, we need both fixes.\n.

Closing off old PRs that are now fixed, no longer required, locally merged or were just for testing.\n. Very true :)\n. :+1: \n. It's not really anything to do with rotation or sprite motion as such, it's just that the mouse didn't move, so no movement event was triggered, so the input handler didn't re-check anything.\nIf you think about it the alternative is to re-check every single input enabled object against all pointers previous x/y coordinates, every single frame. That would account for the pointer not having moved, but the objects doing so.\nPart of me thinks that's a horrendous idea (because performance wise, it is) - the other part thinks it could possibly be a user-defined setting.\n.

If you comment out that line does it actually work for you though?\n. Right ok.. so basically if you swap states, then touch the Phaser game and THEN drag the slider it should work fine - because that sequence will set _stateReset back to false, stopping the events from being prevented. But if you swap state and then try to drag the slider immediately, it'll fail.\n. This is now fixed in dev :)\n.

Also the docs are changing constantly, so we need the Python script as part of the jsdoc generation process otherwise this becomes a little useless the moment we update the docs. Also I'm worried it'll mess-up what @clark-stevenson works so hard to maintain.\nIn that light I think this needs to generate a new defs file, not replace the current one (maybe phaser-docs.d.ts?) and we need the script merged into our workflow somehow.\n. @johnfn any suggestions on how to get your script run as part of our jsdocs grunt task?\n. Well there's a shock.. something else that breaks in 2.1.3!\n. Ok have fixed the example. It's because this text.canvas.height (which the gradient used to define its height) reports back as 32. Swapped it for text.height and it's fine again. Didn't have to touch Phaser itself.\n. Very nice! I was going to release the new version today, because we need to get the Safari tilemap fixes and updateTransform stuff into the wild asap. But after that I'll merge this into dev for a play.\nThis would be a good time to get rid of the _cache array as well. Array access being much slower than either single _cache vars or a _cache object in this instance. Also I'm sure that for if statement at the start of preUpdate could be sorted out too - iirc it looks like a transform sync, but I reckon there must be an easier way to do that now.\n. I suspect this drops the overall file size down a bit too?\nI'm tempted to deprecate the Rope class while we're at this. It's quite buggy (Pixi side) - so think it might be worth leaving out of the main build.\n. The Emitter works by creating a bunch of Arcade Physics enabled Sprites and setting their velocity as required. Hence it needs AP.\nThe Tilemaps will render without AP, but you'll need to handle collision yourself (or convert it to a P2 object, for which methods are provided)\n. No you don't need AP to use P2 for Tilemaps.\nThe only dependency is Particles. If you're not using those you could technically use a P2 only build. There's no P2 only build task, but it would be trivial for you to create one based on the existing custom builds. Copy one and tweak as needed. Just exclude Particles.\n. There are some fonts Canvas is just unable to accurately measure, so I've added in a padding value to the Text object which allows you to specify additional padding added to the calculated dimensions. Using this I was able to get you font working fine:\ntext.font = 'Fontdiner Swanky';\n    text.fontSize = 60;\n    text.padding.set(10, 16);\n. Hah, lovely!\n. It's the docs that are wrong, it says that your game will be kept to that orientation. But this isn't correct, all it does on desktop is check you've a landscape oriented monitor. Your game could have been crushed into a tiny square, or a tall rectangle, but for all Phaser cares it carries on happily ignoring this fact because the orientation API never said otherwise.\nThis is especially evident if you use a RESIZE scale mode and shrink the browser down.\nTechnically what it is doing is fine (it is a change from how it used to work though, but I don't really mind that so much) but we do need to both update the docs to explain that it doesn't check your game at all, but the monitor, and provide some kind of alternative if you really do want to check your game, not the monitor. isGameLandscape perhaps?\n. A well formatted atlasJSONHash file should never have an array inside it. I'm curious where the Opal properties are coming from too - this is supposed to be an externally loaded json file from the likes of Texture Packer. It shouldn't have been munged by anything first. If the Opal property has been truly added to the object then hasOwnProperty won't skip it. If the json is coming from some deeper internal object is it picking it up from there?\n. @gabrielrios Phaser supports 2 texture atlas formats: JSON Hash and JSON Array. The one you linked is an array format. You'll find lots of hash format json files in the assets folder too. The hash format files don't use any arrays internally, which is what I was referring to in my comment.\nIf you try and load an array format json file using atlasJSONHash it will error big time (the opposite is also true!).\nThat is all I meant about the fact that if properties or arrays have been added somewhere into the json object then it must have been tampered with by something outside of Phasers loader. Is there a reason you need to parse the json before giving it to Phaser? (or aren't using Phasers Loader to ingest it in the first place). I don't know anything about Ruby/opal so am curious to learn.\n. I guess the first thing to test then is if you load the file using the correct format, what happens? :) Does it still error?\n. I'm guessing that if you say \"this is a hash\" but it's really an array, that 'for in' still works to iterate over it - to a degree. But the opposite breaks entirely, hence why the example appears to be ok, but should really be swapped for the other format.\n. Yeah, will merge it shortly. Going to close this specific one off for now, but feel free to re-open if you feel there's still something here :)\n. This is fixed in the repo, I just hadn't uploaded the new docs to the site (but that is now done as well).\n. You're right. Can't decide if it's a Pixi issue (the preMultipliedAlpha warning certainly is, but that doesn't cause a crash) or something wrong with the retro font textures. Will investigate for 2.3.\n. Confirmed as an IE11 WebGL specific edge-case. Yay, my favourite.\n. Now fixed in dev.\n. I'd like to keep differences to Pixi as minimal as possible, but I'm no longer worried about maintaining absolute parity - so am happy to have this fixed locally in Phaser if you'd like to create a PR.\n. If you're going to submit a PR then feel free to do it against both. I can't say when Pixi will merge it as they're starting off on some major rewrite, but I'll merge it into Phaser dev instantly.\n. Just wondering how you got on with this? Should we close the issue off?\n. Thanks for the code. Now in dev :)\n. :+1: \n. As the same filter can be potentially added to hundreds of sprites I didn't want the filters themselves responsible for knowing which sprites are using it, as it would just get really messy. Instead you need to remove it from any sprite you know you've assigned it to and then destroy it. I will update the docs to make this more clear, but it's definitely not likely to be something that will ever change.\n. I'm really sorry but I'm not going to merge this in. I feel it can be easily achieved with the existing BitmapData.copy method as long as the correct arguments are provided. Rather than leave the PR hanging I think it's best to close it off.\n. I think it's very likely this old plugin no longer works properly with Phaser. I'll be doing a pass on the plugins shortly, so will address it then (or remove it most likely).\n. Closing this issue off as the relevant fixes have been merged into dev, thanks :+1: \n. As it stands this merge request is just 2 files (the template and the less file), which looks perfectly safe for me to merge if you like (as long as that is all that's required?)\n. Closing this one off as it's been addressed directly in the docstrap template repo, which I just merged the new toc.js file from today.\n. Run it locally, and add the plugin first of course, will work fine then.\n. Yes, just a matter of time. Anyway I've updated the examples repo so this is fixed now (but it's not on the site yet until 2.3 goes live)\n. iOS doesn't support the full screen API anyway, so this is probably just Chrome emulation messing up: http://caniuse.com/#feat=fullscreen\n. The behaviour doesn't happen on device though, just in Chrome emulation. Feel free to fix it specifically for that if you want, but it feels like wasted time to me.\n. This is now fixed in the dev branch.\n. Is this a question?\n. Ok I've worked on this a bit and Phaser will now automatically re-use the same audio context it created the first time around if you destroy and re-create a game. To do this you need to ensure there is a global (window level) var called PhaserGlobal:\nvar window.PhaserGlobal = {};\nIf this exists then the SoundManager will write its audio context to PhaserGlobal.audioContext when it is destroyed. When re-started it will look to see if this property exists and if it does, it'll use that context.\nThis should give you the ability you need to keep re-using the same audio context over and over.\n. This is an unfortunate limitation of the current implementation. However I'm afraid there are no immediate plans to spend any more time on this trying to resolve it (we get so far, and then hit another wall, which means the whole system needs looking at really, which is beyond the scope for Phaser).\nAnyone is welcome to submit a PR if you feel you can resolve it in a clean and relatively API friendly way.\n. Indeed, thanks!\n. Thanks for the report. I'm going to close this as it's unlikely it will ever be fixed in Pixi v2, sorry. If we adopt Pixi 3 in the future hopefully it will be part of that!\nHaving said that, could the issue be related to the image you're using?\n. I'm going to close this issue as it's a Pixi level bug, and I'm not sure it will ever be fixed in Pixi v2. If that changes we'll integrate the updates to Phaser. Equally we may adopt Pixi v3 in the future once it's had a good amount of time to settle in.\n. Yup. Merged.\n. Thanks! :+1: \n. Closing as you fixed it in your PR :)\n. Very nice. I can see you're still pushing changes up to this - let me know when you'd like me to merge it for testing.\n. There we go. @clark-stevenson would you mind checking this is still all ok for you please?\n. I suspect the tween.update isn't running in sync with the renderer. Incidentally why are you using tween.js? Given that Phaser has a tween manager built-in that is tween.js! but that is properly hooked to the internal clock, etc.\n. If you're just using Pixi then report this in the Pixi repo.\n. I've enabled this and pushed to dev. It seems to have no adverse effects in my testing, but I'll let the wider community decide and revert if it does.\n. I've enabled this and pushed to dev.

I think it's fair of Pixi to expect it is given the correct frame dimensions when creating a texture, and if there's any possibility they might be wrong then they need validating in userland code before it's asked to make a texture with them.\n.

Ok I've now added in a padding value to the Text object which will allow you to modify the calculated dimensions, thus stopping things getting cut off if set correctly.\n. @jotson Hmm, there may well be something here, but I really need to see it using a more normal Phaser set-up. Removing the Camera and using a world bounds set to Infinity (I can't imagine what that does for the bounds check!) are both so against how it's set-up I'm not entirely sure it's demonstrating the issue at hand, or something else entirely.\n@yigitozdemir But you're positioning the sprite directly (by altering Sprite.position) - the physics system only works on the location of the Body, and it tries to keep that in sync with the main Sprite position - but if you over-ride the Sprite position and start adjusting it yourself, without letting physics adjust it, then it's perfectly possible to place it right outside the world bounds.\n. Just to say that I've tested this under 2.3-dev and I cannot reproduce what you were seeing under 2.2. Here is my test code (running under latest dev branch src)\n```\nvar game = new Phaser.Game(800, 600, Phaser.AUTO, 'phaser-example', { preload: preload, create: create, update: update });\nfunction preload() {\ngame.load.image('p1', 'assets/sprites/asuna_by_vali233.png');\ngame.load.image('p2', 'assets/sprites/kirito_by_vali233.png');\n\n}\nfunction create() {\nconsole.log('State Create');\n\ngame.stage.backgroundColor = 0x4488cc;\n\n// Define game world size for player boundaries\ngame.world.setBounds(0, 0, game.width, 1000);\ngame.physics.arcade.setBoundsToWorld();\n\n// Reset camera. Don't bind the camera to the world.\n// These 2 lines make no difference, still works without them\ngame.camera.setBoundsToWorld();\ngame.camera.y = -game.height/2;\n\nvar p1 = game.add.sprite(50, 50, 'p1');\ngame.physics.arcade.enable(p1);\np1.body.collideWorldBounds = true;\n\nvar p2 = game.add.sprite(150, 50, 'p2');\ngame.physics.arcade.enable(p2);\np2.body.collideWorldBounds = false;\n\n}\nfunction update() {\ngame.camera.y += 100 * game.time.physicsElapsed;\n\nif (this.input.activePointer.isDown)\n{\n    game.state.restart();\n}\n\n}\n```\nI can click as many times as I like and the sprites always start in the same place again.\n. This is almost certainly a Pixi bug, and I suspect is linked to the way it clears up the texture after use (or rather doesn't clear it). I'll have a look and see if there is anything obvious, but am flagging as Pixi for now (it's probably worth raising over there too so they can patch it)\n.

Please PRs against dev branch only though.\n. Nice one :+1: \n. :+1: \n. Yes this is a known issue I'm afraid since we updated the docs generally across Phaser. For now please use the json file generated by jsdoc itself, or alternatively you're welcome to try and patch it and submit a pull request. Development on docgen is currently on hold as we complete other areas.\n. Well spotted, thanks.\n. Thanks :)\n.

I can't merge this because it's against master not dev, but have made the change locally, thanks.\n. Phaser.Canvas.setImageRenderingCrisp(game.canvas)\nThis now works perfectly in Canary (and I believe Chrome stable, although test for yourself). It works regardless of Canvas or WebGL mode and looks fantastic. Sadly, most other browsers ignore it, although being part of the spec that should change.\nPIXI.scaleModes.DEFAULT = PIXI.scaleModes.NEAREST\nThis tells WebGL to use nearest neighbour scaling, which again gives lovely crisp pixel art (regardless of what the browser supports). Only works in WebGL though.\nPhaser.Canvas.setSmoothingEnabled(game.context, false)\nDisables image smoothing on the context itself, so solves the issue caused above in Canvas mode. You can use this in conjunction with the above too.\nNone of these (except the top one) solve the problem of scaling the canvas with CSS though.\nIn short, there is no 100% guaranteed way to do it yet that is perfectly consistent across all current browsers. 'pixelate' is the future, but doesn't handle the past.\n. You're definitely specifying angle in radians, yes?\n. Body.angle is in degrees, yes.\naddLine(length, offsetX, offsetY, rotation) however is given in radians, but in your code above you use the variable angle which makes me wonder if its degrees or radians.\n. Closing this until a test case is provided.\n. Hmm, this line is meant to be modified to fit your project (not to actually point to the repo itself).\n. Thanks for this. Just 2 issues: 1) the PR needs to be against the dev branch and 2) This needs to edit the docstrap template itself, not the output in the docs folder. I believe the file you'd need to edit is resources/docstrap-master/template/static/scripts/toc.js\nOtherwise your fix will be lost the second we generate new doc files.\n. Nice, have updated to use the docstrap file.\n. Show me what would be needed to change in the Loader to support this, and we can consider it for sure.\n. In order to keep the Github issues clear this feature request has been moved to the Phaser 3 wishlist.\n. This ticket will never be resolved for as long as Phaser 2 remains sitting on-top of Pixi (which is basically 'forever'). This can only realistically be addressed in Phaser 3.\n. This feature request has been moved to the Phaser 3 feature list (so is being closed here)\n. Yeah I had been waiting for a new major release to address this one, as it's a bit of an API change. But this is now covered in 2.3.\n. Lovely, thanks.\n. Thanks for this - I've merged in the latest toc.js from the docstrap repo which fixes this, but you're still credited in the readme :)\n. Thank you for the test case. While undesirable I'm happy to fix this by just changing the documentation, rather than doing anything in the code. I don't want to get into the realm of searching the entire display list to see if any parent is also fixed. In short, if a parent is fixed, don't fix the children too. This is now reflected in the docs.\n. This is fixed in dev now.\n. While I agree it'd be a great feature I'm going to leave this firmly in user-land code. It's too specific a change to make to the core and would rock a lot of boats. If you really wanted to scale a game world currently, without resorting to using pivot, you could just create the world centered around 0x0 (i.e. set the world bounds to be say -1000, -1000, 2000, 2000 and position your objects accordingly. Then scaling the camera would do so from the middle of the world automatically.\n. It's now in the dev branch and will be part of the 2.3 release later this week (or early next week depending how things go)\n. Ah wait no that was my mis-reading, you did cache on the Group, not the TileSprite.. in which case yes, almost certainly a Pixi bug, sorry.\n. I'm going to close this issue as it's a Pixi level bug, and I'm not sure it will ever be fixed in Pixi v2. If that changes we'll integrate the updates to Phaser. Equally we may adopt Pixi v3 in the future once it's had a good amount of time to settle in.\n. Perfect, I didn't have time to investigate fully but thanks for confirming. Ok let's get this merged and see what happens!\n. Talk about necro posting! Support for rotated and flipped tiles was made a available in Phaser 3, this post was back in the v2 days.. Because it doesn't exist prior to 0.11 - I don't mind merging this PR but please change it to only set the type property if it exists, or provide a fallback value if it doesn't.\n. Perfect, thanks.\n. I'm sorry it's been so long since this was looked at, but I'm going to put this poor PR out of its misery and close it off. It's been left for too long, and merging now would be a nightmare, especially with the new WebGL renderer in place. We're going to have a look at a different way to support animated tiles.\n. Thanks for this. I can't merge your PR because it's against the wrong branch, but have made the update manually and credited you.\n. True, this is relatively easy to fix - however the bigger problem imho is that I don't think it should be using the interpolation function at all. In the original tween.js if you provided an array it copied the two arrays together and then passed it to the ip function in Tween.update, which only ever worked on the first element in the array.\nIn my mind I think if you give an array of values it should apply the tween to all elements of that array (providing they have correspondingly set start values), rather than just the first element of an array.\nAlso you should still provide an object to Tween.to, it should never be an array  (although I guess technically it won't hurt).\n. Here's another thought.. maybe the interpolation function should only ever be used if you give an array to Tween.to. For example this would use the approach I outlined above:\n```\n    obj = { \"data\": [ 100, 200, 300 ] };\nvar tween = game.add.tween(obj).to( { data: [ 200, 300, 400 ] }, 2000, \"Linear\", true);\n\n```\nWhereas this would use interpolation:\nvar tween = game.add.tween([ 100, 200, 300 ]).to( [ 200, 300, 400 ], 2000, \"Linear\", true);\n. Ignore the above :) I'm going with the way tween.js does it and this is now working properly in the dev branch.\n. This is now fixed in dev.\n. I can't just ignore window.blur / focus if the page visibility API is available because they do two different things. If you give focus to another window for example, the pv API doesn't handle that, so the game can't pause should you say click out onto twitter for a second, then back in again.\nI've been reading but I can't find a way to determine if the onblur was caused by an iframe or not. It still seems to signal it on a window level, there doesn't appear to be document.onblur (that actually works). So unless you can find a work-around I'm sadly going to have to flag this as \"can't fix\".\n. Closing this off as a still annoying browser bug.\n. Thank you for taking the time to open this issue. However, official support for Phaser 2 has now ended as we focus on preparing Phaser 3 for beta release. In a bid to keep the project tidy, and avoid confusion, we are closing all v2 related issues.\nThis does not mean your issue won't be looked-at. In November 2016 the Phaser CE (Community Edition) project began. The aim of Phaser CE was to allow the community to continue v2 development. Since then it has gained significant traction, with many updates and releases.\nIf you are still interested in having your issue investigated we strongly recommend testing the latest Phaser CE release. If the problem persists, please open an issue on the Phaser CE repo.\n. With your 'fix' in place I now get warnings in Chrome, Canary and Firefox. With the current Phaser code they all work fine with no warnings.\n. With your 'fix' in place I now get warnings in Chrome, Canary and Firefox.

Ok this should now be fixed in dev, please give it a bash and reopen if not! (physics too btw :))\n. Hmm it's because Loader.reset() needs true as the first parameter, but a simple state swap won't do that, so the preloadSprite is never removed. A state swap will never destroy a sprite anyway (that is your responsibility), but I think it'd make sense if Loader.reset cleared the preloadSprite object out.\n. Fixed in dev.\n. How safe is this to merge this close to release? At least I've extensively tested the current 2.3 Loader through several large client projects, but I can see lots of underlying structure changes here.\n. I'm afraid I'm going to leave this one be. I'm happy with how the Loader currently works, and will leave features like this for Lazer.\n. Depends which version of Phaser you're using.\n. Closing this off as you solved it yourself and it's now merged!\n. Nice one, thanks :+1: \n. To be honest Body.width and height should never be modified directly. It's my fault for not marking them as readonly in the docs - but I've now done so. setSize should always be used to adjust a bodies dimensions.\n. I have improved the documentation for all P2 related signals, including covering this.\n. I have improved the documentation for all P2 related signals, including covering this.\n. Collision Groups belong to Shapes, not Bodies. A single Body can contain many shapes, each with their own collision group if required. So if you ever add a new shape to a Body (which is effectively what setCircle does) then yes you need to tell it to use whatever Collision Group you need, as it can't automatically know what that is. I'll add a mention about this to the docs, but it's normal behaviour from an API point of view.\n. I can't see why TypeScript would make any difference here, the underlying code is still JavaScript. Will investigate this week.\n. Nice, this was on my list so at least it'll free-up some more time. I also intend to move the component arrays out of the classes and into a single file somewhere so they can be easily overridden before Phaser starts up.\n. I was going to make it part of the game configuration object to be honest. You couldn't create a game object until the game has booted anyway, so it should be safe to do at that stage.\n. Hmm something about this change has stopped objects from correctly inheriting properties.\nFor example if you log out Phaser.Sprite.prototype you'll see all the correct properties like exists, alive, fixedToCamera, etc. All correct. Now create an instance of Phaser.Sprite and view it, all of those things are missing. The only things that exist on the instance are functions. They _do exist in the instance prototype, but not on the instance itself (which is where they need to be)\nMaybe it's the mixin method itself not copying them correctly, but I've a feeling it's something more fundamental.\n(just thinking out loud here)\n.

Your code works fine here. What are you trying to demonstrate?\n. This is a browser bug (and a local / machine specific one at that, maybe triggered by extensions?), nothing to do with Phaser I'm afraid.\n. There's no work-around because it's entirely specific to your browser / hardware set-up / browser extension combo. The D key works fine, something you've got set-up locally is blocking it I'm afraid.

This hasn't worked since Pixi updated to 2.2 and I doubt is going to work again any time soon. I'll flag it as a bug, because it used to, but given how it works internally it's massively inefficient anyway, so it's probably no great loss.\n. This has been bugging me for a long time and is now finally fixed in dev.\n. The world/fixed to camera example is working fine here against the current dev branch. I've not tested it against a built version yet though, just source only.\n. Not sure it has ever worked for Graphics objects! Will check now.\n. Ok yes it did used to work in 2.2 - digging a little deeper it appears to be something wrong with how the mixins are being applied (a recent update I think, was fine the other week).\n. Bloody hell that was a pain in the arse to track down - and yet fundamentally so simple in the end.\n. I fixed this in dev a few days ago, have pushed it up now. Still not in the build files though.\n. Nah it's already fixed. It doesn't infinite loop though, just raises it globally. But eitherway, 'tis fixed.\n.

Phaser often uses callbacks instead of signals in areas that are likely to generate excessively high volumes of events, such as mouse movement. The cost of dispatching so many signals at such a high frequency isn't warranted, so a callback syntax is used instead.\nHowever I did quite a bit of work this week on button handling (from mouse or PointerEvent), allowing far more fine-grained polling of actual button states on a per button basis, where-as before this was impossible to do. You can now monitor booleans such as Pointer.leftButton etc, which personally I think is more useful than a constantly dispatched onHold signal.\n.

I'll have a look, but this is only reliably fixable in Web Audio.\n. Ok this is fixed as far as it can go really. You were right, if you called Sound.pause and then Sound.resume it would bleed into the marker following it (depending on how long it was paused for) under Web Audio. I have now fixed this and it will no longer do it. Under Legacy Audio it should ironically be fine already because it was using time based duration counting.\nIf you stop the Sound (i.e. by pausing the entire game) then it doesn't resume it anyway, it's just stopped dead. This probably isn't perfect behaviour, but it's consistent with how it worked before so I'm considering this one solved.\n.

Here's an example, I'll try and remove what I can from it but it should be clear:\n```\n    var game = new Phaser.Game(640, 480, Phaser.CANVAS, 'game');\nvar PhaserGame = function () {\n\n    this.wasp = null;\n\n};\n\nPhaserGame.prototype = {\n\n    preload: function () {\n\n        this.load.atlas('sprites', 'daggers.png', 'daggers.json');\n\n    },\n\n    create: function () {\n\n        this.wasp = this.add.sprite(400, 100, 'sprites', 'wasp1');\n\n        this.add.tween(this.wap).to( { y: 400 }, 2000, \"Back.easeInOut\", true, 0, 2000, true);\n\n    }\n\n};\n\ngame.state.add('Game', PhaserGame, true);\n\n</script>\n\n```\nNote that the actual error is the line this.add.tween(this.wap) where I put a typo into the sprite name. However this throws an error from the Loader - specifically:\n\n. Just to add - the error being thrown can be any JavaScript error. It doesn't have to be a Phaser level error, quite simply any error that would normally be dumped to the console is re-routed to the Loader instead. Don't let the fact that it's a tween in the code above lead you in a false direction.\nEqually the fact the error is in 'textureatlas[sprites]' is just because that was the last file loaded. If you add say an audio file into the preload and it loads last, it will be thrown in there instead.\n. Have started work on this. Narrowing it down further I see that it does matter what file was loaded in the Preloader. Swap the above for a normal image and the error comes from Tween.js as it should. I reckon any loaded file that consists of two files (like a bitmap text, atlas, etc) is the root.\n. Phew that took a long time to track down! But I've fixed it.\n.

The reason it doesn't matter which order\nyou do it in phaser is because it applies a transform to the object at\nrender time.

Closing this off because I'm afraid this just isn't how affine transformations work. It has to be done as a 2-step process (one to rotate, create a new texture from that, the another to scale it).

The problem is that Opera returns a result of 'probably' for Audio.canPlayType('audio/mpeg;') rather than a more definitive 'yes' or 'no'. It reports the same thing for 'ogg' too, so it's impossible to know to pick one over the other, so all we can do is pick the first one in the URL array given. If we filtered out 'probably' responses (and considered them as 'no') then Opera wouldn't play any audio at all as everything comes back as 'probably' or 'maybe'.\n.

Arcade Physics has never supported mixed-Group collision (i.e. a single Group contain a mixture of physics enabled and non physics enabled objects), so this isn't an entirely surprising outcome I'm afraid.\nHowever it did get me thinking that the Group._hash array should be exposed and made public, and then Arcade Physics itself could add children to it so you would be sure that only children with physics bodies existed in the hash. Then the sort doesn't need to care about invalid body types (although I left that guard in anyway).\nAlso your use-case made me think it makes more sense to elevate the sort direction property out of the World class and into the Group itself. That way a Group full of platforms could be sorted once upon creation and then wouldn't need to ever be sorted again. Whereas a Group full of baddies would still need to be sorted every single frame, as you'd always need their current coordinates.\nSo I've made all of the above changes over the last round of commits today, and it's all in the dev branch ready for further testing. As an aside, the reason that function you linked to shouldn't continue is because if it did it'll negatively skip all potential children from the wrong end of the array. They're sorted into spacial order, skipped until the colliding Sprite limit is hit, and only then can it break out. I ran a quick profile on it and it's definitely the correct way around (swap the break and continue over for example and you'll see no benefit of the spacial sort at all)\n.

Pointer zero is reserved exclusively for the mouse, even on touch devices where a mouse isn't present. It's mapped to Input.mousePointer and will have isMouse set to true.

This doesn't surprise me - the event is bubbling up to the browser and coming back down again. I'd suspect what is happening is that because the event is propagating you're seeing it fire BOTH a touch and mouse event from a single click. Ideally you ought to catch the event when it hits the top layer (outside the Phaser game) and stop it from going any further, but it might be too late by then anyway (i.e. it may have already triggered a corresponding mouse event)\n.

If the State.resize function gets called (or the onSizeChange Signal gets dispatched) then you can adapt your game size accordingly.

Here is my updated example showing mixed game object types as well:\n```\nVegetable = function (game) {\nframe = game.rnd.between(0, 35);\n\n//  Just because we don't want a false chilli (frame 17)\nif (frame === 17)\n{\n    frame = 1;\n}\n\nvar x = game.rnd.between(100, 770);\nvar y = game.rnd.between(0, 570);\n\nPhaser.Image.call(this, game, x, y, 'veggies', frame);\n\n};\nVegetable.prototype = Object.create(Phaser.Image.prototype);\nVegetable.prototype.constructor = Vegetable;\nChilli = function (game) {\nvar x = game.rnd.between(100, 770);\nvar y = game.rnd.between(0, 570);\n\nPhaser.Sprite.call(this, game, x, y, 'veggies', 17);\n\ngame.physics.arcade.enable(this);\n\n};\nChilli.prototype = Object.create(Phaser.Sprite.prototype);\nChilli.prototype.constructor = Chilli;\nvar game = new Phaser.Game(800, 600, Phaser.AUTO, 'phaser-example', { preload: preload, create: create, update: update });\nfunction preload() {\ngame.load.image('phaser', 'assets/sprites/phaser-dude.png');\ngame.load.spritesheet('veggies', 'assets/sprites/fruitnveg32wh37.png', 32, 32);\n\n}\nvar sprite;\nvar group;\nvar cursors;\nfunction create() {\ngame.physics.startSystem(Phaser.Physics.ARCADE);\n\ngame.stage.backgroundColor = '#2d2d2d';\n\n//  This example will check Sprite vs. Group collision\n\ngroup = game.add.group();\n\nfor (var i = 0; i < 70; i++)\n{\n    if (i < 50)\n    {\n        //  Vegetables don't have any physics bodies\n        group.add(new Vegetable(game));\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        //  But a chilli has a physics body\n        group.add(new Chilli(game));\n    }\n}\n\n//  Our player\nsprite = game.add.sprite(32, 200, 'phaser');\n\ngame.physics.arcade.enable(sprite);\n\ncursors = game.input.keyboard.createCursorKeys();\n\n}\nfunction update() {\ngame.physics.arcade.overlap(sprite, group, collisionHandler, null, this);\n\nsprite.body.velocity.x = 0;\nsprite.body.velocity.y = 0;\n\nif (cursors.left.isDown)\n{\n    sprite.body.velocity.x = -200;\n}\nelse if (cursors.right.isDown)\n{\n    sprite.body.velocity.x = 200;\n}\n\nif (cursors.up.isDown)\n{\n    sprite.body.velocity.y = -200;\n}\nelse if (cursors.down.isDown)\n{\n    sprite.body.velocity.y = 200;\n}\n\n}\nfunction collisionHandler (player, chilli) {\n//  If the player collides with a chilli it gets eaten :)\nchilli.kill();\n\n}\n```\n. Hmmm, I guess it could be. It's unnecessary on mobile though which is where Phaser is used most.\n. This should now be fixed in dev (along with a load of related things). Please give it a test as I don't have a device here without a sound card.\n. Thanks for the clear report - this is now fixed in dev.\n. This is now addressed in the dev branch via the new pendingDestroy property. Here's an example showing use:\n```\nvar game = new Phaser.Game(800, 600, Phaser.CANVAS, 'phaser-example', { preload: preload, create: create });\nfunction preload() {\ngame.load.spritesheet('button', 'assets/buttons/button_sprite_sheet.png', 193, 71);\n\n}\nvar button;\nfunction create() {\ngame.stage.backgroundColor = '#4b0049';\n\nbutton = game.add.button(game.world.centerX - 95, 460, 'button', nukeButton, this, 2, 1, 0);\n\n}\nfunction nukeButton() {\nbutton.pendingDestroy = true;\n\ntext = game.add.text(game.world.centerX, game.world.centerY, '- button nuked -', { font: '64px Arial', fill: '#ffffff' });\n\ntext.anchor.set(0.5);\n\n}\n``\n. You need to set the input priority on the children, otherwise the parent will always get the event as it's more important in terms of the display list: http://phaser.io/examples/v2/input/input-child-priority\n. It's not about who's on top visually, but about who's on the top of the root display list, and children are second class citizens when it comes to that.\n. Thanks, I can't merge your PR because it's against master not dev, but have made the change locally anyway.\n. Sorry can't merge as it's against master not dev, but have put your changes into dev anyway - so thanks!\n. Closing as this is now fixed in dev and 2.4 will be out very very soon (this week I hope)\n. You are loading withatlasJSONHash` - yet the example json data you've posted above is not a hash, it's an array.\n. No worries, I see this quite often and am going to make sure that all you need in phaser3 is \"load.atlas\" and once the json is loaded it works out the format for you!\n. You can pass a BitmapData to a Sprite too, so just do that.\n. It's not for the next frame, but for the Body.postUpdate function. So at the start of the frame (stage.preUpdate) the physics body is reset, aligned with the sprite and motion applied (computeVelocity). Then in your update function you can collide the sprite, change velocity, all kinds of things which will alter the velocity and / or position of the body. Then in Body.postUpdate (which is called AFTER state.update) all of these changes are applied to the Sprite position itself ready for rendering. After rendering it all starts over again.\n. I can't replicate this at all, please provide a sample. Here is the test case I used to check this against the dev branch:\n```\nvar transparent = false;\nvar antialias = false;\nvar game = new Phaser.Game(800, 600, Phaser.AUTO, 'phaser-example', this, transparent, antialias);\nfunction preload() {\ngame.load.image('girl', 'assets/pics/manga-girl.png');\n\n}\nfunction create() {\ngame.stage.backgroundColor = '#0076a3';\n\nvar sprite = game.add.sprite(32, -100, 'girl');\nsprite.scale.set(4);\n\n}\nfunction render () {\ngame.debug.text(\"Anti-alias: \" + game.antialias, 10, 32);\n\n}\n``\n. I don't believe so, no - he said he was using the antialias parameter.getSmoothingEnabledwill be 'undefined' if you use antialias.game.renderer.renderSession.smoothPropertyis set correctly toimageSmoothingEnabled` (on chrome at least). More over though, I cannot make a previously non-aliased game suddenly appear aliased just by swapping to another window and back again, so unless there is a test case that demonstrates the issue exactly I'm not entirely sure there is one.\n. You're right there isn't a need for a reference any longer (Phaser.Math used to have a bunch of functions in there and was a proper class, but isn't any more) - however it does actually work perfectly, so there's no harm in keeping it either.\nthis.math.snapTo(345, 16)\netc.\n. Issue a PR to remove it from the TS defs for State, it will remain in the actual code though.\n. Pull Request? (if you do, do it against dev branch, not master)\n. This is now merged in the dev branch.\n. I need a code example demonstrating this bug as I don't really understand it from the description. Feel free to re-open with a code sample.\n. This is now handled properly in dev branch via the new Pointer properties leftButton etc.\n. Thanks for the sandbox example. Personally I really like what it does now :) But I can see why it is unexpected. It's a side-effect from Pixi, but I'll see if we can at least make it a Text shadow option.\n. Ok this is now possible via 2 new parameters to setShadow.\n. Pretty sure this is now fixed as part of the fix we applied for #1796 \n. Closed due to inaction / suspected already fixed.\n. https://twitter.com/TooOldTooCold/status/592681042923880450\n. Yeah, thanks Google. I'll try my best to fix it this week, but we're snowed under with client work at the moment.\n. No because the examples domain doesn't have SSL on it.\n. Actually it's gone on long enough, so I've just thrown up a quick fix for it until the Examples area is redone properly to not rely on the sub-domain any more. Should work fine now from ssl or not.\n. Awesome, thanks. Have been meaning to do this for a while.\n. Wow that was a tricky one to track down, but a thankfully very easy fix! The dev branch fixes this - thank you for the really helpful issue report, it was the only thing that allowed me to resolve it!\n. Phaser doesn't need to be running in Canvas mode in order for a BitmapData to render a canvas to itself. What it does is take the canvas, extract the 2d context from it and then draws that. The problem is that in a WebGL game there isn't anything on the 2d context, it's blank. You can render a WebGL canvas to another canvas if it was created with preserveDrawingBuffer enabled, which you could do, but it can harm performance as well, so is a trade off.\n. Closing re: discussion on forum.\n. Which version of Phaser is this? because in the current (2.3 + dev) _points is an array of points and the geometry / polygon contains example is working.\nHaving said that, if you were to call polygon.flatten() then it would change the shape of the points array to be a flat list of numbers. But aside from doing this, it should always contain Point objects.\n. To be honest I dislike the way Pixi.Graphics manages drawing objects. It creates new geometry objects every time it's updated and fails to be able to take geometry objects and render them in several cases. I fully intend to go through the class and sort it out at some point soon, which will ensure I remove the polygon.flatten call too.\n. Hi - this should now be fixed in the dev branch - would be good if you could test.\n. I'm amazed input.hitTest _ever worked on a Graphics instance! I'm guessing the old version of Pixi supported it maybe. Will have a deeper look when I get time, but at least polygons should no longer get flattened by just rendering them any more.\n. This is fixed in the dev branch. You shouldn't overwrite the uniforms object really. All it needed was to swap '4fv' to '4f' and it would have worked, however I dug in a little deeper and it appears a mat4 was pointless anyway, so swapped it for a 2f and fixed a few other things in there. Also set the default size to 1.0.\n. Merged to dev, thanks.\n. Thanks for the PR, but please submit against the dev branch. Also you don't need to edit the comments defs file, as it's auto-generated based on the jsdocs and ts defs file :)\n. Thanks, this is now fixed in 1.0.2.\n. :+1: \n. Sweet as always :)\n. A Graphics object has never had an anchor (in any version of Phaser), so this is correct behaviour:\n\n. Because they don't have a texture. The Pixi anchor is a texture rendering offset (not a registration point / actual anchor), it's a bit of a legacy issue really.\n. Afraid so :) Feel free to submit a PR if you can add it in, without breaking everything!\n. Rectangles don't have a bottomLeft property, which is why it isn't in the docs. Have corrected the bottomRight one though, thanks.\n. There isn't yet, no - if you need this for your project then please don't buy the plugin until we announce otherwise (I will make it clear on the shop page in next weeks site update)\n. :+1: \n. This is now resolved in dev branch.\n. Aside from quite a few local changes we've made to Pixi 2 I'm curious how many things would this add back in that we don't ever use? (resource loader? event handling? filters? etc?) - I know if Phaser was properly modular it could chose not to use them, but that isn't happening in v2s lifetime.\n.

Good catch, thanks (shows how often people use Rope!)\n. Hmm this is a Cordova specific issue. I'm reluctant to add hacks into the core specific for this case. However it's well worth adding into the docs, so I'll do that now.\n. Actually what the heck, it's in there.\n. This is by design I'm afraid - addPolygon is literally just an interface to the P2 method fromPolygon, so everything that this method expects you to handle on your own (such as adjusting the center of mass) you still need to do. However I've updated loadPolygon to make it more flexible, so you can now pass the actual data in directly rather than pull it from the cache, which should help matters out.\n. https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/issues/1702\n. https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/issues/1702\n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n.

Just check out the dev branch from github and run grunt to build it.\n. Close this one off as it definitely works properly now :) New updated example is in the repo too.\n. Excellent, thank you.\n. I can't see anything wrong with the way this works currently, all tests seem fine here:\n```\nvar game = new Phaser.Game(800, 600, Phaser.CANVAS, 'phaser-example', { preload: preload, create: create, update: update, render: render });\nvar parent;\nvar child;\nfunction preload() {\ngame.load.image('mushroom', 'assets/sprites/mushroom2.png');\ngame.load.spritesheet('mummy', 'assets/sprites/metalslug_mummy37x45.png', 37, 45, 18);\n\n}\nfunction create() {\nparent = game.add.sprite(100, 100, 'mushroom');\n\nparent.addChild(game.make.sprite(-50, -50, 'mummy'));\nparent.addChild(game.make.sprite(100, 0, 'mummy'));\nparent.addChild(game.make.sprite(200, 200, 'mummy'));\n\n//  This child will move faster because its position is updated as well as the parent\nchild = parent.addChild(game.make.sprite(0, 100, 'mummy'));\n\n}\nfunction update() {\nparent.x += 0.1;\nchild.x += 0.1;\n\n}\nfunction render() {\ngame.debug.text(parent.width, 32, 32);\ngame.debug.geom(parent.getBounds());\n\n}\n```\n.

You should really be scaling the game canvas itself, not the world, as arcade physics won't handle that at all.

You should really be scaling the game canvas itself, not the world, as arcade physics won't handle that at all. It might be worth looking at the Cocoon phaser template to see how they handle screen sizing.\n. Phaser uses Pixi directly for WebGL rendering of Tiling Sprites, there's no intermediate step, so no \"performance\" to be worked on. Pixi 3 uses a shader to render tile sprites, Pixi 2 used a canvas generated texture, make sure you're comparing both exactly as is.\n. I don't think it's a problem with the parser but it's easy enough for you to confirm - just call TilemapParser.parseTiledJSON() directly and give it the json data of your tilemap. Look at the object that comes back. Are the x/y values set or undefined?\nLooking at the snippet of map data above it doesn't look correctly formatted, or an old version of Tiled perhaps? I'm not seeing gid properties or any of the identifiers you'd usually expect. However only you can tell as you're the one with the full json file - so throw it through the full parser (make sure you test the dev branch to be current) and see what happens.\n.

In theory it shouldn't have mattered if the browser lagged, as Game will run multiple logic updates to catch-up with itself. But there is a cap on the quantity it can do, and sometimes it just isn't enough - so Tweens will now use their own internal delta timer value to ensure that they complete within the duration specified, no matter what happens to the browser. It means they're at the mercy of browser stutters visually though, but that's probably a safe price to pay.\n. This is now fixed in the dev branch (the Tween issue anyway).

Works fine here in 2.4-dev branch and also here http://phaser.io/examples/v2/text/text-stroke so need more to go on.\n. Definitely a strange one - this may well be fixed in Pixi 3 as they no longer use the PolyK library (what do you reckon @englercj ?) but I will update the Phaser docs in the meantime.\n. Thought so, I've added it to the docs and will close this one off.\n. Thanks, both fixed.\n. Text alignment is within the bounds of the texture itself. If it wasn't what would it actually align to? The screen? The world? It's parent container? So many options, none any more correct than each other.\n. That's a much nicer idea (defining the bounds for the Text object itself), as this could map to the underlying canvas dimensions. Then if you specify a wordwrap too long or whatever it's entirely your own problem really :)\n. Ok this is all done and in the dev branch. Am quite happy with how it turned out actually!\n. Nice :+1: \n. Wow, that's quite some work here! I'll merge it and start testing with 2.4 later today, but it sounds great from what I've read above, so thank you.\n. It's probably just broken because I had to add in 2 new modules to the build task, nothing else changed there (I literally just added in the rope and tilesprite modules). I'm still interested in merging this, but it was just too much to take on for the 2.4 release.\n. :+1: \n. The link is 2 years old, things move. More importantly though the defs are correct:\nhttps://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/master/v2/typescript/phaser.d.ts#L1807-L1808. In order to keep the Github issues clear this feature request has been moved to the Phaser 3 wishlist.\n. Can't help without seeing the code. Issues like this are best posted to our forum.\n. :+1: \n. The TilemapParser extracts each object from the Tiled json and inserts it into an array:\nobjects[json.layers[i].name] = []; (line 439)\ngetObjectIndex searches that local array for the object, not the original json data itself.\nUnless you've got a json file that breaks this approach?\n. https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/issues/1802 https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/issues/1702\n.

Thanks for the notification. We don't PR against master, but I've updated this in dev.\n. Yes we've simply been too busy for this or the Coding Tips one either.\nI need to consolidate them into one I think, and see if we can't automate some of the content (i.e. pull in latest news from our news feed). They just take up too much time to produce right now.\n. Going to close this off as I want repo issues to focus on the library itself really. But rest assured, we'll sort something out in this area soon.\n. This is now fixed in dev.\n. Thanks for the heads-up but this is already fixed in the dev branch.\n. Looks good to me!\n. A window.resize event has to occur in order for the Camera (or World) size to update like that. It's entirely possible (although worth testing) that this doesn't happen with dialog boxes and the such like, as the window itself didn't technically change size. If using a RESIZE scale mode then you should be able to tell if the State resize function gets called or not in those cases, and if not then that's the reason. If it does get called, then it needs looking in to further, so a code test case will be required.\n. A window.resize event has to occur in order for the Camera (or World) size to update like that. It's entirely possible (although worth testing) that this doesn't happen with dialog boxes and the such like, as the window itself didn't technically change size.

QuadTree.retrieve needs either a Sprite or a Rectangle object to work against.\nHere's a full test that shows how it works without using any sprites, just pure geometry:\n```\nvar game = new Phaser.Game(800, 600, Phaser.CANVAS, 'phaser-example', { create: create, update: update, render: render });\nvar marker;\nvar quadTree;\nvar rects = [];\nfunction create() {\nquadTree = new Phaser.QuadTree(0, 0, 800, 600, 10, 4, 0);\n\nfor (var i = 0; i < 48; i++)\n{\n    var x = game.world.randomX;\n    var y = game.world.randomY;\n\n    if (x > 760)\n    {\n        x = 760;\n    }\n\n    if (y > 560)\n    {\n        y = 560;\n    }\n\n    var rect = new Phaser.Rectangle(x, y, 32, 32);\n    rect.id = i;\n    rect.flagged = false;\n    rects.push(rect);\n    quadTree.insert(rect);\n}\n\nmarker = new Phaser.Rectangle(0, 0, 128, 128);\n\ngame.input.onDown.add(retrieve, this);\n\n}\nfunction retrieve() {\nfor (var i = 0; i < rects.length; i++)\n{\n    rects[i].flagged = false;\n}\n\nvar found = quadTree.retrieve(marker);\n\nconsole.log(found);\n\nfor (var i = 0; i < found.length; i++)\n{\n    found[i].flagged = true;\n}\n\n}\nfunction update() {\nmarker.x = game.input.x;\nmarker.y = game.input.y;\n\n}\nfunction render() {\ngame.debug.quadTree(quadTree);\n\nfor (var i = 0; i < rects.length; i++)\n{\n    if (rects[i].flagged)\n    {\n        game.debug.geom(rects[i], '#ff0000');\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        game.debug.geom(rects[i]);\n    }\n\n    game.debug.text(rects[i].id, rects[i].x + 4, rects[i].y + 16);\n}\n\ngame.debug.geom(marker, '#00bff3', false);\n\n}\n```\n.

There are lots of examples that only work in WebGL mode, or only work in Canvas mode - there are equally a large number that include debug text output, which in WebGL mode really slows things down but should never be used in a live game anyway. So in short, I'm going to keep them as-is, most of them have the optimum setting for what they're trying to show. None should be taken \"wholesale\" as the only want to do something. Yes it's possible in some of the examples that IE11 will outperform (or under perform) against another browser, but it's just an example - they're meant for taking, tweaking and learning from, not dumping directly into a game.\n.

This is unsupported. Modifying properties directly doesn't inform the parent object that it's now dirty and needs re-rendering, so breaks.\n. Unless you can find some code that is causing this I'm going to chalk it up to some browser / hardware / OS combo weirdness. All Phaser does is read from the gamepad API and report back what is attached, so it's the gamepad API that is getting confused here. Hopefully in the months that have passed since you reported this, they've fixed it.\n. Could you post an actual example please, because I can't replicate this with the animations found in the examples repo.\n. I still can't replicate this. Here is an example I tested, the log for me perfectly shows 1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5 etc without dropping any frames.

Your first fiddle doesn't work because you're never telling the BitmapData to update its WebGL texture. You can't just modify the underlying context directly and expect that to be reflected in WebGl, it needs to know to create a new texture from it and re-apply it to the Sprite. Do that by setting the 'dirty' flag and then calling render:\nbmd.dirty = true;\n        bmd.render();\nAnd in the 2nd fiddle your sprite events don't work because you've not enabled the sprite for input. Add this: sprite.inputEnabled = true; and it works just fine.\nGoing to close this off as neither are actual issues with Phaser.\n.

Yeah don't worry, I'll sort it out tomorrow when I put up the new release candidate for test.\n. Hmm first time anyone has ever reported this! So I'm guessing it's not that common. However it should work, so the recent changes I've just made to the dev branch should cover it.\n. :+1: \n. The way in which mouse move callbacks work hasn't changed in 2.4 - they are still dispatched when the actual DOM event triggers them, not in sync with the update loop, and button handlers are the same - they're executed with the DOM event, out of the update loop. So I'll need a code example to demonstrate what's happening specifically for you.\n. Ok just to say this is working properly now with RC2.

Have checked this out and it looks fine to me. However I did just update it so that isDown/isUp are now accurate based on the state of ANY button on the device.\n. It never actually did it properly though! So to avoid any confusion I have removed the properties entirely and updated the jsdocs to explain what you should actually be using now (pointer.leftButton, etc)\n. pointer.event.button - but there is no guarantee the event is fired because just one button went up, so never rely on it (it's why the 2.3 implementation is completely wrong, as it relied on that dom event property for everything, when it should really have been using the buttons bitmask instead).\n. All of the Pointer booleans (leftButton, etc) have been replaced with the new DeviceButton class. These objects have their own signals (onDown, onUp), isDown, isUp, duration properties and things like justReleased.\nThey are always updated before any of the Pointer signals are dispatched.\nSo you can now easily check the state of a specific button in a global onInputUp event.\nWhat I'm now considering is that Pointer.stop shouldn't be processed at all if ANY of the buttons are still down. For example it sets things like the timeUp value, etc - but it's misleading imho. I do think those properties probably ought to move to the DeviceButton class itself.\n.

I've seen plenty of Cordova wrapped Phaser games with audio, so whatever is causing this is specific to your implementation rather than Phaser itself. More details needed.\n. Lovely, thank you.\n. Lovely, thank you.\n. Updated in dev.\n. Sorry for the time it took to respond to this. Just finished looking at it, and the problem is the plugin works by adjusting the Sprite.x and y values directly - the problem being they are local coordinates, relative to the parent Group, but the Body is always positioned and manipulated in world coordinates. I'm afraid the only way around this is to keep your Groups at 0,0, or don't put Box2D sprites inside of non-world aligned Groups.\n. Sorry for the time it took to respond to this.

In this instance the expected course of action is that you should overwrite the Physics Manager with your own custom system. As long as it has the expected entry points it will be perfectly happy with that. As all physics bodies are created through it you can easily replace the enableBody calls to do whatever you need.\n. While I agree with most of this, to a degree (I've no intention of splitting up the code base), none of it is relevant to Phaser 2 I'm afraid and is already covered by the plans in place for Phaser 3. I need to keep the issues here as clean and focused as possible, so further discussion can be taken up on the forum if you wish.\n. If you view source on the alphavid page you'll see that they draw the video to a canvas, then process every single pixel of the canvas extracting  a colour value and drawing it out again. This is an incredibly expensive way of supporting alpha - it's also why they use such a tiny video file for the demonstration. \nEven so, to replicate it just use a BitmapData and essentially exactly the same code as they're using, using the BitmapData's context to draw to instead.\n. Well spotted :)\n. Lovely, thanks.\n. Good catch - should be fine now.\n. Thanks, I try to keep them update but obviously missed a load!\n. Thanks - this is now working again, but I'm refactoring it slightly to deal with better button handling.\n. It's not the image that needs smoothing disabled, it's the BitmapData.\n. The first one is an old link, maybe from Google, but it doesn't come from our site. Probably left over from the old docs site structure. I'll add a redirect in for it.\n. Done. The site now redirects accordingly. If the file doesn't exist then you get the index page, otherwise it takes the latest docs version.\n. @nisimjoseph could you just paste the fix up here? I doubt it's that large?\n. Closing this one off as it's now (finally) fixed in dev.\n. @yeluoqiuzhi you need to open the issue on the Phaser CE repo (with a test case). 2.4 uses an almost identical Pixi bundle as 2.3 does, it just has a couple less files in it that have moved into Phaser fully (like PIXI.Text) and some internal bug fixes, but is otherwise the same. So whatever you were doing for 2.3 should, theoretically, carry on with 2.4 in the same way.\nThere are no plans to change Phaser 2 to use requireJS at all, structurally Phaser 2 is now fully locked - all changes like this are for Phaser 3 only.\n. Yes I'd be happy to merge that in.\n. Thanks - would you mind sending me a tiny example of how you'd include Phaser using require now so I can update the resources folder. Just the html file will do - doesn't matter what the 'game' does, even if it just loads a single image that will be enough.\n. I guess because it's from your same branch as the earlier PR - anyway it looks safe to me, so will merge now - thanks!\n. Could you please test this against the dev branch. I've been working on a fix for it in there, and my tests are now all passing (including your test code above) but I'd like if you could confirm please.\n. Please give this a go - it should be fine now as the texture is cleared before render.\n. Arse, ok will take a look. It works fine 'unbuilt' so it must have been a change to the build script I did earlier.\n. Ok the new release up on master (2.4.0a) has this fix in place. It will take a while longer before it hits npm, but just pull from master or download from the new release I posted and all will be fine.\nTo double check make sure the console outputs 2.4.0a, not 2.4.0.\n. Read the readme. It explains what to do.\n. :+1: \n. What's an OGV file? Is it just an OGG with a different extension, or something else?\n. Ok thanks for the heads up and kinds words, I'll add ogv as a valid video extension to check for!\n. This has now been added to the dev branch - thanks for the suggestion.\n. :+1: \n. So would I.\nThe difference is that the Creature authors were incredibly helpful, provided us with custom libraries, easy integration, listened to our feedback and helped get things working with the minimum of fuss.\nUntil Spine is fully supported by Pixi 2 (which will never happen imho) I can't see this situation changing in the immediate future. For Phaser 3 we'll revisit it and it's already on the list.\n. TilemapLayers are essentially Sprites, so you detect input in the same way:\nlayer.inputEnabled = true;\nlayer.events.onInputDown.add(func, this);\n. Try it with the version of Phaser in the dev branch, as it works fine for me now.\n. Can you test this against 2.4.1 please, as they seem to be working fine for me, but there were definitely issues in some browsers with click events on 2.4.0.\n. Must be Linux specific. Works fine in Firefox 38, 39 and 41 on Windows and OS X.\nIn which case I need you to do this please: edit Pointer.start and at the top log out the event, build it and post the results up here. I don't have Linux running anywhere, but I'm surprised it doesn't include the buttons property. Actually you could probably get it by just logging out game.input.mouse.event after clicking.\n. Ok so that's weird - it's nothing to do with the mouse event itself then? and I can see you've got a buttons property too - so it much be the touchedHandler check itself that is failing? (even though I've barely touched that for ages)\n. Could you all please try the latest build in the dev branch. I've uploaded build files as well for you. But I am pretty sure I've found the cause of it and in my tests in native Cordova apps and on Windows and OSX it's working correctly once again.\n. This is now fixed in dev (thanks to the new padding parameter)\n. :+1: \n. hasFrameData doesn't have a cache parameter and it says in the docs specifically that it only checks the Image cache, so I don't believe this is an error here - however I do agree it's a useful feature, so I've added it in.\n. I have a build script specifically for browserify, I'll publish it next week along with the ones I've made for systemjs and requirejs. Until then load it as a global.\n. You need to use the --split true option when making a custom build. This will split all of the libs out (phaser, pixi, p2 and creature) to their own independently UMD wrapped files. These should then be required as needed, each allowed to populate the global space. Pixi should come before Phaser.\nThere is not, and will not, be a 'single' file version of Phaser that works with browserify.\n. Thanks for the error report. This is now fixed in the dev branch :)\n. Thank you for opening this issue and the video. However this will not be addressed in Phaser, so I'm moving this over to the Lazer feature request list instead. If you wish to submit a PR that isn't massively API breaking and fixes this feature to Phaser then we will consider merging it.\n. Putting down as feature-request, because moving to earcut would solve this.\n. I've replaced PolyK with EarCut and this now works properly in dev branch.\n. The first thing PIXI.RenderTexture.prototype.renderWebGL does is to flip the display object, because they come in upside down. Evidently Graphics objects don't suffer from this - so instead of renderXY use render instead and provide your own matrix that counters the automatic flip.\n. I've swapped to using EarCut internally.\nIt doesn't solve this problem (with the fills being reversed), but if you cache the Graphics as a Bitmap first it works fine:\ngraphics.cacheAsBitmap = true;\nAnd then the RenderTexture appears as it should do.\n. Could you all please try the latest build in the dev branch. I've uploaded build files as well for you. But I am pretty sure I've found the cause of it and in my tests in native Cordova apps and on Windows and OSX it's working correctly once again.\n. Pretty sure this is fine now. Firefox on Windows and OSX for me is working with the latest dev build. Here's the test I was using:\n```\nvar game = new Phaser.Game(800, 600, Phaser.CANVAS, 'phaser-example', { preload: preload, create: create, render: render });\nfunction preload() {\ngame.load.image('mouse', 'assets/sprites/mouse_jim_sachs.png');\n\n}\nfunction create() {\ngame.stage.backgroundColor = '#943021';\n\ngame.add.sprite(0, 100, 'mouse');\n\ngame.input.mouse.capture = true;\n\n}\nfunction render() {\ngame.debug.text(\"Left Button: \" + game.input.activePointer.leftButton.isDown, 300, 132);\ngame.debug.text(\"Middle Button: \" + game.input.activePointer.middleButton.isDown, 300, 196);\ngame.debug.text(\"Right Button: \" + game.input.activePointer.rightButton.isDown, 300, 260);\n\ngame.debug.text(\"Active Pointer: \" + game.input.activePointer.isDown, 300, 360);\n\n}\n```\n. Could you all please try the latest build in the dev branch. I've uploaded build files as well for you. But I am pretty sure I've found the cause of it and in my tests in native Cordova apps and on Windows and OSX it's working correctly once again.\n. I believe this was caused because you didn't correctly destroy any Phaser.Sound instances that relied on the cached audio file before calling removeSound. I've added in a small guard to protect against this in the dev branch, but it should still be dealt with correctly in the game code imho.\n. This is now fixed in dev.\n. Thank you for taking the time to open this issue. However, official support for Phaser 2 has now ended as we focus on preparing Phaser 3 for beta release. In a bid to keep the project tidy, and avoid confusion, we are closing all v2 related issues.\nThis does not mean your issue won't be looked-at. In November 2016 the Phaser CE (Community Edition) project began. The aim of Phaser CE was to allow the community to continue v2 development. Since then it has gained significant traction, with many updates and releases.\nIf you are still interested in having your issue investigated we strongly recommend testing the latest Phaser CE release. And only if the problem persists, opening an issue on the Phaser CE repo.\n. It should only be added to the cache when the image has loaded. In Chrome this is immediately, in Safari it's not. The following from Loader.loadImageTag shows how it should be set-up:\n```\n        file.data = new Image();\n        file.data.name = file.key;\n    if (this.crossOrigin)\n    {\n        file.data.crossOrigin = this.crossOrigin;\n    }\n\n    file.data.onload = function () {\n        if (file.data.onload)\n        {\n            file.data.onload = null;\n            file.data.onerror = null;\n            _this.fileComplete(file);\n        }\n    };\n\n    file.data.onerror = function () {\n        if (file.data.onload)\n        {\n            file.data.onload = null;\n            file.data.onerror = null;\n            _this.fileError(file);\n        }\n    };\n\n    file.data.src = this.transformUrl(file.url, file);\n\n    // Image is immediately-available/cached\n    if (file.data.complete && file.data.width && file.data.height)\n    {\n        file.data.onload = null;\n        file.data.onerror = null;\n        this.fileComplete(file);\n    }\n\n```\nThe problem in Safari is that at the point you add the image to the cache it isn't a fully formed Image object, so has no dimensions, so Phaser cannot create any FrameData for it.\n. Thanks, this is now fixed on the site.\n. :+1: \n. I run a Macbook Pro all day without it overheating, so perhaps this is model specific. I only use Chrome though, not Safari.\nPhaser runs using request animation frame - this sets the redraw rate. What you could do is force it to use setTimeout instead (there is a game config property to do this) and then the fps rate you set will directly influence the quantity of times render is called, which may help.\n. Closing this off as the discussion appears to be over, with several options presented in the thread.\n. Actually I think it's directly related to this: https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/commit/9362a2b1f480ef570c2a5a05e2fceec03e169262\n. This is now fixed in a dev - and didn't require anything as intense as any of the suggestions above thankfully :)\n. This is fixed in dev.\n. I don't really think it's worth merging WebFontLoader into Phaser anywhere. Using it as it stands now is pretty trivial really, and the WebFontLoader code base is massive and frequently updated, almost daily - not something I'd want to have to keep on-top of.\n. Yes the way it was previously bundled was completely wrong - PIXI should never have been inside the Phaser UMD, so it's now properly split out. The grunt custom build task has a new flag --split true which will generate Phaser, Pixi, P2 and Creature to their own stand-alone build files, each with the wrappers they need. So you can now bundle them together however you want. As long as they're allowed to exist globally they will be much happier. PIXI needs to come before Phaser in any requirement chain.\n. Just to say that I've got a guide to setting up Phaser with Webpack which I'll publish shortly.\nI'd just like to add one thing though: don't ever use any version of Pixi that you find in npm with Phaser, as it won't work. You have to use the version we've built specifically or so much will break.\np2 on the other hand should be safe to pull in from npm instead of the build included with Phaser as long as you use the exact same version that Phaser bundles with it, any deviation from that is highly likely to break it.\n. The PIXI source in the Phaser repo is vastly different to the last published version of Pixi 2. We've added and fixed so much that isn't in the official repo it's not even close any more.\n. Here's how to use Phaser with Webpack:\n1) You have to use a custom build of Phaser. You cannot use one of the builds from the dist folder. Here is the grunt custom task I used:\ngrunt custom --exclude p2,creature,ninja --split true\nThis will create phaser.js and pixi.js files in the dist folder. Copy those over to your project folder.\n2) In Webpack you need to install the script-loader:\nnpm install script-loader --save-dev\n3) In your webpack.config.js flag Phaser and Pixi to use the script loader. There are various ways of doing this, but I used this approach:\n```\nmodule.exports = {\nentry: \"./src/entry.js\",\n\noutput: {\n    path: __dirname,\n    filename: \"bundle.js\"\n},\n\nmodule: {\n    loaders: [\n        { test: /pixi.js/, loader: \"script\" },\n        { test: /phaser.js/, loader: \"script\" }\n    ]\n}\n\n};\n```\n4) In my entry.js I just have this:\nrequire('../lib/pixi.js');\nrequire('../lib/phaser.js');\nrequire('./main.js');\nmain.js contains my test game, which is just a basic Phaser example.\n5) Then build it.\nUsing the split Phaser / PIXI libs and the Webpack script loader I was able to bundle my game up quite happily without any changes to the core Phaser source.\n. Check you followed the instructions above exactly as written. If it still doesn't work post your project structure and conf file up.\n. I'll leave it for now until I've moved the above instructions somewhere more public.\n. > None of these are solutions, just leaking bandages. Phaser must evolve accordingly to maintain relevance in an ES6 world. If jQuery can do it, so can Phaser.\nThat is what Lazer is for. I have no intention of ever making that change to Phaser, it's too close to end-of-life to be worth the effort.\nGiven 2.4.5 now has a webpack build option built in, and the README updated to reflect that I'm going to close this issue off now.\n. @ElegantSudo the issue here (in this thread) isn't to do with not being ES6, it's to do with Phaser being one giant global single var, with no module capability at all, with dependencies to other global based libs. Which makes it a pain to ingest in a module based workflow. Which is why Phaser 3 is fully modular, and itself built with webpack2. The code is still ES5, the module format CJS, but it should make threads like this a thing of the past. ES6 will follow, but first the module based version needs completing. One leads to the other.. Not sure if you're talking about Phaser 2 or 3, but it sounds too large in either case unless it's including the source map and comments, in which case it sounds about right. Exclude those and it should be significantly smaller. In Phaser 2 you cannot separate the modules out on their own, in V3 you can.. Fixed in 1.0.3.\n. If you don't call BitmapData.update after manipulating it, it won't update the imageData property. This isn't done automatically because it's expensive, so you have to call it yourself.\n. Like this you mean?\nvar data = JSON.parse(yourObject);\nthis.cache.addJSON('yourKey', null, data);\n. Hmm but you can already do this!\nWhat exactly would 'game.add.json' do btw? In your example above it works right now by doing this:\ngame.load.json('leveldata', 'assets/data.json');\n..\nvar data = game.cache.getJSON('leveldata');\n. Thanks for the PR - glad you did it against the dev branch too! However the doc files are automatically generated by jsdoc, so edits to html files are nuked when I next export the docs. To change docs you need to edit the jsdoc blocks in the source code itself. Then nothing gets lost.\n. This feature is now available in the dev branch.\n. Just to explain - set the value before creating your Tilemap.\n. Hi - Thanks for the PR, but a couple of points: 1) All PRs against the dev branch, not master. And 2) The docs are automatically generated from the jsdoc blocks inside the source code, so don't edit html files or they get nuked when I next export the docs. Instead edit the jsdocs in the source code.\nAlso the comment is 100% correct :) I should have been more specific in my original reply to you: If you want to access the imageData immediately after drawing then you need to call update. However if you can wait for a single game loop to complete then it will automatically get updated. Drawing to a BitmapData flags the texture as being dirty, when a Sprite that uses a BitmapData as a texture is updated it sees the dirty flag and runs update on it. So it's a bit of a mixture what happens when, and when you need it.\n. :+1: \n. Much better, thanks. You've still got an edit to an html file in this PR, but I'll merge anyway, it will just get wiped when I next rebuild.\n. Yes sorry about this, I'm not sure of the best way to address it though. How should it wrap words without spaces? I can't pick a number of characters, because that could chop a word entirely in two - what should be done?\n. Closing as it's a duplicate of #1403 \n. Glad you solved it. Am closing this one off as the docs definitely say to give a number not a string.\n. There you go - added back in just for you :)\n. Welcome to the inaccuracy that is the HTML5 Canvas Context measureText function. If you'd like to fix the way web browsers handle this then your text will suddenly and magically be perfectly centred! :)\n. Sorry I wasn't too clear - the discrepancy comes from the values measureText returns. Nothing changed in the way the Text width is calculated in Phaser 2.4, but that doesn't mean Chrome etc didn't tweak it slightly internally. Who knows.\n. I did think that it could use a pixel scan method - i.e. you create a canvas that's a bit too wide, draw the text to it, then scan every line to find out the furthest most pixel. Then it could resize the canvas and re-render the text so it would be perfect. This would account for the way different OSs and different browsers render fonts differently - but it'd be an insanely expensive operation too. Can't win them all :(\n. This is now merged into dev.\n. I can't replicate this. The example below works fine. What is different about your version to throw this?\n```\nvar game = new Phaser.Game(800, 600, Phaser.AUTO, 'phaser-example', { preload: preload, create: create });\nvar emitter;\nfunction preload() {\ngame.load.image('diamond', 'assets/sprites/diamond.png');\n\n}\nfunction create() {\ngame.physics.startSystem(Phaser.Physics.ARCADE);\n\ngame.stage.backgroundColor = 0x337799;\n\nemitter = game.add.emitter(0, 0, 100);\n\nemitter.makeParticles('diamond');\nemitter.gravity = 200;\n\ngame.input.onDown.addOnce(particleBurst, this);\n\n}\nfunction particleBurst(pointer) {\nemitter.x = pointer.x;\nemitter.y = pointer.y;\n\nemitter.start(true, 4000, null, 10);\n\n//  And 2 seconds later we'll destroy the emitter\ngame.time.events.add(2000, destroyEmitter, this);\n\n}\nfunction destroyEmitter() {\nemitter.destroy();\n\n}\n``\n. I'm going to have to revert this merge because it completely breaks the game size on Retina screens when not in full-screen mode. The game size is being halved in all cases, which isn't right.\n. Interesting. A filtered sprite should completely ignore the blend mode, rather than become invisible.\n. Ok this is patched one-way in the dev branch now (i.e. if you set a filter on a sprite that has a blend mode, it will disable the blend mode). However it's still possible to mess it up the other way around (setting a blend mode after enabling a filter). The docs now warn about this though.\n. Fair enough, have updated to remove multiply.\n. Thank you for the suggestion. However this will not be implemented in Phaser, so I'm moving this request over to the Lazer feature request list instead. If you wish to submit a PR that isn't massively API breaking and that adds this feature to Phaser then we will consider merging it.\n. Thanks for this. Please don't edit the TS Comments defs directly though - as they are automatically generated by the build process, so all manual edits are overwritten.\n. :+1: \n. Try out the dev branch, you should find this covered now.\n. Thanks for this. I've merged (and fixed) your change locally (as you were using a globalgame` var which needed replacing).\n. This is already fixed in the dev branch. Here's a test case from the phaser examples:\n```\nvar game = new Phaser.Game(800, 600, Phaser.CANVAS, 'phaser-example', this);\nfunction preload() {\ngame.load.image('TheEnd', 'assets/pics/TheEnd_by_Iloe_and_Made.jpg');\ngame.load.image('BountyHunter', 'assets/pics/Bounty_Hunter_by_Anathematixs_Desire.png');\n\n}\nvar pic;\nfunction create() {\npic = game.add.sprite(game.world.centerX, game.world.centerY, 'TheEnd');\npic.alpha = 0.5;\npic.anchor.set(0.5);\npic.scale.set(0.6);\n\ngame.add.text(16, 16, \"tap or double-tap the image\", { font: \"32px Arial\", fill: \"#ffffff\" });\n\ngame.input.onTap.add(onTap, this);\n\n}\nfunction onTap(pointer, doubleTap) {\nif (doubleTap)\n{\n    //  They double-tapped, so swap the image\n    if (pic.key === 'TheEnd')\n    {\n        pic.loadTexture('BountyHunter');\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        pic.loadTexture('TheEnd');\n    }\n}\nelse\n{\n    //  A single tap (tap duration was < game.input.tapRate) so change alpha\n    pic.alpha = (pic.alpha === 0.5) ? 1 : 0.5;\n}\n\n}\n``\n. Thanks for the PR but this is already fixed in the dev branch (also, all PRs should be against dev).\n. It would update the mass and set it to 1, but only if the mass was zero. Anything else would ignore it. It now automatically sets the mass to 1 every time, no matter what value it was before.\n. Hmm yeah it probably should be flagged as a desktop, although it doesn't actually make any difference to Phaser internally (the value is there for your use, not Phasers).\n. Thank you for the suggestion. However this will not be implemented in Phaser, so I'm moving this request over to the Lazer feature request list instead. If you wish to submit a PR that isn't massively API breaking and that adds this feature to Phaser then we will consider merging it.\n. I need source code really, as I'm not sure if you're reporting a Box2D plugin error or a game scaling error.\n. You might have better luck asking about this on the forum to be honest.\n.

Feel free to submit a PR if you feel you can resolve it in a clean and API friendly way.\n. Thanks for this - no PRs against master though, but I've fixed it in dev.\n. Going to close this issue unless @ViliX64 can confirm it's different to #1955 \n. Yup good call - have fixed that method up and optimised it quite a bit now too.\n. Please test it - I've only got a couple of test cases here I can use and there are so many versions of Tiled out there, outputting all kinds of files it would be good to get more coverage.\n. Ok great. I'll be pushing it out this week.\n. Can't merge because it's against master, but fixed in dev anyway, thanks!\n. Hmm the link doesn't 404 for me at all - it just goes to the Koding home page, yes, but not a 404.\n. I've updated the readme to reflect this.\n. Yup that's a good idea. Done.\n.

I know this is months old now, but I'd love to see this in ES6 in Lazer, rather than padding out Phaser, if you ever get a whim to do such a thing :)\n. Actually I don't think it's possible to implement at all. Strokes on Text elements are handled by the Canvas API itself, and they certainly have no support for multi-strokes in there. Which means it would need coding specifically, and is never going to look as good as Photoshop can manage it.\n. You can use a drop shadow and a stroke together, which with the right settings allows for a double layer outline at least - but it's never as precise or smooth as the images posted above.\n. I'm going to close this off. It's not a feature I think is vital enough to include in the core, and looks like it can be resolved with a little creative coding re: above.\n. :+1: \n.

Closing as this is handled in the phaser-examples repo.\n. This needs testing against 2.4.4 really. 2.2 is too old to be considered a useful benchmark any longer. There was also a significant version upgrade of Pixi between 2.1.3 and 2.2.\n. I appreciate the time taken to open this issue but I'm afraid I'm closing it. I sadly cannot spend time looking at issues that are differences between vast spans of Phaser and Pixi versions. If the issue is an actual bug then I've something to focus on, but alas this isn't the case here.\n. No because it's not a fair issue to open for Pixi either, and they are 2 major versions ahead of the one that Phaser 2.1.3 was using so wouldn't look at it anyway.\nUnderstand it from our point of view - there's nothing here to debug, nothing isolated, just a sprawling game. It could take us days to boil that down into something actionable. If it runs better in an earlier version, use the earlier version.\n. Yes of course.\n. And it doesn't even have to be 15 lines... 100 lines of code is fine, what is important is that it's an isolated case with as minimum of extra fluff as possible. Just what is needed to demonstrate the issue.\n. I'll take a look at this. Also I'd be interested to know if the new Phaser 2.5 + Pixi 3 build makes a difference to you (available here: https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/pixi3/build)\n. Have tested this under Phaser 2.4.5 and 2.5 with Pixi v3 and in both cases, in Canvas and WebGL mode, I can leave it scrolling indefinitely with no slow-down. I set it up to auto-scroll and left it going for 2 minutes in each case. I do get periodic stuttering, but I'd expect that because of what's going on under the hood (see below) and the fact it's being scrolled with no delta smoothing, so lags as gc sweeps will be exaggerated.\nSome observations:\nThe texture is insanely huge. It has to create a Canvas Tile Pattern from this massive image, then fill in a 1280 x 720 area with it, every single frame. So up to 60 times per second. That's a lot of pixels to be pushing, even for gaming grade hardware.\nEqually the gc will kick in because it has to erase all those thousands of tile patterns that are being created and then no longer used. This will absolutely result in frame stutters every time the gc sweeps (on my Mac that's approximately every 20 seconds looking at it).\nIn WebGL mode it doesn't have to do this, but the texture is so large it may not even fit into low-end GPU texture memory anyway, forcing it out to software and instantly slowing it down as it thrashes memory.\nFrankly I'm amazed even Phaser 2.1.3 managed this - but what I think you're seeing there is the old 'no delta timer' method of the frame update loop running, which you can emulate under 2.4 via game.forceSingleUpdate = true.\n. Are you loading a video? The only reason that message could appear is if the Phaser Loader tries to load a video file.\n. One of your files, I have no idea which as I can't see them, is being treated as a video. There is only one place in the Loader that createElement('video') is called and that's in loadVideoTag. I need to see your code running somewhere to debug this any further.\n. Either that, or you're running under some kind of special wrapper (Cocoon?) or browser that scans the Phaser source and throws a warning about things it doesn't support.\nYou won't see this in 2.3 because we didn't support videos at all in 2.3.\n. I reckon this is just Cocoon mis-diagnosing the Device class. If you're not using Video, then don't worry.\n. The issue is two fold:\nFirst of all the problem is created by the use of scale in the example, not the line width itself. If you just set scale(50) on the Graphics element you'll still see the same result.\nThe cause is that PIXI.WebGLGraphics.buildLine checks to see if the line width is an odd value, and adds 0.5 to it in order to round it to a whole pixel. Usually you don't notice this sub-pixel adjustment, but in your case because the whole thing has been scaled x50 it multiplies the effect dramatically.\nI'm not willing to modify Pixi to adjust the way it works, so am chalking this one up to a Pixi anomaly at super-high scale factors.\n. Thanks for submitting this issue. We have fixed this, and the fix has been pushed to the dev branch.\n. Thanks for this. In future please don't bother changing the html files, as they are automatically generated when we do a new docs build. Only the source files need fixing.\n. Hmm let me check this with Mat first. It's a tiny change, but one of those things that could have catastrophic effects elsewhere :)\n. Discussed it over with him and we feel it should be a relatively safe change, so have made it and will test for 2.4.4 RC1.\n. Closing this issue as the fix is merged into dev.\n. I tried all of those that you listed against 2.4.1 and 2.4.4 and they all collided just fine, with the exception of the bitmapdata one, and the collision in that works, it's the put tile part that is broken in the example. So more information needed.\n. Ah that's because the version of 2.4.3 on the examples site is a dev build and hasn't been replaced yet. Equally the version switcher doesn't work (you'll notice it never actually loads the previous versions, it just tries again with 2.4.3-dev).\nRun the examples locally and it works fine in all versions. I appreciate it's not great that they are broken on the examples site, but the actual Phaser builds are solid, as is the example code. I'll sort the site out when we release 2.4.4.\n. A 'fixed' Sprite can collide with another sprite ok, but not with a Tilemap.\n. This example runs fine under 2.4.4-dev in WebGL (as do the other Render Texture examples) so I'm going to close this one off. I'll upload a new 2.4.4 build file later on today, so feel free to check your own code against that when it's uploaded.\n. The version of Pixi included in Phaser should be patched directly. It is so modified from the official Pixi build that you can no longer merge from any Pixi version directly into Phaser. The more I work through the Pixi source the more I will be changing it in the months to come as well.\n. Thanks for the PR but we only merge PRs against the dev branch.\n. Why not, makes sense and will tidy up the docs.\n. Hmm if that's the case I'm not sure of any fix for it.\n. Given the fix for this is now merged with webkit I'm wondering what the next best course of action is.\nThey may well revert to 'touchend' again at a later date, but assuming the fix lands in iOS shortly we're in the wonderful grey area of \"all versions of iOS can use touchstart, except these two specific versions of iOS9\", which is a hell of a mess. Or I guess you could just update all code to work on touchend only, and then do the timing trick and pray it wasn't actually a drag event, even if the timer threshold thinks it was.\n. This has now landed in iOS, so I'm going to keep an eye on it, but otherwise it'll go down as one of those lovely Apple legacy issues.\n. Thanks for submitting this issue. We have fixed this, and the fix has been pushed to the dev branch.\n. Actually I've seen this happen as well. It never happens on my PC, but on my Macbook Pro it's pretty consistent and will happen about 1 in 2 refreshes, it doesn't matter if it's canvas or webgl either.\nThere are two separate issues. One is when the updateLogic fires but with no render call. This has the effect of calling preUpdate on all subsystems. In some cases that blanks them - for example the Debug class's preUpdate erases the canvas it uses entirely. If render is then skipped it causes the Debug canvas to be blank for a single frame, usually coming back again in the next one. But it causes a 'flickering' effect (as it happens so quickly).\nThe second issue is with the frame skip logic on some systems. The actual concept behind the frame skip code is sound, and based on industry 'best practises'. However I'm pretty certain what happens is that the browser struggles at the start, most likely due to the large gc sweep that happens, but then is constantly 'behind' where the frame skip expects it to be. I think this picture from the Game Design Patterns book sum's it up well:\n\nI'm pretty certain that what happens is the timer gets thrown out early on, so is in a constant never-ending state of 'catch up', doing double updates and no renders constantly, causing the effect we're seeing.\nOn my Macbook if I do 'Game.forceSingleUpdate = true' then it runs smooth as butter every time. On my PC it doesn't need it. On a slow device that can be quite dangerous, so it's sort of a 'middle ground' area where it's a problem.\n. Closing this one off as there's no clear-path to doing anything more for it, without rewriting how Phaser works internally (which is what Lazer is all about).\n. Hmm this shouldn't happen under 2.4.4 any more because Pixi now uses the Phaser.Canvas.getSmoothingPrefix function instead, which checks the prefixes in order, starting with none at all, so if the browser reports 'imageSmoothingEnabled' as a valid property then it'll use it from then on. If you still see this with 2.4.4 and can boil this down to a test case then please re-open.\n. :+1: \n. We don't include private methods in the TS defs.\n. DeviceButton is in the defs in the dev branch, unless you mean there is something wrong with the def itself?\n. I understand, I meant did you check the defs in the dev branch? That is where we work on them when preparing the new build, and I can see DeviceButton in there.\n. Is this a question or a feature request?!\nYou can do it with ArrayUtils.shuffle though. Just clone the array then shuffle it. Voila.\n. :+1: \n. Yeah fair enough.\n. Yes it needs setting as a global, here's a package.json you can adapt:\n```\n{\n  \"main\": \"./main.js\",\n\"browser\": {\n    \"phaser\": \"../../phaser/dist/phaser-test.js\"\n  },\n\"browserify-shim\": {\n    \"phaser\": \"global:Phaser\",\n    \"pixi\": \"global:PIXI\"\n  },\n\"browserify\": {\n    \"transform\": [ \"browserify-shim\" ]\n  },\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    \"browserify\": \"^11.0.0\",\n    \"browserify-shim\": \"^3.8.10\"\n  }\n}\n``\n. Thanks, this is now fixed in the dev branch.\n. And against 2.4.4-dev?\n. This is now fixed in the dev branch.\n. It was super low priority really, nothing was 'broken' as such.\n. Thanks - added :)\n. Hmm it was used in several places. I have removed it for now, the demos still work, so I'll leave it \"left out\" for the time being.\n. Quite possibly, although it did mention it in the jsdocs. Right now I don't have time to go back through earlier builds to figure out why, so am happy to leave it as-is (as it works and doesn't break now).\n. This is now fixed in dev.\n. Agreed, fixed in dev.\n. Thanks for submitting this issue. We have fixed this, and the fix has been pushed to thedevbranch.\n. It's because the Buttons in your example don't have any textures, so they're given the__default` texture which the WebGL renderer is told to ignore (because it's breaks sprite batching and is a waste of draw calls).\nI guess the reason we didn't spot this in testing is because all the Button examples use a texture for the button.\nI think we ought to harden-up the skipRender check, so it's only enabled if the texture is using the default blank image AND has no children. It's not as guaranteed to be accurate (because the children may not render either), but it would catch cases like this.\n. This is now fixed in the dev branch. Please pull and have a test (you'll need to build, I only updated the source). Your example code above works fine now though.\n. Which version of iOS? Nothing actually changed in 2.4.4 with regard to how the visibility events are handled, so it has to be a side-effect of something else (possibly even unrelated). The forum thread linked to is too old to be about 2.4.4, which makes me believe it should have happened in 2.4.3 as well, unless the issue is actually iOS9 specific.\n. Closing due to several months of inactivity. A stand-alone running code example is needed to investigate this further.\n. Fixed in dev.\n. Timer.running is a read-only property, not a function. Please use pause and resume to pause your timer.\n. Agreed. Updated in dev.\n. Thanks for submitting this issue. We have fixed this, and the fix has been pushed to the dev branch.\n. You can call the function again and pass in 'null' as the callback and it will clear it.\n. Finally got around to fixing this one. Also fixed not being able to change the Themes too.\n. Where?\n. The fix implemented for #2208 will resolve this too. The reason it doesn't appear on some set-ups is because it's a WebGL only bug.\n. Thank you for taking the time to open this issue.

Either way, I need an example showing how you think it can't sort floats (or integers), because this Group.sort test handles both just fine: http://phaser.io/sandbox/edit/OzbGZCRc\nView the console output to see the raw y coordinates. Array.sort only sorts by Unicode string if no comparison function is provided, but Group uses one.\nInternally z is an integer, set by the render loop, never a string and never a float (unless it was replaced by something, which it shouldn't have been, as it's a protected property).\n.

In the meantime you can resolve it by setting the skipRender parameter of the __default BaseTexture to false. You only need do this once.\n. If you look in the source you'll see it's already been declared as a global var before the create statement, so it's correct to not locally scope it within the function itself.\n. It's not used in part1, so doesn't need declaring there. It should be in part5 however (I can see it appears in part6 so is correct from that point on). Functionally the addition of it changes nothing because they are globally scoped variables anyway, but for consistency it should be in part 5.\n. Thank you for taking the time to open this issue.

Try this: in your States 'resize' function, just log it out each time it's called (it gets sent width / height  parameters, so log those). Perhaps resize is being slammed for some reason.

The problem is this line here: https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/master/src/gameobjects/BitmapData.js#L584\nThe change that caused this is that BitmapData.clear now calls BitmapData.update, which has the above line in it.\nIt only happens in WebGL of course, but still, very frustrating. I cannot see a way to fix it either. Even just calling context.getImageData is enough to trigger it. So I'll stop BitmapData.clear from calling update and reflect this in the docs.\n. Well not really, all it did is revert the earlier change, which was a quite important one. But it will have to do for now.\n. Nice one, thanks.\n.

However this will not be implemented in Phaser, so I'm moving this request over to the Lazer feature request list instead. If you wish to submit a PR that isn't massively API breaking and that adds this feature to Phaser then we will consider merging it.\n. There, I'm quite happy with the solution offered in the latest commit. That, combined with the _swapCanvas change will make quite a difference.\n. What you're seeing is a result of canvas pixel rounding. However I believe the fix is easy, because a Game should never have non-integer dimensions. So this is now enforced in the Game constructor, which should prevent the problem from arising (it's still possible to call Game.resize and mess things up, but if you've gone that far on your head be-it I think)\n. I've tested this out tonight and I can't see an issue. The following code:\n```\n    var bob = game.add.group();\nbob.x = 0;\n\nvar s = game.add.sprite(400, 0, 'einstein');\n// s.scale.x = -1;\n\nbob.add(s);\n\nconsole.log(bob.getBounds());\nconsole.log(bob.getLocalBounds());\n\n```\nIt reports a bounds width of 640 (the size of the image) regardless of the scale.x or not on the sprite The only difference the scale makes is in the x coordinate of the local bounds.\nHappy to re-investigate if you can provide a code sample demonstrating.\n. Fixed in dev.\n. True (they used to be free, part of a promotion I think) but I've removed the wording anyway.\n. Thanks for submitting this issue.

If a Sprite has its input disabled, then it doesn't matter if it has a hitArea set or not, it's never actually used by Phaser.\n. Closing due to several months of inactivity. A stand-alone running code example is needed to investigate this further.\n. Fixed in dev.\n. @gregkleintv you're receiving notifications because you chose to 'Watch' this repo. We cannot remove you because it's a setting in your user account. Just un-watch the repo and it'll stop. Beginners guide to GitHub has more details about it.\n. Fixed in dev.\n. We've made a number of optimisations to the way TIlemaps render and are updated in 2.4.9 (currently in the dev branch), and a lot of fixes to how Sprites are followed by the Camera.\nWe're also working on a new WebGL shader for rendering Tilemaps, which you can find in its own branch on the main repo. I'll leave this one open for now, until the new WebGL renderer lands, but it should be a lot better than before with 2.4.9.\n. Ok I'm closing this one off (finally, yay!) as the new WebGL Tilemap renderer is now included in Phaser 2.7.0 in the dev branch, and I would like that build to be tested against this.\n. I do quite like the idea, I'm just wary of calling it 'focus' as that has meaning already in browser-land, and it doesn't really do what 'focus' means there.\n. I'm not deprecating it because it does what it says on the tin. If you swap tab, the game may or may not pause. It's entirely up to the browser if it decides to halt RAF or not. So we cannot use the page visibility API to detect this, because we've already captured that event when the tab swapped (and if you elected to ignore the onPause event then you are at the mercy of the browser). RAF pausing is another event altogether that I'm not sure it's possible to even detect.\n. Have a go at the dev branch version (you'll need to run grunt to build it), which reverses the stop / disconnect process.\n. Don't suppose you know if the recent updates resolved this or not? Would like to close this one off, but am reluctant until I'm sure it's dead.\n. Thank you for taking the time to open this issue.

Chrome OS X doesn't fire any mouseup events if the context-menu is open. In fact the only event it fires is 'mouseout' on the window object. So I now hijack that and use it to do what's needed here. Seems to be working fine now for me on OS X and is pushed to dev branch.\n. It automatically works this out for you based on the object given.\nIf you need more fine-grained control then use BitmapData.copy instead.\n. :+1: \n. The example was incorrect originally, and remains so. I'll nuke it (I never actually created it, was just a PR I accepted and should have checked more carefully).\nThe z property is used internally for ordering, but isn't meant for 'public' use.\n. :+1: \n. The total amount of queued files is Loader.totalQueuedFiles, which of course will change if the load has been started (as will the total held in totalLoadedFiles.)

Yeah I agree it makes sense to call loadUpdate one final time here, so will merge this in.\n. Not entirely sure of the reason for this change, but it's just a bit of extra hardening and won't break anything so I'll merge it in.\n. Fixed via the PR, thank you.\n. Thanks. In future you don't need to update the 'comments' version of the defs, as it's auto-generated.\n. Yes, good catch.\n. True, same happened for transparent as well. Fixed in dev.\n. Looks good to me.\n. Yes, I wish there was an easy way to make this more obvious - but at least you figured it out!\n. I don't intend to include a pre-built version of it any more, no. It's easy enough to use the custom build option to make one with it in imho.\n. :+1: for the explanation and fix. Merged with dev.\n. Nice idea. Merged :)\n. Fixed in dev.\nAnd for future, all you need do is change the js source. The docs html is auto-generated at build time (you don't need to do it)\n. Using your own canvas element is now supported in the dev branch.\n. While I agree with this, I cannot change it. It has worked like this for years, i.e. devs are used to it and it would fundamentally change games if it was implemented.\nIt's trivial for you to replace the computeVelocity method should you require an alternative approach.\n. This is a local configuration issue, rather than a Phaser one. If you've tainted the canvas somehow (or in this case the image it's trying to read from) then this error will occur. There's nothing Phaser itself can do about it, you just have to correctly handle CORs loading of the assets in the first place.\n. #1684 is unrelated to this. That is about the base object not actually having a texture that can be pixel checked (i.e. a BitmapText object) that maps to what is displayed on-screen, hence why it was flagged as a feature request and not an issue.\nYour issue however is 100% CORs related I'm afraid. From MDN:\nWhat is a \"tainted\" canvas?\n\"Although you can use images without CORS approval in your canvas, doing so taints the canvas. Once a canvas has been tainted, you can no longer pull data back out of the canvas. For example, you can no longer use the canvas toBlob(), toDataURL(), or getImageData() methods; doing so will throw a security error.\nThis protects users from having private data exposed by using images to pull information from remote web sites without permission.\"\nWhich is exactly what happens here. The canvas is tainted because the image wasn't CORs loaded, and doing a pixel perfect hit test uses getImageData (as it needs to read pixel values from the image), which is what throws the browser warning. The canvas was always tainted, you just didn't notice it because browsers don't complain about it until you try to do something they may consider a security risk.\nThere are ways around it, sites like https://crossorigin.me/ exist for example, or if you have control over the origin server then setting the correct response headers works too. Either way it's local to your server set-up and is nothing Phaser can check for.\n. Yeah conflicts, have merged your other PR.\n. Sorry but I need an example uploaded somewhere I can run.\n. The fix for this is now merged into dev.\n. Thank you for your PR! Today I released Phaser CE (Community Edition). This is my way of opening up Phaser 2 to the community, allowing you to control features and updates directly. Please see the README in the v2-community folder of the repo for more details about this change.\nIf you could please re-submit your PR against the new Phaser CE version then I will merge it immediately :) Note that PRs now go against the master branch, and don't forget to add your change to the README too!\n.

This is known as 'tunneling', when a physic body is moving so fast it tunnels into (or sometimes even right through) another body.

First up, you cannot use a RenderTexture as a texture for a TileSprite. I have updated the jsdocs to reflect this.\nSecondly, I can destroy a TileSprite created from a BitmapData fine, using current dev branch, code here:\n```\n    var bmd = game.add.bitmapData(400, 100);\n    bmd.fill(255, 255, 0, 1);\nvar text = game.make.text(0, 0, \"hello!\" );\nbmd.draw(text, 0, 0);\n\nvar ts = game.add.tileSprite(10, 10, 400, 100, bmd);\n\ngame.input.onDown.addOnce(function() { ts.destroy(true, true); });\n\n```\n. No because the LoadTexture component is shared by all Game Objects, and\nmost of them can use it fine.

Phaser components are JavaScript mixins, used internally during base class creation only. What you're describing is more like an ECS really, which isn't something we'll add into the core I'm afraid.\nI can see you've already been playing with it as an extension, so if you take it further please tell me (email / twitter) and I'll feature it on the web site and newsletter, as there have been other ECS's in the past and readers seem to like them.\n.

Thank you very much for your pull request, and for helping Phaser out.\nSadly your PR is against the master branch of Phaser. As per our Contribution Guidelines all development needs to take place on the dev branch.\nFeel free to re-submit your PR against the correct branch.\n. The result you're seeing is because you've adjusted the Circles mass offset by quite a large value (25). The offset values are given in unit lengths, from the body center of mass, along the local x/y axis. Providing them re-calculates the bodies center of mass and bounding radius.\n. Sure, makes sense.\n. I'm moving this to the Lazer wish-list for Bitmap Text objects (and for Text objects if someone fancies taking that huge challenge on!)\n. Agreed, nice idea.\n. This should be user-configurable, or at the very least only enabled on same-domain requests.\n. Closing as we've implemented our own version of this PR in the dev branch.\n. :+1: \n. When you enable a Sprite for physics it will scan all of its children, and give them their own physics bodies as well. I suspect this isn't what you actually want (i.e. you just want a single Sprite and to use the Graphics object almost as a texture for it?) - not for each of them to have their own independent bodies.\nI think what this issue has highlighted though is a problem with enabling a Graphics object to have a physics body. Looking over the code I can see it has the component for it, but its preUpdate isn't set up for it. I'll have a play and see, but I suspect Graphics objects shouldn't have a physics body at all. Eitherway this is definitely a bug, but not quite as clear cut as you'd expect.\n. For that the best approach is to create a Graphics object, then generateTexture on it, and assign that texture to all the Sprites that need it. This is the most optimal way of using Graphics objects as Sprite textures (and also will get around the bug you've found re: physics body)\n. Thanks for submitting this issue. We have fixed this, and the fix has been pushed to the dev branch.\n. Draw calls are based on the texture being rendered, not the display\nhierarchy. You gain 1000 draws because you're ping ponging between two\ntextures, so it can't batch them.\nUse a texture atlas, then as long as parent and child use frames from the\nsame atlas it will batch the draws.\nOn Monday, 28 March 2016, Dillybob92 notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nFor example:\nMONSTER_SPRITE_LAYER = game.add.group();\nvar temp_monster = game.add.sprite(0, 0, 'Bat');\nvar monsterShadow = game.add.sprite(temp_monster.x, temp_monster.y, 'GameSprite', 'MonsterShadow', temp_monster);\nI can add thousand's of these, and the draw call will not be increased at\nall.

As per our Contribution Guidelines all development needs to take place on the dev branch.\nFeel free to re-submit your PR against the correct branch.\n. Thanks, this is now fixed in dev.\n. The problem with PIXI getBounds is that it's deferred. For example say you have a Parent with Child A, and that child has Child B. So a simple 3 depth hierarchy. If you modify any properties of 'Parent' such as scale, position, rotation, then do getBounds on either child, none of them will immediately take the parent changes into account. Equally if you change Parent and Child A, then Child B will be missing out on both sets of updated data until the next render pass has processed.\nYou can mitigate this to a degree by calling updateTransform on the top-most layer of your hierarchy, as it will flood down and update all objects as it goes. Then getBounds will be accurate, at that point in time anyway (although possibly then invalidated in the very next call).\nThis is the core problem of deferred updates, but as it's how Pixi works we're bound to it with Phaser. Ideally it would use immediate updates, but it trades that for speed instead (as this way you only ever process the transform update stack once per loop). The downside is the loss of accuracy and blatantly incorrect values between frames.\n. Docs updated to reflect how this works.\n. Thanks for submitting this issue. We have fixed this, and the fix has been pushed to the dev branch.\n. Yeah there is no harm in doing this, so I've added it :) Also tightened up Tween.update.\n. Nice.\n.

The comments defs file is generated automatically by the grunt script, which parses the comments out of the JS files and merges them with the hand-moderated defs file.

Also the inclusion of the comments files broke the merge ability as well, so if you do ever want to re-open the PR, please just include the defs files, not the auto-generated comments ones.\n. There aren't any Phaser unit tests, so make them in whatever you want, it doesn't really matter. There are no plans to add any either, the API is just too broad to do it justice.

We have fixed this, and the fix has been pushed to the dev branch.\n. Thanks for this, but I would say it's best suited as a plugin published in your own repo. Everyone likes to do their menus slightly differently, but this could serve as a good template to offer them. If you release it on GitHub (or similar) then email me and I'll mention it on the Phaser site.\n. The short answer is 'no', but you can definitely do as Weedshaker suggested and create a polygon that almost closes, but doesn't quite (so the final points don't get eliminated during decomposition)\n. Thanks. If you change the Loader like above, does it still work in other browsers for you? Or does it fix it for Chrome, but break it everywhere else?\n. Thanks for the details. I'll test on iOS here and then either make the change, or conditionally patch it based on browser.\n. Tested in Microsoft Edge (Win10) and iOS and works fine, so will make the change.\n. Thanks for submitting this issue. We have fixed this, and the fix has been pushed to the dev branch.\n. In the code above you don't specify the x and y arguments when you do new ComicWindow, so surely they are bound to be 0x0? Unless you can demonstrate a bug in Phaser I think this needs asking in the forum really.\n. Thanks for submitting this issue. We have fixed this, and the fix has been pushed to the dev branch.\n. I agree it's weird (it's not the only instance of this inconsistency either) but we sort of climbed in to bed with this devil, and now must lay with it. It's too entrenched to change at this point.\n. Point.angle already has an asDegrees argument for this very reason. It just should be consistent in the first place though.\n. If you do nothing but swap 2.4.7 RC1 for 2.4.6 does it speed-up again?\n. Try this: set game.forceSingleUpdate = false somewhere when your game first starts. That's the only thing that I think would make any difference (in 2.4.7 this is now true by default)\n. That's interesting. I'm not seeing any difference in the apps we've got that use p2, but it's not exactly an exhaustive study. All the flag does is insist that there is at least one call to 'update' per loop (plus as many extra are needed to catch-up), and one call to 'render'.\nWithout it the loop will determine for itself if it should call 'update' or not based on elapsed time, and other things. The problem is a bit two-folded. On slow systems and generally low powered devices, having it false causes all kinds of jerky movement and inconsistent display, even if it's rendering at 60 fps. On high-end kit you don't really notice it either way.\n. Yeah I toggled it from the console and everything remains at the same speed other than the character movement (which is obviously done in p2), like it's running twice as slow, but the menus etc were all fine. Sadly I can't see any source to know what you're doing though in your update.\n. You aren't supposed to move the tilemap layers via position, they're locked to the camera and it's the camera that moves around them. If you adjust them in the way you're doing then all of the physics collisions will be out (by whatever amount they've been moved) as they're no longer at that position in the world any more.\n. You move the camera, then the layers will follow. Look at any of the Tilemap examples, as they all do it (either directly by changing the camera position, or by following a sprite that moves around the map)\n. Look at the example called blank tilemap, it has 3 layers all scrolling at different speeds.\n. It can't be done.\nHey @obiot can MelonJS do this? If so I suggest you use that instead @hihihih565 \n. I still think you're trying to fit a round peg through a square hole.\n. Hmmm this method shouldn't even be in the TS defs really, as it's not meant to be called directly. I probably ought to swap it from protected to private. I'll merge your PR in the meantime though.\n. PIXI is included in the phaser.min file. But if 'required' like this is still need exposing globally. See https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser#browserify--cjs\n. I wish we didn't have to do it like this, but without an expensive and time\nconsuming refactor it's the best we can do for now. Rest assured we won't\nhave the same issue in Lazer.\nOn Monday, 25 April 2016, ZakSignal notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nThanks for the RTFM link!

Thanks for opening this issue. As much as we'd love to help you, we need a fully working code sample to do so. Please provide one and then we'll re-open this issue and look at resolving it for you if possible.\nIf it's easier you can use the Phaser Sandbox to create a code sample (as this is now running the latest build of Phaser). Enter your code, click the 'save icon' in any of the editor tabs, and paste the URL here.\n. Yes I can see what's going on now. I've created a simpler test case demonstrating this: http://phaser.io/sandbox/FAjSAqtP\nI agree this is a bug and will address it in 2.4.8. Thanks for the report!\n. Thanks for submitting this issue. We have fixed this, and the fix has been pushed to the dev branch.\n. Yeah makes sense. Let me get the dev branch sorted out first before I merge this though. I'm thinking I may do a 2.4.8 release, as I'm worried if I merge this to 2.5.0 it'll be ages before it surfaces.\n. Ok all done and merged with the dev branch.\n. Hmm this wasn't purposely changed our end. Change it to whatever makes most sense and submit a PR and I'll merge it (I suspect change it back to whatever it used to be). Try running grunt tsdocs as well just to see if that was the cause of it changing.\n. Questions like this are best suited to the forum, but even so, a few thoughts:\n- Instead of overriding the kill method I would recommend you instead just spawn the new asteroids by listening for the onKilled signal instead, it will keep it cleaner imho.\n- Check to see how many times your kill method is being called when 1 bullet hits it, because you've got it as part of a collide check it's possible it runs multiple times.\n- If using Chrome, put the command debugger into your code, right after the new asteroids are spawned. This will pause the game, open up dev tools and allow you to start testing your objects to see what they're doing.\n. Yes 2.4.7 Examples are not yet uploaded. Download the repo and use it locally if you need them before we get them on the site.\n. Both 2.4.7 and 2.4.8 are now available in the Examples.\n. Just to confirm @Dreaded-Gnu you fixed this by updating node locally, yes?\n. Thanks for confirming. I'm closing this as it's obviously just a local out-dated version of node causing it.\n. Yes I've had a look into this and the 4th parameter is actually \"was this movement the result of a click event?\", not \"is the pointer down\". I'll update the docs now.\n. Thanks for submitting this issue. We have fixed this, and the fix has been pushed to the dev branch.\n. Thank you very much for your pull request, and for helping Phaser out.\nSadly your PR is against the master branch of Phaser. As per our Contribution Guidelines all development needs to take place on the dev branch.\nFeel free to re-submit your PR against the correct branch.\n. I'm certain that as soon as I run grunt buildtsdoc again (which we do as part of the release process), it will overwrite these changes and put us back into the previous situation.\nWhat we really need to fix is the Grunt task, so it replaces the ref link in the defs file it generates.\n. Doesn't really matter, all that matters is the buildtsdoc script handles the string replacement itself, or that a grunt replace task is run immediately after it. This is all grunt task related.\n. Going to close this one off because it'll be fixed automatically with the next rebuild (which I'll do today actually as part of RC1), but thank you for highlighting the issue all the same!\n. Thanks.\n. A better question to me is why on earth is preUpdate clearing the flag, and not the tinting process itself. Will have a play with this and see what can be done, thanks for opening the issue.\n. Ok I can't see any reason at all why the tint process shouldn't be responsible for it, so I've made that change and your test case now works (as do the old examples), so I'm happy this is resolved.\nUntil the reason I added it in the first place comes back to bite my ass :)\n. https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/commit/f494c867c798835f0819cc71077d1914bd3aed36\n. This is normal behaviour if the browser is running fast enough to be able to do more than one update per frame. You'll find the part that controls it in core/Game.js, in the update method (and updateLogic).\n. The problem somewhere in your code. Phaser will not 'natively' call postUpdate twice in a single update step. This is easily confirmed by adding a few simple logs to the Game and Core files (attached here if you want to put them into your own build). Then just create a Sprite and give it a name of 'debug' and it'll dump out its postUpdate for 60 frames and then call the debugger:\n```\nvar game = new Phaser.Game(800, 600, Phaser.CANVAS, 'phaser-example', { preload: preload, create: create });\nfunction preload() {\ngame.load.image('pic', 'assets/pics/dr_death-e605-endpart.png');\n\n}\nfunction create() {\ngame._dd = 0;\n\nvar sprite = game.add.sprite(0, 0, 'pic');\n\nsprite.name = 'debug';\n\n}\n```\ntest.zip\n. This is a very non-trivial feature request. The Pixi input manager isn't included in our build, and even if it was it wouldn't work anyway.\nIf you want to try implementing this for yourself then I would start in the Pointer class, in the processInteractiveObjects method. When it does the double-sweep you could add valid objects into a collective array, then at the end dispatch whatever events you want them to dispatch.\nI'm closing this because it's not something I'll implement in Phaser, but feel free to reply if you want to ask questions about adding it to your own build.\n. Traditionally because it's extremely common for Group children to delete themselves during their update cycle, which screws with the Group array length if you're iterating through it at the time. However we moved to using a destroy phase a while back, which may mitigate this requirement. Will have a look into it.\n. Just had a further look at this - preUpdate is where the renderOrderID is set, and that loops through in bottom-to-top order in Stage, but Group was doing it in reverse (hence the order ID issue), so have swapped that around. update and postUpdate will loop in reverse though, for the reason stated above, but that won't impact the order IDs.\n. Thank you for taking the time to open this issue. However, official support for Phaser 2 has now ended as we focus on preparing Phaser 3 for beta release. In a bid to keep the project tidy, and avoid confusion, we are closing all v2 related issues.\nThis does not mean your issue won't be looked-at.

And only if the problem persists, opening an issue on the Phaser CE repo.\n. Phaser.Device is a singleton class, it needs instantiating before it, or any of its properties, can be used. None of those properties are set until the class has booted, which happens when Phaser.Game is instantiated, so I fully expect it to log false for everything in the code above.\n. It's there for legacy reasons. It's also widely used, so will remain there for legacy reasons too. If I wasn't about to retire Phaser I'd probably deprecate it and move it, but it can live out its life with the rest of its similarly misplaced functions in there.\n. Sorry I don't have time to debug CoffeeScript. I need this boiled down to a simple runnable JS example really.\nAlso I'm curious, but it's impossible to have a Sprite in the World that isn't in a Group (as the World itself is a Group), so how do you have your code structured that makes the Sprite not appear in a Group?\n. The example cited (basic-follow) works exactly as expected for me in 2.4.7 and 2.4.8-dev. The sprite remains in the middle, and the camera tracks it until it hits the world bounds.\nSo whatever local modifications you made to it specifically in your game is the cause of the issue, or alternatively you weren't expecting the example to do this? I'm not really sure which. Your screen grabs seem to indicate some kind of property error, but it doesn't happen in the example, so my request for a proper code example remains I'm afraid (unless anyone else reading this has the time to translate the CoffeeScript into normal code for me)\n. Erm, also how about worldAlpha, worldPosition, worldScale and worldRotation which anything that inherits from PIXI.DisplayObject has?\n. Thanks for submitting this issue.

I've tried this in Chrome 50 (stable channel release, 32-bit version) on Win10 and on Chrome 52 (Canary, dev channel, 64-bit) and it works fine with them both.\nI'll try Chrome 50, 64-bit and see what happens there, and a few other PCs, but I'm not sure this is just Chrome version related, but involves another factor as well (GPU perhaps)\n. Tried this on a really low-spec laptop, with terrible integrated GPU, and I can see the error in WebGL mode (Canvas is fine). This is 32-bit Chrome. So my money is on this being a Chrome + GPU specific error, rather than 32 or 64 bit (it's possible maybe the 64-bit version uses different GPU drivers, which is why it only happens that way around for you).\nThere's no errors, nothing in the stack, and WebGL inspector doesn't show me any errors either. Which is just great, as honestly I can't see any way to fix this now.\n. Good call. My integrated GPU is a Radeon. On my Nvidia it was fine.\nWhich sadly makes this even less fixable!\nOn Tuesday, 17 May 2016, Stafford Williams notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nPossibly Radeon (+ Chrome v50) specific?

I'm releasing RC1 today, so if you get that file and test against it later, I think you'll find it's ok again. Please re-open / re-comment on this issue if that isn't the case, and if you're able to boil it down to a smaller test case, thank you.\n. Hmm, the example is jittery for me in every version of Phaser back to 2.4.1 (I didn't test earlier than that). I agree it is worse in 2.4.7+, but it's definitely still there previous to that too.\nI think the issue is tween timing based, rather than camera specifically. Will have a look.\n.

There isn't a single line of code that is specific to the combination of tweens and camera movement, so this is a side-effect of something else.\n. Ok I took a good, long look at this today. The problem was the properties that the Camera was using to determine where to move to next. I have refactored quite a lot of the code, and the examples run perfectly smooth for me now - both with tweens, and with direct position modification (see below).\nI've uploaded all the changes to the dev branch, including new build files.

Fixed the issue with Tilemap cropping - and actually optmised the whole game loop a lot more. Tilemaps are now much more conservative about their rendering, which should help performance quite a bit.

In the second one you're calling Animation.play which has a different signature.

Won't it fail however if you've a starting value of 0?\nif (x && marginX)\nAs the first comparison will return false.\n. The error is basically saying \"I can no longer read this Image\". Either it hasn't finished loading, or has been erased from memory for some reason. Are you doing anything complex with regard to image management? Constant clearance of textures for example, or on the fly image loading?\n. Nope, nothing has changed in 2.4.8 with regard to asset loading or the WebGL renderer at all.\nThat doesn't mean Firefox hasn't changed though.\n. Look at the 2.4.8 change log for yourself: https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser#change-log there's literally nothing Loader / Renderer related in it (except some sprite tint fixes).\nTry it with 2.4.9 instead and see what happens. Failing that, if 2.4.7 works, stick with it.\n. Given it doesn't happen in any other browser, it's clearly a FF specific issue. However that doesn't mean we can't fix it, but unless someone can help isolate what causes it, this one is likely to remain unsolved for a while.\n. This is going to be related to one of the following:\n1) The Loader events. Maybe something changed in the way FireFox deals with load / ready events from Image tags, and the image isn't actually fully ready for use, even though the event said otherwise (so Phaser carried on).\n2) Uploading large textures to WebGL is taking too long on specific FF / GPU combos, and Phaser is trying to use them before they're actually ready for rendering. Maybe there is a new event to listen for? Although I'm positive it has always been a synchronous process in the past, and not event driven.\n. This still needs a working test case to isolate it, before any further action can happen.\n. Anyone willing to see if this is still the case with the Phaser 3 build in the dev branch please?

Thanks for submitting this issue. We have fixed this, and the fix has been pushed to the dev branch.\n. Actually I'm going to remove this change from Phaser. It's not as simple as adding that conditional in. keyCode returns a numeric code. key (and keyIdentifier) return strings. And the strings are in-consistent across browser. For example IE9 returns Up where-as Chrome returns ArrowUp. This would mess with the Phaser.KEY consts in a large way.\nI appreciate it's deprecated, but I also suspect it's one of those things that will hang around for ages yet, due to how common using keyCode is, and how much it would break if support was dropped. We can address this differently in Lazer, but I'll revert my change for now.\n. I haven't tested the above yet, but is there a good reason why you're erasing the onComplete Signal that Video has, and replacing it with your own? Why not just: video.onComplete.add(functionHere) ?\n. I know this is old, but it's also now fixed. The issue was that calling changeSource would queue the video to be played, so calling video.play right away after it, would add another entry into the onComplete handler. The dev build now protects against this.\n. This is almost certainly a result of the recent commits by @Upperfoot to try and get tilemaps rendering when 'stitched' together, rather than how they should be by default (i.e. fixedToCamera). I'll probably revert back to the original code today, and then reintroduce the changes bit by bit until I find out what's breaking it.\n. The code in the repo, as it stands now, doesn't work in any of the Tilemap examples in the Phaser Examples repo either. It starts off fine, but as soon as it scrolls the collision is gone. So @SergeyFromHell is right, there's definitely something up, and I don't think it's fixedToCamera related, but something else. I'll have a dig into this as soon as I can, but to see it happening @Upperfoot just try out any of the Phaser examples like map collide or sci-fly.\n. You should really test it by building a release, the pre-built files are\nalways out of date.\nI have tested every Tilemap example last night and they all work fine, with\nno rendering bugs at all.

Damn it, I actually spent hours using tslint on the defs as well, making sure they were all correct - and it didn't even pick these things up! Useless.\n. Ok I've fixed all of those, and included your defs into the repo :)\nCould you please test and let me know if it works?\n. Awesome, thanks for letting me know before too many people got 2.4.9.\n. Although thinking about it, these changes won't get reflected in npm now. Arse.\n. Thanks for submitting this issue. We have fixed this, and the fix has been pushed to the dev branch.\n. What is this PR trying to do? Your message above got cut-off at the important part :)\n. Ahh yes, now I see what you're doing. Thanks.\n. Works fine for me in 2.5.0: http://phaser.io/sandbox/IOidRoRU\nBe sure to use the updateTransform call if you're doing weird / non-standard things to the display list.\nRe-open with your own Phaser Sandbox example if you can demonstrate it not working in 2.5.0 please.\n. That's just a picture. Show me the source code, running in Phaser Sandbox, that created it.\n. There's something wrong here, but it's nothing to do with tweens.

Closing this one off as it's been answered above, plus also I believe you've solved this already judging by your post to the forum re: Scale Manager guide.\n. Can you edit the typescript\\readme.md file please, to explain how to use this. As I've no idea, and I need to know, as people will ask :) so it makes sense to just have it in the docs.\n. Awesome, thanks.\n. Thanks for the PR :)\nI think there are a couple of things you could tweak, and then I can happily merge this:\n1) I don't think we need 2 new functions for this. Let's just make 'filter' an optional argument to the existing getFurthest / getClosest - then it doesn't change the API for anyone already using it, but provides the exact same new functionality as you've added here.\n2) Be sure to include the callback context as an argument, and then use callback.call to invoke the callback, rather than just hitting it directly like you do at the moment. That way it'll avoid scoping issues and keep it consistent with the way other similar functions work. Look at Group.iterate for an example of what I mean.\n. Thanks for opening this issue, and for submitting a PR to fix it. We have merged your PR into the dev branch, and attributed the work to you in the README. If you need to tweak the code for whatever reason, please submit a new PR.\n. It's already in there: game.input.enabled.\n. Unless you touch somewhere else on the game, outside of the Sprite, it's going to keep thinking you're over it, because that is where the last touch event occurred. As obviously there is no concept at all of 'over' or 'out' on touch devices, those events are of dubious value on mobile.\n. Thanks for opening this issue. As much as we'd love to help you, we need a fully working code sample to do so. Please provide one and then we'll re-open this issue and look at resolving it for you if possible.\nIf it's easier you can use the Phaser Sandbox to create a code sample (as this is now running the latest build of Phaser). Enter your code, click the 'save icon' in any of the editor tabs, and paste the URL here.\n. Yeah ok, let's add this in. In future please adhere to the coding style set out in the rest of the library though (you'll see what I mean when I edit your code, and re-push it, in a moment)\n. Children in Pixi have absolutely no concept of the root, they know only about the immediate parent, and that's it. Without that information it's impossible to know if a child is still on the display list or not. \nIt's also perfectly valid to have a 'hit area' style sprite that isn't on the display list at all, and still be capable of processing input events. So I don't agree this is a bug, as what happens is correct. However it's definitely a feature request of a kind, because children should know if they are on the display list or not. And if they did, then there could be an input related option that told them to ignore events if they're unparented (although it would be off by default, as it's actually an extremely useful feature).\n.

Thanks for submitting this issue. We have fixed this, and the fix has been pushed to the dev branch.\n. There may be something unexpected going on here, but in the example above no parent has been given, so it defaults to the browser window as the docs say:\nThe width of your game in game pixels. If given as a string the value must be between 0 and 100 and will be used as the percentage width of the parent container, or the browser window if no parent is given.\n.

And only if the problem persists, opening an issue on the Phaser CE repo.\n. Looks good to me - does it all still compile ok?\n. I wonder if the issue is related to when the text is updated? I.e. if the text is set after the game update loop has run, but before render is called, then I can full-well imagine it would do what you outline above, as it's only half been processed. One way to check this would be to try updating the text in response to a key press, or mouse click, something internal and handled by Phaser, and observing if the same pattern emerges. Then you could try swapping the text update for a setTimeout, which is async and out of the core game loop, so should highlight the problem you're seeing most of the time (depending when it fires of course).\n. Yeah that's pretty much what I'd expect. Setting the text property updates the internal text string, and flags the Text object as being 'dirty'. When the Text object is then next rendered it checks the dirty flag, and calls updateText, and then resets the dirty flag. It's that function that re-creates the text layout, drawing the new string, aligning it, etc. The expensive part is re-creating the Text texture, which is why it only happens once per render loop (no matter how many times the text string is updated prior to that).\nYou could try this: In your setTimeout, instead of just changing the text property, do that, and then call text.updateText() and text.dirty = false right after it. When it then comes into the render loop it should do so with the new texture ready, rather than being a frame behind. Let me know if that works or not.\n. Yeah those are private methods, we don't add those to the TS defs as you don't normally need to call them directly! I've an idea about the API, give me a few minutes.\n. There you go - that should do it (see latest commit) :)\n. Is that not what this PR does? (I don't use TS, but I'm sure it does)\nhttps://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/pull/2576\n. @monagames any thoughts on the above? (as it was your PR)\n. Add it in and we can ask people to test it. If no-one helps test it, we'll just remove it again.\n. Thanks for submitting this issue. We have fixed this, and the fix has been pushed to the dev branch.\n. Thanks for opening this issue. As much as we'd love to help you, we need a fully working code sample to do so. Please provide one and then we'll re-open this issue and look at resolving it for you if possible. Having said that, I have added in a guard to stop disconnections from a gainNode that no longer exists.\nIf it's easier you can use the Phaser Sandbox to create a code sample (as this is now running the latest build of Phaser). Enter your code, click the 'save icon' in any of the editor tabs, and paste the URL here.\n. As you've identified when a new texture is loaded, none of the existing animation frames are removed or modified. You could possibly try calling sprite.animations.loadFrameData(img.frameData, frame) (where img is taken from Cache.getImage) but this is unfortunately still really just trying to work around a system that was never meant to handle texture swapping mid-animation like this.\n. I'd be curious to know how you would like the Animation system to handle frames split over multiple textures. I.e. how would you like the API to change so you can specify this? I'm thinking maybe something like giving the texture key before the frame name? Or blocking them into objects.. i.e.: animations.add('shoot', { texture1: [0,1,2,3], texture2: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6] )\nBecause I'm well aware Phaser doesn't support this now, and I want it to.\n. I believe if you set the animation up to span multiple textures then it should swap between them automatically for you. I like the idea of mixing atlas + sprite sheets like above, that makes sense (although I suspect very rare)\n. Thank you for taking the time to open this issue.

You can track what's already been fixed by looking at the Change Log part of the dev README file.\n. To be using a kinematic body you must be using P2, not Arcade Physics. As soon as a body is kinematic it will definitely ignore gravity (it wouldn't be kinematic otherwise!) - to avoid collision from other objects you need to set-up collision Groups, and assign your objects to them in the order you need.\n. This is fixed in the 2.6.1 release which was published just now.\n. This is fixed in the 2.6.1 release which was published just now.\n. No, afraid not. Full unit test coverage of Pixi and Phaser is a chimera.\n. Thanks for submitting this issue. We have fixed this, and the fix has been pushed to the dev branch.\n. The the way width / height / scale works is directly inherited from Pixi. However, you can get the values you need from the texture, which will always return the original dimensions, regardless of the transforms: sprite.texture.width and sprite.texture.height.\n. Hmmm, this is exactly how it used to work (based off the anchor), but then it was changed a few versions ago, and now everyone is used to what it is now. But this suggests changing it back again. I'm not entirely sure. So many people confuse the anchor with a registration point, and that really is not what it is, it's nothing more than a texture offset.\nI'll have a think about it, but I'm not exactly thrilled about the idea of reverting it back again, put it that way.\n. Ok thanks for the clarification @SBCGames - going to close this one off, the solution has been given.\n. This is a feature request, not a bug.\n. I'm closing this off as a \"won't do\". Camera shake is implemented (in WebGL) by changing the projection offset at the start of the render, not by adjusting sprite coordinates or similar. It would need refactoring to provide this feature, which I don't want to do at this stage.\n. Thanks for submitting this issue. We have fixed this, and the fix has been pushed to the dev branch. Let me know if it works better for you.\n. Thank you very much for your pull request, and for helping Phaser out.\nSadly your PR is against the master branch of Phaser. As per our Contribution Guidelines all development needs to take place on the dev branch.\nFeel free to re-submit your PR against the correct branch.\n. I'm not sure I get this issue, because Phaser.Stage has a parent property (and always has), it's just set to null by default, and always has been because it's the root level display object.\nDo you have a working piece of code that can demonstrate this?\n. The worldVisible loop was updated in the previous version, so it checks the parent first, so am closing this off as fixed.\n. Example code needed. Paste in the full load string you're actually using, and the error it throws please.\n. What you've created for yourself is a race condition. You're setting a resize callback in init, that modifies the y position of an object that doesn't yet exist, because it isn't created until create. It's perfectly possible for a game to resize during the boot / load process, so you need to either not use an asset in your callback that isn't yet ready, or don't set-up the callback until in your create function.\n. Not at the moment, no. It's already on the feature wish-list, so I'll close this issue off, and it will get addressed as and when it can be.\n. Thanks for submitting this issue.

Is this your actual code?\ngameObjects.forEachAlive(function(gameObject) {\ngame.physics.arcade.overlap(gameObject, bullets, bulletHit(gameObject,bullet));     \n});\nBecause if so, there's no way this can work because you're invoking the bulletHit function immediately, where-as overlap requires a reference to a function that it can run itself, as the overlap checks are performed. Something like:\ngameObjects.forEachAlive(function(gameObject) {\ngame.physics.arcade.overlap(gameObject, bullets, function(gameObject,bullet){ // do stuff here });\n});\nor\n```\ngameObjects.forEachAlive(function(gameObject) {\ngame.physics.arcade.overlap(gameObject, bullets, bulletHit);\n}); \nfunction bulletHit(gameObject, bullet) {\n// do stuff here\n}\n```\n(don't forget the callback context in the 2nd example)\n. It clearly works though: http://phaser.io/examples/v2/arcade-physics/group-vs-group\nThis is a Group vs. Group using an overlap callback with 2.6.1.\nMost of your examples above would never work, because they invoke the function immediately in the overlap call.\n.

And if the game is in an iframe, or embedded a layer or two down, to all parents as well. This is not something I want to do, it feels far too invasive. If you need to do it, then capture window level movement events yourself and process them as needed.\nUnless you can think of a cleaner solution.\n. Thank you for taking the time to open this issue.

I'm thinking it may be a copy-paste left over from the Body.touching object. If you want to disable collision on a Body you should use Body.enable = false. I'm going to remove it, thanks for spotting it.\n. Thanks for submitting this issue. We have fixed this, and the fix has been pushed to the dev branch.\n. Actually I'm changing my mind :) I can think of reasons while you'd want a Body updating but not checking for collision.\n. There - much better. You can now set it, and it'll be checked inside of separate and skip the check if either of them has it set to true.\n. Thanks for submitting this issue.

And only if the problem persists, opening an issue on the Phaser CE repo.\n. I've noticed a very strange issue, which I'm sure it a result of these changes: For the first frame of a Sprites existence, it appears at 0x0 and flashes up there briefly, then moves into its right place. For simple objects this doesn't matter too much, despite the visual glitch, but for physics objects it often makes them embed into each other.\nI need to debug this further, to remove both issues, before I can release 2.6.2 - but figured I'd add a comment here in case anyone could shed some light on it quicker than it takes me to wind through it all.\n. Ok the physics issue is unrelated, but I'm still definitely seeing strange flashes of Sprites in incorrect positions for 1 frame. Debugging further now ...\n. It's fine, it's my issue to figure out. I'm trying to create a test case that demonstrates it consistently, but if you look at this example, for me under 2.6.2, very often I see a large scaled version of the text character appear in the top-left of the game, before it appears in the correct place in the line.\nIn another project I've got a sprite that appears on mouse-over, which is scaled and rotated, but has a quickly flash of 'unscaled / positioned / unrotated' in the middle of the game. Both are canvas only, so it's not a WebGL thing, and neither happen with 2.6.1.\nI think it might be event related. The bitmap text example displays based on a timer, and the rotated one based on a mouse event. It's as if they're created out of sync with the game loop, and appear strangely for a frame.\n. I'm starting to think this might just be a Canary glitch. It's such a pain in the ass to debug! More investigation tomorrow.\n. Thank you for taking the time to open this issue.

Post it here, or to the forum, and we can probably figure out what it is quite quickly. Texture atlases work fine on iOS, so this isn't a Phaser level issue. Trust me, GitHub would be absolutely brimming with hundreds of issues about this if it was. Plus my own projects would fail on Chrome / iOS, and they don't.\n.

When Phaser changes State, it calls Loader.reset, which definitely removes any preload sprites that have been set, as long as the State it moves in to has a preload function. If it doesn't, then it doesn't reset the Loader, as it assumes it isn't required. So if you're creating a manual Loader, and starting it manually (which it sounds like from above), then you need to call Loader.reset(true) yourself in your new State, and that will drop any previously set preloader sprites for you.\n. I'm struggling to think of a reason why you'd ever want to not fully separate two objects, but you can already define your own as @drhayes has pointed out above, so I'm happy to close this one off as a feature request already implemented.\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n.

Hi - thanks for the PR @GreatBigBore - as @hexus said, PRs should be the source files themselves, rather than the build files.

No, the CI fail is unrelated to your source.\n. You're right - we only ever update the dev branch defs, never master.\n. It depends what value you want. worldPosition, worldScale and worldRotation are all updated each frame, in the updateTransform method - until that point they will be either not set, or inaccurate (depending on how old they are).\nIf they are deeply nested then it needs a full scene graph update before the values are correct (i.e. you need to call game.stage.updateTransform() before checking any of those properties).\nIf you don't believe those properties contain the correct values then I need a code sample demonstrating it please.\n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. All entities are updated and rendered, every frame, no matter where in the world they are.\nYou can tell an entity to stop rendering if out of the camera bounds by setting autoCull = true on a Sprite (or anything with the InWorld component). You can tell it to kill itself if out of the camera bounds with outOfCameraBoundsKill = true, or out of the world bounds with checkWorldBounds = true combined with outOfBoundsKill = true.\nFor any follow-up questions please use the forum. I prefer to keep GitHub issues for actual issues.\n. Thanks for your PR.

And only if the problem persists, opening an issue on the Phaser CE repo.\n. Like I said in the forum post, you can never get the world position until the display list has been updated. And to get the position, use worldPosition, like this:\n```\nfunction create() {\nvar spriteA = game.add.sprite(100, 100, 'phaser');\nvar spriteB = game.add.sprite(30, -15, 'phaser');\nvar spriteC = game.add.sprite(30, 30, 'phaser');\n\nspriteA.anchor.setTo(.5);\nspriteB.anchor.setTo(.5);\nspriteC.anchor.setTo(.5);\n\nspriteA.addChild(spriteB);\nspriteB.addChild(spriteC);\n\nspriteA.angle = 30; \nspriteB.angle = 90;\nspriteC.angle = 10;\n\ngame.stage.updateTransform();\n\nvar x = game.add.sprite(spriteC.worldPosition.x,spriteC.worldPosition.y,'x');\nx.anchor.setTo(.5);\n\n}\n``\n. The camera position is irrelevant to theworldPosition` property:\nhttp://phaser.io/sandbox/edit/xSRRSTQS\nThis is your example, expanded a little, and I see nothing wrong with the placement of anything. It's all relative, to each other, within the world, and looks fine.\n.

No you can't do it with setInterval like that - that is adjusting the camera out of sync with the game loop, so sometimes it'll happen before the display list updates, and sometimes it won't, so the results will be erratic. The only difference it makes is that it guarantees a render loop has taken place, so the full transform has happened, all the sprites updated, the camera taken into account, etc.\nIf you do anything out of bounds - i.e. from a callback or a timer, including trying to calculate the position of an adjusted object, it'll sometimes be correct, sometimes not. The worldPosition property is literally the position of the sprite within the world - not on the screen. It doesn't matter how much, or how far, your camera moves, or where the camera even is, it's still just the position of the sprite in the world. Depending on when you read it, depends on if it takes an adjusted camera position into account or not though. Hence the whole issue with the loop and performing calculations out of sync.\n.

To summarise:\n1. If you adjust the camera position, and then immediately do an updateTransform, it won't make any difference to the results - because the camera is only factored in during the game loop, not the transform loop.\n2. If you parent a sprite with another sprite, and want to position it based on its world position, then you do need to update the full stage transform first. Not just the parent, or the group, but the whole stage, because it iterates down. If you need to factor in the camera position to the position as well, and the camera hasn't been changed via code since the last game loop, then it'll work. If the camera has been moved, it won't be factored into the position.\n3. You can use the postRender function if you need to position something after the camera, and all the transforms, have happened. You cannot adjust the camera in this function and expect it to influence positions though, but you can read world positions and they'll be accurate, with the correct camera offsets etc, providing you haven't gone and changed the camera again since the game loop took place.\n4. Callbacks and Timer events, and anything out of sync with the main game loop, are never guaranteed to be able to read the current position values accurately. Sometimes they'll be right, sometimes not. It all depends on when they occur with regard to the point the game loop is in at that moment in time.\n. To summarise:\n1.

Please provide a test case so I can see it doing something when it renders in canvas / webgl. \n. Thank you for your PR! Today I released Phaser CE (Community Edition). This is my way of opening up Phaser 2 to the community, allowing you to control features and updates directly. Please see the README in the v2-community folder of the repo for more details about this change.\nIf you could please re-submit your PR against the new Phaser CE version then I will merge it immediately :) Note that PRs now go against the master branch, and don't forget to add your change to the README too!\n. Forgot about this one. it's fixed in dev branch now.\n. The two links above don't match the GPU call screen shots above for me, which I guess were taken from your actual game, rather than the linked examples?\nI can't see anything wrong in the two linked examples, because there is only one texture being used, so nothing for multi-texturing to take advantage of. In that instance I'm seeing a couple more GL calls to set things up, but the overall amount of draw calls is identical, because there's nothing for it to do.\nMulti-texturing comes into its own when there are, quite simply, multiple textures being used.\nI've moved all the texturing stuff out of the dev branch for now, until 2.6.2 is released. Then I'll merge it back in and revisit this.\n. The mask is drawn over the BitmapData canvas using the blend mode source atop, this is responsible for what is happening - although it doesn't remove alpha:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/globalCompositeOperation\nIf you need a different result (via a different blend mode), then I'd recommend taking a quick look at the alphaMask method. You'll see it's just a couple lines of code, and creating your own variation shouldn't take long at all.\n. It doesn't functionally make any difference, as it's replaced immediately via preUpdate anyway, but you're right, it should use that value instead, so I've fixed it in dev.\n. Group.width is the calculated width, in pixels, is read. If you set it, it adjusts the scale (like the docs say). Here's a little test case to show what I mean:\n```\nvar game = new Phaser.Game(800, 600, Phaser.CANVAS, 'phaser-example', { preload: preload, create: create, render: render });\nvar group;\nfunction preload() {\ngame.load.image('block', 'assets/sprites/32x32.png');\n\n}\nfunction create() {\ngroup = game.add.group();\n\n//  Create a 200x100 sized Group, with 2 sprites in the top-left and bottom-right corner\ngroup.create(0, 0, 'block');\ngroup.create(168, 68, 'block');\n\n//  Set Group dimensions x2\ngroup.width = 400;\ngroup.height = 200;\n\n}\nfunction render() {\ngame.debug.text('width: ' + group.width, 0, 400);\ngame.debug.text('height: ' + group.height, 0, 432);\n\n}\n```\n.

I'm not going to add collision flags to Arcade Physics I'm afraid.\nAs to your second point, I'm not entirely sure I understand. You want a Sprite to be a child of a Group as soon as it's created? In that case use group.create() instead, or if you need the group to create a specific class type, you can do group.classType = Dude, then any calls to group.create will create Dude objects instead.\n.

And only if the problem persists, opening an issue on the Phaser CE repo.\n. How much 'padding' have you allowed in your audio sprite? I.e. 'white noise' before and after each clip? The error you describe sounds like the problem that Audio nodes have of just taking too long to seek to the right point in the audio sprite before it plays. During this 'head movement' you lose precious ms. So if you've got a tightly packed audio sprite, with no buffer after each sound, it runs the risk of getting prematurely clipped. The fact this happens in Howler too makes me think that is exactly what happens here, and you could mitigate it by adding some padding in, and adjusting the audio sprite timings accordingly.\n. Clearly not:\n10: {\nstart: 0,\nend: 0.6,\nloop: false\n},\nThat's 600ms.\n. It's the short duration values causing this. The fact you have the padding between each clip already makes your task a whole lot easier. Just increase each clip duration by X ms and re-test it. \nI'd go for 0.25 (250ms), but it depends (I've seen some older, crapper browsers, on certain systems, sadly take even longer than that to seek to the right point in the audio). There is no way to track when it actually starts playing, so if there's 100ms seeking going on, then you effectively lose 100ms from your duration, even though the sound hasn't actually started yet, hence the clipping.\n. > it's a slow, seemingly random, playhead and the only way to avoid this (for the most part) is to pad each sound a bit extra to accommodate a random amount of seek time?\nYes, that's exactly the only way to solve it. Your Math.ceil is really no different to my suggestion, just with a random additional value instead of a consistent one. The principal is the same. Being an integer makes no difference. The seek time isn't quite as random as it seems, the further the jump, the longer it appears to take. Feel free to ask MS why.\nIt's effectively a 'lesser of two evils' situation, you have clipped audio, or you have slight pauses after each piece. This is why for audio heavy projects on IE9/10 specifically we still use a SWF for audio playback, controlled via Phaser, even today.\n. I've never read anything about it, just bitter experience I'm afraid. I guess when IE9/10 were around, no-one really cared, because they weren't using Audio for games, they were using Flash.\n. No it's not part of the core, we built it for a client project, and then just kept re-using it. I could probably release it, but it'd be yet another thing to support, which I'd rather avoid tbh.\n. The CreateJS libs has a SWF sound player as part of them, which would be trivial to adapt though. Or I can send you the source, I don't mind, I just don't want to release it to GitHub.\n.

Not yet, but I think the warning will do for now, cheers.\n. You are responsible for tidying-up plugins, and any of the other countless things that you could have done in a game state, during the states shutdown method. It's there for last-minute house-keeping, object nulling, reference clearing, etc. And that's definitely what this falls in to.\nCalling destroy on any Weapon instance you've created will be enough. If it isn't, then feel free to re-open as a bug that needs fixing. But looking quickly at the destroy code, I'm pretty sure it will work fine.\n. Hmm, sort of, it would require a new plugin level property along the lines of ignoreDestroy, so for cases where you want a single Weapon plugin shared across states, it didn't nuke it as soon as the state changed (which is how I tend to use it). Plugins never automatically destroy themselves on state change, so if Weapon did it, it'd be specific to that one alone. Definitely worth adding to the docs though.\n. Yeah I use the Weapon plugin in a shmup where I have a single instance, in a global (non-State) location, and just clear-down the bullets group on each state change, but keep everything else the same (bullet count, last shot timer, etc). This will be even more important when we add parallel state / non-destructive states. For now though, let's update the docs for autoFire, and maybe in the class description too. That's an easy to merge change.\n. Makes sense. And, please don't :)\n. The codepen from @samme shows this working, so unless you can share a fully running code sample that demonstrates otherwise, I'm going to close this one off.\n.

It looks like something (an IDE plugin perhaps?) has updated all of the JSDoc blocks, putting little spaces in, which is making it next to impossible to determine the actual real changes in this PR vs. what looks like a bit of IDE barf?\n. This works fine with Phaser 2.6.2 (and various versions prior to that), it just doesn't work in the js-scrambled version of Phaser with Box2D built-in that is used on the site (which is pretty old now)\nNothing needs fixing in the plugin itself, or the example, just use a recent version of Phaser and it'll work fine. I'll update the site when I get a chance, but it's not important enough to have an Issue lingering open for.\n. It can't calculate the offset needed to accurately map it to the canvas, and it's not something that will be added in either. So you'll need to figure out some way of doing it, and overriding the internal methods to compensate for that. Or just don't put it in a scrollable div of course.\n. Closing as this is a duplicate of #2746 (please track that for a resolution)\n. Like it says above, it's fixed in the dev branch.\n. Thanks for submitting this issue. We have fixed this, and the fix has been pushed to the dev branch.\n. You can find a 2.7 release with the fix in here: https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/2.7\n. It's not really, it's a special build for a select few devs who needed it, which is why it's not on the CDN or web site.\nI ran a survey in the last issue of the newsletter if I should release 2.7 or just carry on with 3.0, and 72% said to carry on with 3.0, so I am, but the 2.7 build is there for anyone who wants it.\n. I've merged in the latest official release of p2, but it's still quite old.\nI don't think @schteppe has done a tagged p2 release for a good while now? Is there one on the horizon mate?\n. I'll wait for a proper release I think, so I can go through a change log and see what needs modifying in Phaser.\nIt's easy enough to replace locally if devs need to upgrade sooner.\n.

Honestly, I must waste so much time looking after defs, etc. Am honestly this close to just dropping them from the repo, and letting someone else deal with it.\n. Trust me, there is nothing simple about having to maintain a 5700+ line Phaser defs file and a 2000 line Pixi defs, and ensure they are in sync with a constantly evolving Phaser API.

You're creating an anonymous function, and passing it to a Signal via add which means \"call this function every single time this Signal is dispatched\", and it never gets cleared up. So it's an accumulative snowball. Ideally you don't bind an anonymous function, or if you must, use addOnce instead, so at least it gets removed internally once invoked.\nIf you think the error is something else, post a full code sample showing it please.\n. Nah I'm not willing to add in code just to do this.\nAm pretty sure this can just be overridden by providing a jsdoc block in the World file instead, that replaces the inherited one when it exports.\n.

Before we discuss how this can be done (I can think of a few ways), sprite sheets and all images in Phaser are loaded via Image tags, not XHR, so withCredentials will make no difference to them at all. It'll only impact the resource files (json/xml), which are loaded via xhr.\n@noseglid does that matter for your use-case? If not, then I've a way to implement this without needing new arguments for all methods. If it doesn't work for tag loaders (Image, Audio) then I'm not sure it's worth adding?\n.

And only if the problem persists, opening an issue on the Phaser CE repo.\n. Thanks for submitting this issue. We have fixed this, and the fix has been pushed to the dev branch.\n. I would suggest you try and create a bunch of bmd's up front (and the Images that use them), and have them ready in advance. Then you can unleash them as needed. I don't know how many you need, but caching just a few at the start would surely help removing creating them from what sounds like a hotspot bit of code.\n. The above code (in isolation) would not be impacted by the dev tools being open. The only thing that could cause it would be if your game is set to automatically change scale / size based on available window space. If that's true, then I would expect different scaling, because you've got less vertical space available in the window.\nThere is more to this issue than the fact the sprite is visible, or not, I'm afraid. Needs an isolated test case to prove it out please.\n. Thank you for your PR! Today I released Phaser CE (Community Edition).

I've already merged your PR, however there are functions for this already: RandomDataGenerator.interger and RandomDataGenerator.frac, also integerInRange and realInRange.\n. Fair enough. Done.\n. Nope it's fine, have merged.\n. Hi - Is there a reason you've created your own SoundManager instance, and not used the one Phaser creates by default? (which you can access via game.sound or just sound from within any Phaser State).\nThings like muting on game pause, etc, won't work with your own instance, it'll only mute the one Phaser creates.\n. If you find this still happens when you use the built-in (global) Phaser Sound Manager, then please leave a comment with example code, and I'll re-open this and look at it. Otherwise I'm going to close it for now.\n. Closing this as a solution has been given. If someone wants to update the Phaser CE readme then please go ahead.. Because Phaser 2 was never written with modules, to be modular, or with any kind of bundler in mind (it copied three.js). So when someone wants to try and shoehorn it into webpack, this is how it needs to be done.\nPhaser 3 is 100% modular and is built with webpack as standard.. Thanks, this is nice. Looks like a rogue console.assert is left in though, but I'll remove that now.\n. Thank you for taking the time to open this issue.

Yes this is by design, there are plenty of reasons why a Sprite that has been killed may still need its update function running. It's not something that will be changed in Phaser 2, but if you all want to change it in Phaser CE then go ahead. Just be sure to document it clearly.. Won't doing this fail to include the p2 and pixi defs though?\n. Thank you for your PR! Today I released Phaser CE (Community Edition).

The problem is that you used addChild instead of add. The first is a Pixi method, that circumvents all of the things that Group does. The second will work fine with the input enable flag set. I appreciate this is confusing, but it is what it is in v2. Don't use Pixi methods if you want Group functionality.\n. Don't worry about the CI error, that's my fault.\nHowever the line you changed in the requireJS project - it has a comment about it effectively saying \"Edit this to whatever you need\", i.e. it's a local folder path, not one set by Phaser, so it can be whatever you want. I know some devs like to use a folder called 'vendor' for 3rd party libs, others shove them all in 'js', some in 'libs'. So it's really just an example path, it doesn't have to map to the repo in any way.\n. Fair enough. Maybe if you could edit your PR to change the comment to something like \"Feel free to edit this path to whatever you like\" it will cover both bases, and I can merge it in :)\n.

I had the exact same issue recently. It only manifested on Chrome on Windows, and in the end was caused by a monitor / GPU setting on my PC. I literally spent a week trying to debug it, tracing things out, stepping through the render process, etc. But to no avail, the issue ended up being a clash with FreeSync in my monitor, an NVIDIA GPU and Chrome.\nIt doesn't mean it's the same issue you've got, but it's highly suspect, as it's the exact same symptoms. You could try downgrading to 2.4.4 again, but first I'd check it out on a range of different browsers and platforms. If everyone see's it happen, then it's likely a Phaser issue. If it only manifests on a select environment, it's a platform issue.\n. The reason you can't find anything in the change log, is because nothing related to this has changed at all.

If it's a genuine issue with something that changed between 2.4.4 and 2.6.2 it should happen for everyone, regardless of platform or device.\nIt should also happen with the simplest of scenes: just a single sprite, loaded and displayed. Does it?\nI'd also expect the GitHub issues and forum to be absolutely full of people reporting the same thing, as it's quite a fundamental problem, no? Yet other than what I personally experienced a few weeks ago, this is the first one. Which still leads me to believe this is more isolated than it may appear on the surface (and consequently, a pain in the arse to track down).\n. Post a link?

However I've never tested such an old version (you've got 2.0.1 there, which is really old). Try swapping it for the phaser.js from the latest release? (2.6.2) and see what happens. I'd suspect that might be enough.\n. I use Chrome on OS X Sierra daily, and Phaser works fine. However I've never tested such an old version (you've got 2.0.1 there, which is really old).

True forcing the code to use CANVAS. Most examples online use Phaser.AUTO which will try and use WebGL, but if you force Phaser.CANVAS then at least you can narrow down the cause.

It is, because the argument value is passed directly to Emitter.start, and if that value is undefined or null then it defaults to 250 in that method, so it doesn't need to do it in the flow method as well..

Hi - Neither of these are missing from the min file. You can search for them here: https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/master/build/phaser.min.js and it'll find them both.\nIt's easier to find AUTO by searching for {VERSION:\"2.6.2\",GAMES:[],AUTO:0, but onDragUpdate appears right away.\n. This example uses Phaser 2.6.2 min and drag update works: http://phaser.io/examples/v2/input/drag-update\nWhatever the problem is, it's local to your set-up / browser / cache / environment I'm afraid.\n.

Lots of devs use GSAP in their games instead. We just can't include it because of licensing issues.\n. You've added a function to every single object Phaser and Pixi (and JS in general) creates. There are several places where objects are iterated (such as in syncUniforms), and the iteration is expecting a properly formed local object, which it no longer has because it's gained a random new function on its prototype.\nI guess technically syncUniforms could do a hasOwnProperty check on its object to avoid this, but it's a very hot method, and adding that overhead for all properties in the object, 60 times per second, is less than desirable. Feel free to patch that in, in your own fork of the repo, but personally I'd find a less destructive way of doing whatever it is you're trying to do.\n. It was fixed in 2.4.3 (back in August 2015) #1969\nWhen the text is updated it flags all the glyphs as requiring a reTint. When the next render loop runs it picks that up and retints them. If you change the text out of the core game loop, this will be skipped. Working example (from 2.6.2)\n```\nvar game = new Phaser.Game(800, 600, Phaser.CANVAS, 'phaser-example', { preload: preload, create: create });\nfunction preload() {\ngame.load.bitmapFont('desyrel', 'assets/fonts/bitmapFonts/desyrel.png', 'assets/fonts/bitmapFonts/desyrel.xml');\n\n}\nvar clicks = 0;\nvar bmpText;\nfunction create() {\nbmpText = game.add.bitmapText(100, 200, 'desyrel', 'Click me', 64);\n\nbmpText.inputEnabled = true;\n\nbmpText.events.onInputDown.add(down, this);\n\n}\nfunction down(item) {\nclicks++;\n\nitem.text = 'You clicked ' + clicks + ' times';\n\nitem.tint = Math.floor(Math.random() * 0xffffff);\n\n}\n```. In the example above the text is reset continuously and works. An example demonstrating this behaviour is needed.. Thank you for taking the time to open this issue.

Good catch. That property has moved to the Device class. You can get it from:\nthis.game.device.canUseMultiply\nWhich means if you do this in preload it should give you the correct result (rather than forcing it to be true all the time):\nPIXI.canUseNewCanvasBlendModes = this.game.device.canUseMultiply\n. PIXI.canUseNewCanvasBlendModes = function () { return this.game.device.canUseMultiply; }\n. Thank you for your PR! Today I released Phaser CE (Community Edition).

This is an issue with Chrome and your GPU (or possibly just an out-dated GPU driver on your system.) We have no control over if the browser thinks it can support WebGL or not: we ask it, and it replies. And if it replies that it can, we have to assume it is telling the truth and carry on. You should report this as an issue to the Chrome team.. You really should report it to them - they do fix stuff like this, and pretty fast. Although I guess \"bad performance\" is very different to \"doesn't work\" - one is just a symptom, the other a bug.. Thank you for taking the time to open this issue.

I just think it would be too confusing, as you'd pull down all three versions in the tagged release, plus the tags would get confused when we start tagging v3 releases. You can get back to an exact version via npm easily enough. I think the best course of action will be to move Phaser CE to its own repo when v3 is ready for release, but in the meantime it needs all the visibility it can get, so it's staying here for now.. Tags point to specific commits, i.e. the state of the repo at that moment in time. How would you tag a sub-folder of the repo? I've seen it done using the folder SHA-1 keys, but it was a bit of a hack to say the least. If there's an easy way, I'm happy to do it.\nIt's important the npm package includes all the grunt files, otherwise you're unable to do a custom build of Phaser, which I know loads of devs do. The docs are vital too, lots of people prefer the look of the local doc browser over the site based one, and it's not unusual to have to work offline too, where again they are essential (i.e. while commuting). The Phase npm package has always included these, so it's nothing new, and removing them would be unexpected, although not an impossibility either.\n. Will keep an eye on things. It depends on activity. If lots of people get involved and it starts becoming an issue, then I'll move it to its own repo. At it stands only a couple are involved so far.. Good catch. _cache.atlas is a legacy object, and no longer used, but used to exist in the past.\nIf you just remove it from _cache.image it'll be fine. Which is the same thing as removeImage does already. For consistency it makes sense to include it though.\nFeel free to submit it as a PR, but be sure to do so against the Phaser CE version (in the v2-community folder), thanks.. Closing, as it's now fixed in Phaser CE.. Hi - The v2 (2.6.2) version is locked from any future changes.

And only if the problem persists, opening an issue on the Phaser CE repo.\n. Hi - The code and assets look fine, although I only checked the ghost animation. This is almost certainly caused by pixel interpolation on textures, under WebGL. If you force the game to CANVAS (instead of AUTO) I'm confident it will remove the problem.\nIt's caused by WebGL interpolating pixels when reading a frame from the sprite sheet, and under certain circumstances it's pulling in an extra vertical strip of pixels from the frame to the left of the one being displayed (in this case, but it's not limited to that, it can do it from any adjacent frame).\nTexture Atlas software such as Texture Packer have built-in features to avoid this, called Border and Shape padding, where it adds in an extra few pixels of blank space around frames, so the GPU can't grab frames from adjacent cells by mistake. I'd strongly recommend using it, if you need to keep using WebGL and can't switch to canvas.. Thank you for taking the time to open this issue.

All updates to Phaser v2 should take place in the Phaser CE repository, as that is now the actively maintained version of Phaser 2.. @stefos96 the attitude is unnecessary - it hasn't been merged because we're debating the need for the class in its current form. The fact it's the master branch is irrelevant. v3 still compiles and doesn't throw any warnings at runtime even with the typo. While I agree it should be changed, it's hardly life threatening.. Thank you so much for translating this. Would you please be able to open a PR against the Phaser CE repo? As they can merge your work in there, because we are no longer accepting any PRs for Phaser 2 on this repo.. Thank you for taking the time to open this issue.

There's nothing you can do about this I'm afraid, the issue is the way Firefox and Chrome differ in their implementation of the Canvas FillText method when you use insanely large font sizes (and yes, 2000px is insanely large). For Text objects all Phaser does is create an internal canvas, draw text to it using the canvas API and then render it. You're at the mercy of the browser as to how that text is drawn.. Depends on the font as to how that would look. If it's a smooth font, with lots of curves, then at that resolution it would look extremely chunky. Try it and see though.\nFor text genuinely that large, the only way of not blowing all your GPU RAM would be to use the DOM instead.. The problem is right there, you've run FF out of memory by trying to create a canvas too large for it to handle on whatever device you tested it on.. Thank you for taking the time to open this issue.

I'm really sorry, but we didn't get a chance to merge this before it was updated our end, which puts this PR into a big state of conflict.

If the issue still exists in Phaser CE then please submit your issue there and I'm sure the community will be able to help out or offer guidance.. How are you requiring Phaser? What's your setup?. Yeah, this is annoying because I really like the way it works and is structured, but it's leaking as you said, and breaking including Phaser via webpack, so I'll have to think of a less elegant solution :(. This should now work properly (and not pollute global scope either). I refactored how the object factory works completely, along with lots of other updates that should make life easier. Please let me know if you're able to include v3 properly now.. Thanks, happily merged now.. Well spotted. This is now fixed in master.. This now passes.. This is done on purpose and will remain in place until we hit release.. If you want to disable it, it's done in Game.js at the end of the constructor.. Thanks. I also need to get the Progress events linked back into the Loader, as it needs those to be complete really.. Thanks for the suggestion but I'm not sure we need it. CE is tagged in its\nown repo, and there won't ever be another v2 release. The next one will be\nv3 which will be a natural continuation of the versions and will replace\neverything currently in here when the time is right. I don't ever want to\nbe in the position where we have to maintain multiple versions\nsimultaneously, to be honest!. We use the version internally in the source, it's an available const, mixed\nwith Dev status flags. So setting it at publish time is too late for our\nneeds.. Ok, let's look at Webpack: Thousands of PRs and changes made directly onto master. Significant changes sometimes merged in from other branches, but on the whole looking at their commit log, it appears most work takes place directly. When they are ready they tag and publish. They also publish lots of beta versions to npm as well (we do not). You could definitely argue that the Webpack master branch is unstable. But I guess it doesn't matter for them because the main way you install it is via npm. Unless you were working on Webpack itself there's little reason to clone the repo and build from it.\nFor us, npm represents a much smaller percentage of installs. Most people grab the build files or clone the repo. Our npm versions are clean, stable and properly tagged. Historically our master branch has always been stable too as we always worked in a dev branch and then merged on release. This is something we may revert back to when v3 is out and the repo has been tidied up. It definitely kept things clean but was more hassle as we'd often get PRs against the wrong branch. Undecided at the moment what approach to take, will reconsider when the time comes.. I would use 'Contains' as it keeps it clear you're checking the circles mid point.. This isn't a Phaser 3 issue, but to cover it:\nThe tutorial linked is how get started making a Phaser game. You don't need to build Phaser to do this, but that is a pretty deep topic in itself and is linked directly from the GitHub README: https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser#building-phaser as well as on the Phaser site. There is no point throwing this at someone in a getting started guide, it's too much, too fast, and is about web development, not game development.\nI don't understand what question 4 is asking.. Ok, that makes more sense. There is no \"hello world\" for Phaser 3 yet, as it hasn't been written. The one you linked is for v2 and I know won't work properly with v3. Keep an eye on the newsletter / dev logs, as we release more things like this over the coming months.. Thanks :). Actually, max needs removing entirely now! But I'll merge until I update it :). Thanks for opening this issue (a while ago now!) - I'm going to close it just because I want to keep this please tidy and focused on current live issues, rather than feature requests, but just to say that we fully understand how important Spine support is and we will definitely start exploring it. For updates please check out our weekly dev logs, when we work on it you'll see it mentioned in those..

Sorry, my mistake. Merged (although it always built fine on Windows anyway, I expect died on OS X / Linux). Hi,\nWe worked hard on making z-depth sorting really easy in Phaser 3, specifically for isometric and 2.5D game support. We won't have time to include isometric map import in the first release, but it will definitely be coming, and more importantly, the renderer is already set-up to handle it easily (if you wanted to roll your own in the meantime).. Questions like this are best asked on the forum, as they're not an actual issue with the framework itself.\nhttp://www.html5gamedevs.com/forum/14-phaser/. Code looks fine. Try this build of v3 instead: http://labs.phaser.io/build/dev.js. Assuming that the DOM Content Loaded anonymous function isn't screwing up what this means of course.. Yeah, that version is too old to have the physics in.. Matter.js isn't included in the build up on the examples repo because no work has been done on its API yet. You could comment it back in and build it yourself if you like (you can find the part you need in the src/physics/index.js file - then just build it) but I left it out of the Beta because it's massive! (adds 330KB). Shout if you get stuck building it, I can shove a pre-built version on labs for you, but it's probably best to wait until the Matter.js API has been done tbh.. We are absolutely 100% automating it for V3. There is no way I want anyone stuck with the task of manually updating the defs again. So far my thinking is that I will use a custom jsdoc tag to help out when the type isn't possible to figure out from jsdoc alone.. We are absolutely 100% automating it for V3.

So far my thinking is that I will use a custom jsdoc tag to help out when the type isn't possible to figure out from jsdoc alone.. It's a phenomenal amount of work. Such a pivot, this close to release, isn't a sensible move. It's the kind of decision that has to be made before development starts (and it was, we discussed it at length on the forum, and plain JS won out). It's a phenomenal amount of work.

TS has evolved significantly since Phaser last used it. It was a hot steaming crash-prone mess back then. I've no doubt it's a lot better now.\nIt's still not going to happen though. The costs outweigh the benefits too much.. TS has evolved significantly since Phaser last used it. It was a hot steaming crash-prone mess back then.

Trust me, 3.0 has zero chance of standing still long enough that this would be a sensible undertaking :). There will definitely be TS defs with the 3.0 release..

I've now linked to the current issue and am going to lock this one for comments.. Actually, I should remove it entirely.

Will make a decision when we implement the Tilemap API (and not just the renderer). Very likely it will change to emulate old behavior.. Ok this has now been added for both static and dynamic tilemaps. There is a new property skipIndexZero which you can toggle, and it has the desired effect of either rendering or skipping index 0 tiles which includes -1 tiles, or any 0 or negative value). Ok this has now been added for both static and dynamic tilemaps. There is a new property skipIndexZero which you can toggle, and it has the desired effect of either rendering or skipping index 0 tiles which includes -1 tiles, or any 0 or negative value). This is the correct behavior for Range.repeat. The idea is that it repeats the output data the number of times given:\nRange ([a,b,c], [1,2,3], repeat: 1) =\na1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3, c1, c2, c3, a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3, c1, c2, c3\nIn the above, repeat 1 means 'repeat the whole range once'. As it's a repeat you would get 2 lots of objects back again, the first set and then the repeated set. Much like if you had a Tween with 'repeat 1' it would play the Tween through twice, the first run followed by the repeated run.\nI'm happy this function works as intended. The question then becomes should repeat in the context of createMultiple be changed to something else so you don't have to mentally account for the 'off by one'..

It fails because there is already an animation defined with that key, and they need to be unique. Two choices: We allow newly defined animations with the same key to overwrite old ones (which could create quite a mess), or we throw a run-time warning if they try to add an animation with an existing key. I think I probably prefer the warning myself.. Good point. It fails because there is already an animation defined with that key, and they need to be unique.

I think I probably prefer the warning myself.. We could do. It feels to me like override: true is just a safety blanket allowing devs to be messy in their code :) Really, they should be planning more carefully which animations are loaded from configs, and which are created directly in their own code. Which is why a warning tends to enforce this.\nHowever, I guess there are situations when it may be needed. Perhaps loading an external set of animation data generated by an app of some kind, that you wish to override some built-in defaults. So perhaps override makes sense, and if that isn't set then a warning is thrown.. We could do.

The point of the anims property in the sprite config is to tell it which animation to use to play, it wasn't meant to create the animation as well, although I can see why that would be useful! :) I do think it might be easier to restrict the functionality at this time though, so if the animation exists, it just adds it to the sprite.

I'll merge this in because it's sensible :) but I think it needs to be more robust - at the moment it doesn't wait for the DEFAULT or MISSING onload event to fire, it just carries on going through setting up the systems. In some cases the delay is enough that it doesn't matter (for example in Chrome I never get an error) but sometimes if your create function needs one of those textures it can error because they've not finished 'loading' yet..

I'm curious what the is-fullwidth-code-point module is. That isn't something Phaser uses. I thought maybe the webpack-shell-plugin used it, but it doesn't seem to.\nI have updated the copy-to-examples shell script today, so it will check to see if you've got the Phaser 3 Examples repo locally before trying to copy to it, and fail gracefully if you don't.

So using a boolean would get converted into true or false as the property key.

Hi,\nWe have an editorconfig and eslint config on the main repo, which we adhere to quite strictly. They're configured to match the way we work and I don't want to change them at this point. However, adding them to the examples repo feels a little heavy-handed. I'm not sure I like the idea of enforcing anything there, as it's just an examples repo. A lot of the code is for quick tests or demonstrations and it really doesn't matter too much if it conforms to any standard or not.\nThe template repos though would be a perfect candidate for it. So you're welcome to update those to add in both features.\nCheers,\nRich. Hi,\nWe have an editorconfig and eslint config on the main repo, which we adhere to quite strictly.

Why are there so many uses of typeof for an undefined check?\nif (typeof this._beforeCallbacks[key] !== 'undefined')\nI don't see the need to invoke typeof here, it could simply be:\nif (this._beforeCallbacks[key] !== undefined)\nAlso, I'm dubious about the wholesale replacement of delete for undefined. They're two totally different things. In the Data Store we use delete because we want to actually get rid of that key from the object. Not just blank it, but literally remove it. I agree that mutation is bad for hot objects, but that doesn't really count the Data Store or any destroy call (but may include the shaderCache, would have to look further at that one).. The Container is just a WIP and hasn't been planned out yet, so this example isn't worth exploring yet. Wait for some activity on the Container object itself and then you should see examples follow through.. Sorry, forgot to post that this was fixed in Beta 13.. Sorry, forgot to post that this was fixed in Beta 13.. IE9+. It should be exactly the same as V2. We've never specified explicit versions of self-updating browsers like FF or Chrome in the past and has never caused an issue. Only for set-in-stone versions like IE9 or OS versions like iOS7+ etc did it really matter.\nBecause it's ES5 through-out there should be very few areas where it won't be compatible. When you get into API territory like Web Audio it's harder though. It would be easier to just list out a range of API / browser features we expect to be in place, rather than saying \"FFx will work!\" and then finding that actually, on Linux, with a certain GPU for example, it actually doesn't.. Here are the drag examples that use the correct API calls / events:\nhttp://labs.phaser.io/index.html?dir=input/dragging/. Yes, it said in the newsletter this game was desktop only (for this reason, I ran out of time to debug it.)\nPretty sure it's just the issue with double pointer events firing on mobile.

There's no ability to dump gl draw calls direct onto any kind of object. We have got RenderTexturess on the roadmap but even those would abstract the calls away.. This issue is no longer relevant as we prepare to move to V3. However ...\nP2 hasn't been updated since November 2015. The version in Phaser 2.6.2+ is the most current. We include it wholesale, no modifications other than a few small tweaks that were never merged into a p2 release for some reason. Had they done so, we could have updated to it, but they never did. Should a new version of p2 ever be released it wouldn't take much to implement (depending on what changed.)\nWe absolutely benefit from the P2 TypeScript defs, as they're included in our repo and with CE, and it was the Phaser community that first created them, years ago. All other communities benefit from the work we did there. We were also responsible for the first Pixi TS defs as well. So it's incorrect to say we don't benefit from the defs we created, as we do and have done for years. Fixes to them are actively maintained in Phaser CE.\nPhaser 2 uses its own very specific, very customised version of Pixi 2. It's not just a fork, it would be pointless forking actually as they'd never want to merge our changes back upstream as they're specific to Phaser. In a way, I'm really glad of this because Pixi is now on version 5 and has gone through 2 complete re-writes in the past 2 years. As Phaser 2 was so tightly bound to Pixi it means we would have had to completely rewrite it, twice, just to stay current. That's a lot of work of dubious benefit when our time is best spent elsewhere.\nIt's not a simple case of just including it from npm and updating every now and again. To assume that is to completely fail to understand the depth of integration we have with it. When we used Pixi 2 we actively contributed back to the project. I'm still personally one of the highest contributors to Pixi 2 there was, so we absolutely helped push it forwards and tracked loads of bugs down back then.\nPixi is a marvelous piece of work, but went through too many fundamental changes, too often, for us to risk building Phaser 3 on-top of it. We're not talking small API tweaks either, the changes are seismic and we would literally have to have adopted every single one to remain using it. This is why we spent a year building our own renderer, to avoid being painted into a corner like this ever again, and to add renderer features in that Phaser, and games in general really need.\n. Last commit to p2 that actually changed the library and not just an example is over a year old now: October 3rd 2016, and never made it to a release version yet.\nPixi 5 is in active build, clearly seen in the current branches and planning going on as they lock-off v4 from any future changes.\nWe have no such issues with V3, as we have no such dependencies.. It won't be a regular dependency in its current state because it includes too many things that are pointless being in there for Phaser. If I was to include it via npm you would pay the cost of taking all its baggage with you: the Runner, the massive Render files, the Mouse handler, Metrics, etc. If this is tidied up in a future release then I'll gladly swap to using it directly.\nUntil that point we're contributing tests, bug reports and suggestions back to the main repo, some of which are making it in already.\nThe problem with 'regular dependencies' is that it makes people incorrectly assume you can just upgrade them and everything will be fine. The original comment in this issue makes that very assumption; that had we just used npm we could have upgraded them and kept up to date. It's a complete fallacy though..

I don't get your \"not a good excuse for not forking / contributing\" comment. I'm still the 9th top contributor to Pixi even though I've not touched it for several years, I contributed 16,000+ lines of code and countless hours of time to the project. Now we've started using Matter there are several enhancements in 0.14.0 that are a result of my contributions. To say I don't contribute is both incorrect and mildly offensive\nNeither Phaser nor Pixi were available on npm when we integrated them, and even if it had been it still wouldn't have solved just how much we needed to customise it to be able to use it.\nIt's too late for Phaser 2 and CE, they are what they are. It would literally be impossible to remove Pixi from it and swap to an npm version. P2 is trivial to upgrade, but I doubt we'll ever see another release version of it anyway.\nFor V3 I'm happy to use matter from npm once the performance PRs have been merged, assuming we can still exclude the excess classes we don't need (because they are not excluded by build tools because Matter references them all internally due to the way it has been structured.)\n.

Thanks, this is now fixed in master.. Thanks, this is now fixed in master.. This is now fixed in the repo.. Hmm yes because they don't have textures, so no frame to calculate the display dimensions from. Will override this for Zone so it doesn't get exposed.. Because then we'd have to use Babel or similar to transpile it all back again, which is overkill when all we needed was a bit of syntactic sugar for an object prototype. When we switch to ES6 we'll do it properly, not just for classes.. Correct, it doesn't prevent default on the events yet and it should, or at least optionally should like V2. Have flagged for next beta.. This is now fixed in the master branch, you can specify in your game config if input events should capture input or not (default is to capture it).. Wonderful, it obviously isn't taken into consideration when the DOM calculates offsetLeft, which is insane really as it's supposed to return a pixel value. Mind you, it returns null on iOS if the canvas is hidden or fixed.. This is now fixed in Beta 14. Please let me know if it still happens though!. Yes, it should call up the stack. Have added.. Yes, this is a bit of a legacy method actually. Will have a chat with the team and see if it's worth keeping (and fixing), or just removing.. Ideally using a mask, but for a simple crop that may be overkill, so I've added this to the list to look at soon.. Related, I wonder if we ought to gitignore the lock files.. Yeah, this was fixed in #3117 and is now merged. It makes sense to me that Zone should override setSize and push those changes through to its hit zone, as long as a custom zone hasn't been specified for it. So I'll definitely have a look at how this is implemented because it shouldn't be this confusing.. This may have been specific to the build at the time, but this example is working correctly now (against master branch), please re-open if you can reproduce it though.. Pretty sure it shouldn't do this. Will debug on Android tablet to check. Does anyone reading this have a Mac and iOS device to see if it happens on that too? (as my Mac died and I've not replaced it yet). @pavle-goloskokovic I don't suppose you know if it fires once for mouse and once for touch, do you?. @pavle-goloskokovic also, please try master branch build, as I fixed some related issues which might stop it. Actually, I'm sure this is fixed in master now, I can't get it on Android or under emulation in Chrome after the recent changes, so I'm happy it's working as expected. What is still a problem though is the OVER_EVENT fires just before the DOWN_EVENT, which I don't think it should.. Hiya - which browser is this in? As I don't see the error in Chrome or FF.. Thanks, this is now covered in the master branch version. I can't mark listeners as passive because we actually need to preventDefault on them, but it appears having a passive object in there is enough to stop the warning.. Thanks for reporting this. It has been fixed.. Thanks for the report. This is now fixed.. Thanks, this is now fixed.. This one is running properly now, maybe as a result of the last fix I just pushed.. It's not yet implemented but will be shortly. I'll leave this issue here as a notification for those who want an update when it is.. Let's recheck this once RP support is added back into the new pipeline.. Related to this: passing an XHR object for a file causes a timeout refresh for the whole browser.. Yes, this example needs recoding. It won't be migrated to the examples site until we fix it.. This is now fixed in the repo.. This is now fixed in the repo.. Fixed in the repo.. Yes, Quads use a single text. Have added it as a feature request for now.. Thank you for submitting this feature request. We have implemented this and the feature has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. The physics library would have to be written in a specific way to take advantage of WW. If one of the libs we use is upgraded to do that, we'll incorporate those changes, although due to the locality of the data with WW I'm not sure it will happen imho. We'll keep an eye on it though and also the WASM space.. No matter how hard I try I cannot re-create this. I filled the entire map with balls, hit ctrl + until I couldn't zoom any further in Chrome, hit ctrl + 0 and it was still just an 800x600 canvas.\nCan anyone else replicate this?. I've watched this video several times now and I don't really get what I'm meant to be seeing either, sorry! Maybe a 'before' and 'after' screen shot would be better? or run Chrome inspector on the canvas and tell us what the size was at the start vs. the end.. Ahhh ok!! It don't think it's anything to do with the zooming actually. If you just leave the simulation running they will be pushed down eventually, because matter can't cope with that many non-static, non-sleeping bodies crammed on-top of each other.. Ahhh ok!!

I'm happy for them to remain inlined until we finish development.

In our webpack config we use raw-loader to handle the vert and frag files. If you're pulling into your own webpack set-up, you'll need to copy this block as well in order for it to build.. There's no time to look at this right now, realistically probably not this year, but I'd be happy to accept a PR from someone adding the feature in.. I'm quite tempted to remove the callbacks from animations and just use pure events, as now all Game Objects extend event emitter it would be quite trivial to do!\nTweens can tween anything though, so it makes more sense to have a callback.. You\u2019re right, I was just thinking it would save having to have a load of\nproperties on objects (to store the callbacks) that may never be used. In\nsome cases I set these to NOOP just so I can avoid testing if a callback is\nset before invoking it. You can still use your arrow functions for events\ntoo :) and multiple things can be bound to an event. I\u2019m not 100% sure\nthough.. V3 doesn't use texture anchors in the way Pixi does, so to achieve the same effect you should use setOrigin(x,y) instead.\nEqually, there is no \"world\" in v3 either. You're free to implement the bounds however you wish (if at all) - you may wish to use the camera bounds as the world boundary (there are a few examples showing how to do this), or perhaps the physics world bounds. Or you could just use a plain old Rectangle, it's really up to you :) But once you know what you're using, finding the center is easy enough.\nThe rest are Scale Manager related, so can't be covered yet. Keep an eye on the examples repo for when examples for that land.. This was addressed in the 3.0.0 release. Please can you re-test against that.. This was addressed in the 3.0.0 release.

Unlike in v2 the game object is no longer the main entry point into Phaser. It contains only a handful of global managers and very rarely should be interacted with directly, instead everything through be done via the Scene. So the fact it's possible to jump from Game to the SceneManager, back to Game again, is fine, as under normal circumstances you'd never actually do this anyway.\nI'll have a look at the Input config.

It\u2019s really not the end of the world.. The first pass at them (they're automated, not hand done) were posted to the Phaser forum a few weeks back. They're not being worked on at all until the docs are complete. Docs are the priority. Until all of the data types, config objects, events, etc are correct in the docs, the defs will never generate properly.. Yes, completely from the docs (using hinting where needed to ensure they are correct). We fell into the trap of manually making defs for v2 and even today, years later, they're still being fixed now and again. It was something we couldn't bear to go through again for v3.. The most helpful right now would be to literally do a 'find' on the source code for the string [type] - and, if you know or can work out what the data-type should be by looking at the function, replace it.. As it currently stands there are 1069 unspecified types left to replace.\nOnce that is done, there are 7400 [description] blocks to write.\nIt's really, really, not a small task. However, for the purpose of the defs it's just the [type]s that need replacing for now.. Thanks to a huge PR from @orblazer and a bunch of work I did over the weekend we're down from 1069 unknown types to just 579 remaining. Should easily be able to complete all of those this week..

If you need to tweak the code for whatever reason please submit a new PR.. roundPixels can help in some cases, but not all. For example, if you were to zoom the camera by a non-integer value you'd also see this happen.\nYou'd think this would be supported by tools like Tiled but it only partially is. Tiled supports margin and spacing between tiles, which the Tiled docs state is the area in which tiles can bleed to avoid display issues like this. But to create that bleed effect is on your own back :(\nThis is quite a common problem, so there are various little utils out there. A cursory search found things like the Allegro extruder: https://www.allegro.cc/forums/thread/616156 or this Java based tool: https://forum.starling-framework.org/topic/tool-for-extruding-tile-edges-for-tilesets-no-more-bleeding and several others.\nIt's frustrating because it adds another step into your workflow. Plus I can't guarantee those utils will do what you need (I didn't test them, just searched for them) - it is, however, how you resolve it.\nPerhaps we ought to create a cli / web based tile extruder for this purpose.\n. Yes, because Loader.reset doesn't remove any previously bound event listeners, because people were complaining that when the Scene finished loading (and reset the Loader) their event listeners were lost too.

Can now get this in 3.2.0 - thank you :). Yeah, sorry, we're going through and fixing these as fast as we can (there are quite a lot!). Hi - This is fixed in the master branch already, and will be pushed to npm today with the 3.1.0 release.. Having just finished running eslint on the whole codebase, eol-last was respected everywhere bar one file. The most common issue was redeclared vars, but they're all fixed now. The entire codebase passes our config (3rd party libs excluded). Our config is set to error if a newline is missing:\n\"eol-last\": [ \"error\" ]\nWhich it does (providing you run eslint using our config, although pretty sure the default for eol-last is to warn anyway.) Change error to off or warn and it'll allow them through.. Good idea, added.. generateTexture returns the Graphics instance itself, so you'd need to do:\ngraphics.generateTexture('someUniqueKey', width, height);\nthis.add.sprite(100, 100, 'someUniqueKey');\n. No worries, glad you got it working.. Please see the new Game.resize function that is ready for testing in the master branch. This will resize the renderer, input system and game config values accordingly. If you find errors with it please open a new issue specific to them, thank you.. Thank you for submitting this feature request. We have implemented this and the feature has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. Sweet, thanks @pixelpicosean . Sorry, yes, there's no such thing as a Phaser.Event class. We are tidying up all the examples this week to avoid confusions like this, sorry for wasting your time.. Thanks, have merged and added to the change log.. Headless mode is now supported in the master branch. Please test.. Nice one.. This example is now fixed, thank you.. Thank you for submitting this issue. We have fixed this and the fix has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. Above examples work fine in Chrome on OS X for me, both in the 3.12 dev build and 3.11. This issue is 6 months old now. If you can reproduce this across more than just your Mac, then open it as a new issue and we can investigate.. Thank you for submitting this issue. We have fixed this and the fix has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. No, but I don't think it matters in this case - as what it's demonstrating is that Tweens are not checking if targets still exist or not before trying to modify their properties.\nIf you do nuke a Game Object outside of the game step (i.e. via setTimeout) then on your head be it really, but I think there's still an issue here to fix.\nI've updated the code in master so a TweenData will now check to see if a target exists before updating it, but this still may not be enough. What we may require is that when you destroy a Game Object it doesn't actually do anything, it just flags it as destroyed, and then added to a purge list which is cleared at the end of the Scene step. This should help avoid race conditions like you'd get with setTimeout, but it also means your code would have to assume and account for the fact it may be a whole frame before the object is actually removed.. I added a conditional check into the 3.1.2 release that addresses this issue, so a Tween will no longer update an undefined target. I'm still tempted to look at using a destroy queue though. For now, please test 3.1.2 against this situation.. Thanks for spotting this!. Sorry you wasted some time on this! It's actually caused by a bug in the particle renderer that was introduced with 3.1.1, but didn't exist in 3.0.0 when the example was written. We've since fixed it, so if you build from master you'll find it works again :) and it will be released in 3.1.2 which will be out shortly!. Yes, sorry about this (see #3274) - all fixed in 3.1.2 which is now live on the site and published to the examples too, so should be good now. Also fixed that 404.. Thank you for taking the time to work on this and open your issue. However, Phaser 2 is now maintained in the Phaser CE GitHub repo. Also, as this is more of a support question rather than a potential bug in the framework, you may find you get a more helpful response from the Phaser 2 Forum, rather than GitHub.. Strange, the Making your first game tutorial I wrote uses sprite vs. Group and group vs. group and it works for overlap and collide. What\u2019s the difference between how I do it and your approach?. A Physics Group is basically just a Group with a couple helper methods. The important part is this: https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/master/src/physics/arcade/World.js#L1395-L1409 which should work on any Group, because they all set the 'isParent' property..

If you need to tweak the code for whatever reason please submit a new PR.. Thanks for tidying this up. Merging for 3.2.. This feature has been added. I didn't want to add it to Tween.stop because of the resetTo argument, but I think this works well enough as its own method.. Sorry about that, none of the drag examples had been updated. I have fixed them all today, so check out the latest versions in the repo / on labs and you'll see how to get dragging working!. Hi - Sorry, but I'm going to close this issue because I'd like to see data like this shared on the forum, rather than on here. I try to keep GitHub issues specifically for bugs related to the API. For more general discussion, such as this, please use a more suitable location. I'm not aware of any hard stats comparing v2 to v3 yet. We have our own internal tests but I'd question the value of sharing them because they're specific to our use-case. I'm sure it's perfectly possible to construct (or require) a project for which performance differences we see are not as prominent.. Lovely, thanks.. I did think about doing this automatically but hit the problem whereby it wasn't possible to tell if you'd manually set your own origin on a sprite, then if you play an animation it would overwrite that origin with whatever was set on each frame (same goes for dimensions) - I guess maybe that's just something you have to put up with if you play an animation (losing any previously set origin)\nIt should probably use the frame anchor / pivot relative to the origin and never actually change it, but that will require quite a refactor internally first.. Our class is a port of Nonsense - I just checked their code and I think this issue is present in that library too (for the same reasons quite likely) - happy to receive a PR for this if you fancy trying it?. You're right, it should update y regardless. It's actually been like this in Phaser for years and years now! Amazed no-one spotted it before. I also fixed another issue with the input system scale today, which will now allow scaling to work regardless of canvas scale, translation or position.. These have now all been fixed - which uncovered a bug with drop zones, which is now fixed in the master branch too.. Are you using the Phaser 3 webpack project template? It has special build flags in the config that you'll need.. Closing off this issue as I've added to the readme the importance of using our webpack config.. I'm afraid I'm going to close this issue. Not because we're not adding Containers, they are in R&D at the moment. But because I want GitHub issues to be used for actual code / implementation issues with the API. My perfect world is 'Issues: 0' (like inbox zero), with nothing lingering about.\nIn order for you to use this issue to track development we would have to remember to keep updating it, or referencing the issue number in our commits, and frankly, this is just too much work for us. I'd rather you Watch the repo and monitor from there, or keep track in the Dev Logs for a more casual observation of progress.. Thanks for opening this issue, and for submitting a PR to fix it. We have merged your PR into the master branch and attributed the work to you in the Change Log. If you need to tweak the code for whatever reason please submit a new PR.. \ud83d\udc4d . Nice one, thanks.. Can you post your code for the Menu scene as well please.. This is working properly in 3.4. I've updated the example to show how to use it properly with a window event + tile sprite: http://labs.phaser.io/view.html?src=src\\game%20config\\game%20resize.js. Sorry, this fell by the wayside. Yes, this happens on purpose but isn't made clear in the docs. Camera 3D support is being removed from core and moved to a plugin with 3.12, so I'll look to address it from there.. I've had a look into this and the scaling is correct based on the perspective of the Camera. If you wish you can stop the objects from being scaled vertically (or horizontally) by setting the adjustScaleX/Y booleans, or you could change the amount of distortion by changing the fov of the camera.. Feel free.. Nope. I don't have a Mac to test on, so it will need someone else to jump in. Although I'm curious why it's even trying to use HTML5Audio at all, it should be using WebAudio.. I\u2019ll keep this open because old school Audio should still work on Safari, but you absolutely don\u2019t want to use it unless forced to.. Yeah :( I fixed it earlier today though, master is safe now.. Thank you for spending time reporting this issue. However, we've already fixed this in the master branch of Phaser and it will be part of the next official release.

If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. There are no plans to add any gradient support to Graphics. It's trivial under Canvas, but absolutely not trivial to do in WebGL.\nx/y properties to generateTexture are a nice idea and relatively easy to implement, although it bugs me we'd have to change the method signature to put them first. They could come after the w/h definition but that feels a bit backwards.. this.textures.addBase64('key', base64Data);\nNote that you must listen out for the onload event from the Texture Manager before you can use the base64 texture in a game object.\n. https://supernapie.com/blog/loading-assets-as-data-uri-in-phaser-3. There is no addChild method available in v3. Containers / Transform Nodes are in development. Please see the newsletter for details in the coming weeks.. Correct, there are no plans to add anything visual to Groups (such as masks) as they are non-exclusive collections of Game Objects. We will discuss it for Containers.. It won't reduce anything for the Phaser build files, because we explicitly define exactly what will be exported. If you import Phaser then you are given everything we set as being part of the core API. You can alternatively create your own entry point that exports exactly what you need and nothing more. Tree shaking is brilliant for your games, but less useful for a library where we need full control over what is included or not in the build.\nIf you want to create your own bundle then look at the differences between src/phaser.js and src/phaser-arcade-physics.js as those are our 2 current entry points. The first is basically \"everything including the kitchen sink\", the second is a more streamlined package. But you can take it even further, choosing exactly what you want in your bundle..

If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. \ud83d\udc4d . Lovely, thank you.. Don't use game.scene - always go via the Scene itself: this.scene.start() so it uses the ScenePlugin correctly.. Happy to add this to 3.3.0..

If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. If there is no debug layer then Matter itself won't render or display anything as we do not bundle any of the Matter renderer files in our build. The default Matter.Body object doesn't have a render.fillStyle property.\nI suspect the Matter renderer injects that into the render object as part of the body config, but it's not a default property, so our debug sweep in World.postUpdate doesn't check for it either. I guess it could do so at the cost of adding another conditional in the middle of the render loop. Then again it's just for debugging so maybe the cost isn't too bad and the benefit of setting a per-body line style would be more useful than the expense of it.. You could use a similar approach to how the Matter debug works. Create your own 'rope' object that has a Graphics instance and then creates the matter bodies needed for it, and then draw to the graphics as needed. This way you can isolate single objects (i.e. have lots of ropes) and control the placement of them within the Scene. They would almost become like their own sprites.\nThe Debug layer is just one giant Graphics object that every single body draws to, it's not meant for use in an actual game (although I guess that depends how complex the game is, for really basic ones it may be ok).

If you need to tweak the code for whatever reason please submit a new PR.. Thank you for submitting this issue. We have fixed this and the fix has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. This seems to work fine for chaining things:\nthis.add.text(100, 200, 'Phaser').setStyle({ fontFamily: 'Arial', fontSize: 64, color: '#00ff00' }).setFill('#ff0000');\nIt only returns the TextStyle object back if you call style.setStyle directly and explicitly tell it to not update the text parent object (the 2nd argument, which is true by default). Thank you for submitting this issue. We have fixed this and the fix has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. I'm happy with this fix, just not how it's implemented. The resolution never changes, so we can cache it in a local var before the for loop, to avoid the config object look-up for every object.. Thanks. The jsdoc default value needs updating too, but I'll do that.. It\u2019s flagged as complex because it requires a significant refactor to the internals, the creation of a new plugin and changes to how Groups work. To do this right touches lots of elements.. This will conflict with Group.preUpdate, which calls the update of any children automatically. So some objects could potentially have their update called twice per step. I can see what this is trying to do, but I think we need to find a slightly different way to do it.. As it stands, the problem will be the execution order.  UpdateList runs early on, as it's one of the core scene plugins. Clock, Input, Loader and Tweens all update after it. Most the time you'd want GameObject.update called after all of the plugins have run their updates. And in some cases, it would be useful to have the GameObjects update before that happened.\nMore importantly though, I don't want to add every single Game Object to the UpdateList. As it will have to iterate them all, every frame, and in most cases the majority of them won't actually do anything.\nI'm happy to remove the update call from Group, but we still need a slightly different way to handle it, because I'm not willing to call update on every single Game Object created. The Scene emits an update event which could be hooked in to. Or we could add a method (or an argument to setActive) that inserts it into an UpdateList (and we rename UpdateList to PreUpdateList, as that is actually what it is). Well, that's an edge case and then some! Will have a think about implications of stopping a scene during preload.. This isn't actually used internally anyway, so is safe to remove from the webgl context config.. Thank you for submitting this issue.

Thanks for opening this issue, and for submitting a PR to fix it. We have merged your PR into the master branch and attributed the work to you in the Change Log. If you need to tweak the code for whatever reason please submit a new PR.. I think it needs adding as a Dynamic Text object. Like we have Dynamic and Static BitmapText, the current Text is 'static', but we could add a Dynamic variant which offered features like this without impacting the speed of the original.. It will be part of the new Scale Manager (to do it automatically) but it isn't always desirable, which is why it doesn't happen atm.. \ud83d\udc4d . Looks good to me: http://labs.phaser.io/view.html?src=src\\display\\tint\\tile%20sprite%20tint.js\nNote this is a WebGL only feature. We do flag it as such in the jsdocs, but I appreciate they're not live yet so wouldn't have been seen.. In the first screenshot, you call Matter.Image and pass the scene as the first argument. It should be the Matter World instance, not the Scene:\nMatterImage (world, x, y, texture, frame, options)\nHave a look at the Factory.js in the matter-js folder for an example.. The error was caused because you were doing load.spritesheet and passing that as the tileset, instead of load.image. It worked in canvas because it didn't use the tile size for the UV data. However, we've updated the WebGL renderer for static layers to support this, so you can now actually pass in an image or a spritesheet, and it'll just treat the sheet as a plain image. This is now fixed in master.. Thank you for submitting this issue. We have fixed this and the fix has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. Groups are no longer exclusive, a single GameObject can exist in many Groups, so it can't be automatically removed as part of the destroy process. A Group could listen for the destroy event from a child though, and remove if it receives that.. This feature is now implemented in the master branch.. This is superb, thank you. I think I'm going to have to expand out things like this {{origin:Phaser.Math.Vector3,direction:Phaser.Math.Vector3}} into actual TypeDefs blocks, but otherwise this is a superb amount of work and gets us even closer.. Rats, I had literally just done the Input ones too!! I'll merge yours and then manually merge in mine, because I was replacing [description] tags too :). Yeah don't worry, I'm only replacing the [descriptions] when they're really short and easy! I've merged in my changes and pushed them up. There were a couple of mistakes for the types I fixed, but nothing massive.\nIf you're doing Matter now then I'll do the /display/ ones.\nMatter will be quite tricky where the objects are Matter objects (like engine and composite) and outside of the Phaser namespace. Not entirely sure what we should do there.. Don't worry about the descriptions for now. Types are more important (and there aren't many left! woohoo!!). Just pushed my changes. Other than Matter that is everything done now I think! I'm now going to write a script to dump out every single data-type into a list, so we can scan it for errors / typos.. If you've done any work on Matter then push that up now and I can finish it off.\nI'm happy to swap all 'object' types for TypeDefs, it will make the jsdocs nicer too.. Ok no worries, I'll do Matter now then.. Lovely, merged.\nI've been getting rid of return types that are in-lined objects and swapping to TypeDefs or actual instances.\nAlso, please be aware of the case for these: {Object.<string, any>} (should be {object.<string, any>}.. I need to head off for a bit, will carry on later tonight.. Just to add, I've been using this to check the return types from functions: http://phaser.io/newdocs/3.0.0/types this will bring up a list of all distinct return types, then you can filter down to see what returns them. Handy for figuring out typos, etc :). Could be really useful, so have merged this in. I think I'm going to expand it slightly to pass over the camera instance to the callback too.. Very nice :) I'm working on this again now, so I'm going to do all of the events and move them to their own special file and start adding in @fires tags where missing.. Thank you for submitting this issue. We have fixed this and the fix has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. It's not possible to make the site repo public. If someone spots something and tells me, I'll fix it.. I've updated the polyfill to avoid the use of window in the function invocation, which will hopefully get around this. However, window is used extensively elsewhere in v3, so this may be a high road to nowhere. Give it a try though!. Thank you for submitting this issue.

You should never change the origin of a game object that has a matter body, they\u2019re calculated to match the physic bodies centre of mass. If you need to offset it from that you can do so using the xOffset and yOffset values when creating the shape.. Lovely. Please remove the dist files from your PR so I can merge it.. Text doesn't call preUpdate because it doesn't need to (it has nothing to update, so why waste an empty call every frame?) - however, this is tightly related to #3379 and the discussion there is relevant.. This is how it's supposed to work (as Mike has explained, thanks) - I'm going to keep the bodyA/B arguments and just make sure the docs state they're the FIRST matching pair in the result set, but it's up to you to figure out the rest..

No worries, I'm working on it at the moment.. Sorry, but no. Phaser 3 is 100% ES5 and this one small change will break it entirely.. The problem with doing it like this is that it overrides frames that have custom pivot points, such as those exported from Texture Packer where the pivot has been positoned carefully in order to prevent what you're seeing here..

The Keyboard event emitter is global (shared between all Scenes), so there's no way to automatically clear out events set in a specific Scene.\nThe proper use-case in this scenario would be to listen for the 2 key specifically using a once event (i.e. once('keyup_TWO')), or to clear the listeners out in your Scene shutdown method..

For anyone else coming to this issue: There are lots of cases of this (not just in Config.js), some are valid, some are not. The rules are:\n1) If you see a ? at the start of a data-type (not the name) it means it is nullable. These should only be set for class properties. For configuration objects the ? is not required.\n2) If you see a ? at the start of a property / parameter name then it's a mistake and should be removed.\nClosing this issue because the relevant PR is now merged.. I'm happy to merge this because config object properties are never nullable, only class properties are.. Wonderful, thank you :). Lovely, thank you!. I don\u2019t think so, because devs will just use that event instead, cram it full of loop breaking calls and wonder where all these random errors come from. I think I\u2019d prefer to just offer a dom safe means of opening a new window and keep it as far away from the internal input as possible. Will have a think once 3.4 is out..

I guess we could allow this as long as people don't mind their progress bars jumping all over the place when new files are added in.

It's because the fade rectangle is drawn over the top of the flash one (to enable you to still carry on doing flash effects while fading out a camera) and fadeIn uses the flash rect, but it has a full black fade rect over it from the fade out.

Please, could you have a look at the master branch and test it out if you get a chance. The method signatures have changed slightly (the callback is now an onUpddate one, not onComplete) and there are new events and properties that can be used. See the new examples in labs for details but I also finished all jsdocs for Camera class, which should help too :).

All Game Objects use the same method of registering themselves with the GameObjectCreator / Factory, so it's not the code above causing it.

Never used React in my life, but you can pass in external objects to the Scene like this:\nscene: {\n        preload: preload,\n        create: create,\n        extend: {\n            hello: 1,\n            test: 'atari',\n            addImage: addImage\n        }\n    }\nFrom within the Scene methods (like create) you can now access this.hello, this.test and the function this.addImage - using this approach you could easily define some references back to your react component..

Even using a forEach approach it's still not going to cope well with significant additions or, or deletions from, the bodies array during the update loop. Other systems in v3 use a Process Queue approach instead, so the main array is never modified during key processing, and I think Impact would benefit from it here too. Will add it to our task list..

Each Scene has its own World instance, so starting a new Scene shouldn't matter. However, restarting a current Scene (or restarting a previously stopped one) may skip the Scene boot. Will have a look.. Yeah, it's a much wider problem actually.. Ok, have spent quite a while addressing how Scene plugins handle the Scene lifecycle events and it feels a lot more solid now. Changes are in master and there's a new test up on examples too: http://labs.phaser.io/view.html?src=src\\physics\\arcade\\restart%20physics%20scene.js\nNeed to do the same for Matter now, but should be ok I hope.. Created a Matter one too, all working :). It's been on my list for a while - there were other little side effects that happened before this change, like restarting a scene wouldn't pick-up the physics config correctly when it recreated the world. Feels a lot better now but will carry on testing.. Agreed, as I can't replicate this yet. There must be some specific way to trigger it happening.. Thank you for submitting this Pull Request. I just wanted to explain why I didn't merge it. The concept is fine (a filecomplete event) but the point at which it's being fired was the issue. The problem is that when someone receives a complete event they rightly expect the file to be, well ... complete :) but at this point in the flow it isn't. It's not until the file has been added to a cache or the texture manager and can be used by a Game Object that it's truly complete. I have implemented this into the Loader today and it will be part of the next release. So again, thank you for your PR and putting effort into this. filecomplete now exists as an event and will be available in 3.7.0.. Thank you for your input.

Where does this part go?\n```\nvar fs = require('fs');\nrequire.extensions['.frag'] = function (module, filename) {\n    module.exports = fs.readFileSync(filename, 'utf8');\n};\n```\nAs it can't go in the Phaser source.\n. Ahh ok - it'd still try and bundle in the whole of fs for any other packager though, which seems a tad much, but better than not working at all I guess.. Can require.extensions take multiple extensions? As it needs to cover both .frag and .vert files. Perhaps: require.extensions['.frag', '.vert'] ?. Documentation needs to be provided via PRs to the main repo. If it's extensive, i.e. adds lots of text into the source, then we'll need to extract it out into single files and reference via a jsdoc @tutorial tag to avoid making the code unmaintainable.\nPlease understand that Phaser 2 wasn't born with documentation, it took many years to build it up and tweak it. Phaser 3 is barely 2 months old and being refined daily.\nAs it stands there are 6,922 elements in v3 that need documenting (it was a thousand more than this a month ago). Even at a super-fast rate of 1 minute per element (which is highly unrealistic when averaged out), that's still nearly 40 days worth of work, assuming 3hrs per day dedicated to documenting, and no days off.\nSo yes, if people want to help, we'll gladly accept it via PRs, because it's one hell of a mammoth task.. Not built-in, no. But it could be useful so I'll consider it a feature request. If you need something more immediate, ask on the forum / slack.. This issue is currently blocked pending development of the Scale Manager, which will begin during the month of May 2018. It will be updated once it has been tested against the new Scale Manager.. It's not built into v2 (there's no Gradient feature anywhere) - you would have had to create a Canvas or BitmapData, then draw the gradient onto that, then use that as a texture for a Sprite. You can do the same in v3:\n```\nvar canvasTexture = this.textures.createCanvas('yourTextureKey', 320, 200);\nvar src = canvasTexture.getSourceImage();\nvar ctx = src.getContext('2d');\n// do gradient ops here\nthis.add.image(0, 0, 'yourTextureKey');\n```\n. If you're using webpack you need to update your config to match our new one. Specifically this part:\nnew webpack.DefinePlugin({\n            \"typeof SHADER_REQUIRE\": JSON.stringify(false),\n            \"typeof CANVAS_RENDERER\": JSON.stringify(true),\n            \"typeof WEBGL_RENDERER\": JSON.stringify(true)\n        }),\n. They should all have typeof in (as per my config from above) - otherwise, I'm not sure Webpack replaces them properly, but as they're both 'true' by default you don't notice it in the bundle.. \ud83d\udc4d .

Yup, all good!. Wonder if it might just be easier to create an add method instead, that does a similar thing as it can be called via the game.plugins reference.. Fair enough, but I don't want to do this via Boot, it doesn't make any sense (grammatically I mean), so will look at moving it elsewhere.. @doubleprincez we have no control over it, contact GitHub support directly.

Closing this off as the new plugin system is coming in 3.8 and we've moved namespace to Phaser.Plugins and made sure it's exposed :). It's quite normal for game frameworks to have x/y represent the center. You can just do this.add.image(x, y, key).setOrigin(0) if you want to have x/y represent the top-left instead. There are no plans to make a configurable 'global' origin as it would introduce an extra look-up for every single GO created, which isn't worth it when it's so simple to adjust the origin at run-time..

How much this matters depends on what you've got in your game, but you're now using double of everything (or more), so the impact is going to scale linearly..

How much this matters depends on what you've got in your game, but you're now using double of everything (or more), so the impact is going to scale linearly.. With a x2 resolution that's now a 2560 x 1600 canvas, which might well be too large for that device to cope with. If the fps drops that much it sounds like it's hitting the fillrate limit, or having to do something internally that the GPU doesn't like (maybe it has a max texture size of 2048? I don't know) - in short, that's a lot of pixels to handle for a mobile browser. Honestly, it's more than some desktops can handle smoothly too. It might be worth removing Phaser entirely and just trying it out with a bog standard vanilla JS and a canvas and see what happens, there are a few helper WebGL libs out there that would get you up to speed quickly..

Yeah, this ought to be covered somehow - visible has no parent look-up taking place, i.e. a child could think it is visible, but its parent or a parent of a parent isn't, and it doesn't know about it. It's frustrating because to derive it we'll have to do a parent look-up every time you check the visible property. Will have a think about it some more to try and avoid that for non-container elements..

The cost I'm talking about comes from having to do this:\nif (this.parentContainer)\n{\n  // look-up all parents to see if any of them return false\n}\nWhich you would have to do for every Game Object, every time it tests if it's visible or not. Adding in this check is a cost on its own, never mind the look-up itself. Globally adding this check to every Game Object impacts performance negatively, even if you're not using Containers at all..

Even adding extra properties like that just adds to the overall complexity / size of every object, even if they don't touch a container in their game. I think it would just be easier to limit the visible look-up check to the input handler alone, or alternatively setting visible = false on a Container immediately passes that value down to all children, so their visible property gets changed too. Then the input system doesn't need updating. It does mean you could then turn a specific child 'back on' again, and it won't render but it'd still pick-up input, but perhaps that's a limitation worth living with..

Let's just remove the check entirely.. \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\udc4d . In the first couple of examples above you're creating extra cameras, but neither of them has been given a position or dimension. So they're effectively \"full screen\" cameras stacked on-top of each other, which means that only the top-most camera will process the input events (which is what appears to be happening, because if I mouse over the scrolling arrow, the event fires).\nDuring the input tests the pointer will start out by determining which camera it is over (it'll always return the top-most one if you've got a stack of cameras) and only process events for that one camera. It will never iterate down through any other cameras in the list.\nSo basically, it was working exactly as it was designed to.\nHowever, I can see how it may be useful for the Pointer to iterate the camera list should it not interact with anything in the top-most camera, so I have added this feature in. I'll keep an eye on performance, but I think in most cases (where you only have 1 camera) it should be fine. If it does add undue processing, for what is likely quite an edge-case requirement, I'll swap to using a linked list or similar for the cameras.

Finally had a look at this, and the Scenes swap position because they use moveAbove and moveBelow in the transition configs, which moves them around the Scene list. I'm happy this is doing what it's meant to do.\nThe question is if they should only move for the duration of the transition and then move back again after it completes?

It's not great, but until I rewrite both Containers and the way masks work (or someone submits a PR), it's going to remain like it for now.. Glad you got it working. Doesn\u2019t change the fact it\u2019s still a significant API update to get the feature request in.. Well, this sucks. I tried swapping a few component methods to returns {this} to see what happens, and JSDoc just doesn't care. It treats it as a reserved word. The output doesn't contain the correct data type at all :(\nI can see this was requested as a feature https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc/issues/991 but was closed almost immediately, so it appears it's something that TypeScript can do, but JSDoc itself can't. Not entirely sure what to do. I don't want the docs to suffer just for the benefit of TS devs. Will have a look to see if we could implement this in our own jsdoc plugin, but I cannot merge this until we've solved it :(. Outside of TypeScripts, IDEs like Webstorm use the jsdoc types to provide intellisense, so unless an actual type is returned they would break, which isn't a change I'm comfortable with. I don't think it would take much to create a plugin for this, will have a look at it.. After several hours of wrangling with jsdoc I managed to create a plugin that will convert return {this} into the relevant data type in the generated docs, while keeping {this} in the source code, which should solve both issues. The plugin is in the docs repo and appears to work fine, so I will review this PR again tomorrow and it should be good to merge in as-is.. Thank you for submitting this PR. Although I'm not going to merge it, the feature did get implemented into the Camera class, so followOffset is now a property you can use, and we credited it to you in the Change Log.. It turned out to be quicker to just have it as a zeroed vec2 by default than to add in 2 ternaries in the main loop. That's about the only difference between what I implemented and your original.. If they overlapped it wouldn't set blocked anyway, because it didn't happen as part of the separation - I think it should be safe to make this change. It would also allow you to do things like an onFloor check with a dynamic body standing on a static one.. Thank you for submitting this feature request. We have implemented this and the feature has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. It doesn't have gameObject as an argument because it's the scope of the event. So within the event listener using this refers to the gameObject.. This is normal when the textures are not prepared properly, it's the bleeding from one edge to another. It can be solved by using a package like Texture Packer or Shoebox to prepare your atlases, and make sure you enable the frame border / pixel extruding feature (which is on by default.) You can find out the technical reasons behind it by searching for 'texture bleeding'.. The easiest way is to just set a collision group in the constraint options:\nhttp://labs.phaser.io/view.html?src=src\\physics\\matterjs\\drag%20filter%20with%20pointer.js\nNot sure this needs new constraint methods as you can pass it in easily enough (and for a constraint it's unlikely to change beyond creation either)\nIf you're going to use matter then it's well worth spending some time learning about how it handles collision groups and filters internally, which you can find in the matter.js docs.. Is there a good reason you want all your assets as data URIs? They are bigger, waste more space in your bundle, offer no compression benefits and generally slow things down as they have to be processed in and out of the string format to the final texture. There is literally no benefit to using them in a game.. I'm sorry, but this is such a bad practice to have all assets as base64 URLs to begin with that it's not something I'm going to natively support in the Loader. Your workaround above will have to be something you implement directly in your own code. But I would strongly suggest you spend the time sorting out a better workflow / file organisation structure for your projects instead.. Not yet supported, will be part of the Input Manager work we do shortly. Already on our internal road map, so keep an eye on the Change Log in future versions to see when it has been implemented. There is no fixed date for this.. It\u2019s not a feature in v3. There are no immediate plans to add it, but I\u2019ll leave it open as a feature request for now.. Please don\u2019t expend any effort on this as we have no intentions of moving the codebase to anything else this year.. It will take months to recode the API properly in TS and there is literally no point doing it if it\u2019s not going to be done properly. That is time we simply don\u2019t have. There are far, far more important things to do first.\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not saying no. But definitely not this year.. I honestly think you\u2019re vastly underestimating the scale of work involved here just to do it, never mind keep pace with the current speed of development. I would urge you again to not try and take this on. If you genuinely want to help the project there are far more important things to be done, that would actually benefit all end users, rather than just a handful of them.. @johanlindfors I think you're misunderstanding what is being discussed in this thread. This isn't about Phaser working with TypeScript, which it does, we've been providing and enhancing the defs for months now, it's about recoding the whole of Phaser entirely IN TypeScript, which isn't something I ever agreed to and certainly won't entertain doing this year.. There are some really nice v3 + TS boilerplates out there that should help speed that up for you. The defs are in the docs repo at the moment, updated each time we release a new build, and will be merged into the main repo / typings once we've happy they are more stable (mostly when we've figured out the best way to document the events), but lots of people use them already. If you do find any bugs in them, open up an issue and we'll fix it in the jsdocs, so the parser corrects it on the next export.. Yes I love VS Code. Use it for all dev now.\nOnce v3 has settled down I will definitely explore converting to either ES6 or TypeScript.. Yes I love VS Code. Use it for all dev now.\nOnce v3 has settled down I will definitely explore converting to either ES6 or TypeScript.. I'm not going to move to ES6 and then move to TS, that's just pointless. When the time comes I'll evaluate the tooling available for both, and pick one of them.. Doesn't really matter what the standard is called, even today you still can't use it natively.. We work with a number of very large clients that have IE9 as their baseline, which is why it has always been the baseline of Phaser and remains to be so. You can't 'code natively in ES6' and target that without transpiling. So if you're going to transpile anyway (be it from ES6 or from TS) then it comes down to comparing the tooling and features of each approach more than anything.. Did you read any of the above comments at all? Or was it easier to just weigh-in and spout the obvious?\n. None of the biggest or most popular frameworks are written in TypeScript.\nMost of them offer defs files which have either been generated from source or hand created, just like Phaser does. None of them have been 100% error free.\nBecause there seems to be a real problem with reading in this thread let me be painfully clear. Again. Because I\u2019ve nothing better to do with my time:\n1) No-one in their right mind would write a framework in ES6 and then publish it bundled in that same format, without transpiling it, because adoption is 87% at the most optimistic, never mind what clients need. So tools HAVE to be involved. Those tools weren\u2019t even a fraction as good as they are today when we started v3.\n2) Rewriting the API in either es6 or ts is a massive, massive task. Literally months of work. There are far more important things to do first. Especially as there are no benefits for end users, and questionable benefits for most devs. The only real benefit of recoding in TS is that the defs will be perfect. This is not a strong enough reason to halt production on all the things we have planned. Type safety would be useful, but the vast majority of issues we face are unrelated to that. Mostly they\u2019re logic or structural problems, which no language protects against.\n3) When the time comes we will evaluate the tooling around both options, because we\u2019ll bundle for ES5 no matter what. Until then the defs will continue to improve.\nIf someone is incapable of using a framework because it\u2019s not written in TS, good luck with that. Don\u2019t let the door hit you on the way out. For everyone else, keep on helping improve the defs please.\n. Hah, no worries. It's just frustrating because I literally couldn't have been more clear on this issue, yet still it gets misread by some.\nYes, it will be rewritten in TS or ES6 at some point but it's absolutely not a priority because of the scale of the task involved vs. other things that need doing first..

Thank you for the clarification @cyberhck - however, I really don't want this done piecemeal, one file at a time. There seems to be no real benefit doing it that way for anyone involved. It'd complicate the work I'm doing and there is no way the community will manage to keep-up with the current state of changes in the API.\nTake a look at the 3.12 Beta 1 Change Log and look at how extensive that is for just 24 days of work. It's a kind of velocity that would be really hard for anyone in the community to keep up with, and nor would I want them to try and do so. It makes a lot more sense that once the API is in a state I'm happy with that we just put all features on hold and port the entire thing to ES6 or TS.\nThat will happen, and I'm more than happy to do the work myself, it just simply cannot happen yet.\nWhen I said none of the popular libs use TS I really meant game frameworks. And to be honest, other than Angular and ember, most of your examples are end-user apps. The overwhelming majority of frameworks (of all kind) just provide TS defs (if at all!), but are not written in it. This makes no difference to what I'll choose when the time comes, it just grates a little that so many people keep going on about how it should be written in TS, yet the reality of it is that very little else (of the magnitude of Phaser) actually is..

Issues are for reporting issues with the API.. launch will start a Scene running in parallel to the current ones. You should be calling scene.restart if restarting the same Scene. And you absolutely need to listen for the Scene shutdown event and then clear out anything you've created yourself. Even then, restart won't call the Scene constructor again. It will just restart the Scene, which is the same as shutting it down then starting it again, not creating it from scratch.\nI would suggest you destroy the current Scene, then start a brand new one, using a brand new key. That is the only way it will run the constructor again. Would be easiest to make your old Scene start the new one, then in the new Scene it destroys the old one.. Thanks for this. I've merged it in and emitters now work inside containers, but it's also added a bunch of methods (like setAlpha) which don't do anything, so I think I'll tweak it to resolve that (you'll still get credit in the change log though). It happens because when the drag event starts it sets the input.dragX/Y values to be the difference between the position of the pointer and game objects position. Those values are then used throughout the drag event as an offset for the pointer position. But you're changing the offset immediately by adjusting the scale. so the offset is no longer correct, and the more you scale it, the more incorrect it becomes.\nThis is quite an edge case but worth supporting I guess, it'll mean it'll have to recalculate the offset every frame which is a pain (right now it does it just once at the start) but probably worth doing all the same. Will have a think about it, as I'm redoing the input system for 3.10 anyway.. I've changed my mind about this one, it won't be supported natively because it's trivial to support in your drag callback:\ngameObject.x = pointer.x;\n        gameObject.y = pointer.y;\nUse that instead of the dragX and dragY values and it'll work fine.. No, don\u2019t use Containers if you want full control over depth sorting in this way.. What exactly is the issue being reported here? because Container hit areas are working as intended in 3.9 and this won't be changing in 3.10. Please post some code demonstrating the problem.. This is because the hit area shapes are centered on the Container. So in your code, you create a hit area rectangle that is 360 x 640, but the center of that rectangle is the Container x/y, which is why clicks only \"work\" in the top-left of your list view, because all of your children are positioned as if the Container x/y is the top-left.\nTo solve it you can do this in your measure function:\nthis.input.hitArea.x += this.w / 2;\nthis.input.hitArea.y += this.h / 2;\n.

Sorry, should have checked first - this was solved in 3.11 by making sure all of the Scene ops were queued instead of run immediately. The original code now works properly in 3.11 and above.. This actually required a complete rewrite of the KeyboardManager. It was a global class before, not bound to a Scene, and therefore objects and events created on it applied to any Scene in your game, not just those in which they were defined.\nI can see how it would be useful to have this on a Scene level though. So I have created an Input Plugin system, and moved the keyboard class to it, so it's now one of the new input plugins and self-registers with the Scene input system. This means every Scene has its own instance of the keyboard plugin, which means it won't emit events (or process Key objects) for sleeping / inactive Scenes, giving full separation. It also uses more resources, but you can disable it on a per-Scene basis using the Scene config, so if you've got a Scene that doesn't need input, or keyboard input, you can disable either / or.\nThis is now in the master branch.. The json you're using to test this has a custom anchor point defined in it, which overrides the setOrigin:\n{\n                    \"filename\": \"diamond_0009\",\n                    \"frame\": {\n                        \"x\": 744,\n                        \"y\": 2,\n                        \"w\": 37,\n                        \"h\": 60\n                    },\n                    \"rotated\": false,\n                    \"trimmed\": true,\n                    \"spriteSourceSize\": {\n                        \"x\": 14,\n                        \"y\": 2,\n                        \"w\": 37,\n                        \"h\": 60\n                    },\n                    \"sourceSize\": {\n                        \"w\": 64,\n                        \"h\": 64\n                    },\n                    \"anchor\": {\n                        \"x\": 0.5,\n                        \"y\": 1\n                    }\n                }\nSo this is behaving as I'd expect. If you want to specify the origin yourself, the frame data should have no anchor property.. Why would the duration ever be zero unless the dev had made a configuration error when creating it? \nSurely this is something we can trap during the init of the tween, rather than checking it every single frame.. I still there must be a cleaner way of doing it than checking for such an edge-case every single frame, for every single tween.. Thank you for taking the time to work on this and open your issue. However, this is a Phaser 2 issue (as addColor isn't available in Phaser 3), which is now maintained in the Phaser CE GitHub repo. If the issue still exists in Phaser CE then please submit your PR there and I'm sure the community will be only too happy to look at it.. That screen shot doesn't look like a roundPixels or pixelArt issue, it looks like a standard WebGL issue when sprite sheets aren't correctly prepared for GL textures and get pixel bleeding from edge frames.\npixelArt will enable linear texture mapping for any GL texture Phaser creates. It's not possible to enable on a per-Sprite basis, because Sprites share textures, and it's a texture level setting.. Sorry, my comments above were directed at @bonsaiheldin - I've not looked into the original issue yet because I can't run the example provided stand-alone, so it'll take time to re-create a local test case before I can dig in to it..

I'll merge this in, but I think if we're going to allow this, it needs to be done properly. As it stands with this PR you can only pass data when waking or resuming a Scene if you use run, but not if you use the normal approach (i.e. this.scene.wake()). which means the Systems is now dispatching an event with undefined as the 2nd argument most of the time.

Thank you for submitting this feature request. We have implemented this and the feature has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. Lots of them are documented already, for example: https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/global.html#event:CameraFadeInStartEvent\nIn the jsdocs they look like this:\n/**\n     * This event is fired when the fade in effect begins to run on a camera.\n     *\n     * @event CameraFadeInStartEvent\n     * @param {Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.Camera} camera - The camera that the effect began on.\n     * @param {Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.Effects.Fade} effect - A reference to the effect instance.\n     * @param {integer} duration - The duration of the effect.\n     * @param {integer} red - The red color channel value.\n     * @param {integer} green - The green color channel value.\n     * @param {integer} blue - The blue color channel value.\n     */\nand then in the corresponding method you add the @fires call:\n/**\n     * Fades the Camera to or from the given color over the duration specified.\n     *\n     * @method Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.Effects.Fade#start\n     * @fires CameraFadeInStartEvent\n     * @fires CameraFadeInCompleteEvent\n     * @fires CameraFadeOutStartEvent\n     * @fires CameraFadeOutCompleteEvent\n     * @since 3.5.0\nThe only thing I've not decided upon is how they should be named (i.e. fully namespaced, or based on just the event name, so it appears in the globals list) - either way, it's an easy change once picked.. Yes, they would need splitting so that the right object has the @fires tag on it.\nDOM events are always lower-case, so the event strings are lower-case too, to keep it consistent with how the browser works in general. That doesn't make for easy reading docs though, so it doesn't matter too much what the internal event name is (i.e. CameraFadeInStartEvent as long as the docs include an example of the correct version, which I guess they don't in this case.\nCould do it like:\n/**\n     * This event is fired when the fade in effect begins to run on a camera.\n     *\n     * @example\n     * this.cameras.main.on('camerafadeinstart', callback, context)\n     *\n     * @event CameraFadeInStartEvent\n     * @param {Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.Camera} camera - The camera that the effect began on.\n     * @param {Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.Effects.Fade} effect - A reference to the effect instance.\n     * @param {integer} duration - The duration of the effect.\n     * @param {integer} red - The red color channel value.\n     * @param {integer} green - The green color channel value.\n     * @param {integer} blue - The blue color channel value.\n     */. For me the 2nd one is what I meant in my comments above. I feel this will map better to TypeScript and will be cleaner in the docs. Also, it means I can use the CONSTs in the source code, instead of strings, which will avoid any potential typos and help with minification.\nI think it makes sense to create an Events section in every namespace. Phaser.Game is a bit of an edge-case, because it's really part of the Phaser.Boot namespace, but for the constructors sake isn't included in there. For everything else, like Phaser.Animations.Events it's much cleaner.. It's surely impossible to cover those in TypeScript at all. They'll have to just be mentioned in the JSDocs and dealt with from there I think.. I'm going to close off this issue as I've now completed all of this work myself. Every Event is properly namespaced, fully documented and marked against the methods that dispatch it. Will be part of the 3.16 release but is in master branch already.. No worries, stuff happens. Was just leaving a comment here for anyone who may have been tracking it (and it's good to close another issue off!). This is a lovely feature, thank you. My only comment is that I find it confusing that if you don't provide a radius, it defaults to 20, but if you provide a blank radius object, it defaults to zero. I'll merge it anyway and fix it here :). Looking into this further. I just tried the latest Phaser build (3.13 Beta 1) in Safari on an iPad still running iOS 11. I loaded the example, pressed the sprite a few times and it reacted normally. I swiped the dock up and then pressed the sprite again, while the dock was still visible, and the dock vanished and the sprite re-acted normally. I tried pulling down the Notifications panel, putting it away, taping the Sprite, it still worked. \nEither this was inadvertently fixed via other updates in the Input Manager recently, or there's another way of triggering it?. Closing this issue as the related one is confirmed fixed and this can no longer be reproduced in current versions.. @sftsk I can't sort it unless I can reproduce it, and doing exactly the same process as you doesn't trigger it for me (I can upload a video if you like?).\nWhich makes me think it's something else. A combination of the code in the Scene plus this happening maybe. Maybe the resize event firing together with input?!. It feels highly strange that you would want to start dragging an item with finger 1, then carry on dragging it with finger 2 without having let go with finger 1 first. Or to drag a single item with 2+ fingers. I literally cannot think of a reason why that needs to be supported.. Thanks for opening this issue, and for submitting a PR to fix it.

If there is no texture change the draw calls are already batched, although at 90,000 objects that\u2019s still around 45 draw calls minimum (as the batch size is 4k before it flushes).

The tiles need to be extruded if you want to use WebGL. This will help: http://phaser.io/news/2018/05/webgl-tile-extruder. This is literally impossible to handle from within Phaser as it depends entirely on the font face being used, its original size and how far you scale it. There's no way to come up with something that would work with all fonts for all games.\nPerhaps there may be some way to have all scale operations for a Text object routed through to a custom function that then increased the font size accordingly, but the rate at which scale values change vs. font sizes are so very different.\nThis feels like something you need to handle by using BitmapText, or your own Text object that monitors its scale and then adjusts its font size accordingly, which would be quite a bit of trial and error (and very font specific) but ultimately worth doing.. Thinking about this a bit more, maybe the trick is to use something similar to CSS breakpoints. So between certain scales, you use a specific font size, and so on. The trouble is that when you then change font size, you'd want to reduce the scale too! Which is a bit of a catch 22.. I have thought about this, but it isn't something I'm willing to spend my own time on. If p2 wasn't abandoned then I'd have included it from the start, but no updates and no developer response for years now just makes it not worth the effort I'm afraid.\nI feel v3 has a flexible enough structure that someone else could handle integrating it themselves quite cleanly, without needing to touch much of the internal code at all. I'd accept PRs for this (that passed our eslint tests) but there are simply too many other things to focus on right now that I can't entertain the thought of doing it myself, sorry.. Masks are definitely positioned in global space because they're non-exclusive. I will see if I can find time to create an example showing what I mean.\nAlso, why, why this?! : game.scene.scenes[0]... it makes me so sad :( and reinforces my belief that I absolutely must remove all game level properties in a coming release, so it's impossible to do things like this in future.\n. this absolutely refers to the current Scene within any Scene method, which is why this.load works in your preload function. The create function is run in the exact same scope.. Back to the original point, I need to double-check the code (as I didn't write it) but I'm 99% sure that multiple game objects can share a single mask, which is why they're positioned globally.. Ok, sorry it took a while, but I was right and made a test tonight: multiple Game Objects can all share the exact same mask, which is why they're positioned in global space, not local. I'll update the mask jsdocs now to reflect this.. Looking at the mask code, it creates 2 new gl textures and 2 framebuffers for every bitmap mask, none of which appear to be cleared properly in the destroy method. So yes, it's almost certainly going to consume memory like this. I'll label this to be fixed, although I'd also urge that this sort of approach isn't used in practice either, as that's a heavy amount of creation and destruction to process every 100ms even if it was doing it properly..

I have fixed the Pointer.move issue and the Tween returns locally and pushed them to master (as too many changes had occurred since your PR to merge it safely).\nI like the look of the two Polygon functions but could you please complete the jsdocs for them? I can't merge without them.. \ud83d\udc4d . Yes it will, because 2 pointers are created by default. Actually try it on a device maybe?. https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/master/src/input/InputManager.js#L224. StaticLayer really needs a bit of an overhaul. It's massively inefficient for large maps and is limited to a single texture frame. However, it works and works fast, so I'm flagging this as a long-term feature request.. Thank you for submitting this feature request. We have implemented this and the feature has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. Yes, not really surprising given how it builds the arc up. Can be fixed by using an end angle > 360. In this specific case, 361 is enough to close the gap completely, but it will depend entirely on the stroke thickness. The end angle is clamped in the renderer, so I'll see about removing that, then you can overshoot it in code to close off un-sightly holes (as this can't be done automatically). Thank you for submitting this feature request. We have implemented this and the feature has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. Thanks for this. I agree with the change. I'm redoing all the rendering methods at the moment, so will make this change to them as I do that.. Ok, all of these changes are now in the master branch and I added text alignment as well :). Am I right in thinking all this change does is allow you to load the new map type, it doesn't actually support infinite maps during rendering?. Which tile in the set is the one with transparency in?. And the code that caused this is .... ?. No example provided so closing this issue.. Could probably do with creating a bunch of mask tests in the labs, just to test how it works against various Game Objects, then we'd know what repercussions this change would have - if any. I'll see about creating some when I get a chance this week. I still think it should be KEEP though.. I've made a bunch of tests and I'm happy with changing this to KEEP so I've done that in the next build. We can monitor feedback from there on.. Thank you for submitting this issue. We have fixed this and the fix has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. Should probably set them in the Game Objects Data Manager, rather than directly on the GO itself and mutating its class.. Thank you for submitting this issue. We have fixed this and the fix has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. There's no easy way to properly support scrollFactor within the physics system as it's Camera specific and applied in the rendering stage - all collisions would need checking against all Cameras, and you may get a collision happen in one Camera (because of its viewport position + scroll factor) but not in another. However, I think this highlights that the API docs need to make this clear, so I'll make sure they are changed to reflect this.. Hmm, yes, but it's not quite as straightforward as you'd think. The Camera itself could determine if it's dirty or not - but it would have to check both its viewport dimensions and its position, rotation and zoom factor every frame (as a change in any of those would make it dirty). And also, the Tilemap Layer would need to internally store the previously culled tiles somewhere too, but it would have to do it for every Camera in the Scene. All of which makes me think this shouldn't just be enabled wholesale but should be some user-level feature you could turn on.. Just to say that in the master branch for 3.11 you'll find a whole raft of updates all to do with tilemap culling. Including the ability to set your own culling callback function. There is also the option to disable culling, or set extra cull padding, and the whole culling function has been recoded and is now a lot faster. All in all, I'm happy you can do whatever you need with culling now - so am going to close this issue off. If you get time to test it, that'd be great :). Thank you for submitting this issue. We have fixed this and the fix has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. Thanks for the PR. This will break maps made in a slightly older version of Tiled though, where the object properties are not in an array. See below for example:\n\"properties\":\n                    {\n                     \"alpha\":0.25\n                    },\nI can't merge this PR because I don't want to break it working with older maps, but I will merge it if you can add in a conditional to ensure it only takes the new approach if an array is found, otherwise it defaults to the current method.. Can you please check to see if this isn't related to #3832 ? As it sounds like it may have just been a Tiled fubar which they since fixed.. Thank you for submitting this issue.

Thanks for this PR but I can't merge it as-is. I don't like the idea of having to keep an array of property keys like this, it seems far too prone to error. Instead why not just use a hasOwnProperty check on the target object, and if the property doesn't exist, it can use setData instead?. Duplicate of #3606 - please track progress on that issue.. I've fixed all of these issues. However, I'm thinking the RenderTexture class could do with being changed in a number of ways:\n1) Remove the use of the MatrixStack entirely. You're limited to 1000 ops at the moment, and it creates a huge array big enough to hold all of that for every single RenderTexture, even if you never use one. This means removing methods like save, restore, rotate and scale from the RT, but I'm guessing adding the following feature is all anyone really needed anyway:\n2) Add the ability to draw a texture based Game Object to a RT and for it to use the transform of the Game Object (rotation, scale, flip, tint - you'd still tell it where to draw x/y)\n3) Allow an array of Game Objects to be drawn to a RT in a single call.\n4) Doing the above I can remove the batch flush for every draw, and just do it for every group of array items. So drawing an array of 1000 items to an RT will take 1 draw, not 1000.\n5) The same draw method can then take either an array of Frames or Game Objects without needing an extra method.\nI may look into passing in Containers or Groups but I'm not overly keen on the idea.\nI do feel that dropping all the MatrixStack stuff and allowing you to use the GOs transform would be a fair swap. I'm really not sure how many people make use of it anyway.. Do you ever use the current RT transform methods? (like save, restore, etc). That's what I figured. It was just too frustrating to use imho.. Ok, now in the master branch is the brand new Render Texture. Here's what it can do:\nRender Texture Updates\nThe Render Texture class has been rewritten from scratch and all Game Objects have been updated to support it. Previously it was very restricted in what you could do with it. It used to have a matrix stack for internal transforms, but this has been replaced with a Camera instead. This means you have the full power of a Camera system (scrolling, zooming, rotation) but it only impacts the contents of the Render Texture.\n\n\nThe biggest update is the change in what the draw method can accept. Previously you had to pass is a texture and frame reference. This has changed, as has the method signature. It can now accept any of the following:\n\nAny renderable Game Object, such as a Sprite, Text, Graphics or TileSprite.\nDynamic and Static Tilemap Layers.\nA Group. The contents of which will be iterated and drawn in turn.\nA Container. The contents of which will be iterated fully, and drawn in turn.\nA Scene. Pass in Scene.children to draw the whole display list.\nAnother Render Texture.\nA Texture Frame instance.\nA string. This is used to look-up a texture from the Texture Manager.\n\n\n\nThere is a new method drawFrame which allows you to pass in a string-based texture and frame key and have it drawn to the Render Texture.\n\nThe new method saveTexture allows you to save the Render Texture into the Texture Manager using your own key. You can then use the Render Texture for any Game Object that accepts textures as a source, such as Sprites or even Tilemap Layers. You can add frame data to a Render Texture using the RenderTexture.texture.add method.\nThe new camera property is an instance of a complete 2D Camera. You can use it to change the view into your Render Texture. Scroll, rotate, zoom, just like you would with a normal Camera, except it will only influence is the objects being drawn to the Render Texture.\nAll of the matrix-style methods have been removed: save, translate, restore, scale, rotate. You can now achieve the same thing by either transforming the object you want to draw to the Render Texture, or using the built-in Camera.\nYou can now crop a Render Texture. Use the setCrop method to define the crop region.\n\nSee the fully complete documentation for more details and the extensive examples and tests created.\n:). When you call setInteractive you are telling it to create a hit area the size of the Container at that point in time. If you change the size of the Container after this, the hit area will not automatically update. If you were to scale the Container, the hit area will understand that and use it, but it doesn't monitor resizing. This is true for all Game Objects, not just Containers.\nThe solution is to either call removeInteractive, resize it and then make it interactive again. Or, far easier, just resize the hit area.. \ud83d\udc4d . Screen shots please, this is either a culling issue or asset specific.. This is correct - see the cullPaddingX and cullPaddingY properties to increase that, or the Dungeon demo in the labs (in the dynamic tilemap layer folder). Yes, Tiled changed it (recently). It seems to like changing its data structure without worrying about implications like this, as we now need to support both formats. There is a PR for this already.. Even if the last iteration was skipped, it still shouldn't matter, because the Fade effect works by calling update, which changes the alpha value each frame, and then calls postRenderWebGL which draws a filled rectangle over the Camera as long as !this.isRunning && !this.isComplete - these booleans are set to false and true respectively when the effectComplete method is called (which happens when the timer is up, as part of the update loop.)\nBasically, as long as those booleans are set, it doesn't draw the rectangle anyway, even if it never quite reached the full alpha value it was meant to.\nWhich means that, for some reason, perhaps effectComplete isn't ever getting called, so it's constantly drawing the rectangle over the Camera every frame regardless. I guess you could confirm this by checking the isRunning and isComplete values of the fade effect at run-time. Do they ever get changed as they should?\nYou could also edit postRenderWebGL to log something out just before the return true at the end - does it carry on logging constantly, even after the fade should have finished? If so, this is the issue. If not, it's something else unrelated to the fade.. ^ which means effectComplete never gets called. Log it out, check to see if it does get called (because if it does the issue is something else)\nThe question is: what is it about the way you've set things up that causes this? As there's no reason the complete method would never be called, but for some reason in your case that's happening.. Very nice PR. The ternaries style ought to match the rest of the API, but I'll make that change here as there's no ESLint rule for it.. Shouldn't the drawLeft (etc) values use the tileW/H values, i.e. the scaled tile size? For example:\ndrawLeft = Math.max(0, boundsLeft / layer.tileWidth);\nboundsLeft was calculated using the scaled tile size, but it's being divided by an un-scaled tile size. Which I'm sure can cause it to turn out to be a float, which would make the array look-ups fail.. They're not (being rendered at different times), it's that the UV calculations are done once, at the start, for static, and in real-time for dynamic, and if the tiles are not properly extruded they'll blend like this, no matter what setting is set.. It's an internal property and should have been flagged as private, as it doesn't do what you assumed it would do. I'll rename this issue and turn it into a feature request.. Thank you for submitting this feature request. We have implemented this and the feature has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. @Ben-Millions I just tried your codepen against 3.12 Beta 4 and I can confirm that setting yoyo to true makes it repeat forever, regardless of the repeat value. So yes, definitely a bug in the playReverse changes.. Re-opening until yoyo is fixed.. Yeah, if you like, I'll take a look at it again. I'll still need to un-pick the current implementation, so it's not a straight-forward merge (I doubt it'd merge at all without conflicts actually). \ud83d\udc4d . Can you think of any examples where you wouldn't want to do this?. \ud83d\udc4d . I\u2019m curious but if it didn\u2019t keep the transform related to the container, what did it actually do? \ud83d\ude42 I suspect you can\u2019t pin a pin onto another pin either?. Containers will remain, it's the ability to nest them that I'm going to remove.\nThe problem with the 'calculate world positions before rendering' approach is that it's too late by that point. There are lots of reasons you need the world positions to be perfectly accurate all the time. Input checks, bounds checks, intersection checks, camera culling, etc. They all need perfectly accurate transforms at every stage, not just before rendering, and what's more - they need to be perfect for every single camera in every Scene, as each one potentially needs different results :(\nSo the moment any transform aspect changes, in any child, or any of its parents, every single part of that ancestry tree needs recalculating, and it needs to happen every time, not just once, which means it's entirely possible to need many tree updates in just a single frame. This was the same issue that plagued v2 to be honest, except there were no multiple cameras or states so it wasn't as bad.\nThere were so many v2 issues over the years related to incorrect body positions and the like. Part of that problem is that Arcade Physics uses the Sprites position and scale for its body. Scale the sprite and the body scales with it. A real physics system would never do this. The body would be entirely independent and it would be up to you to reflect any changes made to the sprite into it. p2, for example, doesn't even let you scale bodies (and for good reason, scale doesn't really exist in physics simulations in the way we visually think of it) And don't get me started on the issues with containers and tilemaps :) or the way devs expect Containers to have a size that perfectly encompasses its children but should also support origin and scroll factor! They're an absolute minefield of problems and expectations.\nI actually think the early versions of Lazer had the best transform approach in it. I spent a long time working on it, ensuring values were properly cached up and down the tree, removing un-needed calculations where possible. It never made it into v3 and the Container system in there currently isn't ideal. In time I think I'd much rather revert back to the transform system I originally built. Yet it still requires constant iteration to work.\nBut at the same time, I find it, and the approach v2 had, is actually very limiting. Having the alpha or blend modes impact the whole tree is as equally useful as it is annoying. What if you don't want to alpha out every child? What is just part of the container should have a blend mode set, not all the children? What if you want to scale a containers background but not have the children scale at all? None of these things are possible and it just feels wrong.\nIn the meantime though, removing nested Containers will fix a number of issues and simplify the internals a lot, which will make the transition to something better a lot easier in the future.. Also forgot to add, it's not up to the developer how complex the hierarchy gets. The very fact the API supports it means all the iteration checks have to be run anyway, even if you never use it. The very existence of the feature negatively impacts all games, even those that never use a single Container. This is the biggest issue I have with them I think.. Skeletal animations will use their own animation format / handler, they won't be containers.. I'll gladly put some funds towards a solid implementation, but it would need to be discussed in depth with me beforehand, because it would literally touch every single system in the API.. Input, culling and so on are all scheduled, so they always happen at the same point in the game step (unless invoked directly from user code I guess) - the issue isn't when it happens, it's actually the camera system. I wrote the following as a reply in Slack, but I think it's worth including here:\nIn v2 you\u2019ve a single display list, a single canvas sized camera and a single state - so each GO could carry its matrix around with it. In v3 GOs can\u2019t do this because their transform (for both rendering and input) is calculated per camera (and potentially per Scene). GOs could, in theory I guess, store one internal matrix per camera, but there\u2019s no limit on the quantity of cameras, and I think it\u2019d be a bit of a nightmare to manage, not to mention the extra weight per object. So their matrices are transient, and because of this need recalculating any time they are queried by any system or game code. Which could potentially be a large number of times in a single frame. Or maybe just once. That\u2019s the problem really!\nI can't cache their matrix without doing it for every camera. I could cache the 'world' matrix, and then transform that for every camera, but it only avoids a single step of the process, the camera math all still needs to happen.\nThere's definitely a solution to be found here, it's just a bit more complex than usual.. This is about getting the topology and topography correct. As it stands now, it's too tied into the rendering. It should be fully abstracted from that.\nHaving said that, if the only issue is a bit of elementary math, you have absolutely no reason not to implement it yourself, right?. Containers will be removed and fully recoded in 3.14. I'm fed up with their limitations and the issues the current implementation has. They will remain untouched (and un bug-fixed) until then.. Thanks for the PR @Edwin222 ! I think I'd rather do proper reversed animation support than just flipping the array. However, the comments you added into the Texture Manager are great so I'd like to merge those! Would you mind removing the reverse change, then I'll gladly pull in the rest. Every little bit helps when it comes to the docs!. Thank you :) Just to say that reverse animation support will be coming in 3.12!. Agreed. I think it's the Factory logic that is redundant, it may as well stay in the Group constructor.. Thank you for submitting this issue. We have fixed this and the fix has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. Investigated today and issue is caused by scale + origin (scale on its own works fine, combined with origin it is offset from Container). Considering leaving as-is until Containers are re-coded in 3.14.. Nice. Let's add it.. Thank you for this PR, it was a nice clean and elegant solution too! However, we had already merged a PR from @khaleb85 which added a playReverse method on the Animation component, and a reverse method to reverse an already playing animation. It's quite unusual to get multiple PRs at the same time for the same feature!\nAgain, thank you for spending time doing this, but alas I need to close it off as the features are already in master.. Thanks for opening this issue, and for submitting a PR to fix it. We have merged your PR into the master branch and attributed the work to you in the Change Log.

Containers haven\u2019t been touched at all in 3.12 (and won\u2019t be) so whatever issue you found there with alpha is unrelated to this.. Happy to merge this, but can you make one small change please: Game Objects aren't guaranteed to have a frame. So only set the w/h from the frame if they have a frame property.. I haven't had a chance to test this for myself, but I'm going to merge it anyway and hope some of those using Cordova can confirm one way or another (as it shouldn't harm them at all).

The Camera does not cull anything. So it will render everything it is told to, regardless if it can \"see\" it or not.\nI would suggest as your game scrolls, you kill off objects that are out of view (and cannot be scrolled back again) - you could do something similar for objects coming into view, but give it plenty of space. It's very game specific (i.e. speed of scroll, can player move left and right? etc) but generally, I think it'd be safe to have 4 screens worth of content alive at any one time.\nIdeally please move discussion of this topic to Slack / Discord or the forum, as it's not really an API issue, thanks..

The purpose is for setting the internal size of the Game Object, as used by frames or physics body creation. To adjust how it's rendered, use setScale or setDisplaySize. I've updated the jsdocs to make this more clear.. The issue is the tile culling (rather than the scrollFactor) because it was assumed that the LayerData baseTileWidth and baseTileHeight properties were authoritative, but it appears we need to use those from the Tilemap itself, not any of the layers, to get a true bounds. I've updated the Cull function to use this and the test works fine now.\nJust pinging @mikewesthad - can you see anything wrong with the current approach in https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/master/src/tilemaps/components/CullTiles.js ? It passes whatever I throw at it, but there's so many weird edge-cases in tilemaps who knows.. This is taking up far too much time, so, for now, I'm disabling culling entirely on a layer if you have a scroll factor <> 1. Renders fine and will do for now.. Thanks. I really wish Matter would merge in all of the amazing speed optimizations that brice made. Then I can just take it wholesale from npm.

Can't debug screenshots.. This issue is the same as #3955 - although I appreciate that you opened this issue first (so technically 3955 is a duplicate of this), that one provides a more solid test case, so I'm going to close this and please ask that you track 3955 instead. Also, please test against the master branch, as I pushed a fix up today that should solve this.. \ud83d\udc4d . Thank you for submitting this issue. We have fixed this and the fix has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. Thank you for submitting this issue. We have fixed this and the fix has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. The pointerout and pointerover events are not dispatched for Touch pointers and never have been. This isn't resolution related, it's done on purpose and won't change in 3.12.\nI'll look into the resolution + camera scroll issue.. This isn't fixed in beta 3 yet. Will be for beta 4 when the scale manager is finished.. (hence why this issue is still open). Unfortunately: #4010 - I knew about this, but couldn't hold off 3.12 any longer, so will resolve it as part of the next round of updates.. ComponentToHex takes a number as its argument, not an object (which is what a Color object is) - I guess the function could check if the input is a number before doing anything with it, but it does say in the docs (which are complete for that function) what to provide, so the onus is on the dev really.. /**\n * Wrap an angle in degrees.\n *\n * Wraps the angle to a value in the range of -180 to 180.\n *\n * @function Phaser.Math.Angle.WrapDegrees\n * @since 3.0.0\n *\n * @param {number} angle - The angle to wrap, in degrees.\n *\n * @return {number} The wrapped angle, in degrees.\n */\nSo a value of 2 is well within the bounds. Please consult the docs before opening more issues like this!. Thank you for submitting this issue. We have fixed this and the fix has been pushed to the master branch.

This has never actually worked (in any version of v3!) - will see about either removing the feature so it doesn't break, or fixing it properly..

Thank you for submitting this issue. We have fixed this and the fix has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. Matter has now been updated to 0.14.2.. It's not paused at the time you call it. this.scene.pause queues the operation, so it's paused on the next update. this.scene.scene.run bypasses the queue entirely, running the Scene immediately, because it's hitting the SceneManager and not the ScenePlugin.. If someone wants to sort this out I'll link to it, but it's not a constructive use of my time on its own, as it's so trivial to build locally.. Have updated the method so that the x/y is always within the frame dimensions, which fixes the issue shown in the video. Still needs testing on an atlas frame with a buttload of space trimmed off it though.. The frame in the demo is trimmed, just not by much, which is why it still looks ok I think.. There we go, works properly now, trimmed or not.. Full test:\n```\nvar config = {\n    type: Phaser.AUTO,\n    width: 800,\n    height: 600,\n    parent: 'phaser-example',\n    scene: {\n        preload: preload,\n        create: create\n    }\n};\nvar game = new Phaser.Game(config);\nfunction preload ()\n{\n    this.load.image('mushroom', 'assets/sprites/mushroom2.png');\n}\nfunction create ()\n{\n    var image = this.add.tileSprite(200, 100, 512, 256, 'mushroom');\nimage.setInteractive();\n\nimage.setAngle(20);\n\nimage.setOrigin(0);\n\nimage.on('pointerdown', function () {\n\n    this.setTint(Math.random() * 16000000);\n\n});\n\n}\n```\nWorks fine, regardless of which value is given to setOrigin, meaning the cause of this issue is something else not evident from the code given above. If you can isolate it, post it and I'll re-open.. Thanks for opening this issue. As much as we'd love to help you, we need a fully working code sample to do so. Please provide one and then we'll re-open this issue and look at resolving it for you if possible.. I'm happy to include this new feature, but the implementation needs tweaking first. It would make a lot more sense if the width/height were provided as a config object, just like when loading a Sprite Sheet, and then either used or not used, based on what the dev provides.\nIf you can update the PR to get the values from there instead (you can copy the way Sprite Sheet File does it) then I'll be happy to merge this in. Also, don't forget to update the FileTypesManager.register too, so it's included in there (if you need help with updating the docs in English that's fine, just let me know). You forgot to add the svgConfig to the register function, but I've merged your changes anyway and have made that change here (so it now works properly) - thanks for the PR :).

Closing due to inactivity.. It depends what kind of effect you want to achieve. A small light with the camera will have a consistent falloff at the edges, where-as one massive one will have a much wider fall-off, meaning areas on the extreme edges will look much darker than those in the middle, because of the combination of a larger radius and intensity setting.\nYou could always just use the setAmbientColor() method so that your Scene always has a light source (from no fixed position), so Sprites always render.. It will make no difference to processing as it's still just 1 light. One is tiny, the other is large. I would use a small light tracked to the camera to keep the style consistent.. Can you test this with the current master version please? I pushed a fix for the arc function today which I'm hoping will solve this too.. Can you make this happen in any desktop browsers? (as I can't) - and which Android browser is it? Or is this a compiled app? May have to leave this as a known issue, because the time involved investigating it is likely prohibitive.. What about the filled rounded rectangles?\nAnd is it just rounded rects? Do other Graphics shapes appear ok?. This is what the function does:\n```\n    strokeRoundedRect: function (x, y, width, height, radius)\n    {\n        if (radius === undefined) { radius = 20; }\n    var tl = radius;\n    var tr = radius;\n    var bl = radius;\n    var br = radius;\n\n    if (typeof radius !== 'number')\n    {\n        tl = GetFastValue(radius, 'tl', 20);\n        tr = GetFastValue(radius, 'tr', 20);\n        bl = GetFastValue(radius, 'bl', 20);\n        br = GetFastValue(radius, 'br', 20);\n    }\n\n    this.beginPath();\n    this.moveTo(x + tl, y);\n    this.lineTo(x + width - tr, y);\n    this.arc(x + width - tr, y + tr, tr, -MATH_CONST.TAU, 0);\n    this.lineTo(x + width, y + height - br);\n    this.arc(x + width - br, y + height - br, br, 0, MATH_CONST.TAU);\n    this.lineTo(x + bl, y + height);\n    this.arc(x + bl, y + height - bl, bl, MATH_CONST.TAU, Math.PI);\n    this.lineTo(x, y + tl);\n    this.arc(x + tl, y + tl, tl, -Math.PI, -MATH_CONST.TAU);\n    this.strokePath();\n\n    return this;\n},\n\n```\nWhich is basically just a bunch of Graphics commands in a sequence. Could you try re-creating the above (so just calling the Graphics commands directly) but add in a closePath before the stroke? I'm thinking it's something like that.. How about breaking it down a bit - so rather than the whole rectangle, how about just having the first moveTo, lineTo and arc calls? Do you still see it then? (comment out the rest of the commands) - if not, add the next line in and try again. I'm curious to know at which point you get one of those extra lines to appear. I'd rather solve this than leave it as-is.. Does it work if you repeat for all 4 corners? If so we can merge this back in with master.. @alexeymolchan you could try the non-negative version above, but otherwise please paste the full working combination here so I can merge it into master, as I've never been able to reproduce this, so I need to see what combination gets it working for you.. @alexeymolchan you could try the non-negative version above, but otherwise please paste the full working combination here so I can merge it into master, as I've never been able to reproduce this, so I need to see what combination gets it working for you..

Arcade Physics was changed in 3.10 to purposely use a fixed time-step, ensuring the results are deterministic (which is far more important for a multiplayer game):\n\nArcade Physics now uses a fixed time-step for all internal calculations. There is a new fps config value and property (defaults to 60fps), which you can change at run-time using the setFPS method. The core update loop has been recoded so that it steps based entirely on the given frame rate, and not the wall-clock or game step delta. This fixed time step allows for a straightforward implementation of a deterministic game state. Meaning you can now set the fps rate to a high value such as 240, regardless of the browser update speed (it will simply perform more physics steps per game step). This is handy if you want to increase the accuracy of the simulation in certain cases.\nYou can also optionally call the step function directly, to manually advance the simulation.\n\nBoth Matter and AP allow you to change how the simulation steps to match your requirements to whatever is needed. Matter before using a fixed time-step was a mess (try it and see for yourself), so there's no way it's going to change back again. Define your own step for full control..

An RT of the same size, or less, works as expected.\n3) Creating an FBO beyond what the GPU can support throws all kinds of fun errors (from both the Camera FBO and the RT), which is to be expected really, but needs catching.\n4) The time of the draw appears to be irrelevant and not the trigger.\n5) Happens when drawing a texture frame or a Game Object instance..

The Phaser logo is being drawn randomly in the range -3000 to 3000, so well outside the size of the Render Texture. It no longer draws anything outside of the RTs size..

The delta value is a smoothed and capped average collected over the previous 10 frames, to specifically avoid spiking and fall-outs and all the random crap browsers like to do. If you want the 'raw' value, use game.loop.rawDelta instead, which is the date based delta value similar to your code above. If you intend to use that value in your calculations be extremely careful as it can fluctuate massively depending on whatever the heck the browser feels like doing at the time..

This needs handling in your code based on whatever font you need to support. The Text class provides a couple of ways to deal with it. First, you can change the Text padding property to give lines the extra height they need for characters such as this (see the labs for an example).\nOr secondly, you can change the testString property of the Text style object from the default, which is |M\u00c9qgy to something including your special characters. There is also the method Text.style.setTestString which can change it post-creation, but it's probably easier to just give a new test string in the style config object.\nthis.add.text(100, 200, '\u239d example text', {\n        fontSize: '48px',\n        fontFamily: 'Arial',\n        color: '#ffffff',\n        backgroundColor: '#ff00ff',\n        testString: '\u239d|M\u00c9qgy'\n    }).setStroke(0x111111, 6);.

The time scale is reset to 1 whenever a new animation is loaded into a Sprite.

Ah, it's because it's expecting currentFrame to be set to something, but in an extended pipeline it won't be. Try adding this into your custom pipeline:\nthis.currentFrame = renderer.blankTexture;\nThat should resolve it. In the meantime, I'll see about making that the default. Currently, it happens in the renderer's boot method but it happens directly on the TTP, not on any custom pipelines, hence the error..

The change seems to just negate the autoResize check entirely, as you get the same end result regardless of what you set that config property to.

I'm happy with this as a limitation. Graphics objects have no bounds, so cannot have a getCenter method. setSize works in that it doesn't use this method unless it exists, so I've updated the docs to make it more explicit.. It doesn't matter too much where the center is, it all depends on where you draw to it. If you fillRect(0, 0, w, h) then you'd need a totally different offset than if you did a fillRect(-w/2, -h/2, w, h). I think it's fair we should make the dev choose the combination they prefer and setOffset explicitly..

Ok, I've just spent several hours looking at this and it was beyond mental. In the troika font, only 4 numbers caused it! I tried several other web fonts and they were all fine. Under normal canvas, worked great too. After a massive debugging session it boiled down to an issue with resizing WebGLTextures that are canvas backed. I replaced that with just removing and re-creating the texture and it works perfectly now. Damn, that was a weird one! Fix is in master branch..

Yes, it's because the time is only reset when the primary button is pressed, not auxiliary buttons.\nI've thought about changing this, but then you hit the issue of what happens if you hold down two buttons at once, then release one, then release the other a few seconds later? Technically when you release the first one it should set the upTime (and the up coordinates too), but then should it reset that time and those coordinates when the second button is released?\nSame goes for pressing down actually. At the moment it only stores the downX/Y values if the primary button is pressed. If you press the left button, then press the right one, with the left still down, should it overwrite the first down coordinates and down time?\nPerhaps the Pointer ought to have a Button object and each Button object has its own set of coordinates and time values - but then which one is used for hit detection :) and what if you press down with one button while over one Scene / Camera, then move the mouse (still holding down) and press down on another button over a completely different Scene / Camera.

If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.\nThe issue was with the debug graphic, not the collision btw.. I did some tests this morning.\nI created a Scene with 5k Sprites in. The distinction is important as Sprites live in the Display List and Update List, where-as Images only live in the Display List. On click, I swap to another Scene with 5k Sprites in. Clicking that Scene swaps back to the first Scene again. I tested swapping back and forth several times in a single profile.\nUnder 3.12 the first change took nearly 200ms, 90ms of which was the emit event, the rest was the removal of the objects from the two lists.\n\nInterestingly, subsequent Scene swaps took half the time (around 98ms), which I guess we can attribute to internal optimizations.\nI then swapped to 3.13 with my changes in. The changes stop Game Object's listening for the shutdown event. Instead, the Display and Update Lists purge their children directly (and also skip removing themselves from the two lists if it was a Scene that invoked the destroy). Swapping from A to B now took 113ms for the first swap, which is almost half the time previously:\n\nSubsequent swaps were ~60ms. Although a bit of an edge case it's clearly better off removing them directly rather than through events, so I'm happy to keep this change in.. Thanks for your PR. Please, could you resubmit it with just the changes to the MouseManager. None of the other changes should be merged I'm afraid.. \ud83d\udc4d . They were only ever experimental, never part of the official build and not in the change log or docs, so shouldn\u2019t have been used in production either. I will return to them later, but for now there are other things to do first.. \ud83d\udc4d . Thanks. This fixes the background, but the example still doesn't render properly, likely because of the scissor values. Will have a look.. Thank you for submitting this issue. We have fixed this and the fix has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. Thank you for submitting this issue. We have fixed this and the fix has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. Agreed, at that kind of velocity, it's going to happen. Swap to using Matter.js.. This is correct as zero degrees is to the right, 90 is down, 180 is left.\nPhaser uses right-handed angles for everything internally (just like Pixi, etc, do). This rotated tile test case appears to be working fine:\nhttp://labs.phaser.io/view.html?src=src%5Cgame%20objects%5Ctilemap%5Ctests%5Cvisual%20flipping%20test.js\nDo you have a test that demonstrates otherwise?. Thank you for submitting this feature request. We have implemented this and the feature has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. I don't mind merging this, but why on earth would you ever restart a tween multiple times in a row? Sounds like a fix for a copy paste error in userland.. Thank you for submitting this issue. We have fixed this and the fix has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. Groups don't have a Scale, they're just groups of objects. If you need to scale the children you should be using a Container.. Two issues here. First of all, the extra line in the debug. This line is the convex hull being drawn. In Phaser 3.14 you can now turn this off, or give it another color, so it's more obvious what it is.\nThe second issue with the circle being 'caught' on the edges is because of your update function. Comment out line 90 (this.player.setVelocityX(0)) and it doesn't happen at all, working exactly the same as your Matter demo.. Very much so, that is why it's not included in the build or docs.\nPlease see the Dev Log in Issue 128 of Phaser World for a roadmap for the next few versions.. Thank you for spending time reporting this issue. However, we've already fixed this in the master branch of Phaser and it will be part of the next official release. You can track what's already been fixed by searching closed issues, or by looking at the Change Log.. Thanks for this PR @Edwin222 ! I couldn't merge it because it failed too many ESLint rules, but I have added your changes locally and pushed to the master branch. You are credited in the Chang Log as well. This will be in the 3.16 release.. This is correct because you can't add a Group to a Container because a Group isn't a display object. It's just a glorified array at heart. It has no events or display properties of its own. You could add all the children of the Group to the Container: container.add(group.getChildren()). Thank you for your input. We'd really like to keep GitHub issues specifically for actual issues with the library. Therefor please ask coding support questions like this in the Phaser forum. If you prefer direct chat then you could use Slack or Discord. Or even Stack Overflow with the correct tag.. This property was not being used correctly (or at all in several cases) and was left over from a previous version. It has been removed in 3.16 as the Scale Manager will now handle this.. No, this will be handled by the Scale Manager now, it shouldn't be applied directly in the renderer or to the canvas element anymore.. Why would it have been added to a change log in advance of the change being made? It's not a breaking change in the slightest. It's just handled by an entirely different system now, that's all. Which will be fully documented when it's released, just like all changes are.. It wasn\u2019t deactivated, please don\u2019t be overly dramatic. It wasn\u2019t actually touched at all. All zooming will be handled by the scale manager from 3.16 onwards, just like it was always meant to be.. @Kyberklemming to say something was \"deactivated without notice\" is a dramatic statement, because it implies it was done on purpose without mentioning it anywhere, neither of which actually happened.\nI'm quite surprised it even worked. It was an un-documented setting, with no examples, that hadn't been tested since the beta versions.\nYou can restore its functionality in 3.12+ by dropping this anywhere in your code:\nthis.game.canvas.style.width = (this.game.config.width * this.game.config.zoom).toString() + 'px';\nthis.game.canvas.style.height = (this.game.config.height * this.game.config.zoom).toString() + 'px';\nThat way you don't need to edit the build.\nOr, wait for 3.16, which will handle it properly via the Scale Manager.\n. Thank you for submitting this issue. We have fixed this and the fix has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. The collision box and the debug for it is in the correct place, as you can see in the codepen above (the box collides properly with the world bounds) as the Sprite is positioned based on the center of the body. However, we could keep the body in sync with the Game Object by syncing the display origin offsets every frame. I've made this change in the master branch and will leave it in for now.\n. \"for now\" means I'll leave it there unless I find an example or situation where it breaks. It's not a minor change as it likely impacts anyone who used setOffset to adjust for the body position vs. the game object.. Thank you for submitting this issue. We have fixed this and the fix has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. Have finally managed to reproduce this, so will have a look and see how something as simple as a fillRect could cause it.. Ok, I'm happy this is fixed now. I managed to replicate it, then after the fix I left a canvas demo running for 32 minutes (yes, minutes) and frame rate is fine, fillRect is tiny. Phew :). Thank you for submitting this issue.

If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. @hsan999 sort your browser cache out / local cache, because I guarantee those versions work just fine.. Running your code against the master branch (or 3.13 actually) gives me the origin reported as 0.5 as seen in the following screenshot (the red dot is the center of the screen, 400x300):\n\nI made one change to your code, I positioned the polygon at 400x300 to test origin alignment with the red dot marker.. This is correct, all Game Objects that are given a Matter physics body have their origin updated to reflect the render offset of the Body, which is adjusted based on the shape data.. Nope, you have to provide an offset from the Matter shape data to the Game Object itself:\nvar triangle = this.matter.add.sprite(400, 100, 'triangle', null, {\n        shape: { type: 'fromVerts', verts: shapes.triangle },\n        render: { sprite: { xOffset: 0.30, yOffset: 0.15 } }\n    });\n(from http://labs.phaser.io/view.html?src=src\\physics\\matterjs\\offset%20body.js). As soon as you apply a Matter Physics body to any Game Object, the x and y coordinates (as well as the rotation and scale) are no longer that of the Game Object, but of the Matter Body itself. Changes made to the body are reflected in the Game Object. So the x/y values are now the computed center of the body (depending on the shape, compound bodies, etc).\nAll the xOffset does is allow you to modify the relationship between the body x/y and where the texture is drawn. It's a number that defines the offset in the x-axis for the sprite (normalised by texture width).\nYou can change the origin as well to modify where the texture is drawn, but you're changing it in relation to the body. Most the time the texture and body should align. If you want to adjust where the center of the body actually is, that's a different thing altogether (i.e. to apply rotation to a rectangle from say the bottom corner). I'm going to close this because I'm happy it's not actually a bug, but feel free to keep on commenting if you need.. Thank you for submitting this issue. We have fixed this and the fix has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. \ud83d\udc4d . From the Container docs:\n* Containers can have masks set on them and can be used as a mask too. However, Container children cannot be masked.\n * The masks do not 'stack up'. Only a Container on the root of the display list will use its mask.. Not at this moment in time, no. Masks will need to be recoded completely before this will work.. Thanks for the PR. Could you please clarify why this is worth changing, when they could just create the RT and then draw the frame to it already?. You can edit a saved RT at any point, without having to re-create them. So I think, what you're saying, is that you use an RT like an atlas, and want to 'create' a new RT using just a frame of an existing RT, and draw only to that area of it? Hence all of the scissor operations in your PR, etc.. Based on your PR, if you created a new RT using a frame from an existing RT, it wouldn't actually edit the original RT at all, but would create a brand new texture with the frame drawn into it - yes? I.e. if you edit the new RT, the old one isn't updated.. \nIf you can provide a code example demonstrating this bug I can re-open it and investigate, but as is, there's not enough information and it doesn't manifest in a simple test.. Thank you for taking the time to open this issue. However, it's a duplicate of #4066, so to keep things tidy I'm going to close this issue. Please track bug progress on the original issue.. Thanks for opening this issue. As much as we'd love to help you, we need a fully working code sample to do so. Please provide one and then we'll re-open this issue and look at resolving it for you if possible.\nIf it's easier, use a service like Code Sand Box or JSBin to demonstrate the issue live.. Normal maps and lights are working fine with the exception being dynamic layers.. I really wish people would stop doing this. If an issue isn't listed in the Change Log, or closed, then it hasn't been fixed yet, no matter how many releases have come out in the meantime. The change log is meticulous and details everything, it wouldn't exclude something like this.. The value is a const available at LightPipeline.LIGHT_COUNT and defaults 10 lights within the range of a single Camera. The total you have in your game is up to you. I can make the value editable via the game config (not at 'runtime' as it needs to be bound into the shader), but 10 is pushing it already, so increase it at your peril.. There's no open issue about MeasureText, and this isn't the place for it, so if it can be replicated in 3.14 it needs its own issue.. I ran the example above, including the assets and with no changes to the code, against 3.14 and 3.15 on an iPhone SE with iOS12 and the FPS fluctuates but didn't drop below 50.\nSwapping to canvas renderer the fps was a solid 60 with virtually no fluctuation.\nThe iPhone SE is hardly a cutting-edge device (which is why I use it for testing). I'll try it on an iPad tomorrow. Maybe the increased screen res will cause greater fluctuations.. I left it running for 5 mins while I went to make coffee (the phone doesn't auto-sleep) and it was no different when I got back. This needs testing on more devices, it's not just an 'iOS thing'.. Awesome, thanks for the clarification :). This is because in WebGL1 FrameBuffers (which is what a RenderTexture uses internally) don't support anti-aliasing. The only work-around is to create an ellipse brush in Photoshop and draw it as a Sprite, or don't use a Render Texture.. Thanks for opening this issue, and for submitting a PR to fix it. We have merged your PR into the master branch and attributed the work to you in the Change Log. If you need to tweak the code for whatever reason please submit a new PR..

This is a very non-trivial feature request that isn't likely to be looked at for a while due to it impacting such a massive part of the API.\nIn the meantime, the correct way to do it is to place the objects that shouldn't be affected by the zoom in their own Scene, above the one with the panning and zooming camera. Then they don't even need scroll factors either.\n. Nice one \ud83d\udc4d . Canvas cannot support bitmap masking. This is a WebGL only feature (it does say as much in the docs, but it's easy to miss). That would be why this issue isn't yet closed and wasn't mentioned in the 3.15 change log.\n.

If you need to tweak the code for whatever reason please submit a new PR.. \ud83d\udc4d . Nice \ud83d\udc4d . As unusual as this is, it's a valid edge-case I think.. No idea if it can co-exist or not, so let's leave the check in!. Thanks for this. You appear to have moved the Arcade Physics const file into the webgl folder by mistake though. Please move it back again :). Thanks for the PR, but it's the docs that should change, not the event name. All events are lower-case through-out the API.. Closing this one off as I've redone all the events now, thanks!. \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\udc4d . npm is fully up to date with the latest release. This will be part of 3.16. If you need it before then you should apply the change locally.. Both versions support IE9+ (although it's been a long time since I tested v3 on IE9, but v2 and CE should still be fine there - see the readme on that repo for details). \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\udc4d . Phaser 3 has never had video support (it wasn't removed, it was just never there in the first place) - it will be added in 2019, or if someone in the community wants to do it before then, I'd merge it in too.. Thank you for submitting this feature request. We have implemented this and the feature has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. \ud83d\udc4d . Sadly, this change breaks every single emitter example :)\nI'm going to revert it for now until I get time to look into why it's happening.. Ok. I've recoded how dead particles are handled and it's working properly now :). Lovely, thank you.. It's almost certainly because of the gl scissor settings, which are enabled by default for cameras, and I suspect are scissoring all draws to the render texture beyond the camera range.. Thank you for submitting this issue. We have fixed this and the fix has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. I need to see a code sample and map file that reproduces this please, because the one we use to test this feature works fine with Tiled 1.2 JSON:\nhttp://labs.phaser.io/view.html?src=src%5Cgame%20objects%5Ctilemap%5Cdynamic%5Ctile%20draw%20order.js&v=dev. Thank you for submitting this issue. We have fixed this and the fix has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. Thanks. I've also made the change to the Game Object class, as it's more useful there!. I've fixed some linting errors, but otherwise, this seems fine to me.. Agreed, it's the reason the mass collide demo doesn't work properly anymore either. Will look into it.. Please provide an animation we can test this with.. Once I've had a chance to look at your code I'll you know if we need anything more.. In Part 1 of the same tutorial it shows you how to add an empty update function, and in part 5 you populate it with some code. So if you followed through, it should be fine! Thanks for the issue though.. Thanks for your PR! However, I'm pretty sure we don't need this now, as Tile.tileset is now properly returning the correct tileset the tile is from, meaning these methods should return to their previous working state. Please test the master branch to confirm if you can.. Thank you for submitting this issue. We have fixed this and the fix has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release.

You can define the properties that are set on anything the Group adds or creates in its config object:\nvar group = this.physics.add.group({\n    classType: SpaceShip,\n    bounceX: 1,\n    bounceY: 1,\n    velocityY: -200,\n    collideWorldBounds: true\n});\nMoving the responsibility for default values from the class to the Group. While I could only set the properties if defined in the config it would then be different from every other way defaults are set in the API, so I'd rather keep it consistent..

While I could only set the properties if defined in the config it would then be different from every other way defaults are set in the API, so I'd rather keep it consistent.. The problem is the assignment of activePointer to a local property, which you then check in the update loop. The activePointer is not set on a touch device until you actually touch it, so you're basically binding and checking the mouse pointer (which doesn't do anything on mobile) in your code.\nSwap the code in your Scene 1 update loop so it says: this.input.activePointer.isDown and it'll start doing as you expect. Once the scene has been touched, anyway.. No worries - perhaps you could suggest somewhere I can add this in the docs to make it more obvious?. \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\udc4d .

If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. Thanks, nice change!. Thanks, nice change!. This is by design. Animations are global, just like textures, so can be shared between multiple Scene's. If you know you don't need the animation ever again when the Scene ends, you can delete it from the Animation Manager.. Everything stored in a global system that uses a key does the same thing. Textures, Scenes, Audio, Animations - if you try to create any of these twice, you will get a warning because the key is already in use. They are global assets for use by any Scene in the game, not just the one in which they are created, which is why they should be preloaded in a central location and treated as such.\nThe only difference is that the Loader will suppress these warnings. If you try to load an asset using a key already in use, the Loader will silently fail (the asset does not get loaded again) before it even gets as far as the global system. If you wish to utilize this behavior for animations then you could load those from json files.. Duplicate of #3517 - please track progress there.\n. Full support for Spine will be available when Phaser 3.16 is released.. StaticBody doesn't have, or use, the setSize component though. It has its own internal method..

You can surely already do this, though? Just size the viewport to be the size of the half the screen and then rotate one camera by 90 degrees, and the other by -90.. Closing because I'm happy this is possible with the current camera system.. Looks fine to me.. This isn't implemented yet and shouldn't have been added to the config. Will put it down as a feature request to get looked into.. That is what the 'yoyo' argument allows you to do:\nthis.anims.create({\n        key: 'diamond',\n        frames: this.anims.generateFrameNames('gems', { prefix: 'diamond_', end: 15, zeroPad: 4 }),\n        yoyo: true,\n        repeat: -1\n    });\n. To be honest, this is so game specific that you need to manage it in your own code. There's no point Phaser enforcing this. While I could add in min and max properties it seems a bit pointless when it's solved so easily by a quick logic check in the game code.. It was never added and shouldn't be part of the config object yet either.. What's the actual error you get? How are these being called? because they're functionally identical, so I'm betting this is manifesting only as part of an implementation issue in your code (i.e. called in an event handler, as the result of some Promise resolution, etc).. This is correct behavior. fillStyle is a session based setting, as soon as you invoke clear (which you do in the update loop) it resets the fill style back to whatever the default is. As you don't have a default, it sets it back to being clear. By setting it in the config object you're setting the default fill color. You could also get the same result by changing the graphics.defaultFillColor property.. Yes, but there are no plans for it at the moment. We'd take a community PR though..

Also, although it doesn't make any difference this time, please use the Scene Plugin, not the Scene Manager (game.scene) as it won't have a chance to run any other events in the current queue.. Thanks for your PR. While it fixes the problem, it feels like the wrong place to do it, as it's going to do this check every frame, for every tween, which doesn't seem worth it for something that can be caught and handled before the tween even starts playing (zero durations).\nI think we ought to trap this in the Tween.play method.. Thank you for submitting this issue. We have fixed this and the fix has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. You can't not set a game width and height. If you don't provide one, it will default to 1024 x 768.\nYou can't not set a RenderTexture size either. If you don't provide one, it'll default to 32 x 32.\nIf I remove the game width/height from any of the RT demos, even under 3.15.1, they work as before (just with a larger canvas in most cases)\nWhat is it, exactly, that you're seeing happening?. > I'm not sure why you say can't set the size on a RenderTexture.\nI said you can't not give it a size.\nIt'll be released when it's ready. It's irrelevant how long ago the previous version was.\nI'm happy render textures crop correctly now, but their internal camera doesn't allow it to be repositioned, which needs fixing. You can zoom and rotate the internal camera just fine, but not scroll it.\n. Ok, the internal RenderTexture camera viewport now works correctly. You can resize the camera viewport and it will update the internal crop rect accordingly. Changing the scroll factor still has no impact on game objects, but this is a different issue.. My mistake, scrolling the RT camera works perfectly, as long as you're rendering game objects to it. Plain texture frames won't take the camera into account, as they bypass it, which is fine.. Thank you for submitting this issue. We have fixed this and the fix has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. That issue is from the Phaser 2 days! We'll need to use a similar approach this time. We can't just right-click with the ctrl key, because that blocks Windows modification key + clicks, so it'll need a macOS check combined with it (and the option to disable if it needed).. For this, specifically, don't use a Render Texture. A CanvasTexture would make a lot more sense.\nYou don't need to parse anything. Just create a texture and then use Texture.add to add frames to it. Like this example: http://labs.phaser.io/view.html?src=src%5Canimation%5Ccreate%20animation%20from%20canvas%20texture.js&v=dev. \ud83d\udc4d . It was fixed in both: \nhttps://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/commit/7ee0a717f5095a1a917cb54ce9570b528fbe43d4\nSo please make sure you\u2019ve merged correctly.. This is almost certainly a problem with how Brave works. If it does the same thing when deployed to a proper web server (i.e. not running over localhost) then there's nothing we can do about it I'm afraid. It's just Brave being overly paranoid and protective. Which is its mantra, really.. Yes, I\u2019d open an issue on their repo (and reference this if you like). May be worth doing a quick test to see if Pixi does the same or not.. gameobjectdown will fire for any Game Object clicked on. But, in the showData handler you don't check if gameObject actually has a data component or not, you just read from it directly. So if you click your box, it works because you enabled it for data. If you click the button, it throws that error because it has no data on it.\nIf I change your showData handler to include this, it works fine with no errors:\nif (gameObject.data && gameObject.data.get('box_number') == 6)\nTested against master branch 3.16 and 3.15.\nAlso, be aware that in the code above this.box isn't an Image, it's a DataManager, because that is what data.set returns.. The Sprite needs adding to the display list in order to render. It has a texture, it's just not on the display list in your example.. Thanks for opening this issue, and for submitting a PR to fix it. We have merged your PR into the master branch and attributed the work to you in the Change Log. If you need to tweak the code for whatever reason please submit a new PR.. Thanks for the PR but linting is back to normal now. I should have added the ScaleManager to the lint ignore file.. Sorry I didn't merge this, but I'd already moved on too far with the ScaleManager for it to be worth it.. I don't understand the question, sorry. It doesn't sound related to this issue though and is best asked in the forum.. \ud83d\udc4d . Thanks, works nicely and fixes the mass collision test, along with others.. I don't really understand the need for this change. The key-based events were never meant to be emitted from the Animation objects, because an Animation can only ever have one key, so it's pointless emitting both animationupdate and animationupdate-key, as they come from the same base object.\nThe keyed events are meant for Game Objects only.. You can listen for the events directly on the Animation, they're still emitted. It just doesn't need to emit the -key version of the event on the animation as well, because Animations only have one key, so listen for Animation.on('animationcomplete') is enough.. Look good to me, thanks :). The check would need to be if (v !== this._alpha || v !== this._alphaTL || v !== this._alphaTR || v !== this._alphaBL || v !== this._alphaBR) { change alpha } which is quite a conditional to have every time an alpha is changed. If it can be proven it will actually speed it up, I'll add it.. Thanks for opening this issue, and for submitting a PR to fix it. We have merged your PR into the master branch and attributed the work to you in the Change Log. If you need to tweak the code for whatever reason please submit a new PR.. It should never be set to undefined or null intentionally, as those aren't valid types for this property. The docs are clear: either provide an integer or don't include this property in the object at all, in order to get the default value of 24.. Work on doing this has now been completed and will be part of the 3.16 release. Every single event is now fully namespaced, exposed in the docs and listed against the methods that dispatch it.\n\n. Why not, looks useful - thanks :). There is no solution, this has never been possible.. Go on then.. Make sure it works in an atlas where the frames are trimmed (i.e. in Texture Packer when you've got trim option turned on + potentially padding and margin). For example, if you had a tileset where maybe the top row of tiles didn't fill the tile size, it would get vertically trimmed, and that is when things start going awry.\n. I think it would be better to just bail out of the updateTileTexture method right at the start:\nif (!this.dirty || !this.renderer)\n(Line 408)\nRather than add in 2 extra checks, especially as Headless is such a minimal use-case I don't want this to impact normal users.. Thanks \ud83d\udc4d . This is a gesture, really, so I'd rather not add it as a 'core' feature, because it relies on you customizing the delay value, and instead focus on creating a more generic 'gesture' structure into which this would fall (along with swipe, tap, pinch, etc). Check this against the master branch please, 3.11 is a really old version.. Thank you for spending time reporting this issue. However, we've already fixed this in the master branch of Phaser and it will be part of the next official release. You can track what's already been fixed by searching closed issues, or by looking at the Change Log.. Yup, this is fixed in 3.16, which is what I meant by trying the master branch (needs to be cloned and built locally). 3.16 will be out this month.. Thanks for the PR, but to make a jsdoc parameter optional you do it like this: @param {number} [x=0] - Description ... where the =0 part is whatever the default value is should you not supply one, if that isn't obvious, or fixed, just do [x] instead.. Perhaps worth checking latest commit as I've changed the way parents are handled quite a bit.. hmm, nothing has changed re: the delta values in 3.16 at all! I'll look at that responseURL thing now. You could read the value and set it when the layer is created I guess, but not at render time. Pretty sure the value is meant to be used just by the Tiled IDE itself. It\u2019s quite a breaking change for dubious benefits, but could be added.. Exactly what URL are you on where you see the link to the arcade-physics build? Because in the Create your first Phaser 3 Example the index.html has this at the top:\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/phaser@3.15.1/dist/phaser-arcade-physics.min.js\"></script>\nAs seen here: https://gist.github.com/photonstorm/46cb8fb4b19fc7717dcad514cdcec064 on this page\nWhich is correct, as are the assets paths.\nWhat page were you on?!. Ok scratch that, you meant in the actual README.md itself! (that took some deciphering)\nIt was removed from the labs, so I've updated the README code to reflect that. It is correct on the web site and in the gist the README links to, though. The asset paths are perfectly fine too.\nClosing as fixed.. I think this merge foobared :) still wants me to merge the old stuff.. It works fine in Chrome in WebGL. However, it doesn't work in Canvas mode in any browser, which I'd guess is what you're testing it under. This isn't implemented and there are no current plans to add it.. \ud83d\udc4d . Do you have a full test case please? Because the event fires fine on Safari for me, no matter the image size. Possibly making the cause the scene stacking.. Still stuggling to replicate this. I've made the following test case, which uses parallel Scenes running and I can click all 3 images just fine in Safari, Chrome, etc: http://labs.phaser.io/view.html?src=src/bugs/click%20scenes.js&v=dev\nI'll try a test using your exact code and assets, but I'm wondering if the above works when you test it?. Thank you for submitting this issue. We have fixed this and the fix has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. That isn\u2019t the same issue @TheJasonReynolds please open on its own. \ud83d\udc4d . Adding comment to remind myself to build minimal test case from code provided (as it's too large to be used effectively to isolate this issue). Duplicate of #4321 - will look into it this week (thanks for the clearer test case though!). Re-opening, as the more eyes I get on this the better. I'm really struggling to re-create the issue. I've made a simple test case with 3 parallel Scene's and it works fine for me: http://labs.phaser.io/view.html?src=src/bugs/click%20scenes.js&v=dev\nDoes this work for you?\nThe only difference between mine and yours is I didn't use a Rectangle as the input. Although I'm going to try that now.. Ok, am narrowing this down.. if the hit objects overlap, the bottom one takes priority (instead of the top one). Thank you for submitting this issue. We have fixed this and the fix has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. Adding for clarity when I come to fix this: it's the duplicate texture filename that is causing the issue.. The Fullscreen API can only send one dom element (and its children) into fullscreen mode. To do what you need to do, you'll have to make sure that you have one single dom element, inside which you have the Phaser canvas and all of your form elements, and then set that parent as being the fullscreenTarget (this setting is available in both v3 and v2), so it knows to make that element fullscreen and not Phaser itself.. It's now picked-up from the game config and passed to the Scale Manager, so you don't have to set it manually anymore. This is now in the master branch, please test if you get a chance!. Your code looks fine to me. I just tested the following on 3.15.1 and 3.16.0 and it worked on both of them on an iPad in Safari (real device, not emulation) - what device did you test it on?\n```\nvar config = {\n    type: Phaser.AUTO,\n    parent: 'phaser-example',\n    width: 800,\n    height: 600,\n    scene: {\n        create: create,\n        update: update\n    }\n};\nvar graphics;\nvar text;\nvar game = new Phaser.Game(config);\nfunction create ()\n{\n    graphics = this.add.graphics();\n//  We need 3 extra pointers, as we only get 1 by default\nthis.input.addPointer(3);\n\ntext = this.add.text(10, 10, 'Use up to 4 fingers at once', { font: '16px Courier', fill: '#00ff00' });\n\n}\nfunction update ()\n{\n    if (this.input.pointer1.isDown || this.input.pointer2.isDown || this.input.pointer3.isDown || this.input.pointer4.isDown)\n    {\n        graphics.clear();\n    }\ntext.setText([\n    'pointer1.isDown: ' + this.input.pointer1.isDown,\n    'pointer2.isDown: ' + this.input.pointer2.isDown,\n    'pointer3.isDown: ' + this.input.pointer3.isDown,\n    'pointer4.isDown: ' + this.input.pointer4.isDown\n]);\n\ngraphics.fillStyle(0xff0000, 1);\ngraphics.fillRect(this.input.pointer1.x, this.input.pointer1.y, 64, 64);\n\ngraphics.fillStyle(0x00ff00, 1);\ngraphics.fillRect(this.input.pointer2.x, this.input.pointer2.y, 64, 64);\n\ngraphics.fillStyle(0x0000ff, 1);\ngraphics.fillRect(this.input.pointer3.x, this.input.pointer3.y, 64, 64);\n\ngraphics.fillStyle(0xff00ff, 1);\ngraphics.fillRect(this.input.pointer4.x, this.input.pointer4.y, 64, 64);\n\n}\n```. I just gave it a quick test on an iPhone as well (again, in Safari) and it worked fine on there. I would double-check it's actually loading and using the right version of Phaser, your script, etc.. @levieggert I would test the code I posted above on your host and see what happens.. Interesting, nothing has actually changed with Quad's at all in 3.16. They've not been touched since July 2018! The quad tests I ran worked fine, but they weren't in Containers (I'm shocked they even work in Containers tbh)\nFullscreen on iOS requires it to be enabled in Safari Experimental settings.\n.

The quad tests I ran worked fine, but they weren't in Containers (I'm shocked they even work in Containers tbh)\nFullscreen on iOS requires it to be enabled in Safari Experimental settings.\n. The setAlpha method has been restored, so Quad/Mesh works inside a Container again.\nI'm not adding setOrigin back because it never did anything anyway. It was never used in rendering and calling it had no impact on rotation or anything. I tested this in 3.15.1 too, and changing the origin does nothing, no matter inside a Container or not.\nDelta times are unrelated to this issue and should be opened as a separate feature request..

If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\udc4d . What happens for you in this example: http://labs.phaser.io/view.html?src=src%5Cinput%5Cpointer%5Cpointer%20buttons.js ?\nIf I press the left button and drag I get a yellow rectangle. If I press the right button I get a green one. If I press them both I get an aqua colored one.\nLooking at your code I can see you are using pointerup. I believe the issue is that in 3.15 rightButtonDown etc were giving completely wrong results. I updated the docs for them to clarify what they do: \"Checks to see if the X button is being held down on this Pointer\". The key here is 'being held down right now'. In 3.15 it actually returned a historical value - if you checked rightButtonDown at any point, for example, it was always true if you pressed the right button at least once! because the buttons weren't reset in the up handler.\n```\n    this.input.on('pointerup', function (pointer) {\n    console.log('up - left:', pointer.leftButtonDown(), 'right:', pointer.rightButtonDown());\n\n});\n\n```\nWith the above, if I hold down BOTH buttons, then release just the left one, it will log 'false' for the left button being down, because it's not as I just released it, but 'true' for the right button being down, because I'm still holding it. They're actually working as I always intended them to now, they were just bugged before. You can finally use them safely in update loops, for example.\nI think what you're trying to do is figure out which button was released, yes? Which in my mind calls for a different method. You can get the button that was released from the actual DOM event (so pointer.event.button in your handler). The following works:\n```\n    this.input.on('pointerup', function (pointer) {\n    if (pointer.event.button === 0)\n    {\n        console.log('Left button released');\n    }\n    else if (pointer.event.button === 1)\n    {\n        console.log('Middle button released');\n    }\n    else if (pointer.event.button === 2)\n    {\n        console.log('Right button released');\n    }\n\n});\n\n```\nBut note that button IDs can be reassigned (left-handed devices, for example, can flip the button orders). It's probably safer to check the negative state of rightButtonDown than it is the above, but it definitely works. Hope that makes it a bit clearer.. Not really sure, but it needs to be changed, because even logically the method names (rightButtonDOWN, etc) don't actually make sense to be polled in an up event handler.\nI think what needs to be offered are rightButtonReleased methods, or something similar.. This is definitely all possible (thanks @yandeu for the cool example!) but I'm going to label this issue as TODO because the jsdocs need finishing for the plugin.. \ud83d\udc4d . Thank you for submitting this issue. We have fixed this and the fix has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.. I'll label this as a feature request for now, but unless the mouse target is the exact same size and location as the canvas anyway, it will not work as a source of input, so really needs removing entirely.. The notes are incorrect, the events are actually Phaser.Input.Events#POINTER_DOWN_OUTSIDE and Phaser.Input.Events#POINTER_UP_OUTSIDE, which as strings are pointerdownoutside and pointerupoutside. The flow is as in the docs:\n* The event hierarchy is as follows:\n * \n * 1. [GAMEOBJECT_POINTER_DOWN]{@linkcode Phaser.Input.Events#event:GAMEOBJECT_POINTER_DOWN}\n * 2. [GAMEOBJECT_DOWN]{@linkcode Phaser.Input.Events#event:GAMEOBJECT_DOWN}\n * 3. [POINTER_DOWN]{@linkcode Phaser.Input.Events#event:POINTER_DOWN} or [POINTER_DOWN_OUTSIDE]{@linkcode Phaser.Input.Events#event:POINTER_DOWN_OUTSIDE}\nI've tested this just now and it's working as expected.. Which browser? and which version of Android? Support is limited on mobile. If the device + browser don't support it, there's nothing that can be done.. iPad and iPhone work fine for me on real devices.\nThe Android issue is weird because it is coming from a user gesture in that demo. I could understand the error if it was being called automatically without a gesture.. Looking at this today. It's interesting. If you tap anywhere on the canvas first (before tapping the fullscreen button) and THEN tap the fullscreen button, it works perfectly. If the very first thing you do is tap the fullscreen button, it errors.\nSo, something appears to be getting in the way of the first tap, because the code path is identical. I'm guessing maybe the web audio unlocking.. Thank you for submitting this issue. We have fixed this and the fix has been pushed to the master branch. It will be part of the next release. If you get time to build and test it for yourself we would appreciate that.\nPlease note the updated documentation + example regarding this feature on mobile.. Please PR this..

Sorry, I've no intention of letting you specify your own key instead of files. It's part of a larger pack file schema, and in this full context, it accurately describes what the property should contain:\n\"test2\": {\n        \"prefix\": \"TEST2.\",\n        \"path\": \"assets/pics\",\n        \"defaultType\": \"image\",\n        \"files\": [\n            {\n                \"key\": \"donuts\",\n                \"extension\": \"jpg\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"key\": \"ayu\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\nHowever, I would be open to allowing it to check if an array is given and assuming it's a files array if that's the case, although you'd then need to ignore the packKey parameter from the method too. I guess the url argument is the one that would need to have an array check on it.\nThen again, if you've already got the array by that point, it would make a lot more sense to just call this.load.addPack() instead - so really, perhaps it is that method that should take an array?\n. What is this actually fixing?. Shaking has nothing to do with scrolling I\u2019m afraid. This is working as expected. The hud should be in its own scene really.. Game Objects belong to a specific scene and are bound to it until destruction. This isn\u2019t optional, it\u2019s just how they work. The choice you have is when they are added to the Display List of the Scene. That is what the factory automates for you. If you\u2019re finding you always need your objects to  appear immediately then use the factory. There\u2019s no benefit to creating them via a constructor. You only really need to do that if you\u2019re seeding a pool in advance of it being added to the display. You can skip the factory if you need explicit control over when they are added to the display, but they\u2019ll always belong to the scene.. There's a lot of extra code in that example, including Matter objects. Boil it down, please. If the issue is that sprites don't appear on the right y coordinate with your sprite sheet, then that should be demonstrable with just a single line of code in the create function.. Because of the time and effort involved in maintaining yet another dependency elsewhere. The defs will move to the main repo with the 3.17 release, where they can remain in sync with the code.. You ought to submit the comments against Sole's original repo really, stuff like this all comes from there. I'm pretty sure I know what she'll say though :)\n. Do you need this? Doesn't seem to do anything?\n. When would a target not have a parent? In the current implementation it always should, as it has to be a Sprite on the display list. However thinking about it, it would be nice if the Camera could follow a Point object instead of a sprite too - but that can be done another time.\n. Fair comment. Merging then :)\n. I use single quotes for everything other than Object.defineProperty, the only exceptions are classes contributed by third parties, like the Gamepad ones were (or I guess code written at 3am, but that should be far and few between). I change them if I spot them, but they're easy to miss. I could change them for defineProperty as well I guess, then they could be part of the jshint check, but it isn't like there aren't more important things to spend time on.\nI decided not to use getters and setters in property initializers because it would lead to inconsistency for objects created from existing prototypes, which lots are. Which leaves either Object.defineProperty or Object.defineProperties. As the amount of actual code per get/set function is identical in each case, and as you'd still need the property label in defineProperties, all it would actually save is }); from the end of each block. To me that makes it a change for the sake of change, rather than being of any actual benefit.\n. Be careful this doesn't crap out on non browser environments like Cocoon and Crosswalk (although quite frankly they have enough of their own issues too!) - do check IE9 though.\n. Used extensively when generating animation frame index arrays.\n. Again used for animation frames (although much less so given its nature), but is used a lot in our hermite curve / pathing code.\n. Undocumented maybe, but not private. Handy to use in code that needs linear interpolation of values (same for bernstein, factorial, catmullRom) - I used linear just the other day in a sky gradient generator :)\n. Used in several examples for shifting sin/cos array data. Probably more of an array util though.\n. \"This can be a BLOB url string\": Really? It's the Cache key, not the filename.\n. While I agree what we have currently doesn't work, this won't fix it either. All it will do is normalise all of the sounds to have the exact same volume, which isn't the end result we want.\n. I don't mind this change too much, but it reduces the usefulness of the ellipse functions. You now have to pass in an Ellipse object, where-as before it would work happily with any ellipse-like object, which could have been anything really (native JS object, ellipse from a different library, etc) as long as it had x/y/w/h properties it'd work.. Never mind, when in Phaser, use Phaser.. 3.2.0 please :). \"using the full source code\" doesn't make any sense in this context. Please revert this line to the previous version, which is saying that when we created the examples we also released the full code to them and their assets for devs to learn from.. A Timeline can never 'not have' a manager, so you could probably just single-line this to return this.manager.makeActive(tween);.. {object} = {Phaser.Tweens.Tween}. Feel free to add yourself as a second @author entry below this one.. This shouldn't be removed, it should be fixed: value |= 0;. We could probably shorten this to: if (process && process.versions && process.versions.node). Could you please fix this typo :). Bloody hell, that's quite a conditional.. Pretty sure it needs to be {?(object|Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body|Phaser.Physics.Impact.Body)}. Can you add a space here please (to keep it consistent with the rest of the codebase). I'm happy with this addition, but I'd like to make the warning shorter as it doesn't get minified in the production bundle. Perhaps we could convey the same message with fewer words?. This method needs to be called reverse - revert means something different :). Add the @since 3.12.0 tags to all new methods and properties please.. Please quickly run this against ESLint (npm run lintfix) as it'll break the keywords-spacing rule.. Please wrap: {(number|string)}. Please wrap the values: {(boolean|integer[])} (integer makes more sense as the type here, as a float is invalid). Please wrap the values: {(boolean|integer[])} (integer makes more sense as the type here, as a float is invalid). Please translate to English.. These values shouldn't be part of the XHR Settings as they're nothing to do with xhr. It would make a lot more sense if they were passed in as a config object just like the SpriteSheetFile does with its frameConfig object.. Don't do this unless the w/h !== the canvas w/h, it just adds un-needed gl ops.. Yes it needs enabling here.. This is a bit too short for such an important method really. It should at least explain where the gravity comes from (the world simulation) and that it causes this body to ignore that completely. It can also be toggled in real-time.. Should be something like:\nSet to true to ignore the effect of world gravity, or false to include it.\n. Unless target is given a default value > 0, there will never be a delay set, because this will always return zero.\nAlso, space after commas in argument lists.. The property name feels ambiguous. It's not clear from the name (or jsdoc) that it only impacts setTimeout.. Can you add a space before the open brace please. In fact, I think just The name of the layer, if specified in Tiled. would be fine.. The width in tiles of the layer (there's no such thing as a tile unit really). See width.. \ud83d\udc4d .

    "jessefreeman": "I noticed that shortly after I posted the issue. I guess if you wanted to style the canvas in some way via CSS. I guess it could all be done via code.\n. The issue I am running into is that I can't center the canvas when setting the scale mode to SHOW_ALL if the height of the windows is smaller that the aspect ratio allows which forces the canvas to the upper left. This should probably be closed out and a new bug created for that issue. I would just expect any element dynamically created by the engine to have an ID attached to it but that is just my own opinion.\n. you should probably clear the input bindings as well when switching states. This is how I came across the issue since game.input.onDown didn't automatically null itself out.\n. The larger issue I am running into is that the game does not store a reference to the current state. So for example I want my play state to contain logic for if the game is active, if the player is alive, etc. In Flixel, states were referenced by the main game so I could store state specific values in the state and not have to worry about keeping that kind of stuff in the main game class. So if I have an entity or utility that needs to talk directly to the active state itself I have to no way to access it since it's managed by the switchState method in game and not directly instantiated by the user.\nIn reference to your last point about not forcing you to extend State is even more reason to enforce an Interface to maintain an expected set of valid APIs on any class or object supplied to act as a State. I understand the complexity of adding and maintaining Interfaces but it's another feature of TypeScript that could help with larger games and there is no penalty on the JS side of things considering they are simply rules of validation for the compiler and the developer.\n. BTW, in Flixel I always got a reference to the state and recast it to my custom state class so I could access it. It's not clunk, that is how it works in typed languages. Not a deal breaker, it's a fine line to walk considering TS is mostly syntactical sugar for JS. In the end it doesn't make a difference on the output.\nRe the interface. Having a small interface is not that big of a deal. Where it would come in handy is if you had interfaces throughout the framework for IRender, IUpdate and combined them to build up your classes. It would require overhauling larger parts of the framework but would come in handy if people want to do injection to replace core classes in the framework. I agree it's not critical but could have some advantages.\nIn the end if more people use the JS side of Phaser then there is almost no point in taking advantage of the higher level stuff in TS like interfaces and stricter type casting.\n.

Re. not using grunt: but there is a Gruntfile.js in this project?\nI agree with being user-friendly, but I wonder if there's any alternatives, like making the docs Github pages, which libs like AFNetworking do. My experience with cloning Three.js is the initial download is sizeable, not sure how much due to the changesets it keeps for the docs. It's just in my opinion, it's not very clean to commit files that are generated and not really source, the source being the doc block itself. It either 1) makes it harder to read commits if they're included with the source changes, or 2) pollutes the commit history if they're made separate commits.\nAnyhow, it's just a question. I don't mind how this gets handled either way, and thanks for this exciting project and all your work and communication.\n. :+1:\n.

Just as a note browserify is not the only use-case for this being in NPM. I created a PR to contain all the work needed to prepare this package for NPM. #1132\n. @beeglebug There is a prescripts in the travis.yml to install grunt-cli, but since I added the prepublish script it seems to try to run it before travis runs the before_script this should be fixed by adding the install to travis's install script.\n. That is a pretty good point, I actually hadn't thought of it that way. I just like the idea of supporting all the exports of the Tiled tool. \nAs far as size increase, the full zlibjs lib is 24k + phase wrapper code.  But I think it can be smaller if you grab only the used parts of that library. \n. I think what I decided to do here is create a Tiled plugin that implements the full Tiled feature-set and uses a different rendering mechanism that is more geared towards large complex maps.\nIf you remember Rich we had a conversation a while ago about using a sprite-per-tile approach that are just moved around as the camera pans. That is what I did in grapefruit and had really good performance with many layers and complex maps so I am going to put that in a Phaser plugin and give it a whirl!\nThe main reason for this is the perf isn't where I want it to be for lttp maps, so this plugin should give me that perf and the special Tiled features I want to support. I'll update this thread when I get further along (this weekend is the target release).\n. I'll keep that in mind, and try to make the API as close as possible.\nI do want to try to make it a little less explicit with regards to layer creation, seemed strange to have to loop through my tilemap object and create each layer manually, and even specify tilesets and stuff when that all existed already in the Tiled data.\nThat also may stem from the fact that I was focusing on Tiled specifically (being feature complete with that editor) and you were doing a more generalized solution that didn't require tilemap metadata. Hopefully I can find a happy medium where it is created if it exists, and the manual methods still exist as well.\n. Just a quick update:\nPorted over most of the code for the tile rendering, and got it working (mostly). Need to write object group support, physics, and fix some bugs in the rendering layer. Definitely not going to finish today, hopefully next weekend.\nCheers!\n. Just a quick update:\nPorted over most of the code for the tile rendering, and got it working (mostly). Need to write object group support, physics, and fix some bugs in the rendering layer. Definitely not going to finish today, hopefully next weekend.\nCheers!\n. Another update:\nGot all the rendering code working well, now focusing on making the collisions work correctly. After that I want to complete the ObjectGroup implementation, then move on to making the API complete with the current implementation. Here is my specific (unordered) to do list:\n``` js\n// Layer Properties TODO:\n// - fixedToCamera\n// - cameraOffset\n// - tileColor\n// - rayStepRate\n// - wrap\n// - scrollFactor\n// Layer Methods TODO:\n// - getRayCastTiles\n// - getTiles\n// Map Methods TODO:\n// - Nearly all methods not related to rendering\n// Object Group TODO:\n// - object spritepool\n// - Test, only basically implemented right now\n// Image Layer TODO:\n// - Only image is shown, no metadata is used (pos, etc)\n// General TODO:\n// - Physics\n// - Rerender on resize/rescale\n// - Implement Tile object like in Phaser.Tile\n// - Tile render debug stuff\n// - Memory optimizations\n```\n. The core implementation on a map with 3 layers scrolling around I got 17-20ms per frame, right now I am rendering the same map scrolling around at 1-3ms per frame with my changes.\nThe map is the Link to the Past overworld (which is 256x256 tiles) has about 3-5 tile layers and 3-5 object layers.\n. Just did a quick optimization pass on the rendering code, now it takes about ~500ms to create the map (256x256 tiles, 3 layers, total of 196,608 tile objects created) but renders the panning map at <1ms on avg. Also able to implement some of the APIs used in Phaser since tiles are pre-generated now (raytracing, getTiles, etc).\n. Alright, I have pretty much finished the tile layer implementation; so I'm going to go ahead and open source this. You can tell in the README there is a still a ton of work to do to support all the tiled features, and current phaser API methods.\nhttps://github.com/englercj/phaser-tiled\nIf anyone is feeling frisky and wants to put in some PRs I would appreciate it!\n.

Just a heads up, this was an issue in PIXI but a change in Phaser is needed to propagate the fix.\nShort version is we didn't properly implement destroy for TilingSprite, and now it is.

That is, it just applies the filter to the backbuffer. However, when you have multiple filter passes (even just a passthrough) it has to render to an FBO first and then use that FBO as input to the next filter. Rending in FBO space instead of backbuffer space means that you lose anti-aliasing, OpenGL 2.0 doesn't support MSAA filtering on FBOs without a special extension. That extension is core in WebGL 2.0, but for now it in an extension (GL_EXT_framebuffer_multisample) and I'm not sure how widely supported the extension is. We usually avoid them because support is often pretty low.\nThere are a couple things you can do to try and work around this:\n1. Add the FXAA filter to your filter list, when you have multiple filters. That way the last step would be to apply a faux-AA step.\n2. Try to apply the multiple filters to different objects instead of the same object.\nBug 2:\nSee #2326 :)\n.

If not, you should try to make an invisible sprite (a rectangle) more narrow than the image itself, and put the image on top  for it to follow the invisible sprite. So the collision will affect the rectangle only.\nThe invisible rectangle is the yellow one:\n\n. @pietrofxq \n\nIt's because of the ~~image's~~ sprite's real size.\nNow i don't know anything about phaser, but maybe it has some sort of collision management system, like array points.

I created a map in Tiled using image collection. But when parseTiledJSON is called it shows me an error 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '2' of undefined' @phaser.js:93337. Checking the line is states sid = map.tiles[tile.index][2];. Was it fixed in the dev branch? I'am using version 2.4.5-dev. Any reply would be nice. Thanks.\n. Can this be supported in a newer version? I don't see a reason why this couldn't be applied to graphics.\n. Can this be supported in a newer version? I don't see a reason why this couldn't be applied to graphics.\n. I'm not sure if I am the only one, but I commented about this issue here: https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/commit/b6295391761b26aea5f069cadb6b548829efae30#commitcomment-16853934\nI applied that patch to my 2.4.3 and now my batches cannot even handle 5k+ images. (Usually 20k+are no problem). Using the same method the OP has provided in this thread.\nI even tested batching on 2.4.6 (latest phaser) and the batching is still around a 5k+ limit.  \nMy regular 2.4.3 version of phaser without the patch applied I can batch thousands of more sprites. This is done without animations on all versions. The commit that I commented on (linked above) is causing the decrease in performance though, the problem is isolated there.  Not sure what else I can do to try to solve this. I know this post is not much of help, but there is something going on lol\n. @benwiley4000 I think your problem is you have no alias for phaser in your package.json: https://github.com/thlorenz/browserify-shim#b-use-aliases. You also don't need to include pixi like mattstyles says. I'm currently trying to find out why I keep getting a call function property undefined involving Phaser.Device.__readyCheck after bundling. Unlike the original response though, I am not using globals since that would require including the required js files into your main html file.\n. @benwiley4000 I think your problem is you have no alias for phaser in your package.json: https://github.com/thlorenz/browserify-shim#b-use-aliases.

If you switch Phaser version to 2.4.5, does the choppiness increase?\n.

Created a new, more professional issue:\nhttps://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/issues/2885. Hello, I am experiencing the same issue on a specific PC on Chrome and Firefox (it's fine on Edge). Here is a link to Phaser forum where I've described it: http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/26690-tweens-running-slow-an-a-specific-pc-on-chrome/#comment-154159. Just a quick update: are you by any chance testing this on a high refresh rate monitor? I updated my post (the one linked in my previous reply) as I've found that my issue was only experinced on a 120hz monitor. Tweens were ok as I tuned that down to 60hz.. Why do these need to be global variable in the first place? Using process.env, part of the config, etc. Anything is better than relying on a webpack plugin.. Why do these need to be global variable in the first place? Using process.env, part of the config, etc. Anything is better than relying on a webpack plugin.. This can semi-reasonably be implemented manually. I had this rigged up in Phaser 2 with the following process:\n\nWhen map file is done loading, look for external tilesets and load them as JSON.\nWhen tileset JSON is done:\nLook for image reference and load it.\nMutate the original map data by replacing the tileset entry with the external data, keeping the firstgid field (kinda gross since really anything Phaser loads should probably be immutable). Make sure to remove the source property when merging the object or Phaser will throw because it bails out of parsing if source exists even if image and all of the other expected fields are there (ideally that warning case can be moved after the image case).\n\nComplications:\n\nIn Phaser 3, listening to file complete isn't as straightforward. I ran into issues where the data wasn't actually populated in the file yet when the loader fired the 'load' event (maybe a bug?), but implementing a new filetype and overriding methods worked better.\nIn Phaser 3, the loader doesn't allow adding new files while it's running (addFile explicitly does nothing if the loader is running; I actually came here to ask for that to be changed when I saw this issue).\nBuilt-in support for loading files referenced from other files seems complicated unless you make judgement calls around folder structure. Last I looked, Tiled JSON still references the files as .tsx with paths relative to whereever the tmx file was. It's not correct to assume that that's the case for exported JSON, so maybe it's best to leave that to the developer and instead make chainloading easier.\n\nI think the solution I had for Phaser 2 was fine (mutating the map data is gross, but in Phaser 3 I already need to do that in order to split layers by tileset since apparently tilemap layers can have only one tileset), minus the loader issue, though I'd appreciate anything that makes this pattern easier.\nI don't think embedding the tileset data in the map (whether manually or automatically) is the right solution for everyone because across many maps it's redundant, and it's harder for everything to stay in sync when using tile properties for game logic or whatever..

I'm going on vacation this week for a while, so it may take a bit but I'll try to do a lot more testing if I can.\nAt minimum, would you consider a separate PR for the fn.bind patch when it lands in PIXI?\n. Yeah.\nYou might want to think about accepting it on the bind polyfill though, pixi is using my changes in that. Maybe I'll get time for this when I get back into game dev.\n. In p2 setting collideWorldBounds only sets the collision bitmasks on existing shapes, and does not currently do it proactively.\nSee: https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/master/src/physics/p2/Body.js#L1763-L1793\nAfter thinking about it, I'm really not sure it should do this proactively.\n. @maxosprojects the tradeoff would be having to remove the bitmask each time you want to add a shape that is not a part of that bitmask, like a sensor.\nI would expect the current behaviour, though it should be documented.\n. This is terrible practice. Parsed JSON data would be stored as a text reference. JSON needs a separate cache.\n. Hmm.. this won't work here, will it? Phaser.Math._pxRatio?\n.

If you run it and get zero back, it just means there aren't any living children within it, so they are two very different outcomes.\n\nI would argue that these outcomes are different enough that countLiving shouldn't really be responsible for both.\nI'm curious what is use case here? Presumably something like\nvar living = group.countLiving()\nif(living < 0) {\n    // do something with empty group\n} else {\n    // do something with populated group\n}\nwould be more clearly written using:\nif(group.length === 0) {\n    // do something with empty group\n} else {\n    var living = group.countLiving()\n     // do something with full group\n}\n.

Just to chime in that we are having the same issue on iOS when rotating from landscape to portrait and back, with the same setup code, using NO_SCALE\n. If I understand the dilemma, you'd like something that supports this scenario:\n- A Zelda-style overhead view, with a character on it\n- Camera set up to follow the character\n- Scrolling the tilemap brings the character along\n- The camera potentially moves to adapt to the new position of the character.\nMaybe adding the ability to add the \"character\" to a tilemap layer? It's currently a Sprite so you could feasibly call addChild to explore. That way, moving the tilemap brings the character with it, and the camera follows. This probably fubars the physics even more though.\n. Yes, I get the same results.\nI should explain what the jsperf is testing:\nThere are three broad categories of tests - when the accel/gravity are both zero, when they are both 1, and when only gravity is non-zero. For each one, branching vs just multiplying is compared.\nI can't make any call about which one of those scenarios is most likely, however the big takeaway is this: When the bodies are mostly not moving, branching is much faster. When they mostly are moving, just multiplying is faster.\n. In practice though, this stuff is dwarfed by updateBounds. I have actually taken to replacing the updateBounds of non-rotating, non-scaling, non-offset sprites (the majority in our usage) with the following (in a PhaserPatch.js):\n```\nPhaser.Sprite.prototype.simpleUpdateBounds = function() {\nthis.updateFrame = true;\nthis.inWorld = true;\nthis.bounds.setTo(this.x + this.parent.x, this.y + this.parent.y, this.width, this.height);\nthis._cache.cameraVisible = this.renderable = Phaser.Rectangle.intersects(this.bounds, this.game.camera.view);\n\nif (this.body)  {\n    this.body.updateBounds(this.x + this.width / 2, this.y + this.height / 2, this._cache.scaleX, this._cache.scaleY);\n}\n\n};\n// call sprite.useSimpleBounds() to switch to the simple version\nPhaser.Sprite.prototype.useSimpleBounds = function() {\n    this.updateBounds = Phaser.Sprite.prototype.simpleUpdateBounds;\n};\n```\nI should probably open updateBounds performance as another issue though :)\n. Is that because topLeft isn't actually the top left of the bounds, but the transformed position of the top left corner of the sprite?\nOne point in favour of streamlining is that topLeft et al can be replaced with properties that calculate using getLocalPosition on demand.\nAs a single data point, we exclusively use bodies, with .collide and .overlap for collision handling, although we do set anchor points (and therefore offset) to non-zero positions.\n.

(which makes sense, since game.add.* just adds them to the world, which is a group...\n\nat 60fps it is a single pixel lag, but as the framerate drops it gets larger\n. I believe this is because Sprites are rendered in Sprite.postUpdate(), while TilemapLayers are rendered in TilemapLayer.update(). The call to camera.update() happens between these two calls, leading to the discrepancy.\nI believe the fix is in World.postUpdate(), to call the postUpdate() methods before the call to camera.update(). This addresses the problem and I haven't seen any ill effects from it. I'll submit a PR and Rich can see what he thinks.\n. I've submitted a PR to Pixi to fix this (#425). maybe they'll accept & merge soon enough for Rich to pull for Phaser 1.1.4\n. Pixi merged the fix and I submitted a PR to Phaser for the same fix - next time you pick up a new Pixi there shouldn't be an issue, with this fix anyway.\nthat ought to hold us until you rewrite it ;)\n. meaning time.physicsElapsed time? I assumed this was the issue at first, but I hard-coded it to 0.166 in Time.js and the issues still reproduce\n. the sprite->tile separation routines are using hullX and hullY rects to determine overlap and do separation, but the hullX and hullY rects weren't updated when sprite->sprite separation occurred. so if a sprite pushed another sprite into a tile, the second sprite wouldn't separate properly from the tile and could end up \"inside\" the tilemap, where all kinds of weird things would then happen.\nframerate issues seem to have been a red herring (or possibly a separate issue, since I still see odd things happen with collision/tilemaps at low framerates)\nthere could still be some odd ordering issues - I had to make sure that the order I check collisions in was sprites<->sprites first and then sprites<->tilemaps\n. the problem is at line 19 in the example code:\nbmd = game.add.bitmapData('ball', 32, 64);\nwhich calls the GameObjectFactor method\nbitmapData: function (width, height)\nwhich isn't expecting the 'name' parameter. name is therefore passed as width, and the browser javascript engine barfs\n. yeah, this is unpleasant:\nif the camera is updated between sprites and tile layers (as it was), then sprites' positions are off by a frame...\nif the camera is updated after sprites and tile layers (as it is with my PR), then the tile layers are drawn with the previous frames' camera position and we get an off-by-one-frame for them and fixedToCamera sprites...\nif the camera is updated before both (which I just tried), then the sprites and tile layers all seem to be drawn correctly (including fixedToCamera sprites), but physics is all messed up...\n:/\n. we should revert my fix as it doesn't get to the root of the issue. I'm not sure yet how to fix it properly\n. ok, I believe I have it.\nthe previous fix was wrong because the only thing out-of-place was where the TilemapLayer positioning/rendering was happening. moving the camera update affected other things things that it shouldn't have.\nfix then is to address only the TilemapLayer positioning/rendering (and to revert the previous change). I will have a PR shortly\n. nice! that must double the chances it's the right fix ;)\n. mine, of course! \nwell, I did break it, after all ;)\n. not I; close it.\n. better yet, why does Tilemap have a dirty flag at all when it only uses it to mark when a layer has changed. putTile (etc) should be setting the layer dirty, not the map.\n. probably it does so because the Tilemap doesn't have any pointers to the actual TilemapLayer objects, only their tile data. hrm :)\n. I think the immediate solution is for TilemapLayers to add themselves to a (new) array in the Tilemap when they are created (since they are passed their index and the tilemap at construction). The Tilemap can then use that array to dirty the layers and the layers can 'un-dirty' themselves when they render.\n. that makes sense. \neach 'layer' object in the tilemap (not TilemapLayer, but just the 'layers' array objects) can keep a dirty flag and the TilemapLayers can use those (since they have their index into that array). that makes for a nice, clean fix (no pun intended).\nI think, though, that the Tilemap.dirty flag actually goes away - otherwise, who clears it and when? the TilemapLayers don't know if/when it is safe to say that the Tilemap is not dirty. and if we know which layer array objects are actually dirty, then we don't need a 'global' flag any more, right?\n. might need more details - I use Groups between TilemapLayers and it draws correctly...\n. I'm afraid there's probably more to it than that - i'm using names for my Groups and not seeing this problem\n. actually, I may have spoken too soon. I'm adding the name after the Group is created. adding it with the name parameter does indeed seem to cause problems.\n. yep, works in my case\n. Fixes #216\n. from forum thread:\n\"it looks like if I pass a Tile object to putTile, rather than an index, that this would work. but I believe an index ought to work properly as well.\n...the culprit is that the same Tile object is retained in memory and only the index is changed - so its collides property etc aren't updated...\nbecause the list of 'collide-able' tile indices is not saved anywhere, there's no quick way to make putTile correctly set the 'collides' property if it is given a tile index. the work-around, as stated above, is to pass a complete Tile object rather than an index...\"\n. actually, passing the Tile object worked when I wrote that in the forums (pre-1.1.4 release) but doesn't work any longer - the collision data isn't updated\n.

If my investigation finds something relevant, I'll update you. \n. Ok, I got it. I implemented a plugin such that stat.begin() is called during preUpdate and stat.end() is called during postRender(). What I find then is that I get the same results across platforms, with an expected flat graph when nothing is happening in the game.

    "roryokane": "Ah, that makes sense. Here\u2019s a possible revision:\n\nJetBrains WebStorm is an extremely advanced fully development environment. It goes well beyond simple code editing and offers all of the high-level features you'd expect from a proper IDE, including code-insight, npm built-in, code style/syntax reports, source control and a wealth of other features designed more for web developers than game developers. It's written in Java, which means it suffers from weaker OS integration and speed. And the actual code editing experience is nothing like as smooth and freeform as with Sublime. However, the power features can often make up for that. Having errors with your code spotted for you, before you've even tested your game, can be really useful. And code-completion is great too, although obviously somewhat limited by the myriad ways JavaScript can be written.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say Java means weak UI but lots of features \u2013 programs written in any language could have lots of features. And any weakness in the UI design of Webstorm (as opposed to weakness in OS integration) is more caused by the program trying to support lots of features than it being in Java.

    "DarkDev-": "Had the same problem with a project I'm working on. The problem occurs from numTweens which caches the value of  length from the tweens array (which shouldn't make any difference than using length on the array itself cause it probably already is cached). If the number of tweens changes within the execution of an update on a tween, it will after that try to update the next tween which in this case doesn't exist anymore. This can be fixed by changing \nwhile ( i < numTweens ) {\ninto\nwhile ( i < this._tweens.length ) {\nand also remove all uses of numTweens.\n. It occurs when you change the number of tweens (remove,removeall and such) in a callback function on an active tween. I used tweens for animating some sprites before changing state, which I did on one of the complete callbacks from one of the tweens. When you change state the current tweens are removed from the array. So when the execution returned after the callback were complete, all tweens were removed while numTweens still held the old amount of tweens which resulted in the error.\n. ",

However, I am not really comfortable making a pull request.  Before I wrote this ticket, I read that XDomainRequest specifically exists to allow cross domain scripting which IE does not natively support with XHR. \nWe do not yet have a test case where we have the game running on an IFrame from a different domain. I will try to get one setup and test but I am away myself for a couple of weeks so there might be a delay.\n. Sounds good! Cheers for your help on this.  :dancer: \n. Man the list of package managers or build tools is crazy. \n. @sompylasar sorry for off topic again! Browserify + webpack is new to me. \nWhat I am thinking here, is that these tools are superfluous?  Just on the grounds that Phaser works as expected. This ticket is saying that the resource managers being used are not compatible with Phaser or vice versa.  (But close your eyes and throw a dart at any JS lib, it cannot just be phaser with these issues?). \nIt seems any problem which these tools claim to solve are just creating more problems, and soon there will be \"AnotherXName\" project which claims to be better solving these problems... Just like the Browserify > WebPack stuff above has done. Then after that.... another one will come along claiming to solve it. \nWhat is wrong with just standard JS when it comes to something as important as structure?\n. @sompylasar sorry for off topic again!

Yeah here is good. \nPhaser.StateCycle should really have been an interface but it is a relic.

If mat released 2.9.9 tomorrow, would you plan on using it or have we passed that point?\n@Bilge  Can I ask your advice on an unrelated matter?\nWould you say that these commits (see link below) are Interfaces in a definition file?

We are on the same page then. I am not making any pixi3 at this time. The last time I checked pixi was Jan 1st.  I wondered if they were going to break it down into modules etc or as you said, have basically shelved it. I will track only phaser (which means just a review of unions).\n2) Awesome!  \nClark.\n.

Many of these classes extend PIXI.DisplayObjectContainer in some way and so inherit the width and height of that class.

Are you using an old version of the definition file?\nLine 2115:\nfromArray(array: number[]): Phaser.Matrix;\n. I am also trying to profile something similar. I am not convinced it is related only to tweens. I have 6 Phaser.Image instances which I loop over on the update loop shifting their y += 5.   This lags in a similar way but the annoying thing is that I cannot narrow it down.  I cut my asset resolution in half (got rid of native retina) and yeah its faster, but the grind is still there the same so I ruled that out really. \nforceSingleUpdate kind of does a little better but the gained smoothness still is invalidated by the grind so this setting is preferable but the issue remains. I have also not noticed a major difference between canvas and webgl on my ipad.  Even so, neither solves the problem. \nThe reason I am using my Ipad, is because It happens on my desktop as well across all browsers.

I am also trying to profile something similar. I am not convinced it is related only to tweens. I have 6 Phaser.Image instances which I loop over on the update loop shifting their y += 5.   This lags in a similar way but the annoying thing is that I cannot narrow it down.  I cut my asset resolution in half (got rid of native retina) and yeah its faster, but the grind is still there the same so I ruled that out really. \nforceSingleUpdate kind of does a little better but the gained smoothness still is invalidated by the grind so this setting is preferable but the issue remains. I have also not noticed a major difference between canvas and webgl on my ipad.  Even so, neither solves the problem. \nThe reason I am using my Ipad, is because It happens on my desktop as well across all browsers.

Ahh the Schroeder's cat, its state changes when you observe it! . :+1: for json tip, it took me ages to figure out I had to use toString() because of it. \n. Almost all of my days are spent stressed out with these types of structural question right now :( \n. Honestly mate, the pendingDestroy one and Cache would have aged me! Considering you are dealing with the full mental load of Phaser dev even these were like Christmas Morning Gifts. \nPS 9000 stars! Must be great to see people using something of this scope that you started! Here is to 2.4 and another 9000 stars! :dancer:\n. This is a bit of a gray zone for me, @photonstorm has been working away on modules last week but I am not sure how it relates to the definitions or if anything needs to change? I have no experience of using modular imports with phaser yet.\nThe problem area may be the declare module Phaser on the d.ts file but to me that appears to be declaring a module.... So its very confusing if It does not work. \n. :+1: \n. Oh I meant to add to this! \nI do not use DT so I cannot really say anything about it.  \nWriting meaningful tests in Phaser would be hard just simply due to the amount of capability it offers.  In Pixi V3, I re-wrote examples in TypeScript, and then put all of them into a flat pixi-tests.ts file. Pixi is small enough to be manageable. I feel that, without effort, I can maintain almost all the small functionality of Pixi by maintaining 10-12 test examples.\nPhaser has something like 100 examples, and even these do not seem to cover the entire capability of what Phaser can do.  It becomes a question of who wants to write (and Maintain) the commit history of all the examples?  I can only say I have not found the time to do it and until the community grows, it may never be done. \nActually one thing I will say about DT is that I do not 100% get it.  If phaser.d.ts goes to DT, does it mean essentially mean there is now 2 competing definitions? That PRs will occur in 2 places and essentially go off on different paths? \n. Good catch and for some reason it is blowing my mind! \nAs you said the BitmapText does appear to accept an alignment property here. \nhttps://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/dev/src/gameobjects/BitmapText.js#L54\nPhaser.BitmapText = function (game, x, y, font, text, size, align)\nBut not here\nhttps://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/dev/src/gameobjects/GameObjectFactory.js#L423\nbitmapText: function (x, y, font, text, size, group)\n@photonstorm  should the GameObjectFactory above accept the align param?\n. Thanks for this!\nDo you want to make a PR on the dev branch? To be honest, what confuses me is that I cannot find the \"BitmapFont\" class.  Does anyone where it lives? \n. No problem :dancer:  I went over to the phaser examples (awesome work on live editing sandbox @photonstorm !) and console logged out the return object. You were pretty much spot on.  I do not know what kerning is either but it seems to be an array of numbers.  \nHopefully it should fix the problem.\n. I always thought it was some kind of Skewing..... Old Flash misunderstanding.  You learn something new everyday!\n. I am pretty sure I read that the original authors kind of gave up on it and so it was removed for the above reason. Although do not quote me. \n. I have been shifted to dom based projects for a good long time and have fallen out of touch somewhat with this side of the net. \nThe definition files were manually created and at the time, the rate of change of pace was pretty rapid. Sometimes it would take hours a week to maintain the commit history.  Had comments been involved, then it would have been impossible to compare 2 files easily without scrolling through 10 times as many lines. \nA cool dude came along and merged docs into the phaser.d.ts file to give us the comments. I only ever maintained the original phaser.d.ts and as far as I am aware, the phaser-comments.d.ts is just the original merged. \n. I wish I was back on game work :(\nReminds me of my old stack question. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29593905/typescript-declaration-extending-class-with-static-method/29595798#29595798\ndeclare class DisplayObject {\n    static generateTexture(): RenderTexture;\n}\nInclude the same signature from the primary above to the other class and overload it.  \ndeclare class Graphics extends DisplayObject {\n    static generateTexture(): RenderTexture;\n    static generateTexture(): Texture;\n}\nDoes it work? \n. Yeah totally but that is a different issue.  What you see today in JS is valid and correct JS. If TypeScript cannot define it, then you must work around it.  \nIf you want to change the implementation, you have the much bigger job of making a PR which is going to be bug free, and not break 1000 peoples existing games for the sake of a function overload.\n. I still don't have any idea how to automate this process \ud83d\udc4e The most promising idea I have heard is some kind of JSDoc but at the end of the day I never had a clue on where to start and I suspect some of the \"patterns\" and \"invented interfaces\" I have seen in my time simply cannot be automated from the information that is there untyped. Manually updating the definition file gets incredibly tedious and is open to a lot of inaccuracy as projects scale. \nI would love to hear anyone's thoughts on this subject. . Phaser 2 started as a TypeScript project back in the day! Rich was an early adopter and got some wounds from the rapidly evolving eco system and lack of tools, as well as lack of people with the skills to make PR requests. \nSo it is hard to be the judge of the whole history of the project.  It does mean we have no real access to Phaser 3 which sucks because I also look down my nose at rawJS like it is Victorian times and consider it uncouth. \ud83d\ude1b  . ",

    "georgiee": "I forgot the reason why I thought about this:\nThere is no clean way to access a mid tween in a tween chain to modify it (callbacks etc.)\n``` js\ntween = game.add.tween(stage_object)\nup = tween.to(y: -80, 500, Phaser.Easing.Quadratic.InOut)\n//won't work, method #to passes back a reference to tween not the just created tween\n//you're actually calling tween.onUpdateCallback\nup.onUpdateCallback(onUpdateUp)\ndown = tween.to(y: 0, 500, Phaser.Easing.Quadratic.InOut)\n//same behaviour. you're actually calling tween.onUpdateCallback\ndown.onUpdateCallback(onUpdateDown)\n```\nIn words: We get back a reference to the base tween from #to (to accomplish chaining). There is no 'official' way to access the just created one.\nWorkaround: \nExplicit read the last created tween with tween#_lastChild (which is denoted as private)\n``` js\ntween = game.add.tween(stage_object)\nup = tween.to(y: -80, 500, Phaser.Easing.Quadratic.InOut)._lastChild\nup.onUpdateCallback(onUpdateUp)\ndown = tween.to(y: 0, 500, Phaser.Easing.Quadratic.InOut)._lastChild\ndown.onUpdateCallback(onUpdateDown)\n```\nThat's ugly, isn't it ?\nShould I use _lastChild or should I propose a better way to access _lastChild ? My initial proposal seems only to fix a related problem to this.\n. Closed. My workaround worked and I never had a problem again with tweening :)\n. I just updated the 1.2 branch to d583b364bd650aa9950ccf0c01e1dba12cc39913.\nIt is still happening. I tried it as an instance in your 'Virtual Machine' which is used for the examples and I also tried it as a standalone app.\nWhen I log game.time.now inside Phaser.State#create it is still 0.\nThe stack trace is as follows:\ncreate (phaser-viewer.js:10)\nPhaser.StateManager.loadComplete (StateManager.js:401)\nPhaser.Game.loadComplete (Game.js:581)\nPhaser.StateManager.start (StateManager.js:269)\nPhaser.StateManager.add (StateManager.js:165)\nPhaser.StateManager.boot (StateManager.js:125)\nPhaser.Game.boot (Game.js:471)\n_onBoot (Game.js:294)\nAlthough you call this.raf.start(); in Game.js:469 before this.state.boot(); in Game.js:471 the state is created before the first update is called by window.requestAnimationFrame. So your new boot order didn't fix this. But isn't the order irrelevant in this case ? Imagine you have a super fast computer which can boot and prepare everything in 0 seconds. If the boot order is really fixed and the time is updated before the first create you have still a current time of 0ms (or 1ms or 10ms or 50ms). As long as game.time.now is lower than the first tick of a repeating timer you get negative ticks.\nI can proof this behaviour by fixing it:\nTake my example from the top. This causes a negative tick as the boot time is lower than the tick delay. I can fix this by a single line in RequestAnimationFrame.js\n```\nstart: function () {\n        this.isRunning = true;\n    var _this = this;\n\n    if (!window.requestAnimationFrame)\n    {\n        this._isSetTimeOut = true;\n\n        this._onLoop = function () {\n            return _this.updateSetTimeout();\n        };\n\n        this._timeOutID = window.setTimeout(this._onLoop, 0);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        this._isSetTimeOut = false;\n\n        this._onLoop = function (time) {\n            return _this.updateRAF(time);\n        };\n\n        this._timeOutID = window.requestAnimationFrame(this._onLoop);\n    }\n    //RequestAnimationFrame.js:91\n    //Fix for the given example. \n    //I force a time update instead of waiting for requestAnimationFrame and\n    //pass my very own timestamp. It's just a millisecond higher than my delay from the example.\n    //Et voil\u00e0 ! Works. Unfortunately only for this example :)\n    this._onLoop(501)\n\n},\n\n```\nSo I guess there are two options:\nChange the tick calculation so it's never negative or let the queued events wait until the game time is fine ? Those milliseconds we would wait doesn't matter in the beginning.\nI hope that helps.\n. There is no dirty workaround so I tried to fix it. Feels good in my game until now\nSee the diff here:\n~~https://github.com/georgiee/phaser/commit/c4d334ec5ab16aa3fe12b901c41770ca638c2f60~~\nhttps://github.com/georgiee/phaser/commit/034bbc1b626e7a680fece4a5b61e8bab48a7cc97\nI introduced two new methods Phaser.Timer#hold and Phaser.Timer#recover to distinct the global pause/resume from a more local (explicit) one. Those two new methods replace the resume and pause methods. ~~Our new pause and resume methods only set the paused flag- we do not need any special routine to catch up as the pause is never implicit. Correct ?~~\nIf this is fine and I do not find any side effects I will create a pull request in the next days.\n. I decided not to use the internal phaser timer. It stands more in the way than it is useable for me now. I invested an afternoon instead and created my very own implementation of a timer and hooked it into phaser. \nI used the here proposed concept of hold & recover so that Phaser can pause/resume my game automatically. I focussed on time instead on events like you have done with Phaser.Timer. This means: Every Timer runs forever with a specified tick after a delay and I can attach single events to a timer which get fired only once.\nMy description for a timer I imagined:\n- Run a timer forever (so: no counter at all)\n- tick & delay: Trigger an tick event every N milliseconds\n- 'time events': Register a function that should be called after M milliseconds. Only once. Hook it into an existing timer so it can get paused.\nSo it's pretty obvious that Phaser.Timer did not match my expectations. In combination with some severe bugs it was standing in my way all the time. \nI finished my own Timer and want to share it 'as it is' here. As it is means: Coffescript and not fully tested. It works well in my own game and I can finally progress to other parts of my game using all the other mature parts of Phaser :)\nHere my commit with the new timer implementation: (coffeescript & backbone for now, this is the 'at is is')\nhttps://github.com/georgiee/phaser/commit/d614383bcede6d6dcfc138fc25b82468b2f11a3e\nAnd this is how I use it in my current game.\n``` coffeescript\nwindow.Timer = { }\nFactory to create all timers. Timers created through this factory\nwill be registered and holded when Phaser.Game pauses itself (onResume/onResume)\nhold is not paused. It's a state called exclusively by the system.\npause/resume: manual, hold/recover: system, precedence over all pause states\ntimerFactory = new Time.TimerFactory(phaser.game)\ncreate a timer to count seconds\nmainTimer = timerFactory.create(1000,'Main Timer')\nmainTimer.on('tick', onEverySeconds)\ncreate another timer to spawn something\nspawnTimer = timerFactory.create(5000,'Spawn Timer')\nspawnTimer.on('tick', onNewMonster)\nAttach an event to the spawn timer, for example after a click\nWhen the timer itself is paused this event will pause too.\nspawnTimer.event(10000, onBridgeClosed, param1, param2)\ncallbacks\nonEverySeconds = ->\n  console.log 'a new second'\nonNewMonster = ->\n  console.log 'a new monster'\nonBridgeClosed = ->\n  console.log 'Ten seconds are up. Close the bridge. Get eaten by the monsters.'\n```\n. To round it up: These are all the problems I faced with Phaser.Timer. I really tried to fix them and contribute something back to the community. But I wasn't successful. I often mixed up 'fixing a bug' with 'fixing a feature to adapt it to my requirement'. Never a good combination :)\n- Pause/Resume mixed up. My manual pause is resumed by the system (this issue talks about it)\n- Wrong timer catch up. After I unfocussed and focussed the system again (+ maybe interrupted by a breakpoint) the timer went insane and counted up in every single update step (instead of the specified delay of 1000ms for example). I mentioned this in #366 (see: 'get the following output nearly immediately')\n- That famous 'tick' error when I use stop. Man that was annoying. Whenever I called Phaser.Timer#stop during a timer event I got a 'tick' error. I described it here #367 and here #360\n- Ugly negativ tick bug #366 \n- Events are removed when I stop the timer. This is TOTALLY unexpected behaviour for me and there is no possibility to stop the timer from removing. I want a timer that run forever (only stopped by pause or stop) and dispatches a tick every (delay) milliseconds. Phaser.Timer removes my forever running event after a #stop and I have to reinitialize everything again. I never created a ticket for this, as I thought Phaser.Timer is doing the one and only right way. But it's simple: My requirements differ from Phaser.Timer.\n- Maybe: A timer were expired event that I added a new event. I had this problem sometimes, but could not reproduce it. So only 'maybe' and I never created a ticket for it.\n. Hi all,\nPaul Irish just mentioned that unregister will be available soon in the CLI and that there is already a manual way to do it. Look at this:\nhttps://github.com/bower/bower/issues/120#issuecomment-40023145\ncurl -X DELETE \"https://bower.herokuapp.com/packages/PACKAGE?auth_token=TOKEN\"\n@nDmitry Could you try it with curl? You can also wait for the CLI version. I interpret the available soon in the comment as days not weeks. But please coordinate the deletion with @photonstorm so nobody else picks it up in the meantime :) Thanks!\n. Whoa that was fast :) Nice! I'm currently working on the vanilla debug drawer. You said the PhysicsItem would be sufficient- as it's the core of the whole drawing. Is this still your opinion? \nDo you want to integrate this drawer as a component of Phaser.Physics.P2.Body (i.e. sprite.body.debugDrawer)? So it's easily adaptable for the other physics engines ? Or do you have another idea for this? Happy working day!\n. Hi Rich,\nI think you can see both functions called as I switched from the dev panel to the content after I started the recording. I just tried it again and used the shortcut to record. Now I can see only one of those functions, so everything is fine.\nBy the way, my fan keeps calm now so I think this was a glitch in Chrome itself (which I have restarted in the meantime). I'm looking forward to the official Phaser 2.0 release! Will be a great day :)\n. By the way, another cosmetic bug with the hand cursor in this example.\nWhen you try the example with a scale of 0.01 you can see the bunny as a tiny dot.\nThe hand cursor detection doesn't detect the shape right in this scale. So it happens that when you hover some times over the tiny bunny you will be left with a hand cursor even that you are not over the bunny anymore.\n. And for the records:\nIf you have the hand cursor enabled and you destroy the sprite by clicking on it you can't get rid of the hand cursor anymore- well you can but only by hovering over another sprite with an enabled hand cursor.\nYou should clear the hand cursor style when the sprite gets destroyed & the last reported state was over. A very dirty workaround is clearing the hand cursor yourself just before you destroy the sprite.\ngame.canvas.style.cursor = 'default'\n. Yes Rich. Everything is fixed! Thanks a lot.\n. I just pushed another commit so that you can work with the separate fixtures. The last version ended in a big list of vertices inside the polygon and there was no way to retrieve them. Now they're returned by the addPhaserPolygon (renamed) method. In addition to this the group index from PhysicsEditor is written out from the exporter and parsed in phaser. So you can great nice groups of fixtures to work with.\nShort example.

Ah good to know that you're going to remove it. So I can drop my workaround. I focussed on finding a solution inside of phaser but this just convinced me to try the DOM solution.\nI controlled that coordinate mess in flash so it should be controllable in phaser ;) I mean that was THE way to go in flash (NO_SCALE, TOP_LEFT, listen to Event.RESIZE) and opened the doors for some beautiful liquid websites. I can think about situations where this could get handy for some games.\nYou could fill small px differences between devices that show up as black bars in the current SHOW_ALL mode. Maybe you want to match the world bounds with the measurements of the device to create worlds that are unscaled & crispy on all devices and use every pixel available . These two use cases alone are far more useful than a scaled version of my game with a wrong aspect ratio like you get with EXACT_FIT. Does anybody really use this scaling mode in the wild? :) \nSo yeah. Just don't care for the mess :) Give use the possibility to use every unscaled pixel by updating what is needed in the core and dispatch the resize event. From then on the rest in on us! Promised! Thank you for considering this feature!\n. You nailed it. Simple as this! :)  Combine it with a resize event and a user can do whatever he wants with the additional space on the lower right corner.\n. Awesome!! Thank you Rich! I'm looking forward to try some flash like alignments finally in phaser :)\n. And all the problems are gone :) \nI just tried every combination of disableVisiblityChange, manual & code pause & useElapsedTime.\nEverything worked- so this issue is done! Thank you rich!  Good job :ok_hand: \nThere is only one (somehow related) special scenario still makes problems: \nset disableVisibilityChange to true, change the tab, wait some seconds and then go back. The timer seems to go nuts, but they are actually catching up. You can see clearly in the log when I switched back (7423), then the catch up phase and then the normal behaviour again. This should also be fixable as we could detect the very large time diff and reset the timer accordingly, shouldn't it ?\n```\n\n\n\ntime diff (should be 500): 499\ntime diff (should be 500): 499\ntime diff (should be 500): 500\ntime diff (should be 500): 500\ntime diff (should be 500): 7423\ntime diff (should be 500): 35\ntime diff (should be 500): 10\ntime diff (should be 500): 16\ntime diff (should be 500): 15\ntime diff (should be 500): 16\ntime diff (should be 500): 16\ntime diff (should be 500): 16\ntime diff (should be 500): 34\ntime diff (should be 500): 33\ntime diff (should be 500): 34\ntime diff (should be 500): 34\ntime diff (should be 500): 33\ntime diff (should be 500): 32\ntime diff (should be 500): 49\ntime diff (should be 500): 199\ntime diff (should be 500): 500 \n```\n\n\n\nThis is the code to to test. Execute it, switch the tab and go back. I know that tab switching is somewhat uncontrollable- so is it worth to dig deeper ? I think the occuring large time delta (when measured) is promising.\n```\n    game.stage.disableVisibilityChange = true\n    before = +new Date()\ngame.time.events.loop(500, function(){\n  console.log('>>> time diff (should be 500): ', (+new Date() - before) );\n  before = +new Date();\n})\n\n```\nNow I will have a look at your changes. Thank you!\n. Here another problem:\nManual mute > manual pause >  manual resume = Sound on\nManual mute > code pause > code resume = Sound still off (Therefore it works as expected)\nOr more explicitly:\ngame.sound.mute = true\ngame.sound.paused = true\ngame.paused = true\n//now sound is unmuted again\n. Now with disableVisibilityChange = true I have back the problem where I need to defer the start of the game by 50ms with setTimeout so that my timers are running. It's only a problem during startup- later in the game everything works fine. It seems that every timer event which is created before the game starts is never fired.\nI can even work around it by delaying the flag setter:\nsetTimeout( function(game.stage.disableVisibilityChange = true ){}, 500)\nSo it's clearly something that happen only during startup.\nMaybe this should be skipped in the first step ?\nif (this.game.stage.disableVisibilityChange && this.elapsed > this.timeCap)\n        {\n            //  For some reason the time between now and the last time the game was updated was larger than our timeCap\n            //  This can happen if the Stage.disableVisibilityChange is true and you swap tabs, which makes the raf pause.\n            //  In this case we'll drop to some default values to stop the game timers going nuts.\n            this.elapsed = 1 / 30;\n        }\n. I'm doing it in the create method of my state. Also in the create method there is my class creating all those timers. It doesn't matter how I order them, disableVisibilityChange stops them from being executed in the first place. I try to build a demo for this behaviour.\n. It's something with manual created timers. The following example won't work unless you set game.stage.disableVisibilityChange = false. You will only see the message hello default event as this is dispatched by the default game timer- which works apparently.\n```\ncreate: function(){\n  game.stage.disableVisibilityChange = true;\n  timer = game.time.create(false);\ntimer.repeat(500, 10, function() {\n    console.log('>>> hello repeat');\n  });\ntimer.add(500, function() {\n    console.log('>>> hello event');\n  });\ntimer.start();\ngame.time.events.add(500, function(){\n    console.log('>>> hello default event');\n  });\n}\n```\nIt's not related to the timer.start() because even when I delayed that call via setTimeout it's not running.\nRegards George\n. Ahh lovely error, so the timer is only a little bit delayed :) I can confirm your fix, works for me now :+1: \nSo the last problem is the one with the sound + manual pause. Have you already reproduced that error or do I need to provide a quick demo? (Error is still there with the latest commit). After this everything is fixed with the timers!\n. YES. Confirmed!\n//  It is entirely possible to un-mute audio WHILE a game is paused.\nAbsolutely.\nIn fact this is the second thing I tested and I would have been disappointed if you had fixed it!\nTimer Fixing Mission completed. Thanks a lot! Another step to a Phaser Library without any complaints :)\n. That would be great! It would be a shame to let Phaser not fully support IE9 because of some small parts in the code. Maybe you can already merge that p2 change (Utils.ARRAY_TYPE = window.Float32Array || Array; cited from englercj, https://github.com/schteppe/p2.js/pull/83) in the bundled p2 version until Stefan merges it? Then you could mark 2.0.4 as fully IE9 compatible! (minus the things we might have missed)\nRegards George\n. Yes! You're right. That's because Phaser's addPolygon method passes the polygon creation straight to P2, and P2 does the clearing itself. Just look at the Remove all shapes comment.\n```\nBody.prototype.fromPolygon = function(path,options){\n    options = options || {};\n// Remove all shapes\nfor(var i=this.shapes.length; i>=0; --i)\n    this.removeShape(this.shapes[i]);\n\n```\nTry to save the shapes in an external file and use the methods loadPolygon or addPhaserPolygon or even try the undocumented method addFixture which is the internal method used by addPhaserPolygon\nIt's well known that polygon loading has not the best documentation nor a very consistent implementation. I also mentioned addPolygon in an issue that it's using P2 to create a shape: https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/pull/749\nThat's causing other issues and needs to be fixed. Maybe we will get it fixed in 2.0.5.\nRegards George\n. ta-da!\n. ta-da!\n. > On the flip-side perhaps some tests are better than none at all?\nAbsolutely!

I'm currently prototyping for an upcoming project where I need Phaser instead of a Pixi only environment. I always wondered how many places I would have to change in Phaser to use Pixi.js V3. To my surprise this looks more or less like the default Pixi v2 to v3 converting process. I'm looking forward to the moment where pixi is bug free enough to get merged. \n. Oh thanks for this.

Hey, \nI don't get your 'bad environment'. Is it a single computer which shows these glitches on every OS ? Or do you have many systems with those symptoms at hand? There are so many things involved. It could go as far as that your gpu, ssd or whatever in the pipeline is a little bit broken. \nYou should really get an example online so that other people can try it themselves. Strip your code down even more. Remove Phaser. Try it only with PIXI, try it with other texture uploading engines or even with your very own texture upload in webgl.\nMaybe it's worth to ask the folks over at the developer mailing lists of blink, the chrome rendering engine, for insights about the huge data transfer rate you get?\n.

Maybe that's the reason why you do not see that's it's actually doing something.\nit nearly duplicates the data structure given from addPhasePolygon. But I need to flatten some arrays in here so we need to keep that parse function for now. \n. ",

In our cross platform C++ (GameHouse/Blue Giraffe) engine we have more than one aspect ratio: the maxAR and minAR. We usually set minAR to 4/3 and maxAR to 16/9 (although Android devices go up to 16/8.5).\nThen you can lock the AR to either \"width\" or \"height\". What this means is that the renderer always either shows you the full height, but clips off a part of the sides in 4/3, - or - shows you the full width, but clips off a part of the top&bottom in 16/9.\nIt's important that no pixels are squashed (square AR per pixel) by AR sizes within the min/maxAR, but we have another feature: when the screen gets too wide, we can control how much we let the renderer 'stretch' the game to prevent black bars. (Usually up to 16/8). Stretching in height is just plain ugly so that's not allowed.\nIf the AR goes even beyond these min/max values plus allowedStretch, the stage is surrounded by black bars of course (letterboxing).\nOne last feature could be: set a 'cut off fraction' so that when the game is cut off at the top&bottom (locked to width), you can control how much is cut off at the top and how much on the bottom. 0 would mean \"snap to top\", 0.5 \"middle cut off\", etc. In our games for instance, we'd rather cut off some of the top than the bottom, so we set it to 0.8. The amount that got cut off is a static variable accessible in the engine, cutoffOffset {x, y}, you can use in your game to position the menu bars etc.\nWe're doing the first part of this technique now for our HTML5 venture and I wouldn't want it any other way :-)\n I'll try to send you a video later on.\n. (Don't mind the programmer art and lack of originality of this try-out :-)\nhttp://youtu.be/UF2EbgATFvE\n. Upvote. Sorry but I have to support this kind of PR again.\nBasically I'm up to a point where I don't care what the internal design considerations are, I want a way to position a Bitmap font label the same way as a TTF label.\nAll displayable objects that have a size must have an anchor point. That result in the same effect.\nUsers want it. It's possible. It's not slowing the engine down. Anchor point for registration!\n(And I'd rather not have it as a pivot point, that's for linear transformations like scale, skew & rotate)\n. (Pseudo code)\nif (sprite.paused)\n{\n     sprite.paused = false;\n}\nelse\n{\n     sprite.play();\n}\nbecomes\nsprite.resume();\nI'd rather have play() do the above functionality and you'd have to call stop() to reset the frame to 0 etc, but that would break current games.\n. New code then:\n                    if (this.loop === true)\n                    {\n                        this._frameIndex %= this._frames.length;\n                        this.currentFrame = this._frameData.getFrame(this._frames[this._frameIndex]);\n                        this._parent.events.onAnimationLoop.dispatch(this._parent, this);\n                        this.onLoop.dispatch(this._parent, this);\n                    }\n                    else if (this.loopCount >= this.loop)\n                    {\n                        this.complete();\n                    }\n. - Maybe instead of having dedicated booleans (checkAlive, checkVisible), you could have a node validation callback passed in:\nvar child = this.children[i]; // Temp var to save an extra array lookup...\nif (!validate || validate(child))\n\n\nExpert challenge: Could you extend the .split(.) with logic that finds [\" ... \"]?\nWhat if a user inputs \"this.frame   .  x\" (which is valid JavaScript)? \\t\\n< space >\n. All valid points. I was thinking from a pure utility function standpoint, like when a game author would use it. Not if it were intended for the core engine implementation.\n\n(Example: this[\"frame\"].x = 3  <--- again, misunderstood the intended audience...)\n. I might be using it wrong then:\n    this.game.state.add(\"PlayScene\", App.PlayScene);\n    this.game.state.start(\"PlayScene\");\n    this.game.state.remove(\"Preload\");\nThis way, I come across StateManager.remove before I come across StateManager.preUpdate...\nHmmm, not sure how to counter that best without having to assign StateManager's this.current in StateManager.start already....\nif (this.current === key && !this._pendingState)?\nThe root of the problem is that state callbacks are overwritten, so you can't use this.onShutDownCallback = this.dummy; again.\nIf I may ask, why is onShutDownCallback assigned a dummy? Is that because of performance? The if-check is a valid option without the dummy assignment, right?\n. I'm using the above 3 functions to jump to the next state. Until now, the onShutDownCallback is the only error I got. I use it from within button click handlers and within the update function.\nNow, I'm leaning towards auto-remove previous state functionality, because until now, I never want to keep a scene that's no longer used. The other option is to check for (and remove) all possible pre-states in a state's create function?\n.

There isn't a single part\nof Phaser that isn't documented and nearly all have examples as well. The\nparts that we're yet to find a way to integrate properly into Phaser are\nall the Pixi level methods and properties (such as Graphics.drawRects),\nalthough they are documented on the Pixi site. Once we find a way to merge\nYUIdoc with jsdoc (easier said than done) we can incorporate their docs\ninto ours. Or we may have to just bite the bullet and re-write all of their\ndocs into jsdoc.

This adds them to an array of Sprites, called children in\nthe parent Sprite. However, working with indexes can be tricky and a bit\ndifficult. If you need to attach a lot of child Sprites to another Sprite\nand then manipulate them, you need to know at which index they're located.\nMy suggestion is to add an additional argument to addChild() and get the\nfollowing:\nvar myParent = game.add.sprite(0, 0, 'image'),\n    myChild = game.add.sprite(0, 0, 'image2');\nmyParent.addChild(myChild, 'myChlidName');\nmyParent.children.myChildName.alpha = 0.5; // or something else\nIf the second argument is not given, the function could work like it does\nnow - assign an incrementing number as the name.\nCurrently, I'm using this way to provide easier access to the child:\nvar myParent = game.add.sprite(0, 0, 'image'),\n    myChild = game.add.sprite(0, 0, 'image2');\nmyParent.addChild(myChild);\nmyParent.ref_myChild = myChild;\nmyParent.ref_myChild.alpha = 0.5;\nAnd I find this pretty annoying, especially when I have lots of child\nSprites.\nImplementing this would require the children property of Phaser.Sprite to\nbe an Object, instead of an Array, I think.

    "Ziriax": "Please don't do this, it can break a lot of existing code (mine ;-) ! \nFurthermore, as can be read at \nMDN, using round instead of floor generates a non-uniform random distribution!\nWhy not just changing the documentation that it returns a number between min inclusive and max exclusive, so [min, max) mathematically? Just like frac should return a number between 0 inclusive and 1 exclusive. Java and C# also have an exclusive upper bound, both for integers as floats. It would be confusing to change this behavior in Phaser IMHO.\n. Could you explain why the exclusive one is a real pain for use with Group.total? I have not used this property yet, but according to the docs, it returns the number of existing children, so a count, and that is also exclusive.\nMy main concern is that when using Math.round incorrectly, you do not get a even distribution. This is easy to see if you consider the pseudocode to get a random number between 0 and 2 inclusive\nMath.round(randomBetweenZeroAndOneExclusive() * 2)\nIf we plot this:\n0        0.5      1\n*---------*--------*\n00000111111111122222\nSo the probability of getting the min or max is halved.\n. Yes you are right.\nBut can you keep frac between 0 inclusive and 1 exclusive?\n. That is very democratic :+1: \nNote that the Javascript function random() returns a number between [0..1), so 1 exclusive. So IMHO frac() should mimic that behavior?\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random\nI also guess that RandomDataGenerator.integer() generates an integer between 0 and 0xFFFFFFFF inclusive, so 2^32 exclusive? Since 2^32 does not fit into a 32-bit integer? \n. Yes, range indicates inclusive behavior...\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(computer_science)\nBut frac is exclusive 1 (in shaders and math), it would be very strange to make that inclusive 1\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb509603(v=vs.85).aspx\nintegerInRightOpenInterval would be a correct name for the exclusive behavior :)\nPersonally I would just modified the documentation to clearly state what is inclusive and exclusive, also for the real etc functions\n. Great!\nOne more question: why are these methods in Math and not the RandomDataGenerator?\n. Hi Clark,\nNo \npick<T>(ary: T[]): T;\nmeans that when you pass an array of type T to the pick function, it will return an object of type T.\nSo if you pick one out of 5 bananas, you will get a banana\nIf you pick one out of 10 numbers, you will get a number\nEtc...\nNote that I corrected a typo in my initial message\nCheers,\nPeter\n. Clark: Having this typescript file is of great value to me! Thanks a lot!!!! :-)\n. Hi!\nThe <T> is required. \nTypescript supports generics since v0.9.\nClick here for the initial MSDN blog about generics\ninterface Array<T> {\n   // ...\n   map<U>(callbackfn: (value: T, index: number, array: T[]) => U): U[];\n   // ...\n}\nIt can really enhance the typechecking and intellisense, but you have to be careful, making very complex generics can in my experience slow down the compiler (I got bitten by generic promises, although in 1.0RC they improved this if I recall correctly)\nBest regards,\nPeter Verswyvelen\nhttp://www.strongly-typed.net\n.

Ok but shouldnt it be working on the website as well ?\n. Thanks, @pnstickne . Unfortunately it happens on the game.load[method] callback. So i have no chance to check anything before the texture is actually loaded. I would need to write a custom loader and then pass the texture to phaser. Seems a bit clumsy or do you have another solution?\n. Ok cool thanks.\nSo i guess i will write a load.validateSpritesheet, and then have load.spritesheet dispatch to that for the validity check.\n. Thanks, for the hint.\nOk i've tried but it gets uglier by the minute.\nFirst of all, the setFrame check is per frame, so i have to reimplement walking through every frame in the spritesheet and checking it against the image's width supplied by the game.cache. It gets trickier when the spritesheet is non-horizontal.\nThe other problem is that the engine doesn't really care about adding the Cache.addSpriteSheet after load, it will just use the image that got loaded with the same key.\nAny ideas?\n. I also checked game.load.onFileError, unfortunately it doesn't fire otherwise i could catch the error and notify the user that his spritesheet is wrong. It would be really convenient if PIXI fired an event in case the  frame cant be set.\njs\n    if (!this.trim && (frame.x + frame.width > this.baseTexture.width || frame.y + frame.height > this.baseTexture.height))\n    {\n        game.load.onFileError.dispatch() // current hack\n        throw new Error('Texture Error: frame does not fit inside the base Texture dimensions ' + this);\n    }\n. I guess an onSpritesheetError event would be a candidate. I tried writing the logic for validating the spritesheet but its actually quite complex. Sometimes the image is like 2 pixels too wide but several frames high, and im not sure if the frames wrap around that extra space or not. And wether the wrapping causes errors in itsself. Also it was difficult to add a spritesheet after the image had been loaded and notify pixi about that. It always added the whole image instead of the individual frames in game. So in the end i gave up and just added one line of event firing to the phaser code :D lazy but at least it works. Maybe i should make a request at pixi for adding another event ?\n. Hello Photon,\nThanks for the info, my understanding was that phaser has multitouch support, but does not yet recognize multi-touch gestures ?\nI was using hammer mainly so it would detect gestures and i wouldnt have to go through the process of doing this myself.\nhttp://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/8762-zoom-outin-camera-as-seen-in-angry-birds/\nMaybe i should strip out the gesture recognition from hammer js, and use it with the phaser inputs?\n. Ok, i have fixed the integration with Hammer, you can see it working here on iPad / iPhone\nhttp://www.tabloro.com/tables/Testin/play\nYou can drag 1-4 tiles simultaneously with 1-4 fingers which is handled by phaser.\nIf you use 2 fingers on the table you can pan/pinch, which is handled by hammer.js.\n.

I'd be fine with renaming it to just this.node, I guess. However, I'd probably want another check, if possible, beyond if this was pure Node.js to seeing if it is specifically Node-Webkit.\nI also did some testing with require() to see what might be a good way to verify things. Checking for \"node-webkit\" isn't going to help us here, as the (default) compiled binary version won't have that module installed. However, all compiled versions will have the module \"nw-gui\", so testing for that will result in a returned object.\nWhat do you think of something like the following, then?\n```\nvar isNode = (typeof process !== \"undefined\" && typeof require !== \"undefined\");\nif(isNode) {\n  //Test for Node-Webkit\n  var isNodeWebkit = (typeof require('nw.gui') !== \"undefined\");\n}\n```\nObviously, I'd clean the code up, but that's my testing right now.\n. I haven't changed the commit yet, but I was writing some other code today and remembered that, oh right, trying to require() a module that doesn't exist in the running context will indeed throw an exception.\nJust to clarify, then, I've written up the following code to show that testing correction.\n```\nvar isNode = (typeof process !== \"undefined\" && typeof require !== \"undefined\");\nvar isNodeWebkit = false;\n//Is this Node.js?\nif(isNode) {\n   //If so, test for Node-Webkit\n   try {\n     isNodeWebkit = (typeof require('nw.gui') !== \"undefined\");\n   } catch(e) {\n    isNodeWebkit = false;\n   }\n}\n```\n. @photonstorm Sure do.

So I don't need to move or rescale everything which is already on the screen.\nFor example:\nI have a game which has a maximum size of 480 x 320.\nI play it on a screen of 1136 x 640. The game gets scaled by a factor of 2 and the x co-ordinate system now runs from -44 to 524. Any sprites in the main playing area are automatically moved and scaled by Phaser - the only bit that changes are the \"edge\" areas which I need to update myself.\nAs I said, that's the plan. I'm guessing that for it to work I'll need to see if I can move the game origin and still have everything work. Any comments or suggestions welcome.\n. Yep, that sounds good to me. \nUsers can then scale and align the whole game accordingly using Mathieu's technique of creating a \"world\" group which contains everything and you can scale and translate it as you like.\nhttp://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/1380-how-to-scale-entire-game-up/\n.

The Tilemap implementation isn't perfect - indeed there are plans to improve it as mentioned above - but in order to remain as easy to use and flexible as possible this is the implementation that's provided. If you need better performance, you'll need to sacrifice flexibility, and for a general game framework this isn't really an option.\n. @jloa The problem is that Phaser isn't just a Tilemap engine, it's based on pixi which as a general scene graph rendering engine is faster than anything else out there that I know of.

If you need better performance, you'll need to sacrifice flexibility, and for a general game framework this isn't really an option.\n. For what it's worth, Phaser is extremely well written and laid out. I managed to add isometric projection and port Arcade Physics and all of its associated dependencies to 3D in about a week of casual work, so I reckon if you feel you have a good idea for how to improve or rewrite the Tilemap implementation you should just go for it. It's having specialists in all of these varied fields contributing to a project which makes it better for all :)\n. It's not hard to piece together just by looking at the code, but I'm sure if you're serious about this you can contact Rich (rich@photonstorm.com) and get the information you need, fork the repo and start to work on it. If you build it, they will come.\n. I may need to get my eyes checked, can't seem to see where it's defined, though you're right, it does get defined... Anyway, looks like that's got it :)\n. Aha :)\n. I think this is a sub-pixel/interpolation issue. The edges are not falling exactly on screen pixels due to position and/or scale, so the renderer (in WebGL's case) interpolates between the edge of the solid tile and the transparent background of the sprite sheet, and so the background leaks through.\nI believe the way to fix this is to have the edges extruded one or more pixels out (in TexturePacker this is the 'Extrude' setting under Layout) so that the solid edge of your tile is blended with the next pixel along, which also happens to be the same color, so you never end up with a semi-transparent edge due to interpolation.\nIf doing this manually, you'll need to paint around the edges of each tiled sprite you want to be seamless, copying the closest pixel to it.\n. You can use anonymous functions which do the work for you in the correct context, so you could do this:\nchara.tweens[i].onStart.add(function() { started(i); }, this);\nThis will call the 'started' function with i as the parameter in the same context as your current function.\n. Learning about closures and anonymous functions is very, very handy - they're one of the most powerful aspects of JavaScript.\n. This is likely because sprite.body can be one of three different systems, each with their own set of properties and methods.\n. Graphics objects have an added 10 pixel padding by default (which is implemented in the PIXI.Graphics object it inhertis from - see https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js/blob/dev/src/pixi/primitives/Graphics.js for more info)\nIf you want to remove this set graphics.boundsPadding = 0\n. This may not be a Phaser issue, but in fact a hardware issue. Keyboards often do not accept certain combinations of keys, especially when dealing with the cursor keys. Could you try using other combinations of keys to determine if this is truly a Phaser issue? For instance, using shift + WASD - or other keys which in normal use are meant to be held together.\n. If Space + WASD works fine then this is definitely a hardware issue, called 'key jamming': http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollover_(key)#Key_jamming_and_ghosting\nAs a lefty who plays fps games, this affects me a lot - the cursor keys don't play well with the rest of the keyboard.\n. Not sure if it'll help since this issue seems like it'll be difficult to track down, but you could try using game.time.events.add instead of setTimeout? This along with using game.time.now and offsets are the preferred ways of creating delayed events within Phaser.\n. This appears to be working as expected in pixi: http://jsfiddle.net/lewster32/89PKQ/\n. Would you not already have a routine responsible for applying the damage in the first place which could do this?\n. Tweening libraries differ is in how they handle overwriting (GSAP has extensive support for this) but I'd not consider the example above as an example of something tweening libraries typically support. Given the above example, I'd create a container sprite to do the broad move to 1000, 1000, and add as a child of that sprite the lion, and tween its y property to create the bounce. I guess there are other good cases for providing a tweening function per property though, so I'd still agree here in principle.\n. Should this not be called something slightly more generic and descriptive, such as 'fromPoints'? It seems as though AABB is a pretty specific use for a function which is pretty wide in its applications.\n. I've just re-read the code and the description on the off-chance that I'd misread it, but indeed it is creating a rectangle from the points specified! I guess the problem is I'm making the (in this case accurate) assumption that the rectangle is axis-aligned as all Phaser.Rectangles are... tricky! I guess maybe AABB is actually the most accurate description is what is going on here after all.\n. The only issue I have with it being more loosely termed as 'objects' is managing the expectation that the function would take into account their bounds, when in fact it will only take into account their positions. A rectangle created via the above example would not actually create a bound around the objects as I feel most would expect.\n. I think given the paremeter is expecting an array of points (or point-like objects) the function should reference that - 'boundPoints' maybe?\n. It does, but the parameter is typed in the documentation:\n@param {Phaser.Point[]} points - The array of one or more points.\n. That sounds reasonable to me. :+1: \n. Ah yeah, good spot. I did mention that issue in the example but I didn't look into why it was happening. I guess I can check the _add list too. Will fix this and update.\n. I'd suggest mentioning this on the forums (http://www.html5gamedevs.com/forum/14-phaser/) rather than on here unless you can be certain that it's a bug in Phaser.\n. I can confirm that it's really choppy in the starfield demo in dev compared to 2.1.3 (which is near enough perfect) in Chrome 39 on a mid-to-high spec desktop machine. FPS reads 60 in both, and it's not consistent - sometimes it seems to be smooth, other times it's really jerky, so I'm thinking this is some kind of out of phase/sync issue.\n. Just to add, this is also what Point.centroid returns when passed two points.\n. ",
    "Cryszon": "Thanks! The reasoning behind this was that I actually needed the position where the pointer was released, but Pointer.position kept updating even when the pointer was released. I guess it's not an issue on touchscreens, since you can't really move the pointer without touching. I took a look at #300 and saw your comment about Pointer._history, but being undocumented it's existence is not immediately apparent just by looking at the docs.\n. I just updated Phaser all the way back from 2.0.2 and this \"broke\" my code. What exactly was the issue with nearestAngleBetween? It worked just fine for me.

And let old issues stay old/closed unless there is a need to revive them.\n. @lazd I've created a delta-edge redraw implementation (it doesn't avoid the canvas and associated graphic copies, but it is much more selective on what it draws during scrolling). It uses significantly less CPU on my non-low desktop systems, but alas, my mobile-testing facilities are limited.\nIf wishing to give it a try (and hopefully report the results!), it is pushed to https://github.com/pnstickne/phaser/tree/wip-tilelayer - it works for all the tilemap examples against 2.1.3 with the biggest improvements occurring in the maps with the smaller tiles. (You will need to build the source, the built phaser.js files are not accurate.)\nIf the problem is indeed updating the texture, which should primarily affect WebGL, then an overdraw (eg. drawing an additional 10-20%) and panning coupled with the delta-edge redraw would probably be a good combination.\nHowever, I'm curious to how a relatively simple sprite-per-cell per @englercj's implementation plays out, particularly because in WebGL it can push all rendering up (and even in Canvas it can avoid an intermediate drawing stage).\n. @j0hnskot Probably something wrong - try with 2.1.3, is the problem reproducible still?\nSprite/Image#animations is never set to anything but an (AnimationManager) object these days and a Button does indeed \"extend\" an Image.\n. This case should never be generated with \"valid\" Tiled output but is possible to trivially cause when adding a tile with a tile index not imported by Tiled - for a Tiled JSON file (but not a CSV file) this also includes Tiles with an index of 0.\nI think it's a valid case to consider as a diagnostic aide (my solution is to render a filled rect, which is what I /think/ TilemapLayer#tileColor was originally for in these cases), especially for manually created/modified layers.\n. It is indeed a trivial bug in the code. It should have been written as \njavascript\nsetTimeout(function () {\n    _this._ajax.send();\n}, 0);\nNote the use of _this. Whether or not this fixes any issue is a different question, but simple enough to get a PR in for.\n. @woutercommandeur  Might not \"#listener with Gets or sets the listener for positional WebAudio, an object with x, y or false\" be too polymorphic in the allowed value? Similarly, \"this._following !== false\", etc, seems like it could be widened to \"Object or null\" (or really \"Object or a false-y value\") instead of \"Object or false\".\nMaybe Object or null (possible coalescing with undefined) be more appropriate in these different cases? (That is, I agree with the previous comments wrt. explicit false values/checks.)\n. This should also fix: https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/issues/1240\n. These changes should alleviate some scrolling performance boos. The only breaking API changes are against some of the debug* properties; but being debug properties..\n. May alleviate https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/issues/1194 - if this does shown an improvement (esp. in Canvas) then the next step is to add in overdraw and bounding support for texture moving for additional performance improvements in WebGL.\n. I'm not really fond of the doclet names used (well, really I'm just not fond of @property in general, for other reasons as well), but jsdoc is .. jsdoc.\n\"Dumping\" as in getting rid of? I don't know what I'd recommend in it's place - it's not perfect but is quite a comprehensive (and flexible) documentation type-annotator / generator. I suppose YUIDoc has the advantage of flowing through to the upstream PIXI, but otherwise I favor jsdoc and I really enjoy it's \"code introspection\" ability.\nIt is also possible to craft a mostly-automated regular expression replace for this particular case; there are a few outliers I have seen though -- I'd do so, if you're willing to deal with the resulting not-small PR in a timely manner.\n. I didn't realize a pending change - what tool will be used?\nI really like the code-inspection ability of JSDoc which infers several attributes - eg. @name, @method|@member, value of @default, etc - in most cases defined in the constructor or on the prototype (defineProperty support is still lacking); the semantic parsing and inference of these attributes is one the best and most compelling features of using JSDoc, IMOHO.\nThis allows one to write documentation without worrying about extra doclets and synchronizing redundant information that can be inferred:\n``` javascript\n/\n True if this Duck is hungry.\n @member {boolean}\n @default\n/\nthis.hungry = true;\n/\n Kill the object.\n @param {boolean} randomMutation - If true, allow random mutations.\n*/\nDuck.prototype.breed = function () { .. }\n```\nWhich is equivalent to:\n``` javascript\n/\n True if this Duck is hungry.\n @member\n @name #hungry\n @type {boolean}\n @public\n @default true\n*/\nthis.hungry = true;\n/\n Kill the object.\n @method\n @name #breed\n @public\n @param {boolean} randomMutation - If true, allow random mutations.\n/\nDuck.prototype.breed = function () { .. }\n```\nI cheated a bit and kept @type|@name separate to inflate the line count. A good baseline might be to establish @method is specified (although @member {type} is just as easy as @type {type}), while still allowing the name to be omitted / inferred.\nIn addition to not having to include \"redundant\" information\", I've found several cases where this inference has prevented incorrect documentation and has also enabled the identification of naming issues in the generated documentation.\nThe content of JSDoc can be dumped with -X (or a \"JSON template\") and used as a feed and/or complement to another system while utilizing JSDoc's existing code-inspection and type-inference.\nI do hope that whatever system is used that it supports a minimal/reduced number of tags and allows \"redundant\" information to be excluded from the documentation blocks/doclets. Also, for the sake of writing documentation it would be nice to know what constructs/idioms are allowed with any upcoming changes - this is fairly dependent upon the particular documentation engine.\n. Then is there guidance on the supported doclets and required attributes / structure?\nI've no problem writing documentation one way or another, preferences aside .. if I know the correct and forward-compatible way to write it. This includes defining rules for type/value-inference and default values, if any should be present. I know how jsdoc works (well, I'd like to think so!), but if jsdoc is supplanted in the future (or the semantics of doclets changed) then the documentation should be written with such in mind.\nThe previous comment was to illustrate the expected jsdoc behavior, and my preference of omitting the names / default value - which might not hold or be permissible under a different jsdoc-like generator.\n. There is some inconsistency with the current documentation; I do not know how to test the generation with this new system or where I can find the documentation for such.\nHere are some questions:\n- When using @method|@property, does the name of the member need to explicit specified?\n- When using @method|@property, does the name of the type the method (or property) is defined on need to be specified? Does this change from constructor/prototype literal/prototype prop assignment/define property?\n- Is there ever a need to specify it as @method Foo.prototype.x?\n- If there a difference between @method Foo.x/@method Foo#x or @method x/@method #x?\n- When/if it does matter, should the containing type be specified as @method Foo#bar or @method #bar; @memberof Foo?\n- Does the new system support @member at all or does it rigorously use @property-as-member?\n- How should the following be read (semantically, expected outcome) when there is a comment description and a property description? Would it be fitting to prefer \"Comment body\" and move/merge the \"Property body\" in all cases?\njavascript\n/**\n* Comment body\n* @property {T} n - Property body\n*/\n\nI ask these because I know how JSDoc3 works, and can test it otherwise - but making changes for JSDoc3 may break under a different documentation parsers/engines that don't operate [exactly] like JSDoc. It is important to provide the relevant documentation/guidelines for this \"new\" system, if such will ever actually replace JSDoc.\n. If you can't beat 'em .. write a JSDoc plugin :wrench: \n. It appears correctly aligned / scaled here, in both normal and full-screen, in the provided link where the scaling for both modes is the same - did I miss something? Or is this issue only reproducible when changing the scaling mode(s) to be something different from each other? Or an artifact of the particular environment?\nTested in Chrome 38 and Firefox 33 (Windows).\n. @tjkopena  I've only been able to test on Chrome.\nThere were a bunch of little subtle issues to work out - it's not an easy area.\nYour feedback is appreciated!\n. This might be fixed under https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/pull/1278 - which fixes a bunch of mismatched scaling/alignment/refresh issues in Chrome.\nHowever I cannot get Firefox (33, Windows) to jump to full-screen, even under the master branch. (What magical incantation am I missing?)\n. Also, with the PR code there is also no need to call refresh if the scale mode or alignment has been changed.\n. Ahh, this is not fixed in FF with the PR - the RESIZE mode and correctly restoring the state in normal mode are fixed, however.\n. There was a little regression with the code; some of it had been updated to PIXI's new format, but not all of it.\n. This proposal is approximately what came up with when I was playing around with the concept of State/Game separation. The ability to be able to \"push\" a state (and then \"pop\") back over to the parent state is very good idea; a generalization wouldn't hurt. This would really help in trivial tasks such as popup/modal windows. States should have a way of submitting a value back to their parent when they are closed/popped, and parents should be able to supply values to children states.\nMy partial implementation created custom per-State managers, which seemed fairly viable. The biggest issue was that the existing code uses \"game\" to resolve any managers/support they themselves needed (and these in turn bound to..), so \"game\" became not-the-real-game. I liked the separation, but not [still] referring to it as \"game\"; rather it is a context (and there may be many contexts within a single game)\nIt would be worthwhile to try and detwine the state and managers when possible. Having the managers also added directly to the state made it more complicated than it needed to be. (Those properties can also be eliminated as they are available through the game/context.) - That is, a State has a state-context and a context includes per-state managers.\nUnifying both parent/normal states and child states should be possible without fragmentation as there are relatively few differences, mainly lifecycle events. The addition of an increased of \"on suspend/on resume\" as per Android appeared to work well and it provided the pushed/popped states with more flexibility in deciding what to do.\n. I don't believe keeping keeping these concepts together is appropriate - it was leading into obscure issues with my test implementation, which is why I ultimately abandoned it without a \"larger core change\".\nThe minimum change should be the re-threading of a (\"game-like\") context. Contexts have parents contexts (associated with states), and perhaps have access the core game; but they are not states, and are not games. (Effectively a context becomes a scoped DI service-locator, as opposed to the current 'singleton' game.)\nThe object-graph and context should be an all-other-nothing. Otherwise a manager accessed by a different method (state.x or game.x) will potentially result in a different object - ick. This change will be marginally breaking to do well, and such should be accepted.\nIf a child ever wants to access the parent context it should be explicit - e.g. context.tweens, context.parentContext.tweens, context.game.tweens. Mixing the contexts up and down will be problematic. I am not opposed to provided such shortcuts (eg. manager properties copied from the correct state-context to a state, preferably by explicit request or a flag) for user code. However, using a \"state\" as the manager risks [additional] collisions with client code and does not fit well enough the current loose-state model.\nHowever, to rely on or use or even hint at the viability of multiple context contains/paths is a can of worms (managers copied to a state are an end-point/convenience only). Break me off a piece of the context-bar.\n. Actually .. 520cbfd is wrong by itself, but this does not affect the full change version which handles and normalizes the values earlier.\nif (this._onUpFrameName || this._onUpFrameID)\nShould be\nif (this._onUpFrameName != null || this._onUpFrameID != null)\nSo that the false values '' and 0 would be detected as valid fames. The original problem in this was that that _onUpFrameID = undefined and undefined === null -> nope!\n. Well, that got messy in a hurry. Is there a good way to rebase/resubmit pulls?\n. Well, FF33 works. Fixed by a computer restart shrug.\nThis commit does fix some bugs with transition resets, but SHOW_ALL/NO_SCALE do no work in full-screen mode. This is an issue with master as well though; there appears to be no regressions.\nStill can't get IE11 fullscreen support to launch in Phaser though, but it does work in some simplified (non-Phaser) scenarios.\n. Original API is \"restored\" now (from a method level there should be no breaking changes), but marked as deprecated; new visibility-tags still apply.\n. Along with click trampolining this fixes https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/issues/1281 - Fullscreen now works IE11.\n. Specifically (in IE11, desktop), changing to Fullscreen does not work with \"MSPointerDown\" events, but it does work with \"click\" events.\n. Should be addressed with the merges.\n. OOOOKAY. So the scope of this PR changed.\nIt now is a PR for full PIXI+Phaser JSDoc integration (via a YUIDoc to JSDoc transformation), with the previous mentioned JSDoc plugin to also generate better Phaser JSDoc output.\n. Assuming that yuidocjs is added locally (it is a dev. depenednecy) then\ngrunt docs\nShould be sufficient to rebuild all the docs with PIXI integrated.\n. I cannot reproduce the error on dev when using the supplied code in modified demos.\nA minimal complete example reproducing the error would help isolating the issue.\n. Okay, I see \"Error: WebGL: texImage2D: null ImageData\" logged as a JavaScript error to the console in FF 33.1.\nIt still looks \"correct\" (compared to Chrome), and while it triggered a log error it doesn't appear to trigger any exception breakpoints.. curious. (Maybe my FF settings are wonkers?)\n. @valueerrorx I'm still looking into the flipping issue (I suspect that the transform matrix is different), but the error message reported (it is not actually an exception/error) is from the FF implementation (e.g. see http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/canvas/WebGLContextGL.cpp). This same issue might be present in Chrome, and it might simply not decide to report it. Unfortunately because it's not an exception .. sigh no stack trace to follow, but at least that's cleared.\nRef. http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/10015-phaser-213-and-state-transition-plugin/\n. @valueerrorx And for the reversal I'd be tempted to call it a \"misfeature\" if not a downright bug. Rendering itself really should not affect the WT permanently.\nThe WebGL code does this (note how it modifies the world transform object in-place):\nvar wt = displayObject.worldTransform;\nwt.identity();\nwt.translate(0, this.projection.y * 2);\nif(matrix)wt.append(matrix);\nwt.scale(1,-1);\nThis flipping behavior can be avoided if doing:\nvar wt1 = game.stage.worldTransform;\n    game.stage.worldTransform = new PIXI.Matrix(); // new WT for render call\n    texture.render(game.stage);\n    game.stage.worldTransform = wt1; // put back in our own WT\n    texture.render(game.world);\n. Also ref. https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/issues/1381\n. @vorrin The mouse in the PR has been updated to support Wheel events, which have been in FF since version 17 and IE since 9. Both the older Mouse Wheel (scroll in scrollDelta property) and DOM Scroll events (scroll in detail property) are wrapped to support the Wheel event interface if such a fallback is required.\nFeel free to use either mouse.wheelDelta or event.deltaY (but do not share/use the event past the event handler). Remember to check the deltaMode - 1 is lines (probably the most common), but it could also be 0 (pixels) or 2 (pages). Also, deltaY and wheelDelta have inverted signs.\nRef. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/wheel\n. @vorrin Uh oh, that's likely from this code, but it does appear to be a problem with the 2.2.x/dev branch - there be some changes with/to the underlying PIXI and graphics as well.\nDoes 2.1.3 or the \"vanilla\" pre-PR 2.2.x (dev) have the same issues? If so that would be worth posting another bug report for.\n. @vorrin As far the actual scroll delta .. that can definitely change.\nTo get a more precise value it may be warranted to have the user \"calibrate\" a scaling factor/transformation for the device input (or to do so unaware from the user) - assuming that it is capable of reporting a more precise scroll value and deltaMode=0 .. on my desktop, a line (eg. in deltaMode=1) is ~28-33 pixels, depending on browser and various page factors.\nRef. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20110224/what-is-the-height-of-a-line-in-a-wheel-event-deltamode-dom-delta-line for some of the \"fun\".\n. @BurnedToast  I cannot reproduce here. My initial hunch is the game FPS isn't stable, for whatever reason.\nDoes the issue persist if manually using WEBGL? Manually CANVAS?\nAre there CPU spikes during the tween?\nIs this only observed on dev or also on 2.1.3? In prior versions as well?\n. Okay, I can \"sometimes, sorta\" reproduce it. 1 in 10+ refreshes in Chrome will start out with stutters - but only as it moves to about half-way.\nIt is hard to tell from the video: does it smooth out at the end? What about if the sprite takes 10+ seconds to move?\nThe results I saw \"felt\" simply like Chrome was doing resource management in background, such as running some internal/resource collection cycle. I wonder if this may be the case with other browsers as well?\n. Well, that throws out my next suggestion of \"maybe the machines are slow\".. is this behavior restricted to linear easing?\nIt would also be handy to know if this can be reproduced in 2.0.x (or ever 1.6.x), as those used an older PIXI subsystem. (There are a few regressions with the PIXI changes currently in dev, and maybe back a few point releases.)\n. The current keyPressed implementation follows the same form (is a function, not a property and is an idempotent operation based on time) as the other Input types. Having a property perform a non-direct side-effect should be avoided when possible; if such is truly required consider a function or explicit reset sequence.\nI suspect such a function should probably be implemented as so:\njavascript\n    justDown: function (duration) {\n        if (typeof duration === \"undefined\") { duration = 50; }\n        return (this.isDown && this.timeDown >= this.game.time.time - duration);\n    },\nAlso, make sure to run grunt jshint to avoid these pesky \"X\"s on the PRs.\n. I'm still opposed to the property access performing a latch reset.. it silently breaks code that accesses the property twice, which is not expected of properties..\nIf the latch reset is going to be done it should at least be a function, or the property should be manually reassigned at the usage site, or an alternative latch-clear (perhaps in update or whatnot) should be supplied.\n. @austinh I've created a WIP async loader - https://github.com/pnstickne/phaser/tree/wip-loader - which is currently tracking dev.\nFeedback and practical results welcome! I have \"very big pipes\" so it's hard for me to tell the effectiveness of parallel loading of game assets. And without a practical gain (for somebody) there isn't much sense switching the loader.\nI don't think I've broken anything - but the change is threaded through fairly deeply: guinea pigs wanted. Do note that this may change the results of http://examples.phaser.io/site/view_full.html?d=loader&f=load+events.js&t=load%20events when loader.concurrentRequestCount > 1 because it is asynchronous in most cases. See the commit message for more details.\n. This isn't anything particular with ES6 - just as in ES5, methods in ES6 are _not bound to any particular object and the \"this context\" is determined simply by how the methods are invoked. (The ES6 form is merely alternate-but-equivalent syntax).\nThere are two (simple) ways to achieve the desired behavior. Either create a \"bound function\", that will automatically restore the \"this context\":\njavascript\nnew Game(..., {create: this.create.bind(this), ..});\nOr, in this case, pass the state object itself:\njavascript\nnew Game(..., this)\nLatter form is more suitable here because 1) there is an object created (a new FightPhaser) that contains all the different state methods and 2) there is no custom name mapping.\nYou may also be interested in how the \"this\" context works and closures.\n. Just keeping making games - I can't, so I just work on the library :grinning: \n. @jfraleigh Is there a (tiled-generated?) JSON file of the affected properties? (Hopefully annotated.)\nOr is this new-type a manually edited map file?\n. https://gist.github.com/pnstickne/93143cef2be99fc05622\n. @KurtVanHal Which Phaser version is being used? And are the same issues present in the \"dev\" branch?\n- WebGL on dev: http://examples.phaser.io/_site/view_full.html?d=tilemaps&f=sci%20fly.js&t=sci%20fly&phaser_version=dev&\n- Canvas on dev: http://examples.phaser.io/_site/view_full.html?d=tilemaps&f=csv%20map%20collide.js&t=csv%20map%20collide&phaser_version=dev&\nThere was a WebGL issue for a spot - I can't remember which version(s) - where the texture were not updated correctly and so the map didn't scroll (affected WebGL only). There has also been recent work done to improve the tilemap scrolling performance, that can be found in \"dev\" as well.\n. @KurtVanHal I'm glad to hear that the future versions solve the problems! Right now \"dev\" is scheduled for the 2.2.0 release (it's RC stages!), but I'm not sure exactly when that will be.\nObtaining a build is as simple as grunt build and waiting a few minutes after having clone'd the Phaser repo locally - and I do recommend basing new work off of dev/2.2 - there are a few [new] bugs to work out and few small compatibility changes, but this is the branch I support. I do not know of where to get a \"pre-built dev\" version.\nRight now the limitations with tilemap are .. uhm, \"soft\". The more on-screen tiles that need to be redrawn the slower it will run when scrolling - the new \"dev\" rendering greatly reduces the number of tiles that are redrawn, which is what results in the performance increase. Adding more visible tilemaps increases the number of tiles that need to be redrawn, so it's something you'll have to test! However, given a tilemap that is 32x32 when shown, I would expect the \"dev\" branch to be able to render 16+ tilemap layers when casually scrolled (and not invalidated) with the same performance as with a single layer previously.\nThere is no optimization specifically for multiple layers, and each layer is rendered separately (this is cool in that layers can be stacked and moved independently, but it doesn't optimize for some common cases) - one drawback is that for 16 visible layers, there are 16 canvases created! Only the number of visible tiles should affect rendering performance, while off-screen tiles will only affect memory usage (but not performance unless available memory becomes a factor).\nAlso, causing a tilemap to invalidate (ie. using putTile) will force it to be refreshed - don't do this often when the game is running or the rendering performance will revert to pre-\"dev\" (or worse) levels.\n. This is part of the parallel loader.\n. Moving to general docs.\n. @toolness The crossOrigin option is only applied images (which are loaded via the Image tag), and not Audio or XHR loading. If the server doesn't explicitly require CORS for images, leaving it as the default crossOrigin = false should be preferable, but this doesn't address Audio/XHR caching or loading.\nAnyway, does does using https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/pull/1351 (bypasses onload/onerror for cached Images) or https://github.com/pnstickne/phaser/tree/wip-loader (a parallel loader, also does the same bypass) result in a working loader in Safari 8? I don't have access to a Mac, so..\nEven if the branches work (for images), I suspect the said error messages will still be shown.\n. @toolness The more I'm reading, I believe this to be an S3 (and Cloudfront?) + Safari (and pre-25 Chrome) specific issue relating to caching and the returning (or not returning) of the Vary: Origin response header, and not necessarily an issue of just Safari (7/8).\n- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20253472/cors-problems-with-amazon-s3-on-the-latest-chomium-and-google-canary\n- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12498704/cached-non-cors-response-conflicts-with-new-cors-request\n- https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=63090\n- https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas/pull/374\n- https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=409090\nI believe this issue only affects anon-CORS and thus crossOrigin = 'use-credentials' may address the issue (for images).\n\nThe cache busting work-about shown should also not affect Images working (or not working), so multiple special-casing may be required..\nIf such cache-busting is indeed the only viable solution to this issue then I think such should be applied in core as a \"special\" option. If only I had access to Safari sigh.\nAlthough this really is a last-ditch effort, and hopefully at least the Image tag can be \"fast accessed\" from the cache (but is the image data dirtied in such a case, even if it is immediately available?).\n. @toolness Also, a \"softer\" work-about for XHR may be If-Not-Match: safari-no-cache, as see here https://github.com/pusherman/zip.js/commit/57bda475b0ea6afcc896be69d74cb63a0e4c25db ; I've also seen Cache-Control: no-cache recommendations. Neither work in the case of tag loading but should lead to less cache pollution for XHR.\n. @toolness I'm really not sure of a \"good\" solution. Adding the If-Not-Match will promote all XHR to CORS, even when such might not be applicable - and it just becomes complicated if checking for same-domain in order to make such a decision.\nIn any case, if using https://github.com/pnstickne/phaser/tree/wip-loader the cache-busting can be implemented as so, after the game is \"booted\" (such as at the start of preload function):\njavascript\nif (game.device.safari || game.device.mobileSafari) {\n    Phaser.Loader.prototype.transformUrl = function (url) {\n        return this.baseURL + url + '?cacheBust=' + Date.now();\n    }\n}\nPhaser.Device contains lots of device/browser - the above should catch Safari, Mobile Safari, and common UIWebView (eg. Chrome iOS) browsers (basically, all browsers that likely behave with such wonkiness) - ref. https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/user-agent\nI'll put a PR in for this branch shortly, although I'm not sure if it'll be accepted or make the upcoming 2.2 target.\n. @photonstorm \nBump. Updated for clean merge with dev and a few fixes.\nAlso enabled parallel by default - which could be changed back although except for a few potential \"ordering\" expectations parallel / unordered resource fetching is likely better all around. (scripts and asset packs are still ordered implicitly as the expected ordering of these is likely to be more common/relevant.)\n. The issue appears to be very sensitive to the \"browser CPU load\" - or in the case of IE, \"lesser base performance\".\nIf I run a memory profile with Chrome dev tools (which loads the CPU) then the sprites appears to be very short-lived (say, 1-2 seconds max in the \"Random Sprite\" demo) while they'll take their time and flip off the screen without the profile running.\nWhen running dev-built (committed in the repo) the animations are still slower as expected while profiling, but the sprites flip off the screen as normal. It really \"feels\" like some form of timing issue - and it's only on a local build (when checking out upstream/dev head eg. 0ff7fbb) that the issue shows up.\n. @photonstorm Unfortunately that does not fix the problem.\nThis appears to be a larger / different issue. Currently I've tracked it down to the newer core/Game timing changes and the multiple-pumps of updateLogic - but the time variables are only updated once per cycle (over possible multiple updateLogic calls), which means that the elapsed and elapsedMS, etc. values are incorrect when taken over all the updates that occur.\nI'm still trying to track it down past that, but this definitely needs to be an escalated issue before a 2.2 release - the issue can be reproduced whenever causing the game to run below a nominal one updateLogic/RAF/timer dispatch. It doesn't seem to affect tweens (which take in the updated timeStep) but every system (including physics ?), relying entirely on time.elapsed/elpasedMS will be incorrect.\n. @photonstorm Thanks, I wasn't up-to-speed on the new fixed-step system.\nI've submitted a PR ( https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/pull/1363 ) which also exposes the update logic counter (with a different name) but uses physicsElapsed for the Sprite logic.\n. Whoops, the code-referenced issue was 47 (https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/issues/47) and not 24, but it still doesn't seem related.\n. It seemed most consistent to use physicsElapsed, and I felt most comfortable it would match other timings, because it is part of the sprite calculation phase.\nI was concerned with the elapsed/elapsedMS usage because it appears that elapsed can overcount (relative to elapsedPhysics * totalUpdateCount) when the game is paused and the elapsedMS drifts from elapsed and can undercount relative to elapsed when a game is resumed - neither seem to be strict equivalents of a physicsElapsed-in-MS, especially in heavy load and fps << target_fps where the original symptoms I noticed were occurring.\n. eg. hides properties interactive, defaultCursor, and methods like tap, mousedown, etc..\n. Ah, enabling the Chrome fps meter shows me:\nWEBGL, 60fps target -> 20/30fps render (what?)\nWEBGL, 30fps target -> 60fps render (erg?)\nCANVAS, 60fps target -> 60fps render, and pretty darn smooth (go canvas!)\nIn 2.1.3, WEBGL ~ 55fps render.\nThe CANVAS mode \"use more CPU\", but apparently in ways that affect Chrome or the rendering less .. need to investigate / find the difference (and what change it was) though.\n. That demo runs at 60fps beautifully here - not even a flinch.\n. Do you happen to know if there was a previous Phaser version in which the code works correctly? And in particular, which Phaser release \"broke\" it?\n. Whelp, this problem was introduced between 2.1.2 and 2.1.3.\nIt appears to affect PIXI.TilingSprite in CANVAS, but not PIXI.Sprite. WEBGL is not affected. It is also the parent TilingSprite that appears to be incorrectly transformed.\nThere is probably a - missing from one of the matrix transformations, or an accidental side-effect between transforms..\nAt least that narrows things down a bit sigh\n. This is a PIXI bug, confirmed locally.\nLine ~221 of TilingSprite (PIXI) the transform is\ncontext.setTransform(transform.a * resolution,\n                     transform.c * resolution,\n                     transform.b * resolution,\n                     transform.d * resolution,\n                     transform.tx * resolution,\n                     transform.ty * resolution);\nwhen it should (if PIXI.Sprite is correct) be\ncontext.setTransform(transform.a * resolution,\n                     transform.b * resolution,  // b here\n                     transform.c * resolution,  // c here\n                     transform.d * resolution,\n                     transform.tx * resolution,\n                     transform.ty * resolution);\nThe entire TilingSprite canvas render should probably be done like in PIXI.Sprite (or vice versa), but not my  :wine_glass: \n. Whoops, forgot to get new examples..\n. ...\n. This relies on short/friendly link support (https://github.com/pnstickne/phaser/commit/2f6c109901acdade5704ac5eb0bc0ed7c6064f29) for generation of intratype links; otherwise they are just rendered as text.\n. The S4 (95xx) is a good bit faster than the S II (91xx) - this should not be the case at all! (The only exception I can think of is if there is a texture/size-related issue, because the S4 has a much higher resolution screen.)\nWhich version of Phaser is being used? Does the problem exist if using the \"dev\" branch? (The \"dev\" branch code will soon be the current release version.)\nHow is the FPS being measured? Can you share the game / background creation code?\nIs the game using CANVAS or WEBGL?\nIs it also slow on the S4 when directly running from the (Android 4) browser? Does it run better when using Chrome for Android?\nNot many answers, but hopefully the right question(s) can crack the issue.\n. Uhm, uhh. The current Phaser code is\nfor (var v = 0, len = json.layers[i].objects.length; v < len; v++)\nI also cannot find any reference to activatableObjects in the Phaser source (maybe my git-fu is weak). What Phaser library (url) / version is being used?\n. @Steve-3d Definitely push for these corrections in PIXI, they come downstream to Phaser fairly regularly!\n. Remember, you too have the power :battery: of generating PR's / fixes!\nJust make sure to base off of the actual source (and especially not the generated output) in the \"dev\" branch - the matrix transpose code has moved to src/utils/ArrayUtils\n. Phaser.Point.angleSq is a \"static\" method which is why it takes two parameters (both the points). Now, as far as why Phaser.Point.prototypeangleSq returns NaN .. it is because Point.proto.subtract doesn't work with another point, but is being called as so internally (which is a bug in angleSq).\nAlso, code should double-check the usage of Point.angle (and it should most definitely not use the current angleSq as such function will currently not work due to aforementioned bug). The current Point.angle function returns the angle of the difference vector (or line between) two points, not the angle between two vectors (expressed as points) which may be the intent..\n. @photonstorm Eep :sweat_drops:, just saw this - my domain/issue. (Make sure to throw an @ my way.)\nIs there a specific browser this affects, or degenerate example available?\nWhile it is possible for the setResizeCallback to be called even though there is not a real bounds change (it differs from the onSizeChange signal in the aspect and can be used to cause/prevent such an onSizeChange), I was not able to produce a degenerate cycle on desktops.\n. Okay, I take that back. I can produce an oscillation (but not unbound growth) under some specific situations involving scaling and both scroll bars. The oscillations themselves appear clamped to a relatively large period due to the internal update guard back-offs.\nIt is indeed annoying.\n. Indeed.\nI think it's 95% a regression from changing the view-bounds from incorporating the scroll bars to excluding them, which was done fairly late.\nHaving the scroll bars part of the bounds avoids the size changes, but then doesn't correctly (?) center/align/limit when the scroll bars are present. However, given the two, it might make more sense to go back to the previous method of counting the scroll bars in the viewport size.\n. Well, that PR puts it back to what should be the same as 2.1 - so with the cut-off issue in some cases, but without the \"scroll-bar jitters\".\n. Right now only spaces can divide words that are wrapped.\nIt ought to be fairly simple - write it and create a Pull Request! :cat: \nThe only method that needs to be modified is Phaser.Text.prototype.runWordWrap.\nMake sure that it is controllable via a flag (e.g. a parameter to the function).\nOnce a too-long word has been found then remove characters until a suitable break-word location is found. When applying a break-word, remember that the - added should be accounted for; and make sure to handle sanity/degenerate cases such as only forcing a break-word when it is needed (or exceeds a certain threshold) or handling the case when the width being too small for any characters.\n(Alternatively, the current approach can be altered to use strict character scanning instead of line/word processing.)\n. @jounii Does the issue still affect Phaser 2.2.x (the new mainline)?\n. @IDragonfire  Does it work in the default Android (non-Chrome) browser or do neither work? I've not used Chrome, but neither the 2.1.3 nor 2.2x work on the Standard Android 4 browser.\nI suspect this issue is caused by a failure to enter full-screen mode (for whatever reason). What does the console log say after trying to enter full-screen mode? If it fails it should say:\n\"Phaser.ScaleManager: requestFullscreen failed or device does not support the Fullscreen API\"\nIf not, are there any other messages?\nAlso, try to start it with game.scale.startFullScreen(false, false) - does that work any better? (If it does then I messed up on a browser compatibility guard.)\nAnd, as one last thing to try if the above doesn't work. Set: game.scale.compatibility.supportsFullScreen = true. Does it still not work? Does it generate the same error message if it doesn't work?\n. @IDragonfire  \"Trampolining\" (or \"jumping to somewhere else\") here means that the ScaleManager defers triggering the Full Screen API action until a following 'click' occurs, instead of the current 'pointer down/up' event.\nThis is needed in IE, which only allows the Full Screen API to be called from 'click' events , but seems to be fuddling up Chrome on Android.\nThanks for reporting this issue and the corrective action - it makes it easier to find/fix.\n. Remember, you can create a PR too!\n. It does seem odd - maybe some historical compatibility issue. But I've go nothing.\n. Submit a PR (against dev!).. \n.. but where is the marker in the method signature used? What about if it looked more like the following?\njavascript\n    if (typeof marker === 'undefined') { marker = this.currentMarker; }\n. @vorrin Pretty much.\nI recommend:\n-- make sure have the latest\ngit fetch upstream dev\n-- go to dev\ngit branch upstream/dev\n-- create a new branch, from here with\ngit branch -b work_in_progress\n-- do work, git add (!) / git commit (--amend) as desired\ngrunt build\n-- (I usually remove the \"uglify\" task from the build task near the bottom of Gruntfile.js)\n-- test, do more work, repeat do-work .. test\n-- rebase if branch history has alot of unecessary commits\n-- (if I have a PR with multiple commits it is usually changes after a PR has been created)\ngit push origin work_in_progress\n-- then submit PR\n. What would a \"responsive demo example\" show?\n. If that is the case, there are two basic ways to accomplish the task, depending on what is desired:\n1. Set the CSS width/height of the game canvas' parent element to '100%' (or whatever is appropriate to achieve the correct/\"responsive\" output size) - see the intro to http://docs.phaser.io/Phaser.ScaleManager.html (I recommend this method)\n2. or set parentIsWindow on the ScaleManager, and make sure the canvas a direct child of the document/body node (and probably the first element). The documentation says this is read-only which isn't strictly true and it can be set immediately after the game is created - see http://docs.phaser.io/Phaser.ScaleManager.html#parentIsWindow\nMake sure to set the ScaleManager mode to scale accordingly (EXACT_FIT, SHOW_ALL, RESIZE, or USER_SCALE) - see http://docs.phaser.io/Phaser.ScaleManager.html#scaleMode Using USER_SCALE is the most flexible but may require manual calculations in the resize callback. RESIZE scales the logical game, not the display.\n. See http://codepen.io/anon/pen/ByjzEm\n- Click on the left button to change the scale mode (and resize the window to see the responsive scaling changes)\n- Click on the image to enter full screen mode (scaling works in full screen too!)\n- Click on the right button to change the image color palette.\n. @nvcken I'm not sure what is meant :( Some images would be helpful.\nIf using SHOW_ALL (or USER_SCALE) then the images can be scaled proportionally and maintain their shape. SHOW_ALL is probably the better default choice for this task.\nIf the device itself already rotates the HTML page then portrait + landscape rotation should already be supported. If custom adjustment (eg. to the CSS of the parent container) needs to be done it can be handled in the onOrientationChange event.\n. @nvcken\nSet the CSS max-height property of the parent element of the game canvas - or otherwise establish a bounding height of the parent.\nThis parent height/width will limit the maximum size the game canvas will scale to with SHOW_ALL.\nAlso see setMinMax for another way to apply bounds in some cases - I recommend following the CSS max-height approach specified above.\nIt is hard to provide more specific suggestions when a small (minimal) example of the layout is not shown. Create an appropriate jsbin/codepad entry.\n\nWhen using USER_SCALE the user scale factor - see setUserScale -  needs to be updated appropriately to fit within the bounds. The code has access to the bounds (as established with the CSS) inside the setResizeCallback callback: see the demo.\n. The ScaleManager applies to the rendered size of the game - this is different than the relative logical size of the game world or objects! Thus changing the ScaleManager affects how everything added to the game is rendered.\nUse world (or the world camera) and/or individual sprite scaling to change the appropriate view/scene-graph scaling. Groups can be used to further control/refine how world transformations are applied to different objects / scene-graph trees.\nSee http://archive.gamedev.net/archive/reference/programming/features/scenegraph/index.html for a brief overview on 2D scene graphs. In Phaser, World/world is effectively the \"Star\".\n. http://examples.phaser.io/_site/view_full.html?d=tweens&f=chained+tweens.js&t=chained%20tweens is all commented out :confounded: \n. @vorrin The original way should still have been valid, AFAIK.\nUsing manual \"combined tweens\" should still work in the interim, but does require a rewrite of the affected code.\n. Ref #1413\n. Passing the fork.\n. As with Phaser 2.2 source, delay (and many of the other Tween-container methods) are only applicable after at least one Tween has been added (to the \"timeline\").\nHowever this is not specified in the documentation, and in the case of something like delay might even be considered an API design shortcoming (in particular, where it does work the default is to add the delay before any tween, as documented, instead of before the next tween) ..\n. Verified on Emulated Android 4.4/Chrome (regression issue here) and FF/IE/Chrome (same as before).\n. @kanecko Make sure the parent is not \"collapsing\" in on the Game canvas; the horizontal and vertical alignment are based off of the parent bounds so, if the parent assumes the height of the child (game canvas) then the game will always be \"vertically aligned to 0\". (That being said, the vertical alignment should have resulted in similar behavior from 2.1 to 2.2, as both are based on the same principal :imp:)\nOne way to prevent \"collapsing\" is to set the min-height CSS property on the parent.\nHere is a working example - http://codepen.io/anon/pen/NPxvYe (scroll the window narrow enough and the game will be align vertically within the parent, which cannot get less than 600px in height).\nI would generally avoid a vertical align with NO_SCALE, but it does align when the parent is larger than the game display canvas (edit the min-height in the example to 900px).\nAlternatively, with parentIsWindow the sizing information is taken from the window/displayed area - approximately, eg. differs on desktop and mobile - instead of the DOM parent element.\nAlso, the call to refresh() does not do anything as setting the alignment automatically queues a refresh.\n. @kanecko Ahh - thanks for reporting this. There is indeed a change with the default settings - it looks like I incorrectly applied/omitted a default value!\nSee forceMinimumDocumentHeight in the ScaleManager compatibility options to retain the 2.1 behavior:\ngame.scale.compatibility.forceMinimumDocumentHeight = true;\nHowever, I don't recommend this if it can be avoided due to having different behavior on mobile browsers and desktops.\n. @kanecko  I don't immediately see anything the in the Group#callAll code that looks as if it could cause this behavior.\nMake sure that player[0].units and player[1].units do indeed map to different Phaser Group objects: if they refer to the same Group the problem with callAll is a red herring. (And if there is an issue introduced by Phaser 2.2, it may be from elsewhere.)\nIf the problem persists, a minimal test-case would really help tracking down the problem.\n. @kanecko Sub-prototyping Phaser.Sprite should not be an issue by itself..\nI'm not entirely sure what is meant by \"this.sprite always holds the reference to the unit in player[1] group\", but I'll look at a runnable-yet-minimal test case on jsbin/jsfiddle/etc. if the problem is still not able to be resolved.\nAs far as debugging I would step through the code with the Chome Debugger and inspect the relevant properties after each operation - you can dig into the SignalBinding objects (added via Signal.add) to see the objects that are really bound in the callbacks.\n. Note:\nYou're using mah server - I suppose I accidentally left the ngrok address float.\n(It follows dev, not strictly a release.)\nThat being said, it probably works the same was as 2.2.x.\n. @Jack0815 This may be related to the new fixed-step system. Which, should handle this case better and more predictably than before..\nI suspect the core issue is that the ball moves /PAST/ the bricks (or at least more than half-way through) each time the physics is applied - the Arcade physics only checks the current positions, and not the paths.\nMake sure that game.time.desiredFps is at high enough such that the ball cannot move more than halfway through a brick in \"1 frame\" (~16ms @ 60FPS).\nI could not readily reproduce the ball-jump/tile-skip issue on my main desktop (which is \"beefy\"); I'll look at it more in depth later.\n\nThe paddle flicker sounds like another issue - please create a separate issue for it with more detail, thanks! (I've also experienced \"paddle flicker\" in Chrome, but it feels more like an input-related issue and unstable positioning.)\n. Whelp, I can confirm this. When the actual fps is << target fps the breakout game goes \"berserk\".\n(Chrome at 10FPS will \"Game Over\" immediately after the first click as the ball flies off the screen.)\nI'm not sure exactly what the problem is; it could simply be an \"excessive delta difference\" in the ball velocity update functions.\n. Shouldn't the fix-step prevent tunneling with fixed-physics calculations and a fixed (eg. dropped catch-up) cap?\nThe behavior I saw seemed \"inexplicably\" severe and can be reproduced when running a Chrome Heap Allocations profiler when trying to play breakout.\n. @photonstorm But with the fixed-step, wouldn't this require the object to be going fast enough to be missed at both the 0 and 1/TargetFPS logic checks?\nThe previous model would have checked at 0 and ElapsedMS, where ElapsedMS >= 1/TargetFPS (assuming TargetFPS ~ 60), and at a lower actual-FPS, ElapsedMS >>> 1/TargetFPS which should have made tunneling previously much more severe under lower actual-FPS.\nWith the fixed step model I would expect logic checks to always occur at 0 and 1/TargetFPS - and thus exhibit better stability and reduces tunneling characteristics.\nAssuming the desired FPS is left at 60 this would always be stable ~16ms logic updates; yet the observed behavior is not consistent with the above expectations. (I could very well be missing a simple detail.)\n. I would also expect with the new fixed-step model updating the target FPS to 120 should halve the tunnel-afflicted zone; as the physics calculations are done (possibly multiple times each RAF update) based on 1/TargetFPS.\nThis won't affect the \"actual render FPS\" past 60FPS and may result in game/physics-time slowdowns (due to update-skips if more than 3 are dropped per RAF and/or if spiraling kicks in), but the fixed step system should handle this case better (and more consistently) than 2.1, not worse as reported.\n. @pjbaron I can recreate \"non playable behavior\" - much worse than that described, even - by simply running a Chrome Heap Allocation profile. Works like a charm to load the system, even on a fairly beefy desktop.\nAlso while spiraling can delay physics calculations, it should not affect the consistency of physics calculations that are done - this includes Arcade Physics, Tweens, and Sprite lifetimes. (It does not include general Timers or other code which is based off of the general elapsed \"real world\"-time.)\nAt the \"worst\" it should cause a noticeable game-time (aka \"physics/bullet-time\") slow-down. Yet every calculation done is based on the 1/FPS (where it is stable in fixed-step) and should thus be predictable: they are done at 1/FPS (0 .. 3 per updateRender) before continuing to the next 1/FPS updateLogic calculation.\nThat is, in game-time (aka \"physics/bullet-time\"), a updateLogic is not skipped in relation to physics/body calculations; but it may be delayed to a subsequent game update/render.\nSince the updates are at 1 / Desired FPS then any tunneling or collision-miss effect should be less pronounced and more consistent (especially when running at sub-60 FPS rendering) than in 2.1, as described above: but the opposite behavior is being reported.\nWhile detecting spiraling is useful, as long as the time.desiredFps is constant/stable (Phaser suggests, but does not change it) then the physics should also be stable.\nThere is a bug here, somewhere. I believe the logic behind the fixed-step system is generally sound in reducing tunneling and making the physics more consistent. This problem needs a resolving exploration/fix and should not simply be brushed off.\n. @pjbaron In any case, [extreme] reproduction is simple: profile Heap Allocations in Chrome. I've found several subtle bugs that only occur in less-than-ideal situations when doing so.\n. @photonstorm With the updateTransform suggestion in place I can no longer reproduce any of the reported issues - the game is playable, the paddle no longer seems errant, and the ball does not pass through any tiles.\nThe game runs predictably, albeit not very smooth, at ~10 actual fps (60 target fps, 10 suggested fps).\n. On a desktop browser, I've not observed updateTransform as a hot-spot or bottleneck from a performance standpoint, and I've run more than a few profiles from standard to \"extreme\" loads.. of course calling it twice per render/update may be wasteful (depending on the nuances of other update interactions), but it has little/no relevant impact when only called as often as a physics update.\nWhile the method does have a good number of variables, it generates almost no objects (excluding on how browsers implement non-immediate numbers internally) and the math operations can be well optimized locally. Modern JIT browsers are highly optimized for this usage (even pre-ASM) and are able to play Quake / Unreal Tournament and even virtualize Linux (well, on non-mobile devices, anyway).\nIn my experience, local non-escaping variables (that are monomorphic) are cheap when in \"optimizable functions\": the impact from such is only when the method creates objects (assigned to said variables), especially if the new objects are not short-lived and persist outside the method call, or if the variables / function scope must be bound in a closure or otherwise de-optimized.\nI've not much experience with working on or profiling mobile devices, but I expect they have similar characteristics of not spending much (relative time) in updateTransform.\n(Any performance impact that there is from updateTransform is also marginalized by the increasing load on the rendering and physic sub-systems as expected in usage.)\n\nThat being said, none of the current mobile (ARM-based) processors have nearly the math (ALU or FPU) throughput that a modern x86 has, which may slightly skew the results. I've also little experience with Safari or the non-JIT JS engines (which is only pre-iOS7 these days?) such as JSC+LLInt. But I doubt applying updateTransform (even with a potentially unnecessary duplication) will be a bottleneck that needs addressing as such lesser performance / optimization is applied across the entire system.\n. I concur that the updateTranform must be called after every \"logic update\".\nAnyway, some observations about having the update transform done by the Physics:\n- updateTransform is relatively inexpensive (as in less than 0.1%, even with hundreds of particles). This is per desktop analysis; but I do not believe there is an overall performance impact with calling this operation as often as 1/desired_fps - and the relative performance is not significant concern.\n- This change needs to be applied for all Physic types, not just Arcade. Just something to keep in mind.\n- This would result in the current odd behavior is the user moved the sprite (not via Physics) during a \"logic update\".\n- This change results in a non-atomic view (of the transformation) during the \"logic update\". Not that there is a strong guarantee anyway.\nI'm a fan of calling updateTransform after every postUpdate (or \"logic update\"), but allowing it to be skipped in the render (\"render update\") if there was a postUpdate (\"logic update\") for that game loop cycle. This would ensure the contract of calling it after each postUpdate is met, but avoid it being called twice when only a single logic update is applied - This is a slight simplification of the modification to each Sprite update that is also universal across all game objects and is similar to the original proposed fix (that most people seem to agree \"works\" for them).\n. Well, there is my proposal. It works with the failing cases reported and the assumption / rationale is outline in the PR.\nThe current dev code does not work correctly; I think it might be a slight logic issue, but I opted to forgo such checks after establishing the assumption stated within the PR.\n. @pjbaron Yup. That sounds right and is the justification I am using of the latest / revised approach (which is a simplification) and the recent PR change does just that - every \"logic update\" run by the core game loop starts a worldTransform from the Stage, which iterates the scene graph recursively visiting all connected display objects.\nI've outline the assumption in PR.\n\nPreviously I asserted / hinted that the WT might also be done before a render, but I've since revised that with the observation that, normally, only updates can \"move\" things. This assumption/rule simplifies the logic and allows skipping a WT under spiraling catch up situations (where there are no update logic calls).\nThere should probably be an exposed function to allow the user to \"syncWorld\" if user/game code moves objects outside of the update phase - which would be in response to a direct browser event or setTimeout, etc. But this is a special case, not the norm.\nI know of a few fringe cases where this occurs in Phaser (ie. ScaleManager.onFullScreenError), but I believe that the input system - which is the main concern for such external events - moves all the relevant callbacks into the update phase. Plus, Phaser encourages the design of checking input state within the game's update logic.\nIt would be prudent to review the various internal callbacks / sources and document (and possibly modify) any such cases that do not operate under the update phase; also, documentation for the above stated rule should also be included somewhere relevant ..\n. The emitter class is really Phaser.Particles.Arcade.Emitter (this is normally never created directly, but rather through the game object factory/creator).\n. I'll leave deciding on \"where\" it belongs to someone else :angel:, but that PR should resolve the 404 ..\n. This is highly compatible with the sanctioned usage current API (but there may be a few usage breaks) and allows for the following usage patterns:\n``` javascript\n    tween.add(..)\n        .delay(100)  // affects next\n        .to(..)\n        .repeat(2)   // affects previous\n        .delay(100)  // affects next (pause)      \n        .to(..)\n        .yoyo()      // affects previous (default true as name implied)\n        .start();\ntween.add(..)\n    .repeat(1)   // no effect (warning), it doesn't make sense to repeat something not done yet\n    .to(..)\n    .delay(100)  // delay added to the start/first tween (with warning), as a special-case\n    .start();\n\n```\nThis doesn't affect cases where indices were supplied manually and should work in cases where the current code \"works\". Compatibility-breaking cases would look like the following (which don't currently make much sense - the repeat applies to the first child only).\njavascript\n    tween.add(..)\n        .to(..)\n        .to(..)\n        .repeat(2)   // affects previous and NOT first child (index == 0)\n        .start();\n. I can verify this on Chrome as well.\n. I can not longer reproduce this after applying the local updateTransform patch as suggested in https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/issues/1424 - even if not the exact same issue the result of the transform seems to have the same overall fixing effect.\n. It is indeed missing!\nAs far as code changes, it should look pretty close to how the x and y properties are added.\nFeel inclined to commit a PR? It's a pretty easy process - once the process is learned. (It'd take me about 2 minutes, but this is a good thing to jump in on!)\nI would probably map it as an angle property in Phaser to match the rotation/angle distinction in Sprites and whatnot.\n. I'm entirely in support of some automated (but not necessarily unit) testing - and would help such an endeavor. (Unit testing is great for libraries methods, but not necessarily as good for testing how everything interacts.)\nI'd be happy if there was an automated way of testing the examples as many of the issues reported can be detected with an example failing to run, or failing to reach a trivial expected state within specific time-limits. (Maybe headless? I don't really care about detecting PIXI-level bugs.)\nI'd expect such simple exception/state-checking to be able to reach maybe (number from the air: 60%) of the regression cases.\nThe tests should be easy to add to/alongside the examples and not require creation or complex setup: or willingness to create them will be decreased.\n. Which is one reason why I'm a proponent of tests-over existing (and future) examples for \"bang for your buck\".\nThere is a lot of introspection capabilities within JavaScript (and replayability within the examples), without reaching out to screen captures - such validation falls outside the realm of unit tests.\n. Are there any errors or warnings in the console? Did/does it run successfully in the last version of 2.1?\n. The mode is specified when creating the same: new Phaser.Game(.., Phaser.CANVAS|AUTO|WEBGL, ..).\nIf the device doesn't support WEBGL then using Phaser.WEBGL will result in an error.\nThere are a few issues with IE and WEBGL that regressed from PIXI 1.6 used in Phaser 2.1 to the PIXI 2 used in Phaser 2.2; this may be related. If the issue is indeed related to WEBGL-in-IE regressions, using Phaser.CANVAS (if it is not already the case) may result in different (working) behavior.\n(Currently I don't have access to the linked web-page and cannot review how the code creates the game.)\n. @paul-reilly This was a late change I put in to special case to warn about \"image collection\" tilesets, as they are not supported; it may very well have be an incorrect check. (See https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/issues/1339 , https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/pull/1372)\nIs the Tiled JSON that produces the issue that needs to be fixed available? And which version of Tiled was it generated by?\n\nAnd, while I'm not always super good at following this rule myself, make sure that the PR branch is \"clean\" wrt. the task/issue being addressed; I'd re-branch off upstream/dev and edit-or-pick in the changes and submit another PR without the changes to AudioSprite.\n. @paul-reilly Thanks for showing the problematic JSON - the proposed fix should correct the errors relating to the \"image collection\" guard previously added.\nHowever, I am curious as to why tiles are under tileset in this case? It looks more like an Object Layer; what can I do in Tiled to reproduce this output? Thanks.\n. @paul-reilly Cool, learned something new.\n. @neurofuzzy sigh - if only it was easy for us non-Mac users to get access to Safari.\nThat line was specifically added for handling alpha tiles; if it is removed then I tiles that are partially transparent will result in \"strange overdraw artifacts\" (in at least IE/FF/Chrome, and maybe Safari). However, flickering is clearly not acceptable either..\n..now,\nIs this problem only when dragging the canvas? - or also during normal game/canvas redrawing?\nWhat about if the canvas is moved via normal camera-follow (as in Sci-Fly demo)?\nAlso, does this affect the game in WEBGL as well, or only in CANVAS?\nEarlier versions of the code used a secondary canvas buffer (and a clear), but didn't adjust the globalCompositionOperation itself.\n. @neurofuzzy Can you test the https://github.com/pnstickne/phaser/tree/wip-tilelayer-safaribug branch? I've altered the code to only specify the 'copy' operation once (when the TileLayer is created) and it eliminates the state save/load operations.\nHere is the diff to reproduce the changes locally: https://github.com/pnstickne/phaser/compare/photonstorm:dev...wip-tilelayer-safaribug\nIf this works I'll put in a PR.\n. Oops. That won't work correctly for tiles with transparencies (the background won't alpha) - however the results in Safari will help to isolate the issue further.\n. The shiftCanvas function just moves over the existing image / rendered tiles (within the same canvas) that don't need to be redrawn, in theory .. which is why it's a copy, so none of the area it is replacing will show through. The new edge tiles are then redrawn later, which is what results in a good bit of speed-up from the previous 2.1.3 version.\nBecause of this I'm confused that it appeares invisible (black?) after the change except for the redrawn edges. With the linked update the 'copy' operation should be set once and I don't think it is changed; unless perhaps there is an odd PIXI interaction so I would have expected the same results (it may also be save/load state that somehow allowed it to half-work with the flicker instead of not being shown at all). Even with a different composition mode selected, I really would not expect the result to be \"nothing\".\nIt makes me think that perhaps Safari might not be able to have overlapping source/destination regions in this case. I'll dig up the code (to-morrow, evening) using the extra canvas element for the shift/copy, but .. it's buried a bit.\nUnfortunately I don't have access to anything i-related, but it's good to know that it can be reproduced on those devices as well.\n. Sorry all - I've been busy with \"real work\", and I forgot this new mode was configurable D:\nUntil there is a proper 2.2/Safari fix is in, one can use\ntilemapLayer.renderSettings.enableScrollDelta = false. This will force the entire tile map to be rendered each time (as it was in 2.1) but doesn't use the function that has issues in Safari. It can then be used as ..enableScrollDelta = !(game.device.safari || game.device.mobileSafari) to limit the impact.\nIf 'copy' is not used there will be \"melting artifacts\" with any tiles that are not 100% opaque because the previous source will remain and show through (and get copied itself on later shifts).\n. @neurofuzzy There isn't any clipping, except which is implicit in 'copy' (although apparently a number of older browser versions get this wrong, but not in an observable way here). If you're able to figure out the core problem with the copy-over-same-canvas approach in Safari, you have my hat tipped!\nAnyway, I've updated the branch with a secondary copy canvas. The performance should be \"equivalent\" to the copy-over-same-canvas approach, although it does use more memory for the secondary canvas. If this approach does work then I'll look at optimizing the memory usage to be less and put in a Phaser fix PR.\nLinks again: https://github.com/pnstickne/phaser/tree/wip-tilelayer-safaribug , https://github.com/pnstickne/phaser/compare/photonstorm:dev...wip-tilelayer-safaribug\n. @lastnightsparty  Sigh. Both approaches show absolutely no problem in any other mainstream browser. While I could understand the copy-over/'copy' being problematic..\nIs the result identical when using the latest branch code compared to 2.2 mainline/dev? Or is it different-but-still-broken?\nDo the \"Sci Fly\" (uses WEBGL) and \"Tilemap Callback\" demos (CANVAS + Alpha) exhibit the same issue(s) when scrolling? This will help to identify if the problem varies across the differences.\nAnd the TilemapLayer renders correctly when using enableScrollDelta = false? This mode does not use any canvas copy operations and can be used to reduce/verify the problem space.\nAlso, are the images hosted on the same domain?\n. The demos here, I mean: http://examples.phaser.io/ - Sci Fly and Tile Callbacks.\n- The choice of Sci Fly is to test for WEBGL differences, although it has no alpha concerns it should be able to reflect if the tilemap renders correctly (as in, not result in the observed erasing/non-display behavior). It can also occasionally identify WEBGL rending and performance oddities.\n- The choice of Tile Callbacks is to check for basic alpha transparency (or \"melding\") issues, as the coins have an alpha channel. (Alpha is why some form of 'copy'-and-only-keep-source is required.)\nTile Callbacks is also special: as stepping on a coin causes a full redraw of the map (that does not use a copy operation). Is the rendering is \"fixed\" after this happens? Does rendering still flicker while walking on a coin?\nTo double-confirm if the problem is only related to the shift-delta, and given a TilemapLayer (eg. from layer = map.createLayer(...), then after creating it use: layer.renderSettings.enableScrollDelta = false. This should fix/bypass the problem if it is isolated to delta rendering and the intermediate copy operations; and the results of which can be compared with the incorrect behavior. (Remember to not-disable the delta scroll for other testing: or it will \"appear to work\" even when forcing a full render each frame.)\nGoing back to the original issue is interesting as well: \"if I comment [the 'copy' line] out, [it] makes everything work fine\". The latest branch linked above should have avoided 'copy' (and the required state restore) with double-copy's and (the default) 'source-over' composition.\nNote that the branch source needs to be recompiled as the pre-built JS files it contains are still from the dev builds: also make sure the tested phaser.js file is updated/current per the branch and not cached or from a previous build. I'm stumped as to why this alternate approach results in no improvement.. or rather, why it has the same behavior even though 'copy' is not used.\n. @neurofuzzy Does the latest wip branch, with the second canvas/copy, address the problems encountered?\nRemember that the source needs to be built.\n. @lastnightsparty enableScrollDelta = false will bypass the code causing issues, so it needs to be tested with the default (enableScrollDelta = true).\nThe links above (jsbin and codepen) are linking against the current \"double copy\" patch Phaser build and should not have the problem(s) reported on iOS / Safari .. if the patch corrected the problem.\nI'm about ready to hunt down some older physical devices :<\n. @lastnightsparty The dev branch does not have the suggested fix, linked above. Only my the linked branch has the changes. If wishing to test locally, the patch branch itself from my repository (not dev) needs to be pulled and built - I'm trying to get this tested before a PR.\nThe URL's listed above (codepen, jsbin) can be used to test against my local build of the change that may address the issue. (The Phaser.js resource - http://32b43209.ngrok.com/examples/site/js/phaser-268df42.js?=1419196903144 - referenced in those test cases is a custom build hosted on my machine.)\n. @lastnightsparty I've added a direct link to the Phaser.js file in the previous comment that can be copied/tested locally!\nOtherwise to get my patch, just pull from my repo patch (https://github.com/pnstickne/phaser/tree/wip-tilelayer-safaribug) instead of photonstorm/dev (or merge it on top) and then run grunt build as normal.\n. @lastnightsparty Cool! Which device(s) were you able to test on? I'd like to verify it works in both Safari (OS X and iOS).\nIt also requires a little bit of modification to reduce memory usage, but it's good to hear that it's a promising lead!\n. @lastnightsparty Thanks for the feedback!\nI've incorporated the fixes into a new build that can be downloaded here. It is a bit smarter and uses less memory even when a double-copy is required. (There is no need to mess with enableScrollDelta and it should be left unset from the default value.)\nThis should continue to work in Safari and Mobile Safari; it should be tested on Chrome for iOS (that uses UIWebView) but is not Safari, if possible. (I am uncertain about the feature checks in this case.)\nIf this works for you, please leave feed back on the PR - https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/pull/1498\n. That is bad - it is caused because the previous area is not cleared and the alpha channel allows bleed-through. It \"smells\" like something got merged bonkers [or: I did dun mess up a line]. This is what will happen if the composition operation is not 'copy', which is why simply removing such didn't fix Safari.\nI'll take a look at it when I get home tonight.\nSince it is Chrome on Windows, that should be using the \"direct\" method since 2.2 - that bonkers Safari only. Looking at theLayer.renderSettings.copyCanvas will be undefined if it is a direct bitblt. To try with the copy-canvas just set game.device.canvasBitBltShift = false before creating the layer.\n(I don't see anything immediately off in the dev branch - and the changes don't appear in master yet.)\n. Fix PR in - that made me feel brillant ..\n. Is there an online demo (a jsbin/codepen, etc) of the problem available?\nThe question is not clear to me as described.\n. This is fixed in dev. See https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/issues/1406 for a work-about.\n. Might be related to https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/issues/1288\n. (Ignore those RNG/PR links: wrong link-back.)\n. @aressler38\nYup, this is indeed a limitation with the current URL filter.\nThere are several possible solutions, including:\n- Require additional type/mime meta-data to be supplied (eg. separate from the URL) or\n- Assuming that blob: audio data is always playable (ie. the user already checked)\nBoth are relatively simple changes with no backward-compatibility conflicts. I can work on a PR this evening .. or somebody (you!) could beat me to it. For the latter option, it is just a matter of applying a starts-with accept on blob: inside the above function before where it attempts to check the URL extension.\nMake sure to update the documentation for the \"add audio\" methods as well.\n. @nextht Thanks for take the time to write some PR's.\nJust remember to try and keep a branch/PR per separate issue as it can help with srp/merging. I do a lot of git branch upstream/dev; git branch -b the_new_issue_branch.\n. @ggarek Feel like writing it? :)\nI'm sure there are some \"jQuery/drop-in\" functions to filter existing lists with a simple text filter.\n\nNow, as far as \"global search\", currently this is one of those \"missing features\" with the standard jsdoc templates. It can be added entirely client side - albeit with a larger download footprint - by dumping the jsdoc structure into JavaScript/JSON and then searching (via JS) with links to the generated pages..\n..that being said, the \"next\" generation jsdoc template (which uses a different approach) should support such. And such searching could also be added with a similar server-side extract / helper.\nTo start this endeavor, look through https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/master/resources/docstrap-master and check out the https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc project.\n. I can also reproduce. To reproduce this behavior on a desktop, use Chrome and run a Heap Allocation Profile.\n(The Heap Allocation Profile is an extremely \"expensive\" operation that runs internal to Chrome so it can't be off-loaded of bypassed.)\n. @inkfood A patch is in to the dev docs.\nIn the meantime, the following URL can be used directly: http://docs.phaser.io/Phaser.Particles.Arcade.Emitter.html\n. Yes, using the P2 arcade system. Follow along with a few of the demos. However, a body (ie. automatic handling) is only supported on some Phaser objects, like Sprites.\n. I cannot reproduce this locally in Chrome using either a laptop keyboard, an external keyboard attached to the laptop, or a different keyboard on a separate desktop.\nWhat system (eg. OS, machine type, keyboard type) and browser(s) are affected?\nIt may be a specific hardware/system issue - although the behavior does not sound like a simple No-KRO problem due to being a \"release\" and not a \"catch\". Does this behavior ever occur on other [browser] games? Other games in general?\n. I've been trying to use or migrate toward just two forms:\n- onFoo for signal-based events (and .add), which can have multiple subscribers, that correspond to higher-level events that are called \"relatively infrequently\"; and\n- setBarCallback(), wrapping any direct setting of an internal callback property, for a single event only supporting one subscriber, for which a full signal does not apply, and is expected to be called at a much higher rate (by itself or as an aggregate)\nIt'd definitely be nice to have some \"lets [eventually] work towards this..\" direction.\n. I do not believe that a different system (like the events found in pixi.js) would actually be faster, without simply removing some features of Signals, as it effectively just inverts what \"stores\" the event binding information.\nOne disadvantage of the signals over per-object events is that they require an object per-signal, but that can be managed reasonably well with some conventions.\nOn the other hand, per-object events usually use a separate internal dispatch object and use dynamic lookups (which [all] browsers do not optimize as well). Granted the new Event changes also use dynamic lookups, so one could claim a pig in sheep's clothes..\nHowever, once all the internal objects are created (eg. support for multiple bindings, contexts, memoization or whatever) the graphs and access of such are pretty much identical - barring things like array interleaving, which themselves may not be beneficial to performance.\nI'd suspect that one of the better optimizable methods would be to use a static template generator and specialize based off conventions .. but it would still be slower, fsvo, than calling a single callback stored in a property, should that be used. Of course, benchmarks needed!\n. I can reproduce with current dev + physics patch applied (so that bit is out of the way).\n. This falls under the \"parent should not apply padding\" scenario - I agree that the documentation could be updated to be a bit more clear as the issue is that any CSS on the parent (or Game canvas) that alters the relation between the read and applied bounds can be problematic.\nI would recommend adding the border to the grandparent element of the Game canvas (ie. the parent of the Game cavnas' parent) which will likely bypass the issue.\n. Make sure the jsdoc module is installed \"globally\" as it is a program. The following should do the trick:\nnpm install -g jsdoc\n. @kabuhr The problem is \"eventually\" is not after each logic update - currently (or before, depending on which branch talked about) this update only occurs during the stage render. This means that two logic updates called in a row may produce incorrect results if the scene graph is not \"synced\" between them and objects are moved.\nThe reported problem occurs when multiple logic updates occur each game loop. While this would be an optimization (and it does work for updates via Arcade physics bodies) of one part it does not work universally; for instance, if a Group or Image (or Sprite, but not via Physics) is moved in the first update(s).\n. I'll get a patch in later today - I didn't realize there was a restriction.\nThe fix is changing the evals into closures (it won't affect the approach itself at all); that was me trying to be clever and not have the enclosing scope closed over and possibly take advantage of JS compiler interning - \"don't ask\".\n. @pandavigoureux29 \nThis is a PIXI regression. There is indeed no more PIXI.updateWebGLTexture and this part of pixi has not been updated. (It could also be fixed in a later pixi head/dev version.)\nConsider posting the issue to https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js/issues, if it has not already been done.\n. Well, that's a can of worms..\n. YMMV with the PR.\nTests and TLC / updates welcome!\n. (Parasite, but related, question)\nHow is the phaser.d.ts file generated?\nAnd more importantly (for me), does a missing/incorrect TS entry indicate an error with the jsdoc?\nI see some patches come in for updates, and I hope it's not an [entirely] manually process.\n. @photonstorm That is indeed the \"correct\" approach - and as admitted the current UA approach may miss out on Chrome for iOS, etc. (It should probably use iOS -> force double copy.)\nI'm just shy on a device on hammer out the exact details of the failing case.\n. That update (the \"real\" one) should make it default to a double-copy except when using a known-to-work browser not on iOS.\nA proper feature check would be better, but I'm not entirely certain of the exact minimal reproduction case that I can verify/test locally. (Patches to canvasBitBltShift detection welcome!)\nWhile defaulting to a double-copy isn't the most \"ideal\" it is still able to dramatically benefit from reduced tile redraw (and on a desktop system performs on par with the single bitblt copy); so these last updates err on the side of caution.\n. \"Graphically\", it looks like:\n^\n                        margin_y\n                            v\n< margin_x >  A  < spacing_x > B < spacing_x > C\n                            ^\n                       spacing_y\n                            v\n< margin_x >  X  < spacing_x > Y < spacing_x > Z\n. (I want to stress this is not tested and needs some TLC / review.)\n. @wayfu One of the problems is \"a color object\" isn't well-defined.\nMy first step when approaching a problem like this is first updating the documentation to reflect the current behavior. This may defining what \"a color object\" is better in context.\nThen the current code can be compared vs the documented (as in what the function does) behavior - does the current code hold? If so (and it is not a private-annotated method), then try to avoid chainging the function in a way incompatible with the documentation - and this may be \"accepts 0..1 or 0..255\" but you'll have to carefully identify it.\nI believe rgba is primarily (only) used in a few cases, such as for background colors (eg. when the color setting bleeds down to pixi.js). More generally it may be useful for CSS - although that's outside of core.\nI don't \"see\" a problem with always returning rgba(r,g,b,0..1) in the CSS manner; mainly make sure that the documentation (contract) / implementation and usages agree.\nHowever, returning {a: 0..1} where it was previously {a: 0..255} might be problematic (see the image/color manipulation demos, perhaps); but again, it's about the documentation vs. current implementation and usages of such.\n. Nice image story - it makes the problem clear.\nUnfortunately, I don't think is trivially resolvable with the current Arcade physics ..\nThe collisions of the entire system need to be considered to prevent moved objects (that are not themselves marked as immovable) from pushing through other objects (immovable or not).\nP2 is an implementation that can understand the system-wide constraints - is there a particular aspect of P2 that is undesirable in this case? (It might be able to work around such if there is.)\nIn general I would only use Arcade in a system where a particular initiator always reacts (eg. target is immovable), there is a custom handler, or touch = event & pass-through or pick-up; there are many games that fit in this category, but not everything.\n. @hydrabolt I wonder if it may simply be simplest for the current case to make the \"brick\" immovable so that the Arcade physics will not move it in a collision.\nAny interaction (eg. pushing) with the brick would then have to be controlled manually, of course. It should be able to use the left/right touching in that case.\n. Here is the are some documentation excerpts from GameObjects, for an overview:\n```\n/\n @classdesc\n Game objects are {@link PIXI.DisplayObject display objects} with additional Phaser features.\n\n Because there is not a single prototype hierarchy a \"GameObject\" mixin system is used to \n* consistently add the appropriate game object features to different Phaser types.\n\nAll game objects are expected to inherit from PIXI.DisplayObject or otherwise \nimplementation the methods and properties it defines.\n*\n\n\n*\nA mixin approach is used to avoid altering the prototype inheritance while providing maximum\nfeature compatibility and code/documentation sharing between existing types.\n*\nThis approach has been designed for maximum code-resue and consistency with no/minimal performance\nimpact; the shared functions and easy of applying general optimizations may even improve overall performance,\neven if the functions themselves are not specialized.\n*\nJudicial guards - lifted into a prototype or instance as appropriate - are used to handle\nvaried features and care is taken to not introduce extra work.\n(Support for various Traits can be triggered after an object is created by adding properties.)\n*\nThe following game object mixins are available:\n*\n\n\n{@link Phaser.GameObject.CoreMixin} - Included in every game object.\n\n\n\n\n{@link Phaser.GameObject.CullingMixin}\n\n\n\n\n{@link Phaser.GameObject.TextureMixin}\n\n\n\n\n{@link Phaser.GameObject.InputMixin}\n\n\n\n\n{@link Phaser.GameObject.EventsMixin}\n\n\n\n\n{@link Phaser.GameObject.PhysicsMixin}\n\n\n\n\n{@link Phaser.GameObject.LifeMixin}\n*\n\n\nUsing separate types also allows documentation generation and inheritance tracing. In JSDoc this\nis handled with the use of multuple @extends doclets.\n*\n\n\nEven though no MI is used, multiple @extends JSDoc doclets result in correct output that shows the\n\n\nmixin member with the type and links to the inherited base.\n(JSDoc 3.3 should include @interface/@implements and better @mixin support.)\n\n\nGoogle Closure Compiler may currently support @interface/@implements.\n*\n\n\n@class Phaser.GameObject\n@protected\n*/\n\n/\n Various traits that a game object can have.\n\n The property values represent bitmask flag;\n supply the relevant trait mask to {@link Phaser.GameObject.mix mix}.\n\n @member\n @property {number} CULLING - Supports camera/world culling.\n     There is currently no per-type performance impact for supporting CULLING.\n @property {number} TEXTURE - Supports textures, but not necessarily frames.\n @protpert {number} TEXTURE_FRAMES - Supports keyed texture frames, implies TEXTURE.\n @property {number} INPUT - Supports input.\n @property {number} EVENTS - Supports events (implied by INPUT and LIFE).\n @property {number} LIFE - Supports 'alive'.\n @property {number} PHYSICS - Supports a physics body.\n @property {number} GRAPHICS_LIKE -\n     Supports CULLING and INPUT - no physics or textures as they are expected to be provided by the implementation.\n @property {number} SPRITE_LIKE -\n     A sprite is a \"full\" game object and supports every individual Trait.\n @property {number} IMAGE_LIKE -\n     There isn't much difference between an Image and a Sprite except an Image \"doesn't\" support PHYSICS.\n     Also includes LIFE for compatibility with existing code.\n @protected\n*/\n```\n. It is indeed important to get out a point-release.\nThe update logic could probably be resorted; the code is simply trying to unify the previous methods without adding regressions. Improvements or suggestions of such are always welcome.\nI did a few tests with the cache array vs. using normal properties and it was on the fence in Chrome so I left it alone; but Chrome is magic all about. I really need to setup a cross-browser performance marks to be able to get some better numbers - especially on mobile environments - to make sure it's not just Best on Chrome (TM).\nIt will reduce the file and run-time sizes a tiny bit; I don't think it'll be a big overall change.\nI've never used Rope, but it's better to say \"not supported\" than \"it's supported (but doesn't work)\".\n. Which README - and issue(s) in such - is being referred to?\nAnyway, Tilemaps and TilemapLayers don't use Physics at all.\n. The orientation should never change on a desktop and \"always\" be horizontal - if it does then that's a regression issue [from the target changes], and is an issue I explicitly thought I addressed. (That is, changing the browser size shouldn't change the actual orientation.)\nI may be misunderstanding how orientation is used.\nThat being said, uhh, hmm .. breaking, mumble ..\nIf the browser doesn't support the Orientation API then using scale.compatibility.orientationFallback = 'viewport' should provide the previous behavior. (It will default to 'screen' for desktops.)\nIf the browser does support the Orientation API - and I am not sure how desktop browsers handle this - then the behavior can be altered by changing what DOM.getScreenOrientation returns, ie. simply returning based on the viewport ratio which is one of the alternate checks.\nThis problem warrants more exploration.\n. Thanks for reporting the issue and providing a PR!\nHere is some feedback :)\n1. I would consider if (!frames.hasOwnProperty(key)) { continue; } - and I don't use continue very often.\n2. I'm not sure how that hasOwnProperty guard would uhh .. \"correct\" anything, unless frames has some prototype (but how would that be set, and by whom?) or is an Array. That is, it probably just masks a problem.\n3. The problem shown in the linked post just using an incorrect method to loop arrays (short answer: never use for..in to loop arrays); and if frames is an array it should simply be converted to a for(i=0;i<len;i++) loop.\nProviding the (incorrect) JSON output of Opal may clear up some [of my] confusion; I would be much more keen on providing a corrective action that specifically targets an Opal-provided array (or whatever Opal generates incorrectly), if such is the case.\n. I'm fine with a local Phaser patch - I suspect I'm not alone.\nCare to create a PR?\n. I don't want to say it's a \"bug\" - although it may be unexpected.\nUnlike some of the Phaser container collections the filter list is not automatically updated for filters marked as destroyed. (It could be argued that calling destroy on the filters if they are not removed is undefined behavior as then a \"destoyed\" filter will be used.)\nA valid way to remove the filters is to\n- reassign the filters property with the new filters (or null if none, as shown);\n- and call destroy on any removed filters that are no longer used - so the WebGL resources can be released.\n. I would remove the instanceof check.\nIf it isn't a correct type per the documentation - which is a formal contract - it should not silently \"do nothing\" as this only hides a programming problem. If using such a check failing input should probably result in an exception instead of being ignored.\n(I favor not using instanceof because it goes counter to duck typing.)\n. It would is best to start with finding out why the CPU usage is high. The Chrome CPU profiler is a very good tool for this, if Chrome is available (is this also available in Safari-desktop?).\nSaveCPU won't make code that runs use any less processing, and a CPU that sits idle is just wasting time that it could be doing something (granted it uses less energy). That is a slow algorithm/approach might be slow; and an efficient algorithm might just have it's hands full on the given hardware.\nPhaser now has direct support for \"FPS control\" via game.time.desiredFps - but do note that this also has a direct relation on physic updates as well.\nThe source here indicates that SaveCPU only affects switching the mode to HEADLESS on occasion.\n\nReduce CPU usage caused from redudant rendering on idle or static display scenes reduce fps for casual/puzzle games\n\nSuch will only help with CPU used by rendering and not the CPU used by logic updates (eg. collisions). A CPU profile will be able to indicate where the performance issue (or issues) occur.\n(It could also be the case that SaveCPU does not work \"as expected\" with a particular version of Phaser being tested.)\n. Feel like making the appropriate change(s) to the documentation templates?\nIt would be appreciated - and likely result in this being corrected sooner.\nThere is another issue for a filter - it may be beneficial to collaborate with that author and/or see where such changes can be made. Also make sure jsdoc is available to enable grunt docs to rebuild the docs for local verification.\n. @rivertam Thanks for the PR.\nHowever, can you submit another one without all the changes to the docs themselves? (Just make the changes to the templates, but don't \"add\" changes to the docs/ directory.)\nThe docs can be generated locally for verification and are eventually generated for deployment to the phaser documentation site, but shouldn't be committed unless a \"release\". Then the PR will easily show the important changes.\n. @rivertam That's much easier on the eyes, thanks!\n. @belohlavek Thanks for reporting this.\nUnfortunately I do have a access to iOS; any further details (ie. the expression / line that causes the exception) would be appreciated.\nAlso, does the behavior change between Phaser 2.1.3 and 2.2?\n. But the error message is a Phaser issue, per the contracts - I wouldn't mind fixing it, but have insufficient details as to the exception source.\nIf the API doesn't work the ScaleManager should simply call the the onFullScreenError signal and not throw an exception. A consistent behavior can help unify the action between devices.\n. Oh, I misread that as \"Chrome on iOS\". Still odd that is should occur though.\n. The problem is because the ScaleManager config is being applied before a renderer has been created by the game - this.game.renderer.resize(this.width, this.height) in updateDimensions, called from scaleMode = .. in ScaleManager.parseConfig, is the failing line.\n. This is due to circular and semi-circular dependencies between the ScaleManager and a few other components.\nI'm working on a corrective update.\n. What \"index numbers\"?\nPhaser uses many arrays internally and it is unclear what the task/request/question is; or if the question is about \"index numbers\" (and which ones, the z-index?) or game object IDs or ..\n. I'm not exactly sure what this would benefit .. and it's not a practical change internally.\nTo keep track of items by index a separate (user) array or object lookup could be used.\nIf really wanting to force this in a Game Object / Display Object, one could sort of simulate such with adding 30 \"dummy\" items. I'm not really sure what such would grant though - and the lower-level PIXI functions would need to be used for a direct \"replacement\", IIRC.\n. I would check the user-supplied texture first, before using it.\nThe same logic check can be used - but applied sooner, and then resulting in a \"friendly error\".\nHowever, if the texture is used then I think it is fitting that it's a should-not-be-handled exception: it's a programming boo boo.\n. @fyyyyy If you could override the \"on load\" behavior the resource (it would have to be loaded via the Loader and not a resource URL used directly as a PIXI resource), would that be sufficient to handle this problem easily?\n. Is this specific to a Tile/Tiling Sprite? That is, does the error occur if a non-TS is used as a background?\n(If it doesn't then there is a specific issue with the TS logic, if it does then the issue may be more general.)\n. Bah, I hate tossing code. But the N-slice was specifically for Safari which is still busted with it. Removed.\n. http://codepen.io/anon/pen/vEZdEQ demo (Phaser hosted here)\n. Hmm, I thought such might already be detectable given http://examples.phaser.io/_site/view_full.html?d=input&f=out+of+game.js&t=out%20of%20game (this seems to always correctly detect when out-of-game even when pressing the mouse down).\nI suppose the game logic could be updated to use that - basically an isDownButHasntLeftGame.\n(Oh dear, I lied about the above. I switched tabs - in Chrome - and switched back and then it didn't detect leaving.. or update for the mouse down and movement .. until a another HTML element was focused.)\n. In that case I wonder if it'd be possible to get isDown to behave consistently or if it's a lost cause :/\nIt's always resets when FF leaves the canvas but only \"most of the time\" in IE or Chrome.\n. @photonstorm  I just pulled from dev and this does not appear to the be the current case.\nThe properties appear on/through the instance when doing a new Phaser.Sprite(). Is this still a concern?\n. There was a slight accidental logic change with the new loader handling. This should still work per the documentation. I've added a PR patch.\n. Okay, I get the flickering now. The code should be ..map.getTile(x,y,layers[0]).. to recreate the problem.\nDisabling scroll delta fixes this so it is probably some code that does not correctly restore the composition alpha..\n. @nkholski I've pushed a dev patch. As a work-about this should do the trick:\n// Work-about for Issue 1666; remove for next version release\nPhaser.TilemapLayer.prototype._render = Phaser.TilemapLayer.prototype.render;\nPhaser.TilemapLayer.prototype.render = function () {\n    this.context.save();\n    this._render();\n    this.context.restore();\n}\n. Also, I got Mario to fall off the map :crying_cat_face: \n. Patches welcome! \n. Does not fix problems fully\n. But that does fix it..\n. @speige The Device type has a useful signal to handle the case, Phaser.Device.onInitialized, where the detected defaults need to be changed.\nThis signal is invoked after all the standard device initializations/dections have run. Just make sure this signal is added before any Phaser game object is created.\nUse it as so:\n```\nPhaser.Device.onInitialized.add(function (device) {\n  // Note: can use previously setup device.* properties, this runs after all that\n  if (device.webGL && device.cordova) {\n    var platform = device.platform.toLowerCase();\n    if (device.android || platform.indexOf('amazon-fireos') != -1) {\n      var majorVersion = parseFloat(device.version.split('.')[0]);\n      if (majorVersion < 5) {\n        // whoops, looks like was older Kindle/Cordova :<\n        // override the previously set device property\n        device.webGL = false;\n      }\n   }\n});\n```\n. It sprite doesn't keep running.\nThe problem is group.destroy triggers a destroy of the animation from within the update - but later on, in the same update, the (now invalid) _frameData.getFrame is called.\nThe setInterval (of any amount) delays the side-effects until later.\n. There is a patch for the issue.\nIn the meantime the best work-about is probably to keep using setInterval(.., 0).\nYMMV with destroying objects from other events.\n. Reproduced locally, IE11/Edge.\nUnfortunately this issue affects most (all?) keyboard examples.\n. I think a good approach would be to move the checkPixel out to the game object types and allow polymorphism/specialization. (BitmapText and Text work a bit differently, for instance.)\nI briefly looked at such an approach and could not find immediate fault with it.\n. If the behavior differs radically from previous versions wrt where exceptions are thrown then this is an oversight on my part. And any cases where it throws exception that did not before are .. well, also an oversight.\nHave an example case to reproduce the issue(s)? All the catch statements (from loading resources) funnel through to a handler and the only known promotion from an event callback to immediate execution (that I know of) is fileComplete for a cached image..\n. The forum post is using mute already for the 'broken example' (?).. anyway, perhaps it is a different problem of _muted not being set correctly on the SoundManager? As the mute property will check _muted and then the global game mute.\n(It might be more appropriate to use mute anyway, but it would be nice if the underlying cause was more clearly identified.)\n. It doesn't seem 'right' to use new Phaser.RandomDataGenerator('myseed', stateOfGen) - that is, doesn't the state encompass the seed in a PRNG? I would expect something like new Phaser.RandomDataGenerator(stateOfGen) to suffice. I do like the idea of a saveable/restartable state, though. (For those save+load+die+load+die+load+..+eventuallybeatgame scenarios..)\n. @luckylooke There is a conflicting change currently between the current dev branch and the PR [dev] brnach.\nSimply fetch the current dev branch and merge in changes. There will be conflicts that need to be resolved; fix the conflicts and push the PR branch again.\nAnyway, since as you can see this fetch+merge could muck around with other local changes, I always do a git checkout -b \"name of thing I am working on\" from the latest dev before starting changes. (That creates a new branch and checks it out.)\n. @luckylooke Also, what about returning / accepting the state as an opaque string value?\n. Instead of returning an object a string would be returned. 'Opaque' meaning the user should not care or have any guarantee about what the contents are, except that it can be used to restore the state.\nFor instance maybe the resulting state might be \"!rng:DJSNN#$H!!@*!*#SDXVAASDFF\".\n(The point being, to the user, it's just a 'simple value' representing the state.)\nJust a thought.\n. @luckylooke The string can be whatever you want - as long as it's written and read back usefully. It doesn't even have to be cryptic, eg.\n```\nstateStr = \"!\" + [s0, s1, ..].join(\"|')\nstatStr = JSON.encode([s0, s1, ..])\nstateStr = base64encode(JSON.encode(..))\n```\nWhich are all different - reversible - encodings I just made up. Ideally it would be come compact representation but that is less important than ensuring the state itself is kept as an opaque structure.\n. @luckylooke By using some form of value detection.\nCurrently seeds must be an array (of any value); thus the state might simply be a string - and a string that follows a particular encoded value format or 'magic' header.\nFor example:\nif ((typeof seeds === 'string' || seeds instanceof String) && seeds.match(/^!rng/) {\n   // seeds is a string of the captured internal state\nWhile (\"\" + seeds).match(/^!rng/) would be similar it would also 'match' when the input was ['!rng', 'but I should be seeds'], which is why the above uses somewhat icky type checking as well.\n. @luckylooke It creates an opaque value - think of a GUID. There is no point caring about what it is (or what it contains); only what it represents is important.\nThis small opaque value is - should ideal be created such, already - densely encoded and can appear unobtrusively in other serialization contexts where a primitive value is accepted.\nFor example, a save file might look like\n{\n    days: 200,\n    worldGenerator: \"bc67268941194c5e8f565b402ef8c90c\"\n}\nor a url might appear as\n../game?start=bc67268941194c5e8f565b402ef8c90c\nAs far as why it should be an opaque value in the API itself - it is some internal state that is being returned and injected, and nobody should have a bloody clue 'how' that works, except that such a value returned represents, and can restore, a certain RNG state. (This is not for security, this is for keeping opaque state opaque.)\nAgain the exact format of this opaque string value can be just about anything - but it should be designed to be relatively compact and cleanly embedded-able in contexts of URLs, string literals, and whatnot.\n. This only affects WEBGL; in CANVAS mode the debug information is written directly to the same-same output.\n. May be related to https://bugs.dojotoolkit.org/ticket/18346\n(I wonder if the Browser's 'touchend' event is fired as well..)\n. In the link the sprite appears to be to the left (when first placed), but the text appears to be centered - on the sprite.\nI've tested in recent Chrome and FF.\n. It is probably how Safari/WebKit applies the font style changes or renders the font (of 'fractional point sizes').\nThere is nothing specific to any browser in the tweening; it merely updates the attribute(s) according to some function and time so it is probably not a 'bug' with Phaser; or necessarily a 'problem' with the code. Just one of those darn unpleasant browser differences that arise.\nInstead of tweening the font size it may be possible to get better (or at least more consistent) tweening results by changing the object's scale.\n. Is this affecting any current functionality?\n(If it is, the behavior can be overriden in http://phaser.io/docs/2.4.3/Phaser.Device.html#.onInitialized)\nI would personally like to see migration towards less 'categorization' and more features, in part because it avoids .. ambiguity like such. The same holds true for the browser categorization and the detection is quite a mess. I would say that would include removing support for desktop / mobile and replacing with or using, eg, keyboard / touchpad when needed .. but that may be too aggressive in P2.\n. All splice.call's on arguments should probably be slice.calls - arguments and aliasing can lead to some ugly JS de-optimizations if it's mucked with. (I believe they were originally slice calls .. and were incorrectly mass-replaced.)\nWorking on some jsperf test-cases; which should reveal if such a change back is outright 'OK' from any sort of performance view .. or perhaps promote the use of splice with corrections.\n. That PR should affect (as in, replace/update) all splice.calls in the current code base.\nHopefully it fixes the problem observed. However - at least in Desktop Chrome and FF - splice will \"work\" even when the length is omitted and slice(N) as the same result as splice(N), at least for N in [0, arr.length); ignoring side-effects.\nSo while I think it's an improvement to the code and it does improve 'efficiency' a teeny weeny - albeit practically unmeasurable - bit, I'm not 100% sure it will fix the problem.\nFeedback - including details about the affected environments - is most welcome.\n. Unfortunately the keys are 'part' of the actual Keyboard type itself and not separate enumeration.\nFrom a documentation point it may be better to create a pseudo-type and then link to it, explaining such. I thought there was already such a type setup, but I cannot find it, so I do not even know if this is currently feasible/recommended.\n. @tennysonholloway  Is the same url ever loaded multiple times?\nAlso, can you create a small - runnable - reproduction case (using setInteval/setTimeout)?\n. Hmm, the double-registrations (for pointerover) look odd. That should be revisited, perhaps.\nAt the very least the pointerover event should have the non-capture also removed as well; per above it is added under both modes when not in Cocoon.\nAnyway, what about specifying false explicitly for the non-capture event removal to match the registrations (and make the need for having both 'more apparent')?\n. Oh, just hard to follow matches as they are twisted around. Taking the registrations and removing comments/if/indentation it is \n```\n        canvas.addEventListener('MSPointerDown', this._onMSPointerDown, false);\n        canvas.addEventListener('MSPointerMove', this._onMSPointerMove, false);\n        canvas.addEventListener('MSPointerUp', this._onMSPointerUp, false);  \n    canvas.addEventListener('pointerdown', this._onMSPointerDown, false);\n    canvas.addEventListener('pointermove', this._onMSPointerMove, false);\n    canvas.addEventListener('pointerup', this._onMSPointerUp, false);\n\n    window.addEventListener('MSPointerUp', this._onMSPointerUpGlobal, true);\n    canvas.addEventListener('MSPointerOver', this._onMSPointerOver, true);\n    canvas.addEventListener('MSPointerOut', this._onMSPointerOut, true);\n\n    window.addEventListener('pointerup', this._onMSPointerUpGlobal, true);\n    canvas.addEventListener('pointerover', this._onMSPointerOver, true);\n    canvas.addEventListener('pointerout', this._onMSPointerOut, true);\n\n```\nThen a Ctrl+R would make the required change change from addEventListener to removeEventListener would fix the bug and keep a clear paring.\n.\n. I think it looks good. Thanks for the bugfix and updates.\n.

The first step would be to try difference scenarios (devices) with such disabled and to see  the difference, if any.\n. I'm actually inclined to say the check should be removed entirely - ie. revert the changes to Button.js in https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/commit/96fd0ade\nI cannot find any mention of what bug it fixes, if any. This includes that commit and the following Phaser (2.3.1) release documentation.\nAt the very least the reason for this - and if/when it applies - needs to be identifier for it to say, IMOHO. I'd rather get it out and then work in a solution if/when a [minor] bug report comes in.\n. @j27cai Anyway, this commit won't work right (and I should have spotted it sooner) because the fastClick parameter, coming from an Input event, will never be anything but undefined - it is called as this.sprite.events.onInputOver$dispatch(this.sprite, pointer) from InputHandler.js.\nIf anything the fastClick should be a Button property like Button.forceOut which would work and be a configurable setting ..\n.

It would nice to address this with #2062 - the tricky bit may be with touch devices..\n. Hmm, this is worded all wrong.\n. Hr, hr. The UI is a bit different on most touch UIs; in these cases moving off the button appears to be the same as considering the pointer to be released.\nProbably should consider 'mouse' and 'touch' modes for most of these behaviors.\n. Okay, the latest PR adds and option that defaults to 'mouse like behavior' or 'touch like behavior', depending on pointer.\nIt now works as expected for a mouse input (solving this posted issue); and arguably works as expected for a touch input (leaving the behavior on touch devices alone to what it is, which is arguable still incorrect due to keeping an 'over' state) - the behavior can be configured through a setting.\nBecause of this change the already relatively-low impact on existing code is reduced.\nThe PR code now mirrors 'native' browser button types, depending on pointer type.\nThe next piece of the puzzle is trying in an onClick even that is guaranteed-value wrt the 'isPressed' state.\n. The 'Added Button.onClick signal' commit is a minor breaking change, although arguably for the better. Ref #2079\nWhen the \"action callback\" is attached via the constructor is is associated with onClick - and not onInputUp. To handle the (unaffected) onInputUp event as before, it must be bound to the signal explicitly.\nThis can cause slightly different - more correct for a button in general - results when existing code was relying on non-checked onUp behavior when the action was attached from the constructor. Some of the examples will have to be slightly modified to correctly explain/demonstrate the affected behavior.\n. Ref #2082 \n. Which version(s) of Phaser?\nAlso, can you generate a reproduction case (ie. in http://phaser.io/sandbox or http://codepen.io/anon/pen/Qjybbz) or link to an example with the behavior present?\nI did a quick grep of the code-base and didn't see any 'obvious' interactions on the dev branch.\n. This is 'correct' behavior because time.event is real-world (wallclock) time, not physics time.\nThe documentation isn't always the best at the making the delineation ..\nCounting the elapsed physics time in the update (and reacting accordingly) will yield the correct behavior; it should even work across tweening of slow-motion or other fun effects.\n. Example: http://jsbin.com/ditecudewi/edit?js,output\nGist for future:\nvar vx = 0;\nfunction update () {\n  vx += game.time.physicsElapsed;\n  if (vx > 1) {\n    vx = 0;\n    // one second of physics-time elapsed, as affected by slow motion\n    // (this could be more or less than one second of wallclock time)\n    console.log(\"wallclock time: \" + (+new Date / 60));\n  }\n}\n. Alternatively, because tweens run in physics time, a tween (with a 'dummy object') could be created and the appropriate completion event handled..\n. @SVasilev  'dev' head is currently '2.4.4-beta' (implicitly); 2.4.3 is lastest release.\n. Confirmed that there is some 'intermittent stutters' in post 2.1.3 builds, though dev. Does not appear to affect 2.1.3 itself.\nOn my system the frame stutter is only momentary (but keeps recurring every ~20-30s) making me believe it's related to some GC thrashing.. on a system without a fast enough GC (or fast SSD if going to swap) this could degenerate to 'lags continuously' from there on out until it is given enough time to relax.\nMay be related to a PIXI change - the game works be panning around a large (4k x 3k) scaled image, which probably doesn't help. The effect is observable in both CANVAS and WEBGL modes.\nHeap allocation profile does not appear to be excessive, so it's an 'internal' implementation issue. Have not tried on other browsers.\n. May be wrong for other kinds of transformations. Probably just need to normalize around world space transforms. \n. Sure you don't want to learn some gitfu? Pull requests are fun!\nI wonder if there was any edge case that relied on not-flipping.. since this appears to be a pixi issue, make sure they get notification as well.\n. https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/pull/2081\nIf there are any more,  submit PR off of current development branch.  Just documentation or local name updates - then no code breaks or compatibility shims. \n. Which Phaser build/version caused the regression?\n. Does this still occur on the dev branch from a recent local pull?\nThe example site has issues with version selection, and I am not sure how often the dev is updated. \n. My guess is there is some 'residual state' in the transformations that was being cycled. IIRC, this also happened a long time ago when the state matrix was not restored.\n. Does the observed performance behavior change between different versions of Phaser? \nAlso, is the juminess only temporary after a refresh? \nUsually such jumps are caused by GC or other resource cleanup; it also takes some time for browsers to collect stats and optimize/jit code.  It is also possible such behavior can be triggered by CPU throttling.\n. Curious, I would not expect the lag to persist.\nCan you create a codepen as well? \nThese mobile devices are not the best.. at editing. \n. FWIW: I am not seeing the behavior in Android Chrome, which only supports CANVAS on this device.  Here it always runs terrible for the first few seconds (I think it might be breaking through the frame skip) and then settles down. The codepen version appears to start with worse performance. \n. Even though the event is not handled (??), does Phaser.DOM.getScreenOrientation() return the correct value?\nKeep in mind that classifyOrientation is a private method: it only understands the 4 'landscape/portrait-primary/secondary' strings. If the method is being called manually, please supply a runnable codepen scenario.\n. It's a private method (not sure if that matters for the TS work).\n. @lazd  I couldn't say about the quotes, but it is definitely not exclusively one form or the other.. double-quotes appear common for defineProperty usage, but single quotes are indeed used throughout as well.\nPhaser code uses defineProperty exclusively to establish get/set properties. I'm not sure if it was initially chosen for particular reason or preference, but it seems like it would be too big a shift (esp. when intermixed with the existing code) without a clear convention consensus from the project leaders. When in Rome ..\n. This is the most important fix.\n. Shifting the canvas is alot more efficient then redrawing the entire canvas.\n. Most of these are better suited as local variables.\n. Loops simplified a bit, with post-condition always in loop body (makes continue more useful). Variable meaning documented above. All relevant calculations are cheap and can be done at top of function function.\n. @photonstorm Thanks for the reminder, I've definitely been bitten by hitting a keyword in such a case.

This is the actual logic fix.\n. This is me changing the newly introduced property name before 2.2 :dash: \n. There is the logic fix itself.\n.

Do you have a copy of your demo running where the issues are fixed with this new clock solution?\n. Pixi has no real concept of a 'game world' with cameras. It is a scene graph style. For this to work you'd have to refactor Phaser to have a concept of the 'game world' which you can define cameras on and those cameras would be Pixi containers. So Phaser would need to decouple from Pixi a ways and deal with the abstract world, and just use Pixi to render said world for the diffferent cameras. That would ofcourse be major API breakage :) \n. the dev branch is not the completely correct fix yet.\n.

Ofcourse it would be ideal to use npm/package.json for phaser installation and then be able to do:\nvar phaser = require('phaser'); \nin my browserify enabled environment.\nBut that doesn't work either atm.\n. It would seem it works fine if I copy the phaser.min.js directly into my own code tree and use the same browserify shim. Then no complaints and it works. Guess that is a workaround for now. But I would really like to be able to require() phaser as stated in my previous comment.\n. Closing this, #1186 is the place to be. Let's get phaser working with browserify out of the box.\n. What I currently do is atomatically copy phaser.min.js to my game folder using a grunt task.\nAnd then use a browserify shim to point 'Phaser' to that file. It will work then and browserify won't complain. But it's a workaround.\nA possible solution for the nw.gui test would be to try: require.resolve('nw.gui'); and catch the error as it is done now. That could fix the problem. Resolve only checks the path for the module and returns it if the module is available but doesn't load the module, and thus browserify won't have to load it. \n. It's all down to preference, browserify allows me to use node modules easily and still generate one minified, uglified game.js file. I needed something to triangulate polygons and found a decent module on npmjs.org. npm install the lib. require in my code, and go.\nAnyway, the solution from my comment above works fine, and it's what I'll be using.\n.

On the right is the image sized down first (half of height) then rotated 45 degrees:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/6JIFxSl.png\nThat's how the sprite should look when you compare rotation first vs scale first. But it seems in Phaser you can only achieve scale first, even if you specify the rotation first:\nfunction create() {\nvar spriteB = game.add.sprite(400, 200, 'phaser');\nspriteB.rotation = .78;  // or .angle = 45;\n  spriteB.scale.set(1,.5);\nvar spriteC = game.add.sprite(500, 200, 'phaser');\nspriteC.scale.set(1,.5);\n  spriteC.rotation = .78;  // or .angle = 45; \n}\nI couldn't quite figure out how to fork your code. I didn't see a button for it. But if you paste the above into your sandbox, you will see that the effects are the same, regardless of the order of rotate/scale. \nI've also tried to achieve the rotation first on a bitmap data object, using the copy method. Unfortunately, it always scales first even though the docs say the rotation takes place \"before drawing. \" I can't use bitmaps anyway because they are too resource intensive with a lot of images. But I thought i would try. \nP.S. Just to give you some background as to why I am trying to achieve rotation first, then scale: I'm trying to put a group of images that are 2d, into isometric perspective. In order to achieve isometric perspective from 2d, image needs to be rotated 45 degrees then scaled to half on the y axis. \n. I'm afraid cacheAsBitmap doesn't work no matter what order i put it in (scale, cache, rotate; rotate, cache, scale, etc). :(\nvar spriteC = game.add.sprite(500, 200, 'phaser');\nspriteC.rotation = .78; // or .angle = 45;\nspriteC.cacheAsBitmap = true; \nspriteC.scale.set(1,.5);\nAny other ideas? I'd like to avoid going a bitmap route because there are A LOT of images. Thanks for the help!\n. Well I've hit a complete dead end. Spent the entire weekend trying to do this: tried  it with tweens, bitmaps, scale manager, nope, the result is always the same. You can't size down an image that's been rotated. You can only size down the original image dimensions. This really sucks because I have to rewrite large aspects of the game as a workaround. In the planning stages I really thought I would be able to do this. \n. Thanks a lot Richard. It works perfectly with  preserveDrawingBuffer. I'm not sure how much that will hinder performance, but it seems to be unaffected (i'll do more rigorous testing later). \nNow my only problem is that it only seems to be able to copy the visible portion of the canvas. Is there anyway to capture the entire game.world and not just the portion visible in the window? I'm using this code:\nvar bmd = game.add.bitmapData(150, 150);\n            bmd.copy(game.canvas,0,0,game.width,game.height,0,0,null,null,0,0,0,.1,.1); \n            var miniMap = bmd.addToWorld(300,300);\n. Okay, so I figured out that if I don't scale the canvas while drawing/copying, I can capture the entire thing (including non-visible portions) in bitmap data.\nNo all I need to do is figure out how to scale down the bitmap data object! I can see that there is a method for resize:http://phaser.io/docs/2.3.0/Phaser.BitmapData.html#resize\nDoesn't seem to work though if I pass it a width/height. \n. That's interesting. If I convert the bmd to an image (so I can scale it), it will only show the portion of the bitmap data which was visible. \nvar bmd = game.add.bitmapData(game.width, game.height);\n    bmd.copy(game.canvas, 0, 0, game.width, game.height, 0, 0, null, null, 0, 0, 0);\n    var image = game.add.image(200, 200, bmd);\n    image.scale.setTo(.1);\nBut if I instead add the bitmap data directly to the canvas, the entire canvas is shown:\nvar bmd = game.add.bitmapData(game.width, game.height);\n    bmd.copy(game.canvas, 0, 0, game.width, game.height, 0, 0, null, null, 0, 0, 0);\n    var image = game.add.image(200, 200, bmd);\n    //      image.scale.setTo(.1);\n    var miniMap = bmd.addToWorld(200,200);\nI wonder why reducing the scale size cuts it off, as if the copy of canvas was only that portion in the visible window? \n.

Does it happen when you call kill as well?\n. I'm having trouble understanding what \"A RenderTexture based renderer\" is. Say I want to create a rendertexture of a photon storm particle emitter. How do I do that? It was pretty straightforward in vanilla Phaser and I could directly render the emitter objects to the render texture, e.g.:\nburnerRenderTexture.renderXY(burnerSmokeEmitter, 0, 0, true);\nburnerRenderTexture.renderXY(flameEmitter, 0, 0, false);\nJust trying to figure out how to do that in PS with Phaser.ParticleStorm.Renderer.RenderTexture. Any code examples would be helpful. Thanks! \n. I studied those examples and couldn't seem to make heads or tails. What I want to do essentially is create a single particle emitter, render it to a rendertexture and use that rendertexture as the texture on many different sprites. I've used this trick before on normal particle emitters and it works like a charm. Having 100 render textures of a single particle emitter is much better on performance than having 100 particle emitters... in the case of PS emitters, having  a single particle emitting from several different locations is really bad on performance. I'd like to use my old trick of giving a bunch of sprites a render texture as their texture and rendering the particle emitter to that render texture. I can still have variety by rotating and scaling the sprites.. Just not sure how to do that with Particle Storm.  I tried giving sprites the renderer of PS particle emitters, but that didn't work e.g.:\nflameEmitter = manager.createEmitter(Phaser.ParticleStorm.RENDERTEXTURE);\ngame.add.sprite(0,0,flameEmitter.renderer); \nIf flameEmitter.render is in fact a render texture, shouldn't you be able to use it as a sprite texture?\nBy the way, Particle Storm is great and has lots of neat and useful stuff. You should sell more plugins like that :). \n. Works! Thanks Rich! Now I can have my thousands of particle emitters with little impact on performance. \nand yeah, I do hide the emtter. What I do in the past is add it to an invisible group. \n. I recommend using plain HTML/CSS if you want to have extremely granular control over the appearance of text in your game. \n.

If you need to reference the graphic from the sprite, simply create your own manually (there is no need to add it as a child). \n. I see. Suppose I want to mark off areas of an image and have an object collide with those areas. My only option, if I want to use separate, is to have sprites and sprite bodies representing each area of that image? That's my predicament. I want to mark off areas of an image for collision but creating separate sprites and bodies for each area would be too taxing on performance. I had hoped I could use Phaser.Rectangles to mark the areas. That solves the actual collision detection part of the problem (with rectange.intersects) but not the separation part. Am I doomed to writing my own separation function which works with Phaser.Rectangles? The areas of course, don't need to separate (they are mountains, cliffs, etc), just the physics bodies that collide with them. \n.

If you use Phaser.Math.angleBetween, you run into the same problem when using it between a pointer and sprites that are children of other sprites (and not the game world). And getting the actual world x/y on child sprites (especially child sprites of child sprites) is really a huge pain in the ass. I've had some success with the toGlobal function.

I would really really really love to have this. :)\nI am currently doing manually tweens on sprites to get the rotation going the shortest distance and it is extremely problematic, especially over a network (now I need to communicate the direction of the rotation over the network). I miss simply tweening rotations/angles. It was so easy and the product was beautiful!\n. Oh wow, thanks! I will try your solutions and report back. \n. I'm having difficulty understanding how to implement your solution. \nSuppose I have a sprite with rotation at 0. I want to tween its rotation to 1.5:\n```\nvar rotation = 1.5; \n        var turnNegative = -(Math.PI * 2 - (Math.PI * rotation));\n        var turnPositive = (Math.PI * 2 - (Math.PI * rotation));\n        var diffTurnNegative = Math.abs(gameObject.rotation - turnNegative);\n        var diffTurnPos = Math.abs(gameObject.rotation - turnPositive);\n        if (diffTurnPos > diffTurnNegative) {\n            if (rotation > 0) {\n                rotation = -rotation;\n            }\n    } else {\n        if (rotation < 0) {\n\n            rotation = rotation * -1;\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    var moveTween = game.add.tween(gameObject).to({\n        'rotation': rotation\n    }, time, Phaser.Easing.Linear.None, true);\n\n```\nWhat am I doing wrong here? I really just don't understand it. Compare the absolute distance of what? Use positive/negative signs on what, the rotation target? I guess it would make much more sense to me if I saw a complete example. Thanks!\n. If the rotation is smaller than 0 then the rotation is already negative; therefore, the sign doesn't need to change. This is all based on my interpretation of hilts-vaughan's logic, but I don't understand the math. \n. I've tried writing it like this:\n```\n    var turnNegative = -(Math.PI * 2 - (Math.PI * rotation));\n    var turnPositive = (Math.PI * 2 - (Math.PI * rotation));\n    var diffTurnNegative = Math.abs(gameObject.rotation - turnNegative);\n    var diffTurnPos = Math.abs(gameObject.rotation - turnPositive);\n    if (diffTurnPos < diffTurnNegative) {\n            rotation = turnPositive;\n\n    } else {\n            rotation = turnNegative;\n    }\n\n    var moveTween = game.add.tween(gameObject).to({\n        'rotation': rotation\n    }, time, Phaser.Easing.Linear.None, true);\n\n```\nNo luck.  \n. Wooooooooooot! \nI just tested it now and works like a charm. Here is my example with Richard's method (note that I simply copied his function because it only exists in the dev repo now):\n```\nfunction getShortestAngle(angle1, angle2) {\n    var difference = angle2 - angle1;\n    var times = Math.floor((difference - (-180)) / 360);\n\n    return (difference - (times * 360)) * -1;\n\n}\n    var shortestAngle = getShortestAngle(Phaser.Math.radToDeg(newRotation), gameObject.angle);\n    var newAngle = gameObject.angle + shortestAngle;\n\n    var moveTween = game.add.tween(gameObject).to({\n        'angle': newAngle\n    }, time, Phaser.Easing.Linear.None, true);\n\n```\nThanks everyone and I'm so glad to get this issue worked out.

I also have a function which finds the closest target, which I can also run on tween update callback. So yeah, it works pretty well.

I didn't see a response to the forum post. You're talking about this one?\nhttp://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/24535-how-to-calculate-absolute-world-xy-without-using-world-xy-property/?page=2\nI tried this method. If the camera is not at 0,0, you need to add the camera coordinates. then the camera coordinates will throw everything off based on where the camera is positioned (my camera moves a lot). Sometimes it will be okay but it all depends on where and how much the camera is moving. Also tried all these before getting the coordinates:\ngame.stage.updateTransform();\ngame.world.updateTransform();\ngameObjects.updateTransform(); (Phaser.Group all my game objects belong to)\nmsprite.parent.updateTransform();\nmsprite.parent.parent.updateTransform();\nmsprite.updateTransform();\ngame.camera.update();\nNo dice. \n. Actually, I've gotten it to the point where it works 99% of the time, but every so often, when I add the camera x/y, and the camera is moved very far from the sprite, the coords will show up near where the camera is, very far from the sprite. \n. I've just discovered that it only happens if you rapidly move the camera a large distance. Example:\nhttp://phaser.io/sandbox/edit/YfZgjVWA\nI've also discovered if you put a slight delay (e.g. 10 milli with setTimout), worldTransform will show the correct results (so long as you add the camera x/y). Why is this? Is this the best workaround? \nAnother difference between my example and yours is that I have need to constantly re-calculate the coordinates after the game has started (as parents are moving and rotating). Hence why I need to add camera.y/camera.y. \nThanks!\n. I've just discovered that it only happens if you rapidly move the camera a large distance.

In my game, the camera can jump because if you click on the mini map, the camera jumps instantly to that location. The camera is also constantly moving when a sprite is being followed as well.\nI'm sure there is some kind of trick I can use as it's an issue of timing. How does one update the \"full stage transform\"?\nI'm glad we got to the bottom of it even if the solution isn't clear yet.\n. I knew it wasn't a permanent solution.

How does one update the \"full stage transform\"?\nI'm glad we got to the bottom of it even if the solution isn't clear yet.\n. New evidence has come to light.\nIt seems the event queue works just fine under normal circumstances (regardless of the memory/cpu load Phaser is taking up), except when I execute this function at the beginning of my game:\n```\nfunction createFogOfWar() {\nvar bmd = game.make.bitmapData(game.camera.width, game.camera.height);\nbmd.fill(0, 0, 0);\nvar img = game.add.image(0, 0, bmd);\nimg.alpha = fogOfWarAlpha;\nfogOfWar.img = img;\nfogOfWar.addChild(img);\nfogOfWar.bmd = bmd;\nimg.fixedToCamera = true;\n}\n```\nYup, that one function (and not the function which updates the fog of war) causes the event queue to break when the tab is under moderate cpu/memory stress. It doesn't seem to be a memory/cpu issue as the event queue works just fine when the game is under an extremely heavy load (i.e. down to 20 FPS) without createFogOfWar(). \nThis bmd isn't even that big (it's the camera size, which is the window size). So I can't imagine what is happening here. \nThis is the kind of issue I can only assume is the result of some wires crossed under the hood, in Phaser, because I'm doing nothing out of the ordinary with my code. \n. But how is creating a bmd related to any of that?\n(hope that questions doesn't sound like \" .... but why male models??\" to you). \n. Thanks, Richard, for the explanation. It makes so much more sense now :). \nI think I will have a go at creating a web worker to run socket.io and communicate with the server. That way, nothing going on with the main thread will tie up network communications. If that fails, I will need to focus on making the cars faster, as you say. \n. okay, I've converted all my sprites to groups. e.g. the top gun and bottom of the tank are siblings in a group instead of parent-child. \nWell, it didn't fix anything, the twitching is still happening. So I'm thinking maybe the parent-child relationship has nothing to do with it... even though I thought my test (tank GIF) proved otherwise.\nWhat does have to do with it, however, is how much the renderer is working. For example, if I increase the size of the renderer (my game world is the same as the browser window and i can resize the window to resize the renderer), the twitching happens more often the larger the renderer is. So a drop in FPS correlates with the twitching. \nBut geez, it's not like a large drop in FPS and nothing is happening in the game other than a single sprite being rotated .. so I think it should be able to handle that without twitching. What could be going on here? Does that sound like completely abnormal behavior and perhaps I should be looking deeper into my own code to see if something is affecting it? Or is this expected behavior when Phaser is running at like 50 FPS?\n. okay, I've converted all my sprites to groups. e.g. the top gun and bottom of the tank are siblings in a group instead of parent-child. \nWell, it didn't fix anything, the twitching is still happening.

I expected the identifiers to match the numbers of these variablenames.\nIf getPointerFromIdentifier works as intended, returning actually no pointer with an identifier in the range of 1 to maxPointers on an iPad no matter how many presses I'll do, then I'll simply write an extra function as listed above. No problem. It just looked very much like a flaw to me or an inconsitency with the safari browser...\n.

I don't know exactly what do preUpdate functions, but can we assume safely that the user will not do something in the event callbacks that should really be done after preUpdates ?\n. I did not change the way physics time is calculated. The purpose of my modifications is to provide a consistent timing system that allow to work easily with various time references. The main clock (game.time.clock) follows the \"physic time\" computed using 'deltaCap'. Working with it ensure that everything is synchronized on this reference (objects updated with physics, timers and the clock time). As user can make it's own clocks, or we can add state-wise clocks (see below), it effectively adds to phaser different concepts of time.\nThere is an updated version of the demo of my previous post: http://www.draklia.net/phaser-timing-test/ .\nThe top line is the same as the previous demo, with the same problems (because I tried to keep backward-compatibility). The bottom line is the same, but using the new 'game.time.clock' instead of 'game.time'. As it is a consistent time reference everything stay in sync. The only remaining problem occur if a timer as a delay smaller than 'deltaCap' because event can be triggered only once per frame.\nUpdating Phaser to use custom clock anywhere time is required would indeed require major API refactoring and I agree this should wait for a major point release. However, the modification I made are (hopefully) backward-compatible and can already be used in games to solve some timing issues, like the lava bridge problem (see demo).\nAbout the points you mention:\n- Huge time spikes are handled as before, with the spike-dislike trick: if elapsed time is over some threshold (1s by default), we consider it as being 1/60 s. The difference is that spike-dislike is performed only once in Time.update() (line 253) to correct 'elapsed' if required, then 'elapsed' is used to update the clock (and the clock is used to update the timers). This mean the spike-dislike need to be done only once in the class Time and not everywhere time is required (so, the spike-dislike in timer can be removed).\n- State-wise clock makes perfect sense. In facts, users should probably only uses this kind of clock, unless they have a really good reason to do otherwise. We could easily add an attribute 'clock' to states (likely in StateManager.add, unless we decide to add logic to Phaser.State) and update it just before the call to 'state.update()' in 'Game.update()' (unless preUpdates need an up-to-date time...). A nice side effect is that clock's timers events would be triggered just before the state update, which makes much more sense than \"before anything else\".\nAll this would make the use of several states much more practical. An example: suppose we have a game with an inventory and that opening the inventory pause the game. We can have a state for the game and an other for the inventory. When the inventory is open, the clock of the game just stops. As animations, tweens, etc. should be linked in some way to the state clock, so all this stops too. When the player leave the inventory, everything continues as before, just like nothing happened. Moreover, if the game state need to compare time points recorded before and after opening the inventory, this can be done in a consistent way. If later the game designer decide that time should not stop while in the inventory, they just need to have both states running in parallel and everything should work (well, when this will be supported).\n- It would be a good thing to find a wiser way to deal with problems due to too big elapsed time than just capping it. But I think this requires some deep changes in the main game loop, and it is hardly possible to do without breaking some stuff. E.g. if the physics require step not bigger than 1/30 s to stay stable an we have a frame of 1/10 s, a solution would be to update the game 3 times to keep in sync with real-world time without breaking the physics requirement. This basically means to switch to fixed time steps (see this: http://gafferongames.com/game-physics/fix-your-timestep/). But this is not the problem I try to address here so it is a bit out-of topic, we should discuss this elsewhere.\n- I disagree on the fact that events and callback can happen at any time. Phaser event's callbacks are called when Timer.update() is called. That is, when Time.update() is called: at very beginning of Game.update(). Unless I am missing something ? As mentioned above, using state clocks may allow to move timer update just before State.update(), which seems more natural. However it do not solve the problems caused by people doing weird stuff with timers, but that is a different topic. It may be worth to document what can or can't be done in timer's callbacks.\n. I did not change the way physics time is calculated. The purpose of my modifications is to provide a consistent timing system that allow to work easily with various time references. The main clock (game.time.clock) follows the \"physic time\" computed using 'deltaCap'. Working with it ensure that everything is synchronized on this reference (objects updated with physics, timers and the clock time). As user can make it's own clocks, or we can add state-wise clocks (see below), it effectively adds to phaser different concepts of time.\nThere is an updated version of the demo of my previous post: http://www.draklia.net/phaser-timing-test/ .\nThe top line is the same as the previous demo, with the same problems (because I tried to keep backward-compatibility). The bottom line is the same, but using the new 'game.time.clock' instead of 'game.time'. As it is a consistent time reference everything stay in sync. The only remaining problem occur if a timer as a delay smaller than 'deltaCap' because event can be triggered only once per frame.\nUpdating Phaser to use custom clock anywhere time is required would indeed require major API refactoring and I agree this should wait for a major point release. However, the modification I made are (hopefully) backward-compatible and can already be used in games to solve some timing issues, like the lava bridge problem (see demo).\nAbout the points you mention:\n- Huge time spikes are handled as before, with the spike-dislike trick: if elapsed time is over some threshold (1s by default), we consider it as being 1/60 s. The difference is that spike-dislike is performed only once in Time.update() (line 253) to correct 'elapsed' if required, then 'elapsed' is used to update the clock (and the clock is used to update the timers). This mean the spike-dislike need to be done only once in the class Time and not everywhere time is required (so, the spike-dislike in timer can be removed).\n- State-wise clock makes perfect sense. In facts, users should probably only uses this kind of clock, unless they have a really good reason to do otherwise. We could easily add an attribute 'clock' to states (likely in StateManager.add, unless we decide to add logic to Phaser.State) and update it just before the call to 'state.update()' in 'Game.update()' (unless preUpdates need an up-to-date time...). A nice side effect is that clock's timers events would be triggered just before the state update, which makes much more sense than \"before anything else\".\nAll this would make the use of several states much more practical. An example: suppose we have a game with an inventory and that opening the inventory pause the game. We can have a state for the game and an other for the inventory. When the inventory is open, the clock of the game just stops. As animations, tweens, etc. should be linked in some way to the state clock, so all this stops too. When the player leave the inventory, everything continues as before, just like nothing happened. Moreover, if the game state need to compare time points recorded before and after opening the inventory, this can be done in a consistent way. If later the game designer decide that time should not stop while in the inventory, they just need to have both states running in parallel and everything should work (well, when this will be supported).\n- It would be a good thing to find a wiser way to deal with problems due to too big elapsed time than just capping it. But I think this requires some deep changes in the main game loop, and it is hardly possible to do without breaking some stuff. E.g. if the physics require step not bigger than 1/30 s to stay stable an we have a frame of 1/10 s, a solution would be to update the game 3 times to keep in sync with real-world time without breaking the physics requirement. This basically means to switch to fixed time steps (see this: http://gafferongames.com/game-physics/fix-your-timestep/). But this is not the problem I try to address here so it is a bit out-of topic, we should discuss this elsewhere.\n- I disagree on the fact that events and callback can happen at any time. Phaser event's callbacks are called when Timer.update() is called. That is, when Time.update() is called: at very beginning of Game.update(). Unless I am missing something ?

This change is not correct. \nSoundConfig is used internally and for passing sound objects their configuration. \nAudioConfig is used for passing sound manager config to the game and should be defined as a separate type..

Even shorter, you can do this.audioExample.play({ delay: 0.5 });\nDelay is option only relevant to specific playback so it has to be passed to the play method and can not be set globally at the point of adding sound due to the way how it is handled under the hood..

As far as I can tell this is directly related to https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/issues/1903 \u2014 my code exhibits the weird behaviour when it cannot tell which button has been released to trigger the onInputUp event. Here's are two fiddles that show the difference:\n\n2.3.0 working as it should (click and drag the sprites) http://jsfiddle.net/n81thw2q/\n2.4.0-dev (onInputUp can't tell which button was released): http://jsfiddle.net/fpds924d/1/ \n. (the code is identical except for the usage of pointer.leftButton in 2.4.0-dev vs pointer.button == Phaser.Mouse.LEFT_BUTTON in 2.3.0)\n. correction: when I log pointer.isDown, i get \"true\". when I log pointer and expand it in the console, I get false.\n. ah, thanks!\n. Perhaps this was closed too early:\nthis.events.onInputUp.add(this.onMouseUp, this);\nthis.onMouseUp = function(object, pointer) {\n        console.log(pointer.leftButton);\n}\nLogs:\nfalse\nI realize that after the mouse has gone up no button is being pressed, but how can I read the button that was released to trigger the onInputUp event?\n. Perhaps I am misunderstanding you, but the pointer that's being passed to my handler does not have a pointer.event, let alone pointer.event.button\n. I think I just found a workaround: If I collect the active pointer's left/right/middleButton values every frame and then compare those stored values to the one in the pointer I'm being passed in the event handler, I can suss out which one(s) have changed. I'm not sure it's a clean solution (the added overhead from updating a few bools shouldn't matter, but I don't know if there is a chance that the timing could be such that the update function would already have set the button flag to false before the handler is started?)\nworkaround implemented with 2.4 rc1: http://jsfiddle.net/fpds924d/4/\n. update: this technique also works in my actual project.\n. update 2: it DOES happen from time to time that the global variables have already been updated when the event handler starts, so I occasionally get the weird and wrong behaviour, perhaps one in a hundred drag events.\nSo I'd still really appreciate an ironclad, built-in way to check which button triggered the onInputUp event, if such a thing is possible with the current system\n. further experimentation reveals that a separate browser event is dispatched for every released button, and the event.button property contains the button that was released (0, 1, 2 for LMB, RMB, MMB). so if you release two buttons at the same time, you get two events. event.buttons always seems to contain the current status of what's pressed and what's not, which in the case of a mouseup isn't very helpful. I think you shouldn't necessarily use the buttons bitmask for everything and the button property for nothing, and it doesn't sound like the 2.3 implementation was all wrong after all! The button property certainly shouldn't be removed, and the docs should be updated to reflect the actual contents of button vs buttons. \n. (at least, that's how it works in chrome.. IE is a whole different thing apparently?)\n. Cool! \nI still think you're underestimating the usefulness of event.button, especially for mouseUp, but it's exposed in the pointer and that's all I need ;) Thank you!\n. also, bulleted items are being rendered over the \"jump to\" box for some reason\n. This may be due to PolyK having trouble triangulating certain polygons. See also this thread: http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/15975-webgl-polygon-with-tiling-texture/\n. (here's the fiddle with earcut: http://jsfiddle.net/ofhw1vew/2/)\n. That isn't a good workaround because whether or not the poly is complex (ie drawn upside down) can vary from frame to frame (according to which method is used to build the polygon in the graphics renderer, as determined by WebGLGraphics.updateGraphics).\nHere's a fiddle where all I've done is removed the second vertex, thereby making the polygon renderable as simple, and the Y flip is now gone: http://jsfiddle.net/v3qdxhq0/\nIt's also not a practical workaround for when the graphics object is part of a group that is drawn to the renderTexture as a whole.\n. my workaround for the issue has been to raise the number of points a polygon can have before the renderer automatically assumes it's complex (and uses the stencil rendering function), and to swap out the PolyK triangulation for Earcut (which was hella easy), a more robust implementation that will return more valid triangulations (again resulting in less use of the stencil buffer).\n. Also, I just noticed\u2014it looks as if the sprite becomes slightly transparent when it's blurred and using NORMAL blend mode...\n. Please note that it's really just MULTIPLY that had trouble\u2014ADD and SCREEN worked with filters plus blend mode: http://jsfiddle.net/wvqbachu/\n. Correct me if I'm wrong, but that property was only there because the Rope class was created from the Tilesprite class template\n. ",

In fact the amount of layers should not matter at all as you should render them all on a single canvas/texture one on top of another (according to z). Imo the renderer should be rewriten. 8 layers is not the limit btw, there are games that use about 10-12 layers for effects etc. With the current renderer tilemaps are alsmost useless as they work only with 1-2 layers which in 90% cases is simply not enough. The render code should be rewriten - that's the only option to make tilemaps fast.\n. @lewster32 lol what? Here's a quick example how it should be done. The green square is between other squares as it's on the layer with z index of 1. If you want to move it, move the layer up/down.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/bxdcx651/1/\nImo the whole phaser render engine should be rewriten, coz now it's just ridiculous. For example every tilelayer creates a new canvas [!] and ofc when you have like 10 layers the fps drop is huge.\nhttp://docs.phaser.io/TilemapLayer.js.html#sunlight-1-line-43\netc. The logic should like \n1. global \"texture\" clear\n2. draw everything on it according to z-index\n3. post render stuff\nThat's it. As a result you'll be able to have almost as many layers/displayobjects as you want without fps drops.\n. @lewster32 im not saying that phaser nor pixi are bad. They are awesome, really. So many things out of the box (camera, loader, cache manager etc), all i'm saying that the tilemap related stuff is not written performance-wize. I would love to rewrite that (using the method i've described above, which i've already used in several core-js games and it proved to work flawless), but as i'm not the author of phaser, nor i've worked with pixi, i lack the architecture knowledge of these libs and btw there's no such information on the web. So i'm stuck with the tilemaps and as my current project is tile-related, i've got to choose whether to use phaser at all or not.\n. @hilts-vaughan ha! I use 4 layers and already got the 20 fps drop in firefox resulting in 40/60 fps with just moving the camera around the world\n. @lewster32 i do and i would love to rewrite the tilemaps, but there's no info on how does the internal phaser loop work. I already asked at the forum, but rich didn't respond. It might take weeks to just figure out the workflow of phaser in order to try changing it. I mean the life cycle of phaser and especially of the tick. Here's a nice example of laravel's workflow http://laravel-recipes.com/images/bootstrap1.jpg \n. Thanks for this awesome explanation. Now I see the issues clearly. As I've worked with canvas only so far, I can tell that the direct session switch would be a solid boost for canvas mode. I'll take my time to dig into this\n. By the way, @photonstorm, I've been working pretty close with p2 for the past 3 weeks now and I've made some fixes to the p2.world and some minor once to phaser's core, also i've extended the p2 core itself as it lacks some very useful methods like applying impulses, some constraint fixes etc. Those methods I ported from the c# box2d.

I find them easier to navigate.\n. javascript\nthis.game.scale.scaleMode = Phaser.ScaleManager.SHOW_ALL;\nthis.game.scale.setResizeCallback(this.reflow,this);\nthis.reflow() keeps the same native width and adapts the height to match the window aspect ratio like this:\njavascript\nthis.game.scale.setGameSize(this.game.width,this.game.width*window.screen.height/window.screen.width);\nThis is the tileset image: \n\nThere is no padding as you can see, though it never caused any bleeding before. \n. @pjbaron It is indeed 42x42. Here's the exact file that is on master right now https://www.dropbox.com/s/lk7v3cbwvil4q61/bgtiles.png?dl=0\n. \nThis is using freshly a freshly built phaser.js from the latest dev and the lines stay no matter how I resize the window. Sure enough disabling antialias fixes it here and on my game. \nI found this before creating the issue, while I googling to see if there was some error on how I created my image assets. Not sure if it'll be of any help. \n. The visual glith is gone, but the game freezes when I try to switch to a different game state. It only happens when switching from the game state with the tilemap to any other. \n\nPhaser version: 8c6fec0e978ec5c5e15d78649b58d4809d057160\n. Yeah I imagined it could've been that. I cherry picked your last commit(@pjbaron) ignoring the three added by Rich and everything worked fine. Thanks for the amazing work you're doing :)\n. And here's how it looks on 2.7.0 without the calls to layer.resize and layer.resizeWorld(note that the lava near the bottom is made of sprites and the dark background is a tilesprite). \n\n. I've tested again with the latest dev and I noticed that the tilemap layer scales up to the width and height originally defined when calling new Phaser.Game(...)\nThat is, if I call game.scale.setGameSize(newwidth, newheight) while the game is running and then do layer.resize(this.game.width, this.game.height) it won't work if the new game.width and/or game.height is larger than when phaser was initialized. This wasn't the case with 2.6.0. \nI've managed to work around the problem by initializing phaser with the same value for height than I use for width and then adjusting it to the real dimensions of the window. That way it works with ratios up to 1:1 \n. ",

I'll keep looking into it. \n. I can't replicate this outside of my existing app. I'll re-open once I'm certain this is a bug in Phaser or Pixi.\n. I can't replicate this outside of my existing app. I'll re-open once I'm certain this is a bug in Phaser or Pixi.\n. Hi Rich. Do you mean you create a fullscreen button which is a DOM element rather than using a button or sprite within the game to trigger startFullScreen? To clarify, chrome and firefox works as expected when calling startFullScreen from an onInputDown event. \n. Thanks for taking the time to look at this.\nOn Friday, September 5, 2014, Richard Davey notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nOk I've been playing with this a lot tonight and was partly right in my\ncomment above:\n1) Chrome / FF don't seem to care and will happily go fullscreen from a\nSignal, callback, etc.\n2) I cannot get IE11 to go fullscreen from anything other than a few\ndifferent types of dom objects. If I bind the call to a button or link it\nworks fine. But on a canvas object it just doesn't do anything for me. It's\nlike the click event needs to be on a specific type of dom object, but the\nfullscreen request works fine against the phaser canvas. I have tried\nkicking off fs mode even from within the _onMouseDown function in Mouse.js,\nwhich is the absolute first level called from the listener and it still\ndidn't work - which makes me think it tries to qualify the 'directness' of\nthe click event. If you can get it working, let me know, but I'm going to\nclose this off for now.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/issues/1098#issuecomment-54562593.\n.

Ah okay I see what you mean now. Ok, well I'll dig into it a little more anyway. Thanks\n. Ah okay I see what you mean now. Ok, well I'll dig into it a little more anyway. Thanks\n. I looked into this further this morning and I found the following line to be what was causing the issue:\n\nvar lineWidth = this.context.measureText(lines[i]).width + this.style.strokeThickness + this.padding.x;\nBy removing\nthis.style.strokeThickness\nfrom the line width calculation, the text appeared to be centered again.  So basically any text with stroke applied was appearing further to the left than it should when centered.\nMy game does have some custom scaling going on which could be causing this, so I will see if I can reproduce this on a basic example.\nUpdate: I appears the issue is caused by the strokeThickness being applied twice to the final calculated width.  Following the above lineWidth calculation, the strokeThickness is added again here on line 418 of text.js:\nvar width = maxLineWidth + this.style.strokeThickness;\n. You're right, my PR is a fix for a separate issue although it was the issue I was originally seeing, I just thought they were one in the same initially ;) I see you have created a new issue, thanks.\nAs you mentioned this bug is down to an implementation of the HTML5 Canvas Context measureText in browsers and is not easily fixed.  I'll do some more investigation.\nUpdate: Taking a quick look at the example I originally linked to, I realised that removing\nwordWrap: true, wordWrapWidth: sprite.width\nresults in the text being centered correctly.  \nBy changing line 376 of text.js from \nvar lineWidth = this.context.measureText(lines[i]).width + this.style.strokeThickness + this.padding.x;\nto\n```\nvar lineWidth = (this.context.measureText(lines[i]).width) + this.style.strokeThickness + this.padding.x;\nif(this.style.wordWrap) {\n   lineWidth  -= this.context.measureText(' ').width\n}\n```\nthe text remains centered with\nwordWrap: true, wordWrapWidth: sprite.width\n. This was indeed a bug in my own code. Long story short, I was calling destroy() on the emitter instance twice in quick succession. So the 2nd time around as expected this.game = null. \nSorry about that. Thanks for taking the time to take a look. \n. This one was specific to Desktop Chrome which has support for the fullscreen API  - on a Retina Macbook.

I know little about WebGL and Pixi's abilities to have multiple instances behave correctly. However, I'm a bit confused whether we're after a singleton or a global here. As long as there is one instance of Pixi, does it matter whether we reference it through a global variable or a local one? \nIn psuedo-ish code, is there a reason why the below, in principle, wouldn't work?\n``` js\nfunction factory(Pixi) {\n    var Phaser = {};\n    Phaser.PIXI = Pixi;\n// .. rest of Phaser source as it exists, using Phaser.PIXI to access Pixi\n\nreturn Phaser;\n\n}\n(function() {\n    var root = this; // in browser, this would be window\nif (typeof exports !== 'undefined') {\n    if (typeof module !== 'undefined' && module.exports) {\n        exports = module.exports = factory;\n    }\n    exports = factory;\n} else if (typeof define !== 'undefined' && define.amd) {\n    define(factory);\n} else {\n    // if we're just using globals, define Phaser as a global and use the global version of Pixi\n    root.Phaser = factory(root, root.PIXI);\n}\n\n}).call(this);\n```\nI'm probably missing something :smile: But as far as I can see the approach above should work fine with browser globals and just like we've been used to them, while at the same time allow users of CommonJS (Browserify) or AMD (RequireJS) to inject their own instance (both cache the results of require calls allowing the singleton pattern to be used just as easily). \nIn my eyes that we use a singleton of Pixi is a separate concern of how we reference it, and referencing through a global is something we should avoid at all costs because it hinders dependency injection and all the issues (especially in testing) that come with that.\nFor those curious: usage with Browserify is exactly why I extracted the phaser-unofficial npm package and it works very nicely :)\n@photonstorm if we don't find any problems with the above I'll do it properly and send a PR\n.

Indeed, that's also why our internal solution isn't a good general fix. What we do is always define a bounding box in a UI editor, and the alignment is always relative to that, irrespective of whether it's multiline text or not. Phaser, for the most part, supports this by setting the wordWrapWidth, but then the bounding box width is based on the longest line in the text. \nWhat I think might work, is adding a bounding size to the text, potentially overriding the wordWrapWidth, which will allow for single line and multiline alignment within a box of this width. I also understand if you feel this is not the best idea... having worked on a text implementation in a previous engine, I understand that this adds complexity to the usability. The main reason I feel this is a good feature is the moment you plug text implementations into some form of UI editor and localization systems, you often feel the need for some bounding box definition independent of the initial/visible text sizes.\n.

    "sompylasar": "@photonstorm Sorry for off-topic, but webpack is browserify-compatible and it allows much more than browserify: different module styles, async loading and livereload even in production out of the box, semi-automatic code splitting into chunks that load separately, many loaders for different web resources (you can require an image or a stylesheet) and more. Please take a look at it, it is very promising and works well.\n. > What is wrong with just standard JS when it comes to something as important as structure?\nThe only standard JS that tries to solve the dependency management problem is ES6 Modules which is not widely supported yet. Why not use a tool that helps to manage the structure and re-use thousands of existing modules now in a compatible and widely supported way?\nBefore webpack, browserify was the only tool that allowed to re-use node modules in the browser. It has several flaws which webpack gently resolves.\nThe cause of this issue with Phaser is that its distribution file is a concatenation of several parts, each bundled for the browser separately with its own way of internal dependency management. When this file runs directly in the browser, it works because all the parts export their entry points as different global variables. When this file is used as a CommonJS module (which is a primary method for browserify and webpack), it fails because the UMD snippets included into each part fall into providing entry points via module.exports which is the same for the whole file, so only the last assigned entry point wins. Moreover, several parts of Phaser use global variables without requiring them - this fails because in CommonJS mode of UMD the assignment to the global variables is skipped.\nI have just worked out a solution for webpack. Although it slightly patches the current Phaser distribution to fix inconsistent internal dependency management, it does this transparently during the build process without modifying the original sources.\nFor those who knows how to provide loaders for webpack:\njavascript\n    module: {\n        loaders: [\n            { test: /\\/phaser\\.js$/i, loader: \"phaser-webpack-loader\" },\n            { test: /\\/phaser-debug\\.js$/i, loader: \"phaser-debug-webpack-loader\" },\n            // ...\n        ]\n    },\n    resolveLoader: {\n        alias: {\n            \"phaser-webpack-loader\": path.join(__dirname, \"tools/phaser-webpack-loader\"),\n            \"phaser-debug-webpack-loader\": path.join(__dirname, \"tools/phaser-debug-webpack-loader\")\n        }\n    },\n    resolve: {\n        alias: {\n            \"phaser\": path.join(__dirname, \"node_modules/phaser/dist/phaser.js\"),\n            \"phaser-debug\": path.join(__dirname, \"node_modules/phaser-debug/dist/phaser-debug.js\"),\n            // ...\n        },\n        // ...\n    },\n``` javascript\n/* phaser-webpack-loader /\nmodule.exports = function(source) {\n    this.cacheable && this.cacheable();\n// Fix for `p2`, it replaces `Phaser` with itself in `module.exports` when in the same file.\nsource = source.replace(/\"object\"==typeof exports/, 'false');\n\n// Fix for `Phaser` to depend on `PIXI` exported before in the same file.\nsource = source.replace(/(var\\s+\\w+\\s*=\\s*)Phaser(\\s*\\|\\|\\s*\\{)/, 'var PIXI = exports.PIXI; $1Phaser$2');\n\n// Do not replace `module.exports` object, only put a property on `exports`.\nsource = source.replace(/typeof module !== 'undefined' && module\\.exports/g, \"false /* typeof module !== 'undefined' && module.exports */\");\n\n// Fix for Phaser node-webkit detection.\nsource = source.replace(/require\\('nw\\.gui'\\)/g, \"undefined /* require('nw.gui') */\");\n\n// Fix for missing `require` for `p2`.\nsource = source.replace(/(p2\\.Body\\.prototype)/, 'var Phaser = require(\"Phaser\").Phaser; var p2 = require(\"p2\"); $1');\n\n// Fix for direct reference to global `document`.

I'm planning to add basic game structure and workarounds for CocoonJS.

But I really appreciate the suggestion!\nCurrently I've got no access to my repo, but I'll be glad to share what I've done (I don't remember if I made it compatible with 2.3.x, but I was targeting the latest release as of the time I did this).\n. @the-simian Thanks for pointing to https://github.com/slushjs/slush , haven't heard about it before.\n. It's already half-concatenated half-browserified. The easiest is patching\nvia string replacement. The easiest is not the best. The best would be to\nNOT concat everything, but split and make the sources work in a\nCommonJS-only environment with NO global variables at all. Then make a\nbuild script that glues the modules together for the browser (via\nbrowserify or webpack) for someone who does not have a build step in their\napps.\n30.05.2015 5:25 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \"hollowdoor\" notifications@github.com\n\u043d\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043b:\n\nThe easiest would probably be to concat everything from the src folder\ninto a fresh module, but I don't know what order the dependencies are in.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/issues/1186#issuecomment-106976408\n.\n.

If what you're saying is true I'll need to modify the build.\n@hollowdoor I read your issue above. Hadn't run into that yet myself. Post here if you learn more precisely what is up. I'll need to fix my build. Looks like I'll be dipping into the node_modules and grabbing Phaser's \"doctored\" PIXI files... :(\nI will add though, that I did get errors when I did not use the right version number. The version of PIXI in Phaser is way, way behind. Makes sure of that, just to be on the safe side.\n. FYI, I can currently get Phaser to build by doing this:\nglobal.PIXI = require('pixi.js');\nglobal.p2 = require('p2');\nglobal.Phaser = require('phaser');\nIn this case, PIXI is set to version \n\"pixi.js\": \"2.2.x\",\nI will add, though that this no longer works in 2.4.3. because the CanvasPool mixin is not defined on PIXI. If you require the CanvasPool file in between PIXI and Phaser, of course, it mixies in correctly, and works.\nI'm aware that this involves setting some globals, which isn't ideal- but ti does allow you to use npm to serve all the modules.\nI'm going to update my slush generator with these changes as soon as 2.4.3 is on master\n. I noticed that the mixins you were using with PIXI were located in the utils directory. My question is, could we still use the npm version, as long as we mix in all the addons (like the CanvasPool). Are you actually changing the source code itself, currently - or are you modifying PIXI entirely by adding new properties?\nIf you're doing the latter, it could be possible to still use the npm PIXI and then just require a file you provide in the source that then mixes in all your modifications to PIXI. Of course, the same rules apply - you have to match the right version. I know PIXI is well into v3, but you are  (last I checked) locking pixi on v 2.2.8. This could be useful because that way you'd really only have to maintain the parts that deviate from pixi.js source. So to be clear, I am imagining that you could require pixi with npm, and then require a file that basically requires all the addons in the right order, and just plug all the functionality you need right in. You would have the latitude to update or replace existing methods if you needed to. If I knew more specifically the parts that deviate from PIXI I would be happy submit a PR that basically works this way. \nIf I'm way off, and this wouldn't work in your opinion, I'd like to know more. Any amount you can elaborate on what's different about this PIXI from the core pixi (of the same version) I'd love to know. \nIn the meantime, is the most correct file to include from the Phaser source for PIXI currently\nsrc/pixi/Pixi.js\nright? You'd still need the CanvasPool and stuff like that afterwards, I would assume.\nThank you for taking time to respond to all these issues, I really appreciate the work you're putting in on Phaser!\n. Thank you for responding so quickly!\nI will try this out as soon as possible\n. I saw this thread while browsing, and I realized I didn't know the answer either.

Thank you so much for responding!. @photonstorm ,thank you very much!

Reading there makes me thing this is 'unfixable' (maybe?) should I close this or keep it open @photonstorm ?\nI appreciate the followup. Might make sense to leave this open until then, and close it when that releases. I'll update my scaffold to use ScaleManager out of the box.

It's 787.7 kB minified FYI.\nTo tell you the truth I'd rather resolve system shims on my own so your version is fine.\nMaybe you should publish a scoped phaser to npm. Unless you have, and the readme reads wrong.\nI did try to install from the repo, but npm hanged on the install.\n. @konsumer \nOh freakin cool! I just did this with browserify, and babelify.

I still have an glimmer of hope phaser2 gets better module support in this main branch though.\n. I think I just figured out how to fix it. I feel sort of stupid. There are really only two problems.\n1. The requires in the build/phaser.js are browserified versions of modules so they need to be derequired.\n2. The check for require('ng.gui') needs to be something else like others said require.resolve('ng.gui').\nThat would probably get Phaser 95% working with whatever commonjs bundlers there are.\nAlso I don't understand how PIXI, and p2 are undefined in build/phaser.js when Phaser is a module, and running the same as a script link still works.\nBTW. I did derequire phaser.js, and replaced require('ng.gui') with require.resolve('ng.gui'), and it worked. :) I'm too lazy to start a fork.\n. @konsumer Though what you said is true I'm not sure what you're getting at.\nBTW there is a pixi.js file in the phaser/dist/modules folder that will fix this error TypeError: this.texture.baseTexture.dirty is not a function if you put that in your fork at https://github.com/notnullgames/phaser instead of var PIXI = require('pixi.js');. I believe dist is created by the grunt file as a prepublish so you have to get phaser/dist/modules/pixi.js from Phaser on npm. Unless you want to put module.exports in all those pixi files in src that is, or run that grunt file manually to get pixi out of it.\n. @konsumer Oh now I understand. Yeah. I was thinking in terms of the set up that photonstorm has right now. The clash is really a mind set. I had to pick up the pieces of my brain after trying to understand modules back in the day when I was studying python. Now that I do understand them I can't get enough of them. They're almost too easy. I'd like to see them work right in Phaser. Hopefully Phaser3 will do it right.

    "konsumer": "It worked on my trimmed fork, and it sounds like maybe others got it working. \n.

I just wanted a clean repo to use in other projects.\n. It's totally doable with just browserify, and doesn't require re-engineering, just tracking of internal/external deps, properly. Please see https://github.com/notnullgames/phaser\n. The thing about these libs that use this old monolithic use-script-tags approach is that they are fairly easy to convert to CommonJS. Basically they all monkey-patch a primary namespace, and since CommonJS uses a single cached object for requires, you just need the requires at the top. Very easy.\n. ",

If I have time over the holiday season I hope to address this and send a PR as an Xmas present to the Phaser community =)\n. @D34THWINGS I've gone back and forth on this for a long time and have dug into many threads on the topic. In short, @photonstorm has given the best answer available. As I understand it, the Phaser team has made so many modifications to their own custom fork of PIXI that it's essentially a different package at this point, and there is no browserify magick that will make the npm version of those two packages work together.\nYou can still use Phaser as an npm package, but just do it like this:\n1. Install Phaser as an npm package: npm install --save phaser\n2. from your project root, create a /static/vendor folder and add a symlink to your node_module:\n   phaser -> ../../node_modules/phaser\n3. In your index.html just inject Phaser into the global scope by pointing to the symlink:\n```\n  \n Have to include Phaser via script tag due to an incompatibility with Browserify \n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"static/dist/bundle.js\" defer></script>\n\n\n```\nThen you can just refer to the Phaser object anywhere in your application, and the browser will recognize it since it's part of the global scope. But since it's still just a package, you can avoid adding the source to your repo etc.\nGranted this approach is not aesthetically perfect, but speaking from experience it's a much better use of your time to simply punt on this issue for now and focus on building your game.\n. Shame, I am running into this issue too. ",
    "D34THWINGS": "Is anyone here can make a TL;DR on how to make it work with browserify. I read from the beginning but everything seems to be hacky. I saw instructions in the README for Webpack but doesn't help much for browserify. I already have a pretty huge stack built with browserify so i don't want to change my build system for the moment. The error i'm getting is:\nphaser.js:23083 Uncaught ReferenceError: PIXI is not defined\nIf someone explain it right, I'll make a PR to add to the README so that no-one will have to ask on this post anymore\n. I wish i made it to work with browserify-shiw but i just can't seem to find anything that works at all. I'll stick with the monkey-patch for now as i don't want to lost time with Phaser's wrong UMD definitions. I really love this framework but I find it so sad that the foundation of the framework, the dependency resolution is done so wrong. It could be easier for everyone to build their custom version of Phaser if every module was declared in UMD with proper resolution of dependencies. The best exemple I have for that is lodash. You just require the files you want in your build and that's it, no need for cloning and custom grunt task, it works with CommonJS/AMD/Window like a charm. I really want this to be in the v4.\n. @galarant i'd better stick with the window hack for now because if i include it in my index.html, i will have to do a custom task to copy Phaser somewhere in my build from the node_modules then modify the name file for cache busting purpose if phaser is updated and also replace the relative path to the file to an absolute path to my Akamai CDN like I do with every single assets i have, and that's kind of work i can't afford for now. As you said, i need to focus on making the game, thanks for the advices !\nThanks @photonstorm for your work and sorry for bringing back old issues from the dead. I did a lot of development in Node and built huge frontend webapps but never seen libraries without proper UMD, that's why it surprised me, but I understand that it's not top priority. The JavaScript scene has a huge churn and tools come and go really fast, that's truly annoying.\n. @hayesmaker I don't recompile Phaser each time since I marked it as external in my build. I have a second build for my vendors that I run only once at the start of my dev task and it works like a charm. That's how i do my dev build :\njs\nreturn browserify(options)\n    .transform('babelify')\n    .external(vendors);\nAnd for my vendors build :\njs\nreturn browserify()\n    .require(vendors);\n@konsumer when I was reading the thread i saw your fork and it was a great job but as you said it's outdated. And @photonstorm said that you shouldn't use the pixi.js repo since Phaser has a very custom version of PIXI, so the require of PIXI should also be relative. I think that the best way to achieve this is to fix the UMD. I'll try to make a POC this weekend on a fork. I think it could be more trivial than we think.\nHere's an example, thats how Phaser uses UMD at the moment:\n``` js\n(function (root) {\n    var Phaser = {};\n    // ... Phaser code goes here\nif (typeof exports !== 'undefined') {\n    if (typeof module !== 'undefined' && module.exports) {\n        exports = module.exports = Phaser;\n    }\n    exports.Phaser = Phaser;\n} else if (typeof define !== 'undefined' && define.amd) {\n    define('Phaser', (function() { return root.Phaser = Phaser; })() );\n} else {\n    root.Phaser = Phaser;\n}\n\nreturn Phaser;\n\n}).call(this);\n```\nBut the proper way to it is:\njs\n(function(root, factory) {\n  if (typeof define === 'function' && define.amd) {\n    define(['./pixi'], factory);\n  } else if (typeof exports === 'object') {\n    module.exports = factory(require('./pixi'));\n  } else {\n    root.Foo = factory(root.PIXI);\n  }\n}(this, function(PIXI) {\n  var Phaser = {};\n  // ... Phaser code goes here\n  return Phaser;\n}));\nUsing the factory pattern is way more efficient to handle dependencies for everything. And you don't have to do this on your own, there's some grunt and gulp plugins that can do that. You juste have to tell for each file what it depends on and everything will be wrapped up in the end so no pollution nor conflicts on the global scope can happen.\n. Also the UMD shouldn't wrap the whole code but each file so that each file can resolve dependencies on it's own. You will not have to change anything in the custom building feature since you'll have to concat all files in the right order because UMD wrapping doesn't solve the problem of defining order. The only thing that will change is the intro/outro that will no longer be required.\n. ",
    "lazd": "Sounds like Key.reset() is a good enough workaround for now.\nI ended up creating a moveDisabled variable and checking that in the game loop. There was less code (enabling/disabling two keys) and it was simple enough for my use case.\n. It's not a problem with desktop Chrome's touch emulation, it's rather stable. Unfortunately, I don't have an Android devices to confirm the bug from my end, can you try the test case on your Android device?\nI went ahead and implemented the behavior I desired with DOM events, and it's working nicely in both Chrome and iOS:\n``` js\n// Keyboard controls\nvar cursors = game.input.keyboard.createCursorKeys();\nvar jumpKey = game.input.keyboard.addKey(Phaser.Keyboard.SPACEBAR);\n// Create a group to house touch buttons\nvar buttons = game.add.group();\nbuttons.alpha = 0.33;\nbuttons.visible = true;\n// Configure button positions\nvar buttonXStart = 64;\nvar buttonXEnd = game.width - (64);\nvar buttonY = game.height - (64 + 32);\nvar buttonWidth = 96;\nvar buttonSpacing = buttonWidth + 32;\n// Add touch buttons\naddButton('button-left', buttonXStart, buttonY, function() {\n  cursors.left.isDown = true;\n}, function() {\n  cursors.left.isDown = false;\n});\naddButton('button-right', buttonXStart + buttonSpacing, buttonY, function() {\n  cursors.right.isDown = true;\n}, function() {\n  cursors.right.isDown = false;\n});\naddButton('button-circle', buttonXEnd - buttonWidth, buttonY, function() {\n  jumpKey.isDown = true;\n}, function() {\n  jumpKey.isDown = false;\n});\n// Listen for DOM touch events\ndocument.addEventListener('touchstart', function(event) {\n  for (var i = 0; i < event.touches.length; i++) {\n    var touch = event.touches[i];\n    var x = touch.clientX - game.canvas.offsetLeft;\n    var y = touch.clientY - game.canvas.offsetTop;\nonTouchStart(x, y, touch.identifier);\n\n}\n});\ndocument.addEventListener('touchend', function(event) {\n  for (var i = 0; i < event.changedTouches.length; i++) {\n    var touch = event.changedTouches[i];\n    var x = touch.clientX - game.canvas.offsetLeft;\n    var y = touch.clientY - game.canvas.offsetTop;\nonTouchEnd(x, y, touch.identifier);\n\n}\n});\nfunction onTouchEnd(x, y, touchID) {\n  for (var i = 0; i < buttons.children.length; i++) {\n    var button = buttons.children[i];\n    if (button.touchID === touchID) {\n      button.onUp();\n    }\n  }\n}\nfunction onTouchStart(x, y, touchID) {\n  for (var i = 0; i < buttons.children.length; i++) {\n    var button = buttons.children[i];\n    if (x > button.x - game.camera.x &&\n        x < button.x - game.camera.x + button.width &&\n        y > button.y - game.camera.y &&\n        y < button.y - game.camera.y + button.height) {\n      button.onDown();\n      button.touchID = touchID;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n. Also of note, when I use CocoonJS to test the application, the same performance problems happen in the WebView mode, but it's 60FPS solid in the Canvas/WebGL mode.\n. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like that's the case :(\nI've got a generation 3 iPad running iOS 8 12A4345d right here, and the results are curious to say the least. In the browser, it runs at 30fps. And I mean exactly 30fps, as if it's intentionally capped... Then, if the camera moves, it drops to 12fps.\nHowever, when I add the game to the home screen, it's a perfect 60fps. The second the camera moves, it drops to 6fps.\n~~I'm downloading the iOS8 GM seed right now and will report back if the results are different.~~ See results below.\nI observed something similar in a 3D game I'm developing that used canvas to render the HUD. I noticed that ANY canvas operation would result in a framerate of exactly 30fps -- even for my WebGL game running separately from the 2D canvas I was manipulating. The second I 2D canvas from the picture and did the HUD In WebGL, 60fps. This testing was on the same generation 3 iPad in iOS 8.\nEdit: I figured it might be wise to see what happens with WebGL. I'm getting flawless performance until the camera moves, and when it moves, less than 5 fps.

Could a possible fix be to draw the entire tilemap up front, then pan it around as the camera moves? We'll still have to draw it somewhere, though...\nCould we try drawing the tilemap with pixi.js? Is that possible?\n. @photonstorm, just added both WebGL and Canvas test results, see the original description.\n. @photonstorm, interesting, so is the issue I'm seeing here a known issue? Note that I only have 2 tile layers.\n. Alright, I'll keep my eyes peeled and will test as soon as it's ready, feel free to ask me to give it a test and I'll try it in my iOS devices here.\nWill this new approach apply to both Canvas and WebGL?\n.

There was a fairly recent PIXI update that made a good attempt to fix the problem of text rendering in slightly different positions on different browsers.  Previously I had to use a Y-offset correction for all text that was browser dependent.\nSee here for details:\nhttps://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js/commit/7c269137ceb8471dde25378d116c8dc3f7cacd31\n. The \".contains\" function got broken with this update.  Was there an intentional update here?\n. I've just checked the current dev branch and it behaves similarly broken as expected.  Tested with the following in the browser console with just PIXI loaded:\ntestEllipse = new PIXI.Ellipse(0, 0, 200, 100);\ntestEllipse.contains(0,0)\nSo, both libs seems to require a fix one way or another.  Would it be best to fix in PIXI first then import the mods into Phaser - that way alignment is maintained and both get fixed?\n. Ok, before reverting I'll test the old version properly, make sure it works in differing cases and not just my simple use where the ellipse xy position = 0.\n. Argh, I put this aside for a bit with the intention to see why PIXI was also doing this, I did a little digging then got sidetracked.  The fix I suggested (just reverting back) is fine but I did see that there is room for a little optimisation too.  I\u2019ve been running with the broken function overridden for now.\nI\u2019ll do it now.\n. Eh, this doesn't look right, it's only 1 files, I'll try again.\n. I don't think this is the right thing to do, for the following reasons:\n1. If the user purposely selects WEBGL then the library should use this.  The client code has every available resource under the sun to determine how well WEBGL is going work prior to instructing the library to use it, this determination shouldn't be fixed in the library.\n2. All selectable rending modes WEBGL/CANVAS/AUTO on my Lumia 920 running Windows Mobile 8.1 are working fine using the dev branch prior to this commit.  Whatever the problem encountered was it does not affect all mobile Windows devices.\nI'd suggest reverting this modification until it is known what proportion of the windows devices it affects, when a better informed decision can be made.\n. Calls to child.parent.removeFromHash() were added in response to issue #2232, I observed that this code could be called when child.parent was undefined causing a crash.\nIn my case the child was added to the group in Phaser.Particles.Arcade.Emitter.prototype.makeParticles().  At the bottom of this function the new particle being added doesn't have a parent but it does have a body, which are the requirements to subsequently crash.\nSo, I'm not saying there's particles in other groups being removed from hash, or that there's any problem in particular with the hash - I'm saying it's possible to hit the new code with child.parent == undefined.\n. Just checked again in case it was just my modified phaser build.  On stock dev phaser the problem shows itself on the 1st particles example.\n. Yup, that's a better question.  It's not clear looking at the commit history what area you were working in that might explain why this was added, so suspecting the fix wouldn't be as trivial as it seemed I left it.\nThe flag clearing was initialy added here on 8/5/2015: a1102d4d4d7b5d6ad268514625f86e11b6131e7c\nAnd then beefed up a few days later with a texture check here: 4aa22e22a1e45a5f990b8b40fe1fe00a5b5b8950\n. I also tried doing this yesterday, slimming down Phaser3 omitting some of the larger chunks I didn't want, such as tilemaps, physics, rendertexture, sounds, tilesprite, keyboard, gamepad, various file type loaders etc.\nAs you've found, sound dependency cannot be removed solely via the webpack config because SoundManagerCreator is required in core/game.js and referenced in scene/SceneManager.js:loadComplete().\nIn my test case I only had to knock out the Sound: require('./sound') from the webpack config and edit the two files mentions above to get it going without Phaser sounds, but now I have the headache of edited source files to keep intact with git updates.\nI think some chunks of the Phaser lib should be more easily excluded.  When their dependency is in the source code then some more of those conditional compile typedef's could do the job, just like CANVAS_RENDERER does.\nWhat I liked about PhaserV2 was the ability to override almost any functionality of the lib without touching it just by supplying replacement prototype functions..

I suppose the line is correct, however the recent change to directly emitParticles breaks the forced quantity emitting (I've used it to emit always certain amount of particles with frequency), thus the bug is a bit different than this \"fix\". \nHowever that said, I'm not familiar with the recent changes for timers if the Emitter works a bit differently regarding that.\n. I could not find any good reference regarding this, however further testing suggests that the play() call infact works, but throws the error and starts playback from currentTime=0 of the audio. Not very nice for audiosprites. Also the problem is that it sometimes works, any sometimes it just does that and barks at you.\nMight need some real \"work\" to get it working properly, possibly catch the error and retry later, dunno. As it turns out that when the error happens, you cannot even call stop() as it fails too.\n. I tried quick patch using the pendingPlayback (afair) but couldn't get it work straight away, as it wasn't ment to fix this kind of issues. Right now my solution is to disable audio with windows phone IE and/or if nothing else, have third layer of audio abstraction to not to use audiosprites but limited set of individual sounds with WP.\nI created abstraction audio manager to overcome audiosprite issues with IE. I categorize audio to named groups and group can consists any number of audiosprites. Interface a bit similar to tweens to configure playback parameters and choose named sound/marker which is then resolved to correct audiosprite instance. On Webaudio you can have one audiosprite, but on IE you have group sounds so that concurrency playback is spread across different audiosprites. Using multiple instances of same audiosprite caused tons of problems (IE doesn't cache loads, etc).\n.

    "pjbaron": "Using duration would defeat the purpose of the change and make it just a repetition of existing functionality.\nThis new property will be set when the key is pressed, and stay set until the user polls or resets it.  It is deliberately designed to reset when polled in order to save the user having to remember to reset it constantly... and although this means you can only use it once, I believe that is the major use case.\nThe reason for adding this slightly odd construction is to provide the often requested functionality of simple key down edge detection, in the easiest possible manner to access:\nhttp://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/10413-implementing-a-delay-in-a-title-screen/\neguneys answer to this question would be replaced entirely with this addition which does the same thing but internally and with the auto-reset.\nWith duration based functions, it is not obvious to me what duration to use in order to catch a key which has been pressed only since the previous time I checked for it without storing the time-stamp in an additional variable.

I also added a justUp counter part.\n\u2014Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Sorry fellas, had to sleep, back in the saddle again now.\nRich, the use case is if the dev wants to reduce 'new' object creation.  ie. if a game creates all key listeners once at the start and reuses them for different levels and game states.  This is how I would do it by default because I view the cost of 'new' as very high... habits picked up from years of C++ are hard to drop.\nIf the game changes level or some other state, you would want to clear the latch (thanks pnstickne, I'd forgotten the correct word for that) in case it is set from the prior state.\nIf the user is recreating the Key object every time the game state changes, that's providing a reset too, but it's an expensive one.\nPhaser generally seems to assume that it's ok to use new everywhere (and that recent change in tweening to allow reuse indicates that it's perhaps not entirely safe to Not use new everywhere).  So I guess you need to decide \"philosophically speaking\" how you want the design to progress.  I think that fixing the cases where it's not ok, and ensuring that future systems permit object reuse, would cater to both camps?\n. Ignore me.  Merging the changes back in I just noticed Key already has a reset function that resets everything.  Much cleaner.\nThe discussion about object reuse philosophy probably needs a thread somewhere.\n. Edited to remove Pete's address from public view :)\n. Lol thanks Rich... of course my address is on public view anyhow thanks to the Google Play store's wonderful idea that all games sellers have to list their addresses.  I just hope that people don't get so annoyed by the later levels in Hedgehog Cute that they start posting hate mail :)\n. Yes you're correct, the fixed time step will help with this... and the breakout example ball doesn't go fast enough to cause tunnelling if the desiredFps is set at 60 because all time steps are exactly 1/desiredFps so the speed would have to be extremely large.\nSkipped frames are another matter, and if you have a desiredFps of 60 and an actual fps of less than 30 it will almost certainly be constantly 'spiralling'.  This is bad, which is why there's a call-back to warn you and let you fix it.\nWhen the system spirals, all bets are off in regards to stability improvements from the fixed time step system... it's trying to catch up dropped frames and falling further behind each refresh so eventually (very quickly) it has no option but to throw away the dropped frames entirely.\n@Jack0815 (or anyone else who can reliably recreate this problem), could you please add in the callback to detect spiralling... don't handle it, just drop in a console.log message with the suggestedFps it comes back with?  Then run the breakout demo until you see one of these problems and take a look at the console to see if the message has appeared.\nI'll try to reproduce here but even my 6 year old laptop is capable of running these demos without breaking a sweat and I haven't got a debug browser on any of my tablets (I don't root them because I need to know what the end-user of my games is experiencing).  Maybe I can introduce some dead loops to increase the load...\n. BTW: if the system is already spiralling and you increase the desiredFps then you'll make it significantly worse.  Increasing to 120 means it will try to do two logic updates for every render update instead of one.  If the target system can't do one reliably there's no way it'll handle more...\n. I can't seem to get any effect like that even if I use the 'power saver' profile to reduce my maximum CPU power.  The bat flicker is caused by bounds checking I believe, and Rich found an easy fix, just change paddle.body.x to paddle.x which is probably how it should have been done in the first place (adjusting body directly is dubious in all physics systems).\n. Excellent, nice job Rich!\nNow we're pretty certain what the problem is, we just need to find a good solution!\n. Coming late (and poorly informed, and a little drunk) to this discussion (caveat emptor):\n- iirc updateTransform is local to the display object only, it doesn't traverse the parent tree\n- groups process individuals within themselves for various update stuff that might change their transform matrix\n- groups can be held within other groups (?) potentially causing complex and hard to trace update chains\nIf I'm correct in these three things then the most robust way to deal with the transforms is to process the entire display list, once per 'logic update', and in a single function call - basically what Rich said.  Anything else seems guaranteed to fail given appropriate circumstances (e.g. parent manipulation by children, especially in call-backs outside the usual update loop).\nIf the transforms can be changed by the render logic too, then the whole tree starting from any such altered parent needs to be updated again to ensure correct behaviour and display... but I can't think of a valid justification for render logic to adjust the transforms so perhaps it doesn't.\nI haven't had a chance to look at your new commit pnstickne (I'm still in Christmas vacation mode) but I've been following this thread and believe that there's really only one or two genuinely robust solutions to this problem so I'm throwing this out there for discussion in case you haven't already covered this ground :)\n. Bear in mind that that transform only gets updated when the render pass happens (through updateTransform) so it will not reflect any movements you have applied in the current frame.\nDate: Tue, 3 May 2016 15:57:07 -0700\nFrom: notifications@github.com\nTo: phaser@noreply.github.com\nCC: \nSubject: Re: [photonstorm/phaser]  Code improvement suggestion for angleBetween() method (#2463)\nHoly crap.

I have seen this effect when developing the Beam renderer for Lazer but only when using point sprites (GL_POINT with a texture applied).  It is visible in the 'point tile' demo for instance.  I was not able to track it down in that, but will give it another go for this new tile renderer (which uses GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP so I am surprised to encounter it again).\n@noidexe I have grabbed a copy of your tileset to experiment with from your message, can you please confirm that your tilesize is 42x42 (e.g. you didn't share a rescaled or modified version of your original tiles)?\n. Hi @noidexe I have just tried to recreate this in a very simple example but can't get the lines to appear.\nCould you please try the attached example (it's in the standard Phaser \"examples\" format, though I used your code mentioned above to resize dynamically as the window changes size) and let me know if you are able to cause it to happen?\ncheers,\nPete\ntiles bug test.zip\nEdit: make sure you grab the latest Phaser too as there have been many changes committed today!\n. Could be, but strange that I cannot recreate in a simple example.\n. Rich found the magic numbers, in my example use:\nfunction reflow() {\n    game.scale.setGameSize(800, 334.883);\n}\ngenerates lines on my system.\nI'll play around with rounding and the shader but it probably is bleeding.\n. Ok, so I tried both round and floor on source texture (UV) coordinates but neither fixed the lines.  However turning off anti-aliasing for the game did fix them (at that scale factor anyhow):\nvar game = new Phaser.Game(800, 600, Phaser.WEBGL, 'phaser-example', { preload: preload, create: create, update: update, render: render }, false, false);\nWith pixel art like this you probably want that turned off anyhow.  Let me know if it works for you!\n. Thanks for the reference, I did try applying the half-pixel correction they talk about there however with this code:\n        var uvl = (t.sx + 0.5) * iTextureWide;\n        var uvt = (t.sy + 0.5) * iTextureHigh; \nWe get this output:\n\nAs you can see, it fixes the lines on top, but adds lines underneath instead.\nWith the addition of this code:\n            buffer[ c + 10] = buffer[ c + 14] = uvl + (t.sw - 0.5) * iTextureWide;\n            buffer[ c + 7 ] = buffer[ c + 15] = uvt + (t.sh - 0.5) * iTextureHigh;\nWe get this output:\n\nWhich looks a little better but still has the lines underneath.\nHmm, but if we're chopping a half off both sides, maybe I should be reducing width/height by 1.0?\nI'll try that now...\n. Ok, that appears to work for this example, but for others with flipped tiles it causes problems (vertical lines at the edges when the tile is horizontally flipped).\nI need to experiment with the code, applying the correction at the last stage is not the best way to handle this, it should go into the glBatch buffer much earlier in the process.\nThanks for the link!\n. Ok, that change is now in dev branch.  Please report any other effects it might have - I've skimmed through the example projects and they look ok.\n.

    "neurofuzzy": "It's still bugged with that change. But, in this case it doesn't flicker - it is invisible except for the edge tiles (which are partially off-canvas).\nThe only thing I've gotten to work is simply commenting out context.globalCompositeOperation = 'copy'; and it works. In my particular case I do not have alpha.\nUPDATE: Sorry forgot to answer: Yes, it happens when I drag or the camera moves across the world. If the camera stays so that the top left of the canvas matches 0,0 in the world, it will appear correctly.\nBy the way, if you have an iPad, iPod Touch or iPhone, you can test and get the same results. I'm of course happy to test anything you throw my way!\n. According to the w3schools site, 'copy' will display the source image, ignoring the destination image. It would seem that's not what we want. Try the playground:\nhttp://www.w3schools.com/tags/playcanvas.asp?filename=playcanvas_globalcompop&preval=source-over\n. Okay, so I think this is a clipping issue, not a compositing issue. I do no t understand why, but if I set dy = 1 or dy = -1 right before the call to context.drawImage, the flickering stops. Of course, the scrolling breaks horribly, but for some reason when dy is 0 then it breaks.\n. ",

I'm not quite sure how the player manages to fall through the platform by more than OVERLAP_BIAS though (given their own deltaY should be accounted for).

What you think?\n. Oh man, it's broken again. :cry:\nRich, still interested in delivering this feature along with Phaser yet?\nIt may take a while for me to fix the conflicting changes this time, though. What you think?\n. Hey, Rich. I have been thinking of some stuff like this for quite a while now. The issue @ronami is bringing here really is a broader stuff and I think some decisions regarding that and how Phaser is structured must be taken into account now for future releases. I bet that refactoring Phaser's physics engines are good place to start\u2026\nNow, when he talks about Phaser being bound to 4 physics engines and stuff, what comes to my mind is something like this:\njs\n// Pseudo-code, excerpt from Phaser Physics module.\nfunction startSystem (system) {\n  if (system === Phaser.Physics.ARCADE) {\n    // ... do stuff ...\n  }\n  else if (system === Phaser.Physics.P2JS) {\n    // ... do stuff ...\n  }\n  else if (system === Phaser.Physics.NINJA) {\n    // ... do stuff ...\n  }\n  else if (system === Phaser.Physics.BOX2D) {\n    // ... do stuff ...\n  }\n}\nOk, we know that already by reading the source code\u2026 Also, I could pretend the expert and quote some stuff from the fabulous SOLID principles here. Yeah, they are relevant, but anyone can see that adding another if clause, so that a new, (ficticious) BOX3D engine could be supported from within Phaser is really a design flaw. And this code smell can be seen in other places too (e.g. Loader).\nNow, let's see that in another way. What must be done so, to add a new, built-in or custom, physics engine to Phaser, one could do something like this:\njs\nPhaser.Physics.registerSystem('WhatAWonderfulPhysicsWorld', ThatPhysicsModule);\nPhaser.Physics.startSystem('WhatAWonderfulPhysicsWorld');\nThat is, we could leave the necessary parts inside the modules themselves, as these should provide the required APIs to operate with Phaser, including the configuration parsing and the usual collision methods, for example.\nNow, I'll leave one last question for your thinking later. Why distribute all default physics engines along with Phaser itself? Well, I think that makes sense regarding the Arcade Physics module, as some parts of it are required by other features of Phaser (but not necessarily obligatory, right?), as well a good starting point to prototype games. Still, I think these should be shipped separately from the Phaser core, and even split from the codebase itself, moving them to their own repositories, so issues regarding them could be tracked there. And, maybe in a near future, those that rely on building systems to compile their games could do something like this (one can dream, right?):\n`` js\n// Again, pseudo-code.\nimport Phaser from 'vendor/phaser';\nimport ArcadePhysics from 'vendor/phaser-arcade-physics';\n// Of course, theimports could be HTMLscript` tags too.\n// ... boot code ...\nPhaser.Physics.registerSystem('ArcadePhysics', ArcadePhysics);\nPhaser.Physics.startSystem('ArcadePhysics');\n// ... in-game code ...\nthis.physics.enableBody(object, 'ArcadePhysics');\n``\n. @photonstorm,gameobjects/FactoryContainer.jsis leaking to the global scope. I'm trying a different project setup, using Webpack and importing Phaser 3 from the repository (as a Git submodule). My code works fine, however I see there's awindow.register` function declared.\n\nIf I modify the module placing a 'use strict' on the top, the \"undefined\" exception occurs.\n\n. The bug is still there, sorry. If the state class is not deriving from Phaser.State, it works fine, the console prints the right state key. The example code still fails, however.\nGlobalStateManager#add delegates to createStateFromFunction method, where the key parameter is [overwritten][0] \u2500 for some reason, the instantiated state still gets the default key.\n[0]: https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/b3a9b2bed83bd6c13fa6c503512c6b85ce54ae13/v3/src/state/GlobalStateManager.js#L228-L238. Good to know, thanks.. Actually, npm version is what you should be using before every npm publish. Running npm version will tag the repository and update the version field in package.json, no need for doing these manually \u2500 but don't use npm version major just yet because you'd be accidentally publishing Phaser 4 in the process :wink:\nAlso, check np or add these npm scripts.\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"publish:patch\": \"npm version patch && npm publish\",\n  \"publish:minor\": \"npm version minor && npm publish\"\n},. I know that. But, let's think, how other devs, especially the ones in charge of the above mentioned projects, deal with this? Do they consider master always unstable and disconsider the version tag altogether? Something else?\nPersonally, as I publish a package in npm myself, I only worry about this when it's time to hit another release, so I just run np minor/np patch in the terminal and it's done. But that's enough for my needs.\nBy the way, you could still tag the repository manually and run npm version from-git before publishing, but this is very error prone.\nPerhaps you should consider some other method for handling the version tag for you. Not that there's something wrong in what you've been doing until now, but you could improve that later.. I'll skip React because it is a beast of a project on its own, and Material Lite seems to be in maintenance mode, but I've found it continues on as \"Material Components for the web\", that employs a method akin to topic branches, a way of keeping master clean before merging back the finished changes. Also, Pixi is worth of mentioning too.\nNow, you're speaking on behalf of Phaser v2 (and CE) numbers. You should expect the npm numbers to raise after v3 because Phaser will perfectly be usable as a Node library \u2500 that's the goal, right?\nAgain, let me emphasize, you're doing nothing wrong, just different \u2500 as well numerous other projects. But by exploring what others do, you know, may present you a few alternatives which could help you later, as well define future contribution guidelines for everyone.\n. @photonstorm can you tell us a little about the MatterJS physics engine, which is now part of v3? Will Phaser use an embedded (custom) version of the library, or will it switch to the upstream version later, using it as a regular dependency?. You'll need to define both WEBGL_RENDERER and CANVAS_RENDERER booleans, somewhere in your app configuration, to enable either renderer for you game.\nI don't know how you'd do that in Meteor as I've never tried it myself. I know that for Webpack you'll face a similar problem, but you can solve it by adding webpack.DefinePlugin to define those two values in the configuration.\n. Sorry, but I can still see this warning in that and a few other examples too. I just tested the example \"Add Animation Event\" example, for comparison, from the Labs and also from a local copy I keep. Neither using the current build or a fresh build from master solves the issue.\nTested on Chrome 63 and Firefox 57. The warning on Firefox has some additional information:\nError: WebGL warning: enableVertexAttribArray: -1 is not a valid `index`. This value probably comes from a getAttribLocation() call, where this return value -1 means that the passed name didn't correspond to an active attribute in the specified program..

Hi thanks for the long reply, I have narrowed down to the problem with\nMacbook cooling design that is not effective at keeping low temperature\nunless the chassis or cover is left open for more ventilation and CPU turbo\nboost itself could be disable to prevent unwanted overheat. Having working\nas a laptop and PC repair, many laptops are facing the same issues with\nhigh temperature due to Intel i-cores bad design vs Atom or ARM, there is\nreally little we can do unless Apple has user define power management like\nin Windows have it for a long time.\nOn Wed, Aug 5, 2015 at 12:11 AM, dotContent notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nHi! I've been spending a bunch of time with this so I thought I'd step in\nand comment.\nPhaser's target FPS is 60 - it is not adjustable. But there are various\nthings you can do to reduce your framerate or target framerate.\nYou seem to be able to adjust a targetFPS at game.time.desiredFps. This\ndoesn't appear to adjust the actual framerate, so I'm assuming what it does\nis set the number of times it does the calculations to determine the state\nto render. I found that anything below 10 caused issues with interactivity\nfor me.\nYou can also disable rendering new frames entirely. Someone used this\noption to create an FPS limiter plugin at\nhttps://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-plugins/tree/master/SaveCPU ,\nhowever it doesn't work with the newest version of Phaser. See\nphotonstorm/phaser-plugins#10\nhttps://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-plugins/issues/10 for a hastily\nmade half solution to getting it work with the newest version. Your milage\nmay also vary with this one as well - I found that the framerate was much\nlower than it should have been. However, it did reduce CPU usage.\nHowever, I would not integrate either of these until you are sure you are\nusing phaser in a way that plays nice. I particularly found that using\nGraphics without caching them as textures really hurt my CPU usage. I've\nalso seen things about scaling up your game without antialiasing, not using\nor reducing text on the screen, reducing the number of objects your are\nrendering, and not using debug text at all to increase performance and\nreduce CPU usage. Use https://github.com/englercj/phaser-debug to get an\nidea of at what step your game is wasting the most CPU on.\nAlso, try different browsers. Each one handles both Canvas and OpenGL\ndifferently.\nEither way, I'm assuming what you mean by a \"heat problem that can't be\ncool[ed] with internal fans\" is that you crash. Your hardware should never\ncrash from overheating, especially laptops. If you are not getting a crash\nthen you aren't working outside of the specs that the hardware is designed\nfor OR you are having driver or hardware issues. In both cases I suggest\ntaking your computer in to be tested to make sure it is functioning\nproperly. Some advice: when you first get your computer, try burning it in\nwith stress tests and record the temperatures. If your peak temps differ\nfrom those initial ones at some point during your computer's life then\nsomething changed and you may need to get your computer checked out.\nSorry for the long reply!\nTL;DR: Can't change the target FPS, but there are things you can do to try\nto get better performance, and if you are overheating or you think your\ncomputer is getting too hot then you should take it in to get checked out.\nIf anyone has any more advice on reducing CPU usage and increasing Phaser\nperformance, please chime in! Also, if any of the advice I am giving isn't\ncorrect please call me out!\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/issues/1968#issuecomment-127661682\n.\n. @dotContent Not using any browsers but Electron that consumption lot of watts, e.g. 22w vs 11w.

We started looking into the Phaser core but it sounded complicated since we don't master yet the Phaser internal architecture.\nYou confirmed that it would be complicated to include due to the many internal change involved.\nUnfortunately, we already spent lot of time on this multi scale assets subject. So we'll just use a scale factor everywhere for the moment, but I hope you plan to add this in Phaser 3. I think it's really important for :\n- a UI framework, it will be way cleaner if there isn't a scale factor involved in each line of code (off topic, but I'd pay bucks for a simple UI framework : layout group, scroll container, list etc. I'm surprised that there isn't yet an UI framework for Pixijs/Phaser).\n- physics, at the moment if my scaled assets don't report the same size, it means that my simulation won't be the same. And I'll probably fight with gravity, force... multiplied again by this scale factor...\nThanks again to both of you for your hard work.\n.

The only real solution to this would be to make a copy of the data instead of using the current approach using a reference.\nI did play around without having to add a new method. The data used for collision (in arcade physics at least) is the left/top/right/bottom-properties in the Tile-class. If every instance of Tile has a reference to the TilemapLayer it belongs to it would be trivial to just do the calculation inside the get function of the properties. I opted against it in this PR as the Tile data is populated with the creation of the TileMap and not with the creation of the TilemapLayer and I didn't really want to re-structure too much of the code :).\n. Another approach to solve both problems described above would be to calculate the scaling of the TilemapLayer inside the arcade physics collision checks itself.

    "nkholski": "Thanks for the reply!\nComments on your notes:\n- Should be an easy fix.\n- I couldn't find any other solution. Is there any built-in way to initiate an selective render? The best would be to be able to re-render tiles within camera view that themselves have a property \"dirty\" set to true. I could of course add this function myself.\n- :-) It should probably be an object too, not an array.\n- My though was that sprites are more demanding than tiles, and that it wouldn't be such a performance boost. Shouldn't be to hard to add this. Don't know how to decide how many a few are though.\nHowever, before I do any more work on this I would like to hear from Rich if there is a chance that this could make it into core.\n. It's been a month since I initiated the pull request without any word from Rich, so I guess it wont be merged even if I improve it.\nWhen I find time I will try to add the feature to my plugin https://github.com/nkholski/phaser-tiled-extras instead.\n. Sorry if I sounded confrontative, didn't mean that. Happy to hear that it could make it into the core! I'll do my best to improve it. \nThe second point will be the most challenging. Is there any built-in way to re-render just single tiles? One idea is to make a method that re-renders all tiles with a certain gid (or gid within a given array of gids) within the camera view or specified area. Another is to make the method check tile properties and re-render tiles with \"dirty\" set to true. Both approaches could be supported within one method: methodName(area (Phaser.Rectangle / NULL = camera view), gid (string / array / NULL = only by property)). The method could also be used by putTile too instead of \"this.layers[layer].dirty = true;\", and perhaps elsewhere.\n. So, I did a couple of changes (and struggled a lot with Github, and learned to use \"npm test\" among other things):\n- It now uses time.physicsElapsedMS instead of time.now.\n- Instead of selective rendering I added a test if animated tiles is within camera view before setting layer.dirty to true.\n- map.animatedTiles is now an object instead of array.\n- I realized that tilelayer.update is called on all layers, and only one call per main loop is desired. To solve this I added boolean map.animatedTiles.updated that will be set to true by first layer update call per game loop. (tilemap.update is never called, which would be nicer otherwise)\nEverything works well in my tests.\nBTW: I'm a bit confused on how I should contribute to jsdocs since all configuration is done in Tiled, and Phaser would handle animations automatically. Also, with jsdocs, do you mean that I would edit a html-file in docs-folder?\n. I added a note about performance. Might be a bit too long, and since English is not my native language (I actually failed in English) it might need some improvement.\nSo, given that I will not try to add support of replacing animated tiles with sprites or selective rendering of tiles I guess I'm done for now.\nUsed live here: http://dev.niklasberg.se/phaser-tiled-extras/example/\n(I also changed a \"=\" to a \"+=\" which will help keeping animations in sync, and corrected a copy-paste misstake from Image to refer to TilemapLayer.) \n. Chrome 41.0.2272.89 (64-bit/Ubuntu)\nIs it fine even when the tilemap is scrolling? That's when the problems start for me.\n.

It's happens sometimes with one-way-collision-tiles.

When I know more I will post an issue or PR.\n. Ok. I didn't realize that there was an defined update function already. Thanks for the quick response anyway!\n. Couldn't resist trying to find a solution:\nthis.map.calculateFacesWithin(0,0,9,9, this.layer);\nMy whole tilemap in the example is 10x10 tiles and adding this to the code after resetting collision fixes the problem, so I guess adding something like this for the surrounding tiles to the resetCollision-method would fix it.. A temporary fix is to add this to your create-method:\nthis.sys.physicsManager = this.physics.world;. A temporary fix is to add this to your create-method:\nthis.sys.physicsManager = this.physics.world;. Thanks. At least animations and tweens have onComplete callbacks so I thought that would be true for audio too. I'll adjust my code!. I think callbacks in Phaser are clean and easy to read, especially when using arrow functions. Maybe I'm just lazy.\nThey are at least nothing like asynchronous callback hell with line after line with }) so I think the common criticism sparking promises, observables etc isn't relevant.\nIt's your decision of course and I'll happy follow what path phaser choose :-). There is no scale manager yet and there is no world in that sense. Phaser 3 is still being developed. I suggest slack or the forums for questions like this.. TypeScript is supported but just wasn't ready by the launch.. The original issue is solved by this.cameras.main.roundPixels = true; for me too, but it introduces a new one; everything shakes..

If you give me a hint I could fix them, or should I just leave it for you?. I reinstalled Phaser and it works now. I don't know if I made a mistake before or something was fixed, but the issue is gone. Sorry. Closing the issue.. Ok. Now I got it. I ran it in canvas-mode. Tint is still broken for canvas for the current github version. It works fine in WebGL though.. You add \nplatforms = this.physics.add.staticGroup();\nAnd I just add a group\nenemyGroup = this.add.group();\nI never seen staticGroup before. Maybe that's the correct way to do it? On the other hand adding support for collision with normal groups just add two lines of code.. Ok. I dug a little bit more. Everything works fine with isParent but something goes wrong because the group has no physics:\nhttps://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/master/src/physics/arcade/World.js#L1493\nI updated my PR to target groups without physics only. IDK if that's the right approach, but with this PR a normal group will be handled just like an object containing an array of collidable objects so the collision handler could just focus on the array.. It's probably related to the issue when zooming out described in this thread:\nhttp://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/37357-creating-minimap-as-second-camera-view/\n@samme created a codepen that demonstrates the issue within a mini-map:\nhttps://codepen.io/samme/pen/zjdgEm?editors=0010. I did some testing yesterday. For my test case camera position works fine when scaled up (haven't tried to set scale<1). However, I cant get it to work as expected by manipulating bounds. If you remember the Metroid clone I once did in Phaser two I had just one world map and tweened bounds for room transition. I need to test it a bit more to ensure I'm doing it right, and I'll update the example to test against.. The  updates conditioned by runChildUpdate is fired in preUpdate in Group.js. If it was done in the update-method the problem is probably solved.\nAlso, I changed the title from pools to groups because this should be an issue for all kind of groups.. Little late, but the issue is gone for me too. Thanks!. BTW it's tested. The bug made my Animated Tiles Plugin to break, but after the above fix makes it work as expected again without any changes in the plugin itself.. ",

However, it makes sense that Kindle Fire shouldn't have WebGL on Cordova/PhoneGap, because it uses the internal WebView (rather than chromium embedded in the apk like Crosswalk/Cocoon). On versions before 5 (Lolipop) the WebView was built into the Android OS and couldn't be modified (As of v5 it's an updateable component through GooglePlay). The WebView didn't start supporting WebGL until Android OS v5, so Kindle Fire's WebView couldn't support it (unless there's been a major Kindle update recently).\n.

Changing the way I add tiles to the LayerGroups from per row to per column (essentially swapping these lines - https://github.com/CrocoDillon/wdg_doodle/blob/master/priv/www/js/init.js#L523-L524) seems to fix the issue in FF. However in Chrome sometimes I still fall through the platforms.\n. Adding game.physics.arcade.sortDirection = Phaser.Physics.Arcade.SORT_NONE; seemed to have solved the issue. So I think there is a bug in the sorting. If I have time I can dig deeper.\nFor what it's worth, I did try Phaser 2.1 and 2.2 and they had the same issue.\n. Okay I think I found the issue (but I haven't tested this theory).\nOur groups consists of sprites with (platforms) and without (props like flowers) body. The sorting function doesn't take mixed groups into consideration by always returning -1 if either of the sprites don't have a body.\nIt would be better to sort non-body sprites to the either end of the array:\nif (!a.body || !b.body)\n{\n    return !a.body - !b.body; // ...or something more verbose :)\n}\nI would create a PR but I have my doubts about the use of sorting now. The collideHandler seems to be sorting the groups every time which would seem more expensive than just changing this break into a continue.\n. >   Arcade Physics has never supported mixed-Group collision\nMight be worth it to add this to the documentation :)\n+1 on the sorting once for platforms. I think you can optimize sorting a group of movable objects if you do it only once per frame instead of sorting it for every collision check within that frame. Unless this is already the case, I didn't look into it that much.\n. ",

Thanks! Pull request coming in a bit.\n. Pull request added here: https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/pull/1923\n. We are using webpack, so a simple html file wouldn't be enough. But I'll try to create a minimal example for this.\n. Here's a pull request of a simple webpack boilerplate. https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/pull/1924\nUsing the full Phaser bundle in the webpack boilerplate crashes with the same error for p2 as earlier for PIXI.\n. Not sure why the merge and previous process reference fix shows in the commit log. The changed files seems OK though. Please tell me if you want me to redo the pull request.\n. After my tests I can confirm that positioning works as expected. However, I'm seeing that transparency isn't handled correctly for cached sprites. I'll update the code for repro in a bit.\n. I had to fork and rebuild Phaser to get your latest changes to the test case (https://github.com/mkristo/phaser/commit/665e120655bd6cd1f2d50f6ced7ac32ed3fa8b42)\nTo reproduce, use the below code or visit http://codepen.io/anon/pen/JdweMQ\n```\n\n\n\n\nwindow.onload = function () {\n    var preload = function () {\n        this.game.load.crossOrigin = true;\n        this.game.load.image('logo', 'http://phaser.io/images/img.png');\n    };</p>\n<pre><code>var create = function () {\n    var mySprite = this.game.make.sprite(50, 50, \"logo\");\n    mySprite.position.x = 50;\n    mySprite.position.y = 50;\n\n    var myGroup = this.game.add.group();\n    myGroup.add(mySprite);\n    myGroup.cacheAsBitmap = true;\n\n    setInterval(function () {\n        myGroup.updateCache();\n    }, 1000);\n};\n\nvar game = new Phaser.Game(1024, 768, Phaser.CANVAS, '', {\n    preload: preload,\n    create: create\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>}\n\n\n\n\n```\nNotice the transparent edges of the Phaser logo get brighter and brighter.\n. Yes, it works great! Thanks!\n. I understand now. Yes, this makes much more sense.\nBut when installing Phaser 2.4.2 via npm it seems like PIXI is still bundled with (at least) the no-physics build. I think it would be desirable to provide the split up modules as well.\nAlso, we should probably update the Webpack boilerplate to require both PIXI and Phaser. I'd be happy to do this, but the PIXI module needs to be available before this is done.\n. I'm happy with the solution provided above. \n@photonstorm: Should I close the issue, or do you want it to be open?\n. ",

I have the sprites in the group on the stage and I add them with visible false. When I set the visible to true, it flashes first and then it shows correctly. Also the scale in the first frame is incorrect - it shows in original size and then goes to the right size. \nI've only seen this recently, because I didn't use Canvas mode before and I don't remember seeing it on WebGL. People are probably not reporting it, because I guess most of them use Auto mode, which usually goes to WebGL. But this one happens in Canvas mode  (tested on iPad and Chrome on Windows). By trying older versions I saw that 2.4.8 is still fine and the problem appears in 2.4.9.\nI also have a quite complex project that I am not allowed to publish. I'll see if I can make a simple project with the same issue.\n. When making the example, I found out that if I remove the game.time.desiredFps setting, the problem goes away. The example creates some hidden sprites and when you click on the game, the sprite near that position becomes visible. \nIf desiredFps is set to 30, sometimes the sprite is first drawn in original size and then resized. \nI believe this is the same problem as Nidre is having because in another place in my game when moving the sprite and setting it visible after the move it shows first on the previous location and then on the new location.\n```\nvar game = new Phaser.Game(800, 600, Phaser.CANVAS, '', { preload: preload, create: create });\nfunction preload() {\ngame.load.baseURL = 'http://examples.phaser.io/assets/';\ngame.load.crossOrigin = 'anonymous';\n\ngame.load.image('phaser', 'sprites/phaser-dude.png');\n\n}\nvar playfield;\nvar sprites = [];\nfunction create() {\n    game.time.desiredFps = 30;\nplayfield = new Phaser.Group(this.game);\nvar s = new Phaser.Sprite(game, 0, 0, 'phaser');\ns.width = 800;\ns.height = 600;\ns.inputEnabled = true;\ns.events.onInputDown.add(onClick, this);\nplayfield.addChild(s);\nfor (var j=0; j<10; j++)\n  for (var i=0; i<18; i++)\n  {\n      s = new Phaser.Sprite(game, i * 800/18, j * 600/10, 'phaser');\n      s.width = 10;\n      s.height = 20;\n      s.visible = false;\n      sprites.push(s);\n      playfield.addChild(s);\n  }\n\n}\nfunction onClick() {\n    var i = Math.floor(game.input.x * 18/800);\n    var j = Math.floor(game.input.y * 10/600);\n    sprites[j*18 + i].visible = true;\n}\n``\n. It works in 3.11, but not in dev - maybe it has something to do with the graphics pipeline change? I'll see if I can find something.. Please check Graphics.arc function. endAngle is changed there and that's why it is drawn incorrectly. I thinkendAngle -= startAngle;` line is there my mistake and should be deleted.. Great, I'll wait.. I've tested it and it still doesn't work. getBoundingClientRect() returns all zeros. Looks like it takes some time before it gets set, because later it shows correct values.. Here's my comment on this. I think you are looking at the wrong function for conversion to degrees.\nUse Phaser.Math.RAD_TO_DEG. Could there be a problem with the negative angles? I guess there should not be as angles can be negative, but you never know. Below the angles are changed to be positive.\nthis.beginPath();\n        this.moveTo(x + tl, y);\n        this.lineTo(x + width - tr, y);\n        this.arc(x + width - tr, y + tr, tr, 3*MATH_CONST.TAU, 2*Math.PI);\n        this.lineTo(x + width, y + height - br);\n        this.arc(x + width - br, y + height - br, br, 0, MATH_CONST.TAU);\n        this.lineTo(x + bl, y + height);\n        this.arc(x + bl, y + height - bl, bl, MATH_CONST.TAU, Math.PI);\n        this.lineTo(x, y + tl);\n        this.arc(x + tl, y + tl, tl, Math.PI, 3*MATH_CONST.TAU);\n        this.strokePath();. I've changed it, so I hope it's ok now. My guess is that disabling scissor test is not needed, because it is never disabled in the whole phaser.js source.. I've been trying to add some feature to the RenderTexture source and have also noticed (and probably fixed) that, but did not have time to test everything enough to make a pull request.\nBesides changing the line you mention, I think \nif (this.canvas)\n{\n    this.canvas.width = width;\n    this.canvas.height = height;\n}\nelse\n{\nhas to be changed to\nif (this.canvas)\n{\n    this.canvas.width = width;\n    this.canvas.height = height;\n}\nif (this.gl)\n{. I use it in the following way. I create one RT, save it as texture and prerender frames needed to display history for different games to that texture - one frame is usually made from a combination of images and some graphics objects.  This frames are then used to display the history to the user. When the history for one game changes, I just \"edit\" the specific frame (create a RT from that frame and redraw it). In that case I use only one texture for all the frames and can edit only the specific frame. And since the texture and frame do not change, none of the images using them need to be changed.\nI could create a RT and draw a new frame to it each time something needs to be changed, but in that case I would have to use one texture for each game or draw all the other history frames to it each time. And that texture would probably be a different instance each time something changed, so I would also have to change all the references in the images containing that texture.\nAs I see it this gives me way less work to do and is probably also faster than recreating everything from scratch each time one game's history changes.. Yes, I'm using it like atlas and need to change only the specific frame when I receive new data. I use it in different scenes and I don't have the existing RT instance available - only the texture and I haven't found a way to get it from the texture. . It creates a new RT, but the existing texture and frame are used, so if you edit it, the textures are updated and the gameobjects using them also.. Yes, that would probably be better.. I was thinking and changing it one way and another before making a pull request and then decided it for this way. It is a bit confusing, but I think that if you want rounded rectangle, then the corners should be rounded if you omit the parameter. But if you specify a parameter for at least one of the corners, then you have already set it as rounded and maybe you don't want others to be rounded - in that case you don't have to set all other parameters to 0. If it's too confusing, then we can make the default 20 in any case.. setDefaultStyles sets fill and stroke style that each Graphics object uses. I don't think default radius for one specific Graphics type should be there. Otherwise Ellipse's smoothness would probably also be there already. . ok, I'll add the check for w/h. I've checked a few examples and SCISSOR_TEST was always enabled at the start of the canvas draws. I also didn't find any disable command in the phaser.js. Is it necessary to enable it? I mean is it possible that it is not enabled?. ",

I still get it in 2.6.1 albeit not as frequent. I first had the setText outside of the phaser game loop but even after moving it into the game loop, it happens from time to time.. I have seen this as well in Phaser 2.4.1. If you set a tint on a bitmap text it may not change it's text when you call either the setter (.text) or the function (.setText). What you get is either the old text, a combination of old a new glyphs or the new text. Purging the glyphs doesn't help neither does resetting the tint after you have set the text (not even if you clear the tint before reapplying the tint value).\nPrerequisites:\nYou must have created the game with CANVAS as rendering mode (WEBGL always works). . It happens in 2.6.1 but only when you set the text more than once. That is, if you create the BitmapText with a text (say XX) and then you set it once to YY it works. However, setting the same BitmapText again to ZZ will sometimes work and sometimes fail (displaying YY or even a strange cropped character).. bitmapTextBug.zip\nOn each onUp-event I change the text to one of the defined in the array called _someTexts.\nSometimes it works but sometimes the text becomes a mess (for instance, 23.00 becomes 23.0. <= note the erroneous dot). This only happens in CANVAS-mode when a tint is applied.\nThe Phaser supplied is a build of 2.6.2 taken today from the GitHub repo and built using default settings.. Easy way to cause the error to occur is to just mouse over-and-out of the canvas element a couple of times..

    "JoeDuncko": "Hi! I've been spending a bunch of time with this so I thought I'd step in and comment.\nPhaser's target FPS is 60 - it is not adjustable. But there are various things you can do to reduce your framerate or target framerate.\nYou seem to be able to adjust a target FPS at game.time.desiredFps. This doesn't appear to adjust the actual framerate, so I'm assuming what it does is set the number of times it does the calculations to determine the state to render. I found that anything below 10 caused issues with interactivity for me.\nYou can also disable rendering new frames entirely. Someone used this option to create an FPS limiter plugin at https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-plugins/tree/master/SaveCPU , however it doesn't work with the newest version of Phaser. See https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-plugins/issues/10 for a hastily made half solution to getting it work with the newest version. Your milage may also vary with this one as well - I found that the framerate was much lower than it should have been. However, it did reduce CPU usage.\nHowever, I would not integrate either of these until you are sure you are using phaser in a way that plays nice. I particularly found that using Graphics without caching them as textures really hurt my CPU usage. I've also seen things about scaling up your game without antialiasing, not using or reducing text on the screen, reducing the number of objects your are rendering, and not using debug text at all to increase performance and reduce CPU usage. Use https://github.com/englercj/phaser-debug to get an idea of at what step your game is wasting the most CPU on.\nAlso, try different browsers. Each one handles both Canvas and OpenGL differently.\nEither way, I'm assuming what you mean by a \"heat problem that can't be cool[ed] with internal fans\" is that you crash. Your hardware should never crash from overheating, especially laptops. If you are not getting a crash then you aren't working outside of the specs that the hardware is designed for OR you are having driver or hardware issues. In both cases I suggest taking your computer in to be tested to make sure it is functioning properly. Some advice: when you first get your computer, try burning it in with stress tests and record the temperatures. If your peak temps differ from those initial ones at some point during your computer's life then something changed and you may need to get your computer checked out.\nSorry for the long reply!\nTL;DR: Can't change the target FPS, but there are things you can do to try to get better performance, and if you are overheating or you think your computer is getting too hot then you should take it in to get checked out.\nIf anyone has any more advice on reducing CPU usage and increasing Phaser performance, please chime in! Also, if any of the advice I am giving isn't correct please call me out!\n. Thanks for the idea @photonstorm! I didn't think to try setTimeout to set the FPS!\n. ",

    "bvargish": "Hmmm... I'm not sure how your audio loading mechanism works so I'm not sure how to answer that. What I'm encountering in IE11 is that some sounds start loading, fail for some unknown reason so a key is never generated. This mostly happens with larger sounds. I know IE is flaky with M4As, so I tried all MP3s and get less fails but still some.\nWhen I try to play these aborted sounds later I get an error. I thought maybe there would be some way to still generate the key so that the sound is loaded on the fly rather than the key not being found. Does that make sense? Another idea would be to add a \"try again\" mechanism to the preloader for sounds that abort prematurely. \n. This is curious. Using the Fiddler web debugger it appears that there are multiple requests for the failed sounds already?\n\n. Understood. Thank you for explaining this to me.\n. I'm reopening this as bug, because if I use createjs (preloadjs and soundjs) to play my sounds instead of Phaser, I do not have any issues in IE11. All sounds load and play fine.\n. Once the game launches I will provide the test case. Hopefully that will be soon.\n. I stand corrected! Once I added more sounds the file load errors started showing up. Such a fool was I to think that it wasn't the ever craptacular IE's fault! Sorry for jumping the gun!\nIf I devise a strategy to deal with this issue and provide some sort of fallback (if even possible) I will post my findings to the other forum. Already I think I minimized the issue by loading the largest sounds first. Sounds aren't failing until 95% of my game is loaded now. Sometimes they all load. If I load all my sounds with listeners first then I shouldn't have to worry about issues there so the issue will be further minimized.\nThanks again for your time!\n.

In changing the order of the sounds, it changes the sounds that bomb, so it doesn't seem specific to certain sounds.\nTo play sounds I'm now calling a function that checks game.cache.checkSoundKey(key). If that fails, I'm using howler.js to play the sound on the fly. This only works sometimes. Maybe it's an issue with that library, but more than likely it's an issue with IE. This was the sort of fallback I was initially suggesting as a new feature. A play a non-preloaded sound on the fly mechanism.\n.

Since its kind of related I also fixed the issue with setting cacheAsBitmap = true on a mask. Issue is posted here: https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/issues/2152\n. I should add that this was kind of a surgical fix to the problem, I can imagine the rabbit hole is much deeper and might require some rewriting of Pixi to fix the underlying issue.\n. Not able to reproduce it, neither in the phaser example or your jsbin. Hmm, chrome version? \n. Weird stuff, especially if it's mac specific. I should note that whenever I do a \"right click\" I will get the Chrome dropdown menu (save picture as... etc ) But it does register the click within Phaser either way. Tried all versions of phaser from 2.0.0 to 2.4.4 and I have not noticed it even once.\nMaybe you can try on a Windows setup just to confirm ? My version of Chrome is : 47.0.2526.106 ( same as yourself )\n.  Thex, y, width, height parameters in Phaser actually is the destination parameters. No parameters are set for the source since this is automatically found in the source object you give it.\nSo to clarify :\ndraw(source, x, y, width, height, blendMode, roundPx)\nCould be thought of as the same as:\ndraw(source, dx, dy, dw, dh, blendMode, roundPx)\n. Group.z is a read-only property that has no side effects.( I agree its confusing )  If you want to swap the order of groups you will have to use it's parent object ( which would be game.world if nothing else is specified ):\n```\nvar group1 = this.add.group();\nthis.world.bringToTop(group1);\ngroup1.add(new Phaser.Sprite(this,0,0, 'mysprite'));\nvar group2 = this.add.group();\nthis.world.bringToTop(group2); // group 2 is now rendered ontop\ngroup2.add(new Phaser.Sprite(this,50,50, 'mysprite'));\n``\n. It achives nothing and setting it might even lead to errors. This is true for Sprites, text etc aswell, so its a consistant thing. The parent is the \"manager\" of children z values using functions likebringToTop(c)`\nThat example is either old or just a bad example to begin with : p\n.  But isnt this weird having to do it like that though ? I'm thinking its logical for loadUpdate to be updated for every \"tick\" , it going to 100 is also an update so to say. Having to do this kind of work-around would be nice to avoid !\n. Nice catch. You should do a PR :+1: \n. Easiest way to solve this if it's urgent would be to just downgrade Phaser to the version where you didn't have any issues with smooth tweens. There are so many factors at play here that it's very hard to even start debugging it. \nI suggest you make simple demo that demonstrates this specific issue you're having, this makes it so much more likely for people here or even Rich to look into it :) \nAlso:\nWhat version of Phaser did you use when you didn't have this problem?\nSomething worth trying if you havent already:\ngame.tweens.frameBased = true;\n. Glad to hear :+1:\n. The webpack documentation might be outdated. This should work however using webpack expose loader.\nWebpack config:\n```\nvar phaserModulePath = path.join(__dirname, '/node_modules/phaser/');\nmodule.exports = {\n    ...\n    module: {\n        loaders: [\n            { test: /pixi.js/, loader: 'expose?PIXI' },\n            { test: /phaser-split.js$/, loader: 'expose?Phaser' },\n            { test: /p2.js/, loader: 'expose?p2' },\n        ]\n    },\n    resolve: {\n        alias: {\n            'phaser': path.join(phaserModulePath, 'build/custom/phaser-split.js'),\n            'pixi': path.join(phaserModulePath, 'build/custom/pixi.js'),\n            'p2': path.join(phaserModulePath, 'build/custom/p2.js')\n    }\n}\n...\n\n}\n```\n. Hey. Looked at your last example and I'm only able to recreate the jitterness if roundPixels is set to True.  It also seem to happen regardless of camera movement, but less noticeable. Otherwise it works here. Probably some kind of rounding issue in WEBGL ?\n. @Dillybob92  Indeed. Seems like the pixels dosnt get rounded properly when the sprite is rotated. Edited your example abit to further demonstrate this: https://jsfiddle.net/7LLqnxw1/28/\n. @Dillybob92 I think what we are seeing here is that when using 'roundPixels = true' , the vertices are just stripped of fractions not caring about how approximate it is to it's closest integer.  Which means that the verticies are not coordinated in finding the right pixel to snap to, hence the wobble effect. Improving this  might be a huge performance hit to the rendering part. \nMy suggestion is to have roundPixels always be false in WEBGL and just make sure the data supplied to the renderer is a whole number. Maybe the physics engine should take this into account ? Idk. This is far beyond my abilites to even suggest.\n. ",

To fix, I'm listening for 'touchstart', storing the time and position, and then checking that in the 'touchend' event to see whether it's less than a certain threshold. \nhttps://github.com/mattdesl/codevember/blob/25512f80a0aea27131b959a9ebd99f85456dfd03/src/30.js#L110-L115\n.

    "mattstyles": "@benwiley4000 you're including pixi, it should be pixi.js. although that wont solve the problem, you dont need to include Pixi, Phaser has its own customised version.\nActually, scrap that, I cant get it to work either via npm and browserify either.\n. I'm trying to have a quick look at making Phaser work with browserify and have all the dependencies for my projects in one place as it would work better with the rest of my toolchain but I think Rich and other have already intimated that it is not a trivial fix to support CJS modules. Not sure if Lazer is already set up to support CJS or not.\nJust out of interest can you confirm that including Phaser like this works for you:\nwindow.PIXI = require( 'phaser/build/custom/pixi' )\nwindow.p2 = require( 'phaser/build/custom/p2' )\nwindow.Phaser = require( 'phaser/build/custom/phaser-split' )\nIt's hardly using modules properly but might get you going in the short term.\nIt seems to be working just fine for me like this, next step will be adding aliases and stuff to make this a little easier.\nI'm still going to poke around to see if it can be made a little nicer.\n. I'd say you could add a caveat in there about not fighting with CJS stuff and just include Phaser as a global, and use browserify-shim if you like to require( 'Phaser' ) in your code, but, honestly, the explanation is wordy enough. I'm not sure you should add another paragraph explaining how to use globals with browserify, thats up for users to work out from the browserify end.\n. Is this related?\nLooks like maybe there is an issue somewhere before [ScaleManager.getParentBounds](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/v2.4.7/src/core/ScaleManager.js#L1415) gets called,this.boundingParentis undefined so it uses thevisualBounds` instead.\n.

    "stoneman1": "Already investigating it. Might prove to be too much for me, but I am trying to figure out this thing :)\nHere is some data I found so far : \n\n\n\n\nSeems like the PIXI is using wrong glcontextid there\n. I thought it was about the baseTextures not clearing up correctly on sprites when I found out that when I create sprites with group.create(0,0,BMD) and removing them with group.removeAll(true,true) does not actually free them. Checked with webgl inspector.. Should try to destroy those bitmapdatas also if that helps.. This should be fixed asap. :) \n. what about adding this to the destroy.js? \n        if (this.key.type == 13) {\n            this.key.destroy();\n        }\n. Not really a bug.. The thing is when its done loading it does not perform loadUpdate but it does perform loadCompleted. So the last % and so on can be read on the loadCompleted function\nAdded a fiddle for you : \nhttp://jsfiddle.net/y52hzaLo/1/\n. Thanks for this :) Did not have the time to figure it out yet :)\n. I think I did it as you wished, but not sure :) Check this out #2585 \n. You are setting this.game.width and height directly.\nIn the docs it says :\nDo not modify this property directly: use Phaser.ScaleManager#setGameSize - eg. game.scale.setGameSize(width, height) - instead.\n. Not very hard to implement to the loader. \nDo we want to add this? Should it be for the whole loader or specific file? If for file then we need to make a check for withCredentials property on the file object. If for whole loader we probably should add property withCredentials.\nhttps://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/master/src/loader/Loader.js#L2336 \nThere is the xhrLoad function which should be edited to check those things.\nI can do this if we want this to be done.\n. So every load function needs a new parameter. Lets say that you want to load a image then you would use load.image(key, url, overwrite, {withCredentials: true}) and then you just check that property from the file in the xhrLoad function. Not too much of work really. Just waiting for other people to comment if this is something we want and how we want to do it :)\n. Thank you \ud83d\udc4d . ",

    "jackfreak": "Excellent, thanks!, I'm still new to all things related to git.\n. I have the same issue, I've been bouncing my head against the wall about this.\nI'll roll back to an older version of Phaser (Im using 2.6.2) to see if this keeps happening or it's a bug of this last version.\n. I was banging my head around this too. \nFor anyone having this issue, I found https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Input.Keyboard.KeyboardPlugin.html#resetKeys__anchor \nListening for the Phaser.Scenes.Events.PAUSE event in the scene, and then calling resetKeys() in the event handler seems to do the trick. . After writing this, I noticed another bug (actually part of the same thing). The objects with tile ids 10 and 12 were not showing up.  I assume because of the way Phaser.Tilemaps.ImageCollection#containsImageIndex() calculates the range to return if the imageIndex belongs to that collection or not.\nCurrently it says:\njs\n containsImageIndex: function (imageIndex)\n    {\n        return (imageIndex >= this.firstgid && imageIndex < (this.firstgid + this.total));\n    },\nthis.total in the example above would be 7, but the actual range of internal ids is different, it's is equal to the maximum tile id  + 1, in our case it would be 12 + 1.\nIt should be like this: \n```js\n /\n     * Returns true if and only if this image collection contains the given image index.\n     \n     * @method Phaser.Tilemaps.ImageCollection#containsImageIndex\n     * @since 3.0.0\n     \n     * @param {integer} imageIndex - The image index to search for.\n     \n     * @return {boolean} True if this Image Collection contains the given index.\n     /\n    containsImageIndex: function (imageIndex)\n    {\n        return (imageIndex >= this.firstgid && imageIndex < (this.firstgid + this.maxId + 1));\n    },\n````\nWhere this.maxId is the maximum value of all the tile id's in the collection. \nmaxId could be set from within ParseTilesets, or calculated in Phaser.Tilemaps.ImageCollection#addImage in which case we will need to pass the tile id also.\nI tested it in Phaser.Tilemaps.Parsers.Tiled.ParseTilesets and it worked:\n```js\n            var newCollection = new ImageCollection(set.name, set.firstgid, set.tilewidth,\n                set.tileheight, set.margin, set.spacing, set.properties);\n        var maxId = 0;\n\n        for (t = 0; t < set.tiles.length; t++)\n        {\n            var tile = set.tiles[t];\n\n            var image = tile.image;\n            var tileId = parseInt(tile.id, 10);\n            var gid = set.firstgid + tileId;\n            newCollection.addImage(gid, image);\n\n            maxId = Math.max(tileId, maxId);\n        }\n\n        newCollection.maxId = maxId;\n\n```\n.

    "cchartr": "I second the issue raising, but not the solution.\ntilemap.objects is really a JavaScript object which maps object groups (or object layers, or object arrays) using their names for keys. Therefore in your example, tilemap.objects has a member object only because that's the name you gave to your object group.\nIn fact, now that Tilemap.objects is an object and not an array, I'd suggest the method Tilemap.getObjectIndex() be stripped altogether. Or make it retrieve an object's index from within an object group, but that would require two arguments : the object name and the object group name. Anyway in the current state of things, that method is irrelevant.\n. ",

If it's continues like this, there's no way to make my project with phaser (but I'm really loving work with). Please, fix it soon as possible.\n. Actually, the problem is not just lagging, but the camera completely stops. And this happens specifically when running mobile. So I thought it would be good to open a new issue report.\n. So do mine\n. I'm using phaser 2.4.4, android lollipop\n. Hmmmm... I'm almost sure I was using WebGL. But I think Canvas it's not as fast as WebGl, specially when running with Cordova in a mobile device. \n. Well, I think that maybe you could use a kind of aggregation, inserting your components into the prototype of your constructors functions. Remember that \"classes\" in javascript are not classes, so they are very flexible. Here's a sketch:\n``` javascript\nfunction Tower(args)\n{\n    //Constructor\nthis.doWhatTowersDo = function()\n{\n\n}\n\n}\nfunction addComponent(funcConstructor, funcBehavior, name)\n{\n    funcConstructor.prototype[name] = funcBehavior;\n}\nfunction defend()\n{\n    //bla bla bla \n}\naddComponent(Tower, defend, \"defend\");\n```\nAre you talking about something like this but controlled by the game object or even by the Phaser object?\n``` javascript\nPhaser.defineComponent(name, componet)\n{\n    //do boring verifications\nPhaser.Components[name] = function() //construtor function\n{\n    (componet.create()).bind(this);\n    update = componet.update;\n\n    //etc...\n}\n\n}\n```\n.

Phaser uses this internally\nIt seems I will have to write code to test if it is browser or cordova, and use 'Media' or 'Audio' respectively.\n. I was wrong, 'new Audio' is supported in old Android versions. The issue ended up being due to file access permissions in Android+Cordova, nothing to do with Phaser.\n. After looking at the code, making this change will also affect fireAtPointer, fireAtSprite, and fireAtXY, which is a good thing and makes for consistent behavior.\n.

What the bars currently look like\n\nAs the sprites health depletes the bar's color will turn from green -> yellow -> red\n. True it's not the most difficult thing ever, but I think that would make it a perfect candidate for a default plugin. It would provide a well-coded example for beginners to learn from, and a more feature rich bar than what the average person would make on their own. It would make it so everyone can do things like having colors that change upon the progress, using an outline sprite, shrinking the bar in different directions, using rounded rectangles or images, text overlay, etc. \nAlso, Math.sign and Math.abs are very simple functions, but JS provides these for free to improve code readability and to preemptively squish bugs for its users. If millions of people code in JS, some of them will mess up these simple things if they had to implement it themselves. Same goes for a progress bar. I've spent an embarrassing amount of time trying to get this one right, and I'm still not finished with it. I believe there's twice as much need for it, as the current most widely used solution, this repo, does not extend Phaser.Group. This makes the code overly complicated: it re-implements a lot of stuff like setPosition or isFixedToCamera, that Phaser.Group gives you for free (and I don't think it is maintained any more). I think Phaser users want to make games, not health bars. And I think there would be more demand for it than the current included plugin, Phaser.Weapon (which is an awesome BTW).\n. Since this hasn't gotten much interest, I think I'll submit a request to a plugin repo, or perhaps work on a UI related repo\n.

I'm not sure of any way to implement this tho, without reading the code more.\nI can update weapon's docs in PR https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/pull/2730. \nSide question.

Can I ask what you mean by this - how do you keep the bullets viable across state change?\n\nI have a single instance, in a global (non-State) location, and just clear-down the bullets group on each state change...\n\nAlso, how do you manage having a ton of guns? Where each enemy has a gun, and the player could have a dual, tri, quad, etc shot weapon? I can imagine setting up a class specifically to manage Weapon pooling, and then just assigning multiple guns where a dual shot is needed?\n.

I suspect the issue may have been on the Cordova side (maybe the whitelist plugin?).\nIn the meanwhile, I ended up using plain XHR and AudioContext -- which worked regardless of the version of Cordova (and on both iOS 8+ and Android 5+).\n. @photonstorm The wkwebview-engine-localhost plugin should make this issue moot.  It adds a background http server, so resources like audio should load properly regardless of Cordova file:// loading issues.  It also brings with it the cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine plugin, which is great for rendering performance.  It would be great if a note could be added to the docs with this information.\n.

(Impact is also a paid project and so the people who work on that get compensated for their time working on docs.) One of the things that I do when evaluating a new library or framework is do a thorough documentation review. It's standard due diligence and I highly recommend that if underdocumented code is a turnoff to you, you should base your decisions in using a framework primarily on the state of the documentation.\nI also agree that the way you put your request could've been much nicer. You're not a customer. You're not entitled to anything. You're taking advantage of volunteer time and labor here. The ideal response would have been a pull request with some example code that could be merged directly into the documentation. That way, the maintainers would have a framework they could use in the future for adding similar documentation to other functions.\n. Just want to clarify that I'm not a Phaser contributor in any way! But I've used Phaser and Impact and I run a lot of open source projects myself and I care about good documentation and good PRs.\nAnd asking for proper documentation is 100% okay!

This is not bug as description of setSize method in Body.js in Arcade physics says (https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/master/src/physics/arcade/Body.js#L1038):\njavascript\n    * @method Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body#setSize\n    * @param {number} width - The width of the Body.\n    * @param {number} height - The height of the Body.\n    * @param {number} [offsetX] - The X offset of the Body from the top-left of the Sprites texture.\n    * @param {number} [offsetY] - The Y offset of the Body from the top-left of the Sprites texture.\n    */\n    setSize: function (width, height, offsetX, offsetY) {\nOffset is measured from top left of the sprite.

As second possibility, I would make all frames of the same size at least within every animation. then you have to set size only when changing animation.

Code was looking for top lef corner of sprite and then offseting from it:\njavascript\n        this.position.x = (this.sprite.world.x - (this.sprite.anchor.x * this.width)) + this.offset.x;\n        this.position.y = (this.sprite.world.y - (this.sprite.anchor.y * this.height)) + this.offset.y;\nproblem was, it was not using width and height of sprite, but body and it was giving hardly predictable results, because anchor applied to sprite, was here applied to body size. On second row of imaga at: http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/22695-247-248-body-anchoring-any-migration-tips/#comment-129375 you want body offset 15,15, but on pictures it is 15,15 from both anchor and top left of the sprite only on first image. On others it is not 15,15 from anchor nither top left of sprite.\nSo, change to 2.4.8 was this - taking width and height of sprite:\njavascript\n        this.position.x = (this.sprite.world.x - (this.sprite.anchor.x * this.sprite.width)) + this.offset.x;\n        this.position.y = (this.sprite.world.y - (this.sprite.anchor.y * this.sprite.height)) + this.offset.y;\nIt kept body on fixed position relative to top left of sprite. But problem with negative scales was still there. I believe, that lot of people never encountered it, because by chance in 2.4.7 negative x with anchor 0.5 (most common) resulted in the same result as positive x with anchor 0.5.\nChange in 2.4.9 corrected this:\njavascript\n        this.position.x = (this.sprite.world.x - (this.sprite.anchor.x * this.sprite.width)) + this.sprite.scale.x * this.offset.x;\n        this.position.x -= this.sprite.scale.x < 0 ? this.width : 0;\n        this.position.y = (this.sprite.world.y - (this.sprite.anchor.y * this.sprite.height)) + this.sprite.scale.y * this.offset.y;\n        this.position.y -= this.sprite.scale.y < 0 ? this.height : 0;\nNow, the discussed change, regargless it will be implemented or not, is in fact anchor independent:\njavascript\n        this.position.x = this.sprite.world.x + this.sprite.scale.x * this.offset.x;\n        this.position.x -= this.sprite.scale.x < 0 ? this.width : 0;\n        this.position.y = this.sprite.world.y + this.sprite.scale.y * this.offset.y;\n        this.position.y -= this.sprite.scale.y < 0 ? this.height : 0;\nIt is not interested in anchor (texture offset) anymore. It completely splits from visual representation of sprite (texture, width, height) - sprite is anchored relative to sprite positon and body is independently offseted from sprite position. It is fun, that this code is also most simple in whole code evolution (while including negative scale handling). Only one things is in my mind: whether width and height of body here should be also multiplied with sprite scale if it is different from 1/-1, so it scales correctly with sprite (will have to make some tests, but I think it should). Then code would look like this:\njavascript\n        this.position.x = this.sprite.world.x + this.sprite.scale.x * (this.offset.x - this.sprite.scale.x < 0 ? this.width : 0);\n        this.position.y = this.sprite.world.y + this.sprite.scale.y * (this.offset.y - this.sprite.scale.y < 0 ? this.height : 0);\n. @photonstorm are you sure, that 2.4.7 was based off anchor?

I am sorry for that...\nThe first one works, but you need to call setSize for every new body... which is not too friendly. It is appropriate to what @andiCR needed to solve, but probably not for majority of users who need quickly set their sprites with bodies. I would stick to custom changes when someone has similar needs like andiCR. So, sorry once more...\n. @photonstorm \n The final one is crap.

For single line text it is not so important. But for multiline text it allows you for example to align values in table to right.\n I think in GetBitmapTextSize(), width of line is more or less calculated already now.. Thanks!

You wrote: \"The problem with the 'calculate world positions before rendering' approach is that it's too late by that point. There are lots of reasons you need the world positions to be perfectly accurate all the time.

Any chance, that caching input during frame and then processing it all at once after (or before - next frame) gameobjects changes would help? I had something similar in my very old and crappy framework for Android/iOS/bada. I was not processing input immediatelly, but just recorded it and than processed it before scene update in next frame. Of course, there was up to 1 frame delay, but it was so negligible, that I did not even feel any delay as user.\nSimilar for camera culling. I always thought, that culling is applied after objects are transformed into world and during culling you are deciding, whether object is visible for that camera or not. Does it mean, that culling in Phaser 3 is somehow \"distributed\" during scene update?. @photonstorm Rich, thanks for detailed explanation above.

Of course, there was up to 1 frame delay, but it was so negligible, that I did not even feel any delay as user.\nSimilar for camera culling. I always thought, that culling is applied after objects are transformed into world and during culling you are deciding, whether object is visible for that camera or not. Does it mean, that culling in Phaser 3 is somehow \"distributed\" during scene update?. You can make something similar to what I did for BitmapText. In short, you need to take canvas, render image with tint into it and use this new texture instad of image from images/atlas.. You can make something similar to what I did for BitmapText.

    "mikewesthad": "@stoneman1 thanks for pointing that out!  I was running into the same issue.  \nI'm working on a project where I can't switch to the dev branch and where it makes sense to keep a standard, unmodified version of Phaser 2.4.6.  For anyone in a similar situation, you can reach into the \"private\" mouse variable and unregister the window event when you destroy the game:\njs\nvar mouse = game.input.mouse;\nwindow.removeEventListener(\"mouseout\", mouse._onMouseOutGlobal, true);\ngame.destroy();\n. Circling back to this issue - I don't think it makes sense for a Tile instance to have an memory of it's past ID(s). Tile animation would be great territory for a plugin, or a potential PR that uses an Animation class.\nThat said, you could implement something like this with the existing API's tile.properties.\njs\n// At setup:\nlayer.forEachTile(tile => {\n  tile.properties.originalIndex = tile.index;\n});\nOr, if you are using Tiled, you can set up your animations using the editor there. When you load up your tilemap, you can access the animation data via tile.getTileData(). The structure of the tile data will look something like this:\njs\n{\n    \"animation\":[\n        {\n            \"duration\":100,\n            \"tileid\":33\n        }, \n        {\n            \"duration\":100,\n            \"tileid\":65\n        }, \n        {\n            \"duration\":100,\n            \"tileid\":129\n        }\n}\nThen you can use that however you want.. This should be fixed now. Thanks for the bug report!. Ditto to that - yeah, at a certain point Matter can't resolve all those tiny collisions. Thanks for pointing it out @RiCoTeRoX.. Not a bug per-say, but the issue is that layer still refers to a (now destroyed) dynamic layer. The code should look like this:\njs\nvar layer = map.createDynamicLayer(0, tileset, 0, 0);\nlayer = map.convertLayerToStatic(layer);\nthis.matter.world.convertTilemapLayer(layer);\nAdded clarifying notes to both the jsdocs for the method and to the relevant example.. Hey @iamchristopher - you can manually set properties on your Tile objects by manipulating Tile#properties. Then you can use setCollisionByProperty(...) however you want.\nWhen creating a tilemap from an array of indices, there are no tile properties in the data to speak of. It's just indices. The array format is intentionally super simple. If you want something more complicated, you could create a blank tilemap layer and then manipulate the tiles directly by looping over them and setting indices/properties/colliding however you want.. Would you be able to explain a bit more about the use case you envision? I'm having trouble picturing why the array format api needs to be more complicated vs creating a blank map and using the Tile api. \nOn a second read of your situation, since you've got this modular Tiled setup, I imagine you could automate things nicely. You could loop over all the tiles in your map and use Tileset#getTileProperties (if all the rooms share a tileset) to copy over the props you set up in Tiled. . @12casper3 Thanks - fixed!. One thing to note about the raycasting in Matter (which I was just looking into) is that it doesn't make use of the broadphase collision filtering, so it's going to be rough if you try to do a few raycasts in one tick against a lot of bodies (e.g. a tilemap).. Heh, thanks. Ended up there as well and thought about turning it into a plugin, but my use case was covered by sensors so decided to just stick with them for now.. @the-simian, exactly what @hexus linked \ud83d\udc4d. I was actually looking to raycasting initially to clean up a few of those Matter platformer examples that I created. The vanilla Matter example for sensors might also be useful: http://brm.io/matter-js/demo/#sensors.. I can take a look at cull tiles tomorrow and see if anything jumps out.\nEdit: Yeah, what you did with disabling culling entirely for now seems reasonable.. @rscott442, I was deep in this issue not too long ago so figured I'd chime in. This is actually the expected behavior with compound bodies, which are matter bodies that are actually composed of multiple, separate bodies linked together. When it comes to matter collisions with compound bodies (looks like both your ship and ball are both compound bodies), it's only the root/top-level body that has the gameObject property you are looking for. In your case, you can get to the root body from bodyA via bodyA.parent, but a more general function that gets the root of deeply nested bodies would be:\njs\nfunction getRootBody(body) {\n  while (body.parent !== body) body = body.parent;\n  return body;\n} \nSo you could do:\njs\nthis.matter.world.on('collisionstart', function (event, bodyA, bodyB) {\n  const rootBodyA = getRootBody(bodyA);\n  const rootBodyB = getRootBody(bodyB);\n  rootBodyA.gameObject.setTint(0xff0000);\n  rootBodyB.gameObject.setTint(0x00ff00);\n});\nYou can see that kind of approach in context in this demo from Phaser Labs. Note: I wouldn't rely the bodyA & bodyB parameters in the event handler like in your sample code - I would loop over event.pairs. There may be multiple colliding bodies on a given tick of the physics engine, and bodyA/bodyB will only be the first colliding pair from the tick.\nIf you get deeper into trying to detect matter collisions between game objects, then you might find this phaser-matter-collision-plugin useful. It wraps up things to make detecting collisions between game objects a bit easier.\n. Good catch - thanks @imilo.\n@photonstorm, yeah this method should update both Tilemap.tileWidth and LayerData.baseTileWidth (but not LayerData.tileWidth). It looks good with the recent commit. Tilemap.tileWidth and Tilemap.tileHeight represent the base tile size / grid size for all the layers. The LayerData.baseTileWidth & LayerData.baseTileHeight are for convenience (mainly for the shared functions like TileToWorldX which operate on LayerData).. ",

When you set clone to true Phaser uses Phaser.Utils.extend which returns an object.\nMy suggestion is that you either wrap your array inside an object or handle the cloning on your own.\n. This is not an issue as far as I can tell.\nIf you want it centered just use \nsetSize(bodyWidth, bodyHeight, spriteWidth * 0.5 - bodyWidth * 0.5, spriteHeight * 0.5 - bodyHeight * 0.5);\nDividing/multiplying those values with the anchor\n.

The position of the body is moving when changing from frame to frame.\n. Thanks @photonstorm, I'll create a new issue with test code + asets\n. While I agree the setSize description takes into account the top-left of the Sprite image and not the anchor, I think it is very inconvenient to leave this as is. The animation's anchor is at the bottom center of the sprite (feet) precisely to both save unnecesary frame space as well as be able to place any object, any height or size, and have it placed at the exact same position. Think of having this coordinate set to either a big character like Zangief or small one like Sakura (all Street Fighter) set to the same position on screen, all of them with different image sizes. This is a very common practice for games, so I'd like to keep my anchors on the middle-bottom.\nI think this should be labeled as a suggested feature, if not a bug.

For a project I'm working on, I wrote a gulp task that parses external tileset references and includes them in a final compiled tilemap. This allows me to keep the separate tileset files for development, but the build just has a single tilemap.json that works fine with Phaser.\n. ``` js\n/\n * Build complete tilemaps by merging in their related tileset .json files.\n /\nfunction buildTilemaps() {\n    return gulp.src(STATIC_PATH + TILEMAPS_PATH + '/.json', {base: STATIC_PATH})\n        .pipe(editJson(function(tilemap) {\n            if (!tilemap.tilesets) {\n                return tilemap;\n            }\n        for (var t in tilemap.tilesets) {\n            var stub = tilemap.tilesets[t];\n\n            if (!stub.source) {\n                continue;\n            }\n\n            var tileset = require(STATIC_PATH + TILEMAPS_PATH + '/' + stub.source);\n\n            tilemap.tilesets[t] = merge(stub, tileset);\n        }\n\n        return tilemap;\n    }, {\n        'brace_style': 'collapse-preserve-inline',\n        'keep_array_indentation': true,\n        'preserve_newlines': true\n    }))\n    .pipe(gulpif(isProduction(), uglify()))\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(BUILD_PATH));\n\n}\n```\nSomething a bit like that, as part of the ES6 boilerplate for Phaser. I used the gulp-json-editor package from NPM but I'm sure there are plenty even more suitable packages out there; I just wanted to get it working quickly and stop worrying about it. Also used there is the merge package.\nThe formatting options don't do what I wanted; I wanted to keep the resulting tile data arrays on a single line instead of one tile value per line but I couldn't reach a solution.\n.

I don't use Typescript, just Webpack and ES6. Once Webpack is up and running (i.e. watching and caching) then it rebundles very quickly.. It's certainly not a simple problem. Tiled's roadmap actually has a feature in the works for saving tilemaps with external data (object types, tilesets) as if they were embedded, though. See bjorn/tiled#1850..

I like how minimal yet impactful this change is.\nI agree that Path Followers shouldn't be limited to Sprites. I'm not sure whether it should be bound to being a Container, but that certainly is one way to enable any Game Object to be a Path Follower.. > How about adding a parameter to change the default base class?\nMy previous comment was likely in the hopes that there would be a way to extend GameObject, or even decorate it, but JS makes that kind of tricky, because GameObjects have all kinds of methods that we can't magically forward to.\nAs such, a Container is the best approach I can think of at the moment.\nOnce the JSDoc has updated according to your API changes we could look at merging this. :+1: . Having reviewed this a little further, I think PathFollower could be simplified to use augmentation similar to the way MatterGameObject works.\nThis would involve moving PathFollower properties and methods to a Game Object Component class instead. I'm going to look into implementing this.. See #3936 for a demonstration of what I had in mind. It's not quite finished, but gets the idea across.\nEdit:\n\nBut on the ts side, I have concerns about the definition. As you can see,\nthe MatterGameObject strips all typescript definitions down to a plain\nGameObject. You throw in a Sprite and get a GameObject in return. Wouldn't\nit be better to return an interface reflecting the added features?\n\nYou're quite right, this wouldn't play nicely with TypeScript. I'm not hugely familiar with the language, so I'm not sure how to handle such dynamic typing and mixins.. > Wouldn't it be better to return an interface reflecting the added features?\nTo elaborate on my previous comment, I totally agree here. The problem is that the provided Game Object could be just that: any type of Game Object. I would assume there isn't a way to dynamically map return types based on given parameter types in TypeScript.\nAnother option would be making a mixin type def for every type of Game Object: {PathFollowerSprite|PathFollowerContainer|PathFollower*}. But that seems a bit unfriendly for custom Game Objects.\nThe true solution to this kind of problem is an Entity Component System, but Phaser isn't designed this way.. It's currently absolutely possible to fill a page with the canvas using the browser's and Phaser's resize events.\nThe rest of the full-screen support, after that fact, that hasn't been wrapped up by Phaser yet, but you can still implement it yourself.\nCheck out this example:\nhttp://labs.phaser.io/edit.html?src=src\\game%20config\\game%20resize.js\nHit Launch to see it in action outside of an iframe.. As I said:\n\nThe rest of the full-screen support, after that fact, that hasn't been wrapped up by Phaser yet, but you can still implement it yourself.\n\nI do understand the difference. :) \nYou can still use the browser's Fullscreen API to achieve what you want, until the Scale Manager is implemented to do it for you.. I feel like blocked should be set when the body is unable to move in that direction, and touching should be set when the collision response is in that direction (dot > 0) but the body is still able to move on that axis. That's how my slopes plugin works, at least. :)\nIn this case though, it means blocked would always be set for vanilla Arcade, because it's AABB exclusively.. In @samme's case, I'd still expect blocked to stay true within the update loop because he's calling collide(), and one might even expect that to stay the same even with a collider() set up.. Check out this example:\nhttp://labs.phaser.io/edit.html?src=src\\physics\\matterjs\\drag%20with%20pointer.js\nAs for limiting which bodies a mouse spring can affect, I know you can access the constraint object as such:\njs\nvar mouseSpring = this.matter.add.mouseSpring();\nconsole.log(mouseSpring);\nBut there don't seem to be any handy methods for setting the collision filter.\nThe raw collision filter of the constraint is available here, however:\njs\nconsole.log(mouseSpring.constraint.collisionFilter);\n// {category: 1, mask: 4294967295, group: 0}\n\nI think it would be good for us to implement the setCollisionCategory() and setCollidesWith() methods for the PointerConstraint class.. Ah, brilliant! I didn't realise that was possible. :)\n@rimonmath:\njs\nthis.matter.add.mouseSpring({ length: 1, stiffness: 0.6, collisionFilter: { group: canDrag } });\nhttps://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-examples/blob/73bc72df0a0aba50589e199400ba404cb47987c5/public/src/physics/matterjs/drag%20filter%20with%20pointer.js#L28-L46. No worries - @photonstorm made it for you! :). Thanks!\nFor your information, the build error is unrelated to this change.. It's very similar in Phaser 3 at the moment, I haven't seen a Phaser-specific API that wraps it up.\nThis example creates a compound body for the player object:\nhttp://labs.phaser.io/edit.html?src=src\\game%20objects\\tilemap\\collision\\matter%20platformer%20with%20wall%20jumping.js\nMatter's usual API is sitting under the Phaser.Physics.Matter.Matter namespace.. It looks like this is due to wrapped sampling. You're quite right, the line your seeing on the left is from the semicircle on the right.\nThis could be fixed if we allowed using the GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE or GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER wrapping methods (https://open.gl/textures), but alternatively, try extruding or padding your texture.\n\n\nTexturePacker can automate this process. Search the following page for \"extrude\".\nhttps://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker/documentation/texture-settings. Merged (#3802). Thanks. :+1: . Thanks. :+1: . @oloflarsson, that's a classic case of tunnelling, which is caused by high velocity bodies moving past a colliding tile into a non-colliding one. It's typically solved by continuous collision detection or predictive collision detection, neither of which are implemented for Arcade as of yet.. Raycasting is actually built in to MatterJS. :grin: It can be used within Phaser 3.\nWould be great for Arcade though, for sure, especially since there's a quad tree available.\nPerhaps I could make an example for raycasting with MatterJS, if there isn't one already.. Yeah, it would be faster to use a broadphase test first to collect all the bodies within the bounds of the ray, then perform the raycast against those bodies.\nhttps://github.com/liabru/matter-js/issues/181#issuecomment-294450986\nThis should point you in the right direction.. MatterJS bodies can be made into sensors, which means they don't have any impact with other bodies, but they can still be used to detect collisions. Here's a great example:\nhttp://labs.phaser.io/edit.html?src=src/game%20objects\\tilemap\\collision\\matter%20platformer%20modify%20map.js. Thanks for spotting this, the pipeline will likely need to take into account the rotation of each game object.. Thanks for spotting these, I'll fix them this evening.. These have been fixed. I went over all the loader file type descriptions (crikey, they're long and duplicated!) just to make sure there weren't any other instances of this, and found one in the HTMLFile type.\nThis will be included in the next release.\nCheers! . I've just added this in (1ceec993). Thanks for finding this!. Introduced by commit 1a62a356.. This should now be fixed.\nThe Graphics object had new dependencies (1a62a35) that were not provided when the static Graphics.TargetCamera object was used by the Graphics.generateTexture() method.\nProviding a Graphics instance's scene reference to the TargetCamera at texture rendering time resolved the issue for me, in my own project.\nPlease feel free to test this by building the master branch and let us know if this fixes the issue for you.\nI'm leaving this open in case @photonstorm would like to solve it in a different way.. I'd like to see it updated too. I'd also prefer Matter to be brought in via NPM, and simply aliased to the Phaser namespace. . I like your approach. It keeps the path following behaviour and the game object separate.. Frame rate independence for MatterJS was the default before Phaser 3.4.0, but it caused a lot of instability when used with Phaser's delta.\nHowever, you can still provide your own function to step Matter's physics simulation. It's mentioned here in the change log:\nhttps://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/0eef6f1bb9a9cf3c12b162dd28f8afd080ea172f/CHANGELOG.md#version-340---miyako---12th-april-2018\nIf you find a good way to retain frame rate independence and stability with Matter in Phaser 3, please let me know! I'd be very interested to see it working. :). I'm not certain when it comes to Arcade. That's always been stepped a fixed amount as far as I'm aware.\nBy the way, when I run your code pen, the bodies tumble at and angle and start flying everywhere, and eventually the browser tab crashes! :smile:. There is a way to do this, yes. You can use this approach from within your scene:\njs\nthis.matter.add.gameObject(sprite);\nThis in fact works for any game object. Here's a related example where this is used with a Tile Sprite:\nhttp://labs.phaser.io/edit.html?src=src\\physics\\matterjs\\add%20body%20to%20tilesprite.js. An explicit, minimal reproduction of this issue in a sandbox like JSBin or Codepen would be really helpful.. This line could be moved in place of line 1040, isFound = true;. Avoids the extra conditional and variable. :). Nice!. It'd be worth removing this from the JSDoc also.. How come so much of this was removed? To avoid duplication?. ",

    "plissken2013es": "Thanks for clearing this out, Richard.\n. Regarding to your first comment, I've tried this:\nsprite.animations.loadFrameData(fame.cache.getFrameData(\"texture_key\");\nAnd then I tried to play the new animations, but it doesn't work: some weird visual effect occurs.\nMaybe the API only needs to take account on the size and number of frames that the new texture has. For example:\nfunction preload() {\ngame.load.spritesheet(\"key1\", null, 27, 63, 4);\ngame.load.spritesheet(\"key2\", null, 31, 69, 5);\n}\nfunction create() {\nmySprite= game.add.sprite(0, 0, \"key1\");\nmySprite.animations.add(\"anim1\", null, 6, true);\nmySprite.animations.add(\"anim2\", null, 12, false);\nmySprite.play(\"key1\");\nLater in the code:\nmySprite.loadTexture(\"key2\", 0, true);\nmySprite.play(\"anim2\");\nThe \"loadTexture\" method stops the current animation before loading the new texture and before showing the frame number 0, in this case. It should reset the \"frameTotal\" and \"_frames\" properties of anim1 and anim2 to 5 and [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] because I set its optional \"frames\" Array property to null when I defined them at the \"preload()\" method, and this means that I want to use all available frames.\nNevertheless, you propose a new interesting approach to this matter: it'll be great if we could link any animation to a any key spritesheet by passing an object parameter instead of one array parameter containing frame numbers or names. So, finally, the \"animations.add\" method could be this way:\nadd(name, frames, frameRate, loop, useNumericIndex)\nwhere the frames parameter continues to be optional (null, by default) but could be an array or an object.\nIf an array is given, it behaves as usual: the API takes an array of numbers/strings that correspond to the frames to add to the animation and in which order. e.g. [1, 2, 3] or ['run0', 'run1', run2]). If null then all frames will be used.\nBut, if an object is given in this form:\nmySprite.animations.add('shoot', { texture1: [0,1,2,3], texture2: [\"gun0\", \"gun1\", \"gun2\", \"gun3\", \"gun4\", \"gun5\", \"gun6\"], texture3: null })\nThe API now interprets that we want this animation to have three different \"flavors\": one that uses texture1 -which is an spritesheet-  and its frames from 0 to 3, another one that uses texture2 -an atlas- and its frames named gun0 ... gun6, and finally texture3, an spritesheet from which we use all available frames.\nObviously, we'll need a method to switch between \"texture modes\" later in our game.\nIt seems like a non-trivial improvement for the API, but it provides a new useful way to handle sprites.\nWhat do you think?\n. Same issue. It works on 3.11, but fails on 3.12 & 3.13.. ",

    "kevinAlbs": "I was able to reproduce this, and I think a quick fix to your issue is to add to your create() method:\ngame.camera.roundPx = false;\nThe key issue seems to be that the camera position increment may have no effect if the increment is too small and gets rounded off when roundPx is true. Specifically: https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/v2.6.2/src/core/Camera.js#L624-L635 may be incrementing this.view.x by small values which always get rounded to the same integer during this.view.floor().\nI'm not sure if this is \"technically\" a bug because maybe this is what should happen if roundPx is true, but it is definitely unexpected. Is there a reason that roundPx is true by default? And if roundPx is true, could we store the exact unrounded position in view and rather round this.displayObject.position?

    "hdodov": "I've come up with the code below for this problem. It seems to be working perfectly. I tested it with various combinations of child and parent anchors, scales and positions. The parent's scale is set to 1 because its width, left and top are affected by it and would cause the child to be positioned inaccurately. However, the scale is then turned back. I've not yet seen a problem with that.\n```\nPhaser.Sprite.prototype.alignInParent = function(position, offsetX, offsetY){\n    if(this.parent.name == \"__world\")return;\nvar s = this.parent.scale;\nthis.parent.scale.setTo(1);\nthis.alignIn(this.parent, position, offsetX, offsetY);\n\nthis.left -= this.parent.left + (this.parent.width*this.parent.anchor.x);\nthis.top -= this.parent.top + (this.parent.height*this.parent.anchor.y);\n\nthis.parent.scale = s;\n\n};\n```\nThis could be a possible implementation, or just an idea of it.\n. Yep, I know. But it would be nice if people can have it without writing it themselves. An engine's job is to make things as easier as it can.\n. Uhm.\nI believe the Sprite behaves the way you want by default. When you enable physics for it, gravity affects it. It's affected by collision only when you deliberately want it to by using game.physics.arcade.collide. If you want to only check if a Sprite collides, but you don't want the engine to separate it from the colliding object (having impact), you just use game.physics.arcade.overlap. Have a look at the examples that Phaser provides.\nHope that was helpful! :)\n. @samme yep.\n. Oops, excuse me. I thought you wrote \"does my game have the same problem when I remove the handler\". It doesn't scale right. Without the window.onresize, the problem is still there. On my PC screen, it's reeeally scaled up and more than half of it is hidden (just like in the image I've shown).\nIt still scales right when the height is greater than the width, though. It just doesn't work the other way round.\n. The problem was in my game's parent div. When I removed it so that my game is directly in the body, it started working. It's strange, though, that container didn't have any CSS styling it.\n. The solution proposed by @ItsMeAlves wouldn't work as expected. If the value is 5, the goal is 10 and the step is 100, reach() would return 105, instead of 10. That's why in my example implementation I used the difference variable.\nEDIT: I found some faults in my example too. I'll think about possible solutions and update the issue.\nEDIT2: Alright, fixed it. It works every time now. I implemented it in my game and it works perfectly.. This functionality was added in Phaser CE with this pull request.. The code itself is also wrong:\ngame.load.script('filterX', 'https://cdn.rawgit.com/photonstorm/phaser/master/filters/BlurX.js');\n...\nvar blurX = game.add.filter('BlurX');\nIt's saved in the cache with key filterX, but used as BlurX..

Closed cause I accidentally requested many commits instead of just mine to merge.\n. If this fix is accepted then I guess the only thing left to change is in the docs the DisplayObjectContainer.getBounds() method that I've changed to getBounds(targetCoordinateSpace) to make it more flexible and to allow checking bounds to any target not just local and global. \nSorry I haven't included the doc change in this commit  - didn't think about it at the time.\nAlso having said that - with this fix - I think Phaser.Group bottom top etc could get their value from getLocalBounds() instead of getBounds() and then it wouldn't be a problem if the group is added to a parent with transforms. This just came up to me so I am not sure if I am right, but please let me know what you think. Thanks!\n. @st0nerhat yes, sorry, I didn't know how to properly mention those two commits are for the same issue. I do hope I found the proper fix for it!\n. I mentioned that DisplayObjectContainer.getBounds(targetCoordinateSpace) allows checking bounds to any target not just local and global, but actually right now it doesn't. What it can do is:\n1) if targetCoordinateSpace is the same instance as the caller of getBounds(), then it will return the bounds of the caller without any transformations;\n2) if targetCoordinateSpace is any valid DisplayObject it will return the local bounds of the caller.\n3) if targetCoordinateSpace  is null/undefined it will return the global bounds of the caller.\nThe idea was that it will return bounds related to any targetCoordinateSpace, parent or no parent. Well it still fixes getting 1) 2) and 3). Still good enough, I was hoping it will do more than that but it needs to be reworked a bit so it could do the trick. If I have the time I will add that too or you guys could finish it if you'd like. But in any ways even if you add this fix as is, it will still be a lot better than what it is or what it was before, because it will fix the current issues we have with dimensions.\n.

I hope I helped out and will be happy to see this in the next version :)\nYou can read the full description of what changed and how from the initial commit in the second commit's description. \nRegards\n. Hmm well, in order to calculate proper bounds, sometimes, like with getLocalBounds(), the transform is reset for a parent and then reapplied, but it's weird cause it worked with the same idea even before changing the code a bit - so the changes we made shouldn't introduce a bug like that unless it's been there already... \nI am building a 2D no physics game right now and I am not seeing any flashes with my build - which includes only the changes I created as PRs here.

If I have to convert my tilemaps I will but I'd like to know if this is something that will be fixed/ changed first. Thanks!. Thank you for the response! I'll keep an eye out for news and continue to make the current implementation work for me in the meantime. Very excited for the future of Phaser.. Appears to be fixed in v3.2.0 by setting transparent: true in the game config.. @photonstorm Thanks for the response! Just to clarify: are you suggesting that I call this.sys.displayList.add(playerSprite) (this being the current scene) before adding it to the Group?\nAlso, I started a thread on the forums if you'd prefer to move discussion there.. That's a great point for a scenario I hadn't considered. Throwing my hat in the ring for option 1, with an example call being:\njs\ngroup.add(sprite, {\n    addToScene: true\n});. I just noticed that the old implementation closes the path after stroking it. I made this change to the new implementation and it had the desired result. I'm not sure if this order of operations change is intended/ needed for other line types, though.. Thanks for the response, @mikewesthad! I had a sneaking suspicion that would be the solution. Thanks for confirming :). @mikewesthad Before I move to implement your recommended solution, I just wanted to clarify.. You said this format is intentionally simple--does that mean you wouldn't be open to a PR adding that functionality?\nEDIT: I posted a follow-up question on the forums related to the implementation if anyone can offer some assistance.. Sure, I'll try to explain..\n\nI've created a handful of room segments (8x10) in Tiled. Segments are typed by direction (left, right, and down)\nGiven a room dimension (ie, 6x6 segments) I generate a room layout by creating a 2D array containing indices representing segment types. This guarantees a path across the room while creating alternate paths that are dead ends\nI map over this layout and insert segment (layer) data from Tiled, giving me a 2D array containing room segments\nNext I need to merge all of the rooms together to create a single massive map that can be used as a Tilemap\nFinally I can create a Collision Map using the merged data\n\nFrom a visual standpoint this all works wonderfully (props to all the work that's been done with Tilemaps et al), but I've hit a wall now that I'm trying to use this generated Tilemap like a regular one exported from Tiled by accessing properties.\nI tried using Tileset#getTileProperties as you suggested and came up empty as the Tileset doesn't seem to have any properties. My assumption is that because the Tileset is created using the generated Tilemap (addTilesetImage) it isn't aware of any tile properties.\nYour idea of simply creating a blank map sounds interesting. Is there an example of this technique available? I've found this one but it randomizes the layout instead of having a fixed one. I'll dig around in the meantime and see if I can figure something out. This way seems like less of a hack \ud83d\ude01 . When using Impact physics, I believe you have to refer to it as this.impact instead of this.physics. I'm not familiar with the particulars of why this is but if you switch to that your code will work.. Curious why you didn't change to return string.replace(/* .. */) instead of assigning back to string?. I can respect laziness! But thanks for considering my nitpicky comment.. @CorayThan You could try using a DOMElement to render your video.. There is plenty of documentation available. Refer to the repo for details and to contribute.. @raisen According the devlog, the Scale Manager will be available in v3.12-beta3 closer to the end of August.. Could you not achieve this using a RenderTexture?. Just to say that I'm using those RT transform methods (although that feature has been disabled in my game for a few weeks at this point) and I would much rather use GO transforms.. @magnusducatuslt Not to speak out of turn, but in cases like this it's much easier to help diagnose with a live, running sample. I'd recommend getting this running on a service like jsfiddle so others can be certain they're viewing the same issue you are.. Works great, thanks!. The setdata event is only emitted the first time a value is set and subsequent changes emit the changedata event. This behaviour is documented here and was changed in v3.10. The labs example should be updated to reflect this behaviour.. There's an example in the labs that cycles through different shapes for a particle emitter's emit zone that I can update?. @photonstorm I left out the important bit, my apologies. I meant to say that I set origin to 0,0 before creating the body, and then the origin is reset to 0.5,0.5 afterwards.\njs\nvar poly = this.add.polygon(0, 0, data, 0x0000ff, 0.8).setOrigin(0, 0);\nthis.matter.add.gameObject(poly);. Is the solution to set origin to 0,0 again? If I do, I end up with this:\n. I see. So I have to position the GO from 0.5,0.5 now? I'd prefer to do it from 0,0 but if that's the way it is then I can adjust. What is the unit of the offset? I set the xOffset to 0.025 without setting the yOffset and I don't really understand why it fixed the positioning.. Thanks for all your help and explanations on this, @photonstorm. I haven't solved this for myself yet (I can't wrap my head around manipulating the body/ sprite relationship) but I've come up with a different implementation that got the job done.. I'm seeing this behaviour as well. It's still unclear to me if this is in fact a bug or a misunderstanding of how a RenderTexture should behave. See this thread for my ongoing adventure.. There's a plugin that adds support for this.. Just to say that the provided example isn't working for me on my Android device with Chrome 72. @levieggert does the labs example work for you (it does for me)?. You'll likely need to revert this as it doesn't appear to be related to your fix.. Wondering if a loop is unnecessary overhead here? Direct assignment may be better: radius.tl = radius.tl || 0. The above condition defines different default values than this. Perhaps one default should be define and referenced in each case?. That's a valid point, I think it makes sense to keep it the way you have it then :)\nHowever, you may want to consider adding the default radius in the constructor and then update setDefaultStyles to accept an override..

Looks like you use them a lot. Or did you considered switching phaser itself to TypeScript? You should try make a small private project with TypeScript 2 and a modern IDE like VS Code: code completion, refactoring, inline documentation and so on work really well nowadays. Especially such a big project like phaser itself would benefit from being written in TypeScript.\n. Me, too. Converted some TS projects to JS.

Thanks for responding Rich! Looking forward to it. Based on my experience with using Spine on Phaser 2.x, I think you may want to look into the ability of treating Spine as a Phaser.Group object or a Phaser.Sprite object.

While poking around in the Graphics renderer I've noticed that the paths work very differently to how paths in the regular canvas works. This could lead to very inconsistent rendering, but allows for some fancy effects. Perhaps these \"fancy lines\" should be broken out into a separate class, so the WebGL renderer can be made to mimic the canvas as closely as possible instead?\nI've also been wondering about some eslint rules, like for example \"eol-last\" and \"space-before-function-paren\". All the code seems to do the exact opposite of what they're set to enforce. Do you not use eslint?. But eslint is configured to disallow ending newlines, and spaces before function parenthesis, and all files end in newline and have spaces before function parenthesis? I get an error for eol-last for every file, and space-before-function-paren for every function. Perhaps something changed in how eslint interprets the rules?. Oh, I'm terribly sorry. It turns out eslint was reading unrelated rules from other directories, and that's what was confusing it.

SceneManager.js:947 if i debug i see that the entry.key is always the \"default\", not my keys (\"boot\", \"game\"), therefore the default entry.data = {} is passed. \nAs pointed out in the forums, setting the 'active' property can cause this, but if i set the active to false, i got the same results. http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/36148-phaser-3-scene-phaser-2-state-passing-data-to-init-when-start/\nIssue?\nCan you please approve this is an expected behaviour OR a bug?\nIf expected, how can I replicate the Phaser 2 State flow (initialize one state at a time, pass data, start another state, only one state is running) in Phaser 3? . thanks @photonstorm , done! https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/issues/3363. Hi Rich! thank you for the quick reply! No, i was trying to use my own webpack project template for older versions, i saw there are multiple templates including quite complex ones, but was not aware we have this simple one! Thanks! \n(I see now in the documentation and the Phaser 3 release page, maybe it would worth to highlight even more in the documentation that if you want to setup a project it will need special webpack configs. Anyway, great work, super community, keep up the spirit, i am planning to contribute). @photonstorm also, is there an official Phaser 3 + Webpack + ES6 boilerplate project template? I see lots of boilerplate projects, some with ES6, most of them is very verbose as boilerplate projects usually are - is there one you could approve as an official? . @rblopes just what i was looking for, thanks!!. @photonstorm yeah it might need a default value and as i saw it behaves differently if scenes are defined in config, or directly, or ES6 extending the Phaser.Scene as a class or used with arrow lifecycle methods (i guess because of the this context bindings) .

That's...\na very good point.\nI'm not sure. I suppose the same trick could work by adding the global action on pointerdown, but that could break if the user releases the touch before the frame gets processed. Which would have to be very very fast, but the chance is still there. So not a great solution.\nAlso thinking about touch, doesn't that leave the pointer at the last place there was touch event? So assuming my previous code is used, and gets triggered via pointerover, clicking anywhere else would trigger the click event again, instead of moving pointer elsewhere.\nYeah this needs a proper solution.

    "sftsk": "Alright, cheers :). It seems like the same is happening on iOS when switching scenes and trying to play audio. The first audio you play works, but the next one will fail (silently) with this error.. @photonstorm any progress looking into this?. Alright, just removed\naudio: {\n    disableWebAudio: true\n  },\nfrom the game config and now audio works just fine on iOS/ Safari on macOS.\nNot sure why I thought HTML5 audio would be the way to go but this might happen to others as well. Perhaps tell in the examples it's advised to use Web Audio.\nCheers!. Did some more investigating. All the coordinates are off by whatever the multiple of the resolution is.\nIf set to 0.5 the clickable spots are half of the actual coordinates, if set to 1.5 they are at 150% of where they should be.\nCould it have to do with the canvas width/ height getting set twice so somehow the click goes to the smaller/ larger canvas size?\n<canvas width=\"555\" height=\"416\" style=\"width: 1111px; height: 833px;\"></canvas>. I have added a pull request. It fixes the issue :)\nWhen calculating the hit area the resolution wasn't taken into consideration.. Cheers @pixelpicosean for pointing me to a solution!\nI am now running the following code:\ngame.scene.scenes.forEach( function (scene) {\n  scene.cameras.main.setViewport( 0, 0, window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight );\n});\nafter game.resize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight).\nStill thinking this should probably happen automatically when doing the game.resize() but it works for now!. Exactly what @Mikurox said. Using the built-in Phaser function this.load.image('starfield', 'assets/images/starfield.png') it depends which \"server\" is serving the files.\nWhen using a server that deals with proper serving of files all is fine, when just opening the .html in the browser although using relative path the images don't load.\nThe same issue is happening with Cordova apps as it seems it does not serve the files as a \"server\" but just accesses them through their path from the filesystem.\nPhaser 2.x didn't have an issue but something must have changed in the Phaser 3.x Loader.\n. Cheers for all the feeback and ideas. Will look into this more after the weekend!\n@Saturate just try opening a basic Phaser 3 example directly from a folder in your browser. The error will happen as it can\u2019t load the files through xhr. Use Chrome so you get an error message in the console.. I have finally had time looking into this and got into the same solution as proposed by @ghybs .\nInstalling https://github.com/ionic-team/cordova-plugin-ionic-webview with Cordova fixes the issue. This will only be a fix for iOS, although probably for Android exists something similar.\nI don't think there is anything to be done within Phaser as this XHR Cross Origin policy seems to be a limitation that can't be easily worked around on mobile. Chrome has a flag --disable-web-security that will allow the requests, not sure if that could be an option for Android.\nAnyway, thanks for all the help, issue can be closed from my point of view. Perhaps add some instructions to the manual of needing the mentioned plugin when wrapping an app with Cordova.. Sorry for only getting back at this now, didn't have access to my iPad for some time.\nThank you @samme , this solves the issue.\nWill this line of code have any downsides/ create other problems?. After trying it out setting this.input.manager.touch.capture = false; creates a lot of new problems. I don't think this is a solution.\nWhen that's set you can zoom within the screen, clicks don't really work anymore and you can scroll around.. I have just tried it again and it still does not work. I am on an iPad Pro 9,7\" with iOS 12.\nI open the app, all works fine. I slide in the dock from the bottom, I close the dock -> the app gets no input anymore.\nThe problem doesn't happen with the notification panel. I guess it has to do with iOS multitasking and the app somehow loosing \"focus\" for a moment so the input manager gets stuck in the wrong state.\nMaybe a started swipe that newer ends..\nI really hope you can sort this out.. Hello, I have just managed to test this out. The bug doesn't happen anymore, amazing work!!!\nThank you so much :). ",

Ok, for exemple :\nThis list property (LoaderPlugin.js#L169) can be change with Phaser.Structs.Set.<Phaser.Loader.File> and now when you get element in this list is an File object.\nWe can apply the generic in functions with out for increase autocomplete.

The template is delcrared here Map.js#28 and is it same on all structs files.\nYes in programing the type integer and float is rigth but in JS we have only number type..

OK I can write an test tomorrow (I'm French) and for int/float we can make an alias for the ide recognize that types. . This is logic out T and K type because is it generic type. But if you want we can rename Generic names Like T > VALUE and K > KEY\nI have try search if we can make predefined generic like my exemple (<G extends Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject>) but i don't have found any solution for that :(\nThe generic type is pretty usefull for make TypeDefs.

To reproduce simply rotate the tileSprite and add it to a container, set a new displayHeight then hit area is broken.\nEdit: added more info. Hi, actually the key is to have different displayWidth than you originally set (my bad I didn't notice that was the important thing). Change your example to image.displayWidth = 128; or some other number. At the moment I can reproduce if:\n\nstarts with 32\nthen displayHeight = 24;\n\nCode again here:\n      const pipe = scene.add.tileSprite(fromPoint.x, fromPoint.y, fromPlanet.radius + 32 * 4, 32, 'pipe');\n\n      pipe.displayHeight = 24;\n      this.containers.shipStreams.add(pipe);\n      pipe.rotation = pathSlope;\n      pipe.setInteractive({cursor: 'pointer'});\n\nHit area is highlighted here:\n\nWould you mind allowing other people to re-open an issue?. @photonstorm well you changed the width, not the height. Anyway looks like I can reproduce with the code I sent to you. . @photonstorm well you changed the width, not the height. Anyway looks like I can reproduce with the code I sent to you. . Ah ok, thanks. Again, I think we can improve the docs on that area.. local coordinates besed on the anchor of the object or the center of the object? Maybe the docs could be improved? I can make a pr with the updates in the docs.. Ok, so the answer is that it doesn't take into consideration the anchor, which makes it worse and more fragile. So now the hit area has to be kept in sync with the origin by the developer, instead of being handled automatically by phaser..

Is top left of the camera?\nThe strange thing is that, when I do scroll it actually centers the camera on that object... With pan it centers, but adds a few 100s of pixels both on x and y axis.\nEdit: My bad I was adjusting the x, y for the scroll. As the pan and scrollX/Y don't do the same thing it was not working for pan.\n    const x = targetX - mainCamera.displayWidth / 2 * mainCamera.zoom;\n    const y = targetY - mainCamera.displayHeight / 2 * mainCamera.zoom;\n\n\nThis is not the same as scrollX/Y, which doesn't represent the center of the camera. \n\nI think would be nice to document what does that represent then. . > This is already covered in the Change Log.\nI'm talking about the API docs, not changelog as that's where people normally look when they need to use a library.\nYou don't want to keep this issue open for updating the API docs?. ah ok, do you know where I can find the docs for master version?. ah ok, thanks. i was looking for an easy url instead.

I use react and change a route. It will destroy the canvas element completely (without calling `game.destroy()`). Then will create another canvas and another game instance.

I'm not really sure, they use \"the fastest way to remove\" https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html\n\nWhat ways are there to remove the element? I guess this is the way https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ChildNode/remove\nparent.removeChild(child); or element.remove(), I can't tell which one. But probably will do this higher up in the dom hierarchy.. >  The only way I could see React bodging it up would be if it tried to use the same Canvas for the 2nd game instance.\nYes there is chance for that to happen actually... They can reuse the dom elements.. @photonstorm  But how do you explain that if you change the game.config.width/height it allows bigger render textures?\nAlso you are saying the max size is 800px by 800px? I just created one of 15000px by 15000px by changing game.config.width/height, so I have a feeling it has to do with phaser not with webgl limits.\nOn mobile I get an error of frame buffer if is 15k x 15k and I guess this is what you are talking about.. @photonstorm \n\nThe time of the draw appears to be irrelevant and not the trigger.\n\nWhat do you mean? I wonder because if you render a few 100s of times in the update method it will render only a few of them outside the crop area. So I assume for a few milliseconds the crop is not applied, only after that.\nIf you have a update method and there you draw 1000 times per update, you will see what I mean.. Hi!

Hello @photonstorm is there anything I can do to help on this issue? It's really blocking my game at the moment.. Thank you. Thank you. Ok. Ok. Also there is something very weird that if it breaks, and then restore the commit back the texture is still cropped. I'm not sure where this cache is stored. Maybe in webpack, but it never happened to me before.\nWhat I'm trying to say is that the same commit (exact code) has 2 different results dependent on previous code changes. . So if I don't change the scene.game.config.width I see the max drawable rendertexture the size of my screen, which is 600 x 500px. So the render texture is 600x500 even if I set it to 15000x15000.\nIf I change scene.game.config.width to 15000 then the rendertexture renders the correct size, 15000.\n\nYou can't not set a RenderTexture size either. If you don't provide one, it'll default to 32 x 32.\n\nI might be wrong but render texture has a width:\n\nNote that the rendertexture is inside a container which is viewed with a camera that is zoomed out and panned.\n\nYou can't not set a game width and height. If you don't provide one, it will default to 1024 x 768.\n\nI know, it's a hack that works sometimes... and tricks the render texture to be of the size I request and not of the size of the screen.. Just to correct. This behaviour only works in the phaser@3.12.0. On the 3.15.1 I can't make the rendertexture any size except the screensize.\nhere is the size: https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.GameObjects.RenderTexture.html\n\nI'm not sure why you say can't set the size on a RenderTexture.. \nSo if the render texture is 5k x 5k, then when is scaled by 0.2, should be 1k width. But is not as you can see in the output:\n\nThe output is cropped as there are no 1000 lemmings as well. Here is without scale, but the size of the render texture is 1000px:\n\nI hope you can see that somthing is wrong there.. A more obvious example here as well.\nIf the width is 2000px:\n\nIf the width is 1000px:\n\nThe width is the same (when you compare on the unscaled image, you need to click on the image and open), how can be possible when the width is double in the first example?\n    var config = {\n        type: Phaser.AUTO,\n        parent: 'phaser-example',\n        width: 400,\n        height: 600,\n        scene: {\n            preload: preload,\n            create: create,\n            update: update\n        }\n    };\n\n    var rt;\n    var container;\n\n    var game = new Phaser.Game(config);\n\n    function preload ()\n    {\n        this.load.image('lemming', 'assets/sprites/lemming.png');\n    }\n\n    function create ()\n    {\n\n\n        const width = 1000;\n        const height = 1000;\n        rt = this.add.renderTexture(0, 0, width, height);\n\n        let i = 10000\n        while(i--){\n            rt.draw('lemming', Math.random()*width, Math.random()*height);\n        }\n\n        rt.setScale(0.2, 0.2)\n        //rt.setX(50)\n    }\n\n    function update ()\n    {\n        //rt.camera.rotation -= 0.01;\n\n        //rt.clear();\n\n        //rt.draw(container);\n    }\n\n. Another example. If I change the game width.\nGame width 400px:\n\nGame width 600px:\n\nUsing rt.camera.setViewport doesn't work as explained here https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.Camera.html.

Grid/list table is a huge UI componment,\nHere is a demo my grid table ui componment. \n(My other ui componments). Graphics object does not have bounds, pass a geom shape\njavascript\nbtn.setInteractive(new Phaser.Geom.Rectangle(0, 0, 300, 200), Phaser.Geom.Rectangle.Contains);\nto define that bounds.\nOr use rectangle shape game object (scene.add.rectangle(x, y, width, height, fillColor).setInteractive()).

There was discussion about Text objects having resolution prop of their own, but it is permanently set to 1, and even after changing it in the source code, it does nothing.. Still an issue in 3.4.0. https://github.com/kirillbunin/phaser-3-7-1-safari-loader-bug\nlive demo http://phaser-safari-loader-bug.kirillbunin.com/\nSorry it's a bit of a mess.\nTry it on chrome, then on Safari on iOS or OSX, reloading it a several time (i found there are 4 possible behaviours).. To explain what is happening there, I have two main Image objects (+ some decorative one, just for the sake of it) first one, the main one, is red. When triggered change, it should hide the red one, and display the second one. The second one is initially green, but I'm trying to load an processed image there ( BasketBall.js lines 107-143). So in Chrome you'll get a Cat Ball.\nIn Safari, about 5% of the time, the Ball will stay red. 35% of the time it will be green. And 60% of the time it will be BLUE. I have no idea why Blue, since I'm not even using it. It's just a texture I happen to load.. In my other findings, Safari overall has problems working with masks. I'm taking advantage of the depth to put some objects in front of the other, but only Safari can't handle it. After tweening it randomly renders object in bad order, even though the depth prop says it should be okay. Since I'm using Mask here as well, I thought it would be related.\nAlso, this was an issue in earlier versions as well. Just the Safari though. . I updated repo and live demo. I replaced native promise with Axios. I've added some logs, and on iOS 10.2 Safari I get\n...\nload completed, setting texture\ntexture.key before ball-green\ntexture.key after 4uuhz0jfzwrwcgknmfxhzi\nwhile the ball is blue. On Windows Chrome it works as expected.\n~~I'm working with dynamic online data generated on the back-end, that's why I'm not loading images during scene preload~~. I've replaced using Loader with directly adding it to the Texture Manager, no change on the result. (thanks for the tip tho!). Issue is not with the loading/promises but rather SVGs themselves, moved to separate ticket.. Issue is not with the loading/promises but rather SVGs themselves, moved to separate ticket.. ",

I didn't restart the computer or anything (it was on over night).  Nothing in the project has changed since last running it.  So this is clearly a bit more random than it seemed.  The times that I've had this issue it has been consistently the same sprites causing the issues (I've seen this issue on three separate occasions of the last couple of weeks).  So I am surprised that the background that was failing yesterday is now suddenly working.. Another follow up.  I also just opened a different game that was having the same issue and that too is now working perfectly.  I am wondering if it might be something to do with Angular 4 (which I am using).  I have sometimes seen it require a full recompile rather than a reload for newly updated assets to be properly included.  The only difference I can see this morning is that I recompiled the Angular app rather than just letting it live reload.. Nice one, thanks.  I look forward to hearing what the Phaser Gurus say :). ",

    "srobertson421": "Think I'm getting closer to the issue source. Seems like when the state.start call is getting placed into the StateManager queue. However somewhere along the line the queue gets cleared before the processQueue process starts.. Looks like this line is the issue. The length is getting set to 0 before the rest of the queue can be processed, seems to be a race condition:\nhttps://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/master/src/scene/SceneManager.js#L176. It would appear that by the time the stop('LoadScene') and start('MenuScene') calls have entered the queue the loop finishes and the StateManager._queue is then cleared by setting the length to 0. This in turn means that the next time processQueue is called via the update loop the queue has been cleared prematurely. Still looking on how to solve this. @Kitanga Ya, I have about 5 scenes that should load in succession. The 3rd scene's methods never get called as the StateManager queue gets cleared before they are able to execute. Here is a screenshot of my logs as they run. It starts in the BootScene, then hits the ScenePlugin class for LoadScene, which queues the start and stop calls, then the LoadScene runs, hits the ScenePlugin for the MenuScene, the start and stop for MenuScene are queued up,  then at this point the initial processQueue loop has finished with the 2 operations from before, but didn't run the 2 new operations from the MenuScene, finally the queue gets cleared when the queueLength variable is at a value of 2, while the actual length of the _queue is 4\n\n. #3299 closed..

    "wtravO": "@photonstorm Thoughts on this?. I see.  Is it necessary that the Group call the update methods for its children? As long as all of the preUpdate's are ran before any of the update's, it should have the same effect.  The Group.preUpdate would simply do the prep and GameObject.update would take that prep and apply it automatically.  This would also apply to Container possibly, once that is implemented.. I like the idea of adding an argument to setActive.  Seems to be the most unobtrusive way of handling this.  I'll work on that now and revise my PR.  Then we can go from there.. This commit was closed due to upcoming alternative approaches to this issue.. https://www.w3schools.com/tags/canvas_font.asp\nWouldn't the above be applicable in this situation?  At least for basic support - aka paragraph formatting.\nPerhaps we could add a class that encapsulates multiple text objects like a wrapper.  Almost like a zone for text.  Then you could add an array of text objects as children that each have their own formatting, the wrapper would simply control the positioning/word wrapping of the objects.\nWould be a good thing to possibly extend off Containers once they're live.. ```\nconst textZone = new Phaser.GameObjects.TextZone([\n    {\n        text: \"Lorem ipsum\",\n        fontFace: \"Arial\",\n        fontSize: \"12px\",\n        fontWeight: \"bold\"\n    },\n    {\n        text: \" dummy text\",\n        fontFace: \"Arial\",\n        fontSize: \"14px\",\n        fontWeight: \"normal\"\n    }\n]);\ntextZone.maxWidth = 150;\n```\nSomething syntactically like the above example..

On the contrary, performance degrades when using base64 data multiple times.\nHope this helps.. ",

My builds would take a really long time since Typescript was rebuilding all of Phaser every time I made a change to my game's files.

Tested against 3.11.0-beta1. It's working as expected. thanks. Hi Rich ,\nThank you :) I've gone through the docs prior to opening this issue. However what i do not understand is, if the mask does not apply to the children in the container at all,  it should not to any of the children.\nBut as i explained above , I can see the mask being applied ( as intended )  to the Image objects nested in the containers, but the text objects are not even being rendered at all.\nAlso from #3491 , I see a quote mentioning \n\"When we add Containers you can apply a mask at the root level (i.e. the Container itself can have a mask, which will impact all children)\". By this I understand that mask also gets applied to the children in a Container. Please correct me if i'm wrong.\n. Hi Rich ,\nIf you require a code example i'm happy to provide it. Please let me know. Currently we have project considerably complex that runs on Phaser V2 . We are planning to migrate it to V3. We see some hurdles like blurred text mentioned in 3528, which I'd hope will be fixed with ScaleManager implementation. The mask in Phaser V2 did work as per our needs in the example mentioned above. These are the only things currently stopping us from migrating to V3. Rest all works pretty awesome . Cheers \ud83d\udc4d . Hi Rich,\nI've come up with an example. Please check it here. The mask applied to the container is Geometry mask. When run on mobile device under CANVAS render mode the mask does not even apply at all and the FPS drops to ~20 also when used BitmapText instead of Text it does not render BitmapText Objects at all. .

At least, this only happens when calling GameObject.setVisible().\n- Getting GameObject.visible would return the Container value, not the GameObject, which is good for the render loop, but bad for users.\nOne way to mitigate this is to set both variables GameObject.visible and GameObject.effectiveVisible and always work internally on the later, but let user read/write the former..

    "cyberhck": "@vegarringdal , I also really like TypeScript, but I don't think you should be investing time and effort on a project which don't want to make a move yet. I had a look into codebase and it's pretty huge, not to mention there are some classes which aren't es6 classes, but different type of class initialized with new Class.\nYes, benefits would be huge, also help JS users, and Typings would always be in sync, how many times you update the js and forget to update typings.\nIf you really really want very strong typing (because so many times JS allows you doing things which isn't very type safe), I think you should also evaluate some other project written in TypeScript, even though you try to make JS project typesafe, there MIGHT be some place, where it's not possible to provide very type safe typings. But if codebase is already in typesafe, it's a breeze.. First I'm sorry if I came across as someone who wants to make this priority or someone who is very irrational and won't understand what maintainers want, that wasn't totally my intention.\nAs far as I understood, this would be an issue one could tackle, or at least give a try to. It didn't even have to be anyone who's actively maintaining this project, say a random joe wants to come up with something which will ensure your client's app doesn't break, and keep your tests passing.\nI thought this would be an issue which will be open for community, and if someone wanted to take a look and come up with something maintainers could take a look and decide.\nIt didn't have to be one big task, of course everyone should understand this is a huge project, no one is going to abandon more important tasks and start converting, that'd be stupid to think.\nIn my mind, maintainers keep on working on what they're good at, while keeping this issue open for someone to try out. If someone finds a way to gradually convert files, while keeping compatibility, then you could decide whether or not you want to take that route.\nI actually came to this issue wanting to make a PR which would migrate to more recent version of JS/TS. My plan of action was to come up with simple build which will distribute phaser in es5/es3, which is what everyone is doing anyway, (I do hope people realize all npm libraries modules published should be in es5/es3 as of now) because a lot of people don't have es6 compatible browser. \"If were to come up with a way that it'll keep your customers happy and move your classes one by one, would you have a look at it?\" is what I would have mentioned, I totally dropped the ball there, sorry.\nBTW: I'd have to disagree your point about: \"None of popular library or framework uses TypeScript\", I'd have to say Angular, Aurelia, ember, vscode, monacco editor (although vscode is using monacco), native script, ionic, Babylon.js (ironic that they have js in their name), apollo client, upterm, github desktop, oclif (supposedly good cli framework), and many others, I agree that some of these might not be that popular, but I'd give them a pat on the back anyway.\nBut if you're saying that at no point of this project will there be both kinds of classes, then you're right, in that case it'd be have to be big task and would take a huge chunk of time (I don't think that's a good idea though). In that case it makes sense, thanks.. ",

Interesting thing that under 3.11 scrolling is smooth even on iphone 6.. @sachinhosmani  did you try to scroll the list ?. @sachinhosmani yeah but in 3.11.0 the same code works different, you can try to scroll list here https://alexeymolchan.github.io/phaser-scroll/\nAbout your example on my iphone 6 - fps drops to 35 - 44.

    "Kasuko": "Alright, this is coming along nicely, and I have been converting everything to the new Events namespace.\nHowever, when I created Phaser.Input.Events I have come across the problem I feared. Under the Phaser.Input namespace there are actually 3 EventEmitters each managing their own set of events.\n\nPhaser.Input.InputManager#events\nPhaser.Input.InputPlugin\nPhaser.Input.InputPlugin#pluginEvents\n\nShould all the events across those 3 emitters appear in the same Phaser.Input.Events namespace? \nAn even stronger issue arises from the Phaser.Input.Gamepad namespace. Here you have multiple emitters as well.\n\nPhaser.Input.Gamepad.GamepadPlugin\nPhaser.Input.Gamepad.Gamepad\n\nThis is an issue because both of these event emitters have a 'down' event. They are both fired here https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/master/src/input/gamepad/Button.js#L109 and under the current configuration they would both be considered Phaser.Input.Gamepad.Events#DOWN events. But the DOWN event that fires on the Gamepad EventEmitter has different parameters than the DOWN event that fires on the GamepadPlugin, most notably the index vs pad parameter, which means I wouldn't be able to document them accurately.. Hey, I haven't forgotten about this, things are still progressing nicely. It's just quite a bit of work now that there is a lot of reorganization happening as well. I have 114 instances of emit left to document. (Of course I will have to do some git magic to ensure I also update any new events that have arisen since I branched, but I'll deal with that when I finish what's here)\nHowever, I have run into another situation that would require your input.\nThere are several instances of what I would call \"dynamic\" events, where the event is created programatically. \n\nKeyboardPlugin Key Code events\nFile loader complete events\nDataManager data change events\n\nAny thoughts on the preferred way to document these style of events?\nFor the Key code events, I can definitely write out all the events since it is driven from a predetermined list, so it would just be a bunch of copy and paste (most likely what I'll do)\nHowever for things like the File loader which is driven by user defined data at runtime, there is nothing I can do. My instinct would be to provide some kind of function that creates the dynamic event name, so that it's parameters could be documented, though my background is functional programming so that could be a bias :P\nFor now, I will skip these events and continue with the static event documentation.\n. Thanks, sorry about dropping the ball, I got about 50% of the way through all the events when I had some pressing changes at work and couldn't find the time to finish it! I did learn a lot about Phaser through what I did accomplish, and one thing I would like to say is that you write some quality Javascript! Man was it ever a dream to explore! Keep up the great work..

If I just replace phaser.min.js with the older version with no other change the game becomes fast again.. I could, how would I then know what the FPS is? The update() function is what updates the FPS text element on the UI.. I tried that. The problem still persists. The sprite is scaled normally initially, but after a few seconds it dramatically shrinks and stays small. I wonder if it's a memory leak somewhere.\nNext I removed all the text elements (not just the FPS one which is updated every frame) and tried it again and this time, the FPS seems more natural and closer to 60. It seems to have something to do with text.\nI have attached all the assets in my issue opening post if it is of value.\nThanks. I ran it on an iPhone 6 which is an older device than iPhone SE.

For arcade games where you have a relatively small map and you're loading in the entire level, then the cost would be negligible unless you're really pushing the limits of layers and adding indices through individual loops.\nPlatforming levels would likely be non-trivial, but also not entirely burdensome depending on how complex or large the level gets. And I would imagine that arcade games and small to mid-sized platformers do account for a fairly large portion of the tilemaps that get created, thus a lot of the devs simply wouldn't care either way about this implementation.\nBut for anything larger or of higher complexity than a mid-sized platformer, though, and I suspect the difference in loading times would start getting noticeable, and since collisions can be changed on the fly at any time, I can't think of any instance where this would inhibit someone's design..

Yes, I'm aware. Since there's no conflict of reusing them, I was showing each of them to indicate that each one of them was being vetted.\n\nIf changing the texture/frame doesn't affect physics bodies and collisions, then shouldn't the methods describe updating the size of the Game Object be consistent in that? The setSize method says \"Sets the size of this Game Object\" as it's only purpose, and it does affect the collision. The \"size of Game Object\" is repeated in both the setSizeToFrame and setFrame as a default parameter.\n. Well, the issue was raised because of my incorrect assumption that setTexture would update the physics body, which I suppose renders the code and indeed the entire issue irrelevant.\n\nBut I am confused if there is any path that exists to update the physics body when a texture changes, because I've tried using body.updateBounds() after updating the frame, and that doesn't appear to have the desired effect either.\nIs there a sequence / method that does properly update the bounds of the physics body to the existing frame? Perhaps it's my unfamiliarity with the code, but I can't find one in the API. updateBounds() looks like it would be the only relevant method. And if a solution doesn't exist, I'd like to change this issue into a feature request, because that's definitely a feature I would need (and would assume many others would as well?).. Whoops, sorry, I was going to update per your request but I was swamped for the last few days. Thanks for handling it..

    "imilo": "@samid737 , I've created screenshots for you. I'm on Linux if that matters. On the attached image I show Phaser versions 3.10 and 3.12. In v3.12 colors became a little better, but are still darker.\nHere are 2 images for each version:\n- on the left - before FadeOut-FadeIn\n- on the right - after that.\nColor's Hex representation below each image is a color of dark green section. But visually you can see that other colors became a little darker too. Hex colors I've got from Gimp.\n\nOn Firefox this selected color becomes even darker - #709689.\nIf we imagine that there is a loop inside FadeIn where colors become brighter on each iteration - I would guess that the last iteration is being skipped.. I've noticed a similar problem in a stable version too - if one layer is Static and the second is Dynamic - there is also a visible gap between tiles of different layers when camera is moving.\nMy background is light and tiles are dark. So while moving a see the light pixels between tiles of different layers. Looks like static and dynamic layers are being rendered on different timesteps, so at some frames background becomes visible.. Then how do I use static and dynamic layers together and prevent these ugly gaps?. One more finding I have - I see this corrupted font when width/height of canvas (or the whole screen in my case) is an odd number. Maybe for rendering you use somewhere the half of canvas height (and width) and because of this extra 0.5px I get this issue. But if I resize to the even numbers - 95% of issues are gone.\nHowever, not all of them. In some cases still visible artifacts.\nAt the moment as a workaround I use this to round numbers to the closest even numbers:\njavascript\nwidth:  2 * Math.round(window.innerWidth / 2),\nheight: 2 * Math.round(window.innerHeight / 2),\nI hope it will help you to find the source of the issue.. Unfortunately in v3.12.0-beta3 there are still errors. If I uncomment all lines from the example test code in the first post I get several problems:\n\nSprite is still invisible, although light source's radius is good enough;\nConsole error WebGL: INVALID_VALUE: disableVertexAttribArray: index out of range still exists. Line gl.disableVertexAttribArray(location); from WebGLPipeline.js. This error is produced by layer.setPipeline('Light2D');\nTexture key error: Texture key already in use: dude. For some reason this error is not shown every time, mostly when browser's page is opened for the first time.\n\nCan you re-open this issue?!. @photonstorm , what I want to achieve is to prevent objects to disappear from player's screen. And by \"efficient\" I meant CPU/Memory efficient. So you recommend to use a moving smaller light source in front of camera?. @katsos , setTimeScale() seems interesting, I really haven't seen this function before.\nI tried now and there is one issue - if I do this:\n```javascript\nscene.anims.create({\n        key: 'name',\n        frames: scene.anims.generateFrameNumbers('name', { start: 0, end: 47 }),\n        duration: 1000,\n        hideOnComplete: true\n});\nsprite.anims.setTimeScale(1.25);\n```\n.. scaling doesn't happen. I've added logging to the animation's update function and it says that this._timeScale is still 1. Only if I call setTimeScale() after the first animation run _timeScale becomes 1.25.\nHow can I set scaling during the animation's creating or right after it, but before the first run?. @photonstorm , in my case I have only 1 animation for that sprite, so setting a scale could be Ok. Is that possible to set the scale before the first run?\nIf not, then I'll wait for the new setDuration function.\n@katsos , could you add setDuration function if the answer to the question above will be No?. Just to inform - setTimeScale() in the latest release is good enough for me, scale can be modified before the first run, no need for additional functions at this moment.\nWith scarejar's comment about scaling any single animation you can continue here or in the other issue.. I'm Ok with replacing some Phaser's functions in my local environment, fortunately JavaScript easily allows it. I see that SeparateX does a part of job, but if I try to remove/modify lines which change velocity/position - I loose collisions or both objects are still moving. Probably something more needs to be changed. Could you guide me what do I need to edit in Phaser code to disable pushing? Just to stop an object at collision seems to be not a difficult task. ",

    "neon-dev": "Any solution to make tint work with images when using Phaser.CANVAS?. Ah thank you.\nThat's funny. I found such config in another example code weeks ago and gave that a shot, since it looked kinda promising. At that time it didn't work in my project and I thought the property must have been for something else. Unfortunately you also cannot find it anywhere in the documentation.\nWhat I now realize is that I tested the {instances: 2} config with a sound instance and not this.sound.play('name') back then.\nsoundInstance.play() cannot play concurrently by design, which makes sense.\nBefore closing this issue, the documentation should be extended with information about the instances config.. Indeed. Now that I know where to look, I could find it here also. I just expected a config value somewhere in the SoundManager doc when I didn't know what exactly to search for.\nI suggest adding a note here how to play more than one instance. \nAlso the disableWebAudio property for the audio config doesn't seem to exist in the docs. That'd be also a nice place to mention the instances config.. How are we supposed to load these only once or per scene?\nThe JSFiddle may not be the most realistic scenario, but here I can not simply restart the scene. How do I keep track of what to unload before restarting?\nAnother example: A game where you switch through all scenes during normal gameplay and only need certain animations per specific scene. At the end of the game, it restarts by switching back to the first scene again.\nIn this case I'd need to create a special scene just for preloading animations, so they can't get initialized twice. All other assets can be loaded per scene without warnings and it's a great way to encapsulate and organize all \"steps\" of a game.\nIt reduces maintainability of code and more easily leads to dead and unused (but still loaded) resources, if you start ripping that apart.\nI'd rather live with this warning, instead of relocating code outside of its \"proper\" position or adding some superfluous checks to suppress the warning/secondary loading.\nMaybe I'm doing it all wrong, but I though scenes were meant to be these reusable containers in where you can do all kinds of stuff and don't worry much about resource cleanup when switching to the next one.\nI know it's not really that easy, but why shouldn't it? I think it would be more self explanatory if global scope and scene scope were more easily distinguishable from each other (API-wise). If I remember correctly, scene specific event listeners are another thing that are not cleaned up. Meaning each scene reentry adds another handler because the old instance never got unregistered. If that's still the case, at least that must be a bug (?)\nPhaser 3 is not that straight forward in some regards as I had hoped and the still only partly migrated homepage from v2 doesn't make it easier. Often times I feel like there's no example on how to properly organize a Phaser 3 project, etc. Or how and what to share, when and why. This game engine can do all kinds of things, but it's not easy to find out about certain features even if you search and dig really deep. Often the JS doc and labs examples don't tell the whole story.\nAnyway, sorry for OT, just wanted to let you know this too.. Thanks for this clarification, I see.\nI already assumed that most of the stuff in preload functions are available globally, but never tried. And this makes sense. Maybe it'd be wise to treat animations more like assets and should be better loaded via the loader and in a preload function. Current examples load them in the create function, which seems incorrect with the new information I now have.\nAlso it's the first time I read that preloading should happen centralized and not per scene. As you can tell I'm not a Phaser 3 veteran, so the examples I followed made me assume it'd be right way. And it's not that far fetched, since only scenes have preload functions, but the game instance itself has none. So hopefully you agree that it's easy to misinterpret the system with no official multi-scene tutorial (at least I couldn't find one).\nIn my personal opinion, there should at least be clear and easily accessible guides for this. Or better yet as I mentioned, a global preload function and a note in the documentation that scene specific preload functions should be only used in the rare cases where they make sense.. ",

    "mishelen": "Just have finded Phaser 3 Dev Log #122:\n\nTilemap Mini-Tutorial\nThe downside is that if you have a particularly large layer, in terms of quantity of tiles, not pixel dimensions, then that's a lot of data to dump on the GPU every frame, especially considering potentially the vast majority of it isn't even going to be visible after rendering (as it'll be off-screen). Because it dumps the whole buffer every frame there is no culling involved. So they're fast, but equally, a bit dumb. And should likely be avoided if you have got a large layer to deal with. For a single-screen layer though, it's fast. Very fast.\n\nSo in my case it's a bug, or do I really need to use dynamic layers?. Big thanks Richard!\n@photonstorm . Here is another observation. ignore apparently does not work with graphics GameObject.\nUse case the same, I just added graphics inside each container of one group (same code snippet above).. ",

I suspect that Safari might be cleaning up the most recent touch event when you open the drag down menu, which causes the de-sync when you also happen to touch something in a Phaser game at the exact same moment..

    "yandeu": "Solution\n\n\nGreen = Top Bar\nRed = Html Area\nBlue = Phaser Canvas\n\nWhat the problem was\nThe problem is how PWA are started. At first the PWA starts with the top bar active and the html below it. After this, the PWA looks at the manifest.json file and finds the \"display\": \"fullscreen\", entry. It will then remove the top bar and set the html to the full size.\nNow the problem is that the html area resizes, but the Phaser Canvas does not.\nHow to solve this\nThere are two ways to solve this. Either your Phaser game does automatically resize based on the onresize. Or (the simple solution I choose) you just wait a while until the PWA is fully loaded and then create your Phaser instance like so:\nwindow.addEventListener('load', () => {\n  window.setTimeout(() => {\n    const config = {\n      // all your game configs\n    }\n    new Phaser.Game(config)\n  }, 2000)\n})\nPrerequisites\nTo make this work, you need two things. A meta tag with viewport-fit=cover:\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, viewport-fit=cover\" />\n Second, your Phaser scale strategy should already scale to full size on all phone without a notch.\nIn my game I use a very simple scaling strategy. I fix the height, and adjust the width according to the device screen ratio. Like so:\n```\nconst ratio = Math.max(window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, window.innerHeight / window.innerWidth)\nconst DEFAULT_HEIGHT = 720\nconst DEFAULT_WIDTH = ratio * DEFAULT_HEIGHT\nconst config = {\n  // ...\n  scale: {\n    mode: Phaser.Scale.FIT,\n    autoCenter: Phaser.Scale.CENTER_BOTH,\n    width: DEFAULT_WIDTH,\n    height: DEFAULT_HEIGHT\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\nImprovements\nI guess it would be good to know if it is possible to get an event triggered if the PWA has finished loading. But I do not know if there is a native solution to this.\n[I do really hope this helps you finish your game :)]. You got the resolution wrong. The 6s has a dpr of 2 and a native resolution of 750 x 1334.\n2x (375x667)\nWhy don you have this line <meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style\" content=\"black-translucent\"> instead of just removing the status bar.
