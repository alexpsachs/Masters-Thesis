    "vjeux": "Thanks :)\n. Thanks :)\n. Can you explain what's the use case? I'm not really sure I understand what this is useful for.\n. Nice. If you send a pull request that sets it up, I'll gladly accept it :)\n. It's live!\n. Sure, can you update your pull request to rebase and add this additional info?\n. It does not. It pings whoever has the blame. I was actually pretty surprised on react-native as it pinged a lot of people not working at Facebook.\nDo you have a suggestion on how to fix that?\n. Right now the bot doesn't work on private repos because it hits the website and is not authenticated by the way.\n. Would be pretty easy. Pull requests are welcome :)\nAlso, one great thing is that you can run it on existing pull requests and just output the list of names. This way you can iterate over the algorithm to get what you are hoping for.\n. We're using a completely different implementation at Facebook so this is pretty much only for the community. If you want to add configurations, I'm all for it :)\n. If you are going the async route, please use async/await with babel. This makes the code look like it is synchronous\n. Express requires you to manually call res.end(); So you can write the code as\n``` javascript\nasync function doWork() {\n  var org = await queryOrg();\n  // ...\n}\nreq.pipe(bl(function(err, body) {\n  doWork().then(function() { res.end(); })\n}));\n```\n. Async await is using promises under the hood. It's just a 100x better way to write async code. Just try it and I promise you won't want to go back to raw promises ;)\n. Sure, have fun with it.\n. https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/commit/3bfcc0a6187e1788d154ce809b20acbf77aa5351 added a blacklist. Closing this issue. If you want more configuration, please open up another issue :)\n. So good, thanks!\n. Could you rebase your pull request :) The additional info in app.json seems useful\n. Yeah, I originally wanted to develop it on a private repo but sadly there's no apis for blame and diff. The way I used to workaround that on previous projects is to actually go through the normal website auth flow and maintain cookies across requests. (If you are curious, see this PHP project I wrote that does that: https://github.com/vjeux/phpFileDownload )\nIf you feel like implementing this, shouldn't take more than a few hours and be really useful :)\n. Another way to get the blame would be to git clone the repo, do git blame and then do an http request to get the github username (instead of the git email). This would avoid storing the password but be super slow and wasteful.\n. @skyhighwings good point :) Want to give it a try?\n. @skyhighwings the blame info gives you the author as an email but -also the commit- which was responsible. You can query github API for the commit and get the github username from it :)\n. @zackify none from me, but pull requests welcome\n. I'm curious, what message would you like instead? Maybe we can improve the default one.\n. Fixed by https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/pull/31\n. This is the patent file: https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/blob/master/PATENTS\nFor more context on this, I recommend reading this post which explains what it does and why we put it there: https://code.facebook.com/posts/1639473982937255/updating-our-open-source-patent-grant/\n. I have no plans for implementing it but will accept a pull request :)\n. I'm closing this for now since I'm not going to work on it. But feel free to open a pull request if you get it working :)\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Option #2 is currently implemented. However there's a bug where for some reason @none is being filled there somehow. A fix for this would be to just remove 'none' from the list at the end.\n. Fixed: https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/commit/50638bdcb6413b297f2bd292bb9d5ebc752261f4\n. Good catch! Would be pretty simple to implement if you have some time: when the list is done, remove the author before slicing the first three :) Pull request welcome.\n. Sorry, github won't let me because you're not part of the facebook organization :(\n. https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/pull/19 fixed it!\n. You need to host your bot somewhere (heroku is pretty easy to get started with) and add the url where it is hosted at as a webhook.\nIf you get it working and want to submit a pull request with the instructions that would be great\n. I would put console.log in all the places and try to figure out what's going on.\n. @none and rel issue have been fixed and a console.log has been added, so this should be better. Please re-open an issue with a more specific question if needs be :)\n. Sweet, thanks for tackling this! I suggested you a better way\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. While you are at it, do you want to fix the problem where we sometimes return 'none'. Should be as simple as filtering out the user 'none': https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/issues/15\n. This is awesome, thanks a lot for doing this!\nHigh level summary of what I want to be changed, after that, we can ship it :)\n- Use es6 classes and flow annotations\n- Use the array form for curl in order to avoid being susceptible to injections. This is a real threat, it's very easy to send a malicious payload and run arbitrary bash commands with your code as is.\n- Small nits here and there\n. You rock! This is going to be huge :)\n. Awesome, i'll merge it in when I'm home\n. So good, thanks a lot for doing that :)\n. @mikesherov github unfortunately doesn't provide an api to get the blame information. So login is the only option outside of actually git cloning the repo :(\nIf you can figure out a better way, please let me know!\n. @mikesherov: this command gives you the diff (what changed in a pull request), not the blame of a file (who last changed each line)\n. This is still not going to work if people use the https://mention-bot.herokuapp.com/ webhook instructions. Should we ask people to give commit access to the bot and for me to add the login flow there as well?\n. Makes sense\n. Thanks! That's going to be great to have a config file where we can add more stuff :)\nCan you:\n- Rebase because it doesn't conflict\n- Fix the small things I commented on\n- Sign the CLA\nand then I'll merge it in :)\n. Can you also sign the CLA? I can't merge it without it :(\n. Awesome thanks!\n. What is the pull request? i can take a look and see what's going on\n. So, you added a file here. Because there was no pre-existing code, there is no one we can look for in the blame.\nI made the explicit decision of the bot being silent when this happens because we don't want to send an email with absolutely no useful information.\nTry sending a pull request that edits a file instead (which you are not the sole committer on)\n. Can you put console.log everywhere and see where it stops working? :)\n. I don't really want to add more logging than necessary here. If people have trouble setting it up they can add console.log themselves.\nOne thing we could add as logging is for every place where we stop, say why.\nif (data.action !== 'opened') {\n  console.log('Action is ', data.action, ' and not \"opened\", skipping);\n}\n. Send a pull request my way :)\n\nOn Nov 23, 2015, at 9:02 PM, SCaffrey notifications@github.com wrote:\n@vjeux I agree with you. It might be better to add log messages before the res.end() part.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Exact\n. Sure, if you implement it, I'll take it :)\n. I'm closing this since I'm not going to work on it, but feel free to send a pull request if you get it working :)\n. Yay, thanks for cleaning up after me :)\n. Can you sign the CLA? I can't merge it without :(\n. Yay it's green, thanks a lot!\n\n\n. You're welcome :) I initially wrote it for react-native as I was trying to figure out ways to make us review more pull requests and it's been working extremely well for us. I've been regularly asked how non-fb projects could use it so I ended up porting it to javascript (from php/hack) and open sourcing it over the weekend :p\n. Thanks :)\n. Is there a real need for this? It seems to me like a lot of heavyweight work that's not going to be very useful. Closing for now, but feel free to comment if you really want something like this.\n. Can you provide a more complete explanation of how you want the integration to look like? I'm closing this but I'll re-open if you reply :)\n. Thanks for the pull request, made a lot of comments, but once you address them it'll be glorious :)\n. Thanks!\n. Both work for me\n. Thanks!\n. I actually like this form better :) Thanks for the pull request!\n. A pull request to fix this is welcome :)\n. Fixed by https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/pull/36\n. If you fix the nits i'll pull it in, thanks!\n. if you add another argument, the blame looks something like\n- previousLine,\n- newLine\nSo you are now associated the blame for the previous line even though you did not change it. Also it clobbers the pull request because it highlights lines that did not change.\nFinally, small thing but it's easier to move things around as you don't need to remove the comma from the last line and add it back to the other place.\n. We are also pushing trailing comma for function calls and arguments to be part of the javascript standard. It's currently in stage 2.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks! English is hard :)\n. Thanks!\n. Looks like @dflynn15 implemented this as part of his bigger pull request. I'll close this one and merge the other one if you don't mind :)\n. Nice! Didn't know it was possible :)\n. Good catch, I forgot that it could happen. The way it is setup right now (I updated the code recently) is that we ignore all those 'none': https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/blob/master/mention-bot.js#L295-L297\nI think it's the right behavior since the goal of this is to ping people but if there's no github username this ping won't do anything.\nLet me know if you think we should change the behavior to something else, in the meantime i'm going to close the issue :)\n. So good, thanks a lot for the pull request, this is going to be very useful!\n. Thanks a lot!\n. The changelog is all shiny now!\n\n. Thanks!\n. Do you want to submit a pull request to fix it?\n. Thanks :) Can't wait to see it!\n. Agreed with @agubler suggestion\n. Haha, this bot just has hardcoded responses! But would be super cool to use M ai on github :p\n. Pull request welcome :)\n. Closing this as there's been no activity.\n. I can reproduce on node v0.10.16, but if you upgrade to node 4, it works fine. My guess is that node now supports backtick natively so babel doesn't transform it anymore.\nFew things that you can do:\n- Upgrade to node 4\n- Update the list of transforms to transform backticks so that it works on node 0.10\n. @friss mind sending a pull request?\n. So good! I'll review it tomorrow :)\n. Travis failed because it doesn't pass flow correctly :)\nmention-bot.js:26\n 26:     require('child_process')\n         ^ call of method `execFile`\n 31:           resolve(stdout);\n                       ^^^^^^ Buffer. This type is incompatible with\n395:       resolve: (result: Promise<R> | R) => void,\n                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ union type. See: /tmp/flow/flowlib_1f872210/core.js:395\n. This is really good, after you fix the comments i'll merge it in, Thanks!\n. Looks like flow is still not passing\n. Sorry I was busy today, nice that you found a fix! Waiting for travis and will merge if green\n. Yay thanks\n. Thanks\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks! Need to figure out why flow doesn't work with require('./package.json')\n. So, flow doesn't understand require('.json'), https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/620 I'll merge it in and figure out a way to fix it!\nThanks for the pull request!\n. Fixed the flow issue here: https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/commit/32cafebc926d88c05e99d6abdd1dec91d39af086\n. Fixed the extra .com here: https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/commit/b3442c5e66f4c540a15e426f35700a5d5ab70ef2\n. Thanks for fixing this! @bbenoist yup, would be better, I'll send a fix for that shortly\n. Done: https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/commit/0ac7a218ccacc789bd6fe92279d55e1a6215bc9f\n. Thanks!\n. This is the line that's doing this console.log:\nhttps://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/blob/master/server.js#L152-L155\nThere are two ways to debug this:\n1) Easy but slow way: you add console.logs everywhere, do a git commit/git push heroku master, recreate a pull request and using heroku logs --tail see what's going on and repeat.\n2) A bit more annoying but faster way: In https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/blob/master/server.js#L100 add a console.log(body) and push to heroku. Create the pull request and look at the logs. Create a file on your local machine with the content of the body in a file called body.webhook. Then run the server locally with GITHUB_TOKEN=insert_token_here npm start and do \ncurl -X POST -d @body.webhook http://localhost:5000/\nEvery time you need to change the debug code, just kill / re-run the server and re-run the curl.\n. Oh noes :(\nWould be nice to add proper error logging when the authentication fails. So that it shows up in the logs. Want to send a pull request?\n. Perfect! If you are bored during the weekend, you know what to do ;)\n. Thanks! If you fix the two small nits i'll merge it in :)\n. Hmmm actually did you try it out?\nI don't think that it works. Authentication is asynchronous so it wouldn't throw synchronously. Also, if it actually threw an error then the entire node process would be killed with the correct error. But that's not what was described in the issue.\n. Either way is fine for me. Both are not going to work and the person will have to look the logs anyway to figure out what happened\n. How did you setup the bot? Maybe you have an older version?\n. Hmm this is sad then, I really thought it was fixed.\n. I realized that I didn't push things to heroku in a long time. Probably didn't pick up the changes. Let me know if it's still not working.\n. I have no idea I'm sorry :( Can you try to add console.logs and figure out where it breaks? Please re-open if you have more information.\n. Check out the alwaysNotifyForPaths option in .mention-bot file\nhttps://github.com/facebook/mention-bot#configuration\n. I don't know what's going on here :x Can you try to investigate further and see if there's something special with those pull requests?\nPlease re-open if you have more information.\n. Thanks, sounds useful :)\n. Can you actually make the config optional?\n. Thanks!\n. I'm going to close this one down until progress is made. Please feel free to open a new one in the future :)\n. Thanks! Feel free to put the image in dockerhub and make me admin. I have never used docker but seems like this is the new hotness :)\n. Nice!\n. Sounds good thanks :)\n. No plans to implement anything of that sort but if you implement it and it makes sense, I see don't see a reason not to take it\n. Thanks that sounds useful :)\nCan you sign the cla and i'll merge it in!\n. Awesome!\n. Why would you want to do it on synchronize? Do you want the bot to comment every time the person updates the pull request?\n. Why would you listen to anything but \"opened\"?\n. I don't have any plan to work on that but if you want it to happen, should be pretty easy, the code is already decoupled with a server and the logic. If you end up with something that is working, i'd happily take the pull request :)\n. Thanks!\n. Sorry about that, i'm using the free plan for mention bot on heroku and they turn it off a few hours a day. Maybe i'll pay it up but that's a bit annoying :x\n. I just upgraded to hobby which is indeed $7/month. Please let me know if it's still broken for time to time\n. Okay, so turns out that the bot got flagged by the bot detection script from github (how ironic). I contacted their support channel to get it back up.\n\"One of our mostly harmless robots seems to think you are not a human.\nBecause of that, it\u2019s hidden your profile from the public. If you really are human, please contact support to have your profile reinstated. We promise we won\u2019t require DNA proof of your humanity.\"\n. Github unbanned the bot. Should be good to go now :) Let me know if it is not the case\n. Thanks for the pull request, this seems like a very useful feature indeed! Sorry I've been super slow to look at it but with React.js Conf and my parental leave I've been pretty busy.\nDo you have hope that the babel issue is going to be fixable? I'd hate to get travis red if we can avoid it :x\n. This is a really good pull request, thanks for submitting. As soon as the flow error is fixed I'll merge it in!\n. Great! Ping me when your pull request is updated and i'll merge it :)\n. Eagerly waiting for travis to pass :)\n. Hmmm, travis seems to be stuck, can you send an update, maybe it'll make it work again\n. https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/blob/master/.travis.yml#L5\nI have no idea how to bust the cache though\n. Thanks! I cleared the cache and re-ran the build, fingers crossed\n. Sorry it's taking so long :(\n. Omg it's green!\n\n. See https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/issues/87#issuecomment-189933420\nHopefully it'll be back up soon. If it's critical for you, you can run your own instance and hope that it won't get flagged while the official one gets back online.\n. This is a bit brittle to check this for all the call sites. What would be better is to make a file config.js that returns all the fields and uses the env variable if exists.\nThis way we don't forget to check the env variable the next time we use an attribute.\nAlso, would be great to have env variables for all the options, instead of a few arbitrary that you decided?\n. Isn't there a way with docker to change the package.json values?\n. Okay makes sense. Can you add a way to load the data from a json file passed as argument instead of relying on the env variables?\nnpm run mention-bot --config ./config.json\nthis way we don't have to have 2 ways to specify configs, we can either use package.json (default) or config.json\n. Awesome thank you!\n. This should be pretty easy to hack into the existing code if you are so inclined.\nHowever, I would warn against doing that. This is going to spam the hell out of all the people in that contributor list as they are going to be automatically subscribed to the thread. I would suggest you to try it as is and if it doesn't work, then modify the script to do it.\n. @waldyrious thanks for the comment, now I understand it better :)\n. I'm sorry but I don't have the time to help you investigate what is going wrong :( I'm going to close down this issue, but feel free to keep posting here and others to help out.\n. The file is literally called .travis.yml, you don't need to add a comment at the top of the file saying that it's about Travis :)\n. Hey, could you rebase?\n. The file is literally called Dockerfile, no need to have a comment at the top of the file saying that it's a dockerfile :)\n. I'm sorry but I don't have the time to help you investigate what is going wrong :( I'm going to close down this issue, but feel free to keep posting here and others to help out.\n. Flow requires the file to be named .json.js\n. I didn't write this feature so I don't know much about it. If you could ping the person that did to get context that would be great. Otherwise if you have a pull request that fixes the problem, i'd be glad to take it\n. Thanks! Sorry for the super long wait, I feel bad! It completely slipped my mind.\n. Thanks a lot for the high quality pull request!\n. Thanks! That's what happens when you don't have eslint setup as a ci tool and you accept people code :)\n. mention bot is on npm as a pure module. You should be able to depend on that to build your integration\n. Great!\nMind doing the small changes and i'll merge it in\n. Because the handling of the message involves pluralization and english thing like \"and\". But I agree that would be nice to have a small config like this if you don't intend to change it dramatically\n. first one seems simpler and likely going to solve the problem\n. Great! Can you just remove the comments that don't add any value and i'll merge it in. Thanks :)\n. Oops sorry\n. Thanks for the pr (sorry for the delay, I was in vacation). I agree that USERNAME looks better but let's make sure we document what exists today.\n. Should be good\n(511) >> git push heroku master\nEverything up-to-date\n. I'm sorry but I don't have the time to help you investigate what is going wrong :( I'm going to close down this issue, but feel free to keep posting here and others to help out.\n. I'm happy to accept this if you implement it, but I'm not going to myself :)\n. @hunkim yeah, would need to build some sort of cron that checks if the pr is old, not been checked yet and has no comments from the org owner and then use the cli api for the bot to run it\n. Also note that the bot checks the blame against master, so if you do it a week after, it is probably going to return incorrect results. A safer solution would be to run the bot instantly and store the people that it would have mentioned and then x days after, comment with those people.\n. What you are asking for is pretty easy. I'm sure that you can get it working if you spend an hour or two\n. Thanks, I'll merge as soon as small nits are fixed\n. Thanks :)\n. Would be useful! Happy to merge this if you send a pull request\n. It's in, thanks @mattpickle !\n. Sounds like a great idea indeed. I'd take it if you send a pull request\n. Fixed by https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/pull/130\n. Hey! This is absolutely a legitimate concern. As with any bot that sends email notifications, there should be a way to turn it off.\nI've been thinking about many ways to achieve this:\n- as you suggested, a git repo where you can send a pull request. The issue with this is that it's a lot of steps to unsubscribe. Ideally i'd like it to be a one click operation.\n- a website where you can unsubscribe. The issue here is that we would need to get you to log in which is not a very good user experience. You want to unsubscribe, logging in to do that seems sketchy.\n- go to github and block the mention-bot user.\nI think the last one is actually a really good solution and should be promoted in the official documentation.\nLet me know what you think\n. I've added a repo called how-to-unsubscribe on the mention-bot account. It should fix your use case. If the project gets a wider adoption, we'll probably want to invest in more fine-grained control but that is out of scope for me now.\n\nhttps://github.com/mention-bot/how-to-unsubscribe\n\n. For 1), I'd recommend adding a setting in mention-bot to filter people you want.\nFor 2), yeah it's unfortunate. We'd need something more sofisticated that I won't have the time to work on anytime soon.\n. If you implement it, I'll be glad to accept it :)\n. Yay, thanks :)\nI'll merge it in if you add the trailing comma\n. Thanks, the code looks really good \ud83d\udc4d \n. Could you add a description on your pull request? Why do you want to add those changes? Also, having one commit instead of the 9 currently would be better! Thanks\n. Closing since no responses. Please feel free to create a new one with the comments addressed if you want to see it merged\n. Thanks a lot for the pull request, it is really high quality! Apart from all the minor syntax nits, this is good to go!\n. Thanks! Sorry for the lack of updates :)\n. I'm doing a bad job at pushing the latest version to heroku when I merge pull requests. I'll push it today\n. I just pushed the new version\n. Mention bot works only on pull requests and analyze the blame to figure out who should be reviewing it. I have a lot of ideas for how to deal with issues but this is out of scope for this project.\nI would encourage you to start your own bot and do that. It shouldn't be very difficult to implement and has the potential to be highly impactful!\n. Grrr, must have been caught again by github bot detection. I'll re-submit a request when I get back home.\n. It got enabled back by github!\n. Thanks!\n. Unfortunately, there is no github api to fetch the blame information, so we are using the normal user login flow and parsing out the html.\nIf you know of a better way, please let me know!\n. Looks good, thanks!\n. Very smart!\n. @jcsmorais thanks for flagging! Is this a use case that you have to work on multiple branches but have the config only on master?\nWhile it may break people, I feel like this is a good change. I think you want to read mention-bot from the branch you are in, not from master.\n. Is this going to affect you?\n. Oh ok, sorry about this :(\n. I just bumped the major version on npm, so it won't affect existing users from npm.\n. This is actually causing many legitimate pull requests to fail, I'm reverting this change.\nhttps://github.com/crits/crits_services/pull/242\n{ [Error: {\"message\":\"No commit found for the ref patch-33\",\"documentation_url\":\"https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/contents/\"}]\n  message: '{\"message\":\"No commit found for the ref patch-33\",\"documentation_url\":\"https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/contents/\"}',\n  code: 404 }\n. My usual line of thoughts for this is to implement whatever is needed for your project and avoid theorizing on what others could maybe want in the future. When that comes up, then try to adapt their use cases ;)\nIf you send a pull request to add support for whatever you need, I'll gladly accept it\n. Perfect!\n. Good call, if you send a pull request to update the doc i'll merge it in :)\n. Good call!\nWhat about \"history\" instead of \"annotation\"?\n. Sounds good! I had no idea that git annotate was a thing :)\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Async await is awesome :)\n. This would be very useful indeed. I have no plans of actually implementing that but I would not be opposed of accepting a pull request for it\n. I'm not planning to implement support for it as I do not have such a use case but if you make it work and send a pull request, I'd be happy to accept it\n. This is weird, thanks for the report, I'll investigate.\n. I checked and we receive two http requests about each pull request. So it's something on the github side. Could you remove the webhook, try a pull request and maybe re-add it if it doesn't fix it. (The old reboot the computer technique and prays it works)\nI looked at the logs and you are the only project I could see that behaves like this fyi.\n. Cool, glad you figured it out :)\n. Nice, so easy!\nFeel free to add a test if you want, but I'd be happy to take it in as is.\nCould you sign the CLA and I'll pull it in, thanks!\n. Yup, I can see you have signed the CLA, thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Hmm this is weird\nhttps://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/blob/2652842e6088625b140f822476f71ea3c1744fcf/server.js#L150-L154\nthis is the line that is causing the issue. I'm not really sure why it wouldn't work out of the top of my head. Could you add console.log in the path and see if there's any useful info?\n. Thanks for the pr.\nHave you figured out why the mention-bot file was required? This is not expected. I'd love to fix this bug :)\n. No worries, I like when people are working on stuff, makes me happy :)\n. Thanks! Sorry about this \n. Thanks!\n. Can you add console.log in various places and try to figure out what is happening? I don't have access to a ghe instance unfortunately so all the code in the repo was contributed by external contributors\n. Awesome investigation!\nFor 1), a pr would be awesome thanks!\nFor 2), do you know if there's a way to only get the first 1meg of data and just drop the rest? For such a big pull request we just want to get some data, processing everything is just a waste of resources.\n. Maybe it actually never worked...\n. Enjoy your vacation! Feel free to send this patch when you come back :)\n. Thanks! I'm going to take this pr but i'd love to truncate the request to the first meg instead of making it grow unbounded. Do you know if it's possible?\n. Hey @ifuller1, sorry for the lack of review, I was in PTO last week!\nI like the idea of being able to read things from the environment but it feels wrong to me to reimplement a custom way of parsing all the different fields and to clobber the global namespace of environment variables with all the possible options we have and will have in the future.\nWhat do you think about supporting MENTION_BOT_CONFIG environment variable that is a json string that we JSON.parse instead?\nIf you agree with this approach, I'd love to review a pull request with it :)\n. Sounds good :)\n. (Sorry for the CLA Signed bot spam, we're trying to figure out what's going on here!)\n. Thanks a lot for the pull request! I've tried to give you a lengthy review to explain my thought process, I can't wait to see it shipped :)\n. Perfect thanks!\nThis branch has conflicts that must be resolved\nDo you mind rebasing so that I can merge it? :)\n. Feel free to tell me about the other use cases you have and we can figure out what to do with them :)\n. Hmm, I still see the test file and the implementation file that is no longer needed?\n. Yay thanks for keeping up with me!\n. For your ideas, I'd love to have a kind of lint-on-demand project where you can plug in all this kind of rules but this is indeed not something I want to merge inside of mention-bot. I'm trying to keep it focused on finding ways to mention potential reviewers, which is already something complicated as you can see by the list of options supported :)\n. Thanks @shaneog !\n. The github api doesn't have a way to get the blame information, so we're querying the normal website for it, which requires a normal authentication and doesn't let us use the token unfortunately :(\n. Hey @cyberdelia, sorry for the super late response. I do not think that abandoning the blame is the right approach, but you make an excellent point with \"also tend to give reviewers that have a overall more \"fresher\" point of view on the code being changed\".\nIn the fb-internal version of mention-bot we are now applying a coefficient based on time on every line of code. If the line of code has been written more than 8 months ago, we ignore it entirely. Then, we do a linear interpolation for 8 months being 0 to now being worth 350 points.\nThis is working much better and I would love to accept a pull request that implements it on this project.\n@StephanBijzitter mention-bot is activated on this project. The way it is implemented is that there's a fixed buffer size for the http request and if the pull request you are requesting is bigger than that it crashes and drops the request. This is not ideal and a pull request to make it read whatever has been downloaded within that fixed size would be appreciated.\nHowever, in practice, this only happens for giant pull requests that change everything, which are going to be highly debated and the people involved are going to see it anyway.\nI'm going to go ahead and close this pull request as I don't think it's worth losing all the logic. But I'm glad that you were able to use this project as a basis in order to reimplement it in a way that suits your needs and thanks for all the time and efforts you've spent on it!\n. We should get GitHub to provide support for accessing the blame information through their API. Here's a random attempt: https://twitter.com/Vjeux/status/783783705722494977\nBy the way, feel free to use this pull request for your use case, that's the great thing about open source :)\n. Hey, sorry about the long delay. I would go with c. I don't want to do a breaking change for this.\nFeel free to send a pull request, thanks!\n. Thanks :)\n. @waldyrious thanks for the suggestion, I'm down for it. Can you send a pull request to update it? Thanks!\n. I need to push the new version to heroku, I was waiting for this pull request to do another push :)\n. Thanks!\n. Okay, it has been deployed to heroku, should be good to go. Let me know if it doesn't work.\n. Sounds useful! Thanks!\nI haven't done a good review but I trust you and the unit test you wrote :)\n. Grrr, github must have banned the bot again :(\n. Just sent a support request. In the past it took ~24h for them to reinstate the bot\n. Yay, thank you!\n. Hey, I'm sorry but I don't have the time to look into it. Would be nice if you could run your own instance and put console.log in places and troubleshot what's going on. Sorry about this!\n. Arg, looks like the transpilation step is broken before we publish to npm. @gyandeeps do you know why that would be?\n. Thanks!. Closing since there hasn't been any update in a while. Please feel free to reopen it if you are making progress, this feature would be great to have :). Oops, sorry about it. If you fix the conflicts I'll merge it in. So sorry :(. Thanks!\n. Omg, thanks for doing this!\n. Unfortunately, all the settings are based on the repository and it kind of sucks to send a pull request to get you unsubscribed.\nYou can get rid of all the notifications at once by following those instructions: https://github.com/mention-bot/how-to-unsubscribe\nI'm not really sure how to make it more obvious. Feedback welcome! Sorry about this experience :(\n. Hey @jeffreyleeon, sorry it took me a few days to review this. Unfortunately, the JSON specification disallows trailing commas. I would rather not start supporting invalid JSON there.\nHowever, it would be awesome to report back on the pull request that the configuration was invalid so that it's easy to spot the error.\nWould you mind sending a pull request for that instead? Thanks!. @jeffreyleeon thanks! I will review it more quickly this time!. Hey, thanks for reaching out!\nI think that there are two issues here:\n1) .mention-bot file only accepts valid json and our example in the README is not because there's a trailing comma and comments. https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/pull/186#issuecomment-263097516 is tracking sending a message when the file has an invalid format.\n2) mention-bot doesn't mention yourself. Can you find someone to do a commit on the file you are trying to modify such that it appears in the blame?\nSorry about that! Hopefully after those two things it'll work for you!. Would love if you could send a pull request to put it where you would have likely read it :). Yay, perfect thanks :)\nI'll push it to the live instance this evening. Awesome! Thanks, this is an awesome output. Please tweak the little quote and i'll merge it in :). YAY. Sounds awesome indeed! I won't have the time to work on it anytime soon but would love to see it happening.. Mention-bot is already logged with a user token so we can send normal http requests like a user would if you want ;). Thanks for your PRs!. That would be awesome indeed. I won't likely implement it myself but would welcome a pull request for it. Thanks! Looks like this repo got turned private. I'm trying to hunt down why it happened. Sorry about that!. Thanks!. Omg, so good, thanks a lot <3. Thanks!. Good catch. I'm happy to review a pull request if you can get it working :). Thanks!. Thanks for the report! Would you be interested in sending a pull request to fix it by any chance? :). Awesome thanks!. Thank you!. Thank you!. Awesome! You are the best. I was about to fix them at some point but I'm glad you just did :). Strange, I just restarted the build.. Let's try to ship it and see if we get an email that yells at us :p. If you can fix it, that's would be awesome and I'll merge the pull request!. Thank you!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Awesome, that would be more than welcome!. Thanks!. Would you be able to add tests that were not working and are now fixed? This way we don't break them in the future?. If you add tests, I'll happily merge this, thanks for working on it!. Thanks! Once travis is green, I'll merge it :). Yay!. Oh noes :( Would anyone be interested in fixing it and putting it back up?. You can run a local version via heroku and see what happens.. Sorry about that. What happened is that Github banned the bot account and I contacted their support to re-enable it, which they just did.. What we do inside of facebook but haven't ported it to the js version is to give more weight based on time of the blame. If the line you wrote is more than 8 months old, it doesn't count, and a line that has been committed yesterday is worth 10x more. With a linear interpolation between the two, it gave some good results.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Looks like tests are no longer passing.. I just opened the blame on github and saved it.. Thanks :)\n. Thanks :)\n. Can you explain what's the use case? I'm not really sure I understand what this is useful for.\n. Nice. If you send a pull request that sets it up, I'll gladly accept it :)\n. It's live!\n. Sure, can you update your pull request to rebase and add this additional info?\n. It does not. It pings whoever has the blame. I was actually pretty surprised on react-native as it pinged a lot of people not working at Facebook.\nDo you have a suggestion on how to fix that?\n. Right now the bot doesn't work on private repos because it hits the website and is not authenticated by the way.\n. Would be pretty easy. Pull requests are welcome :)\nAlso, one great thing is that you can run it on existing pull requests and just output the list of names. This way you can iterate over the algorithm to get what you are hoping for.\n. We're using a completely different implementation at Facebook so this is pretty much only for the community. If you want to add configurations, I'm all for it :)\n. If you are going the async route, please use async/await with babel. This makes the code look like it is synchronous\n. Express requires you to manually call res.end(); So you can write the code as\n``` javascript\nasync function doWork() {\n  var org = await queryOrg();\n  // ...\n}\nreq.pipe(bl(function(err, body) {\n  doWork().then(function() { res.end(); })\n}));\n```\n. Async await is using promises under the hood. It's just a 100x better way to write async code. Just try it and I promise you won't want to go back to raw promises ;)\n. Sure, have fun with it.\n. https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/commit/3bfcc0a6187e1788d154ce809b20acbf77aa5351 added a blacklist. Closing this issue. If you want more configuration, please open up another issue :)\n. So good, thanks!\n. Could you rebase your pull request :) The additional info in app.json seems useful\n. Yeah, I originally wanted to develop it on a private repo but sadly there's no apis for blame and diff. The way I used to workaround that on previous projects is to actually go through the normal website auth flow and maintain cookies across requests. (If you are curious, see this PHP project I wrote that does that: https://github.com/vjeux/phpFileDownload )\nIf you feel like implementing this, shouldn't take more than a few hours and be really useful :)\n. Another way to get the blame would be to git clone the repo, do git blame and then do an http request to get the github username (instead of the git email). This would avoid storing the password but be super slow and wasteful.\n. @skyhighwings good point :) Want to give it a try?\n. @skyhighwings the blame info gives you the author as an email but -also the commit- which was responsible. You can query github API for the commit and get the github username from it :)\n. @zackify none from me, but pull requests welcome\n. I'm curious, what message would you like instead? Maybe we can improve the default one.\n. Fixed by https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/pull/31\n. This is the patent file: https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/blob/master/PATENTS\nFor more context on this, I recommend reading this post which explains what it does and why we put it there: https://code.facebook.com/posts/1639473982937255/updating-our-open-source-patent-grant/\n. I have no plans for implementing it but will accept a pull request :)\n. I'm closing this for now since I'm not going to work on it. But feel free to open a pull request if you get it working :)\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Option #2 is currently implemented. However there's a bug where for some reason @none is being filled there somehow. A fix for this would be to just remove 'none' from the list at the end.\n. Fixed: https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/commit/50638bdcb6413b297f2bd292bb9d5ebc752261f4\n. Good catch! Would be pretty simple to implement if you have some time: when the list is done, remove the author before slicing the first three :) Pull request welcome.\n. Sorry, github won't let me because you're not part of the facebook organization :(\n. https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/pull/19 fixed it!\n. You need to host your bot somewhere (heroku is pretty easy to get started with) and add the url where it is hosted at as a webhook.\nIf you get it working and want to submit a pull request with the instructions that would be great\n. I would put console.log in all the places and try to figure out what's going on.\n. @none and rel issue have been fixed and a console.log has been added, so this should be better. Please re-open an issue with a more specific question if needs be :)\n. Sweet, thanks for tackling this! I suggested you a better way\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. While you are at it, do you want to fix the problem where we sometimes return 'none'. Should be as simple as filtering out the user 'none': https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/issues/15\n. This is awesome, thanks a lot for doing this!\nHigh level summary of what I want to be changed, after that, we can ship it :)\n- Use es6 classes and flow annotations\n- Use the array form for curl in order to avoid being susceptible to injections. This is a real threat, it's very easy to send a malicious payload and run arbitrary bash commands with your code as is.\n- Small nits here and there\n. You rock! This is going to be huge :)\n. Awesome, i'll merge it in when I'm home\n. So good, thanks a lot for doing that :)\n. @mikesherov github unfortunately doesn't provide an api to get the blame information. So login is the only option outside of actually git cloning the repo :(\nIf you can figure out a better way, please let me know!\n. @mikesherov: this command gives you the diff (what changed in a pull request), not the blame of a file (who last changed each line)\n. This is still not going to work if people use the https://mention-bot.herokuapp.com/ webhook instructions. Should we ask people to give commit access to the bot and for me to add the login flow there as well?\n. Makes sense\n. Thanks! That's going to be great to have a config file where we can add more stuff :)\nCan you:\n- Rebase because it doesn't conflict\n- Fix the small things I commented on\n- Sign the CLA\nand then I'll merge it in :)\n. Can you also sign the CLA? I can't merge it without it :(\n. Awesome thanks!\n. What is the pull request? i can take a look and see what's going on\n. So, you added a file here. Because there was no pre-existing code, there is no one we can look for in the blame.\nI made the explicit decision of the bot being silent when this happens because we don't want to send an email with absolutely no useful information.\nTry sending a pull request that edits a file instead (which you are not the sole committer on)\n. Can you put console.log everywhere and see where it stops working? :)\n. I don't really want to add more logging than necessary here. If people have trouble setting it up they can add console.log themselves.\nOne thing we could add as logging is for every place where we stop, say why.\nif (data.action !== 'opened') {\n  console.log('Action is ', data.action, ' and not \"opened\", skipping);\n}\n. Send a pull request my way :)\n\nOn Nov 23, 2015, at 9:02 PM, SCaffrey notifications@github.com wrote:\n@vjeux I agree with you. It might be better to add log messages before the res.end() part.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Exact\n. Sure, if you implement it, I'll take it :)\n. I'm closing this since I'm not going to work on it, but feel free to send a pull request if you get it working :)\n. Yay, thanks for cleaning up after me :)\n. Can you sign the CLA? I can't merge it without :(\n. Yay it's green, thanks a lot!\n\n\n. You're welcome :) I initially wrote it for react-native as I was trying to figure out ways to make us review more pull requests and it's been working extremely well for us. I've been regularly asked how non-fb projects could use it so I ended up porting it to javascript (from php/hack) and open sourcing it over the weekend :p\n. Thanks :)\n. Is there a real need for this? It seems to me like a lot of heavyweight work that's not going to be very useful. Closing for now, but feel free to comment if you really want something like this.\n. Can you provide a more complete explanation of how you want the integration to look like? I'm closing this but I'll re-open if you reply :)\n. Thanks for the pull request, made a lot of comments, but once you address them it'll be glorious :)\n. Thanks!\n. Both work for me\n. Thanks!\n. I actually like this form better :) Thanks for the pull request!\n. A pull request to fix this is welcome :)\n. Fixed by https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/pull/36\n. If you fix the nits i'll pull it in, thanks!\n. if you add another argument, the blame looks something like\n- previousLine,\n- newLine\nSo you are now associated the blame for the previous line even though you did not change it. Also it clobbers the pull request because it highlights lines that did not change.\nFinally, small thing but it's easier to move things around as you don't need to remove the comma from the last line and add it back to the other place.\n. We are also pushing trailing comma for function calls and arguments to be part of the javascript standard. It's currently in stage 2.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks! English is hard :)\n. Thanks!\n. Looks like @dflynn15 implemented this as part of his bigger pull request. I'll close this one and merge the other one if you don't mind :)\n. Nice! Didn't know it was possible :)\n. Good catch, I forgot that it could happen. The way it is setup right now (I updated the code recently) is that we ignore all those 'none': https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/blob/master/mention-bot.js#L295-L297\nI think it's the right behavior since the goal of this is to ping people but if there's no github username this ping won't do anything.\nLet me know if you think we should change the behavior to something else, in the meantime i'm going to close the issue :)\n. So good, thanks a lot for the pull request, this is going to be very useful!\n. Thanks a lot!\n. The changelog is all shiny now!\n\n. Thanks!\n. Do you want to submit a pull request to fix it?\n. Thanks :) Can't wait to see it!\n. Agreed with @agubler suggestion\n. Haha, this bot just has hardcoded responses! But would be super cool to use M ai on github :p\n. Pull request welcome :)\n. Closing this as there's been no activity.\n. I can reproduce on node v0.10.16, but if you upgrade to node 4, it works fine. My guess is that node now supports backtick natively so babel doesn't transform it anymore.\nFew things that you can do:\n- Upgrade to node 4\n- Update the list of transforms to transform backticks so that it works on node 0.10\n. @friss mind sending a pull request?\n. So good! I'll review it tomorrow :)\n. Travis failed because it doesn't pass flow correctly :)\nmention-bot.js:26\n 26:     require('child_process')\n         ^ call of method `execFile`\n 31:           resolve(stdout);\n                       ^^^^^^ Buffer. This type is incompatible with\n395:       resolve: (result: Promise<R> | R) => void,\n                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ union type. See: /tmp/flow/flowlib_1f872210/core.js:395\n. This is really good, after you fix the comments i'll merge it in, Thanks!\n. Looks like flow is still not passing\n. Sorry I was busy today, nice that you found a fix! Waiting for travis and will merge if green\n. Yay thanks\n. Thanks\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks! Need to figure out why flow doesn't work with require('./package.json')\n. So, flow doesn't understand require('.json'), https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/620 I'll merge it in and figure out a way to fix it!\nThanks for the pull request!\n. Fixed the flow issue here: https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/commit/32cafebc926d88c05e99d6abdd1dec91d39af086\n. Fixed the extra .com here: https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/commit/b3442c5e66f4c540a15e426f35700a5d5ab70ef2\n. Thanks for fixing this! @bbenoist yup, would be better, I'll send a fix for that shortly\n. Done: https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/commit/0ac7a218ccacc789bd6fe92279d55e1a6215bc9f\n. Thanks!\n. This is the line that's doing this console.log:\nhttps://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/blob/master/server.js#L152-L155\nThere are two ways to debug this:\n1) Easy but slow way: you add console.logs everywhere, do a git commit/git push heroku master, recreate a pull request and using heroku logs --tail see what's going on and repeat.\n2) A bit more annoying but faster way: In https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/blob/master/server.js#L100 add a console.log(body) and push to heroku. Create the pull request and look at the logs. Create a file on your local machine with the content of the body in a file called body.webhook. Then run the server locally with GITHUB_TOKEN=insert_token_here npm start and do \ncurl -X POST -d @body.webhook http://localhost:5000/\nEvery time you need to change the debug code, just kill / re-run the server and re-run the curl.\n. Oh noes :(\nWould be nice to add proper error logging when the authentication fails. So that it shows up in the logs. Want to send a pull request?\n. Perfect! If you are bored during the weekend, you know what to do ;)\n. Thanks! If you fix the two small nits i'll merge it in :)\n. Hmmm actually did you try it out?\nI don't think that it works. Authentication is asynchronous so it wouldn't throw synchronously. Also, if it actually threw an error then the entire node process would be killed with the correct error. But that's not what was described in the issue.\n. Either way is fine for me. Both are not going to work and the person will have to look the logs anyway to figure out what happened\n. How did you setup the bot? Maybe you have an older version?\n. Hmm this is sad then, I really thought it was fixed.\n. I realized that I didn't push things to heroku in a long time. Probably didn't pick up the changes. Let me know if it's still not working.\n. I have no idea I'm sorry :( Can you try to add console.logs and figure out where it breaks? Please re-open if you have more information.\n. Check out the alwaysNotifyForPaths option in .mention-bot file\nhttps://github.com/facebook/mention-bot#configuration\n. I don't know what's going on here :x Can you try to investigate further and see if there's something special with those pull requests?\nPlease re-open if you have more information.\n. Thanks, sounds useful :)\n. Can you actually make the config optional?\n. Thanks!\n. I'm going to close this one down until progress is made. Please feel free to open a new one in the future :)\n. Thanks! Feel free to put the image in dockerhub and make me admin. I have never used docker but seems like this is the new hotness :)\n. Nice!\n. Sounds good thanks :)\n. No plans to implement anything of that sort but if you implement it and it makes sense, I see don't see a reason not to take it\n. Thanks that sounds useful :)\nCan you sign the cla and i'll merge it in!\n. Awesome!\n. Why would you want to do it on synchronize? Do you want the bot to comment every time the person updates the pull request?\n. Why would you listen to anything but \"opened\"?\n. I don't have any plan to work on that but if you want it to happen, should be pretty easy, the code is already decoupled with a server and the logic. If you end up with something that is working, i'd happily take the pull request :)\n. Thanks!\n. Sorry about that, i'm using the free plan for mention bot on heroku and they turn it off a few hours a day. Maybe i'll pay it up but that's a bit annoying :x\n. I just upgraded to hobby which is indeed $7/month. Please let me know if it's still broken for time to time\n. Okay, so turns out that the bot got flagged by the bot detection script from github (how ironic). I contacted their support channel to get it back up.\n\"One of our mostly harmless robots seems to think you are not a human.\nBecause of that, it\u2019s hidden your profile from the public. If you really are human, please contact support to have your profile reinstated. We promise we won\u2019t require DNA proof of your humanity.\"\n. Github unbanned the bot. Should be good to go now :) Let me know if it is not the case\n. Thanks for the pull request, this seems like a very useful feature indeed! Sorry I've been super slow to look at it but with React.js Conf and my parental leave I've been pretty busy.\nDo you have hope that the babel issue is going to be fixable? I'd hate to get travis red if we can avoid it :x\n. This is a really good pull request, thanks for submitting. As soon as the flow error is fixed I'll merge it in!\n. Great! Ping me when your pull request is updated and i'll merge it :)\n. Eagerly waiting for travis to pass :)\n. Hmmm, travis seems to be stuck, can you send an update, maybe it'll make it work again\n. https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/blob/master/.travis.yml#L5\nI have no idea how to bust the cache though\n. Thanks! I cleared the cache and re-ran the build, fingers crossed\n. Sorry it's taking so long :(\n. Omg it's green!\n\n. See https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/issues/87#issuecomment-189933420\nHopefully it'll be back up soon. If it's critical for you, you can run your own instance and hope that it won't get flagged while the official one gets back online.\n. This is a bit brittle to check this for all the call sites. What would be better is to make a file config.js that returns all the fields and uses the env variable if exists.\nThis way we don't forget to check the env variable the next time we use an attribute.\nAlso, would be great to have env variables for all the options, instead of a few arbitrary that you decided?\n. Isn't there a way with docker to change the package.json values?\n. Okay makes sense. Can you add a way to load the data from a json file passed as argument instead of relying on the env variables?\nnpm run mention-bot --config ./config.json\nthis way we don't have to have 2 ways to specify configs, we can either use package.json (default) or config.json\n. Awesome thank you!\n. This should be pretty easy to hack into the existing code if you are so inclined.\nHowever, I would warn against doing that. This is going to spam the hell out of all the people in that contributor list as they are going to be automatically subscribed to the thread. I would suggest you to try it as is and if it doesn't work, then modify the script to do it.\n. @waldyrious thanks for the comment, now I understand it better :)\n. I'm sorry but I don't have the time to help you investigate what is going wrong :( I'm going to close down this issue, but feel free to keep posting here and others to help out.\n. The file is literally called .travis.yml, you don't need to add a comment at the top of the file saying that it's about Travis :)\n. Hey, could you rebase?\n. The file is literally called Dockerfile, no need to have a comment at the top of the file saying that it's a dockerfile :)\n. I'm sorry but I don't have the time to help you investigate what is going wrong :( I'm going to close down this issue, but feel free to keep posting here and others to help out.\n. Flow requires the file to be named .json.js\n. I didn't write this feature so I don't know much about it. If you could ping the person that did to get context that would be great. Otherwise if you have a pull request that fixes the problem, i'd be glad to take it\n. Thanks! Sorry for the super long wait, I feel bad! It completely slipped my mind.\n. Thanks a lot for the high quality pull request!\n. Thanks! That's what happens when you don't have eslint setup as a ci tool and you accept people code :)\n. mention bot is on npm as a pure module. You should be able to depend on that to build your integration\n. Great!\nMind doing the small changes and i'll merge it in\n. Because the handling of the message involves pluralization and english thing like \"and\". But I agree that would be nice to have a small config like this if you don't intend to change it dramatically\n. first one seems simpler and likely going to solve the problem\n. Great! Can you just remove the comments that don't add any value and i'll merge it in. Thanks :)\n. Oops sorry\n. Thanks for the pr (sorry for the delay, I was in vacation). I agree that USERNAME looks better but let's make sure we document what exists today.\n. Should be good\n(511) >> git push heroku master\nEverything up-to-date\n. I'm sorry but I don't have the time to help you investigate what is going wrong :( I'm going to close down this issue, but feel free to keep posting here and others to help out.\n. I'm happy to accept this if you implement it, but I'm not going to myself :)\n. @hunkim yeah, would need to build some sort of cron that checks if the pr is old, not been checked yet and has no comments from the org owner and then use the cli api for the bot to run it\n. Also note that the bot checks the blame against master, so if you do it a week after, it is probably going to return incorrect results. A safer solution would be to run the bot instantly and store the people that it would have mentioned and then x days after, comment with those people.\n. What you are asking for is pretty easy. I'm sure that you can get it working if you spend an hour or two\n. Thanks, I'll merge as soon as small nits are fixed\n. Thanks :)\n. Would be useful! Happy to merge this if you send a pull request\n. It's in, thanks @mattpickle !\n. Sounds like a great idea indeed. I'd take it if you send a pull request\n. Fixed by https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/pull/130\n. Hey! This is absolutely a legitimate concern. As with any bot that sends email notifications, there should be a way to turn it off.\nI've been thinking about many ways to achieve this:\n- as you suggested, a git repo where you can send a pull request. The issue with this is that it's a lot of steps to unsubscribe. Ideally i'd like it to be a one click operation.\n- a website where you can unsubscribe. The issue here is that we would need to get you to log in which is not a very good user experience. You want to unsubscribe, logging in to do that seems sketchy.\n- go to github and block the mention-bot user.\nI think the last one is actually a really good solution and should be promoted in the official documentation.\nLet me know what you think\n. I've added a repo called how-to-unsubscribe on the mention-bot account. It should fix your use case. If the project gets a wider adoption, we'll probably want to invest in more fine-grained control but that is out of scope for me now.\n\nhttps://github.com/mention-bot/how-to-unsubscribe\n\n. For 1), I'd recommend adding a setting in mention-bot to filter people you want.\nFor 2), yeah it's unfortunate. We'd need something more sofisticated that I won't have the time to work on anytime soon.\n. If you implement it, I'll be glad to accept it :)\n. Yay, thanks :)\nI'll merge it in if you add the trailing comma\n. Thanks, the code looks really good \ud83d\udc4d \n. Could you add a description on your pull request? Why do you want to add those changes? Also, having one commit instead of the 9 currently would be better! Thanks\n. Closing since no responses. Please feel free to create a new one with the comments addressed if you want to see it merged\n. Thanks a lot for the pull request, it is really high quality! Apart from all the minor syntax nits, this is good to go!\n. Thanks! Sorry for the lack of updates :)\n. I'm doing a bad job at pushing the latest version to heroku when I merge pull requests. I'll push it today\n. I just pushed the new version\n. Mention bot works only on pull requests and analyze the blame to figure out who should be reviewing it. I have a lot of ideas for how to deal with issues but this is out of scope for this project.\nI would encourage you to start your own bot and do that. It shouldn't be very difficult to implement and has the potential to be highly impactful!\n. Grrr, must have been caught again by github bot detection. I'll re-submit a request when I get back home.\n. It got enabled back by github!\n. Thanks!\n. Unfortunately, there is no github api to fetch the blame information, so we are using the normal user login flow and parsing out the html.\nIf you know of a better way, please let me know!\n. Looks good, thanks!\n. Very smart!\n. @jcsmorais thanks for flagging! Is this a use case that you have to work on multiple branches but have the config only on master?\nWhile it may break people, I feel like this is a good change. I think you want to read mention-bot from the branch you are in, not from master.\n. Is this going to affect you?\n. Oh ok, sorry about this :(\n. I just bumped the major version on npm, so it won't affect existing users from npm.\n. This is actually causing many legitimate pull requests to fail, I'm reverting this change.\nhttps://github.com/crits/crits_services/pull/242\n{ [Error: {\"message\":\"No commit found for the ref patch-33\",\"documentation_url\":\"https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/contents/\"}]\n  message: '{\"message\":\"No commit found for the ref patch-33\",\"documentation_url\":\"https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/contents/\"}',\n  code: 404 }\n. My usual line of thoughts for this is to implement whatever is needed for your project and avoid theorizing on what others could maybe want in the future. When that comes up, then try to adapt their use cases ;)\nIf you send a pull request to add support for whatever you need, I'll gladly accept it\n. Perfect!\n. Good call, if you send a pull request to update the doc i'll merge it in :)\n. Good call!\nWhat about \"history\" instead of \"annotation\"?\n. Sounds good! I had no idea that git annotate was a thing :)\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Async await is awesome :)\n. This would be very useful indeed. I have no plans of actually implementing that but I would not be opposed of accepting a pull request for it\n. I'm not planning to implement support for it as I do not have such a use case but if you make it work and send a pull request, I'd be happy to accept it\n. This is weird, thanks for the report, I'll investigate.\n. I checked and we receive two http requests about each pull request. So it's something on the github side. Could you remove the webhook, try a pull request and maybe re-add it if it doesn't fix it. (The old reboot the computer technique and prays it works)\nI looked at the logs and you are the only project I could see that behaves like this fyi.\n. Cool, glad you figured it out :)\n. Nice, so easy!\nFeel free to add a test if you want, but I'd be happy to take it in as is.\nCould you sign the CLA and I'll pull it in, thanks!\n. Yup, I can see you have signed the CLA, thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Hmm this is weird\nhttps://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/blob/2652842e6088625b140f822476f71ea3c1744fcf/server.js#L150-L154\nthis is the line that is causing the issue. I'm not really sure why it wouldn't work out of the top of my head. Could you add console.log in the path and see if there's any useful info?\n. Thanks for the pr.\nHave you figured out why the mention-bot file was required? This is not expected. I'd love to fix this bug :)\n. No worries, I like when people are working on stuff, makes me happy :)\n. Thanks! Sorry about this \n. Thanks!\n. Can you add console.log in various places and try to figure out what is happening? I don't have access to a ghe instance unfortunately so all the code in the repo was contributed by external contributors\n. Awesome investigation!\nFor 1), a pr would be awesome thanks!\nFor 2), do you know if there's a way to only get the first 1meg of data and just drop the rest? For such a big pull request we just want to get some data, processing everything is just a waste of resources.\n. Maybe it actually never worked...\n. Enjoy your vacation! Feel free to send this patch when you come back :)\n. Thanks! I'm going to take this pr but i'd love to truncate the request to the first meg instead of making it grow unbounded. Do you know if it's possible?\n. Hey @ifuller1, sorry for the lack of review, I was in PTO last week!\nI like the idea of being able to read things from the environment but it feels wrong to me to reimplement a custom way of parsing all the different fields and to clobber the global namespace of environment variables with all the possible options we have and will have in the future.\nWhat do you think about supporting MENTION_BOT_CONFIG environment variable that is a json string that we JSON.parse instead?\nIf you agree with this approach, I'd love to review a pull request with it :)\n. Sounds good :)\n. (Sorry for the CLA Signed bot spam, we're trying to figure out what's going on here!)\n. Thanks a lot for the pull request! I've tried to give you a lengthy review to explain my thought process, I can't wait to see it shipped :)\n. Perfect thanks!\nThis branch has conflicts that must be resolved\nDo you mind rebasing so that I can merge it? :)\n. Feel free to tell me about the other use cases you have and we can figure out what to do with them :)\n. Hmm, I still see the test file and the implementation file that is no longer needed?\n. Yay thanks for keeping up with me!\n. For your ideas, I'd love to have a kind of lint-on-demand project where you can plug in all this kind of rules but this is indeed not something I want to merge inside of mention-bot. I'm trying to keep it focused on finding ways to mention potential reviewers, which is already something complicated as you can see by the list of options supported :)\n. Thanks @shaneog !\n. The github api doesn't have a way to get the blame information, so we're querying the normal website for it, which requires a normal authentication and doesn't let us use the token unfortunately :(\n. Hey @cyberdelia, sorry for the super late response. I do not think that abandoning the blame is the right approach, but you make an excellent point with \"also tend to give reviewers that have a overall more \"fresher\" point of view on the code being changed\".\nIn the fb-internal version of mention-bot we are now applying a coefficient based on time on every line of code. If the line of code has been written more than 8 months ago, we ignore it entirely. Then, we do a linear interpolation for 8 months being 0 to now being worth 350 points.\nThis is working much better and I would love to accept a pull request that implements it on this project.\n@StephanBijzitter mention-bot is activated on this project. The way it is implemented is that there's a fixed buffer size for the http request and if the pull request you are requesting is bigger than that it crashes and drops the request. This is not ideal and a pull request to make it read whatever has been downloaded within that fixed size would be appreciated.\nHowever, in practice, this only happens for giant pull requests that change everything, which are going to be highly debated and the people involved are going to see it anyway.\nI'm going to go ahead and close this pull request as I don't think it's worth losing all the logic. But I'm glad that you were able to use this project as a basis in order to reimplement it in a way that suits your needs and thanks for all the time and efforts you've spent on it!\n. We should get GitHub to provide support for accessing the blame information through their API. Here's a random attempt: https://twitter.com/Vjeux/status/783783705722494977\nBy the way, feel free to use this pull request for your use case, that's the great thing about open source :)\n. Hey, sorry about the long delay. I would go with c. I don't want to do a breaking change for this.\nFeel free to send a pull request, thanks!\n. Thanks :)\n. @waldyrious thanks for the suggestion, I'm down for it. Can you send a pull request to update it? Thanks!\n. I need to push the new version to heroku, I was waiting for this pull request to do another push :)\n. Thanks!\n. Okay, it has been deployed to heroku, should be good to go. Let me know if it doesn't work.\n. Sounds useful! Thanks!\nI haven't done a good review but I trust you and the unit test you wrote :)\n. Grrr, github must have banned the bot again :(\n. Just sent a support request. In the past it took ~24h for them to reinstate the bot\n. Yay, thank you!\n. Hey, I'm sorry but I don't have the time to look into it. Would be nice if you could run your own instance and put console.log in places and troubleshot what's going on. Sorry about this!\n. Arg, looks like the transpilation step is broken before we publish to npm. @gyandeeps do you know why that would be?\n. Thanks!. Closing since there hasn't been any update in a while. Please feel free to reopen it if you are making progress, this feature would be great to have :). Oops, sorry about it. If you fix the conflicts I'll merge it in. So sorry :(. Thanks!\n. Omg, thanks for doing this!\n. Unfortunately, all the settings are based on the repository and it kind of sucks to send a pull request to get you unsubscribed.\nYou can get rid of all the notifications at once by following those instructions: https://github.com/mention-bot/how-to-unsubscribe\nI'm not really sure how to make it more obvious. Feedback welcome! Sorry about this experience :(\n. Hey @jeffreyleeon, sorry it took me a few days to review this. Unfortunately, the JSON specification disallows trailing commas. I would rather not start supporting invalid JSON there.\nHowever, it would be awesome to report back on the pull request that the configuration was invalid so that it's easy to spot the error.\nWould you mind sending a pull request for that instead? Thanks!. @jeffreyleeon thanks! I will review it more quickly this time!. Hey, thanks for reaching out!\nI think that there are two issues here:\n1) .mention-bot file only accepts valid json and our example in the README is not because there's a trailing comma and comments. https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/pull/186#issuecomment-263097516 is tracking sending a message when the file has an invalid format.\n2) mention-bot doesn't mention yourself. Can you find someone to do a commit on the file you are trying to modify such that it appears in the blame?\nSorry about that! Hopefully after those two things it'll work for you!. Would love if you could send a pull request to put it where you would have likely read it :). Yay, perfect thanks :)\nI'll push it to the live instance this evening. Awesome! Thanks, this is an awesome output. Please tweak the little quote and i'll merge it in :). YAY. Sounds awesome indeed! I won't have the time to work on it anytime soon but would love to see it happening.. Mention-bot is already logged with a user token so we can send normal http requests like a user would if you want ;). Thanks for your PRs!. That would be awesome indeed. I won't likely implement it myself but would welcome a pull request for it. Thanks! Looks like this repo got turned private. I'm trying to hunt down why it happened. Sorry about that!. Thanks!. Omg, so good, thanks a lot <3. Thanks!. Good catch. I'm happy to review a pull request if you can get it working :). Thanks!. Thanks for the report! Would you be interested in sending a pull request to fix it by any chance? :). Awesome thanks!. Thank you!. Thank you!. Awesome! You are the best. I was about to fix them at some point but I'm glad you just did :). Strange, I just restarted the build.. Let's try to ship it and see if we get an email that yells at us :p. If you can fix it, that's would be awesome and I'll merge the pull request!. Thank you!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Awesome, that would be more than welcome!. Thanks!. Would you be able to add tests that were not working and are now fixed? This way we don't break them in the future?. If you add tests, I'll happily merge this, thanks for working on it!. Thanks! Once travis is green, I'll merge it :). Yay!. Oh noes :( Would anyone be interested in fixing it and putting it back up?. You can run a local version via heroku and see what happens.. Sorry about that. What happened is that Github banned the bot account and I contacted their support to re-enable it, which they just did.. What we do inside of facebook but haven't ported it to the js version is to give more weight based on time of the blame. If the line you wrote is more than 8 months old, it doesn't count, and a line that has been committed yesterday is worth 10x more. With a linear interpolation between the two, it gave some good results.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Looks like tests are no longer passing.. I just opened the blame on github and saved it.. ",

The wrapper we're using for the GitHub API makes\nasync calls, but the way the bot is currently structured, it does\neverything synchronously (downloading the blame, downloading the diff,\netc). To my mind, we can either rewrite the bot to work entirely async, or\nwrite our own sync function that retrieves a user's organizations from the\nAPI.

The link is here: https://github.com/24OI/Standard_Code_Library/pull/22\n. @vjeux Thanks for your help.\nFrom the log I noticed that my bot got the blame from here: https://github.com/24OI/Standard_Code_Library/blame/master/c++/String/README.md\nYou can see that the original author didn't have a valid email.\nI think the problem results in here.\n. The diff is here : https://patch-diff.githubusercontent.com/raw/24OI/Standard_Code_Library/pull/11.diff\nHere is a part of the log file. It's crazy that I didn't get info from the bot. What might be wrong then?\nThe blame is here : https://github.com/24OI/Standard_Code_Library/blame/master/c++/Graph/HLD/README.md\nYou can see that there is an author this time.\n```\n2015-11-23T05:07:59.429298+00:00 heroku[router]: at=info method=POST path=\"/\" host=mention-bot-24oi.herokuapp.com request_id=75c5372e-ab55-4aa8-a324-a9c7d56a4331 fwd=\"192.30.252.41\" dyno=web.1 connect=1ms service=4ms status=200 bytes=117\n2015-11-23T05:09:15.081129+00:00 heroku[router]: at=info method=POST path=\"/\" host=mention-bot-24oi.herokuapp.com request_id=a0972140-59b2-43d5-a745-fdca654dfbfa fwd=\"192.30.252.34\" dyno=web.1 connect=1ms service=12ms status=200 bytes=117\n2015-11-23T05:12:00.805274+00:00 heroku[router]: at=info method=POST path=\"/\" host=mention-bot-24oi.herokuapp.com request_id=a142cf8d-929a-4dc1-87ae-b5c396b0e6b8 fwd=\"192.30.252.41\" dyno=web.1 connect=1ms service=3ms status=200 bytes=117\n```\n. @vjeux Thanks. It seems that heroku doesn't allow an ssh connection to my app? So the only way out is to push with git?

    "waldyrious": "@aspiers I actually think both you and @vjeux may have misinterpreted what @RandomlyKnighted tried to say. The initial comment is a bit confusing indeed, but after reading it a few times what I understand is that he wants to restrict mentions to just members of the organization (either owners or contributors), since they have an explicit process to onboard frequent contributors from the community into the org. It seems that you guys think he wants to mention all users in the contributors team, but as I see it it's more about using that list as a filter to rule out code authors that aren't on that list. Essentially choosing the potential reviewers using the same method as presently, but picking from a curated pool of trusted reviewers rather than all github users.\nI not really fond of that idea though, since I believe encouraging members of the community to become more involved (and eventually taking up more active roles in the project) is a good thing, and doing that as widely and automatically as possible ensures that human error, forgetfulness or mere availability lows (in the process of adding people to the manually curated contributors team) won't miss opportunities for contributions from people who would otherwise get prompted to get involved.\nAutomated processes like MentionBot can be the catalyst to keep projects alive and bustling as people naturally flow in and out of the maintainership role. (As a side-note, I think the Wikipedia community made a good choice in this regard, by considering the administrator role a \"barrier removal\" more than a \"role attribution\", since the latter view often leads to calls for more stringent criteria, periodic reconfirmation votes, activity minimums to retain the admin tools, etc.)\nIf this is ever implemented, I'd strongly suggest it to be an opt-in feature (i.e. off by default).\n. happy to help, and sorry for the long comment (I didn't realize how long it was at the time \ud83d\ude05)\n. Yeah, the opening comment is definitely a little unclear :)\n. I'm worried about the \"stop using blame webpages to find reviewers\". Wouldn't this mean that mention-bot would stop producing context-aware reviewer suggestions, based on who has actually worked the code in question?\n. Case in point \u261d\ufe0f \ud83d\ude04 \n. Sure, that was my intention. I'll just wait a bit to see what @ZauberNerd's thinks :)\n. Glad you guys agree. I'll submit the PR then.\n. @vjeux I noted that despite #170 being merged, the period does not yet appear in mentionbot's message -- is there any explicit update step to get the bot to use the new messages? Or were you guys perhaps waiting for this PR so you wouldn't have to do it twice in quick succession?\n. Seems to be working already! http://zmoazeni.github.io/gitspective/#/timeline/mention-bot\n. @aspiers I actually think both you and @vjeux may have misinterpreted what @RandomlyKnighted tried to say. The initial comment is a bit confusing indeed, but after reading it a few times what I understand is that he wants to restrict mentions to just members of the organization (either owners or contributors), since they have an explicit process to onboard frequent contributors from the community into the org.

You need to make sure your changes pass the local tests. Good luck!\n. @SuriyaaKudoIsc Can you test your mention-bot in Linux or AWS EC2? I really think you should be able to run tests after modifying source code.\n. @facebook-github-bot done!\n. @vjeux Thanks for the comments. I changed. Let me know if you have more comments. I'm learning a lot. Thanks!\n. I'll try to come up with a PR (with a minimal change). :-)\n. @vjeux, I put some thoughts. First, we can remove pluralization -- keep it simple. So the conf file would be:\n{\n      \"maxReviewers\": 5, // Maximum  number of people to ping in the PR message, default is 3\n      \"numFilesToCheck\": 10, // Number of files to check against, default is 5\n       // Or other nice phrase without pluralization \n     \"message\": \"@pullRequester, thanks! @reviwers, please review this.\",\n     ...\n   }\nIn the code, we just replace '@pullRequester' and '@reviwers'. Very simple.\nThe second way is implementing the pluralization getting /singular/plural/ words. For example, the message would be:\n\"message\": \"we identified @reviwers to be /a// potential /reviewer/reviwers/.\",\nBased on the reviewers.length, we choose the first or second word. Doable, but complicated perhaps for the users.\nAny thoughts?\n. @vjeux Thanks for the comments. I'll submit another PR.\n. @vjeux Thanks! Done.\n. Any comments?\n. @lilnate22 I am not sure the running bot is using the current master version. @vjeux,  can you verify? \n. @lilnate22 Any luck? I think we should add console.log to check the configration and .mention.bot file.\n. @mlbright I noticed this too. I think we need to remove comments in the example config file. Also, we may need to capture the JSON parsing error and log it.\n. It's a good idea.\n. It's a good idea, but current mention bot acts on the PR hook. To implement this, I guess we need a server to periodically check PR status.  @vjeux, are there any simple ways to implement this? \n. @erlend-sh it's a good idea. You may use https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-schedule to implement the \"After 3 days...\" part.\n. IMHO, a simple keyword in the title would be a good start. Let's keep it simple. :-)\n. @mattpickle Please let me know if you need any help on this. I think it's a simple change. \n. @KrishMunot Cool! I think you can start with the configuration in server.js:\n``` python\n  // default config\n  var repoConfig = {\n    maxReviewers: 3,\n    numFilesToCheck: 5,\n    userBlacklist: [],\n    userBlacklistForPR: [],\n    userWhitelist: [],\n    fileBlacklist: [],\n    requiredOrgs: [],\n    findPotentialReviewers: true,\n    actions: ['opened'],\n    skipAlreadyAssignedPR: false,\n  };\ntry {\n    // request config from repo\n    var configRes = await getRepoConfig({\n      user: data.repository.owner.login,\n      repo: data.repository.name,\n      path: CONFIG_PATH,\n      headers: {\n        Accept: 'application/vnd.github.v3.raw'\n      }\n    });\nrepoConfig = {...repoConfig, ...JSON.parse(configRes)};\n\n```\nThen, before bot fires the comment, add one if condition based on the condifuration:\npython\ngithub.issues.createComment({\n    user: data.repository.owner.login, // 'fbsamples'\n    repo: data.repository.name, // 'bot-testing'\n    number: data.pull_request.number, // 23\n    body: message\n  });\nI gues that's it. Look forward to your beautiful PR.\n@vjeux, please correct me if I miss something.\n. Could you add some description about this change? \nI think you need to run tests locally to make sure your change passes all tests.\n``\nserver.js:154\n154:   if(skipTitle == \"WIP\"){\n          ^^^^^^^^^ identifierskipTitle`. Could not resolve name\n```\n. Nice catch!\n. @vjeux Good idea!.
