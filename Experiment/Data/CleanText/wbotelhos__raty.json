Fixed by: http://github.com/wbotelhos/raty/commit/9a88264236848d481999f0b0f8861ccabad77834\nIf it's ok, then close the issue for me please.\nThank you. (:\n. It has been fixed in the new version:\nhttps://github.com/downloads/wbotelhos/raty/jquery.raty-0.9.zip\nIf it's ok, then close the issue for me please.\nThank you. (:\n. The idea of ID I use in jQuery Stepy, so I took and made the selection to class also, as you suggested.\nI had never tried to use the public functions within the callback, and it seems a little unpredictable behavior within the each(), but with the selector option in the new version I hope to solve your needs:\nhttp://github.com/downloads/wbotelhos/raty/jquery.raty-1.0.0.zip\nThe example test it:\nhttp://wbotelhos.com/raty/index.html#target-demo\nIf it's ok, then close the issue for me please.\nThank you. (:\n. Oi Sidney,\nN\u00e3o tenho planos de trocar o uso de img por CSS.\nO plugin de voto n\u00e3o tem muito o que alterar via CSS. Tirando o \u00edcone qualquer coisa pode ser alterada. O que voc\u00ea gostaria de alterar como apar\u00eancia?\nUsar CSS tamb\u00e9m obriga setar o caminho no background: url('..'), al\u00e9m de ser mais dif\u00edcil controlar o sprite do que trocar um \u00edcone.\n. Hi Redani,\nCould you please write these questions in this post [1]?\n[1] http://www.wbotelhos.com/2010/07/14/jquery-raty-a-star-rating-plugin\nThanks. (:\n. Hi mersadk,\nI was procrastinating this feature until someone actually need.\nClosed by commit of version 1.3.0:\nhttps://github.com/wbotelhos/raty/commit/b29e54e0324938e389208c40aaa07b206ee365e6\n. Hi afeld,\nAll actions are made by ID, even it not exist, because Raty create it.\nFor ignore the ID the only way is keep the element selection, but it is impracticable.\nUnless using Widget technique to keep the states. But change that would create another plugin. So I suggest to use the HTML elements in the right way instead of bypassing the bad practice within the jQuery Raty.\nDo you have any idea how to do this without problems?\nHugs.\n. Hi ecool2011,\nClosed by commit of version 1.3.2:\nhttps://github.com/wbotelhos/raty/commit/62cbe8bea9de76b8dcbaaa020c92738d753a782f\n. Merged, thanks. (:\n. Hi mrchess,\nUsing the selection by id or class you can use children() to get the input value.\nI don't know if is clearer make a public function like: $.fn.raty.getScore('#big'); instead to do: $('#big').children('#big-score').val();\n. If you have some good ideas, please, fork e push it. (:\n. I'm developing some new features including visualization of the vote.\nIt'll be available in version 1.4.\nThanks.\n. Hi mrchess,\nRaty use <img /> and one <input type=\"hidden\" /> to keep the score, and it initialized just if you set the start option.\nCan you give me an example? Because the one on site [1] works fine.\n[1] http://wbotelhos.com/raty/#fixed-demo\n. Hi Yakuplpek,\nCould you try with this version [1] and jQuery 1.5.1 please?\n[1] https://github.com/wbotelhos/raty/blob/b0a9cf74b8b41bc07a51b367b50a255e09db7b4e/js/jquery.raty.min.js\n. Hi denisq,\nThis solves your problem [1]?\nhttps://github.com/wbotelhos/raty/blob/d164a9e94acbeb9e27e8afd5be54fccf523e4217/js/jquery.raty.js\n. Hi piernik,\nCould you use the snapshot [1] to see if it solves your problem?\n[1] https://github.com/wbotelhos/raty/blob/99089098a452f61354422e48e40d479aa7785372/js/jquery.raty.js#L452\n. Hi Jangla,\nUse the version on the repository [1].\nIt was fixed by this [2] commit.\n[1] https://github.com/wbotelhos/raty/blob/master/js/jquery.raty.js\n[2] https://github.com/wbotelhos/raty/commit/f1b8553834f74ae9fb12b078acd9c45ba92d1d64\nCould you test it?\nThanks for the issue.\n. Hi roryhutchings,\nFor all I know, there is no way to check if the stream of the image is available or not just with JS.\nAnd change the image automatically can confuse if the path is correct and pointing to the default icon or Raty that do it.\n. Hi grisevg,\n- There is no way the ID to be null, because there is a rule, #L49, that creates an ID for the element if it does not exist;\n- This was a change I would make, good job;\n- Useful for what? If it is hidden the only use would be to take the value of multiple fields at once, but you can just to use the class of the Raty container;\n- Good job with the trim, I hate it too;\n- I prefer let it available for anyone to download and not bother compress the script. I also do the minified with some settings to avoid syntax errors as we see in the jQuery script.\nDo that changes and we merge it. (:\nAnd please, don't let unusual and commented code.\nThanks.\n. - The ID is declared at #L46;\n- Strange the plugin requires a class and don't bind by ID, but ok. I think it'll help someone;\n- I prefer give the two option, full and minified.\n- And I was thinking about error message. It is better throw it locally and let the function message to log warnings and messages help.\n. Hi grisevg,\nWe have jQuery.error and I think it is a good method.\nIf you want put your feature scoreClass, please, close this pull request, update your repository and make another pull request. This week I'll release the version 2.0.0 using closure and will be a big change. \nThanks.\n. Hi hpgihan,\nGood work!\nThanks!\n. Done!\n. Hi Konrad,\nFirst all, thanks for the path.\nBut why not just decrease the Raty container to make it break the row?\nTo make this break is not required <br/>, the div will to that, and you can use the width option to do it.\n. Hi pcout,\nI did not see problem. To keep the value in the target you need to use: targetKeep: true\n. Hi pcout,\nI could not find your problem.\nI did an example here: http://www.moviecollection.com.br/lab/raty\n. If Raty is read-only then read-only it will be.\nTo change the value you must turn off the read-only first.\n. Hi felix,\nMaybe your r.rating is a float value, because it worked here:\nhtml\n<div data-rating='1' class=\"detail_item star\"></div>\n<div data-rating='2' class=\"detail_item star\"></div>\n<div data-rating='3' class=\"detail_item star\"></div>\n``` javascript\n\n    $(function() {</p>\n<pre><code>    $('.star').each(function(el){\n        $(this).raty({\n            readOnly:   true,\n            start:      $(this).attr('data-rating')\n        });\n    });\n\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>\n```\nYou can bind Raty direct and get the start value by callback like this:\njavascript\n$('.star').raty({\n    start: function() {\n        return $(this).attr('data-rating');\n    }\n});\nBut I see we have a issue on jQuery.index() where you can't use more than one class, then you should use just the class star. If you want put more style on it, do it by the class .star.\nAnd you have a left parenthesis in your code.\n. Hi deGir,\nIn fact the hintList is just the attribute alt of the img tag, then it can be just one value. Change it sequential values (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) crashs the plugin, because this values is used to fill up the star on mouseover.\nI have the idea of to build a tip above the star on mouseover, but it will let the plugin larger 8k minified.\n. The version 2.7.0, now supports it.\n. Merged, thanks!\n. Hi croshchupkin,\nshowHalf options is enabled for default and it works for me.\nBut if you wants enable the half selection you must enable it: half: true.\nIf you have an example or wants to send a test to break the code, please, re-open it.\n. Hi mersadk,\nThe action is from Raty to the element, not the inverse.\nIf you want to that, use $('#star').raty('click', 2); when you change de drop down.\n. Hi amandoi,\nWe don't have the 'raty' method at all.\nWe can call $('#star').raty('some-real-method'), but not $('#star').raty('raty').\nIf you have some problem, please, re-open it.\n. Hi,\nIf there is no method .raty then the plugin was not imported right.\nMaybe it was lazy, maybe the link is wrong, maybe the code was called earlier.\n. I can't see any problem on your code.\nTry the minor possible like:\nhtml\n<div id=\"star\"></div>\njs\n<script>\n  $(function() {\n    $('#star').raty();\n  });\n</script>\n. The problem is on your application files, but is hard to me to say what is.\nI think you should put your scripts before your close tag </body>, not outside html.\nIf you're calling Raty into that php/jquery function, then it will raise the error, because the jquery files is loaded after. Move it to the final of your body.\n. Check your page source and click on jquery.raty.js link and check if it will be opened.\nI think your import is wrong.\n. Try to use the demo page, change the extension and put your stuffs each peace at once.\nBut I'm sorry, I don't know how to help your more than this.\n. Good job packowitz,\nApplying it!\nThe next time you can do a pull request. :D\n. Hi maddhacker24,\nRaty can't do that automatically because it is a especific case.\nThe best thing to do is you handle the selected score and change it by your own.\nThe values on Raty must be sequential to it know how star select or not.\nIf you have more doubts, please, post on blog.\n. Merged, thanks! (:\n. Hi jacobwg,\nI was migrating the blog to another server, now it's up.\nThanks! (:\n. Yes Landish,\nWe'll be down for a while.\nI want to pay a server and create an exclusive area for the plugins.\nSorry!\n. No, there isn't. But you can change the icon and set the score inside the callback click.\n. Hi shadowfax,\nThe hints are alt tag, then it is one per star.\nWe can't change the sequence, because Raty use it to calculate a lot of things.\nI want to do a feature to show real hint like a pop up and let alt do it job: 1 2 3 4 5.\nIf you have some ideia of how to take off this dependency of the alt attribute let me know.\n. Good idea shadowfax,\nCould you add some specs for that feature and do a pull request?\nFor minified use http://refresh-sf.com/yui and please, check the option: \"Preserve unnecessary semicolons\"\nAnd remember that you cant change the original score, you must keep the score/title value into other variable, because the hidden field must keep the original value not the ceil.\n. Hi seiyria,\nThis issue still opend because will code it, but I'm kind busy for now with my startup.\nBut it will be out soon.\n. The version 2.7.0, now supports it.\n. Just the pointer is a doubt and it was discussed and changed a long time ago.\nMaybe use pointer on wrapper only when using precision can be a good ideia.\nTry to do a pull request just with the cursor change and we review it again.\nThanks.\n. Hi @charlesjshort,\nThe browser will cache the image on the first fetch and then provide the cached image.\nWhat is the advantages of it?\n. But when we have the same URL the browser gets the cached image, not doing other request.\nRaty use icon to avoid CSS, it is the ideia.\n. Hi,\nTry to do a clean pull request, with specs.\nNow we have font support, then the code changed a bit.\n. Thanks @aprimadi,\nI will merge and add some tests.\n. Hi dannyroa,\nSemantically there is no way to vote as zero.\nThe minimum is half. A no rated star has the default state of an input element: no value.\nBut if you want set zero, change the lines:\nhttps://github.com/wbotelhos/raty/blob/master/js/jquery.raty.js#L64\nhttps://github.com/wbotelhos/raty/blob/master/js/jquery.raty.js#L398\nBut remember, you cant click on star number zero and the cancel button take off the value.\n. You can manually clear the value attribute:\njs\n$('.rating input').removeAttr('value');\nOr call the cancel function:\njs\n$('.rating').raty('cancel');\n. Hi havvg,\nCould you make a test to break the code and pass with this change?\n. Working on version 2.6.0.\n. Hi havvg,\nUse this link: http://refresh-sf.com/yui/\nAnd don't forget to check the option \"Preserve unnecessary semicolons (such as right before a '}').\"\n. Thanks havvg! (:\n. My blog throws 404 during the deploy.\n. Hi muratguzel,\nIn fact, most of the options could be started with callback. I will try to find a way of abstracting this code to prevent the code grow much because of this if.\nGood job with the Gem. @bmc has also created something cool for Raty, take a look: https://github.com/bmc/jquery-raty-rails\nThanks for your commit! (:\n. Hi Joseph,\nGreat feature!\nCould you add a test for it?\n. Hi @joe1chen,\nSorry about that, but passed 5 months and yoy din't write a test for it.\nI was already fixed.\nThanks.\n. By the way, your name will be on Contributors. (;\n. Hi @nickhoffman,\nTe attribute is setted just for the current object $this, it is not global.\n. Hi @nickhoffman,\nThe following commands brings differents values:\njs\n$('#default-demo').raty('get', 'score');\n$('#score-demo').raty('get', 'score');\nThe .data() sets the value only on element binded. Or I'm doing something very wrong.\nWrite some tests for break it and do a pull request, then I'll accept it.\nThe get feature is very cool, if you want do another pull request just with it and write a test for it I'll be glad.\nThanks again!\n. Hi @andreynovikov,\nEach image should have the altattribute and that pop-up is that alt attribute.\n. Hi @BeenaShetty,\nMaybe it is your connection loading the icon. Right?\n. If you execute the .appendTo Raty will works fine. But if you do .html() it is just a raw HTML.\nThe problems is the popover plugin, not Raty.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/4FujN/14\n. Hi @Gillespie59,\nThis issue will be solved on next version that will be release, maybe tomorrow.\npath will be undefined by default and will be preppend only if you specify it.\nThanks for the feedback. :)\n. Closed by version 2.5.1\n. Hi @DouweM,\nSorry about that, but I did a better fix for it, but I don't push it yet.\nIt will be released on next version maybe tomorrow.\nAnyway I'll remember to put your name on contributors. ;)\n. You can't bind the Raty more than one time on the same .starRating.\nTry to bind one time outside the interval and than to use $('.starRating').raty('score', x);\nI can't test your code now, tonight I will try it.\n. You should bind just one time and use the function to change the score:\n``` js\nvar star = $('#star'),\n    i    = 1;\nstar.raty({ single: true });\nvar time = setInterval(function() {\n  star.raty('score', i++);\nif (i > 5) {\n    i = 1;\n  }\n}, 200);\n```\n. It sucks! :/\nThanks!\n. Hi @dxypher,\nDid you downloaded the laste version? 2.5.2\n. Hi @pmoda,\nThe version of jQuery 1.5.1 has not the on() function. And the similars were deprecated on new versions of jQuery.\nAbout the \"No Method raty\", the most time is problem of import or bind before the script is loaded.\nCheck it and tell me about, because on demo page, I'm using the minified version and works.\n. Hi @lastikas,\nGood code, thanks!\n. Hi @Patatouf,\nMake sure that the div is created before the bind and everything will works.\nCheck the image path too and take care to not bind the .raty elements twice.\nTo do a better test, use the Firebug, append a div on body and bind it.\nIt is the way I do my specs, and it works perfectly.\n. Call your $.ajax() without the Raty bind then open the Firebug and execute the bind. $('.raty').raty();.\nSo you can make sure the div is there and inspect the DOM to check the images.\n. The namespace raty was not found, maybe your import is broken.\n. Since raty already imported, it is ok.\n. Hi @bendanzz,\nUnfortunately not, neither jQuery will keep it.\nWhat is your problem? Maybe I can help you to do a hack to get it works.\n. Hi @sergicontre,\nAnd what is the problem?\n. The wrapper grew to fit your 30px stars, but you still using icons with 16px.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/p7WCG/1/\n. Hi @ephraimb,\nThanks for your time! (:\n. Why not just get the value inside it?\nWe have a method for it or you can to use your own jQuery selector.\nWhat is the problem?\n. Thanks.\n. Hi,\nYou should call Raty only when data is on DOM.\n. Use the iconRange e choose your colored icons.\n. Hi,\nThanks, but without test and breaking other things I cannot accept.\nBy the way, you can just implements the replace on hints, like: {score} bad.\nI'll open a issue for it.\n. Thanks! (:\n. Hi,\nYou should block the next rating based on user login.\nCookies can be cleared or disabled.\nAnd it is a bouch of kbs that is not responsability of Raty.\nBut you can to use cookies if you want inside the callbacks.\n. Use the click callback.\nYou know that the cancel button was clicked when the score is null:\nhttps://github.com/wbotelhos/raty/blob/master/lib/jquery.raty.js#L123\n. Hi,\nNow you can prevent the default action, of set score, returning false, then you can do your own logic.\n. Thanks man! (:\n. The main focus of Raty is to use the image, not sprite, because sprite needs to use CSS, IE compatibility and so...\nRaty is about to keep the things simple, then we need the trade off.\n. I did not say it was a bad practice. (;\nI just said it is a choice of the plugin.\nAdd more options makes the plugin grows very kbs and make it lose it focus and purpose.\nThe purpose of Raty is work with image.\n. Hi,\njQuery Raty 2.6.0 now supports Fonts.\n. No, but you can set the selected score to any element you want. \n. It is not responsability of the Raty, but you can check via JS if has no score and then prevent the submit.\n. You do not need it, just put a ID on your div and do:\n$('#raty-number-1').find('input').val();\nBut you can use the Raty method:\n```\nvar el = $('#raty-number-1').raty();\nel.raty('score'); // It is the scoreName value.\n```\n. As I said, before you submit the form, just check if score is setted.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/z67kR/1/\n. Hi,\nTake a look here: http://wbotelhos.com/raty#hints\nUse an empty string.\n. 1. You can to use the function $('.star').raty('readOnly', boolean); or use the readOnly as callback.\n2. Yes, it can be a good feature for all callbacks, try it:\n``` js\n, _bindClick: function() {\n  var self = this,\n      that = $(self);\nself.stars.on('click.raty', function(evt) {\n    var execute = true;\nif (self.opt.click) {\n  execute = self.opt.click.call(self, parseFloat(self.score.val()), evt);\n}\n\nif (execute) {\n  self.score.val((self.opt.half || self.opt.precision) ? that.data('score') : this.alt);\n}\n\n});\n}\n``\n. You need to change thestarOn,startOffandcancelOnandcalcelOff.\nThesize` options just changes the icon wrap to fit it.\n. Hi,\nYou can use Font with version 2.6.0 and control the size via CSS. width and size was removed. The size of star is dynamically discovered. But if you use image, you still must to change the icon, since it does not change on the fly.\n. Check if you jquery.raty.min.js file was imported.\n. Hi,\nI tried it here and works fine. Using version 2.6.0.\n. While readonly, the hint is equal the score setted.\n. The hints, that is just alt attribute, is setted on the starts, not on the div.\nhttp://wbotelhos.com/raty#half\n. Thanks @dentarg! (:\n. Hi,\nI don't know how to support it, but I'll check it out on the next version. (;\n. Hi,\nNow you can use Font with version 2.6.0.\n. Raty just keep the value inside a hidden field called score by default.\nYou must get it and save into your database.\n. Quoted: \"Raty just keep the value inside a hidden field called score by default.\nYou must get it and save into your database.\"\n. Hi,\nLike I said, just create some placeholders for each star and populate it as you wish.\n. Hi,\nYes, it is. Just configure both.\n. Could you create a test simulating it?\n. Hi,\nMaybe it is related with this commit.\nIf it still happen, please reopen this issue.\n. Hi,\nI don't want to use CSS to keep this plugin simple.\nI know fonts and CSS is better then a image, but with image I can keep the thing really simple and compatible.\nMaybe you can try to change the class of a div instead to change a src of a \u00ecmg`.\n. Thanks a lot,\nBut the idea of change the element type (#116) instead an attribute where we need to do if, is better.\nAnd use the prefix fa is bad, because force the user to use it. We do not need to import all Font Awesome just to use 3 icons, better than this is download just the icons you want, and it won't be fa prefix, but what user choose.\nSorry, you did a great job, but I'll accept and customizer the other issue, where you can improve later.\nThanks again.\n. Hi,\nI sorry for it, but I'm without server to keep it for now.\nYou can download the project, inside it has index.html with the same content.\n. Hi,\nYou can use the callback for it:\njs\n$('#star').raty({\n  score: function() {\n    return $(this).attr('data-score');\n  }\n});\nThe same works for the attributes score, readOnly and number.\nAnd you have the attributes target and targetKeep to set and element with your choosed score.\n. data-value:\n- The feature already exists.\nYour way: we must to use your hard coded name like data-value.\nThe actual way: you can get any name you want dinamically.\njs:\nYour way:\n- we do not need to write the properties, because it is already inside (coupling, bad) the script;\n- we will have the same feature duplicated with one hard coded.\nThe actual way:\n- you must to write the callback (decoupling, good);\n- the feature is already done and the devs can use any markup them want.\nset score:\nLike I said, we already have this features.\nSorry SAPessi, I appreciate your time, but it was already done.\nThanks! (:\n. Hi,\njs\n$('#star').raty('score', number);           // Set the score.\n. Hi guys,\nI'm working on it.\nI lost my instance on Amazon and then I began to rewrite my blog.\nNow I'm creating a new labs for all my plugins with a better way to maintain and with comments feature.\nSorry, but it will be avaliable soon. :)\n. By the way,\nJust download the package, inside on it has the demo page (index.html) ;)\n. Closed by https://github.com/wbotelhos/raty/pull/130\n. Hi,\nIf you change the dom, then you must apply the Raty again on the next state.\n. Thanks! (:\n. Hi,\nFirst all, sorry for the late answer.\nYour pull request is kind dirty with merge, a bouch of identation issues and so one.\nI know the things changed a lot until now, so... could you do a new clean pull request?\nI'll let it opened for now just to remember about this feature.\nI could implement it, but I preferer your name on it.\nThanks again! (:\n. Thanks.\n. @ikudriavtsev Thank you for you code.\nCould you add some test for it? There is a lot of code here.. Hi,\nRaty is not responsible for it. It is a rule of your application.\nTry to set a checkbox with \"not applicable\" or something.\n. Thanks! (:\n. Hi,\nUse the version 2.6.0 that supports callback for path option.\n. Your icon must have the same size.\nThe size option calculates the width area necessary to fit all stars.\n. Hi,\nIf you want dynamically size, use Font instead with version 2.6.0.\n. Hi piernik,\nThe World Cup is happening just now, and all this fixes too.\nI'm on 3g hotspot, without internet. (thanks Dilma).\nI'll fix it soon!\n. Hi,\nKeep minified version on repository is kind deprecated.\nWe already have a lot of frameworks to do that, like Grunt or even on internet.\nOther problem is the strategy I choose for minify, maybe is not the same of the developer.\n. Hi,\n1. I could not reproduce this error. Could you send a test to break the feature?\n2. The target demo is just on example, the beautiful is up to you to build.\n. Hi Andrew,\nThank you for the pull request.\nCould you tell me where I can find more about this feature?\nIs it possible to create some specs to ensure that everything works fine with it?\n. For what I saw and happened with me on my Job...\nIf Require JS is present on project it will load the lib even if don't want, right?\nI just afraid to make a auto \"load/dependency\" like the plugins Time Ago and Aloha does.\nI'm rewriting all the code as prototype, lets apply it on next version, ok?\n. Hi @AndrewEastwood ,\nCould you rebase the code for merge?\nIs there any way to add test for this code?. Yes,\nNot yet, you may using the master code not released yet.\nCheck the last release here: https://github.com/wbotelhos/raty/releases\n. Hi,\njQuery Raty 2.6.0 now supports Fonts.\n. number: 1\nBut you can't click again to unselect it. You should use cancel button.\nBut if you want something like a :heart:, then you don't need a plugin.\n. It was fixed on version 2.7.0.\n. Hi,\nCan you detail your problem with code, live code or error output?\n. Thanks man,\nNow it is working.\n. Hi,\nCould you send just the bower package.\nChange the icons name is not right and breaks the build.\n. I saw,\nBut you push this commit together: https://github.com/yadhu/raty/commit/3c517a636a25b323ec9d26abacf2dee9cdc29cef\nIt broke the build and is not right.\nCould you do another clear single push?\n. Thank you! :)\n. Submit, prevents and so is not Raty's responsability.\nTry something like: http://jsfiddle.net/z67kR/1/\n. Maybe you need to adjust you round option.\n. Hi,\nMaybe we should add CSS, images and fonts on main key as array.\nDid you tried it?\n. Hi Alex,\nThank you for the free account.\nI hope it comes back soon.\nI'm migrating my blog to Rails 4 and Ruby 2 and for now I'm doing some crazy experiences.\nFor now you can download the repository and to use the offline documentation. It is the same of online on.\nSorry for now, it will be back soon.\n. Thanks all!\nNow we running over Ruby 2.2.0 and Rails 4.2.0.\nHope it does not waste a lot of memory anymore and the Blogy keeps online.\nAnd thank you Alex for the credentials, I'll enjoy soon. <3\n. Use the code from master.\n. I do not use Netflix, but can you use more than one Raty one below another?\n. Thanks! (:\n. Thank you @redd !. Hi,\nUse the master code with this fix.\nI need to generate a new tag.\nSorry.\n. Ok, but we do not have the namespace raty anymore https://www.npmjs.com/package/raty.\nratyjs, raty-js, js-raty?\n. @llaski I follow the common names found there, check it out: https://www.npmjs.com/package/raty-js\n. Hi @peterjurkovic ,\nCould you simulate it with a test?. Raty does not support % highlight. Just half of full.\n. I did not know that now we have to edit manually a release to be considered.\nThe last tag will not be the official release automatically. We need to edit the release with a changelog. Thanks for the notification. 2.7.0, is the last one.\n. No,\nIt is too much obvious if you read the documentation: http://wbotelhos.com/raty#click\nEven has the evt argument after.\n. Hi,\nIf you to use image, you need to change the image.\nBut you can use font and just change the font-size.\n. Could you create a spec for that?\n. Raty works with data attribute a long time ago, but as a whitelist @arturmamedov: https://github.com/wbotelhos/raty/blob/master/lib/jquery.raty.js#L62\nThis commit just apply all data as option. I don't know if it is a good idea we have all data attributes cached on plugin.\n@troyharvey Why not enable the scoreName callback? What do you thing about whitelist load over load all attributes?\n. The problem with all that is the Fat DOM. By the way, this code has no test.\n. Hi, @arturmamedov , the problem is this code has no test. Me or someone else must to do that. ;). Hi @NelsonScott ,\nCould you add some teste for it?. We need some specs, there are a couple of code here.\n. Hi, could you check if version 2.7.1 solve this issue?\n. The assets are just a example that can be used.\nIf we set lib/jquery.raty.css we need to include the fonts too and we decided that the user will use fonts.\nIf we do not set lib/jquery.raty.css we need to include the images and we decided that the user will use images.\nMake sense include this files on main?. @cplaetzinger Could you add some test for it?. Hi @kkirsche ,\nHere the spec https://github.com/bower/spec/blob/master/json.md#version and it really deprecated.\nCould you solve the conflict to be merged?. js\n$('div').raty('score', number);          // Set the score.\n. I've never seen, maybe someone can help you.\n. I'll close this issue @Henry-Cullen , if someone else have this error, maybe we can try to find a bug on code.. This options is about stars, not cancel button.\nMaybe we can include the cancel space on it.\nWhat do you think?\n. Console is always open for that.\nFacebook prevents Firebug in some way, but I have no ideia about it.\n. You can do it on your CSS.\n. You will need to change it like:\njs\nel.find('img').css({ height: '16px', width: '16px' });\nUse a bigger image and change it size on render is not good practice because you will wast size load.\nTry to create an icon with the size you really need, or do that hack.\n. @SeoNerd \nIs it solves your problem?. Thank you! (:\n. Try iconRange options.\nCheck the demo page to know how it works. \n. Hi @Yhzhtk ,\nI don't know this framework.\nIf you want to make a PR, we can support it.. Hi,\nYou need to return false to prevent it.\n. Hi,\nPlease, check the documentation:\n$('div').raty('score', number);          // Set the score.\n. Did you prevent the score with return false?\n. You return is on else, but your action is on if.\n. Hi,\nI think you should do a separated script tag to import and another one to call the raty, inside $(function() { // here }).. Using Rails, you will need to import you assets from manifest (application.js). You should not set the local path app/assets.... You can check it going on your page source and clicking on link that will be broken. Try to look for: \"Precompiling assets on Rails\". I need to check the need of the method reload. Because this method just destroy and create again. Maybe it adds a extra data that prevents this. I'll check it soon. Thank you.. Hi @minennick \n\n$(...).raty is not a function\n\nraty won't be a function if it is not imported. Check your Page Source and check if the path is right and check the Network section of Chrome to see if assets was loaded.. @minennick \nIf you are using Rails, your path should come from an image_path, since we need to now the name of the asset plus the MD5 value like: /assets/icons/start-on-123md5here.svg.\nYou need some think like:\nstarEmptyOff: '<%= image_path 'vendor/raty/star-empty-off.svg' %>',\nstarHalf:     '<%= image_path 'vendor/raty/star-half.svg' %>',\nstarOff:      '<%= image_path 'vendor/raty/star-off.svg' %>',\nstarOn:       '<%= image_path 'vendor/raty/star-on.svg' %>'\n\nYou assets into app/assets/images / app/assets/javascripts / app/assets/stylesheets.\nEverythig imported with the right path.\n\nFor more doubt I recomend to use the StackOverflow, since we used to use Issues for bugs. (:. Hi,\nYes, you need to turn of the readOnly first, so you'll be able to do that.. Hi @JustinGaravel ,\nFor now, my blog will be offline. You can check the demo folder to see some examples or just see the options on README.md.. Hi @ecabuk ,\nIt is not. Could you open a pull request removing it?. Hi @hoangnkvti , removes the node entry solves the problem?. Thanks! (:. Hi @muri9du ,\nWhat do you think if we set a classe on the wrapper to indicate the stars is readonly?\nWith that, we can use just CSS over JS to change the cursor.. Hi @HiIcy ,\nCould you please write in english.\nI tried to translate, but I did not understood, sorry.. Thank you, @tfantina ! (:. Could you to use triple equal (===) on comparison and the short way !$(this.opt.targetScore).length?\n. You forgot a comma here. ^^\n.

I've changed this to\nscore   = parseInt(Math.ceil(this.score.val()), 10),\n...and now it shows the correct message.\n. That simple patch doesn't seem to mess up the calculations just fixes the tiny issue I talked about. For example, if you have a rating of 0.5 the actual code at GitHub will show \"No ratings yet\" but half a star is shown. This makes the user think there is an error with the rating system. With that small code change it will show \"Terrible\". Same thing happens for other half stars.\nThis doesn't affect the alt tag but the title tag.\nFor the other issue about half stars with hints I guess it could be as simple as creating an array for hints that is the double of the size (if we got 5 stars enter 10 hints)... Then, instead of converting it to an Int just round it up to the nearest half and multiply the value by 2... then substract one as always...\n0.5 * 2 = 1 --> 1 -1 = 0\n1 * 2 = 2 --> 2 - 1 = 1\n1.5 * 2 = 3 --> 3-1 = 2\n...\n5*2 = 10 --> 10-1 = 9\nAnd there you go, hints for half stars \nEdit: Just make sure the length of the hints is equal to the number of stars * 2 and half stars are enabled before aplying this formulas. Rounding to the nearest half:\nnearestHalf = Math.Round(score/0.5) * 0.5;\nMaybe it's not a clean hack but certainlly works :)\nIf you wish to include a js tooltip I would go for an already existing JS library... if the library is there, then show the tooltip, if it's not there then do it as it has been done up until now. The tooltip code could be large and embedding it in raty code would make it useless from other code (ie. Form validation), however using an external library allows the developer to use the tooltips in other places... There could even be a callback for a mouseover event that way the developper may chose what tooltip he wants to use.\nThe callback method could make a cleaner solution for the hints issue.\nIf bandwidth is an issue it would also be nice to get sprites for the stars :)\n.

You also missed the data-score attribute on your .star-rating div (see below).\nIf you put the jquery.raty.js in app/assets/javascripts folder (as mackenzie did) you do not need to edit application.js. The script will load, and precompile with all the other JS automatically because of its location. \nBut, because jquery.raty.js is @wbotelhos script (as opposed to your own), it lives, by convention, in vendor/assets/javascripts folder. If you put it there, then to load and precompile it add this line to your application.js:\n//= require jquery.raty\n\nPut the star-half.png, star-off.png and star-on.png to your app/assets/images folder. \nInstead of adding your jQ Raty customization code to your movies show page (as mackenzie does), add it where it by convention belongs, to your reviews.coffee:\n$( document ).on 'turbolinks:load', ->\n  $( '.star-rating' ).raty\n    path: '/assets',\n    readOnly: true,\n    score: ->\n      $( this ).attr( 'data-score' )\n  return\n\nIndentation matters. \nRails specific $( document ).on 'turbolinks:load', -> replaces jQ \"traditional\" $( document ).ready ->. Swap them (after you get it working) and navigate to movies show pages to see why, or look at: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18770517/rails-4-how-to-use-document-ready-with-turbo-links. Not doing it this way will also cause the stars to not show.\nThe score: ... key:value pair reads the value of the movie rating from the containing .star-rating div's attribute data-score; because that's where you supply it (via review.rating) by this code in your movies show page:\n<div class='star-rating' data-score=<%= review.rating %>></div>\n\nHope this helps.. @lauroengineer, to display Raty's stars at all, use: $( document ).on 'turbolinks:load', -> instead of: $( document ).ready -> (see http://stackoverflow.com/q/18770517/247626). This allows Raty to display the stars but it may be the reason why extra \"ghost\" stars appear on browser back-tracing. To fix that issue, use Raty's own: $( 'container' ).raty( 'reload' ); per @jakeland's https://github.com/wbotelhos/raty/issues/198#issuecomment-270380245. \nMy review.coffee looks like this:\n# Read and convert numeric rating to Stars (on views/reviews/_review):\n$( document ).on 'turbolinks:load', ->\n  $( '.star-rating' ).raty\n    path: '/assets'\n    readOnly: true\n    score: ->\n      $( this ).attr( 'data-score' )\n  # reload to remove ghost stars on browser back tracing:\n  $( '.star-rating' ).raty( 'reload' )\n\n# Read and convert numeric rating to Stars, set Star rating (on views/reviews/_form):\n$( document ).on 'turbolinks:load', ->\n  $( '#star-rating' ).raty\n    path: '/assets'\n    scoreName: 'review[rating]'\n    score: ->\n      $( this ).attr( 'data-score' )\n  $( '#star-rating' ).raty( 'reload' )\n\n. @jakeland, that did it, thank you! .

    "mSafdarAli": "i had the same problem. After looking into it, i found out that you just need to include require_tree and require jquery.raty in application.js file.\nIt worked for me and hopefully will work for you too.. ",
    "minennick": "hey guys,\nim getting an Uncaught TypeError: $(...).raty is not a function which hopefully is the reason for me the stars are not getting showed. But i dont know how to handle it.\nWhat i've done so far:\nAdding the images to app/assets/images\nputting the jquery.raty.js into vendor/assets/javascripts\nputting //= require jquery.raty into my application.js\nand putting \n<script>\n        $('.star-rating').raty({\n          path: '/assets',\n          readOnly: true,\n          score: function() {\n                return $(this).attr('data-score');\n        }\n      });\n</script>\ninto my show.html.erb file\ni also tried mckenziechilds tutorial which didnt work out for me.\nwith the coffee @arta is mentioning i dont get any errors but the stars are still not shown. \ni hope someone can help me out on this, thx. Hi @wbotelhos \nwhat do you mean by \n\nCheck your Page Source and check if the path is right\n\npath: '/assets', in my script should be rigth. but i checked the Network section of Chrome and some assets are loaded but jquery.raty.js is not. So the question is why? \nI tried a few different things:\nputting jquery.raty.js back to app/assets/javascripts\nand tried precompiling in config/initializers/assets.rb\nEDIT\ni was able to fix it by precompiling with  Rails.application.config.assets.precompile += %w( jquery.raty.js)\nand putting <%= javascript_include_tag 'jquery.raty.js', \"data-turbolinks-track\": false %> into my show.html.erb. But i dont really know why i had to precompile it. Still thank you very much @wbotelhos for this amazing work\n. ",
    "jakeland": "Hey, in case you need a quick fix, I've found that by adding : \n$('.star-rating').raty('reload');\nafter the function that renders the stars, you can avoid this problem. \nTo clarify, this is the way my code is set up\n//get and render star rating\n  $('.star-rating').raty({\n    path: '/assets/',\n    readOnly:true,\n    score: function(){\n      return($(this).attr('data-score'));\n    }\n  })\n//reload stars/stop duplication\n$('.star-rating').raty('reload');\nOriginally had it set up with the reload first, but that threw errors in the console. .
