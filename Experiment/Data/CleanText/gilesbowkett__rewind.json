Thanks for the work here, and sorry re the delay in responding. I'll have to dig into this, but if I use it, I'd definitely rename basic_stats.

The -o option is much faster than tally_authors, although other flags seemed slower in a large repo (informal, groggy, early morning assessment here; no actual benchmarking done).\n. thanks! and sorry for the two-year-plus delay. :-)\n. hey, sorry for the colossal (two-year) delay in responding.
