    "tbruyelle": "Thank you !\n. Thanks it's more clean\n. Well it was something I expected, because I totally neglect lifecycle handling... until now :)\nI will try to find a solution.\n. OK it will be hard to fix that problem properly. \nRxjava and activity/fragment lifecycle have been discussed a lot and as far as I know there is no clean solution. \nWe can easily prevent the crash by making RxPermissions a singleton, so after the rotation change and the user answers to the permission request, the corresponding subject is found. But when the lib emits the response, the observer is still linked to the old activity, so it has no effect to the current new activity.\nThe main problem here is we have rebind the subscription in the newly created activity, after the rotation change. This can be done manually by the user, he unsubscribes when the activity dies and resubscribe when the new activity pops. But I don't like that since it adds too much code for the user.\nIf someone has a good idea, it would be pleasure to hear.\n. Wow thank you all for taking your time to give help.\nAbout making RxPermissions survives the activity lifecycle, a simple singleton seems good enough (I tested that in a branch).\nAs @dlew and I said, the main problem is really to rebind the subscription after the death/rebirth of the activity, and I'm more and more convinced this is not possible easily. The main goal of this library is to keep things simple and to provide Observables. So I start to think about trade-offs.\nWhen you request a permission, the framework starts a activity called .permission.ui.GrantPermissionsActivity (I saw that in logcat), this activity shows a dialog and survives the rotation change. But if it doesn't survive, there is no more issue ! The user will have to re-trigger the permission request, but I don't think this is really embarrassing.\nSo the question is, can I alter that activity's lifecycle, or maybe more plausible ask it to kill itself when I detect the rotation change ?\nWDYT ? \n. Just release a new version 0.2.0 : \n- RxPermissions is now a singleton gettable with getInstance(Context). This fix the crash.\n- Add an internal activity to handle the onRequestPermissionsResult so it's no more needed to override this method in the user acitivity.\nThat said, the problem about detached subscriber on rotation change is still there.\n. @domsu Yeah this is something to which I already thought, and this is easy to implement with RxJava. We just add a doOnSubscribe(lock) and a doOnTerminate/doOnUnscubscibe(unlock) to the observable.\nBut it can be intrusive, maybe we could make it optional ? As you said it's not a good pattern, but if it shock anyone, I'm ready to implement it, as a recommended option. \n. @andaag Yep I agree. So 2 solutions, put the project to the trash or add hacky trade-offs...\nI prefer the solution 2 because for me the project brings more good than harm. \nit doesn't bother me to lock the rotation during the permission request. And if for some rooted devices it's not possible to lock the rotation, the users will have to request the permission twice, this doesn't matter.\nFor other configuration changes, like language change, same thing. I mean, it's not very common that a user changes the language while an app is requesting a permission.\nBy explicitly warning the library's users of these trade-offs, I think we can move forward.\n. @dlew Actually with the shadow activity introduced in version 0.2.0, we have such tool ! Nice. \nAbout 3, I have no control on the runtime permission request (other than create a new one), I can't cancel or resume it. The permission request is resumed automatically after a configuration change. \nAnyway, a solution begins to take shape :\n\na permission request is triggered : RxPermissions registers a subject associated with that permission and requests the framework : the runtime permission popup appears.\na configuration change occurs : RxPermissions unsubscribes all registered subjects, but keeps in memory the pending requests. It will survive the configuration change because it's a singleton since 0.2.0.\n   The runtime permissions popup is paused and will be resumed automatically.\nthe app restarts : The permission request is redone by the app (this is actually the only requirement, but as @dlew said it's a logical outcome), RxPermissions remembers a pending request has been done for this permission, and registers a new subject for it, but doesn't request the framework a second time (otherwise the result would be another runtime permissions popup).\n   The runtime permissions popup is resumed and displayed again.\nuser answers to the permission request : RxPermissions.onRequestPermissionsResult is invoked, the lib finds the corresponding subject and emits the user response. \n\nThat sounds not bad...\n. Interesting, but I'm not sure to understand how things are connected together.\n. Nice, please link the library when it's ready. \nAbout the name, sorry I have no idea.\n. I pushed a PR #14 that aims to fix the issue. I would appreciate if some of you review it.\nThe fix removes some flexibility to the lib but I didn't find anything better.\nThe good news is for clients who request the permission during activity/fragment/view start, nothing change, it will  work as these.\nFor client who request the permission after a particular event, there is some breaking changes :\n- Firstly, they need to move the request call in one of the activity/fragment/view start method.\n- Secondly, they need to add an extra parameter to the request or requestEach method : an Observable that represents that particular event. See the PR for details.\nExample from the sample app, the click event is transformed to an observable with RxBinding :\n``` java\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.act_main);\n\n     // com.jakewharton.rxbinding.view.RxView is perfect to represent the event needed\n    Observable<Object> trigger = RxView.clicks(findViewById(R.id.enableCamera));\n\n     RxPermissions.getInstance(this)\n            .request(trigger, Manifest.permission.CAMERA)\n            .subscribe(granted -> {\n\n```\n. @andaag Thanks for the help but I think I found a solution which bring less changes on the client side.\n. > For just glancing at the code, I'm guessing your using the permission itself as an identifier for the request? That means you can only request a permission from one place in the app. If you want the camera permission in 3 different places your gonna need another identifier.\nI think it should work. From the beginning the lib has been designed with concurrent access in focus. For instance, if there's 3 camera permission requests from 3 different places, the same observable is returned to the subscribers. So when the user's answer is caught, all subscribers will receive it. \nThat said, if the requests are done very simultaneously, it won't work as expected since I forgot to use synchronized... That's another small improvement.\n. I uploaded a snapshot version\ngradle\ncompile 'com.tbruyelle.rxpermissions:rxpermissions:0.4.0@aar'\n. @andaag I tested a little more and it works also if you make the permission request in View.onFinishInflate or any methods invoked during the app initialization.\nSo you're not limited to onCreate/onResume.\n. > you never remove anything from mSubjects it'll leak.\nWhen the lib receives the permission request answer, the subject receives onComplete which unsubscribe all subscribers, and is removed from the list.\nhttps://github.com/tbruyelle/RxPermissions/blob/lifecycle-handling/lib/src/main/java/com/tbruyelle/rxpermissions/RxPermissions.java#L274\n. Yes you're right, I probably should make RxPermissions.onDestroy() public, to unsubscribe all subjects.\n. @andaag Thanks for the report, I noticed that bug last friday. The issue is due to the take(1) which prevents the trigger observable to emit more than one item. I removed it here 2455bcf21d5ac9adc82e6f89786d6de2a085b89c but now I have to fix the request method which doesn't work any more. \nIndeed, take(1) was here to ensure the sequence was completed, this is mandatory because request use toList() to transform the original sequence to a single boolean (toList() requires completed sequence or else it emits nothing).\nI have an idea of the final fix, I'll publish it today.\n. So version 0.4.1 brings some other fixes, including the one mentioned by @andaag \ngradle\ncompile 'com.tbruyelle.rxpermissions:rxpermissions:0.4.1@aar'\nI think I'll soon merge the PR #14 \n. Good point. \nDo you know if there's relation between PackageManager.checkPermission and Context.checkSelfPermission() ?\nMy first attempt to fix thgis issue is to check PackageManager.checkPermission only pre-M but I have a doubt, maybe I should check it for all versions ?\n. @ffgiraldez Yes I saw that but I didn't use it to prevent an external dependency and also because I thought it's easy to implement.\nBut I wasn't aware of the PackageManager.checkPermission thing. I would like to see the source of ContextCompat.checkSelfPermissions() but it seems it's not released yet (https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_support/blob/master/v4/java/android/support/v4/content/ContextCompat.java)\n. ContextCompat.checkSelfPermissions() is now visible, but there is no call to PackageManage.checkPermission().\n. Closed because no idea of what to do here\n. It depends on the usage. Most of the time I think people only want to know if the user has granted all the requested permissions. So a simple boolean is enough.\nThat said, your proposal is good. What if we add another method to the API, let's say requestDetailed() which returns an Observable<Map<String,Boolean>>  ?\n. I'm not sure about the map thing. Are you saying the method should return Observable<HashMap<String, Boolean>> rather than Observable<Map<String, Boolean>> ?\n. Yep agree with @alorma. \nUntil now I never heard of that kind of rule. And in this library's context, I don't see any benefit for the consumer to explicitly know the concrete type of the Map.\n. Not silly at all, but interesting. This is absolutely feasible with RxJava.\nIf I'm right,  permission.shouldRequestAgain() is related to shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale. I started a basic support for this method in #8, but implemented it differently. I chose to create a independent method so you can mix the observables, like here.\nwhat is the way you prefer ?\n. Yes there is less code in theory but what do you do mostly if shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale returns true ? \nYou show the user an explanation with a dialog and once he agrees, request the permission a second time. That's why I did it like that. \nThat said, I'm not 100% sure this is the best way.\n. I just create that PR, please tell me if this fits your needs. \nPlease comment on the PR.\n. Released in version 0.3.0\n. Thank you for your time, I started a similar feature in a branch, and actually it doesn't solve the problem.\nTake the sample app, remove previously granted permission, run it and click on the button. Then if you rotate the device while the permission popup is displayed, and grant or deny the permission, nothing will happen. This is because the function attached to the Observable is linked to the destroyed activity, and it has no effect to the new one.\nThe main problem is really to rebind that function from the destroyed activity to the new one. And I'm not even sure it's possible.\nThat said, I like the invisible/shadow activity idea, so I'll probably use your PR later, and merge it with my branch.\n. > I think that this library should not be concerned with managing the observable for the consume\nYeah you're probably right, but I'm disappointed because this will complicate a lot the usage of the library.\n. Implemented in ef4aed66a57c52f06b9679c2acac376a7d62c433\nThanks anyway\n. Thanks\n. Good point\n. I created a PR with a basic support, wdyt ? \nPlease comment on the PR.\n. Released in version 0.3.0\n. Yes we need to fix #3 to have a stable release.\n. The screen rotation is only the visible part of the iceberg, we need to handle every configuration changes.\nSo no, locking the rotation change in your app is not enough.\nHowever, since 0.2.0, there is no more crash, but the onNext's code you registered before the configuration change will never be executed.\n. Thanks for the compliment ^^ \nI hope we will find a proper solution.\n. Well I'm not sure to see the benefit also. \nPlus I hate fragments.\n. (@digitalbuddha That's also what I did with my job's app. Now I use only activities and views, and I feel better. No more weird exceptions and other horrible things.)\n. Good point @andretietz, and I've just noticed that Fragment have also a onRequestPermissionResult method. So it seems feasible, and would probably has a smaller footprint than the activity.\n. I'm working on #3 currently, so feel free to send a PR if you can. That would be nice, thanks in advance.\n. @richarddd thanks for that\n. Closed for no activity\n. This is code generated by Android Studio, I hope it's correct :D\n. The goal of RxPermissions is not to handle onActivityResult. Maybe you could create an other library for that.\n. ok, first you don't need to check the sdk version, it's handled by the library. If Build.VERSION.SDK_INT < 23, the observer will immediately receive a granted result.\nSecondly, it seems you're not well informed about runtime permissions. Only a  part of the permissions requires a request : the dangerous ones, as Google names them [1]. \nAbout the crash itself, I think it's exactly because you request permissions that don't need to be requested. Try to filter the parameter list with only dangerous permissions and it should work.\nThat said you pointed a weakness in the library that needs a fix. Thanks !\n[1] https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/security/permissions.html#normal-dangerous\n. After some tests, there is finally no issue in requesting non-dangerous permissions, but the framework will always answer the permission is not granted. The answer is propagated without change by the library.\nCould you tell me if you still have the issue with the last version of RxPermissions ?\n. Closed for no activity\n. No, the minSdkVersion to use this library is 9\nI will add that in the README.\n. What do you want me to check ? mCtx.checkSelfPermission(permission) is not even a call to this library.\n. I know I use it.\nThe method hasPermission_ is only called if current sdk is >=23.\n. > if targetSdk is not 23, permissions dialog is always not showing .\nFair enough since runtime permissions are only available for target 23.\n. Thanks!\n. As you can see, this method is not public. It's invoked internally by the ShadowActivity.\nI document only the public API.\n. Interesting. The documentation I found [1] on @RequiresPermission doesn't tell how it works, so I can't figure out how to handle that.\nI'll try to look further.\n[1] http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/support-annotations\n. No sorry, I didn't.\n. Thanks for the report. \nI also read that post, and unlike ActivityCompat, RxPermissions doesn't delegate the permission request to PackageManager but returns true immediatly. So this issue is already handled.\n. No problem\n. Because I'm lazy. Maven central needs more than just an aar.\n. That would be nice\nLe lun. 23 nov. 2015 18:28, Saad Farooq notifications@github.com a \u00e9crit :\n\nGot it... will try to put up a PR when I get the time\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/tbruyelle/RxPermissions/issues/21#issuecomment-159003300\n.\n. Thanks @eleventigers \n\n@martyglaubitz if you're OK with the implementation, please close the issue.\n. I discover this method, it sounds very similar to shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale().\nI don't know if it should be implemented in the library, the only benefit in that case would be to handle the sdk version.\n. Fixed in 0.5.0\n. Very clean PR thanks !\n. Is there a reason why you used variadic parameters in isRevoled ? (other than replicating isGranted's signature)\nI'm asking you that because in the current code state there's no good reason to use variadic parameters for both isResolved and isGranted. I would like to change that and use a standard parameter, a permission.\n. I will :)\n. 0.5.0 deployed with your PR and without variadic param.\n. 1. It prevents to leak an Activity if the user passes that kind of class in the method invocation.\n2. What do you mean ?\n3. Not planned, I'm not sure of what benefits can bring a Kotlin version of the library.\n4. What are you talking about ? Please detail.\n. 1. I know RxLifecycle, but I don't see the benefits of an integration with RxPermissions.\n2. Support lib hides the result of version check, whereas I need the information to feed the Observables. The lib manipulates Observables, Support lib doesn't. \n. Could you make an unique PR with the version upgrade and the fix on subjects ?\nYou can push that commit into your branch rxjava110 and close #26. That should be ok.\nThanks in advance\n. No need to squash thx\n. Of course, but you have to do it yourself.\n. No I don't want to add this kind of feature in the library. I don't want UI dependency.\n. If I need to show an explanation before ask permissions, I would show a dialog with the explanation and trigger the permission request on dialog dismiss.\n. Already fixed in #24, but I need to release it. I will do it asap,\n. 0.5.1 released, it should fix your problem.\n. If you use Android Studio, type new Ctrl+Space and it will suggest the correct class to implement.\n. Ok I removed retro lambda usage from the sample app.\n. Done\n. Well, I also use the library to request multiple times a critical permission, but I don't have the problem you describe. That said I'm not using those damned fragments.\nRather than removing the onDestroy content, could you try to wipe the subject list at the end of RxPermissions.onDestroy() :\ndiff\n void onDestroy() {\n        log(\"onDestroy\");\n        // Invoke onCompleted on all registered subjects.\n        // This should un-subscribe the observers.\n        for (Subject subject : mSubjects.values()) {\n            subject.onCompleted();\n        }\n+      mSubjects.clear();\n    }\nTell me if it fixes your issue.\n. Oh I think I get it this time. So as you explained there's no reason why an activity started with FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK propagate a onDestroy event to a singleton like the RxPermissions class.\nI think we can safely remove the ShadowActivity.onDestroy method.\nCould you check if it's OK for you and then open a PR ? I will try to release it quickly.\n. Sorry I'm going to reverse that change because it breaks configuration change handling.\nWhen you request a permission, you see the permission dialog, if before answer you rotate your phone, your app is restarted and the permission dialog pops again automatically (it's not because of RxPermissions). If you answer at this time, the rx chaining should be invoked properly, but not any more since that change.\n. Please keep RxPermissions.onDestroy() it can be usefull to invoke it manually.\nEnsure also the tests are passing.\nThanks in advance\n. Ok version 0.5.2 has been deployed to bintray with your fix. Thanks for the contribution!\n. Thanks for that, but I didn't manage to upload an artifact.\nFirst I fixed the package name (see 08b227cea808ca9fcf6d8b3e499c8488c6337c87)\nI filled my bintray user and api key, generated the pom and jar with the install task (maybe there's a task which do not copy the files in ~/.m2 ?), and tried to upload with bintrayUpload task. It returns me success but then I can't find the artifact in jcenter.\nIf I rerun bintrayUpload I got an error telling me the artifact already exists.\n``` sh\n* What went wrong:\nExecution failed for task ':rxpermissions:bintrayUpload'.\n\nCould not upload to 'https://api.bintray.com/content/tbruyelle/tbruyelle/RxPermissions/0.5.2/com/tbruyelle/rxpermissions/rxpermissions/0.5.2/rxpermissions-0.5.2.aar': HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict [message:Unable to upload files: An artifact with the path 'com/tbruyelle/rxpermissions/rxpermissions/0.5.2/rxpermissions-0.5.2.aar' already exists]\n```\n. > The first time (and that's the step missing), you have to link your repo with jcenter, here in linked to, add to jcenter. Just fill the form and usually in a few hours will be available :)\n\nOk thanks I did'nt know that.\n\nYou can do directly a gradlew bintrayUpload and will generate the pom and jar and upload it directly.\n\nWell, I'm not sure : \n``` bash\n$ ./gradlew clean rxpermissions:bintrayUpload\nParallel execution with configuration on demand is an incubating feature.\nIncremental java compilation is an incubating feature.\n:rxpermissions:clean\n:sample:clean UP-TO-DATE\n:rxpermissions:clean UP-TO-DATE\n:rxpermissions:bintrayUpload:rxpermissions:bintrayUpload: file /home/tbruyelle/projects/rxpermissions/lib/build/libs/rxpermissions-0.5.2-javadoc.jar could not be found.\n:rxpermissions:bintrayUpload: file /home/tbruyelle/projects/rxpermissions/lib/build/libs/rxpermissions-0.5.2-sources.jar could not be found.\n:rxpermissions:bintrayUpload: file /home/tbruyelle/projects/rxpermissions/lib/build/outputs/aar/rxpermissions-release.aar could not be found.\n FAILED\nFAILURE: Build failed with an exception.\n\n\nWhat went wrong:\nExecution failed for task ':rxpermissions:bintrayUpload'.\n\njava.io.FileNotFoundException: /home/tbruyelle/projects/rxpermissions/lib/build/poms/pom-default.xml (No such file or directory)\n\n\n\nTry:\nRun with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace.

Well sorry I'm still stuck because there's no pom/jar generated with thebintrayUpload` task.\nCan you test again with the jcenter branch of that repo ?\n. Thank you for you time, I finally find the problem I have on my machine it's because my gradle.properties has the following feature enabled : org.gradle.configureondemande. If I disable it the pom and jars are correctly generated. Don't ask me why I enabled this feature, I can't remember !!\nSo I managed to upload the artifact to bintray and I asked a link to jcenter. Wait and see ^^\n. Ok so my repo is still not linked, this is probably because only version 0.5.2 has the requirements for jcenter linkability (pom and jar stuff).\nI can't delete old versions because other people may use them, so I have 2 options\n- manually add bintrayUplload functionnality to each tags (should take some time...)\n- create an other repo with only version 0.5.2 (but I'll loose all my repo stats and at next version some users will complain about missing artfiact because they have kept the original repo).\nShort, this is annoying... Maybe you have better idea ?\n. > I can generate the source jars for the other versions and send them to you (should be apply those commits after the tags of each version and generate).\nYou're nice, but that's fine thank you. I will do it if necessary. I'll wait tomorrow.\n. It's me who thank you for the contribution, I merged the jcenter branch so this PR can be closed.\n. Well that's weird, you get that error because the code is executed on a pre-6 version of Android. This isn't supposed to happen, in RxPermissions the version is checked before invoking that method.\nYou're not trying to start the ShadowActivity manually don't you ?\n. That shouldn't happen, do you see this error frequently in your crashlytics?\n. Closed for no response from submitter \n. Use last version please.\n. I'm not sure your way works when a configuration change occurs.\nCan you test that : \nAsk for a permission not granted yet with your method, see the permission dialog appear, don't answer but rotate your device to trigger a config change, then answer to the permission dialog. If ok your answer should be take into account. If nothing happen, then it means your way doesn't work.\n. Wow thanks dude I'm pleasantly surprised. I was aware of the compose method, I use it for life-cycle handling, but I didn't know it could be useful in that case.\nThat's a lot better than that ugly method signature request(trigger, permissions).\nI will integrate that in the framework.\n. That's a little crazy but you gave me the idea to deprecate all current methods and expose only 2 new methods : \n``` java\n public static Observable.Transformer ensure(final Context ctx, final String... permissions) {\n        return new Observable.Transformer() {\n            @Override\n            public Observable call(Observable o) {\n                return RxPermissions.getInstance(ctx).request(o, permissions);\n            }\n        };\n    }\npublic static Observable.Transformer<Object, Permission> ensureEach(final Context ctx, final String... permissions) {\n    return new Observable.Transformer<Object, Permission>() {\n        @Override\n        public Observable<Permission> call(Observable<Object> o) {\n            return RxPermissions.getInstance(ctx).requestEach(o, permissions);\n        }\n    };\n}\n\n```\nFor permissions request that requires immediately trigger (without a button), users would have to do something like : \njava\nObservable.just(null) // Too bad there's no something like Observable.always()\n     .compose(RxPermissions.ensure(this, perms))\n    .subscribe( granted -> {\n});\nThe major benefit of that refactoring is it forces the user to use the library correctly. Indeed currently it's possible to write the following code : \njava\nbtn.setOnClickListener(v -> RxPermissions.getInstance(this).request(perm).subscribe( { ... ] )\nBut that code doesn't handle configuration change during permission request. So by exposing only composable methods, I make this impossible. What do you think ?\nI still have other checks to do but this sounds very promising.\n. > permissions are requested usually just before they're needed\nunless they're critical permissions https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZqDdvhTZj0\n. Fixed with #38 \n. I agree with you, I integrated your changes in a new branch where I'm trying to refactor/simplify the lib usage. Thanks for the contrib\n. Merged with #38\n. I understand your point but the major benefit of that refactoring is it forces the user to use the library correctly. Indeed currently it's possible to write the following code : \njava\nbtn.setOnClickListener(v -> RxPermissions.getInstance(this).request(perm).subscribe( { ... ] )\nBut that code is wrong, it doesn't handle configuration change during permission request. So by exposing only composable methods, I make this impossible. \n. Yes it's not impossible but in that case I think the user really looks for problems !\nI agree oservable.just(null).compose(...) is ugly, as a replacement we can provide an observable method like you suggested it but I want to make sure there's no possible mistake  in its usage. I don't like very much requestWithoutTrigger(), I still prefer request. \n. @patloew So I undeleted request and requestEach methods, but only the version without trigger. Sounds fine to you ?\n. Do you see it ? The theme used for this activity is already transparent\n. I never noticed that problem, and I tested also on N5.\nAre you sure it's not something due to the moment you request the permission ? I would like to have some details of your usage.\n. Well not sure if it's related to your ptoblem but you shouldn't condition the permission request with savedInstanceState == null. In case of configuration change, the lib won't work properly.\nDo you use the last version 0.6.1 ?\n. Did you move the call ouside the if (savedInstanceState == null) ?\n. This is already the case, I don't understand why you need to override it. Moreover Fullscreen is not necessary.\nhttps://github.com/tbruyelle/RxPermissions/blob/master/lib/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L11\nAnyway it works for you, fine.\n. Interesting, I missed that test. I'll look into it.\n. With \"do not keep activities\" enabled, it works with a standard config change (screen rotate for instance) but not with the steps you described.\nSo a config change doesn't kill your activity like the home button followed by back from recent app, that's frustrating. The proof is ShadowActivity.onDestroy isn't invoked from the framework in that second case. Without that call, RxPermissions isn't able to remind previous permission requests, causing the issue you created.\nDo you know why in that case the android lifecycle is ignored ?\n. Ok I'll move it to onStop() probably.\n. Released in version 0.6.1, thanks for the report.\n. I'm not sure this is relevant to request FINE and COARSE permissions at the same time. \nMoreover I don't see the true benefit of your change. I think this is trivial enough to ask multiple permissions without showing it in the sample app.\n. I fixed the issue, can you check if it's ok with the HEAD version ?\n. Awesome thanks !\n. The crash was introduced with 88d83bb3c07f3bd1aaa6852ce37427c9928d9860 where I moved code from onDestroy to onStop.\nQuick solution is to move the client code in onStart rather than onCreate but I dislike the idea. Too bad we can't rely on onDestroy, since this is the only method in the lifecycle where it is certain that onCreate will be invoked on back. With onStop, it can be onCreate or onStart, it depends... Android lifecycle is really a fucking disaster, so tired of fighting against it for years...\nI try to find an other fix.\n. Yes it's important for a feature that begin to annoy me : multiple request handling. \nBut I'm going to take my axe, remove that feature and at the same time some complicated code. I don't think people uses it. Even me I'm not using it any more.\n. I'm not talking about multiple requests when you provide 2 or more parameters, I'm talking about multiple requests done at the same time for the same permission in 2 different places of your code. \nSo, do you really use that feature ?\n. > I can hardly imagine a case when it could be inevitably needed\nI agree, I was probably drunk when I decided to handle that.\nI pushed a fix to master, could you check if it's ok (also if possible the last test you made about multiple permissions request ?) \nThanks in advance!\n. Good!\nAbout the last issue, I tried to reproduce with sample app, by adding a second permission to the parameter list, with DNKA on, but it worked mostly as expected (mostly because the result was delivered 2 times instead of one to the subscriber, will see if I can improve that).\nWhen you said requested simultaneously you mean by passing more than one parameter ?\n. Done, new version is 0.7.0 since a feature has been removed.\n. No of course it's not by design ^^, it's a bug, probably duplicate with #42.\n. Deployed a new version 0.7.0 that should fix that. Please check.\n. Can you post more code ? I need to understand where and when the library is invoked.\n. Why do you need a second call for the same permission ?\n. I think you should request the permission only one time.\n. Yes but it may be not possible since RxPermission had to deal first with configuration changes. \n. > If I want to deny this permission again\nIts up to the user to grant or deny, you have no control on that.\n. Good question, I presume no but I didn't test with proguard. Could you check that ?\n. It seems the rules are not specific to rx-permissions but more to rx-java, in that case I don't think I should document them. Users simply refer to the rx-java documentation for that purpose.\n. You're probably right, but I didn't find official documentation about proguard rules in the rx-java project. Did you ?\n. Do you answer to the permission dialog on 1. ?\n. Ok there's probably a bug but the case you described is kindy weird... Why the user would go to the settings before answering the permission dialog ?\n. Can you provide a detailled stack trace please?\n. Ok I think I understand. \nWhen you update the app's permissions in the settings, your app is killed, and in that case RxPermissions doesn't save the current state, but the framework save the permission request and so restore it when the user is back.\nRxPermissions should probably save the state when the app is killed, and restore it after. If you have some time to develop a fix, I could merge it. I don't have the time for the moment sorry.\n. @AAverin Note that the bug affects only devices with sdk >= 23\n. @AAverin Agree I want to resolve it but until now nobody found an acceptable fix.\n. Fixed in 0.8.0\n. Your fix prevents the crash but the user response is not propagated to the subscriber, so there's still a problem.\nMoreover it breaks the lifecycle handling. If the user rotates the screen during a permission request, and then answers to the dialog, his reponse is also not propagated to the subscriber, because of your cancel.\n. Can you explain a little bit the steps to reproduce ?\n. Thanks, sorry for the delay I will probably check that on next week.\n. I don't see the ShadowActivity in the recent apps, how do you see it ?\n. Ok so you're talking about your app activity. In that case can you reproduce the case with the sample app ?\n. The library doesn't provide any UI stuff. Its up to you to code your own dialog, toast, snackbar...\n. RxPermissions.shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale doesn't need ShadowActivity because no activity results are delivered. \nAbout documentation, you're right the existence of the method should be mentionned in the README. About how to use it, it simply wraps Activity.shouldShowRequestPermissionRationnale in an observable so I invite you to read the documentation of the android framework.\nHTH\n. When the permission request is triggered by an action menu, you're right it's not trivial to implement it during an initialization phase.\nAlthough it's not ideal, I suggest to use a subject to register the permission request during the initialization phase of the activity, and then emit an arbitrary item in that subject in the menu click listener when you want to trigger the permission request.\nI can provide an example if necessary. Or if you find a better way to do that let me know.\n. Fine, that's also how I use it. \nI would like to provide a better way but it would require dependencies to menu listeners and things like that and so finally I prefer no.\n. Good question, I don't know. On my side I didn't reuse the subject. Not sure if it's good or bad...\n. I didn't understand \n. Close because no response\n. I use the library inside a project monitored with leakcanary and no leak\nwere detected.\nLe mer. 25 mai 2016 10:05, Binasphere notifications@github.com a \u00e9crit :\n\nI didn't see unsubscribe() be called in the sample.

Interesting fix thanks, I have to take time to test it, but I couldn't do that before next week. I'll let you know.\n. So I updated the sample app to test your fix (see branch fix46). I added an other permission to the requested list.\n\nThen : \n- Launch the sample\n- Click on Enable Camera\n- Allow the first permission\n- While the second permission is requested, go to the settings and deny the first\n- Back to the app, and allow the second permission. At this time without your fix, I agree the app crashes. With your fix there's no crash but there's also no emission of the response to the subscriber, as you mentionned it.\nSo sorry but I'm not going to merge that PR, I prefer a visible crash than a ghost partial fix.\n. @artesa So you're telling me that 202 users have this strange behavior of moving to the settings and revoking a permission during a permission request... That's really weird. I suspect it's something else.\n. I understand, but this PR only hides the crashes and doesn't solve the problem.\n. @NitroXenon I have 0 with 2k of active users daily.\n. So I should have about 40 instances of this exception. What I mean is\nthere's maybe something wrong with how you use the library.\nLe mar. 16 ao\u00fbt 2016 02:44, Peter Chan notifications@github.com a \u00e9crit :\n\n@tbruyelle https://github.com/tbruyelle I have 20k of active users\ndaily...\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/tbruyelle/RxPermissions/pull/53#issuecomment-239971503,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAFoeBwVtdnUrUp0QTs5691OynutZ3BYks5qgQfRgaJpZM4IpFBb\n.\n. > I think the amount of crashes depends a lot on how much app uses rx_permissions lib, so you can't make extrapolations like this.\n\nThat's exactly what I mean by \"something wrong\", why your app needs to use the runtime permissions so often ? Usually, it's only a couple of times, once the permissions are set for your app, the framework stops request the user again and again, and so the case where that problem occurs never happens again.\n. Finally merged that PR, before the release, can you @tarasantoshchuk re-check the result if what you expect ? I just moved the hacky code in a specific class.\n.

What I did in my app in that case is showing a single rationale for all requested permissions. It's simple but the caveat is you don't have the detail of which permissions has been revoked. So you can only display a message like \"some critical permissions have been revoked, please go to the settings and fix that\".\n\nHere is a sample code of the method which is passed to the subscribe of request. I used a snackbar for the user feedback : \n``` java\nprivate void onPermissionResult(Boolean granted) {\n        if (granted) {\n           // OK\n            return;\n        }\n        // Test whether the user clicked on \"never ask again\",\n        // adapt the action according to that.\n        RxPermissions.getInstance(this)\n                .shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale(this, CRITICAL_PERMISSIONS)\n                .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())\n                .subscribe(should -> {\n                    SnackBar.Builder snack = new SnackBar.Builder(this)\n                            .withMessageId(R.string.permission_required)\n                            .withDuration(SnackBar.PERMANENT_SNACK)\n                            .withStyle(SnackBar.Style.ALERT);\n                    if (should) {\n                        // \"never ask again\" not clicked, ask the user to retry the permission request.\n                        snack.withActionMessageId(R.string.reask)\n                                .withOnClickListener(token -> {\n                                            // Ask again for permissions                                        \n                                        }\n                                );\n                    } else {\n                        // \"never ask again\" clicked, ask the user to fix that in the app settings.\n                        snack\n                                .withActionMessageId(R.string.settings)\n                                .withOnClickListener(token -> {\n                                            // Open the app settings\n                                            AndroidUtils.startAppDetailsActivity(this);\n                                        }\n                                );\n                    }\n                    snack.show();\n                });\n}\n\n```\n. Please refer a context\n. Closed because no response\n. That's weird, how did you declare the permission in the manifest file ?\n. Closed because no response \n. ?\n. Thanks\n. > since ShadowActivity is public class (and not package-protected) some of library users might start ShadowActivity directly in their code\nThat's crazy\n\nMaybe we should make ShadowActivity package-protected?\n\nwhy not\n. Good job thank you\n. Thanks for the report and the analysis. \nSo the framework did not show the permission dialog again after a pause if the resume is done threw a deep link. RxPermissions should cancel any pending permission request in that case. Do you know how it can detect that ?\n. Sorry I have no idea\n. Because you can't mock static method with mockito, I suggest you to declare a method like that in your activity : \njava\npublic RxPermissions rxPermissions() {\n  return RxPermission.getInstance(this);\n}\nUse this method everywhere you need RxPermissions and then in your test you can simply mock like that : \njava\nRxPermissions rxPermissions = mock(RxPermissions.class);\nwhen(activity.rxPermissions()).thenReturn(rxPermissions);\nwhen(rxPermissions.request(anything()).thenReturn(Observable.just(true));\nHTH\n. Nice one, but that's a breaking change (I think Single didn't exist when the lib was created).\nI will keep that in my mind thanks. \n. The change will come with RxJava2 (see #71)\n. There's also RxPermissions.shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale() if you need to stay in the rx world.\n. I think that's a good idea.\nWe could add an extra field to the Permission object to handle that.\n. will be release in 0.8.0.\nYou now have a new field shoudlShowRequestPermissionRationale to the Permission object.\n. You don't need to get the instance of RxPermission during an init phase, it's required when you invoke methods from that instance.\n. That requirement is due to the permission request dialog, which is displayed by the framework when you call request/ensure and the permission is not granted or not denied permanently. If an activity recreation occurs when that dialog is displayed, then the dialog is restored but there's absolutely no way to get that information from the framework. \nThe only solution is so to invoke the request/ensure in a init phase, and in that case there's a little complex mechanism, which detects pending permission requests.\nThat requirement is clearly the ugliest thing in that library, and there is a long thread about that in #3, but despite the intervention of famous android developers, no better solution could be found.\n. I linked this issue in the readme.\n. Although your changes refer to good old java practices, I don't want to merge them because I think they do not promote code readability.\n. Yes I think that's definitevely something RxPermissions should support.\nI read some days ago the content of RxJava2 and it's a full rewrite, so I wonder how library like RxPermissions should publish new version that breaks everything. I don't want to change the package name or the artifactId. Maybe a jump to version 1.0 is enough to warn the user about the big changes ?\n. RxAndroid is part of the ReactiveX organisation so it sounds logic it adopted the same way.\nI don't think I can use the io.reactivex package, and I don't want to rename the package to something like org.tbruyelle because it doesn't mean anything. Changing artifact id to something like RxPermissions2 is much more meaningful but that's ugly.\n. Ok for changing the package name to com.tbruyelle.rxpermissions2, that's the best alternative I think. \nI'm curious to see how it will be handled in RxBinding.\n. Not me\n. I won't have the time to start that in the next weeks. \nI linked issue #65 about Single<Boolean> usage instead of Observable<Boolean>, I said this will come with rxJava2. But after some experiences I found something annoying with Single, they don't have filter operator. It's logic but for the permission request workflow, it can be annoying to don't have the filter operator. \n. As we discussed, I'm ok for a different package name, like com.tbruyelle.rxpermissions2 and so support both versions in parallel.\nI understand your request to distribute your work on one of your repository, and if you really want to do so that's ok. But I'm not sure the community will gain from that. There will be 2 different repositories for the same project, it will be confusing. As you like.\n. Wow you're quick, thanks!\n2.x branch is ready.\n. @gengjiawen That's right, I don't understand why, the files are here... https://dl.bintray.com/tbruyelle/tbruyelle/com/tbruyelle/rxpermissions2/rxpermissions/0.7.1/\n. Maybe it's because it's a different package ...\n. Strange, I asked to bintray to understand, I'm waiting for their response.\n. My config is OK since I managed to upload the legacy version at the same time.\nhttps://jcenter.bintray.com/com/tbruyelle/rxpermissions/rxpermissions/0.7.1/rxpermissions-0.7.1.pom\n. Got my answer from bintray, I have to create an other package and ask for jcenter link. Stay tuned\n. @gengjiawen Request approved by bintray, please retry (I can't be myself for the moment)\n. Fixed now with version 0.8.1 \n. Could you post more code plz ? The problem you have goes against the basic behavior of the library so I suspect there's something wrong in your code. \n. I don't see any RxPermissions code in your gist.\n. Your code in CommonUtils about RxPermissions is completely wrong, you need to learn more about asynchronous programming and how RxJava works.\nLook at the code in the sample app and follow it.\nI close the issue because it's not related to RxPermissions.\n. And good luck :)\n. I redirected you to the sample app, do the same and it will work.\nSorry I don't have the time to explain.\n. I think Nougat is not enough to enable Java 8 features, Jack compiler must also enabled as well.\n. Good catch\n. But undoable since the transformers are parametized.\n. Thanks but you need to fix and update the tests.\n. The feature has been suggested and approved in #68  :)\n. From https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting.html\n\nTo help find situations where the user might need an explanation, Android provides a utiltity method, shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale(). This method returns true if the app has requested this permission previously and the user denied the request.\nNote: If the user turned down the permission request in the past and chose the Don't ask again option in the permission request system dialog, this method returns false. The method also returns false if a device policy prohibits the app from having that permission.\n\nSo in your case, the first time the user denied the request, the method should return true. Unless you have a device policy which prohibits the app from having the camera permission, or unless there's something wrong in your implementation (but didn't find what).\nOther thing, I think you should check if permission is granted first, because in that case it's possible that shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale returns false.\n. That's weird because that's not what the documentation say...\n\nThis method returns true if the app has requested this permission previously and the user denied the request.\n\nMoreover on my app I get the expected result by invoking that method after I request the persmissions (I use RxPermissions.shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale())\n. The behavior you described for after the permission sounds correct to me, and fit the documention. Is it what you experienced with your case ?\n. By doing it before we break what most users will expect from that value.\n@vanniktech So you want to know when the user has clicked on \"Never ask again\", that's simple, the code below should work with the after way : \njava\n.subscribe(permission -> {\n    if (permission.granted)  {\n      // All good\n    } else if (permission.shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale)\n      // Denied permission without ask never again\n    } else {\n      // Denied permission with ask never again      \n      // Need to go to the settings\n    }\n  });\nThat's currently what I do in my app and it works like a charm.\n. @tarasantoshchuk \n\nalso we should rename Permission#shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale to something like Permission#deniedForever. This way the meaning of the field will be obvious for user.\n\nI disagree, by keeping the name we don't have to maintain an extra documentation. Users should know about shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale.\n. @vanniktech \n\nIf you just pressed the deny button and checked \"don't ask again\" I don't want to navigate the user into the settings. However if the user comes back and then presses that button and the Android Dialog can't be shown anymore since the user pressed \"don't ask again\" then I need to navigate the user into the settings.\n\nWhy having a separate behavior between the first time the user denied with \"don't ask again\" and the second time ?\nBoth time you should display a snackbar or something like that, telling him he has to go to the settings if he finally changed his mind, with a button that brings him to the settings.\n. > Maybe both values should be taken into permission. The value before asking the permission and the value after the user did that.\nNope I don't want that. The expected behavior according to the android documentation is to invoke shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale after a request, not before. Moreover this will be horrible with variable name like *before and *after.\nYou'll have to add extra code in your app to handle your case.\n. I read your sample code again, and even with the before way, I'm not sure this will fit your need because shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale can return false in 3 cases : \n- user clicks on never ask again\n- permission has never been asked\n- permission is already granted\n``` java\nrxPermissions.requestEach(Manifest.permission.CAMERA)\n  .first()\n  .toSingle()\n  .subscribe(permission -> {\n    if (!permission.shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale) {\n      // Need to go to the settings\n      // Or the permission has never been asked\n      // Or the permission is already granted\n    } else if (permission.granted) {\n      // All good\n    } else {\n      // Denied permission\n    }\n  });\n})\n``\n. I merged your PR but moved theshouldShowRequestPermissionRationaleinvocation after therequestPermissions`. Thanks for the contribution.\n. I don't understand why there's an infinite loop, but I see something wrong in your code. \nIn the first flatMap you shouldn't return null but Observable.empty(). But actually you don't even need the switchEmpty operator, just return locationUpdatesObservable instead of null in the first flatMap.\n. java\n.filter(granted -> granted)\n. In case of deny, the chain stops at the filter. There's probably something else in your code that requests the permission again and again.\n. Closed for no activity\n. Please remove .DS_store file\n. > Anything that is stopping this?\nNo, I wanted to find the time to review with a minimal knowledge of rxJava2, but I'm very busy for the moment. Let's merge it and see what's coming.\n. I knew I missed something, the package name didn't change. It should be com.tbruyelle.rxpermissions2 \n. I fixed that in master and 2.x branches.\n. Possible duplicate of #46\n. #46  is now fixed, please try again with version 0.8.0\n. There is RxPermissions.isGranted method that calls internallyContextCompat.checkSelfPermission but it doesn't return an Observable, so you have to do it yourself.\njava\nObservable.just(RxPermissions.isGranted(...))\n. Ok I see. What's the benefit of such feature ? \n. I don't see how the permission could be revoked at runtime. When you revoke a permission for an app in the settings, the app is killed by the framework.\n. By design, the process of permission request is hard-linked to the Activity (sadly like too much things in the Android framework). \nWhat you could try is sharing a subject between your activity and your data layer, observe that subject in the data layer and feed it in the activity when a permission is granted. Not sure if it's possible that said, I don't know your achitecture.\n. And sharing a subject is probably over-engineering. \n. Well, I think we have to move forward about this issue, and this is probably the simplest way. Thanks for the contribution.\nI would like to have review from people involved in #46, @tarasantoshchuk ? @artesa ? @NitroXenon ? WDYT?\n. I think finally I'm going to accept @tarasantoshchuk's PR (#53) because it's more accurate. Sorry for the very long delay... I'll probably merge it on monday.\n. Please join a screenshot, I don't understand.\n. Should be fixed since we don't use an activity any more for requesting permission.. Because it would be cumbersome to start an activity just for that. I only need the activity as a parameter, I don't need to catch the activity result like request or ensure.\n. > 0.8.0 needs rxjava 1.x version, while 0.8.1 needs rxjava 2.x version.\nNot really. RxJava version is handled by the package name.\nfor RxJava 1.x use compile 'com.tbruyelle.rxpermissions:rxpermissions:0.8.0@aar'\nfor RxJava 2.x compile 'com.tbruyelle.rxpermissions2:rxpermissions:0.8.1@aar'\n. rxPermissions.request(Manifest.permission.CAMERA).subscribe() compiles. \n. > I guess I need to include the rxJava itself as a dependency?\nNo, that's not required, Gradle do it for you. Package changes between RxJava1 and RxJava2, that's probably why you get this error.\n. You can also have this kind of exception if you don't follow the library guidelines.\n. We can't emit an error precisely because we can't find the subject for the requested permission.\n. Your code seems to gather all conditions to trigger the biggest flaw of this library : configuration change handling. As you read in #3 there's no workaround, so we have the choice to follow the guidelines or to stop using RxPermissions.\n. Not relevant\n. Sounds cool. Can you explain what the benefit of using a retained fragment, and what are the rotating screen issues you fixed ?\n. Fine, I have to do some tests. \n. Sorry for the delay. \nI briefly started some tests and first of all I got a crash in the sample app, when I return to the sample app after tweaking the app permissions in the settings. RxPermissions.getInstance returned null so a NPE raised. \nIt seems there's a bug in the  newInstance detection.\nTo reproduce : \n- open the Sample app\n- Open the settings and go to applications>RxPermissions Sample>permissions and update the permissions\n- return to the Sample app -> crash\n. Ok since you moved the subjects list in the fragment, there's no need to have RxPermissions.onRequestPermissionResults(), everything can be done in the fragment if I'm right.\nI'm still testing.\n. Another issue, if you invoke requestEach directly in your activity onCreate, there's a crash because RxPermissionsFragment.getActivity() returns null. It seems the fragment is not yet attached to the activity at this time (aahh that's why I love fragment...)\nTo reproduce, change the sample app MainActivity like that : \n``` java\n@Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        final RxPermissions rxPermissions = RxPermissions.newInstance(this);\n        rxPermissions.setLogging(true);\n    setContentView(R.layout.act_main);\n    surfaceView = (SurfaceView) findViewById(R.id.surfaceView);\n\n            rxPermissions.requestEach(Manifest.permission.CAMERA)\n                    .subscribe(new Action1<Permission>() {\n                                   @Override\n                                   public void call(Permission permission) {\n                                       Log.i(TAG, \"Permission result \" + permission);\n                                       if (permission.granted) {\n                                           Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this,\n                                                   \"Camera permission granted\",\n                                                   Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();\n                                           releaseCamera();\n                                           camera = Camera.open(0);\n                                           try {\n                                               camera.setPreviewDisplay(surfaceView.getHolder());\n                                               camera.startPreview();\n                                           } catch (IOException e) {\n                                               Log.e(TAG, \"Error while trying to display the camera preview\", e);\n                                           }\n                                       } else if (permission.shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale) {\n                                           // Denied permission without ask never again\n                                           Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this,\n                                                   \"Denied permission without ask never again\",\n                                                   Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();\n                                       } else {\n                                           // Denied permission with ask never again\n                                           // Need to go to the settings\n                                           Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this,\n                                                   \"Permission denied, can't enable the camera\",\n                                                   Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();\n                                       }\n                                   }\n                               },\n                            new Action1<Throwable>() {\n                                @Override\n                                public void call(Throwable t) {\n                                    Log.e(TAG, \"onError\", t);  // <--- crash is reported here\n                                }\n                            },\n                            new Action0() {\n                                @Override\n                                public void call() {\n                                    Log.i(TAG, \"OnComplete\");\n                                }\n                            });\n\n}\n```\n. Np, the PR is promising, I hope it can remove the biggest drawback of the library : having to subscribe during the init phase.\n. Sure, for the moment I try to find the time to complete the tests, sry for\nthe delay.\nLe jeu. 10 nov. 2016 23:21, Eduardo Alejandro Pool Ak\u00e9 \nnotifications@github.com a \u00e9crit :\n\n@tbruyelle https://github.com/tbruyelle let me know if you need any\nchange for this PR please.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/tbruyelle/RxPermissions/pull/91#issuecomment-259824931,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAFoePlWgTPju5O_3IhVzurULi_PH1acks5q85jKgaJpZM4Km2OR\n.\n. I completed some tests about config change and it's ok. \nNow I'm worried about the breaking change you introduced by removing the hability to get the singleton instance of RxPermissions. Is it really necessary ?\n\nOther subject, the changes need to ported also in the 2.x branch, and that's a boring job.\n. > I can rollback the renaming from RxPermissions.newInstance(activity) to RxPermissions.getInstance(activity)\nThat would break the contract because as you said it's no more a singleton. I prefer to have a simple constructor rather than newInstance.\n\nRegarding 2.x I can create a new branch from 2.x, apply these changes on that branch and create another PR against 2.x branch.\n\nGreat, let's do this. Thanks in advance\n. Well I'm not sure, wdyt? \n. Ok let's merge it\n. Ready in version 0.9.0 (not 0.8.3 because of the breaking change)\n. And thanks for the awesome work!\n. > Permission is banned in android 5.1\nWhat do you mean  ?\n. Closed  no feedback from op. You can use requestEach which emits similar results but returns an observable rather than a transformer. See the readme just before the Important read section.\n. It seems to be something linked to your fragment usage, not RxPermissions.\n. Closed no feedback from op. I updated to 1.2.2 and so far so good c8e57f063785202d033f4ae47e833bfcc4c80a84\n. I've just uploaded version 0.8.2 with rxJava 1.2.2 dependency if you want to check\n. Thanks for the PR but the problem is now probably fixed in version 0.9.0, where we don't use activities any more. Could you check ?\n. Well sorry but as requestPermissions() is a method attached to an Activity (and not a Context) I don't feel bad about requiring an Activity for the constructor argument.\n. Closed no response from op. Thx @epool. I'll fix the README.. You have the problem only when debugging?. When you request the permission, onPause is executed in your activity, do you execute specific code in there?. Ok, @epool do you think it could come from the fragment ?\n@ersin-ertan Can you check if you have a similar behavior with version 0.8.2 please ? You'll have to change new RxPermissions(this) with RxPermissions.getInstance(this).. Fine, so problem solved ?. > I wouldn't think so, but I'm not sure what you as a library developer could do to prevent this problem.\nYes, that's what I mean by 'problem solved'\n\nHaving the noHistory option is important for some apps, would you know of any possible solutions?\n\nNo idea but I found this on stack : \nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/35151233/requesting-android-m-permissions-from-activity-with-nohistory-true-and-or-show?rq=1. \"Always ask\" ?

It is lightweight, it requires no declaration in manifest, it fixes a small ui bug.  What's your opinion about that ?. That said @epool, is it possible for you to apply the change in the 2.x please ?. No need to be sorry, thanks!. You're not the first and I'm sorry.\nThat said I don't understand why you perform something that can lead to an UI interaction in a Service.. > @vanniktech @epool You should almost always be using the support library Fragments\n\nIn theory that makes sense but having the support library as a dependency in a library project can be a PITA for some users.. > Well, basically I have an ongoing location sharing service. And if a user goes to the app's settings and disables the location permission, I want the app to prompt the user to re-enable the location permission\nThanks I understand, but where does the request permission dialog appear when you request a permission from a Service ? I mean, if you are in an different app, the dialog appears in front of it ?. Well I'm pretty sure it's not something that Google would approve XD.. IMAO the best way is to pop a notification indicating the permission change, the notif click launches an activity explaining why the permission is required and allow to request again.. @epool ping, did you find the time to work on the 2.x branch ?. You have to use ensureEach, which provides more information. In particular it gives you the result of shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale.\nCheck the readme.. Gn\u00e9?. I'll add the missing tag. About the 2.x branch, @epool is working on it, thanks to him.. Cause I didn't switch to rxjava2 yet in my projects. The 2.x branch is not something I planned.. Well this bug is hard-boiled. We had it in the past and did ugly fixes to remove it. I really though it won't come back since we use a fragment and not an activity. But the Android framework is definitively not a good friend. \nI'll commit a fix to ignore the crash, because now I'm tired.. Fixed in version 0.9.1. Well the less ugly way would be to move that methods static...\nIs it very annoying to do it yourself ?\njava\nObservable.just( context.checkSelfPermission(p) == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED ) . Ok, I'll wait your PR to see.. Version 0.9.1 fixes that exception.. Great job thank you. \n(Ping @epool : job done ^^). There's no need of static method for that.. I'll fix the README. @epool Any idea ?. Closed because no response from op. Please provide the code, sry for the delay. Reopen the issue at the same time.. Since we use a fragment to request the permission, RxPermissions now needs an activity.\nIt may be a constraint, but an activity is also needed if you request the permission with the core methods.\nAbout your problem with Dagger, I suggest to create an other module in your activity, or to remove RxPermissions from injected dependencies, and create it manually.. Try rxPermissions.request(Manifest.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE). \nYou will receive a compiled result of user answers.\n. You can't merge 2.x and master branches. One is dedicated to Rxjava2 and the other to Rxjava1.. Why did you change the author ids ?\nWhat is the purpose of that PR?. Please create a clean PR with the only the changes you want. I close this one for now.. No you can't, shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale() is an Activity method.. Thanks a lot for this change and for the explanations :). 0.9.3 has been upload for master and 2.x branch.. Dup of #142 . Yes it makes sense, I thought about that too but it would introduce a breaking change without real benefit (Single class didn't exist when I started the library).. Ow I think there's a PR for that... #121 . You probably do something wrong with your fragment usage to have this exception, anyway, version 0.9.2 now perform commitAllowingStateLoss.. Just added the tag v0.9.3. About the change log I'm sorry for the moment I don't have the time to maintain it.. I dont think RxPermissions is currently not compatible with the Support lib.. I know that, but that doesn't mean the lib isn't compatible with the support lib.. So is there good reason to use the support library ?. No you can use it in a fragment.

Thank you for the replies, I close the issue. Sounds legit, please submit a PR and I'll merge it.. The lib is there https://bintray.com/tbruyelle/tbruyelle/RxPermissions2/0.9.3, maybe jcenter had connectivity issues during your attempt. Please try again and let me know.. Didn't understand what's your problem.. It's in the README, use requestEach/ensureEach to have a detailled object of what happened during the permission request.. This is the normal behavior. If the user has clicked \"never ask again\" and if the permission is critical for your app, you have to invite the user to go to the settings and to change manually the permissions of your app. There's no other alternatives.. Thanks for the PR, I will have time to review it at the end of the week. Stay tuned.. Ty!. 0.9.4 contains the PR. Fragments are really a plague !. Sorry I have no idea, community pushed me to use fragments for this lib (originally it was an Activity), and I finally accepted but I regret. I don't use fragment from ages, so sorry I can't help you.. This lib doesn't handle Xiaomi specific permission system.. Ty!. Didn't understand your first point.. I disagree. From the android doc : \nYou should do this only if you do not have the permission.\n\nhttps://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale(java.lang.String). > firstly , the \"isGranted\" is true , and then the phone show the permission dialog\nNo. The Action1 is only invoked when user has answered all permission dialog requests.. Why do you have a Samsung you're a developer isn't it ? xD. Yes that's strange, it's the first time someone raise me this kind of issue. I don't think it's the first time the library is used on a S7.\nThis only occurs the first time you request the permission ?. So it's when the dialog appears, maybe Samsung broke something in the lifecycle during this process.\nAre you sure you perform the request in an initialization phase ?. Do you request inside a click listener ? If yes it's not an initialization phase and you will have the same problem on any device if you rotate the screen while the permission dialog is shown.\nTry to follow the example in the README : \njava\n// Must be done during an initialization phase like onCreate\nRxView.clicks(findViewById(R.id.enableCamera))\n    .compose(rxPermissions.ensure(Manifest.permission.CAMERA))\n    .subscribe( ... ). @lopspower so did you fix the issue with my last comment ?. Gne. Please read the README and look at the sample project, you would find out.. Why?. Details?. It seems you use the wrong version, Flowable is part of rxjava-2. Use com.tbruyelle.rxpermissions2:rxpermissions. The API already provides the hability to pass multiple permissions in the arguments.\nAbout the Android O Permission changes : https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/android-8.0-changes.html#rmp\nI don't think there's something to change in this library for that. WDYT ?. It's rxjava1 on master branch, and rxjava2 on 2.x branch.. I don't know is this required for APACHE2 license ?. @dsaff @nmulcahey thank you guys, I've just added it to the README.. No you can't. Dup of #142 . No, I don't want to add complex features like that.. This may be a bug that occurs only on some manufacturer OS. Sorry I can't do anything for that.. Speak english please. Is it something new ? Can you link me the doc please ?. Ok there's nothing new, the lib already handles shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale.. > If needed, here's a class that has all the groups and their permissions:\nIs it a class from the framework ?. Well it should be !\nYou can create a PR on this if you want.. That would be nice, but this requires to maintain the list carefully, for instance when a new permission is added to the framework ?. OK fine.\n@StringDef is an android feature, why didn't they add this on their own permission definition, that's a shame.. The library won't handle it.. There's no such bug in the library.\nDont forget to declare the permissions in your manifest.\n. Thank you !\n. Thanks it's more clean\n. Well it was something I expected, because I totally neglect lifecycle handling... until now :)\nI will try to find a solution.\n. OK it will be hard to fix that problem properly. \nRxjava and activity/fragment lifecycle have been discussed a lot and as far as I know there is no clean solution. \nWe can easily prevent the crash by making RxPermissions a singleton, so after the rotation change and the user answers to the permission request, the corresponding subject is found. But when the lib emits the response, the observer is still linked to the old activity, so it has no effect to the current new activity.\nThe main problem here is we have rebind the subscription in the newly created activity, after the rotation change. This can be done manually by the user, he unsubscribes when the activity dies and resubscribe when the new activity pops. But I don't like that since it adds too much code for the user.\nIf someone has a good idea, it would be pleasure to hear.\n. Wow thank you all for taking your time to give help.\nAbout making RxPermissions survives the activity lifecycle, a simple singleton seems good enough (I tested that in a branch).\nAs @dlew and I said, the main problem is really to rebind the subscription after the death/rebirth of the activity, and I'm more and more convinced this is not possible easily. The main goal of this library is to keep things simple and to provide Observables. So I start to think about trade-offs.\nWhen you request a permission, the framework starts a activity called .permission.ui.GrantPermissionsActivity (I saw that in logcat), this activity shows a dialog and survives the rotation change. But if it doesn't survive, there is no more issue ! The user will have to re-trigger the permission request, but I don't think this is really embarrassing.\nSo the question is, can I alter that activity's lifecycle, or maybe more plausible ask it to kill itself when I detect the rotation change ?\nWDYT ? \n. Just release a new version 0.2.0 : \n- RxPermissions is now a singleton gettable with getInstance(Context). This fix the crash.\n- Add an internal activity to handle the onRequestPermissionsResult so it's no more needed to override this method in the user acitivity.\nThat said, the problem about detached subscriber on rotation change is still there.\n. @domsu Yeah this is something to which I already thought, and this is easy to implement with RxJava. We just add a doOnSubscribe(lock) and a doOnTerminate/doOnUnscubscibe(unlock) to the observable.\nBut it can be intrusive, maybe we could make it optional ? As you said it's not a good pattern, but if it shock anyone, I'm ready to implement it, as a recommended option. \n. @andaag Yep I agree. So 2 solutions, put the project to the trash or add hacky trade-offs...\nI prefer the solution 2 because for me the project brings more good than harm. \nit doesn't bother me to lock the rotation during the permission request. And if for some rooted devices it's not possible to lock the rotation, the users will have to request the permission twice, this doesn't matter.\nFor other configuration changes, like language change, same thing. I mean, it's not very common that a user changes the language while an app is requesting a permission.\nBy explicitly warning the library's users of these trade-offs, I think we can move forward.\n. @dlew Actually with the shadow activity introduced in version 0.2.0, we have such tool ! Nice. \nAbout 3, I have no control on the runtime permission request (other than create a new one), I can't cancel or resume it. The permission request is resumed automatically after a configuration change. \nAnyway, a solution begins to take shape :\n\na permission request is triggered : RxPermissions registers a subject associated with that permission and requests the framework : the runtime permission popup appears.\na configuration change occurs : RxPermissions unsubscribes all registered subjects, but keeps in memory the pending requests. It will survive the configuration change because it's a singleton since 0.2.0.\n   The runtime permissions popup is paused and will be resumed automatically.\nthe app restarts : The permission request is redone by the app (this is actually the only requirement, but as @dlew said it's a logical outcome), RxPermissions remembers a pending request has been done for this permission, and registers a new subject for it, but doesn't request the framework a second time (otherwise the result would be another runtime permissions popup).\n   The runtime permissions popup is resumed and displayed again.\nuser answers to the permission request : RxPermissions.onRequestPermissionsResult is invoked, the lib finds the corresponding subject and emits the user response. \n\nThat sounds not bad...\n. Interesting, but I'm not sure to understand how things are connected together.\n. Nice, please link the library when it's ready. \nAbout the name, sorry I have no idea.\n. I pushed a PR #14 that aims to fix the issue. I would appreciate if some of you review it.\nThe fix removes some flexibility to the lib but I didn't find anything better.\nThe good news is for clients who request the permission during activity/fragment/view start, nothing change, it will  work as these.\nFor client who request the permission after a particular event, there is some breaking changes :\n- Firstly, they need to move the request call in one of the activity/fragment/view start method.\n- Secondly, they need to add an extra parameter to the request or requestEach method : an Observable that represents that particular event. See the PR for details.\nExample from the sample app, the click event is transformed to an observable with RxBinding :\n``` java\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.act_main);\n\n     // com.jakewharton.rxbinding.view.RxView is perfect to represent the event needed\n    Observable<Object> trigger = RxView.clicks(findViewById(R.id.enableCamera));\n\n     RxPermissions.getInstance(this)\n            .request(trigger, Manifest.permission.CAMERA)\n            .subscribe(granted -> {\n\n```\n. @andaag Thanks for the help but I think I found a solution which bring less changes on the client side.\n. > For just glancing at the code, I'm guessing your using the permission itself as an identifier for the request? That means you can only request a permission from one place in the app. If you want the camera permission in 3 different places your gonna need another identifier.\nI think it should work. From the beginning the lib has been designed with concurrent access in focus. For instance, if there's 3 camera permission requests from 3 different places, the same observable is returned to the subscribers. So when the user's answer is caught, all subscribers will receive it. \nThat said, if the requests are done very simultaneously, it won't work as expected since I forgot to use synchronized... That's another small improvement.\n. I uploaded a snapshot version\ngradle\ncompile 'com.tbruyelle.rxpermissions:rxpermissions:0.4.0@aar'\n. @andaag I tested a little more and it works also if you make the permission request in View.onFinishInflate or any methods invoked during the app initialization.\nSo you're not limited to onCreate/onResume.\n. > you never remove anything from mSubjects it'll leak.\nWhen the lib receives the permission request answer, the subject receives onComplete which unsubscribe all subscribers, and is removed from the list.\nhttps://github.com/tbruyelle/RxPermissions/blob/lifecycle-handling/lib/src/main/java/com/tbruyelle/rxpermissions/RxPermissions.java#L274\n. Yes you're right, I probably should make RxPermissions.onDestroy() public, to unsubscribe all subjects.\n. @andaag Thanks for the report, I noticed that bug last friday. The issue is due to the take(1) which prevents the trigger observable to emit more than one item. I removed it here 2455bcf21d5ac9adc82e6f89786d6de2a085b89c but now I have to fix the request method which doesn't work any more. \nIndeed, take(1) was here to ensure the sequence was completed, this is mandatory because request use toList() to transform the original sequence to a single boolean (toList() requires completed sequence or else it emits nothing).\nI have an idea of the final fix, I'll publish it today.\n. So version 0.4.1 brings some other fixes, including the one mentioned by @andaag \ngradle\ncompile 'com.tbruyelle.rxpermissions:rxpermissions:0.4.1@aar'\nI think I'll soon merge the PR #14 \n. Good point. \nDo you know if there's relation between PackageManager.checkPermission and Context.checkSelfPermission() ?\nMy first attempt to fix thgis issue is to check PackageManager.checkPermission only pre-M but I have a doubt, maybe I should check it for all versions ?\n. @ffgiraldez Yes I saw that but I didn't use it to prevent an external dependency and also because I thought it's easy to implement.\nBut I wasn't aware of the PackageManager.checkPermission thing. I would like to see the source of ContextCompat.checkSelfPermissions() but it seems it's not released yet (https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_support/blob/master/v4/java/android/support/v4/content/ContextCompat.java)\n. ContextCompat.checkSelfPermissions() is now visible, but there is no call to PackageManage.checkPermission().\n. Closed because no idea of what to do here\n. It depends on the usage. Most of the time I think people only want to know if the user has granted all the requested permissions. So a simple boolean is enough.\nThat said, your proposal is good. What if we add another method to the API, let's say requestDetailed() which returns an Observable<Map<String,Boolean>>  ?\n. I'm not sure about the map thing. Are you saying the method should return Observable<HashMap<String, Boolean>> rather than Observable<Map<String, Boolean>> ?\n. Yep agree with @alorma. \nUntil now I never heard of that kind of rule. And in this library's context, I don't see any benefit for the consumer to explicitly know the concrete type of the Map.\n. Not silly at all, but interesting. This is absolutely feasible with RxJava.\nIf I'm right,  permission.shouldRequestAgain() is related to shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale. I started a basic support for this method in #8, but implemented it differently. I chose to create a independent method so you can mix the observables, like here.\nwhat is the way you prefer ?\n. Yes there is less code in theory but what do you do mostly if shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale returns true ? \nYou show the user an explanation with a dialog and once he agrees, request the permission a second time. That's why I did it like that. \nThat said, I'm not 100% sure this is the best way.\n. I just create that PR, please tell me if this fits your needs. \nPlease comment on the PR.\n. Released in version 0.3.0\n. Thank you for your time, I started a similar feature in a branch, and actually it doesn't solve the problem.\nTake the sample app, remove previously granted permission, run it and click on the button. Then if you rotate the device while the permission popup is displayed, and grant or deny the permission, nothing will happen. This is because the function attached to the Observable is linked to the destroyed activity, and it has no effect to the new one.\nThe main problem is really to rebind that function from the destroyed activity to the new one. And I'm not even sure it's possible.\nThat said, I like the invisible/shadow activity idea, so I'll probably use your PR later, and merge it with my branch.\n. > I think that this library should not be concerned with managing the observable for the consume\nYeah you're probably right, but I'm disappointed because this will complicate a lot the usage of the library.\n. Implemented in ef4aed66a57c52f06b9679c2acac376a7d62c433\nThanks anyway\n. Thanks\n. Good point\n. I created a PR with a basic support, wdyt ? \nPlease comment on the PR.\n. Released in version 0.3.0\n. Yes we need to fix #3 to have a stable release.\n. The screen rotation is only the visible part of the iceberg, we need to handle every configuration changes.\nSo no, locking the rotation change in your app is not enough.\nHowever, since 0.2.0, there is no more crash, but the onNext's code you registered before the configuration change will never be executed.\n. Thanks for the compliment ^^ \nI hope we will find a proper solution.\n. Well I'm not sure to see the benefit also. \nPlus I hate fragments.\n. (@digitalbuddha That's also what I did with my job's app. Now I use only activities and views, and I feel better. No more weird exceptions and other horrible things.)\n. Good point @andretietz, and I've just noticed that Fragment have also a onRequestPermissionResult method. So it seems feasible, and would probably has a smaller footprint than the activity.\n. I'm working on #3 currently, so feel free to send a PR if you can. That would be nice, thanks in advance.\n. @richarddd thanks for that\n. Closed for no activity\n. This is code generated by Android Studio, I hope it's correct :D\n. The goal of RxPermissions is not to handle onActivityResult. Maybe you could create an other library for that.\n. ok, first you don't need to check the sdk version, it's handled by the library. If Build.VERSION.SDK_INT < 23, the observer will immediately receive a granted result.\nSecondly, it seems you're not well informed about runtime permissions. Only a  part of the permissions requires a request : the dangerous ones, as Google names them [1]. \nAbout the crash itself, I think it's exactly because you request permissions that don't need to be requested. Try to filter the parameter list with only dangerous permissions and it should work.\nThat said you pointed a weakness in the library that needs a fix. Thanks !\n[1] https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/security/permissions.html#normal-dangerous\n. After some tests, there is finally no issue in requesting non-dangerous permissions, but the framework will always answer the permission is not granted. The answer is propagated without change by the library.\nCould you tell me if you still have the issue with the last version of RxPermissions ?\n. Closed for no activity\n. No, the minSdkVersion to use this library is 9\nI will add that in the README.\n. What do you want me to check ? mCtx.checkSelfPermission(permission) is not even a call to this library.\n. I know I use it.\nThe method hasPermission_ is only called if current sdk is >=23.\n. > if targetSdk is not 23, permissions dialog is always not showing .\nFair enough since runtime permissions are only available for target 23.\n. Thanks!\n. As you can see, this method is not public. It's invoked internally by the ShadowActivity.\nI document only the public API.\n. Interesting. The documentation I found [1] on @RequiresPermission doesn't tell how it works, so I can't figure out how to handle that.\nI'll try to look further.\n[1] http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/support-annotations\n. No sorry, I didn't.\n. Thanks for the report. \nI also read that post, and unlike ActivityCompat, RxPermissions doesn't delegate the permission request to PackageManager but returns true immediatly. So this issue is already handled.\n. No problem\n. Because I'm lazy. Maven central needs more than just an aar.\n. That would be nice\nLe lun. 23 nov. 2015 18:28, Saad Farooq notifications@github.com a \u00e9crit :\n\nGot it... will try to put up a PR when I get the time\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/tbruyelle/RxPermissions/issues/21#issuecomment-159003300\n.\n. Thanks @eleventigers \n\n@martyglaubitz if you're OK with the implementation, please close the issue.\n. I discover this method, it sounds very similar to shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale().\nI don't know if it should be implemented in the library, the only benefit in that case would be to handle the sdk version.\n. Fixed in 0.5.0\n. Very clean PR thanks !\n. Is there a reason why you used variadic parameters in isRevoled ? (other than replicating isGranted's signature)\nI'm asking you that because in the current code state there's no good reason to use variadic parameters for both isResolved and isGranted. I would like to change that and use a standard parameter, a permission.\n. I will :)\n. 0.5.0 deployed with your PR and without variadic param.\n. 1. It prevents to leak an Activity if the user passes that kind of class in the method invocation.\n2. What do you mean ?\n3. Not planned, I'm not sure of what benefits can bring a Kotlin version of the library.\n4. What are you talking about ? Please detail.\n. 1. I know RxLifecycle, but I don't see the benefits of an integration with RxPermissions.\n2. Support lib hides the result of version check, whereas I need the information to feed the Observables. The lib manipulates Observables, Support lib doesn't. \n. Could you make an unique PR with the version upgrade and the fix on subjects ?\nYou can push that commit into your branch rxjava110 and close #26. That should be ok.\nThanks in advance\n. No need to squash thx\n. Of course, but you have to do it yourself.\n. No I don't want to add this kind of feature in the library. I don't want UI dependency.\n. If I need to show an explanation before ask permissions, I would show a dialog with the explanation and trigger the permission request on dialog dismiss.\n. Already fixed in #24, but I need to release it. I will do it asap,\n. 0.5.1 released, it should fix your problem.\n. If you use Android Studio, type new Ctrl+Space and it will suggest the correct class to implement.\n. Ok I removed retro lambda usage from the sample app.\n. Done\n. Well, I also use the library to request multiple times a critical permission, but I don't have the problem you describe. That said I'm not using those damned fragments.\nRather than removing the onDestroy content, could you try to wipe the subject list at the end of RxPermissions.onDestroy() :\ndiff\n void onDestroy() {\n        log(\"onDestroy\");\n        // Invoke onCompleted on all registered subjects.\n        // This should un-subscribe the observers.\n        for (Subject subject : mSubjects.values()) {\n            subject.onCompleted();\n        }\n+      mSubjects.clear();\n    }\nTell me if it fixes your issue.\n. Oh I think I get it this time. So as you explained there's no reason why an activity started with FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK propagate a onDestroy event to a singleton like the RxPermissions class.\nI think we can safely remove the ShadowActivity.onDestroy method.\nCould you check if it's OK for you and then open a PR ? I will try to release it quickly.\n. Sorry I'm going to reverse that change because it breaks configuration change handling.\nWhen you request a permission, you see the permission dialog, if before answer you rotate your phone, your app is restarted and the permission dialog pops again automatically (it's not because of RxPermissions). If you answer at this time, the rx chaining should be invoked properly, but not any more since that change.\n. Please keep RxPermissions.onDestroy() it can be usefull to invoke it manually.\nEnsure also the tests are passing.\nThanks in advance\n. Ok version 0.5.2 has been deployed to bintray with your fix. Thanks for the contribution!\n. Thanks for that, but I didn't manage to upload an artifact.\nFirst I fixed the package name (see 08b227cea808ca9fcf6d8b3e499c8488c6337c87)\nI filled my bintray user and api key, generated the pom and jar with the install task (maybe there's a task which do not copy the files in ~/.m2 ?), and tried to upload with bintrayUpload task. It returns me success but then I can't find the artifact in jcenter.\nIf I rerun bintrayUpload I got an error telling me the artifact already exists.\n``` sh\n* What went wrong:\nExecution failed for task ':rxpermissions:bintrayUpload'.\n\nCould not upload to 'https://api.bintray.com/content/tbruyelle/tbruyelle/RxPermissions/0.5.2/com/tbruyelle/rxpermissions/rxpermissions/0.5.2/rxpermissions-0.5.2.aar': HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict [message:Unable to upload files: An artifact with the path 'com/tbruyelle/rxpermissions/rxpermissions/0.5.2/rxpermissions-0.5.2.aar' already exists]\n```\n. > The first time (and that's the step missing), you have to link your repo with jcenter, here in linked to, add to jcenter.

Well sorry I'm still stuck because there's no pom/jar generated with thebintrayUpload` task.\nCan you test again with the jcenter branch of that repo ?\n. Thank you for you time, I finally find the problem I have on my machine it's because my gradle.properties has the following feature enabled : org.gradle.configureondemande. If I disable it the pom and jars are correctly generated. Don't ask me why I enabled this feature, I can't remember !!\nSo I managed to upload the artifact to bintray and I asked a link to jcenter. Wait and see ^^\n. Ok so my repo is still not linked, this is probably because only version 0.5.2 has the requirements for jcenter linkability (pom and jar stuff).\nI can't delete old versions because other people may use them, so I have 2 options\n- manually add bintrayUplload functionnality to each tags (should take some time...)\n- create an other repo with only version 0.5.2 (but I'll loose all my repo stats and at next version some users will complain about missing artfiact because they have kept the original repo).\nShort, this is annoying... Maybe you have better idea ?\n. > I can generate the source jars for the other versions and send them to you (should be apply those commits after the tags of each version and generate).\nYou're nice, but that's fine thank you. I will do it if necessary. I'll wait tomorrow.\n. It's me who thank you for the contribution, I merged the jcenter branch so this PR can be closed.\n. Well that's weird, you get that error because the code is executed on a pre-6 version of Android. This isn't supposed to happen, in RxPermissions the version is checked before invoking that method.\nYou're not trying to start the ShadowActivity manually don't you ?\n. That shouldn't happen, do you see this error frequently in your crashlytics?\n. Closed for no response from submitter \n. Use last version please.\n. I'm not sure your way works when a configuration change occurs.\nCan you test that : \nAsk for a permission not granted yet with your method, see the permission dialog appear, don't answer but rotate your device to trigger a config change, then answer to the permission dialog. If ok your answer should be take into account. If nothing happen, then it means your way doesn't work.\n. Wow thanks dude I'm pleasantly surprised. I was aware of the compose method, I use it for life-cycle handling, but I didn't know it could be useful in that case.\nThat's a lot better than that ugly method signature request(trigger, permissions).\nI will integrate that in the framework.\n. That's a little crazy but you gave me the idea to deprecate all current methods and expose only 2 new methods : \n``` java\n public static Observable.Transformer ensure(final Context ctx, final String... permissions) {\n        return new Observable.Transformer() {\n            @Override\n            public Observable call(Observable o) {\n                return RxPermissions.getInstance(ctx).request(o, permissions);\n            }\n        };\n    }\npublic static Observable.Transformer<Object, Permission> ensureEach(final Context ctx, final String... permissions) {\n    return new Observable.Transformer<Object, Permission>() {\n        @Override\n        public Observable<Permission> call(Observable<Object> o) {\n            return RxPermissions.getInstance(ctx).requestEach(o, permissions);\n        }\n    };\n}\n\n```\nFor permissions request that requires immediately trigger (without a button), users would have to do something like : \njava\nObservable.just(null) // Too bad there's no something like Observable.always()\n     .compose(RxPermissions.ensure(this, perms))\n    .subscribe( granted -> {\n});\nThe major benefit of that refactoring is it forces the user to use the library correctly. Indeed currently it's possible to write the following code : \njava\nbtn.setOnClickListener(v -> RxPermissions.getInstance(this).request(perm).subscribe( { ... ] )\nBut that code doesn't handle configuration change during permission request. So by exposing only composable methods, I make this impossible. What do you think ?\nI still have other checks to do but this sounds very promising.\n. > permissions are requested usually just before they're needed\nunless they're critical permissions https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZqDdvhTZj0\n. Fixed with #38 \n. I agree with you, I integrated your changes in a new branch where I'm trying to refactor/simplify the lib usage. Thanks for the contrib\n. Merged with #38\n. I understand your point but the major benefit of that refactoring is it forces the user to use the library correctly. Indeed currently it's possible to write the following code : \njava\nbtn.setOnClickListener(v -> RxPermissions.getInstance(this).request(perm).subscribe( { ... ] )\nBut that code is wrong, it doesn't handle configuration change during permission request. So by exposing only composable methods, I make this impossible. \n. Yes it's not impossible but in that case I think the user really looks for problems !\nI agree oservable.just(null).compose(...) is ugly, as a replacement we can provide an observable method like you suggested it but I want to make sure there's no possible mistake  in its usage. I don't like very much requestWithoutTrigger(), I still prefer request. \n. @patloew So I undeleted request and requestEach methods, but only the version without trigger. Sounds fine to you ?\n. Do you see it ? The theme used for this activity is already transparent\n. I never noticed that problem, and I tested also on N5.\nAre you sure it's not something due to the moment you request the permission ? I would like to have some details of your usage.\n. Well not sure if it's related to your ptoblem but you shouldn't condition the permission request with savedInstanceState == null. In case of configuration change, the lib won't work properly.\nDo you use the last version 0.6.1 ?\n. Did you move the call ouside the if (savedInstanceState == null) ?\n. This is already the case, I don't understand why you need to override it. Moreover Fullscreen is not necessary.\nhttps://github.com/tbruyelle/RxPermissions/blob/master/lib/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L11\nAnyway it works for you, fine.\n. Interesting, I missed that test. I'll look into it.\n. With \"do not keep activities\" enabled, it works with a standard config change (screen rotate for instance) but not with the steps you described.\nSo a config change doesn't kill your activity like the home button followed by back from recent app, that's frustrating. The proof is ShadowActivity.onDestroy isn't invoked from the framework in that second case. Without that call, RxPermissions isn't able to remind previous permission requests, causing the issue you created.\nDo you know why in that case the android lifecycle is ignored ?\n. Ok I'll move it to onStop() probably.\n. Released in version 0.6.1, thanks for the report.\n. I'm not sure this is relevant to request FINE and COARSE permissions at the same time. \nMoreover I don't see the true benefit of your change. I think this is trivial enough to ask multiple permissions without showing it in the sample app.\n. I fixed the issue, can you check if it's ok with the HEAD version ?\n. Awesome thanks !\n. The crash was introduced with 88d83bb3c07f3bd1aaa6852ce37427c9928d9860 where I moved code from onDestroy to onStop.\nQuick solution is to move the client code in onStart rather than onCreate but I dislike the idea. Too bad we can't rely on onDestroy, since this is the only method in the lifecycle where it is certain that onCreate will be invoked on back. With onStop, it can be onCreate or onStart, it depends... Android lifecycle is really a fucking disaster, so tired of fighting against it for years...\nI try to find an other fix.\n. Yes it's important for a feature that begin to annoy me : multiple request handling. \nBut I'm going to take my axe, remove that feature and at the same time some complicated code. I don't think people uses it. Even me I'm not using it any more.\n. I'm not talking about multiple requests when you provide 2 or more parameters, I'm talking about multiple requests done at the same time for the same permission in 2 different places of your code. \nSo, do you really use that feature ?\n. > I can hardly imagine a case when it could be inevitably needed\nI agree, I was probably drunk when I decided to handle that.\nI pushed a fix to master, could you check if it's ok (also if possible the last test you made about multiple permissions request ?) \nThanks in advance!\n. Good!\nAbout the last issue, I tried to reproduce with sample app, by adding a second permission to the parameter list, with DNKA on, but it worked mostly as expected (mostly because the result was delivered 2 times instead of one to the subscriber, will see if I can improve that).\nWhen you said requested simultaneously you mean by passing more than one parameter ?\n. Done, new version is 0.7.0 since a feature has been removed.\n. No of course it's not by design ^^, it's a bug, probably duplicate with #42.\n. Deployed a new version 0.7.0 that should fix that. Please check.\n. Can you post more code ? I need to understand where and when the library is invoked.\n. Why do you need a second call for the same permission ?\n. I think you should request the permission only one time.\n. Yes but it may be not possible since RxPermission had to deal first with configuration changes. \n. > If I want to deny this permission again\nIts up to the user to grant or deny, you have no control on that.\n. Good question, I presume no but I didn't test with proguard. Could you check that ?\n. It seems the rules are not specific to rx-permissions but more to rx-java, in that case I don't think I should document them. Users simply refer to the rx-java documentation for that purpose.\n. You're probably right, but I didn't find official documentation about proguard rules in the rx-java project. Did you ?\n. Do you answer to the permission dialog on 1. ?\n. Ok there's probably a bug but the case you described is kindy weird... Why the user would go to the settings before answering the permission dialog ?\n. Can you provide a detailled stack trace please?\n. Ok I think I understand. \nWhen you update the app's permissions in the settings, your app is killed, and in that case RxPermissions doesn't save the current state, but the framework save the permission request and so restore it when the user is back.\nRxPermissions should probably save the state when the app is killed, and restore it after. If you have some time to develop a fix, I could merge it. I don't have the time for the moment sorry.\n. @AAverin Note that the bug affects only devices with sdk >= 23\n. @AAverin Agree I want to resolve it but until now nobody found an acceptable fix.\n. Fixed in 0.8.0\n. Your fix prevents the crash but the user response is not propagated to the subscriber, so there's still a problem.\nMoreover it breaks the lifecycle handling. If the user rotates the screen during a permission request, and then answers to the dialog, his reponse is also not propagated to the subscriber, because of your cancel.\n. Can you explain a little bit the steps to reproduce ?\n. Thanks, sorry for the delay I will probably check that on next week.\n. I don't see the ShadowActivity in the recent apps, how do you see it ?\n. Ok so you're talking about your app activity. In that case can you reproduce the case with the sample app ?\n. The library doesn't provide any UI stuff. Its up to you to code your own dialog, toast, snackbar...\n. RxPermissions.shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale doesn't need ShadowActivity because no activity results are delivered. \nAbout documentation, you're right the existence of the method should be mentionned in the README. About how to use it, it simply wraps Activity.shouldShowRequestPermissionRationnale in an observable so I invite you to read the documentation of the android framework.\nHTH\n. When the permission request is triggered by an action menu, you're right it's not trivial to implement it during an initialization phase.\nAlthough it's not ideal, I suggest to use a subject to register the permission request during the initialization phase of the activity, and then emit an arbitrary item in that subject in the menu click listener when you want to trigger the permission request.\nI can provide an example if necessary. Or if you find a better way to do that let me know.\n. Fine, that's also how I use it. \nI would like to provide a better way but it would require dependencies to menu listeners and things like that and so finally I prefer no.\n. Good question, I don't know. On my side I didn't reuse the subject. Not sure if it's good or bad...\n. I didn't understand \n. Close because no response\n. I use the library inside a project monitored with leakcanary and no leak\nwere detected.\nLe mer. 25 mai 2016 10:05, Binasphere notifications@github.com a \u00e9crit :\n\nI didn't see unsubscribe() be called in the sample.

Interesting fix thanks, I have to take time to test it, but I couldn't do that before next week. I'll let you know.\n. So I updated the sample app to test your fix (see branch fix46). I added an other permission to the requested list.\n\nThen : \n- Launch the sample\n- Click on Enable Camera\n- Allow the first permission\n- While the second permission is requested, go to the settings and deny the first\n- Back to the app, and allow the second permission. At this time without your fix, I agree the app crashes. With your fix there's no crash but there's also no emission of the response to the subscriber, as you mentionned it.\nSo sorry but I'm not going to merge that PR, I prefer a visible crash than a ghost partial fix.\n. @artesa So you're telling me that 202 users have this strange behavior of moving to the settings and revoking a permission during a permission request... That's really weird. I suspect it's something else.\n. I understand, but this PR only hides the crashes and doesn't solve the problem.\n. @NitroXenon I have 0 with 2k of active users daily.\n.

What I did in my app in that case is showing a single rationale for all requested permissions. It's simple but the caveat is you don't have the detail of which permissions has been revoked. So you can only display a message like \"some critical permissions have been revoked, please go to the settings and fix that\".\n\nHere is a sample code of the method which is passed to the subscribe of request. I used a snackbar for the user feedback : \n``` java\nprivate void onPermissionResult(Boolean granted) {\n        if (granted) {\n           // OK\n            return;\n        }\n        // Test whether the user clicked on \"never ask again\",\n        // adapt the action according to that.\n        RxPermissions.getInstance(this)\n                .shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale(this, CRITICAL_PERMISSIONS)\n                .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())\n                .subscribe(should -> {\n                    SnackBar.Builder snack = new SnackBar.Builder(this)\n                            .withMessageId(R.string.permission_required)\n                            .withDuration(SnackBar.PERMANENT_SNACK)\n                            .withStyle(SnackBar.Style.ALERT);\n                    if (should) {\n                        // \"never ask again\" not clicked, ask the user to retry the permission request.\n                        snack.withActionMessageId(R.string.reask)\n                                .withOnClickListener(token -> {\n                                            // Ask again for permissions                                        \n                                        }\n                                );\n                    } else {\n                        // \"never ask again\" clicked, ask the user to fix that in the app settings.\n                        snack\n                                .withActionMessageId(R.string.settings)\n                                .withOnClickListener(token -> {\n                                            // Open the app settings\n                                            AndroidUtils.startAppDetailsActivity(this);\n                                        }\n                                );\n                    }\n                    snack.show();\n                });\n}\n\n```\n. Please refer a context\n. Closed because no response\n. That's weird, how did you declare the permission in the manifest file ?\n. Closed because no response \n. ?\n. Thanks\n. > since ShadowActivity is public class (and not package-protected) some of library users might start ShadowActivity directly in their code\nThat's crazy\n\nMaybe we should make ShadowActivity package-protected?\n\nwhy not\n. Good job thank you\n. Thanks for the report and the analysis. \nSo the framework did not show the permission dialog again after a pause if the resume is done threw a deep link. RxPermissions should cancel any pending permission request in that case. Do you know how it can detect that ?\n. Sorry I have no idea\n. Because you can't mock static method with mockito, I suggest you to declare a method like that in your activity : \njava\npublic RxPermissions rxPermissions() {\n  return RxPermission.getInstance(this);\n}\nUse this method everywhere you need RxPermissions and then in your test you can simply mock like that : \njava\nRxPermissions rxPermissions = mock(RxPermissions.class);\nwhen(activity.rxPermissions()).thenReturn(rxPermissions);\nwhen(rxPermissions.request(anything()).thenReturn(Observable.just(true));\nHTH\n. Nice one, but that's a breaking change (I think Single didn't exist when the lib was created).\nI will keep that in my mind thanks. \n. The change will come with RxJava2 (see #71)\n. There's also RxPermissions.shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale() if you need to stay in the rx world.\n. I think that's a good idea.\nWe could add an extra field to the Permission object to handle that.\n. will be release in 0.8.0.\nYou now have a new field shoudlShowRequestPermissionRationale to the Permission object.\n. You don't need to get the instance of RxPermission during an init phase, it's required when you invoke methods from that instance.\n. That requirement is due to the permission request dialog, which is displayed by the framework when you call request/ensure and the permission is not granted or not denied permanently. If an activity recreation occurs when that dialog is displayed, then the dialog is restored but there's absolutely no way to get that information from the framework. \nThe only solution is so to invoke the request/ensure in a init phase, and in that case there's a little complex mechanism, which detects pending permission requests.\nThat requirement is clearly the ugliest thing in that library, and there is a long thread about that in #3, but despite the intervention of famous android developers, no better solution could be found.\n. I linked this issue in the readme.\n. Although your changes refer to good old java practices, I don't want to merge them because I think they do not promote code readability.\n. Yes I think that's definitevely something RxPermissions should support.\nI read some days ago the content of RxJava2 and it's a full rewrite, so I wonder how library like RxPermissions should publish new version that breaks everything. I don't want to change the package name or the artifactId. Maybe a jump to version 1.0 is enough to warn the user about the big changes ?\n. RxAndroid is part of the ReactiveX organisation so it sounds logic it adopted the same way.\nI don't think I can use the io.reactivex package, and I don't want to rename the package to something like org.tbruyelle because it doesn't mean anything. Changing artifact id to something like RxPermissions2 is much more meaningful but that's ugly.\n. Ok for changing the package name to com.tbruyelle.rxpermissions2, that's the best alternative I think. \nI'm curious to see how it will be handled in RxBinding.\n. Not me\n. I won't have the time to start that in the next weeks. \nI linked issue #65 about Single<Boolean> usage instead of Observable<Boolean>, I said this will come with rxJava2. But after some experiences I found something annoying with Single, they don't have filter operator. It's logic but for the permission request workflow, it can be annoying to don't have the filter operator. \n. As we discussed, I'm ok for a different package name, like com.tbruyelle.rxpermissions2 and so support both versions in parallel.\nI understand your request to distribute your work on one of your repository, and if you really want to do so that's ok. But I'm not sure the community will gain from that. There will be 2 different repositories for the same project, it will be confusing. As you like.\n. Wow you're quick, thanks!\n2.x branch is ready.\n. @gengjiawen That's right, I don't understand why, the files are here... https://dl.bintray.com/tbruyelle/tbruyelle/com/tbruyelle/rxpermissions2/rxpermissions/0.7.1/\n. Maybe it's because it's a different package ...\n. Strange, I asked to bintray to understand, I'm waiting for their response.\n. My config is OK since I managed to upload the legacy version at the same time.\nhttps://jcenter.bintray.com/com/tbruyelle/rxpermissions/rxpermissions/0.7.1/rxpermissions-0.7.1.pom\n. Got my answer from bintray, I have to create an other package and ask for jcenter link. Stay tuned\n. @gengjiawen Request approved by bintray, please retry (I can't be myself for the moment)\n. Fixed now with version 0.8.1 \n. Could you post more code plz ? The problem you have goes against the basic behavior of the library so I suspect there's something wrong in your code. \n. I don't see any RxPermissions code in your gist.\n. Your code in CommonUtils about RxPermissions is completely wrong, you need to learn more about asynchronous programming and how RxJava works.\nLook at the code in the sample app and follow it.\nI close the issue because it's not related to RxPermissions.\n. And good luck :)\n. I redirected you to the sample app, do the same and it will work.\nSorry I don't have the time to explain.\n. I think Nougat is not enough to enable Java 8 features, Jack compiler must also enabled as well.\n. Good catch\n. But undoable since the transformers are parametized.\n. Thanks but you need to fix and update the tests.\n. The feature has been suggested and approved in #68  :)\n. From https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting.html\n\nTo help find situations where the user might need an explanation, Android provides a utiltity method, shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale(). This method returns true if the app has requested this permission previously and the user denied the request.\nNote: If the user turned down the permission request in the past and chose the Don't ask again option in the permission request system dialog, this method returns false. The method also returns false if a device policy prohibits the app from having that permission.\n\nSo in your case, the first time the user denied the request, the method should return true. Unless you have a device policy which prohibits the app from having the camera permission, or unless there's something wrong in your implementation (but didn't find what).\nOther thing, I think you should check if permission is granted first, because in that case it's possible that shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale returns false.\n. That's weird because that's not what the documentation say...\n\nThis method returns true if the app has requested this permission previously and the user denied the request.\n\nMoreover on my app I get the expected result by invoking that method after I request the persmissions (I use RxPermissions.shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale())\n. The behavior you described for after the permission sounds correct to me, and fit the documention. Is it what you experienced with your case ?\n. By doing it before we break what most users will expect from that value.\n@vanniktech So you want to know when the user has clicked on \"Never ask again\", that's simple, the code below should work with the after way : \njava\n.subscribe(permission -> {\n    if (permission.granted)  {\n      // All good\n    } else if (permission.shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale)\n      // Denied permission without ask never again\n    } else {\n      // Denied permission with ask never again      \n      // Need to go to the settings\n    }\n  });\nThat's currently what I do in my app and it works like a charm.\n. @tarasantoshchuk \n\nalso we should rename Permission#shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale to something like Permission#deniedForever. This way the meaning of the field will be obvious for user.\n\nI disagree, by keeping the name we don't have to maintain an extra documentation. Users should know about shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale.\n. @vanniktech \n\nIf you just pressed the deny button and checked \"don't ask again\" I don't want to navigate the user into the settings. However if the user comes back and then presses that button and the Android Dialog can't be shown anymore since the user pressed \"don't ask again\" then I need to navigate the user into the settings.\n\nWhy having a separate behavior between the first time the user denied with \"don't ask again\" and the second time ?\nBoth time you should display a snackbar or something like that, telling him he has to go to the settings if he finally changed his mind, with a button that brings him to the settings.\n. > Maybe both values should be taken into permission. The value before asking the permission and the value after the user did that.\nNope I don't want that. The expected behavior according to the android documentation is to invoke shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale after a request, not before. Moreover this will be horrible with variable name like *before and *after.\nYou'll have to add extra code in your app to handle your case.\n. I read your sample code again, and even with the before way, I'm not sure this will fit your need because shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale can return false in 3 cases : \n- user clicks on never ask again\n- permission has never been asked\n- permission is already granted\n``` java\nrxPermissions.requestEach(Manifest.permission.CAMERA)\n  .first()\n  .toSingle()\n  .subscribe(permission -> {\n    if (!permission.shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale) {\n      // Need to go to the settings\n      // Or the permission has never been asked\n      // Or the permission is already granted\n    } else if (permission.granted) {\n      // All good\n    } else {\n      // Denied permission\n    }\n  });\n})\n``\n. I merged your PR but moved theshouldShowRequestPermissionRationaleinvocation after therequestPermissions`. Thanks for the contribution.\n. I don't understand why there's an infinite loop, but I see something wrong in your code. \nIn the first flatMap you shouldn't return null but Observable.empty(). But actually you don't even need the switchEmpty operator, just return locationUpdatesObservable instead of null in the first flatMap.\n. java\n.filter(granted -> granted)\n. In case of deny, the chain stops at the filter. There's probably something else in your code that requests the permission again and again.\n. Closed for no activity\n. Please remove .DS_store file\n. > Anything that is stopping this?\nNo, I wanted to find the time to review with a minimal knowledge of rxJava2, but I'm very busy for the moment. Let's merge it and see what's coming.\n. I knew I missed something, the package name didn't change. It should be com.tbruyelle.rxpermissions2 \n. I fixed that in master and 2.x branches.\n. Possible duplicate of #46\n. #46  is now fixed, please try again with version 0.8.0\n. There is RxPermissions.isGranted method that calls internallyContextCompat.checkSelfPermission but it doesn't return an Observable, so you have to do it yourself.\njava\nObservable.just(RxPermissions.isGranted(...))\n. Ok I see. What's the benefit of such feature ? \n. I don't see how the permission could be revoked at runtime. When you revoke a permission for an app in the settings, the app is killed by the framework.\n. By design, the process of permission request is hard-linked to the Activity (sadly like too much things in the Android framework). \nWhat you could try is sharing a subject between your activity and your data layer, observe that subject in the data layer and feed it in the activity when a permission is granted. Not sure if it's possible that said, I don't know your achitecture.\n. And sharing a subject is probably over-engineering. \n. Well, I think we have to move forward about this issue, and this is probably the simplest way. Thanks for the contribution.\nI would like to have review from people involved in #46, @tarasantoshchuk ? @artesa ? @NitroXenon ? WDYT?\n. I think finally I'm going to accept @tarasantoshchuk's PR (#53) because it's more accurate. Sorry for the very long delay... I'll probably merge it on monday.\n. Please join a screenshot, I don't understand.\n. Should be fixed since we don't use an activity any more for requesting permission.. Because it would be cumbersome to start an activity just for that. I only need the activity as a parameter, I don't need to catch the activity result like request or ensure.\n. > 0.8.0 needs rxjava 1.x version, while 0.8.1 needs rxjava 2.x version.\nNot really. RxJava version is handled by the package name.\nfor RxJava 1.x use compile 'com.tbruyelle.rxpermissions:rxpermissions:0.8.0@aar'\nfor RxJava 2.x compile 'com.tbruyelle.rxpermissions2:rxpermissions:0.8.1@aar'\n. rxPermissions.request(Manifest.permission.CAMERA).subscribe() compiles. \n. > I guess I need to include the rxJava itself as a dependency?\nNo, that's not required, Gradle do it for you. Package changes between RxJava1 and RxJava2, that's probably why you get this error.\n. You can also have this kind of exception if you don't follow the library guidelines.\n. We can't emit an error precisely because we can't find the subject for the requested permission.\n. Your code seems to gather all conditions to trigger the biggest flaw of this library : configuration change handling. As you read in #3 there's no workaround, so we have the choice to follow the guidelines or to stop using RxPermissions.\n. Not relevant\n. Sounds cool. Can you explain what the benefit of using a retained fragment, and what are the rotating screen issues you fixed ?\n. Fine, I have to do some tests. \n. Sorry for the delay. \nI briefly started some tests and first of all I got a crash in the sample app, when I return to the sample app after tweaking the app permissions in the settings. RxPermissions.getInstance returned null so a NPE raised. \nIt seems there's a bug in the  newInstance detection.\nTo reproduce : \n- open the Sample app\n- Open the settings and go to applications>RxPermissions Sample>permissions and update the permissions\n- return to the Sample app -> crash\n. Ok since you moved the subjects list in the fragment, there's no need to have RxPermissions.onRequestPermissionResults(), everything can be done in the fragment if I'm right.\nI'm still testing.\n. Another issue, if you invoke requestEach directly in your activity onCreate, there's a crash because RxPermissionsFragment.getActivity() returns null. It seems the fragment is not yet attached to the activity at this time (aahh that's why I love fragment...)\nTo reproduce, change the sample app MainActivity like that : \n``` java\n@Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        final RxPermissions rxPermissions = RxPermissions.newInstance(this);\n        rxPermissions.setLogging(true);\n    setContentView(R.layout.act_main);\n    surfaceView = (SurfaceView) findViewById(R.id.surfaceView);\n\n            rxPermissions.requestEach(Manifest.permission.CAMERA)\n                    .subscribe(new Action1<Permission>() {\n                                   @Override\n                                   public void call(Permission permission) {\n                                       Log.i(TAG, \"Permission result \" + permission);\n                                       if (permission.granted) {\n                                           Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this,\n                                                   \"Camera permission granted\",\n                                                   Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();\n                                           releaseCamera();\n                                           camera = Camera.open(0);\n                                           try {\n                                               camera.setPreviewDisplay(surfaceView.getHolder());\n                                               camera.startPreview();\n                                           } catch (IOException e) {\n                                               Log.e(TAG, \"Error while trying to display the camera preview\", e);\n                                           }\n                                       } else if (permission.shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale) {\n                                           // Denied permission without ask never again\n                                           Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this,\n                                                   \"Denied permission without ask never again\",\n                                                   Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();\n                                       } else {\n                                           // Denied permission with ask never again\n                                           // Need to go to the settings\n                                           Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this,\n                                                   \"Permission denied, can't enable the camera\",\n                                                   Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();\n                                       }\n                                   }\n                               },\n                            new Action1<Throwable>() {\n                                @Override\n                                public void call(Throwable t) {\n                                    Log.e(TAG, \"onError\", t);  // <--- crash is reported here\n                                }\n                            },\n                            new Action0() {\n                                @Override\n                                public void call() {\n                                    Log.i(TAG, \"OnComplete\");\n                                }\n                            });\n\n}\n```\n. Np, the PR is promising, I hope it can remove the biggest drawback of the library : having to subscribe during the init phase.\n. Sure, for the moment I try to find the time to complete the tests, sry for\nthe delay.\nLe jeu. 10 nov. 2016 23:21, Eduardo Alejandro Pool Ak\u00e9 \nnotifications@github.com a \u00e9crit :\n\n@tbruyelle https://github.com/tbruyelle let me know if you need any\nchange for this PR please.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/tbruyelle/RxPermissions/pull/91#issuecomment-259824931,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAFoePlWgTPju5O_3IhVzurULi_PH1acks5q85jKgaJpZM4Km2OR\n.\n. I completed some tests about config change and it's ok. \nNow I'm worried about the breaking change you introduced by removing the hability to get the singleton instance of RxPermissions. Is it really necessary ?\n\nOther subject, the changes need to ported also in the 2.x branch, and that's a boring job.\n. > I can rollback the renaming from RxPermissions.newInstance(activity) to RxPermissions.getInstance(activity)\nThat would break the contract because as you said it's no more a singleton. I prefer to have a simple constructor rather than newInstance.\n\nRegarding 2.x I can create a new branch from 2.x, apply these changes on that branch and create another PR against 2.x branch.\n\nGreat, let's do this. Thanks in advance\n. Well I'm not sure, wdyt? \n. Ok let's merge it\n. Ready in version 0.9.0 (not 0.8.3 because of the breaking change)\n. And thanks for the awesome work!\n. > Permission is banned in android 5.1\nWhat do you mean  ?\n. Closed  no feedback from op. You can use requestEach which emits similar results but returns an observable rather than a transformer. See the readme just before the Important read section.\n. It seems to be something linked to your fragment usage, not RxPermissions.\n. Closed no feedback from op. I updated to 1.2.2 and so far so good c8e57f063785202d033f4ae47e833bfcc4c80a84\n. I've just uploaded version 0.8.2 with rxJava 1.2.2 dependency if you want to check\n. Thanks for the PR but the problem is now probably fixed in version 0.9.0, where we don't use activities any more. Could you check ?\n. Well sorry but as requestPermissions() is a method attached to an Activity (and not a Context) I don't feel bad about requiring an Activity for the constructor argument.\n. Closed no response from op. Thx @epool. I'll fix the README.. You have the problem only when debugging?. When you request the permission, onPause is executed in your activity, do you execute specific code in there?. Ok, @epool do you think it could come from the fragment ?\n@ersin-ertan Can you check if you have a similar behavior with version 0.8.2 please ? You'll have to change new RxPermissions(this) with RxPermissions.getInstance(this).. Fine, so problem solved ?. > I wouldn't think so, but I'm not sure what you as a library developer could do to prevent this problem.\nYes, that's what I mean by 'problem solved'\n\nHaving the noHistory option is important for some apps, would you know of any possible solutions?\n\nNo idea but I found this on stack : \nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/35151233/requesting-android-m-permissions-from-activity-with-nohistory-true-and-or-show?rq=1. \"Always ask\" ?

Sorry but the library won't support this kind of manufacturer custom dev.\nLe jeu. 24 nov. 2016 14:57, Liverm0r notifications@github.com a \u00e9crit :\n\nYes, If I set \"allowed\" or \"refused\" the behavior is as it should be.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/tbruyelle/RxPermissions/issues/100#issuecomment-262781775,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAFoeIrIzPF74sKLeE949zSbIlKz6kiYks5rBZe9gaJpZM4K5jgx\n.\n. It is lightweight, it requires no declaration in manifest, it fixes a small ui bug.  What's your opinion about that ?. That said @epool, is it possible for you to apply the change in the 2.x please ?. No need to be sorry, thanks!. You're not the first and I'm sorry.\nThat said I don't understand why you perform something that can lead to an UI interaction in a Service.. > @vanniktech @epool You should almost always be using the support library Fragments\n\nIn theory that makes sense but having the support library as a dependency in a library project can be a PITA for some users.. > Well, basically I have an ongoing location sharing service. And if a user goes to the app's settings and disables the location permission, I want the app to prompt the user to re-enable the location permission\nThanks I understand, but where does the request permission dialog appear when you request a permission from a Service ? I mean, if you are in an different app, the dialog appears in front of it ?. Well I'm pretty sure it's not something that Google would approve XD.. IMAO the best way is to pop a notification indicating the permission change, the notif click launches an activity explaining why the permission is required and allow to request again.. @epool ping, did you find the time to work on the 2.x branch ?. You have to use ensureEach, which provides more information. In particular it gives you the result of shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale.\nCheck the readme.. Gn\u00e9?. I'll add the missing tag. About the 2.x branch, @epool is working on it, thanks to him.. Cause I didn't switch to rxjava2 yet in my projects. The 2.x branch is not something I planned.. Well this bug is hard-boiled. We had it in the past and did ugly fixes to remove it. I really though it won't come back since we use a fragment and not an activity. But the Android framework is definitively not a good friend. \nI'll commit a fix to ignore the crash, because now I'm tired.. Fixed in version 0.9.1. Well the less ugly way would be to move that methods static...\nIs it very annoying to do it yourself ?\njava\nObservable.just( context.checkSelfPermission(p) == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED ) . Ok, I'll wait your PR to see.. Version 0.9.1 fixes that exception.. Great job thank you. \n(Ping @epool : job done ^^). There's no need of static method for that.. I'll fix the README. @epool Any idea ?. Closed because no response from op. Please provide the code, sry for the delay. Reopen the issue at the same time.. Since we use a fragment to request the permission, RxPermissions now needs an activity.\nIt may be a constraint, but an activity is also needed if you request the permission with the core methods.\nAbout your problem with Dagger, I suggest to create an other module in your activity, or to remove RxPermissions from injected dependencies, and create it manually.. Try rxPermissions.request(Manifest.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE). \nYou will receive a compiled result of user answers.\n. You can't merge 2.x and master branches. One is dedicated to Rxjava2 and the other to Rxjava1.. Why did you change the author ids ?\nWhat is the purpose of that PR?. Please create a clean PR with the only the changes you want. I close this one for now.. No you can't, shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale() is an Activity method.. Thanks a lot for this change and for the explanations :). 0.9.3 has been upload for master and 2.x branch.. Dup of #142 . Yes it makes sense, I thought about that too but it would introduce a breaking change without real benefit (Single class didn't exist when I started the library).. Ow I think there's a PR for that... #121 . You probably do something wrong with your fragment usage to have this exception, anyway, version 0.9.2 now perform commitAllowingStateLoss.. Just added the tag v0.9.3. About the change log I'm sorry for the moment I don't have the time to maintain it.. I dont think RxPermissions is currently not compatible with the Support lib.. I know that, but that doesn't mean the lib isn't compatible with the support lib.. So is there good reason to use the support library ?. No you can use it in a fragment. Write the error handler to catch the\nexception and report it please.\nLe jeu. 23 mars 2017 \u00e0 03:07, naivor notifications@github.com a \u00e9crit :\n\nWhen i use RxPermissions in Fragment,i get a exception, the log is\nrx.exceptions.OnErrorNotImplementedException: xxx\nIs RxPermissions can only use in Activity?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/tbruyelle/RxPermissions/issues/130, or mute the\nthread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAFoeK5sppco3QY6u98EESRkkOVha01qks5rodPUgaJpZM4MmEZr\n.\n. You should force the version 0.9.3 for the library. . There's possibly a breaking change between 0.7 and 0.9.3. You have no other choice than trying  to update the library code.. Thank you for the replies, I close the issue. Sounds legit, please submit a PR and I'll merge it.. The lib is there https://bintray.com/tbruyelle/tbruyelle/RxPermissions2/0.9.3, maybe jcenter had connectivity issues during your attempt. Please try again and let me know.. Didn't understand what's your problem.. It's in the README, use requestEach/ensureEach to have a detailled object of what happened during the permission request.. This is the normal behavior. If the user has clicked \"never ask again\" and if the permission is critical for your app, you have to invite the user to go to the settings and to change manually the permissions of your app. There's no other alternatives.. Thanks for the PR, I will have time to review it at the end of the week. Stay tuned.. Ty!. 0.9.4 contains the PR. Fragments are really a plague !. Sorry I have no idea, community pushed me to use fragments for this lib (originally it was an Activity), and I finally accepted but I regret. I don't use fragment from ages, so sorry I can't help you.. This lib doesn't handle Xiaomi specific permission system.. Ty!. Didn't understand your first point.. I disagree. From the android doc : \nYou should do this only if you do not have the permission.\n\nhttps://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale(java.lang.String). > firstly , the \"isGranted\" is true , and then the phone show the permission dialog\nNo. The Action1 is only invoked when user has answered all permission dialog requests.. Why do you have a Samsung you're a developer isn't it ? xD. Yes that's strange, it's the first time someone raise me this kind of issue. I don't think it's the first time the library is used on a S7.\nThis only occurs the first time you request the permission ?. So it's when the dialog appears, maybe Samsung broke something in the lifecycle during this process.\nAre you sure you perform the request in an initialization phase ?. Do you request inside a click listener ? If yes it's not an initialization phase and you will have the same problem on any device if you rotate the screen while the permission dialog is shown.\nTry to follow the example in the README : \njava\n// Must be done during an initialization phase like onCreate\nRxView.clicks(findViewById(R.id.enableCamera))\n    .compose(rxPermissions.ensure(Manifest.permission.CAMERA))\n    .subscribe( ... ). @lopspower so did you fix the issue with my last comment ?. Gne. Please read the README and look at the sample project, you would find out.. Why?. Details?. It seems you use the wrong version, Flowable is part of rxjava-2. Use com.tbruyelle.rxpermissions2:rxpermissions. The API already provides the hability to pass multiple permissions in the arguments.\nAbout the Android O Permission changes : https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/android-8.0-changes.html#rmp\nI don't think there's something to change in this library for that. WDYT ?. It's rxjava1 on master branch, and rxjava2 on 2.x branch.. I don't know is this required for APACHE2 license ?. @dsaff @nmulcahey thank you guys, I've just added it to the README.. No you can't. Dup of #142 . No, I don't want to add complex features like that.. This may be a bug that occurs only on some manufacturer OS. Sorry I can't do anything for that.. Speak english please. Is it something new ? Can you link me the doc please ?. Ok there's nothing new, the lib already handles shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale.. > If needed, here's a class that has all the groups and their permissions:\nIs it a class from the framework ?. Well it should be !\nYou can create a PR on this if you want.. That would be nice, but this requires to maintain the list carefully, for instance when a new permission is added to the framework ?. OK fine.\n@StringDef is an android feature, why didn't they add this on their own permission definition, that's a shame.. The library won't handle it.. There's no such bug in the library.\nDont forget to declare the permissions in your manifest.\n. ",

I have something like restoring / recreating an Observable from Bundle and share that observable with multiple subscribers in mind.\n. ",

Could you please provide more detailed steps which you can reproduce it with? (Does not happen for me when using both request() and ensure()).\n. Not sure that 202 users, who've faced that crash so far in our app, will agree with you :)\n. @tbruyelle Ok, let's think of it more generally. Android can kill our process and then recreate it in three cases:\n1. App crashes\n2. Memory pressure, if all activities are already destroyed\n3. User goes to the settings and changes permissions, and then returns to the app.\nObviously, we are not interested int the case 1. Case 3 also seems by and large low-probable. However, case 2 still may be probable enough to be the reason.\n202 users is a low number for our auditory, but it's much higher than we expected.\n. I totally agree, that it's far from the best solution. However, according to the conception of Safe-driven development, it's a good decision to hide all crashes in production, keeping them in development builds. So, it may be better that nothing.\nThe problem with this crash is that it happens in library's insides, so we get no chance to even wrap it in try-catch until the solution will be found. The single option is to fork the library and add it as a third-party project.\nMaybe we can add a log or non-fatal report instead of a strict crash there? Thus library's safety will be improved with killing two birds -- we'll have a marker of the issue to further return to it (as we already know the steps), and we'll protect users from facing crashes in production.\n. Checked - now works as expected.\nThank you!\n. Looks like problem has appeared due to some changes in the null publish subjects handling.

Could you please provide more detailed steps which you can reproduce it with? (Does not happen for me when using both request() and ensure()).\n. Not sure that 202 users, who've faced that crash so far in our app, will agree with you :)\n. @tbruyelle Ok, let's think of it more generally. Android can kill our process and then recreate it in three cases:\n1. App crashes\n2. Memory pressure, if all activities are already destroyed\n3. User goes to the settings and changes permissions, and then returns to the app.\nObviously, we are not interested int the case 1. Case 3 also seems by and large low-probable. However, case 2 still may be probable enough to be the reason.\n202 users is a low number for our auditory, but it's much higher than we expected.\n. I totally agree, that it's far from the best solution. However, according to the conception of Safe-driven development, it's a good decision to hide all crashes in production, keeping them in development builds. So, it may be better that nothing.\nThe problem with this crash is that it happens in library's insides, so we get no chance to even wrap it in try-catch until the solution will be found. The single option is to fork the library and add it as a third-party project.\nMaybe we can add a log or non-fatal report instead of a strict crash there? Thus library's safety will be improved with killing two birds -- we'll have a marker of the issue to further return to it (as we already know the steps), and we'll protect users from facing crashes in production.\n.

Depending on User grant/decline WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission the captured Image will be located at ExternalStorageDirectory/ExternalFilesDir but the request forWRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGEnever get callback (onNext, onError, onComplete`)\n. This is demonstration code @tarasantoshchuk \nFirstly, request camera permission\n```\nprivate void requestCameraPermission() {\n        mSubscription = rxPermissions.request(Manifest.permission.CAMERA)\n                    .subscribe(new Subscriber() {\n                        @Override\n                        public void onCompleted() {\n                        }\n                    @Override\n                    public void onError(Throwable e) {\n                        e.printStackTrace();\n                    }\n\n                    @Override\n                    public void onNext(Boolean aBoolean) {\n                        if (aBoolean) {\n                             requestWriteExternalStoragePermission(MEDIA_TYPE_IMAGE.getMediaType());\n                        } else {\n                            InploiUtils.showSnackbar(view, R.string.permissions_not_granted);\n                        }\n                    }\n                });\n}\n\n```\nThen request write external storage permission\n```\nprivate void requestWriteExternalStoragePermission(final String mediaTpe) {\n        if(mSubscription != null) {\n            mSubscription.unsubscribe();\n        }\n        mSubscription = rxPermissions.request(Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)\n                .subscribe(new Subscriber() {\n                    @Override\n                    public void onCompleted() {\n                        Timber.e(\"onCompleted\");\n                    }\n                @Override\n                public void onError(Throwable e) {\n                    Timber.e(\"onCompleted\");\n                    e.printStackTrace();\n                }\n\n                @Override\n                public void onNext(Boolean aBoolean) {\n                    if (!aBoolean) {\n                        showSnackbarWarning(aBoolean, mediaTpe);\n                    } else {\n                        showMediaType(aBoolean, mediaTpe);\n                    }\n                }\n            });\n}\n\n```\n.

That feature was introduced on Android 6.0+ api 23 marshmallow. In previous version the permissions are accepted on installation time, but as far as I know there is not a way to disable them manually. If I'm wrong please share us a screenshot of how you are disabling the permissions manually and another one with the android version please. . @tinylpc what is happening when you request some permission on the onResume() method is that android OS displays the permission dialog, then your activity is paused as you can see on this diagram, and when you accept or reject the permission the permission dialog is closed and then your activity call the onResume() method again, and if you rejected the permission the permission is requested again because is on the onResume() method. Doesn't look like a bug, probably you should avoid requesting permissions on your onResume() method to avoid this behavior.. I just could reproduce this putting a breakpoint on requestPermissions(permissions, PERMISSIONS_REQUEST_CODE); from RxPermissionsFragment:\njava\n@TargetApi(Build.VERSION_CODES.M)\nvoid requestPermissions(@NonNull String[] permissions) {\n    requestPermissions(permissions, PERMISSIONS_REQUEST_CODE);\n}\nWhen the breakpoint is reached(the permission dialog is not displayed yet), then I re-run the app on debug mode and there is where the dialog is shown. I couldn't find another way to reproduce this, so I'm not sure if it's a bug or something related with the app relaunching stuff.\nBut looks like it's not related with android:noHistory=\"true|false\" that didn't affect my test flow.. It's weird, I haven't seen that configuration before on a device, my Nexus device doesn't have that option and I couldn't reproduce it \ud83d\ude1e  . But if you set allowed or refused the behavior is the expected?. Also we don't need to \"hack\" a transparent/shadow activity for managing permissions since we can make it from a fragment without view and we could retain the permission status through activity lifecycle. But I'd like to know what do you think about that also.. > On first glance the idea seems smart although I'm not so sure whether this can have any drawbacks since it's still a Fragment and they behave oddly. At least that's how I feel about them. I try to avoid them as much as I can.\nI agree that fragments behave oddly sometimes, but it's due his async nature, actually I try to avoid them too, but the way we are using them here is forcing the fragment to be sync on setup time, so we shouldn't worry about this from my point of view.\n\nAlso this 'hack' of a transparent activity is quite common, no? I've seen it already in a few other places as well.\n\nNot sure, but could be useful in some scenarios.\n\nAlso before I was able to use RxPermissions regardless of an activity being present or not which means I was able to use it in Services and other places where no activity is present.\n\nAn Activity is always required to request permissions so I don't this that the library should support asking permissions from a Services but I agree that that feature is really useful, but that feature could be a extension/module or perhaps another library, but again that is my humble opinion.\n\nNow even for checking whether a permission is granted or not it needs a fragment.\n\nI don't see this like a problem, but we could retain a reference to the activity on RxPermission class and then use that reference for checking permissions and make the fragment building lazy perhaps.\n\nAlso I'm not sure whether the library should use the 'real' fragments or v4 fragments and whether or not by using both as a consumer things could get mingled up.\n\nI'm ok with using the 'real' fragments, v4 are used to support backward compatibility with old android versions, but since runtime permissions were introduced in API 23 I can't see any drawback regarding using 'real' fragments.\n\nAnother thing that I've seen often times is that devs are manually manipulating the fragment stack e.g. via pushing or popping fragments. So in theory could this change go and break if someone suddenly tries to pop the fragment while the permission request is in process or was just recently started?\n\nIn theory this couldn't since we are not adding the retained fragment on the fragment back stack.. Yeah I hope to do it this weekend, I haven't had free time these days, sorry.. @tbruyelle not yet but next week I'll be taking vacations and I will work on 2.x branch. @teresaholfeld that action is pretty straightforward to do with a context reference like a service I guess, you can take a look at #111 where that PR is adding static methods for doing what you are looking for.. Awesome! \ud83d\ude03 . @bxqgit RxJava 2 is currently supported through compile 'com.tbruyelle.rxpermissions2:rxpermissions:0.9.1@aar'. Actually I'm thinking that could be 23 since this version is where the library is useful. @tbruyelle I'm not sure seems like the library it's being used in a activity and then the activity is finished quickly or something like that. @ar-g could you please tell us how are you using the library and/or share us a project to reproduce this issue please? In advance thanks. . @ar-g what is your current architecture or from where are you calling requestWriteExternalStoragePermission(activity)? Why are you doing a new RxPermissions(activity)... inside that method and not keep a RxPermissions instance on your class with the same scope of your activity?. @MinkiPan could you please share us a project example to reproduce this error? I have tried to reproduce it but I wasn't lucky, I was able to request permissions inside of a fragment in the onActivityCreated method.. @afiqiqmal you don't need to request permissions again inside of the the .subscribe(), you can do a new Observable from rxPermissions.requestEach(permissions) something like:\njava\nrxPermissions.requestEach(permissions)\n                .filter(permission -> permission.granted || permission.shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale)\n                .takeFirst()\n                .map(permission -> false)\n                .defaultIfEmpty(true)\n                .subscribe(wereAllPermissionsRejectedPermanent -> ...);\nwith this approach we are taking the first granted permission and mapping it to true so at least one permission was granted, and if all the permissions were rejected with never ask again we will get a empty observable and in that case we are mapping it to true and with this we can know if all the permissions were rejected permanently. Let us know if we can help you some better or perhaps I could not understand your problem at all.. @afiqiqmal Feel free to reopen this issue if you consider it necessary.. @cat1024 could you please provide us more information about this issue? some pieces of code, stack trace and steps to reproduce it could be helpful.. @boomstack I'm not sure to figure out what case you are trying to consider as a potential bug. Since the fragments are totally independents between them there shouldn't be any problem between other fragments, each fragment just depends on the Activity lifecycle. I have seen your demo project but wasn't able to get your point, could you please explain your point better or even better update your demo project to show us the case you are considering  as a potential bug?. @boomstack Feel free to reopen this issue if you consider it necessary.. @yuxinLi @ChinaDragon01 do you have some example project for reproducing it?. @isVoid actually this library doesn't require Java 8 to works, you could still using anonymous classes instead of lamdas, but if you really want to take advantage of the lamda syntax, you could use Retrolambda or even still using Java 8 directly from Android Studio, google deprecated Jack toolchain but not Java 8 support, take a look here.. also you could take a look at the sample project here. totally agree with @mrArtCore. closing due not much information for this issue, @jianwenzhou feel free to reopen it with a clearer description of the issue thanks!. @xchengDroid could you share a project where we can be able to reproduce this issue?. @SeaMyC It's not possible to request permissions from an Application class in Android, that is why RxPermission requires an Activity instead of an Application or Context class.. @YellFunGit what version are you using?. probably version 0.9.0 solve the problem, but now sure. let us know if that version solves the problem.. @mengdd could you please provide us a basic project with the deep link configuration you are trying, to reproduce this issue?. @KushtrimPacaj could you please resolve the conflicts for merging this PR?. @Gregliest you could try 0.9.0 to verify if that version fixes you problem.. @tbruyelle I was getting a issue on the emulator, when I tap on request permission and permission dialog was shown and then I rotate the display and accept the permission the application demo was crashing.

Let us know if we can help you some better or perhaps I could not understand your problem at all.. @afiqiqmal Feel free to reopen this issue if you consider it necessary.. @cat1024 could you please provide us more information about this issue? some pieces of code, stack trace and steps to reproduce it could be helpful.. @boomstack I'm not sure to figure out what case you are trying to consider as a potential bug. Since the fragments are totally independents between them there shouldn't be any problem between other fragments, each fragment just depends on the Activity lifecycle. I have seen your demo project but wasn't able to get your point, could you please explain your point better or even better update your demo project to show us the case you are considering  as a potential bug?. @boomstack Feel free to reopen this issue if you consider it necessary.. @yuxinLi @ChinaDragon01 do you have some example project for reproducing it?. @isVoid actually this library doesn't require Java 8 to works, you could still using anonymous classes instead of lamdas, but if you really want to take advantage of the lamda syntax, you could use Retrolambda or even still using Java 8 directly from Android Studio, google deprecated Jack toolchain but not Java 8 support, take a look here.. also you could take a look at the sample project here. totally agree with @mrArtCore. closing due not much information for this issue, @jianwenzhou feel free to reopen it with a clearer description of the issue thanks!. @xchengDroid could you share a project where we can be able to reproduce this issue?. @SeaMyC It's not possible to request permissions from an Application class in Android, that is why RxPermission requires an Activity instead of an Application or Context class..

In short, it can result in keep calling onRequestPermissionsResult.\nFixed by put the check login in Activity onStart using RxPermissions.. ",

If you dont want your listeners being invoked twice or more, you MUST unsubscrbe from them in, for instance, onDestroy() activity callback.\nIn your current realization I have seen that you're subscribing to different observables, giving references to your UI elements and activity. But, as you probably know, after screen roation, activity destroys and recreates. And in your realization it couldn't be destroyed, cause your have references to activity in RxJavaEnviroment. So after rotation you have 1 activity in memory and another one that rectreates. \nAnd all callbacks such as onCreate(...), onStart() etc are called again. And you again subscribe to all rx stuff and give away references to new Activity )))\nSo you have now 2 (or more, depend of how many times you rotate phone) references to your activity after screen rotation and memory leak =)) lol =)\nHow to fix:\nadd all Subscriptions to CompositeSubscription and in some Activity's callback like (onPause()) call compositeSubscription.clear(). Those magic things unsubscribe all your listeners and avoid memory leaks and multiple firing of subscribe() method \nPS your listeners will show 2 toast cause you listen same things in different places. So you have something task like below :\nI want doSomeWork() being called if(and when) 1st OR 2nd buttons get  permission allowed in onSubscribe \nBut you do doSomeWork() when 1st button get event AND when 2nd get. You share this event between 2 subscribers, you know, and nothing strange didn't happen. You received it and display 2 times in general.\nYou should use Combined observables in this case.
