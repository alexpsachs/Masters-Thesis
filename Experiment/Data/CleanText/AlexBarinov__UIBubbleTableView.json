    "AlexBarinov": "Hi. Thank you for contributing to the project. At this point it's hard for me to think of user story where one would need to delete a message in the chart, especially is this is not the message the one has sent. Even if these is potentially possible, the default delete button destroys the UI. Can it be something like red minus without overlapping with bubbles on the screen? Please let me know your thoughts.\n. Wow! Cool! I'll take a look on this and think how to merge this better way. Right now github says it can not be merged automatically, so probably there's extra work to do.\n. Ok, avatars are there. For the flexible width I guess the Message.app does not have this. So I'm unsure if to add this.\n. Thank you. I'll definitely take a look at this.\n. Hi,\nI'm not sure that using indexPathForRow: is the way the bubble table designed. The bubble table is rather data driven, so calling reloadData will be the most suitable solution. Until you call reloadData, the sections and cells are not updated (delegate is not asked for the new data) and addObject into bubbleData actually does nothing except adding new object into array (I mean no new cell is created). This causes inconsistency. \nAlex\n. Ok, I received them and will review soon.\n. Right, basically I would like to leave non-ARC support as well. There should be a def checked (i.e. #define ARC_ENABLED).\n. Should be there with the last commit.\nThere's ARC_ENABLED macro defined in *.pch file (commented by default). To make the code ARC compatible, uncomment it (or define the same in your project).\nCan anybody verify it please?\n. Image bubbles are now there. Check the site or example to see how it looks like. Use table delegate to perform any action you want when user clicks the image.\n. Hi Dennis\nUnfortunately I've got example app crashing while running the code and tapping on a message. It looks like now it is mandatory to have the didSelectRowAtIndexPath: function, which I believe should be optional (this is really not required to display the messages). In this case the code should also check if the selector exists (this is the cause of the crash).\nI understand you want to add it but let's put this on hold, cause now I have feeling that putting action function into data source is wrong. There are two ways out: 1. Refactor the data source to anything else (let's say UIBubbleTableDelegate?) or 2. Create yet another protocol UIBubbleTableViewDelegate which is pretty same as UIBubbleTableDelegate.\nSecond point above makes no sense to me as long as it's just redefinition, and does not solve conflicts of UIBubbleTableViewDelegate and UITableViewDelegate as they both have same method: didSelectRowAtIndexPath\nSo now I'm inclined to think of renaming UIBubbleTableViewDataSource to anything else and extending it.\nThank you\n. Hi Dennis.\nAlright, now I see what you mean. That's true, that inside of UIBubbleTableView data is sorted in it's own way and one can not know for sure what was pressed. Thank you for pointing this out.\nOk, this needs to be fixed then. \nReturning index in the callback, however, I think does not make much sense as long as you don't know that's there with this index. There are two possible solutions in my head right now:\n1) Return NSBubbleData instead of index into callback.\n2) Add block into NSBubbleData to invoke it when bubble is pressed.\nAny other ideas?\n. Can you send me the code to reproduce and your environment to github@alex.barinov.name, please?\n. Not right now, but maybe I'll add later.\n. Hi Matt,\nThank you for getting back with avatars. But things happened that I've already added this into master branch. So it appears we did the same work twice. Thank you for contributing!\nAlex\n. There's no config, but\n1) you can change in the the code to fit your needs\n2) you can use custom view and insert anything you want into a bubble\nI'll consider adding config sometime later\nAlex\n. Thank you for contributing\n. Sorry, I'm afraid I don't get it.\nYou can add any custom view (including image button) into bubble, if you mean this.\nUse\n- (id)initWithView:(UIView )view date:(NSDate )date type:(NSBubbleType)type insets:(UIEdgeInsets)insets;\n- (id)dataWithView:(UIView )view date:(NSDate )date type:(NSBubbleType)type insets:(UIEdgeInsets)insets;\n  methods.\n. Did you add the .m files into the target when adding to the project?\n. Same as previous: did you add files into the target?\n. Ummm... Sorry, didn't get it. Can you elaborate please?\n. Ok, and why do you think the code expects this? Actually my intention was to be able to set delegate to any object which conforms to UIBubbleTableViewDelegate, which is common way. Did I miss anything in the code that prevents to do so?\n. Come on, is it an issue? :)\nWell, to do so you need to rework UIBubbleTableViewCell.m according to your needs. There's no plan to support this in master branch, so you can do it in your fork.\n. Implement \n- (void)scrollViewDidEndDecelerating:(UIScrollView )scrollView\n- (void)scrollViewDidEndDragging:(UIScrollView *)scrollView willDecelerate:(BOOL)decelerate\n  in the delegate\n. Thank you\n. Ok, any solution for this?\n. ",

    "qiulang": "I understand what you said but the reason I raised this question in the first place was that I do not want reload all the data when I just got a new message and I already have, say 20 or 30 bubble messages showing on the screen. I read your implementation for reloadData, so eveytime I call it I have to recreate all NSBubbleDataInternal again. To me it seems a waste if I just got 1 new message with 20 other messages already showed.\nSo I was asking this question to see if there is a way to make insertRowsAtIndexPaths work ?\n. Hi I modified you code and it works. So before I call insertRowsAtIndexPaths I find I need to insert a new NSBubbleDataInternal into its section. \nNow I modified my code to make it work in more general case and I will try to submit my codes to you.\n. send my codes to github@alex.barinov.name, I added a new method insertANewBubble: to UIBubbleTableView. I assume in most case the new added bubble message is the latest message so I did not employ more complicated algorithm to find the appropriate section for it, just scan section one by one.\n. ",

    "eliburke": "This would be useful for me as well. Alex, would you be willing to post qiulang's patch here if you don't have time to review it right now?\n. Another snippet: I have a previously sorted list of messages, and needed to be able to scroll to a particular message: e.g. scroll to the first unread message:\nint rows, section = 0, sections = [bubbleTable numberOfSections];\nfor ( ; section < sections; section++) {\n    rows = [bubbleTable numberOfRowsInSection:section];\n    if (searchIndex < rows) {\n        NSIndexPath * path = [NSIndexPath indexPathForRow:searchIndex inSection:section];\n        [bubbleTable scrollToRowAtIndexPath:path atScrollPosition:UITableViewScrollPositionTop animated:YES];\n    } else {\n        searchIndex -= rows;\n    }\n}\nUnfortunately, because UIBubbleTableView:reloadData creates an internal list of cells and sorts them by date, this technique is not always going to be applicable. \n. These cap insets appear to work properly with the included bubble images:\nif (type == BubbleTypeSomeoneElse)\n{\n    self.bubbleImage.image = [[UIImage imageNamed:@\"bubbleSomeone.png\"] resizableImageWithCapInsets: UIEdgeInsetsMake(15, 21, 16, 21) ];\n} else {\n    self.bubbleImage.image = [[UIImage imageNamed:@\"bubbleMine.png\"] resizableImageWithCapInsets: UIEdgeInsetsMake(15, 21, 16, 21) ];\n}\n. Thanks for the patch. Works perfectly!\n. Maybe you would be interested in porting your changes over to https://github.com/huffpostlabs/HPLChatViewController which is an updated fork of UIBubbleTableView\n. I've been seeing this intermittently since iOS7 as well. I'm using a heavily modified subclass of HPLChatTableViewCell and I assumed that I broke something, but this sounds like behavior I've encountered. \n. You might want to use this fork, which is more up-to-date:\nhttps://github.com/huffpostlabs/HPLChatViewController/\nIf you set your ControllerView to be the table's delegate, then you can implement didSelectRowAtIndexPath in the ControllerView. \nOr, you could use a gesture recognizer:\n// in viewDidLoad\n_tapRecognizer = [UITapGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self action:@selector(onListTap:)];\n[_chatTable addGestureRecognizer _tapRecognizer];\nand\n- (void)onListTap:(UIGestureRecognizer*)recognizer {\n    if (recognizer.state == UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded) {\n        CGPoint tapLocation = [recognizer locationInView:_chatTable];\n        NSIndexPath *tapIndexPath = [_chatTable indexPathForRowAtPoint:tapLocation];\n        UIBubbleTableViewCell * cell = (UIBubbleTableViewCell*) [_chatTable cellForRowAtIndexPath:tapIndexPath];\n        // create new view here\n    }\n}\n. It's been a while since I worked with the stock code, but you might take a look at heightForRowAtIndexPath  in UIBubbleTableView to make sure it has the correct size of your image. If that fails, try setupInternalData in UIBubbleTableViewCell\n. The problem is indeed the call to - (float)tableView:(UITableView )tableView heightForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath )indexPath. When compiled for 64-bit, CGFloat is 64 bit, whereas float is only 32-bit. The method signature doesn't match, so heightForRow is never called. Changing it from float to CGFloat is exactly the right solution.\n. ",
    "BinaryDennis": "yeah, this sounds like the best solution. \n. Excellent job! Thank you very much, appreciate it.\n. ok, thanks for the reply.\nMoreover.....however u implement the callback, the receiving controller will have problem determining wether the [NSBubbleData view] is of type UIImageView or not. It seems like UIBubbleTable will sort the list of NSBubbles internally based on timestamp, which then prevents the receiving controller to keep an internal data array (indexes will not match). \nI also tried setting tag for the views I add with [NSBubbleData dataWithView:attachmentImageView...] but it seems the tag is not preserved when the controller gets the callback?!\nPossible solutions would be to add a custom field to NSBubbleData which the controller can set and then read when the callback is called.  \nDo you understand what I mean? What do you think would be a good solution?\n. Ive currently implemented solution 1 in my private branch, which I find easier to work with.
