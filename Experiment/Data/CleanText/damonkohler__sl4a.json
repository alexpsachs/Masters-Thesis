It provides the basic \nboilerplate when creating a new script, and the auto-close maps. \nIf the language is not a \"supported\" language, then, as of sl4a_r5x07, the \neditor will use the base Language object:\nhttp://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/source/browse/android/Common/src/com/\ngooglecode/android_scripting/language/Language.java\n... which provides basic parentheses and quote on autoclose, but nothing else.\nWriters of new interpeter implementations are encouraged to submit a \nLanguage.java so that the built in editor can do nice things.\n```\nOriginal comment by rjmatthews62 on 28 Mar 2012 at 2:25\n.

With python sl4a, if the 'same' webview \nis opened (ie: samefile.html), it will display the previous cached page, which \nis not good if you change the page code, such as viewing an image jpg, then \nviewing a new image jpg.  With apps built on sl4a, webviews are the only real \nuseable user interface.  I tried having the script name a new page (ie: \nnewfile1.html; newfile2.html; ...) but still the old cached jpg image was used. \n in my app, i display a number of images to the user ina webview, updating the \njpg image in the html code each view.  I solved this by ALSO changing the jpg \nnames (ie: jpg1.jpg; jpg2.jpg; ...)\nTo do this:\nimport random\nrandomPageName=random.randrange(0,100)\nrandomJpgName=random.randrange(0,100)\nhtmlPage=open('//file'+str(randomPageName)+'.html','wb')\nhtmlPage.write('')\nhtmlPage.close()\ndroid.webViewShow('//file'+str(randomPageName)+'.html')\n..get the idea?\nfurther to this, i delete the folder i use for the app upon exiting the script:\nimport shutil\nshutil.rmtree('/sdcard/MyAppFolder')\nmypath=('/sdcard/MyAppFolder')\n...then to make your folder again:\nimport os.path\nif not os.path.isdir(mypath):\n   os.makedirs(mypath)\nCheers:)\nand please have a look at my apps:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=FineLineLabs\n```\nOriginal comment by MichaelD...@gmail.com on 24 Oct 2012 at 2:51\n.

Else, GOTO 6.\n6) Check logcat; note out-of-memory messages, \"Process \ncom.googlecode.android_scripting (pid) has died\" message.\nYou may have to repeat steps 3-4 a few times.  I've seen the crash after as \nmany as 10 repeats or as few as 4.  The script I used to test this essentially \ndoes nothing; it opens a loopback socket and listens forever for connections.\nSee also attached logcat output.\n```\nOriginal comment by brett.hi...@gmail.com on 3 Feb 2011 at 8:47\nAttachments:\n- sl4a_out_of_memory_crash.txt\n.

From @GoogleCodeExporter on May 31, 2015 11:25\n```\nI've managed to get a build of NumPy on android, as described here \nhttp://groups.google.com/group/android-scripting/browse_thread/thread/2378edd0dc\n5048fb/90156932d2fa20bc .  I've attached my patch, and here are the steps I had \nto take to get it to build and compile.\n0) I built this on OSX Darwin, using the pre-built NDK r4, and I used \nandroid-8/arch-arm.\n1) I'm still not sure how to get a new version of the Python tree on a \nnon-emulator phone (I am new to this!) so I have not done so. However, it works \nfine on my emulator.  I'll try building an APK shortly and will update the \nissue with this info.\n2) The attached patch modifies the NumPy sources (1.4.1) to allow LONG_DOUBLE \nto be undefined, to remove the usage of unittest, to remove the \"newdoc\" and to \nremove some of the changes to the build system to force linkages against \naccelerated LAPACK on OSX.  One could imagine \n3) I had to modify agcc a bit to get it to work with the pre-built Darwin \ntoolchain in the NDK, but I assume this is par for the course. \n4) The NumPy compilation had to be modified substantially. \n   - CFLAGS had to pre-empt the linkage against the host Python's \npyport.h, which meant adding in a -I/path/to/device/python2.6 \n   - CC had to be set to be agcc. \n   - The build had to be done as \"hostpython setup.py build --fcompiler=fake install --prefix=/path/to/host\".  This should get piped into a log file. \n   - But, because it manually runs ranlib and links shared libraries, I had to additionally grep out the calls to gcc and to ranlib.  I re-did all the ranlib calls with arm-eabi-ranlib (this was for libnpymath.a), and then I re-ran the linkage with the same agcc arguments used for shared library linking in the Python Makefile: \"-Xlinker -export-dynamic -shared\" instead of (in my case on OSX) \"-bundle -undefined dynamic_lookup\". \n   - (This procedure is reminiscent of the full-static linkage done on Cray machines, where the solution is to usually just overwrite the build step in distutils.  I'm not sure if changing the toolchain for distutils is in the works for SL4A, but it might be neat.  For more info: http://yt.enzotools.org/wiki/CrayXT5Installation#Python ) \n   - the installation command didn't work, and would overwrite my libraries, so I manually copied them to the appropriate location in the python tree. \n5) I had to \"adb push\" the directory structure into the Python directory on the \nemulator, in \n/data/data/com.googlecode.pythonforandroid/files/python/lib/python2.6/site- \npackages/ \nOne thing I noticed was that without the \"compiler\" module installed .npz and \n.npy files, which are NumPy's mechanism for serializing arrays, were \nunavailable for use.  I'd personally really like to be able to pass data back \nand forth in this manner, so I re-enabled them.  But, perhaps flat binary is \nokay.\n```\nOriginal comment by matthewt...@gmail.com on 13 Aug 2010 at 3:00\nAttachments:\n- sl4a_numpy.patch\n.

For two reasons I want to split my script in two: a generic \npython wrapper and the real script. a) the python binary from sl4a doesn\u2019t \nrun without setup and b) the minimum setup necessary should not be repeated in \nall scripts. The call will look like\nsu -c '/path/to/pythonwrapper /script/to/run/as/root'\nThis runs \"/the/shell/of/root -c '/path/to/pythonwrapper \n/script/to/run/as/root'\".\nI can\u2019t do much for the root-shell, beyond hoping that Android removes \nLD_LIBRARY_PATH from environment in the future, or su starts cleaning it (in \nCyanogenmod 7.1 it does not).

The problem with using su is that only the root \n(uid=0) and shell (uid=2000) users are allowed to use it.  All other users, in \nmy cases my application, receive \"su: uid XXXX not allowed to su\".  This is \ndone for security reasons, no one wants a rogue application with root \npermissions. O wait we do... So my work around was to recompile su binary \nwithout this nasty security catch, called it suu (substitute user \nunrestricted), pushed it into /system/xbin, gave it permissions (chmod 6755 \nsuu), and use it instead of su.  So far its been working pretty well.  I'm \nawhere this is a massive security hole, but any method of giving an application \nroot rights is a security hole.

If nothing else, that should allow support for sockets \non its own, but it might also allow working more directly with the android API. \n Are the facades accessible through the API, or just RPC?  If it's just RPC, it \nmight be worth while to provide a direct facade API in Java for the languages \nthat support working with Java classes.\nOf course, if someone comes along with a Scheme implementation that doesn't \nallow Java access -- something with a more \"native\"/standard approach -- they'd \nhave to work with the RPC/JSON stuff.

It provides the basic \nboilerplate when creating a new script, and the auto-close maps. \nIf the language is not a \"supported\" language, then, as of sl4a_r5x07, the \neditor will use the base Language object:\nhttp://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/source/browse/android/Common/src/com/\ngooglecode/android_scripting/language/Language.java\n... which provides basic parentheses and quote on autoclose, but nothing else.\nWriters of new interpeter implementations are encouraged to submit a \nLanguage.java so that the built in editor can do nice things.\n```\nOriginal comment by rjmatthews62 on 28 Mar 2012 at 2:25\n.

From @GoogleCodeExporter on May 31, 2015 11:30\nNo settings on my i9000 for ipv6 to play with unfortunately. Although it \nwouldn't surprise me if it has something to do with it. ipv6 has given me \nnothing but headaches on other systems. I also can't seem to find any sort of a \nhosts file on it. I thought it might be worth a try to add an entry for \nlocalhost with 127.0.0.1 or 198.168.0.1 but seems the stock rom doesn't feel I \nneed to be able to find that file though. Can't find any of the files I could \nedit to disable ipv6 either, I know they're there, it just doesn't allow me to \nsee them. Reluctant to root or flash to another rom until my warranty runs out. \nI will do some googling regarding your suggestion though.

From @GoogleCodeExporter on May 31, 2015 11:30\nHave not found a way to access /system on non-rooted phone. Due to this cannot \nverify hosts file contains proper entry for localhost. Can't imagine why it \nwouldn't, but all the same cannot verify that it does. Would like to be sure \nfollowing lines exist:\n127.0.0.1   localhost\n(for ipv6:)\n::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback\nI will continue to google regarding this. Output from lsmod in terminal does \nnot return anything regarding ipv6 however, docs suggest ipv6 is enabled by \ndefault and /proc/net/if_inet6 does exist and was located via terminal. Would \nlike to disable ipv6 in order to see if that resolves issue but have not yet \ndetermined how to do so. There are no settings to configure and cannot directly \nedit files (configuration file of kernel module loader) as I would usually do \non *NIX based systems due to not having access to /system via USB. It's worth \nnoting that although I cannot access /system via USB, I am able to navigate to \nthe directory via terminal on the phone. So if anyone can suggest a vim or nano \nlike command line text editor I may be able to make use of that. Have not found \nanything on the market in the searches I've done.

There exists code to wash the cache in java but not \npython apparently.. does someone as a solution in python we didn't see? \nThanks \nLio\nOriginal comment by lio.chi...@gmail.com on 28 Dec 2011 at 3:53\n. From @GoogleCodeExporter on May 31, 2015 11:29\n```\nI solved this in a programmatic way.  With python sl4a, if the 'same' webview \nis opened (ie: samefile.html), it will display the previous cached page, which \nis not good if you change the page code, such as viewing an image jpg, then \nviewing a new image jpg.  With apps built on sl4a, webviews are the only real \nuseable user interface.  I tried having the script name a new page (ie: \nnewfile1.html; newfile2.html; ...) but still the old cached jpg image was used. \n in my app, i display a number of images to the user ina webview, updating the \njpg image in the html code each view.  I solved this by ALSO changing the jpg \nnames (ie: jpg1.jpg; jpg2.jpg; ...)\nTo do this:\nimport random\nrandomPageName=random.randrange(0,100)\nrandomJpgName=random.randrange(0,100)\nhtmlPage=open('//file'+str(randomPageName)+'.html','wb')\nhtmlPage.write('')\nhtmlPage.close()\ndroid.webViewShow('//file'+str(randomPageName)+'.html')\n..get the idea?\nfurther to this, i delete the folder i use for the app upon exiting the script:\nimport shutil\nshutil.rmtree('/sdcard/MyAppFolder')\nmypath=('/sdcard/MyAppFolder')\n...then to make your folder again:\nimport os.path\nif not os.path.isdir(mypath):\n   os.makedirs(mypath)\nCheers:)\nand please have a look at my apps:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=FineLineLabs\n```\nOriginal comment by MichaelD...@gmail.com on 24 Oct 2012 at 2:51\n.

I've attached my patch, and here are the steps I had \nto take to get it to build and compile.\n0) I built this on OSX Darwin, using the pre-built NDK r4, and I used \nandroid-8/arch-arm.\n1) I'm still not sure how to get a new version of the Python tree on a \nnon-emulator phone (I am new to this!) so I have not done so. However, it works \nfine on my emulator.  I'll try building an APK shortly and will update the \nissue with this info.\n2) The attached patch modifies the NumPy sources (1.4.1) to allow LONG_DOUBLE \nto be undefined, to remove the usage of unittest, to remove the \"newdoc\" and to \nremove some of the changes to the build system to force linkages against \naccelerated LAPACK on OSX.  One could imagine \n3) I had to modify agcc a bit to get it to work with the pre-built Darwin \ntoolchain in the NDK, but I assume this is par for the course. \n4) The NumPy compilation had to be modified substantially. \n   - CFLAGS had to pre-empt the linkage against the host Python's \npyport.h, which meant adding in a -I/path/to/device/python2.6 \n   - CC had to be set to be agcc. \n   - The build had to be done as \"hostpython setup.py build --fcompiler=fake install --prefix=/path/to/host\".  This should get piped into a log file. \n   - But, because it manually runs ranlib and links shared libraries, I had to additionally grep out the calls to gcc and to ranlib.  I re-did all the ranlib calls with arm-eabi-ranlib (this was for libnpymath.a), and then I re-ran the linkage with the same agcc arguments used for shared library linking in the Python Makefile: \"-Xlinker -export-dynamic -shared\" instead of (in my case on OSX) \"-bundle -undefined dynamic_lookup\". \n   - (This procedure is reminiscent of the full-static linkage done on Cray machines, where the solution is to usually just overwrite the build step in distutils.  I'm not sure if changing the toolchain for distutils is in the works for SL4A, but it might be neat.  For more info: http://yt.enzotools.org/wiki/CrayXT5Installation#Python ) \n   - the installation command didn't work, and would overwrite my libraries, so I manually copied them to the appropriate location in the python tree. \n5) I had to \"adb push\" the directory structure into the Python directory on the \nemulator, in \n/data/data/com.googlecode.pythonforandroid/files/python/lib/python2.6/site- \npackages/ \nOne thing I noticed was that without the \"compiler\" module installed .npz and \n.npy files, which are NumPy's mechanism for serializing arrays, were \nunavailable for use.

As $PATH is not filtered by su, relative commands should be rejected by su \n(but it fails here).\n2)\nDoes Android\u2019s shared library loader fail on ignoring LD_LIBRARY_PATH on suid \nprograms like su? BUG! Or does it just not remove it from the environment?\n3)\nAssuming we want to run a couple of python scripts as root, the user trusts \nthose scripts. For two reasons I want to split my script in two: a generic \npython wrapper and the real script. a) the python binary from sl4a doesn\u2019t \nrun without setup and b) the minimum setup necessary should not be repeated in \nall scripts. The call will look like\nsu -c '/path/to/pythonwrapper /script/to/run/as/root'\nThis runs \"/the/shell/of/root -c '/path/to/pythonwrapper \n/script/to/run/as/root'\".\nI can\u2019t do much for the root-shell, beyond hoping that Android removes \nLD_LIBRARY_PATH from environment in the future, or su starts cleaning it (in \nCyanogenmod 7.1 it does not). The shell is hopefully too simple to load \nprofiles or anything else.\n4)\nThe pythonwrapper runs from a possibly hostile environment, as root.\nLets implement it in shell. The first line should be\n!/the/shell/of/root\nwhich for me is /system/bin/sh\nIf this is a security risk, I was already fucked in 3). The rest is:\nclean the environment of all PYTHON*\nunset \"${!PYTHON@}\"  # doesn\u2019t work in my crappy Android shell\ndataPath=/data/data/com.googlecode.pythonforandroid/files/python\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/vendor/lib:/system/lib:$dataPath/lib \\\nPYTHONHOME=$dataPath \\\nPYTHONPATH=/vendor/lib:/system/lib:/sdcard/com.googlecode.pythonforandroid/extra\ns/python \\\nexec \"$dataPath\"/bin/python \"$@\"\nAssuming that simple shell doesn\u2019t read aliases and functions from the \nenvironment, because \u201cexec\u201d may be one.\n5) now it is on the \u201ctrusted script\u201d to clean up from a possible attacker. \nEmptying the environment may be one thing to do.\n```\nOriginal comment by Darten.b...@gmail.com on 5 Jun 2012 at 12:24\n. From @GoogleCodeExporter on May 31, 2015 11:24\nI've been after this issue for a few days now and i've tried most of the above \nfixs, but they didn't work.  The problem with using su is that only the root \n(uid=0) and shell (uid=2000) users are allowed to use it.  All other users, in \nmy cases my application, receive \"su: uid XXXX not allowed to su\".  This is \ndone for security reasons, no one wants a rogue application with root \npermissions. O wait we do... So my work around was to recompile su binary \nwithout this nasty security catch, called it suu (substitute user \nunrestricted), pushed it into /system/xbin, gave it permissions (chmod 6755 \nsuu), and use it instead of su.  So far its been working pretty well.  I'm \nawhere this is a massive security hole, but any method of giving an application \nroot rights is a security hole.  Hope that helps.\nOriginal comment by MQue...@gmail.com on 9 Jul 2012 at 1:41\nAttachments:\n- suu\n.

I have not tested it with BSE which i\nguess ASE is using.\nIs ASE using BSE and is there anything else groovy should be able to do?

From @GoogleCodeExporter on May 31, 2015 11:22\nBSF works nicely with discobot now(the next realease is a week or so away), so\nhopefully it will be possible to use groovy with android scripting in the near\nfuture.\nOriginal comment by mail...@gmail.com on 1 Sep 2009 at 2:20\n.

From @GoogleCodeExporter on May 31, 2015 11:22\n```\nI tried a little.\nFirst get the original binary & source.\nhttp://groovy.codehaus.org/Download\nI wrote this sample code and named it \"hello_world.groovy\"\nprint 'Hello, Groovy!'\nI looked inside the Rhino For Android / BeanShell For Android codes.\nIt seems to need a REPL command.\nGroovy's command is like this in the JVM jar.\n\njava -cp groovy-all-1.8.6.jar groovy.lang.GroovyShell hello_world.groovy\n\nSo I tried to convert it to the Dalvik(dx) jar like this.\n\ndx --dex --output=c:..foo..\\base\\groovy-all-1.8.6-dx.jar \nc:..foo..\\groovy-all-1.8.6.jar\n\nAnd made an interpreter apk from the template from the repo and upload it to my \nweb space and also made the zip like \"groovy_extras_r1.zip\", \n\"groovy_scripts_r1.zip\"\n(the jar is in groovy folder inside the \"groovy_extras_r1.zip\")\nIt get's an error and fails when you excute the \"hello_world.groovy\".\nI think my dx-jar is not good enough. But there must be a way to solve this.\nI wrote this because someone could help this issue somedays...\n```\nOriginal comment by tomcatalbino on 12 Feb 2012 at 3:57\n.
