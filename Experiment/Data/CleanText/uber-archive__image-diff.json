This PR will fail Travis CI due to #17 not being landed.\n. Awesome, thanks @mlmorg!\n. Can you please provide more explanation for the introduction of these changes? To me, I see mostly noise of different development styles and would prefer more context.\n. Ah, I see what's going on now.\nRegarding the /* mocha: true */ option, I prefer to keep all the files running under the same lint conditions; one-off settings on a per-file basis makes the project feel inconsistent (because it is).\nFor fs interactions, node automatically coerces / to \\ for Windows (similar to how it's doing it for the strings that include / in the path.join when they should be different parameters).\njs\n// Should really need to move to\npath.join(__dirname, 'test-files', 'checkerboard.png');\n// not\npath.join(__dirname, '/test-files/checkerboard.png');\nhttps://github.com/joyent/node/blob/v0.12.2/lib/fs.js#L482-L491\nhttps://github.com/joyent/node/blob/v0.12.2/lib/path.js#L305-L327\nhttps://github.com/joyent/node/blob/v0.12.2/lib/path.js#L531-L533\nI am fine with upgrading mocha for the sake of more up to date dependencies but I think the other changes aren't a problem and causing PR noise.\n. Looks good :+1: \n. I disagree with this PR. sudo: false is fine but fast_finish are for maintainers to choose. When I do development, I prefer to see all failing builds. node@0.11 was out as the latest for a very long time, I think it would be negligent to remove it from Travis CI entirely.\n. Can you elaborate more on the reason behind these changes? Also, can you squash this down to 1 commit?\n. After doing some research, it looks like imagemagick supports outputting the diffImage to stdout:\n``` bash\nNo output image is generated but piped to /dev/null\ncompare -verbose -metric RMSE -highlight-color RED -compose Src checkerboard.png white.png - 1> /dev/null\n```\nWe can prob coerce options.diffImage to - when it's falsy to handle this case. However, then we will start to generate a buffer of the diff image which is wasteful (child_process.exec doesn't support ignoring this):\nhttps://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback\nAs a result, we should switch to child_process.spawn and use ignore for stdio on stdout:\nhttps://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options\nhttps://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_options_stdio\n. @LinusU I have opened #24 which should fix this issue\n. @LinusU This has been patched/released in 1.1.0.\n@mlmorg I forgot to add a \"Fixes #23\" to the PR, can we close this issue? =/\n. bower/buffered-spawn#5 was landed/released and this PR is now on top of the patched version. This PR is good to be reviewed/landed.\n. Woot, thanks for the quick land @mlmorg =)\n. I don't understand this PR. Can you please explain it?\n. Left some comments on how to better structure the code. As far as naming goes with \"shadow\", I don't feel like that gives me the right idea. How about something more focused at opacity or averaging the images? (e.g. underlayImagesAverage)\n. Ah, k. I guess we should keep shadow for consistency in naming then. Thanks for pointing that out =)\n. Our dissimilarity threshold comments are getting buried due to a shifting diff. Previous to this PR, both locally and Travis CI have been passing without dissimilarity-threshold. What version of ImageMagick are you running?\nbash\ncompare --version\n. One more thing to note is that typically PRs need to be squashed to 1 commit to be landed so we should start squashing on each update to this PR =/\n. I am running 6.7.7-10 locally and Travis CI is on 6.6.9-7 (seen from the logs). Can you try upgrading?\nhttps://travis-ci.org/uber/image-diff/jobs/67943987\n. Sweet, everything looks good. I am going to open up a follow up PR with an updated README/CHANGELOG to get this landed (weird process due to leaving the organization). I will post here with the PR number to subscribe but this should auto-close when it's landed.\n. Alright, #26 has been opened and hopefully this will be published soon =)\n. @064678147 You should be good to go. This has been landed/released in 1.2.0\n. Awesome, thanks for the quick land @mlmorg =)\n. Yep, I don't think this is possible with imagemagick; either we provide an outfile or we don't (and ignore stdout/stderr). Can you explain your use case more? Typically people want consistent behavior for a low level library like this =/\n. Ah, alright. Thanks for the clarification. Since there is a workaround and no easy/performant support, I think it's prob best to close this issue.\n@mlmorg Can we close this issue?\n. Thanks @mlmorg =)\n. This is a duplicate of #27. The reason is our underlying engine (ImageMagick) has no options to perform this action. In the future, please be sure to search issues (both opened and closed) to prevent using unnecessary time.\n@mlmorg Can we please close this issue?\n. Can we add a test case for this comment? Maybe we should break out the extraction method so we can test it more independently (i.e. without needing an image)\n. Nah, I imagine that would require very large images to be stored in the repo. We should relocate the .match into its own function so it can be tested independently\n. Yea, but this will also put us in a more flexible state for the future. I am going to open a secondary PR to add that functionality. This PR looks good for now.\n. I have opened up #30 which brings this PR over the finish line and ready for landing.\n. Woot, thanks @mlmorg =)\n. Why did you open a duplicate issue for this? Please close it =/\n. Every repo does this differently -- for me, I think a PR can be considered as an issue tracker. This one can be closed =/\n. Can you explain how you used gm with Graphics Magick? I want to make sure I'm not assuming anything\n. Cool, thought so but wanted to make sure it wasn't you running gm compare on the CLI =P\nI think adding an option for disabling ImageMagick sounds reasonable. Let's go with the name imageMagick for consistency with gm (we can make it default to true for backwards compatibility).\njs\nimageDiff({imageMagick: false, actualImage, ...})\nWould you be interested in writing a PR for this?\n. After getting the problematic images, we were able to track down the source of the problem and open a PR that seems to patch the issue. More specific details can be found on the PR itself\n34\nIf you would like to try out the PR locally, then it can be installed via a git URL via npm:\nhttps://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#git-urls-as-dependencies\nbash\n\"image-diff\": \"git://github.com/twolfson/image-diff#ef3aa9f\"\n. Ah, I'm realizing that there is a very specific way I want #32 done. Effectively, if I tell you how to do it, then I will be writing the code so I guess I should just write the damn code.\nSorry for wasting your time on this x_x\n. For reference, problems in this current iteration:\n- All instances of ImageDiff are using a common global gm (should be per-instance)\n- We have a require inlined in a method, not done at load time which causes sync loading =(\n- We are still using compare instead of gm in a location\n. Alright, I can do that\n. Left some comments to resolve, additionally we need to take care of the compare call. We should be able to do something like:\n``` js\nthis.diffCmd = useImageMagick ? 'compare' : 'gm';\nthis.baseDiffArgs = useImageMagick ? [] : ['compare'];\n// Then in the compare call\nvar diffArgs = this.baseDiffArgs.concat([\n  '-verbose',\n  // ...\n])\n``\n. Can you upload the images you are comparing?\n. So does that mean everything is working as expected?\n. Ah, sorry. I meant on the unalteredmasterbranch of this project (i.e. tag1.3.0/commitd9dc82030b5d77d829c484151b7716290177175e`)\n. Ah, I have created a gist to reproduce the issue. It looks like a problem with the library, not your OS nor ImageMagick nor GraphicsMagick.\nhttps://gist.github.com/twolfson/710485d2941d0e19b5d5\n. After a bit of digging, it looks like we were using this.crop instead of this.extent x_x After making that change, everything seems to work as expected\n. I got something working locally but it broke again with the example images you provided. Unfortunately, I have to take off for the night. I will take a look at getting it resolved by the end of the weekend.\n. A replacement PR has been opened in #33, can you please close this PR?\n. Sorry, I meant #34\n. Awesome, thanks for the fast merge @mlmorg =)\n. Fortunately we are using our own compare invocation with buffered-spawn so we don't have that vulnerability.\nhttps://github.com/uber/image-diff/blob/1.5.0/lib/image-diff.js#L70-L96\nHowever, I agree that an upgrade would be best to prevent potential future regressions. Would you be interested in opening a PR?\n. @jacobp100 This should be resolved now that #38 has been landed and released in 1.5.1. Can you please close this issue? (I no longer have write access on the repo despite being the author =/)\n. Looks good to me. @mlmorg Can we land this?\nProposed CHANGELOG message and release command:\n1.5.1 - Upgraded to `gm@1.21.1` to resolve security advisory via @jacobp100 in #38\nbash\n./release 1.5.1\n. Sweet, thanks for the quick merge @mlmorg =)\n. We should be able to add a new function or option to expose that. I think a new function would be ideal so we can keep our types consistent. I will whip up a PR to get your feedback.\n. Alright, I have created a branch with my proposed content. Before I submit it as a PR though, I want to verify it will work for you. Can you look over the README changes here?\nhttps://github.com/twolfson/image-diff/tree/dev/add.result.callback.sqwished#imagediffgetfullresultoptions-cb\n. Yep, it should be the new method. Nice catch :+1: I will open a PR shortly\n. Alright, PR #40 has been opened up\n. No worries, thanks @mlmorg! =)\n. Looks like too much was fixed in that last commit. Left another comment. Can you please squash the commits into 1 commit as well?\n. Run git rebase -i master and change all commits except for the first 1 to \"squash\". Here's a demonstration:\nhttps://ariejan.net/2011/07/05/git-squash-your-latests-commits-into-one/\nOnce the commits are squashed into 1, you will need to force push the update. That can be done via:\nbash\ngit push origin patch-1 --force\n. It is in this PR, maybe you are viewing a subset of the commits?\nhttps://github.com/uber/image-diff/pull/41/files#diff-354f30a63fb0907d4ad57269548329e3R3\nhttps://travis-ci.org/uber/image-diff/jobs/145087157\n. You need to run the git rebase -i master first and choose \"squash\" for all but the first commit as instructed =/\n. Also, make sure you are on the patch-1 branch when running git rebase\n. You can but you should be able to do everything on this branch/PR =/\n. Looks good to me. Can someone land this as a patch revision and add to the CHANGELOG:\n1.6.1 - Updated Node.js versions in Travis CI via @amilajack in #42\nTo release, it should be:\nbash\n./release.sh 1.6.1\n/cc @mlmorg \n. Awesome, thanks @mlmorg =D\n. AppVeyor support sounds reasonable but it can be time consuming to set up (i.e. push, wait for AppVeyor to fail for a trivial mistake, rinse, and repeat). I would be up for setting it up but I would need repo access again =/\nThat being said @amilajack, you didn't answer the question about if image-diff fails/throws an error on Windows right now =/\n. Sooo we could be fine on Windows then? This is more about getting 1 more system that we automatically check via CI?\n. Fwiw, Microsoft offers Windows VMs for testing Internet Explorer which can be reused for testing on Windows:\nhttps://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/\n. Looks good to me. Notes for release process:\nPatch version release should be fine. Here's some notes for the CHANGELOG:\nmd\n1.6.2 - Updated Travis CI badge from PNG to SVG via @amilajack in #44\nCommands for new release:\nbash\n./release.sh 1.6.2\n/cc @mlmorg \n. Thanks @mlmorg! It looks like we forgot to update the CHANGELOG though =/\n. Libraries like bluebird offer promisify which should resolve this issue.\nhttp://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api/promise.promisify.html\njs\nvar imageDiff = Promise.promisify(require('image-diff'));\n@mlmorg Can we please close this issue?\n. Looks good to me. Here's the CHANGELOG and release command:\nmd\n1.6.3 - Fixed word splitting in `release.sh` via @andlrc in #47\nbash\n./release.sh 1.6.3\n. Thanks @mlmorg =)\n. Yea, we are open to supporting GraphicsMagick. In fact, #33 was working on this but it turned out to be the wrong solution to a different problem. The PR is rather incomplete but it's a good starting point for parameters and edge cases to handle\n. What happens when you run the command outside of image-diff?\nidentify -ping -format %wx%h run-first/login-2-after.png\n. That's peculiar; ImageMagick never has a prefix and GraphicsMagick typically uses gm as its prefix. Can you link us to where you installed ImageMagick from?\nhttp://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-processing.php\nhttp://www.graphicsmagick.org/convert.html\n. Ah, interesting. After doing some research on the gm repo, this is due to name conflicts with some Windows executables.\nhttps://github.com/aheckmann/gm/issues/559\nIt still isn't patched in gm so we can't upgrade to anything newer. For now, the workaround from that linked issue is to use \"Install legacy utilities\" during installation\n. @mlmorg Can we add a new label named \"blocked\" with color #000000 and add it to this issue?\nhttps://github.com/uber/image-diff/labels\n. @dawsonbotsford gm is a dependency of our repo =/ It's going async which is why we don't see the rest of the stacktrace leading back to image-diff\nFor example: https://github.com/uber/image-diff/blob/1.6.3/lib/image-diff.js#L50-L55\n@feistar It looks like something killed the ImageMagick process which was performing the diff (or resizing an image), e.g. kill -9 <imagemagick_process_id>. Did you kill anything locally?. @feistar There are a bunch of asynchronous functions being called in a synchronous manner (e.g. mkdirp should be using mkdirp.sync or placing the rest of the code in its callback to verify the directory exists). However, none of them seem to look like they would cause a SIGKILL =/\nIs it possible that there are multiples of the same image being downloaded? If so, then ImageMagick might self terminate when the file it was talking to vanishes\nVarious notes on the race conditions:\n\nimagesAreSame should use a callback with the boolean result from imageDiff.getFullResult. The current setup is attempting to use it synchronously when it doesn't/can't return anything; it can only callback =/\nrequest.head and request().pipe() aren't doing any error checking\nmkdirp should be mkdirp.sync or use a callback before getting to the setInterval piece\n\nI should also note that if you are doing image comparison for images that consistently the same size, you can skip image-diff and use pixelmatch which does everything in memory so you won't need to manage files:\nhttps://github.com/mapbox/pixelmatch. 1. No, mkdirp was designed after coreutils' mkdir which won't error out on mkdir -p:\n    - https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp/blob/0.5.1/index.js#L27-L52\n    - In the case a directory already exists, Node.js would callback with the error code EEXIST (which means the file/folder already exists). mkdirp jumps to its default error case which verifies it is in fact a directory (which is it) and calls back with no error\n2/3. Okay, sounds good :+1: . I think we can close this issue due to inactivity. I'm down for supporting this but it seems strange there is no environment variable to do that (e.g. libraries will often allow PHANTOMJS_BIN or similar to specify the executable path). I'm going to open an issue on gm to see if we can add that support so all dependent libraries don't need to support passing in appPath. Ah, good eye. I'm sure we can replace that with gm's _exec or _spawn when the upstream issue is settled and we upgrade for support\nhttps://github.com/aheckmann/gm/blob/1.23.0/lib/command.js#L180-L208. I appreciate the consideration but it's an unnecessary change. We should only make such updates when the entire repo is on ES6. Unfortunately, that's far down on my priorities list due to everything working fine as is =/. Great, thanks @mlmorg. I've opened #56 to complete the README updates for GitHub and npm. This library is no longer supported. Please see the following alternatives:\n\nhttps://github.com/gemini-testing/looks-same\nhttps://github.com/mapbox/pixelmatch. This project is no longer supported.

This PR will fail Travis CI due to #17 not being landed.\n. Awesome, thanks @mlmorg!\n. Can you please provide more explanation for the introduction of these changes? To me, I see mostly noise of different development styles and would prefer more context.\n. Ah, I see what's going on now.\nRegarding the /* mocha: true */ option, I prefer to keep all the files running under the same lint conditions; one-off settings on a per-file basis makes the project feel inconsistent (because it is).\nFor fs interactions, node automatically coerces / to \\ for Windows (similar to how it's doing it for the strings that include / in the path.join when they should be different parameters).\njs\n// Should really need to move to\npath.join(__dirname, 'test-files', 'checkerboard.png');\n// not\npath.join(__dirname, '/test-files/checkerboard.png');\nhttps://github.com/joyent/node/blob/v0.12.2/lib/fs.js#L482-L491\nhttps://github.com/joyent/node/blob/v0.12.2/lib/path.js#L305-L327\nhttps://github.com/joyent/node/blob/v0.12.2/lib/path.js#L531-L533\nI am fine with upgrading mocha for the sake of more up to date dependencies but I think the other changes aren't a problem and causing PR noise.\n. Looks good :+1: \n. I disagree with this PR. sudo: false is fine but fast_finish are for maintainers to choose. When I do development, I prefer to see all failing builds. node@0.11 was out as the latest for a very long time, I think it would be negligent to remove it from Travis CI entirely.\n. Can you elaborate more on the reason behind these changes? Also, can you squash this down to 1 commit?\n. After doing some research, it looks like imagemagick supports outputting the diffImage to stdout:\n``` bash\nNo output image is generated but piped to /dev/null\ncompare -verbose -metric RMSE -highlight-color RED -compose Src checkerboard.png white.png - 1> /dev/null\n```\nWe can prob coerce options.diffImage to - when it's falsy to handle this case. However, then we will start to generate a buffer of the diff image which is wasteful (child_process.exec doesn't support ignoring this):\nhttps://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback\nAs a result, we should switch to child_process.spawn and use ignore for stdio on stdout:\nhttps://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options\nhttps://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_options_stdio\n. @LinusU I have opened #24 which should fix this issue\n. @LinusU This has been patched/released in 1.1.0.\n@mlmorg I forgot to add a \"Fixes #23\" to the PR, can we close this issue? =/\n. bower/buffered-spawn#5 was landed/released and this PR is now on top of the patched version. This PR is good to be reviewed/landed.\n. Woot, thanks for the quick land @mlmorg =)\n. I don't understand this PR. Can you please explain it?\n. Left some comments on how to better structure the code. As far as naming goes with \"shadow\", I don't feel like that gives me the right idea. How about something more focused at opacity or averaging the images? (e.g. underlayImagesAverage)\n. Ah, k. I guess we should keep shadow for consistency in naming then. Thanks for pointing that out =)\n. Our dissimilarity threshold comments are getting buried due to a shifting diff. Previous to this PR, both locally and Travis CI have been passing without dissimilarity-threshold. What version of ImageMagick are you running?\nbash\ncompare --version\n. One more thing to note is that typically PRs need to be squashed to 1 commit to be landed so we should start squashing on each update to this PR =/\n. I am running 6.7.7-10 locally and Travis CI is on 6.6.9-7 (seen from the logs). Can you try upgrading?\nhttps://travis-ci.org/uber/image-diff/jobs/67943987\n. Sweet, everything looks good. I am going to open up a follow up PR with an updated README/CHANGELOG to get this landed (weird process due to leaving the organization). I will post here with the PR number to subscribe but this should auto-close when it's landed.\n. Alright, #26 has been opened and hopefully this will be published soon =)\n. @064678147 You should be good to go. This has been landed/released in 1.2.0\n. Awesome, thanks for the quick land @mlmorg =)\n. Yep, I don't think this is possible with imagemagick; either we provide an outfile or we don't (and ignore stdout/stderr). Can you explain your use case more? Typically people want consistent behavior for a low level library like this =/\n. Ah, alright. Thanks for the clarification. Since there is a workaround and no easy/performant support, I think it's prob best to close this issue.\n@mlmorg Can we close this issue?\n. Thanks @mlmorg =)\n. This is a duplicate of #27. The reason is our underlying engine (ImageMagick) has no options to perform this action. In the future, please be sure to search issues (both opened and closed) to prevent using unnecessary time.\n@mlmorg Can we please close this issue?\n. Can we add a test case for this comment? Maybe we should break out the extraction method so we can test it more independently (i.e. without needing an image)\n. Nah, I imagine that would require very large images to be stored in the repo. We should relocate the .match into its own function so it can be tested independently\n. Yea, but this will also put us in a more flexible state for the future. I am going to open a secondary PR to add that functionality. This PR looks good for now.\n. I have opened up #30 which brings this PR over the finish line and ready for landing.\n. Woot, thanks @mlmorg =)\n. Why did you open a duplicate issue for this? Please close it =/\n. Every repo does this differently -- for me, I think a PR can be considered as an issue tracker. This one can be closed =/\n. Can you explain how you used gm with Graphics Magick? I want to make sure I'm not assuming anything\n. Cool, thought so but wanted to make sure it wasn't you running gm compare on the CLI =P\nI think adding an option for disabling ImageMagick sounds reasonable. Let's go with the name imageMagick for consistency with gm (we can make it default to true for backwards compatibility).\njs\nimageDiff({imageMagick: false, actualImage, ...})\nWould you be interested in writing a PR for this?\n. After getting the problematic images, we were able to track down the source of the problem and open a PR that seems to patch the issue. More specific details can be found on the PR itself\n34\nIf you would like to try out the PR locally, then it can be installed via a git URL via npm:\nhttps://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#git-urls-as-dependencies\nbash\n\"image-diff\": \"git://github.com/twolfson/image-diff#ef3aa9f\"\n. Ah, I'm realizing that there is a very specific way I want #32 done. Effectively, if I tell you how to do it, then I will be writing the code so I guess I should just write the damn code.\nSorry for wasting your time on this x_x\n. For reference, problems in this current iteration:\n- All instances of ImageDiff are using a common global gm (should be per-instance)\n- We have a require inlined in a method, not done at load time which causes sync loading =(\n- We are still using compare instead of gm in a location\n. Alright, I can do that\n. Left some comments to resolve, additionally we need to take care of the compare call. We should be able to do something like:\n``` js\nthis.diffCmd = useImageMagick ? 'compare' : 'gm';\nthis.baseDiffArgs = useImageMagick ? [] : ['compare'];\n// Then in the compare call\nvar diffArgs = this.baseDiffArgs.concat([\n  '-verbose',\n  // ...\n])\n``\n. Can you upload the images you are comparing?\n. So does that mean everything is working as expected?\n. Ah, sorry. I meant on the unalteredmasterbranch of this project (i.e. tag1.3.0/commitd9dc82030b5d77d829c484151b7716290177175e`)\n. Ah, I have created a gist to reproduce the issue. It looks like a problem with the library, not your OS nor ImageMagick nor GraphicsMagick.\nhttps://gist.github.com/twolfson/710485d2941d0e19b5d5\n. After a bit of digging, it looks like we were using this.crop instead of this.extent x_x After making that change, everything seems to work as expected\n. I got something working locally but it broke again with the example images you provided. Unfortunately, I have to take off for the night. I will take a look at getting it resolved by the end of the weekend.\n. A replacement PR has been opened in #33, can you please close this PR?\n. Sorry, I meant #34\n. Awesome, thanks for the fast merge @mlmorg =)\n. Fortunately we are using our own compare invocation with buffered-spawn so we don't have that vulnerability.\nhttps://github.com/uber/image-diff/blob/1.5.0/lib/image-diff.js#L70-L96\nHowever, I agree that an upgrade would be best to prevent potential future regressions. Would you be interested in opening a PR?\n. @jacobp100 This should be resolved now that #38 has been landed and released in 1.5.1. Can you please close this issue? (I no longer have write access on the repo despite being the author =/)\n. Looks good to me. @mlmorg Can we land this?\nProposed CHANGELOG message and release command:\n1.5.1 - Upgraded to `gm@1.21.1` to resolve security advisory via @jacobp100 in #38\nbash\n./release 1.5.1\n. Sweet, thanks for the quick merge @mlmorg =)\n. We should be able to add a new function or option to expose that. I think a new function would be ideal so we can keep our types consistent. I will whip up a PR to get your feedback.\n. Alright, I have created a branch with my proposed content. Before I submit it as a PR though, I want to verify it will work for you. Can you look over the README changes here?\nhttps://github.com/twolfson/image-diff/tree/dev/add.result.callback.sqwished#imagediffgetfullresultoptions-cb\n. Yep, it should be the new method. Nice catch :+1: I will open a PR shortly\n. Alright, PR #40 has been opened up\n. No worries, thanks @mlmorg! =)\n. Looks like too much was fixed in that last commit. Left another comment. Can you please squash the commits into 1 commit as well?\n. Run git rebase -i master and change all commits except for the first 1 to \"squash\". Here's a demonstration:\nhttps://ariejan.net/2011/07/05/git-squash-your-latests-commits-into-one/\nOnce the commits are squashed into 1, you will need to force push the update. That can be done via:\nbash\ngit push origin patch-1 --force\n. It is in this PR, maybe you are viewing a subset of the commits?\nhttps://github.com/uber/image-diff/pull/41/files#diff-354f30a63fb0907d4ad57269548329e3R3\nhttps://travis-ci.org/uber/image-diff/jobs/145087157\n. You need to run the git rebase -i master first and choose \"squash\" for all but the first commit as instructed =/\n. Also, make sure you are on the patch-1 branch when running git rebase\n. You can but you should be able to do everything on this branch/PR =/\n. Looks good to me. Can someone land this as a patch revision and add to the CHANGELOG:\n1.6.1 - Updated Node.js versions in Travis CI via @amilajack in #42\nTo release, it should be:\nbash\n./release.sh 1.6.1\n/cc @mlmorg \n. Awesome, thanks @mlmorg =D\n. AppVeyor support sounds reasonable but it can be time consuming to set up (i.e. push, wait for AppVeyor to fail for a trivial mistake, rinse, and repeat). I would be up for setting it up but I would need repo access again =/\nThat being said @amilajack, you didn't answer the question about if image-diff fails/throws an error on Windows right now =/\n. Sooo we could be fine on Windows then? This is more about getting 1 more system that we automatically check via CI?\n. Fwiw, Microsoft offers Windows VMs for testing Internet Explorer which can be reused for testing on Windows:\nhttps://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/\n. Looks good to me. Notes for release process:\nPatch version release should be fine. Here's some notes for the CHANGELOG:\nmd\n1.6.2 - Updated Travis CI badge from PNG to SVG via @amilajack in #44\nCommands for new release:\nbash\n./release.sh 1.6.2\n/cc @mlmorg \n. Thanks @mlmorg! It looks like we forgot to update the CHANGELOG though =/\n. Libraries like bluebird offer promisify which should resolve this issue.\nhttp://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api/promise.promisify.html\njs\nvar imageDiff = Promise.promisify(require('image-diff'));\n@mlmorg Can we please close this issue?\n. Looks good to me. Here's the CHANGELOG and release command:\nmd\n1.6.3 - Fixed word splitting in `release.sh` via @andlrc in #47\nbash\n./release.sh 1.6.3\n. Thanks @mlmorg =)\n. Yea, we are open to supporting GraphicsMagick. In fact, #33 was working on this but it turned out to be the wrong solution to a different problem. The PR is rather incomplete but it's a good starting point for parameters and edge cases to handle\n. What happens when you run the command outside of image-diff?\nidentify -ping -format %wx%h run-first/login-2-after.png\n. That's peculiar; ImageMagick never has a prefix and GraphicsMagick typically uses gm as its prefix. Can you link us to where you installed ImageMagick from?\nhttp://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-processing.php\nhttp://www.graphicsmagick.org/convert.html\n. Ah, interesting. After doing some research on the gm repo, this is due to name conflicts with some Windows executables.\nhttps://github.com/aheckmann/gm/issues/559\nIt still isn't patched in gm so we can't upgrade to anything newer. For now, the workaround from that linked issue is to use \"Install legacy utilities\" during installation\n. @mlmorg Can we add a new label named \"blocked\" with color #000000 and add it to this issue?\nhttps://github.com/uber/image-diff/labels\n. @dawsonbotsford gm is a dependency of our repo =/ It's going async which is why we don't see the rest of the stacktrace leading back to image-diff\nFor example: https://github.com/uber/image-diff/blob/1.6.3/lib/image-diff.js#L50-L55\n@feistar It looks like something killed the ImageMagick process which was performing the diff (or resizing an image), e.g. kill -9 <imagemagick_process_id>. Did you kill anything locally?. @feistar There are a bunch of asynchronous functions being called in a synchronous manner (e.g. mkdirp should be using mkdirp.sync or placing the rest of the code in its callback to verify the directory exists). However, none of them seem to look like they would cause a SIGKILL =/\nIs it possible that there are multiples of the same image being downloaded? If so, then ImageMagick might self terminate when the file it was talking to vanishes\nVarious notes on the race conditions:\n\nimagesAreSame should use a callback with the boolean result from imageDiff.getFullResult. The current setup is attempting to use it synchronously when it doesn't/can't return anything; it can only callback =/\nrequest.head and request().pipe() aren't doing any error checking\nmkdirp should be mkdirp.sync or use a callback before getting to the setInterval piece\n\nI should also note that if you are doing image comparison for images that consistently the same size, you can skip image-diff and use pixelmatch which does everything in memory so you won't need to manage files:\nhttps://github.com/mapbox/pixelmatch. 1. No, mkdirp was designed after coreutils' mkdir which won't error out on mkdir -p:\n    - https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp/blob/0.5.1/index.js#L27-L52\n    - In the case a directory already exists, Node.js would callback with the error code EEXIST (which means the file/folder already exists). mkdirp jumps to its default error case which verifies it is in fact a directory (which is it) and calls back with no error\n2/3. Okay, sounds good :+1: . I think we can close this issue due to inactivity. I'm down for supporting this but it seems strange there is no environment variable to do that (e.g. libraries will often allow PHANTOMJS_BIN or similar to specify the executable path). I'm going to open an issue on gm to see if we can add that support so all dependent libraries don't need to support passing in appPath. Ah, good eye. I'm sure we can replace that with gm's _exec or _spawn when the upstream issue is settled and we upgrade for support\nhttps://github.com/aheckmann/gm/blob/1.23.0/lib/command.js#L180-L208. I appreciate the consideration but it's an unnecessary change. We should only make such updates when the entire repo is on ES6. Unfortunately, that's far down on my priorities list due to everything working fine as is =/. Great, thanks @mlmorg. I've opened #56 to complete the README updates for GitHub and npm. This library is no longer supported. Please see the following alternatives:\n\nhttps://github.com/gemini-testing/looks-same\nhttps://github.com/mapbox/pixelmatch. This project is no longer supported.
