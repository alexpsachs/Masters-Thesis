    "natecavanaugh": "Heya Aaron, please send the pull request to me :)\n. Hi there,\nSorry for the delay in getting back to you, but if you take a look at: https://github.com/liferay/alloy-ui/blob/master/demos/io-request/index.html#L104\nYou can see how you would pass in the parameter.\nUnfortunately, the YUI option only accepts either a string ID or a raw element (so nodes or selectors don't work). I agree that this is a weird part of their API considering everything else works with selectors and nodes.\nIf you already have the element as a node (for instance, in your case above, you should be able to do: id: my_form.getDOM().\nAdding it as an example is a great idea.\nThanks!\n. Hi Jeroen,\nI'm not sure why you can't do a checkout. That is quite strange.\nHowever, if you don't care about having all of the history, you can do:\ngit clone --depth 1 git://github.com/liferay/alloy-ui.git\nYou can change depth to being whatever you want it to be (the higher the entry, the more commit entries you'll get).\nWe have done aggressive garbage collection, but that actually won't fix anything, since garbage collection runs locally.\nThe problem/benefit with git is that the repo size is because of the history of everything that was ever committed.\nThis repo used to be on Subversion, and since we didn't have git modules, we stored YUI as a zip in the repo (with a build task to extract it properly).\nBut in addition to that, we also have other large binaries that have been committed at one time or another. These all exist in the history.\nWe're currently looking at ways to remedy this, but whichever path we take will require deleting some history, which will cause some problems for people who already have the repo cloned. Basically, we're trying to find a way to minimize those problems, and reduce the repo size down to a manageable level.\nI hope that helps give some context :)\nThanks Jeroen\n. Hey Zeno,\nCan you give me an example? This sort of thing could be fixable right now\nif you want to shoot a pull request (but let me know which ones you mean\nand I'll see if I can help you remove them).\nThanks,\nNate Cavanaugh\nDirector of UI Engineering\nLiferay, Inc.\nEnterprise.

Hey guys,\nRegarding the https, it's not as simple as purchasing the certificate for alloyui.com. The reason is because the CDN is what serves the content, so the cert has to be stored and served by the CDN.\nThe cost for doing this is considerably more than $60 dollars a year. We're currently in the process of setting up a global domain for all Liferay properties to be able to access it, but it won't be the same domain.\nIt may be similar, but probably won't be able to just have a protocol-less url (which might be better... the protocol-less method doesn't work if you copy/paste it into a file that you're testing with running from your local file system).\n\nAbout the combo handler, we've discussed having it on a node js instance before, but there's little value at this point. We'd have to create another server to just run node js for the combo handler, as well as write this combo handler (and debug any potential issues).\nWe already have one that runs in PHP, we've been using it for years and unless we can have some sort of quantifiable reason to change, it would simply be a distraction.\n@jonathantneal about why it's not a \"plugin\" is that it needs to concatenate the files on the server-side to return all requested modules in one http request.\nIn Liferay, our combo handler is in Java, but Eduardo also wrote one in PHP to run from a host that only has PHP (which is far more common).\nI believe people have written other ports for it in other languages, but not sure.\n. We're getting SSL support for the CDN, but it just won't be under the same\ndomain. I'm not sure what it will be quite yet, but as soon as I know, I'll\nupdate the ticket.\nNate Cavanaugh\nDirector of UI Engineering\nLiferay, Inc.\nEnterprise. Open Source.

Hi there,\nWe'll be notifying everyone officially shortly, but we do now have https setup for the cdn, though it requires a different domain (one that's shared for all Liferay properties).\n\nThe URL to access it is: https://cdn.lfrs.sl/alloyui.com/2.0.0pr6/aui/aui-min.js (you can replace the 2.0.0pr6 with the appropriate version).\nOr, to access any file from our cdn via https, you would just replace this:\nhttp://cdn.alloyui.com/\nwith:\nhttps://cdn.lfrs.sl/alloyui.com/\nI'll close this one out, but we'll make sure to update the website to share this data.\nThanks!\n.

Next time, keep in mind that issues should be posted on Jira instead of GitHub :)\nhttps://github.com/liferay/alloy-ui/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#1-issues\n. Hi @pkvn, thanks again for reporting this. I've just created an issue on Jira and we'll be fixing it soon: https://issues.liferay.com/browse/AUI-1605.\n. Next time, keep in mind that issues should be posted on Jira instead of GitHub :)\nhttps://github.com/liferay/alloy-ui/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#1-issues\n. Hi @mese79, sorry for the delay here. We haven't been looking at github tickets, since we've started using Jira for tracking issues instead. \nNot sure if you still need this information but, in case you do, you just need to set the activeCoord datatable attribute to change the active record (something like: datatable.set('activeCoord', [1, 0]) to select the second row). Same goes when deselecting everything, it can be done via activeCoord as well (something like: datatable.set('activeCoord', [-1, -1]). And finally, to get the whole model data from a record you can just use the getAttrs method: record.getAttrs().\n. Next time, keep in mind that issues should be posted on Jira instead of GitHub :)\nhttps://github.com/liferay/alloy-ui/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#1-issues\n. Hi @Divran, thanks for the suggestion. \nI've created an issue on Jira for this, since we're not using github issues anymore (see https://github.com/liferay/alloy-ui/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#1-issues). I'll close this then, but you can take a look at the Jira ticket instead for updates about this: https://issues.liferay.com/browse/AUI-1675.\n. Thanks a lot for reporting these problems. I've opened two separate jira issues for those (https://issues.liferay.com/browse/AUI-1837 and https://issues.liferay.com/browse/AUI-1838).\nNext time, keep in mind that issues should be posted on Jira instead of GitHub :)\nhttps://github.com/liferay/alloy-ui/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#1-issues\nI'll close this since we'll be working on the jira issues instead then. You should be able to access them too if you wish to see the progress or add something.\n. We've just added the distributions files to the most recent version of alloy-ui for bower, so you should be able to use it now. Sorry for the delay on this :)\n. I don't believe there's a way to do this out of the box, but AlloyUI's scheduler allows you to implement your own views and use them, so you could try implementing a new view for it. The only requirement is that it has to extend from SchedulerDayView, so you should take a look at it and see if extending it or one of the other existing views (like SchedulerWeekView, which is the one in the example you showed) can be enough for your purposes. Since the columns won't be dates I'm not sure how easy it will be though.\n. Hi @mbowerman. First of all, thanks for the contribution!\nThe code looks good, but we have some contributing guidelines that need to be followed for a commit to be pushed to liferay/alloy-ui, so let me explain it to you:\n1) The code has some lint errors. Before sending a pr to alloy-ui you should run gulp lint, it will expose those errors so you can fix them.\n2) Pull requests for alloy-ui should be first sent to @thiago-rocha, instead of liferay.\n3) Pull requests should always come with a test for the change it makes. In this case, just add a test case to fix this new feature and run the tests with gulp test to make sure all pass.\n4) Changes should be added to the HISTORY.md file for the changed modules. You basically just need to add one more line to the HISTORY.md file for aui-form-validator with the information about the jira ticket that this pr is for.\nCan you make these changes and then send this again, but this time to @thiago-rocha?\n. Oh, no problem at all. At least I've already gone through some of the contribution guidelines with him. It's great having more people contribute :)\nBy the way, I also don't like the github interface for this, so I'd suggest using Node GH if you like using the terminal. It's pretty simple to install, and to use it you just type gh pr -s thiago-rocha for example, to send the current branch as a pr to a certain user. There are many other features too, and it's supported by some Liferay engineers, so just putting it out here in case you guys didn't know about it.\n. It's true, we're using Jira now, but since this is simple to answer I'll take the chance and explain here.\nThe component is not wrong actually, nor is the demo. The date being passed to the component is in February, not in January. The javascript Date object uses zero indexed numbers for month codes, so January is 0 and February is 1, even though it looks weird. To confirm, just type on your browser's console: new Date(2013, 1, 4, 5).toString(). This will output something like: Mon Feb 04 2013 05:00:00 GMT-0300 (BRT).\n. @blzaugg, it may be a coincidence by I think that this pr somehow caused the jira issues related to the commits to be reopened. I got many emails, and the issues are all from commits in this pr, all being reopened with a message saying that github rejected them. Check out the screenshot:\n\nDo you know what could have caused this?\n. Can you show the code where you're creating the from builder instance? If you add this right after that code it should work.\n. We support multiple older versions of alloy-ui, due to projects that are still using them. When starting a new project I'd recommend using the latest regular version, 3.1.0, which is the latest in npm. Let me know if that helped.. ",

Dear @jawedkhan,\nthis isn't the appropriate channel for this kind of question.\nI recommend you use www.stackoverflow.com to search for that. Also, try hard not to ask it there as many people already did so it's easier for everyone if you just google for an answer. Find an answer there instead and try to compose the crucial parts to this question on your mind instead parts (for what I see it can be divided in two questions: 1) how to store data using MySQL using PHP, 2) how to send the scheduler data to the server).\n. I've checked once again and it seems fine.
