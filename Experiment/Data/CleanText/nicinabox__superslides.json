    "nicinabox": "MIT License. Updating readme now.\n. There is currently an event after slide (slides.animated) that you can bind to.\n$('body').on('slides.animated', function() {\n  console.log('slide animated')\n}\nI could add an additional event before animation begins as well.\n. Woohoo! :)\n. - What is your Chrome version?\n- Do you see this happening on the demo, or in your own code?\n- Is it more of a flicker with the images (kind of patchy?) or more of a stutter?\n. Are you using the jquery animate plugin with it?\n. Hmm, is your code public somewhere I could take a look at it?\n. ~~Are you using background-size in your css?~~\nSorry, I misread that. You aren't using a background image. If you move the image out of it's div, does that fix the issue?\n. There is a set of required css which includes the backface and interpolation rules. This ticket is a little old, but @steveh14, did you solve this, and are use using that css that is provided in the documentation?\n. Okay, awesome :)\n. Ah yes, it should be a little more graceful when only a single slide exists. I'll mark it as a bug for now and try to look at it this week.\n. I think this should work. Try out the file from the dev branch. https://github.com/nicinabox/superslides/blob/d30799756316f40f30b42c8e38c28b58635db823/build/jquery.superslides.js\n. Ah crap yeah. I didn't catch it on my small screen\n. Okay, try the most recent on the dev branch now. Should work.\n. Ah ha! It was a (separate) issue with image size calculation. It should now center in all directions correctly.\n. Thanks for your diligence in checking my work :)\n. I'm going to add an update method in 0.4.1 that will allow Ajax functionality. \n. You can can now append slides through the API:\n$('#slides').superslides('append', $jqueryObj)\n. Update: 0.5.0 will include a destroy method.\n. Pagination is a feature I started on, but never finished. I'll try adding this before the end of the week. \n. No changes yet. Been wrapping up other projects to swing around to this. I haven't forgotten about it :)\n. I now remember why I stalled on this originally. This requires exposing a public api that can be used like $el.superslides('animate', 'next'). That, in turn, requires reworking the quite a bit to create this sort of api. I'm in process on it and shooting for and update late weekend.\n. If you're really itching to test it out, there's some new code on the dev branch that includes api methods.\nAvailable methods are:\n- start\n- stop\n- play\n- animate\n- next\n- prev\nExample usage:\n$el.superslides('animate', 'next')\n$el.superslides('animate', 3)\n$el.superslides('stop')\n...\nMore documentation when more is fleshed out.\n. 0.4 is released with support for pagination and hashchange. Check the updated documentation for more info. Enjoy!\n. Thanks @iveenano. This code doesn't belong in the plugin, however. If you want to add touch support like this, add it to your app with superslides included before it.\n. Confirmed. Seeing it on FF 14.0.1 on OSX as well.\n. ~~This seems to be related to jQuery 1.8~~, but I'm looking for a workaround.\nActually related to jQuery Animate Enhanced plugin. https://github.com/benbarnett/jQuery-Animate-Enhanced/issues/94\n. Plugin has been fixed.\n. Currently it doesn't support ajax loading or appending items. I've had a few requests for this now, so I'm thinking it's something I should add in the next version.\n. Ahh. When you load your page, initialize the slider at the same time.\n. That seems like it should work. I'll dig into it in a few hours when I get home.\n. That will be very helpful!\n. I made up a testbed with the bits you posted above. It loads correctly for me. It's possible you have some other code interfering. If you could post up a more demo somewhere that replicates your problem, I'll have a look at it.\n. Currently, no. But it would be easy to add support for that.\n. 0.6.0 let's you add custom animations effects. Refer to examples for adding your own.\n. In short, sort of. \nAfter each animation an event is triggered: slides.animated. This even carries 3 variables: the current slide, the next slide, and the previous slide.\nTry something like this:\n$(document).on('slides.animated', function(current, next, prev) {\n  if (slides.length === prev) {\n    // last slide\n  }\n})\n. Probably around where you call superslides. \n. Could you share your code? It will be helpful with debugging.\n. This is actually not an issue with Superslides. You're using position: fixed on your content. It's very interesting that this works in Chrome, because fixed position removes an element from the document flow. It's parent has overflow:hidden and this shouldn't change how the fix position element is shown.\nMy suggestion is to change your quote css to position: absolute.\n.contain-quote {\n  position: absolute;\n}\n. Excellent!\n. I've noticed this bug as well. It's a little tricky to reproduce because it doesn't happen when you resize the browser--they stay centered. Only on mobile devices does it seem to occur like this and I'm not sure why.\n. This has now been fixed in the dev branch.\n. Play is off by default. All configurable options are listed in the readme. Are you using the latest version (0.4.2)?\n. play: false is the default option. Let me know if you are having issues without specifying anything.\n. Thanks for the compliments :)\nHistorically I've referred users to to Backstretch for fullscreen fade, but it doen't handle additional blocks of content inside each \"slide\". Maybe it's time to add some new animation effects.\n. In 0.5.0 I'm adding an animation engine that will hand different effects such as this and vertical sliding as in #10. This is in the works now.\n. Thank you. Unfortunately I didn't have enough time to get the new effects in with the release today. I've setup the code for it though, and it's the next thing I'm working on. Assuming there are no other critical bugs, it should be in the next version. \n. Added in 0.6.0. Currently on master.\n. Firefox is on the rapid release cycle now and is currently at 16.0. It's difficult not to update at this point. Supporting six versions back probably isn't going to happen. Sorry.\n. Hmm, yeah I hadn't considered this use case. Is the gallery something that initializes when you click on it or something?\n. Perfect. I'll try to work on a solution for multiple instances this weekend.\n. Damn clients :P\n. I looked into adding this quickly to the next release, but it's trickier than I thought. I've scheduled it for 0.5.0, which is in the works now.\n. Multiple instances are now supported in 0.5.0. Shooting to release officially in the next few days. If you'd like, grab the code from 0.5-wip and try it out.\n. Discussion: http://nicinabox.com/blog/superslides-0-dot-4-1-released/\n. Aw crap. Looks like this is back again after a refactor.\n. I'm glad you brought it up :)\nI'll try to release 0.4.3 as a hotfix this evening. As it's coming up on the holiday it's unlikely I'll get another chance until the weekend I think.\n. I've got it, but I've got to commit and push it. Give me about 30 min\n. Okay! Sorry for the delay.\nThis is fixed in the dev branch. I'm not quite ready to release 0.4.3, but dev is nearly there. It has the fix you need.\n. Can you confirm that you are using 1.4.3 from dev branch? Also, if you look at the demo in dev with a single slide, do you see the same results?\n. It happens! Just needed to make sure it wasn't something on my side.\n. 0.5.0 will have the proper fix for this. \n. Yes, you can add .keep-original to any images that you don't want to be resized.\n. Yes, it's a class on the img. In 0.5.0 this was changed to preserve. \n<img class=\"preserve\" />\n. I'll make it configurable!\n. Firefox 12 is 5 versions old now. Testing that is going to be low on the priority list.\nBut could you give more info about what IE you saw issues with?\n. Ah, I know what this is. There's some odd issue between jQuery 1.8 and jQuery Animate Enhanced <0.99. The issue does not occur with jQuery 1.7. This has been an issue in the past (#7). Updating jQuery Animate Enhanced in the demo seems to fix the issue. \nI did note some downgraded performance in FF 12 with the jQuery Animate Enhanced plugin. Your milage may vary.\nIf you still see issues with IE, open an issue for those. Thanks for bringing this up!\n. Awesome, I'd love to see it!\n. I believe this has to do with the backface visibility property. It's so inconsistent across browsers :(\nThe video is helpful, thank you. \n. Good news, this has already been fixed in 0.4.3. It's in the dev branch if you want to grab it from there.\n. It's an issue with -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden. It should be fixed in 1.4.3, however.\n. Do you have any code you could share with me to help debug this setup?\n. Thanks! That is strange indeed. I'll look at this today.\n. Trying to debug this, but I have some questions about your code. What's the purpose of 'bigBox' any why is #slides fixed position?\n. Oh, hmm. There's an option for letting content scroll, but keeps the image in place. It wraps the content in .scrollable with overflow-y: auto. Would that solve your problem?\n. Closing this since there's been no activity in a month. New demo uses a fixed position technique and seems to work well.\n. That is correct. Pagination is updated on the slides.animated event.\nThis event happens after animation finishes (that's why it's past tense). This is by design. There is no event for \"before animate\". \nPerhaps you could give a use case for \"before animate\"?\n. It's in your paste after if (options.pagination). Each pagination item is added on the slides.initialized event.\n. Right. Because your animate event fires before the initialization event, the pagination items haven't even been added to the page yet. \n. Sorry, I'm a little confused at why you need to change all the internals. The point of using an event is so that you can hook into it outside of the plugin code. \nIf you remove internals that depend on events to initialize properly, you're gonna have a bad time. Why not just add the slides.animate event before animation occurs, then listen for that event in your application?\n. Ah I see. You're just wanting to change the functionality so have the active state on before animate. \nAbstract the the pagination code into a method an call it from both slides.initialized and slides.animate\njavascript\nvar updatePagination = function() {\n  var $pagination;\n  $pagination = $(\".slides-pagination\");\n  $(\".active\", $pagination).removeClass(\"active\");\n  return $(\"a\", $pagination).eq(current).addClass(\"active\");\n};\n``` javascript\n$window.on(\"slides.initialized\", function(e) {\n  $(_this).append($(\"\", {\n    \"class\": 'slides-pagination'\n  }));\n  return $children.each(function(i) {\n    return addPaginationItem(i);\n  });\n  updatePagination();\n}).on(\"slides.animate\", function(e, current, next, prev) { \n  updatePagination()\n})\n```\n. Great! I'm going to close this then if it's resolved. Feel free to open an issue if you find problems with the production code.\n. 0.5.0 will have the pagination updating before animation.\n. Good point. Would you like to send a pull request?\n. Fixed in 0.5.0\n. Ah, interesting. Yes. The reason is that the url still has that hash, so when you click on that item again, it still things it's on #2 according to the url. Definitely a bug. Nice catch.\n. This is already being reworked in the 0.5-wip branch. I'll take care of this bug there.\n. Fixed in 0.5. Shooting to release this weekend.\n. I ended up manually doing this on 0.5-wip https://github.com/nicinabox/superslides/blob/0.5-wip/scss/superslides.scss#L64\n. Thanks @AdRulz!\n. I was reading more about this. Apparently multiple hashes is not a valid URL. Plus, I can't reliably pull the slide number out of a URL with multiple hashes, so I opted not to include it in 0.5.0.\nCan you give a use case for this? Perhaps there's another way to go about it. \n. To be honest, no testing has been done in Opera. It hasn't been a priority since their browser share is just over 1% worldwide. Maybe we can change that in 0.5\n. Just checked 0.5.0-wip in Opera. Working great with the exception of some minor performance issues :)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/5l0c0.jpg\n. I'm shooting to release this weekend. Hopefully no later than Monday. I think it should be stable enough for testing if you want to try it out (0.5-wip branch). Be sure to read over the new docs, some things have changed.\n. This may have been an issue at one point, but I don't think it is anymore. IE7+ behaves consistent with other browsers  now.\n. Can you tell me if you still see this issue with 0.5.0?\n. I haven't been able to duplicate this and it's been a month with no activity. Feel free to reopen if this is still an issue.\n. I added an example for this in 0.6.0-beta2, but I'm not seeing flicker in Safari 6.\n. Ahhh, Thanks. I see that; definitely a bug.\n. Fixed in 0.5-stable branch.\n. I need to make the docs more clear :(. Use an integer for milliseconds: play: 5000\n. Good question. Images are set so the min-width is 100% of the image size. In other words, the image will not scale smaller than it's natural dimensions. It's never really come up before and the images that I've always used have been ~1000px sized for the web. \nMaybe it would be good to have a configurable option for this.\n. I'll have a look this morning. \n. Currently in progress on this.\n. @markyuk if all your images are larger than the viewport, yes that will work. min-height is already set on the image. You'd need to remove min-width and replace with max-width.\n. Yeah I see that. Bummer, I thought that might work. I'm adding some checks now to better scale the image.\n. I think I've got it working :)\n. @markyuk, @randalldon Can you grab the code from master branch to test for me?\n. Sweet, thanks! You'll probably want to compare what's in dist/ to what you've got. More than likely you'll just want to grab the javascript file.\nAlso just fixed #38 and #40. \n. And thank you for your feedback :)\n. I'm not seeing any issues with IE 7 or 8 as far as image resizing goes. IE7 seems to not want to cycle through the slides though, at least in the demo.\n. The marketing demo.\n. DOH! Right, scatterbrained this morning; will check again.\n. This is very helpful, thanks!\n. I haven't yet had time in my production schedule. I only have access to a windows machine at work, so I have to work it in sometime during the workday (maybe today!).\n. You're not a pain! I appreciate the follow ups. I promise, I haven't forgotten about you :). Unfortunately, I've been on a rather tight production schedule last week and this week. That said, I don't think it will be difficult to fix, just need some time to sit down and thoroughly test.\n. @randalldon working on it today!\n. @randalldon If you don't mind testing this out for me... Grab the latest from 0.5-stable and see if it fixes your problem.\n. That seems different that what you experienced before? Not loading at all though, that's odd. I'll try with a bigger image. \n. Hm, just tried with an image at 2048x1420 and seemed to perform as expected. My viewport is 1024x768 (virtual machine). Even the 'people.jpg' is larger, and it seems to work as you reported. \nAre you sure it's not an isolated case with the image you tried to load?\n. Yep, 0.5-stable. Can you give me more info about your machine?\n\u2014\n@nicinabox\nOn Thu, Mar 7, 2013 at 3:52 AM, randalldon notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nHi There,\nThanks for coming back to me. I've tried with several images with the same result. Teh images worked in all browsers other than these ie versions. Can you confirm which version of Superslides has these fixes. If i pull down the stable version is that the one you're using to test?\nMany thanks\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/nicinabox/superslides/issues/36#issuecomment-14551089\n. Just tried on IE8 native and still not seeing it.\n\n\n\n\n. I removed it because it felt it was too fine grained and I wanted to simplify the API. What are you trying to do? There is probably another even you can hook on to. \nsize returns the length of the slides. \n. I'm closing this issue now since there's been no activity.\n. Try grabbing the 0.5.1 release. I'm not seeing the behavior in the demo, so that might fix it for you.\n. Ahh, I see this in the demo now. Can't go directly to the last slide for some reason.\n. Fixed in 0.5.2 to be released today.\n. Unfortunately my production schedule has been too tight recently to address some of these issues. I'm hoping to get back at it this week.\nBut about Opera...it does work in Opera 12.12 on OSX (http://min.us/lTG7IpeZfjbgH). I wonder what's different about the Windows version.\n. Just tested on Opera 12.12 on Windows 7 (http://minus.com/lbsZfcUidfFGPr) and it seems to work fine there as well.\nWhat is \"12.50 internal\"?\n. Feel free to reopen (or I can) if there is an issue :)\n. Yes, that should definitely be using the class instead of first-child. Good catch. \n. Fixed in the next release (0.5.2)\n. Hm, it's designed to be fullscreen, edge to edge. Currently, just attaching it to a block element with it's own width constraint is not supported.\n. See #15 \n. Sorry, I need to clear up some confusion in the option and documentation. Use the delay as the value: play: 5000\n. Hmm, the code says otherwise: https://github.com/nicinabox/superslides/blob/0.6-stable/src/core_prototype.js#L122-L130\nplay is a delay interval. As in \"Play and move every n seconds\". \nAnimation speed is controlled with a separate option (animation_speed, conveniently): https://github.com/nicinabox/superslides/blob/0.6-stable/src/fx.js#L14\n. Ha, glad you got it worked out :)\n. Glad you got it. I'd like to setup a proper, formatted documentation page soon. It's definitely lacking a bit.\n. Sure! You'd need to write your own code for this, but it's very possible through the API. The basic process would be:\n- Listen for the animated.slides event\n- Check if the current slide is equal to the size\n- Call stop\n. Not yet! Aside from bugfixes, it's the next major feature on the list.\n. Thanks!\nIt just needs a little setup first. I have an idea of how I want to do it, just need to put down some groundwork so animations can be extended easily.\n. Thanks for the compliments @christian70. Rebuilding the animation aspect is one of my top priorities for this project. I just need to find a weekend to do it :/\n. I have an update!\nI am edging ever closer to releasing 0.6.0 with slide and fade as well as the ability to add custom animations. It's going to be on a production site next week, so keep a look out shortly after that. Check out the master branch demos for an peek.\n. @matthewcarleton Fade is working, but I need to bring a few other features back in. Check master branch examples for features you might want.\n. Grab 0.6.0 beta from master if you want to use fade. I'm using it in a couple production sites currently.\n. Thanks for the heads up on that typo.\nscrollable allows for scrollable content inside a slide. Check the demo for an example of how to structure that markup.\n. Just pushed a fix to 0.5-stable branch. See if that works for you. \nGood looking site, btw :)\n. @jakubbaranski grab the code from the 0.5-stable branch. It has the fix you're looking for.\n. Use the animated.slides event to play/pause the video (using Vimeo's API)\n. Probably something along these lines.\n``` javascript\n$(window).load(function(){\n  var $slides = $('#slides');\n// Vimeo API\n  var player = document.getElementById('player_1');\n  $f(player).addEvent('ready', ready);\nfunction addEvent(element, eventName, callback) {\n    if (element.addEventListener) {\n      element.addEventListener(eventName, callback, false)\n    } else {\n      element.attachEvent(eventName, callback, false);\n    }\n  }\nfunction ready(player_id) {\n    var froogaloop = $f(player_id);\n    froogaloop.addEvent('play', function(data) {\n      $slides.superslides('stop');\n    });\n    froogaloop.addEvent('pause', function(data) {\n      $slides.superslides('start');\n    });\n  }\n// Pause video when slides animate\n  $slides.on('animated.slides', function() {\n    $f(player).api('pause');\n  })\n// Initialize slider\n  $slides.superslides();\n});\n```\n. I'm not familiar with froogaloop or the Vimeo API. Above is basically the code from flexslider with the superslides api swapped out. \n. I know that feel bro.\nI'm addressing it this week with some other issues. Feel free to send a PR if you like, it's not a hard problem to fix.\n. Fixed in 0.6.0. Currently on master.\n. Not at this time. It fills 100% width and height. \nI've considered changing things in the future to allow it to be inherit it's size from a predefined element, not necessarily the window.\n. This is not an issue with Superslides.\nI'd recommend listening for the hashchange event and setting your navigation active state that way.\n. Not likely, but please provide a use case.\n. When you say \"animate the caption\", what do you mean exactly?\n. Superslides doesn't really work in this way. You could listen on the animated event to change the content below the slider. \n. Listen for the event animated.slides. \n. I have noticed this as well. I'm porting to JavaScript from Coffeescript and plan on addressing it during that. Any help is super appreciated though. I'd definitely merge a pull request that fixes the issue :)\n. @frodoschering What version are you using?\n. What's the css for your navigation?\n0.6.1 should definitely work. \n\n. How interesting. I would not expect that to have any impact on their display. \n. I think I can make this happen.\n. Hey, you're in luck! 0.6.0-beta2 already works this way. Check out the Play example on master.\n. Ahh my mistake. That was a false positive. Look for 6.0.1 today.\n. 0.6.1 is out with this fix.\n. I imagine this could easily be added through a data-hash attribute or something.\n. Added to 0.6.0.\n. Hm, that definitely shouldn't be happening, regardless of settings. Are you using 0.5.2?\n. Use jQuery to append the html inside the container then run the .superslides('update') method to let Superslides know the size has changed. That should work just fine.\n. Hmm, can you post an actual sample of the html you're adding?\n. Blerg, I see it. I think it should be calling adjustSlidesSize, on update, but alas, it isn't :(\n. Sure, if you're just wanting to make your local copy work, try adding to the this.update method at the beginning:\njavascript\nadjustSlidesSize(this.$el);\n. Right after this line: https://github.com/nicinabox/superslides/blob/0.5-stable/dist/jquery.superslides.js#L364\nI'm mostly speculating here. I haven't tested it, but I think that should work. The problem is that it's not recalculating the new slide positions.\n. Yeah I see that. Some issues here ;(\n. Oops, try this instead (same line): adjustSlidesSize($children);\n. I need to sit down with it then. I'll try to get it corrected this evening. Sorry man.\n. @shootingrubber Grab the code from the 0.5-stable branch now. It should fix this issue.\n. I see it happening. The images appear to be loaded.\n. Try from 0.5-stable again. I think the images just needed CSS.\n. Superb! \n. You won't be able to get 1:1 swiping easily, but you can trigger the animation on swipe. Use your favorite swipe detection library.\n. I've been using Hammer.js a lot recently to do touch swiping\n``` javascript\n  document.ontouchmove = function(e) {\n    e.preventDefault();\n  };\n  $('#slides').hammer().on('swipeleft', function() {\n    $(this).superslides('animate', 'next');\n  });\n$('#slides').hammer().on('swiperight', function() {\n    $(this).superslides('animate', 'prev');\n  });\n```\n. You'll need to size the image accordingly. The window size changes how the image is positioned and zoomed. I would recommend not trying to position to an exact pixel area, but rather allow flexibility in your design. Your users will not be using an ideal window size most likely.\n. No, it's fullscreen in both directions.\n. Fixed in 0.6.0-beta2\n. There might be a double image load going on. That could be affecting your performance.\n. Open web inspector and watch network requests as the page loads. Compare to the demo. It has pretty good performance.\n. Let's figure out what's actually happening first, then we can address the problem as it exists.\n. Nailed it. What version of superslides are you using?\n. Try 0.5.2 and see if that changes anything.\n. Hmm, you could try optimizing the images further. 150k each is pretty decent I'd say. Not sure what your hosting environment is like. How does it compare against the demo> I'm seeing about 1.1s on load and those images are in the 200-400 range.\n. Might also be helpful to watch the timeline to see what's getting hung up. Are you waiting for dependencies or libs or anything?\n. Is there something I could view?\n. Here's what I see:\n33 of 51 requests are images\n1.6 of 1.9 MB are images\nThe biggest hangups I see are images coming from Shopify (newroll_x.jpg) in which they are blocked from downloading until other things complete. You're losing almost a full second right there.\n. Also, you may not be the only one experiencing this.\n. I'm not super familiar with Shopify's environment though. You might try testing a few different things. You could try removing the slider then check the load. Or maybe try ajax loading parts of it alleviate the initial load. It it is truly an issue with their CDN, you'd need to look at some additional techniques or revising your design to work around these constraints.\n. Double load fixed in 0.6.0\n. I'll need to do some additional testing on iPad. Pull requests always welcome.\n. Image position has been reworked to function like background-size: cover. This will be released in 0.6.0, currently on master.\n. Don't use the built in pagination. Just create your own links and go to a slide when you click on them. \n. It really is. Use the href to go link to a slide. \n. See there!\n. Something like this. All of this is documented in the API.\njavascript\n$('#slides').on('animated.slides', function() { \n  var current_index = $(this).superslides('current');\n  $('.navigation li').removeClass('current');\n  $('.navigation li').eq(current_index).addClass('current');\n});\n. Sure, set play: 4000 in the options.\n. Thank you @amongiants, this is great! I could merge this in if you just commit the js parts separately (I don't want to pull in your readme or images, per se).\n. This looks great! I'm going to review it thoroughly this afternoon.\n. @amongiants Sorry, I still haven't had time to review this and I'm out of town this weekend. I haven't forgotten about it, just TONS going on. Promise to get back to this.\n. @amongiants Your commits seem to be gone?\n. Okay, before you do that, 0.6.0 on master is the latest code and will be released next week. It's a full port from coffeescript back to vanilla js. If you don't add it by next week, I probably will. \n. I just added it. Gets picked up automatically, no need for configuration.\n. This is fixed in 0.6.0-beta2.\n. Unfortunately I've had compatibility issues with jQuery 1.9 and haven't had time to address them. I recommend using 1.8 for the time being.\n. 0.6.0 is compatible with jQuery 1.9.\n. The latest tagged version should work fine with a single slide. But if you're just wanting a single full screen image, you don't need the overhead that this javascript provides. You can do that with just CSS.\n. Sounds like you got it under control then :)\n. Could you repost your images?\n. Great! I was only able to look at it briefly. Another possible solution: move the logo outside of the slides wrapper.\n. Definitely the top requested feature. I've started on an fx engine to make fade and other custom animations possible, but it's still in the works.\n. Thanks @nimr this is very helpful. I wish I had an Android device to test with. Maybe a friend can loan me one.\n. Custom pagination is not supported out of the box. You'll need you write your own logic for setting the state on each pagination if you opt not to use the built in one.\n. What version are you using?\n. Pagination is appended during initialization. Try setting it to display: none in your css first, then fading in after it's initialized.\n. Duplicate of #90 \n. Yes, listen for mouseover and mouseout events then stop/start the slides with the API. Easy peasy. \n. javascript\n$('#slides').on('mouseenter', function() {\n  $(this).superslides('stop');\n});\n$('#slides').on('mouseleave', function() {\n  $(this).superslides('start');\n});\n. Huh, I wonder if we aren't getting each others emails. I did get an email from you about 6 hours ago.\n. This is fixed in 0.6.0-beta2\n. play: 5000 or use false to not play.\n. Try with the latest release of 0.6. This should definitely work. You'll want to load in markup that matches your existing slides (so if you're using li's, be sure that's part of what you load).\n. The 0.6.0 beta has fade. You can get it from master branch.\n. I don't see anything wrong with that bit of code. Could you link to your source?\n. No that should work fine. It would be helpful to see your code for debugging though. \n. Yeah, order definitely matters. Include dependencies before you use them!\nThis doesn't seem like an issue with the plugin so I'm closing for now.\n. Agreed. Let's make this happen.\n. This is now a part of 0.6. Cheers!\n. Yes, I updated the readme. Bind to it the same as other events (the event is animating.slides)\n. Beta software. Things might not work as expected :P\nYou can still get the current by doing something like $('#slides').data('superslides').current\n. Remember, this is before animating, so current,  next, and prev will not have been updated yet. What is your expectation for what current should be? The outgoing slide, or the upcoming slide?\n. Okay, I haven't tested this, but it should work. I moved the event trigger down a bit and passed in the orientation hash. On your listener, do this and see if you get some values you need (grab the latest off master):\njavascript\n$(document).on('animating.slides', function(e, orientation) {\n  console.log(orientation)\n});\n. Killer\n. update is a synchronous method, so a callback is unnecessary. If there is an issue going to the next slide after update, then that should be addressed.\n. Cool, I'll have a look at, thanks.\n. Working on this now.\n. This is now fixed in 0.6.0-beta2 (on master).\n. Hmm what browser?\n. Here's what I'm doing to add a slide and I'm not seeing any weirdness:\njavascript\n$('#slides .slides-container').append('<img src=\"//lorempixel.com/1000/1000\" />'); \n$('#slides').superslides('update');\nAs soon as I add animate into the mix I see the new slide as blank. It looks like the image hasn't yet loaded. What if you setTimeout for 500ms?\n. Can you give an example of this?\n. This is a side effect of images not being fully loaded. \nPreviously on 0.6.0 you needed to call superslides after onload instead of onready to get around this. A few days ago I fixed it so you can use onready :)\n. Whoa thanks!\n. Fixed in 0.6.2.\n. No, but you could easily add this to your project using the API and setInterval. \n. Hmm, it definitely works in all those browsers. Are you using an element with an id of slides?\nThere is a error in the documentation I need to fix: .superslides('prev') does not move the slider. Instead it returns the index of the previous slide.\n. Great! Closing this then.\n. Hm, I believe that would fit in with this projects goals. What about video cropping?\n. You need to hide or remove it after initialization:\njavascript\n  $(document).on('init.slides', function() {\n    $('.loading-container').fadeOut(function() {\n      $(this).remove();\n    });\n  });\n. The files come from github so they should definitely work. If you're having trouble with it you could just grab the files in the dist directory. \n. Have you tried using .preserve on the images you don't want resized?\n. I don't think I quite follow what you're doing. Could you make a jsfiddle with a simple test?\n. Have you tried using a delegated event binding?\njavascript\n$(document).on('click', '.showButton', function() {\n  // show box\n});\n. You could use text-indent to hide the text. \n. You can try the old text-indent: -9999px trick :P\n. Hmm, what browser? And are you seeing any js errors?\n. Ahh, sorry, yes I see it now.\n. @fabyeah just pushed a fix to 0.6-stable. Wanna test it out?\n. Ah, got it, thanks. Fix on 0.6-stable.\n. Ah this is a bug. The timer should reset after any user action. \n. Oh sorry, I didn't realize you were using custom navigation. You just need to call stop before animate.\njavascript\n$('#slides').superslides('stop');\n. Yes, check the demo and examples directory. \n. Are you using 0.6.2?\n. Images with .preserve are mostly ignored. There is no letterboxing in the plugin. \n. Use css\n. inherit_height_from should be an element selector.\n. https://github.com/nicinabox/superslides/blob/0.6-stable/examples/constrained.html\n. Hmm, I haven't tested this against Zepto. It could probably be made compatible, but I'd wager right now Zepto won't work with it.\n. inherit_height_from should be a CSS selector string. \ninherit_height_from: '#slider_wrap'\n. Maybe you have a js error?\n. I think I would need to see it to tell you more. You haven't put .preserve on the background images?\n. You're missing position: relative on your .container.\n. ~~Add a zindex so it comes out above the image.~~ NVM.\nThis might have something to do with -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; :/\n. Upon more testing -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; seems to be the culprit. You can override this for now in css with !important.\n. Cool :) Need to get that fixed.\n. Back to #141 for this. We don't need 3 topics for the same issue ;)\n. Perhaps -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;? You may need to override in your css.\n. Can you share your code?\n. Sure, just use the API to determine when you're on the last slide, then change the href of that next link.\n. Sorry it's not possible to initialize on a particular slide except for in the url (blah#2).\nCustomize your hashes by giving ids to your slides.\n. Just call hide or remove on that element?\n. Use the API events to control effects on content. \n. pagination: false\n. Superslides is known to have issues with the default android browser :(\n. .preserve is intended to be used in content areas where you may have a headshot or icon or something like that. It's not for the background slides.\nImages stretch to fit the window using the math behind background-size: cover. Obviously if you have a tall image and you put it in a wide viewport, there will be space on the sides. Those empty sized need be be covered, and the only way to do that is by \"zooming\" the image. Otherwise you end up with a squished image and that's no good. \nSuperslides doesn't do letterboxing. I recommend using images that are similar to the viewport size.\n. How is this different from setting a min width in a media query?\n. No, sorry. \n. Have you taken into account browser chrome?\n. Sorry, this is not possible. The images would need to be letterboxed in theory. \n. Hmm, it should be resetting...\n. Hmm, this plugin doesn't do \"scrolling\" in the classic sense. section tags should work fine providing you follow the parent-child structure like a ul. \n. Listen for animate, check the slide index against 0 or the slides length. \n. This is normal. There is a 200ms delay on the resize even to avoid excessive repaints. Js based resizing will never match the performance of the equivalent CSS. \n. #45 and #173 are what you're looking for.\n. Confirmed. This is a bug. Would welcome a PR to fix it. \n. Thanks @ergec! I don't have time to test this right now, but if you were to make a jsfiddle or something demonstrating it works, I'll be happy to merge it in asap.\n. It should work. We had used it on production sites and our QA wouldn't have let that fly. \n. It looks okay to me in Chrome.\n. It sounds like you burned the text into the image. Text should be text on the web, not in an image. \n. No, sorry. Each slide fills the full window. \n. I link this idea. Send a PR!\n. Yep, you destroy the superslides object and take over with your own CSS at a breakpoint.\nOn Fri, Feb 14, 2014 at 2:34 PM, niallthompson notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nYou could use something like https://github.com/WickyNilliams/enquire.js to run the script at a certain breakpoint but I'm not entirely sure how to do it.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/nicinabox/superslides/issues/204#issuecomment-35122097\n. Are you sure? It may not wipe out the inlined css, unfortunately, but it should destroy the attached data. It should be simple enough to loop over the slides and set .attr('style', '').\n. Check if the current slide is equal to length - 1. Change the link attr if it is. \n. Glad you got it resolved\n. Please don't do this. Think of the users!\n. I'd really like to have this functionality scoped to the current slide. \n. Not at this time. The background-size: cover functionality is recreated with JavaScript for compatibility with browsers. Ideally this would simply be a polyfill, but it isn't right now.\n. Use the .preserve class. It's in the documentation.\n. Use the inherit_height_from option. Wrap your slider in another element that has a height. See docs for more info. \n. Add .preserve to the images that aren't backgrounds. \n. <img class=\"preserve\" ... />\n\nThis will prevent superslides from treating it as a background image, so you can style it as you like. \n. Yes, #box cannot have both position:absolute and margin: auto. Either use margins, or use absolute positioning.\n. Because you probably need some relative positioning in order to control the z-index. And that\u2019s fine.   \nOn Friday, April 25, 2014 at 1:34 PM, gustavsson15 wrote:\n\nThank you for the help, didn't got it to work anyway though, if i removed \"position: absolut;\" the box disapeared.

Sure, you can use whatever events you want to trigger slide transitions. Read the docs about the API. \n. Try setting inherit_height_from. Check readme for more info. \n. Sorry, it's not possible at this time. I suggest editing your images to include the necessary letterboxing.\n. I think you can turn off hashchange in the options.\n. Yes, there are pre and post animation events you can listen for. Check the readme for more info. \n. Check the examples directory?\u00a0\n\nWhat's obscure about it? Listen to events on the element. All the events are listed there in the readme.\nOn Sun, Oct 26, 2014 at 1:17 PM, Robert Wildling notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nAny chance for a little example? The readme is quite obscure...\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/nicinabox/superslides/issues/279#issuecomment-60526433\n. Unfortunately I'm not near my computer and can't give you an example. This project assumes basic javascript knowledge from the user and is designed as such. The readme is written as a technical document and should be used as a reference.\n\nOn Sun, Oct 26, 2014 at 1:23 PM, Robert Wildling notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nWell, instead of going back and forth in tis conversation, a little example would be the quicker solution, maybe for more people than just me... no offense, but the readme is not really giving too much insight on how to use event callbacks for non-programmers. In case you accept this feedback: the readme could be better (at least point to the proper example)\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/nicinabox/superslides/issues/279#issuecomment-60526594\n. @rowild I appreciate you taking the time to give feedback. I wasn't trying to sound defensive or mean, just matter-of-fact.\nI don't see any reason why the events section cannot quickly show a line like this\n\nThere are in multiple code samples throughout the readme. I'd happily accept a pull request for this change. The only reason it didn't is because it seemed overly verbose. Event listeners like this are an extremely common pattern when using jQuery.\n\n... and reload my site with the fullscreen gallery, the console actually starts with a \"animated.slides\" and continues with a \"init.slides\"...?\n\nYes, this is a little confusing. The same code is used to do the initial alignment as is used for all subsequent alignments. I suggest attaching the animating.slides event in the init.slides callback.\n. That's correct. If you're listening to init, be sure to attach the listener before you initialize the plugin.\n. This would be awesome. Unfortunately superslides was written long before I knew about CommonJS modules and has basically no support for it. Your best bet is to modify it to work for you.\n. I think that's an old jquery thing.\n. Sorry, this is not possible with the current configuration. One duration applies to all slides.\n. MIT License. Updating readme now.\n. There is currently an event after slide (slides.animated) that you can bind to.\n$('body').on('slides.animated', function() {\n  console.log('slide animated')\n}\nI could add an additional event before animation begins as well.\n. Woohoo! :)\n. - What is your Chrome version?\n- Do you see this happening on the demo, or in your own code?\n- Is it more of a flicker with the images (kind of patchy?) or more of a stutter?\n. Are you using the jquery animate plugin with it?\n. Hmm, is your code public somewhere I could take a look at it?\n. ~~Are you using background-size in your css?~~\nSorry, I misread that. You aren't using a background image. If you move the image out of it's div, does that fix the issue?\n. There is a set of required css which includes the backface and interpolation rules. This ticket is a little old, but @steveh14, did you solve this, and are use using that css that is provided in the documentation?\n. Okay, awesome :)\n. Ah yes, it should be a little more graceful when only a single slide exists. I'll mark it as a bug for now and try to look at it this week.\n. I think this should work. Try out the file from the dev branch. https://github.com/nicinabox/superslides/blob/d30799756316f40f30b42c8e38c28b58635db823/build/jquery.superslides.js\n. Ah crap yeah. I didn't catch it on my small screen\n. Okay, try the most recent on the dev branch now. Should work.\n. Ah ha! It was a (separate) issue with image size calculation. It should now center in all directions correctly.\n. Thanks for your diligence in checking my work :)\n. I'm going to add an update method in 0.4.1 that will allow Ajax functionality. \n. You can can now append slides through the API:\n$('#slides').superslides('append', $jqueryObj)\n. Update: 0.5.0 will include a destroy method.\n. Pagination is a feature I started on, but never finished. I'll try adding this before the end of the week. \n. No changes yet. Been wrapping up other projects to swing around to this. I haven't forgotten about it :)\n. I now remember why I stalled on this originally. This requires exposing a public api that can be used like $el.superslides('animate', 'next'). That, in turn, requires reworking the quite a bit to create this sort of api. I'm in process on it and shooting for and update late weekend.\n. If you're really itching to test it out, there's some new code on the dev branch that includes api methods.\nAvailable methods are:\n- start\n- stop\n- play\n- animate\n- next\n- prev\nExample usage:\n$el.superslides('animate', 'next')\n$el.superslides('animate', 3)\n$el.superslides('stop')\n...\nMore documentation when more is fleshed out.\n. 0.4 is released with support for pagination and hashchange. Check the updated documentation for more info. Enjoy!\n. Thanks @iveenano. This code doesn't belong in the plugin, however. If you want to add touch support like this, add it to your app with superslides included before it.\n. Confirmed. Seeing it on FF 14.0.1 on OSX as well.\n. ~~This seems to be related to jQuery 1.8~~, but I'm looking for a workaround.\nActually related to jQuery Animate Enhanced plugin. https://github.com/benbarnett/jQuery-Animate-Enhanced/issues/94\n. Plugin has been fixed.\n. Currently it doesn't support ajax loading or appending items. I've had a few requests for this now, so I'm thinking it's something I should add in the next version.\n. Ahh. When you load your page, initialize the slider at the same time.\n. That seems like it should work. I'll dig into it in a few hours when I get home.\n. That will be very helpful!\n. I made up a testbed with the bits you posted above. It loads correctly for me. It's possible you have some other code interfering. If you could post up a more demo somewhere that replicates your problem, I'll have a look at it.\n. Currently, no. But it would be easy to add support for that.\n. 0.6.0 let's you add custom animations effects. Refer to examples for adding your own.\n. In short, sort of. \nAfter each animation an event is triggered: slides.animated. This even carries 3 variables: the current slide, the next slide, and the previous slide.\nTry something like this:\n$(document).on('slides.animated', function(current, next, prev) {\n  if (slides.length === prev) {\n    // last slide\n  }\n})\n. Probably around where you call superslides. \n. Could you share your code? It will be helpful with debugging.\n. This is actually not an issue with Superslides. You're using position: fixed on your content. It's very interesting that this works in Chrome, because fixed position removes an element from the document flow. It's parent has overflow:hidden and this shouldn't change how the fix position element is shown.\nMy suggestion is to change your quote css to position: absolute.\n.contain-quote {\n  position: absolute;\n}\n. Excellent!\n. I've noticed this bug as well. It's a little tricky to reproduce because it doesn't happen when you resize the browser--they stay centered. Only on mobile devices does it seem to occur like this and I'm not sure why.\n. This has now been fixed in the dev branch.\n. Play is off by default. All configurable options are listed in the readme. Are you using the latest version (0.4.2)?\n. play: false is the default option. Let me know if you are having issues without specifying anything.\n. Thanks for the compliments :)\nHistorically I've referred users to to Backstretch for fullscreen fade, but it doen't handle additional blocks of content inside each \"slide\". Maybe it's time to add some new animation effects.\n. In 0.5.0 I'm adding an animation engine that will hand different effects such as this and vertical sliding as in #10. This is in the works now.\n. Thank you. Unfortunately I didn't have enough time to get the new effects in with the release today. I've setup the code for it though, and it's the next thing I'm working on. Assuming there are no other critical bugs, it should be in the next version. \n. Added in 0.6.0. Currently on master.\n. Firefox is on the rapid release cycle now and is currently at 16.0. It's difficult not to update at this point. Supporting six versions back probably isn't going to happen. Sorry.\n. Hmm, yeah I hadn't considered this use case. Is the gallery something that initializes when you click on it or something?\n. Perfect. I'll try to work on a solution for multiple instances this weekend.\n. Damn clients :P\n. I looked into adding this quickly to the next release, but it's trickier than I thought. I've scheduled it for 0.5.0, which is in the works now.\n. Multiple instances are now supported in 0.5.0. Shooting to release officially in the next few days. If you'd like, grab the code from 0.5-wip and try it out.\n. Discussion: http://nicinabox.com/blog/superslides-0-dot-4-1-released/\n. Aw crap. Looks like this is back again after a refactor.\n. I'm glad you brought it up :)\nI'll try to release 0.4.3 as a hotfix this evening. As it's coming up on the holiday it's unlikely I'll get another chance until the weekend I think.\n. I've got it, but I've got to commit and push it. Give me about 30 min\n. Okay! Sorry for the delay.\nThis is fixed in the dev branch. I'm not quite ready to release 0.4.3, but dev is nearly there. It has the fix you need.\n. Can you confirm that you are using 1.4.3 from dev branch? Also, if you look at the demo in dev with a single slide, do you see the same results?\n. It happens! Just needed to make sure it wasn't something on my side.\n. 0.5.0 will have the proper fix for this. \n. Yes, you can add .keep-original to any images that you don't want to be resized.\n. Yes, it's a class on the img. In 0.5.0 this was changed to preserve. \n<img class=\"preserve\" />\n. I'll make it configurable!\n. Firefox 12 is 5 versions old now. Testing that is going to be low on the priority list.\nBut could you give more info about what IE you saw issues with?\n. Ah, I know what this is. There's some odd issue between jQuery 1.8 and jQuery Animate Enhanced <0.99. The issue does not occur with jQuery 1.7. This has been an issue in the past (#7). Updating jQuery Animate Enhanced in the demo seems to fix the issue. \nI did note some downgraded performance in FF 12 with the jQuery Animate Enhanced plugin. Your milage may vary.\nIf you still see issues with IE, open an issue for those. Thanks for bringing this up!\n. Awesome, I'd love to see it!\n. I believe this has to do with the backface visibility property. It's so inconsistent across browsers :(\nThe video is helpful, thank you. \n. Good news, this has already been fixed in 0.4.3. It's in the dev branch if you want to grab it from there.\n. It's an issue with -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden. It should be fixed in 1.4.3, however.\n. Do you have any code you could share with me to help debug this setup?\n. Thanks! That is strange indeed. I'll look at this today.\n. Trying to debug this, but I have some questions about your code. What's the purpose of 'bigBox' any why is #slides fixed position?\n. Oh, hmm. There's an option for letting content scroll, but keeps the image in place. It wraps the content in .scrollable with overflow-y: auto. Would that solve your problem?\n. Closing this since there's been no activity in a month. New demo uses a fixed position technique and seems to work well.\n. That is correct. Pagination is updated on the slides.animated event.\nThis event happens after animation finishes (that's why it's past tense). This is by design. There is no event for \"before animate\". \nPerhaps you could give a use case for \"before animate\"?\n. It's in your paste after if (options.pagination). Each pagination item is added on the slides.initialized event.\n. Right. Because your animate event fires before the initialization event, the pagination items haven't even been added to the page yet. \n. Sorry, I'm a little confused at why you need to change all the internals. The point of using an event is so that you can hook into it outside of the plugin code. \nIf you remove internals that depend on events to initialize properly, you're gonna have a bad time. Why not just add the slides.animate event before animation occurs, then listen for that event in your application?\n. Ah I see. You're just wanting to change the functionality so have the active state on before animate. \nAbstract the the pagination code into a method an call it from both slides.initialized and slides.animate\njavascript\nvar updatePagination = function() {\n  var $pagination;\n  $pagination = $(\".slides-pagination\");\n  $(\".active\", $pagination).removeClass(\"active\");\n  return $(\"a\", $pagination).eq(current).addClass(\"active\");\n};\n``` javascript\n$window.on(\"slides.initialized\", function(e) {\n  $(_this).append($(\"\", {\n    \"class\": 'slides-pagination'\n  }));\n  return $children.each(function(i) {\n    return addPaginationItem(i);\n  });\n  updatePagination();\n}).on(\"slides.animate\", function(e, current, next, prev) { \n  updatePagination()\n})\n```\n. Great! I'm going to close this then if it's resolved. Feel free to open an issue if you find problems with the production code.\n. 0.5.0 will have the pagination updating before animation.\n. Good point. Would you like to send a pull request?\n. Fixed in 0.5.0\n. Ah, interesting. Yes. The reason is that the url still has that hash, so when you click on that item again, it still things it's on #2 according to the url. Definitely a bug. Nice catch.\n. This is already being reworked in the 0.5-wip branch. I'll take care of this bug there.\n. Fixed in 0.5. Shooting to release this weekend.\n. I ended up manually doing this on 0.5-wip https://github.com/nicinabox/superslides/blob/0.5-wip/scss/superslides.scss#L64\n. Thanks @AdRulz!\n. I was reading more about this. Apparently multiple hashes is not a valid URL. Plus, I can't reliably pull the slide number out of a URL with multiple hashes, so I opted not to include it in 0.5.0.\nCan you give a use case for this? Perhaps there's another way to go about it. \n. To be honest, no testing has been done in Opera. It hasn't been a priority since their browser share is just over 1% worldwide. Maybe we can change that in 0.5\n. Just checked 0.5.0-wip in Opera. Working great with the exception of some minor performance issues :)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/5l0c0.jpg\n. I'm shooting to release this weekend. Hopefully no later than Monday. I think it should be stable enough for testing if you want to try it out (0.5-wip branch). Be sure to read over the new docs, some things have changed.\n. This may have been an issue at one point, but I don't think it is anymore. IE7+ behaves consistent with other browsers  now.\n. Can you tell me if you still see this issue with 0.5.0?\n. I haven't been able to duplicate this and it's been a month with no activity. Feel free to reopen if this is still an issue.\n. I added an example for this in 0.6.0-beta2, but I'm not seeing flicker in Safari 6.\n. Ahhh, Thanks. I see that; definitely a bug.\n. Fixed in 0.5-stable branch.\n. I need to make the docs more clear :(. Use an integer for milliseconds: play: 5000\n. Good question. Images are set so the min-width is 100% of the image size. In other words, the image will not scale smaller than it's natural dimensions. It's never really come up before and the images that I've always used have been ~1000px sized for the web. \nMaybe it would be good to have a configurable option for this.\n. I'll have a look this morning. \n. Currently in progress on this.\n. @markyuk if all your images are larger than the viewport, yes that will work. min-height is already set on the image. You'd need to remove min-width and replace with max-width.\n. Yeah I see that. Bummer, I thought that might work. I'm adding some checks now to better scale the image.\n. I think I've got it working :)\n. @markyuk, @randalldon Can you grab the code from master branch to test for me?\n. Sweet, thanks! You'll probably want to compare what's in dist/ to what you've got. More than likely you'll just want to grab the javascript file.\nAlso just fixed #38 and #40. \n. And thank you for your feedback :)\n. I'm not seeing any issues with IE 7 or 8 as far as image resizing goes. IE7 seems to not want to cycle through the slides though, at least in the demo.\n. The marketing demo.\n. DOH! Right, scatterbrained this morning; will check again.\n. This is very helpful, thanks!\n. I haven't yet had time in my production schedule. I only have access to a windows machine at work, so I have to work it in sometime during the workday (maybe today!).\n. You're not a pain! I appreciate the follow ups. I promise, I haven't forgotten about you :). Unfortunately, I've been on a rather tight production schedule last week and this week. That said, I don't think it will be difficult to fix, just need some time to sit down and thoroughly test.\n. @randalldon working on it today!\n. @randalldon If you don't mind testing this out for me... Grab the latest from 0.5-stable and see if it fixes your problem.\n. That seems different that what you experienced before? Not loading at all though, that's odd. I'll try with a bigger image. \n. Hm, just tried with an image at 2048x1420 and seemed to perform as expected. My viewport is 1024x768 (virtual machine). Even the 'people.jpg' is larger, and it seems to work as you reported. \nAre you sure it's not an isolated case with the image you tried to load?\n. Yep, 0.5-stable. Can you give me more info about your machine?\n\u2014\n@nicinabox\nOn Thu, Mar 7, 2013 at 3:52 AM, randalldon notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nHi There,\nThanks for coming back to me. I've tried with several images with the same result. Teh images worked in all browsers other than these ie versions. Can you confirm which version of Superslides has these fixes. If i pull down the stable version is that the one you're using to test?\nMany thanks\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/nicinabox/superslides/issues/36#issuecomment-14551089\n. Just tried on IE8 native and still not seeing it.\n\n\n\n\n. I removed it because it felt it was too fine grained and I wanted to simplify the API. What are you trying to do? There is probably another even you can hook on to. \nsize returns the length of the slides. \n. I'm closing this issue now since there's been no activity.\n. Try grabbing the 0.5.1 release. I'm not seeing the behavior in the demo, so that might fix it for you.\n. Ahh, I see this in the demo now. Can't go directly to the last slide for some reason.\n. Fixed in 0.5.2 to be released today.\n. Unfortunately my production schedule has been too tight recently to address some of these issues. I'm hoping to get back at it this week.\nBut about Opera...it does work in Opera 12.12 on OSX (http://min.us/lTG7IpeZfjbgH). I wonder what's different about the Windows version.\n. Just tested on Opera 12.12 on Windows 7 (http://minus.com/lbsZfcUidfFGPr) and it seems to work fine there as well.\nWhat is \"12.50 internal\"?\n. Feel free to reopen (or I can) if there is an issue :)\n. Yes, that should definitely be using the class instead of first-child. Good catch. \n. Fixed in the next release (0.5.2)\n. Hm, it's designed to be fullscreen, edge to edge. Currently, just attaching it to a block element with it's own width constraint is not supported.\n. See #15 \n. Sorry, I need to clear up some confusion in the option and documentation. Use the delay as the value: play: 5000\n. Hmm, the code says otherwise: https://github.com/nicinabox/superslides/blob/0.6-stable/src/core_prototype.js#L122-L130\nplay is a delay interval. As in \"Play and move every n seconds\". \nAnimation speed is controlled with a separate option (animation_speed, conveniently): https://github.com/nicinabox/superslides/blob/0.6-stable/src/fx.js#L14\n. Ha, glad you got it worked out :)\n. Glad you got it. I'd like to setup a proper, formatted documentation page soon. It's definitely lacking a bit.\n. Sure! You'd need to write your own code for this, but it's very possible through the API. The basic process would be:\n- Listen for the animated.slides event\n- Check if the current slide is equal to the size\n- Call stop\n. Not yet! Aside from bugfixes, it's the next major feature on the list.\n. Thanks!\nIt just needs a little setup first. I have an idea of how I want to do it, just need to put down some groundwork so animations can be extended easily.\n. Thanks for the compliments @christian70. Rebuilding the animation aspect is one of my top priorities for this project. I just need to find a weekend to do it :/\n. I have an update!\nI am edging ever closer to releasing 0.6.0 with slide and fade as well as the ability to add custom animations. It's going to be on a production site next week, so keep a look out shortly after that. Check out the master branch demos for an peek.\n. @matthewcarleton Fade is working, but I need to bring a few other features back in. Check master branch examples for features you might want.\n. Grab 0.6.0 beta from master if you want to use fade. I'm using it in a couple production sites currently.\n. Thanks for the heads up on that typo.\nscrollable allows for scrollable content inside a slide. Check the demo for an example of how to structure that markup.\n. Just pushed a fix to 0.5-stable branch. See if that works for you. \nGood looking site, btw :)\n. @jakubbaranski grab the code from the 0.5-stable branch. It has the fix you're looking for.\n. Use the animated.slides event to play/pause the video (using Vimeo's API)\n. Probably something along these lines.\n``` javascript\n$(window).load(function(){\n  var $slides = $('#slides');\n// Vimeo API\n  var player = document.getElementById('player_1');\n  $f(player).addEvent('ready', ready);\nfunction addEvent(element, eventName, callback) {\n    if (element.addEventListener) {\n      element.addEventListener(eventName, callback, false)\n    } else {\n      element.attachEvent(eventName, callback, false);\n    }\n  }\nfunction ready(player_id) {\n    var froogaloop = $f(player_id);\n    froogaloop.addEvent('play', function(data) {\n      $slides.superslides('stop');\n    });\n    froogaloop.addEvent('pause', function(data) {\n      $slides.superslides('start');\n    });\n  }\n// Pause video when slides animate\n  $slides.on('animated.slides', function() {\n    $f(player).api('pause');\n  })\n// Initialize slider\n  $slides.superslides();\n});\n```\n. I'm not familiar with froogaloop or the Vimeo API. Above is basically the code from flexslider with the superslides api swapped out. \n. I know that feel bro.\nI'm addressing it this week with some other issues. Feel free to send a PR if you like, it's not a hard problem to fix.\n. Fixed in 0.6.0. Currently on master.\n. Not at this time. It fills 100% width and height. \nI've considered changing things in the future to allow it to be inherit it's size from a predefined element, not necessarily the window.\n. This is not an issue with Superslides.\nI'd recommend listening for the hashchange event and setting your navigation active state that way.\n. Not likely, but please provide a use case.\n. When you say \"animate the caption\", what do you mean exactly?\n. Superslides doesn't really work in this way. You could listen on the animated event to change the content below the slider. \n. Listen for the event animated.slides. \n. I have noticed this as well. I'm porting to JavaScript from Coffeescript and plan on addressing it during that. Any help is super appreciated though. I'd definitely merge a pull request that fixes the issue :)\n. @frodoschering What version are you using?\n. What's the css for your navigation?\n0.6.1 should definitely work. \n\n. How interesting. I would not expect that to have any impact on their display. \n. I think I can make this happen.\n. Hey, you're in luck! 0.6.0-beta2 already works this way. Check out the Play example on master.\n. Ahh my mistake. That was a false positive. Look for 6.0.1 today.\n. 0.6.1 is out with this fix.\n. I imagine this could easily be added through a data-hash attribute or something.\n. Added to 0.6.0.\n. Hm, that definitely shouldn't be happening, regardless of settings. Are you using 0.5.2?\n. Use jQuery to append the html inside the container then run the .superslides('update') method to let Superslides know the size has changed. That should work just fine.\n. Hmm, can you post an actual sample of the html you're adding?\n. Blerg, I see it. I think it should be calling adjustSlidesSize, on update, but alas, it isn't :(\n. Sure, if you're just wanting to make your local copy work, try adding to the this.update method at the beginning:\njavascript\nadjustSlidesSize(this.$el);\n. Right after this line: https://github.com/nicinabox/superslides/blob/0.5-stable/dist/jquery.superslides.js#L364\nI'm mostly speculating here. I haven't tested it, but I think that should work. The problem is that it's not recalculating the new slide positions.\n. Yeah I see that. Some issues here ;(\n. Oops, try this instead (same line): adjustSlidesSize($children);\n. I need to sit down with it then. I'll try to get it corrected this evening. Sorry man.\n. @shootingrubber Grab the code from the 0.5-stable branch now. It should fix this issue.\n. I see it happening. The images appear to be loaded.\n. Try from 0.5-stable again. I think the images just needed CSS.\n. Superb! \n. You won't be able to get 1:1 swiping easily, but you can trigger the animation on swipe. Use your favorite swipe detection library.\n. I've been using Hammer.js a lot recently to do touch swiping\n``` javascript\n  document.ontouchmove = function(e) {\n    e.preventDefault();\n  };\n  $('#slides').hammer().on('swipeleft', function() {\n    $(this).superslides('animate', 'next');\n  });\n$('#slides').hammer().on('swiperight', function() {\n    $(this).superslides('animate', 'prev');\n  });\n```\n. You'll need to size the image accordingly. The window size changes how the image is positioned and zoomed. I would recommend not trying to position to an exact pixel area, but rather allow flexibility in your design. Your users will not be using an ideal window size most likely.\n. No, it's fullscreen in both directions.\n. Fixed in 0.6.0-beta2\n. There might be a double image load going on. That could be affecting your performance.\n. Open web inspector and watch network requests as the page loads. Compare to the demo. It has pretty good performance.\n. Let's figure out what's actually happening first, then we can address the problem as it exists.\n. Nailed it. What version of superslides are you using?\n. Try 0.5.2 and see if that changes anything.\n. Hmm, you could try optimizing the images further. 150k each is pretty decent I'd say. Not sure what your hosting environment is like. How does it compare against the demo> I'm seeing about 1.1s on load and those images are in the 200-400 range.\n. Might also be helpful to watch the timeline to see what's getting hung up. Are you waiting for dependencies or libs or anything?\n. Is there something I could view?\n. Here's what I see:\n33 of 51 requests are images\n1.6 of 1.9 MB are images\nThe biggest hangups I see are images coming from Shopify (newroll_x.jpg) in which they are blocked from downloading until other things complete. You're losing almost a full second right there.\n. Also, you may not be the only one experiencing this.\n. I'm not super familiar with Shopify's environment though. You might try testing a few different things. You could try removing the slider then check the load. Or maybe try ajax loading parts of it alleviate the initial load. It it is truly an issue with their CDN, you'd need to look at some additional techniques or revising your design to work around these constraints.\n. Double load fixed in 0.6.0\n. I'll need to do some additional testing on iPad. Pull requests always welcome.\n. Image position has been reworked to function like background-size: cover. This will be released in 0.6.0, currently on master.\n. Don't use the built in pagination. Just create your own links and go to a slide when you click on them. \n. It really is. Use the href to go link to a slide. \n. See there!\n. Something like this. All of this is documented in the API.\njavascript\n$('#slides').on('animated.slides', function() { \n  var current_index = $(this).superslides('current');\n  $('.navigation li').removeClass('current');\n  $('.navigation li').eq(current_index).addClass('current');\n});\n. Sure, set play: 4000 in the options.\n. Thank you @amongiants, this is great! I could merge this in if you just commit the js parts separately (I don't want to pull in your readme or images, per se).\n. This looks great! I'm going to review it thoroughly this afternoon.\n. @amongiants Sorry, I still haven't had time to review this and I'm out of town this weekend. I haven't forgotten about it, just TONS going on. Promise to get back to this.\n. @amongiants Your commits seem to be gone?\n. Okay, before you do that, 0.6.0 on master is the latest code and will be released next week. It's a full port from coffeescript back to vanilla js. If you don't add it by next week, I probably will. \n. I just added it. Gets picked up automatically, no need for configuration.\n. This is fixed in 0.6.0-beta2.\n. Unfortunately I've had compatibility issues with jQuery 1.9 and haven't had time to address them. I recommend using 1.8 for the time being.\n. 0.6.0 is compatible with jQuery 1.9.\n. The latest tagged version should work fine with a single slide. But if you're just wanting a single full screen image, you don't need the overhead that this javascript provides. You can do that with just CSS.\n. Sounds like you got it under control then :)\n. Could you repost your images?\n. Great! I was only able to look at it briefly. Another possible solution: move the logo outside of the slides wrapper.\n. Definitely the top requested feature. I've started on an fx engine to make fade and other custom animations possible, but it's still in the works.\n. Thanks @nimr this is very helpful. I wish I had an Android device to test with. Maybe a friend can loan me one.\n. Custom pagination is not supported out of the box. You'll need you write your own logic for setting the state on each pagination if you opt not to use the built in one.\n. What version are you using?\n. Pagination is appended during initialization. Try setting it to display: none in your css first, then fading in after it's initialized.\n. Duplicate of #90 \n. Yes, listen for mouseover and mouseout events then stop/start the slides with the API. Easy peasy. \n. javascript\n$('#slides').on('mouseenter', function() {\n  $(this).superslides('stop');\n});\n$('#slides').on('mouseleave', function() {\n  $(this).superslides('start');\n});\n. Huh, I wonder if we aren't getting each others emails. I did get an email from you about 6 hours ago.\n. This is fixed in 0.6.0-beta2\n. play: 5000 or use false to not play.\n. Try with the latest release of 0.6. This should definitely work. You'll want to load in markup that matches your existing slides (so if you're using li's, be sure that's part of what you load).\n. The 0.6.0 beta has fade. You can get it from master branch.\n. I don't see anything wrong with that bit of code. Could you link to your source?\n. No that should work fine. It would be helpful to see your code for debugging though. \n. Yeah, order definitely matters. Include dependencies before you use them!\nThis doesn't seem like an issue with the plugin so I'm closing for now.\n. Agreed. Let's make this happen.\n. This is now a part of 0.6. Cheers!\n. Yes, I updated the readme. Bind to it the same as other events (the event is animating.slides)\n. Beta software. Things might not work as expected :P\nYou can still get the current by doing something like $('#slides').data('superslides').current\n. Remember, this is before animating, so current,  next, and prev will not have been updated yet. What is your expectation for what current should be? The outgoing slide, or the upcoming slide?\n. Okay, I haven't tested this, but it should work. I moved the event trigger down a bit and passed in the orientation hash. On your listener, do this and see if you get some values you need (grab the latest off master):\njavascript\n$(document).on('animating.slides', function(e, orientation) {\n  console.log(orientation)\n});\n. Killer\n. update is a synchronous method, so a callback is unnecessary. If there is an issue going to the next slide after update, then that should be addressed.\n. Cool, I'll have a look at, thanks.\n. Working on this now.\n. This is now fixed in 0.6.0-beta2 (on master).\n. Hmm what browser?\n. Here's what I'm doing to add a slide and I'm not seeing any weirdness:\njavascript\n$('#slides .slides-container').append('<img src=\"//lorempixel.com/1000/1000\" />'); \n$('#slides').superslides('update');\nAs soon as I add animate into the mix I see the new slide as blank. It looks like the image hasn't yet loaded. What if you setTimeout for 500ms?\n. Can you give an example of this?\n. This is a side effect of images not being fully loaded. \nPreviously on 0.6.0 you needed to call superslides after onload instead of onready to get around this. A few days ago I fixed it so you can use onready :)\n. Whoa thanks!\n. Fixed in 0.6.2.\n. No, but you could easily add this to your project using the API and setInterval. \n. Hmm, it definitely works in all those browsers. Are you using an element with an id of slides?\nThere is a error in the documentation I need to fix: .superslides('prev') does not move the slider. Instead it returns the index of the previous slide.\n. Great! Closing this then.\n. Hm, I believe that would fit in with this projects goals. What about video cropping?\n. You need to hide or remove it after initialization:\njavascript\n  $(document).on('init.slides', function() {\n    $('.loading-container').fadeOut(function() {\n      $(this).remove();\n    });\n  });\n. The files come from github so they should definitely work. If you're having trouble with it you could just grab the files in the dist directory. \n. Have you tried using .preserve on the images you don't want resized?\n. I don't think I quite follow what you're doing. Could you make a jsfiddle with a simple test?\n. Have you tried using a delegated event binding?\njavascript\n$(document).on('click', '.showButton', function() {\n  // show box\n});\n. You could use text-indent to hide the text. \n. You can try the old text-indent: -9999px trick :P\n. Hmm, what browser? And are you seeing any js errors?\n. Ahh, sorry, yes I see it now.\n. @fabyeah just pushed a fix to 0.6-stable. Wanna test it out?\n. Ah, got it, thanks. Fix on 0.6-stable.\n. Ah this is a bug. The timer should reset after any user action. \n. Oh sorry, I didn't realize you were using custom navigation. You just need to call stop before animate.\njavascript\n$('#slides').superslides('stop');\n. Yes, check the demo and examples directory. \n. Are you using 0.6.2?\n. Images with .preserve are mostly ignored. There is no letterboxing in the plugin. \n. Use css\n. inherit_height_from should be an element selector.\n. https://github.com/nicinabox/superslides/blob/0.6-stable/examples/constrained.html\n. Hmm, I haven't tested this against Zepto. It could probably be made compatible, but I'd wager right now Zepto won't work with it.\n. inherit_height_from should be a CSS selector string. \ninherit_height_from: '#slider_wrap'\n. Maybe you have a js error?\n. I think I would need to see it to tell you more. You haven't put .preserve on the background images?\n. You're missing position: relative on your .container.\n. ~~Add a zindex so it comes out above the image.~~ NVM.\nThis might have something to do with -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; :/\n. Upon more testing -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; seems to be the culprit. You can override this for now in css with !important.\n. Cool :) Need to get that fixed.\n. Back to #141 for this. We don't need 3 topics for the same issue ;)\n. Perhaps -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;? You may need to override in your css.\n. Can you share your code?\n. Sure, just use the API to determine when you're on the last slide, then change the href of that next link.\n. Sorry it's not possible to initialize on a particular slide except for in the url (blah#2).\nCustomize your hashes by giving ids to your slides.\n. Just call hide or remove on that element?\n. Use the API events to control effects on content. \n. pagination: false\n. Superslides is known to have issues with the default android browser :(\n. .preserve is intended to be used in content areas where you may have a headshot or icon or something like that. It's not for the background slides.\nImages stretch to fit the window using the math behind background-size: cover. Obviously if you have a tall image and you put it in a wide viewport, there will be space on the sides. Those empty sized need be be covered, and the only way to do that is by \"zooming\" the image. Otherwise you end up with a squished image and that's no good. \nSuperslides doesn't do letterboxing. I recommend using images that are similar to the viewport size.\n. How is this different from setting a min width in a media query?\n. No, sorry. \n. Have you taken into account browser chrome?\n. Sorry, this is not possible. The images would need to be letterboxed in theory. \n. Hmm, it should be resetting...\n. Hmm, this plugin doesn't do \"scrolling\" in the classic sense. section tags should work fine providing you follow the parent-child structure like a ul. \n. Listen for animate, check the slide index against 0 or the slides length. \n. This is normal. There is a 200ms delay on the resize even to avoid excessive repaints. Js based resizing will never match the performance of the equivalent CSS. \n. #45 and #173 are what you're looking for.\n. Confirmed. This is a bug. Would welcome a PR to fix it. \n. Thanks @ergec! I don't have time to test this right now, but if you were to make a jsfiddle or something demonstrating it works, I'll be happy to merge it in asap.\n. It should work. We had used it on production sites and our QA wouldn't have let that fly. \n. It looks okay to me in Chrome.\n. It sounds like you burned the text into the image. Text should be text on the web, not in an image. \n. No, sorry. Each slide fills the full window. \n. I link this idea. Send a PR!\n. Yep, you destroy the superslides object and take over with your own CSS at a breakpoint.\nOn Fri, Feb 14, 2014 at 2:34 PM, niallthompson notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nYou could use something like https://github.com/WickyNilliams/enquire.js to run the script at a certain breakpoint but I'm not entirely sure how to do it.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/nicinabox/superslides/issues/204#issuecomment-35122097\n. Are you sure? It may not wipe out the inlined css, unfortunately, but it should destroy the attached data. It should be simple enough to loop over the slides and set .attr('style', '').\n. Check if the current slide is equal to length - 1. Change the link attr if it is. \n. Glad you got it resolved\n. Please don't do this. Think of the users!\n. I'd really like to have this functionality scoped to the current slide. \n. Not at this time. The background-size: cover functionality is recreated with JavaScript for compatibility with browsers. Ideally this would simply be a polyfill, but it isn't right now.\n. Use the .preserve class. It's in the documentation.\n. Use the inherit_height_from option. Wrap your slider in another element that has a height. See docs for more info. \n. Add .preserve to the images that aren't backgrounds. \n. <img class=\"preserve\" ... />\n\nThis will prevent superslides from treating it as a background image, so you can style it as you like. \n. Yes, #box cannot have both position:absolute and margin: auto. Either use margins, or use absolute positioning.\n. Because you probably need some relative positioning in order to control the z-index. And that\u2019s fine.   \nOn Friday, April 25, 2014 at 1:34 PM, gustavsson15 wrote:\n\nThank you for the help, didn't got it to work anyway though, if i removed \"position: absolut;\" the box disapeared.

Sure, you can use whatever events you want to trigger slide transitions. Read the docs about the API. \n. Try setting inherit_height_from. Check readme for more info. \n. Sorry, it's not possible at this time. I suggest editing your images to include the necessary letterboxing.\n. I think you can turn off hashchange in the options.\n. Yes, there are pre and post animation events you can listen for. Check the readme for more info. \n. Check the examples directory?\u00a0\n\nWhat's obscure about it? Listen to events on the element. All the events are listed there in the readme.\nOn Sun, Oct 26, 2014 at 1:17 PM, Robert Wildling notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nAny chance for a little example?

Unfortunately I'm not near my computer and can't give you an example. This project assumes basic javascript knowledge from the user and is designed as such.

In case you accept this feedback: the readme could be better (at least point to the proper example)\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/nicinabox/superslides/issues/279#issuecomment-60526594\n. @rowild I appreciate you taking the time to give feedback. I wasn't trying to sound defensive or mean, just matter-of-fact.\nI don't see any reason why the events section cannot quickly show a line like this\n\nThere are in multiple code samples throughout the readme. I'd happily accept a pull request for this change. The only reason it didn't is because it seemed overly verbose. Event listeners like this are an extremely common pattern when using jQuery.\n\n... and reload my site with the fullscreen gallery, the console actually starts with a \"animated.slides\" and continues with a \"init.slides\"...?\n\nYes, this is a little confusing. The same code is used to do the initial alignment as is used for all subsequent alignments. I suggest attaching the animating.slides event in the init.slides callback.\n. That's correct. If you're listening to init, be sure to attach the listener before you initialize the plugin.\n. This would be awesome. Unfortunately superslides was written long before I knew about CommonJS modules and has basically no support for it. Your best bet is to modify it to work for you.\n. I think that's an old jquery thing.\n. Sorry, this is not possible with the current configuration. One duration applies to all slides.\n. ",

Hopefully, as you got this sorted on a previous iteration of superslides, it won't be too much hassle to sort out.

Sorry to re-open this but having checked out the dev branch yes the slide does show with a single slide now but the image overflow isn't hidden and so a scrollbar is presented to the height of the image.

I was looking into only grabbing the first image via jQuery's first() option but the 'not' option is much more elegant.\n. This is great news. Performance issues aside as long as superslides is functional in Opera i.e. content can be viewed then superb. Is there a timeline for 0.5.0 release?

My client has requested that i use large resolution images but currently the behavoir is as arielt1985 suggested. I really need to be able to use larger resolution images and allow these to be scaled down in the same fashion.\nIs there any update to the js that can be made to address this?\nIt's a bit of an urgent request really\nCheers\n. Hi there,\nDid you manage to have a look at this?\nCheers\n. Same issue here.\n. Looks all good. I've tested from the master in Chrome 24 Firefox 18, Safari 5.1, ie7, 8 & 9 on PC. Could you let me know which files have been updated?\nCheers\n. Agreed. Great work and thanks for looking into it so quickly :+1: \n. Hi there,\nUpdate to testing on this.\nThere does indeed seem to be issues with ie 7 & 8 now. I'm not seeing the image scaling at all in these browsers. For me the image is always it's natural dimension size and doesn't scale either up or down as the window is resized. Can you confirm this? ie 9 appears fine as does Firefox, Chrome & Safari though.\nCheers\n. Which demo link are you referencing?\n. This demo doesn't use any large resolution images though. They're all 1024x683.\n. Just to let you know the behavior i'm seeing it seems to be the same for both ie7 & ie 8.\n1. I'm viewing my demo site at full hd so 1920 x 1080 resolution.\n2. Some images are 1400x875 and some are larger.\n3. This shot shows the effect of a smaller image in ie7 & ie8 - http://s1077.beta.photobucket.com/user/randalldon/media/superslides-test-shot1_zps4704bfa3.jpg.html i.e. image is never scalable and always presented at it's original dimensions.\n4. This shows an initial load of the larger image which is fine in both ie7 & ie8 - http://s1077.beta.photobucket.com/user/randalldon/media/superslides-test-shot2_zps16537811.jpg.html?sort=3&o=1 - teh image is scalable at this point.\n5. However, in both ie7 & ie 8 if i navigate away from the page and then come back to it this is the result - http://s1077.beta.photobucket.com/user/randalldon/media/superslides-test-shot3_zpsce40b3fd.jpg.html?sort=3&o=0 i.e. the image goes back to it's original dimensions and doesn't scale any more. A hard refresh resets to the image to the state from point 4 but it loses it again as soon as you navigate away and return.\nAs i mentioned this behavior only seems to apply to ie7 & ie8 with Safari, Chrome, Firefox all showing the correct behavior i.e. the image always fills the screen and is scalable.\nHope this helps\nCheers\n. Just to add to this, and to eliminate any issue with my code i pulled down the master branch and placed a two test images in the index.html file with /demo. The behavior is the same as detailed above in ie7 & ie8 but fine again for other browsers.\nCheers\n. Hey There,\nAny joy with looking into this?\nCheers\n. No problem. It's a bit of a killer at the moment with images not functioning effectively for ie7 & ie8 :(.\n. Hi There,\nSorry if i'm being a pain on this as i'm sure you're busy but i was just wondering if you've managed to look into this any further? It's the last piece of the jigsaw for me so to speak.\nCheers\n. No problem. I really appreciate your efforts.\nCheers\n. Hi There,\nI don't suppose you've managed to take a look at this at all? I understand if you've not had the time.\nCheers\n. Hi there,\nI'm sure you're very busy but has the been any further investigation into this?\nCheers\n. Hi There,\nI've pulled down the latest stable as you suggested to test through IE and it seems there's some strange issues. If the image is smaller than the viewport i.e i'm testing on full hd so 1920 x 1080 and i reference your 'people.jpeg' it seems to work fine. However, if i use an image which is larger than the initial viewport so something like 2560x1440 the image doesn't load at all in any version of IE. The missing image icon seems to appear and the page background is just blank (please see the attached screen-shot). This behavior is the same for ie7, 8 & 9.\nCheers\n\n. Hi There,\nThanks for coming back to me. I've tried with several images with the same result. The images worked in all browsers other than these ie versions. Can you confirm which version of Superslides has these fixes? If i pull down the stable version is that the one you're using to test?\nMany thanks\n. Hi There,\nJust as an update to this when inspecting the generated html i notice that with all other browsers the  with the class .slides-container has a display value of 'block' set within the generated style on this element. However, the same  element when inspected in Opera it has a display property of 'none' set within the generated style on this element.\nIf i use a little jquery to change this property when the document is ready:\n$(document).ready(function() {\n    $('.slides-container').css({'display':'block'});\n});\nThis actually makes the slide visible but has the side-effect of it sliding in from the left when first loaded and this initial slide-in behaviour is subsequently inherited in other browsers. The navigation subsequently appears broken In Opera as the navigation links don't have numeric references i.e. the arrows just have # rather than #1 etc so i presume this is why the slides can't be navigated.\nHopefully this investigation in Opera can help in some fashion to diagnose these issues for this browser.\nMany thanks.\n. An additional update to this issue is that it seems superslides v0.5.1 works in Opera 11 as i donwloaded thsi legacy browser to test. Well, when i say works you don't get the sliding animation when navigation between slides but the content is visible and the slides navigation functions. It seems the issue lies with Opera 12.\nHope this helps.\nMany thanks.\n. Is there any update to this? It's a bit of a killer at the moment.\n. Thanks for having a look. I'm starting to think there may be an issue with my Opera installation. I'm working on Windows 7 too and Opera confirms i'm on the latest version and so now update is available. When accessing About Opera in the current set-up the details are as below:\nAbout Opera\nVersion information\nVersion\n12.50 internal \nBuild\n1497 \nPlatform\nWin32 \nSystem\nWindows 7 \nXHTML+Voice\nPlug-in not loaded \nBrowser identification\nOpera/9.80 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; U; Edition Next; en) Presto/2.11.310 Version/12.50\nI'm not really sure what the internal is either.\nI'll mark this as closed for now pending some further investigation from my end.\nCheers\n. Update to this. I see now that the class is .preserve rather than .keep-original in 0.5. This stops the additional image being resized from the original but it is still pulled out of the dom and placed alongside the main background image even with the .preserve class added.\nSo, i amended line 111 of jquery.superslides.js from:\nreturn $(this).find('img:first-child').insertBefore($('.scrollable', this));\nto\nreturn $(this).find('img').not('.preserve').insertBefore($('.scrollable', this));\nWhich prevents this behaviour and the image is now preserved.\nHope this helps.\nCheers\n. Hi There,\nI appreciate the superslides aspect is intended to be fullscreen and edge to edge but consider the use case where at a certain resolution the content within the slide has a minimum width. Currently superslides prevents the minimum width of the slide content being respected and as such beyond that minimum width the actual slide content gets clipped on the right edge making it partially invisible. It's not really a case of placing superslides in a block element but more a case of allowing it to respect the inner content's minimum width.\nCheers\n. No need to worry about this. I can see now that:\n$('#slides').superslides('current') = current slide\n$('#slides').superslides('size') = number of slides.\nMany thanks\n. Hey dandanv,\nI've worked with just this logic so i thought i'd help you out here. I think it depends which version of superlisdes you're using but if you're using the latest version i.e. v0.5.2 the logic is as below:\n``` javascript\n// Get total number of slides\nnumberofslides = $('#slides').superslides('size');\n// Get current slide\ncurrentslide = $('#slides').superslides('current');\nif (currentslide === 0) { // first slide\n// do logic here if required\n} \nif (currentslide === numberofslides-1) { // last slide\n// do logic here if required\n}\n```\nHope it helps\nCheers\n. And on your second query regarding usage of event handlers if you're using jquery a usage would be:\njavascript\n$(document).on('animated.slides', function() {\n// do logic here\n});\nOther events handlers are:\nstarted.slides\ninit.slides\nanimated.slides\nupdated.slides\nAgain, hope this helps.\nCheers\n.

This shows an initial load of the larger image which is fine in both ie7 & ie8 - http://s1077.beta.photobucket.com/user/randalldon/media/superslides-test-shot2_zps16537811.jpg.html?sort=3&o=1 - teh image is scalable at this point.\n5. However, in both ie7 & ie 8 if i navigate away from the page and then come back to it this is the result - http://s1077.beta.photobucket.com/user/randalldon/media/superslides-test-shot3_zpsce40b3fd.jpg.html?sort=3&o=0 i.e. the image goes back to it's original dimensions and doesn't scale any more. A hard refresh resets to the image to the state from point 4 but it loses it again as soon as you navigate away and return.\nAs i mentioned this behavior only seems to apply to ie7 & ie8 with Safari, Chrome, Firefox all showing the correct behavior i.e. the image always fills the screen and is scalable.\nHope this helps\nCheers\n. Just to add to this, and to eliminate any issue with my code i pulled down the master branch and placed a two test images in the index.html file with /demo. The behavior is the same as detailed above in ie7 & ie8 but fine again for other browsers.\nCheers\n. Hey There,\nAny joy with looking into this?\nCheers\n. No problem. It's a bit of a killer at the moment with images not functioning effectively for ie7 & ie8 :(.\n. Hi There,\nSorry if i'm being a pain on this as i'm sure you're busy but i was just wondering if you've managed to look into this any further? It's the last piece of the jigsaw for me so to speak.\nCheers\n. No problem. I really appreciate your efforts.\nCheers\n. Hi There,\nI don't suppose you've managed to take a look at this at all? I understand if you've not had the time.\nCheers\n. Hi there,\nI'm sure you're very busy but has the been any further investigation into this?\nCheers\n. Hi There,\nI've pulled down the latest stable as you suggested to test through IE and it seems there's some strange issues. If the image is smaller than the viewport i.e i'm testing on full hd so 1920 x 1080 and i reference your 'people.jpeg' it seems to work fine. However, if i use an image which is larger than the initial viewport so something like 2560x1440 the image doesn't load at all in any version of IE. The missing image icon seems to appear and the page background is just blank (please see the attached screen-shot). This behavior is the same for ie7, 8 & 9.\nCheers\n\n. Hi There,\nThanks for coming back to me. I've tried with several images with the same result. The images worked in all browsers other than these ie versions. Can you confirm which version of Superslides has these fixes? If i pull down the stable version is that the one you're using to test?\nMany thanks\n. Hi There,\nJust as an update to this when inspecting the generated html i notice that with all other browsers the  with the class .slides-container has a display value of 'block' set within the generated style on this element. However, the same  element when inspected in Opera it has a display property of 'none' set within the generated style on this element.\nIf i use a little jquery to change this property when the document is ready:\n$(document).ready(function() {\n    $('.slides-container').css({'display':'block'});\n});\nThis actually makes the slide visible but has the side-effect of it sliding in from the left when first loaded and this initial slide-in behaviour is subsequently inherited in other browsers. The navigation subsequently appears broken In Opera as the navigation links don't have numeric references i.e. the arrows just have # rather than #1 etc so i presume this is why the slides can't be navigated.\nHopefully this investigation in Opera can help in some fashion to diagnose these issues for this browser.\nMany thanks.\n. An additional update to this issue is that it seems superslides v0.5.1 works in Opera 11 as i donwloaded thsi legacy browser to test. Well, when i say works you don't get the sliding animation when navigation between slides but the content is visible and the slides navigation functions. It seems the issue lies with Opera 12.\nHope this helps.\nMany thanks.\n. Is there any update to this? It's a bit of a killer at the moment.\n. Thanks for having a look. I'm starting to think there may be an issue with my Opera installation. I'm working on Windows 7 too and Opera confirms i'm on the latest version and so now update is available. When accessing About Opera in the current set-up the details are as below:\nAbout Opera\nVersion information\nVersion\n12.50 internal \nBuild\n1497 \nPlatform\nWin32 \nSystem\nWindows 7 \nXHTML+Voice\nPlug-in not loaded \nBrowser identification\nOpera/9.80 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; U; Edition Next; en) Presto/2.11.310 Version/12.50\nI'm not really sure what the internal is either.\nI'll mark this as closed for now pending some further investigation from my end.\nCheers\n. Update to this. I see now that the class is .preserve rather than .keep-original in 0.5. This stops the additional image being resized from the original but it is still pulled out of the dom and placed alongside the main background image even with the .preserve class added.\nSo, i amended line 111 of jquery.superslides.js from:\nreturn $(this).find('img:first-child').insertBefore($('.scrollable', this));\nto\nreturn $(this).find('img').not('.preserve').insertBefore($('.scrollable', this));\nWhich prevents this behaviour and the image is now preserved.\nHope this helps.\nCheers\n. Hi There,\nI appreciate the superslides aspect is intended to be fullscreen and edge to edge but consider the use case where at a certain resolution the content within the slide has a minimum width. Currently superslides prevents the minimum width of the slide content being respected and as such beyond that minimum width the actual slide content gets clipped on the right edge making it partially invisible. It's not really a case of placing superslides in a block element but more a case of allowing it to respect the inner content's minimum width.\nCheers\n. No need to worry about this. I can see now that:\n$('#slides').superslides('current') = current slide\n$('#slides').superslides('size') = number of slides.\nMany thanks\n. Hey dandanv,\nI've worked with just this logic so i thought i'd help you out here. I think it depends which version of superlisdes you're using but if you're using the latest version i.e. v0.5.2 the logic is as below:\n``` javascript\n// Get total number of slides\nnumberofslides = $('#slides').superslides('size');\n// Get current slide\ncurrentslide = $('#slides').superslides('current');\nif (currentslide === 0) { // first slide\n// do logic here if required\n} \nif (currentslide === numberofslides-1) { // last slide\n// do logic here if required\n}\n```\nHope it helps\nCheers\n. And on your second query regarding usage of event handlers if you're using jquery a usage would be:\njavascript\n$(document).on('animated.slides', function() {\n// do logic here\n});\nOther events handlers are:\nstarted.slides\ninit.slides\nanimated.slides\nupdated.slides\nAgain, hope this helps.\nCheers\n.

Thanks!\n. $('#slides').superslides('current'); doesnt seem to work like it did in the last verion when placed within animating.slides or animating.slides.

I basically need the index value of the slide we are animating TO, and then I want to use that index value to fadeIn a div with a class of the same value. That way, I can fade In custom captions for the current slide.\nI want to use animating.slides to the transition can happen during the slide, not after.\nCurrent should be the upcoming slide, regardless of whether I am using animated or animating.

How about now? have you found anything @wjwhelan ?\n. Im not sure what to do.\nI know that I must use foogaloop.js, but what exactly I should add to my superslide ?\n$(window).load(function(){\n        $('#slides').superslides({\n            play: false,\n            slide_easing: 'easeInOutCubic',\n            slide_speed: 800,\n            animatedslides: true,\n            delay: 6500,\n            pagination: true\n        });\n        $('#slides').on('dragstart', function (event) {\n            event.preventDefault();\n            switch(event.direction){\n                case \"left\":\n                    $('#slides').superslides.api.next();\n                    break;\n                case \"right\":\n                    $('#slides').superslides.api.prev();\n                    break;\n            };\n        });\n    });\n. Thanks, but video don't stop when I click to next slide\n. A year ago you wrote:\n\"nicinabox commented a year ago\nThere is currently an event after slide (slides.animated) that you can bind to.\nI could add an additional event before animation begins as well.\"\nCan you still do this?!\n. Yes, please! I love the API, and this would really round it out.\n. Thanks! Can you please provide documentation? Not sure exactly how to use it, yet...\n. Thanks!\n. $('#slides').superslides('current'); doesnt seem to work like it did in the last verion when placed within animating.slides or animating.slides. For instance, this outputs [object Object] when it used to output the index value of the slide being shown. The following should show me 0, 1,2,3 etc, not an object, correct?\n$(document).on('animating.slides', function() {\n        console.log(\"current Slide\" + $('#slides').superslides('current'));\n});\n. $('#slides').data('superslides').current works great with animated.slides but leads to unexpected results with animating.slides\nThe index values are incorrect when manually controlling the slider.\n. I basically need the index value of the slide we are animating TO, and then I want to use that index value to fadeIn a div with a class of the same value. That way, I can fade In custom captions for the current slide.\nI want to use animating.slides to the transition can happen during the slide, not after.\nCurrent should be the upcoming slide, regardless of whether I am using animated or animating. Thoughts?\n. Yes it seems the upcoming_slide is giving the value that I need, thanks!\n. This script is great!\n. I am having this issue as well!\nSent from my iPhone\nOn Jul 4, 2013, at 3:57 PM, Dominique de Graaff notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nThis is kinda weird.
