Heard about Docker about a week ago on the NodeUp podcast and have been looking at it for the past few days.\nI've spent a couple of evenings now playing with it and looking at the possibilities. In general it is a very exciting project in terms of code portability, which is one things that made VVV so exciting but has proven a little more complicated than initially imagined. But I also think it's important to remember that the project is pre-1.0 and they are introducing many breaking changes with each 0.x release.\nThe thing about Docker that I find most intriguing is the idea of dependency injection. Separating processes into their own containers and then injecting them into each other through -link. Thinking about it this way it may be possible to have one version of nginx and then inject a specific versions of PHP into it depending on the needs of the project. Yet have another project running right next to it that has a different version of PHP injected into it and yet they still run happily next to each other.\nMost of the examples I've seen so far take the more fully featured stack approach such as the  https://github.com/jbfink/docker-wordpress/blob/master/Dockerfile repo that was mentioned, containing the server, PHP, and MySQL in the same Docker container, but this use case seems to be missing part of the point of Docker. Docker containers are intended to contain a single process more or less, not an entire stack.\nHere are some of the projects/links I have been looking at/considering in my research:\n- Fantastic use case explanation Part 1, Part 2\n- Docker example of using -link\n- More Docker -link docs\n- Docker -link intro with NodeJS\n- Supposedly info on separate Nginx and PHP containers (Note: haven't got this to work yet, but it may be because I don't have enough of a sysadmin beard).\n-  Good example of separated process containers with WP\n- Docker's official Vagrant file for setting up a Docker Vagrant\nAt this point I think Docker is interesting, and worth looking at/watching, but it would take a LOT of work to combine it into VVV directly. I'm certainly going to continue playing with it with the idea of using containers like legos (I want this project to run apache, with mod_php 5.3, MySQL 5.5. I want this project to run nginx, with php-fpm 5.5, MySQL 5.5, and memcached) and have them all play nicely together. There is still a lot of thought work needed for how this would work in terms of configuration needs, file processing, data persistence/backups, etc. \n. Sounds good to me. I've been meaning to push up what I have to share it, but haven't had an evening free to do it yet.\n. MIT sounds great. Let's do it.\n. MIT sounds great. Let's do it.\n. Was getting this same issue after updating. Patch fixed it right up, thanks!\n. I ran into this same thing weekend before last. I'm on OS X 10.8.5, and couldn't for the life of me figure out the problem. Uninstalled and reinstalled a few versions of Virtualbox and Vagrant, and also  worked from a fresh checkout of VVV. I tried with trusty64, trusty32, precise64, and precise32, but no matter what I tried it refused to connect.\nGoogle was little help, though the fact that you are on windows is a bit promising. There were a few people reporting success checking their BIOS https://github.com/coreos/coreos-vagrant/issues/63. Other Windows users have suggested disabling Hyper-V as it may interfere with Virtualbox interfaces, though you may also want to run VVV in Hyper-V.\nI gave up after about three hours of troubleshooting with no progress. I backed up my home folder, erased and re-installed my OS. Setup for me only takes a couple hours and my machine had a bunch of half installed local packages that I assume were conflicting in some way. Whatever the case, afterwards all pieces of the system ran smoothly. I had previously run into this issue with nokogiri installing any plugin, but that disappeared as well.\nWish I could have found the root cause, but the issue is a nasty one and I didn't want to waste more time on it. I determined it wasn't actually a VVV issue, but that's as far as I got. Something else was going on. Best of luck!\n. Lee, I'd suggest giving trusty32 a try, certainly couldn't hurt. I found\nwith my machine that the issue had nothing to do with VVV itself since even\nwhen running a vagrant init with a precise32 box and attempting to do a\nvagrant up it refused to boot. At that point, the switch to trusty64 had\nnothing to do with my issue and the problem was somewhere in between my\nmachine, Virtualbox, and Vagrant. I'm sure there is a fix without the burn\nit to the ground approach that I took, but unfortunately, if trsuty32 or\nprecise32 don't boot either, it'll be on the Vagrant project that you\nshould post the issue. I wanted to refresh my machine anyway which is why I\ntook that approach. Sorry for your trouble, this problem is pretty sticky\nand really sucks trying to work out.\n.

It's necessary for the SMB shares. NPM install fails in /srv/www/ without\nit because SMB doesn't know of or allow symlinks to be created by\ndefault. There is a mount option for CIFS shares (sfu) that renders the NPM\nchange unnecessary, however, when I had Vagrant mount the folders with the\n'sfu' option on, any and all git operations became unbearably slow (wp-cli\ntook an hour to check out and 30 min to switch branches).\n\nI've played with the --no-bin-links option quite a bit locally and it\ndoesn't seem to have any effect on the local grunt installs. Ran through\nall the WP core grunt tasks and all seemed to fire just fine. That said,\ngoogling around didn't turn up much on potential side effects. Just the\nfact it allows NPM to work in SMB shares, and could potentially cause\nproblems with global modules. It would be nice to know if there were\npotentially other ill side-effects of the flag, but so far I have found\nnone.\nOn Wednesday, September 9, 2015, Jeremy Felt notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nDig it! Thanks for all of that. Is the NPM change necessary for Hyper-V\nsupport and is there any chance of it breaking other NPM uses anywhere?

I may have just found a way around the no-bin-links issue, will do some more testing and report back.\n. OK, so I found a set of additional options for the mount.cifs command (what Vagrant uses to mount SMB shares) that didn't show up in any of the Googling I did. Amazing what reading the actual man pages inside the machine does :). Adding the mfsymlinks option makes everything work without needing to run NPM with the --no-bin-links flag and doesn't cause the slow git issues like the sfu option did.\nSo basically here are the options for the www folder and why I've chosen them to make things work:\n- dir_mode=0775: Sets the directory mode to 0775 as with other providers.\n- file_mode=0774: Sets the file permission to 0774 as with other providers.\n- forceuid: Fixes an issue where composer was unable to work properly with Github. Why? not sure...\n- noperm: Fixes issue where untaring files in www tries to reset timestamps on the extracted files and throws errors causing failed provisioning.\n- nobrl: Fixes an issue where file locks are used in database operations during provisioning, again causing failures.\n- mfsymlinks: Fixes an issue where symlinks are not allowed in www, causing npm install to fail.\nOther than these www overrides, the rest of the PR basically switches the box to a Hyper-V compatible one, sets the memory and cpus to be in-line with the other vvv providers, and switches all shared folders to use SMB when using the Hyper-V provider.\nIt would be great to have others test this, but I've now been able to clone a fresh copy of VVV onto my Surface and run vagrant up without any issues and without installing VirtualBox.\n. This is going to be related with the Hyper-V support I helped add. That code should only be running when the provider is set to Hyper-V, but admittedly I only tested it with Hyper-V. I don't have time right this second to help fix it, but can do some cross platform testing this evening and get a fix in place for this.\nruby\n  # The Hyper-V Provider does not understand \"dmode\"/\"fmode\" in the \"mount_options\" as\n  # those are specific to Virtualbox. Furthermore, the normal shared folders need to be\n  # replaced with SMB shares. Here we switch all the shared folders to us SMB and then\n  # override the www folder with options that make it Hyper-V compatible.\n  config.vm.provider :hyperv do |v, override|\n    override.vm.synced_folder \"www/\", \"/srv/www/\", :owner => \"www-data\", :mount_options => [\"dir_mode=0775\",\"file_mode=0774\",\"forceuid\",\"noperm\",\"nobrl\",\"mfsymlinks\"]\n    # Change all the folder to use SMB instead of Virtual Box shares\n    config.vm.synced_folders.each do |id, options|\n      if ! options[:type]\n        options[:type] = \"smb\"\n      end\n    end\n  end\nI made the assumption that being wrapped in the provider statement it would prevent it from running when it wasn't in the Hyper-V environment. Commenting it out will work as a temporary fix for any other platform, but will kill the Hyper-V support which needs SMB mounts. If someone wants to experiment with other means of looping through the configured shared folders to set SMB for only the Hyper-V provider before I get to it, that will be the fix here.\n. Tested now on both Windows with Hyper-V and my mac with Virtual Box. Normally I would let @jeremyfelt  merge, but this is causing too many issues.\n. I just merged this into my windows install to test since I'm using Hyper-V which doesn't support the static IP. Ghost should support the dynamic IP provided Hyper-V where I was using a modified version of the hostsupdater plugin before. I will report back on the success of the test when I have some data, and if I forget, please ping me :).\n. @morganestes - needs a bit of tweaking to get proper paths. We could make this function a little more general for reading files by lines, meaning Customfile users could make more interesting use of it, but here is a simple fix.

It's going to depend on where you installed Git. Mine was installed in the\nx86 folder, it looks like yours was not. This really should not affect how\nit operates, but if you are concerned, you could look in each and see where\nyour Git folder is located. Since Git is in your path, give the ssh -v\ncommand another try (note the space between 'ssh' and '-v'. If that is\nworking, double check you've gotten your HOME variable set correctly.

Hey Matt, it's kind of side-stepping the issue, but on of the things we've been doing when we have to deal with AnyConnect VPNs (and a couple of other VPN flavors too) is package them up and proxy requests through a virtual machine: https://github.com/ericmann/openconnect-vm\n\nYou can then use Proxy SwitchyOmega in Chrome, or FoxyProxy in Firefox to whitelist the requests that need to be made through that VPN connection. It has helped us only make requests through the VPN when necessary. Since the AnyConnect VPN is typically client owned, we try to keep requests through the VPN limited to ONLY requests for that client and the whitelist is the perfect way to do it.\nUsing this technique I have still been able to tunnel through to our company owned VPN (An OpenVPN install connected to with TunnelBlick) to keep general traffic secure. Running the AnyConnect VPN through the OpenVPN VPN was a bit weird at first, but I actually found it increased stability when switching networks rather than cause any problems. Good luck!\n. To be very clear about what this adds - you get the ability to run different sites on different PHP versions side by side with each other. And further more with the cookie mapping you can test multiple versions of PHP on the same site with the click of a bookmarklet.\nAlso worth noting, this requires the 64-bit OS. Switching to the 32-bit OS (precise32, trusty32) wont work. I know some end users have done this to fix some stability issues with their machines.\n. The hosts logic in the provisioning script adds hosts to the internal hosts file (the guest). The hostsupdater plugin, which adds hosts entries to the external (the host) machine, runs prior to provisioning. The only way to add hosts via the hostsupdater if you create the vvv-hosts file during provisioning is to run vagrant reload or re-running vagrant up.\nThis is generally why there are tools like vv or my generator-vvv which work to create those files outside the VM before running vagrant commands or provisioning scripts.\n. I don't think it's necessarily a requirement, but hostsupdater is a vagrant plugin and I'm not much of a rubyist, nor have I dug into the depths of vagrant to see if there is a later hook available. The hostsupdater plugin is also somewhat abandoned at this point, one of the reasons I'd like to see us replace it with Vagrant Ghost - a more updated fork of the plugin. That still runs on the same hook, though, not after provisioning.\n. Also, to be it clear -- Vagrant Hostsupdater and Vagrant Ghost are separate projects from VVV, so it's not really something this project can change.\n. ",
    "jeremyfelt": "Thanks, @lkwdwrd!\n. Thanks @ericmann!\n. I'm going to hold on this for a bit to allow for some brainstorming.\ncreate-dbs.sql is now responsible for creating databases and then granting privileges for users that we expect to already exist when code starts being used. It would be nice if there was a config file that the import script processed that created the database, added user privileges and then imported a specified filename. This would also allow for some flexibility in how DB files are named, etc.\n. Assigning this to the 0.2 milestone - but - it should work more in line with the new mapping of the mysql data directory before being committed. Will merge this into the vvvv0.2 branch before master.\n. Approaching this a different way now that we have the data directory. Still using this issue to track, but the next commit should clear this out with a method to check the data directory for the existence of the DB.\n. Closing this after commit - SHA: a39b627b8559d4184c94021d0646b69544f592de - addressing existing DBs\n. Actually, this might not be closed yet. I installed php5-imagick, which isn't necessarily the same as php5-imagick and Imagemagick... oops. :)\n. That's a bummer. I haven't noticed any troubles personally, though I can imagine how it's possible. I did notice weird issues when NFS was enabled.\nHaving shaped my view of a Vagrant workflow since this, I do think our original approach of not having persistent data would have turned out better. At the time I imagined destroying boxes more rather than just halting.\nI'm pondering some ideas on how we could make the switch without affecting existing workflows. I think getting any commands in place for saving snapshots would be a good first step. We can probably do some umount scripting at some point to help push things along before making a full switch.\n. I think that should be a perfect way to use it. I've forked the basic config for several different setups now.\nHave you been changing the subnet of the network each time? I noticed some really strange issues when I had Vagrant VMs up on the default 192.168.50.4 and something close like 192.168.50.6. I've resorted to moving things completely to something like 10.10.11.11, 10.10.12.12, 10.10.13.13, etc...\n. This has now become a documentation issue. Need to properly document how to connect to the database via SSH tunnel in Sequel Pro in the README.md\n. And/or the wiki. I forgot about the wiki.\n. Closing as this is mostly resolved, just needs docs\n. Merged this into the vvvv-0.2 branch, where active dev is happening right now.\n. Agreed - I think the biggest thing is the apt-get update as that causes the network activity. If it's easy enough, I do like the possibility of skipping the rest just to avoid the console clutter, but that's kind of picky.\n. After going through it, only checking apt-get update makes a ton more sense. That commit landed in SHA: b98787296644b2b8bd8ff71347b36da91668699e, the remainder of the provision cleanup will close out this issue, mostly by installing all packages together rather than running many apt-get commands.\n. Nice! I totally missed this in the docs. I was hunting all over and figured it was something we just had to deal with.\nThanks @carldanley!\n. Closed via develop branch in 7e7f2fcbd3\n. Thanks, @kadamwhite!\n. Can you resubmit this against the develop branch?\n. Confirmed - I get the same thing when I vagrant reload on an already running box. Does not cause an issue if the box is powered off.\nAppears to be this - mitchellh/vagrant/issues/1488 - fixed in Vagrant 1.1.6 (which is not packaged for download yet)\n. @TheLastCicada's 678e408 and f4bcae3 commits were cherry-picked as new commits 9ce6eb63c1 and 42a5f88f45 to avoid any possible confusion from the merge in 5691269.\nCloses PR32, thanks @TheLastCicada!\n. Can you resubmit this against the develop branch?\n. That would be excellent. I updated some tonight just to have more info, but another perspective would be great. Especially one good at documenting. :)\nSwitching this to the 0.5 milestone so I can still push 0.4 today. We'll be moving to the 10up account soon also, so then I can assign milestones. Woot!\n. I wrote up some documentation tonight in the Varying Vagrant Vagrants wiki on setting up new WordPress installations within VVV. I'll point you there for now and ask for feedback on how much it helped. :)\nhttps://github.com/10up/varying-vagrant-vagrants/wiki/Add-New-Domain\nThanks!\n. Awesome, good to hear!\n. I was originally trying to put something for this in /etc/rc6.d thinking that it would fire on shutdown. The only problem, ignoring that it's not working right away, is that this will fire on vagrant halt and vagrant destroy because both initiate a shutdown of the box.\nMore than likely this is vagrant plugin material, though I'm going to hunt a bit more.\n. I think I found a workaround and I'm going to commit it for v0.4 so we can see how it does.\nPreviously, I created the flag file at /srv/config/apt_update_run, which would persist throughout vagrant destroy as it was mapped locally. Now, I'm creating the flag file at /tmp/apt_update_run, which is only available to the guest machine. This persists through a shut down via vagrant halt and is removed on vagrant destroy.\nThis seems to provide a valid use for apt-get update: when packages are being installed from scratch in provisioning, apt-get update should fire. When packages are already installed, it should skip.\nI'm thinking of adding a bash alias as well to help remove the flag file if a complete re-provision is desired while keeping the box running.\n. Ha, nice! You beat me to it. I have this unstaged right now. Thanks!\n. I can't imagine there being many side effects, especially in a local dev environment. I'm wondering if there's even a setting for unlimited - 0? - that would work for us. Trouble may then come from something like nginx that times out on serving the page? I don't know enough about xdebug yet to say that's even a concern.\n. @tddewey - A quick look at this again identifies the nginx fastcgi_read_timeout as a very possible option.\n.

Not completely sold yet as at some point a completely different provisioning script is called for.\nGoing to approach like this:\n- Allow for a secondary provisioning script. If it exists, use that instead. IMO, this makes more sense than the components directory.\n- Setup a flags directory to allow sections of the default provision.sh script to be skipped\n. See 5d58044342 and 8af9d343d5 for the custom provisioning additions. I actually think this works really well for hooking into and/or replacing the default provisioning without getting too crazy and modular.\n. Closing due to merged Pull request #51 \n.

Just realized I can be even more specific - https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#120-april-16-2013\nThere's a Cygwin note there on some breaking changes.\n. FYI - one of the issues addressed in Vagrant 1.2.2 appears to be unix style line endings. A binary should be posted later today. It'd be interesting to see if this helps the SVN issue. \n. Does the same issue occur when moving non SVN files inside the virtual machine?\n- vagrant ssh\n- sudo bash\n- mkdir /srv/www/test-directory && touch /srv/www/test-directory/testfile && mv /srv/www/test-directory/testfile /srv/www/testfile\nI'm wondering if this is something that can be solved with a workaround inside the VM or if it's entirely a Windows permissions error.\n. Sounds great. I'm also playing around a bit with alternate methods for the stable and trunk downloads.\n. This seems like a scary fix to include, though adding a \"severe_svn_issue\" flag or something may work.\nI'm feeling like there has to be another way around this. Let's continue brainstorming for now.\nShot in the dark... If you look at the mapped drive for MySQL data persistence, we set 777 file permissions on it:\nconfig.vm.synced_folder \"database/data/\", \"/var/lib/mysql\", :extra => 'dmode=777,fmode=777'\nI wonder if that would help?\n. Would be interested in a confirmation on the dmode/fmode setting. That worked magic in solving our MySQL data issues on that shared folder. I think something more magical than a standard chmod, but I'm not sure.\n. Doing some side troubleshooting with @TheLastCicada related to this issue and I want to stress the attempt on setting file permissions beforehand.\nOnce a directory is mapped, something changes (due to VB or Vagrant) about the ability to change permissions on that directory inside the VM on the fly. When I do cd /srv/www/ && chmod 777 wordpress-default after boot, no error is returned but the permissions do not change either. If I chmod a file, the permissions change fine.\nChanging:\n- config.vm.synced_folder \"www/\", \"/srv/www/\", :owner => \"www-data\"\nTo:\n- config.vm.synced_folder \"www/\", \"/srv/www/\", :owner => \"www-data\", :extra => 'dmode=777,fmode=777'\nWould definitely be worth a shot on this issue.\n. That's a bummer. I'm pretty sure my Windows laptop is Win7. I'm going to pull it out later and try to find a way to reproduce.\n. I pulled out my Windows 7 laptop and got the same SVN issue on the first try, so I was able to dig in and troubleshoot a bit.\nThis forum post led me to think that upgrading SVN from the default 1.6.19 to 1.7.9 would help with the Virtualbox / Windows file permissions issue. I'm about to commit a change that appends new sources for SVN to /etc/apt/sources.list. I've tested this in the same Windows 7 installation and things appear to work fine.\nThis may break existing Windows installations due to an error with the SVN working copy needing to be upgraded. For some reason it drops as soon as it hits that. Either deleting the directory and going through provisioning again or running svn upgrade on the working directory inside the virtual machine will resolve the issue.\nI'll comment on @jupiterwise's Pull Request separately.\nHope this solves some of the SVN dilemma!\n.

We'll go with this for now and think about switching to sed if it makes sense down the road. Closing PR.\n. Agreed. Historical context... :)\nWhen I first started playing with Vagrant back in December, I tried to dive into Chef immediately. Things started to get confusing when I was trying to learn both Vagrant and Chef at once. I made the decision to go forward with shell provisioning so that I could focus on learning Vagrant first.\nOver time, it's become more and more obvious that the natural progression is to use Chef, Puppet, or .... for better control over provisioning. I've leaned towards Puppet lately as it seems more approachable to me than Chef and I have a door to knock on in Portland if things get crazy.\nTwo things to weigh right now.\n- I'd like to wait for @TheLastCicada and others to chime in with thoughts on using Salt for provisioning. There's a pull request open on the Vagrant project now that may account for this in the future.\n- I still think that provision.sh is like the 'view source' of the 90's and need to think about how that relates to this project's overall goals.\nMy inclination is to split off a project to act as a 'view source' example and refactor VVV to use a decent provisioner.\n. @nb I was way happy to hear that you were using Vagrant for the workshop. Great use case!\nDoes WP.com use Puppet internally?\nI'm wondering if Puppet should be the answer for now because of familiarity within the WordPress community. \n. We're officially giving this a go. @danielbachhuber and I spent some time today hacking on Puppet and imagining a way forward with structure, etc.\nI've deleted all of the existing configurations from the shell provisioning and we're going to start stepping through with the new setup. Help is more than welcome.\nThoughts..\nPrimary goal continues to be to provide an approachable way for WordPress developers to match production in their development environment. The use of a provisioner takes away some of the ability to view source and see how it's done, but we gain much more in maintainability at all levels.\nVVV is still a scaffold. It can't solve all the problems, but it can solve one really well while being extendable.\nWould like:\n- Any modules used to be fairly vetted. We can always swap modules in the future, but it would be nice to have some stable stuff right away.\n- Discussion needed on whether these modules should be submodules in the main repository or something else.\n- Build our own WordPress submodule. Unless something really convincing exists in the wild already. Guessing prior art from @markjaquith could provide a way forward?\n- Approach the structure of config files and directories differently than before. We want to include a default configuration for WordPress stable and trunk as we do now, but it would be nice to define configurations at the project level.\n- All features currently in VVV to be included.\n- More discussion on this. :)\nAlso - don't click Merge pull request yet...\n. I think this vision is colliding with two things: Vagrant is intended to be used on a project-by-project basis, and Puppet expects consistency, not variability, when configuring a machine.\nI think this is a pretty key point and even the shell provisioning has a collision here.\nVVV as a scaffold can provide a structure for a specific project that allows you to to modify as needed. _s is somewhat of an example here, though slightly different as...\nVVV as a standalone can also provide a nicely configured default development environment. Especially for a theme or plugin project, development can start up immediately.\nThe long term goal of having projects describe themselves and fit directly in with VVV definitely deserves more thought as we build this out.\n. I'm pausing on including Puppet provisioning for the near future. I need to reflect more on the purpose of Varying Vagrant Vagrants and probably write up some more clarifications on intent. I very much appreciate all the effort that has gone into this PR so far as I think we've learned a lot from it.\nIn brief and less thought out nutshell - Vagrant is flexible with the provisioning methods that it can handle. Varying Vagrant Vagrants takes advantage of one of these provisioning methods to provide a single environment. Custom environments should require custom provisioning.\n. I'm going to close this issue out. It's fantastic how much discussion was generated. Thanks to all for pitching in on the Puppet attempt and resulting conversations.\nFeel free to continue leaving comments on this closed issue if there are related questions.\n. Intent here is for VVV to use APC as opcode cache only. That said, if we can make it easier for someone to use APC as object cache instead of memcached without having to do a lot of customizing, then that might be worth the change. Especially worth the change if memory isn't allocated until used.\n. Healthy discussion and this makes sense. Going to map a custom apc.ini file so that we can continue to make additional changes there when required. We'll try this out with the 512MB box size and see what it feels like.\n. Dig it. Would it make sense for php_errors.log to be accessible on the host machine as well through a shared directory? Thinking of fancy ways you could keep an eye on a log.\n. I broke the merge-ability of this PR in a larger attempt to clarify our php.ini customizations. Closing, but the PR has effectively been merged. :)\n. In the current config, it appears to create the file as owned by www-data:www-data with 644 permissions. Seems to work? Try the latest and see if you get the same thing.\nhttp://cl.ly/image/1N2B013K1s3V\n. About to close this with a commit as well. Agreed that 128M seems like the correct value.\nWould like to continue to discuss possible stats/monitor tools for inclusion at the default URL.\n. This sounds like an nginx config issue at first glance.\nA few things that may help:\n1. Confirm that MAMP is off. Weird things have been known to happen.\n2. Confirm that those domains are only configured once in your hosts file.\n3. Double check your Nginx config. If you want to provide the config for one of the new sites, I can take a look and see if there are any issues.\n. I've run into weird issues after sleep before if I hadn't halted or suspended the Vagrant intentionally beforehand.\nWithout knowing for sure, I would attribute this to VirtualBox's handling of the shared network and drive interfaces. Probably worth troubleshooting and trying to duplicate a bit so we can come up with decent docs for those that run into it.\n. I tried duplicating the issue by putting my MBA to sleep for a bit and bringing it back up a few different times. The VM stayed up and the network connection never had issues. I'm going to chalk this up to Virtualbox losing track of the network interfaces. Seems that vagrant reload or vagrant halt and vagrant up should fix the issue when it does come up.\n. I became a code stepper today to verify this. :)\nEverything looks to be working fine. I'm going to open up another issue for discussion on one of the specific directives in the xdebug.ini directory as well as another to properly document how to get setup for remote debugging in PHPStorm and Netbeans.\n. @marco-s nope, but we're getting there. See #116, which should have some progress soon.\n. @marco-s nope, but we're getting there. See #116, which should have some progress soon.\n. A few of the packages require user input if you don't force the yes which can cause problems during provisioning. There might be a smarter way (?), but because this is a sandbox and not a live server, we aren't too afraid of complications.\n. This is a good question, I have no idea. :)\nI think --assume-yes makes a lot of sense though.\n. Closed in d431ad8fc3fc249095b62565d0b886014a108153 and cfc936a73db2a1f56a25d062358853ed3332ca18\n. From what I recall, the wp-config created by WP-CLI does not allow you to enable WP_DEBUG on the fly. I think this is the only reason we modified and then copy the sample.\nThere may be a way to filter that behavior in WP-CLI that I don't know about though.\n. Ahh, I see now. That's a new one. I'm working on updating it to match that syntax. Thanks!\n. +1, mine was way out of date because I don't deal with it too regularly.\n@danielbachhuber do you see any issues automatically updating wp-cli on up or provision?\n. Can we do git pull origin master on vagrant provision or do we need to update with composer?\n. I've been following the thread a bit. Things look to be patched for the upcoming 1.2.3 release, so that's good. VVV will always be confirmed working with the latest release of Vagrant only. After some discussion on our end, a lot of pieces have to add up for this to be a security issue to worry about. As always, if you're doing work on public networks, it may be worth looking at a broader option to block incoming attacks. Thanks for the report!\n. SSH into the virtual machine - vagrant ssh and try pinging your web server. If it does not respond, edit the /etc/hosts file in the virtual machine. I've seen a couple cases where the VM somehow did not pick up a domain via the DNS provided from the host. Very much depends on how capsule is connecting to the server and whether it needs public access the other way around.\n. I've run into this a few times, though I feel like there was one time the index.php wasn't there, so I'm a bit confused. Without digging too deep yet, I know that setting the 'Custom Structure' option will allow you to exclude the index.php. @johnpbloch mentioned including a mu-plugin by default, which is possible. Would be cool to find the reasoning and patch core if that's an option.\n. Nice! Good hunting. I think it would make sense to put this in config/wordpress-config/mu-plugins/ along with the current cron filter. We'll need to come up with the proper way to enable these by default at some point.\n. +1 for simple solution.\n. Awesome, thanks @teraphy!\nAny chance that this can happen when using only one system? I think they symptom has come up there as well when just using Dropbox as a cheap backup.\n. Closing this out with some info for future viewers:\n1. I would bet on random issues popping up from time to time when multiple machines are trying to share the same .vagrant/ directory created on vagrant up that is stored in a shared in a Dropbox directory\n2. If you set the environment variable VAGRANT_HOME to something other than that shared Dropbox directory on each machine that intends to share that Vagrant setup, then the sky should be the limit.\n.

I'm really interested in seeing this working and b68951c1ae has been merged in to close this PR.\n@pmgarman I'm not great with the finer details of this stuff and am having trouble verifying the agent forwarding works. I've followed the GitHub guide and I thought all the pieces were in place, but am a bit confused still. Can you explain your step 2 above?\nAt some point it would be great to get a good tutorial on the wiki for how to do this in OSX / Linux / Windows.\nThanks!\n. Ahh! More sense is now made. \nI had been using ssh-add -L on both the host and the guest and each said that no identities were found. I was confused by the line ssh-add yourkey in that section of the tutorial because I wasn't sure what yourkey represented.\nVia the ssh-add manual, you can run ssh-add without arguments on the host machine to add some default keys (located in ~/.ssh/). If you need to add a custom key, you can use ssh-add ~/.ssh/custome_key_file.\nOnce I added the key, my identity was available to be shared with the guest and it works. Closing this out as confirmed now. Thanks @danielbachhuber and @pmgarman.\n. Thanks for the note! I've been watching the 4.2.14 stuff, but hadn't really thought about what pointing everyone to the latest downloads page would result in.\nThe good news is that 4.2.16 was just released today and appears to be working fine.\nI'm going to update README.md with the latest version and a note about where to get this version if it is no longer the latest release. The ongoing goal is to test these immediately so we can provide a bit of a buffer for everyone.\n. Going to remove this later today. Any objections?\n. We've come pretty close on this so far and it's more of an overall objective than an issue. Almost ready to close it out.\nIt would be sweet to figure out how to silence all the NPM stuff that happens, because a bunch is just not needed.\n.

Be quiet with your output unless verbosity is required.\n. @westonruter has the right idea for this in 8651ff66, it would be wonderful to find a way to pass it from Vagrantfile.\n. We may also be able to remove the IP completely in default.conf and use a wildcard as it can also be considered a catch all for anything not configured. I forget how Nginx handles load order with those files and if a wildcard there will catch everything, even those that are defined in other files.\n. Per the numbers here, it looks like it's worth going down this path again. I'm going to play around with NFS locally and see what happens. Would definitely like to hear from Windows users as well to make sure it fails gracefully.\n. This conversation between @rmccue and @kurtpayne also makes me want to test VVV more thoroughly with and without NFS on OSX and compare numbers with a Windows box. I know the MBA will skew things due to its SSD drive, so it would be nice to test in OSX on non-SSD as well. We should find a way to benchmark things in the VVV environment a few different ways.\n. And more data for this thread, as of mitchellh/vagrant@c0404e3 (due in 1.2.5 release), NFS is mounted with UDP which apparently makes things even faster.\n.

Especially if you are able to turn them off through a config change. The original weird issue is that the errors would not go away, even after a config change.\n. Any opinions on this before I merge it in?\nMy original thought was that it would be on the developer to maintain the state of the primary WordPress version and its plugins after the initial setup. I think I've come around though and now see it as valuable to keep both trunk and stable updated on every provision.\n. There is a place in the ecosystem for a Vagrant that does handle this type of switching for thorough testing of plugins and themes that are being developed for possible use in multiple environments. VVV is probably not that place, as it's default configuration is intended to match what 10up considers to be a common setup for high traffic WordPress sites.\nPHP 5.4.17RC1 being installed rather than the latest stable (5.4.17) is another issue that should be sorted out.\n. Where is this place?\nNowhere. Somewhere. :)\n@tollmanz and I had some talks about what it could look like. I have a name for it, but nothing else yet. Really, it's a space to be filled.\n. Closing this now, though continued discussion is always welcome.\n. The immediate solution (beyond sticking with v1.1) is to change the custom apt source back to php55-oldstable. This may introduce other dependency issues, but will probably go relatively smooth.\nIt's tough, but I think good that we start moving up to PHP 5.5 sooner than later. I'm not sure how well we can get nginx/php-fpm floating around between versions, but that would definitely be a custom setup.\n.

Deployment can be very project specific. It's common for 10up to use Beanstalk to deploy specific theme or plugin code if the server setup matches. Otherwise a deploy script can initiated in other ways. I think VVV is a great environment to explore using stuff like WP Stack (Capistrano) or Fabric or ... in your own projects. Probably not part of the project roadmap itself.\n.

Current work on the auto-site feature is primarily being done as a pull request on a branch at the X-team fork of VVV.\nThe plan is to get things happy there and then move them back in under this PR (I think). :)\n. Another thought. If we accomplish the right amount of bare minimum, I think we make space for various approaches for auto WP configs to be setup via VVV extensions. Multiple repositories could exist with examples of files needed to setup WordPress trunk on multisite, with WordPress in a subdirectory, with various development plugins installed, etc, etc...\n1.

Xdebug is off by default due to perceived speed issues. It can be enabled quickly through the use of the xdebug_on alias.\n. I did some quick investigation and maybe there's a way to route the errors back to nginx with catch_workers_output? http://serverfault.com/questions/387068/how-to-configure-php-fpm-to-log-logs-to-log-files-configured-in-nginx-virtualhos/387170#387170\nWould definitely be interesting to see a solution that makes logs easier to read per site. Not to get off track, but our nginx error logs all go to the same place too.\nGoing to see if we can work towards this as another v1.0 feature.\n. Random thought that logstash may be an interesting\u2014albeit slightly heavier\u2014solution here.\n. While it may be hard to split php error logs into multiple places, a script that greps the logs for a specific site may be feasible once the logs are in a more accessible place.\n. I think the only way of this happening would be to specify multiple pools in the PHP config. There may be a way to output different logs then. If not, you could still tail -f | grep [pool www] or similar.\nI'm leaning towards this not being a thing in VVV, so I'm going to close this. But we can always reopen if there's interest. :)\n. Dig it! Merging in a few mins. Thanks!\n. Changed the host name in 0dd4f747 and verified that vvv is automatically added to /etc/hosts on the guest machine by default.\n.

The most undocumented piece of VVV I think. :)\nIt's not currently symlinked, as I haven't been sure what everyone expects from that. My over cautiousness told me there is a chance that enabling those plugins by default will cause confusion when a developer thinks they're working with a clean install.

I like this and just merged it in, but now I'm thinking it could be cool to have another default server specified that points to a file explaining how to setup custom domains. The IP address would still show the 'dashboard', but any other site that hadn't been configured would show instructions. Thoughts?\n. Thanks, @mboynes!\n. Thanks for the PR, @mboynes!\nI'd like for initial work on this to be done under #100 with the auto site creation that @westonruter submitted. Ideally, there would be some sort of configuration file that specified a per project list of plugins to install so that we could loop through those with wp-cli once the site is configured. The script in d0d3d42 is a good example of something that would fit in provision-post.sh at the moment.\nI'm going to close this PR and ask that you check out #100 and see if we can fit stuff there. Thanks!\n. Thanks @aaronjorbin!\n. That sounds slick... I think. :)\nWhat packages would be considered global in our setup?\n. When using sudo COMPOSER_HOME=/usr/local/src/composer composer global config bin-dir /usr/local/bin inside the VM the first time, I get:\n```\n[RuntimeException]\n  No composer.json found in the current directory\nconfig [-g|--global] [-e|--editor] [--unset] [-l|--list] [-f|--file=\"...\"] [setting-key] [setting-value1] ... [setting-valueN]\n```\nIf I run:\nCOMPOSER_HOME=/usr/local/src/composer composer global require --no-update phpunit/phpunit:3.7.*\nCOMPOSER_HOME=/usr/local/src/composer composer global require --no-update mockery/mockery:1.8.*\nCOMPOSER_HOME=/usr/local/src/composer composer global require --no-update d11wtq/boris:v1.0.2\n... without that config line running successfully, it seems to work fine (except for a complaint in mockery).\nIs that config line needed anywhere?\nI'm going to flip this issue to a PR, so a branch will be available soon to finish this off.\n. I'm probably missing something about how Composer works. With the branch in its current state, phpunit is not available as a global command as expected.\n. Ahh, I get the bin-dir command now. Thanks @johnpbloch! I'll test later and remove Hamcrest as well.\n. And I think we're good. Things seem to be working everywhere. It's fun to get rid of code and configs. :)\n. Going to close this out for now in the hopes that #138 and 6d9a997 will avoid the issue in the future.\n. Seems like we're good to go here, so I'm going to close this out.\n. A note for handling this in the future... Vagrant 1.3.0 will have Vagrant.has_plugin? available to use.\n. Looks good, thanks!\n. Hey @lvnilesh, thanks for the patch!\nI've debated doing this in the past and have always fallen on the side of these not being clickable in the GitHub version of the README only because they are invalid unless you are prepared for them. This time I'm leaning toward it, as clickable links would be nicer than copy/paste.\nAny thoughts from others?\n. Sounds smart. Can we assign File.join(File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__)) to a variable rather than performing the same operation multiple times?\n. To reiterate (as I explore a solution), this is the core issue:\n```\nvagrant up\nvagrant ssh -c \"service nginx status; service mysql status; service php5-fpm status\"\n * nginx is running\nmysql start/running, process 2089\n * php5-fpm is running\nvagrant halt\nvagrant up\nvagrant ssh -c \"service nginx status; service mysql status; service php5-fpm status\"\n* nginx is not running\nmysql stop/waiting\n * php5-fpm is not running\n```\nI left memcached out, as it manages to restart just fine.\n. So. After one more vagrant provision or vagrant destroy, all should be good to go with vagrant up after vagrant halt.\nWin!\n. I know @carldanley does some additional directory mapping via a Customfile if he wants to chime in, hint, hint. :)\n. There's likely a way, though I'm leaning toward offering the older config options instead so that it will boot correctly anyway.\n. See #153 for the fix on this. We check for the Vagrant version and support both 1.2.x and 1.3.x with their respective config options.\n. Try running vagrant provision to have Vagrant run through provisioning again. There's a chance that some step failed along the way. Also, we had some weird stuff on the latest master yesterday when using Vagrant 1.2.5 so it's worth making sure you have the latest Vagrant installed (1.3.1).\n. I ran into something similar yesterday, and forced an uninstall/reinstall of mysql to happen with the following:\n- vagrant ssh\n- sudo apt-get remove mysql-server\n- sudo apt-get autoremove\n- exit\n- vagrant provision\nAnother option is probably to wipe it with vagrant destroy and try from scratch.\n. This issue should be addressed in the future by the work done in #153 to be backward compatible with Vagrant 1.2.x.\n. Good catch! I swear that it worked before. Do you want to submit a PR with the working code?\n. And we're good, thanks @alexw23!\n. While we're waiting for this, which may still land this year, can you (@westonruter, cough, cough) explain a workflow that would benefit from having the git-svn setup? I'd likely continue using SVN to generate my patches, but I'd like to imagine ways where this could help before we push it in when the time comes.\n. and right now the develop.svn is not canonical either, since it goes through a build process and gets committed to the old SVN repo, right?\nI'm not completely familiar with the build process that gets it from develop.svn to core.svn or to a production release from either of those. However, the patches submitted to Trac should always be against develop.svn rather than the old core.svn.\nEven now, git diff --no-prefix should generate a patch that can be used fine with patch against an SVN repo.\nIt may be worth pondering a way to handle a flag somewhere that allows a complete switch from SVN to Git on all WordPress repos that we include.\nTo continue brainstorming\u2013it may be cool to convert our current WordPress installations to use the new auto-site generation stuff. An option could then be allowed for that replaced the default SVN for a site with Git.\n. I see what you did there.\n. This is really intriguing and we should give it some thought for a bit.\nMy immediate thoughts:\n- If we move to Git for src.wordpress-develop.dev on new provisions of VVV, the main benefit I see is for somebody contributing. This allows for easy local branch creation for flipping between various patches during testing or developing.\n- If we stay on SVN for src.wordpress-develop.dev on new provisions of VVV, we can still offer a Git based repo with an Auto Site Setup extension. If we give it enough thought, there may be a way for this to clear the default SVN checkout and clone into the same directory.\n- If we switch to Git, we can also offer a similar Auto Site Setup extension to flip back for those that are comfortable with the SVN based workflow.\n- If we do flip, it should not be forced onto existing provisions. If .svn is already there, we should let that be.\n- I don't see the same benefit for local.wordpress-trunk.dev. I think leaving that untouched likely makes sense.\nI know having Git as part of a core development workflow will be fantastic for me. Would love hearing more opinions, especially on how it could be important to keep SVN around.\n. I'm kind of digging the conversion via script approach that @westonruter suggests. I'd be willing to trigger a script any time I destroyed things completely.\n@TobiasBg - I destroy often for testing, though I hardly ever clear the www/* directories, so those portions are usually untouched. I can't imagine that a day to day user of VVV uses destroy much. If anybody does, halt may save a bit of time. :) \n. I've converted this issue to a PR so we can start working on this. I think the script mentioned by @westonruter is probably the right answer.\nI've taken a quick stab at naming the script and putting it in config/homebin/ with our other helper scripts. I'm not going to work on this immediately, but hopefully we can figure it out over the next couple weeks.\nFeel free to submit pull requests against the 154-develop-git branch on the VVV repo.\n. Works beautifully. Thanks @westonruter!\nA couple notes:\n- This does require a vagrant provision so that the deploy_git file can make its way over via rsync. In the future, we might harness Vagrant for that. For now we'll just have to keep that in mind if anybody asks. :)\n- An untracked .svn-backup remains in your working directory. This is good because it provides that backup, but may be confusing? Maybe not. We could consider moving it to another directory or displaying a note about the file.\n- I was impressed that my dirty working directory from SVN made its way over to git. So smooth.\nI'm going to merge this in for easier testing on master. It requires an opt-in with the deploy_git command, so I don't think it will screw anybody up.\n. I merged 64aea095a in via cherry-pick in 798c5a67 to leave the other commits behind.\nEverything seems to work, though Gmail flags as spam. I'm a little wary about doing this versus logging mail to a file you can monitor, but I think it will come in handy for troubleshooting HTML email issues. Who'd of thunk setting up mail would be this easy. ;) Thanks, @lkwdwrd!\n. Good call. I added a doc note to the file for now. We can plan on removing it from the repo once 3.7 is released. Leaving this issue open until then.\n. Need to test these hooks now that 3.7 is released. I swear I got bit by the index.php thing the other day on a 3.7 RC, but I was probably seeing things and it may have been during a test upgrade from 3.6 or something.\n. It would also be interesting to see what ping local.wordpress.dev returns in your Windows command prompt. That would tell you whether the address was resolving correctly to 192.168.50.4 or not. Also, open Virtualbox and make sure that only one VVV virtual machine is running, otherwise there may be conflicts.\n. As of Vagrant 1.3.0, you'll need to do either a vagrant provision after a vagrant up if the previous state was power off via halt. You can also do vagrant up --provision to force provisioning to run when bringing the machine up from a halted state. That would explain why the ping is getting a response but nginx is not running.\n. Yeah, in hindsight that's probably the worst possible password to choose and document. None of the WordPress setups use root/blank at all by default, so we can probably change it without worry of back-compat issues.\n. The only tough part here is the persistent database files. Will be worth testing what happens on a new up after a vagrant destroy when MySQL is reconfigured with a new database user/pass. The users for the WordPress installs will be fine, but we'll want to make sure that the new install of MySQL overwrites the password stored in the mysql user database.\n. I haven't used any of the cloud providers yet, though I'm anxious to try. My guess is that a more traditional provisioning system like Ansible / Salt / Puppet / Chef would be applicable to those and that VVV as a project would be a strange fit in a long term production project.\nIt would be interesting to see what happens though. :)\n.

I think we're good here. There's a chance some will have trouble with persistent databases, but I can't imagine it being likely that this will cause horrible problems. I'm going to merge this and #164, which should help cut down on confusion overall.\nI thought about modifying init.sql to grant privileges to the root user with a password of root, but the current user and pass are required in order for that script to run properly. I'm fine with making a small break here to make it easier to understand and use going forward.\nThanks @leewillis77!\n. I think we're good here.

A few things:\n- Do you get the same thing on a non SSL URL? http://local.wordpress-trunk.dev\n- Is it as slow when you go directly to the default http://192.168.50.4 address?\n- What versions of Vagrant / Virtualbox are you running?\n- OS looks like Windows.

Hi @janikvonrotz, thanks for the pull request!\nI'm hesitant to add in a full Grunt setup for the VVV repository as a whole as I'm not sure what a larger scheme would look like around that. One of the benefits now is that there are few requirements to get started with Vagrant. If we added a Grunt.js file, then I would likely want to add more automated events beyond the README HTML creation. At that point we would have another requirements.\nMy inclination is that this would be fine as a custom add on in a local copy of the repository. I'm open to providing an HTML version, but I think that may be best generated elsewhere.\nHappy to hear any discussion around this. Thanks!\n.

After more thought, I wonder if there is room for somebody to provide a general WordPress/Vagrant forum or discussion site somewhere.

Vagrant's https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/2309 addressing this issue was closed and released in the now available Vagrant 1.3.5.\nI tested the latest and all appears good. This is now the recommended version to use VVV with.\n. Also try rerunning vagrant up with vagrant up --provision. If for some reason the box thought it was up before, the provisioning would not have run and some services would not start.\n. Good to hear! \nRelated #148\n. @GaryJones what version of Vagrant are you using?\n. @GaryJones Try Vagrant 1.3.5. Vagrant 1.3.4 had issues with hosts in Ubuntu boxes. I can't believe I didn't draw the conclusion earlier. See https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/2309 for even more info.\n. No self update so far. Downloading and installing to the same location will do it. I haven't had any troubles with that method yet.\n. Well that's annoying.\nTry removing the .vagrant directory that was likely created by previous attempts. It may be that something is cached there and unhappy.\nAfter that, open the Virtualbox GUI and see if any VVV machines are running. If so, you can delete them before attempting another vagrant up.\n. To @AaronHolbrook's issue, I feel like I saw that the other day on my machine that's running Virtualbox 4.2.18, but not the one that is running Virtualbox 4.2.3. Both are running Vagrant 1.3.5.\nUntil we get #148 worked out, I've resorted to always using vagrant provision when I want to apply provisioning after an up or a halt and only using vagrant up to power on the machine. If starting from scratch via destroy, there is no problem at all.\n@GaryJones I'm feeling stumped, hence the no reply. :) I'm almost wondering if there's some kind of permissions issue with your Windows 7 setup. Is there any way you can capture the output of an entire vagrant up after a vagrant destroy and paste the output into a gist? Reaching for straws now that @ericmann has a Mac, but he may have some input on issues with Windows 7 as well.\n. @AaronHolbrook provisioning after a vagrant halt is expected behavior now as of Vagrant 1.3.x. See #148 for explanation. Provisioning should happen every time after a complete vagrant destroy.\n. Guest-specific operations were attempted on a machine that is not\nready for guest communication. This should not happen and a bug\nshould be reported.\nI think this is the key. I've never seen that message before, but it seems to imply some trouble. It may be worth opening a bug on the Vagrant repo with the output of VAGRANT_LOG=debug vagrant up, which should capture a bunch of info.\nIf you can post that extra debug here as well, I'd be interested in seeing what it tells us.\n. Yup, Guest Additions are installed as part of the process for creating Vagrant boxes for Virtualbox.\nThe precise32 box that we're using with VVV has them included by default. The version number may be off a bit from the current Virtualbox version, but they still do the job. I know the vagrant-vbguest plugin will attempt to update Guest Additions on an existing box to the current version, but that shouldn't be necessary.\nThat this error message is appearing means (I think) that the Guest Additions are not able to enable communication between your local machine and the guest VM. It may be worth using the vagrant box remove precise32 command to remove the box entirely from your machine so that it forces a new download on the next vagrant up.\n. Are php-fpm and mysql started as well? What happens after another vagrant provision once the vagrant up is done?\n. Man. This is tough. I'd go with uninstalling vagrant-vbguest, cloning the VVV repo into a new directory, and starting with a clean vagrant up to see if there's something in this existing setup throwing things off.\nIf the Guest-specific operations were attempted on a machine that is not ready for guest communication. message still appears, that's definitely Vagrant bug reporting territory.\nMight be worth changing Virtualbox versions as well to see if 4.3 helps.\n. Hi @marcinant, thanks for stopping by. This sounds related to #148, which addresses the new vagrant up behavior in Vagrant 1.3.x. vagrant up --provision or vagrant provision will properly restart the services in the virtual machine as part of the new workflow. If not related to #148, can you please provide some more detail on the issue that you're seeing? Thanks!\nHey @tnorthcutt, I'm guessing I'm not seeing was really I'm seeing? What OS, Vagrant version, and Virtualbox version are you using? A capture of the entire vagrant up in gist form would be great too. Thanks!\n. Hi @marcinant, thanks for stopping by.

Thanks!\n. @marcinant @GaryJones @tnorthcutt - Can you all try the latest master of VVV? The fix in 71fd85722 may be the answer to some of these issues.\nThanks!\n. @marcinant Great! A little bit of a bummer, but at least expected now. We'll get #148 fixed soon and the vagrant up --provision won't be necessary.\n. @tnorthcutt I think that's Vagrant version specific. Pretty sure vagrant up --provision works fine once you get into the 4.3 range.\n. @marcinant su should only be required when the local machine's hosts file is being written to by Vagrant via the vagrant-hostsupdater plugin. I think the two ways around this are to manually manage your hosts file locally (uninstall vagrant-hostsupdater) or change the permissions on the local machine's hosts file so that su is not needed.\n. Awesome, thanks @cadwell and @lkwdwrd! Fingers crossed for #176 now. :)\nGeneral historical note for stumbling across in the future...\nThe vvv -> vvv.dev change was made in fe25934e57c. Changing the hostname back to vvv causes no issues as we add vvv.dev in our custom vvv-hosts file anyway.\n. Can you toss your init-custom.sql into a gist so I can check it out?\n. See what happens if you do this:\nvagrant ssh\nmysql -u gfmealplan -pgfmealplan\nSHOW DATABASES;\nIt's possible the user in phpMyAdmin doesn't have access to the DB.\n. Related #250 \nI could see upgrading to PHP 5.5, phpunit 3.8, and WordPress 3.9 all at the same time in Aprilish.\n. Agreed, it's definitely a great time for the change. I'm going to wrap up VVV 1.1 for \"release\" this week and then we can toss 5.5 into master.\n. I dig it, thanks @cfoellmann!\n. Good call... And merged. Thanks, @westi!\n. I failed here.\n. I've often wanted a multisite setup by default. It's tough to draw the line at what might be just including too much.\nI think for now it would be good to implement additional setups with the new VVV auto-site process. See @lkwdwrd's repo for a good example of a few sites: https://github.com/lkwdwrd/vvv-auto-setup\nOver time I'd like to move our existing setups into the auto-site structure so that it's easier to copy and expand on.\n. That was quick, thanks!\n. Additional FYI - This solution applies to Virtualbox 4.3 and 4.3.1. As of 4.3.2, VirtualBox initiates a proper cleanup of the old version and avoids the need to use this as a solution.\n. The joys and perils of VirtualBox :)\n. Thanks @ryanduff! I updated the note a bit after merging in b76910596ae\n. It seems like the failure at ppa.launchpad.net causes the entire installation procedure to fail. The VM has no trouble with a direct curl to the URLs that are failing.\nI am confused.\ncc/ @TheLastCicada @johnpbloch\n. Entirely possible that it's been updated with a slightly different config, though that answer might confuse me even more. :) AFAIK, there is no cache on the box itself that would survive a vagrant destroy.\n. @ryanduff Totally misread your cache comment the first time around. Exactly right.\nThe red is likely okay. There are a bunch of smaller things that we haven't been able to completely silence yet. I think the color can sometimes come down to the running program not correctly identifying its current state to the terminal. It would be fantastic to finish tackling that at some point, as the GPG key errors and NPM lines are always making me double take.\nThat in itself is slightly concerning that we're not getting the same provision every time. After all, that's the point of vagrant.\nWe'll always get a close enough provisioning in that the latest packages from each repo will always be requested. This can cause slight variance between provisioning instances, but won't often cause major problems. Outgrowing that stage probably comes with using a different provisioner and getting better at maintaining specific package versioning.\nI think the issue @jtsternberg is seeing is network related, which is the one thing that will blow up any type of provisioning from scratch. As @johnpbloch said, we should bail completely (with a helpful note) if apt has trouble, as we obviously rely on that immensely.\n. @TheLastCicada @ryanduff I could see a custom box if we decide to drop Ubuntu 12.10. The official precise32 box has been excellent thus far (and I'm not sure it has changed yet). If we did go the custom box route, I'd rather not pre-provision anything on the box for VVV beyond essential stuff. As soon as we include more than the base, we add more maintenance requirements. That kind of workflow becomes very much project specific, IMO.\n@jtsternberg This makes some sense. Without those additions, we'll be dealing with an old version of SVN, Git, and possibly no Node.JS. It's good to know it succeeded somewhat. With @ryanduff's report that other errors are appearing, I'm also working on starting up a new instance from uncached scratch. Hopefully we can start seeing some similarities here.\n@ryanduff Can you capture any errors from your new vagrant up if they continue?\nAnd - Thanks for all the input, everyone!\nAlso\u2013this should be unrelated, but I was seeing some weird DNS issues in a CentOS config and that led me to copy over custom DNS files for use by the VM. I wonder if using Google DNS would ever cause issues in VVV.\n. The good news is that everything there looks fairly normal. I forget about some of those errors from time to time, but they shouldn't be bad.\nThe bad news is wp-cli... :) My box download is still going, will see if I get something similar soon.\n. @TheLastCicada I could see a scenario like that working out. I do want to start encouraging more vagrant halt in everyone's lives so that random provisioning issues don't ever have much of a chance.\nMy one worry with providing older versions is how tough it would be to then manage an upgrade process to the latest PHP and Nginx versions when all conditions allow for it.\nThis could all be the lead up to a fun experiment in Packer though... ;)\n. For historical purposes, 82022787bf is the commit where separate apt-get install instances were combined to handle all packages at once. It's worth noting that if we split these up into separate sections again\u2013php, nginx, etc\u2013a single failure would not bring down all provisioning.\nAnother change possibly introduced when I hadn't full wrapped my mind around workflow yet.\n. Certain things can easily be updated if using a proper provisioner like puppet where you can ensure a certain version\nExactly. Many related thoughts on this w/ VVV are in #65, which uses the words proper provisioner. :) I probably have different opinions now, so I should reread that PR.\nVVV will always be bash, as it is more approachable when learning the concepts around Vagrant. Also, I believe that every proper provisioner started off as a series of shell scripts that got too big for its britches.\nI come from CentOS/Puppet world and was actually considering starting a CentOS based version of something like this with a proper provisioner. Unless... others want to collaborate.\nMore Vagrants, please! I'm using Salt at WSU and have a half-forgotten Ansible repo somewhere. Humanmade has Salty WordPress. It would be fun to see more options in the wild.\n. So... mine made it through all of provisioning without issue before failing with a dump at vagrant-hostsupdater.\n[default] Running cleanup tasks for 'shell' provisioner...\n/Users/jeremyfelt/.vagrant.d/gems/gems/vagrant-hostsupdater-0.0.10/lib/vagrant-hostsupdater/HostsUpdater.rb:104:in `digest': can't convert nil into String (TypeError)\n3 different issues, FTW. Time to inspect commits for character encoding troubles.\n. @jtsternberg Can you try v0.9 rather than master. If it worked for some reason, it would at least narrow it down to something we've done since the last release. https://github.com/10up/varying-vagrant-vagrants/releases\n. @jtsternberg Just noticed this in your first file:\nInstalling Virtualbox Guest Additions 4.3.2 - guest version is 4.2.0\nDo you have the vagrant-vbguest plugin installed as well? If so, please try with out. I've noticed really weird issues with that in the past and the guest additions being out of date does not cause any trouble that I know of.\n. My previous error did not occur after an immediate vagrant up --provision, I'm going to blame vagrant-hostsupdater for that one.\nI'm on OS X Mavericks, Vagrant 1.3.5, Virtualbox 4.3.2. I'll try it on my other machine later tonight to see if I can reproduce anything.\n. @jtsternberg I tried again without the custom apt sources, as those shouldn't matter at all. After commenting out the \"unknown to nginx 1.1.9 directive worker_processes auto;\" here - https://github.com/10up/varying-vagrant-vagrants/blob/master/config/nginx-config/nginx.conf#L12 - I'm able to access http://local.wordpress-trunk.dev and http://src.wordpress-develop.dev just fine.\nWhat kind of network connection are you working with and what are your DNS servers? This seems very much network related.\n. You'll need to run vagrant provision again for the nginx changes to make their way to the VM.\nIt may be worth trying with different DNS servers on your local just in case your ISP is having trouble... I'm stretching. 8.8.8.8 / 8.8.4.4.\n. vagrant destroy / vagrant up if you have changed DNS servers. I think things are going to be hobbling along until we figure out what the root cause is.\nvagrant provision runs the provisioning script again. vagrant up is like powering on a physical box. vagrant halt is powering off the box without deleting anything. vagrant destroy is like ordering a new server.\n. @jtsternberg Any updated status on this? I'm hoping the other day was just a weird day.\nAdded FYI - I did notice a network related issue with VirtualBox 4.3.2 on my machine today that resolved with VirtualBox 4.3.4.\n. Good deal, I'm going to close this for now. That you're seeing similar issues with VIP Quickstart and VVV likely indicates that something is up with your system and Vagrant or VirtualBox. If you ever want to do additional VVV specific troubleshooting, feel free to toss more info on this issue.\n. Should we move all the sites in the www directory to use the auto-site setup method? Dog fooding, and all that.\n:+1: :+1: :+1: \nShould we even consider moving some of those sites out into their own repos, allowing VVV to lose a little bloat\nI think these three work as just enough bloat. It provides a great core development environment with the ability to flip between latest stable, core.svn, and develop.svn on the fly.\nIf we did move them out to their own repos, it would be cool. I would want to continue including them by default through git clone or something.\n. @markchitty Welcome! :)\nI think if we get the auto site stuff setup right, we'll be able to make it possible to disable things with small modifications as @tnorthcutt mentioned. At some point we had a flags system that was more trouble than it was worth, so we'll definitely want to try to avoid that.\n. The dream has been realized in #980! :taco: \n. I had an issue a long time ago that lead to the use of this: https://github.com/10up/varying-vagrant-vagrants/blob/master/config/wordpress-config/mu-plugins/jf-cron-filter.php\nI think I was only seeing the issue on cron requests, but it may be related as that is how the dashboard widgets are pulled in.\n. I'm wondering if it's the same kind of issue that was causing problems in #208. If the VIP Quickstart repo is having troubles too (via https://github.com/Automattic/vip-quickstart/issues/96), I'd focus on possible issues that VirtualBox is having talking to your local machine's network interface.\n. The unfortunately long path I might attempt:\n- Search VirtualBox Bugtracker for similar issues with your host and guest combination.\n- Look for possible firewalls restricting traffic somewhere at the OS or hardware level.\n- Look for anything on your network that could be conflicting with the 192.168.50.x subnet.\n- Try with a Microsoft VM as well to see if the network issues appear there as well.\n  - If that works fine, try on a CentOS VM to see if it is an issue with the Precise 32 box we're using or with Linux boxes in general.\n- Start stepping back through VirtualBox versions to see if something broke at some point.\n.

As of Vagrant 1.3.0, a cleanup script is allowed for in Vagrant, though I haven't yet explored it much.\nhttps://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/1302 is the discussion around it, though it's noted that the shell provisioner doesn't apply in the last comment. It might be worth digging in there to see if it's possible.\nI do think we should work toward moving the data off of shared drives with or without this. It would be great to account for it if we can, and we should provide default scripts for saving DB states before destroy.\nAll in all, after our best effort, the expectation should be that stuff can blow up at any time. For projects that require better data security in a development environment, it's likely a place for custom scripting to back that up locally or remotely.\n. This may explain it? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19262896/syntax-for-vagrant-provisioner-cleanup-tasks\nIt's allowed for, but only the built in Chef plugin actually takes advantage of it so far.\nThe vagrant-triggers plugin is given as an answer there as well.\n. I just tried to do something fancy with an rc0.d or rc6.d kill script. You would think those would fire on destroy, but it doesn't seem so. Though I'm not great with that stuff, so it might be worth another attempt.\nI think I'm going to open an issue on Vagrant to request a cleanup shell command.\n. And we have https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/2538 open. :)\n. Let's try to shoot for this by the end of January in 1.2 or so. While it would be nice to have an automated script on shutdown, I don't think it's necessary. I think we can offer script examples for backing up / importing databases on regular intervals and I think we can provide better workflow instructions in the meantime to make vagrant halt a more natural thing.\n. This vagrant-triggers plugin seems like it could help out here.\n. HA, of course I didn't read my previous comment. I'm awesome.\n. We should make this move. Life is much more pleasant in a VM with non-persistent database data.\nI've assigned to v1.3 with a target of April sometime.\n. We can probably detect the existence of the database/data directory in Vagrantfile. If it exists, we can continue to mount the directory. If it doesn't exist, then we don't worry about it\u2014and stop creating it in the VVV repo.\nOther stuff:\n- The initial SQL for setup can still be used.\n- We'll want to make sure documentation is clear about possible data loss.\n- We'll want to document a process for backing up and restoring data.\n- Over time we can script that process.\n.

I've been running this locally for a bit and love it. No issues along the lines of #287, it just works.\nI think I'm going to try to bring this into master soon with some kind of flag (I know) to mount or not mount the directory.\n. And we're done. #322 is merged and master is DB persistence free. :)\n. Ahhh, yes. This is an old piece of the readme. I'm in the process of revisiting the entire thing, but I think adding a link to @simonwheatley's wiki page on auto site setup is the best for now, as that is the easiest way to setup additional sites.\n. Hi @connorblack, thanks for stopping in!\nI don't think there will be much work toward a single workflow with VVV. I think we're good in sticking with a few default configurations for smaller projects and WordPress core development.\nThe auto site setup that is in the master branch now for release in 1.0 in the next week goes a long way toward providing a method of setting up additional workflows within VVV. It's entirely possible to take advantage of additional provisioning that matches something your team can use.\nIf things on the server differ much from the environment provisioned in VVV, I would recommend forking off and matching it 1 for 1 wherever possible.\n. Hey @mattmess, sorry for the delayed response on this. I'm about to push a default config for phpMyAdmin that includes this option.\n. I like it.\nHow will it handle directories? Can I run wp ssh --host=vagrant ... from a specific WP directory in VVV and have it translate?\n. This may be the thing that hooks me on aliases finally. :+1: \n. @westonruter I'm walking through ooooold issues. :) Any updates on the WP-CLI SSH front?\n. @westonruter I'm walking through ooooold issues. :) Any updates on the WP-CLI SSH front?\n. And shipped!\n. Yes! Thank you.\n. This looks good, thanks @pbearne! It would be cool to be able to better support the existence of projects outside of VVV root.\nI think it will make sense to wait until 1.1 to make this change. If you'd like to submit a pull request, I can merge it in after the 1.0 release.\nDo you know exactly what {,/*/**} matches? I'm not up to speed on glob + regex and haven't found anything obvious.\n. I'm hoping that find /srv/www/ -maxdepth 5 -name 'vvv-hosts' | \\ in provision.sh works with symlinks already. I may wait a bit to merge this until we confirm.\nIf someone can confirm... :+1: \n. I'm hoping that find /srv/www/ -maxdepth 5 -name 'vvv-hosts' | \\ in provision.sh works with symlinks already. I may wait a bit to merge this until we confirm.\nIf someone can confirm... :+1: \n. I've merged this into current master, though I'm not convinced it works entirely. It seems to pick things up during vagrant up just fine, but the symlinked directory in /srv/www/ was not accessible inside the VM.\nI may revert this until a later version.\n. I think I may have misunderstood part of this. I tried with a symlink of a directory to another directory in www/ and it was not happy.\n@pbearne The symlink was to the www/ directory included with VVV?\n. I'm still pondering this, but at first glance you could probably still manage each project's git repository under VVV's www/ directory. Each of those projects could point to a WP_CONTENT_DIR, also existing in www/, that contains all of the plugins and themes.\n. now lets go to the www folder and create a new site and because I what it in source control I have a problem because you can't nest git's\nNew child directories in www/ are in VVV's .gitignore, so any new repositories added at this level should not have trouble.\ngit clone git@github.com:10up/varying-vagrant-vagrants.git vvv-local\ncd vvv-local/www/\nmkdir my-new-project\ncd my-new-project\ngit init\n...\nIn the www/my-new-project/ directory would live an entire project setup, including additional provisioning for the VVV environment, the WordPress (or other PHP project) installation, and the hosts information for VVV to pick up.\nFor both setup's it seems to make sense to include WP as a submodule in the working folder.\nAgreed, and I often follow this model on a project by project basis.\nI would much rather add VVV to a project as submodule this just feel the right way to do this\nI think this is entirely possible, though it is definitely stretching the bounds of the primary goals that VVV is striving toward.\nYes to the common WP_CONTENT_DIR through I would like to be-able to move outside the the VVV so that I can see that I have the latest version of VVV\nA slightly crazy way to go about this would be to mount an additional directory from your local machine in the virtual machine. ~/my-plugins-dir/ could be mapped to /srv/www/my-plugins-dir/ and any WordPress project could be told about that directory. Though this also falls in line with stretching the bounds of primary goals.\nI hope this makes sense\nIt absolutely does, and thank you for thinking out these various scenarios. It's tough to find that line between unique development environment and something that can fit as part of a grander scope.\n. Closing this out, but feel free to continue the discussion.\n. Closing this out, but feel free to continue the discussion.\n. I have no idea why GitHub had to give a second issue number to this PR. Sorry.\nHa, I think that ever time. No worries. I haven't done it personally, but if you use hub you can convert issues to PRs if you have commit access on a repository.\n. That shouldn't be a mistake. VVV will only add/remove domains that it has added before (I think). I'll take a stab at testing this out a bit more soon.\n. @ccondrup Do you have the same issues with one of the default domains in VVV? I just installed PressBackup for the first time in local.wordpress-trunk.dev and it had no troubles verifying compatibility and creating a backup.\nI'm wondering if there is a domain misconfiguration somewhere in the project files for the custom site?\n. I'd rather leave this one out. Most WordPress sites (AFAIK) should not require directory listings and we should assume that the configs here may be copied around. I do think this can be accounted for on the individual site level if necessary for a specific project.\n. @TheLastCicada I think an nginx-custom.conf would be better suited for custom projects and handled through the project's nginx config rather than by VVV. If the default environments provided by VVV start needing permanent customization by an individual, a custom site is probably the best move.\n. Closing this out. Thanks for the proposal, @ericandrewlewis, keep em coming.\n. Twiddles thumbs and hits the Merge button... ;)\n. If you can access the VM via IP from another machine, then you're actually in a really good place. All you would need to do is add a hosts entry on the other machine for local.wordpress.dev to point to 192.168.50.4 (by default) so that it is aware of the name/IP relationship.\nIf you can't access the VM via IP from another machine, then there are other network issues at play. The easiest way around is likely to use the public_network option rather than the static private_network that we configure by default. See - http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/networking/public_network.html\n. Good catch, thanks @sunnyratilal!\n. Something along these lines is definitely part of the roadmap. See #210\n. I think I had this a couple times, but I don't remember the scenario. Does it happen every time you run vagrant up?\nI would consider upgrading to Vagrant 1.4.2 (1.4.3 is on its way as well) to see if it resolves the issue.\n. For comparison, I just checked out VVV and issued vagrant up from scratch.\n- With xdebug_on, http://local.wordpress-trunk.dev/?XDEBUG_PROFILE loads in ~2 seconds and the data is available at http://vvv.dev/webgrind/.\n- With xdebug_off, http://local.wordpress-trunk.dev/?XDEBUG_PROFILE loads without an issue.\nMy system setup: OSX 10.9, Vagrant 1.4.2, VirtualBox 4.3.6\nI had to run vagrant up couple of times and clone the repository in different folders until I managed to get it working\nIt may also be worth opening VirtualBox to see if any rogue VMs are started. If multiple Vagrant instances are running on this IP, some strange issues could occur.\n. @antorome I missed the question at the end of your last comment. The system PHP config will not conflict with PHP inside of Vagrant at all. Those environments are completely separate.\nDid installing from scratch help at all?\n. Thanks, @andrezrv!\nIntroduced in fa05811f3.\n. Thanks, @andrezrv!\nIntroduced in fa05811f3.\n. I expect nothing less. :)\n. I expect nothing less. :)\n. @DavidSteinbauer What OS and versions of Vagrant / Virtualbox are you using?\nI have some recollection of something similar to this happening to me once, but I was never able to reproduce it. Was almost like everything timed out all of a sudden and vagrant-hostsupdater decided to fire.\nIt may be worth uninstalling vagrant-hostsupdater temporarily to see if that resolves the issue as well.\n. I don't have any issues with this. I'm a fan of tar personally and would be super annoyed if it wasn't there. :)\nThanks, @andrezrv!\n. Hmm. I may have seen something implying that phpunit 3.8 is out, but it's still in beta. Looks like stable is expected in March. We can probably plan on upgrading to PHP 5.5, phpunit 3.8, and WordPress 3.9 all at the same time.\n. I renamed this issue as phpunit 4.0 has been released. May be worth playing with this and seeing how or if the core unit tests are affected.\n. Thanks @enejb!\n. A good model for keeping some things straight is to maintain a local config and remote config that wp-config.php uses depending on the environment.\nSee WordPress Skeleton for an example of having the remote configuration stored in wp-config.php with a local-config.php that's used in development to specify different DB settings.\nI'm working with a similar model in WSUWP Platform that uses both a local-config.php and a remote-config.php. This allows us to make the entire project public while storing the remote-config.php elsewhere for deployment.\nBy working with multiple configs like this, there ends up being no need to change anything on deploy.\n. I gave it a shot using the local folder setting so that things don't necessarily need to be deployed. I got past the _intellij_phpunit_launcher.php issues, but now it fails because it's not able to find phpunit in the include dirs. Haven't found the proper way to change those from the outside.\nAnother option is probably using the new Vagrant controls (PHPStorm 7) to SSH into the box and run phpstorm from the command line there. I haven't yet tried that either though.\n. Oh! I should note that to get it further with the local folder setting, I had to setup a new tests.wordpress-develop.dev domain that pointed to the wordpress-develop directory rather than the src or tests directory so that it could properly \"deploy\" the phpunit.xml.dist file.\n. This could probably get a revisit now that PHPUnit 4.0.x is being installed. Always a chance that something got easier.\n. This could probably get a revisit now that PHPUnit 4.0.x is being installed. Always a chance that something got easier.\n. I tried so hard to get this working last week. And failed again.\n. @rhurling thanks for sharing those articles, that did the trick!\nI ran into some differences with PHPStorm 9 and my configuration, so I wrote them up here. I'm going to close this issue out with the knowledge that it's possible. :+1: \n. The best option now is either change the configuration of one of the included WordPress installations with define( 'WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE', true ); so that you can go through the multisite installation, or to add something like @lkwdwrd's auto site setup to handle it automatically on provisioning.\n. Hey @adamsilverstein! Many thanks for the PR.\nI use multisite more often than not when I'm in VVV, and I often have the need for both configurations, so at some level this makes a lot of sense. I'm still leaning toward my reasoning in https://github.com/10up/varying-vagrant-vagrants/issues/203#issuecomment-28411982 for now \u2013 I think the Auto Site Setup stuff is perfect for this because of how modular and on demand it is. Modules could then be provided for Trunk Multisite, Stable Multisite, Develop Multisite, etc...\nI've been thinking about how VVV as a project could offer some of these modular setups without them being included with the primary repository. I'm going to see if we can start moving toward that.\nLet's leave this unmerged for now and see if we can go another route in the near future.\n. Hi @prasenjithaty! You can use portions of provision.sh to setup the required software on your server, though certain things may fail due to a lack of shared folders, etc.\nYou may find this thread on the WordPress and Vagrant group useful. Some similar concepts are covered there.\n. Hi @mastef, thanks for stopping in!\nDocker is a very interesting tool. I do think it fits a scenario very different from the environment provided by VVV's use of Vagrant. From my perspective, using Docker would be ideal when working with a very specific environment, not necessarily when supporting a range of uses.\nOne of our goals with VVV is to make the server configuration approachable as a guide to developers while providing a flexible environment for working on plugins, themes, and WordPress core. The ability to add custom setups to this goes a long way as well.\n. It's definitely intriguing, and I'll admit being a complete beginner when it comes to Docker\u2013I've never actually used it. Some of my wariness may be due to my unfamiliarity with what a Docker image actually looks like.\nI guess my main question here would be: Does adding Docker images make the project more or less approachable for developers that want to modify the default configuration for their own needs?\n. Thanks for the info, @mastef. This is great reading.\nWould this required hosting the image somewhere or would the Docker image be built on the first vagrant up?\nIf I wanted to make changes to provisioning, would that work with vagrant provision, or would I need to destroy first?\n. I have been looking at Docker and it seemed to me the killer use case would be to create separate containers for testing against different versions of php.\nThat would be amazing.\nThat way you just pull the latest cached/built containers, instead of rebuilding them on each boot.\nThis is where I think the shell provisioning serves us well. Small changes can be made by those using the project to fit their needs without worrying about creating additional Docker configurations.\nI think this falls a bit in line with my reasoning for avoiding a proper provisioner. While it's a fantastic technical answer for this type of thing for individual projects, the community benefits from having only the hurdles of Vagrant + shell to learn. At the same time, I use a provisioner in my day to day work because it's amazing.\nI'd be very interested in seeing a proof of concept in a pull request or fork that used Docker. I don't think I could be confident until seeing that on how it would or would not make sense as part of VVV's ongoing development.\n. I don't doubt you at all, and I will! :)\n. I'm thinking of starting a VVV-Docker (or other aptly named) project under the Varying Vagrant Vagrants organization with yet to be determined goals.\n@mastef @TheLastCicada @lkwdwrd - would you all be on board to work under that space?\n. Nice! I'm going to fire up that repository and give you three commit access to it. Feel free to use the issues over there to come up with a plan of approach or just commit what you have to run with it.\nNo worries if it isn't directly compatible with VVV itself right away. It's best if a proper Docker workflow is established instead before we concern ourselves with that.\n. We're live over at http://github.com/varying-vagrant-vagrants/vvv-docker\n. Most definitely. Might be worth creating multiple branches for approach comparison. Then they can be deleted or merged as need be.\n. Hi @berberich, I just ran through this portion of provisioning and had no trouble with SVN.\nIt's possible there was some quality issue with your connection to core.svn.wordpress.org. I could also see there being a random issue with the network adapter in the virtual machine.\nWhat versions of Vagrant and VirtualBox do you have installed?\n. Hey @colorful-tones, thanks for the report! Reaching out with the Issue is the perfect for this scenario.\nI will point out that the original language is actually valid, though possibly confusing in the wording. We were worried about instabilities caused by the major rewrites done by VirtualBox in their 4.3. VVV didn't go through a major change at that time.\nI'm going to leave it as is, but I'm definitely open to better wording around that.\n. Good to hear! Let us know if you run into anything else. :)\n. @dwainm This is a great question and one of the tougher scenarios to deal with. As @westonruter (VVV expert) mentioned, the limitation is on the mobile device rather than VVV.\nI can imagine a couple scenarios for a custom setup:\n1. If you have an iPhone and a Mac, you can load the site via Safari (and possibly Chrome now?) and Webkit on your phone.\n2. Configure Nginx to send dev.[ip address].xip.io to the site you are debugging.\n3. Configure Nginx to send 192.168.50.4 to the site you are debugging.\n4. Setup a DNS server, possibly through router firmware, that directs local traffic. Tomato\nIf there is something specific we can do in VVV to ease one of these processes, we should try. Documentation is probably the best bet.\n. Whoa, xip.io seems like magic. We should definitely think about adding that in to the default configs.\n. Success! Redirects appear to be working fine. :+1: \n. Hi @jacklenox! That may be the first time I've that specific error. What OS are you on and what version of Vagrant are you running?\nIf it happens again, I'd take a look at the VirtualBox GUI to see what machines are running and if it gives away any detail.\n. Hey @Jaace! Good to see you got things sorted out. Feel free to ask anything else as it comes up.\n. Hey @Jaace, sorry it took a few days to catch up.\nThese components don't use many resources when installed in production. The only thing that stands out is xdebug. You would probably want to make sure your configuration - xdebug.ini - was set in a way that did not do anything strange in production.\nI'll often include Git or subversion in production, but not phpunit. It is fairly easy to remove from provisioning by commenting out the lines that are installing things.\nFor managing a production server alongside a development server, you may find yourself gravitating toward some kind of state/config management package like Salt, Puppet, or Chef sooner than later. Bash works for a bit and is a good stepping stone, but those tools get very powerful.\n. @josiahsprague Any chance that Safari is using a proxy that Chrome isn't set to use?\nI've had trouble in Chrome before by using src.wordpress-develop.dev instead of http://src.wordpress-develop.dev. Without the http://, it assumed I was trying to search during the first attempt. Never any trouble with a browser not seeing the domain though.\n. @josiahsprague It may be worth checking out Dnsmasq. I've been meaning to, but never got around to it. Now that I read the intro again, I might check it out sooner than later. :)\n. Yep, this was fixed in VVV core via 0e01f9ec08. As @cjs mentions, other scripts will have to be modified with the new argument as well. I'll make sure the wiki article is adjusted.\n. We're limiting to 50MB in two places right now, nginx.conf and php-custom.ini.\nI'd be willing to bump that limit up higher if need be. Seems like there doesn't need to be much of an upper bound for local development. If these configs made their way to production, then things could get weird.\n. Sorry @shaneholloman, missed this the other day.\n/etc/nginx/ should have nginx.conf and /etc/php5/fpm/conf.d/ has php-custom.ini.\nBoth files can be edited in the VVV config directory so that subsequent provisions won't erase those changes.\nDoes anybody have reason for these limits to not be 1GB in VVV? I think if we comment those sections in the configs it would work as caution for anybody copying them to production. And 1GB isn't as uncommon as it used to be anyway. :)\n. See #599 for related/duplicate. We're going to bump the upload limit there.\n. Ooh, I dig this. Good call, and thanks for the patch!\n. Thanks, @salcode!\n. Hey @berberich, thanks for the report.\nBecause the phpMyAdmin files end up in a directory that is mapped locally via VirtualBox, file permission changes inside the VM won't work.\nDoes phpMyAdmin work anyway or is this preventing anything from happening? I'm ok with things being world writeable in a development situation.\n. @berberich Sorry to leave you hanging. I just tested again and can't reproduce locally on OSX. I'm wondering if it's an issue with the way the drive is mounted in Windows.\nWhat is the output of this?\n- vagrant ssh\n- ls -lrt /srv/www/default/database-admin/\nI'm trying to get a handle on what user/group/permissions are set inside the VM.\n. @berberich Sorry to leave you hanging.

Hey @salcode, thanks for the pull request!\nI'm still trying to wrap my head around the possibilities that we have for managing log files. Part of me wants to leave it as is and allow for custom scripting to modify how logs are handled once they land. I'm not entirely sure if saving them to /tmp/ is still the right answer.\n@danielbachhuber - do you have more insight on /tmp/ as the location for php_errors.log via #69?\nAlso related: #102 \n. I'm coming around. :)\nIn #278, @salcode has the php error log going to www/default/logs/. I'm thinking this is a pretty good spot. It would allow custom scripting to easily pull that data in and makes it pretty accessible on the host machine.\nWe should be able to do the same with any other logs - nginx, xdebug, anything else?\n. In rethinking this, a /logs/ directory in VVV root may make more sense than www. If the primary use case will be to access the logs on the host machine, not through some yet to be built interface on the guest machine, then another mapped directory is good.\nI think I'm going to pull @salcode's #278 into a feature branch to start down this path.\n. Thanks all! We have a new mapped /srv/log directory via #278 and a few other commits\n. Thanks @salcode! This was merged with a few other commits in 43f20ac41e14b1bbc73bd02f312051a24e4f01e3\n. Good catch, thanks!\n. Hey @Tarendai, thanks for stopping by.\nI've noticed very sporadic issues with DNS as well. In other projects, I've included a resolve.conf to provide Google DNS to the VM. I'd definitely be up for adding this to VVV. I guess the only caution is that I've run into instances where Google's DNS has not worked due to some network restriction. I wonder if that's common enough to warrant a concern or we can ignore.\n. @westonruter With magic. ;)\nFrom what I understand (and from what seems to work), providing this dhclient-enter-hooks file prevents resolv.conf from being overwritten\nNote that this is in CentOS, I'm not sure if it's handled the same in Ubuntu.\n. It's possible that this type of issue will be handled by #347 via #327 now that we're proxying DNS. Let's leave the resolv.conf fix out and see how this goes.\n. Hmm, that's strange. Was this first time you had ever tried vagrant up with VVV? I could see this happening if the database was setup initially somehow.\nYou should be able to use phpMyAdmin via http://192.168.50.4/database-admin/ to drop the database. vagrant provision can be used to go through provisioning again.\n. The databases for each installation persist through a vagrant destroy as they are stored locally. This is something I'd like to change as it goes against the purpose of destroy vs halt a bit.\nRelated #213\n. @shaneholloman - the config @cfoellmann points to should help add a custom version.\nThe default nginx configs are setup to handle subdomains as well. If you go through the network configuration process for WordPress, it should just work.\nDo note that any extra domains added will need to make their way to your local machine's hosts file. This is something that can be added to a vvv-hosts file or manually inputted.\n. @shaneholloman - the config @cfoellmann points to should help add a custom version.\nThe default nginx configs are setup to handle subdomains as well.

If we use composer on the dev-STABLE version of phpMyAdmin, it seems like we need to wait for that git reference to be figured out, checked out, etc.\nThis pulls from the STABLE branch of the phpMyAdmin project, which is available in zip form at all times here: https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/archive/STABLE.zip\nWe can grab that, which gets other stuff like tests that won't matter much. It's not immediately obvious whether the \"all languages\" package that we download now is available.\n.

I'm a little annoyed by the excess directories created, but can get over that. :)\n. So, I'm less in favor of this now. It would be cool to see a patch that does it right, but Composer is just so unfriendly to me. ;)\n. A latest-all-languages.tar.gz would be nice from them. :)\nI like the idea of sticking with a compressed download file, as the time to clone can be a bit annoying. We could grab your master.zip, though I still like the idea of using official sources.\n. I'm thinking we should stick with the by hand approach for now. Upgrades don't happen too frequently and when they do happen, it only affects new instances of VVV or those who proactively delete the files before provision. Let's revisit this at a later time if a better solution appears.\n. This may deserve another look. After poking at #1012, which I'm going to close in a minute, there are a couple things we should answer before proceeding:\n\nWill composer create-project phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin:4.6.* database-admin --repository-url=https://www.phpmyadmin.net/packages.json --no-dev work when there's an existing database-admin/ directory?\nHow can this be configured to update whenever vagrant provision is run?\n\nOnce we have some conclusions on that approach, then the PR will need to be created against the VVV Utilities repository, which is part of the new provisioning process.. Thanks for the report @cbrunnkvist!\nWe do have a custom init script that should take care of MySQL after vagrant halt, but I'm not sure how it handles the initial boot. I do think things will get easier once we stop using persistent databases as we won't be racing to mount/start services. Fingers crossed for #213.\nI'll do some testing in a bit to duplicate the issue and toss that line in.\n. I just checked out a fresh copy of master and did an initial vagrant up. All services are a go for me. \nI also did a vagrant halt and vagrant up after the initial boot and services are working properly there.\nIs there a chance that something failed during the initial provisioning? There may be an error we can detect.\n. @kraftner @cfoellmann @obenland (and anyone else having this trouble)\n- Does MySQL fail to start after halting the VM with vagrant halt and then bringing it back up with vagrant up? Or is this vagrant up from scratch or after vagrant destroy?\n- Every time, or sporadically?\n- What OS / VirtualBox version / Vagrant version?\n- How long does vagrant up take after a vagrant halt?\nThis sounds so much like it used to be before we got the right init scripts in the for MySQL. The entire thing is hacky though. I'm guessing that some of this goes away once we stop worrying about persistent database data, but it would still be cool to figure out so that nobody has to run vagrant provision each time. :)\n. @kraftner @cfoellmann @obenland (and anyone else having this trouble)\n- Does MySQL fail to start after halting the VM with vagrant halt and then bringing it back up with vagrant up?

Great hunting @andrezrv! I just modified .gitattributes to force unix line endings on conf files as well. This could help the issue.\n. This finally happened for me just now. :+1:\n. This finally happened for me just now. :+1:\n. Making progress today in the VVV database branch on PR #322. By removing our reliance on a persistent database connection, we can avoid these timing issues.\nvagrant ssh -c \"sudo service mysql start\" is probably the least annoying way of starting MySQL from the host in the meantime and should hopefully avoid the need to do a full re-provision.\n. Ok. As of today, #322 has been merged into master and MySQL data will no longer be mapped locally. This clears up the issue where MySQL is not available after a halt, as we no longer need to be hacky about detecting when the drive is mapped before starting the service.\nA few things about the latest master:\n- Your best bet is a full destroy and up to reprovision with the new Ubuntu box.\n- Delete everything except for readme.txt in the /database/data/ directory if you don't want persistent databases. Backup your data first if you want it.\n- Install the vagrant-triggers plugin for backups of the database to be created automatically on every halt and destroy.\n. This is tough. I do want to find a way.\nTheoretically with a grain of salt in the current form.... :)\n1. vagrant destroy\n   - This deletes the VM and sets things up to be re-provisioned in Ubuntu 14.04\n2. Pull latest VVV version\n3. Install vagrant-triggers plugin.\n4. vagrant up\n   - Because your existing mapped MySQL data continues to live in database/data/, your databases will persist in the new VVV.\n5. vagrant destroy\n   - The vagrant-triggers plugin will run the new script to backup the existing databases.\n6. Delete all of your files from database/data/ OR rename the one file we check for in provisioning.\n7. vagrant up\n   - We'll now import the backed up SQL files into the fresh installation of MySQL that is not mapped to your local machine.\nPhew...\nMore testing is definitely required. I'd be very careful at the moment with data you don't want to lose. It would be worth using phpMyAdmin to backup everything if you're more familiar with that.\n. Haha, you caught me being lazy. :)\nIf database/data/mysql_upgrade_info exists, we mount the database drive. An easy way to flip back and forth is to rename that to mysql_upgrade_info.old or something.\nThese databases do need to be defined in init-custom.sql for them to be added automatically during provisioning. We may need to look into how this works with external auto site setups.\n. This is a common scenario with Virtualbox/Vagrant if the virtual machine is not halted properly before the laptop sleeps. I haven't heard of the issue when vagrant halt is used before sleeping.\n. +1 to everything @jonathanbardo said.\nWill VVV get there? It would be awesome to have a new developer environment that is simple to use (even for a designer like myself) and has a good UI.\nThere's always a chance, though it's not necessarily on the roadmap. I have seen mention of a GUI being a possible feature in a future release of Vagrant itself. This would go a long way in managing the various states of the virtual machine in a friendlier matter.\nI will say that once the initial setup is complete, there are only a handful of commands necessary to use this from the command line. Everything else can be done through your editor as normal.\n. I'm guessing this is due to the npm SSL issue. We probably need to verify how npm/node/grunt is installed inside the VM. http://blog.npmjs.org/post/78165272245/more-help-with-self-signed-cert-in-chain-and-npm\n@dennis7742 The messaging in that error is \"local\" to the virtual machine, not to your computer. There is no need to install grunt locally. We should be able to get a fix for this in shortly.\nThanks for the report!\n. Ok, so this actually works on a fresh build of VVV. Likely because the new installation of npm comes without the self signed certs.\nA couple things that could fix this.\n1. vagrant destroy followed by vagrant up. This will retain all files and databases but destroy all server software and config. Having the machine go through provisioning again should cause the newest npm to install.\n2. A series of commands to reinstall nodejs (and npm) by removing and then reprovisioning:\n   - vagrant ssh\n   - sudo apt-get purge nodejs (purge is required to remove config files)\n   - exit\n   - vagrant provision\n. @dennis7742 Is it possible that the WordPress core Gruntfile.js is missing from www/wordpress-develop?\n@n1smo Are you getting this error with the most recent version of VVV?\n. I'm going to see if I can test this a bit locally to reproduce. Has anyone had success with running vagrant provision multiple times until it works? I'm wondering if the NPM server is not doing well at responding or if there's something we can do to improve the connection on our end.\n. @Sgoettschkes thanks for taking a look! It is difficult to track things down in VVV at times. Re proper provisioning, my thoughts in https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/258#issuecomment-32822440 explain that a bit.\n\nI think this falls a bit in line with my reasoning for avoiding a proper provisioner. While it's a fantastic technical answer for this type of thing for individual projects, the community benefits from having only the hurdles of Vagrant + shell to learn. At the same time, I use a provisioner in my day to day work because it's amazing.\n\n@franz-josef-kaiser Your local Grunt should never run due to VVV. The \"local\" that provisioning is referring to here is inside the VM. Likely it had trouble installing at some point during provisioning. I would think that a repeat vagrant provision would help here, but it's tough to catch the errors.\n. Great to hear, @dennis7742! Thanks for sticking with it.\n. Dig it, good call! I submitted a PR against your branch to change the language and the blame a bit.\n. Looks good, let's do it. Thanks @aaronjorbin!\n. Nice, good tip @aubreypwd!\n. Nice, good tip @aubreypwd!\n. Oh, hi there. :clap: \n. Gah! I read that paragraph 15 times and happily skipped over that sentence.\nThanks for stopping my insanity. :)\n. Gah! I read that paragraph 15 times and happily skipped over that sentence.\nThanks for stopping my insanity. :)\n. Thanks, @mattbanks, this makes sense.\nI think leaving the default bash_prompt file out would be good. Instead, we should check for the existence of a custom bash prompt file and then copy if found. This makes it easier to manage your custom prompt without conflicting with upstream changes.\n. And we're good to go. I made a couple tweaks to only copy the file if it exists. Thanks @mattbanks!\n. Hey @mattbanks, sorry for letting this hang. Looks great to me, tossing it in. Thanks!\n. This may be a case of us not being prepped for Vagrant 1.5 yet. I haven't upgraded myself, but it's possible that there is a back-compat issue. @dovy What versions of Vagrant and VirtualBox do you have installed?\n. Also, agreed with @iandunn in that it does sound like DNS for the actual error message.\n. Closing this out as a DNS fluke. @dovy, please feel free to reopen if the issue is still occurring.\n. This 502 may be related to #353 and #363 as well. Those should disappear after #364 is merged in, which may help this in some way.\n. Going to close this out with a pointer to #820.\n. I'm a little wary of this. Is it something that can be solved with your global .gitignore?\nThe VVV site wizard instructions also mention:\nTo run the script from anywhere, open the file and uncomment the line at the top defining path. Set that to the root folder of VVV on your machine.\nThat could be a more ideal path.\n. Hey @weskoop, sorry for not chiming in here earlier.\nI went through a fresh vagrant up today with Vagrant 1.5.2 and everything appeared fine. I'm wondering if this could have been a wp-cli related issue at the time since we're pulling from that master branch.\nI'm wondering if it may make sense for us to attach to a specific wp-cli version in default provisioning. Need to think out how that might work with those who also want to contribute to wp-cli development.\n. Yes. Any domains that nginx needs to serve with that configuration should be specified for the server_name directive:\nserver_name mymainsite.dev mysecondsite.dev mythirdsite.dev;\nOr, if there's a pattern:\nserver_name *site.dev;\n. Yes. Any domains that nginx needs to serve with that configuration should be specified for the server_name directive:\nserver_name mymainsite.dev mysecondsite.dev mythirdsite.dev;\nOr, if there's a pattern:\nserver_name *site.dev;\n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. Agreed, it would be great to split things up a bit. I'll take a look at @cfoellmann's PR as it's likely in the right direction. See also #210.\nFor the immediate future, you can hack it a bit by creating directories for each installation before provisioning. This will skip the main creation of the sites, though may cause some errors to display during provisioning. Ugly, but something. :)\n. It is now possible to disable the provisioning of sites after the merge of #980. :tada:\n. This definitely seems related to #290, and grunt not firing properly during the provisioning of the wordpress-develop directory. The local error is a bit misleading, as the intent is to use the VM's installation of grunt on the Gruntfile.js checked out in wordpress-develop.\nI'm going to close this issue out in the hopes we can narrow down what's going on in #290.\n. I haven't had a chance to thoroughly test Vagrant 1.5.1 yet. I have run into this issue with plugins randomly in the past, and it's extremely annoying (and not always reproducible). The only solution that I remember is to live without the plugin until I try again with a later version. :)\n. Hey @thewebists. I just tried this out on my install and was able to access http://vvv.dev with xdebug on and off. I'm not exactly sure what could be causing this. Did you have anything listening to the remote debug port at that time?\n. Twiddles thumbs waiting for 2.2.4 to hit apt so we don't have to hardcode it... ;)\nBut really\u2014I'll take a closer look at this. Is there a way to use pecl to install the latest package of something?\n. VVV master now installs XDebug with PECL rather than through apt. The latest stable is now 2.2.5, which I'm hoping resolves the issue as well.\nI'm going to close this out for now. Do reopen if it remains. It's also worth looking at the CHANGELOG before using master as some other big changes have been made today.\nThanks for tracking this down, @GaryJones!\n. Hey @lenkutchma, thanks for the report!\nThe script we use to start MySQL on vagrant up after a halt is such a wonderful hack. :) My guess is that something has changed in either Vagrant or VirtualBox or MySQL that's not doing so well with the starting of services after the mounting of drives.\nI'm going to close this issue out as it is directly related to the conversation in #287. I do have ideas for where to go next here, and I'll drop the comments over there.\n. @tony-wips / @lenkutchma - you can do all in one with vagrant ssh -c \"sudo service mysql start\" from the host machine.\nMy guess is that #322 didn't work because of persistent MySQL data in your VVV directory. If the database/data/mysql_upgrade_info is detected locally, VVV will continue to mount the save shared drive for MySQL. Changing course may require a full vagrant destroy and vagrant up after removing the local copy of the MySQL data.\n. I'm definitely leaning toward separate repos for each of the sites. The Apache use case is a perfect example of how that could be useful.\n. We could probably avoid submodules by having provisioning in the main repository pull down tagged versions via zip in the other repositories.\n. This is great stuff @cfoellmann. I think we can focus on getting this together as soon as 1.2 is shipped, which shouldn't come too much longer after the licensing is sorted. I'm going to experiment with this PR and separate repositories over the next couple weeks locally.\n. Definitely still on the table. A most important next step. :)\n. Definitely still on the table. A most important next step. :)\n. Scaffolding is definitely tempting for the future as a built in command. It can probably live here for now - https://github.com/bradp/vv - as that seems to accomplish things well for those who need it.\nI think these steps are likely for the immediate future:\n- Break existing VVV core sites out into individual repositories.\n- Swap provisioning for these sites in provision.sh by pulling the repo and firing vvv-init.sh.\n- Provide a way to configure which of these sites is setup by default.\n- Apply this to other repositories.\nI also like @iandunn's point about pulling in a collection of scripts. This all deserves a bunch of thought.\nI'm going to find time this weekend to go through a couple things here and get other repositories setup. We can then start making some progress with PRs pretty quickly.\n. I just did a fresh vagrant up on OSX with Vagrant 1.5.2 and VirtualBox 4.3.10 and all is good. A vagrant halt followed by a vagrant up worked as well, with no MySQL issues.\nDB data is no longer persistent, so if vagrant destroy is used or the VM is lost/corrupted somehow, it will disappear. I'm going to explore some snapshot methods. At the very least, we can probably include a bash script that dumps all databases and another that imports them.\n. Initial tests with vagrant-vbox-snapshot are making me happy. :)\n. Snapshots do not work once a box is destroyed as they are still tied to the VM instance, so this really only helps if your original box is still up/halted.\n. ae53361 introduces support for vagrant-triggers. Right now it only performs an action on vagrant halt\u2014and that action is empty :)\u2014but actions for destroy and suspend will soon follow.\n. In d5f433a, you can now include executable files such as config/homebin/vagrant_halt_custom that will be executed when the related Vagrant commands are issued. We should include some default DB related stuff, but anything is possible outside of that.\n. I'm going to go in the direction of providing default DB backups only if a custom script does not exist. If a custom script is added, then we'll assume it is handling DB backups on its own. If nothing else, the defaults can be copied to this new custom file if they need to run in addition. This way we aren't stomping on or defining any workflows too strictly.\n. Just tested this again with a full, from scratch vagrant up after a vagrant destroy created backup files. Databases imported as expected. :+1:\n. \nBecause everyone wants to look at a screenshot before I merge this in a day or two... :)\n. I'll do a better overall writeup later. For now, I'm going through the process of converting another machine and I'm taking notes. This is moving a powered off virtual machine to a non persistent DB. If you're starting in a destroyed state, the second set won't be necessary.\nvagrant halt\ncd vvv-dir/database/data/\nrm -fr *\ngit checkout readme.txt\nvagrant up\nAt this point, MySQL is horribly broken because we surprised it by taking the directory away.\nvagrant ssh\nsudo rm /etc/php5/fpm/pool.d/www.conf\nsudo apt-get remove mysql-server-5.5 mysql-client-5.5 mysql-common php5-mysql\nsudo apt-get purge mysql-server-5.5 mysql-client-5.5 mysql-common php5-mysql\nexit\nvagrant provision\nHeads up, the above doesn't work that great, but it is close. The conversion process sucks. I ended up destroying so I could start over. I'll revisit at some point soon.\n. This will go in this weekend, you've been warned. ;-)\n. And it's on. Master can probably be considered slightly more unstable than usual for the near future between this and #335.\n. Hmm, that workflow may be even harder. :)\nI guess this could just be the necessary annoyance of working in the bounds of GitHub. Which isn't really too hard considering all of the other great things.\nMaybe rather than bolding _anyone_, we could stress that ongoing contributions are welcome and regular contributors will find themselves with write access to be handled responsibly?\n. Oooh. I like that. Definitely worth pondering for a bit.\n. Hi @henscu! Are there any more details with the net::ERR_INCOMPLETE_CHUNKED_ENCODING error that appears? Some examples I can find show the last GET request that was attempted. It's possible this is due to a specific type of request and can help track down the issue.\n. This may be worth adding to Vagrantfile, I haven't seen those settings yet. I've had the same trouble lately when bouncing between a couple networks.\n. Sweet, that's good to know! I just pushed the nat DNS settings via #347 to master. I'm going to leave memory at 512MB for now.\nThanks for that tip @andrezrv and thanks for verifying @shaneholloman.\n. It will work as long as that directory is already ignored by the repository above it, which our .gitignore handles for this scenario.\n. Hi @clov3r, I am not able to reproduce this issue in Chrome 34 on OSX 10.9.2, though it seems that something similar was reported on the Chromium bug tracker - https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=343970\n. If I'm reading the docs correctly, a merge commit is automatically created and its commit message automatically inserted when --no-edit is used.\nWhat would the workflow be to recover from that on a feature branch?\n. That makes sense. I was about to say we should skip the pull if not on master, but then I looked at your PR again. :)\nIt would be really cool if we could detect that a merge was made and notify somehow. That's probably for a different day.\nAlso - this actually creates a nice little hack to avoid the check on every provision. Just checkout a new branch.\n. Mergin. Thanks, @westonruter!\n. I think what @DrewAPicture mentioned is key here. It appears that phpunit is being called from the local host machine rather than inside the VM. Because of this, the database of localhost would be pointed toward the host at 127.0.0.1. Changing it to local.wordpress.dev uses the host machines hosts file to resolve the address to 192.168.50.4 correctly.\n. @Tarendai, this looks fantastic! Thanks for the PR.\nI'm going to leave this hanging for a bit to roll some ideas around.\nI like the idea of a styled dashboard, and I love the idea of it automatically pulling in the configured sites. I'm not entirely sold on including the Bootstrap code in the repository, but that's an easy thing to solve.\nI've been thinking about how we can extend this dashboard to include other VVV documentation, likely as Markdown in a docs/ directory, though that deserves a discussion of its own. We may be okay to start with this version and then replace the wiki link with local docs when we're ready.\nThoughts from others?\n. I also don't like the idea of loading anything via CDN, mostly because VVV works so well offline and I want it to stay that way.\nDitto.\nI think we can definitely pull the latest minimized bootstrap during provisioning rather than including in the repo or pulling via CDN.\n. As we're exploring dashboard options, @topdown's VVV-Dashboard looks interesting as well.\n. Leaving the same comment from #609, sorry for taking so long to fully address this.\n\nI love all these custom dashboards, so much great stuff. I'd rather not tie VVV directly into any of them at the moment. I think what we have is basic and ugly, and that's fine. I can definitely see adding a section in the README (more visible than the wiki) with a list of dashboards similar to our helpful extensions section. It may even make sense to add a small note to the default dashboard to make it more obvious that something custom can be installed.\nI'm absolutely okay to make any changes that make it easier to distribute a custom dashboard, though it seems like the current model works pretty well.\n. I think we should definitely try 64. I've been running 64bit CentOS in another setup just fine for a while now.\nWe used precise64 at the beginning \u2014 b4465c6d3b1 \u2014 and then I have this great commit message explaining the shift to precise32 in 113e359a527:\n\nTry the 32bit version of 12.04 for a while and see what happens. Also bump the machine up to 512MB from the default of 360MB.\n\nSo there's that. :)\nSimilar to what @jb510 points out, the decision could have been made based on the memory used by the VM and some perception of slow down at the time.\n. Nice, thanks! I'm definitely ready to bump up to Trusty. I'll give this a spin in the next few days and see if we can get it into master. It would be nice to ditch those custom apt sources.\n. :+1: Thanks for all this @aaroncampbell, I'm going to test and get it into master very soon.\n. Going for it. :)\n. I'm definitely ready to attach to specific downloads of the WP-CLI release rather than checking out master from the repository. Doing this would take out that additional requirement for a bunch to happen through GitHub on the first boot. It would prevent easy development of WP-CLI itself, but that could be corrected quickly by checking out the repo manually.\n@krogsgard Any luck with the custom script? It's a pain, but would definitely narrow some stuff down.\n. Hi @Rashmi-Margani, it seems like this comment was intended for another project's GitHub page. I'm going to close it out. Happy to answer any VVV related questions.\n. I haven't seen this specifically yet. That's really ugly if a full destroy is required.\nI'm crossing my fingers that ditching persistent databases via shared directories solves a few of these MySQL issues (see also #287). I will get #322 in shortly, which makes things so much nicer in the MySQL world.\n. I believe this should act much nicer in the future now that #322 has been merged. If you delete the current persistent DB data and then vagrant destroy && vagrant up, a new machine will provision with Ubuntu 14.04 and non-shared databases. Install the vagrant-triggers plugin for automatic DB backups on halt and destroy.\n. The WordPress config is an interesting point and worth thinking through. I've often wondered the same thing about other config files for nginx, MySQL, etc...\nI've thought about using GPL quite a bit, but I'm hesitant to think about sharing restrictions on a conglomeration of scripts and config files. Overall, I'd probably still lean that way.\nWorth noting in this project space:\n- Salt, Puppet, Chef, and Docker are Apache 2.0\n- Ansible is GPLv3\n- VirtualBox is GPLv2\n- Vagrant is MIT\n. Ok, I'm leaning GPLv2 or later to go with the familiar.\nDoes anybody know how this affects existing forks of VVV? I'd imagine that those inherit the license that existed at the time of the fork. I don't have a problem with that, but don't want to make it difficult on anyone else either.\n. I haven't had a chance to test this yet, but the comments on #349 indicate all is well. Merging on in. Thanks @neilpie!\n. This has been closed via #367 and 35aa0523208086f\n. Thanks for the notes @colinsteinmann! Vagrant 1.6.x has been a bit troublesome. I'm hoping that gets cleaned up shortly as there is some great stuff in it.\n. See also #353. This 5.5.12 upgrade has been super annoying :)\n. Thanks @tnorthcutt! This is great.\nWould you mind adding another commit to uncomment the listen.user and listen.group lines above the mode as well? I'm thinking it's best to be explicit in this case so that another similar issue doesn't appear. I've done that in another production instance and it's working fine.\nThis can be merged as soon as we have that in order.\nThis also fixes #353\n. I no longer trust that they aren't just going to break that listen mode in the next release\nExactly this.\n. Ahh, good call. I missed @johnjamesjacoby's note earlier.\nI'm going to reopen so that we can document this for 1.2 release.\n. Yes. I'm still wrapping my head around whether it's really necessary. I think once we have a license, most of this kind of goes away.\n. @lloydde Agreed. I think once we get the licensing in order, being explicit about that in Contributing.md will be enough.\n. Thanks for the PR @teraphy!\nI've never been good with line endings, which is why I've hesitated here. I'd be happy removing the (old) restriction on just .sh and .conf files, but I want to make sure doing this wouldn't cause another issue somewhere else.\nAnother option could be to explicitly list the files without extensions that are copied to the virtual machine and need proper line ending handling.\n/cc @ericmann\n. See conversation in #438, we're going to merge this in now as it should relieve Windows users. :)\n. Thank you for the contribution, @teraphy! I forgot to ask... we're in the middle of a license decision. Are you okay that your contribution is MIT licensed? See #346 for more info.\n. Hi @Pezzab. I don't see any change in VVV that would have affected a Customfile setup like that. Can you share the line of code that you are using to map the directory? Also, what versions of VirtualBox and Vagrant are you running?\n. Interesting. I wonder if something in 1.6.2 changed around NFS handling?\nGlad to hear it's working!\n. This would be a wonderful improvement.\n- What does it take to build a GUI? Is it tough to do cross-platform (Is Adobe Air still a thing) or would it be better to focus on individual OSes?\n- Apps can easily be broken into new repositories for maintenance\n- What specific parts of VVV would we want to manage beyond vagrants up, halt, suspend, destroy? Virtualbox provides a decent example of what a machine status GUI could start as.\n- And/or... what's MVP here?\n. http://vagrantmanager.com/ looks like an interesting possibility for at least managing the state of the VM.\n. This seems really nice. I like that it would immediately resolve any external scripting issues as well. Thanks @francescolaffi!\nPinging @danielbachhuber / @westonruter - Any thoughts on this being a sane approach?\n. Sweet, let's do it. Thanks @francescolaffi!\n. The great naming of these packages! :)\nMemcached\u2014the service\u2014is installed during provisioning.\nWe install php5-memcache, which provides the PECL memcache extension. This is the most commonly used package (I think) and what Ryan Boren's WordPress plugin Memcached object cache is compatible with. Note the missing \"d\" on the package, but the existence of the \"d\" on the plugin.\nIf you change that to php5-memcached, it will install the PECL memcached extension. This is less common, though I use it on multiple production systems. @tollmanz's plugin, WordPress memcached backend is compatible with this. Note the \"d\" in both the package and the plugin.\nBoth PECL memcache and PECL memcached packages are intended for use with Memcached.\n. This is also an option. :)\n. I haven't seen a full timeout, but I did have one instance with a CentOS box where I swear that Retrying message displayed 20 times before connecting. This messaging seems (?) newer in Vagrant, so I'm wondering if there's been a change it how it makes the connection to VirtualBox.\n@dezinerdudes - what versions of VirtualBox and Vagrant are you using?\n. Is there ever a final error message that appears or does it continue to try connecting?\n. @shivapoudel It sounds like @lkwdwrd had similar issues with trusty32 and trusty64, so I'm not sure going that way would resolve things. Does trusty32 work for you? I know there's another thread where CPU virtualization could be an issue.\n. I just noticed on my home machine that I wasn't getting the same number of Warning: Connection timeout. Retrying... messages as I am on my work machine with VVV. On two halt/up instances, I see the message only once each time, which is acceptable.\nThis may not be a solution for every case, but it's worth looking into\u2013this suggestion on SO sets the v.gui = true flag, which causes VirtualBox to open the console for the machine as it's booting. In some cases, it may be an error with the boot process that is causing the long delay.\nProbably not the answer for those with the same issue on a fresh checkout, but worth checking to see what the output is. I wish I brought my work machine home so that I could have a better answer immediately, but I'll check in the morning.\n. We're okay to remove it. It was very useful when we were mapping the \"empty\" directory before we had the hosts process and a default dashboard in www/default/index.php.\nI did the same search for .gitshow a bit ago and landed on using .gitkeep instead. Sneaky, @lkwdwrd :)\n. This is tough, as /files/ was used by multisite in the past and this config accounts for a scenario where it could still be in use. I'd be okay removing it, but it may affect others that are working with old sites and still have that option enabled.\n. Edit: I'm happy 4.3.8 is stable.\nThis is often the best reason not to change. :)\nWe'd probably be ok recommending 4.3.x at this point. I went through 4.3.8, .10, .12 over the last few months without trouble. Vagrant has been much less stable.\n. This is fixed in latest master. We now recommend 4.3.x.\n. Hi @pmgllc, thanks for the suggestion!\nCompletely agree that Getting Started belongs further up in the document. I think we can plan on getting that change in there before 1.2 is finished.\n. These commits refreshed the README quite a bit. I think we're doing a better job of explaining some basics now. I'm going to close this out, but please reopen if the changes don't make sense.\n. Nice, this could be helpful. When was the run always option added to Vagrant? Do we need to do a minimum version check anywhere?\nI think this will cease to be an issue when there is no persistent database, but for those that choose to keep the database drives mapped, it could still be nice and won't hurt anything overall.\n. Dig it, thanks @kadamwhite!\n. I think it won't reopen because it's a merged pull request.\nThis is really the wrong approach. Instead, sysv-rc-conf should be installed and used to make sure that mysqld starts when a runlevel is triggered.\nIf you can get this to work, please, please do. It definitely is the better approach. One of the (smaller) reasons for the move to non persistent databases is because our init script would finally work. See #287 for some history there.\nThe mysql init hack was originally added in 58ba7cc15. This would try to loop until the drive was mounted before starting the service. It seemed to work for a while, but then got really flaky. For a long time it worked just fine for me while others had sporadic issues.\nI think this would be the same with sys-rc-conf, but I'm not well versed in any of that stuff.\n. @dwainm what version of Vagrant are you on? It appears that this was resolved upstream in 1.5.3 via vagrant:5f12126d from https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/3391\n. Woops :)\nThanks @zamoose!\n. So, is the issue that Vagrant/VVV is setting the port incorrectly?\nI feel like I saw an issue recently with VMs conflicting because of an issue with either VirtualBox or Vagrant. Without sending you on another random chase\u2014what versions of Vagrant/VirtualBox are you using?\n. I'm going to close this out as I believe it's either the same or very related to #375. We can revisit this issue if we need to.\n. Hi @eflynn, thanks for the patch!\nI like this, much cleaner. I'll test it out a bit later and merge it in.\n. @eflynn - thanks again for the patch. We went with the approach in #408 instead to make it a bit easier to manage.\n. I like the idea of versioned backups, though we may need to find another way to do this. We rely on this structure to auto import previous databases if they are available when booting up.\nWe could probably think about always keeping the most recent in this default directory and moving (and gzipping) X number of backups into a date based structure.\n. I'm going to close this out in favor of leaving backups out of core VVV. Custom scripting can definitely take care of this. There's another ticket that will even consider not doing an automated SQL dump at all that we'll want to consider.\n. Hi @iamntz, thanks for the PR!\nI'm not familiar with the issue yet, so I'm going to checkout a fresh box to see what the experience is like. I thought that this portion of bash_profile would take care of that, as it adds the user's home bin to the global path.\n. Is it possible that https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/367 could fix this as well? I haven't yet been sure of the overall implications of that PR.\n. Thanks for the patience here! We changed the line ending handling via .gitattributes in #367 and I'm guessing it will resolve quite a few of these differences. Can you confirm with the latest master?\n. Going to cross my fingers that this was resolved via #367 :)\n. +1, I'm going to look at this a little closer and get it in for 1.2. Thanks!\n. This is actually due to the changes made in https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/383\nIf MySQL is already running, the error is thrown even though everything is fine. We'll need to find a way to silence this as it is very confusing.\n. @westonruter - did #424 end up taking care of this or is there more to do?\n. Hi @thewebists, thanks for the pull request! I just had a chance to test this out and it does fix the installing vs updating check in repeat provisions.\nWe're in a transition toward applying the MIT License to the project. (see #346) Can you confirm that you're ok licensing your contribution as MIT? We're good to merge after that. Thanks!\n. @Shkeats I'm not sure that this is a bug in VVV. From reading through the discussion here it seems like there can sometimes be an issue on the host machine or with the network connection. If it seems like something we can fix in VVV, please open a new issue with a clear list of steps to reproduce. Thanks!. I'm also hoping this was resolved by #367. Please update when you have a chance. Thanks!\n. Hi @mcnitt, thanks for the report!\nAgreed, this is definitely brittle. I don't think there is a specific reason other than it hasn't come up yet. This check has existed since 984c3e7e3d, where even more guesswork around bash was being down than normal. :)\nI think we can improve this by taking everything before .sql instead.\n. Finally came around to this. :)\nDB backup files such as test.domain.com.sql are now supported. I did some basic testing and MySQL seems to handle it fine.\n. Hey @kopepasah, sorry you never got a response to this. :disappointed: \nHopefully everything worked out. If not, please feel free to open another issue or reopen this one.\n. @lloydde thank you for this! I skimmed the other night and will plan on taking a closer look this weekend. Also related - #382 \n. Closed out via these commits. I took @lloydde's proposed changes and maneuvered things around a bit more. Thanks again!\n. +1\nI think the only reason we removed the PPA in the change to Trusty64 was that a more recent version of NPM was available. Definitely okay with moving this back.\n. And #408 is in. Thanks @itsananderson!\n. 1.5 years later... agreed. :)\nThe best way to keep up to date documentation on core development is to point to core's docs, which we do in the README. In the future, it may be nice to have more detailed documentation on how to use some of the debugging tools provided by VVV as part of the process.\n. I had the same error the other day with wp-completion.bash being missing, but didn't dig into it.\n@rtvenge is the wp command available to you? That would be a better indication whether WP-CLI was actually installing.\nI also had the SRV RR errors throughout provisioning, which, as @simonwheatley mentioned, are DNS related warnings. I was on a VPN over shaky wifi, so I assumed that was it. Requests seemed to go through anyway. I don't think it would cause this issue, but you never know.\n. I've never tried adding a Memcached log, but it looks like it can be done with the OPTIONS flag by piping verbose output to a log file. That could be worth it to see what it thinks is going on.\n. Is this worth bumping the memory limit by default?\n. Hi @jonathanbardo. I haven't personally tried PHP 5.6 yet, though I imagine it would be fun to test over the next few months and figure out the right time to upgrade. For history sake, we updated to PHP 5.5 on March 8th, 2014, right about the time of 5.5.10.\n. Closing this and deferring to #834 for a decision between 5.6 and 7.\n. Though on my production stuff I compile nginx, my current reasoning for VVV is that it adds too much overhead. The installation (or upgrade) via apt-get is fast, where building Nginx can take a bit.\nThis may make more sense in an init script that removes the default nginx and compiles a custom version.\n. @cfoellmann Is there any chance that #367 would solve this on a local level rather than in the repo? I'm no good with line endings :)\nAlso - I think the permissions on these files are best left at 0755, it looks like they got changed to 0644 in the commit.\n. Cool, this is good to know. I think merging #367 may be the right answer. I was hesitant at first because I'm not sure if changing the line endings on all the files was a big deal, but it may be ok.\nI'm going to leave this open for now, but merge #367. @cfoellmann, thanks for all your testing!\n. Closing this out, thanks for the work on this, @cfoellmann!\n. Way late thanks for this. :) I've created a tools label to track issues like it.\n.

(see #346) Can you confirm whether you're ok licensing your contribution as MIT? Thanks!\n. @EHLOVader - As of this moment, no more red in the gpg stuff. :)\nThanks again @mirmillo!\n. #450 has been merged into the master branch and should resolve this issue.\n. +1, thanks @salcode. I like the idea of allowing for different IP addresses.\nI think I'm ok with xip.io. Does anyone else have issue? \n. Rockin. :)\n. Nice, good catch. Thanks @jmbarlow!\nWe're in the middle of a licensing update (#346), so nothing official is in the contributing document yet. Are you ok with your contribution being MIT licensed?\n. @hsiboy, thanks for the report. The WordPress download should be resolved in the latest master branch via #350 and #352. #446 will be merged soon and should help the repository key issue.\n. FYI - #446 was just completed via #495. There should be no issue with the gpg signing.\n. Actually, see #450 :)\n. Best enhancement of the year! ;)\nThis can go in once we get the last few votes on #346.\n. #599 will also help this at some point.\n. Thanks for the report @dougmorin, sorry about the trouble. This is related to #428 in that we need a much better way to check for outside Internet availability.\n. Hi @revocer! What version of Vagrant and VirtualBox are you using?\n. Thanks @enejb!\nAfter a separate conversation with @tollmanz and @TheLastCicada earlier, I'm starting to wonder if automatic updates for security releases would be good in VVV. Right now, to avoid issues with network connectivity, we only install packages and do not force upgrades. We should either allow all packages to update every time vagrant provision is run, or specify those packages that should.\n. I'm going to hijack the original title for this and make it a feature request. :wind_chime: \n. I'm going to hijack the original title for this and make it a feature request. :wind_chime: \n. Hi @PigBoT. I don't see anything specific that in the VVV nginx configurations that would block PUT requests, though I don't think we've done anything to allow them. What directory is the PUT request being made to in the virtual machine?\n. Thanks @EHLOVader! I agree with this in principle and I think it's a great idea.\nWhat happens if an instance of VVV is already running and we change the name in Vagrantfile? Does everything work smoothly until the next vagrant destroy or do things get confused?\n. I think if we could do things over, this would be a great setting to have from the start. Unfortunately, it's too backward incompatible. And as you mention, it is more of a one off installation. Though anybody running multiple instances of VVV would definitely want to add this config. Thanks again for the PR!\n. This made it in via non-PR merge. Thanks @DrewAPicture! I can see graphs now :+1: \n. Thanks for the PR, @EHLOVader. I like the idea of having mailcatcher available. Once we ship 1.2, I'm going to take a closer look.\nFeedback from others is very welcome on this. :)\n. Thanks, @EHLOVader. Will be looking soon! :)\n. Hi @iamntz, thanks for the PR! Sorry it took me so long to review it. I think a couple of the changes make sense, especially the log location. I've left some other comments in the commit for clarification.\n. I'm going to close this out for now. Thank you very much for the PR, I think we're mostly at the point where we need to be.\nI may update the default path for xdebug to /tmp/, as that's where files are being stored now and webgrind seems to work as expected with all of the current data.\n.

Hi @Jimtrim, thanks for opening an issue. Sorry to leave you waiting for so long. :)\nThis was fixed in bb5757e868b3d earlier tonight. If you checkout the latest master of VVV and run vagrant provision, you should have Graphviz working.\n. Hi @Jimtrim, thanks for the PR.\nThe remote host in this config file is actually the local machine, not the VM created through Vagrantfile. 192.168.50.1 is correct.\n. Dig this idea. Agree with explicitly whitelisting paths to include.\nI would love if this transitioned to a YAML config file over time, though I think we're okay with an individual file right now.\n. It is now possible to selectively enable and disable sites through a YAML config file after the merge of #980. :tada: \n. Hi @Daronspence, sorry to leave you hanging! Thanks for the PR.\nI'm a little wary of our current backup procedures. See #407 for how the default behavior can now be considered annoying. Right now, backups are stored in a specific place so that they can be import automatically on a new vagrant up. Changing the location to sub directories could affect that.\nI think we're wide open on suggestions to better handle backups. Should they be automatic? How should they be disabled, etc...\n. Thanks for the work on this pull request. I'm going to leave database backups alone right now, as I think it's a workflow issue that can be solved with custom scripting at the moment. We need to have a longer think about how VVV should be involved with the backup process, if at all. Thanks!\n. I don't remember - does W3TC store cache to disk? I could see that causing some issues with the speed of the \"shared\" drive in VirtualBox.\nAlso - be cautious of NFS due to some file caching issues.\nPossible related - a good writeup comparing filesystem performance in virtual machines.\n. > Also - be cautious of NFS due to some file caching issues.\nI think this is the primary reason, though it's been a long while since I played with anything or tried to get it working.

And thank you @legal90 for dropping in as well!\nI checked out this PR and downloaded Parallels 10 for the first time to try things out.

Thanks @chrishepner!\n. Oops. :) Definitely not opposed to continuing the conversation.\nA few key notes from #154 that stick in my mind:\n@westonruter's - I think that keeping SVN as the default may be the best because it is much faster to checkout an SVN working copy than it is to clone a Git repo, especially one the size of the WordPress codebase.\nand my - To continue brainstorming\u2013it may be cool to convert our current WordPress installations to use the new auto-site generation stuff. - which starts to become possible once #319 is moved in.\n. I totally agree that git would be the more pleasant default. Speed continues to be my primary concern with switching before having a configurable VVV. There's just no easy way for a user to decide which sites should be created in advance. Ideally, I could tell provisioning to skip everything except for the develop repo, and then check it out with git rather than svn.\nWith my unshaped 34Mbps down connection at home:\n- 34 seconds for git clone git://develop.git.wordpress.org/\n- 14 seconds for svn checkout https://develop.svn.wordpress.org/trunk\nIf I limit that connection to 5Mbps:\n- 5 minutes, 23 seconds for git clone git://develop.git.wordpress.org/\n- 49 seconds for svn checkout https://develop.svn.wordpress.org/trunk\nI haven't gone through the full provisioning of a new VVV instance at 5mbps (though that should happen to identify pain points), but adding 5 minutes is tough. Providing the develop_git script is a nice intermediary step to switch when a dev is ready to make that decision. I think #319 will open some doors for us on this.\nIt'd be really nice if we could get details on average connection speed somehow, or even find a way to detect slow bandwidth in advance.\n.

Maybe there's some trickery we can employ to speed this up without pulling the entire history?\nI'd be up for playing with a pull request around this.\n. Bump. As part of the shift to the new provisioning configuration, we should make git the default in the vvv-wordpress-develop repository.. Will this modify anything else during provisioning or does it make the module available to whoever wants to run it manually?\n. I used this the other day on another project to update my package.json and it made me very happy. Don't see any downsides to including it yet.\n. I like where this may be going and need to dig in further, thanks for the PR @miya0001 :)\n. Poking at this a bit more finally. :)\nI like the idea of having tests included, that seems really approachable. It would also be nice to figure out how to apply CI to this, though that seems like a longer trail.\nTravis CI, from what I gather, doesn't support Vagrant because Vagrant doesn't support OpenVZ. Even if Vagrant did support OpenVZ (which this plugin may provide), the results of provisioning may differ quite a bit from our default provisioning targeted to VirtualBox.\nThis post implies that it's pretty straight forward with Jenkins. The caveats being (1) a base, mostly provisioned box would be necessary to reduce build time and (2) we would need to have our own Jenkins configuration.\nFun stuff. :)\n. @miya0001 Thank you for all of your effort on this pull request! It's a great example of what's possible.\nI'm not sure Serverspec is the right answer now, though it certainly may be one day. After chatting with @LoreleiAurora, I'm starting to understand how we may be able to use a server hosted on Digital Ocean or EC2 to help build and test machines on the fly. It's very possible that we'll be able to reference this at some point.. I think I like this, thanks @sc0ttkclark! Going to try to get 1.2 out the door first, then let's play with it.\n. Related #489 \n. It's been a long time coming. \u231a \n. Thanks, @miya0001 - I think this makes sense. I don't remember why we didn't enable it in the first place.\n. Tested and we're looking good. Thanks!\n. Does the same thing happen when you type only wp? And has it worked before or is this a fresh provision?\nIt's likely worth doing another vagrant provision to make sure things run through again. It should only take a minute, but will clear out anything missed (I hope).\n. Good to hear. :)\nA long term goal is some kind of success/error catcher in the script to provide some more detail at the end. Every once in a while something strange happens during provisioning and bash scripting is pretty brutish sometimes.\n. I went with google.com for the test HTTP request. I couldn't think of another server more likely to be up, reachable, and relatively speedy throughout the world. If anybody has other suggestions, please toss them out there.\n. Hey @ChrisWiegman, thanks for stopping by.\nDo you get the same thing at http://vvv.dev as well? That could point to an nginx issue. I'd also check the PHP and Nginx error logs - /var/log/php-fpm/ and /var/log/nginx/ inside the VM as it may highlight where the issue is coming form.\n. This could be related to #509 - we need to get better at verifying these checkouts.\n. I do notice random slow downs from time to time when xdebug is enabled, usually when I don't have anything I'm trying to debug. I've never dug into this, mostly because I'll lazily turn off xdebug until I need it again. :)\nIt would be interesting to find out why it decides to hang from time to time.\n. Hi @aubreypwd, thanks for the PR! I'm going to leave this out of the default configuration for now, as it's something that should likely be decided in individual configurations. It is possible to add this to Customfile so that it isn't overwritten by future upstream changes.\nOf note, we just added docs to Vagrantfile for port forwarding through #560 via #445.\n. Hi @chrislema, thanks for the report!\nI think our provisioning is most flimsy around the areas that check out repositories. We can definitely make some improvements there in detecting how things turned out.\nAnd, we should keep in mind #320 when doing any work to improve. It'd be nice to have a success/fail report at the end to make it easier to diagnose these things.\n. Just deleted VVV and the ubuntu/trusty64 box from my system and started over. Everything works as expected. It took 30 minutes, but it was downloading everything.\n. Making some notes while I do the v1.1 to v1.2 check.\n- Clone VVV, checkout v1.1 tag\n- vagrant up works, though:\n  - A 502 error first appeared because of php-fpm (see #363). Changed www.conf to match and default sites work fine.\n  - The latest WordPress stable did not download (see #452). This is expected because of the old download method. Everything else works fine.\n- Backup any existing databases. VVV 1.2 allows you to remove persistent DB backups, which is nicer.\n  - vagrant ssh\n  - vagrant@vvv:~$ mysqldump wordpress_develop > /srv/database/backups/wordpress_develop.sql\n  - vagrant@vvv:~$ mysqldump wordpress_trunk > /srv/database/backups/wordpress_trunk.sql\n- vagrant destroy\n- Checkout master (v1.2 tag soon).\n- Decide how to handle databases.\n  - If you leave database/data/mysql_upgrade_info in your VVV directory, the data directory will continue to map. (Not recommended)\n  - If you delete everything in the data directory, databases will persist inside the VM until it is destroyed. If you have the Vagrant Triggers plugin installed, databases will automatically backup on every vagrant halt, vagrant suspend, or vagrant destroy. You will want to leave readme.txt here as that is part of the repository.\n  - Databases inside data/backups will continue to import if necessary during provisioning.\n- Update VVV to master or v1.2 tag.\n- vagrant up\nAnd all is wonderful. Nice. I really did not expect it to go this well. :)\n. Thanks, @EHLOVader - I really want this to work, but I don't think we can push it in for 1.2, even though it is a major change. We merged the box change back in May (#335) and many have been running a flavor of this in master. It looks like this would break any running boxes immediately.\nI attempted to add this to Customfile instead as a workaround, but it doesn't seem to work. It would be great if that was a possibility.\nFor the future, I think we could default to having no name, but add a name if one exists in a config file somewhere. This goes with my YAML dream. :)\n. I'm going to set this as a long term goal. I think once we have a configuration in place, we can allow for custom box names (not named after the working directory) that fallback to the current default.\n. I'm actually wondering why I had trouble the first time. I thought I had tested and noticed a conflict, but my testing now shows that the box name has no trouble being changed between vagrant halt and vagrant up. If the box name is changed in Vagrantfile when the box is already started, nothing will change at all in VirtualBox. I think we're good!\nI'm going to open a new PR with @EHLOVader's changes against develop and then make a small tweak to the code.\n. Thanks @EHLOVader!\n. Looks good, thanks @jjeaton!\n. Looks good to me, thanks!\n. @colegeissinger, from your comment on #516, it sounds like the SSH key used by Sequel Pro may be invalid. See #365 \n@hilja I'm not seeing anything obvious from the scripts. It does seem like passwords (or hosts?) are being changed for the user somehow after initial provisioning. Can you create another admin user next time that is not used in any of the scripts. This may be useful for dumping the mysql.users table afterward to look for modifications.\n. @hilja are things still going good with the DBs?\n. @hilja are things still going good with the DBs?\n. Hi @ricker07 - I'd try a vagrant up without the provisioning just to ensure the box loads properly. Not much of this looks familiar from the VVV provisioning, and if laravel/homestead isn't an Ubuntu box, I could see some conflicts.\n. This will be fixed/merged in #633 pending license approval. Thanks all!\n. :+1:  Looks good.\nWe should probably switch our other git://s to https:// at some point. I've run into firewall scenarios where git won't work.\n. See https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/363 and https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/452\nPHP is broken due to a change in PHP itself. WP broke because of HTTPS at the time.\nAlso - master is about to ship as 1.2, it may save pain to use that instead. :)\n. Actually, ecc2f0919fe8589612d191238fa9df26851fa060 is more helpful for the 502 issue.\n. Makes sense, thanks!\n. This was merged as 915b4146, thanks @bradp!\n. Looks good, thanks!\n. Yes. Thank you, @ntwb!\n. I've thought about this in the past but have ended up being a little wary of making this change. It really comes down to this\u2014does a workflow where grunt build fires every time vagrant provision is fired make sense? It probably does now that I type it out, but I worried before that it would interrupt an existing workflow where grunt build was run on demand.\nOther thoughts?\n. I think we're best off leaving grunt build as a process that is separate from provisioning. I'm starting to think we should keep svn up separate as well. The environment of the server should be considered somewhat separate from the environment of each project at some point.\n\nYou also raise the point that wordpress-trunk is the same as wordpress-develop's /build state, why does wordpress-trunk even exist then in VVV?\n\nThis is a very good question. The original purpose was so that plugin and theme developers could easily test their work against trunk. In 2013, when the develop.svn repo was introduced, I decided to go with wordpress-develop so that we didn't conflict with anyone's existing wordpress-trunk workflow. See #113 for the full convo.\n\nHow about we totally remove the wordpress-trunk SVN checkout which would save a considerable amount of time, use grunt build along with a symlinked /build folder for wordpress-trunk?\n\nI would be definitely be in favor of reducing the number of SVN checkouts. \ud83d\ude03  See freshly opened #921.\nI am also very much in favor of splitting off provisioning for these things into individual repositories. See #611. Then VVV can be extended to support many (or 0) default configs. A more proper config for meta development could probably be applied at that point as well. \u2764\ufe0f\nThanks for leaving your thoughts so long ago @ntwb, sorry for the delay. :) \n. Thanks @bradp! Dig it.\n. Just ran through a fresh provisioning with this and all seems good. Let's do it.\n. Thanks for the PR, @bradp!\nI think we should stick with .sh extensions and fall on the side of Google's less preferred \"or a .sh extension\". It's one of the file names that's been there since the beginning, most likely because it was the example filename in the Vagrant documentation at the time. We also need to continue supporting the custom provision-custom.sh file, so removing the file extension from only one feels a bit strange.\n. This would be very useful! I'm thinking we should get configuration in order first so that one can easily pick and choose what sites they want to bring up.\nWould this make sense as additional VVV repositories, similar to @cfoellmann's multisite one? https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-multisite\n. I have been thinking about going to a develop branch workflow where master is always stable. I'd still like to keep things pretty lean though. I'm definitely open for feature branches in general.\n. Hi @grappler, sorry to leave you hanging. The address should be http://local.wordpress.192.168.50.4.xip.io (no .dev) once port forwarding is enabled.\n. I'd definitely be open to discussing this. This looks like a good comparison of the pros/cons - http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/innodb-multiple-tablespaces.html\n. Nice, I'm game. Is there any worry of something strange happening to existing databases when the config changes all of a sudden?\n. Thanks @ericmann! I'm going to sit on this for a minute, but we should be good.\n. FYI, a full history of this with related issue numbers is in #322.\n. Hey Clayton, thanks for stopping by!\nIt's completely ok to setup a git repository within the VVV structure. We exclude the stuff in www/ from the VVV repository, so there should never be a conflict.\n. > #319 is definitely a priority before moving on other stuff as it may change how we handle this on a per site level.\nI take that back. We should just make sure that logs are easily accessible. I think we should look at using /var/log/ as the proper log location and mapping this to a log directory on the host machine.\n. Interesting stuff. .dev has always been weird, though seemed appropriate. I wouldn't mind switching to .vvv at some point in a backward compatible way.\n. Hey @hilja, sorry no response ever came.\nIt sounds like some of this may be related to #360. I wonder if the same thing would happen with the HTTPS repository vs the git repository.\n. It would be nice to detect existing http checkouts and run svn relocate during provisioning now that we're using the HTTPS repositories.\n. It would be nice to detect existing http checkouts and run svn relocate during provisioning now that we're using the HTTPS repositories.\n. At this point it's probably better to make sure this scenario is well documented either as a FAQ via #605 or in the wiki. We've been forced HTTPS a while now and I haven't heard much.\nWe should document this as part of the 1.3.0 changelog.\n. It looks like we did this in 9c1d453b4d2b271a4fa520a7ba8cc39035b65d61 :). Indeed, let's reopen and discuss some more. Does #779 have any impact on this?\n. Ok. I'm wrapping my head around the NodeJS, NVM, and NPM stuff. Let's use this ticket to plan out some steps and then get things merged. :)\nNVM\nWe'll use #863 to install and configure the latest version of NVM.\nThis could go in right now. My only question was whether it would be worth downloading a zipped package from the GitHub repository rather than cloning the repo and then watching tags. It's a small commit history, so the clone won't take long either way, so it may be fine as is.\nNPM\nFrom @ntwb:\n\nI suggest VVV should standardise on the LTS v2.x branch of NPM, if people want to switch to v3 thats straight forward per above.\n\nIf I run npm --version inside my VVV instance right now, it's showing 3.8.6. Is that correct or should we force it back to LTS 2? What is the harm in NPM 3.x.x by default?\nI'm not sure we have a place where this is specified, so we may need a pull request that locks things in place once we decide.\nNodeJS\nWe can use #779 to update the default system version of Node to the 4.x LTS release per this comment, though I would not personally be opposed to running the latest stable. I guess it does make sense to use core defaults for some of this.\n. #863 is merged, #779 is still open.\n. I'm finally back on this. :)\nCurrent status:\nvagrant@vvv:~$ node --version\nv0.10.37\nvagrant@vvv:~$ npm --version\n3.10.6\nvagrant@vvv:~$ nvm --version\n0.31.4\nNow that nvm is installed, I can nvm install stable and nvm use stables and then npm --version is 6.4.0.\nI'm going to poke at #779 to up the NodeJS default to 4.x.\n. Ok, we now have nvm via #863 and NodeJS 4.2.x via #779.\nOn a fresh vagrant up:\nvagrant@vvv:~$ node --version\nv4.5.0\nvagrant@vvv:~$ npm --version\n3.10.6\nvagrant@vvv:~$ nvm --version\n0.31.4\n. This was merged into develop (and accidentally master \ud83d\ude01) via #564.\n. This would be great, thanks @EHLOVader! I'm going to move it to the 1.3.0 milestone. Let's test it a bunch and get it in.\n. This would be great, thanks @EHLOVader! I'm going to move it to the 1.3.0 milestone. Let's test it a bunch and get it in.\n. Finally tested it and I'm in love. Thanks again @EHLOVader, this is fantastic. :+1: \n. Our general objective is to provide a good environment for WordPress development that matches a good production environment.

I'm still mixed personally as I've embraced Salt for other provisioning projects. Not ruled out completely, but we'd need a nice plan going in. Part of me enjoys the clarity that provision.sh offers a newcomer to the project, part of me wonders if anyone really wants to look at that.\nAlso a general +1 on finding ways to use VVV for other projects. I think the base nginx, mysql, php setup can fit a lot of use cases, even if some of the software provisioned would be extra.\n. Sorry to come in super late. :)\nWhile I agree with @cfoellmann that there's no downside to the red, part of me really wants to know why. If you're still fighting this and don't mind doing some debugging, can you use OpenSSL to debug the cert/key and find out what info is in it. It's entirely possible that the domain mismatch is really what the error is.\n. +1 for @fa7ad's explanation. This is definitely local environment only.

If not, feel free to reopen and discuss. It seems like it may have been an issue with local permissions and the .vagrant directory, but that's a wild guess at this point. :)\n. Makes sense, good catch!\n. I'm up for .test as well. We can probably introduce the new TLD in the configs while continuing to support old .dev installations.\n. Ok, feedback time.\nOptions:\n- .localhost\n- .test\n- .local\nI excluded .example and .invalid because they don't seem right. Decisions. :)\nPlease leave a comment, this is super serious stuff.\n. Per @rmccue, .local is a valid option too. IMO, better than .localhost. https://twitter.com/rmccue/status/701526969008062465\n. Other .local reading material (I haven't parsed it yet): http://www.justincarmony.com/blog/2011/07/27/mac-os-x-lion-etc-hosts-bugs-and-dns-resolution/\n. As #1282 says, it's time to get rolling on this. :). Could it be possible there's an issue with the vagrant-hostsupdater plugin? That it fails at that step seems suspect. Can you try removing the plugin (vagrant plugin uninstall)? Also, a full dump of the error text would be helpful.\nIn the end though, @zamoose is right. If virtualization is not enabled, things aren't going to be great.\n. Agreed - see also #801 for similar core troubleshooting needs.\n. Hi @ndisidore, this does sound pretty cool. Thanks for the PR!\nWe've had discussions (#98 comes to mind) around swappable PHP versions, but it's been hard for me to personally imagine how it fits in VVV itself. I think Docker (#258) has been the most interesting possibility previously, but that would be a huge challenge to integrate with VVV. Your proposal for PHPBrew is the most intriguing yet.\nI like that we can still have a default PHP version installed and that phpswap only needs to be used as desired.\nI've created a feature branch feature/phpbrew on the VVV repository. Would you mind changing the PR to be against that branch instead? We can then merge it in and make it easier to test as a whole.\nWould love to hear feedback from others on this as well.\n. Closed via merge into develop. I'm assuming this works as I don't have VMWare Fusion and Robert says it does. :smile:\nThanks @robneu!\n. Thanks for the PR @grantnorwood!\nIt does make sense to allow for a custom configuration. I think I'd rather see the check directling in config.inc.php:\nif ( file_exists( 'config.inc.custom.php' ) ) {\n    include( 'config.inc.custom.php' );\n}\nThen we don't need to maintain the check for it in provision.sh at all. In fact, I might roll back b18ca1347453da386733192930497b2c6f286218 as that can be an entirely custom configuration.\nIf that makes sense, can you reopen that in a PR against the develop branch?\n.

Closing this as fixed in #688 with a slightly alternate approach using a cherry-picked commit from here.\n. Any word back from the author @cfoellmann? We could probably fork/host the current working version if needed.\n. Makes sense and looks good, thanks @enejb!\n. Hi @joelworsham, thanks for stopping by.\nI haven't personally seen this problem and I've updated trunk with vagrant provision, by running svn up locally, and by running svn up inside the VM. Is there any chance a local change was made to the repository? It's strange that this would be a conflict.\n. Is this something that can be added in Customfile only? From conversation in #469, this method may only work in Windows. I'd like to know what other possible side effects of having it enabled are.\n. Is this something that can be added in Customfile only? From conversation in #469, this method may only work in Windows. I'd like to know what other possible side effects of having it enabled are.\n. Agreed. Using a dedicated testing VM would be interesting for sure, but it would probably be best as a barebones, separate instance.\n. We tried this briefly once before via #6, but I think that mostly because it was easier to give a talk on Vagrant and pass around a pre-packaged box. We moved back to the standard box in 107c7425cc54046bbe6.\nI think provisioning is a necessary evil and that an empty base box is a good thing. Ideally, things get converted to look for latest packages at some point and vagrant provision is run on a fairly frequent basis. The only time things are really slow are that initial vagrant up.\n. I've started to change my mind on this a bit. It would be interesting to find the right way to regularly package boxes so that provisioning wasn't as necessary. A version of this is already happening for WordPress contributor days.\n. Chatted with @LoreleiAurora about this yesterday a bit. I think we have several options available to us for hosting a pre-packaged box. I'd like to start working toward a future where every time a new version of VVV is shipped, we're also able to update the base box so that git pull && vagrant box update will kind of Just Work.. It is slooooow. :) I'd like to see some better handling of incremental updates rather than the blanket provisioning process. IMO, provisioning is probably best for updating the server. Making quick changes to add a site could probably go just fine without it if we prepped the right way.\n. I'm going to close this in favor of some other tickets that will hopefully continue to improve the provisioning experience. The first is #753 which should allow for new sites without a full provision.\n. This makes sense, the more log files exposed the better. :)\n. @golfhotel Workflows can definitely vary, but all of these tools are accessible in the VM as if it was a server you were working on. If it makes sense to use them there because of the hurdles involved with installing them locally, there should be no issue.\nBecause of the way Virtuabox manages shared drives, it's possible that some Grunt processes run from the VM will take longer. If Grunt is a regular part of your workflow, then it may be worth looking into a workflow that involves running it locally. This is definitely a YMMV moment though.\n. This is where using nginx-wp-common.conf included with VVV may break down a little bit. You probably need more specific handling for the wp-content/ directory. See my WSU config file for an example of how an alias might work.\n. There's an override of 25M in the default site config that handles phpMyAdmin requests - https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/blob/master/config/nginx-config/sites/default.conf#L49\nWe should probably bump this all around to 200MB or something in all configs as it is a development environment. I do think larger databases are probably easier at the command line.\n. Looks like I suggested 1GB in #273. Objections to that?\n. Hi @trevorberman, thanks for opening an issue here. I'm going to close this as a duplicate of #375 as I think it's the same general problem. This is more of an issue with Vagrant than VVV, but that thread has been a helpful discussion area.\nThere has to be some missing piece in all of this. I'm hoping to bring up a Windows machine at some point to try and duplicate the issue myself.\n. Hi @juan-manuel-alberro, thanks for stopping by.\n- Are you able to perform other wp-cli actions as normal?\n- Does the same thing occur when trying to install a theme?\n- Does the same thing happen when trying to install a plugin on one of the sites included with VVV by default?\n. Hi @Hanque, thanks for stopping by. Is there anything specific you have a question about?\n. We don't have a comprehensive manual, though there are write-ups on several topics. \"The First Vagrant Up\" covers the initial process of getting the default WordPress environments up and running. Also see this repository's wiki for additional information.\nIf you can provide the exact error or a screenshot, we may be able to narrow down where the issue is.\n. Hi @Pharetra, thanks for stopping by. I'm not sure if moving Vagrant's home directory would cause this. If you skip this step are you able to vagrant up without issue? It may be there is an issue specific to that plugin, which unfortunately hasn't been updated in a couple years.\n. I'm going to close this out. vagrant-hostsupdater is an active project at this point. Thanks for picking it up, @cgsmith! :). Thanks @cfoellmann!\n- Is the switch in directories from /srv/www/phpcs/CodeSniffer/Standards/WordPress to /srv/www/phpcs-wordpress going to mess with any current installations?\n- Why sudo now on the phpcs lines?\n. /cc @westonruter for feedback too :smile: \n. @cfoellmann do you want to address the path naming and update the PR accordingly? It seems like this would help as long as we're consistent with the location.\n. I think we need to regroup on this in a new pull request. I've opened issue #922 to describe the intent here. Thanks for the work on this @cfoellmann. :)\n. I love all these custom dashboards, so much great stuff. I'd rather not tie VVV directly into any of them at the moment. I think what we have is basic and ugly, and that's fine. I can definitely see adding a section in the README (more visible than the wiki) with a list of dashboards similar to our helpful extensions section. It may even make sense to add a small note to the default dashboard to make it more obvious that something custom can be installed.\nI'm absolutely okay to make any changes that make it easier to distribute a custom dashboard, though it seems like the current model works pretty well.\n. Hi @cfoellmann. Still haven't forgotten about this. :)\nJust had a thought while reviewing the changes on how we can transition to using these and to using defaults provided externally at the same time.\n- Via #544, we should pick a new TLD at some point. .test may be the right answer. It's worth thinking about using the same TLD that HGV decides on for consistency for users.\n- In the new break-out sites provided by this PR, we could add some kind of check where things are only updated/created if this is an existing VVV configuration. (Not sure what that check is yet).\n- If it is a new VVV config, pull the new TLD sites from individual GitHub repositories instead of having them packaged with VVV.\n- Then provide a way of choosing which repositories to use.\nThoughts?\n.

Hi @bastibeckr! Thanks for the ticket and sorry for the delay.\nI'm not sure this change needs to be made. At this point in Vagrantfile, config options are being set so that they are available when the plugin fires. This data should all be available to the plugin no matter the order. Is it possible something else was causing the trouble? I haven't noticed any issues with this positioning and we've had it configured this way since the beginning.\n. Going to close this out for now. I haven't seen any problems with fresh boxes related to the positioning of the network configuration in Vagrantfile.\n. Looks good, makes sense. Thanks @cfoellmann!\nNote for anyone passing through: The phpMemcachedAdmin that we use in VVV is now pulled from the @cfoellmann maintained https://github.com/wp-cloud/phpmyadmin repository, which is a fork/copy of the old hosted code from Google code.\n. Thanks for opening and working on this PR, @EHLOVader! I'm going to close it in favor of #811, which applies the AppArmor config.\n. We should be ok to merge in #631, though I'm somewhat confused. With a fresh VM, I'm able to use xdebug_on and then load pages fine. A /tmp/xdebug-remote.log is then created with 644 permissions and a www-data owner. It would be nice to find a root cause here.\n.

While working on #691, I finally paid attention to the actual location of the log file. I wonder if we'd be better off putting it in /srv/log/ along with the php error log.\nI'm still poking to try and generate the error again so that I can test. :)\n. @pdewouters it should have been fixed in https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/970. Sorry, missed this! I just updated the docs to say 1.7.x for Vagrant. I think we're okay leaving it at the specific minor version, with patch version unspecified. I'm hesitant to show \"or later\" as we've been burned by new Vagrant releases before and I'd rather confirm first.\n. Merged into the develop branch via 1d3b86731e5d70c30781c79234609d49da3cffbc, thanks @hubdotcom!\n. Being explicit is good. I like the idea of sticking to 1 core by default for VirtualBox. I wonder if that impacted some of the speed results. :)\n. Being explicit is good. I like the idea of sticking to 1 core by default for VirtualBox.

Are there other errors during provisioning? I've provisioned from scratch a few times recently and haven't had any trouble, though it's possible that this error displays.\nCan you paste the entire provisioning log into a gist or pastebin? It may be helpful to see all of those details.\n. Depending on the terminal in use, you may be able to configure how many lines of scrollback are available. In OSX or Linux, you can pipe the results like vagrant provision > results.txt to capture a text file. You may be able to do the same thing here.\nHave you tried starting over with vagrant destroy, then vagrant up? There shouldn't be any different behavior inside the VM itself once provisioning starts between Linux, OSX, and Windows.\n. Ahh, it looks like this may be key:\n==> default: Failed to fetch http://nginx.org/packages/mainline/ubuntu/pool/nginx/n/nginx/nginx_1.9.1-1~trusty_amd64.deb  Hash Sum mismatch\n==> default: E\n==> default: : \n==> default: Unable to fetch some archives, maybe run apt-get update or try with --fix-missing?\nI'm going to try a fresh vagrant up on my end.

Going to close this in favor of 9162a56, which should do the trick after a vagrant provision. Thanks for the PR!\n. Thanks for all the great work @EHLOVader! And thanks to everyone for testing this out here and in #464. :)\nThings seem to be working great after provisioning. I started with a fresh VM on develop and then did vagrant provision with this pull request applied. It added about 5 minutes because of the extra Ruby download, but that's not too bad. It would be nice to find a way to speed it up in the future if possible.\nAfter merge I'm going to play with a few things:\n- Attempt to silence the gem install that (I think) is generating the ruby download messaging. Because of how Vagrant displays the messaging, this creates a wall of red. Though silencing will create a wall of silence. We'll see. :)\n- Look into what binding to 0.0.0.0 implies. It would be nice if we could bind to a specific address to avoid possible security issues, especially if someone has converted their box to a public IP for use with external testing.\n- We're doing version detecting in a few places now for a couple things. We should be able to abstract this as a separate function to clean up provision.sh a bit.\n. This is great stuff. Love getting rid of that error. :)\n@twisty7867 Are you good with including this with VVV under the MIT License? It looks like the origin is straight from your post.\nThanks!\n. Great, thanks!\n. That would be excellent. I'm not sure if we need to go into too much technical detail, but a general overview of the usefulness would be great.\n. Finally coming back around to this. Thank you @ndisidore for all this work! Sorry to keep you hanging so long. I got a chance to try it out tonight and it's pretty amazing.\nI'm currently exploring the steps required to get to the the beginning and the end of the WordPress range:\n- While phpbrew supports the --old flag to install versions earlier than 5.3, PHP has moved the release files for 5.2.4 and other old versions to museum.php.net, which is not mirrored. This results in a quick failure. I setup my own mirror at vvv.dev/distributions/ and specified it with phpbrew install --old --mirror http://vvv.dev 5.2.4. This started to work, but make failed when building openssl. I'm guessing there is still a workaround, which would be nice to find for core development.\n- Switching to a mid-range version was easy. phpswap 5.3.20 was seamless. I didn't even have to do anything extra to restart the service.\n- phpswap doesn't support installing (I think) the unstable 7 releases. A few related notes here in my attempt to get it going:\n  - I installed with phpbrew install next as php-7.0.0 so that the package was available and then tried phpswap 7.0.0. I got an error related to php-fpm, which apparently was not installed by default.\n  - I then tried phpbrew install next as php-7.0.0 +fpm to rebuild with the fpm variant. This got me closer, but there's some kind of config issue due to a missing pool. It's here that I'm done for the night, so I'm guessing it's just an adjustment somewhere.\nI think we're close, and I'm looking forward to having a place to test 7 out as well. I also think the comments on #586 about quickly testing reported errors in other versions are important. This goes along with client work and with core development.\nI'm going to work toward getting this merged into an updated version of the feature branch very soon. I'd like to see this as we complete the feature:\n1. Standard PHP 5.3.x -> 5.6.x support via the phpswap command inside the VM.\n2. Support for PHP 7 via the phpswap command inside the VM.\nAnd longer term:\n1. Documented steps to get 5.2.4 working with phpbrew.\n2. Support for PHP 5.2.4 via the phpswap command inside the VM. I'm honestly not worried about any of the other 5.2.x releases, only 5.2.4 as it will be very useful for a small amount of testing.\n. On an already provisioned instance of VVV, running vagrant provision again should not take much time at all.\nIt's possible that a restart would not work because the custom nginx config files may not have been copied over. We should take a closer look at the workflow for this.\nSorry to keep you hanging, thanks for the ticket @byronyasgur!\n. > It would be nice if the custom_vvv function in the provision.sh script could be ran separately.\n\nSo you wouldn't have to go through the whole provisioning script.\n\nIndeed. Let's do this in #753.\n. Agreed, some sort of channel would be nice. We could setup bbPress at varyingvagrantvagrants.org. I haven't used gitter.im myself. It would be nice to setup a Slack team, but that might be too much of a barrier for support questions.\n. Agreed, some sort of channel would be nice. We could setup bbPress at varyingvagrantvagrants.org. I haven't used gitter.im myself. It would be nice to setup a Slack team, but that might be too much of a barrier for support questions.\n. This is still a valid question.\n- varingvagrantvagrants.org should be updated to include more documentation (more on that soon).\n- GitHub issues are a tough place to provide support, though that's the de facto spot at this point.\n- Is there a place on Stack Exchange where VVV would fit in?\n- Other thoughts?\n. If you use vagrant halt or vagrant suspend to end a session and then vagrant up to start again, the database for your WordPress installation will remain. If you use vagrant destroy, the database will be erased with the rest of the virtual machine.\nIf you want to move everything to a new VM instance, you would need to backup the databases and content as if you were swapping servers. Content is mapped to your local machine, so that's easier to handle.\n. Sorry to hear about the troubles. I'm going to close this in favor of the upstream Vagrant fix, but it's good to have this documented. I know several people are running things in Windows just fine, but it is often an unfortunate pain point.\n. These files are included with the repository rather than provisioned in, so it seems the only way for this to happen would be during an interrupted checkout. Glad to hear it's back though!\n. Great catch, thanks @michaelbeil!\n. Nope, already got you in shortly after. :smile: \n. Read my mind earlier, thanks!\n. Hi @fbm-static, thanks for the ticket. I don't think sudo is necessary, but I'm not sure if it would cause an issue. I run xdebug_on as the vagrant user and it works fine. I just tried now and it modifies a /etc/php5/fpm/conf.d/20-xdebug.ini file and includes the zend_extension directive. I'm not sure if that matters or why you would be seeing 50-xdebug.ini.\nHave you tried without sudo?\n. Thanks @HongPong!\n. Only because I'm behind :)\nI agree, I would like to mix up the current list of committers. Let me think through a few things that I'd like to establish first.\n.

Hi @TimeTravelersHackMe, thanks for the report.\nI'm seeing two different issues here:\n- Something has happened recently that has made the changes from #347 seem broken. I'm having issues with DNS when running unit tests. I wasn't able to send mail via postfix today until I updated resolv.conf to use Google DNS. I want to dig into this further to see if that's a long term solution or if the DNS NAT should still be working.\n- The installation of Mailcatcher in #632 was great in that it gave us a web interface for mail, but it does take over sendmail when WordPress tries to use it. I had to comment out the config in /etc/php5/mods-available/mailcatcher.ini for that to start working.\n.

I went ahead and reverted this, only because it's still in the develop branch and has not been merged to master.

Thanks!\nI've been thinking for a while about doing exactly this in some fashion. I like the idea of having areas broken up into functions. It definitely helps readability and should help when troubleshooting or extending specific areas as well. I also had no idea that shellcheck existed, which seems great on the surface.\nI'm going to take a closer look at this soon and do some proper testing. Overall it seems to be on the right path already.\n. we should merge master into develop + develop into feature/phpbrew (regularly) to keep everything in line.\n@cfoellmann - We should get to a point where we're merging develop into master more frequently. Though any time that does happen (beyond some recent accidents \ud83d\ude01), it should correspond with a release.\nI definitely think we should get this PR into develop soon. At that point we should work on testing upgrades from the current master to the current develop so that we can confidently merge and call it 1.3.0. Ideally we have quicker incremental updates, but you know... :)\nOn a side note: I was wanting to write this week proposing that I would do the same for the master branch. It would prevent conflicts when merging Develop into Master if this PR gets accepted.\n@cristovaov - I don't think we'll have much trouble merging develop into master, so no other version of the PR is necessary. If we do run into issues, I'll take ownership of resolving those conflicts. Thanks though!\n\nI tested this as well yesterday and was really happy with things. Everything went smoothly on a fresh box and I haven't noticed any issues yet. A few notes from my end:\n- A few comments got rearranged (see to of provision.sh and the apt_package_check_list package comments). I'd prefer if most of those stayed the same for the moment. If it does make sense to change a particular comment, it would be nice to see it on another commit.\n- Comments describing a function should go just above the function name. At some point it could be cool to follow Google's shell style guide for function comments and full develop parameters, returns, globals, etc... but I think that can also wait to a future PR.\n- The network_check function is used several times to check the network but doesn't seem to bail on the process entirely if a bad network is detected. The initial check should result in most other things not being called if it fails. This needs to match existing behavior.\n. @cfoellmann Ahh, excellent - I did misunderstand. I'll work on that today. There were a few accidental merges to master on my end. :)\n. Ok, I provisioned with this from scratch and used it for about a week. I'm going to merge it into develop so that we can get some more real world use. I may go through and re-organize just a bit post merge and we'll see if we run into any bugs. I haven't fully tested the network detection, and I'm not sure if I understand yet how it would work compared to the current version, but let's go for it. :)\nThanks @cristovaov!\n. UTC is a good default to stick with on servers in general. There's likely something you can do with custom provisioning scripts that sets tzdata to something different.\n.

Yes, the databases are only inside the virtual machine. If the vagrant triggers plugin is installed, the db_backup script will fire on halt, suspend, and destroy and backup your databases locally.\nWe kept backward compatibility for existing VVV instances that mapped the database locally, so there's a bit of a hack available if you did want to do this. Things are much quicker now though.\nSee #322 and #287 for some more history on why this is the way it is.\n. Yes, the databases are only inside the virtual machine.

Hi @2ndkauboy, thanks for the ticket!\nAny ideas why the npm-debug.log file was created in the root directory? I don't think I've noticed that one yet and we don't have any local npm tasks that should put it there.\n. I'm going to close this out pending reporter feedback. If this can be reproduced and is a file generated by VVV, we'll probably need a new pull request as this one is out of date.\n. https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/88 may have some useful information as well.\n. Are you able to load another virtual machine with VirtualBox? It seems more likely the issue would lie there than with Vagrant or VVV. I'd try a VM from modern.ie first to see how that goes, then a bare bones Vagrant VM.\n. You should be able to do this with a Customfile using the same syntax that we use in Vagrantfile. See https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/blob/develop/Vagrantfile#L216-L218\n. It would be helpful to track down steps to reproduce. I'm not sure at this point if there's anything we can do in VVV or if this is a Vagrant/VB issue.\nThere's also a chance that the recent changes to wordpress-develop provisioning helps this as the initial npm install is done in a temporary directory before it is moved to a mapped directory.\n. Yeah, once provisioning has started in Vagrant, user interaction is done. This may require a custom Vagrant plugin instead to achieve the desired effect.\n. Tagging #605 to track this as something to add to FAQs. Thanks for the ticket, @rlaan. Thanks for the answer @grappler!\n. Thanks for the info, @ericmann. So if we use run_remote, we would ditch the vagrant ssh -c part as well?\nI'd be okay to adjust this. I wonder if there's a chance that sudo would screw with someone's custom script that's already in place as part of the chain.\n. Thanks for the info, @ericmann.

In addition to the above, I'll toss my Various Networking Configurations in VVV in as an additional explainer. I'd like to get more of this built out so that we can provide nicer docs on varyingvagrantvagrants.org one day.\n. This will be documented better in the future via #961.\n. Good catch, thanks, @amchoukir!\n. Not entirely deliberate, though not a bug either. :) Need to think through the consequences of adding Access-Control-Allow-Origin by default. It may be fine, especially because of the local setup, but it might be best left as is.\n. I've been seeing this error during provisioning as well, but haven't had a chance to look at it. Is postfix actually broken or is this an install error?\n. I'm going to close this as a duplicate of #628.\n. Hi @ram89, have you enabled XDebug inside the VM yet? Either vagrant ssh -c \"xdebug_on\" or vagrant ssh then xdebug_on would do the trick.\nAlso, the remote host of 192.168.50.1 may need to be specified.\n. I guess that's the hard part about moving from master to develop, things get even more stale! :) Thanks, @cfoellmann!\n. See #465 as well for inspiration.\n. This looks fun. :)\nMy first suggestion would be to start tearing things out of the VVV Vagrantfile. If a bare box was able to load fine, then it may be one of the configurations set there that is causing the conflict with your VirtualBox setup. I'd probably delete everything except for config.vm.box = \"ubuntu/trusty64\" just to see what happens, then start to reintroduce other pieces if it fires up.\n. Thanks for the info, @neilgee. I haven't noticed that issue specifically, but I'm going to keep a better eye out.\n. Thanks for the suggestions @sohaeb! We're always looking for ways to make the documentation better and easier to follow. I'll take a closer look at this when I dig through README the next time.\n. I'm going to close this out with our docs refresh in #1112. Thanks!. It's only been a year. :)\n\nWhich prompted me to enter the file in which to save the key, which defaulted to to /var/www/.ssh/id_rsa\n\nThis could work:\n- sudo mkhomedir_helper www-data to setup a home directory for the www-data user\n- sudo -u www-data ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"email@email.com\"\n- Use /home/www-data/.ssh/id_rsa as the location for the key.\n. Agreed, I think these efforts are probably better spent with tools outside of VVV. VV is a great way to go.\n. The changelog has now been updated for 1.3.0. It would be easier to update it as we go, I'll try to work on that as part of the process. :)\n. @cfoellmann I think I'd still prefer to maintain the changelog separately. Sometimes several different commits and PRs end up being related and can be grouped together. I'm okay with contributors not having to worry about that.\n. I think this may be one of those quirks that needs to be documented as I've lost track of what should be expected here. Anyone doing a deep dive on the hows and whys of shared directory user settings could help here. :). Thanks for the ticket and patch, @thebrandonallen. \nOpCache should be enabled by default. The organization of the config files is a little strange, but the extension is loaded in /etc/php5/fpm/conf.d/05-opcache.ini and the custom config is in /etc/php5/fpm/conf.d/opcache.ini. You can see OpCache in action at http://vvv.dev/opcache-status/opcache.php, where a list of cached scripts and hit/miss statistics can be seen.\nI would be happy if there was a nicer way to enable this. It may be that the opcache.ini should live somewhere else. The 05-opcache.ini was auto-created by PHP (I think), and I recall there being some problems when shifting from PHP 5.4 to 5.5. I may also be recalling incorrectly. :)\nI don't think we need a flag to turn it off/on. I'm happy to be swayed there, but I don't think I've ever run into a case where it would be beneficial to turn it off.\n. Going to close this out as we haven't had a repeat issue. Please feel free to re-submit the proposal if it comes up again in the future.\n. Hi @scarstens, thanks for the ticket. Sorry for the wait. :)\nI haven't explored providing a Docker provider config in the default Vagrantfile. Is it something that could work in parallel with the other providers? Definitely open to adding this if someone submits a PR or approach that can be properly tested.\n. I added a note to #968 for this as well. While entirely possible, I'm wary of the maintenance cost in supporting Docker as another provider. Thanks for all of the feedback on this ticket!. This should now all be possible after the merge of #980. Sorry for never leaving feedback, @iandunn!\n. Hi @alexmoss, thanks for the report.\nI'm not able to reproduce this locally. vvv.dev/database-admin/ works fine for me. Are you able to access other default sites through vvv.dev?\nOne option may be to delete the {vvv-dir}/www/default/database-admin/ directory and then run vagrant provision again to see if it populates correctly.\n. I'm going to close this out now that 1.3.0 has been released. The provided stable release should now be better.\n. This has been merged via 7ea78fa. Thanks @MatthewEppelsheimer!\n.

Hi @alexmoss, thanks for the ticket. It's entirely possible that the two are conflicting, but it's hard to immediately tell from the documentation. VVV via Vagrant configures a virtual machine at 192.168.50.4 and assigns an IP of 192.168.50.1 to your local machine so that it can communicate. There should be no port forwarding by default that would conflict, but it's possible that network configuration does.\n. Hey @dkotter, thanks for the report. #774 is in the develop branch of VVV, which fixes the issue for new provisions. Existing provisions will need to either do what you did (switch the remote) or delete the default/webgrind directory and run vagrant provision again. I toyed with switching the remote automatically, but that could confuse some things in the rarest of cases.\n.

Do you see any errors during vagrant up that may help troubleshoot the problem?\n. Hi @hilja, thanks for the ticket and sorry for the lack of response.\nI've run into this before when the VM's /etc/hosts/ file uses the loopback address (127.0.0.1) for the domain name. I've fixed it by adjusting the hosts file to use 192.168.50.4 instead.\nThat said, I've also not done this and had no trouble at all, so I'll admit that I have no idea when it causes an issue and when it doesn't.\nIt would be nice to find the best way of managing this and make sure that /etc/hosts always contains the right info.\n. I'll take a closer look at #779 to resolve this. We should be able to find some way to cleanly update without driving ourselves crazy. :)\n: How would a PHP (or another system package) upgrade be handled in VVV?\n@ericandrewlewis This is one of our worst non-features right now. In something like Salt I would define php-fpm as pkg.latest and it would always look for an update whenever vagrant provision fires.

Hi @adamf321, thanks for the ticket.\nThis may be a question to raise as a VV issue as it sounds like things were working fine before VV was used. It's possible there is a conflicting configuration from a site added through VV.\nI would try running vagrant provision again to see if the default configs can be reset. You may also want to manually remove any non-core VVV configs.\n. Thanks for all of the work on this PR. I'm going to close it for now as it needs some work to be mergeable and the original concerns that initiated #606 have been addressed.. Hi @altrovideo, thanks for opening a ticket.\nVVV uses the ubuntu/trusty64 box, so it's possible there are several types of errors or misconfigurations that would occur when switching linux versions.\nIt is good to note for others who may have the same issue.\n.

This likely comes down to 2 things:\n1. Make sure the .conf file containing the rules for handling these URLs has been properly copied to /etc/nginx/custom-sites/\n2. Make sure nginx has been reloaded to use the new config files.\nA vagrant reload won't necessarily do either of these things.\nTo make sure it worked, I skipped straight to the VM and updated /etc/nginx/custom-sites/default.conf to include these two server blocks:\n```\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name hasty-hog-7291.vagrantshare.com;\nlocation / {\n    return 200 'Hasty Hog Worked';\n    add_header Content-Type text/plain;\n}\n\n}\nserver {\n    listen 81;\n    server_name rapid-parrot-5426.vagrantshare.com;\nlocation / {\n    return 200 'Rapid Parrot Worked';\n    add_header Content-Type text/plain;\n}\n\n}\n```\nI used the server names generated by vagrant share, though you can probably also setup a default server to handle any requests on those ports.\nI then ran service nginx restart inside the VM to reload nginx and was able to access the URLs as expected.\n. It seems like you're on the right path. As an abstract\u2014the repository should provide a description of the pieces needed to provision the environment that your collaborators will be using. How detailed this should be is up to you.\n- By default, VVV describes an environment with Nginx, PHP, etc.. and includes a handful of web directories.\n- You may want to adjust/add server configs and add them with custom provisioning.\n- You may want to add an entire directory containing plugins/themes.\nIt may also be beneficial to treat these as pieces. VVV contains provisioning for the server, and then you check out another repository inside the web directory containing your application work.\nIn the end, the VM won't necessarily by identical, but the description of the VM should be and should allow for collaboration in identical environments.\n. Agreed! I don't think we need the betas, but I would like to start doing quarterly releases or similar. Most of the stuff will be maintenance.\n. Doing it! :)\n. I like the idea of including an .editorconfig. We would need to make sure it only applies to VVV project files and that it accounts for markdown, shell, PHP, and other package configuration files.\n. Good catch, I haven't tried using grunt inside the VM in a while.\nIt seems like the related issue could be this line: UNMET PEER DEPENDENCY grunt@~0.4.0.\nI wonder if this is somehow related to #788 and #779.\n. Good catch, I haven't tried using grunt inside the VM in a while.\nIt seems like the related issue could be this line: UNMET PEER DEPENDENCY grunt@~0.4.0.\nI wonder if this is somehow related to #788 and #779.\n. I think we need to test this a bit more. I ran through vagrant up from scratch last week and grunt installed fine as part of provisioning.\n. I did another vagrant up with a blank box today as part of 1.3.0 testing and things seemed ok. I'm wondering if this was a one off issue.\n. I was able to reproduce this today on a fresh vagrant up with the develop branch. The resulting npm-debug.log has a couple errors at the end that may be relevant.\nIt then took too many destroys and re-provisions, but I think I found how to reproduce.\nIn provision.sh, we have noroot npm install &>/dev/null for wordpress-develop on the first provision.\nIf I allow npm output to be shown by changing that to noroot npm install for a fresh provision, it works fine. If I change it back to noroot npm install &>/dev/null for a fresh position, it has the same error.\nNow that I'm there, I haven't dug into possible reasons yet, but a short term fix may just be to allow for the output.\n. This appears to be related, if not the issue: https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/9633\n. Are these packages that should be implemented as part of the upstream project composer.json and package.json files or will they work during provisioning as globally available?\n. Hi @hazephase. What command did you run when this error appeared?\n. I'm going to close this out, but please feel free to reopen with more details. :)\n. It looks like this is actually part of the default MySQL 5.5 configuration. Our custom configuration does not use key_buffer or key_buffer_size. Once provisioning runs the first time, the custom config should have overwritten the default configuration.\n. I reframed the project goal a bit when shipping 1.3.0 for clarity. \"server configuration common for high traffic WordPress sites\" is now \"modern server configuration\". That should help guide decisions like this. IMO, we're already behind quite a bit by not switching to PHP 5.6 earlier. I think that helps push us toward PHP 7 as the right answer for \"modern server\".\n.

I think that's the right way forward.\nWe should get PHPBrew working at or near the same time, that will be a nice addition. For those that aren't aware, we have a Phpbrew feature branch setup that needs to be updated against the current develop branch and tested.\n. Time to celebrate. :tada: \n844 is merged and provides PHP7, #869 is merged and provides Xdebug for that PHP7. Please test and open any bug tickets as necessary. :bug:\nBig thanks to @LoreleiAurora for the super clean pull request.\nI'll start paying more attention to the PHPbrew PR #854 soon.\n. Big +1 for this.\n. The default DB config provided by VVV should be MariaDB 10.0 (see #876). We should also provide a config for MySQL Sandbox as part of vvv-utilities to make bouncing around and testing easier.. Hi @Mte90 - It looks like there is a merge conflict due to the change in the contributors list. Can you refresh the pull request to just add the packages? We can take care of adding you to the contributors list in a separate commit. It'd probably be good to test with PHP7 as well now that that's in. :smile: \nThanks!\n. Thanks for the pull request, @mte90. I'm going to close this out as we'll need a different solution for PHP 7.0. I've opened #923 to start a discussion.\n. As the vagrant_up script is new to the configuration, it's possible that it is not in its proper location inside the VM yet. Does this persist after doing a vagrant provision?\n. Excellent! :+1: \nFor the next release we should note whether vagrant provision is required on upgrade.\n. This does look pretty amazing. My gut says that it would be most useful on a project to project basis depending on your workflow. I'm not sure how it would fit in as a default interface for all projects configured in VVV.\nHappy to look at a PR to see how it works, but I'd probably encourage setting it up with a custom script.\n.

Thanks for the excellent pull request, @keegoid. This makes sense.\n. Thanks @LoreleiAurora! This is great. I'm going to do some testing before merging, but things look like they're on the right track.\n. This worked out really well. I'm going to merge now and then adjust a couple things. I think we can switch to a more generic php-config or php-fpm-config directory in the VVV structure to make future upgrades slightly better.\n. +1, it would be great to have some better documentation on this process. In most cases, git pull && vagrant provision should do the trick, but it can sometimes be hard to guarantee that.\n. @westonruter Hmm. I think the WP core tests have gotten quite a bit quicker. The last time I ran them inside the VM, it took ~8 minutes while my local environment was around 3 minutes. Just now though, the VM tests took less than 2 minutes. I think I might be going crazy.\n. I finally got around to checking this out. \nStarting in a ~/Development/vvv directory.\nWhen I vagrant up, I see the message \"Bringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider\", but when I open the VirtualBox GUI I see \"vvv\" as the machine name.\nIf I change directories to ~/Development/vvv/www/wordpress-develop and run vagrant ssh or vagrant up again, nothing changes. If I run vagrant halt and then vagrant up again, my box name inside the GUI changes to \"wordpress-develop\". So it seems that a box needs to be powered on to receive a new name.\nAs mentioned in #865, this poses the biggest problem when you run multiple instances of VVV from different project directories that have the same subdirectory names.\nExample:\n ~/Development/project-one/vvv/\n ~/Development/project-two/vvv/\nThis creates a situation in which there are two boxes named \"vvv\". Conflict!\nI think the ways around this are:\n\nIf you setup a second VVV instance, make sure you use a Customfile to configure the box name manually.\nSet the box name so that it is absolutely unique with a hash of the full path to the Vagrantfile as mentioned in #865.\nSet the box name so that it is likely unique by adding a short random number to the end of the name.\n\nIn the last two, we would also want to generate the directory name based on the project, not the working directory.\nI was previously worried about making this change in a minor release of VVV, but I don't think that's an issue as it seems to require only a reboot of the VM and won't cause real issues with stability.. Thanks for the pull request, @meitar!\n. It is now possible for each site to have it's own Customfile which is selectively fired based on a YAML configuration. See #980. :tada: \n. I missed this one. Looks excellent! :+1: \n. > I would like to blind merge this for testing\n@cfoellmann +1 I'd be okay with you merging this into the feature branch whenever you'd like. I'll pay closer attention soon. :)\n. VVV provides both the current release of WordPress (e.g. 4.4) and the current release being developed. This should help with testing and developing plugins for the current and future. Adding additional versions for testing is definitely doable after that, though you will need to manage how your plugin/theme is installed in each of those directories. It's kind of like a shared host on your local machine. :)\n. @keegoid, of course! I'm happy to hear you're liking open source. :)\n. Thanks @cobyan!\n. We're close on merging this, but I want to gather some decisions in #562 first.\n. Now's a good a time as any. :) Let's try it out. Thanks @ntwb!\n. Thanks for opening this issue, I'm going to close it as a duplicate of #848 which is just slightly older. :). @tdlm This probably depends a bit on the size of the git repository. As @PascaleBeier mentioned, the speed at which files are synced by VirtualBox can be much slower than when managing the files locally. I personally would recommend using git outside of the virtual machine if possible.\nYou may also want to try something like git gc to clean up the repository and increase performance if it's been going for a while and not cleaning up automatically for some reason.\n. > At this point are we not far enough that we can abstract\n\nthis portion of the nginx.conf out into something like a\n'lagacy-ms-nginx.conf' file or similar?\n\nYes! I keep on forgetting that this is part of the config. Let's fix it. :)\n. Thanks for the PR, @meitar! I think there's an opportunity to continue improving these instructions and this is a good addition.\n. I've created https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/876 to discuss this further.\n. A long time coming. :)\nI'd like our default to be MariaDB 10 in VVV. We can also provide MySQL Sandbox, but we can handle that in #835.. Excellent, thanks @ottok! I just updated the Ubuntu 16.04 ticket (#954). I don't see us updating until at least mid next year, if not later.. Thanks @keegoid, this looks great!\nI've been meaning to look into ShellCheck some more. It may be nice to setup Travis to run a lint against VVV for every PR to help with testing and merging.\n. Thanks @kadimi! This was merged in via #920.\n. Hi @GuerrillaCoder, thanks for opening an issue.\nThe xdebug.idekey is set to VVVDEBUG in VVV's xdebug.ini file, which is copied over during provisioning.\nYou could probably maintain a custom version of that and copy it over in provision-post.sh.\n. /config/php-config/php-custom.ini is the (possibly poorly named) official VVV custom PHP config, so it's okay that it's part of the repository.\n. Thanks for the PR @khromov! I'm more than happy to merge this in, though I haven't used the VMWare configuration at all myself. I'd like to get a +1 if possible from others using VMWare.\nMy only concern is that a box change is probably considered breaking in that someone would need to back-up all of their work before provisioning.\n. Ok, it looks like the next version of VVV is going to be best with a full destroy and provision, so it would be the right time to update the box if necessary.\nBoth the current box and the new box have about 10,000 downloads through https://atlas.hashicorp.com/boxes/. There are a few others that have hundreds of thousands of downloads. Is it possible that another box is the right answer for the long term? https://atlas.hashicorp.com/geerlingguy/boxes/ubuntu1404 looks like it may have some promise.\nI'm not opposed to using the suggested box, but I want to make sure we're getting this right for the next couple years.\nAlso - we may need a new PR that just replaces the box name. I can cherry-pick if needed, but a clean PR would be helpful.\n. I'm going to close this PR and defer to #1074 as the new issue for tracking the state of this. I think we need a new PR that uses the geerlingguy box and is based against a more recent version of the develop branch.. #945 is merged, so we should be good here. My guess is that the php5-common or other package we used to use came with php-zip by default. The php7.0 repository must not include it.\n. Hi @AndreaBarghigiani, thanks for opening an issue. I hope things have started to work for you since April. :)\nIf not...\n- What version of Vagrant is installed?\n- What version of VirtualBox is installed?\n- What version of VVV are you using?\n. I'm going to close this out, but please feel free to continue discussion. We can always reopen if needed.\n. Hi @dwenaus, thanks for opening an issue. Sorry about the wait. :)\nBlackfire looks interesting, but I don't see it being an officially supported profiler. This may be the perfect thing for configuring through provision-post.sh though.\n. Hey, that looks really slick @goblindegook!\n. Good info in this ticket. :) I've converted it to a docs ticket so that we can include it in some more official Windows troubleshooting and preparedness.\n. Hi @alexidro, sorry to leave you waiting.\nIt's probably possible, though it may involve quite a bit. If I were going to do it, I'd probably map the other www drive to /var/www/ inside the VM as part of a Customfile and then use provision-post.sh to setup the nginx config, etc... That's stretching the bounds quite a bit though.\nThere may be a way in Customfile to unmount the existing directory and re-mount another, but I haven't looked into that at all.\n. The Virtualbox GUI will probably show you a standard console. In that case, the default user/pass should be vagrant/vagrant as suggested by the base box guidelines. I'm guessing the issue causing the repeated auth failure is probably related to #375.\n. I'm going to close this in favor of #887, which appears to be the same thing.\n. I'm hoping this was an issue in the initial upgrade to PHP7.0. I just tested on the current develop branch and xdebug is working as expected.\nSome better upgrade management documentation is in our future. :)\n. Hi @joelworsham, thanks for the report. Were you running phpunit with the WordPress core unit tests or for another project? I haven't needed to install php-xml for the core tests yet, but it's always possible something changed in php7.\n. I have a feeling strange things can happen.\nThat's probably my best answer. \ud83d\ude04 \nIn all seriousness, I use Cisco AnyConnect on a pretty regular basis with both VVV and another VM and haven't had any trouble yet\u2014even without any commands to reroute IPs. There are probably a wide variety of client settings in the VPN client that may affect this though.\n. I'm going to close this out, but please feel free to leave any additional information. Good stuff for anyone running into the same issues.\n. This is pretty freakin cool, thanks @ericmann. \ud83d\udc4f \nEverything installed well during provisioning and I was able to flip back and forth by changing the backend in the config for http://vvv.dev/phpinfo/ without much effort. It looks like it would be even easier to do the cookie switching for the WP sites. The changeset itself is very straight forward, so it's pretty easy to follow. \ud83d\udcaf \nA few quick thoughts/questions/first impressions:\n- How does remote debugging play into all of this? Is the xdebug configuration shared or is that up to the individual PHP docker images?\n- How does this work with command line tools such as phpunit and wp? It would be pretty fantastic to run a suite of tests against multiple versions.\n- It appears that PHP's configuration for each of these is deployed inside the Docker container. Does VVV have any control over that configuration or is it shipped as part of the upstream package?\n- We have quite a bit of progress on PHPBrew in tickets such as #854. It would be interesting to compare some pros/cons of each approach.\n- My one immediate hesitation is that the docker images for each version of PHP seem to always be running in the background, even when not in use. Maybe a command similar to PHPBrew could make sense where it makes a single image available at a time as the backend.\nWould like to hear others thoughts on this as well.\n\nThere is no PHP 5.2 container as that version pre-dates FPM availability\n\nI believe it's possible with a php-fpm patch, but seems uuuuuughhhly and unfriendly.\n. Thanks for the effort on creating and documenting this PR, @ericmann. I appreciate the possibilities here and the work!\nI'm going to close this in favor of providing PHPBrew as the default approach via VVV-Utilities. In the newer provisioning configuration slated for 2.0.0, it will be possible to disable this and replace it with some custom, like Docker support.. Hi @allisongrey, thanks for taking the time to open an issue. This sounds like the right thing to pass to the support team for the All In One WP Migration plugin. The MySQL configuration in VVV should not alter how this plugin works.\nI would also recommend looking at something like WP CLI in the future for migrating sites.\n. I run the other way when I hit a SOAP project, but it's nice to have when you need it. \ud83d\udc4d \nThanks, @GaryJones!\n. vagrant ssh -c \"sudo service mysql stop\", though I'm also not sure why SSH forwarding would conflict with this. :)\n. Hi @jonathan-dejong, thanks for opening an issue.\ninit-custom.sql is still supported as the way to ensure basic database information is available during provisioning. There may be a smarter way to do this in the future, but we'll maintain back-compat here as long as possible.\nSome other DB processing, mainly auto backups, has been dropped by default in the past unless the vagrant triggers plugin is installed.\n. Hi @neilgee, thanks for all of the detailed info. I wonder what happened that caused the VM to corrupt the data. \ud83d\ude26 \nI'm going to close this out, but it's a nice set of data for future searchers.\n. Great idea, thanks @rene-hermenau!\n. Hi @coffeeneed. I'm not sure how this can happen. It sounds like Vagrant and VirtualBox have somehow become disconnected. You may want to check out the Vagrant repository for support.\n. I'm \ud83d\udc4d on shiny diffs.\n. Let's give it a shot. :) Thanks @jdevalk!\n. Hi @heinhoang, thanks for opening an issue. Is this the full copy/paste of output from provisioning? It seems like provisioning doesn't actually run, but that just the box is started. What response do you get when attempting to access local.wordpress.dev?\n. @antoscarface can you try the develop branch of VVV and see if there is any change?\n. Great! I'm a little worried that master was broken for you, but also happy that develop is good. :)\n. Thanks @dlackty!\n. Hi @pvanbavel. It's possible that the error is related to the Vagrant Triggers plugin, but it's hard to tell. What happens if you run vagrant up after uninstalling that plugin?\nvagrant plugin uninstall vagrant-triggers\n. Good to hear. The plugin is not necessary, only if you'd like to run additional scripts (based on triggers) during up, halt, reload, etc... Really there isn't too much use for it overall unless you are doing quite a bit of custom provisioning.\n. Thanks for the PR @hello-jason! I was just reading the release notes for git 2.9 and then saw my VVV vm was running 1.9.1, so yeah... I agree. :)\n. #959 removes trunk from provisioning. We should probably have documentation for how to add a vvv-init script that keeps it going if it is part of your daily workflow.\n. Fixed in #959.\n. Thanks for kicking off the discussion @brianjking and @DrewAPicture!\nI'm leaning toward GitHub Pages for how simple it would be to maintain. The workflows there should be pretty straight forward to define for updating documentation via pull request.\nIt would be great to work toward a structure that could provide documentation in multiple languages. I think that would be possible in Jekyll using something like https://github.com/Anthony-Gaudino/jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin. It would not be too difficult to move from GitHub Pages to self-hosted Jekyll when that time comes.\n\nRegardless, VVV needs better documentation and I'm happy to help in whatever way I can. What is the next step?\n\nExcellent! I think the next step is for me to create a repository.\nOnce we have the repository, we can toss around some possibilities for data architecture. This will also involve combing through open and closed issues to find where FAQs have been answered and not properly documented elsewhere yet.\n. Ok. The documentation repository is at https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/varyingvagrantvagrants.org, which is where it will live for at least the near term. If a better solution comes up that will help integrate that repo with this one, we can do that. If not, what we have now is better than what we did. :smile: \n. Oops! Thanks @weskoop!\n. Went through the commit log through October 2015 and I don't think we're missing anyone.\n. Hi @linjielig, thank you for opening a ticket. I agree, we should be able to find a service that is more likely to be accessible throughout the world.\n. In #1048, the wget call has been changed to wget --tries=3 --timeout=5 --spider --recursive --level=2 http://google.com 2>&1 | grep 'connected', which should help here. If not, we may need to find a more reliable domain than google.com to start with.. Thanks @mikkamp, I think this is a great idea. If 5.7 is available, I would be in favor of that as well. If not, then 5.6 is \ud83d\udc4d \n. Fixed via https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/varyingvagrantvagrants.org/pull/3 and up at https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/documentation/references/php-extensions/\n. Hi @ishandutta2007, thanks for opening an issue. At first glance, this seems like more of a general Vagrant question - https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant / https://vagrantup.com.\nIt may be helpful to reproduce the issue with no provisioning on a base box to try and narrow down possibilities.\n. I'm going to close this out, but please feel free to continue discussion. We can always reopen if needed.\n. From #953, for an initial configuration of VVV...\n- develop is probably the best branch to use, though will be unstable from time to time\n- We should have more releases to make master more stable\n- develop is the right branch for git clone to encourage contributions.\n- Instructions should be available for running master or specific tagged versions.\n. That's true, and somewhere where we can split the instructions up and be clear.\nInstallation instructions on varyingvagrantvagrants.org should lean toward how to retrieve the latest stable version. Instructions attached to this repository should favor the develop branch and probably be oriented more around contribution.\n. I'm going to start working on this for the 2.0.0 release. I think it's time we finally had something in place. I'll submit a PR for input in the near future. :). This is now open as a pull request. https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1118. And merged in #1118. :). This is fixed in #1073.. Hi @eno812, thanks for stopping by.\nThere isn't yet a well documented procedure for this. We have a new area for documentation that I'm hoping to populate with some good instructions. #845 has some discussion that will turn into documentation at some point.\nLoosly:\n- Update Vagrant when needed\n- Update VirtualBox when needed\n- vagrant box update when needed\n- git pull origin develop (or master) from VVV and vagrant provision to apply changes\n. Agreed. It would be great to have some documentation covering how to use WPCS in various editors and at the command line.\nIf anyone would like to start writing something up, a pull request against https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/varyingvagrantvagrants.org would be excellent.\n. Thanks for the PR, @diddledan. I hate to disappoint, but I've closed #968. Providing curl and wget doesn't seem necessary now as all of the other provisioners should support wget. Thank you for your effort!. I've gone back and forth on this a bit, but the maintenance cost of having Docker as another provider supported by VVV seems like it will be too high. Sorry to keep you hanging on this pull request for so long, and thanks for the effort you've put into it.. As this alters the xdebug_on homebin file, a vagrant provision is required to move it to the correct place for usage.\n. This doesn't appear to be working. I'm going to close it in favor of the conversation on the other ticket.\n. Fixed in #1013 \n. This is up here https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/varyingvagrantvagrants.org/pull/4, looking to release in the next few hours. :)\n. Using this as the issue to walk through some release steps as well.\nJust ran through vagrant up from scratch. Current versions:\n```\nvagrant@vvv:~$ php --version\nPHP 7.0.12-1+deb.sury.org~trusty+1 (cli) ( NTS )\nvagrant@vvv:~$ nginx -v\nnginx version: nginx/1.11.5\nvagrant@vvv:~$ mysql --version\nmysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.5.53, for debian-linux-gnu (x86_64) using readline 6.3\nvagrant@vvv:~$ npm --version\n3.10.9\nvagrant@vvv:~$ node --version\nv6.9.1\n```\n. Hi @ecrookes, thanks for opening an issue.\nI'm wondering if something tripped up provisioning and interrupted the mv line here somehow - https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/blob/develop/provision/provision.sh#L686-L688\nThere's a good chance that running vagrant provision again after the initial run would resolve the issue.\nI've run provisioning from scratch a few times recently getting things prepped for the next release and haven't run into this issue yet, so I'm hopeful it's a one off.\n. I'm going to go ahead and close this out. Feel free to comment and/or re-open if this appears again.. Excellent, I'm not sure why I wasn't able to find the right name for it the other day. Thanks!\n. Thanks @LoreleiAurora! And thanks @cfoellmann for testing! :)\n. Hi @joelworsham, thanks for opening an issue with this information. I'm going to tag #854 so that it's referenced there as that is still an open pull request / feature.. I haven't had time to dig in yet, but I want to leave a note of general support for this. I'll take a closer look over the next few days. Thank you @LoreleiAurora!\n. Ok! Now that 1.4.0 is released, let's have some fun. :smile: \nI tested this out and things are absolutely wonderful. I'm going to merge now and then we can iron out a couple things once it's in the develop branch. I'll create issues for each of these:\n1. We've lost temporary access to vvv.dev as it was part of the default vvv-hosts file. We'll probably need to restore vvv-hosts just for that.\n2. After seeing how well this is working for the individual WP repos, I think it makes sense to break out phpmyadmin, memcached-admin, opcache-status, and webgrind into their individual VVV repos so that they can be selectively disabled.\n3. I like all of the config names in the YAML file. It may be cool to one day support zip/tar packages as well, but I'm not sure how often that would be used.\n4. An option to provide a custom YAML file. If say vvv-custom.yml is provided, then we defer to that instead of the version controlled copy. This will make it easier to customize while staying updated with the upstream project.\n5. @cfoellmann let's start a new issue to track the inclusion of multisite configs by default. I'm a bit wary of going too crazy with the repos, but it definitely will be useful to determine what's needed.\nThanks for all the work on this @LoreleiAurora! Such a great move forward for VVV. :100: \n. Hi @roelveldhuizen, thanks for taking the time to submit a PR. This seems like something that would be great as part of a custom installation, but I don't see including this as part of the core configuration.. Thanks for opening an issue @jjeaton. I think it would be nice to switch the provisioning for WP-CLI to the \"official\" process. For those that contribute to directly to WP-CLI, it should be relatively painless to setup a custom config. For those that don't, it will be much easier to keep updated with wp cli update --nightly.. We should definitely add some documentation around PHP versions. Once we have some PHP version swapping available (like Eric mentioned above), then the documentation can be even more helpful. ;)\n. The ability to provision a site with PHP 5.6, 7.0, or 7.1 via #1055 should help this.. This takes a combination of two things (which we should have documented as well):\nThe VVV Utilities repo has provisioning for PHP 5.6 in addition to PHP 7.0. In VVV's vvv-config.yml or in a custom config, php56 will need to be added to the core utilities configuration:\nutilities:\n  core:\n    - memcached-admin\n    - opcache-status\n    - phpmyadmin\n    - webgrind\n    - php56\nAnd then, the nginx_upstream needs to be set for the site in the config:\nwordpress-default:\n    repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-wordpress-default.git\n    hosts:\n      - local.wordpress.dev\n    nginx_upstream: php56\nRunning vagrant provision will provision both PHP 5.6 and the wordpress-default site. If PHP 5.6 is already available and you want to change a site from the default PHP 7.0 upstream to PHP 5.6, then only vagrant provision --provision-with=site-wordpress-default is necessary.. @miguelangeltorresfp if you are on the latest version of VVV, local.wordpress-trunk.dev is no longer provisioned automatically. See https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/959\nIf you have upgraded, and it was working before, it should still be available.\nWas this an existing VVV installation that was upgraded or a new installation of 1.4.0?. Hi @MortalCatalyst, thanks for sharing this info.\nTo explain a bit further, mysql: unrecognized service should be an indication that something failed during provisioning. In this example it's likely that mysql failed to install at all. Without a log of the full vagrant up or vagrant provision, it's hard to determine the exact cause, but it does make sense that vagrant up --provision works.. @kapilpaul The 1.4.0 release of VVV loops though all of your directories to look for individual provision files for each of your sites.\nThe develop branch of VVV, which should currently be considered unstable, has a new provisioning process that we're still working out the details on. See #1046 and #980 as well as the documentation in progress at https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/varyingvagrantvagrants.org/pull/7\nI would recommend sticking with the stable version for now as things are still likely to change. If you'd like to dig further, I'd recommend reading through those previous pull requests to become familiar with the configuration.\nI'm going to close this issue out for now as it seems to be a side-effect of the process not being completely documented yet. Please feel free to open new issues with specific bugs. Thanks!. Yes, it should be much cleaner to manage these as part of a YAML config. It would still be nice for the external site repos to provide their own associated hosts though.. Hi @grks, thanks for opening an issue. You're right, it does look like this is not executable like the other files in this directory. It's surprising this hasn't been noticed! Maybe a good indicator of how often people are restoring databases. :). Hi @dutchmichael, thanks for the PR. This was purposely left in vvv-hosts for backward compatibility as we don't actually delete the directory or the config, it just isn't setup on new provisions.. Hi @cagross, thanks for stopping by. It looks like the vagrant up results in the pastebin are from a fresh provision of the VM. Note the [not installed] next to all of the packages at the beginning.\nIn this case, I would expect a fresh WordPress installation unless a backed up copy of your previous installation was available, especially if it is at one of the default URLs provided by VVV.\nFrom the NVM and WP-CLI messages, it looks like there was a previous provision of the VM that no longer exists, but the files in the www/ directory remain. Is it possible that something happened to the virtual machine that destroyed it?. > Currently, Vagrant is still mostly a black-box to me. So when something goes wrong, there's not too much troubleshooting I can do.\nCompletely understood. We still have quite a bit to do with documentation. I'm hoping things like #961 and #605 will help with this in the not too distant future. :)\nThanks for following up!. Hi @MrVibe, thanks for opening an issue. Can you destroy the VM with vagrant destroy and then copy the contents of the next vagrant up into a gist (gist.github.com) or something similar so that we can see the entire provisioning process to look for errors?. Excellent, happy to hear it's back!. The new provisioning process is still a work in progress. See #1035 for the effort to document the changes.\nOnce we have a few things settled, it will be easier to determine (before the 2.0.0 release) what can be improved. In the meantime, please open new issues for any specific suggestions to markup changes in the YAML configuration.. > This is still not clearly answering my question. I am not interested in the past, I am interested in how its done on your current dev versions.\n@nextgenthemes The changes to the provisioning process in the development branch will be documented properly before VVV 2.0.0 is released. See #1035\nFor now, the documentation reflects the provisioning process from 1.4.0 and earlier. You can get a copy of the stable version of VVV at https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/releases/tag/1.4.0\nIt's tough to parse what seems like a mix of support questions and enhancement suggestions, especially on something that's still in progress. Please appreciate the attempts to help.. :+1: . Hi @corysimmons, thanks for opening an issue. Can you expand on your request? How do you see markdown-toc being used as part of the VVV project? Is this directed at the (now very long) README file or toward our newer documentation efforts? See #1049.. Thanks for the clarification, @corysimmons. Let's keep this issue open for now (I'm going to adjust the title) and then revisit after the README has been split into pieces for varyingvagrantvagrants.org via #1049 and #963. The markdown-toc project looks cool and may be useful in the future depending on how long our README ends up being.. Thanks for the PR, @dsawardekar! At first glance it looks good. I believe this will address #927 once merged.. Some more notes on possibilities here after a chat with @LoreleiAurora.\n\n@LoreleiAurora has done some cross repository builds in Travis before, so we can look to those repositories as an example.\nWe should consider the possibility of a process that submits the documentation maintained in markdown as part of the repository to a WordPress site via the REST API.\nSome form of documentation should be created against master based on the README and then merged so that it can exist in documentation/en-US/1.4.0 to show the previous state before the changes in 2.0.0 are officially released.. #963 can probably be closed as part of a pull request to add 1.4.0 documentation.. We're doing this now. :1st_place_medal: . Hi @phidomo, thanks for stopping by.\n\nI'm not sure that syncing a VM between two different operating systems is a good idea. Then unrecognized service errors that you're seeing indicate that provisioning has not run, so in the move to the new OS, the box is no longer recognized.\nI would find an alternate way to share the files between two machines rather than the VM itself. If you want to pursue the possibility of this further, then I would recommend digging into the Vagrant or VirtualBox projects more to see what's possible as it is likely not a VVV specific solution.. Looks good to me! Thanks, @LoreleiAurora!. I'm going to merge this now to have something to start with, but we can always continue to adjust the text. :smile: . No reason to keep this waiting. I'll have time to do some more testing this weekend, but I'd like to get this in earlier than later. Thanks @LoreleiAurora!. Hi @nextgenthemes, thanks for opening a ticket. I've responded to the suggestions inline. Note that since this is a new process, all changes are definitely on the table. It also means I'm not completely familiar with it yet, so we'll see how this goes. :)\nThere's probably some good background reading to be done in #980 and the various tickets and decisions that were closed as part of the initial effort to create this provisioning system.\n\nCreate a folder with the sites domain name. Would make way more sense then the current \"wordpress-local\" ... or whatever folder names to do it like sits commonly done on real webservers. It also seems the current config needs local and vm (callled provision) folders specifically set. I think they should be a default that is based on domain name.\n\nThe vm_dir directory can be used to set the directory inside the virtual machine. I think we need to remain flexible her rather than assuming the directory should match the site name.\n\nThe https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-wordpress-default.git and the other dev repo should have its setup scripts not create hard coded sites/databases but should rather read the folder they are in and take the folder name and create the database name based on that.\n\nNot every external repository will have the same structure. They may not even need a database at all. Putting the configuration at the site level allows for some nice flexibility, IMO. It may be possible in other iterations to automate a standard site setup a bit, but I do like the idea of starting with, becoming comfortable with, and documenting the basics first.\n\nAdd sites name to hosts if plugin is installed.\n\nSites may have more than one hostname. Multiple hostnames can be configured with the hosts setting for the site in the YAML file. I think this is okay as an explicit configuration.. A template approach is taken in the https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template repo, which should reduce the burden to creating a new site significantly.. Hi @jeffjg, welcome. :)\nYes, vagrant destroy destroys the virtual machine completely. All of the software and data stored inside the virtual machine is no longer available. This includes things like the MySQL databases that contain the data from a WordPress installation.\nThere are a couple scripts included with VVV that are an attempt to help with automatic backups and imports, but nothing is a replacement for creating a workflow that fits for what you're doing. Backups can be created manually through phpMyAdmin (via vvv.dev) or through the MySQL command line utility.. Hi @skorasaurus, thanks for taking the time to open a PR with your suggestions. I think you're on the right track. I want to make sure this is tackled as part of the work on #963 and #961. This will be more of a sweeping change than the smaller targeted changes proposed here. We'll get there though!. Thanks for opening a ticket, @jmichaelward!\nWe'll want to make sure our try_files directive is as follows:\ntry_files $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args;. I think this makes sense, thanks @kopepasah! I have a feeling this will impact #1065, but we'll see. :). This looks good too, thanks @kopepasah. I updated the PR after #1064 was merged in so that both --recursive and --branch were handled.. Hi @devloprs, thanks for taking the time to open a ticket.\nThis appears to be an issue either with Vagrant or one of the Vagrant plugins rather than something specific to VVV.\nStrangely enough, I just setup a fresh install of Ubuntu 16.10 today on my laptop, so I can offer at least one suggestion! :smile: \nI installed VirtualBox 5.1.12 and Vagrant 1.9.1 and had no issue installing either vagrant-hostsupdater or vagrant-hosts.\nI would recommend upgrading VirtualBox and Vagrant to those versions and trying again. Otherwise, it would be worth searching through open Vagrant issues for a possible match.. @devloprs It's the one currently available as a .deb package via https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html. The first way I thought about complicating my opinion of this was around how a single definition in the config file could result in multiple sites and how that would work with the public_html/ directory. After spending a bit more time on that, I'm probably overthinking it.\nAs long as we know that existing custom sites will continue to work fine, I'm okay to go down the path of @LoreleiAurora's proposed structure. I still wish there was a better name than public_html, only because that has Apache written all over it, but I'm not sure that there is.\nTo clarify this even further, here's what the wordpress-develop directory would result in:\n- wordpress-develop\n    - log\n    - provision\n    - public_html\n        - src/\n        - tests/\nSeparately for @JJJ - You might be the first to fully use the new GitHub issue template. If you have any thoughts on whether it was annoying or useful, I'd be happy to hear them. :smile: . I just \"deprecated\" the vvv-multisite repository. https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template should be used for this type of custom site solution.. This is really slick, thanks @tomjn!\nI'd like to revisit the name customvalue as I think it can be more descriptive. How about something like get_config_key() or get_yaml_option? Happy to hear any other ideas as well.. Great stuff, thanks @tomjn!. I like develop as the default branch, as everything on GitHub is for development. :smile: \nI think one of the objectives of cleaning up our documentation will also be to make it more obvious that other versions can be used. In an ideal world, users would use varyingvagrantvagrants.org to get started rather than GitHub.\nAt some level, we're in an unusual spot that's causing a bit of pain but will be resolved shortly. We're not often making larger changes that can impact things long term.\nAnother issue with switching back to master is that any new pull requests are automatically opened against that, so it adds another hurdle to the contributor experience.. We're going to address this with improved documentation for the 2.0.0 release. There should be a couple new clear indicators as to what version is being used and a prod to use the master branch if using git and not developing. The develop branch will still be the default on GitHub.. > To make translations easier later i thing the structure should be more like docs/en-US\nI spaced on this.  Updated! :)\n. This looks good, @LoreleiAurora. Can you update it so that there are no changes to provision.sh now that #1071 is merged?. Agreed with @LoreleiAurora. I think the auto provision process served its purpose in earlier versions of VVV, but the YAML config is much more powerful. The biggest reason may be that you can target a new site for provisioning without running everything else at once.\nThanks for the suggestion, @kopepasah!. Hi @roelveldhuizen, thanks for opening an issue. We'll need to get that box back up or find an alternative.\n@ericmann Can you provide any more detail on this? :smile: . Fixed in #1307 with the phawxby/trusty64 box.. Hi @devloprs, thanks for opening an issue. Can you provide more details about the error or problem you're seeing? The pasted text above is all normal as part of provisioning. It is annoying that it switches to red for some things.\nIt would also be helpful to know your environment details - VVV version, Vagrant version, etc.... @devloprs Thanks for the additional info. I'm going to bug you for a few more pieces of information:\n\nOperating System\nVirtualBox version\nOutput of vagrant plugin list\nOutput of vagrant box list\n\nAnd from the report, I gather that the VVV-develop/www/ directory is not mapping to /srv/www/ inside the VM?. Closing this out for now, feel free to reopen if needed. :). Looks good, thanks @wvega!. Hi @Gemfruit, thanks for opening an issue! This will be resolved once VVV 2.0.0 is released via the new documentation from #1112.. Good catch, @sirbrillig, thanks for opening an issue. It may be the case too that we should move the definition for this function to the vvv-wordpress-develop repository because it is so specific.. > I think we should allow it to be overwritten from vvv-config.yml\nThat would be cool. I wonder if it would make sense to allow arbitrary environment variables to be set this way.. @tomjn - I just tried to reproduce this unsuccessfully on a new vagrant up and an existing vagrant up --provision. The portion I'm most confused by is this:\ndkms is already the newest version.\nlinux-headers-3.13.0-105-generic is already the newest version.\nI don't think we update these as part of provisioning, so it may be that something else (vbguest plugin?) is injecting this part. I'm not sure how that would cause any issues with the MariaDB install though. It's very strange that mariadb-server is failing on a dependency of what appears to be itself.\nCan you paste the output of vagrant box list and vagrant plugin list so that I can try to match the setup a bit more?\n@cinghaman It's possible that this is more related to the vv create command. Do you get the same mariadb-server error?. Good call, @tomjn. I think the current version is :100:. Thanks!. @tomjn @LoreleiAurora I'd be okay to merge this as soon as the branch is up to date. It may be easier then to process any other docs changes over the next several days through smaller PRs.\nGreat work so far!. Hi @cinghaman, can you provide some more detail for this issue? Note that we have switched from MySQL to MariaDB for the upcoming VVV 2.0.0 release.. As long as all references to MariaDB have been removed from provision.sh and any other additional provisioners, then I don't see any reason why it would be reinstalled automatically. If this is still happening, can you paste a gist containing the entire output of vagrant provision or vv create?. Ahh, one other place actually! In the apt sources list, the repo for MariaDB is added. I believe since it's a MySQL drop-in replacement, it may alias an attempt to install MySQL as MariaDB instead.. @LoreleiAurora good call, thanks :) - that is handled in https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-utilities/pull/4. :+1:, thanks @LoreleiAurora!. Any progress on this @mkjonesuk?. Hi @khromov, thanks for stopping by. This is covered somewhat in the \"why is this necessary\" section at the bottom of the migration document.\nTo take your example, the old process looked like:\n1.) Clone project somewhere inside the vvv/www/ directory.\n2.) vagrant provision\nAt this point the default provisioner for VVV, as well as each site's provisioning script, would run.\nIn the new process:\n1) Add my-site: https://github.com/user/my-site.git to vvv-custom.yml\n2) vagrant provision\nSimilar to the first example, the site repo will be cloned, the default VVV provisioner will run, and each individual site's provisioning script will run.\nHowever, you could also do vagrant provision --provision-with site-my-site and only the new site's provisioner would run. You could also add skip_provisioning: true to another site's configuration so that when vagrant provision runs it does not fire that every time.\nThe flexibility gained by having a relatively simple configuration file is pretty great. Repos like custom site template can be used to quickly spin up several sites of different flavors, all sharing the same base repository. It also makes it easier to remove some of the things that VVV includes by default, which speeds up provisioning even more.\nI think over time it will make more and more sense. I've been really happy with how much easier it is to manage sites locally. There are probably some things you could add to Customfile or the pre/post provisioning process to bring back the old behavior, but I would recommend trying this out for a bit.. Oooh, I missed this before. Lovely. Thanks @nylen! \ud83d\udc4d . Thanks @ocean90! Going to squeeze this into the 2.1 release. :). Going to merge this in for the 2.1.x release. Feel free to scold me later. :). @tomjn I like that idea - Is there a way to store that data without making a remote request to GitHub each time? We could probably also combine in via the dashboard into a file that gets stored and then read for that purpose.. Hi @afercia, thanks for opening a ticket.\nI'm not completely confident in this answer, but I have a feeling this has to do with the mix of running npm and/or grunt tasks inside and outside of the VM.\nWhen phantomjs is installed in OSX, a different binary is provided than when phantomjs is installed in Ubuntu. When VVV first provisions, npm install is run in the context of its environment and will obtain the binaries used for phantomjs in Ubuntu. When you exit the VM and run it from your OSX environment, you'll see a binary error. Rebuilding retrieves the OSX binary but will mean that running the task inside the VM will now fail.\nnpm rebuild is probably a good answer for this to meet a workflow that runs grunt inside and outside the VM. Otherwise I would recommend picking one environment and using that most of the time.\nAside: You just commented with the docs that probably explain this better than me. :). > Does VVV comes with a phantomjs-prebuilt Linux version? Why a prebuilt version gets installed? Shouldn't build the proper platform version instead?\nTo clarify here - VVV does not provision phantomjs itself. NPM picks the platform specific dependency while processing wordpress-develop's package.json file. I think grunt-contrib-qunit is the actual package that requires phantomjs in this instance.\nI'm going to close this out as I don't think it's a VVV issue. Happy to reopen if necessary though.. I've setting mine to 2048 for a long while now, well before we had a vvv-custom.yml. I'd be in favor of bumping the default up, especially because it's now easy to customize to a lower value as needed.. Good call!. I haven't tested it yet, but this block appears to report a connection every time provisioning is run, even if both other checks failed. What's the issue with Windows CJK users?\n. Ahh, thank you for those details @kazurayam! We do need a much better way of performing this check.\n. Rethinking a bit, the ping here is happening inside linux, even when the host is a Windows machine.\nI'm exploring a route right now that does not use ping, but uses another, more likely to succeed on a proxy, method.\n. From the surface, this seems like it could cause an issue. Does the nesting of double quotes work?\n. s/Variable VV/Variable VVV/, right?\n. How about nginx_upstream or phpfpm_upstream? I doubt we'll ever use \"upstream\" elsewhere, but it may make it more clear.. Looks like spacing may be off just a bit in these lines.. Good point, using php here doesn't make sense.\nI'm still going to be a pain. Let's do nginx_upstream. I think that clarifies the intent of the config. :smile: . What happens here if provisioning is run on a setup that was previously using the git clone?. I'd like to see if we can look for /srv/www/wp-cli/.git if /usr/local/bin/wp exists and then reinstall with the phar. We can include - remove /srv/www/wp-cli - as part of the upgrade instructions, but it would be nice if it accounted for this as an upgrade procedure.. Huh, GitHub was hiding your previous comment from me before. :)\nThat should do the trick, though I'd leave /srv/www/wp-cli/ alone just in case somebody was using that to contribute and had branches.. Good point, @grappler. That's probably the right answer. I've stuck with this format for so long because I kind of had fun watching the list grow. But we've had a lot of contributors now, so it may be time to change. It would definitely shorten the README. :). @tomjn @LoreleiAurora From the text of the Open Font License, I think we're clear to distribute this even though VVV is MIT. I do think we should include attribution via HTML comment in this section though. https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro/blob/master/LICENSE.txt#L56-L61. Excellent, thanks!. That's true - I'll remove the dates so that we don't have to worry about it in this doc.. Good point, that's more consistent. . I think having something in the readme makes sense. I also opened https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/1277 the other day to address CONTRIBUTING.md.. ",
    "TheLastCicada": "Use an SSH tunnel - it is good practice for how I always set this up on live servers.  \n(forwarding the port is fine too - I just don't open up that port on production)\n. I'll write this up for the wiki as soon as I create 3 stage sites for people today\n. This is now documented in the wiki for both connection methods.\n. The apt-get statements keep it updated though without user intervention, and there is value there.  And like you said, you can just do 'vagrant suspend' if you'd like to boot quickly.  \nIt doesn't take much time to run through all those for me, but one thing I'd like to avoid running every time is apt-get update.  This goes out to the web to update all your local package data - it'd be great if it didn't always try to connect to the web upon boot.  However, if these packages aren't updated, it pretty much negates the benefits of my first statement saying it'll keep software up to date.  The other option I see here is moving this stuff to a system cron that runs @monthly or something. Don't know how that handles missed runs if the vagrant is halted when the monthly update time rolls around.  \nOr we could not worry about it assuming we'll be using Chef in the future :)\n. Moving this to the develop branch\n. This does sound like plugin territory.  If not, I can likely come up with something.\n.

I think I see what you are saying....put wp-cli in a shared Vagrant folder so that people can easily work on wp-cli code inside or outside of Vagrant, then test it on their Vagrant WordPress install.

Is the bleeding edge version stable enough for people to just use it day to day if they aren't doing development with it?  I also wouldn't want people to come across undocumented changes in wp-cli that throws them off.

I vote for both....I think your development environment should have the latest and greatest by default so that you code to those standards.  This is a problem if you are supporting sites with old versions of PHP and whatnot, but in that case, you'll need to customize your Vagrant to match that anyways.  Thoughts?\n. Since this Vagrant is only provisioned with 512 MB of RAM, allowing half of that to be used by APC seems excessive.  Part of the goal here was to create a development environment that uses Memcached and Batcache to simulate what many larger WordPress sites use for caching.  If you are using APC as the object cache backend rather than Memcached, it would make more sense to allocate the Memcached resources to APC instead.  I haven't looked into this, but I assume neither Memcached nor APC actually allocate that RAM until it is used, so you could probably have both available and just use one or the other.  And now I have talked myself into arguing your point.  \nSo - here is my main question - how much RAM do we want to allocate to caching in a 512 MB environment?  And I like the small footprint at 512 MB to keep it accessible, so I'd rather not change that.\n. That is what I'm thinking.... originally I had thought of APC as opcode only and Memcached for object caching and page caching.  But we do use APC for object caching on some of our sites and it would be nice to be able to replicate that in VVV.  @markjaquith - do you think 128 MB would be enough for APC object caching in a development environment?  I usually set it to 256 MB on live servers, but assume we can get away with less in development since not everything on the site will be used all at once.\n. Son of a b, I'm drawn to the close button instead of comment for some reason....\n. I think this goes back to our previous discussion of what is appropriate on the 512 MB basic box.  If you crank up the RAM of the VM, then 256 or 128 MB makes a lot more sense.  Maybe we can set this during provisioning to be 1/8th of the system RAM?  That way if you resize your Vagrant, you'll automatically get more cache space to play with.  I will preempt you and note that this would easy to do with Puppet (or Salt or Chef).  \n@markjaquith I've been using http://livebookmark.net/journal/2008/05/21/memcachephp-stats-like-apcphp/ to view memcached statistics and have been finding most sites use way less cache space than I anticipated (or initially allocated), making me think 64 MB might be plenty in most scenarios.  What has your experience been?\n. In the provision script, could we just parse the output of ifconfig to get\nthis value? Could use sed or awk or grep or some combo to parse this.\nOn Jul 19, 2013 4:42 PM, \"Weston Ruter\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI'm no Ruby developer, but if we could get a script to evaluate the\nVagrantfile and export the config values, then we could read it in using\nthe provision script or any other scripts.\nAlso, if we settle on a hostname (per #105https://github.com/10up/varying-vagrant-vagrants/issues/105),\nthen we can replace references to visit http://192.168.50.4 in the\nprovision script and in the README.md with references to visit\nhttp://vvv.dev/ (for example).\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/10up/varying-vagrant-vagrants/issues/94#issuecomment-21283758\n.\n.

NFS shares with Vagrant/VirtualBox are not supported in Windows, so in the interest of maximum compatibility, we went with the VirtualBox default shared folders.  They are definitely lower performance than NFS, so if you are comfortable making the change to NFS on your install of VVV, I absolutely recommend it.  However, we've not had much of an issue with the shared folder performance - for nearly all of our needs, they have been sufficient.

I would lean towards keeping both as well.  Little downside but I can definitely think of some advantages.\n. I think the better way to do this is to add \"default_server\" to the listen directive in Nginx for this server block.  See http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/request_processing.html.  That way, requests will always default to that server regardless of what the file is named if they do not match a server_name elsewhere.\n.

You cannot create symlinks outside of Vagrant and have them work inside Vagrant.  This is a pretty non-negotiable way that file systems work.  \n\nThere are also some issues when creating symlinks inside Vagrant, but I don't believe that is what we are discussing here, unless I am mistaken.\n. I would agree with this.  Don't think this is high priority to fix, but just about any password would be less confusing than this - I had the same experience the first time :-)\n. Only thing is the confusion when we change it of everyone who is expecting it to be \"blank\".  Suppose we can highlight that in the documentation or the change-log right up top.  Maybe a message during provisioning that the ROOT MYSQL PASSWORD HAS CHANGED or something?  \nChalk this up to \"seemed like a good idea at the time...\"\n. The biggest one is the deprecation of the original mysql extension that is\nused by WordPress to connect to the database.  That results in a ton of\nwarnings in the log files.

The thinking being we never make much effort to update the base box, but if you have no network and you have the .box file, you could conceivably start VVV, have all your provisioning scripts fail, but still have something basically functional to work with.  Sure, software would be old, but the basics would work.  Then when you run provisioning sometime later, all the software gets updated and now you are up to date.  \n\nThis might be a terrible idea - was just thinking about this and wanted to throw it out there.\n. @ryanduff A CentOS/Puppet (maybe Salt instead...) version of VVV is something I've been thinking about for a while as well.  Would definitely be interested in collaborating on that.  \nAgree that a provisioner other than bash would make my idea of a pre-provisioned box easier.  Still think it would work fine using bash as long as the upgrade path of the software is as simple as adding the ppa and doing \"apt-get install nginx\".  I could see that failing when the repos contain multiple versions of the software.... such as \"php\" and \"php55\".  However, I'm not convinced that would be that hard to overcome.\n. The vagrant-triggers plugin looks interesting - gives an easy way to accomplish this if it works.  I agree with the sentiment that this isn't a stable environment and it should be thought of at totally volatile, but I like to save myself from myself where I can and think this would be a real nice thing to have.  If I find some time to work on it, I'll let you know.\n. I am in favor of this idea\n. Are the majority of these settings in my.cnf what came with the package?  For instance, did we set this variable to 16M for any reason?\nhttps://github.com/10up/varying-vagrant-vagrants/blob/master/config/mysql-config/my.cnf#L51\n. I think we should leave it in here as a place to customize it if desired.  Give me a minute and I'll get rid of your error though....\n. I edited the my.cnf - you probably should test those changes as I don't have the latest version locally to test with.  I also should have done it as a pull request, but was lazy and didn't :-/\n. This should take care of this error:\n[Warning] Using unique option prefix key_buffer instead of key_buffer_size is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please use the full name instead.\n. Totally agree with your reasoning here @jeremyfelt .  I've seen lots of people grab the Nginx config from VVV and use it on their live site, so I'd rather keep the Nginx configs setup as they would be for a production site.  That being said, everyone can feel free to customize their VVV version to work however they'd like.  \n@jeremyfelt - maybe we should add an include file nginx-custom.conf in each server { } block where people could put their custom Nginx configs that they can use whenever re-provisioning?  Could see it being annoying if you want stuff customized in the Nginx configs and that being overwritten every time you update to the latest VVV.....\n.

Not sure when I'll have time to look at it as I have another hobby project consuming my free time at the moment, but this is high on my list.  I'd love to see a project on Github that @lkwdwrd, @jeremyfelt, myself, and @mastef could work on to try explore how to best use this in relation to VVV.  Is this something everyone is interested in?  If so, can someone set that up? (Everybody in this conversation is more competent at Github than myself)\n. Am planning on starting from scratch and working on Docker in Vagrant this weekend to see what all the fuss is about.  If I come up with something, I'll share it here or compare notes with @lkwdwrd first - I know he has the start to something as well.  I am going to assume that our first couple of attempts at this might not have the right approach at all, so let's all accept that it is fine to start on something here and then scrap it completely as we learn :-)\n. That's a good idea - I'll start mine in a branch then..... assuming I can figure out how to do that in Git :)\n. The 2 things I'd be concerned about are:\n\na.)  crappy shared drive performance - more writes to the shared drives means slower everything in general.  Granted, I haven't had this problem myself and if we get the db off the shared drives, there's a lot more room for other stuff to use that pipe.\nb.)  Logs in weird places = logs not being rotated (unless you fix your logrotate scripts to know where they are).  As this is a dev environment with no real traffic, this is not an issue as far as I can see, but then again, I don't think I've considered every use case.  Regardless, this is solvable with some testing and custom logrotate entries.  \nIf those aren't a concern, I feel like this is a big win in usability and getting people to look at the logs while they develop, a big pet peeve of mine.  I think this is worth figuring out how to do.\n. Since we're going to fund this work 2 cents at a time, here's mine....\nThe question of licensing is more one of mission for this project.  The 2 options are....\n1.  Is it meant to be a fully open source platform always open to everyone to use non-commercially for local development?  If you don't like that mission, create your own Vagrant and leave VVV out of it.  This sounds like GPL from what I'm hearing.\nor...\n1.  Is this meant to be a useful tool, supported by an open source community, that can be used for or altered to do whatever you want, commercial or non-commercial, to meet the needs of the absolute most people and use cases, regardless of what weird restrictions they may need to put on it.  This sounds to me like MIT.\nIf I think back to when this project started (and @jeremyfelt can tell me if I have revisionist history here), we didn't set out to create god's gift to development environments, it was supposed to show what you could do with Vagrant in making a local development environment match what in on a production server and make that approachable.  The point was that this would work well enough, but if you had specific needs or you wanted a Vagrant environment to match your host setup (say WPEngine or Dreamhost or you run it with Apache) that you'd use VVV as a reference, but you'd go setup your own Vagrantfile and box and share it on Github yourself, or not share it at all.  If that is still the mission here, then GPL seems appropriate as it makes no attempts to cater to these individual use cases.  There's nothing stopping anyone from building their own Vagrant development environment that looks a lot like VVV and keeping that in-house and slapping a restrictive license on it - there's no patent on \"apt-get install nginx\" (I'm screwed if there is).  All the tools that built this are free, it isn't magic.  If you are going to use VVV, then it is free and you can deal with it.  This could have the side-effect of other Vagrant development environments making it out into the world, which would be a good thing from my point of view.  \nThat being said, I see lots of merits in the MIT license as well and could be persuaded.  It comes down to what the goal of this project is and what the mission is.\n. I'm onboard with whatever license you choose @jeremyfelt as I have confidence that you've put more thought into this than I ever will, and therefore trust your desicion 100%.  Approval granted from me.\n. @danielbachhuber PLEASE CLOSE YOUR CAN OF WORMS AND MOVE ALONG SIR\n. Hope that can be useful to you.  Please note that this was merely the minimum amount of setup to make Varnish work for my own testing - nothing polished at all.  However, Varnish did work via these changes - good luck!\n. I'd love to help, but I have no recollection of what was ever at that link or this conversation :)\n. This has happened to me with the latest version of PHP-FPM on all sorts of servers.  I believe the default permissions on the socket changed and now don't let Nginx read it.  Do you want to create a pull request to uncomment those lines?  Honestly, it would probably work with only https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/blob/master/config/php5-fpm-config/www.conf#L46 uncommented if you want to try that.\n. Making the listen mode 0666 should make the socket read/write for all, so no explicit user needs to be set, though there is no harm in doing so.  Since this upgrade has been so annoying about it, I no longer trust that they aren't just going to break that listen mode in the next release, so this is probably the safest answer anyways.  Thanks @tnorthcutt for making it happen!\n. Agree with @simonwheatley - we often use VVV to work on old multisites that we inherit and are working on.  I'd like these to work out of the gate without any fiddling with Nginx.  Also, if this is a WP multisite install that has existed since before /files/ was phased out, I believe it still uses that same data structure even if you've upgraded to 3.9 - I don't think WP rearranges all your files, it just makes that change for new sites going forward (could be wrong on that point).  So it seems rather likely that the old /files/ rewrite is necessary for a number of users.\n. Databases should be preserved on vagrant halt and suspend though - those don't remove the vagrant filesystem.  Only vagrant destroy should get rid of the databases.  \nI do still agree that the wording should be stronger in the instructions to make it clear what the repercussions of not using triggers is.\n. I support this change as well - we have this set on all stage servers we setup where databases are created and destroyed frequently and I also use this setting on many live sites.  I've never noticed any hit in performance - and if there is, I'd consider it very minor.  I agree with all of the points made by @ericmann.\n.

While not a nice solution here is what I have done to avoid it in Windows:\n* System 1: vagrant up then vagrant halt\n* System 2: vagrant up then vagrant halt\n* System 1:\n * Open the 'id' file and copy the uuid from: {your dropbox path}/vagrant-local/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/id\n * Open the 'VirtualBox.xml': %userprofile%/.VirtualBox/VirtualBox.xml\n * Replace the current uuid under <MachineEntry uuid=\"{ REPLACE UUID }\" src=\"PATH TO .VBOX FILE\"> (~line 21)\n * Open the .vbox file in the above lines src entry\n * Replace the current uuid under <Machine uuid=\"{ REPLACE UUID }\" (~line 9)\nStill have to be careful with both VMs running as the databases might conflict due to them being in use.\nHope that helps!\n. I now see you meant one system. I figured with a Dropbox you were sharing.\nI probably can't answer that with good data. When I halt a VM it tends to fail on me due to a Virtualbox error related to networking. In this case I was believing it didn't clean itself up properly (maybe in part due to Dropbox syncing files?) and would create a new VM. At which point I realized it was due to switching machines. I've always had my files in Dropbox to be honest.\nWith every halt it removes the id file within the .vagrant folder. Might be worth checking the xml files in the user path to see if Virtualbox cleaned them up.  Also it might help to run the command vboxmanage.exe vms list found within the Virtualbox path to see if the VMs are valid or not.\n. I can confirm this.

Glad to help out.\nThe MIT license is not a problem to me, go for it.\n. Don't quote me on this, but files are committed with line endings that they are configured for.  Then local installs, such as Windows, will convert them to the local default.  Unless you either set the Git config to force all projects to Windows/Unix or set the gitattribute to say you shouldn't touch the line endings.  In the situation for VVV it seems best to use Unix for all since folders get shared.\nYou can test my fork that simply sets the line endings to Unix to test.  I just happened to be merging the upstream today.\nI agree with you Jeremy, I can only test against Windows and I do think there might be something unforeseen.\n. @Musiphilos On windows you need to check to make sure all your files have proper Unix line endings\nSee the PR at https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/367\nAlso https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/419\n. @Musiphilos Jeremy's response was correct.

Here's my starter for 10, I think the minimum needed is a folder structure for a folder under /srv/www, with:\ndocroot/\nscripts/init-site.sh\ndata/hosts.dat\n- docroot/ is a directory which contains the document root, natch\n- scripts/ is a directory expected to contain scripts, we only interested in the init-site.sh\n- scripts/init-site.sh is a shell script which does whatever is needed to set the site up, load DBs, clone in Git repos or SVN checkouts, etc, etc. The contents of this script are entirely up to your dev team's approach.\n- data/hosts.dat (optional) contains additions to the host /etc/hosts file, or equivalent. It will need to be accessed by the Vagrantfile so it can be fed into the hostsupdater and by the provisioning script, so the hosts can be added to the Vagrant /etc/hosts file.\nI think that's the bare minimum we need to let a thousand flowers bloom. What do others think?\n. > So the data/hosts.dat file corresponds to the config/vvv-domains file in my PR\u2026\nYep. Note that I'm using comma separated, I'm not wedded to it and arguably a format which put the hosts on different lines or space separated might be more human readable.\n\n\u2026and then scripts/init-site.sh partially corresponds with database/vvv-init.sql.

On the one hand, it's not part of what I see as the bare minimum, but on the other hand, it'd be easy for most site setups to just know DB dumps of a particular filename, e.g. data/vvv-site.sql or similar, would just get loaded automatically.

If this idea, or similar, is accepted, I think it might be handy to have a utility script which gets all the domains from a site and populates the hosts.dat or equivalent.

These won't currently get picked up upon the initial provision because auto-site-setup.sh gets invoked after provision.sh, and after the vvv-hosts files are looked for. So shouldn't the contents of auto-site-setup.sh be moved inline to right before then?\nI originally put the auto-site-setup.sh as a separate file to accomodate it being moved between different Vagrant projects, but if this is constraining VVV then I have no objection to it moving inline in provision.sh. In fact I encourage it. :)\n. This can (should?) be added as a site using the auto site setup process, and IMO it's not needed as part of the core VVV setup.\n. While we're on show and tell :) here's my skeleton for an auto-site setup for VVV: https://github.com/cftp/vvv-init\n. > I didn't realize I was still running 4.2.x.

This looks great at first glance, thanks! Going through it now.\n. You're quick!\n. I've tested, and this works for me.\nMy only reservation is: does this go far enough, or should we move these sites into a separate repo? I'd like to share them in to my Apache branch, which would then mean adding a vvv-apache.conf and cloning the repo into both during provisioning. What do you think, @jeremyfelt ?\n. 1. IMO Yes we do, otherwise it's source which happens to be openly visible, not Free Open Source Software.\n2. I tend to go GPL v2 for everything myself, but IANAL (or anything but an amateur software licensing spectator)\n3. As far as I can see (insert usual caveats here) we don't have anything which forces us to be GPL. I would argue that the WordPress config bits @aaronjorbin refers to are not something VVV is integrating with, therefore not something which \"infects\" VVV \u2026 but I'm going to back down on this argument quite quickly in a heavy software licensing discussion.\nOverall, from me, +1 for GPL and I'm happy to retrospectively contribute any code under that licence.\n.

Ah, my colleague was behind with his Vagrant (latest version at time of writing 1.6.3, he was on 1.3.5). This seems to have sorted things out.\n. Here's how we currently handle these issues in CFTP's VVV development environment provisioner:\nSSH Connection\nFor this we use a robot user which has been added, with keys, to the various services we need, e.g. GitHub. This user is only ever added with read permissions, because we distribute the private SSH key with all our development environments (which are private repos, so the key is not made publicly available on the open web, but is in many people's hands). We then use ssh-agent to load these keys and execute any commands necessary, for example:\nbash\nssh-agent bash -c \"ssh-add ssh/cftp_deploy_id_rsa; git clone $REPO_SSH_URL htdocs;\"\nSSH Fingerprints\nI wrestled with the SSH fingerprint recognition issue for ages. Currently we add pre-generated signatures for GitHub and GitLab in our vvv-init.sh with this code:\nbash\nmkdir -p /root/.ssh\ntouch /root/.ssh/known_hosts\nIFS=$'\\n'\nfor KNOWN_HOST in $(cat \"ssh/known_hosts\"); do\n    if ! grep -Fxq \"$KNOWN_HOST\" /root/.ssh/known_hosts; then\n        echo \"Adding host to SSH known_hosts for user 'root': $KNOWN_HOST\"\n        echo $KNOWN_HOST >> /root/.ssh/known_hosts\n    fi\ndone\nI found a how-to on generating SSH fingerprints with ssh-keyscan, and use it to generate fingerprints which we store ready for that bash snippet above to add them to the Vagrant root user's SSH known_hosts.\nGeneral VVV\nI'd be somewhat OK to see common fingerprints added to known_hosts in that it lowers the barrier to entry for provisioning. I'm slightly concerned that it starts to stray outside my perception of the VVV remit, but I might just be overly concerned.\n. Is a CLA a Contributor License Agreement?\n. I like this idea, currently having the provisioner running as root is gradually storing up problems for us, e.g things like Composer (where the cache ends up unwritable by non-root users). \nFor reference, in my scripts I've been checking user like this:\nbash\nif [ `whoami` != root ]; then\n    echo \"Hello, Root!\"\nfi\n. The arguments put for updating to Trusty64 are in this issue: #334 \n. @keesiemeijer Is it just this rewrite rule which is causing issues? rewrite /files/(.+)$ /wp-includes/ms-files.php?file=$1 last;\nI'm not sure about removing those rules from the VVV install; I think we'd end up with a portion of VVV users who don't understand Nginx (and don't need to) getting quite confused. Seems that, unfortunately, @keesiemeijer's case is edgier than the legacy files URL case.\n. I'm on 4.3.8, and I have an unexplained mental note not to upgrade; but I can't recall why or to what higher version. Which is not helpful. \nEdit: I'm happy 4.3.8 is stable.\n. We have a known good page on our VVV tools wiki, here: https://github.com/cftp/vvv-init/wiki/Known-good We could do with adding a specific VVV commit.\n. Commented here, re checking network and running the update check if we have net: https://github.com/dwainm/varying-woo-vagrant/commit/6e3ebb0fc53258f5e0b246ec192dceb6dfaeb5d2\n. There's two parts to the VVV implementation:\n1. The Virtual Machine, in my case managed by VirtualBox and stored at ~/VirtualBox VMs/{name of vagrant directory}. This contains whatever the VM provider decides to include to make their system work.\n2. The VVV directory, which is where you put it. This contains your working WordPress codebase(s), databases (or database dumps), etc, which are shared into the VM by Vagrant.\nThe VM location will vary by VM provider, e.g. Parallels or VMWare will put them in different locations. The Vagrant location is chosen by you.\nYou may find you can move the VVV folders to your new machine, and just type vagrant up. Give it a go!\n. If we provide this, it's got to rotate the backups and ensure that not too many build up. It's potentially an invisible-to-non-technical-users folder which just increases in file size until one day their machine grinds to a halt. Even if we have it rotate the backups, I'd be concerned this might happen, it's also another thing to maintain within VVV.\nThis may be a little harsh, but I'm not sure that VVV should be providing this functionality. I think we output the database dumps onto the host machine filesystem, and the user of the host machine should have backups configured for the entire machine\u2026 never mind just the database. Many backup options are available, and we all sleep the better for using them!\n. From a brief Google, this seems to be a problem when your host machine, i.e. the real machine, you are setting up Vagrant on has an issue with the SSL connection to download the box that will be used. \nWhat kind of laptop or desktop are you using, and what is the operating system? Are you up to date with any updates for the operating system (security updates, etc)?\n. > Might also be nice to trigger something for\n\nauto setup to allow sites set up that way to deal with dumps/imports\nthemselves.\n\nOr even just to drop and load the database from a directory in that site, rather than the central database backups directory\u2026 then when you delete the site, it's properly gone.\n. How about a new VVV file called vvv-db-{database name}.mysql? If this file exists, the database gets backed up to it, if not it gets backed up as now. When a backup is made to a custom location, the script creates a link to the custom location in the standard DB backup directory. The script can then find broken links and delete the database represented by the broken link.\nFlow for the halt trigger:\n```\nBackups\nFor each database name\n    If there is a file anywhere in /srv/www called \"vvv-db-{database name}.sql (the custom DB backup file)\n        # Custom procedure\n        Dump the database into that file\n        Delete /srv/database/backups/{database name}.sql\n        Link to the custom DB backup file as /srv/database/backups/{database name}.sql\n    Else\n        # Standard procedure\n        Dump the database into /srv/database/backups/{database name}.sql\nCleanup\nFor each broken link file in /srv/database/backups/\n    Drop the database from MySQL\n    Delete the broken link\n```\nIf you wanted to take advantage of the local DB storage, you would need the vvv-db-{database name}.sql file(s) (more than one would be fine).\nStackoverflow answer on finding broken links.\n. An initial cut of allowing backups to custom locations is here: https://github.com/simonwheatley/varying-vagrant-vagrants/commit/c1c4db2f0e4421938fd19c480269b50afaea370e\nRemaining:\n- During the DB load (on vagrant up or halt), check for broken links and drop DBs where these are found\n.

Ideas welcome.\nI'm not sure the restoration after vagrant destroy works for non-core VVV DBs (i.e. not WP default, etc) anyway. Perhaps this is a known issue/feature, @jeremyfelt?\n. Yay!. The wordpress-develop install isn't really VVV specific, it's the \"new\" way Core organises itself for development. See the articles here:\n- http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/08/06/a-new-frontier-for-core-development/\n- http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/the-wordpress-codebase/\nThat said, the documentation in the core handbook isn't that extensive and I'm sure they'd welcome help expanding on it.

I did a little looking into warning: expected SRV RR, found RR type 1, and tentatively concluded it was a networking warning re DNS, see: https://github.com/siduction/git-latest-tag/blob/master/debian/diff/0011-srv-be-more-tolerant-of-broken-DNS-replies.diff#L69-L74\nSo I'm not sure this is WP-CLI specific.\n.

Dumb question: I think the move of vvv-nginx.conf into the custom-sites directory happens during provision.sh and Nginx is already restarted here, where are you seeing the Nginx file move happen when Nginx is not restarted afterwards?\n(Note: would be cool to abstract the auto-site-setup routine so we could run it without restarting or reprovisioning VVV, but that's for another day.)\n. Could this be related to the way your init scripts at X-Team work? I think @westonruter has talked about config driven environments (is that right?), and that you possibly write your Nginx configs as part of the init.\n. > Would it do any damage if we adjusted the second Nginx restart to happen after the whole provision process has finished ? ( and make it happen on reloads as well )\nSounds good to me.

Can you try checking out the latest tag (currently 1.4.0) and see if you still experience this issue?. @LoreleiAurora I can see now that the new provisioning system currently provisions sites from the vvv-config.yml and I am curious of two things:\n\nWill sites with vvv-init.sh files no longer provision automatically?\n~~Is there a specific reason we changed the -maxdepth from 5 to 4?~~\n\nEDIT: I can see the -maxdepth now searches from the path to site and not from the VVV root.. @LoreleiAurora yes, I saw that information.

We should not require users to edit a file (i.e. vvv-config.yml) which is not ignored by the repo.\nWhile I do agree with Jeremy's suggestion to also include a vvv-custom.yml, I would go a step further and say only load the vvv-custom.yml if it exists.

Just a quick update that I have forked VVV and will start documentation on the feature/doc-pages branch.. @grappler thanks for mentioning.

CC @jeremyfelt @LoreleiAurora . Leaving develop branch as default is ideal. I feel that it is up to a user to know which version she/he wants to run.\nDocumentation will definitely help alleviate any confusion.. It is extremely common that develop branch is always in flux and, in my opinion, it is up to the user to clone and use the reference (branch|tag) of her/his choice.\nIn addition, it is not always true that the master branch is the latest tagged release (although it is usually stable).\nI still lean towards leaving develop as the default branch.\nIf a user wants to clone a specific branch she/he can always append the --branch argument when cloning.. @LoreleiAurora I tend to agree with you but wanted to bring it up as this is a feature which I know many people tack advantage.. I do see benefits to both of these features and there are key things to keep in mind that developers want:\n\nAbility to host sites outside of the VVV directory (introduced in VVV 2.0) and\neasily SSH into the corresponding VVV directory (good)\neasily pass commands to the corresponding VVV directory without leaving current session (better)\n\n@westonruter I can see your addition and script does the latter, but does it account for custom site locations defined in vvv-custom.yml using vm_dir/local_dir?. @tomjn this is a good feature, but does it allow for passing commands to the corresponding site without leaving the session?\nAlso, see my comment on Weston's PR..

MariaDB is probably going to win the popularity contest, but the \"best\" route I guess depends on the goal of the project.\nWhile I'm MariaDB is most popular among this crowd, I don't see it becoming \"mainstream\" in the sense that hosts will use MySQL vanilla.\nper: https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\n10.0/10.1 = 3%\n5.6 = 19.5%\n5.7 = 0.8%\n5.6 userbase will likely end up on 5.7 in the future, whenever major web hosts upgrade.\nSo, if the goal is emulate production (though we have php7 so we're already away from most prod environments) then 5.6 or 5.7 would probably be the better way to go. If we want to go with what (some may say, but vs 5.7 not sure if it's totally the same story) may be more performant. I haven't looked at what is more performant than the others, 5.7 vs older versions I believe is more performant in MySQL itself... but vs MariaDB not sure.\nBit of a rambling mess but basically it comes down to do you want to go with what is used most often, or something else.\n. Sandbox would be a good solution. Default IMO would be better suited as vanilla MySQL, pick your version poison either 5.6 due to 20% usage, or 5.7 to be on latest.

Last I heard (it was a few years ago) most web servers were sticking with 32bit because it was just as fast and wasted far less memory.   That certainly could have changed in the last few years, but I wouldn't assume going to 64bit offers any benefit and may have some negatives. \n. Sorry to ask a simple question here, but does using xip.io urls break offline usage?  I thought it did, but I could certainly be wrong and haven't actually tried...\n. Reviewing the merge and other tickets I think I misunderstood.  I thought vvv was moving to use xip.io URLs for resolution as the primary url for accessing sites, not simply adding additional wildcard rules to allow for xip.io URLS as another option for access sites.

I've updated it with that change. :)\n. Currently, PHPUnit, Mockery, and Hamcrest. Another one that I put on all my systems is Boris. We could consider also installing WP CLI globally this way.\nIn my opinion, something would be considered global if it's primarily used through means of an executable binary or as a library for use in that context.\nThe setup part would be a matter of \nsudo composer global config bin-dir /usr/local/bin\nFrom there, to globally install PHPUnit, Mockery, and Boris, one would run\nsudo composer global require --no-update phpunit/phpunit:3.7.*\nsudo composer global require --no-update mockery/mockery:1.8.*\nsudo composer global require --no-update d11wtq/boris:v1.0.2\nsudo composer global update\n. The way the global command works is by creating a composer manifest in COMPOSER_HOME (by default, '$HOME/.composer/'). When executing the global command you just add normal commands after it. Composer changes directories to the home directory and then executes the command in the context of that \"package\".\n. The config command tells composer to symlink the binaries to /usr/local/bin so that they're on the default path. It might have to come after the first --no-update require command so that there's a valid composer.json file there. I'll investigate...\n. The latest commit gets the binaries installed in the correct location and added to the global path.\n. I'd also suggest removing the Hamcrest installation section as well (currently lines 212-236). Hamcrest is a development library for Mockery's unit test suite and is neither needed nor useful on its own like that.\n. Big +1 for the wrapper command.\nRegarding the svn repo, it's already included as part of the checkout of http://develop.svn.wordpress.org in /srv/www/wordpress-develop/tools/i18n.\nRegarding sh: 1: msguniq: not found, it's an error resulting from the gettext package not being correctly installed. The tools can't find the msguniq binary, so the shell is throwing that error. Try running sudo apt-get install gettext and see if that fixes the issue. My install already has the package, so it might be an outdated instance of the vagrant. Perhaps try running vagrant destroy; vagrant up and see if it works without needing to install gettext, perhpas? I'll try it too and see if it's installed after a clean up.\n. So, after a clean vagrant destroy; vagrant up, which msguniq couldn't find the binary. In order to get that added, we should add gettext to the list of packages to install with apt-get.\n. ROFL\n.

I'm fine with either MIT only or dual licensed as GPLv2+/MIT.\n. I'm fine with either MIT only or dual licensed as GPLv2+/MIT.\n. On top of that, we also cleaned up how it behaves. The old plugin sometimes wouldn't add/remove hosts based on a variety of factors including what state the machine was transitioning into, or configuration options that prevented it from running on suspend by default. The new behavior is:\n1. If the machine is transitioning into a \"not reachable\" state (i.e. halt, suspend, destroy), remove the hosts.\n2. If it's transitioning into a \"reachable\" state (i.e. up, resume), add the hosts.\n3. If it's doing a reload, wait for boot then remove the hosts and re-add them.\nBasically, if the vm isn't up and running, the hosts should not be in your host file.\n. @westonruter It's only private through the default network interface. Anybody can add public interfaces in the Customfile, and some providers don't allow any control over network restrictions. This would require some extra work to get it to play nicely with hyperv. Vagrant doesn't manage hyperv networking at all, so a private network can never be assumed, nor can the host's address. For example, my hyperv boxes get a DHCP lease directly from my router. This means the host machine could be connecting from any address in the router's range of addresses that it leases.\n. @westonruter It's only private through the default network interface.

If starting from scratch via destroy, there is no problem at all.\n@GaryJones I'm feeling stumped, hence the no reply. :) I'm almost wondering if there's some kind of permissions issue with your Windows 7 setup.

I'm not a server guru so it's fairly hackish, however for those searching for something like this feel free to use (or contribute to).

I run into that every now and then too.. reprovision (vagrant provision) or do vagrant halt and vagrant up --provision and that should fix it.\n. I use tower too, but what I usually do is clone in my repo manually via command line and then just open it up in tower.  That works around the tower restrictions very handily.\n. personally, while its a cool idea,  I'm in favor of leaving out backups from core vvv.  I think that's the kind of thing that individual users should take care of themselves rather than vvv including it.  I have my vagrant folder on my dropbox drive and dropbox has built-in versioning.  Having multiple backups is overkill and just adds extra space.\n. Congratulations on joining the world of VVV @machulnyy.  For future reference, since it appears you're new to doing things command line in the terminal, you'll want to search for some documentation on the usage of the sudo command.  Basically you use this to execute other commands with administrative permissions on your machine as without that you are just executing the command with whatever permissions your current user has.  On MacOSx, most low level system utility commands need to be executed with the sudo command (which is why you encountered the error you did).\nYou'll find that much of what you do with VVV involves working in the command line at one point or another so its a great opportunity for you to learn more about working in the Terminal.\n. were you running the composer command in the vagrant box or your local machine?. that's why you are getting the error then because on your local machine you don't have the right required version of PHP.  This isn't a vagrant issue.. From my perspective, the error in the output seems pretty clear:\n==> default: nginx: [emerg] open() \"/srv/www/vds/log/error.log\" failed (2: No su\nch file or directory)\nEither:\n\non your host machine you don't have a log folder in the directory for the site (i.e. {host_path}/www/vds/log or \nmapping the host www folder to srv/www is failing.\n\nJust thought I'd chime in because when I've seen this error myself its nearly always been solved by creating a log directory in my website folder on the local host machine and then doing a reprovision.\nAlternatively, you can ssh into vagrant and create the log folder directly then sudo nginx reload if you want. . Yes VVV v1 did not have per site logs setup in the default nginx rules.  So if you copied the default VVV2 configuration as is in the docs, those require a log folder in your www/{site} folder.  So any migrated existing sites would need that created.. ",

Just upgraded to Vagrant 1.3.1 and the issue resolved itself. Props @jeremyfelt \n. I'm not actually sure that git-svn would be the desired approach. If WordPress Core adds a develop.git which mirrors develop.svn, both of which would seem to be equivalent in terms of canonicity. I remember Nacin mentioned the goal of core contributions being VCS agnostic, and right now the develop.svn is not canonical either, since it goes through a build process and gets committed to the old SVN repo, right?\nIn this case, when develop.git actually becomes a reality, I'll presume that patches will be acceptable either as Git diffs or as SVN diffs. We could either then switch src.wordpress-develop.dev to use Git entirely, or we could add a src-svn.wordpress-develop.dev alongside a src-git.wordpress-develop.dev.\n. >  An option could then be allowed for that replaced the default SVN for a site with Git.\nI know, how about we introduce a flags system to do stuff like this! :wink: \n. THE DAY DAY HAS COME! http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/01/15/git-mirrors-for-wordpress/\nNow the question remains: do we swap out SVN for Git on src.wordpress-develop.dev?\n. As in #91? :smile: \n. Actually, thinking about this some more, I think that keeping SVN as the default may be the best because it is much faster to checkout an SVN working copy than it is to clone a Git repo, especially one the size of the WordPress codebase.\nSo how about this for an alternative approach:\n1. We include a script with VVV which converts the src.wordpress-develop.dev SVN checkout into a Git clone\n2. We update the provisioning script to see if the src.wordpress-develop.dev is a Git repo, and does a git pull --rebase, but then otherwise does the default svn up\n. Even with destroy, it wouldn't blow away a SVN-to-Git converted WordPress develop repo, since it is inside of a synced folder. So that first-time conversion would persist until you deleted the wordpress-develop directory entirely.\n. Thanks to SVN 1.7 and centralized metadata storage, this was made so easy! I shudder to think of SVN 1.6 and having to find and remove all nested .svn directories for that repo. With 1.7 there is only one just like in Git.\n. So the data/hosts.dat file corresponds to the config/vvv-domains file in my PR, and then scripts/init-site.sh partially corresponds with database/vvv-init.sql. I do like that you're just referencing a Bash script which can then invoke any site-specific setup routines, like creating the DB and populating the DB with test content.\nI think that your hosts.dat and init-site.sh should explicitly include vvv in their filenames, because they are irrelevant to other environments\u2014so maybe vvv-hosts.dat and vvv-init-site.sh? Also, should there be a filename convention for a test DB dump included in a project? Or should that just be left up to vvv-init-site.sh to know?\n. > That's the plan, I thought if we could generalise out from specific layouts we'd get more people behind the idea.\nDo we need to mandate a layout? Can't we just look for vvv-init-site.sh inside of /src/www and just run it where it lies? Same goes for vvv-hosts.dat, it can be located anywhere.\nOh, what about the Nginx config for the site? In #100 it is looking for a vvv-nginx.conf, and then symlinking to it.\n. > That's the plan, I thought if we could generalise out from specific layouts we'd get more people behind the idea.\nDo we need to mandate a layout?

Querying the vvv-hosts from the DB itself! That's a great idea. I wonder, though, if it would always give us the results we need. For example we have lots of sites developed which utilize a m subdomain alias, each site on a multisite network. Upon sunrise we check to see if HTTP_HOST starts with m. and then remove it, while defining a constant to indicate IS_MOBILE_SITE, since the HTTP_HOST cannot be used afterward to check. Then WordPress sees the HTTP_HOST for a site listed among the wp_blogs and then routes to it as expected.\nAnyway, all of this to say that there would be no way to programatically know that the vvv-hosts needs to include m subdomain aliases. So maybe we could do the auto querying of domains, but then still check to see if there are vvv-hosts.dat files and append those to the list?\n. Oh! Querying the vvv-hosts from the DB itself!

From there you could do:\nbash\n../phpcs/scripts/phpcs --standard=WordPress docroot/index.php\nBut you'll want to add phpcs to your path to make it easier to access.\nFor more sophisticated usage, you can use a pre-commit hook, for example:\nhttps://github.com/x-team/wp-plugin-dev-lib/blob/master/pre-commit\n. I just had the issue described above:\n\n\n\nI was able to resolve it with this from @jeremyfelt:\n\nTry removing the .vagrant directory that was likely created by previous attempts. It may be that something is cached there and unhappy.\n. You may use vassh to easily run commands in the Vagrant environment from\nyour host terminal, avoiding the need to vagrant ssh:\nhttps://github.com/x-team/vassh\n. @simonwheatley Likewise, what if the vvv-init.sh script dynamically generate vvv-hosts files? These won't currently get picked up upon the initial provision because auto-site-setup.sh gets invoked after provision.sh, and after the vvv-hosts files are looked for. So shouldn't the contents of auto-site-setup.sh be moved inline to right before then?\n. I also have resurrected the initial init-site script from my original auto-site-setup work and have added it another repo: https://github.com/x-team/config-driven-wp/blob/init-script/init-site.sh\n\nIt uses the conventional X-Team project layout, including committing of WordPress source files to the repo.\nA flag for the script could be added which would make it initialize a multisite, or you can wp core multisite-convert as well.\n. Not yet. That's what https://github.com/x-team/wp-cli-ssh/issues/10 is for.\nBy the way, the key convenience of WP-CLI SSH is adding this:\nbash\nalias wpv=\"wp ssh --host=vagrant\"\nWhich then allows you to just do any of:\nbash\nwpv plugin status\nwpv db export\nwpv shell\n. Not lately :smile: \n. Not lately :smile: \n. Yesterday I had a problem whereby inside of the VM, I was not able to curl $(wp option get siteurl). I looked at the hosts file inside of the VM, and it was empty except for the default entries.  Upon a reboot, they appeared. I am not sure why they went away.\n. @jeremyfelt yeah, that's likely the cause. I was a bit out of date.\n. upgrade is an alias: https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/blob/95d97b4c729a10518151ee6e60869b949d838603/php/commands/core.php#L649-L651\n. I think you need to use a service like http://xip.io/\nThis is because you can't modify the hosts file on your mobile device.\n. @jeremyfelt in addition to documentation, one change we could make is to add xip.io subdomain aliases for the sites bundled with VVV. For example:\npatch\n-     server_name  local.wordpress.dev *.local.wordpress.dev;\n+     server_name  local.wordpress.dev *.local.wordpress.dev *.local.wordpress.dev.*.xip.io;\nThis would also need to be done for all domains fed into vagrant-hostsupdater, for each host adding one with .*.xip.io appended.\n. VVV: \u201cMagic by default.\u201d\n. :heart_eyes: WOW. Integrating ngrok/localtunnel with Vagrant? Yes please.\nHowever, it doesn't seem that Vagrant Share allows you to specify the share name, does it? By default it picks randomized obscure host names, but this will be obviously problematic for Nginx since it has to have a stable sever_name.\n. @jeremyfelt it would be great if there were some automated code quality scripts that could be added to a pre-commit hook and also to a .travis.yml. Maybe there is some Lint tool that checks for best practices in Bash scripting as you manually applied previously? \nThe CONTRIBUTING.md could include instructions for how to set up the pre-commit hook and to run these tests before the pull request even gets opened.\n. For example: https://github.com/x-team/wp-widget-customizer/blob/master/contributing.md\n. @jeremyfelt How have you included a resolv.conf to provide Google DNS? Looking at /etc/resolv.conf after vagrant up seems to indicate that this wouldn't work:\n```\nDynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)\nDO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN\nnameserver 10.0.2.3\nsearch hsd1.or.comcast.net\n``\n. Can you share the output of yourvagrant up --provision?\n. Can you share the output of yourvagrant up --provision?\n. See also #263 \n. That seems dangerous to me; makes me feel uneasy. What if you forked (cloned) the VVV repo into aVVV-devrepo also under the Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants org, and then openly grant write access to that fork for contributions? I guess GitHub doesn't allow you to create a fork or a repo within an organization, but you could handle the syncing between the two repos outside of GitHub, by pulling commits fromvvv-dev/masterontovvv/master`.\n. Yeah, I like that.\nAnother idea, though this would require some coding to get set up, but there could be some facility for creating feature branches (maybe every issue gets a feature branch automatically created, or automatically created if a createbranch comment is added to the issue), and then pull requests issued against these feature branches could be auto-merged. This would keep master free from accidental commits.\n. @jeremyfelt yeah, if would be much less damaging on a feature branch if a merge commit was added (as opposed to the rebase), as you could relatively easily reset the feature branch head to the previous commit, but most importantly you could still do fast-forward pushes. Still, I think if you're not on master you wouldn't want additional commits to be made automatically on top of your feature branch. \n. > It would be really cool if we could detect that a merge was made and notify somehow. That's probably for a different day.\nYeah, seems a bit difficult to automate this check.\n. Doesn't work in what way? On my command line, I do:\nsh\n$ vagrant ssh -c xdebug_on\n * Restarting PHP5 FastCGI Process Manager php5-fpm     [ OK ]\nConnection to 127.0.0.1 closed.\nSo it works fine. Are you trying to invoke this inside of your vvv-init.sh script? This won't work as-is, because it runs inside of Vagrant and so you'd call xdebug_on directly. And you may need to use the full path: /home/vagrant/bin/xdebug_on\nAlternatively, you could add this to a provision-post.sh file.\n. For my open source projects, I'm a fan of dual licensing, following the model of jQuery, which is dual-licensed GPL/MIT (or at least it used to be). Forkers can choose whichever license fits their use case.\n. I approve whichever open license is picked.\n. Try this: https://github.com/TheLastCicada/varying-vagrant-vagrants/compare/varnish\n. Yeah, I like this. My only concern is that switching users could break any SSH connections that WP-CLI could be attempting. The SSH agent gets forward to the provisioner as the root user, but when switching users, the agent is not by default persisting to switched user. I've proposed in #360 a change to the provisioner to explicitly opt-in to SSH agent sharing when switching users.\n. @francescolaffi ah, nice. I wasn't familiar with the -E flag. :+1: It's all good for me.\n. Or I can just update all of my scripts to remove cd \"$(dirname $0)\" since it is actually redundant.\n. OK, dependent PRs on PHP_CodeSniffer and WordPress-Coding-Standards have been merged.\n. Yep!\n. I will check when the issue resurfaces.\n. OK, it has happened again. Here's what memcached-admin says:\n\n. I had problems with memory running over as well. I fixed it by dropping in a Customfile:\nruby\nconfig.vm.provider :virtualbox do |v|\n  v.customize [\"modifyvm\", :id, \"--memory\", 1024]\nend\n. I definitely would encourage the WordPress Coding Standards repo to be distributed as a git clone as well to facilitate contributing.\n. @jeremyfelt in my testing, I found that running the entire test suite inside vagrant took around 3 minutes, whereas running the test suite completely from host machine took 2.5 minutes. Does this difference in performance align with what you've seen?\n. I just published a writeup comparing running PHPUnit entirely in the VM, PHP on host but DB in VM, and then entirely on host without VM at all: https://make.xwp.co/2016/03/10/running-phpunit-tests-outside-vvv/\n. @jeremyfelt shall I merge? :smile: \n. I would say it is not really necessary to have it installed by default as a Git clone. It is rare that I need to change out the PHPCS version when developing for WPCS.\n. Chassis has implemented this as well: https://github.com/Chassis/vip-classic. Chassis has implemented this as well: https://github.com/Chassis/vip-classic. And on top of this I present vvv-ssh, a next generation of vassh. I'd love to include this in VVV if it makes sense.. @tomjn Thanks for the review.\n\nThe changes in config/bash_login appear to be what do the critical part here, but could that not just be changed to something that appends to .bash_profile in the home directory? At which point it'd be a simple command to append to that file in the utilities provision.sh\n\nThose are the critical changes, yes. The reason why it cannot just be appended to .bash_profile is that it is not read when connecting to Vagrant in non-TTY mode (e.g. vagrant ssh -c \"wp post list\"). Additionally, the logic can't be appended to /home/vagrant/.bashrc, a pre-existing script in the VM because at the top it short-circuits with:\n```sh\nIf not running interactively, don't do anything\ncase $- in\n    i) ;;\n      *) return;;\nesac\n```\nSo that's why I'm prepending to .bashrc:\nsh\nif [ -e ~/.bash_login ]; then . ~/.bash_login; fi\nWhen a .bashrc is present, the ~/.bash_login file is not read. I figured it would be better to put the logic into a separate file for maintainability rather than putting all of it into the .bashrc.\nI'll have to look at the hooks to see if they would work.. Per https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1314#issuecomment-338503530 I think this should be still considered as it is faster in that the doesn't have the overhead of vagrant ssh.. There is also no dependency on Vagrant triggers with this approach.. I propose the triggers from your PR be combined with the configs in mine so that we can get the initial CWD working for both TTY and non-TTY modes: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1314#issuecomment-338521102. @kopepasah good point. You're right, vvv-ssh doesn't account for custom site locations like the Vagrantfile change in #1314. So that is a deficiency in vvv-ssh. However, the changes proposed specifically in this PR wouldn't need anything else, right?. @tomjn one downside of this is that it still has the overhead of vagrant ssh. With #1311 you can do plain ssh with previous configuration provided by vagrant ssh-config, and caching that config speeds up connections drastically. So I think I still prefer my approach.\nFor more on why vagrant ssh is slow, see https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/4214#issuecomment-49551965. @tomjn yes, and then why not support both? In order to set up their own script, it needs that .bashrcmodification in #1311 in order to support that option. The two PRs can just use the same name for the .vvv_temp_ssh_cwd file. If we stick this into /config/custom/ then we won't need to .gitignore it.. I mean, as far as I know, in order to avoid having to avoid having to do two SSH connections in order to set the CWD for a TTY connection (see approach in vasshin), the extension in #1311 to .bashrc is needed.. @tomjn Also, I see that there is a problem with the PR here in that it doesn't work in non-TTY mode. If you try passing a command to run via vagrant ssh it doesn't work here:\nbash\n$ pwd; vagrant ssh -c \"pwd\"\n/Users/westonruter/Projects/vvv/www/wordpress-develop/public_html\n/home/vagrant\nConnection to 127.0.0.1 closed.\nWhereas compare with #1311 and my forwarding script:\nbash\n$ pwd; vvv-ssh pwd\n/Users/westonruter/Projects/vvv/www/wordpress-develop/public_html\n/srv/www/wordpress-develop/public_html\nNotice the working directory is set because the bash_login is being loaded in non-TTY mode.\nSo yours works great for TTY mode, but it doesn't work for non-TTY mode.\nSo what I propose is that we include support for the config files in #1311 but then also include the triggers from yours, so then we can have the best of both.. @tomjn Correction on my https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1314#issuecomment-338521102:\nWith your patch I am able to get the the CWD set when I call vagrant ssh with a command:\nsh\n$ pwd; vagrant ssh -c \"pwd\"\n/Users/westonruter/Projects/vvv/www/wordpress-develop/public_html/src\n/srv/www/wordpress-develop/public_html/src\nConnection to 127.0.0.1 closed.\nHowever, the same is not working when I do ssh with the config exported from vagrant ssh:\nsh\n$ pwd; ssh -F ssh-config default pwd\n/Users/westonruter/Projects/vvv/www/wordpress-develop/public_html/src\n/home/vagrant\nFor some reason when connecting directly via ssh the .bash_profile is not read, whereas it is read when vagrant ssh is called.. Ref: https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C18723MQ8/p1510727681000193\nRunning grunt phpunit:ajax fails with PHPUnit 5.x. @simonwheatley does the Ruby * glob here traverse into multiple directories? I'm sure that devs are going to want to often group sites into directories, by client name for example. So they could have:\n/srv/www/example.com\n/srv/www/acme-client/foo.example.net/\n/srv/www/acme-client/bar.example.info/\n/srv/www/emca-client/oof.example.net/\n/srv/www/emca-client/rab.example.info/\nSo this would require that the globber traverse down additional directories.\n. Also, I don't think we need to mandate that the hosts.dat file exist in any particular directory. Could we just do this? \nDir.glob('www/**/vvv-hosts.dat').each do |path|\n. @simonwheatley :heart: \n. @simonwheatley my assumption is that the vvv-hosts.dat file would reside within each project's repo, so:\n/src/www/example.com/config/vvv-hosts.dat\nIt does seem find will interpret * to glob multiple directories in a hierarchy :+1: \n. I've written no Ruby, so you're way ahead of me :smile: \nI wonder if there is a way to indicate a maxdepth for globbing in Ruby? It will get very slow if there are lots of sites in /src/www the shared folders, but your idea to use find -maxdepth was a great one to speed that up. Worst case, instead of Dir.glob we can just invoke the shell there to get the list?\n. @francescolaffi curious as to why this wouldn't be checking if $USER == 'root'? I haven't used $EUID before, so perhaps I'm just ignorant. I suppose the root user always has a $EUID of 0?\n. @francescolaffi why was bash replaced with source? By using source, it is now breaking any existing vvv-init.sh scripts which may do cd \"$(dirname $0)\"\n. Yeah, that makes sense. As noted in #373, I think it'll just need to be VVV 1.2 release note for vvv-init.sh scripts to stop referencing $0.\n. @simonwheatley this needs to be relative to the root of the PHPCS repo, as otherwise PHPCS will not be able to find the standards when invoked outside of Vagrant. So it should be:\nbash\nphpcs --config-set installed_paths CodeSniffer/Standards/WordPress/\nSee https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/pull/217\n. Sorry, it seems it has to start with an explicit .. Here's what I have:\nphpcs --config-show installed_paths\nArray\n(\n    [installed_paths] => ./CodeSniffer/Standards/WordPress/\n)\n. This absolute path will break PHPCS when invoked from outside of Vagrant. This is why a relative path is used currently.\n. This has to be run inside of Vagrant, so that's something that could be mentioned. Alternatively, this could mention:\nbash\nvagrant ssh -c /srv/config/homebin/develop_git\n. ",

That can be helpful in longer ssh sessions.\n. would this allow me to open a cmd in the mapped folder on my host machine and use wp to be applied to the vm code?\nIf so :+1: :+1: :+1: \n. would this allow me to open a cmd in the mapped folder on my host machine and use wp to be applied to the vm code?\nIf so :+1: :+1: :+1: \n. I think VVV should stay focused on WordPress. On modern machines you can easily run multiple VMs so it might be best use VVV for WP and different specialized Vagrants for other environments\n. Running other PHP stuff on VVV is not the problem like you already stated but VVV is more than just another PHP Vagrant box.\nYou can create auto setup site scripts for all the other stuff but adding equivalents to the tools for other platforms would be too far out of scope.\n. Ok. Happy to be of help.\nYour autoconfig is nice. What else would you like to add? \nOr would you like to move it to the VVV org? To make it more visible? We could also add a page to the wiki.\n. I havent played with this but if I understand it right you would need to use the ip of your vagrant host (the machine running virtualbox) from a second machine. That should forward the request to the vm.\n.

Let's keep this open for others to find and possibly help.\nI don't have the time (and the need) to look into this myself.\n. You need to extract the CA cert from your vagrant.\nSince I have no idea about how it it with ubuntu I can not point you to the right location. Maybe someone else can help\n. Did you solve this?\nWhy do you need this? Self-signed certs should present this way.\n. Did you solve this?\nWhy do you need this? Self-signed certs should present this way.\n. self-signed certs are red because there is no authority confirming its validity.\nI just had another look. The standard cert installed by nginx isn't even signed the common way by a CA cert. Since I am no SSL expert my only advice would be to create a CA cert and with that a self-signed cert for the domain you need. then you can import the public part of the CA cert into the windows certificate store.\nIt is not the easiest task.\nAgain, why do you need to get a \"green\" indicator for the cert? There is no downside of a red indicator if you run you vagrant locally.\n. you can use the web console of your browser to see if elements are loaded via http or https\n. sounds like an issue with npm. It sometimes has hick-ups.\nMaybe try again? Remove www/wordpress-develop and run vagrant provision\n. Your error is showing because the grunt build process fails.\nThis means build.wordpress does not get build and thereby is not accessible.\nI will try to test a build myself as soon as I got time\n. the grunt process is not running for either\n. @jeremyfelt CLOSE\n. @jeremyfelt CLOSE\n. Maybe there is a constant for this but I will simply use the mapped vagrant folder /vagrant/provision\n. anyone else tested this?\nIt is pretty nice to have when working on VVV itself. The checkouts via composer is very slow once you reach the anonymous github api limit.\n. I am totally with you. Was thinking the same after I sent the pr.\nWill revert WP-cli and cs\n. I am totally with you. Was thinking the same after I sent the pr.\nWill revert WP-cli and cs\n. at the current state the aliases work but no php is processed.\nAnyone have an idea how to fix the aliased folders to process the .php files?\n. Any idea how to get php working for the provisioned tools?\n. can someone PLEASE fix the vhost aliases?\nI am about to abandon VVV because nginx is just fucking stupig (or I am).\n. Currently the aliases work for .php files and for these only\n. @jeremyfelt please add in progress label\n. Will close this for now.\nThe destination branch is wrong + I need to revisit this topic when I got some free time again.\n. Will close this for now.\nThe destination branch is wrong + I need to revisit this topic when I got some free time again.\n. I would vote for .localhost since it would make the most sense to me.\n.local can not be used because it would clash with directory  and other services.\nWe need to reach some kind of consensus here and can add the tld to the configs of the sites while keeping the current domain endings for the time being.\n. What first comes to mind: Do NOT use a second VVV if you go with a second vm. This will lead to a multitude of problems.\nSecond: Virtualbox VMs are not really the fastest. So a second box might prevent performance issues\n. @joelworsham do you mean the first vagrant up? Yes, that is super slow. Or just a vagrant provision to add an additional site?\n. @EHLOVader will send a PR for this or should I ? \n. .htaccess files are not supported. VVV runs nginx which does not get its rules from .htaccess files.\nHave a look at these configs: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/blob/develop/config/nginx-config/nginx-wp-common.conf\nYou need to import that file like here: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/blob/develop/config/nginx-config/sites/default.conf#L80\n. ### Virtualization extension WARNING in readme\nWe should add a big warning to check the virtualization extension in the BIOS.\nI would send a PR but I am not sure where to put it in the README.md.\n. @jrb this solution doesn't work correctly.\nhave a look at #633\n. @jrb this solution doesn't work correctly.\nhave a look at #633\n.

I am not sure what you want to achieve.\nlaunch icon?\nVVV is not LAMP since it uses nginx and not Apache.\n. Maybe there is an issue with a nginx config file.

The provisioning is pretty long at the moment and it sometimes gets screwed up but I am always working on improving that\n. moved to #605\n. moved to #605\n. do a mysqld -help.\nMaybe we should go with:\nslow_query_log = 1\nslow_query_log_file = /srv/log/mysql_slow.log\nlong_query_time = 10\nlog_queries_not_using_indexes = 1\nand we also (might) need to touch the log files and set permissions.\nAny idea how to get stuff logged? Simulating slow query and/or errors?\n. Let's go with\nslow_query_log      = 1\nslow_query_log_file = /srv/log/mysql_slow.log\nlong_query_time     = 2\nlog_queries_not_using_indexes = 1\nand\nsh\ntouch /srv/log/mysql_slow.log\ntouch /srv/log/mysql_error.log\n. I will have a look tomorrow.\nWas already wondering why sleep() did not show up in the log\n. There is no way to change ownership or permissions within a synced folder. SEE: http://jeremykendall.net/2013/08/09/vagrant-synced-folders-permissions/\nBut I still dont understand why mysql is not able to write to the log. Since the log/ folder has the permission 0777 it should work, right?\n. @EHLOVader Can you update the PR to\nmy.cnf\n```\nlog_error = /srv/log/mysql_error.log\n\nHere you can see queries with especially long duration\nslow_query_log      = 1\nslow_query_log_file = /srv/log/mysql_slow.log\nlong_query_time     = 2\nlog_queries_not_using_indexes = 1\n```\nfor a start. This is the \"current/new\" syntax for mysql >= 5.5\nhttps://github.com/EHLOVader/VVV/blob/mysql-logs/provision/provision.sh#L359\nsh\n    touch /srv/log/mysql_slow.log\n    touch /srv/log/mysql_error.log\nI tried adding the mysql user to the vagrant group which didn't have any effect. But I am still not convinced that select sleep(11); results in a slow query log entry.\n@jeremyfelt add a in-progress label, please\n. if this is a general problem we could add your fix to https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/blob/develop/config/homebin/xdebug_on\n. this is mapped to your local VVV folder under log/ but WP sites log their errors into wp-content/debug.log if WP_DEBUG is set.\n. WE should say >=1.6 or Vagrant 1.6.x or newer\n. @hubdotcom please add yourself to the Contributors list in README.md\n@jeremyfelt please merge\n. I am not sure if we \"can\"/want to go with 2 cores. Some machines might be too weak to support the VM and proper performance for the host\n. :+1: lets merge\n. lets remove the version here completely\n. @EHLOVader please edit your main comment and add Close #337 so it will close #337 automatically on merge\n. @EHLOVader please edit your main comment and add Close #337 so it will close #337 automatically on merge\n. :+1: for merge\n. :+1: for merge\n.

Good idea :+1: \nI think this shouldn't get a seperate page. Put it on the dashboard page.\n. why closed?\n. Is it possible that the plugin you are using to make this happen is not working as advertised?\n. No problem. Happy to help.\nVVV does as little as possible to WP in its after-install state.\n. ?\n. You do not need to use ssh here.\nThe script is running in the command line of the vvv  directly!\nJust use it without vagrant ssh\n. I am on the \"road\".\nYes, it is as if you are already logged in via ssh.\nDo not hesitate to ask anything. You might get help ;-)\n. @jeremyfelt we should look into the new github (pull request) templates to require devs to submit a changelog addition with the code for the feature\n. :+1: \n. @scarstens I am not sure if docker is anywhere near the scope of VVV but you should be able to run VVV with the current VB 5.x version. It does for me.\n. maybe we can add an if clause to the trigger here https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/blob/develop/Vagrantfile#L287-L306 for a custom file?\n. maybe we can add an if clause to the trigger here https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/blob/develop/Vagrantfile#L287-L306 for a custom file?\n. maybe there is a \"native\" vagrant command you can add to the Vagrantfile.

If you only want to create/test your theme you should usetrunkso you can see if you code runs smoothly on the latest and greatest.\n. did you runvagrant reload?\nSEE: https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/cli/reload.html\n.

For the first up which runs the complete provision this time sounds ok.\nAfter that everything should only take a few seconds.\n. Isn't this something we can only add to the readme as a recommendation?\nThe vagrant plugins are local and independent from Vvv or any other vagrant configuration \n. @Mte90 can you send us a PR for this? Please include an addtion to the contributors list (if you are not already on it) and an addtion to the changelog\n. I am not sure about OS X but on win Virtualbox 5.x is pretty bad. Maybe you could test using vb 4.x\n. How about using conditional logic to support both?\n. Like you said.if...else...endUse ghost if present but fallback to the hostsupdater. But we need this to not break the installs that only update.\n. There shouldn't be any thing blocking halting the van because of the switch to git. Something went wrong for you.\nEasiest way is tovagrant destroy` and set up VVV anew\n. Good to hear that. Its hard to debug issues like yours over the issue tracker - online.\n. How about releasing smaller updates in the future?\nMaybe 1.3.1-beta? When tagging these \"releases\" we can have a \"bleeding\" version that can easily be donwloaded as .zip archives\n. I like the idea of .editorconfig\nI am still hoping for support in Netbeans but a lot of other editors support it.\nQuestion: do we need different \"styles\" for different file types?\n:+1: \n.

Please do not forget the addition to the contributors list (if you are not already on it) and the entry to the changelog!\ngive me a hail to create a feature/prestissimo branch for testing\n. I provisioned the develop branch version and it worked on my system. Win10 + VB 5.0.14 + Vagrant 1.7.4\nHad some bad issues with Vitrualbox but nothing VVV specific. There must be another issue with your machine. Did you install all vagrant plugins? (reinstall them) Did you run your console in admin mode (no idea if this applies to OSX)\n. @eduwass nice to hear that.\nFor me most problems come from VB. But it is oracle oss and we all know that you can't expect much from that\n. Looks good. Thanks.\n. I would love to have php 7 as the default.\n. maybe we can start by going for xdebug 2.4.0 and Imagick 3.4.0 to make \"anything possible\"\n. Will Look into this this evening.\nDid all of you install and/or reinstall the vagran triggers plugin?\n.

I just do a git pull and after that a vagrant up -provision\n. @cnc137 I am sorry my typo cost you some time to debug\n. just try reinstalling the vagrant plugin and lets hope we can move on to ghost soon\n. @jeremyfelt I would like to blind merge this for testing\n. Although a lot of people use VVV to code and test their plugins/themes it is mainly for contributing to WP core.\n\"We\" need to look into setting up some kind of addon for VVV to provide the configs and tools you describe\n. Make sure you have NOT installed hyper-v\nReinstall the vagrant plugins\nTest a new provisioned vvv. Shouldn't take too much time but provisioning a vagrant on windows sometimes has hickups\n. We are working on making updates automatic.\nFor what you have done to work you need to delete the default/database-admin folder so the provision process \"installs\" phpmyadmin with your modified versuob\n. Keep an eye on this https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-utilities\n. Had issues with always going to sleep mode in the past, too.. Had issues with always going to sleep mode in the past, too.. This looks like there was a connection or uptime issue with the repo for the Linux packages.\nMight be intermittent. Trying later might help.. This looks like there was a connection or uptime issue with the repo for the Linux packages.\nMight be intermittent. Trying later might help.. Your vagrant-vbguest is not the newest.\nMaybe try there?. I tried this, too.\nBut I am using virtualbox and didn't really need this. I suspect that when you have (had?) virtualbox installed it causes issues for hyper-v.. @benlumia007 since most devs don't need the highest performance so virtualbox THE free option is the best choice to focus on.\nI meant virtualbox and hyper-v on one machine = problems (at least for me). You should create a \"new version\" for vvv 2.x.\nMaybe a vvv-2 branch?\nLet's have a look at fetching the package via the new config.\nThis way vvv 1.x users can use your stable version from the known location.. @thebrandonallen made the change to phpcs 2.x. squashed everything (not best practice, i know).\nWorks on my install. review would be nice.. for me the\n\nand The Main Folder\n\nmakes no sense at all. Would remove the part and reduce the headline to vvv-custom.yml. Are you even using VVV?. as a \"hotfix\" you could use Remote Desktop, Teamviewer or even a SSH/Powershell remote session to run the vagrant commands on the hosting pc (yours).. I am pretty sure that you won't get anything rendered with a failed provision.\nIf the Webserver is not working it won't be able to output a warning or error . I like it and I see what the purpose of the error is now.\nI thought you wanted to show the error on a broken provisioning of the \"server software\"\n. I like what you are doing but it seems too much. If I am an experienced user I dont want to see about half of that.\nI suggest putting everything below \"sites\" and \"tools\". Maybe you can use an anchor link to scroll down to the help stuff. Yes, for now the Github issues is the best (and maybe only) place to get help for VVV.\nWe try to help as much as we can.\nJust try to post detailed info about what is not working and what error messages you get.. @cagross I am not sure you can add tags. Just try to fill as many categories in the issue template. moving away from mailcatcher might be a good idea.\nPossible alternative\n- https://github.com/djfarrelly/MailDev\n\nhttps://github.com/mailhog/MailHog\n\nOthers?. I would choose the one with the most reliable install process. \"Anything\" is better than breaking installations constantly like mailcatcher.. +1. The current Windows Semi-Annual Update 1809. The rollout was canceled in october but I did a force install on my clean install.\nMaybe it is an issue there.\nI did clean installs of all kinds of vagrant versions. including removing .vagrant.d folder.\nI know that it is likely a vagrant issue but was hoping someone here might have had a similar issue in the past.\nIf vagrant wasnt soooo hard to maintain I would automate the complete VVV install with a chocolatey package but all my tests resulted in issues like this.. I found the error and it seems to work now.\nIt was a \"bad\" character in the path of my user account. I have an \"umlaut\" in my name and AzureAD seems to be sooo progressive that a German \"\u00f6\" is not converted into \"oe\" anymore for the foldername.\nIf this fixes things I will finally create a chocolatey package to install VVV with one command on Windows.. DONE (https://github.com/cfoellmann/varying-vagrant-vagrants/commit/8d9ca42c03560f2a51bb984c9509c4c6659273c5)\n. Somehow this line does not exist in the VVV master. I don't know why but it needs to be in the PR (patch) to not break the vagrant provision.\nJust see if you can fix that.\n. lets add a new empty line at the end\n. typo: systewide\n. Maybe you should use \nmarkdown\n[MIT License](LICENSE)\nthat way the link is correct for forks, too\n. lets add a new line at the end here\n. lets add a new line at the end here when we are on it.\n. lets add a new line at the end here\n. formatting...\n. lets add a \"new line\" at the end when we are on it.\n. lets add a \"new line\" at the end\n. you are right. Fix for the PR is coming. ",

Yeah just ran into this issue, removing the Vagrant curl resolved it -- sudo rm /opt/vagrant/embedded/bin/curl\n. This issue is a Vagrant issue, it didn't have anything to do with VVV specifically for me (FYI)\n. +1 on leaving it out of core OR making it optional somehow, because there's just too many huge multi-GB databases on my VVV instances already, that could quickly get out of hand and make it difficult to implement the code in a way that doesn't just take into account the number of backups retained but also limiting how large to cap the backup pool at.\n.

Argh, sorry for not catching that issue with the -e argument... Might actually be better to switch to printf for those again? But then we'd need to re-add the trailing \\n... Argh!\n. People will probably have the GitHub page open while running the first installation (as they'll need e.g. passwords anyway), so why not give it a shot.\n. Thanks for that quick run-down of the different commands! I agree that the current behavior is more \"native\", compared to a real server, so adapting to the new default behavior of Vagrant is fine.\nI'd however like to see that all the WordPresses are updated automatically whenever the VM is turned on or resumed, without having to run another command (after vagrant up is finally finished). Maybe something like that could be combined with restarting those services.\nSuch an update script could then probably be smaller and faster than the full provision.sh, while it would help in separating \"first install\" and \"updates\" for better maintainability.\n. Have you looked into creating the symlink on the host (and not in the guest VM)? (Note, that you might run into trouble with plugins/themes that use things like __FILE__ as those can result in undesired behavior when working with symlinks.)\nAlso, playing around with WP_CONTENT_DIR (as suggested inhttp://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/54063/have-multiple-local-wordpress-installs-share-a-wp-content-folder-and-database) might help. Additionally, you might need some rewrite rules to map the wp-content/ URLs of the sites to the same location in the filesystem.\n. I actually meant symlinks directly on the host (only).\nIf that does not work, you might have to check out the WP_CONTENT_DIR constant, maybe extend with some rewrite/alias magic in nginx, so that the URLs (for content directly in one of the wp-content/ subfolders are mapped to the correct files.\n. vagrant --version should be helpful here (we'll just have to account for https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/commit/f65f2d20d91aad075e4c8c51f34c22ce74e655df, which will change the return value slightly in the next version).\nWhere can we call this though? provision.sh is run in the guest VM only...\n. Ah, Alex shows us how to get the vagrant version in the Vagrantfile\nvagrant_version = Vagrant::VERSION.sub(/^v/, '')\nWith that, the question is, whether we can bail out of the Vagrantfile and end vagrant up prematurely.\n. Yes, develop.git.wordpress.org, please!\nI can't wait to finally be able to use tools like SourceTree on the same repo/working copy that I use for core development. No more need to maintain separate repos :-)\nThe initial clone might be a problem though, indeed. Unlike with the initial download of the vagrant box (which is then kept locally), the question is: How often do people fire up new vvv instances or destroy?\n. Oh, yeah, I forget that the www directory is kept when destroying. With that, the initial git clone is not that much of a problem. We could simply warn first time users that the very first vagrant up will take longer than usual, because the box has to be downloaded and the repos have to be cloned.\n. Yep, I remember that \"blank\" was confusing. It even led me to reading up on the -u command line parameter for mySQL :-)\nLet's change it and see if it breaks. And if so, devs should be smart enough to check the readme or docs. Given that this is a development tool and not for in-production use, there's nothing that can really break.\n. Other options (just for reference) could be a Google+ Community (to which Google might migrate Google Groups in the future, from what I have heard), or something like Stack Exchange.\nI guess it depends a little bit on the target audience.\n. I have no idea why GitHub had to give a second issue number to this PR. Sorry.\n. At least it's saying that 225 will be closed automatically when 227 is merged. :-)\n... which just happened, I think :-)\n. @DrewAPicture, testing the Dashboard for build.* was my goal as well, when I found this issue. The merged commit fixes both the frontend as well as the backend (redirect) issues.\nTo benefit from them, either trigger a full/fresh provision of the wordpress-develop folder (by deleting it and by dropping the DB, as Jeremy mentioned), or -- and that's much easier -- just add the code from my first post in the initial issue #225 to the wp-config.php of the wordpress-develop/src/ folder.\nThen (but you'll have to do that anyway every time you want to test build.* ), log in via vagrant ssh, cd to the wordpress-develop folder, and run grunt build (to copy the latest files and to re-build the CSS and JS). That will then also copy the modified wp-config.php to the build directory, so that working with build.* will work as expected -- with a different set of files (src vs. build directory), but with the same database (and therefore the same content and activated plugins and so on).\n. Either is fine with me, but MIT makes the most sense to me, given the situation.\n. Either is fine with me, but MIT makes the most sense to me, given the situation.\n. How about copying the webserver approach for naming, i.e. something like sites-available and sites-enabled?\n. Looks like this will be pretty smooth. :-)\nHere's my setup:\n- Parallels Desktop 9 (the latest version is 10) on OS X Yosemite.\n- Vagrant 1.6.5.\n- Installed the vagrant-hostsupdater plugin (recommend for Virtualbox as well).\n- Installed the Parallels Provider plugin via vagrant plugin install vagrant-parallels.\nThe Vagrantfile needs just a few changes, see https://github.com/TobiasBg/varying-vagrant-vagrants/commit/47c5537d34155e1330b4f49a79302054147d37db:\n- Configuration options are changed in a different way. I decided to set 1024MB of RAM, as we do that for Virtualbox as well. Additionally, I told Parallels to keep its Tools in the VM updated and opted for \"Better Performance\" instead of \"Longer Battery Life\" (see the docs).\n- The Vagrant Box is also hosted in the Vagrant Cloud, but uses a different name, so that we'll have to override the default name (via the \"Overriding Configuration\" method).\n- Finally, when configuring synced folders, we'll have to use different \"mount options\", as the current ones (\"dmode\" and \"fmode\") are specific to Virtualbox. Using the \"Overriding Configuration\" method, we can set them to the corresponding Parallels options. Details are in this Parallels Provider issue.\nThat's all that was necessary, so far. VVV is running smoothly in Parallels Desktop with those changes for me.\n. TL;DR: Support for Parallels Desktop works and shows good performance, but needs two more changes.\nOk, here are some more details and findings:\nFirst, I forgot one thing above: To use the Parallels Provider, the very first (and only that) boot of the VM has to be done with vagrant up --provider=parallels. Subsequent boots only need vagrant up.\nFurther testing revealed that some extra changes to our Vagrantfile and provisioning are necessary, as some errors are raised during provisioning otherwise:\n- Un-taring of the three downloaded tar archives (phpMemcachedAdmin, WP Stable, phpMyAdmin) shows a lot of red (\"Cannot change ownership to uid 0, gid 0\"), but things work.\n- npm install in the wordpress-develop site fails (grunt modules in node_modules are empty, except for their package.json, and thus grunt does not work).\nThe reason for this is file ownership: The Parallels Provider does not support chown (see https://github.com/Parallels/vagrant-parallels/issues/103#issuecomment-51479461), which tar -x (see https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-cachier/issues/53#issuecomment-27364917) and npm install need/run at one point or the other, if they are invoked as root (which they are, because provision.sh is run as root).\nTo work around this (in the same way as the approach for wp-cli from https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/370#issuecomment-44260526), tar and npm can be run as the vagrant user, as they are run in the user directory and don't require root permissions (see https://github.com/TobiasBg/varying-vagrant-vagrants/commit/2334e2a0685d78818a595d1f03b0788e06983a8c).\n(Note: Instead of changing the user for each command separately, we should probably think about running the non-system part of provision.sh as the vagrant user. But that's something for a future ticket.)\nAlso, we don't need the \"share\" mount option in the synced folder config for the Parallels Provider (see https://github.com/TobiasBg/varying-vagrant-vagrants/commit/394f0075d8c8267ef935068c8e618c01a72c949f). With that, the file owner is not set to www-data (which is what we want though), but to vagrant.\nAfter those changes, I could not spot any issues or errors and everything looks the same as a Virtualbox VVV (file ownership/~~permissions~~ (see below) in the VM, locations, ...). :-)\nVVV features like auto-site-setup and tools like phpunit, xdebug/Cachegrind/Webgrind, phpMyAdmin, etc. also work flawlessly.\nEverything is easy to use and to set up. \nIf Parallels Desktop is installed, only the above mentioned Parallels Provider plugin has to be installed. After that, the initial vagrant up for each VVV needs to specify the --provider option, with either virtualbox or parallels as the value. In my tests, parallels was the default, if the parameter was not specified. (I'm not sure why that is the case though, as the VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER environment variable is empty on my system.) As nothing at all changes if the Parallels Provider is not installed, this is not really an issue or extra step at all.\nNothing changes for existing users or users who only run Virtualbox.\nSpeed is also better for me. It does feel like sites are loading quicker.\nQuick and dirty measured comparisons between Parallels and Virtualbox:\n- phpunit (WP Unit Tests in wordpress-develop) runs\n  - on average 2.5 min with Parallels and\n  - on average 2.9 min with Virtualbox.\n- Latency/TTFB in the Chrome Dev Tools when surfing src.wordpress-develop.dev/wp-admin/ (with most pages probably cached):\n  - on average 80 ms with Parallels and\n  - on average 150ms with Virtualbox.\n. Ok, it looks like the above\n\neverything looks the same as a Virtualbox VVV (file ownership/permissions in the VM, locations, ...)\n\nis slightly incomplete. File permissions in the shared folder are mainly 644 for files and 700 for newly created directories (like wordpress-develop) or 755 for existing folders (like default). The difference to 775/774 in a Virtualbox VM is the result of :mount_options => [ \"dmode=775\", \"fmode=774\" ] not being available in the Parallels Provider.\nFor Virtualbox, those specific permissions where added in https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/commit/9b869053dc5d80e1b1521202eca2b1f991f5e7c9, but without stating examples for issues that triggered that change. If anybody can give me suggestions on what to test, that would be great.\n. @legal90, thanks for those great clarifications!\nThe higher priority of the plugin explains my confusion there :-) Fortunately, this will not affect VirtualBox-only users of VVV, and users who install the vagrant-parallels plugin probably want that as the default, or can override it easily using the --provider argument or the environment constant.\nYour explanation of the \"share\" mount option also makes sense. For consistency of the file rights with the VVV VirtualBox VM, leaving it out will probably be better, as the file owner will then be www-data while the active user will be vagrant.\n. @legal90 Very cool, thanks for the update on this! I'm still on PD 9 and everything is working fine with that now as well (the file access rights are slightly different in the guest VM, compared to the Virtualbox, but I did not run into any issues with that in practice). With this feature in PD 10.1.2, we might be able to strive for even closer matching PD/Virtualbox VMs in the future. But having support for PD 9 is probably also nice :-)\n. @legal90 Very cool, thanks for the update on this!

After thinking about it: Should those entries actually be in the hosts file? I thought that the xip.io DNS basically returns the IP addresses from the domains as the A record for those domains.\nSo:\n- Can your host do outgoing connections?\n- Does something like ping or nslookup return the correct IPs?\n- What happens when you directly surf to the IPs (i.e. http://192.168.8.115)?\n. Looks like you got it to work via https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/449#issuecomment-61006946, @CNSam?\n. If your host machine doesn't have internet access, that's likely, as the host won't resolve (i.e. not get an IP address from a DNS server). As a workaround, you could add the xip.io URLs with the correct IP to your hosts file.\n. It will just make npm-check-updates available on the command line -- so that it can be used in folders that have a package.json.\nA plain npm-check-updates will check all modules in the package.json for updated versions and print the results to the command line. npm-check-updates -u would update the version numbers in the package.json, taking away that manual step.\n. Neat, thanks for that, @aaronjorbin! Can that also update my package.json somehow?\n. Oops, I actually wanted to mention @aaronjorbin here :-)\n. The problem here are some network issues.\n\nNo network connection available, skipping package installation\n\nAs it seems, your VM can not access the internet. Due to that, the required packages (like the nginx webserver) could not be installed and nothing really will work.\nVVV is kind of forgiving on network issues when booting after the very first vagrant up, but on the first provisioning, network/internet access is mandatory.\nNow, this might have been only a temporary glitch with some server not being reachable, but it might also be possible that there's something wrong in the Virtualbox or host network configuration.\n. This could also be a file permission issue. Can you guys check who the owner of the folder/files is and what the file rights are? (cd to the folders after a vagrant ssh and check with ls -la.)\n. It is, indeed. The index.php is missing from the checkout and as DirectoryIndex is disabled, the Forbidden error is raised. This might be related to #509 which also mentions incomplete checkouts (there, due to certificate issues).\nCan you maybe try to delete the wordpress-* folders (backup your code/modifications in it first), and then re-run the provision? The folders should then get a fresh svn checkout and not just a svn update.\n. Great! Most likely then, the WP SVN servers had some temporary issues (maybe with the mentioned certificates) when you installed and did the first re-provision.\n. I'm not really in favor of his. I mainly work with the src repo for debugging and core contribution purposes and I'm happy to run grunt build manually whenever I need a current build.\nDoing it on every vagrant provision would only make that even slower.\nAlso, we have the core.svn repo which equals the build repo state.\n. Doesn't that log get mapped to the host machine (vvv-folder/log/), per https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/blob/master/Vagrantfile#L127?\n. Ah, my bad, hadn't spotted that difference.\n.

    "GaryJones": "I think this issue has focussed on the wrong problem. If VVV could listen out for grunt watch livereload (default port 35729) as the OP was intending to do (and as I would also like to do), then side-effect problems of different PATHS would not be the symptom.\n@ecurtis Did you ever get a VVV site livereloading when watching local files with grunt watch?\n. Seems that no changes are needed in VVV, so apologies for the misdirection.\n1. Add the option to livereload at the top of your watch task, as a global config:\njs\n   watch: {\n       option: {\n           livereload: true;\n       }\n       // ... targets\n   }\n2. Add a browser extension e.g. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei\n3. Run grunt watch, and it will start sending out notifications on port 35729.\n4. Remember to not just enable the extension, but to turn it on too (in Chrome, the central black dot of the icon should be completely black) so that it is actively listening out on port 35729. This must be done after grunt watch is running, otherwise it will say it can't connect to LiveReload server.\nIf you have JS disabled by default, then enable it for the site you want to use LiveReload with.\nWhen editing .php files, the reload will happen pretty much instantly on save (depending on what tasks you're running against .php files). With .scss files, it might take a few seconds, especially if you're running (Ruby) sass, autoprefixer, wpcss, cssjanus, cssmin, replacements, copies etc.) If you have your terminal window viewed, you'll see the reload happens as soon as the list of watch-related tasks has completed.\n. I had similar symptoms - running vagrant up --provision didn't do anything different to vagrant up, but running vagrant provision did correctly kickstart all of the provision install.\n. Vagrant 1.3.4, VirtualBox 4.2.18, Windows 7.\n(I've got an issue where synced folders aren't syncing, so I'm not sure if that's a contributing factor to the provisioning script not getting started or not.)\n. Does vagrant have a self-update feature? If not, what's the easiest way to grab the fresh version? Download, and install to the same location?\n. On 1.3.5, on a previously destroyed instance, I got:\n```\n$ vagrant up\nBringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider...\n[default] Clearing any previously set forwarded ports...\n[default] Creating shared folders metadata...\n[default] Clearing any previously set network interfaces...\n[default] Preparing network interfaces based on configuration...\n[default] Forwarding ports...\n[default] -- 22 => 2222 (adapter 1)\n[default] Running 'pre-boot' VM customizations...\n[default] Booting VM...\n[default] Waiting for machine to boot.

Forgot to reply to @jeremyfelt here. Tried removing .vagrant, cleared VirtualBox, and started afresh, but still no automatic provisioning, and still no synced folders (and no synced folders means no nginx and other configs so no server t respond to vvv.dev et al).\n. @jeremyfelt I tried up and provisioning from scratch, inside a cmd window opened as Administrator - still no joy in having the directories shared.\nHere's the up and provision dump: https://gist.github.com/GaryJones/cd5f3b80426020a5d8db\n. Guest Additions is something to do with VirtualBox and I added that in with a Vagrant plugin - it had no effect (i.e., I was getting the same issue before and after I installed and activated the vagrant plugin). Maybe it's not configured correctly, but it's beyond my knowledge to do so at the moment.\n. I followed https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest/issues/85#issuecomment-26700387 and after booting the VM for the second time, it ran straight through provisioning as well, including apparently sharing my local directories to the VM, and it added entries to my hosts file.\nI can't seem to reach a web page using vvv.dev (or the others URLs) or the IP address, even though the IP now responds to pings. nginx is started, but I don't know if there' a configuration issue (port / block to certain requests?) there.\n. Doing vagrant ssh, then service --status-all shows + for php-fpm and ? for mysql, but running sudo service mysql start says that it's already running.\nRunning vagrant provision updated composer and grunit-cli, restarted a few services, including mysql, , and generally all seems well. Just near the end however I get:\nmodule.js:340\n    throw err;\n          ^\nError: Cannot find module 'esprima'\n    at Function.Module._resolveFilename (module.js:338:15)\n    at Function.Module._load (module.js:280:25)\n    at Module.require (module.js:364:17)\n    at require (module.js:380:17)\n    at Object.<anonymous> (/srv/www/wordpress-develop/node_modules/grunt/node_modules/js-yaml/lib/js-yaml/type/js/function.js:4:15)\n    at Module._compile (module.js:456:26)\n    at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:474:10)\n    at Module.load (module.js:356:32)\n    at Function.Module._load (module.js:312:12)\n    at Module.require (module.js:364:17)\nNo change with vvv.dev or local.wordpress.dev or 192.168.50.4 - they don't appear to exist.\n. @jeremyfelt No joy yet, with a destroy, a git fetch and merge, a vagrant up (no need for provision command), ipconfig /flushdns and nbtstat -R calls, and a new browser.

I shut my local machine down with vagrant still up, and once the local machine was rebooted, and vagrant up applied, MySQL was still down.\nvagrant provision brought it back up successfully.\n. An alternative solution which avoids having to re-provision was to:\nvagrant ssh\nthen\nsudo service mysql start\n. I'm on a Mac and seeing exactly the same as @Joshi3s - with xdebug_on, not even vvv.dev loads, let alone one of the WP installs.\nMac: 10.9.2\nVirtualBox: 4.3.10\nVagrant: 1.5.1\nVVV: master\n. https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/blob/master/config/homebin/xdebug_on shows that xdebug_on is a shortcut for sudo php5enmod xdebug and then restarting PHP-FPM.\nWith a clue from http://www.lornajane.net/posts/2012/managing-php-5-4-extensions-on-ubuntu, what php5enmod here does is create a symlink between /etc/php5/fpm/conf.d/ and the /etc/php5/mods-available directory for specific ini files. So here, it's symlinking xdebug.ini, but with the new symlink also having the default priority as a prefix, 20-xdebug.ini.\nI tried manually calling php5enmod with other priorities, but nothing changed.\nI cd'd in to /etc/php5/fpm/conf.d and saw that there was already an xdebug.ini (no priority prefix) in there. I called sudo mv xdebug.init xdebug.ini.bak, then I called xdebug_on. When I checked the local sites, including vvv.dev/ they were all loading.\nI tried adding the ?XDEBUG_PROFILE to the end of a URL, and then refreshing webgrind (hitting the Update button), but nothing appeared, so at this stage I'm not sure if xdebug is actually enabled, or whether there's another problem. Running php -i shows that some xdebug values are now registered, which they weren't before.\nI'm just about at the limit of my command-line foo, but since there's another xdebug.ini inside mods-available folder, I suspect that my renaming of the other xdebug.ini has simple stopped that one being called, which might suggest that it's in some way invalid syntax.\nHopefully someone can jump in from there and work out the final problem!\n. http://bugs.xdebug.org/bug_view_page.php?bug_id=00000963 seems to match the symptoms being described here. I've not got any client listening out for xdebug. @jeremyfelt might, which is why he wasn't affected. Very bottom of the report suggests it's been fixed in xdebug 2.2.4. I'm apparently running 2.2.3 :-(\nLooking to see if I can find a way to test if 2.2.4 works.\n. sudo pecl install xdebug-2.2.4 then sudo service php5-fpm restart\nObviously that change is not part of the provision, but loading vvv.dev/ and other local sites now works without waiting for a listening client to respond, as does ?XDEBUG_PROFILE and then loading it into webgrind.\nUnless this work around can be coded into the provision, it might need to wait until apt updates on their end.\nThanks for @robneu for helping me get this far :-)\n. I've not looked into customising the VVV provision with a custom tweak, but I imagine those commands could be added to that so it picks up on all provisioning.\n. @jeremyfelt Yes - see the commands in my previous comment.\nSince Ubuntu 12.04 is LTS, it might be a while before apt make 2.2.4 available for it (according to @wpbacon).\n. Assuming they are following semantic versioning, yes, that could be done.\n. @jeremyfelt Anything stopping this from going in?\n. Not .test. Local sites are not necessarily test sites.\n. I've used phpbrew on the local machine, and it's really handy. Great to see it as part of VVV too. When do we get to have it, @jeremyfelt? :-) \n. Latest is now virtualbox 5.0.16, vagrant 1.8.1 and VVV 1.3.0, so updating all, re-provisioning may help.\n. I'm not sure if this is related, but I recently uninstalled global Grunt on my host machine (preferring all projects to include their own dependencies), and I'm now getting the following:\n\nAfter updating everything (VVV develop branch, latest box version, halted then vagrant up --provision), I then still got the same warning, but provisioning seemed to carry on:\n\nThere was an entry to say that Grunt was being installed, but even at the end, the error persisted:\n\n.

    "ericmann": "I just experienced this first-hand on a newly provisioned box (with a new version of Vagrant) and was mystified.  Not because of the provisioning change, but because of the fact that while some services start, others don't.\nFor example, Memcached is running after a halt/up.  But PHP, MySql, and Nginx are all stopped.\nTo test a theory, I manually went into the box and used update-rc.d to reconfigure all of the system start signals for these services, but they still do not start when running vagrant up.\n. Wow, there are a lot of solutions here ... but it doesn't need to be this difficult.\nWhen I run my Vagrant boxes on Windows I use a program called Fiddler as a local web proxy. It allows me to inspect any requests going across the network and, conveniently, ships with its own version of a dynamic hosts file. I can then tell my iOS device to use my Windows machine (port 8888, which is used by Fiddler) as a proxy and all requests pass dynamically through the proxy, use its hosts file, and can see the VM.\nFor Mac users, there's a similar program called Charles that will allow you to active the same - use the iOS device's native proxy settings to pipe traffic through the proxy running on your local machine directly to the VM.\n. If you symlink within the VM itself, it will work (the VM won't follow symlinks made on the host). Alternatively, Windows uses can create a Directory Junction on the host that will be followed within the VM.\nI often share themes and plugins across sites within a single VVV instance.\n. My vote would be MIT or at least dual license. GPL forces itself on derivatives, and I'm all for giving forkers the freedom to use whatever OS license they choose. That's why I use MIT where I can and only GPL where required by existing licenses.\n. Let's stop using hypothetical examples here, particularly with Microsoft as the scapegoat. For the record, that particular for-profit company has already contributed a significant amount back to the Vagrant project itself. Also, Vagrant itself is licensed as MIT, so there's no reason they or anyone else is required to contribute back their changes.\nI love open source, but I also recognize there are situations where viral OS licenses (like the GPL) are inappropriate: namely many government, healthcare, and financial environments. Applying a GPL license to our project will effectively cut out potential contributions from those projects. I'd rather risk a greedy for-profit using our software within a closed environment than cut off a large part of the community like that.\n. The GPL is called \"viral\" because any derivative projects must also be licensed under the GPL (i.e. the license \"infects\" derivative works).\nThe issue with GPL software is one of distribution, but not necessarily to the public. If I use GPL software (i.e. WordPress) to host your website, you as the consumer never receive the software itself - therefore I don't necessarily have to give you a copy of the source code. This is how companies like Automattic and WPEngine can use WordPress (GPL) in specially modified forms (also GPL) for hosting without being required to give their modified copies to their customers.\nLikewise, a GPL-licensed version of VVV used to spin up a remote environment would not trigger the distribution/source-availability clause of the license for anyone who uses the environment through, say, a web browser.\nHowever, the tricky part comes in when dealing with development teams. If my hosting tools are GPL, and I hire you as a contractor to work on the project, I have to give you access to the code itself. Under the GPL, you're now entitled to your own copy and have the right to distribute that copy on your own. \nSo, if VVV (licensed as GPL) is being used by a dev team in-house, and they need to add proprietary magic to it to simulate their internal hosting environment, the derived VM generation package would also need to be licensed under the GPL. Developers, either in-house or subcontracted, would then have the right to repurpose and redistribute this otherwise proprietary code. I can tell you from personal experience this will not fly in many healthcare, gov't, and financial organizations since, even though they use open source (read: MIT, BSD, Apache licenses), they still have code that is necessarily private and proprietary.\nAlso of note: MIT is \"GPL compatible\" so we could license VVV as MIT, then forkers could distribute their own forks as GPLv2/3. We can't do it the other way around, though.\n. MIT++\n. MIT++\n. It's usually a matter of copying the site files from one checkout of VVV to another. I just did this, actually.\n- Check out a clean copy of VVV on the new machine\n- Copy any data from your www directory to the new checkout\n- Copy any custom Nginx configs to the new checkout\n- Copy any DB dumps (and the necessary SQL setup scripts) to the new checkout\n- Run vagrant up on the new machine\nI was also able to cleanly switch VM providers from VirtualBox to Hyper-V by just changing references in the Vagrantfile ... no messiness at all.\n. You can force Unix-style line endings in your global Git configuration and use VVV on Windows without any issues.\n. Yep, this is actually a reported but in PHP-FPM itself, but the fix above will allow us to bypass the issue.\n. First and foremost, this makes a huge difference if you ever import a DB into VVV only temporarily. If you do so, and MySQL is using a single file, the file will expand to fit automatically. When the DB is later dropped, though, the file will not decrease in size, meaning you're continuing to lose space on the disk.\nSo whether you're archiving/purging old projects or just deleting large DBs used to perform data migrations (in some cases these can be 2GB+) you end up with lost disk space due to the single file.\nThe flag is quick, simple, and even with large DBs I've never seen an issue with performance on either Windows or Mac (using Hyper-V or VirtualBox). Then again, WordPress uses a very small number of tables, so the table-related performance issues in that linked document won't necessarily affect the large majority of users.\nI'm all for making this change.\n.

Fair 'nuff. Was under the impression we had abandoned versioning a while ago, so I never caught this change.\n. Fair 'nuff. Was under the impression we had abandoned versioning a while ago, so I never caught this change.\n. I (obviously) have no objections here. For context, vagrant-hostsupdater was itself a fork of yet another unmaintained project (that broke when Vagrant changed the plugins API version a while back). We forked yet again so we could polish off some unimplemented features of the plugin.\nNamely, command line usage.\nIn addition to setting the ghost.config.hosts array in a Vagrantfile, you can also update an aliases file in the project, then run vagrant ghost from the command line to automatically ingest those new host aliases into the machine (and your local hosts file). It's a simple change, but it was a command that worked in the original hostsmanager plugin, was abandoned in hostsupdater, and was required for our use.\nI can definitely put together a PR for this change.\nNote: @johnpbloch did the original forking work, but the plugin had to be co-located in another repo for testing. He lost props for his efforts when I migrated things into its own repository. I point this out to emphasize the project is supported by more than just me.\n. It cleans up a bit of the documentation, removes some dead code, and adds the ability to run vagrant ghost from the command-line to re-ingest your hosts and update the hosts file. \nThe \"original\" hostsupdater plugin was itself a fork of another plugin. The real original plugin wasn't updated to the v2 of the Vagrant plugin API, so it stopped working a while ago. Hostsupdater forked and updated some of the code, but skipped the CLI entirely (even though it reports as being available with vagrant list-commands).\nThe entire point of the Ghost fork is to keep the plugin alive (there's no guarantee that Vagrant will stick with the v2 plugins API) and to rebuild the CLI components of the plugin. Aside from that, we also switched to referring to an aliases file instead of a hosts file for a list of addresses. This is because we often use Ansible for provisioning, and a hosts file has a completely different meaning in that world (the recursive directory search of VVV flat out breaks things if used in an Ansible project).\n. @sethrubenstein We don't have a full resolution yet (which is why the issue is still open). The change would likely be migrating run to run_remote, but without the vagrant ssh -c part (as run_remote is already executing against the remote guest.\nThe issue is that run_remote executes remotely as root while run \"vagrant ssh -c ...\" executes remotely as the Vagrant user. That particular difference won't break anything for a new or vanilla install (as we can place custom hooks in the root user's bin directory or global bin), but if anyone has added their own custom scripts, they'd be lost in the transition. That was what Jeremy was getting at with his own question.. @nekojira The PR linked above resolves the issue entirely without commenting anything out - apparently using config even inside a scoped conditional doesn't jive well with Vagrant's bundled Ruby interpreter.\n. Note, I've verified this on both Mac with VirtualBox and Windows with Hyper-V. It resolves the provisioning error on Mac without blocking provisioning on Windows.\n. Or, you know, alert the maintainer that his boxes suddenly disappeared from Atlas so he can fix the problem.\nBox restored. Please close this.\n. It hasn't really needed an update. It's just that the S3 bucket that was hosting the file got deleted and I had to restore a new copy.\n. > How does remote debugging play into all of this? Is the xdebug configuration shared or is that up to the individual PHP docker images?\nI haven't yet played with remote debugging across the Docker instances yet, but the xdebug configuration would need to be per-container. Each container is completely isolated, so this would enable you to have xdebug on in one while off in the others, but again, not something I've set up just yet.\n\nHow does this work with command line tools such as phpunit and wp? It would be pretty fantastic to run a suite of tests against multiple versions.\n\nThe commands change a tiny bit due to the nature of using a container. On the one hand, you could docker exec into a new container in Bash, then cd into the project directory and run commands directly. On the other hand, I've had some success with aliasing wp and phpunit on a per-project basis to run an exec command directly. I'll look up what I did to make that happen, but it does enable running test suites against multiple PHP configurations.\n\nIt appears that PHP's configuration for each of these is deployed inside the Docker container. Does VVV have any control over that configuration or is it shipped as part of the upstream package?\n\nRight now, it's using just the default configuration, but we could map a VVV-controlled config into the containers to give external control. Do you have a specific config file (that would work with all of the versions) you'd like mapped in?\n\nWe have quite a bit of progress on PHPBrew in tickets such as #854. It would be interesting to compare some pros/cons of each approach.\n\nBiggest con to PHPBrew is that you won't be running that in production - but in quite a few cases, you would be running a Docker container to wrap PHP. If we're seeking at all to retain dev/production parity, that's a big concern. A big pro to Docker is that you can run multiple containers at the same time for different projects. If you've got 5 client projects, each targeting a different PHP version in production, swapping PHPBrew multiple times when switching focus is a hurdle to productivity - Docker would let you set up each to use the right version of PHP and just go.\n\nMy one immediate hesitation is that the docker images for each version of PHP seem to always be running in the background, even when not in use. Maybe a command similar to PHPBrew could make sense where it makes a single image available at a time as the backend.\n\nThe containers aren't that heavy when they're idling ... what's your concern here?\n\n\nThere is no PHP 5.2 container as that version pre-dates FPM availability\n\nI believe it's possible with a php-fpm patch, but seems uuuuuughhhly and unfriendly.\n\nOh, there are workarounds, but all of them are ugly, difficult to maintain, and held together with naught but duct tape and prayers.\n. We'll likely need to find an alternative. That box was badly out of date and was taken offline several weeks ago.. First, you need a box. I had a Trusty build that I had configured on Hyper-V myself. But it was costing me a bunch of money to host, so I killed it late last year. If you do find a box, it'll work fine so long as you:\n- have the Pro edition of Windows\n- explicitly enable Hyper-V support (using \"Turn Windows Features On/Off\"). @Johnhhorton unfortunately no. I have't used VVV in HyperV since last summer and haven't maintained or tested any Trusty builds under that VM since December at the latest.. When I made the Trusty build above I literally sat a MacBook and a Windows PC side by side and spun up fresh Trusty installs on each (Mac with VirtualBox, Windows with Hyper-V) so they'd have 100% parity.\nThe default Vagrant Hyper-V docs were particularly useful in keeping track of what to install as I went: https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/hyperv/boxes.html\nNote: I built the original box a couple of years ago, so my memory is foggy on all of the steps I took ... but those docs, and the docs for building base boxes in general, might get you started.. FWIW, you might want to look at @johnpbloch's Trusty box as an alternative. https://atlas.hashicorp.com/johnpbloch/boxes/trusty64. @Johnhhorton if that box is working, would you be up to submitting a PR to this repo swapping out the box definitions?.

Hi David! Are you getting some kind of error when that code is executed?\n. Hi David! Are you getting some kind of error when that code is executed?\n. From your terminal output, it seems like the wordpress-develop installation and update process is working fine, but it also looks like it's not a fresh run of the provisioning script, so maybe something went wrong in a previous process and now that's breaking your provision. The most effective way to debug this would be running a vagrant destroy and then vagrant up again.\nIf even with that the problem still exists, I'd continue debugging by removing block by block of the problematic code, and seeing if that works. Then you can debug in a per line basis till you find the the one that is causing your problem. \n. Well, that was pretty much my point, thank you! :)\n. I've been silently following this issue and trying to track down the problem for a couple of weeks now, since it happens in all of my VMs. I use Windows 7 (64 bits) as host, so this may not be useful for Linux users.\nI initially went the upstart way, thinking that something might be wrong there, but none of the things I tried worked. Just a few minutes ago, I started one of my VMs from the Virtualbox Administrator, which shows some information that is not visible when you start via Vagrant. This was what showed up for me:\n\nSomething was failing indeed, so I went to the /etc/init/vvv-start.conf file (the script that should start MySQL) to see what was wrong there. I didn't see anything weird in the code, but if I executed the file manually, a \"unexpected end of file\" error would appear. That could only mean that the file was using incorrect line endings (well, not only, but it's a typical error). Sublime Text 3 said that my local ./config/init/vvv-start.conf file (the file that is copied to /etc/init/vvv-start.conf) was in ASCII format (yeah, WTF), and the line endings were Windows'. I changed it all to UTF-8 and Unix, halted the VM, then vagrant up and vagrant ssh. Once in there, I ran sudo cp /srv/config/init/vvv-start.conf /etc/init/vvv-start.conf, halt and up again. When the VM started and I logged in, I could finally see mysql start/running.\ntl;dr; version: If you're using Windows, make sure your ./config/init/vvv-start.conf file is using Unix line endings.\n. @jonathan-dejong: You may want to run manually your /etc/init/vvv-start.conf file (from inside the VM) and see if that triggers some syntax error. It is expected to fail saying description: command not found and start: Unknown job: on, but it will give some input in case something is wrong within the file.\nOn the other hand, since I'm working on Windows, I'm really not sure if another solution is needed for OS X systems.\n. For me, it was the DOS format all over again (I'm on Windows 7). What I did was convert /vagrant/config/homebin/xdebug_on to UTF-8 and change the line endings to UNIX. Then sudo cp /vagrant/config/homebin/xdebug_on /home/vagrant/bin/. After that, I got xdebug working as expected.\n. I had the same happening to me while listening for PHP debug connections in PhpStorm. Turned out it was a problem of wrong path mapping between host and VM.\n. If you're using Windows, make sure your ./config/init/vvv-start.conf file is using Unix line endings, then provision again. After that, MySQL should start on boot after just a vagrant up. See https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/287#issuecomment-37714088 for more details. It seems to be more of a conflict than a bug.\n. I had this happening a lot some time ago. Besides what @johnjamesjacoby recommends, I'd suggest enabling natdnshostresolver and natdnsproxy if you haven't done it yet. That should help resolve requests a little faster, since that error message can also appear after timeouts.\nYou just need to add this to your Customfile:\nruby\nconfig.vm.provider :virtualbox do |v|\n    v.customize [\"modifyvm\", :id, \"--natdnshostresolver1\", \"on\"]\n    v.customize [\"modifyvm\", :id, \"--natdnsproxy1\", \"on\"]\nend\n. You're welcome, I'm glad to see that helped :)\n. Maybe not needed anymore, but you can also do it by adding this to your Customfile:\nruby\nconfig.vm.provision \"shell\", inline: \"xdebug_on\", privileged: false\n. Hi there. Have you tried to start a new Vagrant box without using VVV? That way we can make sure if your issue is Vagrant-related or VVV-related (by your post that doesn't seem clear to me, but maybe I'm missing something). Also, did you try a custom provisioner to replace the default one? I'm thinking in a provision-custom.sh file that could use an alternative installation method for WP-CLI.\n. You can start just by making a copy of provision/provision.sh named provision/provision-custom.sh. If that file exists, that's the provisioner that will run instead of provision.sh. Within this new file you can just replace the part of WP-CLI installation with your own process. I think something like this can help:\n``` bash\necho -e \"\\nDownloading wp-cli, see http://wp-cli.org\"\nDownload master branch using wget instead of git\nwget https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/archive/master.zip -P /srv/www\nUnzip package\nunzip /srv/www/master.zip -d /srv/www\nRename properly\nmv /srv/www/wp-cli-master /srv/www/wp-cli\nRemove useless zip file\nrm /srv/www/master.zip\nGo to wp-cli directory and install with Composer\n/srv/www/wp-cli\ncomposer install\n```\nThis is a very rough sketch that can be improved a lot, but maybe that way you'll see if you can get through WP-CLI installation.\nOne more thing I can think of is starting the VM with vagrant up --no-provision, checking the WP-CLI repo with Git and install with Composer manually, then vagrant reload --provision with a provision-custom.sh that excludes the whole WP-CLI installation.\n. Both GPL and MIT work for me.\n. I'm having this same issue, even after detroy. Running vagrant box add ubuntu/trusty64 returns the same error. I'm using Vagrant 1.4.3, but I'll try updating to 1.5.4.\n. Well, it works fine with 1.5.4, so at least for me, 1.4.3 was the problem.\n. Hi @dezinerdudes! Have you tried disabling the Windows firewall? I run into this issue from time to time in Windows machines, and the firewall has always been the problem for me, by blocking inbound and outbound connections.\n. ",

Your proposition is ok, but there are some alternative solutions:\n1. on first initial vagrant up ask for su password, generate passwordless ssh key for user running vagrant and authorize this key on su account. In this way hostsupdater will be able to modify any config file which requires su permissions to write.\n2. you can use ACL settings if / is mounted with ACL to add permission to write to /etc/hosts to any user.\n3. user can set passwordless sudo on host machine.

However, the solution is already in place in VVV's Vagrantfile, so I'm at a loss for a solution. Hope this helps tho.\n. This depends on the audience for VVV. \nCore committers are the only ones I can think of that might prefer svn installations. For the rest of us, I'd wager git is a preferable install. \nWith a hat-tip to WordPress' Design for the Majority philosophy, I suggest we default to git, with an option to toggle the repositories to svn.\n. Drew said:\n\nI prefer svn installations fwiw, and not just because I'm a committer. This largely has to do with the git mirrors being precisely that ... mirrors.\n\nDon't see your point here, can you expand? Git mirrors have first-class-citizen support for git as far as I understand.\n. Drew said:\n\nMy feeling is that as long as core continues to be versioned with svn, VVV -- considered to be the officially recommended vagrant package for core development -- should follow that lead. \n\nWhether or not there's any official recommendation by the WordPress core team, the VVV community should define and serve its userbase independently.

The project's reasons for staying on svn, as I understand, are a matter of priority and backwards compatibility. That's a separate issue from the goal of VVV: providing the greater contributor-base with a VM to use for WordPress core development (among other things).\nI think we can all agree svn is the past and git is the future. I'm personally unwilling to learn any more about svn than I already do, unless out of necessity, because it is an archaic technology. We should push contributors to use modern, familiar, and better tools. \n.

Pretty sure this is symptomatic of mitchellh/vagrant#1673, which unfortunately is unresolved.\n. Would syncing the /log folder on the host machine's vvv dir to /var/log inside the virtual machine be more helpful?\n. Sorry - didn't realize, this acutally does happen.

I'll confirm that in a sec and modify the docs accordingly.\n. Yep, that's it. \n. This is a duplicate of #727\n. phpcs is installed inside the virtual machine. Are you trying to access it on your host?\n. This will work in a backwards compatible manner with custom sites. Any custom sites that have been created and use HTTPS will have the same \"site URL doesn't match common name\" warning as before. If they also want to avoid this warning on their site, they could re-run the openssl req command adding their site's common name in the options.\n. \n:heart_eyes:\n.

    "aaroncampbell": "With [27250] & [27257] we now have MySQLi in core (see #21663), so I think this is a great candidate now.  Also, getting all VVV setups moving to PHP5.5/MySQLi will help core get better testing for the new code.\n. I have to say, I was working on some stuff that needed to use the error log for debugging, and having to ssh in was extremely unhandy since I have scripts on my main machine that I use for dealing with this kind of thing.  I ended up just setting up a symbolic link to one of the already shared folders while I was working.  I think a more complete and permanent solution would be great.\n. I tried this out, here's my take:\n1. I like the idea of all my sites being listed in the dashboard. It's handy.\n2. I like seeing all the URLs associated with a particular site.\n3. I don't like the weight added to the dashboard by bootstrap.  I don't think the slightly more aesthetically pleasing look is worth all that extra weight. Let's put super-simple styles in instead.\n4. I also don't like the idea of loading anything via CDN, mostly because VVV works so well offline and I want it to stay that way.\n5. I think there needs to be a little more logic in splitting the columns...or don't split them.  If you have larger multisite setups, the list can be VERY lopsided (my first three sites had several hundred links and my last three had one each).  The logic I used it to keep a count of the total URLs and use that as a way to divide it up, kind of like this:\n``` PHP\n   <?php\n   //print each file name\n   $total_urls = 0;\n   foreach ( $files as $file) {\n     //check to see if the file is a folder/directory\n     if ( is_dir( $file ) ) {\n         if ( is_file( $file.'/vvv-hosts' ) ) {\n             $hosts = explode( \"\\n\", file_get_contents( $file.'/vvv-hosts' ) );\n             $sites [] = array(\n                 'folder' => $file,\n                 'hosts' => $hosts,\n                 'type' => 'local'\n             );\n             $total_urls += count( $hosts );\n         }\n     }\n   }\n   $sites [] = array(\n     'type' => 'url',\n     'url' => 'https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/wiki/Add-New-Domain',\n     'title' => ' Add a New Site',\n     'description' => 'Learn how to add a new site to your VVV installation'\n   );\n$columns = array();\n   $num_urls = 0;\n   while ( $num_urls < $total_urls / 2 ) {\n     $site = array_shift( $sites );\n     $num_urls += count( $site['hosts'] );\n     $columns[0][] = $site;\n   }\n   $columns[] = $sites;\n   ?>\n   ```\n6. I would also convert it to listing the URLs in an unordered list or at least implode on a line break to make them easier to find as well.\n. Is there a reason we can't go to 64 bit during this move? I've been playing some with HHVM, and it's pretty simple to adjust my VVV to use it except that it needs a 64bit box. I switched to precise64 a while ago and everything has been great.\n. Most of the servers I work with are 64bit. Having said that, most servers I work with run 8+G of ram, so it only makes sense.  In my, admittedly slanted, experience, more and more places are moving to 64bit OSs. You no longer have the instability issues you once had with 32bit programs acting flaky on 64bit systems, because everyone writes for both now (except the few super-progressives like HHVM, who only write for 64bit).  Everything in VVV should run perfectly on Trusty64, and it would be less limiting for people using it to experiment with things like HHVM (which I'm doing, and I know others are as well).\n. Just to be clear, everything works great with a clean setup but I haven't tested any serious upgrades to existing setups yet.\n. Over the weekend I applied my patch here to several VVV installs to upgrade them, including my main dev one which has about 30 WP installs, several of them complex multisite ones. I haven't had a single issue yet.\n. Good catch on the npm thing. I added npm in 8cbe403\nI really wish we didn't have to symlink like that for the node vs nodejs thing, but I don't see any other way.  I added that in ba26aa8\nIn 67ee684 I added a routine that checks /srv/www/wordpress-develop to see if it needs an svn upgrade.  If it does, then it assume all svn repos probably do so it cans for them in /srv/www and upgrades them all.\n. I'm good with either (and apparently I'm in the majority here), but I agree with Nacin that MIT probably makes the most sense since that's what Vagrant is. I also don't see the issue being raised about commercial applications (and protecting \"secret sauce\") since the GPL only required you to license that way if you \"distribute\" and a company doesn't distribute it's secret sauce (and employees that leave, which was mentioned, are almost always breaching contract if they distribute it, which is another issue entirely).\nAnyway, +1 to either MIT or GPLv2+\n.

    "ryanduff": "Thinking out loud, but is it possible the precise32 base box got updated? Since it downloads and caches local for pretty much eternity, this could be a \"new user\" thing. \nI haven't used VVV yet so I'm going to pull a copy quick and follow the new-user instructions to see what happens. Running vbox 4.3.2 and vagrant 1.3.5. We'll see what happens. \n. Sorry, meant the .box file was cached. Which is the state it boots up as on a new vagrant up\nAny time you destroy a specific vagrant machine it reverts to that. But it doesn't download every time. So if the remote base box changed (at http://files.vagrantup.com/precise32.box ) newer users may be seeing different results than someone who's had it downloaded from a year ago. \n. Related to the original discussion, I've got a bunch of red in my console, but not all the same failures as @jtsternberg \nThat in itself is slightly concerning that we're not getting the same provision every time. After all, that's the point of vagrant. \n. @TheLastCicada I was actually about to suggest hosting the base box-- since you can actually build out some core versions of packages pre-installed w/ the box which will cut down on the new provision time. The drawback of course is bandwidth. \nI've packaged a few boxes for specific projects for that reason. Fortunately it's where only a few people use so the random once and done new user download of the box at ~400mb isn't a big deal. Always a bit more hairy when it's open for the public. \n@jeremyfelt I actually went back to read some of the messages and while there were some showing as red, but actually ok (GPG keys), I did have a fair amount of actual errors. \nAs far as my test install, I never was able to get completely through on a clean install. I got as far as cloning wp-cli and it hung there. Again, there were other errors up the line so may or may not be related. I've done a destroy and am trying a clean vagrant up to see what happens. \n. Absolutely. I got hung on wp-cli two times in a row. Here's a gist of the output of everything after vagrant up\nhttps://gist.github.com/ryanduff/0e4089e40bbebb5e715e\n. There's a double sided coin to pre-provisioning certain software. \nA bunch is pre-installed and doesn't need to be re-created after every destroy. Certain things can easily be updated if using a proper provisioner like puppet where you can ensure a certain version. Updating that in the repo will cause an update of those packages on a new up. Downside is that you may want to periodically update the base box (say once a year) but that leads to people having to re-download and bandwidth. \nI come from CentOS/Puppet world and was actually considering starting a CentOS based version of something like this with a proper provisioner. Unless... others want to collaborate. \nAnd yeah Packer. We've already gone down one rabbit hole today. \n. Either license is fine. \n. Either license is fine. \n. ",

    "adamsilverstein": "Ah! Thanks! When I tried testing this before submitting the request, I tested erroneously leaving out 'core'; \n. I understand completely. I was hesitant to even submit the pull request because I either saw the thread you mentioned or sensed intuitively that multisite might not make sense for the default install. I submitted the request today only because someone asked about it at wcphx - I pointed him to my fork to make it easy for him and thought others might want the same. \nThanks for your loving work on VVV, makes all our lives a little better every day! Much appreciated!\n. @shaneholloman I think you are fine and just need to add the new 'subdomain' to your hosts file - I believe VVV does this for the main site when you set it up, but as you add sites you will need to add them manually so your computer can resolve the domains.  \nOn a mac I edit /etc/hosts (using sudo) add the domain so it resolves to the same ip address as the vvv install (you will see other entries in there with the correct ip address - in my case its 192.168.50.4).\n. I think the MIT license seems most appropriate, given @ericmann's persuasive arguments above - seems like this would allow the widest options for contribution back to the project. If you can't get all existing contributors on board, a joint MIT/GPL license might be a good compromise. \n. ",

I've found the issue to be the latest version of Vagrant checking vagrant cloud to see if the box is up to date. This may be a very useful feature but I certainly don't want to check this on each vagrant up. \n\nI suggest we set config.vm.box_check_update = false and allow power users to update their box with this command: \nvagrant box update\n. @simonwheatley  i'll try to find a way that would satisfy this by checking for internet connection before checking if the box is up to date.\n. @simonwheatley , I've included an internet connection check before disabling or enabling the box update check . This now happens in the background :) \n. @jeremyfelt  , you're right. I'm running version 1.5.2 and haven't checked out 1.5.3 yet. Thanks for letting me know :) \n. @simonwheatley  seems like this issue was resolved upstream in vagrant 1.5.3 so there's no need for a pull request after all :) \n.

    "mastef": "Thanks for the quick reply. I was under the impression that your goal was to bootstrap quickly a working Wordpress dev environment that closely resembles a working production environment. In the config/ directory I can see that you're using different configs for different modules. With Docker you'd be able to easily create separate containers for each of those, to keep the environment less messy.\nIn your current config you'd have : \n- one base image for Ubuntu; and then inheriting images :\n- memcached\n- MySQL\n- a basic Wordpress install ( php5, nginx, etc )\n- image for the dashboard\nThen when booting up vagrant, you'd run the different containers ( one mysql + wordpress container for each environment, maybe even memcached to prevent conflicts ), with ENV vars defining which branch to work with, and they'd be working in their own environments only exposing the necessary ports - e.g. 80 and 22 each. The best part of it is that you could simply commit the Docker Wordpress stable container and run it on your production server and have the same environments locally and externally; hence it'd be a fully bootstrapped project environment for dev and prod.\nI think it'd be great, but maybe I'm missing the point?\n. So for example there's this example Dockerfile jbfink created for Wordpress : https://github.com/jbfink/docker-wordpress/blob/master/Dockerfile\nSince we're using Debian here, I simply downloaded the Dockerfile, changed the first line to a Debian one instead, and that was about it. docker build -rm -t mastef/wordpress . built the new image, and it was then easily started with docker run -d -p 8080:80 -p 8022:22 mastef/wordpress - binding the otherwise random ports to 8080 and 8022. When running the run command, it will execute the last CMD line, and run that every time - in this case this start.sh : https://github.com/jbfink/docker-wordpress/blob/master/start.sh which creates the passwords.\nIn the same sense to create any further builds, simply run it again with other ports, and they're all up in their own controlled containers.\nI actually did a small write-up on Dockerfiles here, mentioning caveats, if you're interested : http://blog.stefanxo.com/2014/01/breaking-down-a-dockerfile/\nHere internally we went a few steps further, in a similar direction as you did - our builds include wp-cli and automatically install the necessary plugins with it. So for me to start a new version of a Wordpress build with the latest plugins, it just takes a rebuild and then seconds again.\nThe best parts about rebuilding is that apt-get update and such are cached. Only the lines below the changed lines in a Dockerfile will be re-executed.\n. You can build the Docker images on vagrant up, but it would be better to have a private Docker registry somewhere where they are actually hosted ( you can also host base images in the public repository - https://index.docker.io/ e.g. ubuntu:latest is hosted in the public repo and pulled from there. For open source projects the public repo is perfect ). That way you just pull the latest cached/built containers, instead of rebuilding them on each boot.\nFor provisioning check this out if it answers your question : http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/provisioning/docker.html as I'm not familiar yet with that specific command\n. @TheLastCicada yes absolutely!\nIt's just one change in the Dockerfile and you can run them at the same time. Since Dockerfiles inherit others, if you make a right structure it will work very well. So in your case you could make : \n- a ubuntu/debian base container that installs everything but php\n- a seperate child Dockerfile for each php version\n- and then the WP project inheriting that\nBut that would be redundant, as you need to specify which container you want to inherit from. So you'd need to copy over the WP project Dockerfiles multiple times to inherit the proper versions.\nWhat you could also do is using the normal project, and then inheriting the project with the PHP test Dockerfiles. Those would then uninstall the current PHP version, and install your PHP version of choice. That way you only have one project flow, with the different PHP versions at the end of it.\n- base image\n- php / mysql / etc\n- wordpress project\n- uninstall php, install desired php version\nIf I'm not super-clear let me know.\nDocker basically enables you to create your own little heroku PaaS ( see https://github.com/progrium/dokku and https://flynn.io/ - everybody is waiting for Flynn to be finished )\nAlso this example project of a Wordpress SaaS : http://developer.rackspace.com/blog/slumlord-hosting-with-docker.html is quite cool. It was my starting point\n. Yeah @jeremyfelt I understand your reasoning. KISS - Keep it simple stupid.\nThe reason I'm excited with Docker is that it's super-simple. Especially since Rackspace were so enthusiastic about it when advising our startup ( and they actually make money on PaaS themselves ), and people used to Chef/Puppet's horrors were so ecstatic about how simple it suddenly becomes. It's the missing link in IT deployments, the git for server structures.\nIf you have a lazy weekend, take a look. I'm sure you won't be disappointed.\n. @lkwdwrd Fully agree! It was simply to show an easy example of how Docker can easily build a WP instance. That's why I also linked https://github.com/Krijger/docker-cookbooks in the initial issue; which has a nice dependency rundown.\nLinking is great to connect separate docker instance just by sharing a few exposed ports, in addition to Docker volumes across instances for folder sharing - a nice article on that here : https://github.com/Krijger/docker-cookbooks\n. I'm not an expert in how vvv works ( yet ), but the WordPress framework devs I work with all rely on it. So yes, I'm happy to start a use-case scenario of having this work with Docker!\n. Currently working here on a Docker stack, so will def. provide either input or a working solution at some point! Something very interesting to consider is what the guys at shipyard did\nBasically shipyard is a Web/API interface for Docker, so you can easily spin up new Docker images and assign them to domains and ports easily through it - or the API.\nBut for us what the interesting part is - all you need to do is run this command 'docker run -i -t -v /var/run/docker.sock:/docker.sock shipyard/deploy setup' and it will automatically pull all the different images and set up a small cloud together that is intertwined and connected. \nBy running that one command you actually end up with a Loadbalancer/Router listening on port 80, a Redis container, the shipyard container, and a Database container ( PostgreSQL ) - all with one command. \nSo instantly you have the shipyard app listening on port 8000, and the lb listening on port 80 and routing all requests to the appropriate configured apps.\nVery interesting for a Dev environment setup!\n. Hi jb510, FYI: boot2docker is only a very lightweight unix system that allows Docker to run. Docker can be run on most unix systems - e.g. Ubuntu, Debian, Redhat, anything really. Another lightweight unix system which works great with Docker is also coreOS https://coreos.com/\nAnd regarding the comment from the Docker creator ( unrelated, just FYI ) - it's regarding Docker 0.7.*. With Docker 0.8 MacOS X is officially supported as well ( however! It still needs a virtual env in coreOS, boot2docker or ubuntu, etc. ). Some great changes :  http://blog.docker.io/2014/02/docker-0-8-quality-new-builder-features-btrfs-storage-osx-support/\nAbout Vagrant-LXC - Docker actually is just a wrapper for LXC, and makes it easier to work with it.

If I use GPL software (i.e. WordPress) to host your website,\nyou as the consumer never receive the software itself - therefore I don't\nnecessarily have to give you a copy of the source code. This is how\ncompanies like Automattic and WPEngine can use WordPress (GPL) in specially\nmodified forms (also GPL) for hosting without being required to give their\nmodified copies to their customers.\nLikewise, a GPL-licensed version of VVV used to spin up a remote\nenvironment would not trigger the distribution/source-availability clause\nof the license for anyone who uses the environment through, say, a web\nbrowser.\nHowever, the tricky part comes in when dealing with development teams.\nIf my hosting tools are GPL, and I hire you as a contractor to work on the\nproject, I have to give you access to the code itself. Under the GPL,\nyou're now entitled to your own copy and have the right to distribute\nthat copy on your own.\nSo, if VVV (licensed as GPL) is being used by a dev team in-house, and\nthey need to add proprietary magic to it to simulate their internal hosting\nenvironment, the derived VM generation package would also need to be\nlicensed under the GPL. Developers, either in-house or subcontracted, would\nthen have the right to repurpose and redistribute this otherwise\nproprietary code. I can tell you from personal experience this will not fly\nin many healthcare, gov't, and financial organizations since, even though\nthey use open source (read: MIT, BSD, Apache licenses), they still have\ncode that is necessarily private and proprietary.\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/346#issuecomment-43919219\n.\n\n\n-Doug\n.

If you're on a Mac, by default it will try to use Virtualbox to run the default VM, which it will then run Docker containers on top of. From the link you referenced:\n\nIn an OS X installation, the docker daemon is running inside a Linux VM called default. The default is a lightweight Linux VM made specifically to run the Docker daemon on Mac OS X. The VM runs completely from RAM, is a small ~24MB download, and boots in approximately 5s.\n\nA Dockerized VVV would still require a VM provider to be able to run on a Mac (or a Windows PC), as Docker itself requires Linux containers (LXC) to run. \nAdding the capability to run Docker containers within the Ubuntu base that VVV runs on by default may well have advantages and be a practical solution to various issues. What it isn't is \"free\" or likely to be more performant than simply running VVV directly.\nDoes that make sense?\n. Hmmm?

So, I tried ssh vagrant@127.0.0.1 -v and I actually got connected!\nSo, is the issue that Vagrant/VVV is setting the port incorrectly?\n. @jeremyfelt I'm on VirtualBox 4.2.24 and Vagrant 1.6.3\n. It's Vagrant, rather than VVV that gets the wrong IP/port for the SSH address (see this line) but I'm not sufficiently versed to know why that might be wrong, given that it appears from what I can tell to come from Virtualbox...

I ran sudo apt-get install php-xml.\nWhy is this required though? I've run phpunit in the bast (before VVV was on php7).\n. It was with core tests. I used WP CLI to scaffold the project. I followed the instructions from Pippin's tutorial here: https://pippinsplugins.com/unit-tests-wordpress-plugins-setting-up-testing-suite/\n. UPDATE: Updated Vagrant and VirtualBox to latest, same issue. Also, lots of DB backup issues when halting. No such file or directory on every backup.sql file.. I've already tried that, good idea though. \nAlso, through re-provisioning many times, manually deleting then provisioning things, and also manually uninstalling wp-cli and provisioning, I've alleviated that error it seems.\nI do, however, have another issue... All of the default domains (src.wordpress-develop.dev, etc) go to the main vvv.dev screen. I've even tried manually clearing the hosts file and then reloading vagrant, nothing works.. Great! Thanks Lorelei. No idea how this issue popped up initially, but it seems to be fine now.. @LoreleiAurora yes I am. Ah yes, thanks for the info. Anything? I can't use my default setup until this is fixed :(. I have no idea what fixed it, I provisioned again, for about the 5th time, and now it's working.. Steps I just took:\n\nAdded these to my utilities section in vvv-custom.yml:\n```\ntrusted-hosts\ntls-ca\n```\n\n\nRan vagrant reload --provision (provision finished with no errors)\nSSH into server\nRan xdebug_on\nChecked http://vvv.test/phpinfo/ and xdebug is not present\nRan sudo phpenmod xdebug in server\nRepeated step 5 with same result, no xdebug\n\nI know there's a million and one environmental variables, so it's crazy hard to find the issue... but do you have any other ideas? Been searching the internet desperately for 4 hours now and nothing. I even tried to use apt-get to install php-xdebug, but it says it's already installed (even though it doesn't show as a php module in the list I sent in the other issue). Version: PHP 7.2.7-1+ubuntu14.04.1+deb.sury.org+1 (cli) (built: Jun 22 2018 09:13:37)\nIt worked within the past few days. I believe I did pull a new version of VVV between it working and not working. I was on master. After it stopped working I tried develop branch.\nBoth of those files do exist in those directories.. Just wanted to update you that xdebug is loading again.\nI do not know what made it work again. This was a bizarre fluke... But it is loaded now.. Oh yeah... mailcatcher ALSO doesn't work all the sudden..... \ud83d\ude06 \nThe only thing that happened between yesterday and today is a computer restart (which I had already tried as a solution yesterday with no luck). I didn't git pull. I don't know if I should open a new issue, but I am still having issues with this.\nWhen I initially boot up the machine, xdebug is not loaded. I ssh into the machine and run xdebug_on, but it doesn't do anything. xdebug still does not load.

Thanks for the info!\nI changed the Vagrantfile back to default and added that code to the vvv-custom.yml file. I made the IP 192.168.51.0. I then ran vagrant up --provision.\nIt was able to provision, but now every single local site just shows \"It works!\"\n. I've never used another local environment on my machine (to my knowledge), so I'm guessing it wouldn't be that, though I can try to check deeper.\nWhen I try to visit the IP in my browser, it does not load:\n\nI arbitrarily set the IP to something similar. I do not have much of any knowledge about local IP protocols, so I figured I'd make it different, but close. I can try a different one if you think it could help. I assumed 1.2.3.4 was just an example?\n. Not sure if this helps, but I ran a port scan on that IP and got this:\n. Well, the only change between working for 2 years and now is I got a new router. I suspect this because if you look at the original output I shared, it blames my ethernet adapter (I have a USB - Ethernet for a wired direct to the ~~modem~~ ROUTER)\nBridged Network Address: '192.168.50.0'\nHost-only Network 'en6: Apple USB Ethernet Adapter': '192.168.50.0'\nSorry for my naivety, but can I destroy my VM and not lose all of my data?. Thank you both for providing more info and looking into this.\nIt is crazy odd that an Apache server would be present, as I've only ever used Vagrant with VVV. But, crazier things have happened.\nI changed my router IP to 192.168.0.100 (from 192.168.50.1) and set Vagrant back to the default IP of 192.168.50.4 and reprovisioned. The IP conflict disappeared, but I still only see \"It works!\" on every site.\nI then tried changing the Vagrant IP to 10.8.7.6 and reprovisioned, and I still only see \"It works!\". I'm a bit stumped as to what to try now.... Hold on, I just ran vagrant reload with no changes it is now working...\nI have no idea why, but it is working on that 10.8.7.6 IP. Thanks again for all the help!. Hey there,\nSo, since changing the IP, xdebug doesn't want to work. I am able to get it turned on, as it shows all of the settings and whatnot in vvv.dev/phpinfo, but projects that used to work with breakpoints just fine are no longer working.\nI attempted to changexdebug.remote_host within xdebug.ini to the new IP and re-provision, but it still does not want to work...\nAny ideas?. Yes, I have been using vvv.test, I mis-typed. Whoops. I'll give this a shot! Thank you for the reply.. In PHP Storm I actually never enter the IP, I just enter mysite.test with either port 80 or 443 (it typically auto detects).\nI tried entering the manual IP that comes through phpinfo(), and it still will not connect anymore.\nI am calling phpinfo() right in my custom server to make sure it all lines up.

Yes. My team and I use WP Migrate DB Pro daily with vagrant. We haven't used the media file add-on but don't see why that wouldn't work either. \nAronwp\n. @cfoellmann that would be perfect.

    "jonathan-dejong": "Hi Aron, \nSounds interesting.. Is there a restriction to how many reserved domains you can have with a paid account? Can you for example discontinue a domain in order to be able to select a new one? \n(Imagine that you're working on say 5 projects at a time which gets replaced by new ones regularly) \n. I didn't check via SSH if that's what you're asking but it was an VVV I've setup many months ago which had run all the time before that. Like I said a vagrant reload did fix it but I'm not sure what the difference is to doing a vagrant destroy and up :) \n. +1 on this. VVV and vagrant is awesome but now that I've got 20+ projects running provisioning is very slow. Luckily I of course don't have to provision every day but it sort of takes away the \"quick start\" of a new project. \n. following\n. It seems it can't even use vagrant ssh from within the bash file? \n. Yeah but if I want to run it as the vagrant user?\nSo you mean that vvv-init.sh already runs inside vagrant as the vagrant user? \nSorry for being daft.. I'm relatively new to the command line and server world :) \n. Alright thanks for clearing that up for me @cfoellmann \n. So no feedback at all on this?? I would've thought it'd be a nice touch if it works :) \n. Hi guys,\nSorry for possibly being unclear. I'm not asking wether you can add this to VVV.\nI'm just asking if people smarter than me see an issue in us doing this for our own installation?\nLike possible permissions problems or maybe just bad practice.\n@topdown that package sort of does it but we've got a lot of customisation ourselves in these files so it won't do. It would just be another dependency that we've tweaked ourselves. \n. Hi guys,\nSorry for possibly being unclear.

It would just be another dependency that we've tweaked ourselves. \n. So did a bit more digging and found that the output from vagrant provision is on row 766 in vvv/provision/provision.sh (if it's not been moved around.. not sure I run the latest version). \nI'm not well versed in bash etc. and not sure wether it actually adds anything but it looks to me like it just echoes to terminal..?\n```\nParse any vvv-hosts file located in www/ or subdirectories of www/\n# for domains to be added to the virtual machine's host file so that it is\n  # self aware.\n  #\n  # Domains should be entered on new lines.\n  echo \"Cleaning the virtual machine's /etc/hosts file...\"\n  sed -n '/# vvv-auto$/!p' /etc/hosts > /tmp/hosts\n  mv /tmp/hosts /etc/hosts\n  echo \"Adding domains to the virtual machine's /etc/hosts file...\"\n  find /srv/www/ -maxdepth 5 -name 'vvv-hosts' | \\\n  while read hostfile; do\n    while IFS='' read -r line || [ -n \"$line\" ]; do\n      if [[ \"#\" != ${line:0:1} ]]; then\n        if [[ -z \"$(grep -q \"^127.0.0.1 $line$\" /etc/hosts)\" ]]; then\n          echo \"127.0.0.1 $line # vvv-auto\" >> \"/etc/hosts\"\n          echo \" * Added $line from $hostfile\"\n        fi\n      fi\n    done < \"$hostfile\"\n  done\n``\n. @lkwdwrd Thanks for some clarification..\nSo when I have a vvv-hosts file present it works because the hostsupdater runs onvagrant provision` but before our provision script? Because if there is a manually created vvv-hosts file it works. \nIs there a reason why it would need to run before the provision script? If it's only task is to add entries to the external machine it seems it could just as well run after the provision script.\nI'm not really keen on piling on more tools to a workflow that already works great for us just for this caveat. We've also customized the provisioning to work for us with composer loading in private repos etc. \n. Yeah. Sorry if I sounded snarky :) I know they're separate projects but like you I'm not much of a rubyist so I figured I throw out the question. Now I got your two cents and it sounds like I'll be keeping the vvv-hosts file. No biggie!\n. I noticed my mailcatcher stopped working as well. So I did a vagrant destroy and on up this now also occurs for me. And even when successful after a loooong time mailcatcher does not work :/. @kraftner thank you! Was looking for something like that but couldn't find anything (my googlefu was not strong enough). The fix in that thread did solve my issue (with mailcatcher).. Can confirm that this works. . ",

I've determined I can't set a port as low as 80 for my Virtual Machine on the network.  Instead, I use this configuration line in my Vagrantfile that sets the webserver to listen on port 8080.\nconfig.vm.network \"forwarded_port\", guest: 80, host: 8080\nand then on my host machine (i.e. in Terminal NOT SSHing into the vagrant Virtual Machine) I run\n$ sudo ipfw add 100 fwd 127.0.0.1,8080 tcp from any to any 80 in\nwhich forwards port 80 to port 8080.\nWhen done with VVV, this port forwarding can be removed with \nsudo ipfw flush\nNote: It appears, ipfw is deprecated in OS X Mavericks and pfctl should be used instead.\n.

As @CNSam pointed out in #449, ipfw is not installed by default in OS X 10.10 Yosemite.  I've updated these notes to use pfctl.\n. I've written about my experience with setting this behavior up at http://salferrarello.com/vagrant-vvv-setup-wordpress/\n. @grappler I've got a write up at http://salferrarello.com/vagrant-vvv-setup-wordpress/ about the steps I took to get VVV running on my Mac with wildcard rules on port 80 of the machine's primary IP address, perhaps that might help.  Not really sure about getting it running on Windows.\n. Thanks for pointing this out @CNSam, I haven't upgraded to Yosemite yet.  Looks like we need to use pfctl instead.\nI think the following should do the trick.  I'm working on integrating these lines into my writeup and fork\nAdd Port Forwarding ( 80 => 8080 )\necho \"rdr pass on lo0 inet proto tcp from any to any port 80 -> 127.0.0.1 port 8080\" | sudo pfctl -ef -\nRemove Port Forwarding\nsudo pfctl -F all -f /etc/pf.conf\n. @CNSam\nI'm not sure whether you pointing out these two lines\ndefault: 80 => 8080 (adapter 1)\ndefault: 22 => 2222 (adapter 1)\nor the repeated line\ndefault: Warning: Remote connection disconnect. Retrying...\nI don't see either one of these as a problem.\n1.  It is kind of weird but the Guest OS (ubuntu) port 80 forwards to the Host OS (OS X) port 8080 and the same for port 22.  We then add rules to OS X using pfctl that forwards the Host OS port 80 to the Host OS port 8080 (which connects it to the guest OS).\n2.  I see this warning a lot of times as the Guest OS (ubuntu) is booting up.  Eventually, I connect.\nI'm not running Yosemite so I'm not sure if there is another problem but on Mavericks, this is working for me.\n. @CNSam I'm not sure what is causing your issue.  I'd double check the Guest machine is running.  I'm using VirtualBox so I can see both the status in the left column and the Preview window in the right column.  Beyond that, I don't know.\nFor reference, I'm using Vagrant 1.6.3 and VirtualBox 4.3.14\nI've got a couple of other devs that have used my fork with my settings https://github.com/salcode/vvv/tree/salcode but they're both on Mavericks.  I don't have anyone using it on Yosemite so I can't make any promises.  Sorry I can't be of more help.\n. Great to hear, @CNSam\n. @CNSam I wanted to give you an update in case you had this problem as well.  While port forwarding was working for 127.0.0.1 when accessing via the IP assigned by the network (e.g. 192.168.1.101) port forwarding was not working.\nI believe the issue was the port forwarding was setup for localhost only and needs to be setup for the network interfaces, as well.\nI've posted my updated settings both for command line and for within your Vagrantfile using vagrant triggers at http://salferrarello.com/mac-pfctl-port-forwarding/.\nAs of now, the command line version I have working is:\necho \"\nrdr pass on lo0 inet proto tcp from any to self port 80 -> 127.0.0.1 port 8080\nrdr pass on en0 inet proto tcp from any to any port 80 -> 127.0.0.1 port 8080\nrdr pass on en1 inet proto tcp from any to any port 80 -> 127.0.0.1 port 8080\n\" | sudo pfctl -ef -\n.

This would have to be updated whenever your IP address changes.\nWiki Update\nIf you want to take a first pass at a wiki page based on your recent experiences, I'm sure others would appreciate the guidance.\n. ## Dynamic Hostname Plugin Admin Notice\nYes, the Dynamic Hostname plugin asks you to define WP_HOME in wp-config.php.  If I understand correctly, this is to define the official version of the site url and then dynamic hostname works on top of that.\nI have never set those values in wp-config.php and other than the warning I've yet to suffer any consequences from this.\nVVV out of the Box\nYou can use the public network option out of the box. You'll still need to solve the hostname issue with one of the options listed above (but by dealing with it directly in wp-config.php you could make the argument, it is out-of-the-box).\n@jpry has a great writeup on how to use the public network option at http://webdevstudios.com/2015/08/04/how-to-view-a-locally-developed-website-devices/\nand he finally helped me understand how to properly use the public_network option in #566\nforwarded_port vs public_network\npublic_network\n\nDoes not require an additional utility (pfctl), which may not be available on all systems\nhas the benefit of a shorter Customfile\n\n```\nSet up with a Public network\nconfig.vm.network :public_network\n```\nforwarded_port\n\nEliminates having to log into your Vagrant box to determine the correct IP address\nDoes not require a vagrant reload when your IP address changes (I've heard from others this is necessary with public_network but I've not tested this claim)\n\nIf I were using a Windows machine, I'd use public_network rather than figure out how to do the port forwarding but since I'm on a Mac and I've got my Customfile dialed-in, I prefer Port Forwarding.\n. @grappler How are you setting up your custom sites? \nUsing a Modified VVV Site Wizard\nI'm using the VVV Site Wizard and I've modified it to include support for an xip.io url.  Modified version of VVV Site Wizard for xip.io Support.\nYou can see my modifications in this commit 6f4236\nManually\nIn the custom site nginx config, I'm adding a regular expression server_name.\nExample\nOriginal server_name without xip.io\nserver_name  genesis.dev;\nModified server_name with xip.io\nserver_name  genesis.dev ~^genesis\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\\.xip\\.io$;\nI hope this helps.\n.

Updated to the latest version of VVV on master\n2.  Made the changes you listed\n\n3.  Booted up (with vagrant up --provision)\nChose 1) en0: Wi-Fi (AirPort)\n\n4.  Attempted to go to http://10.0.1.6/\nThis is my machine's local IP address, as determined by ipconfig getifaddr en0\nResult:\nThis webpage not available\n\nI also attempted http://vvv.dev/, which did not work (which makes sense since it is mapped to 192.168.50.4).\nShould I be trying to visit a different IP address for the URL?\nCan you clarify how you got it to work?\n. @JPry \nHa ha, brilliant.  This works for me on http://10.0.1.4/\nThank you for helping me understand that the virtual machine gets a new (separate) IP address assigned to it.  This was my misconception that was creating such a road block.\nIt is interesting that the IP address is on eth1 even though I'm accessing the network via WiFi (eth0) but I assume this is because from the perspective of the virtual machine, it thinks it is accessing a wired connection (which is all part of the VirtualBox magic).  I apologize for all these notes but I anticipate they may be helpful to me (or others) in the future.\n\n:+1: on using the Customfile for your modifications so you can update VVV without worrying about changes\nNow I need to decide if I'm going to move away from my port forwarding solution in favor of this public IP solution.  Am I correct you prefer this public IP solution?\n. @JPry \nI think the port forwarding option has this same drawback\n\nIf you're on public Wifi (vs. being at your own home/office), then anyone else can get to your vagrant too.\n\nWith port forwarding, I do not need to vagrant reload or vagrant reload --provision when changing Wifi access points.  I almost always vagrant suspend and rarely reload my Vagrant instance.\nThis is a deciding factor for me that will keep me using Port Forwarding.\nI'm guessing there may be a command you can run to update the vagrant public IP (either from within the Virtual machine via vagrant ssh or from the host machine command line) but I don't know what it is.  This would put the Public IP and Port Forwarding more on the same level in my eyes.\n. #337 discusses adding Mailcatcher, which if merged in and made the default would prevent this from happening.\nFor the time being, these notes might be helpful (and I'm sure I'll refer to them, as well)\nViewing Emails\nsudo less /var/spool/mail/vagrant\nDeleting Emails\n\nsudo vim /var/spool/mail/vagrant (or sudo nano /var/spool/mail/vagrant if you don't like vim)\ndelete all the lines in the file\nsave the file and quit the editor\n. In #566 @JPry provides some clarification on using the Public Network option.  Re-reading Various Networking Configurations in VVV I see this information was covered but I needed to be hit over the head with it explicitly, which is my own short-coming but I thought I'd mention it here in case it helps others.\n. I prefer using xip.io for accessing sites from other machines on my network (though ngrok can be used as well).  You might also want to check out #263 for a lot of discussion on the topic.\n\nMy notes and the specific Customfile I use are available at http://salferrarello.com/vagrant-vvv-setup-wordpress/\n. Your permalinks may be set to the default http://local.wordpress.dev/?p=123, in which case going to http://local.wordpress.dev/page-does-not-exist/ will display the home page (not the 404 page).\nI'd look at http://local.wordpress.dev/wp-admin/options-permalink.php and if you are set to the default change it to Post name.\n\n. I've been looking into this.  I'm not sure how best to tackle this so I'm going to put some of my notes here in case anyone else has any insights or recommendations.\nI've not determined a way to access the Vagrant configuration from within the Guest machine.  Ideally, I'd like to determine if the config.vm.network :public_network setting were in place, since if it is not, we would skip displaying any information about a public IP address.\nI'd also like to read the private network IP from the Vagrant configuration if there is one (e.g. config.vm.network :private_network, ip: \"192.168.50.4\").  Knowing this information would help me exclude it when I extract the public IP address from ifconfig.\n. ## Current state\nI'm listing the IP addresses returned by /sbin/ifconfig however this results in addresses that do not resolve.  Right now the output looks like this for me:\n\nIn this case http://192.168.0.101/ is the publicly accessible IP address.  I'd like to mark it as the public IP but I'm not clever enough to determine this from within the Guest OS.\nNext Steps\nMy thought is we could make AJAX calls to each of the IP addresses and determine if they return a page containing Varying Vagrant Vagrants Dashboard in the title tag.  If they do contain that title tag, we mark the URL in some way.\nThis feels over engineered but is currently my best thought.  I thought I'd include these notes for two reasons:\n1.  To remind me of my game plan for when future me sits down to write this\n2.  To give others an opportunity to point out problems with this approach or a more elegant solution\n. ## Current state\nI'm listing the IP addresses returned by /sbin/ifconfig however this results in addresses that do not resolve.

To give others an opportunity to point out problems with this approach or a more elegant solution\n. @topdown thank you for the suggestion but I don't think this will work.\nWhen I tested outputting $_SERVER['SERVER_ADDR'], the value varied based on the IP address used to load the page.\n\nIn this scenario using the public network option, I get the following values when I use these different URLs.\n- http://vvv.dev/, displays 192.168.50.4\n- http://192.168.50.4/, displays 192.168.50.4\n- http://192.168.0.101/, displays 192.168.0.101\nSince 192.168.0.101 is the public IP, this is the IP we want to display regardless of which URL is used to access the page.\nTo review the goal of this patch, when someone uses the public network option, I'd like them to be presented with the public IP address without having to hunt for it.  Specifically, I'd like them to be able to visit the default page and see it listed there.\n. I wanted to keep this first pass simple.\nI think it makes sense to filter out the eth0 adapter since on my Mac with Virtualbox, the relevant IP addresses are always assigned to eth1 or higher.\n. @jeremyfelt Great, I'd love another set of eyes on this and some fresh ideas.  Thanks.\n. I've updated this PR to output a list of the IPs and then test each one with an AJAX call.\nWhile this will detect localhost (127.0.0.1), it does not detect your local IP address (e.g. 192.168.50.1).  \nThe User's local IP address is particularly relevant if you're using Port Forwarding rather than the Public Network option.  It appears you can detect your local IP address from the browser in Chrome and Firefox, see http://net.ipcalf.com/, which would be great but adds complexity.  I think it makes sense to get this base functionality first and then look at adding local IP address detection in a future commit.\n. ",
    "koppenhoefer": "I'm late to the game,.. but I find that ngrok solves this problem for me...: local ipads and even network-remote ipads (different country) can access my non-default sites :) It is slow however.\n@westonruter NGROK worked for me to target a domainsite rather than the vvv default,.. by specifying the -host-header=\"mysite.dev\" option. So Nginx answered with mysite.dev rather than the default even though I was using the randomised ngrok url. I didn't need to do 'vagrant share' to reach my site from my ipad. Too bad I can't do something like '%vagrant share -hostname=mysite.dev' so that clients accessing the randomish url get an automatic rewrite of the Host header :-)\n@aronwp So with -host-header option, you don't really need a paid account.\n. @salcode Sure! Note that I used vv create to generate that separate wordpress site in my vvv... for a site 'tangolausanne.dev'.\nthis worked for me:\nngrok http tangolausanne.dev:80 -host-header=tangolausanne.dev\nMy local ipads can visit the site,.. and even remote clients (different countries) get access. And there's no need to use 'vagrant share' for this. Slow though.\nthis worked for me but not as expected:\nUsing your Customfile solution and visiting tangolausanne.dev.192.168.50.4.xip.io did allow the host machine to access the the vv default site,.. but not the intended tangolausanne.dev site,.. The ipad couldn't get any response at all using that url; Unexpectedlyy, on the host, this fails: http://localhost:8080 whereas this works: http://localhost:80. Of course, from the iPad I can reach 192.168.0.42:80 (the hosts ip) and from the iPad I can reach 192.168.0.42:8080...  but in all those cases nginx serves up the default folder rather than the tangolausanne.dev folder in the VM :( The solution sas to use this instead: tangolausanne.192.168.50.4.xip.io (that's right... remove the 'dev'). It also works to visit the default wordpress site (local.wordpress.dev).... using local.wordpress.192.168.50.4.xip.io  (that's right... remove the 'dev'). Of course, none of this gives you access to remote users from outside your local network.\nand just to be complete...\nUsing vagrant share works for every device... local or remote... but only to access the default folder configured in nginx. The trick of setting that to the hosted site does indeed work (ie. to /srv/www/tangolausanne). And @zbtirrell's solution with Squid (and gui Squidman) also worked for me.\n. ",

I've been attempting to piece this together from all the various tutorials out there, and have still not had success. No matter what I do, I end up with an unstyled version of the site with broken links when viewing via the xip.io address on my phone (for testing).\nIf I install the Root Relative URL's plugin, this fixes some things including the broken stylesheet reference and the links, however it also breaks other plugin functionality.

Will open a new issue to get this convo going as well...\n. Gotcha, will try, thanks. One question - it seems that this plugin is\nmentioned in some tutorials but not others. Same goes for the Root Relative\nURL's plugin.

Try downloading a fresh copy of WordPress and replacing the wp-admin and wp-includes directory. My guess is the download was interrupted on setup.\n. Hello @jeremyfelt,\nThanks for the reply. I have been using VV for creating sites for some time.\nI have not compared its provision script to the default one in VVV.\nWhat I do know at this point is I have a running VVV again.\nI had to delete the box and all the data folders, eg .vagrant stuff, and update VirtualBox which I have had to do before.\nThen started fresh, which you can see in the last half of my command logs above.\nI still had to run provision, halt, etc.. multiple times to get past the errors to get it to be fully setup.\nAfter that I re-setup VV changing the paths to the new VVV location, then stripped its provision-custom.sh down to minimal required when creating a new site and running provision. It has no outside calls, no update checks or anything in it, including removing WordPress SVN.\nhttps://gist.github.com/topdown/edae3d23a3944c484530fa56740f2482\nI'm hoping that with this custom provision script I am using this all goes away and I can only update when I know I have time to deal with potential issues.\nI couldn't possible list the issues I have has, since its pretty much most of them here in the issues list that I have read through and tried over the last year. You name it, grunt not found, mysql command does not exist, permission issues, etc...\nThe issues are inconsistent which is the biggest problem.\n2 months ago when I was in a jam like this I did this to get back up and running.\nhttps://gist.github.com/topdown/6ee7c237b300a0cda03717ccc69599cd\nWhich I found by fixing each issue to only get another and kept going until it was running.\nThen copied my commands to that gist. I can work through the errors usually and get it running, but its frustrating when your on the job and trying to work.\nAlso and biggest fear that I have with VVV, are a lot of people less involved in tech/command-line/programming that walk away from VVV because of issues like this that was just to much for them.\nIf you are on a sketchy internet connection (out in the sticks) like me it can make things unstable for updates and procedural installing processes. IE. internet hickups while installing grunt or updating mysql, etc...\nI thing one thing that would be a start is a bolded area in the install docs and maybe even the \"ended with errors\" statement is to mention running vagrant provision multiple times can help fix some errors.\n. I was on the original repo, I think 10up before VVV became its own Org.\nI know it was not this one because I changed the git config manually to update the repo. Then when you announced PHP7 I was confused as to why I could not see it and discovered that there was no redirect on the old repo which I thought was automatic on GitHub.\nSwitching repos with the same box and everything blew up then, big time.\nOnce I got that sorted I was good for a while but still could not get the develop branch working here and had to patch things with my gist instructions in the other reply. So I was on master with PHP5.\nYesterday after replacing everything and starting over I am now on develop with PHP7.\nBut like I said, it took multiple provisions to get it working.\nToday I did some reading through provision scripts and discovered that the updating issue is a shared one between VVV, VV and Flip. They all do it. apt get update and apt get install\nhttps://github.com/bradp/VVV-Provision-Flipper/blob/master/scripts/sample#L160  to \nhttps://github.com/bradp/VVV-Provision-Flipper/blob/master/scripts/sample#L164\nThe package_install function https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/blob/develop/provision/provision.sh#L212\nAnd I think VV just uses the default provision script unless a custom one exists.\nOn top of these package updates, which are terrible most of the time because of hangups or whatever there is the default WP install updates that happen every time which can break things if they hang and don't complete then the provision exits with errors.\nI think the default setup for the provisioner should have more flags and functions.\nSomething like\n```\nAbsolute basics\nvagrant provision\nSystem updates\nvagrant provision --update\nUpdate default WP installs\nvagrant provision --wp\nRun all for install\nvagrant provision --install\n```\nThis would give it separation and speed for daily stuff.\nIt would also make things less likely to break in a daily work flow, but still allow updating if a person decides they want to tackle any issues that may arise.\n. What about adding a Yaml linter to validate these YAML files?\nhttps://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint\nWould hopefully lower support issues/questions when this PR is rolled out.\nJust a thought.. In the projects root www/your_project_name/ there should be a file vvv-init.sh\nYou will have to edit the first parts of the file\nExample,\nThe typical setup looks like this\nif [ ! -d \"htdocs/wp-admin\" ]; then\n    echo 'Installing WordPress (release version) in kyevans/htdocs...'\n    if [ ! -d \"./htdocs\" ]; then\n        mkdir ./htdocs\n    fi\n    cd ./htdocs\nA custom setup would look like this\nif [ ! -d \"public/wp/wp-admin\" ]; then\n    echo 'Installing WordPress (release version) in wpstarter/public...'\n    if [ ! -d \"./public ]; then\n        mkdir ./public\n    fi\n    cd ./public\nNOTE: these are just parts and not complete!\nIf you make a change like htdocs to public then you have to also edit the wp-cli.yml in your projects root to have the correct path.\n. Sure, an environment variable would be fine as it should be accessible by PHP. . @tomjn I have never been able to stay on top of the latest VVV as it was always an issue getting \n the latest working. Which is tough to chew on when you have a working version.\nThis was also the issue of me slowing down on my Dashboard repo as I have never successfully been able to get the new version of VVV running to fix the issues.\nEither way, thanks for adding the version file. \ud83d\udc4d .

Setting up webpack-dev-server maybe?\nThere is: https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-sync-webpack-plugin\nI will try to implement this with webpack and post back the gist with the settings if it works. \n. I can confirm, the above works with webpack 3 :) Just follow the instructions on the link above. \nFirst you need to enable port forwarding and public networks in your Vagrantfile\n~~~rb\n  config.vm.network :public_network\n  config.vm.network \"forwarded_port\", guest: 80, host: 8080, auto_correct: true\n~~~\nAdd the browser-sync and browser-sync-webpack-pluginwith npm install --save-dev PACKAGE, which should add them in the devDependencies key in package.json.\nThen in your webpack.config.jsadd\n~~~js\n  const BrowserSyncPlugin = require('browser-sync-webpack-plugin');\nmodule.exports = [\n    // context, entry etc. goes here...\n    plugins: [\n      new BrowserSyncPlugin({\n        host: 'localhost',\n        port: 3000,\n        proxy: 'localhost:8080'\n      })\n    ]\n  ];\n~~~\nThen just start webpack with --watch and that's it. Works like a charm :)\nYou can check the full config here: https://github.com/infinum/wp-boilerplate/blob/master/webpack.config.js. Yeah, people should use Browsersync for testing the site on other devices.. I tried upgrading to 16.04.3 LTS with do-release-upgrade within the vagrant ssh, and it broke the vagrant. So you should probably add some kind of warning not to do that :D \nOn the bright side I reordered my folders nicely this time, so at least there is something gained xD. I had the backup of the databases and config files, and all the client work is on repositories, so nothing lost ;) \nAs for upgrading, I didn't think of changing the ubuntu in Vagrantfile (tbh not sure what to change it from ubuntu/trusty64 to ... ?).. I have this as well. When I run it from /vagrant/config/homebin/xdebug_on I see 2 processes being run:\nsh\nphp7.1-fpm stop/waiting\nphp7.1-fpm start/running, process 13101\nphp7.2-fpm stop/waiting\nphp7.2-fpm start/running, process 13120\nI added php71 as a utility but my php -v throws\nsh\nPHP 7.2.5-1+ubuntu14.04.1+deb.sury.org+1 (cli) (built: May  5 2018 06:17:01) ( NTS )\nCopyright (c) 1997-2018 The PHP Group\nZend Engine v3.2.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2018 Zend Technologies\n    with Zend OPcache v7.2.5-1+ubuntu14.04.1+deb.sury.org+1, Copyright (c) 1999-2018, by Zend Technologies\n    with Xdebug v2.6.0, Copyright (c) 2002-2018, by Derick Rethans\n. Thanks for the explanation. I ended up installing Local by Flywheel, it's ok for the testing purposes, but this will help as well.. I am working on a project where I need to parse yaml to json, and for yaml I think you would need http://pecl.php.net/ library. This could be added by default in the vvv. The alternative is this: https://github.com/mustangostang/spyc. \nI still need to create a provision script that I can use as utility for my local development (pecl utility).\nBut couldn't adding a custom site be achieved with a bash script? What comes to mind is:\n\nuser has to input data in the input fields in the dashboard\nthis data is used by the bash script that does the following:\nsee if vvv-custom.yml exists\nif it does locate the line before utilities and append the new site with the prefilled data using find and sed\nif it doesn't, just copy the vvv-config.yml and again append the new site like above\n\n\ncreate necessary folders and provision scripts in it (vvv-init.sh and vvv-nginx.conf with the data from the input fields)\nreprovision vagrant. > It isn't, the dashboard currently uses a library to read YAML in:\nwww/default/dashboard/php/yaml.php\n\n\n\nThis is some kind of a fork of a spyc library?\nI'm all for site configs, wasn't aware of all the stuff that will happen automatically with provisioning. Would site configs be a separate yaml files or should they need to be added to the vvv-custom.yml file?. Ok, I managed to add it, but now it says that my certificate is expired by two days. I'll see how I can fix this. I found the issue. the password should have been empty.\nI am still a bit puzzled how does this work exactly.. I think those are warnings since once you provision vagrant, it works fine (at least for me).. Well currently I'm working on a multisite and it's a rather heavy site, so I wanted to see the server activity on save, and compare it with logs, to see if I can find any bottlenecks, so that I can fix them, before the site goes to production.. Will try that. Thanks!. Will try to add this. Cheers!.

You mean removing it? Well, sure I guess I don't need it. I was looking at this as an example: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-utilities/blob/master/php56/provision.sh\nI noticed that, when provisioning, for the $FOLDER variable it says:\n\n/vagrant/provision/resources/browscap/browscap/provision.sh: line 17: /etc/php/7.0/mods-available/: Is a directory\n\nAnd for the $FILE\n\n/vagrant/provision/resources/browscap/browscap/provision.sh: line 18: /php_browscap.ini: No such file or directory\n\nShould I actually do cp \"php_browscap.ini\" \"$FOLDER/php_browscap.ini\" ?\nEDIT: I added the touch command to create an empty file to copy to. I hope this solves the issue.. Sorry to bother, I would just like to know if I'm on a right track.\nI think I need to change the php.ini to point to the browscap in the mods-available. So I'm trying with\nsh\nsed -i \"s/;browscap = extra\\/browscap.ini/browscap = \\/etc\\/php\\/$PHP_VER\\/mods-available\\/php_browscap.ini/g\" \"/etc/php/$PHP_VER/fpm/php.ini\"\nChanging this\nsh\n[browscap]\n; http://php.net/browscap\n;browscap = extra/browscap.ini\nTo this \nsh\n[browscap]\n; http://php.net/browscap\nbrowscap = /etc/php/7.0/mods-available/php_browscap.ini\nBut when I reprovisioned nothing changed, so I tried manually and I got the permission denied notice.\nSo my guess is that I need to do this as root, but I'm not sure how would I do that when provisioning (sudo would ask for a password).\nAny advice on how to proceed?. Yeah, I have been doing that - change few things and hit vagrant reload --provision :) I will place some more checks in place, and try with sed.\nThanks!. Ok, so I think this is working - the script is copied, and added in php.ini and on the site that is using get_browser() I see no errors so I think this is all good.\nhttps://github.com/dingo-d/browscap-vvv-utility\nThanks for the help :). I tweaked few things\nIn Vagrantfile I've enabled config.vm.network :public_network, so that I can test my sites on mobile via browsersync.\nAnd I have custom sites set up in my vvv-custom.yml, plus additional browsecap utility that I've written as a provision script.\nWhen developing I use webpack for bundling my files, and I commit plugins and theme to the git with .gitignore looking roughly like this:\n```\nProject Specific\nwp-content/themes/theme_name/skin/public\nWordpress files\nwp-admin\nwp-includes\n/license.txt\n/readme.html\n/wp-activate.php\n/index.php\n/wp-blog-header.php\n/wp-comments-post.php\n/wp-config-sample.php\n/wp-config.php\n/wp-cron.php\n/wp-links-opml.php\n/wp-load.php\n/wp-login.php\n/wp-mail.php\n/wp-settings.php\n/wp-signup.php\n/wp-trackback.php\n/xmlrpc.php\n.htaccess\nrobots.txt\nContent\n!wp-content/plugins/\nTheme\nwp-content/*\n!wp-content/mu-plugins/\n!wp-content/plugins/\n!wp-content/themes/\n/wp-content/themes/index.php\nIgnore these plugins from the core\nwp-content/plugins/hello.php\nwp-content/plugins/akismet/\n/wp-content/plugins/index.php\nIgnore specific themes\nwp-content/themes/twenty*/\nProject dev files\n/vendor\n/node_modules/\n```\nwhich resides in the public_html folder alongside the other .*rc files, package.json, wepack.config.js and composer.json among some others.\nwp-cli is also available when I'm inside vagrant folders.\nSo I really rarely need to go to the ssh. Oh and I'm on MacOS.\nI only re provision when I need to add a new site.\nSo far I'm extremely happy with VVV for development. . Cool :+1:. Thanks for the suggestions and explanations :)\n\n\nDividers would be set between each subfolder inside www folder. You could have wordpress folder with defaults, develop and meta for instance, then clients folder for your clients sites etc. Then the dividers would physically divide the boxes (better visibility). Currently they are stacked one after another.\nBut if you could customize the UI, and put all on separate tabs/pages then that would be good as well.\n\n\nAdditional links like login link for instance, or some other useful link (default REST endpoint or something like that).\nLabel/url pair would be a good way to add this.\n\n\n\nI'll look into the code you provided and see what I can customize, and if it looks/feels ok, I'll fork and create a PR :). Sure thing, thanks for the tips. The cron is working (tested), I'll just need to set up a log file and a way to notify me if cron fails. For the live site I'll let my devops work it out how it should work :). Yeah, the / worked, I needed to sort the mess I had in the www folder somehow. No special reason for not using local_dir and vm_dir. I'll try to set them up and reprovision and see how that goes.\nI didn't have the hostsupdater plugin installed. Once I did and I reprovisioned the sites started to work, but the clients.wordpress.test site is redirecting to the dev.wordpress.test site for some reason.\nI don't have any apps that should interfere with hosts file (it all worked before and I don't have any extra apps installed). The clients site is in the hosts file. And no errors, aside from warning not to run composer as a root.\nI'll try rewriting the vvv-custom.yml file, just to see if all will work out as it should.\nThanks for the help!. > I'd strongly recommend just using the custom site template as a base and forking it for any custom items you want\nYou mean storing it on a repo, and creating repo for each site or? The problem is that I use VVV for my local testing, my clients and for the company work, so I'm not sure that would work. Or just having empty repos that are used for sites creation? . :+1: I'll definitely give it a go. Ok, I scoured through core track, and it seems that there is an issue with PHPUnit v7\nhttps://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43218. Awesome! Thanks!. Ok, it seems to be working when I put the 127.0.0.1 for the host O.o \nI'll close the issue, but if anyone has an explanation as to why feel free to answer.... Well, I thought, since the Redis is on a virtual machine, that I need to use that IP so that I can communicate with it.. Cool, didn't know that. :+1:. The site works when I open it in my browser. I'll try to add the absolute path and reprovision again.. Nope, the /srv/www/my-blog folder when I ssh to vagrant is still empty.. Will check that out, thanks!. He he, turns out that I had forgotten to remove the empty folder in my vagrant-local folder.\nStill, it's odd that I cannot find the original installation inside vagrant.\nI'll close this and investigate it a bit more.. I updated my virtualBox, and VVV to 2.2.0-beta and I added one test, and now inside vagrant I get 1 minute testing time, and on my mac I get 7.1 seconds.\nBut I tried to disable Xdebug and the tests took 2.84 seconds inside vagrant O.o\nSo I guess Xdebug is the cause.\nI knew it slows down unit tests, but didn't know that the effect was this big. Granted, the code coverage won't be generated, but I think I can live with that.. If you have a test example case I can test on macOS (in and out of VVV), and I could try to set it up on my Windows machine (which might take a while since I haven't used that in a while...). If you have a test example case I can test on macOS (in and out of VVV), and I could try to set it up on my Windows machine (which might take a while since I haven't used that in a while...). Nope, tests are still slow for me. I've provisioned the 2-2-release using php71 utility, and when I go to vvv.test:1080 I get error connection refused.\nI went to vagrant ssh and started mailcatcher\nbash\nagrant@vvv:~$ mailcatcher\nStarting MailCatcher\n==> smtp://127.0.0.1:1025\n/usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-2.4.1@mailcatcher/gems/thin-1.5.1/lib/thin/server.rb:104: warning: constant ::Fixnum is deprecated\n==> http://127.0.0.1:1080\n*** MailCatcher runs as a daemon by default.

Currently, mailcatcher is not working for me.. Ok, seems like I had to do vagrant halt first and then vagrant up --provision.

I always recommend using Browsersync for cross-browser testing (config.vm.network :public_network uncommented ofc).\n\nAfter a simple setup (example here), just run npm start and work on any browser, mobile phone etc.. Oh, yeah, in that case, this is a big issue.. So I've added in Vagrantfile\n```sh\n  config.vm.provision \"shell\", inline: <<-SHELL\n# Set environment variables...\n  echo \"export TEST_ENV=development\" >> /etc/environment\n  SHELL\n```\nWhich works when I do printenv, but not when I do getenv('TEST_ENV').\nMy guess is that the /etc/php/7.2/fpm/php-fpm.conf gets rewritten on provision and I'm losing the clear_env = no which makes it unavailable for getenv().\nEDIT: \nWeird, I added the \nsh\n; Env variables\nclear_env = no\nenv[TEST] = 'test env var'\nTo my php-fpm.conf and the getenv('TEST') works.\nNow I need to figure out how to add this during provision.. You mean put the variables in the vvv-nginx.conf via location parameters?.

Would it be a good idea to add a branch besides a repo field when creating sites using custom site template?\n\nUse-case: \nSay you want to use the older version where you don't have Gutenberg installed. You have custom-site-template.git and in master branch you have latest WP, and you could add 4.9.8 branch where you'd set up that older version of WP is installed while provisioning.\nThat way you can reuse custom site template (one repo multiple branches).. How? I can only add git repo. I didn't see a branch key (or any mention of it).. So if I understood correctly, in my custom-site-template I'd create a 4.6.4 branch, and in there in the provisioner, I'd set the wp version in the provision.sh, right? I was thinking of something like that, it's just that I wasn't aware of the wp_type and wp_version (couldn't find anything about it in the docs). Isn't Node.js 10.x set to LTS? Why not updating to that version?. Ok, so I did sudo apt-get purge php7.* when I ssh'd to vagrant and after that, it looks like provisioning is working. It's still going on so I need to wait until it finishes, but so far no errors.. Ok, seems that did the trick. Weird bug.. I might have tried changing something inside the vvv, but I have probably made these changes a long time ago and forgot \ud83d\ude04 . ",

Ok, it was my fault. I must have missed the password input area after vagrant up. I've also uninstalled and reinstalled vagrant since I ran it with sudo and caused a whole mess of problems.\n. Hi Jeremy\nI actually do have a question regarding the best way to work with Vagrant in general -- not sure where to put this, so if this is the wrong area let me know and I'll move it:\nI'm not sure if I should be using one Vagrant VM as a setup for multiple WordPress sites or one VM per site, since destroying and having the config tailored to the site seems like a good idea (though more work in the long run). I've read places that using it as a MAMP replacement is defeating the purpose so I just wanted to get your opinion on the benefits of using it as a MAMP replacement, since that's really what the base VVV seems to be doing.\nBy using the Auto Site Setup (VVV as a scaffold) -- is that a way of still using VVV but on a per site VM basis?\nAlso, I have a VPS that I was thinking of setting up via Vagrant using it as a provider but I'm not sure if that's necessary. It seems like a good idea but would it make sense if my ideal workflow is:\n1) Build project on local machine using Vagrant\n2) Check code into a Git repo\n3) Capistrano to deploy to VPS\n4) Capistrano runs some Composer tasks to set up dependencies\n5) Capistrano also would ideally run an import for the SQL to the database for the site if a flag is set\nFor now, all the projects would be residing on one VPS, not a singular VPS per project, so would using Vagrant to set that up be overkill or would it be a good idea since it would 100% match my development environment?\n. Once again I think I've figured it out right after posting -\nI had a second VM running (the default one from the Vagrant docs that doesn't have anything except   Ubuntu running - no DB or anything as far as I'm aware).\nAnyway, I stopped that and the only reason I noticed was because I pulled up VirtualBox and saw it running still. Now my VVV install works fine. I guess this means I can only have one VM instance with Vagrant running at a time? This is another reason to have all the sites on one VM I suppose instead of a VM per site.\n. Thanks Jeremy -- I was trying to get going using Test Kitchen (which makes use of Chef Solo / Berkshelf) but I think I'll just stick to pure Vagrant with VVV for the moment. All that other stuff was a bit too much for me currently.\n. My issue turned out to be related to a sql dump I was importing and nothing to do with Vagrant or VVV\n. ",

Thanks for the reply, Simon! I think I was extremely tired when creating this issue. How vague! My question related more to configuring WP with a different wp-content folder during the provisioning process.\nHowever, I now see this isn't so necessary. I can just do so with Wordmove with pushing to production, or configure production manually. In any case - thank you!\n. +1, this is great\n. Any way I can help move this feature along? I'd also really love to be able to toggle the default sites on and off, hopefully before an initial vagrant up. It really grinds my gears having the default sites in there as they are now. They really should be provisioned by auto-site-setup like any other project you'd add.\n. Just shooting from the hip, but what about moving the entire root folder\nfrom vvv/www/ to vvv/disabled-sites/\nThen we'd just need some way to tell VVV not to load the db for sites in\nthat folder, right?\nAnother change I'd like to see is making the default WP installs optional.\nThat might take some work but I'm willing to do it in the near future.\nOn Thu Nov 20 2014 at 9:48:09 PM Travis Northcutt notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n@joeguilmette https://github.com/joeguilmette feel free to chip in with\na PR for this feature request.

I tried running the site on hhvm, locally, and saw little to no performance gains. Still seeing 30s load times.\n\nHere is the webgrind output.\n\n\n. Hah! It\u2019s not my site, so\u2026 Right. Anyway. We can agree it is a resource-intensive site, and with some fancy caching on production it actually loads surprisingly well. Locally you would expect a hit, managing all that php on every page load. However, you would not expect 1 minute load times. \nIn any case, I just now got performance into the realm of expectation.\nI enabled NFS and had to delete the owner and mount options from the drives. This got load times to 3.5s, which isn\u2019t great but all things considered is what you\u2019d expect. Enable HHVM via the lovely __hhvvvm got load times down to 2.5s which is just fine for me for a beast like this.\nMoral of the story? I see no reason not to have NFS enabled by default with VVV. It fails gracefully with Windows, and unless those owner provisions and mount options are terribly important (my VM runs fine so far without them), the performance gains are tremendous, especially for big sites like this.\n. Thanks! I'll read up on that.\nOn Wed, Oct 22, 2014 at 11:28 AM, Jeremy Felt notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nI don't remember - does W3TC store cache to disk? I could see that causing some issues with the speed of the \"shared\" drive in VirtualBox.\nAlso - be cautious of NFS due to some file caching issues.\nPossible related - a good writeup comparing filesystem performance in virtual machines.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/476#issuecomment-60035217\n. I've been running my VVV servers with NFS enabled and... There are indeed some 'ghost in the machine' caching errors with files. I've since solved some underlying memory based issues I was having with my MacBook and things now run swimmingly without NFS.\n\nThe strange issues I'd run in to were related to NFS caching. Changes to files not being seen by Vagrant, which can lead to some strange behavior, especially because it never happens consistently.\n. First thing would be to check out xdebug and see exactly what the site is waiting on.\nMy guess is your VM is running out of memory... When it hangs, run vagrant ssh and then free -tom. If you are indeed running in to memory consumption issues, you can edit your Vagrantfile and give your VM more memory.\nAnother thing to try is switching over your VM's file structure to NFS. I ran into some issues here and that solved them for me. But in the end, I just got rid of that beastly site and returned to vanilla VVV. In the future I'm looking forward to when we can turn sites on and off (apparently coming in 1.3). That way I can have one VVV install and toggle sites on and off for optimal performance.\n. Hmm... Are you using Yosemite? I had a RAM issue on my MBA where Yosemite\nwas choking itself to death.\nI installed Memory Clean and have it flush the RAM on OSX if it gets you\nless than 50mb... Solved a lot of issues I was having.\nOn Thu, Nov 20, 2014 at 9:30 PM Joel Worsham notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nThanks for your reply.\nI actually already modified my vagrant file to give it 1/4 of my system\nmemory (4gb), access to all processor cores (I think 8 virtual cores), and\nto use NFS.

Not entirely sure I understand the question.\n\nIf you're asking How do I version control my individual projects? the answer is: It depends.\nIf you use git to deploy WordPress sites, you probably want to run git init on your wp-content folder.\nIf you use git to version control your theme, and then another tool to deploy the rest of WordPress, you probably just want to run git init on your WordPress theme, and then vagrant ssh into Vagrant and run your deployment tool from inside the VM. You can take a look at my WordPress workflow here.\nLet me know if i can be of further help!\n. Well the gitignore file specifically excludes the project folders. Sure,\nyou could change that and then version control the whole thing on your own\nfork.\nBut why?\nWhy not:\n- Version control VVV\n- Version control your individual projects\nI can think of 20 reasons why you'd want to do it separate and no\ncompelling reasons why you'd to do it together.\nOn Fri, Nov 28, 2014 at 8:18 PM Allyson Alves de Souza \nnotifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHi @joeguilmette https://github.com/joeguilmette, thank you for your\nreply.\nI'll see your workflow.

I just tried it and it seems to work. But I think what @almhorn was trying to achieve was a little bit different from your setup.\nYou're moving the install to /wp, including wp-config.php and set this as the document root and then alias the wp-content from one level above.\nwp-content\n - themes\n - plugins\n - etc. \nwp\n - wp-admin\n - wp-includes\n - wp-config.php\n - etc.\nWhat @almhorn (and me too) seem to be trying is something like this:\nwp-config.php\nwp-content\n - themes\n - plugins\n - etc. \nwp\n - wp-admin\n - wp-includes\n - etc.\nSo the document root is still at /.\nI've come to realize that this needs some changes to the rewrite rules, something along those lines:\nif (!-e $request_filename) {\n   rewrite ^(/wp-.*\\.php)$ /wp$1;\n   rewrite ^(/wp-.*) /wp$1;\n}\nBut I haven't properly tested this yet.\n. Sorry, formatting error. Fixed that.\nI just tried moving it up. Had some weird errors I haven't looked in yet so I guessed it might have something to do with the changed document root.\n. Okay I just had to adapt WP_CONTENT_DIR. Sorry for the mess. Everything is working like it should.\n. So I am still facing this issue with the current version of VVV.\nI got mailcatcher running manually by following the steps mentioned by @JDGrimes taken from https://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher/issues/277\nsudo apt-get install ruby-dev\nsudo gem install mime-types --version \"< 3\"\nsudo gem install --conservative mailcatcher\nTo actually get it working (make it accessible outside the VM, instruct PHP to use it) you need to do more, namely fixing the paths for the service and PHP:\nsudo sed -i 's/\\/rvm//g' /etc/init/mailcatcher.conf\nsudo sed -i 's/\\/rvm//g' /etc/php/7.0/mods-available/mailcatcher.ini\nsudo sed -i 's/\\/rvm//g' /etc/php/5.6/mods-available/mailcatcher.ini\nThis will fix the path\n/usr/local/rvm/bin/mailcatcher ->\n/usr/local/bin/mailcatcher in those three config files above.\nAfter that you need to restart (not reprovision) the VM or restart all relevant services as done in the provision script.\n. So I thought I've hit that issue as well but as it turned out it just took forever until the provision continued. I still don't know why that is, but just as a hint for others that this maybe is fixable by patience\u2122.. @jonathan-dejong I think the mailcatcher thing could be another issue  - see #1235. ",

Switching from one pseudo TLD to another isn't really solving the problem, it's just side-stepping it.\nGranted, .vvv is less likely to issued than .dev, but it's still possible, and using a real TLD that's intended for local hosts lets OSs and browsers know what their dealing with, and potentially be smarter about handling them (e.g., OS X could skip the resolution process and go straight to /etc/hosts).\nWhat percentage of VVV users are running HGV simultaneously?

UseDNS no didn't work for me, so there may be multiple causes.\nA workaround is to using ssh directly, instead of vagrant ssh. Adding this to ~/.ssh/config on the host machine makes it just as convenient. Make sure to update the Host and IdentityFile, then ssh vvv-personal (or whatever you set Host to).\nHost vvv-personal\n  HostName 192.168.50.4\n  User vagrant\n  Port 22  \n  UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null\n  StrictHostKeyChecking no\n  PasswordAuthentication no\n  IdentityFile /Users/ian/vhosts/vvv-personal/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key\n  IdentitiesOnly yes\n  LogLevel FATAL\n  ForwardAgent yes\nRelated mitchellh/vagrant#2462\n. In addition to the other suggestions here, I found that turning off XDebug saved about 2500ms from each request, which sucks, because I love XDebug.\nI was hoping that setting xdebug.remote_autostart or even xdebug.remote_enable to 0 would fix it, but it didn't. None of the other settings helped, either.\n. > I was hoping that setting xdebug.remote_autostart or even xdebug.remote_enable to 0 would fix it, but it didn't. None of the other settings helped, either.\nEr, actually, that may still be it, but I'm having some trouble with it and can't test reliably right now. I'll have to spend some more time to figure out for sure.\n. Resetting the following XDebug values to their defaults seemed to help performance.\nxdebug.collect_params = 0\nxdebug.remote_autostart = 0\nxdebug.var_display_max_children = 128\nxdebug.var_display_max_data = 512\nxdebug.var_display_max_depth = 3\nSwitching to NFS for the www share also helped. I initially ran into the caching problems alluded to in other VVV issues, but tweaking the mount options seems to have solved that.\nrsync is another option for shares, and it's a bit faster than NFS, but it's annoying because you have to manually run vagrant rsync-auto while editing files.\n. No worries, thanks the merge, and kudos to @LoreleiAurora for the awesome work in #980 :)\n.

But I decided that adding the include() at the end of the file is a great way to allow a default config, which can be extended/overridden when necessary.  For example, I'm both adding some new custom servers as well as overriding the default blowfish secret.  However, while I feel adding a separate custom file with the new/overridden config is more intuitive, and may even be easier to maintain across phpMyAdmin versions if the config.inc.php file is ever updated, I don't really have a strong opinion on this so I'm certainly willing to change that.\n4.

Agreed!\n. I feel that scatters things around a bit more.  Instead, I think that having a simple file copy of config.inc.custom.php immediately below where the config.inc.php file is copied makes it easier to understand what's happening, and it's grouped along with the other phpMyAdmin-related code.\nStill occurs in provision.sh, though.\n.

My changes to config/php5-fpm-config/xdebug.ini didn't kick in until I re-provisioned, though you may be able to make live modifications to /etc/php5/fpm/conf.d/xdebug.ini.\nI will be investigating all of this further this week.\n. I took a jab at a dynamic dashboard a couple of days ago myself! Just a couple notes on my personal preferences here: I would like to see the bundled tools in their own section separate from sites so as to emphasize that the tools are not WordPress installations. On my own VVV box, I've also played with the idea of loading tools in an iframe on the dashboard - the ability to navigate quickly between tools has proven to be useful. None of this is essential, of course - just things to consider.\n\n. Ah, fair enough! You've definitely satisfied my wishes - my apologies for not checking out the pull files before commenting.\n. > - What specific parts of VVV would we want to manage beyond vagrants up, halt, suspend, destroy? \nMy thoughts on these matters are somewhat lengthy, lofty, and ambitious, but you may find some use of them yet!\nI would like to see a minimal implementation of a system GUI - primarily on the scope of a tray-icon that gives quick access to starting/stopping services/the VM - which would be complemented and expanded upon by a more robust default VVV dashboard. This bipartite approach keeps the host's UI exceptionally lightweight while ensuring maximum compatibility by serving the principal of the UI as a standard web-page, removing the need for packaging a standalone HTML/Javascript engine (and thus also providing nearly the entire functionality of the UI to those who run VVV on headless hosts).\nTray Icon Functionality\n- Vagrant up/halt/suspend/destroy/provision\n- Xdebug on/off\n- Start/stop/restart MySQL, nginx\n- Hyperlinks that open a browser window:\n  - Dashboard\n  - New Site (see Dashboard Functionality section)\n  - \"Sites\" submenu (perhaps only listing a subset of all sites consisting of the most frequently/recently \"used\" when there are many available)\n    - WordPress trunk\n      - \"View Site\" link\n      - \"Open Local Directory in File Manager\" link\n      - Other quick-links (see Dashboard Functionality section)\n    - WordPress dev\n      - \"View Site\" link\n      - \"Open Local Directory in File Manager\" link\n      - Other quick-links (see Dashboard Functionality section)\n    - User-created installations, etc.\n  - Third-party tool submenu\n    - phpMyAdmin\n    - WebGrind\n    - etc.\n  - General log files submenu (opened via hyperlink as they are not directly accessible from host)\n    - nginx\n    - PHP\n    - Xdebug\n    - MySQL\n    - etc.\nRobust Dashboard Functionality\nThe dashboard itself would be capable of most, if not all of the tray icon's functions. Additionally, some kind of (perhaps overly) optimistic features I would like to see it provide are:\n- Streamlined WP Installation Management: vvv-site-wizard and vv are both exceptional tools in their own right, and very nearly essential to those first starting out with VVV. However, both are bash-dependent requiring users of Windows and some flavours of *nix to install a new shell or emulator - many of which requiring confusing installations and complicated usage (i.e. MinGW, Cygwin, Git for Windows bash emulation). Integrating these scripts' abilities to list/add/remove WordPress installations and nginx host entries to the dashboard itself would essentially eliminate the barriers to creating new sites by hand - allowing even those who have never touched a CLI to spin up and destroy installations with a few clicks.\n- WP Installation Quick-Links: additional quick links provided for each site entry (these could be added to the tray icon, but I fear over-cluttering the thing):\n  - \"Administer database\" (open installation's DB in phpMyAdmin if the database can be discerned from wp-config)\n  - \"Visit site\"\n  - \"Site dashboard\"\n  - \"Manage site hosts\"\n  - \"View debug log\" (if /wp-content/debug.log is available, or a log file can be discerned from wp-config)\n- High-level tools management: this may merit another discussion altogether, but it would be nice to provide an interface for high-level third-party tool management. For instance, I currently provision a modified installation of Interconnect It's serialization-aware Database Search and Replace tool into my default web-root. Others may prefer alternatives to pre-installed tools (i.e. Adminer or SQL Buddy in place of phpMyAdmin). Not terribly necessary, but it would be a neat feature down the road, and would support the standardization of tool installations - something I think the VVV community could really benefit from.\nOne possible issue with the \"robust dashboard\" approach is that it would likely provide interfaces for altering the Vagrant's settings and scripts on the host - is it a reasonable thing to do, to alter VVV's provisioning and configuration files from the live VM? There are vagrant extensions that allow executing commands on the host from the VM that would provide some small abstraction to directly altering these files, but still it feels somewhat dirty to me...\n\n\nAnd/or... what's MVP here?\n\n\nIn my envisioned bipartite GUI, I feel the tray icon takes priority. It provides fairly easy to implement functionality (not regarding the actual tray-icon implementation itself - no clue what that requires) that has an immediate and large return in streamlining productivity; it also functions well enough without the dashboard component.\nIn general, I feel a good guiding notion for the GUI is to abstract away many of the tasks that currently require an SSH session to accomplish.\n. > There are two tools which cover both aspects for tray icon and dashboard.\nAye, both are good projects - the question is if and how to integrate their functionality (or some sub/super set) into a VVV-centric tool...\nThat dashboard definitely has many of the foundations of what I had in mind. It could even be a base for the VVV dash/prototypes, but the project's licensed under GPLv2, and so the I believe the derived dash would have to be as well, which may be undesirable(?).\nVagrant Manager shares the MIT license - Jeremy mentioned it earlier as a possibility for managing VM state. As there are OSX and Windows code-bases available, it could be used to derive UI functionality, as well - however *nix support would have to be implemented separately.\n\nWhat does it take to build a GUI? Is it tough to do cross-platform (Is Adobe Air still a thing) or would it be better to focus on individual OSes?\n\nI'm no authority on this subject by any means, but after some brief research, my vote is to write a platform-independent implementation and leverage cross-platform libraries to compile platform-dependent binaries (which would ideally leverage native platform controls/widgets). Though likely somewhat more complex than AIR/Java, this removes the need for additional binary dependencies (i.e. AIR/Java runtimes). My vote goes to cross-platform primarily for the sake of maintainability - a single implementation with one UI lib sounds very appealing; meanwhile platform-dependent binaries offer next-to-native performance. My digging turned up a few cross-platform, FOSS UI libraries that appear ideal for the task:\n- Qt - widely popular commercial framework with free, open-source licensing available\n- wxWidgets - leverages native platform controls\n- FLTK - leverages native platform controls\n- GTK+\nI lean away from proprietary options, and the scope of my research reflects as much (though the likes of AIR as well as Java are certainly still options).\n. Hmm... npm executes fine in my VVV environment. In fact it's installed by the provisioning script, by default. Did you receive any errors during provisioning (if you're not sure, you can force re-provisioning with vagrant up --provision)? You are SSH'd into your vagrant box (vagrant ssh), when attempting to execute npm, correct?\nBower is not a tool required to run or develop WordPress nor is it common practice for plugins or themes to actively depend upon it - as such it is likely unsuitable for inclusion in the VVV core. Some also prefer other alternatives to Bower, for whom it's inclusion may be seen as unnecessary bells and whistles. You can of course modify your provisioning script provision/provision.sh or provision/provision-custom.sh to install Bower for you.\n. ",

    "JJJ": "The typical reason this happens is not having an internet connection.\nWhen WordPress is unable to get a response from WordPress.org's API, and you have WP_DEBUG set, you'll get this feedback. The plugins page can be sluggish too, since WordPress/PHP are waiting on the request to timeout.\nFixes:\n- Turn off WP_DEBUG\n- Connect to the Internet\n- Ensure nothing (firewall, proxy, VPN) is blocking your VVV from reaching the internet\n. Works much nicer, and confirmed fixed.\nMaybe worth noting (likely in a new issue) that with the switch to Ubuntu 14.04 the RSA key in known_hosts will be different. Not sure I'd go as far as automating that in the VVV provisioner, since we can't really reliably check that the old box was precise32 VS precise64.\n. Let's say someone starts a business around hosting VVV powered remote environments. According to @ericmann's assessment:\n- If VVV were GPL licensed, it is within anyone who leaves this business's right to open-source all of the extra non-VVV bits, as they are likely to also be GPL.\n- If VVV were MIT licensed, the secret sauce could be explicitly licensed as some-other-thing, allowing the business's secrets to remain as secret as they desire.\nPersonally, I agree with @adamsilverstein's assessment above.\n. I originally noted this here, but failed to make a separate issue:\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/340#issuecomment-42417159\nThanks for making this.\n. Puphpet is incredibly excellent, but isn't specific to VVV.\n. I'll drop this here. For me, it was the sheer number of directories in VVV's www directory (about 339k.)\n. Everything is better with screenshots.\n\n. @zamoose Except that it's a confusing non-standard that only exists in VVV. The empty index.php trick is more common (even if it is equally a hack) and could actually be useful (as a VVV landing page or something?)\n@danielbachhuber Now that we have vvv-hosts and the default directory, what problem does it solve?\n. I can't duplicate this anymore.\n. Possibly related to missing PECL Memcached? I imagine things could go wonky if a box is updated and suddenly PECL thinks Memcached is gone.\n\n. Maybe updating Memcached will help?\nVVV uses v1.4.14 and current stable from memcached.org is v1.4.25.\nWould include several nice fixes, including my favorite: https://github.com/memcached/memcached/commit/e73bc2e5c0794cccd6f8ece63bc16433c40ed766\nI found that commit because I was having issues related to getExtendedStats( 'cachedump' ):\nNotice: MemcachePool::getextendedstats(): Server 127.0.0.1 (tcp 11211, udp 0) failed with: Network timeout (0)\n. I think this happens when trying to do-release-upgrade inside the VM.\nThat leaves a few binaries in limbo, namely mysql and grunt in my experience.\n. Hi. Having core commit access definitely makes using Subversion a better experience, since you're getting the environment you're working on. For the rest of everyone using VVV that isn't burdened with upholding the functionality of 25% of the internet, but is still interested in improving it, Git would be ideal IMO.\nI'm willing to admit that I'm bias and maybe spoiled by average (50Mbps wee!) speeds most of the places  I spend most of my time, but let's consider also that these speeds really only matter for the initial clone, not subsequent pulls. Yes, the initial clone will take some time, and is big enough where maybe you don't want to tether to your cellular and vagrant destroy fifteen times, but I doubt that's the 80% use-case here either.\nThe folks at Atlassian blogged about shallow clones and other alternatives last year. Maybe there's some trickery we can employ to speed this up without pulling the entire history?\nThe script is really cool, and I also didn't know it existed until I went looking today, but at the same time this script feels backwards. VVV should be for contributors to contribute via Git, and when they graduate to having core commit access they can run a script to switch them to using Subversion.\nTangentially, theres's an issue that needs filing upstream with Netbeans as it seems to struggle with tracking changes in different nested revision history types. Specifically using the develop site, because the .gitignore in the root cascades up into ignoring plugins & themes, which even though are their own checkouts, are fully ignored; it isn't until everything is a Git checkout that Netbeans understands what to do.\n(I know none of you care about Netbeans; just noting incase someone else runs into this here. \ud83d\ude0e)\n. .wapuu. /etc/php/7.0/fpm/conf.d/20-xdebug.ini\n...was overriding my changes in...\n/srv/config/php-config/xdebug.ini\n...which hung me up for a while today (while trying to get Atom to work with XDebug.)\nInterestingly, I didn't need to do the additional port 9999 stuff to make it work.\nFor wordpress-develop, my working config.cson section looks like:\n\"php-debug\":\n    AutoExpandLocals: true\n    GutterPosition: \"Left\"\n    PathMaps: [\n      \"/srv/www/wordpress-develop/src;/Users/my/path/to/VVV/www/wordpress-develop/src\"\n    ]\nI did change xdebug.idekey from VVVDEBUG to xdebug.atom though.\n. +1 for MariaDB\n. See also #876 to consider using MariaDB instead.\n. I really like this idea.\nHow does this play with vagrant box update? Will it end up keeping the internals of the box up-to-date enough where that won't be necessary, or will the container box version still be out-of-date?\n. Maybe we can ship with an alias to toggle auto-updates on/off, similar to XDebug?. Thanks!\n. Hey @kkatano. I think I understand what problem you're hoping to solve, but I think this isn't going to be the correct approach in the long term.\nA few things this misses:\n- The multisite repos\n- The WordPress.org meta sites\n- Custom websites\nFor this to be complete, will require the hosts updater to be more aware of what sites are enabled, which I'm pretty sure my VVV checkouts have always done a pretty good job at doing already.\nCan you explain more about why you think this exact change is necessary? Maybe I can help test this or other solutions.\n. This is exactly what I do. I half-assumed it was my goofy setup for WP Spider Cache that was the problem.\nHere's the extra dependencies, if that matters:\n\n. I like your proposed solution a lot better than mine, but wonder what the upgrade path will look like, especially for custom sites installed through tools like VV.. Good points!\nI think it's ultimately up to you and @jeremyfelt to decide, but I'm onboard.. Directory structure seems OK to me. public_html could also just be public or web or anything.\nIssue template seemed OK, not annoying. Maybe a little wordy, but it was useful to have a known pattern to adhere to. I did delete a section or 2 that didn't seem relevant, since this was more of an opinion than a bug, but I think most issues won't have that same problem.. Just ran into this. Confirmed this fix is OK.\nWould be nice to fast-track this. Plugin unit-tests are broken otherwise.. Just ran into this myself.\nA consequence of this is that WordPress Develop's .gitignore doesn't apply to the Subversion repository, and IDE's (like Netbeans/PHPStorm, specifically) have issues displaying changes of Git repositories inside of Subversion repositories (in my case, plugin & theme development.)\nI'd be fine with this just checking the correct path for now (to fix the bug) and doing what @jeremyfelt suggests later.. I can't reproduce this on a fresh VVV setup, with latest Vagrant & VirtualBox versions.\nFWIW, after installing all optional Vagrant plugins, my box ritual usually looks something like:\nvagrant destroy\nvagrant box update\nvagrant box prune\nvagrant up. That's a good point. I'll close this issue for now, and anyone can reopen it if it's actually worth doing.. That's a good point. I'll close this issue for now, and anyone can reopen it if it's actually worth doing.. > You can use Phpunit without xdebug just for test running, and with xdebug just for coverage sometimes.\nI understand. I think it rarely makes sense to have XDebug active when running PHPUnit, though. I can imagine circumstances where I want to confirm if a certain test is performing what I expect for it to, but that, to me, seems like an edge-case.\nRegardless, issue is closed since it's something I can handle in the VM independent of needing to be a VVV feature..

I suggest you (or anyone with an equal passion for mailhog) fork VVV with a complete implementation on a branch and I am sure they would love to use that instead if it works better. I was weary about the RVM dependency myself since the APT distribution is out of date and requires extra work to use. Mailhog also does seem to have some added benefits. (I actually like the idea of mongodb, mailcatcher has no persistent storage yet) And it may provide a smooth and clear upgrade path into docker which is in the VVV future it seems.\n\nBut afaict right now this is working. \n. Looks like mailhog might need ssmtp to add proper support for system mail functions. Still not horrible. I often take peeks at other provisioning systems to ensure I had the formula right. https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-mailhog is one I saw ssmtp setup for it.\n. It may be worth noting that I also took steps in my branch to silence some of the warnings from GPG.

Disregard.\n. @jeremyfelt unfortunately in such a case I believe it fails with errors of equally cryptic nature to what i originally got regarding default box.\nFelt it was worth mentioning though, at least for any major version releases in the future.\n.

If you are going through a box change in 1.2, so there isn't a direct upgrade path from 1.1 couldn't this be an opportunity to actually implement pr#460 which was closed because it would likely result in some issues with the existing naming of the running machines?\n. I just noticed it is kind of in there. You just did config.vm.hostname.\nI did \nconfig.vm.define \"vvv\" do |v|\n  end\nand\nconfig.vm.provider :virtualbox do |v|\n    v.customize [\"modifyvm\", :id, \"--memory\", 1024]\n    v.customize [\"modifyvm\", :id, \"--natdnshostresolver1\", \"on\"]\n    v.customize [\"modifyvm\", :id, \"--natdnsproxy1\", \"on\"]\n    v.name = \"vvv\"\n  end\nTwo methods which I had originally found via SO which wasn't actually any clearer. \nI will check to see if there are any points where your hostname fails to replace the default. I had also thought of perhaps reading the parent directory for naming the hostname. It would be dynamic and hopefully prevent collisions by allowing multiple vvvs on a single host by using different directory names.\nUpdate: Read through the commit history for that line and realized it isn't related to what I had done. Still I would be curious if a 1.2 release with a change as large as the box might be a possible point to merge my pull request. I updated it with PR 512 which uses the folder name so even multiple instances of vvv could exist if they were in differently named folders.\n. Sorry. I must have mangled my own repo. It was supposed to be in the patch. Let me try and fix this, and I can rebase.\n. No problem @jeremyfelt . Thank you for reconsidering it after I found a way to dynamically name the box using the PWD. I will keep this in mine, try to clean up my fork too so that things aren't broken like this PR was. I just haven't had time to get to it. Looking forward to your YAML dream too ( there is a bit of a json dream over at https://github.com/lkwdwrd/generator-vvv right now if you wanted inspiration)\n. Sorry about the delay. Does that work now? I still don't know what I did to lose that one line. \nRebased to a single commit also. Hopefully the PR is useful. \nTell me more about the host name switch? Was this to prevent the prior vvv.dev collisions with future vvv instances that use PWD name?\n. Line should be there, and those are the two problems I thought you might have had in mind. I am indifferent to the TLD I don't foresee myself symlinking the hosts file. But I also wouldn't mind if it changed. I can see how .vvv might make sense. Perhaps though . would avoid collisions and allow for some configuration. \nI understand that you can run multiple vvv boxes now, but it still requires manually editing the vagrant file. I thought this would be helpful to prevent box name collisions. Especially if you are pulling down PRs or branches a lot of the time to test/dev on vvv itself I thought it would make things easier.\n. My pleasure! Thanks for doing the extra leg work to check it for breaking changes. I didn't think it did, but hadn't given it rigorous tests. \n. Yes, it works that way for me. \nIt uses the external user settings to connect to vvv from the VM host machine instead of connecting to localhost from the VM itself.\n.

Also looking over it again the config references vvv.dev. \nDid you remove the .dev in response to DNS issues in a more recent issue/PR?\n. Thanks for the reply!\nI can understand the reservations though. I don't feel that anything has to change within VVV. Using multiple virtual machines is not an option for me either. Imagine if you designed VVV to use separate machines per site (perhaps that is where it started) how much more complex and complicated it would be, not to mention cumbersome. \nI mostly wanted to find out if others had interest, but the responsibility for making it work would be outside of this project. I have already gotten Drupal working with great success. \n. Take a peek at my Drupal repo I linked. You will see there is no need to modify core to install Drush and use it for configuring the site. \nAgain I guess this was mostly to guage interest, from community and the project maintainers. \nYour feedback has been very helpful.\n. For Laravel and any random PHP project I think that Composer is all those types of projects would need, which is already present or in the works.\nThe main thing with these, if I do find a way to add many is finding a way to organize it without interfering with the projects themselves. I definitely think my next step on these is to find a way to keep the supporting files out of the www folder if at all possible.\n. Perfectly clear, thanks @jeremyfelt. I agree that VVV doesn't need any changes to it for supporting other platforms. \nWanted to know if there was interest though, and perhaps others already doing this locally from whom I could learn. The VVV init scripts have helped wonderfully. \nTell me more about these configs though? Is this from the provision splitting issue? #319\n. Perfectly clear, thanks @jeremyfelt.

But rather that I was reaching out to the VVV community for input on need, and successes or pain points (like where to put the additional tools you are provisioning sensibly). There isn't a Freenode channel or other means to communicate with the community outside of here that I know of.\nI appreciate the feedback and definitely think I will pursue at least a library of these recipes to use other platforms. But feel that this thread is not constructive any longer as the intention has been missed. I am closing. \nThank you.\n. As I sit here and wait while my VM reprovisions everything just so the services and one site can be started I still wonder, generally speaking would a base box be much simpler? limiting provisioning to only site configuration and service restarts?\n. Gotcha, I must have something wrong in my box from tinkering so much. When I start the box each day it doesn't always come up with services running. To get those running reliably I almost always have to run vagrant provision it has gotten stuck on NPM tasks and often takes a long time provisioning the handful of sites I have in my vvv instance. \nThis takes a long time and seems similar to the initial vagrant up. I  wonder if I am missing something in the provision.sh file that would tip me off to a better reliable way but moving box provisioning out of the script came to mind as an area that could improve on this.\n. I agree it has been dreadfully slow and seems to do unnecessary installs or checks each time. For every site.\n. @devster31 I discussed/suggested this somewhat here https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/594 I think it would work well. That is how other dev env seem to be setup these days. Homestead for example.\nI also suggest separating the provisioning to each site, so you don't spend time reprovisioning sites you already have, and can recover some time lost when you have many projects in a VVV instance.\n. I could probably look at it tonight. \nI think that it was just adding/uncommenting the above snippets in the config.\n. This seems interesting. How far from the original hostsupdater does the 10up fork get? and would it still be possible to add the commands to the host's sudoers file to skip the password each time?\nI believe I have a script that works with the plugins now. https://gist.github.com/EHLOVader/606f7c9f8717608527b8\n. Had you changed the subnet of your VM. I believe it would be in the vagrant file. VVV comes by default with a configuration using the 192.168.50.x subnet.\nUnless you have a conflicting VM or personal network which is using the same subnet it shouldn't give you troubles.\nThe 10.0.2.2 IP does appear to be the default gateway for some vritualbox configurations.\n.

Hopefully this is useful, even though it's so late.\n\nI ran into this issue awhile back, and the cause turned out to be the fact that you need hardware virtualization turned on, or the 64 bit Ubuntu VM won't boot. In addition to double checking your BIOS, you should confirm that Hyper-V (windows virtualization) is turned off. When Hyper-V is turned on, it seems that VirtualBox loses access to hardware virtualization, which makes it so it can't boot the VM.\n\nOpen \"Turn Windows features on or off\" from the start page and make sure \"Hyper-V\" is unchecked. I've also found that installing Windows Phone SDKs can turn it back on (because the Windows Phone emulator uses Hyper-V).\nAnyway. Hope this helps.\n. @dmchale glad it helped!

Funny, that.\"\nIt is incorrect that \"it was incompatible with Drupal's license\". A GPLv2 license is compatible with a GPLv2+ license. What would not be compatible would be a GPLv2 and GPLv3 code, for example.\n. You are confused. What you are writing now is not the same thing as \"it was incompatible with Drupal's license\". Intent or goals is not the same thing as compatibility. I have dual/tri license experience back from my Mozilla days, which is what this topic really is. The only way to conclude that \"jQuery was always used within the Drupal project as MIT code\" is if there was other shipped code in Drupal that was incompatible with GPLv2.\n. Thanks Mark. That's a better way of putting it. It's about forward compatibility. The suggestion that GPLv2 was incompatible with GPLv2+ was absurd.\n. I'd recommend closing this out as \"won't fix\". It deters people from participating and makes it impossible for many corporate employees to contribute.\n\nIn Cantrill's opinion, the mere existence of the CLA is an artifact of an older era of open source. \"In the last five years, after the rise of GitHub[6], there's a lot more open source out there and a lot more people contributing to a lot more things. This has all accelerated the cross-pollination of projects, and engineers contributing to projects,\" he said. \"In the face of this, the CLA looks long in the tooth: before anyone can contribute, they have to consult their legal department, who will then redline it.\"\nTo that end, Cantrill doesn't believe the items covered by a CLA matter as much anymore to modern developers. \"The value added by a CLA is pretty minor,\" he said. \"Much of what happens around these scenarios is arguably fictional, since there's never been a case where they actually happened.

    "nacin": "I have my head tilted sideways reading this as some anti-GPL arguments presented here have included \"commercial or non-commercial\", which is irrelevant. Anyway, MIT is perfectly fine. Since Vagrant is MIT, it seems to be the logical choice. Plugin code can be MIT, and I would consider the wp-tests-config.php file to be a non-problem.\nI do know the backstory on jQuery's dual-licensing. Even though MIT was compatible (as they reiterated in their blog post), Drupal wanted it to be GPL-licensed to use it. This was many, many years ago; I don't know if it was the result of miscommunication, misunderstanding, or a desire for a \"pure\" GPL codebase. Regardless, jQuery went back to MIT-only in 2012 after realizing it was a pain.\nAround the time they discussed dropping the GPL, I was talking with the jQuery team and I realized they had actually only ever licensed it as GPLv2, not GPLv2 or later like Drupal and WordPress. Thus it was incompatible with Drupal's license from the beginning, and so they were using it essentially as an MIT library that whole time. Funny, that.\n. I have little desire to get into a licensing discussion, but I stand by what I wrote. Drupal and WordPress are both licensed as GPLv2 or later. We cannot incorporate code that is GPLv2 (only) into WordPress itself, as we cannot distribute the complete work as GPLv2 or later. Are they compatible? Yes, they are. Does that matter for our situation? No, it does not.\nRight now, you could take Drupal and redistribute it as GPLv3. If Drupal included GPLv2-only code, you could not do that. My point was that for all intents and purposes, jQuery was always used within the Drupal project as MIT code.\n.

Fix works for me as well.\n. Fix works for me as well.\n. @jeremyfelt \nEverything you said is correct. The problem I was having at the time I wrote the patch, was that I had just destroyed and re-provisioned my VVV install, and upon visiting opcache-status I saw that OPCache wasn't active. PHP 5.5 activates OPCache by default by adding a file to mods-available with the contents setting loading priority to 5, and loading the opcache.so Zend module. The Debian commands php5enmod/php5dismod had no effect, and I had to load the OPCache Zend module in VVV's opcache.ini  to get it to load.\nSo, I wrote the above patch. Comfirmed it worked on an existing install. I destroyed and re-provisioned without the patch, and confirmed OPCache was disabled. I then applied the patch, provisioned, and confirmed it worked. Once more I destroyed, then re-provisioned with the patch, and confirmed OPCache was enabled.\nAfter all of that, I can't reproduce the original issue. After two destroys, OPCache is enabled every time, and can be enabled/disabled with the commands php5enmod/php5dismod. Before I wrote the patch, the commands weren't doing their job.\nI'm going to leave this open for now in case someone wants to champion the opcache_on/off flags, but since turning on/off OPCache is not something I even do that often, running two shell commands as opposed to one is pretty inconsequential. They were pretty much copy and paste, I figured \"why not?\"\n. Updated to NodeJS 4.x LTS. I fixed locally but never pushed the change \u00af(\u30c4)/\u00af\n. I've merged the develop branch to resolve conflicts.\n. I submitted a pull request for switching to NodeSource a while back. Looking for feedback. See #779\n. > How does this play with vagrant box update? Will it end up keeping the internals of the box up-to-date enough where that won't be necessary, or will the container box version still be out-of-date?\nMy understanding of the container boxes provided during vagrant box update (at least as far as Trusty is concerned), is that they are the equivalent of a nightly build of the latest Trusty point release. If one were to run vagrant destroy && vagrant up with a local Trusty box version 20170310.0.0 on March 10, 2017, there should, in theory be no (or very few updated packages) that need to be pulled from the source list. However, if one were to perform vagrant destroy && vagrant up against that same Trusty box version 20170310.0.0 on March 13th, and the current version of box is 20170313.0.7 then on provision, any packages updated between 20170310.0.0 and 20170313.0.7 would be pulled from the source list repos.\nAssuming this understanding is correct, then this PR shouldn't change much. Running vagrant up --provision or vagrant provision on an existing box would essentially the be the same as vagrant destroy && vagrant up, just with less time. Running an initial vagrant up, whether after destroy, or for the first time, always downloads the latest packages from the source list repos. Similarly, running vagrant destroy && vagrant up with a more recent box version should just mean one is downloading fewer packages during provision.\nAgain, assuming my initial understanding is correct, this PR shouldn't increase the risk of breakage any more than running vagrant destroy && vagrant up would at any other point. It may even allow one to catch breakage sooner.\nAs configured in this PR, unattended-upgrades is fairly conservative. The most \"aggressive\" part of unattended-upgrades is the fact that it will download all nginx mainline and ondrej/php updates, since they don't actually have security branches. The config doesn't automatically restart, so kernel upgrades won't become active until one runs vagrant halt && vagrant up or vagrant reload.\nSorry for the verbosity. I wasn't sure I understood the question, so I've tried to give as much detail about what's happening here as possible.\n. > Personally, i don't like the idea of security updates while the box is up at random times.\nIt's not completely random, as unattended-upgrades are run via cron.daily (so on could manage when the upgrades are run), but I do understand that concern. We can also alter the config so that any security updates are only installed on shutdown, which would be on vagrant halt or vagrant reload.\nAs far as being on mobile, kernel upgrades are, by far, the heaviest, and we can turn those off in the unattended-upgrades config. However, if we're going to do security updates, I, personally, think kernel upgrades should be on priority.. Does anyone have a preference on script name?\nOff the top of my head something like auto_updates_(on|off) would work.. \"squizlabs/php_codesniffer\": \"*\" will need to be changed to \"squizlabs/php_codesniffer\": \"2.*\", since the WordPress Coding Standards sniffs are not compatible with 3.0.. VirtualBox 5.1.22 is out now, and fixes the issue. https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/16670. The problem here is that we're still provisioning with the master branch of PHP_CodeSniffer, which contains version 3.0. However, we should actually be on the 2.9 branch, because WordPress Coding Standards sniffs aren't, yet, compatible with PHP_CodeSniffer 3.0 (see https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards/issues/718).\nChanging the paths will fix phpcs not being available, but it will break the WP sniffs.\nThis may be a good time to make a move on #1169.. XDebug is needed to generate code coverage reports. I'm not, necessarily, arguing against, but it is needed sometimes.. ",

I eventually downgraded to an older version of Vagrant and no longer have the problem. \n. Hi @LoreleiAurora here you go:\n1. OSX 10.10.5 (14F2009)\n2. Yes but they show the WP install screen even though the three databases (_default, _develop, _unit_tests) already exist \n3. Not sure what you mean by 'site' here?\n. I didn't @grappler - note that coolsite.dev doesn't exist but I have 14 folders with pre-configured sites which were copied over from my previous vvv instance. \nAre you saying all of these .dev domains need adding to the YMAL? Is this a new thing in VVV that we need to be aware of when new sites are created? If so is there any way to automate this?\nOne small update, I ran vagrant provision --provision-with site-sitename this morning and got this:\n\u279c  www git:(develop) vagrant provision --provision-with site-sitename\n==> default: [vagrant-hostsupdater] Checking for host entries\n==> default: [vagrant-hostsupdater]   found entry for: 192.168.50.4 vvv\n==> default: [vagrant-hostsupdater]   found entry for: 192.168.50.4 xxxxxx.dev\n==> default: [vagrant-hostsupdater]   found entry for: 192.168.50.4 xxxxxx.dev\n==> default: [vagrant-hostsupdater]   found entry for: 192.168.50.4 xxxxxx.dev\n==> default: [vagrant-hostsupdater]   found entry for: 192.168.50.4 xxxxxx.dev\n==> default: [vagrant-hostsupdater]   found entry for: 192.168.50.4 xxxxxx.xxxxxx.dev\n==> default: [vagrant-hostsupdater]   found entry for: 192.168.50.4 xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxxx.dev\n==> default: [vagrant-hostsupdater]   found entry for: 192.168.50.4 xxxxxx-xxxxxx.dev\n==> default: [vagrant-hostsupdater]   found entry for: 192.168.50.4 xxxxxx.dev\n==> default: [vagrant-hostsupdater]   found entry for: 192.168.50.4 xxxxxx-xxxxxx.dev\n==> default: [vagrant-hostsupdater]   found entry for: 192.168.50.4 xxxxxx.dev\n==> default: [vagrant-hostsupdater]   found entry for: 192.168.50.4 xxxxxx-xxxxxx.dev\n==> default: [vagrant-hostsupdater]   found entry for: 192.168.50.4 xxxxxx.dev\n==> default: [vagrant-hostsupdater]   found entry for: 192.168.50.4 xxxxxx.dev\n==> default: [vagrant-hostsupdater]   found entry for: 192.168.50.4 local.wordpress.dev\n==> default: [vagrant-hostsupdater]   found entry for: 192.168.50.4 src.wordpress-develop.dev\n==> default: [vagrant-hostsupdater]   found entry for: 192.168.50.4 build.wordpress-develop.dev\n==> default: [vagrant-hostsupdater]   found entry for: 192.168.50.4 vvv.dev\n\u279c  www git:(develop)\nSo it's as if it did the hosts update and then just quit - no actual site provision was done. \nI can't test this ATM as I'm not at my develop machine for the next few hours - but if you think adding all those sites to the 'vvv-config.yml' will fix this please confirm and I will give this a shot. \n. Still no progress @LoreleiAurora could you conform the format here, I've tried:\nsite-name:\n    vm_dir: 'srv/www/site-name'\n  site-name:\n    local_dir: '/srv/www/site-name'\n  site-name:\n    vm_dir: '/users/username/server/vagrant-local/www/site-name'\nEach of these shows: The host path of the shared folder is missing: /path... error\n. Sorry @LoreleiAurora - I don't understand this. Could you try explaining further with a different example? \n. I'm with @LoreleiAurora - running a bleeding edge caused me a couple of days pain recently. It's not clear in the documentation that you can end up running untested code. . @kopepasah how about a warning in the README as a compromise. This section:\n\nDoesn't make it explicit that cloning develop can lead to unstable results. \n. Hey @LoreleiAurora - sure thing, I've actually just managed to get local.wordpress.dev working by updating vvv-config.yml to look like this:\n```---\nsites:\n  wordpress-default:\n    repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-wordpress-default.git\n    vm_dir: '/srv/www/wordpress-default-provisioner'\n  wordpress-develop:\n    repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-wordpress-develop.git\n    vm_dir: '/srv/www/wordpress-develop-provisioner'\n  wordpress-trunk:\n    repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-wordpress-trunk.git\n    vm_dir: '/srv/www/wordpress-trunk-provisioner'\n#wordpress-trunk: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-wordpress-trunk.git\n  #multisite: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-multisite.git\n  #wordpress-meta-environment: https://github.com/WordPress/meta-environment.git\nutilities:\n  core:\n    - memcached-admin\n    - opcache-status\n    - phpmyadmin\n    - webgrind\n```\nThe only thing that doesn't make sense now is why the site is running from the :\nwww/wordpress-default-provisioner/public_html\nFolder and not:\nwww/wordpress-default\nWhich is what I would expect.. @LoreleiAurora heh, can't do a hangouts at 3am sorry!

Unless anyone else has any ideas?\n. @cfoellmann if you want to try that you can.\nIf you have you have push on this repo you also have push on LoreleiAurora:split-provisioners\n. @cfoellmann you need to add the site dir followed by a colon to the sites list in vvv-config.yml\ne.g. wpmu-subdirectory-trunk.dev:\n. @Mte90 The file is vvv-config.yml in the root dir.\nFor this to work with your existing installation your config would look something like this:\n``` yaml\nsites:\n  wordpress-default:\n    repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-wordpress-default.git\n    vm_dir: '/srv/www/wordpress-default-provisioner'\nwordpress-develop:\n    repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-wordpress-develop.git\n    vm_dir: '/srv/www/wordpress-develop-provisioner'\n// The below lines are the directory names of your site configs followed by a colon.\n  preexisting-site-1: \n  preexisting-site-2:\n  preexisting-site-3: \n```\nI still need to write docs/migration guide.\n. I have not tested compatibility with vv, but if its not i would love to help make it compatible. \nPing @bradp\n. @jeremyfelt Rather than having a repo for each of utilities what do you think about adding another key to the yaml file and storing them in one repo. This would give a config like this:\n``` yaml\nsites: \n  \nutilities:\n  phpmyadmin: true\n  memcached-admin: true\n  opcache-status: true\n  webgrind: true\n```\nThen any other utils (including third party ones) can be added to this repo and work with just one line. Kind of like a VVV plugin directory.\nFor example i have mongodb & adminmongo installed in vvv, this config could live as part of the utils repo.\n. @cfoellmann we can do that in the scripts, but we keep the scripts that trigger the installs in that repo allowing non composer tools to be added with 1 uniform method of configuration.\n. @topdown can you please open that as a new issue as this is already in develop.. Try running chmod 0600 .vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key from the VVV root.\n. What OS?\nWhat Browser?\n. Try the following:\n1. Go to chrome://settings\n2. Click on Show advanced settings...\n3. Uncheck Use a prediction service to load pages more quickly\n4. Check if the DNS prefetching is really disabled by going to chrome://dns.

If the prefetching is not disabled, you'll see some tables.\n. @jeremyfelt this does solve this :) im using it personally. why have you disabled xDebug remote autostart?. VVV is directory agnostic, can you share logs?\n. Im struggling to reproduce this can you please give me your:\n- Windows Version\n- Virtualbox Version\n- Vagrant Version\n. Yes you can vagrant provision --provision-with site-wordpress-develop\n. I am happy for this to be merged, waiting for feedback from others.. Can this be modified to install the latest stable every time provision is run?. @cfoellmann just running this on my local machine with * i get the error \n[InvalidArgumentException]                       \n  Project directory database-admin/ is not empty.\nWouldn't that mean we would have to rm the directory on every provision?. Personally, i don't like the idea of security updates while the box is up at random times. How will this play with a mobile data connection/on a train/on a plane?. Is there anything else that should be moved to the other repo? (maybe mailcatcher)\nI am going to need help righting docs for this and #980.\n. Those terms sound better to me, will make the changes now.\nAs for tar/zip support:\n- i am not entirely sure how mutch this would be used\n- that could be a pain considering we cant use gems not bundled with Vagrant (without creating a vagrant plugin) as we cant guarantee someone will have ruby installed and gems would be another installation step.. I like this idea but think Gitter would be a better fit than yet another slack group.\n. @jeremyfelt do you have any idea if we could get a channel in core slack?. what vm provider are you using?\n. VVV is not really designed for a production env but it could be done. You would probable be better using a real provisioner for a production ready box. Check out the links from when this question was asked before in #569 #257.. @mikromakro Have you tried clearing all cookies/browser cache?\n. @kkatano @JJJ The VVV hosts files have moved into the individual site dirs and are available after the first provision, therefore you just have to reprovision. Im trying to think of a better way to deal with this.\n. Nothing has gone wrong, thats the start of the efforts to split provisioners into different repos, see #980\nAt the minute it still requires 2 vagrant ups, looking for a solution.\n. What OS are you using?\nDo the built in sites show up?\nHave you added the site to the config file? (see #980)\n. So you would need to add your custom sites to the vvv-config.yml file now, you should end up with a file like below as provisioners for sites don't exist without it. I can guarantee this will fix it.\n``` YAML\nsites:\n  wordpress-default:\n    repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-wordpress-default.git\n    vm_dir: '/srv/www/wordpress-default-provisioner'\n  wordpress-develop:\n    repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-wordpress-develop.git\n    vm_dir: '/srv/www/wordpress-develop-provisioner'\n  wordpress-trunk:\n    repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-wordpress-trunk.git\n    vm_dir: /srv/www/wordpress-trunk-provisioner\n  site1-dir-name: //<-- this is the name of a directory in www, the colon is important.\n  site2-dir-name:\n  site-3-dir-name:\n``\n. Site:site-name.com`\nDir: \nwww/site-name\n  - vvv-hosts\n  - vvv-provision.sh\n  - vvv-nginx.conf\nWould equal a config of site-name: with the colon, without any parameters.\nSite: foo-site.com\nDir: \nwww/foo-site-provisioner\n  - vvv-hosts\n  - vvv-provision.sh\n  - vvv-nginx.conf\nWould equal a config of foo-site-provisioner: with the colon, without any parameters.\n. is the site dir in www named kaps?. So if your dir is names kaps you should add kaps: to the bottom of the sites array indented with 2 spaces, tabs will not work.\nThe other config options should not be needed.\nAfter doing this please post the output of vagrant provision --provision-with site-kaps. Okay, i have nearly all i need but can you please post the actual output of vagrant provision --provision-with site-testoop. Okay so it dosen't actually run the provisioner, can you show a file list of those 2 directories?. Please delete the vm_dir: line and rename the site to testoop-provisioner: so your entire config entry is testoop-provisioner:.\nthen run vagrant provision --provision-with site-testoop-provisioner\n. can you post your vvv-init.sh/vvv-nginx.conf files (not a screenshot) so i can test this further. . This is on the develop branch (as yet undocumented), please see #980 for docs on how to use the vvv-config.yml file.. Vagrant cannot connect to the internet therefore the provisioner has not been run\n. well in your log it says \n==> default: Network connection not detected.

Hmm, im really not sure on this one\ncan you ping google.com from inside the VM?. Hmm, im really not sure on this one\ncan you ping google.com from inside the VM?. This is a Vagrant or VirtualBox issue not a VVV issue, as all we do is ping google.. The issue template is there to help us help you, you should fill it in not delete it.\nCan you please post the output of a full vagrant provision in a gist and link it here.\nAlso answer the following.\nEDIT: Issue template removed.. Ok, looking at your log there is absolutely nothing wrong here, after typing vagrant ssh you need to cd /srv/www. This also needs documentation for #1121 which allows core VM settings to be set.. Hoping to read through all of this later today :). Rebased onto develop. vv re-runs the full provisioning script on vv create, had you modified the provision.sh file or just installed MySQL manually?. @jeremyfelt these can also be renamed in the PHP5.6/7.1 utility scripts. @desrosj I'm actually working on something like this at the moment. Your feedback/testing would be greatly appreciated.\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template. @mkjonesuk v2 is actually pretty stable and has been tested on bds osx ubuntu and windows, and I'm still unable to reproduce what was happening on your machine. Mind if I take another look?. Ok, what's the output of git rev-parse HEAD and ls www (from the vvv dir). Note that you can't use --provision-with during initial migration or when installing PHP versions. This WILL cause breakage.. If guest additions get too far out of sync with VirtualBox it will cause issues. If you use the plugin you need to keep VirtualBox up to date.. Yes it is, every box update uses the latest guest additions. Fixed in Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template@0cfafed. if hyper-v is setup on your machine just run vagrant up --provider=hyperv. The link in which file?. Good catch, should be fixed now :). @topdown There was something setup for months (a GitHub milestone) if you need to know when a release is coming follow this repo. All repos are tracked here. Most software projects do not inform you when a release is coming (apart from maybe betas, the develop branch is our version of a beta) and we are no different.. We do not need to \"add support\", as long as VirtualBox, Vagrant & the box (vagrant box update) are up to date it should just work.\n(VirtualBox 5.1.8 works right now). site provisioning runs as the root user, either:\n- add the host to the root known hosts file and add the key on your host with ssh-add\n- add noroot before the git command to run it as the vagrant user. Docs fixed in #1147. Are you using VV by any chance?. Okay this is a problem because VV is not yet compatible with the latest version of VVV.\nYou can try using either:\n- https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template\nor\n- follow there progress fixing this here bradp/vv#348.

What is the config you used before?\nOn Mon, 3 Jul 2017, 10:04 pm Perry Bonewell, notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nHi there, in the previous version of VVV I was able to keep my themes and\nplugins in a directory elsewhere on my Mac and map them to my VVV WordPress\ninstalls with a config.

Thanks for clarifying my question \ud83d\ude00. VVV2 still supports the Customfile, there should not be any change here.. Can you please post the entry you are using in vvv-custom.yml. @Pezzab You can set the custom-site-template as the repo for your project and configure the site entirely from the yaml file. This removes the need to copy pasta files.. Vagrant triggers runs the command db_backup to dump databases. You could set a cron job to run that command from inside the vm as frequently as you need.\n\nIf you wanted to run the cron on the host then the command would be vagrant ssh -c 'db_backup' from the vvv folder.. As root create the following file at /etc/cron.d/auto-backup in the vm\n0 * * * * vagrant /bin/bash /home/vagrant/bin/db_backup >> /vagrant/db_backup.log\nThis will backup the databases every hour.\n\nWhat reason is there for this method over shutting down the vm when you are done working?\nThis is why vagrant-triggers was integrated.. Agreed with @tomjn this should go into the custom site template.. Add trusted-hosts to the utilities section of your vvv-custom.yml file to test the solution for this coming in the next release.\nIt will import the following host keys:\nGitHub\nBitBucket\nGitLab.

Fixes #1212 . All of the issues you have outlined in this issue are actually upstream in the Vagrant/Virtualbox pieces of software. We have seen them all before, but have never seen a solution work more than once.\nGlad you got this sorted, Thanks for the feedback :). Can you please post the full output of vagrant box add ubuntu/trusty64 --debug in a gist and link it here . +1, The current docs flow isn't really working.. you can have both installed at the same time, just check them out in folders with different names.. There will be no clashes as they will be different vms.\nThe vagrant-local would be the name to change.. If we were to do this i would prefer to set it as a ruby variable and a environment variable inside the box. Would that work for you?. As we do this i think we should also add a sparse checkout of the docs repo on provision so they are still mirrored on peoples machines.. you will not have much luck with this and it is not supported. VVV is meant to be installed separately to each developers machine.. why not store the project files in version control and install VVV on all machines?. Im in agreement with this as we are not deploying the develop branch anywhere.. Im in agreement with this as we are not deploying the develop branch anywhere.. do you have vagrant triggers installed?. The guest additions issue should be safely ignored.\nThe files live inside the vm at /srv/www. When you run vagrant ssh you are dropped into the server at /home/vagrant, so to get to the sites directory you would cd /srv/www. That is because vagrant ssh drops you into the /home/vagrant directory.\n\nYou are in /home/vagrant on the VM. You can see this by running echo $PWD\nls is an alias for ls $PWD so lists the current directory\nls / will list all the directories in the root of the VM\n\nSo to clarify\n1. Run vagrant ssh\n2. Run cd /srv/www to navigate to the sites directory.\n. I didn't even realise that still existed. I am against this for the develop site as this is supposed to be for core development.\nIm not against adding it as an option to the site templates though.. Fine by me :). You need to edit the php.ini in the config directory then reprovision. Just  to note:\ni wouldnt auto run grunt watch in the background, it does not work great on mapped folders.. This is not something i am willing to support, as many shared folders &\noverlapping shared folders can cause performance issues.\nPeople who know what they are doing can do this with a Customfile in a\nsite dir and allow_customfile: true. @Mte90 this box is a swap out replacement, an upgrade would not be. \nI would much prefer to be testing packer with something stable than untested.. Im building the box for V3 with 18.04 (Bionic). @benlumia007 packer does not allow us to specify box formats, so im going to look at building a hyper-v box down the line.. This can go in any 2.x release, there is a different box for 3 :)\n. agreed, but i wouldn't make this change in 2.X as there should probably only be 1 more release and it could be considered a breaking change.. all shared folders need to be changed to config.bindfs.bind_folder in the vagrantfile with permissions removed and installs without the plugin will have no mounted folders. . we could store them in the repo and add from there. If this is going to be updated I think we should ping ppa.launchpad.net as this is where we download Git and PHP from.\nRegardless of if there is a connection VVV is pretty much useless without it.. @joeworsham please try changing the IP to 10.8.7.6 then reprovision.\nWhat is the local IP of the host machine?. This will be an upstream bug in virtual box.\nOn Thu, 16 Aug 2018, 11:18 am Matthew Harris, notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nI've fully uninstalled, gone through all the folders and deleted all\nconfig files and totally started from fresh but its still only lasting 15\nminutes before the box turns itself off and I cannot find any log files\nthat show why its crashing.\nI've noticed in the changelog that it says this:\n2.2.1 (May, 2018)\nNote that to update to 2.2.1, you must remove the Vagrant triggers plugin and install Vagrant 2.1\nIs this a typo or was I supposed to upgrade from 2.0.0 to 2.1.0 and then\n2.2.1?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/1610#issuecomment-413496191,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ADtkKaCwdUkMaDH0AqPYl0fTo7FrlFq4ks5uRUbygaJpZM4V9lUr\n.\n.

The bash implementation of mustache would be the way to go here as we are already using basic handlebar syntax with sed.\nThis will take all environment variables from the script and template them out.. How much memory/many cores are assigned to your vm?\nThe default is\nvm_config:\n  memory: 2048\n  cores: 1\nWhen changing this setting you must vagrant reload\n. Try bumping these as below as the defaults are bare minimums\nvm_config:\n  memory: 4096\n  cores: 2\nthen vagrant reload. @matthandus I would not recommend using VVV in production.\nHowever this could be achieved by adding a cloud-config through user_data. I decided on upstream instead of php_version as i realised it could be used for so much more than PHP, just as a test i have already run it with Node & Python upstreams.. Fixed, my IDE had used tabs instead of spaces \ud83d\ude44. Can you change this to the nightly instead.\nThis way if there are any changes in WP Develop/Trunk they will be patched in CLI quicker.. This needs to be wp-cli-nightly.phar. This needs to be wp-cli-nightly.phar. It wouldnt work, but neither will most of the changes in v2. If we add something like:\nif [[ -L \"/usr/local/bin/wp\" ]]; then\n  echo \"Removing old wp-cli\"\n  rm -rf /usr/local/bin/wp /srv/www/wp-cli\nfi\nbefore if [[ \"/usr/local/bin/wp\" != \"${exists_wpcli}\" ]]; then it should migrate people seemlessly.\nTHE ABOVE SNIPPET IS UNTESTED.. My snippet above only does rm if /usr/local/bin/wp is a symlink, does that not achieve tha same goal?. This example would still use the wordpress_default db.. Ill put one together :). https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template. Dead Link. We should change this to git clone -b master git://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV.git vagrant-local as per #1072.. Shouldn't this direct the user to docs that include the use of the config file?. This does not update the hosts file on the parent machine. It is just a hacky workaround from before #1080 was merged.. Broken link.. Should probably include or link to docs on the 3 provisioning files, and possibly https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template. Should this be merged with adding-an existing-site.md. vagrant reload --provision. > It may still be necessary though to add the version of PHP to the utilities section of vvv-custom.yml\nTotally unnecessary. MariaDB 10.1. Fixed in 5fc99e7. Number 1 as you don't just need the config file..

Hello, I get the same error but provisioning didn't fix the problem. Everything is up to date (including Virtual Box).\n. I used to to do it in Customfile in VVV 1 using config.vm.synced_folder etc\n. Ah thanks, I managed to wipe out my old Customfile after I messed up my update to VVV 2 and assumed it wasn't supported as I couldn't find any mention in the docs.. As per the instructions and format laid out in the docs.\nI made the error of assuming that the configuration in vvv-custom.yml would create a database, host and init automatically. I realise now that the set up needs much more manual intervention.\nThis is described in the docs though I didn't understand it clearly, I made an assumption about how it worked rather than reading the instructions properly!\nNot specifying a repo means that vvv-wordpress-default takes over and logically dictates the install,, host, database and so on.\nI evidently need to create then specify my own git repo per site install, unless there's another way to do this. . Sorry for the slow reply @tomjn. I've been away for a while.\nI think I've got a handle on it. As I haven't set up a repo for provisioning this is my process:\nSo this is in my vvv-custom.yml:\ngentest:\n    hosts:\n      - gen.test\nI then manually create my gentest directory and under this my provision and log directories.\nI copy vvv-hosts, vvv-init.sh, vvv-nginx.conf from one of the default installs and search and replace the host names etc.\nRunning vagrant reload --provision then installs my site.\nThat works pretty well for me though it seems a shame that all this can't all happen automatically with the details in vvv-custom.yml, which is how I expected it to work when I first tried it - before actually reading the docs properly :). Thanks @LoreleiAurora, I don't know how I managed to overlook that!. Just in case this helps - I was having all kinds of problems installing VVV.\nA clean install with the default and and develop sites was fine until I then added my new site to vvv.custom.yml and odd things happened - e.g. my default and develop sites would disappear but my new site would appear OK.\nAt which point I'd try vagrant reload \u2014provision and then I'd get the the same errors mentioned by @jayhill90 at the top of this thread.\nSo after trying and retrying a couple of clean installs (it's been a long evening) it dawned on me that I made an assumption about creating vvv.custom.yml - that it should only have the new site config in it and not the default and develop configs.\nI assumed they were taken care of in vvv.config.yml not that vvv.custom.yml over rides it altogether! So my disappearing default and develop sites suddenly made sense.\nCopying vvv.config.yml over to vvv.custom.yml verbatim and then adding my new site to that meant everything installed as expected and the above issues disappeared.. @tomjn no I realise that now (reading the bit about the file getting overwritten in the docs was my light bulb moment) - I only mentioned it because it gave me the exact same error @jayhill90 was getting, just in case they had done the same thing..

    "tomjn": "I started work on something that auto-installs VVV, in a react electron shell, that could be turned into this at https://github.com/tomjn/vvv-cd-installer. I'm closing this out as most of the issues are with older versions of VB/Vagrant/VVV, and need to be retested with the latest versions. @yosmangel that's not the same issue, that isn't even a VVV box, you should open a new issue over at Laravel Homestead, this is the VVV project. @zigmasdirigeant do you mean sudo vagrant up? You should never run the vagrant commands with sudo, it will cause issues as all subsequent vagrant commands will require sudo too, and it wasn't built to be ran that way. A reminder, this is not a support avenue for Laravel Homestead, this is the VVV project. Adding a  no_backup: true or backup: false in vvv-config.yml makes sense here. @LoreleiAurora do you have any notes on how this would be implemented? Is it as simple as a conditional around the check? Or is the triggers backup just doing DB tables?. @mariadanieldeepak no it hasn't, there's the problem that given a database it's not possible to determine which site it came from, so adding a no_backup key isn't straight forward. So in the custom site template we have:\nDB_NAME=`get_config_value 'db_name' \"${VVV_SITE_NAME}\"`\nWhich could be used to figure out the database in those sites, assuming it hasn't been changed. In that case, I think if db_name is defined, then the no_backup key could be used. I would need to test this in the vagrant file though, and I don't have the time this week to try it out. @mariadanieldeepak can you post that in a gist and link here for reference?. @simonwheatley you'll be glad to know there are now toggles in the develop branch for database backup and restore thanks to https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1705\nModifying a vagrant_halt_custom and db_backup_custom file should no longer be necessary. Marking this as closed, it's something that would have to be added to the custom-site-template repo. But for reference, exposing VVV to the internet rather than just a private network is not a good idea security wise. Right now I don't think VVV even exposes itself to the local network, but that can be ammended in the vagrantfile. Eitherway xip.io support can be added via site templates, implementing it in VVV core would actually cause more problems than it solves.\nA PR to the custom-site-template repo would be the appropriate path forward, and I believe some 3rd party site templates have already implemented xip.io support. So if there's demand, PR's are welcome but there's no plans at the moment to implement it, and if there were it would be at the bottom of the list, there's more pressing concerns such as provisioning and logging. I'm closing this, anybody could copy the custom-site-template and make it install pimp my logs instead of WP, and add it to vvv-custom.yml. Additionally, they could add extra logs to view from vvv-custom.yml. Done: https://github.com/tomjn/vvv-pimp-my-logs. > Vagrant is meant to run with one Vagrantfile per project, and the Vagrantfile is supposed to be committed to version control. \nIt already is: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/blob/develop/Vagrantfile\n\nThat's the point of using Vagrant. If you have multiple developers working on a project they should be able to clone and be on their way. \n\nThis is already the case, they add a site to vvv-custom.yml that references a git repo, and VVV clones it into the appropriate place and runs the provisioners.\n\nLet's say we can point to a repo in our config which contains the content of the wp-content directory (I'm looking at you vv https://github.com/bradp/vv) how can we get to a point where we can create a repo which when checked out we only have to \"run vagrant up\".\n\nThat flow is backwards to what we have right now. The end result is that multiple VVV environments end up running, and only 1 can reliably have port 80 access. The end result is either a mess, or only being able to work on 1 site at a time\nKeep in mind that there's nothing stopping you forking the custom-site-template and modifying the provisioner to check a wpcontent flag in the config, and git clone a repo into that folder. It's just a standard *nix shell script\n\nIn this use-case the wp-content repo is still separate from the vvv configuration but a new developer can still get started on any machine quickly with a consistent Vagrant environment (which Vagrant was ment for).\n\nIt sounds like your IDE or editor is incapable of showing folders on their own and forces you to use a full folder tree as the only option, or it doesn't support projects.\nEither way, it sounds like you're trying to solve a problem that hasn't been defined here, aka \"I want to have a folder full of projects, where each project is a wp-content folder, and I don't want to have to deal with all the other files\".\nThere are a few problems with this, e.g. where does the WP instance go, where does wp-config.php go, etc. This is one of the reasons VVV sites have a public html folder instead of just serving the folder as is on the test domain specified, there needs to be a place to put the provisioner, and the logs, config files, etc\nAnother problem is XDebug, if your folder only contains wp-content, you lose all the debugging information inside WP core, making debugging much harder. Closing this due to inactivity, for reference there are plans regarding logging of provisioners in the works, and with VVV 3 provisioning will happen once on a CI server so end users will just download a fully provisioned box instead of waiting for Ubuntu packages to download and install. This is implemented in https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template via the wp_version custom flag. https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1495 moves the mysql and nginx logs to /srv/log. That bug has already been fixed:\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/blob/develop/provision/provision.sh#L446. For reference, the log changes were reverted, and moved to /var/log again, and the log vagrant mount was changed to /var/log. Is this still an issue for people using v2.1 on the develop branch?. I'm marking this as closed, vagrant triggers is now deprecated as it was merged into VVV core in 2.1\nIf anybody still gets this on the very latest VVV ( 2.2.1+ ) on the latest Vagrant let me know and we'll reopen. I've created PR's for the dashboard and the default stable WP install. I've also added warnings on the new dashboard for sites that have .dev TLD's so that people are aware:\n\nNew installs will get the .test domains, and existing installs will accept them but WP internally will have .dev in its DB, I'm evaluating options as to wether a search replace will work, or if it's as simple as just changing the site URL. I don't want to break everybodies local environments doing the change. I've created PR's for the dashboard and the default stable WP install.

I don't want to break everybodies local environments doing the change. @rmurillo21 a WP CLI search replace should be enough, it's more the risk involved that's concerning. .test is the way forward, and the PR's so far stick to that, dashboard works well on .test here, and .local and .localhost were also added for good measure, but all references to the dashboard use .test as the preferred TLD\n@grappler I'd have implemented automated migration but I was hoping other people would advise on the best approach to migrating, be it:\n\nan automated full search replace based migration in the provisioner ( would do the trick, some potential risk of data damage or accidental changes )\na prompt in the dashboard with the CLI command ( safest option, but potentially user hostile )\nswitching the site URL via wp option ( results in a mixture of URLs, has the least risk )\n\nThis also doesn't solve the issue of people who used the custom site template and chose a .dev domain.\nFor now, I see the PR's as mergeable without the automated migration, as those can be implemented via follow up PR's\nAs for documentation, I'm happy for a PR with a stub to be created, I'd prefer to have https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/varyingvagrantvagrants.org/pull/23 merged first though to avoid conflicts and make sure no editorial work is needed so it makes sense in the new format. PR's exist for all the relevant repos to set the new default to .test, once those are approved I'll work on automatic migration PR's for the 2 bundled site provisioners. All the relevant PR's have been merged save for https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template/pull/6 so brand new installs of VVV should be impervious to this issue\nI'm going to vote against adding automated migration to the custom site template repo as it's a lot more generic and the risk is substantially higher, but the 2 defaults could use it. I'll work on follow up PR's later this week. You should switch to the develop branch, it has a significant number of fixes, as well as the .test changes. I'm going to close this out. Automatically moving everyones existing sites from .dev to .test is a non-starter as there's too many things that can go wrong, so we're going to leave them intact and make sure new things run off of the .test TLD. Is this still wanted? IMO it should be implemented as a Utility rather than going in VVV core. I'm going to close this one out. I agree it's useful, but a quick ftp/provision.sh that installs an FTP server in a VVV utility should suffice. I'm closing this in favour of #1469 as this is the plan for VVV 3. I added a virtualisation warning to the install doc, we also have https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/docs/en-US/troubleshooting/\nI do think that the installation page could do with some work or rethinking, a huge list of bullet points isn't ideal. > - varingvagrantvagrants.org should be updated to include more documentation (more on that soon).\nI think we've covered this :)\n\nGitHub issues are a tough place to provide support, though that's the de facto spot at this point.\n\nIs there a place on Stack Exchange where VVV would fit in?\n\n\n\n\nStack overflow only, we could try to create a new stack, but I don't think we have the support for it, and they're dubious of using SE for support that way. WPSE would vote to close any VVV specific questions\n\n\nOther thoughts?\n\n\nI think a lot of people are unawares they can come here and ask questions, and a forum might help but we'd have to moderate it etc\nPerhaps a channel on the Make WP Slack? The main help we can do at the moment is what we've been doing the last 6 months of improving docs, dashboard, UX, fixing issues, and just making VVV friendlier. Grumblings on the WP Make slack don't favour us getting a channel there, for now I'm going to close this as nothing has been said since November. I'm going to close this one out, the grunt issue got fixed almost a year ago. Triggers was merged into Vagrant core, if this is still an issue under Vagrant 2.1 or above, open an issue on the Vagrant github. As an aside, our vagrant file now uses run_remote which was documented recently as of 2.2. Marking as closed due to inactivity, PR welcome if this is still an issue. @miladbinyaz that's an Apache HTAccess rule, VVV uses Nginx. Marking this as closed as it hasn't been touched in a very long time. Not entirely sure actually, perhaps @LoreleiAurora can shed some light on this. vagrant ssh-config will give you something you can put in your ssh config for a faster direct SSH rather than running vagrant. Since this predates VVV 2 I'm going to close for now, but if this is still a problem on develop or 2.2.1 comment and mention me and I'll reopen . I like this idea too, but it conflicts with the new VVV 2 changes :(. I'm closing this out as the dashboard was moved to a separate repo. Don't run commands that watch files inside the VM in mounted/shared folders, run them on the host machine\nDo not be surprised if it does not work, this isn't a \"its broken lets flip a flag to fix it\" thing, it's a tradeoff between performance and latency. Docker for example sacrifices CPU performance to make this work. leading to excessive CPU spikes. Vagrant in network shares uses micro caches to speed things up. It's not a simple thing to fix, and it will never be how you expect it to work due to fundamental technology decisions made elsewhere. I'm going to mark this as closed as nobody seems to have had the problem since Jeremeys changes. Marking this as closed as the installation instructions have been rewritten since then. It looks like the name of the virtualbox VM was changed in a way that should account for this in https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/commit/7c488645210643b76c942dba8d9a154abe0cc14c\nSo props for fixing this go to @kraftner . It doesn't appear that anybody has encountered this previous, but regarding multiple VMs:\n\nYou only need one instance of VVV\nA single instance of VVV can host many, many separate sites\n\nIndividual sites can be disabled to save time using the skip_provisioning: true flag. This isn't currently on the radar, if somebody wants to work on it that'd be great but there are other priorities for new dev work on VVV at the moment. This isn't currently on the radar, if somebody wants to work on it that'd be great but there are other priorities for new dev work on VVV at the moment. This would be useful, but as it hasn't been touched in a year and we now have the VVV Utilities system, there's no reason it couldn't be added that way so I'm closing this out. I'm not sure but as we're on PHP 7.1 and the provisioner has been rewritten since then I'm going to close this out. hmmm I wonder if the host was on an IPv4 only connection. So this is what the docs would say, and these are comprehensive instructions:\n\n\nDon't fork the VVV repo itself unless you're intending to contribute via Pull Requests\n\nFork sites, not VVV\nvagrant halt\nMake sure your vagrant and virtualbox are up to date. If necessary, download a new vagrant, use the uninstall tool and install a fresh copy\nRun vagrant box update ( optional but probably for the best )\ngit pull if you used git\nif you downloaded instead though, download and extract a new copy of VVV over the top. Make sure that your existing sites in www aren't overwritten, and you have DB backups\nIf you used git you should be fine, as long as you had vagrant triggers\n\n\nNow your copy of VVV is up to date\nRun vagrant up --provision to update the box and bring it up\n\nKeep in mind that if you regularly update, git pull; vagrant reload --provision should do just fine.\nI'll get to work adding a page to the docs.

There's a mechanism for changing PHP versions on a per site basis in VVV 2 now, PHPBrew support can be added via a utility, allowing unsupported PHP versions to become available. Is there any benefit to phpbrew we don't already have besides giving PHP5.2 support? If so should this not be built as a utility? Or as a PR to the main core utility?. I've discussed this with @LoreleiAurora and we agree we don't want to support unsupported versions of PHP. With that in mind we won't put barriers in the way\n\nMy recommendation is to create a new VVV utility named phpbrew, which provides php55/php54 etc and all the extensions. Users could then include it in their vvv-custom.yml like this:\nYAML\nutilities:\n  core:\n    - memcached-admin\n    - opcache-status\n    - phpmyadmin\n    - webgrind\n    - trusted-hosts\n    - php56\n  phpbrew:\n    - php54\nutility-sources:\n  phpbrew: https://github.com/example/vvv-phpbrew.git\nWhere the vvv-phpbrew git repo contains folders such as php54 and files such as php54/provision.sh that use PHPBrew to install PHP 5.4 etc.\nThen to make use of php 5.4 in a site, you'd do it way the way PHP 5.6/7/7.1 etc work via nginx-upstream. See here for how that works\nAlso see here for how php7.1 works in the main VVV utility. The only required file is provision.sh, and it knows to load it because php71 is mentioned in vvv-config.yml, so it runs php71/provision.sh. The other files are there for the provisioner scripts use\nIf anybody does this, I'm happy to update the docs to reference it as an example, but this functionality doesn't belong in VVV core. Closing as it's already been implemented. Closing this due to inactivity, if anybody is able to reproduce this with Vagrant 2.1 and the develop branch or VVV 2.2.1, feel free to comment here and ping me to reopen. Closing as this is a vagrant hosts updater issue. I expect upgrading would involve changing the Ubuntu box referenced in the Vagrant file to an Ubuntu 16 box, then destroying the VM and reprovisioning after taking a database backup. a quick google search suggests ubuntu/xenial64, no guarantees you won't run into issues though. https://app.vagrantup.com/ubuntu/boxes/xenial64. @DArcMattr if it was that simple VVV would have updated a long time ago.\nE.g. I could go and change the box needed today.. then have a lot of people complaining about lost MySQL databases tomorrow\nIf you can provide a way to update the base box automatically without destroying existing users setups let us know. Or if you know a way to do it but only for new users so it happens automatically when vagrant destroy;vagrant up --provision happens that also works. Do you know if it's possible to check the current box used in the vagrant file?. #1469 should make this ticket obsolete by pre-building VVV boxes, VVV updates would be:\ngit pull\nvagrant box update. WPCS is already setup inside the VM, I don't think it's our place to include documentation for another project inside ours. People should go to the WPCS  project for WPCS documentation. It's not supposed to be outside of the machine for security reasons. This was likely because of an older version of Vagrant, it was a bug a while back that it would not set the key properly. Recreating the VM with a vagrant destroy && vagrant up --provision would be better. No user should ever have to touch the key file as it's an internal Vagrant thing\nI suspect some users might do so in order to use SSH auth, but that is a dangerous thing to do, and not the way it should be fixed. SSH key forwarding is the answer, and turned on by default, it allows the hosts ssh key to be used inside the VM . I'd like to reiterate that there are no circumstances under which one should need to or want to touch or change things regarding SSH keys and the VM. If you can run ssh and connect on the host, it should work on the guest without changes via SSH forwarding. Any other method is dangerous, unsupported, unreliable, and could break your VM.\nIf SSH forwarding is non-functional, upgrade to the latest VVV Vagrant and VirtualBox, reboot, reprovision, and if that does not fix the issue, create a new issue here.. Closing this out as security updates will get installed when the box is rebuilt in VVV 3, a user need only pull down the newer VVV box. I'm more than happy for the blog post to be broken up into pages and used as the foundation of the documentation, I spoke with @LoreleiAurora in writing it and I mentioned if every heading was turned into a page, an installation page added, a page saying what VVV is, and a reference section that listed each vvv-config.yml value and some other things then that's documentation mostly done. Closing as this isn't an issue in the latest VVV releases. Closing this as since this issue was last touched, the vvv docs site underwent an overhaul. Ah forgot about this issue, it's live at https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/docs/en-US/utilities/. I like get_config_key, an obvious next step in functionality here would be to return values rather than a singular value, so get_config_value makes more sense, as it leads to the  get_config_values function. I've renamed the function to get_config_value. I this still persists when using Vagrant 2.1.x or higher please open a new issue. A lot has changed since this issue was raised. This issue sounds like a naming issue of the VM, something that was encountered and fixed elsewhere years ago. I've not encountered this in a long time, @LoreleiAurora shall we close this one out?. > vv create\nVV is unsupported, and can cause lots of problems, I strongly advise against using it. You can do everything vv does by modifying vvv-custom.yml\nI'd also note that VVV uses MariaDB, if you want to use MySQL instead, I'd recommend doing that via a Utility which can be used to run a provisioning script that sets up MySQL instead of MariaDB.

Current structure is:\n```\nLanding page\nWhat is VVV?\nInstalling\nBasic Usage\nDefault Credentials\nBuilt in WordPress installs\nAdding a New Site\n    Nginx configs\n    Setup script\n    Custom domains and hosts\n    Migrating from VVV 1\nAdding an Existing Site\nChanging PHP Versions\nvvv-config.yml - a reference\nTroubleshooting\nThe VVV 2 Provisioner\nContributing\nHistory\n```\nI'm considering moving the changing PHP versions into adding a new site, does nesting anything else make sense here? I believe every file has something in it now, even if it's unfinished. There are TODO markers in a lot of places\nAlso, @LoreleiAurora if you can look in the VVV 2 provisioner page and just splurge out random notes of things it needs to mention. I'll edit and rewrite into something nice, that page is intended as a primer for anybody who wants to know how the provisioner works, and what the various files do, as well as any important things they should know and what feature is implemented where. It doesn't need to be anything fancy or understandable as long as I can poke you on Hangouts with \"what's this thing?!\" it'll be fine :). I have 2 files to write, the vvv-init.sh page, and the VVV 2 provisioner page, but the rest is in good shape and close to final form.\nMost importantly though, it's ready for feedback! I need eyes to look at this and search for grammar, typos, and things I might have missed in my checks. I also need a critical eye cast over the page structure, does it make sense? Do I need to move a page here? A section needs expanding? A subheading that'd be better as a full heading or in another file?. Did a rebase on to develop and some sparse documentation of vm_config. I left a comment or two, but I agree with the content. I believe this is currently the case. @apidevlab is this an issue currently with v2.3 + vagrant 2.1.x + the latest virtualbox?. I can see this leading to unusual situations, e.g what happens if:\n\nthe user changes their domains from .local to .dev, does it destroy the entire install and recreate it? Rename the sites? How will it know which map onto what?\nthe user wants multiple domains mapped on to a single site, how do they configure the exception?\nthe user adds the flag and adds multiple sites, but it is not a multisite install, does it convert the site to a multisite install?\nif a user removes a domain, should it destroy that site?\nif the user adds a completely new domain that isn't a subdomain\n\nSo instead I would suggest the following:\n\nThis issue as is would change the meaning of the hosts section of the YAML file depending on context which is bad\nYou can already do something similar by not using the config file for extra sites, and instead making vvv-init.sh automatically create the nginx template and hosts file so that subdomains are automatically added on reprovision with no config changes necessary, see here for how to do the Nginx part, all that needs doing is adding the hosts WP CLI gives you to the hosts file of the VM, IIRC vvv-hosts isn't wrangled until after vvv-init.sh is called. Also, see https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/blob/57cc18d6555cc9e036e63c0b301ab55a5492c0da/docs/en-US/adding-a-new-site/setup-script.md#L31 which auto-adds a dynamically generated host to the hosts file inside the provisioner. @LoreleiAurora is this caused by the provisioner running as root?. I would note that when the initial provisioner runs it runs as root, unlike the user you get on vagrant ssh, so rvm group add rvm \"$USER\" will need some adjustment. I'm inclined to recreate this PR with 2 separate ones for utilities and site provisioners, but a check via vagrant ssh indicates the files and folders in /srv/www are all owned by vagrant and www-data, so the permissions issue isn't so big a problem. \n. Closing in favour of \n\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1491\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1490. What can we do to switch the files already checked out by composer from the root user to the vagrant user so existing installs aren't broken?. Closing in favour of #1489 . Closing in favour of #1489 . My personal preference was to remove custom dashboard recommendations when updating the docs, but I do like this change. It would need to wait until v2.1 though as we would need to turn the existing dashboard into a repo. This was done and is in develop :) Forgot to mark this as resolved. You can add your own utility repo in vvv-custom.yml, a Utility is just a subfolder in a utility repo with a bash shell script to provision the utility, and any other files it needs. I've had some words, and if you'd like to add Satis to the official utilities repo, PR's are welcome and @LoreleiAurora will maintain it :). I'm going to close this one as it can come back as a PR in the future. I'm closing this as the way PHPCS is provisioned has completely changed and the git clone in question no longer exists. @neilgee is that 2.0 master? or 2.1 develop? Your output contains \"Downloading PHP_CodeSniffer\" but that was removed in https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/commit/e85e31801947293aa91c9a62204427716ce0d528 6 months ago.\nIf you can reproduce using the latest develop branch, I'll reopen, otherwise reproduction in the master branch isn't relevant as 2.1 already fixes it. This works as a basic test, it just needs some extra steps:\n\nmove array to a separate file\nadd the other SQL reserved words\nrun some tests to verify\n\n```\nset -e\ndeclare -A Sql_reserved\nSql_reserved[SSL]=1;\nSql_reserved[ACCESSIBLE]=1;\nSql_reserved[AFTER]=1;\nSql_reserved[BEGIN]=1;\nSql_reserved[BOOLEAN]=1;\ndbname='moomins';\nupper_case_db_name=echo \"${dbname}\" | awk '{print toupper($0)}';\nif [[ ${Sql_reserved[$upper_case_db_name]} ]]; then\n    echo \"${upper_case_db_name} is reserved\";\nelse\n    echo \"passes\"\nfi\n```. This makes sense, I don't think more than 4 levels deep is necessary, as long as the docs are updated. @PsySolix this isn't a Vagrant issue, or a VVV issue, as it happens in PHP userland. Your local development environment works, it's the things inside it that are at fault, it's a general WordPress development issue.\nHave you made modifications to WordPress Core? All i can say is you need to go through a standard debugging process or eliminating causes. Since you're using src-develop there's a good chance this is happening because you're using the develop branch of WordPress rather than the stable release branch. Reprovisioning to update it to a newer build might fix the issue, or if you can reproduce it with no plugins and the default theme then report it in the WP .org Trac as a bug. @jbarbaran can you reprovision? If it doesn't solve the problem can you copy the entire log output not just the final part into a gist and post the link?\nvagrant reload --provision. > my vvv-nginx.config is in the root of the project along side the htdocs folder\n\nvvv-nginx.config\nhtdocs\nIs this the right ?\n\nvvv-nginx.conf should be in a provision subfolder, refer to the custom site template for a good example\nI'm going to close this out, at this point there's nothing VVV specific once you know where the nginx config is, and the contents of nginx-wp-common.conf it's all generic Nginx and WordPress config values. Just copy the nginx wp common file and include the copy instead, then make your changes. You can modify system settings to not reboot when a blue screen of death occurs. Finding out what the error message on the BSOD is super critical, and your problem is impossible to resolve without knowing that.\nIt may also be possible to find out what it was from logs, but it's a stretch. @georgiac44 the password it's asking for is the same password you would use for sudo, hosts updater can't write to your hosts file without elevated priviledges.\nWithout those changes to the hosts file, the domains VVV uses will never work, the browser doesn't know which IP they map on to. Thanks @marksanghoonkim :). @salvatoredibenedetto can you confirm the Virtual Machine has network adaptors in Virtual Boxes management interface, and can you confirm the IP it wants to use is not already in use?. @salvatoredibenedetto has this VM ever worked or is it a fresh first time run? Have you tried destroying the box and recreating it from scratch?\n```\nmake sure this is the latest VVV\ngit pull\nTurn off the machine\nvagrant halt\nDestroy the machine\nvagrant destroy\nMake sure we use the latest version of the base box\u00a7\nvagrant box update\nMake sure the recommended vagrant plugins are installed\nvagrant plugin install vagrant-triggers vagrant-vbguest vagrant-hostsupdater\nAnd that they're all up to date\nvagrant plugin update\nStart VVV and create the VM from scratch\nvagrant up --provision\n```\nI'm assuming you're running on the master branch?. I'm happy for it to be forked and maintained as part of VVV, but it's unofficial\nAlso, @simonwheatley started on a VIP Go build a while back at https://github.com/Automattic/vvv-vip-go .\nBoth projects could do with some extra eyes and testing.

Closing this for now as VVV 3 will be a prebuilt box, allowing us to test and build with newer versions of Ubuntu then push them out on continuously via a custom box. Closing this for now as VVV 3 will be a prebuilt box, allowing us to test and build with newer versions of Ubuntu then push them out on continuously via a custom box. A few questions:\n\nDoes updating to Vagrant 1.9.6 fix the issue?\nCan you SSH into the box via vagrant ssh?\nIf so can you confirm that the hosts entries are all present, and that there are no firewall issues?\nDoes it always indicate 'refused to connect? Or only sometimes?\nCan the box be pinged?\nCan you confirm it has a different network IP to the host machine?\nDoes connecting directly to that IP give a connection refused, or does it attempt to redirect to a .dev URL?\nIf you can SSH into the box, does restarting the nginx service inside the box correct the issue?. SSL won't work automatically out of the box, you can add it by adjusting the Nginx templates to use a certificate your machine trusts, but you'll need to generate those certificates yourself. @drawcard does this still happen with Vagrant 2.0?. I'm going to close this for now, if this is still an issue with 2.1 and the latest vagrant+virtualbox feel free to reopen. I use gasmask too, though I'd changed my hosts file permissions long before. If you leave it running it can mess with the hosts updater by reverting its changes, so I would avoid using it and VVV at the same time. It would have the same problem. Wait until provisioning completes before opening gas mask again so it doesn't overwrite Vagrant/VVV's changes. This seems related to SSH Agent forwarding, or a lack of it, @LoreleiAurora perhaps you can advise?\n\n@antoscarface I see your vagrant version is out of date, v1.9.6 is the latest at the time of writing, does updating fix the issue?\nNote that you can pass the username and password via the URL with the standard URI format, e.g.\nrepo: https://user:password@github.com/...etc\nThe same is true of bearer tokens, although this isn't so helpful if you're using the SSH version of the repo URL. @antoscarface \n\nIt would be great if vagrant might get public key from the host machine and this is my original question :)\n\nThis is called key forwarding, and it's supposed to be on by default. Can you clarify if you're using master or develop? And that you're up to date? With Vagrant 2.0? Remember, any change no matter how insignificant to vvv-custom.yml requires a re-provision.\n@certainlyakey same goes for you, can you verify which version of VVV? Both develop and master reported 2.0 until recently, and they are very much not the same.. For reference:\n\nUse SSH not HTTPs for GitHub URLs\nTest with the very latest VVV on the develop branch, it has a lot of fixes that haven't made it to master yet\nVerify you're on the latest version, that includes the branch you're using\nUpdate Vagrant itself. Halt your VMs, uninstall Vagrant then install the latest version ( 2.0 at time of writing )\nVerify your SSH Agent is running and active. You can't forward SSH keys if there's nothing to forward on to the VM\nInclude the relevant terminal output, even when trying new suggested solutions\n\nAs a final note, don't fork the default site repo, use or fork the custom site repo. I believe trusted hosts got merged in, but I'm going to mark this as closed now it works for you. If anybody has an ideal scenario that still fails though, and they've done all the things mentioned above, feel free to reopen. I'm in agreement with this, are there any backwards compatibility issues\nthis might trigger by removing that repository?\nOn Sun, 2 Jul 2017 at 13:57, Lorelei Aurora notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nWe should deprecate vvv-wordpress-default as the exact same config can be\nachieved with the custom-site template using this config\nwordpress_default:\n  repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template\n  hosts:\n    - local.wordpress.dev\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/1227, or mute\nthe thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AADl58W_ZT9jiALyYIpAQ5BbbGnXhdk5ks5sJ5NrgaJpZM4OLk7S\n.\n. I'm going to look into changing the default configs this weekend. Fixed in https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1468. Or rather how did you do this in VVV1? There were no configs in v1, I can only guess this was done with symlinks. If so, what prevents that in VVV2?. @Pezzab that might not be the case, but we'll need to see your config file to advise, can you post the relevant part you modified here?. adding new PHP versions is done by setting the nginx upstream to the relevant version and adding that to the utilities section of vvv-custom.yml\n\nhttps://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/docs/en-US/adding-a-new-site/changing-php-version/\n```\nsites:\n  example:\n    nginx_upstream: php71\nutilities:\n  core:\n    - php71\n```\nPHP 5.2\nThe problem here is that adding php52 to the utilities section won't work. The person who maintains the PHP packages has deliberately removed PHP 5.2 prebuilt packages, so there's nothing for VVV's utility provisioners to pull from. You can add it back in, but you'd need to script it to build from source in a custom utility. https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1256 contains documentation for utilities that will help here, take a look at the official utilities repo for how it installs php56+. I'm going to close this out, I would recommend looking at the core utilities and building a custom one. That will show you how to hook up PHP52 to nginx upstream, but it's not something VVV will directly maintain ( we won't stop you though ). This is a nice feature, but does it really belong in the main provisioner? IMO this should be implemented in the custom site template, which would make for a more reliable/cleaner implementation. @saulirajala let us know if you need help or guidance doing it for the custom site template. This fixes #1266. @brograhamer I can't comment on VVV 1, but VVV 2 fixes a lot of things and brings a lot of internal improvements. If it is a VVV 1 only issue the solution would be to upgrade, we're not updating the two separately. Try it on VVV 2, migrating is easy, just add an entry for your site in vvv-custom.yml and reprovision. I'm going to close this one out, I'd strongly recommend moving from VVV 1 to VVV 2.x. I agree with @nylen, thanks for the PR @prajapatisagar, I hope we see more :). I'm closing this out as it's been several months since the OP was last seen or responded, and the issue needs reproducing on the latest version as others have done elsewhere. @simonschllng did that work for you?. I'm going to close this out as the change was intentional. I wonder if this can be resolved using the ARGV variable to check which command is being ran? In the meantime a workaround is to set VVV_SKIP_LOGO=false\nVVV_SKIP_LOGO=false vagrant status\n\n. There is a page here:\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/blob/master/docs/en-US/references/basic-usage.md\nBut I can't access it on the site due to a redirect and a 403 forbidden response. Yeah I copied the URL from the tab next to the one with default sites, https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/docs/en-US/references/default-sites.md also won't work because there are no markdown files on the built site. I think Jekyll is converting them to their final URLs if they're found, so it would be:\nhttps://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/docs/en-US/references/default-sites/. Yes, anything you add in the hosts section of a site will direct the browser to that site, assuming the site is set up to accept it\nAs for removing a site, remove it or comment it out from the config file, then re-provision ( always reprovision when that file changes, no exceptions ).\nOnce this is done, you can remove the folder. You don't remove car engine parts while you're hurtling down the freeway/motorway, you stop the car first, the same is true of VVV. Modifying things while they're still running can lead to unexpected things. @nelga  That should do the trick, if you remove it from vvv-custom.yml,  delete the folder, then reprovision, nothing should remain of the site. If this is not the case, what persisted that shouldn't have? If it's just the database that persisted, then you can either destroy the box and rebuild it via vagrant halt; vagrant destroy; vagrant up --provision, or just go into PHPMyAdmin and remove the database\nIf the whole point of this is to make provisioning faster, just add the skip_provisioning: true parameter to the site.\nAs a sidenote, the new dashboard mentions that re-provisioning on config changes is necessary in a few places so that part is clearer. Can it be deleted from the command line?. Thanks @axelson I've created a Pull request fixing it, there's a few docs changes pending deployment at the moment, so once that's merged I'll poke a few people to get it all live\nIn the meantime, all the docs are in git and bundled with every copy of VVV. are you able to visit vagrantcloud.com in your browser, and can you verify you had an internet connection when you tried to provision VVV?\nAlso can you provide version numbers or commit hashes for the following:\n\nWindows/MacOS\nVirtualbox\nVVV. I believe this can happen when using the VVV contributor day sticks with the custom boxes. In this case, delete the ubuntu/trusty64 box and reprovision, it'll grab a new copy. This now happens on the develop branch. The sites aren't stored in MySQL, they're in vvv-custom.yml, so a YAML parser in PHP can read /vagrant/vvv-custom.yml. This was added in https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1280. By WP CLI do you mean you'd be provisioning the site manually from WP CLI then reprovisioning so it went live? Simply modifying vvv-custom.yml will trigger a provisioner if the custom site template is used on reprovision. PHP has access to vvv-custom.yml via /vagrant/vvv-custom.yml inside the VM so a YAML PHP library should be enough.\n\nRemoval should also work, though I prefer disabling, via skip_provisioning: true as we can't delete the folder and database via PHP without complicating things or running into edge cases. There was some discussion about YAML parsers and commenting, and all the comments in vvv-custom.yml being removed when saving. While I think about it some more, an intermediary step is to have the dashboard give you YAML to copy paste after asking questions\nTo that end, I've added a section in #1280 that helps with this before any kind of UI is added:\n\n. I'd note a few things:\n\ndelete a site (includes cleaning up db, nginx config, and yml config file, aswell the files)\n\nDeleting the site folder and removing it from vvv-custom.yml should do all of this, only the DB should need specific cleanup. I would strongly recommend against manually moving nginx configs into place inside the VM. vv did the same thing, and it wasn't necessary. When VVV 2 came out, it became a problem, leading to pain for users. All that's needed is vagrant provision which will copy everything into place properly and do all the needed cleanup\nI also see that towa-cli uses symfony/yaml, I considered using that but was apprehensive about scaling up the dashboard with a composer and vendor folder so quickly, so I used a simpler PHP library\n\nI am working on a project where I need to parse yaml to json, and for yaml I think you would need http://pecl.php.net/ library. This could be added by default in the vvv. The alternative is this: https://github.com/mustangostang/spyc.\nI still need to create a provision script that I can use as utility for my local development (pecl utility).\n\nIt isn't, the dashboard currently uses a library to read YAML in:\nwww/default/dashboard/php/yaml.php\nBut if you really needed it, you can do that via a utility\n\nBut couldn't adding a custom site be achieved with a bash script? What comes to mind is:\n\nuser has to input data in the input fields in the dashboard\nthis data is used by the bash script that does the following:\nsee if vvv-custom.yml exists\nif it does locate the line before utilities and append the new site with the prefilled data using find and sed\nif it doesn't, just copy the vvv-config.yml and again append the new site like above\n\n\ncreate necessary folders and provision scripts in it (vvv-init.sh and vvv-nginx.conf with the data from the input fields)\nreprovision vagrant\n\n\nSo I see most users wanting to run this on the host machine, however, the vast majority of this is unnecessary:\n\ngenerate a site config\nplace it in vvv-custom.yml\nreprovision\n\nBy creating the provision folder manually, and hardcoding the nginx config and provisioning script, you're limiting flexibility. Instead a custom site template would be significantly better. This way the provisioner script can read values from vvv-custom.yml via the bash functions VVV provides to do different things. There's no need to have a dedicated tool in bash to generate the provision folder, and I'd advise against it.\nFor example, would it not be easier to type:\ndingo:\n    repo: github.com/dingo/custom-vvv-site.git\n    hosts:\n      - dingo.test\n    plugins:\n      - yoast\n      - github.com/dingo/test-plugin.git\n    themes:\n      - etc...\nThen have vvv-init.sh check those and pass the values to WP CLI? This also means that:\n\nother devs on your team can copy paste the above into their config files and get a duplicate\nyou can fork the template for a client specific site and put some default content in an SQL file to be imported, as well as any client specific files or configurations that don't fit into a standard WP site\nfixes to the provisioner get automatically pulled down by VVV\nYou can copy paste it multiple times to get the same site with slightly different plugins or themes\nYou can copy paste it and specify different branches and VVV will clone and change branch before provisioning\n\nI understand the vv cli based workflow is handy, but the config workflow is much easier. I also see the benefit of a CLI command, but it really needn't be as complicated as people think it should. Ask some questions, generate a YAML snippet and insert it into vvv-custom.yml using sed by inserting it on a new line after sites: then vagrant provision\n\nexcept we update the vvv-config file (will change that soon) and we dont create the vvv-init and vvv-nginx on the fly (because we have them in our boilerplate setup repo) all your conditions are done.\n\nYay for configurable boilerplate, site templates are the future\n\nvvv-custom.yml and on the fly init.sh and nginx.conf are planned soon.\n\n:(. > I'm all for site configs, wasn't aware of all the stuff that will happen automatically with provisioning. Would site configs be a separate yaml files or should they need to be added to the vvv-custom.yml file?\nvvv-custom.yml is the only YAML file, if it isn't in that file VVV doesn't know about it. But specifically, VVV uses that file to provision the sites, it's notjust a means of telling VVV what already exists.\nYou can create a site manually via a folder with a provision subfolder, but the golden path is to create a site template via a git repository that already contains those provisioner files, then configure it using the options in vvv-custom.yml. The ability to load a manually created folder is mostly for VVV 1 backwards compatibility, though the end result is always the same, you might as well save yourself the effort\nAs a refresher, the VVV mental model:\n\nVirtualbox\nVagrant\nVVV\nSite Templates create sites\nutilities install/update packages\nvvv-config.yml/vvv-custom.yml specify site+site templates and utilities to provision. @filip-van-hoeckel can you post your vvv config so we can see what you tried? It might be that you only specified a single key out of the two required, that you used the wrong one, the wrong format, or put it in the wrong place, we need to see the config file to be able to diagnose. @filip-van-hoeckel have you tried wrapping them in quotes? Does it work when it isn't a network drive? I googled and a lot of what I found looked very complex and fragile, so I wouldn't recommend using a shared network mapped drive for development in general, nevermind with vagrant. I would suggest using basic version control instead. I looked further, and no, right now VVV out of the box probably won't work with SMB shares directly. If you get it working using just vvv-custom.yml then let us know and I'll update the docs, but your chances are low.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn SMB share should be possible via Vagrant, but it's Windows specific and require Vagrant level changes:\nhttps://www.vagrantup.com/docs/synced-folders/smb.html\nYou can't just specify the mapped directory/drive. I'm going to close this as it requires some pretty specific Vagrant changes that will only work for you, but you now have everything you need to continue, and there are some examples out there, but be warned, some of them look intimidating. @marcc1213 does this still happen in 2.1 on the latest develop branch?. I'm going to close this then, there was a PR that attempted to fix this that got merged, if this is still an issue for anybody on the latest develop branch, please open a new ticet. Fixed in #1239 . It's likely that the provisioner in https://github.com/JPry/vvv-base.git failed for whatever reason before stuff could get setup, so the nginx config step was never reached.\nTo diagnose this further, we'd need to see output of a vagrant up --provision for this site. You can use the skip provisioning flag to turn off other sites to diagnose just that site. As an aside, the fix for this will need to be done in the 3rd party vvv-base repo, so you're probably better raising the issue at https://github.com/JPry/vvv-base/issues. Latest VVV dashboard puts a notice up if it detects it's not on the dashboard domain with a note. I'm going to defer to the vvv-base issues for this, if you can point at an error in the core provisioner though let us know what it is and we'll look into it. This is already fixed in develop, but those specific changes need merging into master and deploying. Until then, https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/docs/en-US/adding-a-new-site/custom-domains-hosts/ works, and there's a markdown copy on github and in every VVV install. This might be useful, but you can differentiate VVV 1 and VVV 2 based on the presence of vvv-config.yml. You can also look at /vagrant which is the root VVV folder on the host shared with the VM, at which point you could check the git repo or the readme, or look for the VVV2 logo in the vagrant file. As an aside, this would allow the version to be shown in the dashboard. There's now a version file in the root that can be used for this.\nRe: backwards compatibility, people should always be using the latest VVV, if an update of VVV breaks a site template, then that's a bug. Getting it working should be less of an issue these days, but please open issues so we can look into stuff! One of my hopes is to refactor how logging works so that we get a lot more information, and in a way that it can be surfaced to people, rather than the mystery meat of a wall of provisioner text in a console. All done and merged in https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1280. I like this, @LoreleiAurora thoughts?. Loreleis fix is for Linux not Windows machines, it shouldn't be possible to use it on Windows. It was intended for the host machine not the Virtual Machine. Since the issue was caused by changes to the Linux kernel, this can't be the same problem ( you're not running Linux )\nHave you:\n\nrebooted after the Vagrant/Virtualbox installations\nreprovisioned after a reboot\nverified that you don't have multiple entries for VVV domains in your hosts file as implied by ERR_ICANN_NAME_COLLISION. Does this issue happen in all browsers? Or just chrome? Are you using a custom DNS application? Keep in mind that browsers such as chrome have DNS caches\n\nNote that you shouldn't be adding vvv in your hosts file, as that's not a URL VVV tries to add, and you should be using the hosts updater plugin else you'll be constantly modifying your hosts file. >But host entries are still not being found.\nKeep in mind that the error is ERR_ICANN_NAME_COLLISION, not ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED. This means that DNS was found, but that it was found multiple times. This is why it's important you don't have duplicate or redundant entries inside your hosts file. are you entering http://vvv.dev or vvv.dev into firefoxes address bar? www.vvv.dev is unexpected\nWhat does this command ran in a windows command prompt give you after a succesful provision:\nnslookup vvv.dev\nAlso can we see a full log of your provisioner on vagrant up --provision? If you halt the VM, remove any hosts file entries, do you still get this error? Or does it indicate something different as expected ( if so which? ). nslookup gave good information back\nEnter http://vvv.dev into firefox instead. Be precise and specific about it, don't let the browser try to be clever and interpret what you wanted. www.vvv.dev will never work.\nWhat does Chrome tell you if you halt the VM, remove the hosts file entry, and restart chrome, then visit http://vvv.dev?. If you're getting a name collision error in Chrome, and VVV is turned off, hosts are clear, then this can't be a VVV issue. You should be seeing something about being unable to resolve the domain, not a collision. There's something else going on here, unrelated to VVV\nSome questions:\n - Has VVV or any vagrant based project ever worked on your system in the past\n - Does specifying a site with a hostname that isn't .dev work?\n - Do .dev domains work in other non-vagrant non-VVV projects\n - Does anybody else on your network use VVV\n - Do you have any other local environments such as WAMP, or copies of VVV?. There's the new dashboard that got merged, and the VIP minimum coding standards PHPCS ruleset was added. Sounds good to me, lets make it so. Closing as duplicate of https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/583. PR ready for review and merge, the new primary dashboard domain will be http://vvv.test, .dev will still work, follow up PR's will be needed to change the docs and to switch the default bundled sites. Added a warning in the dashboard if .dev TLD is used:\n\n. Some questions:\n\nDid you vagrant halt, or vagrant halt --force?\nAt any point was there an unplanned halt such as when battery reaches 5% and it automatically stops, or loss of power, BSOD, kernel panic etc?\nAny uses of vagrant destroy, or reinstallation of Virtualbox?\nDo you have a log of the provisioning from when you ran vagrant up? ( specifically from when you ran it today and saw the install screen, running it again won't be useful )\nDo other sites on your install have the same issue?\nHave you recently updated from VVV 1 to VVV 2?\nWhat are your versions for Vagrant and Virtualbox?\nWhich OS and which version?\nAre you running the master branch or the develop branch of VVV and are you up to date?\nHave there been any recent changes to vvv-custom.yml or vvv-config.yml?. I doubt you can retrieve your database unless you've made backups. Keep in mind that you want your local dev environment to be such that you can tear it down and build it back up at a moments notice, and it shouldn't contain mission critical data. \n. @LoreleiAurora thoughts?. what about the stable site wordpress-default?. > Installing WP from scratch (same version as production)\n\nThis is what the provisioner script vvv-init.sh does in all the bundled sites, see:\n\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-wordpress-default/blob/master/provision/vvv-init.sh\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template/blob/master/provision/vvv-init.sh\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-wordpress-develop/blob/master/provision/vvv-init.sh\n\nI recommend you use the custom-site as a basis, as it's intended to replace the other two in the longrun\n\nInstalling all the themes and plugins (based on the config)\n\nYou can do this via WP CLI in vvv-init.sh\n\nFinally, use the GIT repository to complete the installation. Git should contain any child theme code and custom developed plugins.\n\nSo there's a bit of a misunderstanding here about how VVV sets up a site and what it expects.\nWhen you set the repo key, as the default sites do, VVV checks out that git repository into the relevant folder, then looks inside it for the provisioner. It's not that it clones the repo inside the site, it's that the repo IS the site in a very literal sense.\nTake a look at the custom-site-template repo, if you add a new site to your config named apple and use that repo, then the first thing VVV does is check if the www/apple folder exists, and if it doesn't it does a git clone  and clones the repo specified to the www/apple folder. So the git repo you specify is the initial starting point VVV uses. Then it does the provisioner stuff.\nSo you might fork the custom-site-template repo and put all the WP files into git, and then tell VVV to create a new site using that fork, and hey presto, it will clone that repo and you'll have a folder with all of that stuff in it, and then it'll run provision/vvv-init.sh, where you can do whatever you like.\nThat might be installing a theme, updating a plugin, doing another git clone into a subfolder, that's entirely up to you and your skills at shell scripting.\n\nI do not want to do this and would like to automate this step.\n\nGreat, your vvv-init.sh could even FTP in and pull them down if you're happy to write that code, but I personally wouldn't recommend doing that as it sounds slow, and your code should be under version control anyway\n\nFinally, am I right to assume that the production database should be manually exported and imported into the new development site?\n\nYes, VVV has no special magic voodoo here, you can roll out whatever system you want here.. \nIt now matches the new docs site. seems sensible but I don't feel comfortable reviewing, @LoreleiAurora?. This is usually caused by Jekyll being super fussy over things like trailing slashes. Fix in https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/varyingvagrantvagrants.org/pull/29. It would appear the change did not correct the issue as anticipated. This is clear from the issue being present along with changes in the PR that a quick check would reveal.\nThough I would add, it would be enormously helpful if you could help identify the cause. The rules Jekyll is following are not 100% clear, hence it's difficult to know why it's broken. Especially when it's broken on the site but not when Jekyll runs locally.. It's all there in the repo in the travis build:\n\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/varyingvagrantvagrants.org\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/varyingvagrantvagrants.org/blob/master/.travis.yml\n\nThat repo and travis CI file should be enough to replicate and test, I don't have direct access to the servers myself, only @jeremyfelt does, but it's on a continuous deployment process. I'd never used Jekyll myself until a few months ago to change the theme, but it's easy to pick up. I'm open to suggestions and pull requests. best way to test is to put a shell script in a VVV folder and vagrant ssh and execute it, I usually google every time to find a colour chart, it's all very sub-optimal =/\nThe other thing to keep in mind is that you then need to escape the strings in ruby else the vagrantfile will be invalid. I'm happy for the yellow to be replaced by colour resets though, then it'd be black on white terminals and white on black ones. Thoughts?\n\n\n. Have you tried using the SSH method instead of the HTTP method so that key forwarding works? I'd also note that Beanstalk is a client application not a git repository host. I'm going to close this, use the SSH method and rely on key forwarding. If that doesn't work, and you definately have the right credentials, open a ticket. That's still going to be a problem either way. All I can suggest is you SSH into the VM and make sure internally it's aware of those specifics, and switch any submodules where possible. Key forwarding allow for SSH.\nBut, lets say we added a git credential store:\n\nit'd be plaintext, so what's the point of not using vvv-custom.yml\nif we encrypted it, there'd be little point as anybody with a copy of VVV could decrypt it\nhow would we get those credentials into git so it knows the user pass combination?\n\nDon't forget PHP scripts have access to /vagrant and can see the entire vagrant folder\nIf you have a good solution that's easy to maintain, uses standard systems, and isn't a complete hack, then let us know. In the meantime, use SSH and key forwarding where possible. If set up I guess, I can write a doc page on using hyper V if somebody fills me in with the details. @benlumia007 I started WIP docs at https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/varyingvagrantvagrants.org/pull/56 but as I'm not a Windows user I need feedback. It should know to use that box if the provider is setup as HyperV, vagrant destroy followed by \u00e5 provision with the right provider setup might work. The problem here is that we'd need a section for Pantheon then AWS then WP Engine, then every other host under the sun.\nAs a VIP Wrangler if you have improvements for our own docs we're more than happy to include them, we're currently undergoing a lot of discussion and work around the structure of our docs internally at the moment\nAs an aside, there is a VIP VVV repo under the Automattic org but it's currently unsupported and could use testing. There is an issue here about pulling it into the VVV org. hmmm is there any reason this couldn't be built as a VVV Utility? The changes in config/bash_login appear to be what do the critical part here, but could that not just be changed to something that appends to .bash_profile in the home directory? At which point it'd be a simple command to append to that file in the utilities provision.sh\nThere's also various vagrant action hooks that are called https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/plugins/action-hooks.html it should be possible with the right modifications for this to run on vagrant ssh with no forwarding script necessary. If you can get it running on vagrant ssh I'm happy to check and approve though. Upon further examination, this should be possible inside the main Vagrant File using Vagrant Triggers to intercept vagrant ssh, and look up the local dir and vm dir from the config. This would replicate the functionality in vvv-ssh and account for the custom config tags. The VAGRANT_CWD env variable should come in handy. Specifically:\nputs \"pwd: \" + ENV['PWD'].inspect\nputs \"vagrant dir: \" + vagrant_dir\nWith those 2 variables one can figure out which sites folder you're located in by processing the vvv_config['sites'] array. Then once a matching site is found, the vm_dir property can be used to retrieve the location inside the VM to cd to, which is by default:\ndefaults['vm_dir'] = \"/srv/www/#{site}\"\n  defaults['local_dir'] = File.join(vagrant_dir, 'www', site). config.trigger.before :ssh, :stdout => true do\n      vvv_config['sites'].each do |site, args|\n        #puts site\n        # Test this site and if it's the site we want, set the appropriate folder inside the VM to a file that can be reached at /vagrant to cd into\n      end\n    end. config.trigger.before :ssh, :stdout => true do |trigger|\n      current_location = \"~\"\n      current_site = \"\"\n      vvv_config['sites'].each do |site, args|\n        if ENV['PWD'].start_with?(args['local_dir'])\n          current_location = args['vm_dir']\n          current_site = site\n        end\n      end\n      puts \"current_site: \" + current_site\n      puts \"current_location: \" + current_location\n    end\nGives the following output:\n```\n~/dev/www/vvv/www/hashes git::master \n\u276f vagrant ssh\n    _  \n  \\ \\   / \\ \\   / \\ \\   / / | \\ \n   \\ \\ / / \\ \\ / / \\ \\ / /    ) |\n    \\ V /   \\ V /   \\ V /    / / \n     _/     _/     _/    |_____|  \nVarying Vagrant Vagrants 2.0.0\nDocs:       https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/\n  Contribute: https://github.com/varying-vagrant-vagrants/vvv\n  Dashboard:  http://vvv.test\n==> default: Running triggers before ssh...\ncurrent_site: hashes\ncurrent_location: /srv/www/hashes\n``. See https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1314, it won't handle the subdir but it gets me fromwww/gutenbergto/srv/www/gutenbergwhen doingvagrant ssh, making it handle the subfolders if I'm deeper insidewww/gutenbergshouldn't be difficult, it's just string manipulation at this point. The only requirement is vagrant triggers. I'm going to close this in favour of #1314 now that it handles subdirectory traversal. I'm not a fan of bundling a script for this, especially when everybody has their own vagrant ssh shortcut with a different name, be itvudoor in my casevooosh`. None of those will gain any of these abilities.\nHowever, Vagrant triggers is considered a requirement from VVV 2 onwards, but the changes in #1314 allow you to write to a file and have VVV manage the rest, so it simplifies your own solution. Closing this as it could be done via a Utility and wrapper script. \n\n. Should now handle subfolders, e.g if you're in the wp-content subfolder when you vagrant ssh you'll be in the wp-content folder inside the VM too. True, but that requires user intervention to generate the SSH config, at which point they might as well setup their own script, for which there are many. This adds the feature for the default and most used option. @kopepasah I'm unsure what you mean? The behaviour and semantics of vagrant ssh is unchanged, aside from the change of directory when the session is opened. This isn't a custom replacement script, it's a part of the vagrantfile itself that uses the standard vagrant ssh command. Also, this PR handles custom local_dir and vm_dir values. Having said that, there's little that can be done outside of the vagrant folder, as vagrant ssh needs to know which machine to use and needs a vagrantfile. @kopepasah are you referring to things like vagrant ssh -c \"command goes here\"? If so, then yes, that's standard Vagrant stuff, this PR doesn't break any of that, all it changes is the folder you end up in once you ssh in.\nE.g. \n```\n~/dev/www/vvv/www/gutenberg git::master \n\u276f vagrant ssh -c \"touch banana.txt\"\n    _  \n  \\ \\   / \\ \\   / \\ \\   / / | \\ \n   \\ \\ / / \\ \\ / / \\ \\ / /    ) |\n    \\ V /   \\ V /   \\ V /    / / \n     _/     _/     _/    |_____|  \nVarying Vagrant Vagrants 2.0.0\nDocs:       https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/\n  Contribute: https://github.com/varying-vagrant-vagrants/vvv\nConnection to 127.0.0.1 closed.\n~/dev/www/vvv/www/gutenberg git::master \n\u276f ls\nREADME.md   banana.txt  log         provision   public_html wp-cli.yml\n``. This needs changing to work with the new vagrant triggers, but tbh I think this could be built as a utility, and doesn't need to be in VVV core. By Vagrant 2.0, are you referring tomasterordevelop?. VVV 2 sorry. I would **strongly** recommend usingdevelop`, it has a huge number of fixes ( releasing 2.1 has been very heavily delayed for IRL reasons ).\nAlso keep in mind that for any bugs that happen on master, we need to know if they happen on develop. Awesome, in that case I'm going to close, if anybody else encounters this on the develop branch please reopen. Handles situations where VVV was downloaded as an archive\n\n. > 1. I think the default site thing should be abandoned because its basically the same as a custom site just with hardcoded stuff right? That can bite you hard if you try to edit the config nothing will happen! And I think it should have perfect parity with the default site setup so why maintain both when one can do it?\nI agree, but changing it isn't so simple, there's an issue for it elsewhere\n\n\n.dev is becoming a actual domain soon. This is why just picked .local no subdomain just straight to the point.\n\n\nThis was already handled in a previous PR where we changed everything to .test by default. .local has problems with conflicts when using zeroconf/bonjour on a network if any device has the same name\n\n\nMade it the folders actually represent the domains like its often seen on actual servers.\n\n\nSites can have multiple domains, and some of the default sites do have multiple domains\n\n\nPut a multisite example in there, the custom: wp_type: subdirectory does not make it very obvious that it will create a multisite because 'multisite' is no where mentioned in the config, that could be improved if you ask me.\n\n\nThere's actually an example with explanations on the dashboard at http://vvv.test at the bottom\n\n\n\nCommented out then development env because I think not everyone needs that installed by default.\n\n\nThis is important for core dev, and relied on for a lot of contributor day VVV setups. You can always use the skip_provisioning: true option if it's not your cup of tea\n. https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1155 and https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1156 already fix this, but they haven't been merged for good reasons\nSImply put, they would break all existing VVV installs. Until a mechanism for either converting existing users over, or running as root for existing and non-root for new users, they can't be merged. Just changing the user it runs under isn't enough. related to https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/1325. So this is still an issue after a fix that should have corrected it =/ Not sure why the page just doesn't exist\nOn the other hand a lot of other things got fixed!. For reference, the docs are markdown files available at https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/varyingvagrantvagrants.org. I have a strong suspicion that the issue is that the permalink in the markdown file specified is missing a trailing slash, as demonstrated by the page ending up at:\nhttps://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/docs/en-US/installation/software-requirements.html\nnot:\nhttps://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/docs/en-US/installation/software-requirements/\nWhich suggests that this PR will fix it https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/varyingvagrantvagrants.org/pull/32. @jeremyfelt any thoughts? ^^ Also any chance we can get 404's working?. 2.1 shipped, merging. good catch, are you okay to do a PR for this against https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/varyingvagrantvagrants.org ?. Awesome :), i see your PR got merged so I'm going to close this. I did consider having the splash screen ASCII art prompt you if your git repo was behind by several commits to do a git pull. git can figure it out after a fetch, I say we figure it out on provision, or poke if the person hasn't done a git pull in a while, no need to be precise. I thought you'd merged it until I saw a setup step on another project. I'm unsure what your exact steps are so I can reproduce, but:\n\nvagrant up to start the VM\nvagrant ssh to enter it\nxdebug_on to turn on XDebug\nxdebug_off to turn off XDebug\n\nAre you having different behaviour to the above? Or is it that XDebug isn't on by default? Note that turning it on by default causes performance problems for composer, and provisioning would take a lot more time.\nI'd also note that a flag in vvv-custom.yml would mean having to reprovision the VM every time you wanted to turn XDebug on and off. hmmm so I'm still trying to piece together exactly what the request is, is it to:\n\nhave xdebug turned on by default when a VM starts?\nHave xdebug_on turn it on permanently, and xdebug_off turn it off permanently?\n\nIf I understand correctly, you'd prefer xdebug was always turned on and never had to do that manually\nIf so, have you considered putting xdebug_on inside a vagrant up custom script at config/homebin/vagrant_up_custom?\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/blob/develop/config/homebin/vagrant_up. > * Uninstall VirtualBox (since this will carry out a vagrant destroy)\n\n\nUninstall Vagrant.\n\n\nThese steps are a tad over the top, and a bit like removing the bottom 2 layers of a Jenga tower, it's anything but clean ( which appears to be your goal. vagrant destroy lets Vagrant do all the cleanup it needs, but by removing VirtualBox first, you mess with that. Treat it like an Onion, you've built layers up, so tear them down in the right order, don't start at the foundations first, it's messy\n\nI just created a new VVV site from scratch, and began to experience the same issue, this time after installing the Avada theme.\n\nOf course switching from a default theme to Avada will make things slower. There are faulty expectations at play here. VVV performance is not linear, nor is any other host. They all have things they excel or not excel at, much like some cars have better torque, some have better breaks, some are faster, some are more efficient. Avada will be doing things other themes don't, those might not play to the strengths of your local machine.\nFor example, some users take a very long time to provision VVV due to spinning mechanical disks. Others don't have good network connections ( or antivirus and firewalls that meddle with it ).\nSome themes are faster than others, and they're faster or slower for different reasons. You will never get identical performance to a remote host, or even between remote hosts, and the chances of a complete refresh uninstalling VirtualBox Vagrant etc changing this are low in the extremes.\nI know you want it to be just as fast, but you are at the mercy of what the code does, and the local hardware available to you. Fundamentally though, you have yet to actually identify what is slow beyond a Product name, except in scenarios where I would expect it to be slow for any or all hosts purely because of the way it was done ( e.g. remote requests, your computer isn't in a data centre on an internet backbone so of course a request to Instagram will be much slower than from say a SiteGround or GoDaddy server, if only because there's a greater number of hops, eitherway it's bad on all hosts ).\nI know it's frustrating, and your main reason for using local dev environments is it's faster than developing in production (there are many other good reasons to use local dev), but I don't think you have realistic expectations, and there are so many unknown variables. For all I know your machine has lots of RAM and you've 10 other environments running in the background. You might have 200 chrome tabs open ( easily done ), a strange filesystem, or even that you never bothered to install the Oracle VirtualBox Extension pack and it's interacting strangely.\nIn all likelihood the culprit is that you didn't spend $2000 on a server grade CPU, but you're comparing your local computers CPU to that of a dedicated server with 5x as many CPU cores and much greater processing power that can juggle 100 sites effortlessly on a streamlined server OS that doesn't have to render a window manager etc. Production is fast for some things especially when you have it optimised for a particular task\nWe already know for a fact that a handful of cases you've mentioned are down to poor developer practice by the plugin author, or doing things that fundamentally aren't fast. Right now unless you can identify something specific ( and not a product or brand name ), there really isn't much that can be done short of getting faster hardware. I need to see something specific, to know that Avada is slower than 2019 really doesn't tell me much, what is it doing that's slower? Which part of Avada specifically? Can it be isolated down to a specific function? And replicated locally without needing things such as remote requests or stupidly expensive queries? If it is queries, can you time them and compare them against other results in equivalent environments? E.g. Chassis, Docker, MAMP, etc. There's too much feeling, lots of super high level general data, no specifics.\n\nThe TLDR:\nIf you want to remove a VVV install:\n\nRun vagrant destroy\nRemove the VVV folder\n\nThat should be all that's necessary. Reinstalling VirtualBox and Vagrant is for when either of them are broken, do not expect performance gains from doing it. Updating them and VVV to the latest versions might do that, but no guarantees.. > I actually have never heard of this. Is this part of the suggested components for VVV? If so, I'd be interested in trying it.\nit's hard not to have this if you've tried investigating things, opening VirtualBox' UI basically nags you to install it, but I'm not aware of any issues it might cause ( it's mostly for USB drive stuff and other more exotic things ), so it's basically me grasping at straws. I've helped setup plenty of machines at contributor days without seeing or mentioning it so I doubt it's related\nIn all honesty, I think the problem is that these plugins and themes are heavy, and it shows more in VVV than on enterprise grade server hardware. A quick look at the Avada theme site shows it has its own page builder and 101 options. By virtue of simply being itself it will never run as fast as a simpler theme such as the default ones.\nThere's a good chance the server at the other end is running a Xeon CPU with lots of cores and a silly amount of RAM, things you'd never find in consumer grade hardware. I like to think my maxed out MBP has decent CPU, but it doesn't hold a candle to some server hardware in benchmarks. Having said that I'm sure it demolishes them on GPU despite being an integrated chipset. With that in mind a clean install won't do much of anything. > OK, could very well true. In this particular case, the remote server in-question is the lowest tiered shared hosting server from GoDaddy. So nearly bottom of the barrel in terms of delivered performance. I'm not sure on the exact server specs, but obviously each server will be more powerful than my lone computer. But does my site have access to the full resources of each server?\nIt does, but everyone else has access to those same resources. Shared hosting isn't slow because it's on old machines, it's slow because they're shared. That's why you don't get object caching etc as it'd reduce the number of hosts that can run on a server. If nobody else visited the sites on that server you'd get dedicated server level performance, but the chances of that are 1 in a million.\nIdeally you'd want a handful of powerful servers then load them up with as many sites as it can manage to get your moneys worth. The more low traffic sites that you can fit on it the greater the return. The same with VPS' only you can afford to fit fewer on them and move them to other machines if they run too hot. I'm sure my own digital ocean droplet is sharing a host with other VMs and that they've gambled that not all of them will spin up to full cpu usage at all times, but I know it's more secure than shared, more control, and that I can get more performance out of it if needs be, but the underlying hardware is probably identical. > Would I? Don't I have resource limits, e.g. 2 GB RAM, 1 MB/s bandwidth, etc?\nThose things get monitored, after all if you have 1000 sites on a host, but 90% of the resources are consumed by 1 busy site that has awful performance, then that sites owners likely to get told to reduce their CPU usage as they'll be slowing everybody else down to a crawl, possibly even booted off. Besides if your page requests require 2GB of RAM, or regularly take more than 15 seconds to generate, then something is terribly wrong. It's also why shared hosts make you agree not to use your account as a file download server.\nOnce you move to a VPS, you can throttle CPU availability and load balance properly, but shared hosts are kind of like the communal commons of old, which is why they're so cheap (and at times so slow). Managed hosting is more like a lightweight VPS except you only have control of the wp-content folder and limited host management. @oscarssanchez were you able to check the above info? If you're unable to or need help let me know. As a sidenote, once https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1377 is merged, if you visit the IP directly, it'll give a note about the hosts updater and some info, and try to prompt the user to use http://vvv.test instead. This should be added via a utility, I'd recommend building it into a custom/3rd party utility, and if it's super handy we can merge it into the main VVV core utility, though people will need to update their vvv-custom.yml to get it\nOn the other hand, what is the purpose of this on a local developer environment intended for a single person? How would this integrate with the existing stuff? PHP error logs are set via nginx configs which could be anywhere depending on the site provisioner. @dingo-d I tracked down your problem, the instructions you're following aren't for Prometheus 2\nYou should be able to start prometheus with this:\n./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml\nAfter following this:\nhttps://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/\nThen visiting:\n\nhttp://vvv.test:9090/graph also works here, although I have no data, and I'm not sure how I would record data. You'd probably also want Grafana or Kibana.\nI'd suggest you create a VVV utility for this, along with grafana etc, a git repo with a prometheus/provision.sh and a grafana/provision.sh that checks if it's installed and starts it will do. In the meantime though, I'm going to close this, let us know if you manage to get this working well and we might merge it into VVV utilities as an option. Hello @stevediabo-sa !\nI notice you've left all of the questions and details blank, so at the moment it's impossible to diagnose what went wrong.\nTo help I'm going to need:\n\nVVV version\ngit branch? Or zip install?\nVagrant version?\nVM Provider ( probably virtualbox but we need to know for sure )\nVM Provider version?\nOS? Windows? MacOS? Ubuntu? Etc\n\nAnd finally, a copy of the provisioning output, if there were any errors we'll need to see them, so run vagrant up --provision and show us the output\nAlso, your issue title says \"default webpage\", but it's not clear what you mean by that, do you mean the VVV dashboard? Or do you mean the Nginx default page? Please be explicit about the details. @stevediabo-sa are you able to get any of the information I asked for above? There's not enough info to help at the moment, or diagnose the issue\nAs a sidenote, are you using the vv command?. If you're ok with starting afresh, can you run:\nvagrant destroy\nvagrant box update\ngit pull\nvagrant up --provision\nAnd put the output in a gist?. http://local.wordpress.test/ should work, and that's what I'd recommend you use, can you describe what you see when you visit that address? And can you send a copy of the output of the vagrant up command you ran?. ok I think the problem is because it did stuff the first time but failed, it's seeing those files and trying to update WP rather than install it\nDelete the www/wordpress-default folder and vagrant up --provision, I'll look into improving that check. are you ok with destroying your VVV instance? If the default local site doesn't work I would expect to see the VVV dashboard, not \"it works\".\nIf so:\nvagrant halt\nvagrant destroy\nvagrant box update\nvagrant up --provision\nYou should also update Vagrant, v1.9.7 is out of date, the current latest is v2.0.1. Make sure to uninstall Vagrant before installing 2.0 so that it's a clean unbroken install\nAlso keep in mind that when you reply via email, it inserts a huge email signature, along with quoted copies of all previous replies, that i have to edit out each time. If you can use GitHub or edit your signature down that would be helpful. hmmm I've never encountered this before, and you said you did this with a brand new fresh copy of VVV?\nI was going to ask if I could see the nginx config for the default site, which you can grab by doing this:\nvagrant ssh\ncp /etc/nginx/custom-sites/vvv-auto-wordpress-default-provision-* /vagrant/\nexit\nWhich should dump the file in the main VVV folder. This and the other files should be copies of the files in config/nginx-config, and the wordpress-default config should look like this:\n```\n\nWordPress stable nginx configuration\n\nhttp://local.wordpress.dev - this server configuration is\nsetup to listen on port 80 for any requests coming in to\nlocal.wordpress.dev and use the /srv/www/wordpress-default/public_html directory\nto serve them.\nserver {\n    listen       80;\n    listen       443 ssl;\n    server_name  local.wordpress.test .local.wordpress.test local.wordpress.dev .local.wordpress.dev ~^local.wordpress.\\d+.\\d+.\\d+.\\d+.xip.io$;\n    root         /srv/www/wordpress-default/public_html;\nerror_log    /srv/www/wordpress-default/log/error.log;\naccess_log   /srv/www/wordpress-default/log/access.log;\n\nset          $upstream php;\n\ninclude      /etc/nginx/nginx-wp-common.conf;\n\n}\n```\nYour gist suggests they were succesfully copied however:\n==> default:  * Copied /srv/config/nginx-config/nginx.conf           to /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n==> default:  * Copied /srv/config/nginx-config/nginx-wp-common.conf to /etc/nginx/nginx-wp-common.conf\n==> default:  * Rsync'd /srv/config/nginx-config/sites/              to /etc/nginx/custom-sites\nIn the meantime I was also going to suggest you add an additional site via the custom site template repo, which would give you another stable WP install ( you can have as many as you like )\nAdd this under the sites section of vvv-custom.yml and reprovision:\nmy-site:\n    repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template\n    hosts:\n      - my-site.test\nAdditionally, can you run sudo nginx -t? You should see this output:\nvagrant@vvv:~$ sudo nginx -t\nnginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok\nnginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful\nFinally, if you can send the results of sudo nginx -T in a gist?\nApologies for the number of requests, and thanks for getting me more information :) I've already ascertained some changes that could be made to improve things, but none that directly impact this issue.. wait whaaat?!\nRun:\nvagrant ssh\nsudo apt-get install nginx\nexit\nvagrant halt\nvagrant up --provision\nthen try visiting the sites. Also can you screenshot the \"It works!\" page? And check its source code to see if it has a generator? I suspect \"It works!\" is actually an Apache page. Also can I see a full copy of your vvv-custom.yml and vvv-config.yml and can you verify no other dev environment MAMP/Valet/Chassis/etc are running?. Also the output of service --status-all. ah, can you run that inside the VM via vagrant ssh?\nI managed to track down that if Nginx was just showing the default, it would be saying \"Welcome to Nginx\" like this:\n\nBut if this is what you're seeing:\n\nThen that's an Apache server, VVV doesn't use Apache, @LoreleiAurora @jeremyfelt thoughts?. That's possible, your output for the service command matches mine. I'd expect you'd be aware of any MAMP or equivalents still running though, vagrant global-status should show you all the vagrant instances on your machine, running or turned off. hmmm do you have any clues as to what the cc7b264 box is that's running in your home folder? You should be able to run vagrant halt cc7b264 to stop it. Glad you got it working!\nThose should be listed at https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/docs/en-US/default-credentials/. Sounds like the hosts updater plugin isn't installed. I don't believe VVV has ever directly supported xip.io, so any support it had was accidental. Having said that, it's certainly possible to have it done with the right provisioner changes, and a PR is more than welcome\nYou might also consider upgrading from VVV 2 -> 2.1 and Vagrant 1.9.7 to 2.0.1\nThis issue and the linked details may be helpful:\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/483. Also relevant:\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/449/files\nNginx rules for your sites will need adjusting so that Nginx knows to serve the correct site. @certainlyakey those were merged back in VVV 1, that entire sub-system has seen a near total rewrite since then, and the xip.io nginx configs are not currently present.\nThe only current reference to xip.io is in a changelog markdown file. At the moment there is no built in support for xip.io, you would have to add it. As a sidenote, some forks of the custom site template implement xip.io, and use a xipio key when defining a site, implementing this would involve backporting those changes, though I've misplaced where that fork is.. I'm going to close this one out. Since this isn't something VVV core currently supports, it isn't a bug. If in future this gets added it'll be via the custom site template. Fixed, though the PNGs show on GitHub and locally, could it be a browser cache thing? I had to add a filemtime check to cache bust the stylesheet in a commit. @adrianosferreira can you provide some super critical information? E.g.\n\nwhat command is that the output of? vagrant up? vagrant up --provision? vagrant reload? etc\ncan you provide the entire output?\nWhich version of VVV is it?\nIs this a git install or a zip install?\nmaster or develop? And is it up to date?\nWhich version of Virtualbox are you using\nWhich version of Vagrant are you using\nWindows? Mac? Linux? Which version?\nDoes the issue persist after a reboot?\n\nAll this information is needed, even if the answer is \"I don't know\" or ?. @adrianosferreira were you able to get anymore information?. @adrianosferreira that's unfortunate, I could have helped, but in the meantime, if any of the questions I asked can be answered it'd be a great help. Encountered this on another machine, debugging. So after some tracking down by @LoreleiAurora it seems the maria DB server wasn't present for whatever reason. Unsure why it happened, but if anybody encounters this:\n\nvagrant ssh\nsudo apt-get install mariadb-server\nexit\nvagrant reload --provision. @kristoffeb it shouldn't happen to begin with, and I'm not sure why it happens. Having said that, a reprovision should have installed everything that needed installing, and when moving from VVV 1 to 2, I'd recommend destroying the box first anyway via vagrant destroy. Marking this as closed as nobody has encountered it in a while, also #1469 would eliminate this as an issue. You can do that but it'll need to be redone everytime you provision, hence utilities\n\nSo create a utility repo, create a browscap folder, and put a provision.sh inside that sets up browscap.ini and the PHP extension. Remember to check if it's already installed, and remember to check PHP versions so you install the correct extension. No, it sounds like either the file can't be executed or it isn't readable by the root user, check it's permissions and flags. If you never change the current directory could you not do away with DIR?. try it and find out :). provisioners run as root, but when you vagrant ssh you're not the root user, hence the permissions issue\nOther than that, I'm speculating and grasping at straws right now. All I can suggest is try it and if it works it works, if it doesn't it doesn't. @marcelo2605 how is your site setup? Is it based on the custom site template? Have you modified the hosts in vvv-custom.yml? What does your vvv-custom.yml look like? How did you restart the server? Did you reprovision during that restart? ( any change, no matter how tiny or insignificant to provisioning files or vvv-custom.yml requires a reprovision, no exceptions )\nCan you run vagrant halt;vagrant up --provision? I get the feeling the problem is that you made changes after provisioning to vvv-hosts, meaning that they have not been applied yet. Ah, I STRONGLY recommend against using vv, it doesn't support VVV 2 properly, and when it goes wrong it can be a massive pain to fix. It's easier to just use the custom site template and vvv-custom.yml\nKeep in mind that if it isn't listed in vvv-custom.yml it doesn't exist, and VVV will be unaware of the site. \nE.g. you should have something like this in the sites section:\nldv:\n    hosts:\n      ldv.test. PR to update the troubleshooting page added https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/varyingvagrantvagrants.org/pull/58. Note that VVV uses MariaDB not MySQL proper, this stack overflow question should fix it though:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/42385099/1273-unknown-collation-utf8mb4-unicode-520-ci\nSomething along the lines of finding:\n\nENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_520_ci;\n\nand replacing the collation with:\n\nutf8mb4_unicode_ci\n\n@neilgee can you confirm this fixes things?. I see. We don't use MySQL, we use MariaDB, and you can expect to run into these kinds of issues when migrating SQL between database engines if you're using newer features.\nSince this is a MySQL vs MariaDB issue, I'm going to close this. VVV has no control over MariaDB internals.. @shanebp we were made aware of this a while ago, all the dashboard URLs support .test and brand new installs were switched to .test domains.\nSadly, we can't auto-migrate sites built with .dev TLDs over, you'll need to do that manually via WP CLI. Luckily the VVV side of things is easy, adjust your provisioner files if necessary, and add the .test version of the domain to your sites hosts section, then reprovision. As a sidenote, https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1377 prompts users who don't visit .test to switch over.\nWe also warn on every site listed that has a .dev domain, and swapped all the URLs in the provisioning output to .test as well as all the docs. Note that because you never specified which version of PHP, it assumed the latest and installed the PHP 7.1 version, yet you modified the PHP 7.0 ini\nThe following extra packages will be installed:\n  libtidy5 php7.1-common php7.1-tidy\nThe following NEW packages will be installed:\n  libtidy5 php-tidy php7.1-common php7.1-tidy\nInstalling php7.0-tidy, or switching the site to PHP 7.1 should resolve it.\nAs an aside, if you want to install things inside your VM, you're supposed to use a utility. Right now all your installed extras will be nuked when you next rebuild the box. A utility is pretty simple, a git repo with folders containing a provision.sh that runs on provision. Use that to update/install your extensions. First, you don't want to switch to .local, because it has conflicts with zeroconf and bonjour, e.g. for test.local, do we load the VVV site test.local, or the iMac with the name test on the same network? Similarly, .localhost is also protected by an RFC, but forces you to use the loopback, making it less useful.\nInstead, switch to .test. It's protected by an RFC, and you can do anything you want with it.\nIn the meantime, add the .test version of the domains to your sites hosts section under vvv-custom.yml ( or vvv-hosts if you've done it that way ), make sure any custom prpvisioners are setup to use .test when they create/setup new installs, and use WP CLI to search replace .dev to .test.\nSadly, there is no foolproof way to migrate TLD's, as some plugins do stupendously stupid things, e.g. hashing full URLs, breaking things once the domain changes.. @JulieKuehl VVV moved to .test months ago if you're using the develop branch, and in 2.1 if you're using the master branch. Update VVV and visit http://vvv.test. There's an extremely high chance your own copy already supports it.\nAs for individual sites, see above. New installs get default sites at local.wordpress.test etc. We can't auto-convert existing sites as we can't guarantee it will work\n@brograhamer aside from the config, conversion should be a standard WP domain name change, all the steps are exactly the same. But if that doesn't work for you, the docs site was updated with a guide. For that reason I'm closing this out. @rtpHarry you can, but you'd have to set up your own certificate authority, add it to your keychain/trust it in your browser, generate certificates for each site, modify the nginx configs of each site to use said certificate, re-provision VVV, then hopefully chrome will accept it. There may be additional steps required too.\nThere are also hacky ways to get around the issue with Chrome, but they aren't guaranteed to stay the same ( e.g. you used to be able to type dangerous into the tab, but they moved to a new word ). Also keep in mind that there may be other restrictions in place, so I don't know that this will actually resolve the problem, coupled with the lack of docs on the matter\n\nWhy was it so important that they had to break things without taking the time to give us a migration path.\n\nBecause we were never meant to use that domain to begin with, so it serves us right, even if it causes everybody headaches. In hindsight I wish I'd plastered it all over the dashboard a bit more than I did\n\nim grumpy because the only clean way i know to change the url is to use my duplicator plugin\n\nYou should be able to use the WP CLI command built into VVV as indicated in the docs. The self signed certificate that gets generated is more of a hack than a real feature, if I recall, it's something @jeremyfelt did for his own purposes in the earlier days of VVV. There is no guarantee that it will work.\nAlso keep in mind when using .dev there are additional restrictions imposed by Chrome. I'm marking this as wontfix for now, I believe the ideal resolution is the removal of that self signed SSL certificate. Given that it changes on every version update, only applies to certain sites, and doesn't work reliably it doesn't make sense.\nIf you want HTTPS on VVV, create a certificate authority of your own, trust it, then generate certificates for personal use, modifying the sites nginx configs accordingly. > @tomjn what is the best route to \"create a certificate authority of your own\"?\nThere's no official or recommended way to do this at the moment, there's a knowledge gap that hasn't been filled/vetted. All I can say is that for custom SSL you'll want to setup an additional site, rather than using the sites that get provisioned by default\nIn addition, any documentation would need to cover how to make the browsers accept the certificates, they won't accept self signed by default. .test sites still need valid certificates, but .dev sites have special requirements above and beyond just an SSL certificates, with some security options forced to on by the browser itself\n.test is protected by an RFC and is a standard, so it's never going to be bought by a search engine\nAlso, you can always access the dashboard via http://vvv.test. Fixed by https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/varyingvagrantvagrants.org/pull/65 which also swaps the site url setting for a search replace, thanks for the headsup!. Should be fixed, give it a minute or two to update. Thanks for reporting :) I would ask to see your vagrant plugin list, but given you're running 1.9.5, I'd like you to;\n\nhalt the VM\ndownload vagrant 2.0.1, and use the uninstall vagrant tool\ninstall Vagrant 2.0.1 ( there's a potential issue if you don't use the uninstall tool re: bundler )\nreinstall the vagrant triggers/hosts updater plugins\ntest again, and pipe the log output to a file so we can see the results if it doesn't work. You can't install VVV over the top of Chassis, it'll break both VVV and Chassis. You're going to have to clean up the folder, reinstall Chassis, then install VVV in another folder. You also can't run them both at the same time, they'll clash\n\n\nOne thing I didn't try is \"reinstall the vagrant triggers/hosts updater plugins\" as I don't know what that means.\n\nThere should be instructions on the VVV website for installing the vagrant plugins. If you don't have these installed, VVV can't modify your hosts file, hence vvv.test not found.\n  . That sounds significantly more complicated than just copying the file. What exactly are you trying to achieve in your modifications?\nKeeping in mind that the nature of the dashboard may change in the future, the goal is to have more interactive elements to assist users in the creation of sites, which will place a JS angle on things.\nI'd also expect that if the PHP becomes more structured with the intention of templating as this request desires, then it would likely involve either a pure React solution, or moving towards a more modular setup with Silex or another small framework.. @webmandesign can you provide an example use case for this? I'm struggling to think of a use case that couldn't just be made as a pull request to this repo or a custom dashboard. Ah I wish you'd raised that as a feature request, and I can see now why you might want this, at the same time this could well put a spanner in the works by locking the dashboard into its current implementation.\nMy hope in the future is to move the individual sections out into modules, so that those uninterested in certain boxes can disable them. With that you could put your own module in and disable the one it replaces\nI'd also like to think that in the future you could specify an SSL certificate, and the dashboard would pick up on it and change it to https. @webmandesign you can set the dashboard now via vvv-custom.yml in the develop branch:\ndashboard:\n  repo: git repo goes here\n  branch: master. > However, I'm a bit confused now. I understand there is no documentation on this update yet. But it seems to me that there is no way of overriding a single information of the dashboard, only the whole dashboard still.\nThe old dashboard custom code is still there, the repo changes the dashboard subfolder.\n\nFrom what I understand, now you can override the entire dashboard with your own from external repo just by setting it up in vvv-custom.yml file. Am I correct here?\nIf so, how can I only override a specific single block of the dashboard, for example?\n\nSee index.php:\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/blob/develop/www/default/index.php#L8\nif ( file_exists( 'dashboard-custom.php' ) ) {\n    include( 'dashboard-custom.php' );\n    exit;\n}\ninclude( 'dashboard/dashboard-default.php');\nCreate a dashboard-custom.php and make it load all the files the default dashboard does, but with dashboard/ infront on the require statements, and the ones you dislike removed.\n\nMy hope in the future is to move the individual sections out into modules, so that those uninterested in certain boxes can disable them. With that you could put your own module in and disable the one it replaces.\n\nThis was done a while ago, each box is implemented by its own PHP file in a php subfolder\n\nI can see this can not be set in vvv-custom.yml so I dug deeper ;)\nThe new dashboard seems to be provisioned/downloaded from https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/dashboard repo, where blocks are separated. However, I'm unable to find a functionality to override any single block/information there.\nAm I missing something?\n\nThe dashboard at that location is literally the same dashboard, to create it I filtered the repository down to that subfolder then pushed to a new git repo. The only change is that it's now in a different repository. This should make life easier for those working on improvements to the dashboard, and those who use a completely different dashboard\n\nI can also see you have implemented my solution for dashboard too.\nBut I presume this will not make to next VVV release and will be removed in favor of above, right?\n\nThe two coexist, and serve somewhat different purposes.\n\nSo, if you have time, could you please explain how can I override a single block of the dashboard and yet keep it future-proof, meaning whenever a new dashboard layout/design is implemented, I get that too with VVV update, but my block overrides will still apply (I understand I might also need to update my custom block code, which is obviously better than updating whole dashboard code to new version ;) )?\n\nSee the above, however, this new functionality provides a new method:\n\nfork the dashboard\nadd the official dashboard repo as a git remote\ncreate a new branch, and put your changes in there\nmodify vvv-custom.yml to use your forked repo and the branch with changes\n\nThen to update:\n\nfetch the changes\nrebase your branch on to the newly updated master/develop\n\nAt that point you might have a merge conflict or two but this should be insignificant if all your doing is commenting out includes to get rid of blocks\n\nSurely I understand if you don't explain the mechanism here and leave it for the release, no worries!\n\nHappy to help\n\nA few notes on the future\nThe current direction of the dashboard is React based, and that involves a design change. Rather than having everything on the one page, there'll be a sidebar menu, with sites as the first page. I'm undecided if tools should be menu options or on a tools page, but it'll allow the UI to be more focused.\nFor example, in the future, sites will be listed in a single row, with a filter, and only show the hosts, name and description. You'll need to click an expand/settings/info button to show all the other options.\nWhat's more there's no reason some blocks couldn't become dismissable\nTo see a WIP preview, try out the react_dash branch, it's very WIP at the moment though.\n\nNotes on vvv-custom.yml\nI could add dashboard options, but it would complicate PHP code, especially when some of those items are moving to React. It also makes no sense if you choose to use a different dashboard, and a support burden if people use those then get surprised when the default dashboards options don't function\n\nYou can also use a userscript or extension to add CSS to hide the blocks you don't want. It might need IDs adding to the containers, but that sounds like a reasonable thing to add, PR's welcome. Already done in the custom site template, the default site template is deprecated now. That's because the hosts section only contains the main host, and there's no such thing as wildcard DNS in the local hosts file, so how would you machine know to go to VVV for that site?\nIf it were an Nginx issue, then you'd be seeing the VVV dashboard rather than a DNS error\nSo instead, list all the subdomains in your hosts section, and reprovision so they show up in the hosts file. Shared folders were never supported to begin with, but they could be implemented via customfiles if you wanted to take that responsibility which is what you did for VVV 1\n\nSpeaking of documentation, this link seems broken: https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/docs/en-US/adding-a-new-site/custom-public_html/\n\nThanks, Jekyll is very finnicky, but try to keep to the 1 issue per issue rule, I've created a pull request at:\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/varyingvagrantvagrants.org/pull/68\nAll our docs are on GitHub as markdown files in that repo, it may take a few minutes to deploy now that it's been merged\n\n\nThe reason I use NFS is that the standard file sharing system never worked well for me (and afaik it has some limitation when you need to share something like 100 paths)\nAs noted by some maintainers here, NFS is faster as well and should be the default mode on Unix systems\n\n\nIIRC it once did use NFS, but it was changed to fix issues several people were having. I don't remember the specifics\n\nI noticed that the remote site is mapped locally into vvv/www/sitename/public/html... - however I just symlinking my git repos there does not seem to work. If I manually add folders or files there, they will be synced, but I'd really not want to put any git repos there. If I could symlink my directories there, that would be a very acceptable solution. Alternatively, if these shares could be included inside a custom site configuration, that would be great too.\n\nYou'll run into more issues than VVV if you're trying to use Symlinks, WP itself made changes in the past that get in the way of this\n\nI'm aware that VVV 2 can now use repositories to spawn sites, and I guess that could include custom code, plugins, themes etc... It makes no point to use an entire installation / site just for each plugin, I need often to test those in combination and different branches of each. It's unpractical.\n\nModifying the custom site template to allow you to specify which plugins via vvv-custom.yml sounds like the appropriate path here. Eitherway it sounds like you're trying to optimise for disk space.\nA General Note on Custom Files\nThese let you do arbitrary and potentially dangerous things. The feature is there for those people who really know what they're doing. With that in mind we can't support those users here, and I know in my case they likely know more about working with Vagrant files than I do.\nWith that in mind, I can write a doc, but I very much doubt it will be helpful to you. It would explain that the custom files are dangerous, that we can't offer support, adding the flag to a site, and reiterating that we can't support them, as well as warnings that they can mess up their VVV instance in horrific ways.\nIn terms of mapping a specific subfolder such as a theme or a plugin, no, VVV doesn't support that out of the box, and I'm unaware of any plans to do so officially. It's also a little frustrating that people think VVV 1 supported it, it didn't support it out of the box either.. I see 2 feature requests here:\n\nA use_nfs flag in vvv-custom.yml\nconfigurable subfolder mappings\n\nEither should be possible without custom vagrant files if the feature is designed right\nBut as far as custom vagrant files are concerned, no, once you start using these files there's it's unreasonable to expect support. The potential scope explodes and we end up doing general Vagrant support. This isn't the Vagrant project, it's VVV, a local developer environment targeted towards WordPress users.\nIf either of those are features you'd be interested in, I recommend you open a new issue for both. mailcatcher is installed in provision/provision.sh, that would be the place to update it. But first, try to replicate using the latest commit on the develop branch to verify this hasn't already been fixed. mailcatcher_version=\"$(/usr/bin/env mailcatcher --version 2>&1 | grep 'mailcatcher ' | cut -d \" \" -f 2)\"\n  if [[ -n \"${mailcatcher_version}\" ]]; then\n    pkg=\"Mailcatcher\"\n    print_pkg_info \"$pkg\" \"$mailcatcher_version\"\n  else\n    echo \" * Mailcatcher [not installed]\"\n    /usr/bin/env rvm default@mailcatcher --create do gem install mailcatcher --no-rdoc --no-ri\n    /usr/bin/env rvm wrapper default@mailcatcher --no-prefix mailcatcher catchmail\n  fi\nIt could well be that mailcatcher has been updated since you last reprovisioned. A fresh box will probably resolve the problem, but in the meantime if it's already installed, VVV should attempt to update mailcatcher rather than just print out the version. Can you post the diff or do a PR for that change?\nAlso can you provide more information about how things are broken? I understand it doesn't work but you've said nothing about what that means, e.g. Does mailcatcher only show a subset of HTML tags correctly? Does it show raw HTML tags rather than HTML rich output? Does that tab simply not exist for those emails? Does it show the email but with all html elements stripped out?\nDetails, examples and screenshots welcome. Also any output in the JS console. I wonder if a test email block in the dashboard would be useful? Or a debugging block, I'll have a think. Which box did you end up using? Would you be ok doing a PR with the vagrant file change?. > It is a little annoying that VVV is still restricted to VirtualBox 5.0 though. Especially since VirtualBox <5.1.24 doesn't seem to work properly on Windows Insider Builds.\nI'd advise using the latest version, anybody who isn't using the latest who has an issue gets told to use the latest anyway, and it'd be a mammoth task to continuously test all combinations of all platforms and versions of virtualbox.\nI would keep in mind that vmware/hyper-v aren't super supported in the sense that at some point someone needed or wanted to use them, but that's no longer the case. Parallels is only supported because @LoreleiAurora has it\nCan you create a pull request for those changes?. > Latest version of VVV or VirtualBox? I had the latest version of VirtualBox installed (5.2) but it only just dawned on me that I was running on the master branch rather than develop.\nAll of them, VVV master is the current stable release, although develop tends to be quite stable and has more fixes. VVV releases require quite a bit of effort I'm told. It's always assumed you're using the latest VirtualBox and Vagrant. > Vagrant location:\n\nInstalled in home directory ~/dev/vvv\nfiles to vagrant were installed in the vvv directory using:\ngit clone -b master git://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV.git ./\n\nVVV isn't vagrant, vagrant is something VVV uses, you need to install vagrant separately, see vagrantup.com\n\nHyper-V:\nTurned off from the bios as instructed in (https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/docs/en-US/installation/software-requirements/)\n\nHyper V is a windows setting, it doesn't appear in the BIOS, it looks like you've turned off virtualisation, meaning Virtualbox etc will be broken. You need to turn this back on\n  . It's been a while so I'm going to close this one out, but if you're still having issues let us know and I can reopen. I'd install gulp/webpack on the host machine, you should only need to ssh in for WP CLI\nAlso, you should use a Utility to install things like gulp rather than a custom vagrant file. I would note that you only need a single instance of VVV to work on multiple independent sites. Having multiple copies of VVV gets cumbersome and fiddly, and unnecessary\nI'm going to close the issue for now as there's no real way to answer this canonically. There are some versions of 5.2 that have issues with Vagrant 2.0. Which versions I do not know.\nBut if it works for you it works for you, I'm on 5.1.30 myself. So nothing in particular has been done by VVV, the problem was enver that VVV didn't work, but that there were issues deeper down the pipeline in the Vagrant/Virtualbox parts\nWhatever the issue was, it's probably fixed by a newer version of the Virtualbox guest editions, or an updated box. A few questions:\n\nhave you tried putting the provisioning files inside the provision subfolder?\nAre you sure that provisioning completed?\nAre the other sites that come as standard working?\nDoes your my_website site show up in the dashboard?\nAre you using the master branch or the develop branch?\nIs this a git on a zip based install?\n\nIs the new VVV the only vagrant instance running? Or is the old one also running at the same time?. Then I would do the following:\n\n\nRemove my_website.dev, it'll remove the warning, and that URL will have issues anyway\n\nvvv-init.sh isn't necessary, its job is to create the MySQL database and install WP, things you seem to be doing manually. This isn't relevant though, your instance doesn't load the site\nDo a vagrant halt;vagrant up --provision, and check the provisioning log. If something went wrong it will be in there. Ideally getting me a copy would be super helpful\n\nAlso, a random hunch, but can you change my_website to my-website? Both the domain, folder, and site name. The error is right at the end, I would advise against using a full URL as\nthe name of your site but it is hard to tell if that's the issue when\nyou've swapped out letters for xxx to hide things. My current guess is that\nyou have an invalid character in there\nEither way creating the log file it's saying is missing should help. It\nshould end with a direction to visit the dashboard, not an error\nOn Mon, 15 Jan 2018 at 07:25, SVAR7BERG notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nOkay, so I hope this is enough as I realized too late that I have to\nincrease the consoles buffer.\nI first did \"vagrant halt\" and then \"vagrant up --provision\" (btw, is it\nnormal that starting VVV and provisioning takes up to 15 minutes???)\n==>

Interesting, this is likely because the custom site template repo was added on top of a site that already exists. That nginx config specifies logs in the logs folder, which didn't exist.\n\nI'm going to close this now that things are working. Nice catch, thanks :). Eh it's merged so there's nothing to close :). Vagrant hosts updater is what modifies the hosts file. VVV doesn't touch it itself, and only does what the hosts updater file requires\nInstead, this looks like an XY problem, where you come up with solution Y to problem X, then ask about a problem with Y, rather than how to do X. So I'm going to address X instead, \"How do I avoid having to type a password in/start an admin console every time I vagrant up/halt?\"\nThe answer is:\n\nyou either run vagrant as an administrator via sudo, or keep the elevated priv console open\nor you modify the permissions of the hosts file so that elevated priviledges aren't necessary\n\nThe latter is easier on non-Windows systems, I don't know how you would do it though.\nAs for your original question, copy paste the hosts entries out of the hosts file, then paste them back in without the vagrant comments. This leads to new problems however:\n\nvagrant will still try to modify the hosts file\nif succesful you'll end up with duplicates\nthere's no guarantee that the IP it uses will remain the same\n\nAs an additional note, you're using vbox 5.2.2 but 5.2.6 is available.\n\nPersonally, I start VVV then leave it running. It turns itself off when my battery is <5% or I reboot to install an OS update. There's no reason for me to have multiple instances of VVV, and it's lightweight enough that I just leave it on all the time. One possible alternative is to use a custom DNS server, but I don't know how you would set that up, it would be separate to VVV. There's also this, which might remove the need for an elevated command prompt:\nhttps://superuser.com/a/1003991/21807\nNote that there are security consequences as any app can now write to your hosts file. I'm not sure about terminal changes like this, part of me thinks they should be a utility, or a personal thing to setup as people have different needs and preferences\nFor example, I have my own prompt I prefer with various features not normally found at https://github.com/tomjn/bashosx. rather than also the root users account? I don't know, but if you're needing to sudo su inside a vagrant shell, chances are you're going far beyond VVV's scope, or doing something wrong that should really be done via a utility ( e.g. installing and configuring extra software, it's all going to disappear if you need to recreate the box, not an issue if you use a Utility ). A little further googling indicated that this is a certificate authority issue, likely a network dropout or disruption of some sorts. Reprovisioning will probably do the trick, but without further information it isn't possible to help. You provided no logs and it isn't clear at which point this happened as a result\nSince I asked for more details in February, and it's April now, with no response, I'm going to mark this as closed. If you're still trying to use this, comment back with the additional info. Further checking indicates:\nbranch = `if [ -f #{vagrant_dir}/.git/HEAD ]; then git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD; else echo 'novcs'; fi`\nIf it was a zip based install it would say v2.2.0-novcs, which suggests your initial git clone of VVV was either incomplete, or your working copy has been corrupted or modified somehow. Try checking out the develop branch and undoing any changes. As a side note, there are primitive WIP docs for HyperV, though they say nothing you don't already know. Anything learned will need to be added to them:\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/varyingvagrantvagrants.org/pull/56/files. @mdecurtins this is in a shell with elevated admin privileges correct? Are SMB shares enabled?Running Get-SmbServerConfiguration in powershell should tell you\nAlso, VVV switches the synced folders to use SMB here:\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/blob/develop/Vagrantfile#L379\nCommenting that out may prove helpful. I'm not sure why the shares are turned into SMB shares in the vagrant file, but I would recommend disabling that line and retrying so that they're normal vagrant shared folders, not SMB shared folders. That would be a destructive action, but also an ambiguous one.\nFor example, if a repo field changes, should it:\n\nremove the folder and reclone\nadd the new repo value as a remote origin and do a git pull\n\nThe former is your scenario, but what if I moved my repo elsewhere? And what about the unversioned files in that folder, such as the uploads folder?\n\nI have had to create a process where a github access token is passed through the REPO url. We often regenerate these temporary tokens, but updating the REPO parameter does not work during a provision and it prevents any future provisions from running properly.\n\nYou can specify a github token already, see #1417 . As an aside, if that's not an option, you can use git itself to change the remote origin, using git rm origin; git remote add newurlgoeshere.\nNote that VVV can't automate this either as not every repository or user prefers the origin, so the action may be destructive. > #1417 only sets a token for COMPOSER, we do not use composer, we use WP-CLI and Git to pull in our resources. This solution is not viable.\nhmm not what I expected, I wonder if that's something that can be alleviated?\n\nHow am I supposed to use VVV to with private github repos as in the REPO url?\n\nIs an SSH key based authentication not an option? VVV should be using key forwarding which is what I use for private repositories\n\nWhy should you have to remove the folder and reclone if the repo changes? the repo simply identifies the source of a provision. (This destroys any changes you are currently working on).\n\nVVV does a git clone, but fundamentally this just creates a local git repository that then immediatley pulls from the remote source and creates a working copy of the default branch. So I'm unsure what you mean, but I suspect you mean:\n\nremove the origin remote\nre-add it using the new repo value and the name origin\nSet the master branch to track the master branch on origin\nDo a git fetch followed by a hard reset to eliminate any local changes\n\n\nHowever, I have a different solution in mind that might work out better for you:\n\nDon't put the private repo in your VVV config, instead, put a second repo in your config, based off of the custom site template\nAs part of this second repos provisioning script, make it git clone your private repo into the appropriate place\nMake the script pull a gh_token custom value from vvv-custom.yml\n\nThis can be done using get_config_value, for example, this is how the vvv-init.sh of the custom site template fetches the version of WP to install:\nWP_VERSION=`get_config_value 'wp_version' 'latest'`\nBy using this instead:\nGH_TOKEN=`get_config_value 'gh_token' 'token_missing'`\nand this:\nsites:\n    mysite:\n      repo: ....\n      gh_token: <token goes here>\nYou can then git clone and append the token to the URL. You can also compare the URL to the value of git config --get remote.origin.url, and if they differ, you can then remove the origin remote, re-add it with the new URL, then do your git pull and reset.\nOfcourse all of this is a non-issue if you can SSH into GitHub, then you can use standard SSH key authentication which should work with private repos. As long as this is set up on the host machine it should carry forwards on to the guest machine. >  (This destroys any changes you are currently working on).\nAlso, this would be a problem, destructive changes inevitably means somebody does something and this happens unexpectedly, losing work. It's similar to composer updates destroying any local changes that might have happened in a package when it's updated, there's a lot of angry people on the composer GH issue tracker. > Where is this documented? I've never been able to get SSH to work with VVV.\nSSH key forwarding is enabled by default, if it works on your host machine it should work in your VM too. Follow the steps to get SSH based auth working with GitHub on your machine, then reprovision VVV. This isn't documented in VVV because it's a general SSH thing, see https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/\n\nThis solution requires 2 repositories per provision. A public and a private, that would be painful to manage.\n\nIf that's so then half the repos would be identical, so why not just have 1 and use different keys for different repo values?\n\nWith your private repos, which you say works with SSH access, its able to pull private repos as VVV config repos?\n\nYes, SSH eliminates the need for GH auth tokens. As long as SSH based authentication works on your host, it should pass the keys to the guest VM machine via SSH Agent key forwarding. Failing that you can set up an SSH key inside the VM. SSH based auth is far superior to auth tokens. You would likely get better results from the custom site template, there is an issue open for modifying the add new site instructions to use that as the primary recommended method, and move the existing docs to a more advanced page in #1416 \nIn the meantime, what does the public_html folder contain?. hmmm, that isn't right, and I can see now why it might do that\nSince these instructions are all based on the custom site template, and the custom site template gives you exactly what you wanted, I'd recommend you use this instead:\ncagross:\n    repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template.git\n    hosts:\n      - cagross.test\nOr at the very least, take the vvv-init.sh that the custom site template uses. the custom site template doesn't have a pre-created public_html folder. All these instructions are based on the custom site template, so you should use that as the reference of what you should do. it sounds like a formatting error in vvv-custom.yml, specifically, things are not indented correctly, indenting is significant in YAML. Thanks! I didn't realise that if you made that mistake in the config file it would provision like that. The failed to provision message assumes the install script failed and it's loading the dashboard because it's the nginx default. @cagross I've changed around the install instructions, can you give an opinion on https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/varyingvagrantvagrants.org/pull/71 ?

I hear what you are saying. But are you able to point me to any links that might help me add SSL to my VVV site--maybe one that has helped you in the past? I would imagine many people before me would have encountered this issue.\n\nI don't have a reference I can hand to you, I've personally not tried to follow any in a long time so I can't vouch for an article. But if I did you'd be sure I'd paraphrase it into an SSL page under references on the docs\n\nAs an alternative, would I be able to add the SSL certificate to my remote site, yet leave it unchanged on my VVV site? Would there be any issues if I did that?\n\nYou definitely should switch to https for your production site, and I would expect you could download the certificate letsencrypt gives you then modify vvv-nginx.conf/vvv-nginx.conf.tmpl to use that certificate, I would expect that to work. Of course it would need to be an additional site using the custom site template, rather than the ones that are setup when you first provision VVV ( those are under the default SSL certificate, which needs removing ). There's a security risk of doing that, but if you're sure your local environment is secure from prying eyes and isn't shared beyond your machine then that should be ok ( and you'll need to re-download the certificate regularly, letsencrypt certificates don't last long )\n\nOne potential issue I see with that is in the database sync between the two sites. Namely, if I migrate to SSL on my web server, part of the process would involve a global search and replace of the database on the remote site (i.e. roughly speaking, I would replace all http strings with https). But I would just lose these changes after the next VVV edit, since the edit would entail pushing my local VVV database to my remote database. I'm not sure how to resolve that.\n\nIs a WXR import/export an option? I see the issue here, SSL is indeed on the agenda, a lot of people have popped up the last 2-3 weeks asking about it, so hopefully this can be wrangled soonish\n\nWould I be able to carry out the same http-->https search and replace on my VVV site? If so, then I guess the two databases would remain in-sync, alleviating the issue I described.\n\nThere's all the usual methods available inside the VVV VM, I'd suggest WP CLI search replace. I don't know how viable converting from https to http for local then back again via search replace to https is. It's probably doable, but it's not something I've had to do before\n\nI'm not sure what WXR import/export is. I've never heard of it :-/\n\nThe WP importer/exporter generates WXR files. @cagross changes have been made:\n\nUpdate to the latest VVV develop\nAdd tls-ca under core: to the utilities section, as shown here\nReprovision\n\nIf you're using the wordpress-develop or custom site templates, visit your site and switch to https. The first time you visit it will complain, but you should be able to skip.\nOnce reprovisioned, you can also go to certificates/ca/cert.crt. Add this to your keychain on MacOS/Accept the certificate as an authority in Windows/etc, and restart your browser. Now all VVV sites using the custom site template support https, with no warnings. WIP docs here https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/varyingvagrantvagrants.org/pull/73. @cagross this just makes VVV serve valid certificates, so you can use https, your WP site will still generate http URLs for links etc, afterall a certificate authority does not reach into WordPress and change the home and site URLs from http to https. Same way that handing you a secure phone line allows you to talk about secret stuff, but it's no guarantee that's what you're going to talk about.\nBeyond this point, there's no difference between VVV and any other local environment, or server to server migration from your point of view, but my recommendation is to use this and verify it loads via https for you, then switch all your sites over.. > This is a required step, not a merely suggested step--correct? Not complaining or anything, but I just want to be sure.\nIf you don't do this, every new site you provision will throw up a security error when you first open them, but you can dismiss it and it won't show again in that browser\nIf you do it though, it will never happen and any new site will just work automatically.. You can switch to the develop branch as you would any other git repo like this:\ngit checkout develop\ngit pull. Yeah, vvv-custom.yml, vvv-config.yml is just the default. That looks like a new unrelated problem, can you open an issue for it? It looks like a WP CLI problem, have you made any changes to that sites wp-config.php?. No, but the error mentioned looked like a PHP issue, and the CA changes didn't touch WP CLI at all. It looks like a database is missing. @cagross at this point it's just a standard http -> https transition, nothing VVV specific. It looks like VVV is serving things with https fine, you just need to make WP use it\nSee this article on the WP specific steps:\nhttps://css-tricks.com/moving-to-https-on-wordpress/\nYou can skip step 1, that was the VVV certificate authority part. Also WP CLI search replace will be far more effective than the sql queries. This one uses WP CLI, https://helgeklein.com/blog/2015/01/switching-wordpress-site-http-https/\nThere's a lot of tutorials/articles out there using different tools to accomplish roughly the same thing. Re-read the issue/docs, you have to accept the certificate authority on your OS, else your browser will kick up a fuss the first time it encounters it. It's kicking up a fuss because it doesn't recognise the custom certificate authority VVV setup to create the certificates. If you accept that authority, it will accept the certificates it creates without question. If you don't accept the certificate, it will warn you every time it encounters a new certificate, and you have to say it's ok each time on a case by case basis. > If so, since I am on Windows, what exactly are the steps here?\nNo idea, I'm a Mac user, at this point I'm just acting as a proxy for google\n\nI can open the folder certificates/ca, but to be clear, I see a file ca.crt, not cert.crt. Is ca.crt the file you mean?\n\nProbably, I'm mostly going from memory\n\nAnd what exactly do you mean by \"Accept the certificate as an authority in Windows?\" What does that entail exactly?\n\nCertificates come from certificate authorities, which have root certificates. Browsers and operating systems have a list of these root authorities, this way they know if certificates are real or not, because they're signed by those root authorities. That's why you don't get this error for letsencrypt certificates, or when you visit sites with https, their certificates were signed by a known and trusted root authority. VVV isn't in that list, so you have to add it. VVV creates a brand new CA from scratch on provision, that's not been seen before, so you have to tell your OS to trust it. If you don't, you'll get those invalid CA warnings each time it encounters a new certificate.\nHow you would do that is platform specific. VVV provides a root certificate, but how you would accept that in your OS is specific to that OS. I don't know the Windows steps, but you've already done all the VVV specific bits you need to do. Adding the VVV CA is an optional but recommended step, but you'll have to figure that part out on your own, I can't give a generic catch all platform agnostic answer, and I don't know enough about Windows to be able to give you an answer or know if something I find via Google is correct or not\nLikewise, now that your VVV sites have HTTPS certificates, you have to make WP use it. Just as somebody who knows how to speak french and english needs telling to use french if that's what you want them to speak in. You WP site is speaking english, and needs telling to speak french, to use that analogy. If it isn't it'll kick up a fuss and the adding won't work, it looks correct though. The tls-ca utility doesn't touch WP, it only provisions certificates, this is an unrelated issue, and unlikely a VVV one. Indeed, if you don't specify the SSL certificate in the nginx config, it'll fallback to the default.\nThe custom site template does this by putting placeholders in the config template:\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template/blob/master/provision/vvv-nginx.conf.tmpl#L12\nThen swapping them out in vvv-init.sh:\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template/blob/master/provision/vvv-init.sh#L57. As an aside:\nIf you have an issue with SSL:\n\nMake sure you're running latest versions of everything\nDouble check you're running the latest versions\nCheck the docs\nCreate a new issue. The custom site template doesn't support this, but you can do this in a fork of that by modifying vvv-provision.sh, I would note however this:\n\n\nif no backup exists download it from git\n\nThe git repo is already cloned into that folder, so no download is necessary\nAs for backups, look at the place vagrant triggers makes them, the VVV folder is mapped to /vagrant. I can't comment as to other site templates though such as https://github.com/JPry/vvv-base, I'd recommend opening an issue there as they might already support that. it's in the provision subfolder of the site, be sure to fork the repository and change vvv-custom.yml though, you don't want to encounter merge conflicts when VVV tries to pull down the latest official custom site template.\nCheck the docs too, the site templates section details how this all works in much greater detail. Has this worked in the past? Does this redirect for all requests or only those handled by WordPress? To test that try loading the readme.html. Hello!\nCan you switch to the develop branch and retry?\nI also see that there's no branch mentioned in the VVV splash:\n\u001b[38;5;196mVarying \u001b[38;5;118mVagrant \u001b[38;5;33mVagrants \u001b[38;5;129mv2.1.0-\n  \u001b[0mDocs:       https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/\nI would expect to see:\n\u001b[38;5;196mVarying \u001b[38;5;118mVagrant \u001b[38;5;33mVagrants \u001b[38;5;129mv2.1.0-master\n  \u001b[0mDocs:       https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/\nIs your git clone in a normal state? Let me know how a fresh provision goes with develop. Just a standard git switch branch\ngit checkout develop\ngit pull. Ruby/Vagrant control/direct the VM, but they're not responsible for the running of the VM. To force end the VM the way you're trying you need to enter VirtualBox, and use the VirtualBox control to stop the VM.\nI noticed again that there is no branch mentioned in your VVV splash, which version of git are you using? As an aside, what's the output of git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD?\nJudging from that log output, VVV is running, it's just the final trigger that's frozen, in theory you should be able to just open a new terminal tab and pretend it finished succesfully\nOn that trigger, is a script that's designed to let users of custom files run scripts, do you have a custom vagrant file or custom scripts in the config/home_bin folder?. https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/commit/454e20ec9f244749f232c671817c6e0dd7d3f5df now logs output if there are custom scripts present, if you git pull it should say so if this is the case. > So if I git pull, there should be an output mentioning that I have a custom script if so? That code looks like it outputs on vagrant halt, vagrant up, vagrant suspend, and vagrant destroy. Anyways, here's the output of git pull:\nNope, when you vagrant up, if there's a post up script, it'll now say it's going to run it rather than just running it\n\nI'm now getting a 500 internal server error on http://syracusesedationandfamilydentistry.test/, dunno if it's related. But I removed that site initially from vagrant-local\\www and had the provision recreate it. \n\na 500 error indicates something went wrong, check the PHP logs to find out what it is, so look in the logs subfolder of that site to find out which it is\n\nAlso, in vvv-custom.yml I have nginx_upstream: php71, which don't have in the yml file for the other sites. That site definitely needs to run php 7.\n\nDid you add php71 to the utilities section? If you don't, VVV doesn't know to install it. btw you can use triple back tick to start a code block, and again to end it. > I hadn't added php71 to the utilites section. So that's obviously the source of these errors.\n\nSo I reprovisioned. Everything is running correctly, and just like you said.\n\nAwesome, it'd be good to have VVV check for that and warn, but I can't think of a way off the top of my head, any suggestions for the docs on making that clearer?\n\nI'm still trying to figure out why however it gets stuck on triggers. I wouldn't mind except I have to basically restart my machine everytime I want to reload, reprovision, or stop it because most of the time when stopping 'ruby' and 'vagrant' processes AND shutting down the VM via virtual box I still can't run any vagrant commands.\n\nI'm curious, at any point did you upgrade straight from Vagrant 1.x to 2.x without uninstalling and installing afresh?\nAlso it might be a long shot, but try:\nvagrant plugin repair\nvagrant plugin update\nIn the meantime, this is unexpected vagrant output at the start:\nvagrant : -f was unexpected at this time.\nAt line:1 char:1\n+ vagrant halt\n+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~\n    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (-f was unexpected at this time.:String)  \n   [], RemoteException\n    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : NativeCommandError\nCan you modify `` so that instead of:\nif [[ -f /home/vagrant/bin/vagrant_halt_custom ]]; then\n    echo \"Executing vagrant_halt_custom\"\n    vagrant_halt_custom\nelse\n    db_backup\nfi\nit's just:\ndb_backup\nAnd see if vagrant halt still gives that notice at the top?

Don't use Powershell ISE. In principle yes... in practice it's a little more complicated.\n\nThe problem here is that it'll open things up to adding extra folders, and having a lot of hardcoded of items, so:\n\na generic way to specify these\na way to specify both the local_dir and vm_dir not jsut the local_dir. Marking this as closed as it's an advanced topic, and mounting shares has a performance cost. You can use your own dashboard by adding the following to vvv-custom.yml:\n\ndashboard:\n  repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/dashboard.git\n  branch: react_dash\nIt's not documented as it was added to develop very recently and this is how I would recommend doing it, as you can pull down updates, make your customizations in a new branch, and rebase it onto master to bring in the updates\nYou can also create a custom loader file, the dashboard bootstrap tries to load the main dashboard file from the dashboard subfolder, but if you instead create a custom file, it will load that instead. From there you can copy paste the contents of the main dashboard file into it, add the extra dashboard/ folder to the includes, then remove/add as necessary.\nThis is the code that loads the dashboard in www/default/index.php:\n```\nif ( file_exists( 'dashboard-custom.php' ) ) {\n    include( 'dashboard-custom.php' );\n    exit;\n}\ninclude( 'dashboard/dashboard-default.php');\n```\nHowever, I'm more interested in the need to tag and categorize. Especially given that the future development direction of the dashboard is leaning heavily towards a React UI, so I wonder if doing something like the following would be more useful:\ngutenberg:\n    repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template\n    skip_provisioning: false\n    hosts:\n      - gutenberg.test\n    tags:\n      - core\n      - testing\nThen surfacing those in the dashboard? Perhaps as badges with the tag name inside and an auto-generated colour?. Some extra notes\n\nAlso is it possible to customize the dashboard? Set the ordering, add dividers, add additional links to each box, add items to sidebar etc? Didn't find anything about this in the docs.\n\n\nFiltering of the sites list is planned in the React UI\nNot sure where you would want to add dividers, but the plan is to add a sidebar menu and move a lot of things onto brand new pages, rather than having it all on the same screen\nI'm not sure which additional links you'd want to add to boxes, can you ellaborate? I guess a custom dashboard section could be read that takes a label/url pair and adds it under a custom box\nAdding things to the sidebar can be done via the dashboard-custom.php but as I mentioned, that sidebar is going away in the future\n\nAs far as documentation is concerned, I intend to document both methods for replacing the dashboard, but I trust anybody working on a custom dashboard knows basic PHP and can surmise the rest from reading the code.\nI'd also prefer that people make modifications that are general enough to feed back to VVV, rather than sitting on local machines unshared. You don't need to customise the dashboard if your customisations make it into VVV core. test.php in your example does not load the WP environment, so anything in your wp-config.php is irrelevant. The file is self contained and standalone.\nI would strongly advise against using a standalone PHP file this way in general, especially one placed in the theme ( functionality goes in plugins ). Instead, use a custom WP CLI command\nAlso note that the print_r in this code does nothing:\n// this:\nerror_log( print_r( 'TESTING CRON', true ) );\n// is the same as:\nerror_log( 'TESTING CRON' );\nAs for the mail, just because you piped stdout to /dev/null doesn't mean you piped stderrtoo. This is a general bash question though, not VVV specific, but to save searching, try &>/dev/null instead of >/dev/null, or consider piping to a /vagrant/cron.log file instead.\nJust be mindful that the cron job will only run while the VM runs and your computer is awake and active. Additionally, you'll need to set it up again if you ever recreate the VM. Can you show the exact output? It's possible it's vagrant hosts updater\nAlso can you confirm you are not using Powershell ISE but a standard elevated command prompt/elevated powershell? Also is this a new machine? Has it worked before without this issue? Where there errors in the provisioner output? Can you share the output in a gist?. hmmm I'm unfamiliar with ConEmu, but glad that just pressing enter works for you\nAs an aside, does vagrant ssh also ask for a password?\n\n-f was unexpected at this time.\n\nDoes this happen for all vagrant commands? Even those ran outside of VVV? e.g. vagrant --version ran in the main D: drive folder?. hmmm did you provision the box with 2.0.1 originally?. hmmm personal/wordpress-clients: is an unusual name, I did not expect that / was valid in YAML as a key, nor is it how this was envisioned to work for subfolders. Is there a reason you didn't use the local_dir and vm_dir keys?\nCan you verify that you have the vagrant-hostsupdater plugin installed, and that there are no applications interfering with the hosts file, such as gas mask etc? And that clients.wordpress.test appears in your hosts file?\nAlso are there any errors when provisioning? I notice there is no log of the vagrant up --provision. Also does the custom site template work for a new site? It would be much simpler than manually recreating everything it does in folders. > I didn't have the hostsupdater plugin installed.\nThat's the problem, hosts updater and triggers are needed for all VVV functionality to work\n\nOnce I did and I reprovisioned the sites started to work, but the clients.wordpress.test site is redirecting to the dev.wordpress.test site for some reason.\n\nThey both have the same vvv-init.sh, so they both install to the same DB. I'm going to take a wild guess and say that dev.wordpress.test got installed first.\nI'd strongly recommend just using the custom site template as a base and forking it for any custom items you want. I mean literally copying/forking it and using it as a starting point, or just using it to create the site then having a theme or plugins git repo inside the site you work in, it's better than reinventing the wheel for every client.\nTemplates are intended to be reusable, think of them as a foundation you apply rather than an instance you use. All my sites on my local VVV instance are custom site template sites. Inside those folders I have other git repos for various packages and themes, and if I need a git repo that manages an entire site, I'll either fork the custom site repo, or have the repo track just wp-content and clone it into a custom site template. Rewriting the provisioner script and nginx from scratch is unnecessary. Does navigating in into the symlinked directory via vagrant ssh work as expected? Is there a particular reason that requires a src folder outside of public_html?. > or where to put code like this i my project with VVV2 because I am pretty sure it's in reference to VVV1\nThat would be custom vagrantfile code, if you're happy to use that then it's expected you know your way around Vagrant itself, well enough that you would be able to figure it out from reading VVV's vagrantfile\nAs an aside, have you considered a plugins and themes git repo that gets git cloned on provision?\nAlso, are you creating the symlinks on the host machine, or in the guest VM? Have you considered git ignoring wp-admin, wp-content/uploads, and wp-includes instead?. For general development I would advise against symlinks, but it seems that symlinks in shared folders are disabled by default in VirtualBox + Vagrant for security reasons. Enabling it involves Vagrant changes, I'd strongly advise against it\nThe solution here is more likely to involve process and workflow.\n\nThe reason for not just ignoring those and working from within the theme folder is that in my vvv-init.sh file I am pulling a fresh install of wordpress using wp-cli.\n\nI don't follow how this has an impact on things. The Custom Site Template uses WP CLI too, and it ignores the public_html folder, yet I'm still able to clone additional repos in wp-content and work with them.\nYou can install WP via CLI and still only gitignore the wp-admin wp-includes wp-content/uploads and root files. This seems like an extreme amount of effort to avoid having to copy paste multiple entries into .gitignore. ls in a fresh WP install should get you most of the entries\n\nUpdate my vvv-custom.yml file with a new site. (this pulls from a private bitbucket repo)\n\nI see no issue here, key forwarding is enabled, if you can git clone on the host you should be able to git clone in the provisioner\n\nrun composer install which installs my plugins\n\nYou can do this in vvv-init.sh too, composer should be present inside the VM\n\nnpm install which installs all dependencies\n\nAgain, the WP dev template does this, I don't see the issue\n\nnpm start to start my webpack / scripts.\n\nSame as above\nAside from your initial build scripts composer.json and package.json etc themes and plugins should all be git repos anyway, so the gitignore should be irrelevant for them as they'll have their own gitignore files. I'm going to mark this as closed for now, as symlinking isn't encouraged and alternative solutions to these problems exist. In addition, the vagrant docs suggest that symlink support on synced folders is inconsistent across platforms, and that while it attempts to make things play nice, this isn't always met with success:\nhttps://www.vagrantup.com/docs/synced-folders/basic_usage.html#symbolic-links\nBut, if you're trying to take a folder that the VM can't access that isn't inside an already shared folder, then symlink it into one that is shared, I don't see why that would work. I would expect Vagrant to convert the symlink so that when the VM's OS looked at it, the locations would be changed around. Instead it probably sees a host path which is foreign to it and has no idea what to do with it, similar to the math problem \"5 +5 + well I had a nice cup of tea - 3 = ?\". Either that, or Vagrant itself picks up that it isn't possible to map it and stops trying.

Thoughts on the deprecation of wordpress-develop in favour of custom-site-develop:\n\nWhat if we modify the provisioner to insert an MU plugin that puts a notice in the admin bar warning the site template is deprecated and linking to migration instructions?\nWe'll need migration instructions, though I'd expect anybody doing core dev could do it themselves\nWe'll need to change the vvv-config.yml so new users get custom-site-develop\nThe vvv mu plugin that lets you fast switch from src to build will need to go away :(\nA notice in the dashboard would probably be helpful\nVisiting src will give a wp_die with a warning, instead perhaps we should modify the nginx config to redirect to the trac ticket or a doc? Maybe serve a static html file instead?. >  I agree that you can expect current core devs to be able to do the migration themselves.\n\nGiven that VVV gets installed on contributor days, I'm keen to make sure VVV is usable out of the box for this, if only for inclusivity and to help first time contributors. @pento I can't see anything in the GB scripts of note other than a docker call and a splash screen with some checks for existing tools, are you saying Core development will be using a docker container in future? Or that VVV is no longer to be used for core dev?. This should be resolved in https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template-develop/pull/5. hmmm nothing that comes to mind, you good to do a PR on custom-site-template and custom-site-template-develop?. awesome :D. hmmm this would need to be documented, and shared folders are an iffy thing, how does this work?. The root VVV folder is mounted at /vagrant inside the VM, just vagrant ssh then cp /tmp/cachegrind.out.1521537539 /vagrant and it'll appear in your VVV folder. Note that htaccess is for Apache severs and VVV uses Nginx, have you tried setting those values from within PHP in wp-config.php? You shouldn't need to modify php.ini, but if you did it would impact all VVV sites. PHP is installed via a utility, I don't believe there's a way via vvv-custom.yml to replace the php.ini. Modifying it inside the VM will work but changes won't persist between provisions.\nKeep in mind though that different versions of PHP will have different php.ini files, and modifying them will change it for all sites using that version of PHP. I don't foresee this changing even with a custom php.ini option.\nFor now I'd recommend using ini_set in wp-config.php for site specific changes -\n https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.ini-set.php. > which of the four changeable modes does that correspond to?\nI don't know, you'd have to look it up on php.net, but the table on that page seems to have the answer so I don't understand. Eitherway that's not a VVV thing. Does this happen with the develop branch? Does a system reboot help?. Yes, the next step would always be to see if it happens on the develop branch too.\nOther things to note:\n\nDo you have an unusual or non-standard network configuration? VPNs? Proxies\nHave you ever had a working instance of a VirtualBox or Vagrant machine? VVV or otherwise?\nAre there any other VMs running?\nDo you have security software that might be blocking this? Such as Firewalls or antivirus?\n\n\nCould it be a wifi problem, or network setup on osx ?\n\nYes, but this is rare, and if that is what's happening then the amount of support that can be given over the internet isn't going to be very much. In these situations the problem is hyper specific to the person with the issue, either because of software installed, config options set long ago, or network security policies.\nAs for troubleshooting guides, there's what's on the main VVV docs site, but given that network errors happen immediately, none of VVV has even started yet.\nMy initial instinct would be to destroy and recreate the box, see starting from fresh here. > The old sites that I've setup last week are still working. The provisioning from the new sites didn't work.\nAh so this is an existing VVV instance that has been working in the past? Let me know how it goes with the develop branch. > Another weird thing, when I do the vagrant destroy, I get that weird SSH error. I don't suppose it's normal?\nThat's just triggers, I assume you halted the VM before running vagrant destroy?\n\ndefault: Error: The site you have requested is not installed.\ndefault: Run wp core install to create database tables.\ndefault: Adding domains to the virtual machine's /etc/hosts file...\ndefault:  * Added local.wordpress.dev from /srv/www/cyber/provision/vvv-hosts\ndefault:  * Added local.wordpress.test from /srv/www/cyber/provision/vvv-hosts\ndefault:  * Added cyber.test from /vagrant/vvv-custom.yml\ndefault:  * Restarting nginx nginx\n\nI presume this is from the provisioning of cyber.test? It sounds like a previous attempt to run that sites vvv-init.sh installed a copy of WordPress but didn't finish the setup step. I'm assuming cyber.test uses the custom-site-template, not wordpress-default? Deleting that site from the file system then re-provisioning should fix that, or manually installing\n\nProblem: Could not load the site, this implies that provisioning the site failed, please check there were no errors during provisioning, and reprovision.\nNote, sometimes this is because provisioning hasn't finished yet, if it's still running, wait and refresh the page. If that doesn't fix the issue, see here for troubleshooting steps\n\nThe dashboard is the default thing nginx serves. If it's served on a different domain then this shows up, as its the dashboard that gets loaded if something doesn't provision, e.g. if something fails during the sites vvv-init.sh run. Probably related to your previous attempts to provision. >     repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-wordpress-default.git\nThere's your problem, vvv-wordpress-default is legacy/deprecated. New installs use custom-site-template. This is because that repo only works for the default site, it isn't flexible enough to handle different URLs and setups\nFollow the instructions here:\nhttps://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/docs/en-US/adding-a-new-site/. No problem, what you did makes sense to do from first appearances, hopefully this kind of stuff can be flagged automatically by VVV, it's just figuring out how to do that. Yes, switch to the develop branch and follow the instructions. > i think i should have asked is even if it supports ssl certs for https. does it turn into a green padock I have seen other local environemtns allows you to do that.\n\nThey're just SSL certificates, using a custom certificate authority specific to your machine. All SSL certificates do that, and if they don't it's because they're invalid\nIf you're trying to generate free SSL certificates for a production/live website then you're doing it wrong, the custom CA needs whitelisting so those certificates are only for local development, and you shouldn't be running VVV in a non-local environment anyway. Use letsencrypt for SSL certificates on production websites.\nAt the moment I'd suggest you just try it out. You need to be on the develop branch, the certificate authority utility was only recently created\nIf you don't add the root certificate, it'll warn when you visit https URLs for the first time, but once dismissed it'll never pop up again, so that step is optional\nAlso, just because VVV can serve https doesn't mean WP knows to use it. You still have to migrate your sites over. > sorry to keep bugging you on this, even if i did exactly what the instruction said and what you mention, but copying for example trulyawesomeness.test cert to the trusted root certificate\nOnly the CA certificate can be copied over, copying the individual sites is insufficient, and isn't what the instructions say to do:\n\nAll the site certificates are signed by the root certificate, hence accepting the certificate authority root certificate, not the site certificate. Adding the certificates in any of the other folders won't work, those are not root certificates.\n\n, it still won't let me get the padlock (green), so im not sure how you did it, but i probably am missing something or something rather. I think the article doesn't really explain on how to get it to work, it just expect us to know how. but i guess i understand why. even if i add the root certificate not sure which one but its still says not secure.\n\nYou didn't add the root certificate though, you added individual site certificates. But as I mentioned, adding the root certificate is 100% optional.\nHowever, I suspect this has more to do with your browser:\n\nWhich browser are you using?\nIf you don't see what I saw in the screenshot above, what do you see?\nWhat is the error message?\nWhat does not having the green padlock prevent you from doing?\n. The root certificate doesn't represent a site, it represents the certificate authority, and signs each site, it should be named VVV INTERNAL CA:\n\n\n. \nWhich should result in the above once it's trusted. Note that I never told it to trust the simon.test certificate. My OS trusts the VVV INTERNAL CA root certificate. simon.test is trusted and gets the green padlock because its certificate is signed by the root certificate which I told my computer to trust. The exact steps for how to do this are operating system specific, you will need to consult google, and may differ from version to version.\nIf I don't tell me computer to trust the root certificate, it'll warn my the first time I visit simon.test, but only once. I can dismiss the warning and it will never appear again.. \nWhich should result in the above once it's trusted. Note that I never told it to trust the simon.test certificate.

According to https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder cmder can emulate multiple varieties of shell, which one is yours set to use? I cannot vouch for vagrant running correctly on all of them, and I'm unfamiliar with thecmder` application.

Also, do you have any software that might be interfering or restoring the hosts file? E.g. if you try to vagrant up while running gas mask on MacOS, Gas Mask overwrites the hosts updater changes. Security software such as a firewall or antivirus could be doing this, or custom DNS software. And can you confirm that you're running in an admin/elevated privilege command prompt?. Interesting, in that case it's probably a vagrant hostsupdater issue then, we should look into getting that command into the docs along with extending the troubleshooting section\n\nI'm going to mark this as closed for now. btw if someone with these issues can open a ticket on that repository so it gets fixed? I suspect the project maintainers are unawares. Reopening to prevent duplicate issues, opened an issue with hostsupdater at https://github.com/cogitatio/vagrant-hostsupdater/issues/160. Closing this as there's nothing we can do from the VVV side. Looks like you've updated to the very latest version of the hostsupdater plugin ( 1.1 ), you should downgrade to the previous version and raise an issue on the hosts updater plugin github repo so they know to fix it\nClosing as a duplicate of #1458 . Note that the 192.168 IP you used is the external IP that gets exposed. If it was on a different machine yes, but if you're already inside that VM loopback will suffice. Mapping custom sub folders under VVV 2 is the same as under 1, unsupported\nand requiring custom files\nMapping folders adds a performance overhead, something that isn't mentioned\nby tools such as VV, and isn't something VVV will support directly, vm_dir\netc are meant to change where a site is located, on a site level scope not\nsubfolders such as wp content etc\nSo use custom files, and if you do, be warned it's expected you have\nknowledge of vagrant and we won't support it, the vagrant docs are pretty\nclear on how to do it\nAlso keep in mind that rather than mapping sub folders into weird places,\ncustom provisioner's and version control checkouts, coupled with IDE/Editor\nprojects are a far superior solution.

No, if you'd like to add it, adding it as a custom utility would be the preferred method.\n\nIn the meantime, can you clarify what you mean by slowish performance? Is this page generation time? Disk performance? Network performance? DB issues?\n\nI've read (and experienced) that using Nginx and Apache together in a reverse proxy config is optimal for WordPress\n\nVIP runs with Nginx+batcache and manages to serve billions of webpages with high performance, I'm unsure what benefit Apache would give that couldn't be accomplished via varnish/batcache/nginx caches. Also, keep in mind that VVV is not built to run in production. If you're running VVV on a public facing site you should take it down for security reasons ( we also won't offer support for VVV instances exposed to the open internet, it's intended as a local dev environment ). I've never heard of such a performance difference, but if it exists, it's near meaningless with regards to WP performance. Try installing query monitor or going through the usual performance checks.\nE.g. switching to Apache might shave 0.1ms off your page load time, but telling the main query to exclude all posts with a particular post meta value might add several seconds or dramatically reduce the sites scalability. This is assuming the Apache vs Nginx theory is correct. Nifty, something you might want to look into though is an obect cache. VVV comes with memcached so dropping the memcached object cache drop-in into your install should provide a significant boost to most sites performance. The same is generally true of most WP installs. Have you tried using an absolute folder path not a relative/shorthand? e.g. /home/example/dev/etc..?. Are you sure the problem isn't that the vagrant user can't read that folder but the www user can? Try changing to root and checking the ownership of the folder. If that's the issue, then the root issue is probably something to do with user groups and permissions, I suspect the vagrant user is not in the same user group that those shares are mounted to, pure speculation mind. Can you test this on 2.2-develop and vbox 5.2.8? VVV doesn't come with a Redis install, and I'm not familiar with Redis performance characteristics, perhaps you can be more specific as to the kind of performance issue you're facing? E.g. Networking vs disk vs cpu etc. It's also not clear what your PHPUnit tests are doing either.

I'm not entirely sure about things now, can we get a clearer view of things with timings? A nice table showing timings or some bullet points would be great, having it spread across multiple messages with relative units from multiple people with incomplete coverage is confusing\nIn general though, it will always be slower inside the VM than natively, and it will be considerably slower with XDebug regardless of the environment. I have no metrics for this though, so being told it's slower without any context isn't particularly helpful. I'm not entirely sure about things now, can we get a clearer view of things with timings?

We need to swap this out at https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/blob/develop/config/nginx-config/nginx.conf#L119 for the vvv.test. Closing this for now as wontfix now that we've reverted the change, things should be working again for new users. PHP configs need ammending to use mhsendmail. https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1543 installs Mailhog though it doesn't do the last part setting up the service yet. See also https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-utilities/pull/17. MailHog now replaces Mailcatcher in develop. This has now been completed in develop ready for the v2.2.1 release. Don't forget to uninstall the vagrant triggers plugin. Currently debugging a problem when running vagrant halt, it doesn't prevent halt from working, but it does prevent the db backup script from running:\n\n. Further debugging shows that this works:\nconfig.trigger.before :halt do |trigger|\n    trigger.name = \"VVV Pre-Halt\"\n    trigger.run_remote = { inline: \"echo 'moomins'\" }\n  end\n\n. On further debugging it looks to be the mysql statement in the db_backup script. Vagrant halt now works, all checks out!. Yes, when VVV 3 updates, it'll be a box update. If the VM contains the Database then it'll be destroyed when the VM is destroyed and recreated with the new box. As for the backup of wp develop, give the custom-site-template-develop a try. @benlumia007 it should be here on GitHub if you checkout the specific commit just before the Vagrant core changes\nCan you raise issues for the current develop version so we can fix them? If it's the nginx server certificate that's been fixed just now. Going forward we'll be requiring Vagrant 2.1 as a minimum. @benlumia007 It was fixed before I made my last reply, and should not be an issue in the current develop branch. @benlumia007 did you reprovision? The change that caused that error was reverted in https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/commit/c4d80706bd58dfe5f6a56f5f0bcdee263b16beba\nDoes re-provisioning fix it?. hmm that is not an error I have seen before, @LoreleiAurora thoughts?. As an aside, can you produce a full provision log?. You shouldn't update the vagrant box, not while we're on VVV 2, I'm debugging. @benlumia007 you can get that by clicking on commits on the main repo page, but there is no canonical 2.2.0, you're going to have to check individual commits, starting with the one immediatley before the vagrant trigger core changes. @benlumia007 can you try the tomjn_fixes branch?. A possible reason is because one of the changesets that caused issues moved logs to /srv/log\nSince some stuff still goes to /var/log I moved it all back in that branch, then changed the vagrant mapping to use /var/log rather than /srv/log as it's got more stuff in it, to consolidate things\nIt's likely that all that needs adding is noroot mkdir -p /var/log/nginx && noroot touch /var/log/nginx/error.log to provision.sh though I don't know why this would be an issue now when it wasn't before, v2.1 has the same log location. @benlumia007 it should work now, I spoke with @LoreleiAurora and we merged it and a revert to another PR that should fix grunt, I'm reprovisioning from scratch now and conducting tests\n@guyromellemagayano I've made a modification that should ensure the nginx log files are created if they don't exist and the relevant folders are present, let me know if the develop branch resolves that issue for you. Awesome, I'm going to close this out and continue testing. Marking as closed and wontfix, I'm told this is normal and won't cause issues. Indeed the issue was resolved in the recent commits to develop, it should be enough to:\ngit pull\nvagrant halt\nvagrant up --provision\n\nAs for boxes, yes, VVV uses an out of date vagrant box, this is expected. I would not recommend updating the box.\nVVV 3 will fix this by building a new box with VVV pre-provisioned, so that only the site provisioners run. Updating VVV will involve a git pull and a vagrant box update followed by a provision. Until then, don't update the box on VVV 2, it might have unexpected consequences, and is untested\n. Also note that you will need Vagrant 2.1+. That's certainly unexpected, have you at any point updated the box or done anything with apt-get? Or is this the first ssh into a newly provisioned VVV?. Does #1508 resolve this for you?. #1508 caused problems for fresh provisions, reopening. Nothing has been changed with mailcatcher in recent commits. We've had a\nlot of reports of it being quite unreliable in functionality or just\ninstallation over the last year. If you can take the time we'd love if\nsomebody can contribute to replacing it with mailhog\nOn Tue, 15 May 2018 at 03:52, Guy Romelle Magayano notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n[UPDATE] The mailcatcher does not load when I tried to access it via\nhttp://vvv.test:1080/ http://url.

As an aside:\nBefore doing so, I deleted the /.vagrant.d folder in my Mac's /home folder, delete the vagrant box vvv folder. So it was a total clean slate - for sure.\n\nI've never had to delete that folder, if anything it's Virtualbox that needs the cleanup to destroy the VM sometimes. > their links will redirect to the same http://vvv.test/ link.\nProvisioning failed somewhere, vvv.test is the default site, this is probably caused by the issue being worked on in #1510 and fixed by #1512 . Looks like default: Unable to locate package language-pack-UTF-8 is the culprit. Fixed when https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1512 is merged. And indeed I need to go through and remove vagrant triggers from the docs, it got merged into Vagrant 2.1, so the plugin is no longer necessary, and you'll get warnings unless you pass a parameter\n( yes you can use older VVV with 2.1 if you pass parameters, read the warning Vagrant gives you for the details ). @eno812 are things working well for you now? I'm holding off making any changes, and hoping to release v2.2.1 to master today or tomorrow once it's been confirmed by several people\n@benlumia007 thanks for the testing and checks on multiple machines, you've been a real help :). Awesome, closing the issue. thanks @benlumia007 :). Closes #1510 . @guyromellemagayano I'd strongly advise against using vv, so much so I'm tempted to have VVV detect vv's presence and warn against it with uninstall instructions. vv is unmaintained and incompatible and causes lots of issues. Note that vv doesn't work with VVV as it was intended, which shows when upgrading, or when destroying and recreating the box. Would it be possible to get the output of ls -al in /var/logs?\nAs for getting you back up and running, manually create the nginx folder, the logs folder gets mapped on to a logs folder in the VVV folder, then reprovision. #1517 in theory should fix this, any testing you can do to verify that would be awesome. Awesome, now we just need to test on a fresh install. @benlumia007 as long as the final result is good, I think we can overlook differing output on provision, changing the sites should give different results as each site provisioner does their own thing. @benlumia007 I need a review approval to merge, can you do the honour?. You leave a review via the changed files tab:\n\nYou can't approve your own changes though so I need another person to vouch for them. This is for when vagrant destroy fails, e.g. running vagrant destroy on a VM that's already been halted. tested on the CD USB generator\n\n. I tested it locally here, I ran into am issue with the CD generator repo\nbecause of changes in VVV and couldn't get rid of the VM the usual way. I\nfixed that repo up but this fixes the general problem of not being able to\ndestroy or halt if an error occurs\nAs for the CD generator CD stands for contributer day. It provisions VVV\nand downloads installers to put on USB sticks for machine setup\nOn Thu, 24 May 2018 at 13:06, Daniele Scasciafratte \nnotifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@Mte90 approved this pull request.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because your review was requested.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1520#pullrequestreview-122943790,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AADl54ArKwFr0nNCRX903Xs-MFf_EpRUks5t1pQ6gaJpZM4ULU4j\n.\n.

Utilities run on provision, the --provision-with is vagrant lingo for executing a specific provisioner. So we can't regenerate certificates because no utilities are loaded, and most of the VVV provisioner isn't either, the only thing you can expect is the vvv-init.sh of that site, and some stuff to copy the nginx config into the appropriate place.\n\nThis is why we don't advertise that you can do this. Suggestions on file changes are welcome though, just understand that Utilities don't run in that context, and we have no mechanism for triggering them like that, unless you use vagrant up --provision or vagrant provision. Sure, we'd need to change how utilities work to make this happen which is going to take some time. What's the error message it gives under details?

Yeah https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1529 got merged, forgot to close this, thanks for reminding me :). This should fix a warning given about require_plugins on vagrant up. Eh the Trac ticket will get closed, this is a general vagrant issue. You can fix this at the cost of reduced performance, but it will never be as good as running it on the host. How much performance is lost will depend on a lot of variables. Does putenv not work for you? PHP conf files get replaced on every provision by design, as they're managed by Utilities\n\nOtherwise, Nginx is the route you should take, e.g.\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/8098927/nginx-variables-similar-to-setenv-in-apache#8331663\nI'm going to close this for now though as it's a general Nginx question, nothing that needs VVV specific knowledge. Yeah:\nfastcgi_param   TEST test;\nJust be mindful you'll need to fork custom site template to do it, ideally you'd have the provisioner insert them and read from vvv-custom.yml so it was generic and could be backported. hmmm if you didn't already have a vvv-nginx.conf file your old project should not have been able to load, it looks like you've made a mistake or a typo somewhere, and the config is no longer valid Nginx config syntax. I recommend the standard Nginx linting tactics such as nginx -t. awesome, let me test it and I'll get back to you. Once VVV 2 is using vvv-base, updating Ubuntu or even swapping it out entirely becomes easier in the longterm, as well as changes for V3. I don't believe that would be possible, my understanding is that Virtualbox could use them but it would convert them in the process, so after it happened you'd end up diverging. There is a 100% manual process that doesn't involve Vagrant though that would do this. I don't know if @LoreleiAurora want's this in 2.3 or a 2.4 release, or if it just needed testing to verify 3.0 stuff, but I would like to do a 2.3 release soon with MailHog and more recent quality of life improvements. We just need somebody to confirm this works fine on Windows. Has an issue been raised with PHPMyAdmin about this? I'm loathe to maintain a fork of PHPMyAdmin just for this. As an aside, if VVV detects database backups in the backup folder for databases that don't exist/empty it will try to restore them.\nGiven that PHPMyAdmin runs in a browser, it's not ideal for large SQL files anyway, I recommend using the mysql command inside the VM for a more reliable restore. I've updated PHPMyAdmin pending further tests, ideally composer would grab it and it would always be the latest version, but this will do for now. Now that the PR has been merged, delete copy of PHPMyAdmin VVV installs, and reprovision for the updated PHPMyAdmin. Have you tried running this on the latest VVV? 2.2.1 is the current version, but you're using 2.1.1. Additionally, if this happens on the develop branch, can you post a more complete provisioner log? Including the commands that triggered it?\nIn particular, you're also using the vagrant triggers plugin, a plugin that was deprecated in Vagrant 2.1 after its functionality was merged into core, so:\n\nUninstall the vagrant triggers plugin\nMake sure you're using the most up to date version of VVV\nSwitch to the develop branch\nMake sure you're using the most up to date version of Vagrant\nreprovision, and if it fails, send over the full log and the commands used to produce it. You should only have 1 install running at a time, just remember to halt your other installs before running vagrant up. Can you post a full provisioner log? Your log is incomplete. The full output, if you didn't pipe it to a file, you can copy paste it, use a gist and copy the URL in here. Are you sure triggers has been uninstalled?\n\n/home/andys/.vagrant.d/gems/2.4.4/gems/vagrant-triggers-0.5.3/\nThat folder does not exist on my machine. I'd also recommend switching to a git based install rather than a zip based install as it'll be easier to keep updated\nThis might help:\nvagrant plugin uninstall vagrant-triggers\nvagrant plugin expunge --reinstall --force\nvagrant plugin repair\nvagrant plugin update. If it's not in the vvv-custom.yml file it doesn't exist, it sounds like you could do with a reprovision, vagrant up --provision. @AndyS12 everything still ok?. This is because the entries in your hosts file aren't written. The very end of your provision is an error message:\n==> default: [vagrant-hostsupdater] This operation requires administrative access.

You shouldn't need to modify the permissions on the hosts file, though it might allow you to use non-elevated command prompts. You should be able to right click on git bash and \"Run as administrator\" which should resolve the issue without changing permissions on the hosts file. Closing this out now we know what happened. It'd end up as a utility anyway, especially since it brings in mongodb requirements. If it ever made it into core VVV it'd be in the core utility.

For reference I've been following this: https://www.lullabot.com/articles/installing-mailhog-for-ubuntu-1604\n\nThough I've deliberatley left out the IPs so that it uses the default 0.0.0.0, setting just the web interface so it had the same port as mailcatcher caused issues with websocket connections. I did get it to catch via mhsendmail, and I pushed up a branch to VVV utilities that adjusts PHP\nI still need to make it start on startup automatically though, something that was also broken in mailcatcher, but I've not implemented the steps to do so yet, so it should run after a vagrant up --provision but not a vagrant up. For reference, this PR won't fully provision anyway since when it starts mailhog it blocks provisioning continuing. PHP 7.2 issues should be unrelated to this, this PR does not touch PHP, that is an unknown error\nNote that with b176a02 MailHog runs for me, there's still clean up to do:\n\nmailcatcher seems to prevent mailhog from running if it too is running, we need a mechanism to uninstall it\nright now it tries to stop the mailcatcher service and remove the service file, even if they don't exist, which is sloppy\nMailhog is available at vvv.test:8025 the dashboard should be updated to reflect this\nJust because MailHog runs doesn't mean it's catching anything, that needs to be tested and confirmed. I believe it's testing time. Now with the goodies from develop\n. Can you post a screenshot showing it catching mails? It'd be handy for the 2.3 release\n\nAdditionally, any thoughts on uninstalling mailcatcher?. Awesome, then I think all that's left is to approve and merge, we can optimise mailcatcher cleanup later. why would it be a breaking change?. Or we could wrap that line in an if statement and only run it if the plugin is present?. It looks like it's fetching your repository just fine, but I see no provisioner script of any kind gets ran.\nAre you sure there's a provision folder? It's not enough to just give it a WP folder, it need a public html folder and a provision folder with Nginx configs and a script to setup the DB and run the WP installer\nSee the custom-site-template repo:\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template/tree/master/provision\nThere's a provision folder that tells VVV how to set up the site, and a public_html folder that gets created to contain the WP install.\nWithout these VVV won't know how to serve that site, and you'll get the default page which is the dashboard, which has a check on it to see if it's showing on a page that isn't the dashboard. I forget the name of the folder, probably htdocs\n\nSo I would just check out the admin site elsewhere on my machine and then manually copy those files into w4zadmin/public_html?\n\nYes\n\nSo would this need to be done each time the site is re-provisioned?\n\nNo, only once\n\nOr can this repo be added in vvv-custom.yml config somehow?\n\nNot with the custom-site-template, the provisioner doesn't have a method for sub-folder git clones, but perhaps it should\n\nIf I was to add it into vvv-init.sh, it would also get overwritten when re-provisioning right?\n\nProbably, but it'd be better to fork the custom-site-template and make your own modifications to vvv-init.sh, and since you already have a private bitbucket setup, you could use that for the forked repo and use that in the repo field instead\n\nOr is it recommended to add the provision folder into our wellsforzoe_admin.git repo and change the above back to pull from that repo?\n\nYou could do that too, you'd need to move the existing files down into a subfolder so that there's a public html or htdocs folder\n\nSorry for all the (basic) questions.\n\nNo need to apologise, this is helpful for when I revisit the docs to make things clearer. > So last question hopefully - how do I access phpmyadmin?\nThere's a link on the dashboard in the sidebar, but you have other options if you prefer an alternative mysql client, just use the same details as wp-config.php but swap the host for the VVV machines IP\n\nI presume it is a manual process of exporting the data from my production db and importing it locally?\n\nCorrect\n\nThat's correct (Unless we do this in vvv-init.sh I guess)\n\nYou could do that, but you'll need to write a check to make sure all your content doesn't get imported on every provision, only if it's necessary\n\nAnd similarly for importing data into the wordpress install, I have read elsewhere that we'd need to use a plugin like All in One Migration to export it so that you can change the domain name to what it will be locally. Do you recommend this approach?\n\nIf you're doing an SQL dump then WP CLI can search replace it once it's in the DB on VVV\nThere's also WP CLI for importing WXR files via the standard importer. I'm unfamiliar with All in One Migration. You might be interested in the Contributor day USB generator repo:\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/CD-USB-Generator. This is present in v2.3. Can you delete your copy of PHPMyAdmin, git pull and reprovision? If it doesn't work, please put the full provisioner log in a gist and link to it from here so I can look through and check things. As an aside, you can use any MySQL client in place of PHPMyAdmin. With the v2.2.1 release, we fixed the vagrant trigger issue and Vagrant 2.1 is needed now, so upgrade and uninstall vagrant triggers. Does completely deleting PHPMyAdmin and reprovisioning correct the issue?. I'm at a conference until Monday and my capacity to look into this is\nsignificantly diminished.

PHPMyAdmin was changed to use Composer, and a part of that is the removal and reinstallation of PHPMyAdmin via this route, as detecting a composer install vs composer install that needed updating vs pre-composer was still something we hadn't figured out.\n\nAs for chmod, that should be irrelevant, that folder is mounted by vagrant, and so it should always have the same owner and file permissions. Additionally:\n\nCan you show the output of ls -al /srv/www/default/database-admin?\nCan you show the output of ls -al /srv/www/default?\nDid you delete the folder itself, or did you delete the contents of the folder?\n\nAdditionally, the PHPMyAdmin provisioner always outputs:\necho \"Installing/Updating PHPMyAdmin\"\nBut that message is nowhere to be seen in your provisioner log:\ndefault: Current branch master is up to date.\n==> default: Running provisioner: utility-core-phpmyadmin (shell)...\n    default: Running: C:/Users/andre/AppData/Local/Temp/vagrant-shell20180616-3264-l1g50e.sh\n==> default: Running provisioner: utility-core-webgrind (shell)...\nThat is not what is meant to happen, at an absolute minimum you should have seen this:\ndefault: Current branch master is up to date.\n==> default: Running provisioner: utility-core-phpmyadmin (shell)...\n    default: Running: C:/Users/andre/AppData/Local/Temp/vagrant-shell20180616-3264-l1g50e.sh\n    default: Installing/Updating PHPMyAdmin\n==> default: Running provisioner: utility-core-webgrind (shell)...\n\nHave you made or have modifications to the core utilities?\nDid you modify vvv-custom.yml to use a custom branch?\nDid you remove or comment out PHPMyAdmin from the utilities section?\n\nNote that the dashboard will always show PHPMyAdmin as an option under tools, it does not check to see if PHPMyAdmin has been installed. So if you remove it from the utilities section and reprovision, the PHPMyAdmin button will still be there but nonfunctional. @IacopoC do you have anything in your www/default/database-admin folder? Additionally can you answer any of the questions I asked earlier in this issue? Right now we need more information to be able to debug this, I'm unable to reproduce this issue on my machine. Can you confirm that provision/resources/core/phpmyadmin/provision.sh looks like this file:\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-utilities/blob/master/phpmyadmin/provision.sh. So a TLDR:\n\nWe switched to a composer based install method\nOld method installed an old version of PHPMyAdmin that was broken on PHP 7.2, sticking with it was not an option\nNew method deletes and reinstalls it every provision because we couldn't figure out how to detect if it was an old install or a composer based install\nNew method appears to have issues on a minority of VVV installs\n\nSolutions:\n\nDelete the file the VM couldn't delete on the host OS and reprovision ( e.g. right click delete in finder )\nthere's nothing stopping you simply installing PHPMyAdmin the way you would any other WP site, create a new site, reprovision, download phpmyadmin, extract it into the new sites public html folder, configure phpmyadmin with the DB details, done\nFigure out how to detect if it's a composer based install and run composer update instead. This should be fixed in https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-utilities/commit/87ccdc350049bf7267a7d0344dc9caf5bb035dc4 which switched back to the older method but with PHPMyAdmin 4.8.1\n\nThis does mean that newer PHPMyAdmin releases will require somebody to manually update the file however. Reprovisioning should bring in the new version.\nThere's also the problem that existing users with older versions of PHPMyAdmin won't be updated as there's no mechanism for updating PHPMyAdmin now. good idea, done in https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-utilities/commit/69f048b3a3b5c7a381ddb64d7b8703251b3a4d57. I do not recommend running a box update, I also see you're still on the master branch, fixes are pushed to the develop branch not the master branch, you will see no changes until 2.3 is released unless you switch branches.\nAs an aside, .log files are an executable extension on MacOS, and can't be opened on mobile phones. I strongly recommend using a gist instead, or using a .txt format instead\n\nswitch to the develop branch\nDelete the PHPMyAdmin folder on your computer, making sure all traces of it are gone with no lingering files\nreprovision. hmmm looking at the log I see this:\n\ndefault: Removing older phpMyAdmin install\n    default: Downloading phpMyAdmin 4.8.1\n    default: cp:\n    default: cannot stat \u2018/vagrant/provision/resources/core/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php\u2019\n    default: : No such file or directory\nWhich should not be possible as the file is present here:\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-utilities/tree/master/phpmyadmin\nDid you delete the file or modify anything under the provision folder? If the provision/resources/core folder has local modifications of any kind that's a serious issue that needs resolving immediately. Delete the provision/resources/core folder and reprovision to pull it down again. @andreagrillo can you run vagrant ssh, then run these commands 1 by 1 and post the output and confirm if the result is the same or fixed? If it fails, which command does it fail at?\nsudo su\nrm -rf /srv/www/default/database-admin/*\ncd /srv/www/default\nwget -q -O phpmyadmin.tar.gz \"https://files.phpmyadmin.net/phpMyAdmin/4.8.1/phpMyAdmin-4.8.1-all-languages.tar.gz\"\ntar -xf phpmyadmin.tar.gz\nmv phpMyAdmin-4.8.1-all-languages database-admin\nrm phpmyadmin.tar.gz\ncp \"/vagrant/provision/resources/core/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php\" \"/srv/www/default/database-admin/\"\nBy all accounts, this should work, as it's the same process that was used original but with a newer PHPMyAdmin.\nAlso at any point, did you run vagrant destroy and reprovision? My only unconfirmed theory is that somehow there are files inside the VM in the locations of the mapped folders. I do not know how those would have gotten there, or how to test for them. hmm there shouldn't be any symlinks in that location. @andreagrillo I've adjusted the provisioner to use the /tmp folder, and use cp, which should make it less sensitive to permissions etc\nCan you test if this works for you? Move your existing folder somewhere else so you can restore it if things don't work, then reprovision. Likewise, @peterisj can you do the same?. For reference, you can run just the phpmyadmin provisioner with this command:\nsh\nvagrant provision --provision-with=\"utility-source-core\"\nvagrant provision --provision-with=\"utility-core-phpmyadmin\"\nThe first command updates the core utility, the second runs the phpmyadmin provisioner. @peterisj which file system is the host filesystem using?. @peterisj if you modify provision/resources/core/phpmyadmin/provision.sh to this:\n```sh\n!/usr/bin/env bash\nDIR=dirname $0\necho \"Checking phpMyAdmin\"\nDownload phpMyAdmin\nif [[ ! -f /srv/www/default/database-admin/RELEASE-DATE-4.8.1 ]]; then\n    echo \"Removing older phpMyAdmin install from /srv/www/default/database-admin\"\n    rm -rf /srv/www/default/database-admin/\n    echo \"Downloading phpMyAdmin 4.8.1\"\n    cd /tmp\n    wget -q -O phpmyadmin.tar.gz \"https://files.phpmyadmin.net/phpMyAdmin/4.8.1/phpMyAdmin-4.8.1-all-languages.tar.gz\"\n    echo \"Extracting phpMyAdmin 4.8.1 into /tmp\"\n    tar -xf phpmyadmin.tar.gz\n    echo \"Copying phpMyAdmin into place\"\n    mkdir -p /srv/www/default/database-admin\n    cp -rfL /tmp/phpMyAdmin-4.8.1-all-languages/ /srv/www/default/database-admin/\n    echo \"Cleaning up after phpMyAdmin\"\n    rm -rf /tmp/phpMyAdmin-4.8.1-all-languages\n    rm -f /tmp/phpmyadmin.tar.gz\n    echo \"phpMyAdmin setup complete\"\nelse\n    echo \"PHPMyAdmin already installed.\"\nfi\ncp \"${DIR}/config.inc.php\" \"/srv/www/default/database-admin/\"\n```\nThen run vagrant provision --provision-with=\"utility-core-phpmyadmin\", does that correct the symbolic link issue?. @andreagrillo that sounds like an unrelated error, all I can suggest is make sure you have an internet connection and try again.\nedit: you shouldn't be doing anything that requires a connection to github, are you sure you followed the instruction I outlined in my previous note? Or did you run a full provision?. Glad to hear, unless anybody else has this issue on the develop branch I'm going to close this. Glad to hear, unless anybody else has this issue on the develop branch I'm going to close this. As an aside this is only an issue if you run with --provision which isn't necessary for contributor days, but for adding new sites it would be good to slim things down a little for adding a new site etc. > I think this happened when I have added an ssh key to the system.\nWithout knowing exactly what you did and how you did it, I don't know if this is the cause or not. You can verify if this is the cause by removing the SSH key and retrying. I don't know how to help, this is a Vagrant issue, none of the VVV provisioners have even been loaded in the screenshot from your original post.\nHave you tried using 64bit Git for 64bit Windows? Is this issue impacting all vagrant boxes or just VVV? Does develop fix the issue?. Not with the information currently available, what you're seeing does not match any known issues, and implies this is a Vagrant issue, not a VVV issue. Can you confirm that this happens with VVV, and only VVV? Or does this happen to all Vagrant based software?\nAdditionally:\n\nhas vagrant ever worked for you in the past?\nDoes the issue go away if you connect via a different network?\nWhat change triggered this?\nCan you succesfully vagrant ssh?\nDoes the VM show in VirtualBox?\nIs Hyper V turned On or Off?\nDid you use 64bit git? Or 32bit git?\nWhich edition of Windows are you running? S? Pro? Home? etc\n\nOther notes:\n\nthe hosts file is irrelevant here, and a dead end. Your provisioning has yet to reach VVV provisioners, so there is no value in changing hosts file permissions at the moment.. Additionally, does setting config.ssh.insert_key to false in the vagrant file on a fresh box resolve the issue? Note that this line does not exist at the moment and will need to be manually added:\n\nconfig.ssh.insert_key = false\nPlace it after the forward agent line here\nAdditionally, can you answer all of the questions? Even if you believe them irrelevant, or don't know the answer? Unknown is still useful information, it is difficult to diagnose a problem when the info provided is pre-filtered. Can you grab me a link to the update/s that were installed?. I suspect that KB4284835 is responsible:\nhttps://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4284835/windows-10-update-kb4284835\n\nSecurity updates to Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Microsoft scripting engine, Windows Desktop Bridge, Windows apps, Windows shell, Windows kernel, Windows Server, Windows storage and filesystems, Windows wireless networking, remote code execution, and Windows virtualization and kernel.\n\nIn the meantime, you appear to be encountering a new issue ( #1555 ), which also explains some cryptic issues we've had in the past that pop up on rare occasions. I'm going to be occupied with work for most of the rest of today, but will research what can be done later this evening/tomorrow. closes https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/1504. This should be working now and operational, just needs somebody else to confirm it's not just me. Found by running:\nshell\nvagrant@vvv:~$ sudo mysql_install_db\nInstalling MariaDB/MySQL system tables in '/var/lib/mysql' ...\n2018-06-19 13:59:57 0 [ERROR] mysqld: File '/var/log/mysql/mariadb-bin.index' not found (Errcode: 13 \"Permission denied\")\n2018-06-19 13:59:57 0 [ERROR] Aborting. fixed by #1553 . So it works in Windows but if VBoxManage.exe isn't in PATH then the virtualbox version doesn't show\n\n. \nit seems to think it's running in mingw32 for some reason. Similar results in Powershell ISE, although PS ISE doesn't handle the colour codes\n\nI suspect this has something to do with how mingw32 git installed itself as cmd.exe shows the same results albeit with colours\n. here's git bash and mingw64\n\nI think for windows we'll need a modified splash colour scheme for better compat. As for virtualbox version, there's only so much we can do at the moment, I'm inclined to merge and circle back for an iterative approach. It would be better to adjust custom-site-template to add such a salt to wp-config.php, but I don't believe that's something VVV should spend a lot of time documenting, since it's not VVV specific and applies to any WP install. @paulschreiber it looks like VVV doesn't do anything regarding salts, and the source of the existing salts is actually WP CLI, a WP CLI adjustment would be the appropriate fix\nI've created a PR that should resolve this in a future WP CLI update. Once it's merged and released VVV will grab the update\nhttps://github.com/wp-cli/config-command/pull/59. tests destroying and recreating my VM with this have proven successful on MacOS High Sierra 10.13.5. Is xdebug turned on? It gets turned off during provisioning, otherwise provisions would take a veeerry long time. Additionally, can you try with develop just to confirm it's not already been fixed by something else?. Reprovisioning shouldn't be necessary, in fact reprovisioning would call xdebug_off\nHowever, I do see that it triggered php7.0-fpm, but the default is actually PHP 7.2.\nSo I suspect that it's working, but you're using a different PHP version. Can you update to the latest develop branch, reprovision, and try again? Additionally what's in your vvv-custom.yml?. Thanks, you might want to add these to the utilities section:\n- trusted-hosts\n    - tls-ca\nI doubt it will impact your issue, but it will give you SSL certificates. Of note, no changes have been made recently to xdebug, and the php-xdebug package is still in the install list, and the xdebug script should still be present.\nHere's the xdebug_on script:\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/blob/ee69135edc60e800c054ad1b358ac68ed8f8d76e/config/homebin/xdebug_on#L2\nIt would be helpful to run each command on its own and check for issues and report back. You can also check http://vvv.test/phpinfo\nThis is my phpinfo after running xdebug_on inside the VM on the latest develop commit:\n\n. Keep in mind that if XDebug is turned off, it will not appear in the phpinfo, and XDebug is automatically turned off during a provision, and needs to be explicitly turned back on again using xdebug_on inside the VM. Tested after running xdebug_on in the default PHP 7.2:\nphp\n$test = ['banana','test'];\nvar_dump( $test );\nexit;\n\n. @joelworsham which version of PHP does PHPInfo claim you're running? It should be 7.2\nAnd at which point did it go from working to not working?. For refrence, I've a 20-xdebug.ini in my /etc/php/7.2/cli/conf.d/ folder, you should also have an xdebug.ini at /etc/php/7.2/mods-available/. hmmm that's a shame, did you git pull or a halt and up? I had the weird experience of mailcatcher suddenly starting to work while I was replacing it with the more reliable MailHog, like a \"noo please don't replace me\". Mailcatcher is gone, removed in the develop branch because it's unreliable. Behold the maintenance dream that is MailHog :). Were you on the develop branch when you pulled? What was immediately before that error? That's Vagrant saying something happened while it ran a provisioner, but without context it's not possible to identify what that was, full log please. That should not have happened, though again it's difficult to tell when there's so little context, I need at least another 300/400 lines of context, that's not enough. Please post a full log in a gist. The cause of this might be a problem that happened at the very beginning of the log, but it's not possible to tell. Have you modified your xdebug.ini? Or done anything to it? Googling suggests that just above the cut off of the partial log is a question about which version should be used.. I've opened #1573 which might correct that problem by forcing dpkg to answer the question in a certain way. It's very difficult to tell with only a partial log, so at best it's a guess, but your xdebug config was modified or changed and dpkg doesn't know what to do. So it errs on the side of caution and asks, then exits when it doesn't get a response. @joelworsham is this replicable from a brand new VVV instance in a new folder on the develop branch? Confirming that no other local environment is running at the same time, be it a Docker/Node/Vagrant/VVV/etc? With no custom utilities? With the standard vvv-custom.yml out of the box?\nIf so, please post the entire provisioner log for the initial provision in a gist, along with the full output of every command given after initial provision to test things.\nRight now the problem cannot be reproduced by anybody with a clean environment to my knowledge, if it cannot be reproduced then it's very likely to be a problem unique to your particular VVV instance.\nAlso, please be as verbose as you possibly can. No partial log output, no leaving things out because they had no output or it didn't seem relevant.\nFinally, if it's still a problem, open xdebug_on and run each command manually to inspect the output, and post that too in a gist, complete with the commands themselves. @joelworsham is this replicable from a brand new VVV instance in a new folder on the develop branch?

Your VM has no network connection, the reason you don't see the dashboard is because on your VM there is no dashboard, it needed git to check it out, but couldn't install the git package\nCan you update to the latest develop branch? Also vagrant --version will tell you your vagrant version. Additionally, has this ever worked on your machine before? Or is this the very first time you've tried to use VVV?. standard git commands, pull down the latest changes with git pull then switch branch with git checkout develop. > Does the lack of network connection just mean that my wi-fi isn't strong enough?\nNo, a poor wifi signal is still a signal, the log suggests there was no connection at all. Sometimes this is because you just installed VirtualBox and it hasn't had a chance to install the network adaptors on system restart. Sometimes it's being blocked by antivirus or a firewall. hmmmm if that's the issue, can you confirm? It'd be good to get some more documentation, or even detecting that. #1565 got merged which improves the network check and gives much more information when it happens, a git pull should pull down the improvements. @abrightclearweb do you use an external device for network connectivity? A USB dongle etc? Something that isn't the default network adaptor or has an unusual name? This could be related to #1567 which has the same issue, but mentions using eternal wifi dongles to get around a nonfunctional unsupported main wireless adaptor. Progress! So can we lay the blame on the VPN? The src subdomain should give you a message from WP Core telling you to use the built version of WP not the src at http://build.wordpress-develop.test, can I see the vvv-custom.yml for that site? I assume it's using custom-site-template-develop rather than wordpress-develop?. I've also created #1571 which addresses a similar issue reported around the same time re: network detection, and adds a note on VPNs\nIf you can post as a gist, that should do fine for posting the log. It looks like grunt isn't available for whatever reason. Note that unless you're doing work on WP core that site should be unnecessary, if you need an additional WP site to do work in you can add one like this:\nyaml\n  newsite:\n    repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template.git\n    hosts:\n      - newsite.test\nFollowed by a reprovision. Tested by turning wifi off and provisioning. I'm considering switching from https://google.com to 8.8.8.8, as it's also a google property, but it's a raw IP so DNS lookups won't be a problem. In an ideal scenario it might actually be a bit faster. closing as a duplicate of #1563 .

Do other vagrant systems have network connectivity? It's very possible that vagrant is binding the VM to the non-functional network interface, not the external adaptors you're using. Additionally does this answer help? :\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/18457306/how-to-enable-internet-access-inside-vagrant#18457420. Additionally, what does VirtualBox' UI say about the network adaptors?. @oscarssanchez can you try the tomjn-cable-connected-workaround branch from PR #1568 ?. are you able to ping 8.8.8.8?. hmmmm can you pinpoint which commit it was that broke things?. Also, does the network connection test still fail in your provision log, despite it continuing to provision on that commit hash?. Then you should be able to use git bisect to figure out when things broke:\n\n$ git bisect start\n$ git bisect good 8079055\n$ git bisect bad d110ab0\nIt will then do a search, asking you to check if it's good or bad each time. If it's good, run git bisect good, if it's bad run git bisect bad, eventually it'll hone in on 1 particular commit.\nOnce you're done git bisect reset will return you back to a normal working state. See here for more detailed instructions based on Drupal usage. Also as an aside, on the latest commit, even with the issue, can you ping 8.8.8.8 if you run vagrant ssh and run it inside the VM? and what if you change the 8.8.8.8 to http://google.com?. That makes sense, I'll switch it to https://google.com. I've a strong distaste of pulling in a script like that via curl during provisioning, at WCEU we had long delays getting machines up and running because we couldn't download vagrant hosts updater over the wifi, which is only 10kb\nSince we know half of the dependencies the script checks for are already installed during provisioning, and we know in advance what the OS is, and already add several GPG keys to apt, the script shouldn't be needed.\nSo, if you'd like this in VVV core:\n\nAdd git-lfs to the package list in provision/provision.sh\nDownload the signing key if necessary and put it in the config/apt-keys\nModify the package_install function to check if it needs adding and add it\nmake it run git lfs install\n\nFor the apt-sources, add any to config/apt-source-append.list\nIn the meantime though, you can either:\n\nAdd it as a utility, and put the steps in your issue inside a provision.sh file e.g. a git repo named git-lfs, containing git-lfs/provision.sh then added to vvv-custom.yml\nManually do it inside the VM\nDo the steps above and send a PR to add it to the develop branch\n\nI'm going to mark this as a feature request in the meantime. An additional option would be to checkout the LFS parts using git on the host machine, I imagine a git fetch && git checkout would probably be what's needed, or something similar, I'm not super familiar with LFS. Closing this, Git LFS support is included in v2.3 of VVV thanks to the mentioned PR. @obilodeau This looks good, needs testing though, is there a repo with git LFS that we can use for reference?. Apologies for the delay in testing, this slipped my mind. This works! The only caveat is that if a git repo has already been created, it won't retroactively fix LFS files. Closes #1567 . @oscarssanchez does this PR resolve the issues at your end?. That shouldn't be necessary, this extends rather than replaces the current system. It seems these are in /etc/update-motd.d/ so .bashrc can remain the same. @mnelson4 can you do a PR for the vagrant file change?. @uitta the domain tests was changed to launchpad recently, you may get different results.\nHowever, I am unable to explain why it works with one network but not with the other. To clarify things further, I present a matrix of tried and untried combinations:\n|Network|with VPN|without VPN|\n|-|-|-|\n|Fastweb|?|\ud83d\udeab|\n|wifi 2| \u2705| ? | \nAs an aside, could you not just provision on the one that works? You don't need an internet connection to run vagrant up or vagrant halt, only vagrant up --provision or vagrant provision need a connection. vagrant up just turns the VM on, if you've already done provisioning then a simple vagrant up should work with your computer in airplane mode with all network interfaces turned off.\nProvisioning on the other hand requires a network connection. Think of it as installing a device vs using it. Provisioning is going to the store and buying a new toaster, unpacking it, finding a spare socket, etc. Vagrant up is just toggling the on/off button.. @guoyunhe can you test PR #1589 and see if that resolves the problem? It implements Loreleis suggestion. Guest additions come with the base box. Building our own base box would allow us to include more up to date versions, but recent tests did not pan out so well on that front. As @Mte90 said you can install a vagrant plugin that will try to update them for you.\nOnce the base box issues are eliminated though this won't be a problem, nor will it be an issue with VVV 3.

Similar to opening a window and having the building collapse around you, it's possible, but you know if it happens that it's very unusual and not what's meant to happen. You should not be concerned by this.\nSo follow the instructions in the documentation and you'll be fine, the only thing I would note is uninstall Vagrant triggers and update Vagrant to its latest version\n\n\nVVV version: 2.1.0-105-g14fe2a3\nVVV Git Branch: develop\n\nIf you had downloaded a zip file, you would not have a git commit or a git branch. You can create vagrant_halt_custom and vagrant_halt_custom, vagrant_destroy_custom, and vagrant_suspend_custom scripts in the config/homebin folders then reprovision. Those scripts will be ran instead of db_backup. Of note, you could use that to call a custom db_backup_compressed script, that does the same thing but gzips the database files, they should compress very well. Which template is being used for that site? Note that if your src.wordpress-develop.test gives you a WP install, then something is terribly out of date. You're only meant to use the build.wordpress-develop.test URL in modern WP Core development.\n\nVVV version: 2.2.1 + c87eba6 patch\nVVV Git Branch: zip download\n\nCan you switch to a git based install and use the latest version of the develop branch?\n\nWhen installing a plugin in http://src.wordpress-develop.test I assume the plugin is stored in /srv/www/wordpress-develop/public_html/src/wp-content/plugins/\n\nIn modern core WP development, only the built version of WP can be accessed. If you try to use the src version, it runs wp_die and tells you that you need to build WP. Installing and using WP from the source folder should not be possible\n\nWhen accessing http://build.wordpress-develop.test The frontpage should show with the title build.wordpress-develop.test\n\nI would suggest using:\nyaml\n  # The wordpress-develop configuration is useful for contributing to WordPress.\n  wordpress-develop:\n    repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template-develop.git\n    hosts:\n      - wordpress-develop.test\nPlugins and themes etc should go in the build folder, and modifications to core go in the src folder, and then get built into the build folder. I'd suggest running an npm watch on the host machine ( running it inside the VM is not recommended ). > I'm using the default vvv-config.yml copied to vvv-custom.yml with the following changes:\nAll your previous notes implied you were using wordpress-develop and the WP Core dev site template. Your screenshot on the other hand indicates this is not the case\n\nCustom Site Template: Generates a WP install\nCustom Site Template Develop: Generates a WP Core development site, with a src and build folder for contributing to and testing core\n\n\nI have never seen this since using VVV over 4 years.\n\nThat's because it isn't a VVV thing, it's a WordPress thing. In the last few months, WP core development was restructured. You can no longer run WP out of the source folder, you have to run it out of the build folder. VVV just pulls down a copy of the WP Core dev repos.\nNote that this is specific to the WP Core development, and does not happen on normal WP installs.\n\nI don't want to contribute to the core. I just want to develop plugins. Can I remove all sites other that mydev in the vvv-custom.yml?\n\nThen just use the custom site template, rather than custom site template develop. The first installs WP, the latter installs a WP Core dev environment. None of the sites in VVV are required, they're just defaults. Do add at least 1 site though, I'm not sure how VVV will respond if zero sites are defined.\n\nI just need a working test environment to execute phpunit tests.\n\nYou don't need a WP Core dev environment to do unit tests for plugin development, standard WP install will do for that, follow all the standard PHPUnit setup instructions.\nThere's nothing VVV specific to be done here once you have a WP install. The only thing to note is that if you run vagrant ssh you'll have a copy of PHPUnit present. But beyond that, the question is how to do unit tests, and that's the same wether you're using VVV/MAMP/LAMP/Docker/XAMP/Local/etc\n\nShould unittests also work with mydev.test only and no wordpress-develop? (My guess is: when using custom-site-template-develop.git instead of custom-site-template.git it should work)\n\nOnly if you want to contribute to the WP Core unit tests. If you want to write unit tests for your own plugin, then all you need is your own plugin and PHPUnit. If you want to mock WP functions there are libraries and things for that, but you're going to have to google for those. None of it is VVV specific. There's nothing special about the develop custom site template that allows it to do basic unit tests that the others can't. I'm not familiar with the install-wp-tests script\n\nthe docs say put your plugin in www/wordpress-develop/public_html/src. As plugin developer I assume I have to access src.wordpress-develop.test then.\n\nThose will need changing. There's already a PR to change the URL in the default config to have neither src or build. Either way, even if you visit src, that template always loads the build folder, so the difference is purely the URL, it only serves the build folder.\nThe old legacy deprecated version will serve the src folder though, but don't use that, it's old and deprecated\nFor plugin development though, use a normal custom site template, using the develop version overcomplicates things massively for plugin development\n\nI don't even know that I have to \"compile\" WordPress just to make my changes on the plugin effective.\n\nI don't know the specifics of how WP Core builds work, but I would use a normal WP site to test plugins. I'm going to close this out due to inactivity, if there are still issues or questions feel free to comment and I'll reopen. This looks like it tried to download a bunch of things but one or two of them failed to connect. The most likely cause is network instability.\nI'm going to recommend the classic turn it off and back on again routine, as clearly it managed to connect to launchpad for most of the packages. It just needs a retry. I think there's a severe case of \"no, this part isn't relevant lets leave it out\" being applied to the cause of this, omitting things to be helpful or concise is not helpful. It's always best to include links to the entire output including all the commands issued via gists. I must demand that you provide the entire confection\nRight now the issue is that a VVV install went from ?? to ?? and after the transition provisioning failed with an error about opening a log file with no context. The instance ran on Vagrant v?? on VirtualBox v?? And ?? or 2 sets of instructions were followed.\nAs always, use the develop branch not the master branch for wrangling issues, use the latest Vagrant and VirtualBox, and post the entire output, including all commands from start to finish. As an aside, on the develop branch, the splash output contains the vagrant version amongst other valuable pieces of info, hence the desire for the full log, amongst other reasons. The error provided implies this is an old error that was fixed in May. @cagross we're already here, lets not confuse things by spanning multiple issues. I'm going to close this out. The original issue seems to have been resolved by retrying, and the subsequent error is unrelated to the original problem ( most likely somebody deleted what was in the logs folder without recreating the files ).

As I thought, it never gets past the vagrant file, that error suggests that if it worked for you in the past and it doesn't work now, then something else has changed. The parallels specific portions of the vagrant file have not seen changes in quite a while\nThought parallels is still supported. I had performance issues years ago and switched to parallels which worked still well with VVV 2.2.1.\n\nIt's a roll of the dice, it worked at some point, but the resources to maintain support are not there, so wether it continues to work or not is an unknown\nWhile the docs do say:\n\nIn addition to VirtualBox, provider support is also included for Parallels, Hyper-V, VMWare Fusion, and VMWare Workstation.\n\nMileage may vary, and active testing of those providers is variable. If there's an issue with a provider it's a case of trying it out, discovering it, and reporting the bug. VirtualBox being the most widely used and what all the instructions cater to is pretty much guaranteed to be supported. Hyper-V or VMWare fusions not so much. I tried to set up Hyper V instructions for example, but I didn't have the means to verify them, and I asked if somebody could run through them and check, that was months ago though with no response.\nIt's also difficult because a lot of these providers require you to pay upfront for a license to gain access, making Hyper-V and VirtualBox the only free options ( assuming a Windows license )\nSo looking at the issue, I would look here:\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/blob/develop/Vagrantfile#L385\nAnd notice that similar guards are not present on the other synced_folder directives that specify file and folder permissions. My guess is that they would need to be added.\nThis Hyper V block might be the best way to do that for local sites:\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/blob/develop/Vagrantfile#L439\nSpecifically, you will want to add Parallels specific overrides to those synced folders that specify fmode and dmode\nIf you manage to get it working, please send a PR, but I cannot guarantee that once that issue is resolved that you won't face others. This has been done and will be here in the v2.4 release. @ivankristianto can you create a PR against the develop branch for this? Do those changes work with the normal MacOS terminal app?. Awesome, I'm curious though, VVV tries to use the standard red/yellow/blue/green to colour the logos but make sure it still fits with the colour scheme in use, and I see the colours in iTerm aren't R/G/B but they do look different. Is that just your colour scheme?. You can change this via vvv-custom.yml:\nyaml\nvm_config:\n    private_network_ip: 1.2.3.4\nYou will need to reprovision afterwards.\nnote that this might be caused by having multiple VVV instances running. Let me know if this helps. it doesn't sound like provisioning was succesful, It Works! isn't what Nginx outputs by default in VVV, you should be seeing the dashboard.\nMy recommendation is to double check that you do not have another local environment running on port 80 that could be conflicting. In the past when this has happened the user has Homestead or another vagrant environment running which used Apache, and it would randomly show either VVV or the other\nOtherwise, I would reprovision from scratch and post the log file here.\nAdditionally, what do you see when you visit http://192.168.51.0:80 And why did you choose such a similar IP?. Did you ever identify what was using the IP VVV originally tried to use? I would destroy the VM and start again with a fresh provision from scratch, and make sure to grab a full copy of the provision log. And anything under 192.168.x.x that's unoccupied will do. @joelworsham you mean this isn't a fresh VM on its first provisions? Have you tried a different IP?\n\nWell, the only change between working for 2 years and now is I got a new router.\n\nYour router may be using a different IP range than your previous one.\n\nSorry for my naivety, but can I destroy my VM and not lose all of my data?\n\nYou don't, but that your VM was previously working is brand new information. Turn VVV off, clear out your hosts file, and verify that the IP you chose is indeed not in use. Then, find a new IP. Then reprovision. If 192.168.50.4 is in use by something, then moving to an IP that's very close is unwise.\nE.g. if I have a local network and the 4th IP is occupied, moving to the 0th isn't a good idea as it's probably going to be assigned. Maybe the 200th or the 99999th IP would be a better choice, or an IP that isn't in the range the router assigns\nIn the meantime, VVV is meant to keep backups of the database on halt and up, check that those are intact, and you can use them to restore your databases.\nOr, modify your router to assign IP ranges that aren't in the same IP range VVV uses. Further research indicates that \"It works!\" is not an Nginx thing but an Apache thing.\nWhatever is generating the \"It Works!\" it is not VVV. I had a thought after going on a walk, this block of code in the vagrant file changes the filesystem mounts over from normal vagrant shares to SMB shares:\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/blob/develop/Vagrantfile#L436-L453\nI doubt the non-SMB style share has been tested in a long time, but it might be worth looking into and testing this with these lines commented out. @tannerchung the vbox fs error is almost certainly related to SMB shares, it could even be that SMB shares are turned off on your Windows instance.\nFor the VM side of things, the vb-guest vagrant plugin has been shown to help in some cases. @ARAGATO you're using 10.0.2.15 as the IP to connect to, where did you get that IP from? I'm assuming it's the IP of your computer ( not the IP of the virtual machine ), you need to connect to the guest machine/VM running VVV, not the host machine. The IP is 192.168.50.4 by default, remember, your IP != VVV IP. Also keep in mind that VVV is not setup for remote network requests, if you're trying to access a VVV instance on a different computer across an office network, it will not work. This is because people were using VVV in production which is a bad idea. Before you go, can you try using VVV.test instead of an IP?\nOn Mon, 27 Aug 2018 at 07:29, ARAGATO notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nClosed #1618 https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/1618\n.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/1618#event-1809857468,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AADl54SXMn8M9zF_eYc6uiI6_75ZR3bTks5uU5HbgaJpZM4WLRPk\n.\n. If you're inside the VM then that won't work. 192.168.50.1 is the IP presented by VirtualBox to the host via VirtualBox' network adaptor. That interface does not exist inside the VM, so there is nothing at 192.168.50.1 inside the virtual machine.\n\ninstead, to connect to itself, you should use the standard tried and true method: 127.0.0.1.\nRemember, where you are connecting to and where you are connecting from matter. VVV doesn't just appear on the local network as if you plugged a new computer into your router, it appears on a VirtualBox adapter, on a private network. Only the host can see it. As far as VVV is concerned it's connected to something via an ethernet cable, and that something provides internet access, but it has no other context. It's a 1<->1 pipe.. I think a wise step would be to check if the xdebug module is present in the dashboard and show a little green on icon of some sort. Related to #1617 #1616 and #1615 . This seems to fix some of the problems encountered but a provision under hyperv here throws up read and write permission problems with the mounted folders\nSpecifically, the mariadb setup scripts are unable to write to the mysql shared folder ( for some reason the backwards compat flag gets triggered ). @LoreleiAurora I could do with a second opinion on how to wrangle the permissions, as well as valid mount options. @benlumia007 so right now this doesn't provision because the shared folders get mounted but the packages can't write to it, so package installation fails on the first provision. It's further than master or develop get, and it's fixable, but I'm unsure which user or group to mount it as ( or why most non virtualbox ubuntu boxes lack an ubuntu user to begin with )\nThat needs fixing before I can open it up to wider testing, I'll request a review once it's at that point. My understanding is that VVV logs to /var/logs, can you confirm the missing details of your install? Vagrant/VirtualBox versions, provider used, OS, etc? As well as the ability to write to that location from PHP/inside the VM?\n\nNothing is logged to that file. Note that this was all working prior to updating to 2.2.1.\n\nWhich version did you update from, and which version broke it?. This may be resolved in #1636 @roykho does this PR resolve the issue for you?. This should be resolved now with the update to the core utilities, so I'm closing this.\nI'd also recommend doing a git pull and a reprovision to move to v2.4. What's the output of the Vagrant up command? Also which version of VVV and\nvagrant? ( Note that VVV and Vagrant aren't the same )\nAlso did you try with the develop branch?\nOn Mon, 27 Aug 2018 at 08:35, Trekkarr notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nExpected Behavior\nAfter installing and using the vagrant up command it comes back to the\ncommand line but when I use the vagrant status command I get the following:\nCurrent machine states:\ndefault not created (virtualbox)\nCurrent Behavior Possible Solution Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)\n\nvagrant up command\nvagrant status command\nNot created (Virtual Box)\n   4.\n\nContext Your Environment Using Windows 10\n\nVVV version:\nVVV Git Branch:\nVagrant version: Master\nVM Provider name: VirtualBox\nVM Provider version: 5.2.18\nOperating System and version:\n   Windows 10 Pro\n\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/1621, or mute\nthe thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AADl51Fx16QaBNRjk5Z7frEohLbO2G_Sks5uU6E6gaJpZM4WNUdo\n.\n.

And you can sell it!. > One thing that bothers me is that php, mariadb, and all packages installed by vvv come with different licenses.\nI fail to see the relevance, opensource code licenses are more concerned with what you can do with the code, not how the end software gets used.

There's a difference between using and modifying software.\n\nBut those software that come with different licenses( such as php, ubuntu, memcached) can they be used for creating and selling wordpress themes and plugins ?\n\nAs I said before, using != modifying, and if you intend to distribute the source code of the PHP interpreter with your premium plugins, then you should read the license. I am not aware of any plugin author who does that though.\n\nAgain the themes and plugins will be sold not packages installed by vvv.\n\nNot sure what you're talking about here, or how it's relevant\n\nIt sounds like you have a lot of strange ideas about how licenses work, and misconceptions.

One inside the 'src' folder, another inside the 'build' folder. It seems the site is using the build folder. However, the git ignore on the public folder has rules for the 'src' folder. So, what is the purpose of these two folders?\n\nThe src folder gets built by the WP core build tools, and the output is the build folder. It's the build folder that actually gets run. Think of it like a C/C++ program, the src folder is the .h and .cpp files, and the build folder is the .exe.\nBut this is specific to WP Core development, unless you're contributing to core, you should just use the custom site template. you can create as many generic WP installs as you want and they're good for client/theme/plugin dev\n\nalso, how do I tell VVV to install only TwentySeventeen theme, and not the others?\n\nThis is just what comes with a WP CLI install, VVV doesn't define which themes to grab. If you look at the provision script here:\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template/blob/master/provision/vvv-init.sh#L26\nIt just downloads and install WP, and anything extra you get came with WP out of the box.\nHaving said that, if you forked the custom site template, and modified that script, you could make it install other themes. You could even copy the provision folder into a new repo and use that as your site template, and put client themes and plugins in there, as well as provisioner modifications. Because the contents of the src folder get turned into the build folder.\nThe src folder contains an unbuilt version of WP, uncompiled stylesheets,\nJavaScript files that haven't been minified and transpired etc\nThe tools take the stuff in the src folder and do their business and put\nthe result in the build folder. Think of it as the difference between a big\nbox of Lego as the src folder, and an assembled Lego deathstar as the build\nfolder. Src gets put into tools and the output gets out in build\nThe reason you don't get these folders when you download WordPress from the\nwebsite is because this isn't a release of WordPress, it's for core\ndevelopment, aka modifying WP core itself to make a new version\nThat built version then gets repackaged into a release and that's what you\nsee, so yes, you ARE running the build folder version, it was just moved\nout of that folder zipped up and uploaded to .org\nShould you use it for plugin development? If you really want to but that\nsite is intended for contributing to WordPress. You should use the custom\nsite template instead which gives you a normal install\nOn Fri, 7 Sep 2018 at 14:59, brsastre notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHi tomj,\nThank you for your extended answer.\nSorry, but I still don't get the src and build folders thing.\nBefore using VVV i used to dowonload a wordpress install, run it, and all\nI had was a single wordpress folder with the contents inside.\nI don't get it.

Thanks for spotting the duplication :) I think removal of unused packages would be nice, but considering the extension to provisions, and unforeseen consequences like the one I mentioned, it might be more trouble than it's worth prior to VVV 3 which makes it all a moot point. On this org, it's mostly just taking the provisioning of packages etc and doing it in CI to generate a prebuilt box. So 2.1.3 added support for project specific vagrant plugins:\n\nhttps://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/pull/10037\nBut it looks like it broke some things:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/52093653/vagrant-2-1-3-doensnt-see-plugin-disksize\nOne of the changes in 2.1.4 looks to have addressed the issue here:\nhttps://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/commit/e4da39c011bf5476a1064afbb57904db35ce111f\n\nhost/windows: Fix SMB list parsing when extra fields are included [GH-10156]\n\nAs well as hotfixes to plugin wrangling\nI would update to 2.1.4, and try again. If you have no luck, uninstall Vagrant with the uninstaller/uninstall script, then install 2.1.2. Specifically, in 2.1.3 it looks like once a plugin was loaded, the vagrant file needed reloading so that it could use the plugin, but that wasn't happening. Did you update to Vagrant 2.1.3 prior to doing this? If so, update to 2.1.4. If you run vagrant --version and it reports 2.1.3, then you're running a botched vagrant release. They tried to introduce a new feature that broke vagrant plugins and released 2.1.4 shortly afterwards to address the issue.\n2.1.2 and 2.1.4 are known to work, so download 2.1.4 and install that. I'm going to mark this as closed. The problem is that Vagrant plugins were broken in Vagrant v2.1.3, don't use v2.1.3.\nEither update to 2.1.4 or downgrade to 2.1.2.

We can probably move things into the .vvv folder and then circle back and see what to do next.\nIt might also be worth allowing vvv-custom.yml to specify the default folder sites go in, and use www as the default value, then change that to \"\" to test. For the moment I've decided that moving www up one level can be done in the future once some things are figured out, since /srv/www gets mapped on to it, and that would go away if changed. Speaking with @LoreleiAurora though we need to map individual site folders rather than the entire folder. I'm thinking we need a dedicated contributor mode option, so we can change dashboard messaging etc. hmmm I've not seen that before, will have to test further. What was the command ran? You sure it wasn't just 2 vagrant commands && together?. ooo what did you use for that?

So that templates provisioner uses PHP to do all its work. I think a lot of basic stuff could be done via WP CLI to replicate most of what it does. I'm not a big fan of the inline JSON in YAML though, I'd prefer to see things 100% YAML so that the file can be checked with a schema and validator.

In future it's much easier to run vagrant up --provision or if it's already turned on vagrant provision.

Don't think too much about it, both work, it was more that you ran vagrant up first, which was redundant, because the first thing vagrant reload then does is turn it off and on again. So just running vagrant reload --provision or vagrant up --provision would have halved the time it took\nI can guess at what the issue is, but your email client has mangled the YAML file, can you share it as a gist or embed it directly via markdown, confirming it hasn't been mangled.\n\nMy suspicion is that you added a site but didn't add a site template, and then expected VVV to create the folder and fill it with things ( despite there being no template to do that ).\nVVV creates the folder by doing a git clone of a site template. If you don't provide one, it doesn't create one, because there is no repo to clone.\nSo you're going to have to create that folder yourself, and then you'll need to manually recreate a site template inside that folder.

I've tested by reprovisioning an existing VM after clearing out the log folder, and destroying and recreating it, each time the log folder was writable.

Extending this to utilities is not as easy, I wouldn't hold out hope ( and it isn't needed for that PR ). Note that this issue is primarily aimed at site templates for the moment, any utility would need to take the work done for site templates and translate it to whatever the utility needed since a utility may have wildly differing requirements whereas a site template is a much narrower use.

In which case the correct course of action is to remove the link, or point it to the adding a new sites chapter. That can be done via https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/varyingvagrantvagrants.org. I've removed the link int he docs and replaced it with a reference to the adding a new site chapter. hmm that's suspicious, we not long released v2.3, so master and develop are near identical. There's nothing to cause such a difference\n\nPerhaps the VM is just broken, running vagrant destroy && vagrant up --provision to destroy it and rebuild it might be what you need to do. I also suspect that provisioning a new VVV on the master branch in a different folder would work for the same reason it worked with the develop branch. Updating the VB Guest additions via the vagrant plugin vagrant-vbguest may also help, as might vagrant box update, but keep in mind that if you update the box, or do the destroy/reload, you might loose your databases. Check that the DB backups have been made first. Also note that you don't need the WP develop install to do client work or plugin development. That site is intended for work on WP Core itself, contributor days, trac tickets etc.\nA standard site template like the first site is more than enough for 99% of what needs doing, provisions faster, and gives you a standard install, rather than a core dev install. I added a PR that renames them to:\n\none.wordpress.test\ntwo.wordpress.test\ntrunk.wordpress.test\n\nThen adds descriptions, specifically mentioning plugin development, to the first 2. True, but some people have mistaken it or when it's explained it isn't obvious to them, so I'm keen to make things as clear as possible. This was done and is in v2.4. This will need changes to the associated docs too. are you sure that's not because Ondrej made a mistake yesterday for a few hours?. @JoeHell02 can we see your vvv-custom.yml? And a provisioner log? Did you check nothing went wrong during provisioning? Or did you just wait until the command finished then tried to load things in the browser?. @JoeHell02 can you post as a gist or in a code block? The photo of the config file isn't formatted or searchable. The problem is here:\nyaml\n  #example-site:\n  #  repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template.git\n  #  hosts:\n  #    africome-test:    repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template-develop.git\n    allow_customfile: true    hosts:     -africome.test    #- my-example-site.test\nThis isn't valid:\n\nhalf the sites definition is smushed on to a single line that isn't indented correctly\nthe name of the site is commented out with a #\nThe site template repo is on the same line as the site name, and also commented out\n\nIn a YAML file, everything is significant, needs to be on its own line, and indented correctly. # is for commenting stuff out. I'd also advise against allow_customfile, custom vagrant files are a great way to break things, only use them if you absolutely know what you're doing ( aka you could have built VVV yourself but decided to save time )\nit should look like this:\nyaml\n  africome-test:\n    repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template.git\n    hosts:\n      - africome.test. You should be able to do it in any app, as long as you stick to spaces and it follows standard YAML. In this case the YAML formatting was valid, but it wasn't a valid VVV config, we'd need a schema checker for that\n@JoeHell02 you should find things easier with an editor such as Atom, VS Code, or Sublime. They'll indent automatically on new lines, and add syntax highlighting. Also they're good for taking notes :). I don't see anything wrong with that vvv-custom.yml\nJust to be clear, it's vvv-custom.yml not vvv-config.yml we're talking about right? vvv-config.yml is just the default. does it show in the list on vvv.test? And does the folder get created?. and you saved and reprovisioned, is there no mention of it in the output when reprovisioning?. Reordering the sites in vvv-custom.yml won't do anything other than change the order they're provisioned in. It won't fix anything, and shouldn't make any difference.\nIf it does fix something, it's probably a syntax error that were accidentally fixed during re-ordering. Can we have a comparison with non-VM speeds on the same machine? Also, running the tests in a non-mapped folder inside the VM, e.g. /tmp to see how much of the performance is impacted by file system speeds\nIndeed it is possible to simply run PHPUnit on the host. Something similar can be done with vagrant2.1.4 it just require a little extra work ( it's what broke vagrant 2.1.3 ).\nThis would mean updating the vagrant requirement though. I don't see how this fixes that issue. It provides a mechanism for utilities to add rules yes, but it doesn't simplify site templates modifying the nginx config, and I'm unsure what /etc/nginx/custom-rules/ is for, especially since every rule would be in effect on every WP site. I'd suggest streamlining it to the utilities rules change, then using the tideways PR as a means of testing it. hmmm this bug is phrased in Nginx terms not VVV terms.\nCan this be translated as:\n\nWhen a user defines a site with more than 1 host in vvv-custom.yml and provisions with the custom site template, the additional hosts fail to provision? My understanding is that the parameter you're modifying is not a valid server_name, but the internal VVV name of the site, e.g. the folder that gets created, not a host. Would it not have made sense for vvv_hosts to be the modified value?\n\nAdditionally, I've not encountered the issue you're seeing, can I see an issue raised with instructions on how to reproduce?. I don't understand how to get to this situation, can you give instructions\non how to reproduce? The only way I can see to generate this scenario with\nthe given config would involve invalid YAML which would prevent\nprovisioning getting that far. The site name is the main identifier of a\nsite that determines its name it's folder etc, I do not see how you could\narrive at this problem\nThis scenario should not be possible.

Note that there have been changes to both code referenced in the develop branch. Are you sure this isn't a bug in your vvv-nginx.conf?\nhttps://github.com/runofthemill/custom-site-template/blob/master/provision/vvv-nginx.conf.tmpl\nNotice how in the first server block you used just {vvv_hosts} and it result in the correct output of:\nnginx\nserver_name nginxtest.test www.nginxtest.test;\nBut the second directive on line 10 that triggered the error is:\nnginx\nserver_name  .{vvv_hosts} ~^{vvv_hosts}\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\\.xip\\.io$;\nWhich generates:\nnginx\nserver_name  .nginxtest.test www.nginxtest.test ~^{vvv_hosts}\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\\.xip\\.io$;\nAside from the stray . at the start I would expect that the $ needs escaping. I do see the second {vvv_hosts} though, but I'm guessing you want xip.io support so you can do subdomain multisites?. Would it not make more sense to do something like this?\nnginx\nserver_name ~^(.*)\\.\\d+\\./d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\\.xip\\.io$;\nMy understanding is that even if it replaced the second vvv_hosts in that line, it would be incompatible with multiple hosts defined. Also vvv_hosts should be available inside vvv-init.sh, as is the YAML file via the helper functions, you could just implement the replacement yourself, and insert multiple xip.io entries, one for each domain. I don't think a scan is necessary, especially since this will add hosts for utilities that aren't being used.\nSince we already know which utilities are active, we should just loop through them and assume the location of vvv_hosts which will be faster, the same way that we load the provision.sh. > The problem of using the utilities is that they can have a different folder name compared to the utilities name. Right now the folder for the tideways is xhgui but the tool is another one because xhgui is the UI.\n\nWith this implementation we ignore this problem.\n\nI don't follow? If we load php70 in the core utility then that means core/php70/provision.sh gets executed, so why not skip the scan and then load core/php70/vvv_hosts if it exists?\nA scan would load all utilities hosts files, which could be problematic, especially if some utilities are alternatives to each other, and implement the same thing with shared hosts. That and I can see people misusing it by nesting folders.\nI'm also keen for things to be as fast as they can given that we have to consider time to provision, I'd like to be able to parallelise things in the future, and I'm also keen to deprecate vvv_hosts scanning in favour of the config file and having the file in a specific place, ideally provision/vvv_hosts and load it the same way vvv-nginx.conf and vvv-init.sh are loaded. I'm keen for everything to have a proper place, and since this is something we're adding I'd prefer VVV to check in that proper place rather than search for the file.\nSo for a utility, a folder should contain everything, so for tideways I would expect a tideways/provision.sh and a tideways/vvv-hosts. One could even adjust the VVV utility provisioner so that vvv-nginx.conf is loaded into the appropriate place automatically.\nThe important part being that there is only 1 correct place and answer, and only what's enabled gets loaded. No scans, no multiple correct places, strict simple and clear. Speaking of which, it would be good to adjust things so that vvv-init.sh can be used instead of provision.sh so that the mental model of site templates can be reused and things make more sense.

Copy & pasting the splash screen like @jwjcmw did is the easiest way to share it. this?\nhttps://github.com/laravel/homestead/blob/master/scripts/homestead.rb#L127-L156\nCan you share your version if you got it working in VVV's vagrant file?. hmmm, Vagrant should be doing that automatically, generating its own SSH key pair and copying it into the VM so that you don't have to copy your own private key. I'd consider raising an issue on the vagrant repo as well. @jwjcmw have you by any chance attempted to setup or use an SSH Agent on Windows in the past on that machine? And which Prompt are you using to run commands?. can you adjust the vagrant file, so that around line 222, this:\nruby\n  # Configurations from 1.0.x can be placed in Vagrant 1.1.x specs like the following.\n  config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |v|\n    v.customize [\"modifyvm\", :id, \"--memory\", vvv_config['vm_config']['memory']]\ninstead looks like this \nruby\n  # Configurations from 1.0.x can be placed in Vagrant 1.1.x specs like the following.\n  config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |v|\n    v.customize [\"modifyvm\", :id, \"--memory\", vvv_config['vm_config']['memory']]\n    v.gui = true\nThen make sure the VM is halted via the VirtualBox interface, and do a vagrant up. Note that it will show up in a window. I'd like you to describe what happens inside the VM, if it asks you any questions or presents any options. Some people elsewhere report that when this happens, it's usually because the VM Operating system has asked a question and is waiting for an answer before it continues. > This may be a Vagrant issue...there must be some reason that the Homestead folks added that option in, and why the guide I followed for Windows had me utilize it.\nOlder versions of vagrant had this issue a lot, especially 1.x, but the relevant code and the library used were rewritten for Vagrant v2, and even on the 1.x branch it was mostly much older versions, updating the software usually fixed it. Related to #1657 the only part I'm unsure of is that this code runs after the vagrant hosts updater plugin aliases are set, so I'm unsure if I should move that check to the end or if I should instead redo it, @LoreleiAurora ?. After talking with @LoreleiAurora it seems this won't work as the utilities aren't cloned until after the hosts updater is set. Otherwise on the first provision the hosts won't work. The same is true of site templates that use vvv-hosts, hence why we use vvv-custom.yml instead.\nTo fix this we'll need to fork the hosts updater plugin\n/cc @Mte90 . @Mte90 there's a problem though, we'd need to force all VVV users to use your fork, and we'd need to ensure it doesn't clash with an existing install of hostsupdater.\nInstead, we'd need our own fork, in VVV itself, which requires a lot of Vagrant file changes ( not as a vagrant plugin ). It's decidedly non-trivial. I don't see this happening quickly. @Mte90 there's a problem though, we'd need to force all VVV users to use your fork, and we'd need to ensure it doesn't clash with an existing install of hostsupdater.\nInstead, we'd need our own fork, in VVV itself, which requires a lot of Vagrant file changes ( not as a vagrant plugin ). It's decidedly non-trivial. I don't see this happening quickly. hmm if you can get it into hostsupdater, at some point merging it into VVV would be good as we wouldn't need to bundle the gem on contributor day and could remove a step. We can do this via vagrant itself if we bump the minimum version number with project specific plugins.\nHowever, I'm still mindful that on contributor days we'd need to download that plugin, and that sounds painful. One WCEU we were waiting 30 minutes to download the hostsupdater plugin even though it was only 10kb due to wifi congestion\nIncluding it in VVV itself seems the most robust path forward. to run npm on the host you need to install npm on the host. If you're running it on the host, then it doesn't matter if it's in VVV or just on your desktop, this is either an npm issue or a Foundationpress issue. I'm leaning towards Foundationpress and how it uses gulp ( it looks like npm runs fine in your log, it's the scripts that get loaded by NPM from FoundationPress that are the problem ). @atimmer to future proof a little what's the newest LTS Node version we can use?. so part of this is that we install node via apt-get here and Node 6 is the latest that Ubuntu 14 has to offer. An alternative method of installing, or an apt-source with the newer version will be needed\nUpdating the Ubuntu box itself to 16 or 18 is non-trivial and would involve forcing people to back up their dev environment and restore on to a clean slate. We should be able to switch over to the nodesource PPA\nhttps://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-an-ubuntu-14-04-server\nhttps://askubuntu.com/questions/594656/how-to-install-the-latest-versions-of-nodejs-and-npm#635469. Something like this:\ncurl https://deb.nodesource.com/gpgkey/nodesource.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -\nsudo apt-add-repository \"deb https://deb.nodesource.com/node_10.x $(lsb_release -sc) main\"\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nodejs\nI'm not sure if that will update existing VVV boxes to Node 10, or if they will remain on 6 though. Adding the apt repo should be easy as we have provisioner code to do that already, and it already tries to install that package. Turns out we already do this for Node 6. @atimmer can you verify all is well with #1662?. Tested just now, before:\n```\n~/dev/www/vvv git::tomjn-node-10 \n\u276f vagrant ssh\n\n\\ V\\ V\\ V / Varying Vagrant Vagrants\n _/_/_/  Have a nice day \nvagrant@vvv:~$ node --version\nv6.14.4\nvagrant@vvv:~$ exit\nlogout\nConnection to 127.0.0.1 closed.\n```\nAfter a avagrant provision`:\n```\n~/dev/www/vvv git::tomjn-node-10 \n\u276f vagrant ssh\n\n\\ V\\ V\\ V / Varying Vagrant Vagrants\n _/_/_/  Have a nice day \nvagrant@vvv:~$ node --version\nv10.1.0\nvagrant@vvv:~$ exit\nlogout\nConnection to 127.0.0.1 closed.\n``. @Mte90 you might be able to use this to put the tideways UI in a subfolder ofvvv.test` rather than a subdomain.

Awesome, glad you got it sorted. We do list hosts updater in the software requirements section, though in future a code check that forces VVV to abort if it isn't present might be desirable. So those are Nginx access and error logs, there's currently no way I'm aware of to splice apart the PHP error log so that it gets put in that folder ( or a means of configuring VVV to do so ), if you know of a way to do it I'm keen to get it done\n\nIn the meantime, I've started on pull requests to change the names of those log files to nginx-access.log and nginx-error.log. As an aside, VVV has never had per site PHP error logs to my knowledge, if it did it was in the pre-2.0 days.

That's definitely related, I've no idea why Avast is showing as the certificate authority, it should be VVV internal. Notice the issuing CA is VVV internal and matches the root certificate added. Yours says Avast. I don't know where that certificate came from or how it ended up there, but it is not a VVV certificate\n\n. It would appear the cause of this is a \"Security feature\" of Avast:\nhttps://blog.avast.com/2015/05/25/explaining-avasts-https-scanning-feature/\nIt's intercepting all your secure connections, stripping out the security, scanning/etc then putting a self signed certificate on so the browser still thinks it's secure.\nUnless Avast has exceptions that you can apply, this won't work with VVV or any other local environment that self signs or has it's own certificate authority. I'd also be very suspicious that Avast is doing this.. Although, based on a reading of the blog post, this should work, you'd just see Avast instead of VVV certificates, but it seems Avast TLS certificates are broken. So I would expect to see this issue on all https sites, not just those local/VVV. @StudioMediaWeb not sure what this PR is for, but it contains no changes so i'm going to close it. Thanks for being patient and thanks for the changes :). @yaacine  there's some super important information you left out ( there's a reason it's pre-filled in the new issue template ).\nWithout, diagnosing and figuring out the solution is 1000x more difficult and in a lot of cases impossible.

I'm closing this out as the OP became unresponsive. Of note, this has never been encountered before. Is this an existing VVV instance that just suddenly broke? A brand new instance created completely from scratch? An existing but older instance that was updated then reprovisioned?\nAlso, which version of go is installed?. hmm I was going to ask which version of MailHog you were using but I notice it doesn't show a version number in my own setup.\nThis means it's likely it's pulling master, but I'm not sure. @rcstr downloading the 1.0.0 release and installing via that route might be what we need to do in the future, but I'm unsure how that works as the release just hands you a binary with no instructions, so I don't know if this is a CLI installer, a precompiled binary, or something else. I'm not sure how to fix that, all I know is that the code that fails for you has worked great for me across several versions and multiple tests building and rebuilding VMs\nIf it's possible to jettison go as a dependency by using the prebuilt MailHog binaries then I'd much prefer to do that, especially as it shortens provision time. How would you advise?. I think the mailhog binary is literally the binary for mailhog, and we don't need to download and install go etc, a PR that swaps out all the mailhog and go installation for a simple curl request with the config setup would save provisioning time and make things more reliable. I got it downloading and running with the mailhog binaries from github in #1706, so this should be a non-issue in v2.5.

Thanks!!. hmmm, have you applied either of those fixes yourself? If so which worked best? From first glance, the second looks the cleanest. @DaveLak was this a vagrant up or a reprovision? I suspect this may require either a reprovision, or would only work on a brand new box. If the latter is the case, then this prevents existing users from switching.\n\nHopefully, VirtualBox is updated and this warning goes away, at which point we can ask that people update. Further research suggests a fix was silently added in VirtualBox 5.2.22, and a bug was present in the vagrant warning check, see:\nhttps://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/10481\nI expect the fix is to update when the next Vagrant release comes out, so I'm going to close this, and recommend updating when 2.3/2.2.3 is released. This mostly helps with handling permissions. I did hope initially it would give a performance boost for file system access but I'm not so sure now, testing and benchmarking needs to be done, I'm punting this off to 2.6+. I've yet to test it myself so I'm in no rush, but I do notice that some users of other similar projects have done this. I removed the virtio changes, so it's just splash screen adjustments now. Is this a new issue on a new instance? Or is this a new issue on an old instance that previously worked? Have you recently updated vagrant or virtualbox?. @harkor I think some clarification is needed:\n\nDoes this only happen on halt?\nWas the VM running at the time, or was it suspended?\nIs the VM functional when it's up?\nDoes this happen on vagrant up?\n\nI also notice you tried to be helpful/concise and only show what you thought was relevant, but can you include an example with the output in its entirety, including the commands you used?. hmmm you should be able to copy paste from your terminal app, or at least pipe the result of the vagrant command into a file. Does it prevent you from halting the VM?\nNote that on halt you can get a vagrant warning, there's a backup script that runs, but if the VM is in a suspended state or if you try to destroy a VM that's already been switched off, it can't run the backup trigger and complains. Sadly there's no option that lets us tell vagrant to only run it if the VM is up\nFor example, after running vagrant suspend, I would get this on halt:\n```\n\u276f vagrant halt\n\n\\ V\\ V\\ V / Varying Vagrant Vagrants\n _/_/_/  v2.4.0-git::tomjn-provision-robustness\nPlatform:   darwin13.4.0 shell:/bin/bash\nVagrant:    2.2.2\nVirtualBox: 5.2.18r124319\nDocs:       https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/\nContribute: https://github.com/varying-vagrant-vagrants/vvv\nDashboard:  http://vvv.test\n==> default: Running triggers before halt ...\n==> default: Running trigger: VVV Pre-Halt...\n==> default: Could not run remote script on default because its state is saved\n==> default: Trigger configured to continue on error...\n==> default: Discarding saved state of VM...\n==> default: [vagrant-hostsupdater] Removing hosts\n```. I doubt this is vagrants fault, several others have provisioned on those versions and it's running locally here. Instead it looks like early on some important things failed to copy for an unknown reason:\ndefault: Bash profile setup and directories.\n    default: cp:\n    default: cannot stat \u2018/srv/config/update-motd.d/00-vvv-bash-splash\u2019\n    default: : No such file or directory\n    default: chmod:\n    default: cannot access \u2018/etc/update-motd.d/00-vvv-bash-splash\u2019\n    default: : No such file or directory\n    default: cp:\n    default: cannot stat \u2018/srv/config/bash_profile\u2019\n    default: : No such file or directory\n    default: cp:\n    default: cannot stat \u2018/srv/config/bash_aliases\u2019\n    default: : No such file or directory\n    default: cp:\n    default: cannot stat \u2018/srv/config/vimrc\u2019\n    default: : No such file or directory\n    default: cp:\n    default: cannot stat \u2018/srv/config/subversion-servers\u2019\n    default: : No such file or directory\n    default: cp:\n    default: cannot stat \u2018/srv/config/subversion-config\u2019\n    default: : No such file or directory\nIf the config subfolder etc intact in the VVV dir? And does this happen on a fresh setup in another folder on develop?. Also, can you run vagrant ssh and check the contents/presence of /srv/config and /vagrant/config inside the VM?. Specifically, it appears the shared folders didn't mount into the VM. Then shared folders is broken for some reason, are the VB Guest Additions up to date? Does this happen on a fresh VVV ( use a different folder to do this )?. hmm, after the vagrant hosts updater section, it usually mounts the shared folders, but that section is missing in your output. E.g. here is a snippet from a vagrant up I did just now:\n==> default: [vagrant-hostsupdater]   192.168.50.4  local.wordpress.local  # VAGRANT: d8475ddbd85f331ab03aba6c37a84ba7 (default) / b83f9559-e606-42dd-8db9-50154fe23f17\n==> default: [vagrant-hostsupdater]   192.168.50.4  local.wordpress.dev  # VAGRANT: d8475ddbd85f331ab03aba6c37a84ba7 (default) / b83f9559-e606-42dd-8db9-50154fe23f17\n==> default: [vagrant-hostsupdater]   192.168.50.4  hashes.test  # VAGRANT: d8475ddbd85f331ab03aba6c37a84ba7 (default) / b83f9559-e606-42dd-8db9-50154fe23f17\n==> default: [vagrant-hostsupdater] This operation requires administrative access.

Enable SMB file sharing by following the instructions below:\n\nOpen \"System Preferences\"\nClick \"Sharing\"\nCheck the \"On\" checkbox next to \"File Sharing\"\nClick \"Options\"\nCheck \"Share files and folders using SMB\"\nCheck the \"On\" checkbox next to your username within \"Windows File Sharing\"\nClick \"Done\". I wouldn't expect it to, but you might need to vagrant up --provision to recreate it, even if it's just an empty file, touch should do the job. If a new install works fine, then a vagrant destroy and recreating it would probably fix this. The only thing to keep in mind is that the DB is stored inside the VM. You might want to check the backups VVV creates, or take your own copies via vagrant ssh and rsync. Although, I'd prefer to identify the cause of the problem\n\n\nAs an aside, do you have the vagrant bindfs plugin installed? If so, try this branch https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1686 to see if it makes much of a change, it's unlikely to, but on the offchance. And that's on the new VM you just succesfully provisioned? :( that's unfortunate. At this point I'd suggest halting the VM, and doing a clean vagrant install, with the uninstall/cleaner tool. Also, which vagrant plugins are you using?. I'm going to close this out for now, new versions of both Vagrant and VirtualBox ( 2.2.2 and 6.0 ) have come out in the meantime, so it may not be an issue now. Also v2.5 of VVV is iminent. The theme name has nothing to do with the database name, did you mean the site name? Can you include what you tried to use in a code block rather than describing with words?. Oh, did you make the change after you provisioned the site?\nFor these kinds of changes you need to reprovision, but if you've already provisioned, then wp-config.php etc will be set up to use the first database name, not the new one. You'll need to reprovision, then manually adjust wp-config.php, or, delete the site from vvv-custom.yml, and the folder, and reprovision to recreate it with the new wp-config.php. VVV provisioners won't edit existing files once they're in place as that's opening a massive can of worms\nAll in all, though, some if else statements in wp-config.php and some SQL import/export adjustments should mean you don't need the database name to match production for it to work with the same codebase.. Also keep in mind that a vagrant up is just an on switch, it won't reprovision/redo the vvv-custom.yml unless you vagrant up --provision or vagrant provision. >  The Network tab indicates that most of that is due to TTFB (screenshots). I'm not sure if this is a VVV issue, or some other issue\nSo TTFB could be caused by anything here, it could be that you're using a spinning disk drive and it's busy, it could be that your VM has less memory than the server at the other end, or that you're making lots of remote requests.

I doubt VVV will ever compete directly with a decent fresh VPS at a major host purely from a physics and $$$ point of view. Those VMs might be containers, or they'll be running on a tier 1 Hypervisor such as Xen or ESX rather than a tier 2 HyperVisor such as VirtualBox or VMWare Workstation, I'd also expect they'd be running much more expensive CPUs such as Xeons than most consumer hardware.\nHaving said that, you can't make everybody buy a 20 core CPU on contributor day, or haul a 1kw power supply on a train :) But I'm sure there are things that can be done to improve what we have\n\nOr neither? Or something else?\n\nSomething else that struck me is that TTFB being high suggests that there are output buffers preventing things from being sent until the page has finished generating so that post processing can occur, e.g. the Autoptimise plugin.\nUndoing that won't make the page any faster to generate, but it will reduce TTFB.

It could be that their API is slow, or your network is slow, who knows without more information. e.g. on my own sites homepage:\n\nCompared to the WP Admin updater showing large chunks of time spent on remote requests\n\nOr with query monitor, we can get a list of queries, and remote requests, with timings:\n\n\nWithout this information, it could be that the culprit is this:\nphp\n<?php\nsleep( 5 );\nThere's no way of knowing from the frontend. e.g. on my own sites homepage:\n\nCompared to the WP Admin updater showing large chunks of time spent on remote requests\n\nOr with query monitor, we can get a list of queries, and remote requests, with timings:\n\n\nWithout this information, it could be that the culprit is this:\nphp\n<?php\nsleep( 5 );\nThere's no way of knowing from the frontend. @cagross I don't think the chrome inspector tools view of TTFB, or any client side metrics are particularly helpful, I'd focus exclusively on server side metrics.\nI'd also establish a baseline, right now you're talking about an install that has a tonne of unknowns that only you can see ( some of which you may not even consider relevant, but how would you know ).\nSo set up a standard WP with the default theme, and measure on that. If TTFB is still an issue there, then we can continue. Else it's quite unlikely to be VVV.\nAlso, there's no information about queries, time spent in hooks, etc. Query Monitor provides a lot of information, if it's taking a long time to generate results, what exactly is it doing? Poor performance is too generic and vague, I need you to be more specific, and time to first byte isn't a problem, it's a symptom\nAdditionally, is TTFB a problem for readme.html?

Would that be a better metric?\nHelpful, but not too much, these are broad strokes, too vague.\nFor example, lets say you're complaining that a delivery took 2 weeks. Measuring total delivery time, and analysing your own house won't be particularly helpful in diagnosing why it took 2 weeks. All it does is confirm that it took a long time.\nYou're in the same boat, client side metrics have given you everything you could have gotten already. Now you need to move to diagnosing the cause, be that remote requests, file system manipulation, queries, or something else. Poor performance is too vague, more digging needed\n\nOK. What about using the wordpress-default site that comes with VVV? That is of course devoid of any extra plugins and media, but it also should have a reasonably simple and default database. That site loads blazing fast for me, as expected. Doesn't exhibit any TTFB at all. Conversely, if I switch my site to the default 2019 theme,\nI did some more tests on the default VVV WordPress site, and can perhaps better articulate the issue I'm seeing. With the default VVV WordPress site, there are no page load speed issues--the home page has page generation times in the 0.01 s range (or less), as expected. \n\nThis suggests this isn't a VVV problem at all, and it's to be expected that adding plugins would increase page load. The extra work plugins do isn't free afterall :)\n\nActivating Wordfence causes a ~2 second increase in page generation time. So once I install and activate all 12 of my plugins, the page generation time jumps to the 8-10 second range. The same is not true on my remote server. On my remote server, if I deactivate all plugins and switch to the default 2019 theme, the page generation time for the home page drops to ~0.1 s, as expected. If I then install Wordfence, the page generation time simply jumps to ~0.2-0.4 seconds, not the 2-3 seconds that occurs on the default VVV site.

Personally I would avoid WordFence ( though it doesn't make much sense running it on a local environment ).\nUsing the analogy from earlier, the delivery supervisor has discovered that the delivery man logged a number of items labelled ??? that increased delivery time. Further investigation needed. E.g. is this time spent doing queries?\nAlso keep in mind that you don't know what's going on at the remote end, there may be mitigations that speed things up, or there may be one component of the system that's significantly faster.\nBut until you identify the performance bottleneck, which you still haven't done, this is all speculation. Telling me performance is slow is unhelpful. Telling me database queries are slow on the other hand, or that file system access is slow, etc is super helpful.\nI'd also note that you should not expect 2 different systems to perform the same. VVV and SiteGround will never have the same performance in all areas. Even 2 VVV instances will never have the same performance. My SSD and memory may be faster than yours, you might have a newer computer. My internet might be running over fibre and yours over copper.\nIt could even be as simple as your shared host having a basic object cache installed, or the plugins behaving differently ( or even using PHP 5.6 in VVV, and 7.2 in production ). > Right O.

Did you try the LAPs plugin?

A quick check of WordFence suggests a big chunk of curl usage, so WordFence may or may not be making remote requests, and it wouldn't show up in the tooling. hmm still working on filesystem benchmarking, but a note to keep in mind is that tools such as Query Monitor and LAPs rely on the WP HTTP apis being used, e.g. wp_remote_get.

I've tried a few times to look for an appropriate filesystem benchmark but:\n\n\nNobody seems to have settled on a single tool\nNone of the tools are straight forward and come with a bewildering array of options that have major impacts on the results\nCross platform support is needed else how are we meant to compare results?\nSome of them require reserving file space to prevent caching, but I don't have 150GB of spare disk space to throw at it, and I know that Vagrant based shares rely on micro caching, so such a test would represent a worst case scenario, and that any test would need to be ran multiple times as mounted folders and non-mounted folders have different performance metrics\n\nPut simply the TLDR:\n\nYou installed WordFence and it made your site slower, but you noticed the effect was greater in VVV than on an unknown remote system in a data center\nYour database backups run faster when the database is smaller\nRemote requests are awful for performance and can have wildly different performance characteristics even on the same system based on variables such as time of day, current internet bandwidth usage in your city, etc\n\nI really don't know what I can suggest at this point, other than that we have yet to actually identify anything concrete that's slow, and I really don't see the value in making WordFence run fast or even running it in VVV, and fundamentally disagree with how the Photonic plugin works. There are plenty of major performance improvements that can be made here using pure WP expertise without making the local dev tech faster.\nThere are many other advantages to local development beyond speed, such as not having to edit files remotely, better debugging, or the whole not developing in production thing, but so far we've yet to identify anything that's responsible, so other than generic platitudes I'm at a loss as to what to suggest\nThe root cause may just be that you didn't spend as much money on SSD's and CPU's as your hosting provider. Sure you can make it run just as fast for low loads, but a child can pick up a piece of paper just as quickly as My Olympia, it's not the same as a 100kg weight.

It contains a proper fix, Packagecloud.io changed their GPG keys and we were caught unawares. #1702 has been merged, it doesn't contain the --force-yes flag, which shouldn't be necessary, though I'll be adding that in a separate PR just for the added robustness. @lidocaine thanks, https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1703 follows up with the other robustness changes so that should the key change again in future it'll be less failure prone.

It's in the develop branch now. there aren't many differences between master and develop at the moment, mostly bug fixes. I'm hoping to do a release before the end of the week but I'm ill at the moment so I don't have a lot of energy to get stuff done. Specifically I want to test and verify that #1704 doesn't cause any issues for people so I can merge it, and I want someone to double check https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1705.

This should fix a problem that's preventing new VVV instances from provisioning\nhttps://twitter.com/packagecloudio/status/1082362236369162240. Thanks for the changes! I think we need to do some testing on other peoples machines to make sure it doesn't introduce any unwanted behaviour, otherwise it looks straight forward. @elminson for future reference if you want to test, you can create a new VVV instance, but switch to the branch with your changes before provisioning. Then if all works as expected, report back or leave a PR review\nAlso, thanks @Mte90 :). closes #1679. This is fixed in the develop branch\nOn Sat, 12 Jan 2019 at 15:45, locougil notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nCan someone help me please?\nThank you so much\nHere is what i got on the terminal

Marking this as closed as it's fixed in develop, for those unsure they can run git checkout develop and git pull to switch over. Otherwise I'm aiming for a v2.5.1 release once a certain PR has gone through final testing. hmm, is this the longstanding bug where you have to have all the meta environment or none of it, and the moment you try to have wordcamp but not .org for example, none of it works?. Once this is done I think a release for v2.5.1 is due. Thanks for this, but this leads to a longstanding problem that has stopped us just updating the box in the past.\n\nThe problem is that the database was moved out of a mounted shared folder, and into the VM to improve performance when VVV 2 was released. Now, if we merged this, on the next provision everybody would be updated, wiping their local databases in the process.\nIf it weren't for this we'd have switched to Ubuntu 16 a long time ago. Moving to 16 was intended for VVV 3, which was planned to be pre-built via CI so that you could vagrant box update on a regular basis making it faster to provision and easier to keep up with newer distro releases.\nFor the moment I think a mechanism for migrating the database storage from /srv/database to /vagrant/database in such a way that it doesn't break for existing users would be good. Once that's done, PR's like this no longer need to fear data loss as a side effect. This does mean that we'll need a few things:\n\nIf no existing VM exists, use Ubuntu 18\nIf the database is already mapped to a shared folder, switch to Ubuntu 18 ( VVV 1 users had the shared folder so VVV 2 falls back to it for compatibility reasons )\nIf a VM exists, and it's using Ubuntu 14, try to migrate the database folder so that on the next provision, it upgrades to 18\n\nI'm curious if mounting the folder via rsync might be a possible solution? What are your thoughts on migrating everybody over?\nThere's also the issue of an Ubuntu 18 provisioner not working with an Ubuntu 14 VM, perhaps a speciail provision-migration-14.sh might be needed?. I spoke with @LoreleiAurora over the weekend, and a move to 18 is needed in the longrun, I'm still concerned about breaking things for existing users, ideally they should be able to upgrade with:\ngit pull\nvagrant destroy --force\nvagrant up --provision\nBut I'm concerned about data loss and would like the database thing sorted, preferably sooner rather than later. The question is, how do we migrate VMs that have their DB stored inside the VM, to instead store it in a mount, without destroying or making that data inaccessible?.

This closes https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/1669\nTested with:\nshell\nvagrant provision\nvagrant halt\nvagrant up --no-provision. Looks good with a fresh provision here. there's already a bash function for grabbing values from the config in the sites provisioner. for now yes, personally I think it should come with it by default, I'd suggest naming it something like install_recommended_plugins rather than plugin-dev. or maybe even just querymonitor. I'm not so keen as it doesn't really indicate what it means and isn't self\ndocumenting. It also implies that you can put a list of plugins in which\nisn't how it works\nOn Wed, 6 Mar 2019 at 16:39, Benjamin Lu notifications@github.com wrote:\n\ni was going to suggest\ncustom:\n    wp_type: subdirectory\n    wp_version: 4.6.4\n   wp_plugin: true\nI was thinking wp_plugin if it is set is true, then we can install query\nmonitor, if we need more then all we just need to do just add each plugin\nand activate.\nwould this make more sense.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/1716#issuecomment-470180589,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AADl522acgS6GN-JjuteLOE-srhpnSyGks5vT-9XgaJpZM4Z_Zha\n.\n. lets start with that, I think being able to disable it is important, we might also want to update it as well. A bit of testing suggests we can do a request to the github api and figure out the latest release, then do a version compare against the current version files contents\n\nhttps://api.github.com/repos/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/releases/latest\nhttps://developer.github.com/v3/git/tags/. @zackphilipps  can you confirm that you can use git clone on the host machine?\n\nalso lists a bunch of repos that I don't recognize at all and says I have read access to them.\n\nFor me it says my username, and that I can use git or hg but that shell access is disabled, no lists of repositories. Some more things:\n\nIs this new or has this always been the case?\nWhen you say that's what you get, that's inside the VM, what about outside the VM on the host?\nAny mentions of deploy key are from bitbuckets end, not VVV\nAre you absolutely sure you have an SSH Agent configured correctly? And that your main SSH key is indeed your main SSH key? Wherever this deploy key is coming from, it's not something I've seen before, and it's not something VVV is bundling\n\nIn the guest VM ( VVV ):\n```\nvagrant@vvv:~$ ssh -T git@bitbucket.org\nWarning: Permanently added the RSA host key for IP address '18.205.93.2' to the list of known hosts.\nlogged in as tomjn.\nYou can use git or hg to connect to Bitbucket. Shell access is disabled.\nvagrant@vvv:~$ \n```\nOn my host OS ( MacOS ) I get the same:\n```\n~/dev/www/vvv git::develop \n\u276f ssh -T git@bitbucket.org\nlogged in as tomjn.\nYou can use git or hg to connect to Bitbucket. Shell access is disabled.\n```\nRight now it's ambiguous what your current status is for all possible configurations, except running the command inside VVV:\n\nThere's no clearly labelled data for what happens with the host system\nIf this is new behaviour, or if it has never worked, or did it fail on an update of a piece of software?\nIf this is an SSH forwarding problem or a bitbucket problem\nYou mention various repositories but censor them, what are they? Who do they belong to?\n\nSo I present the following:\n|                               | VVV   | host OS   |\n|----------------------------   |-----  |---------  |\n| ssh -T git@bitbucket.org    | \ud83d\udeab     |           |\n| ssh -T git@github.com       |       |           |\n| ssh -T git@gitlab.com       |       |           |\nSo that you don't need to faff around with markdown table generators:\n|                               | VVV   | host OS   |\n|----------------------------   |-----  |---------  |\n| `ssh -T git@bitbucket.org`    | \ud83d\udeab     |           |\n| `ssh -T git@github.com`       |       |           |\n| `ssh -T git@gitlab.com`       |       |           |. Also ssh-add -l will list the ssh keys added by their fingerprints, but do this on both the guest VM  and the host OS. Also this doc seems to have a lot more useful commands than I knew about:\nhttps://developer.github.com/v3/guides/using-ssh-agent-forwarding/\nIn particular:\nshell\necho \"$SSH_AUTH_SOCK\"\nssh -v example.com\nssh-add -L\nand some other checks on config files, anything you can share that might allow me to automate checks and raise the alarm would be helpful.

This makes hostupdater a requirement ( which most already consider it to be ), I've no qualms with that, the only other thing is that it also makes Vagrant 2.2 a minimum requirement. > Can I do this perhaps by specifying my own Git repo (instead of https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template.git) in vvv-custom.yml?\n\nYes and no, if you put your own repo in to vvv-custom.yml it would:\n\nclone the repo into the www folder under the given site name\nhave no idea how to provision it\n\nVVV needs at minimum a vvv-nginx.conf to tell it how to serve the site, otherwise it will clone the repo, mount the folders, but nothing more, you'll get the dashboard when you visit the sites URL, and it'll complain it couldn't find nginx files in the provisioning log\nThe simplest and easiest method would be to use the custom site template to create a new WP install, then swap out the database contents, and replace the files\n\nOr would I simply create a default WordPress site in VVV (using the VVV documentation), then replace all the files on my own (either manually, or with Git)?\n\nYou could do that, you could even fork the custom site template and modify vvv-init.sh to do just that, then you could just point VVV to the forked site template.

Some questions:\n\nDo you have any other environments, vagrant boxes, or software that serves things on port 80?\nIs this a brand new VVV instance, or an existing one that's just broken? Did you just update?\nBy the Nginx 404 page do you mean the VVV dashboard with the banner at the top? Can you be more specific? Are you absolutely sure it's the one Nginx provides and not the one Apache provides? What does the text say?\nWhat happens if you visit http://192.168.50.4:80?\n\nI can't find anything in particular in the debug log, but since it's so verbose it's difficult to go through. Does the problem go away if you reprovision with vagrant provision?. Yay :). Installing the hostsupdater is critical, we really should scream at users who don't install it more in the provisioner and figure out why this keeps happening. #1735 means hostsupdater is a requirement in the develop branch now, if it isn't present, it prompts you to install it. Thanks for the heads up, all the docs are markdown files in a git repo, that doc is here:\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/varyingvagrantvagrants.org/blob/master/docs/en-US/troubleshooting/index.md\n GitHubVarying-Vagrant-Vagrants/varyingvagrantvagrants.orgThe code powering the VVV website. Contribute to Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/varyingvagrantvagrants.org development by creating an account on GitHub.\n. > What do you think to make a vvv base box with preinstalled software and store in vagrant cloud?\nI'd love to, in fact we tried a short while back, but the main blocker at the moment is time and resources. We did have a setup on OVH to build VMs to generate the box images but it seems the ability to run VMs on OVH was not intended.\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/Packer.Base\nThe boxes themselves still needed some testing, and there was the problem that VVV 2 switched the databases to be stored inside the VM for performance reasons, rather than in a mounted folder. This means if we update the box for those people they get their databases deleted on the first upgrade. It would however have let us switch to a newer Ubuntu with ease\nRight now, we need somewhere to run the builds though\n GitHubVarying-Vagrant-Vagrants/Packer.BaseUbuntu base images packer builder. Contribute to Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/Packer.Base development by creating an account on GitHub.\n. Not all boxes for all providers have an ubuntu user, so we switched to vagrant which fixed some issues specifically with hyperv. It also cropped up when we tried to build our own boxes.\nThe vagrant user should always be present, afterall mounted folders are owned by the vagrant user.\n\nI've integrated VVV with the provider vagrant-aws\n\nSome production sites run in VMs managed by Vagrant, and there are Vagrant boxes out there that excel at these things.\nKeep in mind however that VVV is intended for local dev, which might sound obvious, but it hasn't been put through the full gamut of security hardening that would be needed to run on a server directly exposed to the internet. There are things you can do with VVV that are great for local development on a machine, but really awful for a server on the web. That's why we don't expose VVV on the local network by default in order to dissuade people from doing this, if not to stop them using it to setup their production websites (which does happen, and it's an awful idea).\nE.g. memcached, mailhog, etc will all be directly accessible with default user/pass, and the default database credentials will be documented etc. Nor have any of the nginx of php configs gone through security hardening.\nI know taking a local environment and exposing it to the web can make it easy to share mockups, but if you're following a modern version control based development flow, a staging or pre-production site setup on a proper host is always better.. As for solutions, perhaps add a vagrant provisioner that runs super early and adds the appropriate vagrant user?. Downloading ubuntu again sounds very unusual, it'll try and update any packages but it shouldn't take 30 minutes, unless your internet is very slow, or you have a mechanical spinning hard drive\nWithout seeing a full log of the provision though I'm not sure I can help much further. It could be that you've a slow machine, or that you've got a WP Core development site in there ( setting up those takes longer as it's not just installing WP but building it and its dependencies ), or that the meta environment was uncommented ( the meta environment is quite large, it's included in the config file for contributor days but commented out as most people would never need it )\nThere's some important information missing if we're to figure out what happened:\n - Can you send over a gist with a full copy of the output of when you ran vagrant reload --provision?\n - Which OS are you on?\n - Which provider did it use? HyperV? VirtualBox?\n - Where you using the master or develop branch? Which version of VVV did you use?. ok it looks like:\n\nbetween when you set up VVV and when you reprovisioned, PHP7.2 and git/gitLFS got updated\nyou have the WP Core trunk site template setup and it provisioned ( which is the bulk of the log )\n\nMy recommendation is to comment out the trunk.wordpress.test site, so change this:\nyaml\n wordpress-trunk:\n    description: \"An svn based WP Core trunk dev setup, useful for contributor days, Trac tickets, patches\"\n    repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template-develop.git\n    hosts:\n     - trunk.wordpress.test\nto:\n```yaml\nwordpress-trunk:\ndescription: \"An svn based WP Core trunk dev setup, useful for contributor days, Trac tickets, patches\"\nrepo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template-develop.git\nhosts:\n- trunk.wordpress.test\n```\nReprovisioning should then do a lot less work. Alternatively, you can just add skip_provisioning:true for that site:\nyaml\n wordpress-trunk:\n    skip_provisioning: true\n    description: \"An svn based WP Core trunk dev setup, useful for contributor days, Trac tickets, patches\"\n    repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template-develop.git\n    hosts:\n     - trunk.wordpress.test\nAnd it'll be aware of the site, but won't try to set it up. I think going forwards, having that set to true by default would be best. > So how to stop checking/updating unnecessary things on creating new site?\nThe problem is it doesn't know if it's necessary/unnecessary until it's checked, I assume you're referring to the apt-get package checks? How fast is your internet connection? I can do multiple reprovisions in the space of 13 minutes. Releated to #1746 . Everything under the www folder is mapped on to /srv/www and the VVV folder itself is mapped on to /vagrant/. The Varying Vagrant Vagrants in the title is redundant.

It might be better to link to GitHub profiles, with personal sites being a second link, e.g.\n\nJeremy Felt - https://jeremyfelt.com. do we have a generic WP install that can replace it?

Adding an existing site could replace the main index file of adding a new site. This suggests a folder named sites, I'd prefer instead we used the root folder or removed it. Not all sites have a public_html folder, just those created via the VVV custom site template and the defaults.\n\nHow about \n\nyou will be able to manually copy the site files into the folder, or the public_html subdirectory created when the site is provisioned if one exists. These are required rather than recommended, we shouldn't imply they're optional. eh it should be changed there, I had to clean up a lot of these kinds of things from VVV1, I'm not surprised a handful got through. As long as it matches the architecture of the VM OS it should be fine, but I'm unaware of any non-amd64 scenarios, and it would require VVV running on a non-intel/AMD processor. My understanding is that this is included by all site nginx configs. I don't think that this is needed as a site template can already do this via vvv-nginx.conf. This cleans up after a previous provision so that if you remove a utility, it gets removed and doesn't persist when it's not wanted. oh bugger I see what you mean. Fixed in the release PR to develop #1713. we should check if this folder exists, then fall back to wordpress-develop if that exists, the same with WP_CORE_DIR. I think it should, but lets put that in another PR. As for the dashboard repo, I think that's fine to keep as is, it's mostly adding a description for much older VVV users that didn't use description tags. Thanks :). \n",

    "dezinerdudes": "Thank you both for your suggestions! I am so grateful for the help. So, I tried disabling my firewall and antivirus and same problem. I made sure Hyper-V was turned off, changed all the settings in my Bios to default but still no change. Eventually I tried the versions you suggested: trusty 32 and precise 32. Precise32 worked immediately. It also displays the GUI in VB whereas the others don't. Thanks very much! Maybe I'll be able to help you guys at 10up some day!\n. Oh and @lkwdwrd do you think there's is any difference in features or performance running trusty32 vs trusty64 with vvv? Would some features not work if I used trusty32 or precise32?\n. Thank you for the replies, I first tried with the versions of both vvv and VB that were suggested on the vvv page and the current versions of them. So current I am still using the latest of both: VB 4.3.12 and VVV 1.6.3. So now I have managed to get trusty32 working so i guess thats ok. \nBy the way, yesterday I Iooked again in my vbox log file, and there was some warning that my CPU doesnt support hardware virtualisation. Could that have something to do with the problem?\n. I see there are still some users who are experiencing this issue. So, I will attempt to summarise a list below of some possible solutions to the SSH timeout problem:\n- Make sure your firewall or antivirus is not blocking the program (which I doubt will happen often)\n- Give your vagrant machine some time for timeouts to happen. If you dont have a very fast PC / Mac, the VM will take while to boot into an SSH ready state, so timeouts will happen.\n- Therefore, first try to let vagrant timeout COMPLETELY before concluding that there is a fault.\n- If vagrant times out completely then increase the timeout limit in the vagrant file to a few min and try again.\n- If that still doesnt work, then try to clean boot your vagrant machine through the VirtualBox interface and enable the GUI of the machine beforehand. If the GUI doesn't show anything happening (ie. just blackscreen, no text) while it is booting, then your vagrant machine has got problems.\n- Destroy the entire machine through the VB interface and reinstall.\n- Delete the ubuntu image files in the Vagrant Images folder in the user folder and redownload and install.\n- Do you even have an intel processor that supports 64bit hardware virtualisation? Google it. If you do, make sure there is no setting in your Bios disabling this feature.\n- Disable hyper-v feature if you are running windows 7 or 8. Google how to disable.\n- Make sure you are running through an SSH enabled client. Use Git bash. Download: http://git-scm.com/downloads\n- Install a 32bit version of ubuntu like trusty32 or precise32. Just change the version in the vagrant file and reinstall vagrant in new directory.\n- Make sure you are using the latest vagrant and virtualbox versions.\n- Last resorts: Format your computer, reinstall windows and buy an intel core isomething processor.\nHope that helps.\n.

It looks like I found a solution to this, which involved using NFS shares also for the directories specified in the main Vagrantfile. In other words I had to replace stuff like\nsh\nconfig.vm.synced_folder \"www/\", \"/srv/www/\", :owner => \"www-data\", :mount_options => [ \"dmode=775\", \"fmode=774\" ]\nwith\nsh\nconfig.vm.synced_folder \"www/\", \"/srv/www/\", :nfs => true\nWould be nice if all this was mentioned in the docs.. hey @tomjn thanks for getting back\n\nModifying the custom site template to allow you to specify which plugins via vvv-custom.yml sounds like the appropriate path here. Eitherway it sounds like you're trying to optimise for disk space.\n\nI'm not sure if we're on the same page. I don't want to optimise for disk space. It's all about workflow. Each of my plugins/themes has its own git repository. Each repository folder is also a project in my IDE. When I do edits in my IDE, they're picked up in git and vice versa. Sometimes I need to switch branches. Sometimes I need to test cross-plugin compatibility and need to work on different branches of each plugin, simultaneously. If each of these git repos is synced with the VM, this is great: in this way I can do edits in my IDE and, without moving a single file, I can test them in the browser and if it's good, I can commit them directly, again without moving files or opening others. It's a lot cleaner, simpler, better organized, automatic. This is how I use VVV. It saves me a lot of time and sanity.\nSo, speaking of shared folders, I see it in this way. VVV is a Vagrant project and Vagrant features include shared folders. \nIt'd be a shame if no approach to share individual folders within individual sites is taken under consideration by the maintainers. Or better, that there seems to be merely a passive approach to what comes out of the box with Vagrant (no pun intended :)). I quite believe the setup I described is not rare within the VVV community. Especially considering, as you said, that many people since V1 thought this was supported. I believe they might be using shared folders in a similar manner as I do. It would make a lot of sense in plugin and theme development. \nIn my case NFS required some extra work and to modify the main Vagrantfile, which I agree is not something you could or should support. Although I'd like to point out now that you could create a variable in the Vagrantfile that in turn reads an environment variable or a simple property in the yml file, and call it like use_nfs. Then, if use_nfs is true, replace certain vagrant configuration lines as mentioned in https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/1397#issuecomment-354707309 or keep the existing ones if false. This would allow users to switch over NFS without having to edit the Vagrantfile.\nFinally, as you said, you could also write a documentation page on how to add more synced folders (with or without NFS - in my case the standard filesharing never worked well even in V1, but it may be just my problem).\nIf you think these two things are acceptable in VVV I can help with both the Vagrantfile changes and the doc page.\nCheers and Happy New Year!.

Hi Phil,\nBy moving your VVV configuration scripts in a subfolder / site [ex: /Site/vvv-import/], you should be able to disable a site by removing its configuration folder. Keep these configs in a private repo, so that you don't have to worry about deleting them. I have a very basic repo of such a config folder as example.  \nI would however recommend to keep sites/projects per directory. With https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/659 you can now more easily comment out from L 773 to 813, some VVV features you don't intend to use and this way speed up provisioning processes of a new Vagrant instance.\nHope this info can be of help ~\n-Cris.\n.

So i went to my machine to check the state of my network adapter, it was fun to realize that it was disconnected :)  It came with last Virtualbox update. Im most certainly sure that my solution will solve problem for most of you. It's bad habit of us not to check vbox settings. \n.

Change this to /srv/www/whateveryourlocalvvvdomainis\n5. Restart nginx with sudo service nginx restart\n6. Drop out of SSH and vagrant share\n7. Now you can share that url with colleagues, mobile devices etc.\nYou'll probably need to use this: https://wordpress.org/plugins/root-relative-urls/ and also hope your theme has been built properly!\nThis isn't great, however it's the best I've got so far.

    "ljgww": "After a lot of experimentation and observation I came to conclusion that this is not SSH issue rather it is network configuration issue on a box and the way how vagrant treat it.\nVagrant is trying to be smart by injecting network adapter configuration during up script execution while not really giving an option to a user to configure vbox network in some alternative (maybe more appropriate configuration). To much 'intelligence' and treating user to be 'stupid' is not always good idea ;)\nI have a pc that has no virtualization setup, this does not stop vagrant from working but once in many reloads (say in 1 of 10 attempts everything gets properly setup and ssh works without problems). Of course this happens after many retries (timeouts on box OS).\nIn essence box ETH0 almost never gets properly configured during box booting. I have increased timeouts beyond realistic limits to counter numerous attempts of the box to get its network properly configured. Box's eth0 looks like failing on DHCP finally ending up with IPv6 address instead of IPv4 address. Of course from vagrant script side it looks that vbox is not yet connected (there are no routes) so vagrant script tries to try and retries to try until eventually after some additional time-outs eth0 on the box gets configured properly (god knows which DHCP is hit to help)\nI have experimented by forcing vbox to use various eth0 setups (including forcing to be static one within the same network as host) but that gets nullified by vagrant script injection configuration that insists on NAT setup and UUID network identifier (which seems to be luckily generated once one vagrant setup is made) and undoing any alternative network configuration.\nI run Ubuntu 14.04 32 vbox on 14.04 64bit host (with no virtualization). Its working SOMETIMES (when I get lucky)\nNot to mention that I run currently latest version of Oracle VBox and latest version of Vagrant, just for someone who would surely wander is that is up to date ... there are no firewalls or other fancy disruptors in between.\n.

    "rtpHarry": "@iparr thanks for that tip! Couple of notes from a vagrant-newbie Windows-based user:\n1. If you used the vvv-site-wizard script to add your extra domains the path will likely have htdocs on the end so: /srv/www/whateveryourlocalvvvdomainis/htdocs\n2. After you have finished editing in nano you press CTRL-O (letter) then press enter to save and then CTRL-X to exit nano.\n. I thought somebody might say something along these lines and I was hesitant to suggest it.\nHowever, it would only take an extra if statement to skip over installing WP. The alternatives all seemed like a lot more work. For me, yes VVV is for WP but its also my primary local dev server. If I have the occasional different requirement I'm not wanting to go out, find and configure an entire ecosystem when 99% of the problem is already solved by VVV. I have scripts in place which backup the exported databases for example, and automatically run vagrant update to keep the underlying box up to date.\nIn fact I would potentially use a \"none\" solution even for WordPress development. I use the Duplicator plugin to move live sites around and when I make a new site in VVV I just want the server+db so I can run the duplicator installer and deploy the site into it.. arghhh big migration job now that has to be done quickly via firefox before that locks me out of my dev sites as well.... im grumpy because the only clean way i know to change the url is to use my duplicator plugin. Why was it so important that they had to break things without taking the time to give us a migration path. \nThe real question here is can we augment these sites with some kind of ssl certificate and meet Chrome's new requirement? Does anyone wiser have an answer? I'm using these tools because I don't have time to be an expert in every area. I like learning but right now I have a deadline before xmas and a new big job to be done for no real reason.. Yeahhh boiiii!\nIt got me back in the game, thank you.\nI am still getting an error but I can click accept now and still access the site:\n\n. ",

    "legal90": "@TobiasBg Thanks for implementing Parallels Desktop support here! Let me clarify some points:\n\nIn my tests, parallels was the default, if the parameter was not specified. (I'm not sure why that is the case though, as the VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER environment variable is empty on my system.)  \n\nSince vagrant-parallels v1.3.0 the Parallels provider has higher priority than VirtualBox. If this plugin is installed, Vagrant will try to use the Parallels provider by default. So that, it is not necessary to specify --provider=parallels or set VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER env variable anymore.\n\nAlso, we don't need the \"share\" mount option in the synced folder config for the Parallels Provider (see TobiasBg@394f007). With that, the file owner is not set to www-data (which is what we want though), but to vagrant.\n\nNo, it is not. \"share\" mount option means that each user in the guest machine will see these shared folders and files as his own. If you request file uid/gid attributes being logged as 'vagrant' user, than you will see that they are vagrant:vagrant. But if you try to do the same from 'root' account, than you will see root:root and so on. Example:\n```\nvagrant@vvv:~$ ls -la /var/lib/mysql/ | grep readme\n-rw-r--r--  1 vagrant vagrant      413 Oct 28  2014 readme.txt\nvagrant@vvv:~$ sudo ls -la /var/lib/mysql/ | grep readme\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root      413 Oct 28  2014 readme.txt\nroot@vvv:~# sudo -u www-data ls -la /var/lib/mysql/ | grep readme\n-rw-r--r--  1 www-data www-data      413 Oct 28  2014 readme.txt\n```\nSee man mount.prl_fs (in Linux VM) to read more about available mount options for Parallels Shared Folders. This man page is available with Parallels Tools >= 10.1.0 (included to our Vagrant box parallels/ubuntu-14.04 v1.0.1).\n. @TobiasBg\nUPDATE: In Parallels Desktop 10.1.2 it became possible to chown files from shared folders. \nNow there is no error like \"Operation not permitted\" anymore :smiley:\nYou can update PD by clicking on the top menu \"Parallels Desktop -> Check for Updates...\", either download and install the latest build by this link: http://www.parallels.com/directdownload/pd10/\n.

    "JPry": "\nexposing VVV to the internet rather than just a private network \n\nThe Xip.io service is designed to only expose the site to the local network. The DNS lookup does traverse the internet, but it resolves on the local network.. @tomjn Sorry for any confusion, I completely agree. I was just pointing out that utilizing Xip.io is different than opening up VVV to the internet directly.. @salcode Is this still an issue for you with a new VVV implementation? I'm asking because I'm doing something slightly different with the public network, and I had this working for me today. I commented out this default line:\nconfig.vm.network :private_network, ip: \"192.168.50.4\"\nand uncommented this line:\nconfig.vm.network :public_network\nThis is different from the port forwarding you mentioned, but I'm curious if the port forwarding is still broken for you.\n. @salcode \n\nShould I be trying to visit a different IP address for the URL?\n\nYes. The virtual machine should have its own IP address assigned by your router. So it will not be the address for your host machine, and it will not be the normal 192.168.50.4 that is created. When I set up my vagrant with public networking, I had an address in the 192.168.1.x block.\nRunning ifconfig on the vagrant should reveal all interfaces, and since your local machine has an IP of 10.0.1.6, I would expect the vagrant to also be in the 10.0.1.x range.\n. @salcode It's worth noting that I ended up using the Customfile to set up public networking instead of modifying the Vagrantfile. So in the end, I had multiple networking devices on the guest machine:\n```\nvagrant@vvv:~$ ifconfig\neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 08:00:27:cf:da:f3\n          inet addr:10.0.2.15  Bcast:10.0.2.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          inet6 addr: fe80::a00:27ff:fecf:daf3/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:120157 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:41949 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:133209210 (133.2 MB)  TX bytes:3180167 (3.1 MB)\neth1      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 08:00:27:4a:23:7b\n          inet addr:192.168.1.30  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          inet6 addr: fe80::a00:27ff:fe4a:237b/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:325 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:13 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:33102 (33.1 KB)  TX bytes:1522 (1.5 KB)\neth2      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 08:00:27:17:c8:06\n          inet addr:192.168.50.4  Bcast:192.168.50.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          inet6 addr: fe80::a00:27ff:fe17:c806/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:26 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:8 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:4922 (4.9 KB)  TX bytes:648 (648.0 B)\nlo        Link encap:Local Loopback\n          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\n          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:65536  Metric:1\n          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n          RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)\n```\nIn this particular example, 192.168.1.30 is the public IP (for my local network).\n. @salcode \n\nNow I need to decide if I'm going to move away from my port forwarding solution in favor of this public IP solution. Am I correct you prefer this public IP solution?\n\nPersonally I think the public IP is a bit cleaner, but of course it also has drawbacks:\n- (I think) you need to vagrant reload --provision if you change Wifi access points.\n- New IP if you change Wifi access points (after vagrant reload)\n- If you're on public Wifi (vs. being at your own home/office), then anyone else can get to your vagrant too.\nI would say as long as I'm working at home on my own network, I like the public IP route. But if any of the above apply to your work situation, it might be easier for you to go with the port forwarding option (if it's working correctly), so that you only ever need to know your local IP.\nSo... TL;DR is \"It depends\" \ud83d\ude09\n. My Customfile:\nruby\n  # Set up with a Public network\n  config.vm.network :public_network\nI've also found that you can do this with a Vagrantfile in ~/.vagrant.d/. The benefit to that method is the same as the drawback: it applies to all of your vagrant instances, and not just a single one. In any case, here's the ~/.vagrant.d/Vagrantfile I use:\n``` ruby\n-- mode: ruby --\nvi: set ft=ruby :\nVagrant.configure(2) do |config|\n  # Set up with a Public network\n  config.vm.network :public_network\nend\n```\n.

This allows other developers involved in the project to check out the code, run vagrant up, and be on their way. Vagrantfiles are portable across every platform Vagrant supports.\n\nThat's the point of using Vagrant. If you have multiple developers working on a project they should be able to clone and be on their way. So the original question is, how can we accomplish this? Let's say we can point to a repo in our config which contains the content of the wp-content directory (I'm looking at you vv https://github.com/bradp/vv) how can we get to a point where we can create a repo which when checked out we only have to \"run vagrant up\". \nIn this use-case the wp-content repo is still separate from the vvv configuration but a new developer can still get started on any machine quickly with a consistent Vagrant environment (which Vagrant was ment  for). \nYou know, together but apart, so poetic...\n. > This is already the case, they add a site to vvv-custom.yml that references a git repo, and VVV clones it into the appropriate place and runs the provisioners.\nThat was pretty much the answer I was looking for, thanks :-) \nI'm not trying to do anything exotic, I just have the one Wordpress project that we're migrating away from and I needed a way to be able to edit without being bothered setting up lamp stacks or any such thing.

If anyone continuing to experience this issue could share with me their Vagrantfile and a screen grab of the output during vagrant up, I'll be happy to help troubleshoot.\n. The \"could not be found\" error is because your version of Vagrant is too old. You need at least 1.7 to support a named provisioner.

For me, it eliminates the error entirely as long as it's the first provisioner that runs. I am obsessed with getting zero red text.\n. Rather than cluttering up this PR with our discussion, I'd be happy to follow up with you via email if you want some help. I think the issue is that your VM was already provisioned and you just a vagrant reload. Run vagrant provision and you should see something like this in the output:\n==> default: Running provisioner: fix-no-tty (shell)...\n    default: Running: inline script\nOnce you see that, nevermore should you see the \"not a tty\" message. Depending on what your other provisioning scripts do, you might get a similar message from dpkg-reconfigure. The fix for that (and just a best practice in general) is to provide the answers up front using dpkg-preconfigure or debconf-set-selections.\n. Yes, feel free.

    "ntwb": "\ndoes a workflow where grunt build fires every time vagrant provision is fired make sense?\nI think so, in particular for the /build folder where RTL and minified assets are the primary differences.\n\nA couple of use cases:\n- If you've haven't used 'VVV' for a while you should to run vagrant provision to get any provision updates, this would act as a helper, for sure in no way does it replace grunt build though.\n- If provisioning fails during provision of wordpress-develop subsequent re-provisions would never run grunt build as the the /build folder already existed.\n. Thanks @TobiasBg, this raises a couple of things that I'm probably not the person with an answer to and that is \"How often do users run vagrant provision?\", running grunt build should only add ~60 seconds to the provision time.\nYou also raise the point that wordpress-trunk is the same as wordpress-develop's /build state, why does wordpress-trunk even exist then in VVV?\nHow about we totally remove the wordpress-trunk SVN checkout which would save a considerable amount of time, use grunt build along with a symlinked /build folder for wordpress-trunk?\nTo perform the above brings me to where I was going to create another issue, I'm working on the WordPress-Meta-Environment in adding more sites and networks, at the moment provisioning each of these sites is done either with an SVN checkout or WP-CLI, I'd like to change these to use the existing wordpress-default and wordpress-trunk checkouts by symlinking them, the main obstacle right at this moment stopping me from symlinking them is wp-config.php in each case is in the 'root' folder of the respective sites, I'd like to be able to get these out of this folder and move it up a level, Giving WordPress its own Directory should work for this, and could also look to support the wp-content directory outside of the WordPress directory, ala #182, a bit of thought into not breaking backwards compatibility will be needed of course.\n.

One thing to be aware of, is with NVM it doesn't support multiple versions of NPM\nSo if you want to use the LTS (Long Term Support) v2.x branch of NPM you'll need to install it via npm install -g npm@2 or likewise, if you want to use the \"stable\" 3.x branch then npm install -g npm@3\nI suggest VVV should standardise on the LTS v2.x branch of NPM, if people want to switch to v3 thats straight forward per above.\n. > NVM - My only question was whether it would be worth downloading a zipped package from the GitHub repository rather than cloning the repo and then watching tags. It's a small commit history, so the clone won't take long either way, so it may be fine as is.\nI thought about this then looked at the other packages included via git clone and thought it would make sense to also to be a git clone'd repo though I've no real strong opinion for either method though.\n\nNPM - If I run npm --version inside my VVV instance right now, it's showing 3.8.6. Is that correct or should we force it back to LTS 2? What is the harm in NPM 3.x.x by default?\n\nYes, that is correct. Currently the latest NPM is installed via npm install -g npm via provision.sh#L234, no final decision has yet to be made on using NPM v2.x or 3.x for core, see #35105, though if it was decided to use the 2.x branch then tweaking that provision command to npm install -g npm@2. \nNot sure how we'd handle peoples personal choice of using NPM v2.x or 3.x, but this can be addressed later in another issue/pull request and shouldn't be a blocker to getting the NodeJS updates in.\n\nNodeJS - We can use #779 to update the default system version of Node to the 4.x LTS release per this comment, though I would not personally be opposed to running the latest stable.\n\nI'm using NodeJS 5.x (and NPM 3.x) here locally, what I was aiming for with that comment and decision was to have the broadest compatibility with #core by default because who knows \u00af(\u30c4)/\u00af\nMaybe the argument should go the other way, use the latest stables (NodeJS 5.x, PHP 7.0) and ultilise NVM to switch back to 4.x if needed, and PHPBrew back to 5.x \u00af(\u30c4)/\u00af\n. @jeremyfelt Watch out for NVM aliases, aka nvm install stable, the stable alias is deprecated, in particular I'd avoid using that in any scripts to prevent unforeseen explosions \ud83d\udca5 \nAnd thanks everyone for getting this done \ud83c\udf89 \n.

GruntJS 1.0.0 was released today http://gruntjs.com/blog/2016-04-04-grunt-1.0.0-released\nGrunt-cli is also now 1.x, currently 1.2.0 https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli\nOn a fresh VVV setup and an initial vagrant up and subsequent vagrant up --provision I've currently got:\nsh\nvagrant@vvv:/srv/www/wordpress-develop$ grunt --version\ngrunt-cli v1.2.0\ngrunt v0.4.5\nThis all appears correct as Grunt 0.4.5 is what we currently install for WordPress (src)\n.

Based on these docs, it seems that .localhost is the most likely candidate to replace .dev, based on how VVV uses domains and how its use is defined.\n. I've been using some other local dev environments that still use a local hosts file with custom TLDs instead of zeroconf. In that vein, if VVV moves to a zeroconf system, then it makes sense now to implement it with .local, else use .localhost since it conveys better what VVV is used for.. The problem I come across often is running Grunt locally often fails because of conflicting versions of node modules. For instance, when I provision, the packages for \"wordpress-develop\" installed match the version of the host (Ubuntu, running Node v0.10.37 in this case). When I try to run Grunt from my host (OS X, running a different version of Node), it throws an error about \"libsass bindings not found\" because the node-sass package installs scripts that match the host (which was Ubuntu, not OS X). The only solution for this is to remove the node_modules directory, and run npm install from OS X.\nThis works great, right up to the point I want to run unit tests. They fail to run because the database is set to run inside the VM, not on my host. The only way to run them is inside a Vagrant shell.\nOne trick I use, is the vagrant ssh -c command, which lets me run a command from inside vagrant without having to completely shell into it, so running the default grunt task is a single command:\nbash\nvagrant ssh -c \"cd /srv/www/wordpress-develop/ && grunt\"\nThis saves me from managing node dependencies, and always ensures I'm using the modules that are installed during a provision.\n. I haven't had much luck getting it to work as part of the provisioning script for upgrade/change, but can get it to work for fresh installs. I don't think we should require folks to destroy just to swap sources, so I'm still looking for better solutions.\nSo far, I've tried two approaches: 1) dropping in the script directly from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nodesource/distributions/master/deb/setup_4.x into provision.sh and letting it do the work, and 2) adding the PPA to the custom sources, adding the keys to provision.sh, and letting the normal provision process use the new deb.nodesource.com release.\n. @ericandrewlewis I believe you can add it to the provision process using provision-post.sh to install your desired version, or through apt-get in the shell once it's provisioned. Either one would require Ubuntu to have an updated version in their repo, or a custom PPA set up to pull from.\nFrom https://askubuntu.com/questions/109404/how-do-i-install-latest-php-in-supported-ubuntu-versions-like-5-4-x-in-ubuntu-1:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php5-5.6\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install php5\n. @ericandrewlewis I believe you can add it to the provision process using provision-post.sh to install your desired version, or through apt-get in the shell once it's provisioned.

Hopefully it was just a fluke, but I hate relying on \"hopefully\" and \"fluke\" in the same instance.\n. @cfoellmann Can you clarify what you mean by supporting both? We can't have both of them operating at the same time since they would just fight over the hosts file.\nI suppose we could have an if\u2026else block that checks for both plugins, but which one would take precedence? We'd have to stop processing with the first one we list that's installed, and if someone has them both installed we'd be making the decision for them to use the one we list first.\n. Makes sense to not make a breaking change when it's not necessary.\nI extracted the code to grab the hosts into its own function to maximize reuse, then use it in the conditional to pass the array to each plugin.\n. Unless we're going to internally leverage any of the features that we get with MariaDB 10, I vote for MariaDB/MySQL 5.6 for parity with hosts. We can always use a custom provision script to change DB engines if needed for special cases.\n. ",

Docker support will be especially useful on Windows due to the evilness that is the hyper-v provider requiring vagrant to be run as Administrator.\nI need hyper-v for other tasks so I cannot use the VirtualBox provider. Native Docker backs-onto hyper-v but providers sugar for file-system sharing and the like, and does NOT require Administrator privileges!\n. update from my side is that VVV is completely unusable on Windows for me now that the Hyper-V box is gone. My only choices now are remove Hyper-V and sacrifice OS-provided virtual machine support and development of Windows devices apps and android apps which require HyperV for emulating the devices (using the Visual studio Android Emulator rather than the slow as molasses android qemu-based emulator, which would also still conflict with VVV when using VirtualBox), and sacrificing native Docker which also uses Hyper-V to back onto.. thanks for the pointer. however as the second step is \"install virtualbox\" then I'm assuming it requires boot2docker and therefore won't work with Native Docker (which is required in my setup because I have hyper-v installed for other things.). I've tweaked the Dockerfile in 897c116.\nAlso fixed the README.md (correcting the typo of Customfile) in 23a8905.\nI can successfully provision under Linux-native Docker now, but there seem to be problems with macOS+boot2docker support (the older method).

As an aside, it looks like the canonical place to do this should be to change www/vvv-hosts and everything should ripple out from there, but unfortunately that's not the only place that will need changing (the nginx config still expects to serve to hosts named *.dev, and the page of resources still lists .dev hosts). I haven't tracked them all down, because I ran into fun with my /etc/hosts file first.\nNo matter what cargo cult modifications I made to /etc/hosts (which is really /private/etc/hosts) or number of times I tried to flush the DNS cache, I couldn't get a browser on my system to reliably find any of the VVV hostnames with a .localhost suffix. I tried then switching to .vvv, thinking maybe .localhost (since it is a legit host name) could be causing problems. Finally, in one last ditch effort to get it working, and spurred on by various reports of OSX not like certain formats of hosts file, I tried removing the huge comments on each line put there by the hostmanager plugin. This seemed to work briefly. Then I found I could reliably, but temporarily get things working again if I simply added a newline at the end of the last host entry added by hostmanager. \nHere's my current thinking, with the caveat that this is based on guesswork/testing, but no real knowledge of how things are really working. This is really looking like some sort of DNS round-robinish problem with the /etc/hosts file being one of sources of info. I get the feeling that each time I touch /etc/hosts, the info in it gets added to some cache that also contains the DNS lookup results for the same hosts. So sometimes you get the /etc/hosts .dev info (192.168.50.4), sometimes you get the DNS version (127.0.53.53). And the cache of the hosts file info times out too without being refreshed automatically, so at some point if it isn't changed, we lose the entries in it (which is why .localhost or .vvv doesn't work over time as well). For all I know, this could be part of an in-brower cache.\nHere's another data point: out of frustration, I went back and tried DesktopServer which is an XAMP-based WP dev environment that also uses the /etc/hosts file to create .dev hosts. The hosts it creates use 127.0.0.1 and in the time I spent with it last evening, those always worked. I don't know if localhost is therefore special cased, or whether having the same suffix in /etc/hosts and DNS was the differentiating factor.\nSo where does this leave this bug? It seems pretty likely to me that using .dev (w/o a 127.0.0.1) is likely to be fraught with peril. I can go back and try and root out all of the .dev mentions and instead slot in something like .vvv or .test to see if it can work in a stable fashion if you'd like. It's also possible that another vagrant plugin (vagrant-ghost has been mentioned) could produce better formed hosts lines.\nI'm just concerned that /etc/hosts based names may not play as nice as they used to in the past.

    "ottok": "I've used .local (with the Zeroconf benefits) on our company standardized Vagrant box for WordPress development for some time and it works great. I really hope VVV would use .local out-of-the-box.\n. Any comments from VVV developers? Will you merge the PR if I implement this?\n. @LoreleiAurora I already have a PR open in #1005, installing MariaDB 5.5 from official Ubuntu 14.04 repos.\nDo we intend to upgrade to 16.04 soon? In official Ubuntu 16.04 repos MariaDB 10.0 would be available. If not, I can make a PR that installs a backported Ubuntu 16.04 MariaDB 10.0 to the Ubuntu 14.04 based Vagrant image.. Ubuntu 14.04 also has MariaDB available.\n. Please avoid using PPAs. Stick to the packages in official Ubuntu repositories for best quality, security are reliability.\n. Why do you assume those currently on MySQL 5.5 would upgrade to MySQL 5.7? MariaDB is the only option available in RedHat/CentOS and SUSE variants, and starting from the next Debian release it will be the default in the Debian ecosystem too. It is expected that most of those 5.5 users upgrade to MariaDB 10.0.\nAlso note that the page https://wordpress.org/about/stats/ lists only version numbers, not vendor. We don't how many of those 5.5 users are on MySQL5.5 and how many are on MariaDB 5.5.\nUsing the Sandbox seems like over-engineering. Just apt-get install mariadb-server or mysql-server and use the tested and secure packages that the distribution provide.\n. Why not just go for MariaDB 10.0 directly, as MariaDB seems to be the most voted option here and MariaDB 10.0 is available in Ubuntu repos, and fullfills all WordPress requirements perfectly.\n. Please switch from MySQL to MariaDB\nMotivation:\n- Many are upgrading from Oracle MySQL to truly open source MariaDB by original creators of MySQL. Oracle only publishes code dumps at release time, and is not viewed as a true open source project, while MariaDB is developed fully in the open.\n- Most of the Linux ecosystem has already switched to MariaDB. For example Fedora/RedHat and SUSE ship by default only MariaDB since a few years back. MariaDB has been available in Ubuntu since 14.04 and in Debian since version 8. Debian is going to have MariaDB as default in next release and Ubuntu is likely to follow.\n- Projects like XAMPP already has MariaDB as default.\n- Automattic, the company behind WordPress, is a sponsor of the MariaDB Foundation and all new WordPress.com deployments use MariaDB.\n- Also many other prominent sites have switched to MariaDB, like Wikipedia.org and Google. More details at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MariaDB\n- Techincal benefits listed at https://seravo.fi/2015/10-reasons-to-migrate-to-mariadb-if-still-using-mysql\nThis change is the first one in a series of changes to implement MariaDB in VVV. I am committed to take care of the following steps too.\nI have tested that the current patch works as expected in all relevant scenarios:\n- New installs (vagrant up on a pristine machine)\n- Existing installs that update VVV (vagrant up will work, DB stays provided by mysql-server package)\n- Existing installs that download a new image but has older VVV version (vagrant up will work, DB stays provided by mariadb-server)\n. I am happy to continue working on this if you can give me some assurance that my work is not in vain and this first step is merged. \nNext steps could be improving the default config to be WordPress-friendlier, e.g. have UTF8MB4 as the default character set so that emoticons :hamburger: are correctly saved in the database etc. Lot's of people want to use emoticons in WordPress comments! :)\nMariaDB in Debian and Ubuntu is by default wiht UTF8MB4 so this would all be nicely aligned with future production environments.\n. Ping @jeremyfelt - I am happy to rebase and refine, I just want to have some thumbs up that the PR will be processed and my work is not in vain..\nGreetings from WordCamp Stockholm Contributor Day! :). I rebased on latest develop and extended with UTF-8 support. Please review and merge @jeremyfelt @LoreleiAurora \nThanks!. Yes please :). Thanks!

The issue was fixed here https://github.com/cogitatio/vagrant-hostsupdater/issues/89\nRun as administrator or give the current user rw permission on the hosts file.. @CdrMarks @LoreleiAurora  Have you been able to resolve this?  I am having the same issue. . The primary problem is the provisioning of the private key. Secondary issue is known_hosts. Both need to be added to the provision phase, before git is called to clone. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30075461/how-do-i-add-my-own-public-key-to-vagrant-vm. You need to do something similar to insert the private key to your box.. The normal solution is to use ssh agent forwarding.   This is enabled in the Vagrant file. However, there are/were issues with ssh agent forwarding on Windows. See https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/1735. This  is my suggested solution: 1)  provision the private key for the target repo  (Github in my case) during the Vagrant provision phase, to get the key from the host to the guest, and 2) add the Github known_hosts key value during the host provision via a custom provision_site.sh:\n\n\nProvision the ssh key for your repo:\nssh_key = ENV['USERPROFILE'] +  \"\\\\.ssh\\\\id_rsa\"\n  config.vm.provision \"file\", source: ssh_key, destination: \"/home/vagrant/.ssh/id_rsa\"\nNote this is Windows specific. It expects a key file in the users .ssh folder \n\n\nUpdate known hosts on the guest. I added this to my custom provision_site.sh script:\n\n\n```\nread -r -d '' ssh_known_host <<'EOF'\n|1|bo/v7A6iW0ByMbOBDowPnNW800Y=|9lK0/LfvJbW4x+ojzIJs5jR3K1k= ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEAq2A7hRGmdnm9tUDbO9IDSwBK6TbQa+PXYPCPy6rbTrTtw7PHkccKrpp0yVhp5HdEIcKr6pLlVDBfOLX9QUsyCOV0wzfjIJNlGEYsdlLJizHhbn2mUjvSAHQqZETYP81eFzLQNnPHt4EVVUh7VfDESU84KezmD5QlWpXLmvU31/yMf+Se8xhHTvKSCZIFImWwoG6mbUoWf9nzpIoaSjB+weqqUUmpaaasXVal72J+UX2B+2RPW3RcT0eOzQgqlJL3RKrTJvdsjE3JEAvGq3lGHSZXy28G3skua2SmVi/w4yCE6gbODqnTWlg7+wC604ydGXA8VJiS5ap43JXiUFFAaQ==\n|1|rxsDR39Vhe0mHO3kn1BGjZFAv0g=|n247Nv81AqpFtIeG/6d9IBYQt3w= ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEAq2A7hRGmdnm9tUDbO9IDSwBK6TbQa+PXYPCPy6rbTrTtw7PHkccKrpp0yVhp5HdEIcKr6pLlVDBfOLX9QUsyCOV0wzfjIJNlGEYsdlLJizHhbn2mUjvSAHQqZETYP81eFzLQNnPHt4EVVUh7VfDESU84KezmD5QlWpXLmvU31/yMf+Se8xhHTvKSCZIFImWwoG6mbUoWf9nzpIoaSjB+weqqUUmpaaasXVal72J+UX2B+2RPW3RcT0eOzQgqlJL3RKrTJvdsjE3JEAvGq3lGHSZXy28G3skua2SmVi/w4yCE6gbODqnTWlg7+wC604ydGXA8VJiS5ap43JXiUFFAaQ==\nEOF\necho $ssh_known_host > /home/vagrant/.ssh/known_hosts\necho $ssh_known_host > /root/.ssh/known_hosts\nchmod 600 /home/vagrant/.ssh/id_rsa\n```\nThere is a good discussion of how to securely manage known_hosts below.

Let us know if you have any questions. . This is already being tracked:\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-wordpress-default/pull/2\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/583\n. I had problems with authentication to the https version of the repo.  I finally went with the ssh protocol, where the repo is defined as repo: git@github.USER/PROJECT.git\nIn that mode, Github uses the local stored credentials and passes them along.\nAre you using Github?\n. I would login to the VM and do a git clone and confirm what happens.  The git clone command is run there Then try to form the command so that it authorizes you and the repo is cloned. If you can do this on the VM then you should be know what credential data is missing.  AS @grappler mentioned, I resolved a similar issue by insuring my credentials/keys are uploaded as part of the provision process.\nI made the following changes to the Vagrant file to resolve this:\n```\n# RJM 9/20/107 provision the ssh key for github go we can get access to the gm woocommerce repo\n  ssh_key = ENV['USERPROFILE'] +  \"\\.ssh\\github_woocommerce_rsa\"\n  config.vm.provision \"file\", source: ssh_key, destination: \"/home/vagrant/.ssh/id_rsa\"\n# RJM 9/24/17 insert custom public key for ssh access\n  ssh_pub_key = File.readlines(\"#{Dir.home}/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\").first.strip\n  config.vm.provision 'shell', inline: \"echo #{ssh_pub_key} >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys\"\n  config.vm.provision 'shell', inline: \"echo #{ssh_pub_key} >> /home/vagrant/.ssh/authorized_keys\", privileged: false\n```\nYou would need to do something similar for Beanstalk.  \nThe https protocol, by its nature, will require some clear text storage of credentials in order to access a private git repo.  SSH on the other hand, depends on public-key encryption, and is more secure. The trick is to provision the repo public key and the host key, at provision time.\nFor managing SSH repo access on Beanstalk see http://guides.beanstalkapp.com/version-control/git-on-linux.html. ",

This doesn't use the gulp integration, but can be done similarly with a gulpfile in the theme directory.\n. ``` javascript\ngulp.task( 'browserSync', function() {\n    browserSync({\n        logPrefix: 'local.wordpress.dev',\n        proxy: 'local.wordpress.dev',\n        reloadDelay: 3000,\n        open: false\n    });\n});\ngulp.task( 'watch', ['browserSync'], function() {\n    gulp.watch( '*/.php' ).on( 'change', browserSync.reload );\n    gulp.watch( 'style.css');\n});\n```\nYou might have to add another task to it if you use a preprocessor for css, either in the gulp.watch or in the task prerequisites.\nI got it to work with this, but it may have changed, haven't updated browserSync in a while\n. @fclaussen I'm running that gulpfile on the host machine, maybe that's the issue. If it's not I don't know what it could be.\n. ",

I think it may be interest to document my steps here because everytime I search this topic I end up in this page.\nThe following steps allow one to debug php in Atom:\n1. Run vagrant halt to shutdown the vagrant box.\n2. Edit your Vagrantfile, adding the following line: config.vm.network \"forwarded_port\", guest: 9000, host: 9999. The port number 9999 may be changed to any free port you want, just make sure there is no other process using it.\n3. Run vagrant up to start the vagrant box.\n4. Check if there is a listening process on the port you selected: netstat -tulpn | grep \":9999\".\n5. Now open Atom, make sure you have php-debug package installed and edit your config.cson:\n   \"php-debug\":\n     ServerPort: 9999\n     PathMaps: [{\n       remote: \"/srv/www/wordpress-default/\"\n       local: \"/Users/maruel/Google Drive/htdocs/vvv/www/wordpress-default/\"\n     }]\n6. Toggle Debugging in Atom so you can see the debug window.\n7. Add some breakpoint in your code.\n8.

You will see a bug icon in your browser, click to enable Xdebug session.\n10. Visit your page. \nAt this point the browser will hang waiting. You should be able to see the code execution paused in your breakpoint inside Atom and Debugging window will display all the context.\nInstead of using a browser extension to control the debug session start and stop, you can set your php.ini to always start a xdebug session.

Do you have to put the path for every site in www that you want to use xdebug for?\n. @groffTECH Glad you got it to work! Unfortunately I've never been able to.

None of my questions are answered. And honestly I am not down to trail and error code from here now again. I did this on the latest git clone a few days again, you tell me if it was 1.4.0 or not.\nSo I need the vvv-nginx.conf (or whatever) the vvv-init.sh (or whatever) put then into a folder and then add the folder name to the .yml? Do I need to define the provisioning folder there? What if I leave it empty? Seriously I feel very annoyed by the fact that I know really know what to do, what is does and that it not worked but not annoyed enough to dig into it and look how it actually works.\nSo again I ask if I really need to have to edit/create/modify 3 different files for a simple task to add a new site? If yes do you think this is reasonable? I think its horrible! I for now will work on the standard site, seems like a had bad luck picking the wrong time to start with this.\nAnother suggestion for the yaml would be this\nsites:\n  wordpress-default:\n    repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-wordpress-default.git\n    domain: local.wordpress.dev\n  another-wordpress-default-site:\n    repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-wordpress-default.git\n    domain: user.customised.domain\nWithout anything else. Or does this already work? If not I think the provision scripts should actually create the directories and databases based on the site name/folder rather then have this annoying requirement to create some file for a simple common task like creating the DB and downloading wp. I mean if its done based on maintained script for the default sites why require users then to copy paste stuff arround from a wiki for custom sites?\n@LoreleiAurora this does especially to you because you seem to work on this but rather then answer any of my question you just tagged this and went away.. @LoreleiAurora \n\nFor as long as VVV has supported custom sites it has required 3 files. (an example of these files can be found here)\n\nThis is still not clearly answering my question. I am not interested in the past, I am interested in how its done on your current dev versions. As far as I understand it the vvv-hosts is optional if I edit my hosts manually. But my question was of the new .yml file relates to this. It seems like its needed to edit this as well to make the other 2 or 3 files work. So a 3rd time:\nDo you need to edit/modify/copy 3 with a optional 4th file now? the .yml and the 2 (or 3) files in the sites folder? It seems this is the case now and instead of making it more easy you seem make it even more complicated.. So i have seen that the vvv-config.yml now has a config for hostnames. This was not the case when I initially opened this.\nI don't know the reasoning for different hosts for one site setup but I would prefer a simpler one site  one hostname config. Then the folders could also have the hostname and things would be simpler and easier to understand for noobs.\n\nNot every external repository will have the same structure. They may not even need a database at all. Putting the configuration at the site level allows for some nice flexibility, IMO. It may be possible in other iterations to automate a standard site setup a bit, but I do like the idea of starting with, becoming comfortable with, and documenting the basics first.\n\nI not really get what you are saying here. Its does not matter of the config files set a database or not. What I mean is that VVV just replaces strings during provisioning. And if its this easy there is not much need for documentation.\nIts already done with root {vvv_path_to_site}/public_html; in vvv-nginx.conf so why not just to the same with the database name in https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-wordpress-default/blob/master/provision/vvv-init.sh?\nJust just this file as template and replace wordpress_default with {database_name} or something like that and then let VVV replace the database strings during provisioning.\nIf I want to have another default site right now I could clone the wordpress-default repo and just replace that strings and add my own repo to the config, but it should be easier..

I disabled the Private Network by commenting line config.vm.network :private_network, ip: \"192.168.50.4\" in the vagrantfile\n2. And enabled the Port Forwarding by uncommenting the line config.vm.network \"forwarded_port\", guest: 80, host: 8080\n3.

Thanks for this tutorial, works great.\nJust a little addon for Windows users wantint to upgrade their VirtualBox along the way:\nYou may end up getting an error related to VirtualBox's network adapters during the first vagrant up after the VVV upgrade. I was able to resolve the issue by changing network adapter properties (on Windows network adapters settings screen) thanks to the VirtualBox forums reply.\n. @tomjn Thanks for the reply. I've actually went ahead and created a pull request fixing this issue. Please see https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/pull/1392. Very fast and dirty example:\nI would like to make my sites links HTTPS instead of HTTP, so, using my proposed solution, I can simply put this code into dashboard-custom.php file:\n```\n<?php\nob_start();\ninclude( 'dashboard-default.php' );\necho str_replace( 'http:', 'https:', ob_get_clean() );\n```\nThat way I know the future versions (new layouts) of default dashboard will not get completely overrode with my custom dashboard and I only change what I need.. Yes, moving sections into separate modules (files) would help too. Maybe we could control the modules display with .yml file then? And make it possible to use custom module override PHP files? Probably I'm asking for too much ;) Anyway, my solution works for me perfectly fine.\nBut I came up with this solution to make modifications both backwards and forwards compatible, as when I updated the VVV now, I've noticed that I miss a lot from current dashboard, when I was overriding it with my custom one only to make the links HTTPS...\nSo, this is just my proposition on improvement. Obviously, if you plan to do modules in the future, go ahead and close this issue.\nThanks for your time! \ud83d\udc4d . @tomjn Thank you for working on this!\nHowever, I'm a bit confused now. I understand there is no documentation on this update yet. But it seems to me that there is no way of overriding a single information of the dashboard, only the whole dashboard still.\nFrom what I understand, now you can override the entire dashboard with your own from external repo just by setting it up in vvv-custom.yml file. Am I correct here?\nIf so, how can I only override a specific single block of the dashboard, for example?\n\nMy hope in the future is to move the individual sections out into modules, so that those uninterested in certain boxes can disable them. With that you could put your own module in and disable the one it replaces.\n\nI can see this can not be set in vvv-custom.yml so I dug deeper ;)\nThe new dashboard seems to be provisioned/downloaded from https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/dashboard repo, where blocks are separated. However, I'm unable to find a functionality to override any single block/information there.\nAm I missing something?\nI can also see you have implemented my solution for dashboard too.\nBut I presume this will not make to next VVV release and will be removed in favor of above, right?\nSo, if you have time, could you please explain how can I override a single block of the dashboard and yet keep it future-proof, meaning whenever a new dashboard layout/design is implemented, I get that too with VVV update, but my block overrides will still apply (I understand I might also need to update my custom block code, which is obviously better than updating whole dashboard code to new version ;) )?\nSurely I understand if you don't explain the mechanism here and leave it for the release, no worries!. Ah, wou! Thank you for the explanation @tomjn! Now it's all clear to me.\nMy mistake was I haven't realized the https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/dashboard was a repo for dashboard subfolder.\nIn this case I can see it's perfectly implemented and I can actually do all of my dashboard modifications (and more if I wanted :) ) and stay future-compatible. Very cool!\nThank you!. I've resolved the issue at last. Here is how:\n\nI've downloaded a fresh copy of VVV 2.2.1, installed and run it to see if it also throws an error. It didn't, so I knew there is something wrong with my own VVV setup. (Just in case I've went ahead and copied the www/default folder over to my original VVV files, keeping my own dashboard-custom.php file there. This should not affect the issue, but I've noticed my VVV dashboard was a bit different from the new one, so I needed to update it.)\nI've checked my custom vvv-init.sh provision files for each site and noticed I don't create a database when it doesn't exist. So I've went ahead and added the database creation code to all of my custom vvv-init.sh files, then I've run vagrant up --provision and everything seems to be working perfectly fine again.\n\nSorry for creating this issue before checking my custom provision files!\nPS: Here is a database creation code I've used at the beginning of my custom vvv-init.sh files (just replace the {{Your DB name here}} with your database name):\n```\nMake a database, if we don't already have one\necho -e \"\\nCreating database '{{Your DB name here}}' (if it's not already there)\"\nmysql -u root --password=root -e \"CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS {{Your DB name here}}\"\nmysql -u root --password=root -e \"GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON {{Your DB name here}}.* TO wp@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'wp';\"\necho -e \"\\n DB operations done.\\n\\n\"\n```.

This solution is not viable. \nUnfortunately nothing said here fixes the problem I'm having. :(. @tomjn regarding your comment about using git to change the origin. I can't control this, because REPO is something that happens before provision files are downloaded. Our REPO is private that controls the provision, its not public. So not just anyone can download and use this VVV provisioner. How am I supposed to use VVV to with private github repos as in the REPO url?.

I was thinking that can be helpful to have in the dashboard a button to execute scripts like xdebug_on so can be a real dashboard with actions and not only links.. We need really this?\nActually for that part I am using the trigger plugin that on shutdown generate the dump of db and when I do a vagrant destroy this files are present.\nLater on vagrant up this dumps are reimported on the new VM without problems. \nThe only problems I see is with the WP develop site that seems not to be backupped.. You are right with a box update the db will be a problem but right now we do a box update too and with the dump of the db reimported at every boot this problem is easily fixed.\nSo the mysql files are not very useful but the sql dump are very a lot that can be synced or edited easily in case.. Yes the develop or new future version don't require anymore that plugin and is enough to uninstall as written in the error reported :-). Seems that the folders are not generated on the machine.\nAre you using the develop branch?\nAn example of your vvv-custom.yml file?. vv as I know is not working anymore with VVV 2.x.\nIs not requried anymore a script because with the config file is more simple then before and create a lot of issues.. This is CD USB Generator https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/CD-USB-Generator/\nThere is a way to generate the error? So we can see if it is fixed.. I am not sure also how to test, I am executing the CD USB generator to see if the problem disappear but looking on your screenshot you used the generator only to have a VVV version to destroy for try this patch.. To test:\ngit checkout  tomjn-trigger-failures\nvagrant destroy\nwith the vagrant machine halted and yes is like on the screen\n. You are talking about automatically update the coding standard installed inside VVV?\nBecause the title is not so clear.. Changed the title to be more explicative then before, i am not sure if with provision the coding standards are update autoamtically but seems yes https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/blob/develop/provision/provision.sh#L619\nAre you sure that the coding standard has this issues already fixed? maybe is not a problem of VVV.. Maybe a check if the certificate exist and in case not generate again?. Well it is a simple patch this one :-D. I noticed this error, I didn't saw when I checked this one:\nVagrant.require_plugin is deprecated and has no effect any longer.\nUse `vagrant plugin` commands to manage plugins. This warning will\nbe removed in the next version of Vagrant.. Sorry forgot that: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/blob/develop/Vagrantfile#L21. Ahahah no worry I will check later if fix the problem!. So probably add a warning about this plugin if not found in the vagrantfile can be an alternative solution.. Just a question is not better to move on 16.04?. Ok but I think that we need to start planning an upgrade because more we wait and more will be difficult to do that.. If you see is marked for 2.3 milestone but as I know the plan iso for 3 for custom builds.. I don't use windows so we have to see for others.. I can confirm that VVV has some problems with the actual combination of PHP 7.2 and phpmyadmin. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47668550/error-in-phpmyadmin-after-updating-to-php-7-2-0\nseems a common problem but fixed in the latest releases. I found this guide better because contain already all the commands https://akrabat.com/installing-xhgui-via-ansible/\nThere is a way to do the provision only of the utilities to speed up the process @tomjn?. Seems that I implemented that :-). this integration is waiting for testing :-). Just for test:\n\nto use https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-utilities/pull/17/files change in your vvv-custom.yml utility-sources and add branch: mailhog\ngo to vvv folder and git pull & git checkout mailhog\ndo a vagrant provision\n\nFrom what I can see https://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/golang-go for ubuntu 14 go is available.\nActually is not working (not yet finished) but the file is created and go downloaded.. Let me know when it's time to test :-D. Wow I can confirm that works!. I made a screen that show in Firefox the permission to sent notifications, but I saw later that is in Italian. I hope that is not a problem.\n\nFor mailcatcher we can do that when is set mailhog is checked the mailcatcher folder and is removed everything about it.. I think too and the feature of browser notification is very handy, you have only to remember to press connect that is not made automatically, for the rest is very cool.. Maybe for the update of VVV we can do a check based if the file RELEASE-DATE-4.8.1 exist inside the folder in case update to the latest that in our case is 4.8.1.\nSO we can avoid the problem with old users.. I can test on linux but in any case is very cool!\n. I am not sure if ping google is the best option, maybe ping wordpress.org instead? so we are neutral.. Maybe we can implement a converter to the new format?. did you press the connect button on mailhog?\n. After a check seems that there are still traces of mailcatcher on provisioning.\nwith \nsudo rm /etc/php/*/mods-available/mailcatcher.ini\nsudo rm /etc/php/*/fpm/conf.d/20-mailcatcher.ini \nfrom inside the machine and a restart now php use the default sendmail values but is not loading the mailhog settings.\nTesting with Check Email plugin the email are tracked by mailhog.. I done a vagrant provision and the mailhog file is on /etc/php/5.6/mods-available but not in /etc/php/5.6/fpm/conf.d as example.\nSeems that there are symlinks to all the files in that folder in the other one.\nMaybe we need a way that the provision automatically create them?. How this parameter is used?. Maybe we can add an alert in the dashboard about all the tools not used.. guest additions is something that you can install in vagrant.\nI am using this plugin for that https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest that automatically update in the VM.. guest additions is something that you can install in vagrant.\nI am using this plugin for that https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest that automatically update in the VM.. I cannot test it because I don't use windows, if linux is enough I can do that.. I cannot test it because I don't use windows, if linux is enough I can do that.. To test what I have to do? execute npm install on the folders of the pr?. To test what I have to do? execute npm install on the folders of the pr?. I agree on support open source solution and for others, without someone that can test/use it is quite difficult to keep them.. I am investigating because I have the same problem.\nRight now I am tryng to understand if xDebug is running and enabled (it is, the profile works) but:\n```\n<?php\n$sock = socket_create(AF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,0);\nsocket_bind($sock, '192.168.50.1', 9000) or die();\nsocket_listen($sock);\n$client = socket_accept($sock);\necho \"connection established $client\";\nsocket_close($client);\nsocket_close($sock);\n``\nThis script hang from host and ip changed also from insde the VM.\nLooking withnetstat -tulpn | grep \":9000\"if I enable withxdebug_on` that command show nothing.\nInside the log at every my test I get:\nLog opened at 2018-08-28 13:13:20\nI: Connecting to configured address/port: 192.168.50.1:9000.\nW: Creating socket for '192.168.50.1:9000', poll success, but error: Operation now in progress (29).\nE: Could not connect to client. :-(\nLog closed at 2018-08-28 13:13:20. I tried the script also with 127.0.0.1 without success. \nSo just to be sure I made a vagrant destroy and a new machine so I have the feeling that xdebug is not open.\nvagrant@vvv:/srv/www$ lsof -Pi\nCOMMAND  PID    USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME\nmailhog 4776 vagrant    5u  IPv6  53041      0t0  TCP *:1025 (LISTEN)\nmailhog 4776 vagrant    6u  IPv6  51788      0t0  TCP *:8025 (LISTEN)\nIn that output should be xdebug but doesn't seem the case.. Nevermind was my client with issues.. I use that command on my develop,ent, that log is available inside the website folder in a debug.log folder.\nI am using also a bash alias to tail the log of the website I want to debug https://github.com/Mte90/My-Scripts/blob/master/bashrc#L153. I use error_log and I get that error in vvv/www/site/htdocs/wp-content/debug.log. The problem is that *.dev got a redirect to https and we need to generate a certificate and auto generated certification open an alert inside the browser.. You are right, I forgot that (I am not using it XD). I like the method to check the latest version from github. \nI think that we can use also for other stuff, what do you think @tomjn?\nI have to test it but seems good for me :-). uhm maybe can be difficult to do a gitignore with gitpull because there are changes not saved? \nI mean I move all the website folders in the root like that and on a git pull what will happen?. I am wondering if a contributor day require more features but anyway we can start from disabling the provision.. good idea but for that we can open an issue. I will try to work on that in the next days. I think that we can integrate https://github.com/JPry/vvv-base or a little part . Yes my idea is to replicate it many of them without PHP but pure bash using wp-cli.. I think that can be helpful also for that https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/vvv-utilities/pull/18\nMaybe we can think to add in the nginx config a placeholder like #vvv and the various script and template append what they need in a specific file and vvv automatically add that content.\nOr to be more easyly we can create a new folder for every position we want that scripts can put the file that want are loaded in nginx in a specific folder following the nginx rules (with an include inside the nginx file).. If we do folders where put nginx configs that hook on the various part this can be used also from utilities.. As today now there is a new folder for utilities but nothing for templates because right now is not clear what we need specifically.. Seems that there are issues with NPM on installing grunt.\nCan you try with a vagrant provision?. Maybe we can change the title of the website like \"WP Nightly Contribute version\"\nBecause many people seems open the dashboard and don't read was his written.\nSo maybe we can improve that too adding like an alert on clicking and opening that website.\nOr adding in the custom file as default a stable site and switch the order inside the dashboard.. I done a provision yesterday and I got installed php7.3 in VVV and php command symlinked to php7.3 creating issues with WPCLI because WP right now doesn't support the 7.3.\nSo I manually removed the symlink and made a new one.. maybe, I don't know right now. Maybe we need a check if the vvv-custom file is creating issue with yaml and block the process.. So if you try to open vvv.test on the browser what kind of error you get?\nBecause seems that everything is downloaded and configured.. So looking on that seems that is not added on the hosts file, can you try on changing the order and putting your website on the top before the local.wordpress site block?\n. Well you have to change the order and do a vagrant halt/up.\nIn the past I had a similar problem and this fixed for me, if the problem happen also with you we have a confirmed bug.. Move the setting block that now is the third one of your website to the first one.\nHalt/up shutdown/restart the machine, reload is another thing.. Problem resolved was using 2 different installation of vvv ed executing form the one where he wasn't doing changes.. I think that is part of https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/1464. Right now this is the first part to be used by utilities so they not conflicts with sites.\nhttps://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template/pull/5/ now I am working to add a support to inject settings for nginx inside a file.. Ok seems that nginx works, with this utilities but also custom sites can inject rules globally to all the websites.. Changes done, now is only for custom-utilities. Well g in regex is for global to replace everywhere in the document and not only on the first occurrence.\nSeems that sed replace at first occurrence in the linen so enforce it for me is not a problem.\nAnyway seems strange because we have this replacement from a lot and no one complained about it :-/. Well if we are talking of performance this doesn't change a lot, check only if the tool inside that folder have the files but this will apply also to the tools that are not enabled and this is not good indeed :-/\nThe problem of using the utilities is that they can have a different folder name compared to the utilities name. Right now the folder for the tideways is xhgui but the tool is another one because xhgui is the UI.\nWith this implementation we ignore this problem.. I misunderstood because I have a file provision.sh in the folder so I added the file on the utilities folder not on the global one, so right now the implementation check inside /var/www/default/[tool] for the file.. So you want that VVV itself to some standard stuff like move this files of every utilities:\n\nvvv-hosts to /VVV/provision (with merge of an existing one)\nvvv-nginx.conf to /etc/nginx/custom-utilities (inside virtual machine)\n\nAlso:\n\nexecute vvv-init.sh instead provision.sh for utilities (inside the virtual machine)\nremove the code of scanning and use the path of the global vvv-hosts \n\nJust to understand what I have to do :-). Rejected because there is a better version . Rejected because there is a better version . This seems a new error, are you sure to have the latest version of vagrant and virtualbox?. Fork the plugin and include in VVV can speed up the installation process with a less step and be sure that all the users will have that package installed so seems not a bad idea after all.. I made a fork that execute the update of the hosts after the provision instead before https://github.com/Mte90/vagrant-hostsupdater/blob/19e5d086ef6d28d2b10df435db84da6af37d70a4/lib/vagrant-hostsupdater/plugin.rb#L24\nI think that we need to update the vagrantfile anyway with a trigger that is executed at end of provision https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/triggers/configuration.html to update the list of hosts.\nI am wondering what is the order anyway before the vagrantfile and later the plugin?\nI didn't done the pull request yet because of this thoughts.\n. just a ping to understand how to move on that.\nThe fork of the plugin exist, I need to do a pr for it.\n. just a ping to understand how to move on that.\nThe fork of the plugin exist, I need to do a pr for it.\n. Maybe we can add a way that check the package in use and alert the user.\nAnyway I will do the pr soon and see if they approve that change so if it is official there are less issues.\nAnother option is to do another package only for us that include the support for the trigger that we need and check if it is installed.. Maybe with https://stackoverflow.com/a/28801317/1902215 we can avoid to integrate but execute automatically the installation with the download of our gem.\nIn that way the plugin can coexist in his repo etc and avoid more code inside VVV.\nAlso with that code we can force to install the plugin, also all the plugin that we need and avoid more confusions with the users and remove a step from the guide.. I tried with using a subfolder but xhgui doesn't work, only with a domain works :-/. You are right I didn't saw the wildcard at the end :-). We need to add in the troubleshooting to disable AV in case. I had the same problem, done a vagrant destroy and vagrant up and everything was fixed.\nI think that something on provision fault in a bad way and this created issues.. I was facing the same problem, seems that can be a yaml issue.\nI tested with a linter and found the issue and fixed and now started without no problems.. I was facing the same problem, seems that can be a yaml issue.\nI tested with a linter and found the issue and fixed and now started without no problems.. I don't have an OSX environment to do a test. We need docs about this settings on the website.\nMaybe we can also improve the cd-usb-generator and add that parameters.. Maybe we can do a script that is executed only on when there is the bump of the distro.\nIn that way we can do a full backup of the database to reimport later and add other integrations in case we need it.. Maybe we can do a script that is executed only on when there is the bump of the distro.\nIn that way we can do a full backup of the database to reimport later and add other integrations in case we need it.. yes but I think that this depend on #1632.\nSo with a flag will be possible to install plugins. I was studying yesterday how to add new fields in the yaml plugin to specify the plugins to download.. Yes there is already, if @benlumia007 want to try to do a pull request to the template is not a problem.\nI was only studing better for #1632 how to do everything :-). I was thinking that we can add a parameter plugins: so we can put the query monitor plugins and the users can use this also for others plugins.\nSo in the future we can add also other plugins like user-siwtcher or airplane-mode as example.. I can work on that in the next days but I prefer to know about my other pr (tideways) or template(the one about wpcli) before add other stuff in queue that became old and create issue on manage them before approve..

I wouldn't mind putting a PR together if we could define what standards we want to use for which file types.

We could also explicitly list every folder we want to include in each rule declaration, but that would be a lot more unwieldy and difficult to maintain.\nWith the exception of markdown and diff files, I'd say the following settings should be consistent across all file types:\ncharset = utf-8\nend_of_line = lf\ninsert_final_newline = true\ntrim_trailing_whitespace = true\nSo basically it's just a matter of what we want to use for the indent_size and indent_style for each file type.

Not impossible but less likely I think.\nThe ideal is for VVV to match a production environment as closely as possible, but until that's possible with a choice of PHP version in VVV, I'd suggest that being conservative is the right way to go (alas).\n.

I looked at my local VVV \"CHANGELOG.md\" and it said I was still on 1.2.0 from December 14, 2014, which was out of date. \nAfter running across this issue and comments I decided to try upgrading my environment using @cfoellmann suggestion above. Before doing this I made a copy of my full \"VVV\" directory I have on my local machine to another directory for safe keeping. My VVV folder is located under \"Documents\\VVV\", but your directory might be \"vagrant-local\" if you followed the VVV install instructions directly.\nI use the GitHub Desktop for managing my Git repositories, so I synced the \"VVV\" respository by clicking \"Sync\" in the desktop client. This is the same as running the git pull command in your local \"VVV\" directory.\nNext I tried vagrant up -provision command mentioned by @cfoellmann, but it didn't work. I then tried running just vagrant up and it kind of worked, but I received an error when it got to the Executing command \"vagrant ssh -c vagrant_up\" section. I could still get to my local development sites, but the error bugged me and I wondered what else might be incorrect. I then ran the vagrant halt command to shut down my VVV virtual machine and did some more research.\nI went to https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/cli/up.html and realized the command should be vagrant up --provision with two dashes instead of one. I started VVV again, but this time by typing vagrant up --provision and it forced the provisioners to re-run. This time Vagrant downloaded everything the new version of VVV needed and finished booting correctly without any errors.\nI checked the \"CHANGELOG.md\" file and it says I have VVV version 1.3.0 from February 21, 2016. My development sites are also still right where I left them before the upgrade and working as expected. \nIf this isn't the correct way to upgrade your VVV installation, please let us know, but it looks like everything is working in my environment after using the git pull and vagrant up --provision commands mentioned above.\n.

If not, can I still use these instructions to keep my VVV (and related components) up to date?. @gbot OK yes I see--thanks for that.. @gbot OK yes I see--thanks for that.. Thanks for the reply.\n\n\nIs it possible that something happened to the virtual machine that destroyed it?\n\n\nYes indeed.  The origin of this issue was that I powered down my local computer without remembering to shut down Vagrant in some way (e.g. 'vagrant halt').  On my next bootup, I guess I accidentally ran a full 'vagrant up,' which installed a new WordPress.  There were a few steps in-between that I did not document--troubleshooting steps.  I think it was during that time that I went astray.\nAnyway, I resolved the issue.  After posting here, I fully ran through the new WordPress installation, which did not take long.  I then noticed that my WordPress files were present in this new install--i.e. my theme was still there, as well as images, etc.  It did not have my WP database, but I was able to easily install that since I had been keeping my web server synced to the site on my local computer--I migrated my WP database from my web server to my local machine (using the WP plugin \"Migrate DB\") and all was resolved.  \nI guess the overarching issue was that I didn't know exactly how to troubleshoot the issue.  Currently, Vagrant is still mostly a black-box to me.  So when something goes wrong, there's not too much troubleshooting I can do.  Actually, in this case, I think the little troubleshooting I tried actually made it worse.  Before posting here, I posted to various the Vagrant Google Group, a few sub-Reddits, and Stack Overflow, but without much response.  Although, eventually someone in the Vagrant group indicated that my db might be corrupted and I'd have to re-build it--but that was after I had resolved my issue.\nYour note on \"[not installed]\" may be handy for the future though.\nThanks for the reply.  We can consider this resolved.. Great, thanks for that.  Let's mark this particular issue resolved then.  Over the next few days I'll assemble all the relevant information and post a new issue here.\nThanks.\nedit:  When I post general questions here, do you want me to mark/tag them in any special manner?. Gotcha--will do.. Thanks very much for the reply.\n\nAlso, if you're encountering issues, copy paste them here, I might be able to point you in a specific direction\n\nOK, I'm up for that.  Per your suggestion, before carrying out any uninstall steps, I had a look at the \"Starting from Fresh\" instructions on the Troubleshooting page.  I tried following the instructions, but encountered an error with the first step (git pull).  If you're up for it, I'd love to walk through those steps with you and resolve resolve any issues.\nBefore we get too sidetracked though, how about we mark this particular issue as resolved so I can then open a new one with my specific git pull issue?  Does that sound reasonable?  Or should we carry on our discussion here?  I'll defer to you and/or the mods on how to proceed..\nThanks.\nedit:  I actually resolved my git pull issue, but have another question regarding updating Vagrant.. > Have you used the uninstaller then reinstalled or did you install over the top of an older version?\nI actually didn't follow any of your uninstall steps (sorry!).  I saw the Starting from Fresh instructions and decided to first have a go at them.  From those instructions, I ran:\ngit pull\nvagrant halt\nvagrant destroy\nall without issue.  I then ran vagrant box update and it completed without issue.  But shouldn't this step have updated my version of Vagrant to the latest version (v 2.0.1)?  If I check my current Vagrant version, it is still v1.8.6.  Or am I misunderstanding something?\nI have not carried out any of the remaining steps.  I wanted to first understand what was happening here.. OK thanks for that info.  Progress is being made, slowly but surely.\n\nTo update Vagrant itself you need to download it from vagrantup.com\n\nI did this, and in the process confirmed that my installation of Vagrant had become corrupt.  I was able to uninstall it, then install the latest version.  I also updated Oracle VM to the latest version as well (v5.2).\nOn the next step though (vagrant plugin install vagrant-triggers vagrant-vbguest vagrant-hostsupdater), an error was returned:\n```\n$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-triggers vagrant-vbguest vagrant-hostsupdater\nInstalling the 'vagrant-triggers' plugin. This can take a few minutes...\nBundler, the underlying system Vagrant uses to install plugins,\nreported an error. The error is shown below. These errors are usually\ncaused by misconfigured plugin installations or transient network\nissues. The error from Bundler is:\nconflicting dependencies ffi (= 1.9.18) and ffi (= 1.9.14)\n  Activated ffi-1.9.14\n  which does not match conflicting dependency (= 1.9.18)\nConflicting dependency chains:\n    ffi (= 1.9.14), 1.9.14 activated\nversus:\n    ffi (= 1.9.18)\nGems matching ffi (= 1.9.18):\n    ffi-1.9.18-x64-mingw32\n```\n Thoughts?  Should I try to resolve these?  If so, how?. > Uninstall Vagrant completely then install Vagrant 2.0\nThat's actually what I did in this case--I uninstalled my existing Vagrant, then downloaded and installed the latest version.  I can try it again though for posterity if you think it will help.. > If it worked for you then great, it's just a cleaner way of doing the same thing.\nSorry for the confusion.  But what I was trying to say was that I already carried out full uninstall/reinstall of Vagrant, and I'm still experiencing the plugin install error.  I can open a new issue about it if you'd like.. > it's a general Vagrant problem, not something specific to VVV. \nOK that statement is helpful actually.  Perhaps I can try posting to a general Vagrant forum (e.g. the Vagrant Google Group).. Sorry for re-opening this, but I wanted to get some clarification on the uninstall steps you gave earlier.  To be clear, I'm looking to completely uninstall VVV, all of its components, and remove all associated files (so i can re-install).  Would it be sufficient to carry out these steps:\n\n\nUninstall VirtualBox (since this will carry out a vagrant destroy)\n\n\nUninstall Vagrant.\n\n\nDelete my VVV folder.\n\n\nEnsure the C:\\Users\\\\VirtualBox VMs folder is deleted (as per the Troubleshooting documentation).\n\n\nWould that be a complete uninstall, or would I be missing anything?\nTo be  clear, I'm doing this as part of troubleshooting related to this previous issue I raised about long TTFB.

I have one follow-up question.  \n\n\n\"How do I avoid having to type a password in/start an admin console every time I vagrant up/halt?\"\n\n\nThis is indeed the issue I wanted to address--thanks for that.  \n\n\nThis leads to new problems however:\nvagrant will still try to modify the hosts file\nif succesful you'll end up with duplicates\nthere's no guarantee that the IP it uses will remain the same\n\n\nOK great--this is actually the information I was trying to ascertain:  the drawbacks of copying/pasting into my hosts file.  I'll move forward with using an elevated command prompt then.. OK thanks for the tips.  I discovered that in Windows, it's quite easy to instruct a shortcut to always open with admin privs.  See this link for instructions.  The instructions say they are for Windows 7, but they also apply to Windows 10.. Thanks for the reply.\n\n\nIn the meantime, what does the public_html folder contain?\n\n\nThis might be my issue.  I wasn't sure whether I needed to first copy WordPress files into this folder or not, so I left it empty.  As part of the vagrant reload --provision process, the latest WordPress files were downloaded into the root directory--i.e. the folder containing the public_html folder--leaving the public_html empty.  Did I do something incorrectly there?. OK I can certainly give that new code a try.  But to confirm, should I have a public_html folder already created?  And should it be empty?. OK I added your code to vvv-custom.yml' and reprovisioned. \n The output is [here](https://gist.github.com/cagross/361b3f00d83416b2d4c0d27c4f73bc03\n).  The results were that vvv.test does indeed recognize that a new site was created at cagross.test.  But it is in thewordpress-develop` section (screenshot)--I'm not sure how expected that is.  Also though, when I open the URL http://cagross.test, I am met with an error, \"Problem: Could not load the site, this implies that provisioning the site failed, please check there were no errors during provisioning, and reprovision.\" (screenshot).  Thoughts?  I guess I could try to reprovision.. OK thanks for that (I now see that warning in the .yml file).  I fixed the indentation issues, and all issues are gone.  After reprovisioning, the new site appears as expected, at the expected URL.  We can consider this closed then--thanks a bunch.. @tomjn OK sure.  Give me a couple hours to read through and leave comments.  Do you want me to leave comments here in this thread?  Or should I leave comments in the \"Review comments\" section of the pull request you linked?. Well I've never done something like that before in GitHub.  But I think I can handle it.  If it's OK, for simplicity, I'll stick to adding comments (rather than 'approve' or 'request changes').. OK thanks for the reply.  I hear what you are saying.  But are you able to point me to any links that might help me add SSL to my VVV site--maybe one that has helped you in the past?  I would imagine many people before me would have encountered this issue.\nAs an alternative, would I be able to add the SSL certificate to my remote site, yet leave it unchanged on my VVV site?  Would there be any issues if I did that?  One potential issue I see with that is in the database sync between the two sites. Namely, if I migrate to SSL on my web server, part of the process would involve a global search and replace of the database on the remote site (i.e. roughly speaking, I would replace all http strings with https).  But I would just lose these changes after the next VVV edit, since the edit would entail pushing my local VVV database to my remote database.  I'm not sure how to resolve that.  Would I be able to carry out the same http-->https search and replace on my VVV site?  If so, then I guess the two databases would remain in-sync, alleviating the issue I described.\n\nI can tell you though with absolute certainty that the godaddy article you\nlinked to will not work,\n\nGotcha.  I wasn't suggesting that those instructions would work for my VVV installation--I was reasonably sure they wouldn't. I was just disclosing what method I would use on my web server.  But good to know the reasons why they don't apply to VVV.\n. > Is a WXR import/export an option?\nI'm not sure what WXR import/export is.  I've never heard of it :-/\n\nThere's all the usual methods available inside the VVV VM, I'd suggest WP CLI search replace\n\nWell what I was getting at when asking about the search and replace was whether I could get away with updating SSL on my remote site, yet foregoing it on my local VVV site.  My feeling though is that will not be possible, since the remote site (files, database) will have their URLs updated from http to https, while the local VVV site will not.  Would you agree that this update-remote-while-forego-on-local option would not be viable?  In other words, if I migrate to SSL on my remote site, I will have to do the same on my local site--correct?  Or have I misunderstood something?. > I don't know how viable converting from https to http for local then back again via search replace to https is. It's probably doable, but it's not something I've had to do before\nOK thanks very much for your help so far.  But it sounds like I'm not explaining this method well enough.   My mistake, as I probably don't understand the underlying concepts of SSL as much as I should :-/  But just to be clear, let me try again.\nLet's say I've setup a site on my local computer with VVV, and I've successfully pushed it (files and database) to my remote server.  Then I successfully install an SSL certificate on my remote server only, and ensure everything in WordPress is SSL compliant (i.e. URLs are changed from http to https, etc).  At the same time, I leave my local VVV site as-is as far as SSL.  If I then make a new edit locally, and push the edit (files and database) to my remote server, will there be new SSL-related issues on my remote site?  My intuition says 'yes,' because in the very least it sounds like I will be pushing the http URLs from my local site to my SSL-enabled remote site, which requires https URLs.  Am I correct here, or have I misunderstood something?\nI'd just like to be concrete on this method before continuing to discuss SSL methods for VVV.  I am very happy to discuss those methods further, and would prefer to do so, in this thread, if you are willing to discuss further.  Also, if you want to take this opportunity to use me as a guinea pig so to speak, I would be willing.   If you wanted to describe a rough method of installing SSL for VVV, I could do so, document my steps, and go through some trial and error with you until I get it working.  That way maybe you could at least have the start of some SSL-for-VVV documentation.  Of course I'd only be able to test on my single system (Windows 10).  Anyway, just throwing that out there.. OK thanks very much for that.  I'll try to test those instructions tonight (hopefully within ~12-15 hours).  I'll leave feedback here if that's OK.. I just want to confirm a few things before I start:\nI have not begun to install an SSL certificate on my production site, and my VVV site and production site are completely in-sync.  Should I do migrate my production site to SSL separately, before carrying out your instructions?  Or in-theory, should it not matter which I do first?\n\nOnce reprovisioned, you can also go to certificates/ca/cert.crt. Add this to your keychain on MacOS/Accept the certificate as an authority in Windows/etc, and restart your browser. Now all VVV sites using the custom site template support https, with no warnings\n\nThis is a required step, not a merely suggested step--correct?  Not complaining or anything, but I just want to be sure.\nThanks.\nedit:  Some things came up, so I won't be able to test this for 2-3 days :-/  I'll update you then.. @tomjn OK thanks for explaining that.\nI am starting your instructions now.  The first step is:\n\nUpdate to the latest VVV develop\n\nHow exactly can I confirm if I am running VVV develop, and how would I in-turn update to the latest version?. Ah OK, so develop is my current branch--got it.\nOK I'm already on the develop branch, and carried out a git pull without issue.\nThe next step is:\n\nAdd tls-ca under core: to the utilities section,\n\nThe link you posted shows how to add tls-ca to vvv-config.yml.  But my vvv-config.yml already has this entry.  However my vvv-custom.yml does not.  Should I add the tls-ca line to vvv-custom.yml?  Or should I move on to the next step (reprovision)?\n. OK thanks.  I carried out that step without issue.  I then carried out the 'Reprovision' step by executing a vagrant up, then a vagrant provision.  The provision step returned some warnings/errors regarding the database. The output in-question is:\n``\n  default: Creating database 'cagross' (if it's not already there)\n    default:  DB operations done.\n    default: PHP Notice:  Undefined index: SERVER_NAME in phar:///usr/local/bin/wp/php/WP_CLI/Runner.php(1138) : eval()'d code on line 22\n    default: PHP Warning:  mysqli_real_connect(): (HY000/1045): Access denied for user 'db-user-el'@'localhost' (using password: YES) in /srv/www/cagross/public_html/wp-includes/wp-db.php on line 1531\n    default: Warning: mysqli_real_connect(): (HY000/1045): Access denied for user 'db-user-el'@'localhost' (using password: YES) in /srv/www/cagross/public_html/wp-includes/wp-db.php on line 1531\n    default: Error: Error establishing a database connection. This either means that the username and password information in yourwp-config.phpfile is incorrect or we can\u2019t contact the database server atlocalhost`. This could mean your host\u2019s database server is down.\n```\nThis seems to indicate that a connection cannot be made to my database.  But I can still open the site in-question (http://cagross.test), both the front-end and back-end.  Shouldn't that be impossible if there is an error establishing a database connection?\nI should also say that I am reasonably sure I have never encountered these particular warnings/errors. I have accessed this particular VVV site several times over the past few weeks, and have never encountered an error connecting to the database.\nHere is a pastebin of the complete output from vagrant provision.\nMaybe as a troubleshooting step, I can step back:  I can undo the tls-ca edit I made to vvv-custom.yml then try a reprovision to see if the same errors occur?  Do you think that would that be fruitful?. >  have you made any changes to that sites wp-config.php?\nActually, now that you mention it, I did, a few weeks ago.  But I thought I tested everything after the change and confirmed there were no issues.  In hindsight though, I may not have re-provisioned.  Is it necessary to re-provision after making an edit to wp-config.php?\nLet me look into this some more on my end.  If I can't resolve the issue, I will open a new issue as you suggested.  I'll re-visit the SSL task after.. @tomjn Hey I'm back--sorry for the delay.  I was able to resolve that database error myself.  So my vagrant provision step completed without issue.  Per your instructions, the next step is:\n\nIf you're using the wordpress-develop or custom site templates, visit your site and switch to https.\n\nI am indeed using a custom site template.  But what exactly do you mean by this?  Are you saying I should login to my local WordPress back-end, open Settings-->General, and change both WordPress Address (URL) and Site Address (URL) to https (screenshot)?  Or are you referring to another setting--perhaps a VVV setting?. Hey @tomjn, any update on this?  I'm just trying to clarify your earlier instruction to 'switch to https.'  Does this mean I should open Settings-->General and change both WordPress Address (URL) and Site Address (URL) to https?\nThanks for your assistance so far. This is (hopefully) the last step in this process for me.  After this is complete, if it would be useful, I can send you a somewhat detailed version of the steps I took, any issues I encountered, and my results.. OK thanks for that.  I tried following the CSS Tricks article you linked, but was met with an error on the first step (step 2 actually, since we already carried out step 1).  The instruction is to add this line to wp-config:\ndefine('FORCE_SSL_ADMIN', true);\nI did so, then tried accessing my VVV WordPress back-end (https://cagross.test/wp-admin/).  But I was met with an error:  NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID (screenshot).  The instructions don't really touch on any potential errors during this step.  They merely say that if all goes well, I will get a secure connection.   Thoughts on that?  It seems to not like the certificate. . OK thanks for that.  Yes, my mistake--your previous instructions did indeed mention something like this might happen.  So per your previous instructions, I skipped past that initial 'privacy error' displayed by my browser (Google Chrome).  But when the browser opens my site (back-end or front-end), the navigation bar still displays a 'not secure' error (screenshot).  Is this expected at this point?  I only ask because the CSS Tricks instructions indicate at this point, the navigation bar should instead display a green 'secure' icon.  Or perhaps your previous instruction regarding certificates/ca/cert.crt will alleviate this issue?  That instruction was:\n\nOnce reprovisioned, you can also go to certificates/ca/cert.crt. Add this to your keychain on MacOS/Accept the certificate as an authority in Windows/etc, and restart your browser. Now all VVV sites using the custom site template support https, with no warnings\n\nI wasn't sure if this was intended to alleviate merely the initial 'privacy error' page, or the navigation bar error as well.\n. OK got it.  So if I understand correctly, my next step is to carry out these instructions:\n\nyou can also go to certificates/ca/cert.crt. Add this to your keychain on MacOS/Accept the certificate as an authority in Windows/etc, and restart your browser.\n\nIf so, since I am on Windows, what exactly are the steps here?  I can open the folder certificates/ca, but to be clear, I see a file ca.crt, not cert.crt.  Is ca.crt the file you mean?  And what exactly do you mean by \"Accept the certificate as an authority in Windows?\"  What does that entail exactly?  Do I need to perhaps add a new SHA to ca.crt?  Or do I need to create a new .crt file?. OK thanks for that explanation.  It helps to illustrate this exact process.  I'll work on adding the new certificate to Windows.\n\nVVV creates a brand new CA from scratch on provision, that's not been seen before, so you have to tell your OS to trust it.\n\nAm I correct that the certificate issued by VVV's brand new CA is C:\\Users\\snarl\\websites\\sites\\certificates\\ca\\ca.cert?\n. OK I got it working.  Here were my steps to add the new VVV certificate to Windows:\n\nOpen the new VVV certificate.  For me, this was named ca.cert, and located in the folder \\certificates\\ca\\ca.cert.\nFollow on-screen prompts to add certificate to Windows.  However, it asks you where you want to install the certificate.  The default option is to allow Windows to choose the location, depending on the type of certificate.  I tried that at first, and it didn't work.  I then tried again, this time specifying a specific location to install:  Trusted Root Certification Authorities store.  I then re-started the browser and the Chrome navigation bar finally displayed the URL as 'secure.'\n\nBut now I've observed a new, seemingly related issue.  Every time I restart my browser, when I attempt to login to my VVV WordPress back-end, it forgets my password, i.e. the password I have set for my lone WordPress user isn't recognized.  I have to use the 'forget password' link, then check Mailcatcher for the 'reset password' email and use the link there to reset my password.  This occurs every time I re-start the browser.  If I merely logout of WordPress, then log back in without re-starting the browser, the issue is not present.  I first noticed this issue right after I re-provisioned during the step 'Add tls-ca under core: to the utilities section.'  Since then, I've confirmed it occurs every time I re-start my browser.\nThoughts on this?  Do you want me to perhaps open a new 'issue,' or should we keep going here?. OK got it.  Let me try to do some more troubleshooting on that issue then.  Thanks for your help.. @tomjn To update you, to resolve the issue of WordPress forgetting my password, I was advised to run a search-and-replace to replace all http URLs with https URLs.  I didn't think it would do much, since this was a fresh WordPress install.  But I used a search-and-replace plugin (Better Search Replace) and it returned one result, in the wp-posts table.  When I executed the search-replace, the issue went away.  So I guess that was it.  \nThanks for your help in all of that.. @tomjn To update you, to resolve the issue of WordPress forgetting my password, I was advised to run a search-and-replace to replace all http URLs with https URLs.

When I executed the search-replace, the issue went away.  So I guess that was it.  \nThanks for your help in all of that.. > Note that htaccess is for Apache severs and VVV uses Nginx, \nGot it, thanks for the reminder.\n\nhave you tried setting those values from within PHP in wp-config.php? \n\nNo, that's the thing--I have not tried that yet.  I was kind of hoping to determine the correct protocol now, while I have the time to kill, rather than at the time I need to implement these edits.  But give me a day or two and I can try to test this on my end.  I'll reply back here with results.\n\nYou shouldn't need to modify php.ini, but if you did it would impact all VVV sites\n\nGot it.  I would hope to avoid this situation.\n. Thanks for that.\nI checked the default settings for the PHP configuration options I wanted to change, and they exceed what I need.  So I don't think I actually need to make any changes.\n\nFor now I'd recommend using ini_set in wp-config.php for site specific changes -\nhttps://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.ini-set.php\n\nAs a learning experience though, I would still like to test this.  But when adding ini_set() to wp-config.php, which of the four changeable modes  does that correspond to?  I'm sure it falls under PHP_INI_ALL.  But which of the others (if any) does it fall into?  Does it classify as a 'user script,' as in the description for PHP_INI_USER?  I would assume it does not meet the qualifications for PHP_INI_PERDIR or PHP_INI_SYSTEM.\n. OK.  We can consider this resolved.  But just to give some info, I actually wasn't able to change any of my parameters using ini_set(), nor could I get the example on the man page to work.  This is a little out of my domain though, so there could definitely be some user error at play here.  Again though, I'm fine moving forward with the default values.. @tomjn OK thanks for that.  A git pull appeared to complete without issue.. @tomjn Sorry for the delay, but I'm just getting back to this.  I wasn't able to try your suggestion at the time.  And since that time there has been an update to both Virtual Machine and Vagrant.  So I decided to re-start the Keeping Up To Date instructions from the beginning.  I updated VM and Vagrant, and carried out all other steps without issue.  But vagrant up step failed again, with a different error:\ndefault: nginx: [alert] could not open error log file: open() \"/var/log/nginx/error.log\" failed (2: No such file or directory)\ndefault: 2018/09/17 17:14:00 [emerg] 16033#16033: open() \"/var/log/nginx/error.log\" failed (2: No such file or directory)\ndefault: nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test failed\nWould you like me to open a new, separate issue for this?\nedit:  Sorry, I think I accidentally closed this issue.  I'll re-open and let you do what you want with it.. No no, I can and will provide all of those relevant details.  What I'm asking you here is if I should do so in this issue, or create a new issue.. OK thanks.\nIn an effort to provide the 'entire confection,' I just spent some time re-creating my steps.  Unsurprisingly, I found the issue:  user error.  Specifically, the last step in the instructions clearly says to run vagrant up --provision.  But I previously ran only vagrant up.  This time, I ran vagrant up --provision and there was no error in the output--the process completed, seemingly without issue.  To test, I just logged in to my local WordPress sites and there appear to be no immediate issues.  So I guess we can consider this resolved?\nFor what it's worth, here were was the relevant information behind my issue, including the full error log at the time:\nVVV version: 2.2.1-98-g1860077\nVVV Git Branch: develop\nVagrant version: Vagrant 2.1.5\nVM Provider name: VirtualBox\nVM Provider version: Version 5.2.18 r124319 (Qt5.6.2)\nOperating System and version: Win 10, x64\nFull vagrant up output can be seen here.. @tomjn   Sounds good.. @tomjn   Sounds good.. OK thanks for that.\n\nIIRC the oldest is php56, they're all folders in the core utility repo\n\nI'd like to check this.  But where is the core utility repo?  . OK I see--in the vvv-utilities repo, correct?  I see that PHP 5.6 is the oldest.  Let me try again with that and report back here.. OK that worked as expected.  Let's consider this resolved then--thanks.. OK understood on all.  I just used phpmyadmin and removed the database in-question.  We can consider this resolved, thanks.. > or that you're making lots of remote requests.\nOK interesting that you say that--I did not know that.  My page is making a relatively large amount of remote requests--all to Instagram to fetch images.  That is the result of one particular plugin.  If I deactivate that plugin, the TTFB seems to drop significantly--down to 4-5 seconds, which is more expected.  I've done a handful of tests now and it looks like I can consistently reproduce that.  So let's assume this is the cause of my TTFB issue.\nAs a follow-up though, the same number of remote requests are being made on my remote site.  Why might the TTFB on that site be relatively unaffected, while my VVV site incurs a relatively big TTFB hit?  Are remote requests from a local VVV site amplified for some reason compared to the same remote requests from a site on a web server?  Or can my local computer specs affect remote requests that much (including internet connection)?  Or neither?  Or something else?. > or that you're making lots of remote requests.\nOK interesting that you say that--I did not know that.

Or can my local computer specs affect remote requests that much (including internet connection)?  Or neither?  Or something else?. Hey thanks very much for all that info, and sorry for the late reply.\n\nWhich plugin did you deactivate that reduced TTFB so dramatically?\n\nWell the plugin is Photonic Gallery & Lightbox for Flickr, SmugMug, Google Photos, Picasa, Zenfolio and Instagram.  But I should first divulge that I am at least partially at fault for all of the remote requests from the plugin.  I am in the process of building my site, and trying to get the Instagram section to look the way I want.  So while I do that, I've actually been displaying two separate Instagram feeds on this particular page, one with configuration A and the other with configuration B.  Once I settle on a configuration, I'll remove the other.  Plus, at least one of those Instagram feeds (maybe both) is currently displaying a lot more images than it should.  I'm trying to get the 'limit' parameter to work, but it's not--so each feed is fetching and displaying the default number of images, which I believe is 40.  I want to eventually display only 20 images.Once I finalize the configuration of the plugin, I'll try to run another test and compare the dev site TTFB to my live site.  \nedit:  Actually, now that I think about it, there's even a third Instagram feed displayed on the page--in the footer--that makes even more remote requests (it displays 8 images).  That actually uses a different plugin.  The plan is to eventually replace that with the existing Instagram plugin, so hopefully there are no duplicate remote requests from Instagram.\nFYI my live site is on a shared server from SiteGround (the lowest-tiered shared hosting plan).\n\nSomething else that struck me is that TTFB being high suggests that there are output buffers preventing things from being sent until the page has finished generating so that post processing can occur, e.g. the Autoptimise plugin.\n\nRight.  I'm don't have any explicit optimization plugins installed.  But who knows, maybe my theme, or this particular Instagram plugin, have such 'features.'  I do have a security plugin installed--Wordfence.  It is installed on both dev and live site, but I'm not entirely sure that it is configured identically. Maybe I can try disabling on the dev site as a test.\nWhat about adding some code that will defer all JS requests?  Would that help alleviate the issue?\n\nmaking the API requests in a cron job so that the frontend only renders what's already been fetched\ncaching the response for 10 minutes, or even an hour.\nHaving something like IFTTT fire a webhook that flushes that cache could let you have it cached for days yet instantly update when a new post is made\nmake the requests in JS and render them client side\nMake the instagram queries in AJAX requests, use a REST API endpoint to do that part. This way even if Instagram takes 5 minutes to respond, the TTFB is nearly instant, and similar responses can be cached\n\nOK thanks very much for all those.  But in this case, wouldn't most (or all?) require me to modify the core files of this particular plugin?  Or would it be possible to implement those four suggestions by way of my my child theme, without altering any plugin files?  If anything, the second option (using IFTTT) might be something I can do without altering plugin files.  Also, interesting to know about IFTTT--didn't know it could be used in that manner.\n\nAs for the plugin you identified, what's it's job? \n\nWell it just serves to fetch some images from my Instagram page and display them nicely on my page, all while being responsive, and giving me a fair amount of customization options (e.g. different layouts, different lightbox galleries, etc).  Maybe I can run this TTFB issue by the dev--he seems pretty helpful.  But if finds out that the issue is not present on my live site, he may file it in the not-my-problem department.  Who knows though.\nI guess we can close this issue?  Or do you want to do some more troubleshooting/investigation?  I'm happy to do that if you want.  Or we can call it closed and move on.  Either way..

Also, interesting to know about IFTTT--didn't know it could be used in that manner.\n\nAs for the plugin you identified, what's it's job? \n\nWell it just serves to fetch some images from my Instagram page and display them nicely on my page, all while being responsive, and giving me a fair amount of customization options (e.g. different layouts, different lightbox galleries, etc).  Maybe I can run this TTFB issue by the dev--he seems pretty helpful.  But if finds out that the issue is not present on my live site, he may file it in the not-my-problem department.  Who knows though.\nI guess we can close this issue?  Or do you want to do some more troubleshooting/investigation?  I'm happy to do that if you want.  Or we can call it closed and move on.  Either way.. OK understood on both, thanks.  I have a small update.  I carried out two more tests:\n\nI finalized my Instagram feed and deleted the second, extraneous feed.  In 12 consecutive page loads after that, the average TTFB was 14 seconds.  Individual times were:\n\n17\n10\n10\n13\n15\n15\n15\n15\n15\n15\n16\n15\n\nI disabled the Wordfence plugin, and that lowered the average TTFB down to 9 seconds.  Individual scores:\n\n4\n7\n13\n7\n7\n14\n5\n12\n13\n12\n12\n7\nThe standard deviation on the second set is a bit high--not sure why they fluctuated like that.\nJust giving some more data here.  Another test I guess I could do is disable all unnecessary plugins, and switch to the default Twenty Nineteen theme.\n. OK understood on both, thanks.  I have a small update.

I just installed Query Monitor and see some interesting results (screenshot).  TTFB was ~9.5 seconds.  But only ~2.2 seconds of that was from remote requests (\"Photonic\" is the name of the Instagram plugin I'm using).  Thoughts on that?  Is it possible to obtain information on the other ~7 seconds of TTFB?   Also, I'm not sure what the \"Certificate verification disabled\" entry is specifying, or if it's something I should resolve.\nNot to steer this ticket in another direction, or add scope creep to it, but I should perhaps say that, now that I'm researching this, I am also experiencing unexpectedly long TTFBs on nearly all of my back-end admin pages.  ~4-8 seconds on each page load.  Here is an example from loading Dashboard-->Users.  Perhaps the two are related, or perhaps they are not.  Just throwing this out there for best possible analysis of the issue.. > DId you install the query monitor plugin?\nNo.  My mistake, I overlooked that part.

What about the page generation time that Query Monitor displays?  Would that be a better metric?\n\nAdditionally, is TTFB a problem for readme.html? Non-WP PHP scripts?\n\nGood question.  No.  I just checked for readme.html and license.txt--no issues at all.\n\nPoor performance is too generic and vague, I need you to be more specific, and time to first byte isn't a problem, it's a symptom\n\nOK I hear you, and understand.  I am indeed trying to ascertain more specific information.\n\nSo set up a standard WP with the default theme, and measure on that. If TTFB is still an issue there, then we can continue. Else it's quite unlikely to be VVV.\n\nOK.  What about using the wordpress-default site that comes with VVV?  That is of course devoid of any extra plugins and media, but it also should have a reasonably simple and default database.  That site loads blazing fast for me, as expected.  Doesn't exhibit any TTFB at all.  Conversely, if I switch my site to the default 2019 theme,\nI did some more tests on the default VVV WordPress site, and can perhaps better articulate the issue I'm seeing.  With the default VVV WordPress site, there are no page load speed issues--the home page has page generation times in the 0.01 s range (or less), as expected.  If I then install and activate different plugins, one by one, the page generation time increases noticeably.  Some plugins cause it to increase more than others.  Activating Wordfence causes a ~2 second increase in page generation time.   So once I install and activate all 12 of my plugins, the page generation time jumps to the 8-10 second range.  The same is not true on my remote server.  On my remote server, if I deactivate all plugins and switch to the default 2019 theme, the page generation time for the home page drops to ~0.1 s, as expected.  If I then install Wordfence, the page generation time simply jumps to ~0.2-0.4 seconds, not the 2-3 seconds that occurs on the default VVV site.  Can you replicate that on your end?\nTo be clear, I'm not saying Wordfence itself is the culprit for the long page generation times on the VVV site.  I'm saying that installing and activating any plugin causes a noticeable jump in page generation time.  Wordfence is just a good test because on my end, it seems to cause a large, and easily identified jump.\nFYI I just now am seeing your new reply about the performance tester plugin.  I can give that shot on my dev site soon.  It may have to wait until tomorrow though.\n. > I don't think the chrome inspector tools view of TTFB, or any client side metrics are particularly helpful, I'd focus exclusively on server side metrics.\nRight O.

The extra work plugins do isn't free afterall :)\n\nI'd also note that you should not expect 2 different systems to perform the same. VVV and SiteGround will never have the same performance in all areas. Even 2 VVV instances will never have the same performance. My SSD and memory may be faster than yours, you might have a newer computer. My internet might be running over fibre and yours over copper.\n\nI'm not expecting the two systems to perform the same.  But if the site on the remote server outperforms the VVV site, why would I continue to use VVV? Please don't take this as an attack or harsh criticism.  But here is the reality from my point of view.  I used to develop new sites on VVV because it was fast--back end and front end pages loaded much faster compared to any remote web server.  But in this case, simply after adding a few plugins, the VVV site has become significantly slower than the same site on the remote web server.  So in this case, what's the benefit to me of using VVV?  There is, in fact, a large penalty for using VVV.\n\nBut until you identify the performance bottleneck, which you still haven't done, this is all speculation. Telling me performance is slow is unhelpful. Telling me database queries are slow on the other hand, or that file system access is slow, etc is super helpful.\n\nI would personally love to troubleshoot this with you, if you think this is an issue that can be resolved. \n But I would admittedly need some guidance on your end.  For example, on my VVV site, on this particular page load (screenshot, Query Monitor is reporting a Page Generation Time of 8.7 s.  Only 0.01 s of that was from Database Query Time.  Another 2.6 s was from HTTP API calls.  How can I determine the duration of other tasks?  You mentioned time spent in hooks--how can I see that in QM?  There is a \"Hooks & Actions\" section, but that doesn't appear to show the time (screenshot).\nIf you don't think this is an issue worth pursuing, or if you believe this to be expected behavior--no problem, I understand.  I'd just have to cease using VVV in favor of building directly on my web server.   That's not a threat, nor is it said out of spite, nor is it trying to force your hand.  I think in reality, if others are experiencing similar issues, I'd expect them to make a similar decision.  Who knows though, this could just be an issue with my machine only.\nI am indeed using an SSD drive on my local computer by the way.

What's curious is that Laps indicates '2 MB' for this process, regardless of how many plugins are actually activated.  Here is a screenshot with only one single, small plugin activated.  I'm not sure why that remains at 2 MB.  Separately, after activating Wordfence, the time spent on the init hook also jumps significantly.  Furthermore, after activating Wordfence, all back-end admin pages also experience a similar increase in load times.

FYI earlier in this ticket I mentioned that, when I pushed my DB from local to live, it was noticeably slower.  in the ~4-5 minute range when it is usually in the 1-2 minute range.  I made a change on my end and it seems to have resolved that issue. Specifically, when I setup my theme, it came with a lot of demo content.

I may play around with this method in the future.  Or maybe use this method so VVV creates a new WordPress site, but with a few plugins pre-installed.\n\nYou could also put a .vvv or a provision folder in your sites repo and put an appropriate set of provisioners in there.\n\nThis seems a little more complex for me, but good to know.\nWe can consider this resolved..

That seemed like a lot of host-only networks, smelt fishy.\nI went into Windows and disabled all the host-only networks and restarted Windows and it worked again. Phew! Lucky guess!\n. created a duplicate of this issue inside WP trac, https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44271, in case the issue can be solved from that end (or in case someone else experiences it and is searching for it from there). Here's a hacky workaround: \n\nCloned WordPress repo to somewhere in the guest machine that is NOT sync'd with host machine. Eg like anywhere in the vagrant user's home directory, like ~/www/wordpress-develop-repo, \ncreate a symlink from this repo's build folder to the one in srv/www, eg makedir /srv/www/wordpress-develop/public_html/build; ln -s /srv/www/wordpress-develop/public_html/build ~/www/wordpress-develop-repo/build;\nrun grunt watch --force from  ~/www/wordpress-develop-repo. --force is needed because grunt has trouble removing the entire build directory, because it's now actually a symlink. So files deleted in src will need to be manually deleted from build, but otherwise it works\n\nSo with this, the changes from ~/www/wordpress-develop-repo/src get deployed to srv/www/wordpress-develop/public_html/build. . ya theoretically you can get it to not use symbolic links, but npm install --no-bin-links didn't work for me.\nThat article I linked to said\n\nAlthough you're supposed to be able to disable these with --no-bin-links, it doesn't catch all of the symlinks being generated.. oh and in order for npm install -g {package-name} to work, I needed to also allow symlinks in /srv/config too, because that's also sync'd and the node global packages are in /srv/config/nvm/versions/node/{node-version}/.... I also moved the content of /srv/config/nvm/versions to a location that's not sync'ed (eg I could have created ~/nvm_versions) and put a symlink to it instead. ya I assume there's a reason they're disabled by default, no idea what it is. This trick isn't working for the WP core npm install though (just npm install'ing our plugin's project) so I'm not super confident this is the best fix TBH (so yes I can create a pull request, but I'm not even sure if I'd push for it's merge).

On my Core i7 machine with 8Mbs Internet connection it takes minutes to finish. It's OK with me though because I do not need to do it often. I believe adding a little tiny ZipArchive installation won't hurt anybody anyhow.\nOf course, one can edit provision file to add a ZipArchive manually. But what will happen if VVV gets updated? We'll have a merge conflict to resolve. This is not what I want to spend my time on, if it's possible to avoid.\nWhat I think would be an ideal solution is to have a custom provision file that will be loaded during a provisioning process. It can be loaded and executed by the 'main' provision.sh script. This way when provision.sh will be updated, it will not affect our custom provision file at all. I believe this is a win-win situation.\nDo you know if such thing can be done currently? There is nothing about it in documentation, I believe.\nI would be happy to contribute to documentation (although my current time resources are very limited), but I just think editing provision.sh is wrong.

    "brianjking": "@jeremyfelt Yes, I agree. Something certainly should be done to enhance and streamline the documentation. \nI suggest using MkDocs or Sphinx. I'd be happy to help out in any way that I can. I'm very familiar with both of the tools below.\n- https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs\n- https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx\n. @DrewAPicture I don't agree about Sphinx only really fitting for code documentation, most of what I use Sphinx for is for more prose content. (Example: http://help.duelingdogs.net/en/latest/)\n. @DrewAPicture The other benefit of Sphinx over MkDocs is if we hosted the built documentation on ReadTheDocs is the production of PDF/EPUB for offline access to the documentation for those that may benefit from this. \nUnfortunately, despite MkDocs being able to be built/served from ReadTheDocs it doesn't feature the PDF build/output options as part of Sphinx.\n. @DrewAPicture Regardless, VVV needs better documentation and I'm happy to help in whatever way I can. What is the next step?\n@jeremyfelt -- Input?\n. I think VVV could also benefit from a Discourse site, lots of good info can be gathered and then transferred into official docs that could assist many users.

As a newbie, I chose netbeans, and it seems to work.  However, the xdebug config seems a bit of a pig in general.  see https://github.com/YellaUmbrella-tv/VVV for 3 commits i made today on top of VVV develop which i hope will help me.\nBasically, I found it difficult to change the xdebug max_execution_time, so wrote a script to copy the relevant .ini files from the local config folders into the right place in the VM; this enables you to play more easily with configs on the fly.... just open an ssh, and run 'copyxdebug' after a change to xdebug.ini or php-custom.ini.\nI'm not confident enough to issue a pull request; as I'm so new to vagrant (and WP dev in general); so i'm not sure if there is already a way to do this easily (vagrant provision does it, but it takes some time to achieve a very simple operation....).\n. @cfoellmann :) still not got my head around github; can't find the PR anywhere....  I've been working with the results today (win 10 host), and so far, so good.  No timeouts, no ngnix errors;  just a couple of times when netbeans needed to be closed and re-opened in order to launch a browser (seems like if you don't hit stop on the debug session, it gets in a twist). All seems good. \n@mikromakro - netbeans is treating me well so far....\n. ahh! no i completely miss-understood your first comment!  I thought you HAD opened a PR; but you're asking me to...  ok, no problem, will do.\n. done\n. hmm... not sure exactly (some time since i did this).  Looks like i was having issues with accessing the website just from a browser without a debugger started, and turned this off to make it work (maybe just more quickly?).  I'm using netbeans; from the comment in xdebug.ini, if the debug env sends (i think it's in the query string) something specific, then xdebug is turned on anyway. - may not be applicable to all debug environments?.

I guess maybe I have to run provision again now or something?\n\nStill cannot connect to http://127.0.0.1:1080 or http://vvv.dev:1080, even after running vagrant up --provision.\nI didn't get the errors related to Mailcatcher, but I did get this:\n==> default: sh: 1: \n==> default: /usr/local/rvm/bin/catchmail: not found\nIs this related?\nRunningwhich catchmail reveals /usr/local/bin/catchmail.\n. For posterity: I just updated to VVV 2.0 and destroyed my box and reprovisioned. Now Mailcatcher is working for me.. I figured that it was something like that. Now I'm just wondering if there is any way to launch a non-root sub-shell? (I'll admit I'm not a shell genius.) Short of that, I guess maybe VVV shouldn't just silence the error, even though it is expected, so that people know that this issue exists and can make their own assessment.\n. I think that you just needed to include the WordPress-specific configuration file in local.wp.examplesite.fr.conf, like this:\n```\nserver {\n    listen       80;\n    listen       443 ssl;\nserver_name local.wp.examplesite.fr\n\nroot         /srv/www/examplesite/www;\n\ninclude /etc/nginx/nginx-wp-common.conf;\n\n}\n```\nNote the last line: include /etc/nginx/nginx-wp-common.conf;.\n. To find the executable file, ssh into VVV, and then run which phpcs:\n``` bash\n$ vagrant ssh\n[...]\nvagrant@vvv:~$ which phpcs\n/srv/www/phpcs/scripts//phpcs\n```\nAs you can see, it gave me /srv/www/phpcs/scripts//phpcs. which is a very useful tool for locating executables in your path. :-)\nEdit: or you can simply run vagrant ssh -c \"which phpcs\".\n.

I got the exact same error with this command. I've been using vagrant for around 6 months and this time it has totally crashed, more than 24 hours of trying to debug but nothing works properly.. I forgot to update, the vagrant --provision worked fine after I restarted the VirtualBox.. Update : So, I logged in to my VM and installed the mysql service : sudo apt-get install mysql-server\nbut then it showed the error \"nginx: unrecognized service\" then I installed the nginx and then again I got the error : bash: vagrant_up: command not found.

I have tested 5 computers now and it is definitely no issues. . i totally forgot about git pull haha, i keep deleting the develop and re-cloning it lol haah. this is what i get, but i am using the latest box \nubuntu/trusty64 (virtualbox, 20180509.0.0)\n```\nWelcome to Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.13.0-147-generic x86_64)\n\nDocumentation:  https://help.ubuntu.com/\n\nSystem information as of Tue May 15 03:26:39 UTC 2018\nSystem load:  0.39              Processes:           106\n  Usage of /:   6.0% of 39.34GB   Users logged in:     0\n  Memory usage: 13%               IP address for eth0: 10.0.2.15\n  Swap usage:   0%                IP address for eth1: 192.168.50.4\nGraph this data and manage this system at:\n    https://landscape.canonical.com/\nGet cloud support with Ubuntu Advantage Cloud Guest:\n    http://www.ubuntu.com/business/services/cloud\nNew release '16.04.4 LTS' available.\nRun 'do-release-upgrade' to upgrade to it.\n```. @eno812 \nYou will need to uninstall the vagrant-trigger since Vagrant 2.1 or higher has a core that has a trigger already. \nIf you have Vagrant 2.1 or higher, u will need to use VVV 2.2.1 and Vagrant 2.1 uses core trigger so you will need to uninstall the plugin version. . you will need to still install vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater\nand yes, u will need VVV 2.2.1 and Vagrant 2.1 or higher\nPlease use this: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/archive/2ad59db8af1e1c089b40eadee4f214e7941bb100.zip i think the latest one seems to have problems still from what i can tell, . I'm just confirming if the latest develop branch has issue, I was having issues for some reason after i killed the virtual machine, but I'll let you know \nmaybe i'm to tired thinkin of it haha . @eno812 \nafter the merge of #1512, everything is fine now, so doing a kill vm and doing a fresh provision seems to be flawless. . @tomjn \nhey man, no problem, seems like everything works, on Windows, Mac, and of course I also tested Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, i haven't test 18.04 LTS yet. but eventually I will be getting that sooner or later. \n. @eno812 \nWhen you get that, you will need to open the software virtualbox and u should see that information, then u need to right click and delete and delete all files.\nThen do a vagrant up --provision . I have confirmed, when u clone the latest develop branch #1508 merged,  it doesn't seem to install the necessary components, software,  and custom sites and gives u a lot of no directory found and doesn't seem to install the necessary stuff that usually takes like 40 minutes to complete. \nI download the #1505 commit version  since i can't clone it since that takes the latest develop branch, but when i use #1505 version, everything is fine.. so i ahve confirmed 5 times just to make sure, a new clone from the latest develop branch for #1508  and here's a file that it was having issues,\nsee attach\n#1508 merge.txt\n. Please note that, this seems to been fixed upon the latest commit of #1512, assuming that #1507 was the cause of the fresh provision. \nWill confirmed in an hour once the process is complete. So far, its doing what is needed... @tomjn \nSo after confirming, #1512 seems to fixed the fresh provision when destroying the virtual machine and vagrant up --provision. so assuming the #1507 may have cause the issue. \nI pretty much tested on 3 different computers and it seems now when using #1512 commit version of VVV has no issues\n. Please use the latest develop #1512  this fixed the problem you are having \nMake sure that you are using vagrant 2.1 or higher and the trigger is in core so don\u2019t use the trigger plugin . @guyromellemagayano \nSorry for the late response, i guess time difference, yea, if you told us that  you were using vv, i would strongly advise not to use vv when VVV 2.0 came out. it works very well in VVV.1.8.4ish, after that, vv didn't work to well and plus, since VVV 2.0, it does almost the same thing as vv \n. yup, i stop using it when VVV 2.0 came out and creating new sites easier enough to do. :) . @tomjn \nI'm currently testing this pull request, what am i looking for that solves the permissions problem. I am about to finished building the environment. \n. so i did a clean fresh install using the tomjn-nginx-permissions,  after it finished, I'm getting one of the site as a 403 forbidden and the other one WordPress setup so it didn't complete the 5 minute install automatically. \nI'l try again, but i just wanna let you guys know what i just found. so i try again and it seems to be fine, weird, just could be my testing environment. but again, seems fine. but as  FYI,\ncopy vvv-config.yml to vvv-custom.yml and leave it as it is and vagrant up --provision output is different from if I were to edit vvv-custom.yml and remove the default sites and create my own sites.\noutputting results aren't the same. not sure if this is intented but at the end, it did created  what is needed. . @tomjn \nIf that's the case, then, everything seems to good to go, unless we get more people to test too. . @tomjn \nyeah but after looking at the learn more, am i supposed to get that approve | dismissed.. see attach.\n\n. too awesome, works like a charm. . what exactly is the CD USB Generator. i need to asked that before i Test too.. @Mte90 \nyeah, the coding standard that's been installed inside of VVV. The theme sniffer for WPTRT gets an PHP Deprecated thing that kind of related to PHP 7.2 so yeah. . @Mte90 \nthat's what they are telling me, but i'm not sure if they merge that ticket yet. if you have an existing ssl certificate from before, I think its possible that you will need to delete that before you install the newest version of the ssl. i mean that's what i've been doing lately. . @circuuz \ndid u ever get this to work without the --provision-width and use just vagrant up --provision or vagrant provision. @tomjn \nShould we closed this since, if no response from the user that  create this ticket, I'm going to assume that is fixed. \n. am i imagining this, i thought that edge worked before... if it didn't, no one actually tested Edge?\nnow i really wanna go back to the previous state and test the older VVV 2.2.0. i did more test on this... because I usually install windows 10 on virtualbox and target 192.168.50.4/192.168.50.1 as a second adapter... It seems like if I were to install the SSL or non SSL and using Microsoft Edge, I can actually use it. \nsee below\n\nso it got me curious. what's the difference. . i did more test on this... because I usually install windows 10 on virtualbox and target 192.168.50.4/192.168.50.1 as a second adapter... It seems like if I were to install the SSL or non SSL and using Microsoft Edge, I can actually use it. \nsee below\n\nso it got me curious. what's the difference. . so the image above is under VirtualBox running Windows 10 Pro and i didn't need to edit registry or anything like that, it just works under virtualbox windows 10, but the actual host. i just get, can't reach the page. . so the image above is under VirtualBox running Windows 10 Pro and i didn't need to edit registry or anything like that, it just works under virtualbox windows 10, but the actual host. i just get, can't reach the page. . \ngive  u better idea, now it says im using windows 10 Pro (Running) - Oracle VM VirtualBox . \ngive  u better idea, now it says im using windows 10 Pro (Running) - Oracle VM VirtualBox . @tomjn \nAny idea why would this happened, if i use virtualbox with windows 10, Microsoft Edge works, but if i use Edge at the parent/host operating system, it doesn't work. . @Mte90 and @tomjn \nWas this issue fixed in one of the tickets. It seems like is working at the moment, but currently using the latest merge #1530. and did not have any issues with it when i have it as followed\nC:\\WordPress\\develop. cool, let me test this out before i close this ticket. \nthanks. man having two accounts is just bleh.. keep forgetting this, using the wrong account lol . closing ticket, that private_ip_address works. just out of curiosity, when building a box, would it be a good idea to use .vhd rather than .vdi so other platform like hyper-v can use.. same box, different vm software. \njust thinking outside of the box. . ahhhh that's interesting, never thought about that... . I actually wanted to ask, is this pull request will be added as a VVV 2.2 or will this be added as part of VVV 3.0 . ahh, i didn't see that marked for 2.3 milestone, . I'll do the testing shortly and I'm currently downloadin the box right now and I'll give u guys a shout after I'm done. \nhas anyone test VVV for Ubuntu Platform . i have just tested and it seems to work fine using this new ubuntu 14.04 box.  \ud83d\udc4d on Windows Platform.. what you will need to do is for the hosts file in Windows 10, u need it to have full permission to be able to write it. \nC:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\nthen right click on hosts file and go to properties and select Security, highlight Users and click on Edit and give full permission.\n\ndo a vagrant up --provision, rather than just vagrant up\nvagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater must be installed as well or else you will need to modify the hosts file manually. yeah that's one way, but for me, i tend to forget to run it as administrator, so i just give permission to users.. when you vagrant up, did u go to vvv.test and click on phpmyadmin on the right side. . i have the same thing that you are describing and my works fine. those files are the defaults.. i actually tested this 30 minutes ago as well and it works without issues.. if you need the latest develop, the best way is to use git pull if you clone the repository,. make sure that you are using virtualbox 5.2+ and vagrant 2.1+, the virtualbox virtual adapter should automatically create when you vagrant up and the IP for that adapter is 192.168.50.1, but the actual box is 192.168.50.4. \nAlso, as for me, I would recommend going to the hosts file and set full permission to users for the hosts file so you won't have to worried about the permission when you vagrant up, but that's just me, but its totally up to u. . which program are you using for antivirus or fire wall.  for the record, using the default Windows 10 antivirus program I think its called Windows Defender, works very well and it doesn't need configurations for virtualbox and vvv to work.. I think the best way is to disable Kaspersky for like an hour or something and test to see if that causes the problem. . I'm in the process of testing this now. . looks good.. so afterwards,  i did another vagrant up just to see what happens. and this is another result\nBringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox'

Please read the output to determine what\nwent wrong.. vagrant destroy also does this too.. apparently after i destroy the vm, im stuck, i might have to use an older version of develop or master for now. . i think we change it too fast and realize stuff happened. if we do get the vvv-base again, I'll do full testing before we actually merge it . nevermind. . if we can get hyperv to work, assuming that @LoreleiAurora is working on it. I am happy to test it on Windows 10 Hyper-V. . @tomjn \nApparently it did work, now i've been trying to figure it out. right now. i can't mount the shared folders, and  it's giving me a username and password to mount i think. \nmout.txt\n. @tomjn \ni actually did run git bash (git-scm.com) as administrator, but, it still asks me for the username and password no matter what, but if i run vagrant up again, it skips the mounting and continues to finished the process, but the shared folders can't access.  \nif i duplicated this again, i needed to destroy the vm and vagrant up and it will asked me for the same username and password. \nI think it just be the box itself or some kind of configurations that is needed. . hmm i have parallel for Mac too, but i think its an older version tho. but i can't find that license key sigh. . I may try parallel for mac soon too.. WIndows has a strict policy of keeping stuff with permissions, the sharing part is what I have problems with, I can't figure out what username and password is it for. you can try your windows 10 username and password. \nIs it really easy to create your own box. i really wanna learn too. . @tannerchung \nyeah,  when is about to mount the shared folder, it tells you to enter an username and  a password.. @tomjn and @LoreleiAurora \nDoes this need more testing. I apparently ditched Windows and went on using Ubuntu and MacBook, but I do have a Surface Pro 4 as of right now to test hyper-v. vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater as well\nI also like to go to the hosts file and change the user permission to full permission, so i don't have to worried bout permission when the plugin from vagrant auto writes to it.. can you switch to the develop branch and try again. it looks like you pretty much install the same thing i did on my Windows and my system works fine.\n\nVagrant 2.1.4\nVirtualbox 5.2.18\ninstall vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater.\n\ncan you also verify if your hosts file have the permission to be written.  right click on the hosts file and go to properties, and go to security and click on users and edit permission and all full permission. \nThis should solved your problem.. yup, we have already handled that . a custom site should be something similar to as\nyoursite:\n    repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template.git\n    hosts:\n      - yoursite.test\nnormally for me @brunoameba, i usually do delete the src/build one cuz i will never use it, so i create my own custom-site-template for individual sites. \n. Hello\nDid you update the hosts file automatically by using the plugin vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater or manually edited the hosts file? . i think you might wanna try vagrant 2.1.2 instead of vagrant 2.1.3, i just saw a difference when it tries to edit the hosts file, is definitely not the same. . @tomjn \nHey just a quick FYI.. vagrant 2.1.3 just got released and It seems like this version doesn't like hosts file it won't completely write the host file, just half for example\n192.168.50.4  vvv  #xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nand it didn't add the .test and new sites. \nbut I also went back to 2.1.2 and it works and added the stuff properly. just in case if someone is using vagrant 2.1.3 . vagrant 2.1.4 is out, maybe try that @PinballWizzrobe . yup, I just tested vagrant 2.1.4 without any issues. @PinballWizzrobe if you can, if you have time to upgrade to vagrant 2.1.4 and try it again if that solves your problem. . @davidrhoderick \nwe had a ticket open is now closed, same situation, please update to Vagrant 2.1.4 or downgrade to Vagrant 2.1.2 \nduplicate of #1626 and #1627 \n. ha i wish, let me try something neat\n\n. i don't think so. my vvv is under /home/benlumi007/WordPress, same with my macbook, /User/benlumia007/WordPress. \nIn Ubuntu, I use Peek,  and for Windows/mac is live cap.\nIs not a big deal, i just wondered why my is like that.. so far 2 of my ubuntu worksttion is the same and my macbook. ... \nmaybe,  where do u put your vvv local at. maybe is that problem. . Mac\nSorry, wrong link, this is the correct one for the gif thing: https://www.cockos.com/licecap/\n. so i tested on my Windows Platform, and the VVV files are at\nC:\\WordPress\nsame situation, but again, its not a big deal, as long as it completes the installation. . @tomjn \nYUP, not sure if that fixed it, but i no longer getting that \nThanks.

vagrant 2.2.2 isn't compatible yet if you do a clean install, but doing vagrant up without destroying the box seems fine. . closing ticket. seems it works after doing a vagrant destroy and removing files and cloning the repo again. . wp plugin install query-monitor --activate would do it during the vvv-init.sh install. . i actually figured how when you have fields in yaml that you want to add, after you add those fields,  the provision will use shyaml to get the value of the new custom field and use that to create or install a plugin. . cat vvv-custom.yml | shyaml get-value sites.custom\nsomething like that. . maybe just extend it so it grabs custom -> plugin-dev. is query monitor the only one we need for now before i continue a pull request . i was going to suggest \ncustom:\n    wp_type: subdirectory\n    wp_version: 4.6.4\n   wp_plugin: true\nI was thinking wp_plugin if it is set is true, then we can install query monitor, if we need more then all we just need to do just add each plugin and activate. \nwould this make more sense. . im just throwing ideas here, instead of putting a custom field just for query monitor and since this is going to be a permanent plugin that will be install, would it be easier just to add \nnoroot wp plugin install query-monitor --activate under the installation of wordpress in custom-site-template \nit would just go underneath\nnoroot wp core ${INSTALL_COMMAND} --url=\"${DOMAIN}\" --quiet --title=\"${SITE_TITLE}\" --admin_name=admin --admin_email=\"admin@local.test\" --admin_password=\"password\". @zackphilipps

But, it took two attempts to get the vagrant provision to go through. Had to wipe everything and re-clone the repo to try again.. There are a lot of errors in my php7.0_errors.log in the log directory, but I did not see a provision error log inside the log directory. I believe the php7 errors are from a site I imported once I got it to get past the phpcs error somehow, generated the default and develop directories, set the hostsfile, and finally load in the browser.\nWhere should I look for the provision log file?\n\nJim . My issue just hung on the line that says installing php-cs when doing the first vagrant up. I don't have the log for you, but I can tell you why I think it had a problem. \n\nI had manually installed php-cs for PhpStorm before trying out vvv 2.0. Because of this I feel the first vagrant up hung because it saw I had already created the php-cs folder in /var folder with custom profiles for WordPress with a custom ruleset. \nIf the vagrant up could just check for folder and skip if found then it would avoid this hangup. \n\nJim . \n",

    "davecpage": "@LoreleiAurora I've rewritten the line to be more generic but restricted to 4 levels deep. Have checked locally using WordPress/meta-environment and it still picks up the vvv-hosts files but is still much faster in provisioning, vagrant ssh etc.. Looking into it a bit more, the vvv-hosts code within Vagrantfile only looks within the www root hierarchy whereas the docs state that with custom paths the site local_dir path could be anywhere. With a custom local_dir the vvv-hosts file would only be used within provision-site.sh so any custom hosts would have to be duplicated in vvv-custom.yml otherwise nothing would be added to the hosts file on the hosts machine. At least that's how i'm reading it.\nAs the docs state that using vvv-custom.yml is the recommendation for setting hosts and a vvv-hosts file is only for backwards compatibility would a better solution be to see if hosts have been set in vvv-custom.yml and if not only then to look within that sites' local_dir to find a vvv-hosts file?\n. How about this? Covers point 1. Priority is hosts defined in vvv-custom.yml then on each site checks within the local_dir 4 directories deep for any vvv-hosts files to add those hosts.\nLooking to add point 2 next.. Have made that change, getting used to using Ruby so didn't realise that that was possible.. ",

Hey Tom, \nAnother thing I noticed is that when I vagrant up, I need to press Enter three times when I get the password prompt to get away from it.\nvagrant ssh doesn't ask for a password though.\nFinally, I'm getting this \n\n-f was unexpected at this time.\n\nwhen I do vagrant up, vagrant halt or vagrant status. When I do vagrant --version I don't get it.\nI forgot to say that I'm using the latest develop. Should I switch to master?\nEdit\nWhen I'm doing vagrant halt, if I don't use the correct password, the databases don't seem to get backed up.. I concluded that this has to do with the installed version of Vagrant because the issue doesn't occur with Vagrant 2.0.1.\nOnce I install Vagrant 2.0.2, the issue is there again.. For each of my tries, I was creating a new VM by doing vagrant destroy and vagrant up, so no need to provision I guess.. I confirm that with Vagrant 2.0.4, the issue is no longer reproducible.\nThanks @exlame . ",

The docs have already been 'moved' (actually copied), so having the old copy of them still in place is misleading and wrong: deleting the directory is a bug fix. The other suggestions above (add notes, sparse checkout) are enhancements which should already and separately be done as direct consequences of the 'move' (copying) -- regardless if the old directory is deleted or not yet -- and so should not be blocking the deletion.

Despite running destroy, unintalling, using the Virtualbox GUI, etc, files were left behind from previous installations. I manually removed everything I could find on my machine pertaining to Vagrant and Virtualbox, and a fresh install did the trick.\nMy concern here, is that this wasn't a very old install - I reformatted my machine roughly 5 months ago, which means this software was somewhat up to date (and I did update as updates came out). This much garbage being left behind caused tremendous issues, such that someone not completely well-informed with this technology spent hours upon hours trying to debug what is supposed to be simple, straightforward software, that takes the challenge out of a local web environment. I had errors ranging from vb-guest (or whichever plugin is used to install triggers and hosts-updater) not being installed, to a box already existing, to restarting my computer not working due to a Virtuabox connection still existing.\nI absolutely love this software, but given my experience, I think some more testing would benefit the smoothness of the experience. Uninstalling the software should completely remove all of these files (if desired), and perhaps a separate, open-source tool could exist to locate and remove lingering files. I'm not too sure on a solution, but I'm certain I didn't venture into tasks that were advanced, or out of the basic scope of creating an environment, and 2 sites.\nAll in all, it's working again, and I hope my input helps someone device some future testing, planning, and bug hunting.

Yep I was expecting to have all the npm and grunt tasks fully working outside of the VM, since the VVV built with the CD-USB script is meant to be used at contributor days and I think beginners are not so familiar with ssh'ing into the VM and running stuff from there.\nThanks for your explanation. After our conversation on Slack I realize that, on the other hand, in order to run things outside of the VM, the attendees should likely install additional software (node, phpunit) outside of the VM so that's not ideal during a contributor day.\nAside: if the vvv.zip generated by https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/CD-USB-Generator/  is meant to be a fully-functional ready to use VVV, then the default memory for the VM should be increased as 1024 is definitely not sufficient to run the tests.. @tomjn that's what I've done when testing the VVV prepared for the Milano contributor day\nvm_config:\n  memory: 2048\nMy point is that everything should work out of the box during a contributor day, will open a new issue \ud83d\ude42 . > What's the error message it gives under details\nIt's the very enlightening INET_E_RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND.\nAs said, this isn't a Virtualbox / Vagrant / VVV issue.

I just picked a month or so of difference, cause I did a provision just around that time.\nThe script is installing everything right now, unfortunately I was not able to solve the problem with the most up to date version.\nI really appreciate your help, if I can help out providing more information so this problem is solved in the future, I'll be glad to do so, otherwise, should I close this issue? . @tomjn The latest one didn't work for me: d110ab0c798d0b3fc70122b9ecbd98f92a75315f as well as the PR suggested: #1568\nI'll try to see in my old laptop from which commit the problem starts.\nNo, the network connection didn't fail in my provision log with 80790558bcc32ebd67af5d3c4012130a28f47c38. Hi @tomjn ,\nI'll be happy to report on this one. Can you please wait until the end of this week? I left my other laptop elsewhere.\nThanks for the work here.. ",

Am I missing something? I can't find a \"automattic/vipwpcs\": \"dev-master\" composer package anywhere.. @jayhill90 yep, tried it. Didn't work.. So, for me, the git clone --mirror of the vip coding standards repo is requiring credentials.. Changing the type from 'vcs' to 'github' fixed the problem for me.. So I couldn't seem to repeat my success outside that initial attempt. After trying anything I could dig up adding \"no-api\": true to the composer.json seems to give me consistent results. (I emphasize \"seems\" here.) So the composer.json file in the phpcs folder would have an extra line like this:\n{\n            \"type\": \"github\",\n            \"url\": \"https://github.com/Automattic/VIP-Coding-Standards.git\",\n            \"no-api\": true\n        }. Sure.. Sure.. ",
    "AramZS": "So for the sake of reference, I used the processes documented at, which generated certs successfully and I placed the path to the generated certs in each case in vvv-nginx.conf though I didn't try anything in regard to the provision folder, I generated it in the running machine, accessed via vagrant ssh:\n- https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/wiki/Site-specific-self-signed-SSL-certificates\n- https://zerossl.com/free-ssl/#self\n- https://github.com/loganstellway/self-signed-ssl\nThe fourth process I attempted didn't even generate a cert so it's not worth mentioning the details of. \nI took down and up the machine in each case and got the same results. \nThe idea of using .test definitely sounds like part of the solution, but I vagrant destroyed both the old machine and the new machine, wiped out the old version's files, pulled down the latest instance of VVV, and built it from scratch, the machines continue to redirect to .dev versions of the domain in both Chrome and Opera (though I guess it doesn't in Firefox oddly). Something seems to be occurring pushing these browsers to direct to dev? VVV.local seems to work though. Perhaps this is because I hit the WordPress setup at local.wordpress.dev and so mapped that domain to the WordPress database? It might make sense to force new versions to redirect to .test versions of the site to avoid this? . Yeah, I vagrant destroyed then chucked the entire VVV folder into the trash, pulled down a clean version from git and started from scratch. I've done it a second time to see if the problem persists if I start with WordPress on .local. \nAnyway we could add a notice to the wiki? I understand the need to leave it in for legacy reasons, but it beats out the VVV website in search results pretty consistently.. Sorry, I meant .test there. Ok, I can confirm that a clean install, going to the .test domain succeeds in a properly set up site. For those who work off of unclear documentation by accident, can we attempt to assure that the .dev domain is always redirected to .test? \nAlso, if I can build a proper SSL cert in my system, and get the configuration running, is there any reason I couldn't just commit it within the site folder? If it works with an sh script should I be setting that up in the provision folder. I'd be glad to contribute back a working process, once I get it working. What would be the best approach, docs, a cert committed into the repo, or a script to execute as part of the provisioning process? . So I've run into an issue. There is a chunk in provision.sh that rewrites the key on every provision and sets it as the base level key in the nginx files, overwriting configurations that occur at site level vvv-nginx.conf files. It looks like:\n# Create an SSL key and certificate for HTTPS support.\n  if [[ ! -e /etc/nginx/server-2.1.0.key ]]; then\n      echo \"Generate Nginx server private key...\"\n      vvvgenrsa=\"$(openssl genrsa -out /etc/nginx/server-2.1.0.key 2048 2>&1)\"\n      echo \"$vvvgenrsa\"\n  fi\n  if [[ ! -e /etc/nginx/server-2.1.0.crt ]]; then\n      echo \"Sign the certificate using the above private key...\"\n      vvvsigncert=\"$(openssl req -new -x509 \\\n            -key /etc/nginx/server-2.1.0.key \\\n            -out /etc/nginx/server-2.1.0.crt \\\n            -days 3650 \\\n            -subj /CN=*.wordpress-develop.test/CN=*.wordpress.test/CN=*.wordpress-develop.dev/CN=*.wordpress.dev/CN=*.vvv.dev/CN=*.vvv.local/CN=*.vvv.localhost/CN=*.vvv.test 2>&1)\"\n      echo \"$vvvsigncert\"\n  fi\nWhat is the best way to remove, amend, or allow site-level overrides of this directive? . Ok... weird but true, activating this plugin - https://wordpress.org/plugins/really-simple-ssl/ seems to have fixed the above issue. \nIf I follow the instructions at https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/wiki/Site-specific-self-signed-SSL-certificates (with a modification of where the ssl folder lives, it should be one step up from the directory the conf file is in) and then install that plugin on the .test. sites it seems to be working. . (Also it looks like restarting nginx isn't enough. A full vagrant provision is needed.). ",

Also added tls-ca and trusted-hosts under the core utilities.\nI followed all these steps below and even makes my Win 10 accepted the certificate.\n\nIf you're using the wordpress-develop or custom site templates, visit your site and switch to https. The first time you visit it will complain, but you should be able to skip.\nOnce reprovisioned, you can also go to certificates/ca/cert.crt. Add this to your keychain on MacOS/Accept the certificate as an authority in Windows/etc, and restart your browser. Now all VVV sites using the custom site template support https, with no warnings\n\nHowever, I ran into this weird problem that every custom site seems to be looking at the same vvv.test cert, instead of their own DNS name cert. I've attached two images below to showcase, https://vvv.test runs fine, whereas https://local.wordpress.test/ runs into a SSL problem. I tried to edit some vvv-nginx.conf file to force a change without success. Please offer a hand to help me get this SSL problem over with. I've been stuck here for a couple of days. THANK YOU!!\n\n\n. @tomjn OK, i've managed to put a \"fix\" on my custom site. Here's what i did below:\nI figured it has to be a vvv-nginx.conf problem under the {VVV_PATH_TO_SITE}/provision/ folder, since that file doesn't have any SSL info after adding the tls-ca and trusted-host in vvv-custom.yml\nWhat I did was commenting out the else statement below in the vvv-init.sh in the same folder.\n\nif [ -n \"$(type -t is_utility_installed)\" ] && [ \"$(type -t is_utility_installed)\" = function ] && is_utility_installed core tls-ca; then\n    sed -i \"s#{{TLS_CERT}}#ssl_certificate /vagrant-local/certificates/${VVV_SITE_NAME}/dev.crt;#\" \"${VVV_PATH_TO_SITE}/provision/vvv-nginx.conf\"\n    sed -i \"s#{{TLS_KEY}}#ssl_certificate_key /vagrant-local/certificates/${VVV_SITE_NAME}/dev.key;#\" \"${VVV_PATH_TO_SITE}/provision/vvv-nginx.conf\"\n\nelse\n#sed -i \"s#{{TLS_CERT}}##\" \"${VVV_PATH_TO_SITE}/provision/vvv-nginx.conf\"\n#sed -i \"s#{{TLS_KEY}}##\" \"${VVV_PATH_TO_SITE}/provision/vvv-nginx.conf\"\n\nfi\nthen I hardcoded the ssl_certificate     /vagrant/certificates/example/dev.crt; and \n    ssl_certificate_key /vagrant/certificates/example/dev.key; into the vvv-nginx.conf.tmpl, Re-provision, then boom. There's https on my custom site. But this Band-Aid fix has to do manually on each and every site the vagrant has. \nI hope my finding could help you fix the whole https problem I faced and thanks for creating such a great tool. Thank You!!. ",
    "AlfredJKwack": "Thanks for the quick response. \nI get the general idea. Could you clarify where I should expect the vvv-provision.sh file to be located? Where under ~/VVV/... would this be. \n. Thanks.. Yes it has. \nI've given up and rebuilt from scratch. It seems to be working for now.. ",

I'm now getting a 500 internal server error on http://syracusesedationandfamilydentistry.test/, dunno if it's related.

So that's obviously the source of these errors.\nSo I reprovisioned. Everything is running correctly, and just like you said. Here's a gist of the provision:\nhttps://gist.github.com/broskees/8fc18c75da902d739a46d96d1330cb33\nI'm still trying to figure out why however it gets stuck on triggers.

It is not functionality we need with this project and this issue has been blocking me for some time now. Would really appreciate any pointers - am relatively new to this so may have overlooked something simple.. Thanks so much for the very quick reply :) \nDo you have a link to that PR with details on what to add to provisioner.sh and I will add that?\nI had assumed that the mailcatcher error was why it was not provisioning for me.. \nWhen I go to http://local.wordpress.test/ I can see that site but I cannot see my custom site - I just get the page with this error: \"Problem: Could not load the site, this implies that provisioning the site failed, please check there were no errors during provisioning, and reprovision.\"\nI've checked my hosts file and it has been added in their correctly. I actually have another installation of Vagrant on my machine - could that be causing any issues? I wanted to set this project up in a fresh install so I could test it as there is going to be a group of volunteers working on this project on Wednesday.. The only other issue I have seen after running vagrant up is to do with composer:\nDo not run Composer as root/super user! See https://getcomposer.org/root for details\n    default: Installing phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin (4.8.1)\n    default:   - Installing phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin (4.8.1): \n    default: Loading from cache\n    default: Created project in .\n    default: Loading composer repositories with package information\n    default: Installing dependencies from lock file\n    default: Warning: The lock file is not up to date with the latest changes in composer.json. You may be getting outdated dependencies. Run update to update them.\nHowever I have seen this in my other installation which works so am assuming this is not preventing provisioning.\nThanks again for the speedy reply - I am keen to get this set up as soon as I can.\n. Thank you so much - I have submitted this as a separate issue :https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/1545 with the gist attached showing provision output and the vvv-custom.yml\nI have checked and only one instance of VVV is running.\n(The default site http://local.wordpress.test/ loads fine - just my custom ones don't). ok thank you for that - I was assuming the provisioning hadn't worked so hadn't read past that (although the fact that I could see the pages for the default sites meant provisioning had worked). I have been reading through the documentation but not quite there with understanding how the workflow will work\nSo for my custom (non-wordpress) site I would need to have the following:\nw4zadmin:\n    repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template.git\n    #repo: https://password@bitbucket.org/bitbucketpath/wellsforzoe_admin.git\n    description: \"Wells for Zoe admin site\"\n    skip_provisioning: false\n    hosts:\n      - w4zadmin.test\nI did have our repo there so this just gave me a number of php files for that site - which were not in a folder called public_html. And as you say no provision folder. So on this page on adding existing sites it says to use the custom site template and then just copy the existing files into it. So I would just check out the admin site elsewhere on my machine and then manually copy those files into w4zadmin/public_html? So would this need to be done each time the site is re-provisioned? Or can this repo be added in vvv-custom.yml config somehow? If I was to add it into vvv-init.sh, it would also get overwritten when re-provisioning right? Or is it recommended to add the provision folder into our wellsforzoe_admin.git repo and change the above back to pull from that repo?\nSorry for all the (basic) questions.\n. \nk that is fantastic! I have a much better understanding of it now. It looks like the folder is public_html. So I ran vagrant up with the following config:\nw4zadmin:\n    repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template.git\n    description: \"Wells for Zoe admin site\"\n    skip_provisioning: false\n    hosts:\n      - w4zadmin.test\nIt created the log, provision and public_html folders. I went into public_html and deleted all of the wordpress files it had put in there. (Is there a way to specify not to add those?) Then I cloned our git rep into that directory and can see the page now in the browser :)  (I did see from the doc on custom paths that I could have put the code elsewhere but makes sense for me to put it there seeing as this doesn't get overwritten when provisioning.\nI like the idea of forking the custom site template and adding the provision folder into our repo with any customisations we need. Moving everything else into public_html should be fine too.\nSo last question hopefully - how do I access phpmyadmin? I presume it is a manual process of exporting the data from my production db and importing it locally? (Unless we do this in vvv-init.sh I guess)\nAnd similarly for importing data into the wordpress install, I have read elsewhere that we'd need to use a plugin like All in One Migration to export it so that you can change the domain name to what it will be locally. Do you recommend this approach?\n. Thank you again for the amazingly quick responses :) I have this up and running for the admin site now. For now I am copying the site files in manually and importing the data dump through phpmyadmin. We may streamline this in the future to do that automatically through vvv-init.sh.\nThanks again for the quick replies - all done in time for our volunteer day tomorrow thanks to your help! Feel free to close this ticket.. ",

Working fine now, but PHPMyAdmin doesn't works...403 Forbidden, too. \nAny idea ? . no, I have deleted  PHPMyAdmin, update vagrant and vvv to latest one and make a provisioning. Nothing, doesn't works. \nI make a box update, too. Hi there, \nI'm waiting to find a final solution for this issue.

Will try your suggestion and let you know my findings. \ud83d\udc4d . @benlumia007 @tomjn \nI'm currently deleting my current VVV box and start - i mean provision -  all over again. Just wanted to make sure if the latest commit from develop branch fixes all the recent issues. . This was exactly my problem just few hours ago. But after the latest commit added by @LoreleiAurora in the develop branch, the problem was solved - at least in my case. I also have the following versions of the tools for the setup\n\n\nVVV version\nv2.2.1\n\n\nVVV Branch Used\ndevelop\n\n\nVagrant Version\nv2.1.1\n\n\nCurrent OS & Version\nMacOS High Sierra 10.13.4. Check this issue: #1500 . @tomjn No, I haven't used vagrant box update after i reinstalled and provisioned VVV. The first time I ssh into the VM, I also didn't update the packages via apt-get. . [UPDATE] The mailcatcher does not load when I tried to access it via http://vvv.test:1080/. I might need it in my next projects. . Will try to send a PR if I have the time to work on it. But on the other hand, what can you say about my main issue about reinstalling all my previous sites to the latest version of VVV? Is there something I missed or misconfigured or both? I can't access all my sites as of right now. . @benlumia007 As it turns out, some workarounds had to be made for a site to be created successfully on my end. \n\n\nI had installed vv by @bradp for initiating WP site creation. It added the vvv-hosts, vvv-init, wp-cli.yml in the created folder where htdocs folder is located. \n\nBefore I end the vv site creation setup, I make sure to update the vvv-custom.yml with the site and its host URL. \n\nThen after the provisioning process - for some reason, I saw the site I created in the browser. No redirect to http://vvv.test nor a 404 or 403 error from nginx. At least it works now on my end already. But I had to tap the capabilities of vv for my setup to work. . ",

I experiential found that the wordpress-develop dir is used when executing unittests and switched from developing in my mydev.test to wordpress-develop.\n1. I don't want to contribute to the core. I just want to develop plugins. Can I remove all sites other that mydev in the vvv-custom.yml?\n2. Should unittests also work with mydev.test only and no wordpress-develop? (My guess is: when using custom-site-template-develop.git instead of custom-site-template.git it should work)\nThanks for the clarification. Going to checkout the repository now and report back.\n. > All your previous notes implied you were using wordpress-develop and the WP Core dev site template.\nYes, wordpress-develop is part of the vvv-config.yml. My screenshots shows a diff, of my changes or only additions in this case. Here a gist of the complete file I wanted to omit in the first place by providing the differences only.\n\nYou can no longer run WP out of the source folder, you have to run it out of the build folder.\n\nThat's something I did not recognize. Thanks for pointing out.\n\nDo add at least 1 site though, I'm not sure how VVV will respond if zero sites are defined.\n\nLol. What would be the benefit of using VVV without sites - no I will not try this.\n\nYou don't need a WP Core dev environment to do unit tests for plugin development, standard WP install will do for that, follow all the standard PHPUnit setup instructions.\n\nThere was confusion because the popular install-wp-tests had always references to wordpress-develop paths. A quick look inside the script reveals it installs to /srv/www/wordpress-develop/public_html/src/ by default on VVV. That's why I always thought there comes some magic from wordpress-develop dir - but it's actually all externalized and downloadable by the script.\nOne site seems sufficient indeed. Just for the record:\nsites:\n  mydev:\n    repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template.git\n    skip_provisioning: false\n    hosts:\n      - mydev.test\n    custom:\n      wp_type: subdirectory\nI'm able to run my plugin unit tests without any wordpress-develop site after executing the install-wp-tests script.\nIf I understood everything properly there is no issue. But there are two misleading things:\n1. the docs say put your plugin in www/wordpress-develop/public_html/src. As plugin developer I assume I have to access src.wordpress-develop.test then. I don't even know that I have to \"compile\" WordPress just to make my changes on the plugin effective.\n2. when accessing build.wordpress-develop.test the title is src.wordpress-develop.test which tells me that I'm on the src version of WordPress but actually files are served from build. Your PR #1599 is good, because it eliminates this.\n. > I am unfamiliar with the prl_fs filesystem, and I see you've taken the unusual step of using parallels, can you elaborate?\n\nI would recommend strongly that you use a virtual box based provisioner, I'm unaware of any active testers or developers who have worked with VVV and parallels in the last 2 years, and would consider support for parallels historic rather than active. It's very likely that you would need to source the fix yourself and maintain and test support yourself\n\nThought parallels is still supported. I had performance issues years ago and switched to parallels which worked still well with VVV 2.2.1.\n\nIt is critical and essential that you do not censor logs down to a handful of lines, the entire log is a requirement in 90% of situations\n\nHere is the full log: https://gist.github.com/No3x/c4a56267395b59f8005c7e645ca62f68\n\nIt's very likely that you would need to source the fix yourself and maintain and test support yourself\n\nI really don't need to use parallels that bad.

    "user-mk": "Sure, thanks. One thing that bothers me is that php, mariadb, and all packages installed by vvv come with different licenses. VVV is MIT, so surely it can be used without questioning licensing and commercial use. But those software that come with different licenses( such as php, ubuntu, memcached) can they be used for creating and selling wordpress themes and plugins ? \nAgain the themes and plugins will be sold not packages installed by vvv..

    "Aankhen": "I wish I could take credit for that! I wanted to convert it to use a conditional test instead of piping the text through grep and sed, but my bash-fu is too weak. If you think the function would be useful elsewhere too, I\u2019ll give that another shot.. I got the bash regex working.. So the long and short of it is that golang/go has no \u2018official\u2019 releases and the tags list both is paginated and starts with a bunch of weekly tags from around 2010\u20132012. Getting the latest official version would require at least two HTTP requests to see where the weekly tags stopped, unless we hardcoded it, and that\u2019s if we had some sort of logic to parse the Link headers and ignore the weekly tags.\nThat\u2019s way beyond my skills, so what I\u2019ve tried instead is getting the latest version from the downloads page using regexes. This is brittle\u2014it parses HTML with regexes, and it assumes the first match is the most recent version\u2014but I think it\u2019s robust enough for our needs. It seems to work on my machine.\nThoughts?. > So this PR looks to be bugged at the moment, if you sudo apt-get remove golang-go or start a new VM, we get the following:\nHuh, that definitely should not be happening! golang-go should not be installed at all; it should be using the one from the tarball. Do you still see this on on a fresh VM?. Right, I understand the case where there\u2019s an existing installation; as you said, though, this shouldn\u2019t affect those installations unless they manually uninstall it. Thank you for massaging the PR into a usable form. :-). That\u2019s intriguing. Where is VVV 3 being developed?. Ah, sounds very cool.. I think it should be possible, but there\u2019s one thing about Vagrant I haven\u2019t quite got my head around yet: can the architecture vary? If not, I can always download go${LATEST_RELEASE}.linux-amd64.tar.gz.. Okay, great. Then I\u2019ll update this so it automatically downloads the latest version.. Does curl --silent \"https://api.github.com/repos/golang/go/releases/latest\" give you a 404? I can get the contributors, but not the releases, it seems.. Gotcha, thanks.\nAccording to GitHub support, the reason why the release list won\u2019t work for Go is that there are no official releases, just tags. I can\u2019t get the latest tag either, though, so I\u2019m waiting to hear from them.. ",

    "runofthemill": "Sorry for any lack of clarity!\nRe: your translation - it's not for multiple hosts in vvv-custom.yml, but using variable replacement as mentioned here in a situation where there are multiple server names, as in the following nginx example from here:\nserver {\n    listen       80;\n    server_name  example.org  www.example.org;\n    ...\n}\nIt probably would make sense for vvv_hosts to be the modified value, but most of the examples in the VVV docs seem to use vvv_site_name (as seen here (though that's the fallback) and here). I do see a function available, get_primary_host(), that might make sense, but vvv_hosts could presumably return an array, so I'm guessing that's why it isn't used in the examples.\nGiven the following vvv-nginx.conf:\n```\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    listen [::]:80;\n    server_name {vvv_site_name}.test;\n    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;\n}\nserver {\n    listen       443 ssl;\n    server_name  .{vvv_site_name}.test ~^{vvv_site_name}.test.\\d+.\\d+.\\d+.\\d+.xip.io$;\n    root         {vvv_path_to_site}/public_html;\nerror_log    {vvv_path_to_site}/log/error.log;\naccess_log   {vvv_path_to_site}/log/access.log;\n\nset          $upstream {upstream};\n\ninclude      /etc/nginx/nginx-wp-common.conf;\n\n}\n```\nWithout the /g flag, provisioning will throw an error upon service nginx restart, and the resulting config in /etc/nginx/custom-sites/vvv-auto-example-provision-0122eb6b8c3f46d14d3136d22f748442.conf will look like the following:\n```\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    listen [::]:80;\n    server_name example.test;\n    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;\n}\nserver {\n    listen       443 ssl;\n    server_name  .example.test ~^{vvv_site_name}.test.\\d+.\\d+.\\d+.\\d+.xip.io$;\n    root         /srv/www/example/public_html;\nerror_log    /srv/www/example/log/error.log;\naccess_log   /srv/www/example/log/access.log;\n\nset          $upstream php;\n\ninclude      /etc/nginx/nginx-wp-common.conf;\n\n}\n```\nAnd since nginx requires the characters \"{\" and \"}\" to be quoted inside a regular expression, the variable will not be replaced if ~^{vvv_site_name}.test\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\\.xip\\.io$ is changed to \"~^{vvv_site_name}.test\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\\.xip\\.io$\"\nLet me know if you'd still like me to open an issue with steps to reproduce!\nCheers.

However, these names can be specified using regular expressions, for example, \u201c~^www\\..+\\.example\\.org$\u201d and \u201c~^w.*\\.example\\.org$\u201d. An asterisk can match several name parts. The name \u201c*.example.org\u201d matches not only www.example.org but www.sub.example.org as well.\nA special wildcard name in the form \u201c.example.org\u201d can be used to match both the exact name \u201cexample.org\u201d and the wildcard name \u201c*.example.org\u201d.\nRegular expressions names\nThe regular expressions used by nginx are compatible with those used by the Perl programming language (PCRE). To use a regular expression, the server name must start with the tilde character:\nserver_name  ~^www\\d+\\.example\\.net$;\notherwise it will be treated as an exact name, or if the expression contains an asterisk, as a wildcard name (and most likely as an invalid one). Do not forget to set \u201c^\u201d and \u201c$\u201d anchors. They are not required syntactically, but logically. Also note that domain name dots should be escaped with a backslash. A regular expression containing the characters \u201c{\u201d and \u201c}\u201d should be quoted:\nserver_name  \"~^(?<name>\\w\\d{1,3}+)\\.example\\.net$\";\notherwise nginx will fail to start and display the error message:\ndirective \"server_name\" is not terminated by \";\" in ....

This worked for me when I specified what ssh keys to use.  I borrowed the method for doing that from Homestead.  Look for # Configure The Public Key For SSH Access and # Copy The SSH Private Keys To The Box in the homestead.rb file.. And in answer to your questions, this is a new VVV...I just started attempting to use VVV for the first time this morning...happened with both vagrant up and vagrant up --provision.  Virtualization is turned on and HyperV is off.  I already used Homestead for Laravel projects, which is what made me compare how they did things to what you were doing.  I had followed this guide in getting Homestead to work:\nhttps://medium.com/@eaimanshoshi/i-am-going-to-write-down-step-by-step-procedure-to-setup-homestead-for-laravel-5-2-17491a423aa. I added this to the Vagrantfile:\n```\nConfigure The Public Key For SSH Access\nif defined? vvv_config['authorize'] then\n  if File.exist? File.expand_path(vvv_config['authorize'])\n    config.vm.provision 'shell' do |s|\n      s.inline = \"echo $1 | grep -xq \\\"$1\\\" /home/vagrant/.ssh/authorized_keys || echo \\\"\\n$1\\\" | tee -a /home/vagrant/.ssh/authorized_keys\"\n      s.args = [File.read(File.expand_path(vvv_config['authorize']))]\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n# Copy The SSH Private Keys To The Box\n    if defined? vvv_config['keys'] then\n      if vvv_config['keys'].to_s.length.zero?\n        puts 'Check your vvv-config.yml file, you have no private key(s) specified.'\n        exit\n      end\n      vvv_config['keys'].each do |key|\n        if File.exist? File.expand_path(key)\n          config.vm.provision 'shell' do |s|\n            s.privileged = false\n            s.inline = \"echo \\\"$1\\\" > /home/vagrant/.ssh/$2 && chmod 600 /home/vagrant/.ssh/$2\"\n            s.args = [File.read(File.expand_path(key)), key.split('/').last]\n          end\n        else\n          puts 'Check your vvv-config.yml file, the path to your private key does not exist.'\n          exit\n        end\n      end\n    end\n```\nAnd added these lines to a vvv-custom.yml...\nauthorize: c:/Users/myusername/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\nkeys:\n    - c:/Users/myusername/.ssh/id_rsa. ssh-agent was installed along with OpenSSH, but I don't utilize it and the service is stopped.  I'm generally running commands at a regular cmd under my user account.  This may be a Vagrant issue...there must be some reason that the Homestead folks added that option in, and why the guide I followed for Windows had me utilize it. . I had already pulled up the gui through the VirtualBox interface, and no questions were being asked.  I'll reset things back to an original install and try again after work today.. @tomjn ...so now I can't get it to timeout!  I cloned a new fresh copy, changed it to show the gui, and it started provisioning just fine!  changing back to not showing the gui still worked.  I'm not sure what is different from yesterday...the machine hasn't been rebooted.  I did run ssh-keygen at a cmd yesterday just to make sure it worked, but I'm not sure why that would make any difference.  Anyway, hopefully my fix above will help someone where it doesn't magically start working...but for now I'm good.. ",

So far I only posted this as solution for a clean Ubuntu 18 install and something we can expand on. I haven't tried migrating yet, but I do plan to try it out in the upcoming days.\nrsync is a good idea, definitely worth a try. I would also, maybe, consider exporting via wp cli or directly with mysqldump with --routines flag to export stored procedures. And storing a backup just in case something goes wrong. That way there will always be a manual way to restore.. @tomjn , yeah, I was able to confirm the data loss. Don't think it will be a big problem to solve this issue, though.

    "zackphilipps": "@tomjn yep, I use SSH exclusively for git remotes. Here's what I get:\n```bash\nvagrant@vvv:~$ ssh -T git@bitbucket.org\nauthenticated via a deploy key.\nYou can use git or hg to connect to Bitbucket. Shell access is disabled.\nThis deploy key has read access to the following repositories:\n```\nWhere is it getting this deploy key?. TL;DR: In a bizarre turn of events, ssh-add -l listed two keys. I ran ssh-add -D to remove all identities and then ssh-add -k again and only had one. Now everything works as expected. Thanks for your help!\n\nMore details if you care\n\nI have no idea where this other key came from; it wasn't mine. I don't use GitLab, but when I ran `ssh -T git@gitlab.com` I got this:\n\n```bash\n$ ssh -T git@gitlab.com\nThe authenticity of host 'gitlab.com (35.231.145.151)' can't be established.\nECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:HbW3g8zUjNSksFbqTiUWPWg2Bq1x8xdGUrliXFzSnUw.\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes\nWarning: Permanently added 'gitlab.com,35.231.145.151' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.\nWelcome to GitLab, @Copperis!\n```\n\n@Copperis? That ain't me!\n\nYesterday, I made a LOT of changes troubleshooting this. So it's hard to tell if the rogue key was introduced yesterday or sometime before. I could've sworn that `ssh-add -L` listed one key yesterday, but the output is less discernible than `ssh-add -l` (lowercase), so I could've just overlooked the second key.\n\nAt one point I had a Bitbucket key generated by SourceTree in my `.ssh` folder and then I removed it. So maybe `ssh-add -k` added that one as well _at one point_? Then again, I have another entry for GitHub (I'm assuming this was generated by the GitHub desktop app _at one point_) that I have not removed, yet `ssh-add -k` currently only adds my main key.\n\nMaybe installing OpenSSH with Homebrew introduced some quirk as well.\n\n\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n\n. @Copperis Not just that, but I would've had to have the key pair, right? To successfully auth? That's pretty crazy.\nI was able to retrieve the SourceTree-generated key pair from my Trash and attempt ssh-add -k again. It only added my main key. So that seemingly rules that out. Not that it ever seemed likely. I guess I could send you that public key via email and see if it matches one you have.\nAs far as I can tell, the key pair had to have been installed as part of a package. Have you published or contributed to any Homebrew packages? Or Vagrant or VirtualBox? Or anything even remotely related to ssh-agent? As it happens, I updated OpenSSH yesterday.\nI also use a ton of other package managers. \ud83d\ude16 \n\ud83e\udd14 \ud83e\udd14 \ud83e\udd14 . @Copperis Not just that, but I would've had to have the key pair, right?

I disabled wordpress-trunk: \nThis time it took 13 Minutes. \nIt was checking and updating a lot of things.\nAfter 12.5 minutes it started to create new site.\nIt takes around 30 seconds only to create my new website. \nSo how to stop checking/updating unnecessary things on creating new site?\n.
