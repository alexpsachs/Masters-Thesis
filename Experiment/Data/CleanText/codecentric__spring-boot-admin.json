Hey, I just wanted to play around with the chat rooms ... and created one for spring-boot-admin. Should we introduce this?

I will document it in the Quick Guide. It seems, that Spring Boot changed the reactor library version with 2.1.x\nSpring Boot Admin 2.0.x only supports Spring Boot 2.0.x. There is nothing extra configuration to do when server.servlet.context-path is set. \nWhich version of Spring Boot (Admin) are you using?. \n. Could you please provide the complete log. In my project, for workaround, we put the namespace to the application name.. Yes, it is backwards compatible with little limitations.\nSee http://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/2.0.0/#monitoring-spring-boot-1.5.x. @nickle-ye are you currently working on this new feature? If not, I would offer my power to implement such a view.. The configuration of your client (soundApi) is also useful to locate the problem.. Please try to remove the property spring.boot.admin.client.instance.service-url out of your client's config. This property is only useful for advanced setup.. I don't get the point. What is exactly the problem? . Did you follow the instructions in the documentation? http://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/current/#_securing_spring_boot_admin_server. Do you have a eureka server running? If not try another, simpler example like https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/tree/master/spring-boot-admin-samples/spring-boot-admin-sample-servlet. spring-boot-admin-sample-servlet is working, I'm sure. Could you provide your sources, i.e. in github?. Please follow the documentation  http://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/current. This is the \"normal\" behaviour. For AngularJS applications, like SBA-1.5, the URLs for the GUI always contains this \"#\" character. The API for SBA is (in your case) behind this URL http://localhost:8090/admin/api/* (i.e. http://localhost:8090/admin/api/applications).. Is this the complete configuration? Or just a part of it?. No, also in staging environment.. Fix provided at https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/pull/997. ",

It maybe useful to add configuration options here? Currently there is no way to alter either the rest-api-url nor where the static assets are served. \n. One advise: Don't include the admin in the webapp you want to monitor. \nIf your app isn't responsive or goes down the admin is also affected.\n. At best choose an isolate JVM (if you're not already have one per app) \n. Hmm.. when i get it right it was requested to change the Path where Admin UI is served. The PR is a step in the right direction, but allows only to change the servers root context path.\nSo there is still a conflict when the app has a controller mapping on \"/\" an includes the boot admin...\n. PR merged. I'm closing this issue. In my opinion Spring Boot Admin itself should be deployed as microservice. So changing the path of UI without changing the contextPath has no really use case (or has it?)\n. Hi Robert,\n1) the overview list refreshes the state every 30s. Imho apps going down/offline shouldn't be removed automatically. A missing app can be overseen; a big red OFFLINE/DOWN not. I've just pushed a solution into my repo (spring-boot-1.2.0 branch) for removing apps manually.\n2) Since the spring-boot-admin is included via autoconfiguration, everyone can decide on his own to secure the endpoints, it's totally up to yourself. So we shouldn't do it on default. Maybe we should only provide a good example.\n3) I'm very ambivalent towards the service discovery:\nSpring-boot-admin is mainly a monitoring app and so itself is not part of the mission-critical infrastructure. And in terms of microservices shouldn't the concerns of service discovery/repository deserve it's own service?\n@denschu @dickerpulli what do you think?\nRegards\nJohannes\n. For what purpose you wanna do that? Having ip/hostname aditionally to management-url seems redundant? May be a hook to customize the registered url is sufficient? \n. Hmm wouldn't be a ApplicationListener better applicable for registration/unregistration? And I think we still need periodic registration in case the admin-server was started after admin-clients.\n. Some features were added (e.g Hazelcast, more RESTful api, multiple instances with the same name).\nSome will never make it (e.g. Swagger).\nIf something is still missing what you'd like to see please open new issue(s)\n. i've added a title. Since index.html is static, the title is too.\nIf the admin url is found in the applications the title could be set to it's name, but i think the effort is a bit high for small effect...\n. I'm currently pondering on the registration, so here is my request for comments:\n1) Use the applications management url as the unique identifier. Therefore, it is possible to register two applications with the same name but with distinctive urls. (Impacts UI, no need to do the Application.query() anymore)\n2) Option to specify the clientUrl via property (spring.boot.admin.client.url). This defaults to http://hostname:management.port/management.context-path (see gh-17).\n3) Using spring.application.name as application name, defaulting to 'spring-boot-application' (so it becomes optional).\n4) Make the registration less chatty (no GET before POST).\nI also thought about an option to pass along arbitrary, customizable key-value-properties on registration? Model would look like:\n- Application\n  - url:String\n  - name:String\n  - properties:Map\n. I've pushed my changes into my repo.\nDescription of the new configuration options.\nI need to add some tests and then i submit a PR.\n. Since passing around URLs in URLs causes problems on all ends (Tomcat, AngularJS), an Id (to pass around and as storage-key) is already derived from the URL. It should be no problem to alter the computation producing shortened SHA1-Hashes (like in git). I like the Idea.\n. Imho it would be good to seperate the three different modules/topics into three seperate PRs.\nOn the caching:\n1) I miss the part where the ApplicationRegistry is connected to the cache or am I just blind?\n2) I agree that it should be possible to plug in a (distributed) cache. But specifying the implementation (hazelcast) is to opinionated. What if i want to use ehcache?\nSo in my opinion we should support caching (through Spring Cache Abstraction). And only provide an example for using hazelcast.\nOn Security:\n1) In my opinion the same applies here. We should provide a simple example on how to configure security. It seems to me that it is a lot code for security configuration. Maybe we should have a look at spring boot actuators ManagementSecurityAutoConfiguration as blueprint. \n2) Is the security supported on the UI?\n3) Securing the management API is out of scope for spring boot admin, since it belongs to the spring boot actuator. Spring boot acutator already supports securing the management API, so in my opinion your ManagementSecurityConfig is redundant.\nOn the Code\nI've spotted some problems\n- Code contains telekom packages \n- Code contains TODOs\n- Some comments on class level would be nice\n- AdminServerAuthenticationEntryPoint is just derived for logging purposes - no functionality\n- AdminServerWebAuthenticationDetails is derived for no purpose?\n- AdminServerAuthenticationToken is derived for no purpose?\n. Look at the changes in spring-boot-admin-server/src/main/webapp/public\nI wouldn't provide config options for any cache provider. So it's up to the user.\n. Inspired by your work (thanks!), I've added hazelcast support to the autoconfiguration with commit 1d703dc223b2bbe9b2b4386df15ef66b147213aa.\nI'm now closing this PR because imho swagger is too bloated and regarding the security I would ask you to submit a new PR after rebasing.\n. I've done a bit in earlier commits. I must admit that i've not looked\nat these points of your changes - it was too much in one PR. Feel free to\nfile another PR in case there is something missing.\nAm Freitag, 14. November 2014 schrieb Robert Winkler :\n\nOK. Thx. What about my Integration Tests and Restful API changes?

I've changed the logfile not being provided by a RestController anymore. It's now exposed via an actuator endpoint.\nSo now you can enable application side basic-security and disable it for the actuator endpoints.\nThe Spring Boot Documentation says:\n\nSince your management port is often protected by a firewall, and not exposed to the public you might not need security on the management endpoints, even if your main application is secure. In that case you will have Spring Security on the classpath, and you can disable management security like this:\n\nThis is now possible with that change.\nCurrently the UI isn't capable of handling basic-auth secured management endpoints / admin-api. (PRs welcome)\nRegarding to the CORS-problem: Do you have the problem with any endpoint? Can you provide an example to reproduce the problem?\nCurrently the CORS-Filter is active for all requests. \nWe have to work on this, the filter should only be active for management-endpoints.\n. Imho we shouldn't do that, it leads to a false sense of security.\nWhen the management-endpoints are routed via the server we are serving foreign (perhaps harmful) to the browser. So Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) would be circumvented totally. \nSo instead we should employ CORS and ship appropriate http-headers, making transparent where the resources are loaded from.\n. Merged\n. Can you provide an example to reproduce this issue? \nCan't you nail the specific version in your build-file as workaround?\n. We are about to release a new version (hopefully  in the next days). ~~Don't know yet if it's going to be a 1.0.6 or 1.1.0~~ It will be 1.1.0 we are going to update the README.md when it's out\n.

Everything you say is valid. I lowered the log-level to debug for re-registration in server and for registration in client.\n. Just added the badge... that doesn't hurt. We can remove it later if it turns out nobody uses the chat.\n. The UI has been separated from the server and the webjars are gone. There shouldn't be no problems with the transitive dependencies any more.\n. It's not published yet.

First you have to customize the spring-boot-acutators trace-endpoint to contain the message body.\n\nTo customize the spring-boot-admin user interface copy the spring-boot-admin-server-ui project and add the presentation logic for the trace-endpoint, build your own *-ui.jar and use this instead of ours.\n(Or issue a pull request with the trace-endpoint-presentation, may be we will include it in future releases...)\n. I've added a view for the trace endpoint. For viewing the message content you have to customize spring-boot-actuators trace-endpoint yourself.\n. I've merged commit 434042bf443de547ff84573ecdd61758fc0d49a3. The other two commits were an mistake, weren't they?\n. Supporting the same credentials for all nodes using basic auth shouldn't be that hard to implement in the ui. I take a look on this. Anyhow PRs always welcome.\nI assume your management endpoints are only reachable from a private network? Is basic auth (maybe using HTTPS/TLS) sufficient?\n. That is already configurable via http.filter.cors.headers-property. No\nchange needed, only documentation.\n. @jocax Currently this is not possible. \nYour suggested solution would imply to make the apps' credentials visible via the admin-server-rest-api...\nI think it would be more reasonable for the admin-server to act as reverse-proxy for the clients... And make this a configuration option.\n. @jocax\nYes, with the current release there is no easy way to interact with secured endpoints.\nBut you could choose a different port for the management endpoints and leave them 'unsecured' and protect them by only being accessible from internal 'secured' networks. \nI'm making some progress on enabling the UI to interact with basic auth secured endpoints. But unfortunately due to little free time and some needed restructurings in the UI this will take some time. \n. With the current development branch it is now possible to secure all applications with the same credentials. Due to the routing via the reverse proxy the browser sends the needed headers.\n. @ashwgupt https://github.com/joshiste/spring-boot-admin-samples contains sample where you don't have to. Also the upcoming SBA 1.5. release (hopefully end Feb 17) also has a lot of enhancment for security.. Hi Jens,\nwhich version? With FF and Chrome it looks good using the HEAD.\n\n. We are working on it. We have some issues with the new gulp build on our ci server....\n. You can find a snapshot here: https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots\nWe hope to release in the next days\n..ooh wait. Damn it! Not all atifacts were uploaded to the snapshot-repo\n. 1.1.2 has been released\n. I think i will try to tackle this next, since we are now using timers too. What type of diagram would be suitable for displaying timers?\n. As the new metrics endpoint in 2.0.0 has a totally different layout (due to micrometer), I'm closing this issue.. Have you figured out if the http://localhost:8080/health endpoint is responding?\n. Can you have a look at Network Tab of Firebug/Web Dev Console in you Browser? You should see a request to that endpoint there?\nIt seems the \"Unicorn\" app was registered with url=myhost:8080\nI think that's the problem\n. Have you set the property spring.boot.admin.client.url? It should default to http://hostname:${management.port}/${management.context-path}.\nIn your case http://myhost:8080 and not myhost:8080.\n. Do I get it rigth: you want to register some other health endpoint, than /health?\nI don't know how big your static angular app is, but when its url is polled as endpoint everytime the whole app will be transmitted....\nDid you thought about integrating a healthindicator in your rest-app that could check yout asset server?\n. So can't you create a health file with content { \"status\" : \"UP\"\n}.  This should work...\nThough supporting non-boot apps is a feature we can discuss. But in my\nopinion spring boot admin is not a 'enterprisey' monitoring solution,  it\nmerely helps to gather information about your applications.\n. So i'm currently working on seperating the health-url from the management-url, to support non-boot-actuator-apps. \nI'm just curious how you wan't to register your asset-server? Is there a need for specifying a 'static' application-list in sba?\n. Closed with 742fa8a0d184ef0653bcc596a461e62dc700a48f.\nCurrently there is no \"static\" client configuration.

Ok, I did take a look on using https with spring boot admin.\n- If a client want's to register at a https-secured admin-server, the client must trust the admin-servers certificate.\n- If a client has registered with a https-secured management url the admin-server must trust the clients certificate. This is because the requests from the UI will be forwarded by the admin-server to the client and therefore the admin-server must trust the clients certificate.\nFor me, after importing the clients certificate into a keystore and using it via javax.net.ssl.trustStore and javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword-system properties everything works nicely.\np.s. I think I don't have to clarify that the registered managment url must be reachable from the admin server....\n. The autodetection of https on client is a good idea.\nBut I think the changes to the resttemplate and securehostroutingfilter aren't necessary. Did you have a look at #66?\n.

So what features you'd like to see? refresh? restart?\n. Please be a bit more specific. \n\nI don't think we will provide functionality for config-servers..\nFor config-client there are /refresh /restart /pause /resume and /env endpoints.\nReading /env is already implemented.\nSo which feature you desire most?\n. The message is from a head request to /logfile returning an empty response.\nTry updating zuul-core version by pinning. The message should disappear.\nIn the head revision the request isn't made anymore...\n.  Is the admin server a separate application? Sounds like it's the same you want to monitor?\nSo how are following properties set in the spring boot admin server:\n- server.contextPath\nAnd following in the client who wants to register:\n- spring.boot.admin.url\n- spring.boot.admin.contextPath\nNote you can also just append the /rio to spring.boot.admin.url ... internally spring.boot.admin.url and .contextPath are just getting concatenated...\n. First of all I recommend no to include the admin into the app you want to monitor..\nThis bug is due to this bug https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/issues/270\nTry pinning the version of spring-cloud-netflix-core to 1.0.1.RELEASE (not tested)\nIn the meantime I'll update Spring Boot Admins dependencies.\n. Did you have a look at the endpoints via browser? Is the information provided there? \n. The way you described the info column to work is the intended one.\nThe logging view only works if you are using logback and is relying on jmx access via jolokia...\n(does the jmx view work?)\n. You need to activate the JMX-Configurator in Logback:\nhttps://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/blob/master/spring-boot-admin-samples/spring-boot-admin-sample/src/main/resources/logback.xml#L4\nDid you have a look at your browers console in jmx view? Is there any error showing up?\n. So can you take a look at the network console looking at the request/responses?\nOr do you have a sample project to reproduce the issue?\n. Or maybe an browser issue? What browser are you using? Did you try latest chrome or ff? \n. @josetesan Do you have any unresolved problems? can this Issue be closed?\n. the boot admin server serves as a zuul reverese proxy on /api/applications//* so the request is forwarded to your client app. And I assume there is security with csrf protection active?\n. For the JMX and logging section posting to /jolokia is required. So you sholud disable csrf for this endpoint.\n. Hmm I think you're using an older version of spring-boot-admin right? In the current 1.2.0 this isn't necessary...\n. Anything else you are missing?\n. The admin server is indeed a reverse proxy to the application. But the UI references not the proxy url for the logfile :(\nDo the other views in admin ui work? \n. Can you provide a small sample to reproduce and clarify how your network is\nsetup and what urls are reachable from browser and admin server?\n. So the Admin-UI and REST-Interface is also routed via nginx? I don't see any reason why this shouldn't work. The POST-requests to the jolokia endpoint are routed via /api/applications/{id}/jolokia. Please check your browser console and network monitor to see what's happening.\nAnd you can try the 1.2.1-SNAPSHOT in the sonatype repo \nRegarding the logfile link i will fix it before the 1.2.1.RELEASE\n. Have you tried if post requests are well served from there?\n. I did a small docker setup using haproxy in front of an admin-server and client. The haproxy port is exposed and only forwarding to the admin server.\nEverything looks good. I guess there is something wrong in your setup...\n. Please pin to that version. I will do the update for HEAD,  but i won't\nissue a new release.\n. closed by f08744d\n.

For the latter you must not use the SNAPSHOT-versions. Choose the latest version (1.2.1).\nThe UI is served on the root url.\n. I advise you to not include the admin into the application you want to monitor...\nIn case you want to change the url you can use spring boots server.context-path.\nBut this changes the \"root\" context-path for the whole servlet container.\nThe UI is a bunch of static files in spring-boot-admin-server-ui.jar/META-INF/resources (compliant as of servlet 3.0 spec). So if you want to serve the files from elsewhere you need to customize the way spring mvc is servering these resources. \nIf you  move the UI to a different location, you also have to move the REST-interface used by UI and clients for registering.\n. I wonder if it is really reasonable putting all the three into one single app. Every one has it's own responsibility (service discovery, configuration, monitoring) in terms of microservices you really should keep 'em separated.\nThis is not a quite easy task (while loosing some of the boot magic), since not only the static resources has to be served under a different context path, but also the REST-api. \nMaking the Controller & ResourceHandler configurable or registering a separate Servlet will unnecessarily bloat our code.\n. p.s. does the Eureka Server Dashboard allow to alter the context-path?\n. Thanks for contribution!\nI took this as opportunity to clean up our .gitignore-files a bit.\nClosed with cc6f0bbe9c41ca03369484193a83eb22892f26d2\n. Thanks for contribution!\nI changed the href to # instead of using sref\nClosed with 5f1be5305f99b1ec65c8fbb228aa7374777c1c84\n. Thanks for contribution!\nbtw: With Spring Boot 1.3.0 the logfile endpoint is provided by spring-boot-actuator, so we can remove the code :-)\n. The boot admin server hat a zuul proxy integrated to forward the requests from the angular UI to the registered client-applications' endpoints. I would guess the 401-Response you see is from you client and was proxied by the boot admin.\ncurrently there is no special authentication handling in the UI and the server forwards the requests/responses as they are...\nSo at the moment only basic auth for the client management-endpoints using all the same user/password works properly...\n. So do you have any suggestions how things should work properly?\n. By now I wrote some examples on how to solve authentication. Have a look at https://github.com/joshiste/spring-boot-admin-samples\nSo I'm closing this issue.\n. @ravighanate did you set zuul.sensitiveHeaders to empty / no value in SBA server? So the auth header gets passed by zuul?\nAlso did you look at the basic-example in https://github.com/joshiste/spring-boot-admin-samples?\nThere will be an improvement for Boot 1.5.x to work with proteceted endpoints.. yes, you are right... \n. I'm glad, it was just a typo in th docs.\n. This is a bug in 1.2.2 and has been fixed in the master branch with https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/commit/946f3bd63bb661fcffc670805a9cfb3998fb3277\n. Please assure u don't set the spring.boot.admin.url property in your tests\n. Why don't you just keep out the spring.boot.admin.url proprrty from your test-config? I think it would be the same effort as to add an additional property for disabling, or not?\n. PR welcome\n. When possible the old behavior should be kept. So this would be this matrix:\n|  | enabled = false | enabled = true (default) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| url empty (default) | inactive | inactive |\n| url set | inactive | active |\nyour change would activate the config although the url is unset...\nI've reopened this as enhancment to be closed by your PR\n. duplicates #156\n. I'll have a look at this.\n. I''ve did some major changes an commited you PR. Thanks for contribution\n. You have to copy the spring-boot-admin-server-ui submodule into your own project. Customize the sources, build it and include your own built module in your server instead of the official.\nThere is currently no other solution. If you got something in mind, please leave a note.\n. The exception occurs when the client wants to read the registration-response. So you have to inspect the response for missing healthUrl.\nIs it possible that your client has a newer version then the server and there is a version mismatch?\nIn the version 1.2.3 i've made changes to the client to be more lenient to model changes...\n. Thanks for contribution.\n. Does this only apply when using the DiscoveryClient or even when using the spring-boot-admin-starter-client?\n. As in #111 mention the healthCheckUrl should also be considered\n. In a first step I made the ApplicationDiscoeryListener  customizable, so in future It should be easier to exchange the behaviour.\n. closed in favour of #154\n. the /info is requested to show the version info and /configprops to detect if logfile/activiti is available. This can change anytime due to deployments. So the endpoints are requested regularly.\n. 1. Deregistration on application shutdown isn't enabled by default, so accidental shutdown can be noticed.\n2. The registration doesn't contain any data from /info or /configprops. The admin server backend is totally unaware of that.\n3. The UI is totally unaware when /info and /configprops might could have changed.\nBut what could be reasonable:\nFetch /info and /configprops only once (first render) and whenever the app-status changes. When the information is outdated the user has to hit refresh.\n. @lidkowiak  It would be great if you could try the snapshot build and proof that everything is as you expectet.\n. Yes it is may be if you are using the hateoas-style-endpints.\nTry the boot-admin from my private repo to work with boot-1.3.\nWhen they have the RC1 release i will merge into this repo\n. In previous versions the user had to supply  a username/password and the browser did the check. With 1.2.2 the health-check has moved to the admin server and the server is lacking the credentials. So the best would be to provide the status if the request is unathorized as described in Spring Boot Reference - Security with HealthIndicators .\nOtherwise the client needs to supply a password with the registration request. But by default this request is unciphered (http-only), so you really don't want to send a user/passord over the wire... and so this isn't implemented.\n. When spring boot admin is updated to spring boot 1.3.0 this should be fixed. Since the logfile endpoint is being removed (since this version spring.boot includes it).\nYou can have a look at my personal repo. There is a branch for 1.3.\n. as steve pointed out, we could add support for the spring-cloud features. But in case you haven't got a running process to interact with, spring boot admin can't do anything.\nIn my opinion you should rely on your OSs features to start and stop a process. For example as a init.d-service or in cas you are using docker by controlling your container via kubernetes or sth. else.\n. Did you configure Logbacks  in your logback.xml? Note\nthat the logging page is only working when using logback.\n. I did some polish and included an error line if present. Committed with 16144a8627cd4cff7a2c061f574097c3177c00d8.\nThanks for contributing!\n. With #104 I did a little work on this. In the current master the objetcts' properties will be flattened. E.g. in the overview versions.springboot: 1.3.0.M5 will show up and for the details-page the table would have a row:\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| git | branch: mastercommit.id: e9015acommit.time: 15.9.2015 11:21:58 |\nwould that suffice?\n. closing due to missing feedback\n. > Because with lot of apps and lot of info, the result could be a huge page\nI do not tend to make a default guess on what the user wants to see and currently the UI is only static and not configurable nor easily customizable.\nSo i would suggest for the info-column we could display the first three \"simple\" infos and show an ellipsis if there is more. Clicking on the ellipsis will expand the infos.\n. > Any plan on release ? Maybe waiting for SpringBoot 1.3 release ?\nThe boot admin 1.3.0 will be released after boots 1.3.0 release.\nI really didn't expected so much changes in the meantime. So I think we'll ship admin 1.2.4 when boot 1.2.7 is released (if that happens in the next days).\n. Thanks for contributing!\n. Currently this is not possible. And I don't think we won't support this in the future.\nYou somehow have to tunnel the http via jms - sounds crazy. \nBut I wonder why you just don't make use of a dynamic dns service and register the client with the dynamic dns-name. You need to set spring.boot.admin.client.managementUrl and spring.boot.admin.client.healthUrl on the client.\nOr you have to remove the old registration and make a new registration whenever your client IP changes\n. Problem here is that spring clouds ServiceInstance-interface does not expose all informations from the eureka service. I tried to stay independent from spring-cloud-netfilx to support easily other implementations.\nWhat you can do is override the applicationDiscoveryListener-bean and run your own conversion.\n. duplicates #94 somehow\n. With 1.2.2 a similar option was added (Commit https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/commit/4ac7ea82f9e7ea00cef5529234672d2c819fdb46) \nYou have to specify an interfacename in spring.boot.admin.client.useIpAddressOf\nsee https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/tree/master/spring-boot-admin-starter-client#configuration-properties\n. Ok I got the point. I think it's really worth implementing this. But I think the spring.boot.admin.client.useIpAddressOf should be removed in the same step\n. @adnapster intsead of resurrecting dead issues pleasue use our gitter channel.\nIf your container only has one ip for the localhost-adress the spring.boot.admin.client.prefer-ip setting should do it. Otherwise you'll need to set server.adress or management.adress too.\nIn my (non-production) env it work's well.\n. My Problem isn't the the code being in the core project. Just wondered if I\ncan get rid of it completly :)\n. So I did a rework on the Hazelcast support and decided to not remove this feature at the moment\n. I another solution is to remove the jolokia-core dependency from spring-boot-admin-client. The client itself doesn't need jolokia. It is needed on the for the JMX and Logging pages to work correctly. But for those who don't use the client but discovery have to include jolokia themselves at the moment.\n. This seems to be a problem using war-packaging in maven....\nSince the mvn dependency:tree | grep json-simple tells me it's a compile-time dependency:\n\\- com.googlecode.json-simple:json-simple:jar:1.1.1:compile\n... and the fat-war-file contains the json-simple-1.1.1.jar\n. Are you using the spring-boot-parent for your war-file or the spring-boot-dependencies import? \nIf yes, it won't help adding the dependency once more in spring-boot-admin-starter-client/pom.xml because the dependencyManagement of your pom.xml  (from boot-parent or boot-dependency import) will mark it as optional - and therefore json-simple won't be included in your war using the maven war-packaging. \nAs a workaround you can use the spring-boot-maven-plugin and build a fat-war. The boot-packager will include json-simple into the war. Or just define the dependency yourself...\nSo I'm closing this issue, since it is related to the war-packaging and not to spring-boot-admin. \n. You have to use the spring-boot-actuator and need to expose the endpoints via http. So your application itself doesn't need to be a web application, but there must be somekind of serlvet container running serving the acutator-endpoints. \n. So I bet you are using Spring Boot 1.3.0? Spring Boot Admin 1.2.x won't work with boot 1.3 unless you set endpoints.logfile.enabled to  false.\n. Hi Grant,\nIs the application listed as DOWN or OFFLINE? In former case the link should be visible and latter not. I've tested this with the current master branch.\nWhich version of spring boot admin are you using? The behaviour has changed some time ago. \n. Are you using Spring Boot Admin 1.2.x with Spring Boot 1.3.0? For the server this won't work. The master branch has been updated to Spring Boot 1.3.0\n. Can you debug into the ApplicationDiscoveryListener.discover()? Please have a look if the discoveryClient returns all services and all instances to the services?\n. @staleks any findings?\n. Can you try a snapshot from https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots to see if all your problems are gone?\n. This is related  to #94. Unfortunately the DiscoveryClient exposes not enough information\nIf all your eureka apps have the same mgmt-path you can set spring.boot.admin.discovery.management.context-path=/admin\n. I think it will happen just right after spring-boot 1.3.0.RELEASE.\nFor logfile acces you don't need jolokia, but for changing loglevels.\nSince your problems are solved I'm closing this issue.\n. 1. for using Spring Boot 1.3 you  should use one of our 1.3.0-SNAPSHOT builds until release.\n2. We also haven't updated our spring-cloud version so please stick to the Angel SR3\n. I've updated the master to Spring Cloud Brixton.M2 you can try a snapshot build.\n. How should the UI get to know the contextName? \nWe could look for an mbean with name equals to the registered application-name, if not found for name=default. This would force you to choose the application name as your contextName...\nBut I would really encourage you to not deploy multiple apps to the same JVM....\n. @arunkpatra Please try a snapshot to verify the solution works for you.\n. I really like your suggestion, so I implemented it instantly. Thanks!\n. done.\n. You should be able to deploy it as .war-file in the same container, but integrating into existing apps is not supported.\nThere also would be be an conflict with the http-paths since boot admin is serving on /\n. Boot Admin 1.3.0 is not release yet. But you can try snapshot release from the sonatype repo (See README.md).\nThe logfile availability is determined by looking into the /configprops. Can you POST the content of it?\n. hmm.. are you sure you are using spring boot actuator 1.3? I have no clue why the logfileEndpoint-configprops don't show up.\nCan you provide a project to reproduce the issue?\n. @marco79cgn did you file a issue for spring-boot?\n. p.s for the flyway thing please submit another issue\n. merged thanks!\n. If you've already eureka on board why you want to have a separate registration on boot admin and not using discovery client here as well?\nAnd if I read your logs right, the Spring Boot Admin tries to register himself at himself.\nSince the admin container has no docker-link to itself named admin the hostname is missing in his /etc/hosts and therefore he can't resolve the hostname. \ntl;dr\nthe Admin Servers application.yml is wrong. Fort the docker profile you should also use \ndiff\nspring:\n  profiles: docker\n  boot:\n    admin:\n-      url: http://admin:${server.port}\n+      url: http://localhost:${server.port}\n. So instead of  localhost using the loopback ip 127.0.0.1 should do it, or not?\n. \nAre you referring to the url at the bottom of the message? This isn't the url of the application went down. Its the url of the website sending the notifiacation. The url of the concerning application ain't shown in the message at all, but if you click on it you will get to the detail-page.\n. Which boot version are you using?\nFor Admin 1.3.0 you have to use boot 1.3.x.\nBut the Admin Server 1.3.0 should be compatible to Admin Clients with 1.2.4\n. Did you check the /metrics endpoint of the client app? Does it look right?\n. K. I see you got hateoas for the endoints activated. Either you disable this on your client  or you must upgrade your admin server to 1.3.0 also.\nFor a pity you can disable this on the client currently only by removing spring-hateaos. see https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/4616\n. ...ok then I think it is a bug. I will dig into this..\n. When I add spring-boot-starter-hateaos to my boot 1.3.0 sample the /metrics renders the way shown below and everything renders fine.\nCan you figure out which spring-hateoas version is pulled in to your app? Do you have also included spring-data-rest or something else? Or do you even have the ObjectMapper conifugred in some strange ways?\n{\n  \"_links\" : {\n    \"self\" : {\n      \"href\" : \"http://localhost:8080/api/applications/b1fd46f8/metrics/metrics\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"mem\" : 523776,\n  \"mem.free\" : 289612,\n  \"processors\" : 4,\n  \"instance.uptime\" : 48345,\n  \"uptime\" : 57041,\n  \"systemload.average\" : 0.44,\n  \"heap.committed\" : 523776,\n  \"heap.init\" : 126976,\n  \"heap.used\" : 234163,\n  \"heap\" : 1797120,\n  \"threads.peak\" : 29,\n  \"threads.daemon\" : 25,\n  \"threads.totalStarted\" : 35,\n  \"threads\" : 29,\n  \"classes\" : 10528,\n  \"classes.loaded\" : 10528,\n  \"classes.unloaded\" : 0,\n  \"gc.ps_scavenge.count\" : 8,\n  \"gc.ps_scavenge.time\" : 161,\n  \"gc.ps_marksweep.count\" : 2,\n  \"gc.ps_marksweep.time\" : 265,\n  \"httpsessions.max\" : -1,\n  \"httpsessions.active\" : 0,\n  \"gauge.servo.zuul.filter-simplehostroutingfilter\" : 0.0,\n  \"gauge.response.health\" : 17.0,\n  \"gauge.servo.zuul.filter-predecorationfilter\" : 0.0,\n  \"gauge.response.metrics\" : 4.0,\n  \"gauge.response.api.applications.b1fd46f8.info.star-star\" : 12.0,\n  \"gauge.servo.zuul.filter-servlet30wrapperfilter\" : 0.0,\n  \"gauge.response.api.applications\" : 11.0,\n  \"gauge.response.star-star\" : 22.0,\n  \"gauge.response.info\" : 7.0,\n  \"gauge.response.api.applications.b1fd46f8.configprops.star-star\" : 74.0,\n  \"gauge.response.star-star.favicon.ico\" : 8.0,\n  \"gauge.response.api.applications.b1fd46f8.metrics.star-star\" : 10.0,\n  \"gauge.servo.zuul.filter-senderrorfilter\" : 0.0,\n  \"gauge.servo.zuul.filter-debugfilter\" : 0.0,\n  \"gauge.response.api.applications.id\" : 11.0,\n  \"gauge.response.configprops\" : 68.0,\n  \"gauge.response.api.applications.b1fd46f8.health.star-star\" : 23.0,\n  \"gauge.servo.zuul.filter-sendresponsefilter\" : 0.0,\n  \"gauge.servo.zuul.filter-formbodywrapperfilter\" : 0.0,\n  \"counter.status.200.configprops\" : 3,\n  \"counter.status.200.api.applications\" : 1,\n  \"counter.status.200.health\" : 5,\n  \"counter.status.200.api.applications.b1fd46f8.info.star-star\" : 4,\n  \"counter.status.200.api.applications.b1fd46f8.health.star-star\" : 2,\n  \"counter.status.201.api.applications\" : 5,\n  \"counter.status.200.info\" : 4,\n  \"counter.status.200.star-star.favicon.ico\" : 1,\n  \"counter.status.200.metrics\" : 4,\n  \"counter.status.200.star-star\" : 14,\n  \"counter.status.200.api.applications.b1fd46f8.configprops.star-star\" : 3,\n  \"counter.status.200.api.applications.b1fd46f8.metrics.star-star\" : 4,\n  \"counter.status.200.api.applications.id\" : 1\n}\n. @aayushgupta If I just use the spring-boot-starter-hateoas, the endpoint renders the way I shown.\nCan you give me your sample project? May be there is also some strange jackson configuration going on...\n. @aayushgupta\nIt's your JsonpAdvice in Application.java causing the /metrics-endpoint render that way. \nYou have to  manage that it doesn't affect the acutator-endpoints. For example by setting basePackages on @ControllerAdvice.\n. You don't have to configure this explicit - it should just work.\nThe applications are identified by their health-url. You should check them for being unique.\n:information_source:  The ApplicationDiscoveryListener is responsible for registering the discovered ServiceInstances, currently it just uses the informations exposed by the ServiceInstance-interface, therefore it might be necessary that you override the convert() method and use the health-url provided by the EurekaServiceInstance.\nAlso you could turn on the DEBUG logging for de.codecentric.boot.admin.registry.ApplicationRegistry. In case all your apps are using the same health-url there should appear a \"Application {} refreshed\" logmessage.\np.s. I just tested it once again and couldn't reproduce your issue\n. > Won't the health URLs be unique anyways because the services are on different ports?\nYes, exactly.\nDid you check the Eureka registry for having both servers registered?\n. Weird. Do you have a sample project for me to reproduce this?\n. Ok I can reproduce the error and yes it's a problem with the discovery client. It looks like when fetching the registry only one instance is stored in the clients local registry.\nI did though managed to get all instances show up in the admin by setting unique euraka.instance.hostname. \nDoing a bit of debugging I found out, that the hostname is used as key for storing the InstanceInfo in com.netflix.discovery.shared.Application (since no UniqueIdentifier is set). So you have to use unique hostnames. So I guess when you test ribbon in this scenario you would see that the load won't be balanced.\nI'm closing this issue since it is related to Eureka and not Spring Boot Admin.\n. Crazy. but I think it's a bug in boot.\n. I've submitted https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/4775 and will do a workaround by setting ignoreUnknownFields=true for AdminClientProperties. \n. Currently this is not possible.\nMy 5 cents:\nIf you hand over the credentials to the admin server, so that you can access the endpoints via the zuul proxy at /api/applications/{id}/* without credentials, so you don't have achieved any additional security.\nYou could then secure the admin server with the result, that one password gives you access to all your applications. So in turn you could also use the same credentials for all your applications.\nAnd in case your are not using https for the admin <-> application communication the passwords would be transmitted in plaintext...\nJust an additional note:\nThe health-endpoint is currently required to report the status (details not needed) without credentials. For achieving this see Spring Boot Reference - HTTP health endpoint access restrictions\n. spring.boot.admin.username spring.boot.admin.password are the credentials used for the post-request to register the application - so has to be set on client side. If you get a 403, you got a wrong password/user.\nIf you only include a spring-security and have no security.user.password set in the admin server a random one is generated. See Spring Boot Reference Guide - Security\n. @ethlo depends on the solution. I did try to include the credentials in the url via <user>:<pwd>@host -  generally works just the zuul needs some tweak.\n. What? I don't understand any of this german/englisch Kauderwelsch/mumbo-jumbo.\n. OK now in better english. But I'm not quite sure if I understand what you want...\nDo you wan't a restart-button as requested in #99? Then this is a duplicate.\nCurrently you can set properties via Spring Clouds extended /env-endpoint and there is also an button to hit the /refresh-endpoint reinitializing the refresh-scope. So basically you could override spring.profiles.active.\nBe aware that the changes to your properties is done using a high-priority PropertySource in Spring Cloud and is not persisted. So restarting your application will lose the \"overrides\". And for changing the configuration label, this has to be done very early in the bootstrap-phase... So this will never workout I think.\nSo basically you some-how need to change your config-files or system-environment in an durable fashion. This is totally out of scope for Spring Boot Admin. In essence Spring Boot Admin is just a  UI for Spring Boot Acutator/Spring Cloud-endpoints. No other magic involved. Additionally it just helps with finding all your apps in a list by discovery or http-registration.\n. Can you be please a bit more precise? At best provide an sample.\nAlso here german/english mixup... Maybe you should turn off autocorrect....\n. Did you configure the spring.boot.admin.context-path on your ~~app~~ hystrix server with included boot-admin-server?\n. Setup Eureka properly...see\nhttp://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/docs/1.0.3/spring-cloud.html\n. 1.3.2 should do it!\nAnd the snapshots are always here... https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/de/codecentric/\n. Your urls look a bit weird to me, with the missing host...\nIf the application is added over and over again, it is most likely being registered over and over again by the admin client ...\nDid you check that this isn't the case? Do you have a setup with multiple admin clients and/or servers? Are you using Eureka, hazelcast, ...?\nThere is a feature to deregister applications when they are shut down, but it is disabled by default. Look in the docs for spring.boot.admin.auto-deregistration\n. >  it is most likely being registered over and over again by the admin client ...\n\nDid you check that this isn't the case?\n\nDid you? Please check the logs off all your admin clients and servers. Or use tcpdump to see what's on the wire. The wire never lies.\n. > enterprise custom edition can be supported?\nI don't understand the question. What is \"enterprise custom edition\" and what exactly do you mean with \"supported\"?\n. As said in the FAQs customizing the UI is currently only possible via copying the spring-boot-admin-server-ui project and modifiying the files.\n. The health status is determined on the server-side, wich doesn't have the credentials. Therefore at least the status (without the details) must be available for unauthenticated access....\n. Hey steve, thanks for sharing your opinion. \nI am currently really not sure what todo here. So I submitted this issue and I am really glad that you joined the discussion.\nFor customizing there was for example a request for changing the html-title. And it's totally static and not configurable (e.g. disabling views)\nAnd for example the activiti-\"extension\" is merged in to the \"core\"-ui. may be it would be nice to use some kind of extension-mechanism.\n. @steve-oakey I am interested in how you solved security. Do you have some info on this? May be you want to write a short section in the docs on this?\n. I was also pondering if there is some way to make the ui \"pluggable\".\nI think it's very clear how to cut the modules. \nI question if this is solvable with a single Angular SPA or if the ui should be split into multiple pages....\nCurrently I am missing the time to do some prototyping here.\n. I've done some work on this on a branch in my repo.\nFirst I try to separate the ui into independent angular-modules.\nNext step is dynamic loading of these modules.\nI don't want to pull thymeleaf in. I'd rather try to serve the moduls via a spring 4.1 resource chain...\n. The biggest pain was that developers weren't able to add their own modules in the UI. I've committed the changes to make the UI modular to the master branch. The snapshots should be available in a few minutes. \nAdditional to the modularization the UI and has been modernized to a recent version of angular and now uses webpack for packaging.\nFor some more informations see the commit message \nI'm keen on closing this issue. Yes, not all of the problems listed above are solved, but the decision is to evolve the UI and not to rewrite it from scratch.\n. Did you see our coveralls-report? I tells 88% coverage. So how did you get your numbers?\n. Zuul is used regardless of using eureka discovery, so this will be always included.\nAnd maybe it's possible to make the discovery part optional, which I would prefer instead of adding another module.\nIs there any special reason for you to not include the discovery part or is it just to get rid of unnecessary dependencies?\n. I did take a look at the dependencies for the simple sample. In my opinion we really rely on the dependencies pulled in and Discovery/Eureka isn't - so here is nothing to optimize.\n.  spring-boot-admin-ui won't work without  spring-boot-admin. It's not designed to.\n. Hi @RobWin,\nI think doing a auto-registration-property (default: true) is a reasonable thing and should  be done. But I think we shouldn't add the endpoints, I think this requirement is very special. But it shouldn't be no problem to add a custom scheduled task wich can be startet/paused and uses the ApplicationRegistrator to de-/register.\n. I still hesitate to add the endpoints (even as a module).\nI think deployment strategies are very different and I think this is a very special solution and won't be adopted broadly....\n. So I found (imho) a good solution: First of all I've added the auto-registration property.\nSecond there is an easy solution regarding the desired endpoint:\nIf you are using spring-cloud-context and leverage the extended environment-endpoint you can add this piece of code to your @Configuration:\n``` java\n    @Autowired\n    private RegistrationApplicationListener listener;\n@Autowired\nprivate Environment env;\n\n@EventListener\npublic void onContextRefresh(EnvironmentChangeEvent event) {\n    Boolean runRegistration = env.getProperty(\"runRegistration\", Boolean.class, true);\n    LOGGER.info(\"Environment changed! runRegistration = {}\", runRegistration);\n    if (runRegistration) {\n        listener.startRegisterTask();\n    } else {\n        listener.stopRegisterTask();\n    }\n}\n\n```\nNow when you do a POST request to /env?runRegistration=false the registration task will be stopped... \n. The Spring Boot Admin Server you are including is a DiscoveryClient to itself so you have to set  fetchRegistry: true.\nAnd then just wait... it took 1,5 minutes with the default config until the config-app showed up in my test...\n. > I am trying to centralize Eureka, Zuul, Config Server, SpringBoot Admin Server etc.. in a single component.\nI don't think this is a good idea. It's totally opposed to the microservice idea....\nEurekaServer is for ServiceRegistry/Discovery\nAdminServer is for Monitoring\nZuulProxy is a proxy-server / api-gateway / edge-service\nThree totally unrelated concerns which you should handle separate.\n... and since the admin server itself contains a zuul proxy this doesn't mix very well.\nSo adding the EurekaServer should work but not adding the zuul.\n. > I would like to disagree here. ZuulProxy is a functionality that can be used in different ways. One is the \"API Gateway / Edge Service\" way how Netflix is using Zuul. \nYou are right. But a ZuulProxy which is needed to drive your business must not be included in your monitoring or dashboard applications. And currently  adding a 2nd zuul to the admin server won't work (unless you are doing a ApplicationContext-hierarchy, which I think will be more error-prone and tedious than setting up a second service)\n\n... but adding several admin related features in one service is a valid approach in my opinion.\n\nFor your business applications you are doing microservices and for your admin tools you are building a monolith? Come on!\nIf you entangle all these things you can't release/update/deploy them separate. If you just put it all together in one service for the sake of a single adress, put a reverse proxy / edge service in front.\nBut as always it is a trade-off depending on your context.\n\nWe are not running on a PaaS platform yet and creating a new microservice involves some initial setup effort and continuous maintenance effort from operations.\n\nThree words: cattle not pets\nDoing microservices puts you in the need for automation.\n. Do you wanna submit a PR? Thhe only contstraint I have: It must run without\nthe EurekaServiceInstance.class on the classpath and there should be an\ndefault conversation in case it's not a EurekaServiceInstance.class\ninstance.\n. @jvmlet so are you working on this?\n. @jvmlet Is there a release schedule for Brixton? If the release date isn't that far we can integrate it into the master branch...\n. I found a comment by Spencer Gibb, that they want to release in Q1...\n. Currently  the management.context-path isn't included in eurekas instanceInfo. Would you prefer to add an entry for it to each instances metadata-map or is it better to have a central property in the admin (as it is today with the current \"simple\" conversion) ....\nI would prefer the first solution, but this would require to reconfigure all the eureka clients in case the management.context-path is set when upgrading. (or forcing the old conversion until you done so)\n. Does it work without @EnableAdminServer?\n. Have you tried a milestone or stable release of spring-cloud? Doesn't look like an administration related problem to me.\n. SBA is built againt Spring Cloud Angel SR.4. Please try this version.\n. So with the Angel.SR4 (or SR6) for cloud and running a gradle dependencies you will notice that spring-boot 1.2.x is pulled in. \nAs described in the migration guide you have to change your build.gradle:\n``` groovy\ndependencyManagement {\n    imports {\n        mavenBom \"org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-parent:Angel.SR6\"\n        mavenBom \"org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-parent:1.3.2.RELEASE\"\n    }\n}\n```\nSo this issue is in your build-configuration and not in spring-boot-admin and I close this issue.\nAs mentioned before we are not on Brixton, because no stable release is available.\n. No.\nWe don't use gradle for this project and it's not a spring boot admin problem...\n. When possible the old behavior should be kept. So this would be this matrix:\n|  | enabled = false | enabled = true (default) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| url empty (default) | inactive | inactive |\n| url set | inactive | active |\nyour change would activate the config although the url is unset..\nPlease also think of the docs & config-metadata....\n. Looks good to me. The metadata is completely generated for the client. And since you added the property to the configurationproperties there is no need for handcrafted metadata...\nPlease use the eclipse-formatter rules from the repo-root.\nCould you also squash your changes to a single commit after adding the docs?\n. I think so, have a look at https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6546\n. Merged with 45a19cd40df316b0103b4c2d5943821444c7074e\nI did some small changes: \n- Removed the enabled from AdminClientProperties since it was used nowhere else.\n- Renamed the condition to SpringBootAdminClientEnabledCondition\n- Support for relaxed bindings in the condition \nI also felt free to change your email-adress to the one used on github.\n. the one used in your previous PR...\n. The change was intentional, to allow custom context-paths. With the change also a resourcehandler is registered for the new location in spring-boot-admin-server. I wonder why it is not working for you.\n. The 1.3.2 sample-war-file from maven-central deployed to a tomcat is working for me.\n. You better would have done a rebase.... And forced push\n.

I just modified the commit slightly to also color the status code.\nThanks for contributing.\n. The ui queries the /configprops endpoint to look whether the /logfile endpoint is enabled.\nThe /logfile-endpoint is only enabled when your client hast the logging.file property set. So in case you are using boot's launch.script or some other init.d script, which just redirects the output, the /logfile endpoint is disabled.\n. Indeed. That's bad. I'll have a look into this if it's a bug in Spring Boot or if we have to adapt the detection of the endpoint.\n. Ok. The logfile endpoint is mvc only, so the bean (and the associated configprops) is only created in the managment application context. \nSo the detection of the endpoint in the ui needs a fix.\nThe best to do here is a HEAD request to the logfile endpoint.\n. So did I get it right, that the response from the spring boot admin server contains the class-field and the ApplicationRegistrator can't read it?\nIt was on purpose to not use a shared MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter in the spring-boot-admin-starter-client. The business applications might need their own customized one and that would break communication to the admin server .\nIs it really necessary to make a custom objectMapper in the admin server, so that the answer has the class-field?\nIf that's the case you should instantiate the ApplicationRegistrator in the client yourself with an according configured RestTemplate. The SpringBootAdminClientAutoConfiguration will then use your bean.\n. p.s. that is one of the problems which occur when you add the admin server to your business apps. Don't you? :grinning: \n. Hmm can you put up a small sample? I just don't comprehend the whole\nproblem.\n. I know. There are several changes needed for the Brixton update. I have a branch in my private repo for the Brixton update.\nAfter the Brixton release (at the end of this quarter), I'll update the dependencies in boot admin.\n. No.\nI plan to release after the Brixton Release. We can't publish on RC1 since it's not in maven central and all our dependencies need to be in maven central to publish there.\n. I've committed the changes to master. When the travis build has  passed, snapshots are available in the sonatype snapshot repo:\nxml\n<repositories>\n        <repository>\n             <id>sonatype-nexus-snapshots</id>\n            <snapshots>\n                <enabled>true</enabled>\n            </snapshots>\n            <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>\n        </repository>\n</repositories>\nclosed with 272633e1b16b88125d929868a6bcf5338c6363b3\n. @joshlong the snapshot build is now available. I appreciate some feedback :smile: \n. > Brixton.RELEASE is available now.\nnot yet pushed to repo1.maven.org.\nWe have to wait for that. I update the master branch after spring cloud is published to maven central  and provide a snapshot build for testing. One week after I make the release.\n. snapshots are built. happy testing! :smile: \n. I guess you have a very slow health check, so that the request through the zuul-proxy gets a timeout.\nIt should be already possible to set the timeout via zuul.host.socket-timeout-millis (default: 10000).\nBut you should keep your health-indicators doing fast checks... Maybe you should probe your /health endpoint during load-tests.\n. Hmm the codacy integration is new. Maybe some of the rules need to be tweaked...\n. Awsome! Thanks for sharing!\n. duplicate of #165.\nThis has been fixed in the master branch, but not released yet.\n. Just as any other spring-boot application.\nYou might want to set spring.boot.admin.client.prefer-ip=true\n. Ooops thanks for spotting the mistake!\n. After realizing that eclipse somehow added an ignore for application.properties/.yml to the build path, I found out that the property already gets propagated to the SimpleHostRoutingFilter and a correct configured httpClient gets instantiated in SimpleHostRoutingFilter.newClient() so setting the property should take effect.\n. spring-cloud-netflix-core is a dependency of spring-boot-admin-server and is therefore a transitive dependency of your project and should be on your classpath\n. Thanks for contributing!\n. I've already observerd this problem. I have a fix in my pluggable-ui branch for that problem, which I'm going to merge.\n. It looks like you have to disable the verification on you client-side since the request to the admin has failed. But since you scrambled the client and the admin ip the same way this is hard to tell.\nIn your client you have to instantiate the ApplicationRegistrator with an accordingly configured RestTemplate by yourself. For the latter please have a look at stackoverflow.\n. Sure I think it would be a good enhancement.\n. Hmm are you configuring your subject / text from an application.properties or .yml ?\nIn case yo  do, you can already use property placeholders ${...} which get resolved against the environment.\nSo I have to revert my opinion and there is no need to make the Environment accessible...\n. Closed due to missing response.\n. Did you try to acces the health via the health-url which got reported to the admin server?\n(maybe http://DEVK-PC-022.devbz.local:8090/SpringBootAdminJboss/health)\nI guess the url isn't reachable. Your logfile should contain some info on this....\n. Additional to the healthUrl, you have to set the managementUrl...\n. Hi,\nI've already made a lot of progress on this, as you can see in joshiste/pluggable-ui.\nThe acitivi-view has been moved into a separate module (a simple jar with a bit of angular-javascript and static assets, which can be pulled-in via maven) and is a good example on how to implement a simple ui module.\nI'll merge this after the next release of spring boot admin (which itself waits for the Brixton release) into the master so that a snapshot-build will get available. \nduplicates #145 \n. @nickgr6 yep thats right here is a sample project doing that https://github.com/joshiste/spring-boot-admin-java-magazin. Hi arturdobo thank you for your contribution.\nCan you please fix the issues found by codacy and use the provided eclipse formatter?\nIn case you are sing intelliJ the eclipse code formatter plugin will help you.\n.

Did you check your logs for errors during startup? Do you have a small sample for me to reproduce the problem?\n. Your MonitoringadminApplication class only works for fat-jars, not for war deployment.\nHave a look at our war-sample to see how to run a spring-boot-application inside a servlet-container.\n. I've added a note in the docs for this.\nYou also could deploy our sample war-file from maven-central right away.\n. Did you check the path http://localhost:8080/monitoringadmin/api/applications is correct?\n. You also have duplicate MBean names have a look at the spring boot reference guide to make them unique.\nhttp://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-custom-mbean-names\n. Either you use the same password in all your apps for the management endpoints or you can try the session / oauth2 examples from https://github.com/joshiste/spring-boot-admin-samples\n. > One more question. Do you have any samples to show you can configure\n\nsecurity if the client application endpoints have been secured?\n\nI've put up a simple example. Have a look.\nhttps://twitter.com/joshiste/status/722890703806685184\n. you need to enable the basic auth mechanism (at least for the actuator\nendpoints), your config doesn't do that. Also the \"/health\" has to be\naccessible without any authentication.\n. Your errors looks unrelated to spring boot admin to me.\nWhat really confuses me is com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.invokeFlushAfterService in the error message and the org.wildfly.extension.undertow.deployment.UndertowDeploymentService in the stacktrace. The former is a hint for a websphere deployment and the latter for a undertow/Jboss deployment.\nIs it possible you messed up your application-config somehow? \nDo you have a small sample to reproduce the error?

Regarding the duplicate MBeans you might need to configure a custom domain, in case there are multiple boot applications running in the same VM. Have a look at http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-custom-mbean-names\n. > then how to use that tag? should I add it into my pom? \nAdd the following lines to your pom.xml an reference the 1.3.3-SNAPSHOT version:\nxml\n<repositories>\n        <repository>\n             <id>sonatype-nexus-snapshots</id>\n            <snapshots>\n                <enabled>true</enabled>\n            </snapshots>\n            <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>\n        </repository>\n</repositories>\n. > I have the same problem with tobiasflohre #165\nI really doubt that, cause it looks like you are deploying to a servlet/ee container. And when you doing that you can't set a different port for the management endpoints.\nAnd maybe that explains the weird undertow/websphere messages - since boot maybe tries to spin up a servlet container while itself runs in one...\n. I'm closing this issue right now, since your problems are not spring boot admin related.\n. I fixed the issue with the boolean. I noticed this error while doing the ui modularization. But I've not backported the support for the wrapper types since would be a lot more work.\nMy plan is to merge the modular ui after the next spring boot admin release (which itself is waiting for Brixton which is currently scheduled for 30th of April)\n. There is PR #4484 for that in spring boot\n. Please put up a small sample project to reproduce the problem.\nFrom your stacktrace I guess you are not using the Jackson version defined by the spring boot bom?\nJust fix your NoSuchMethodError which is not related to spring boot admin.\n. I guess currently nobody is working on this.... the microservices-dashboard looks quite abandoned to me, therefore I'm closing this issue.. Please provide a sample project to reproduce the error.\n. Did you check the admin server logs? I guess it can't reach the endpoints of the registered client. Please make sure that the client server is reachable via network from the admin server\n. I can't help you without any logs or seeing some code. Did you have a look at the logs of the spring boot admin server? I guess it can't reach the client.\n. There is support for spring cloud discovery. The admin server fetches the\nURLs from an service registry.\nSo every service registry mechanism supported by spring cloud should work\nwith boot admin. (I only tested eureka so far).\nIt should be no problem to implement something similar and query mesos or\nsome other scheduler.\nIn fact you just need to write the polling code for the admin server an\nstore the results in the applicationRegistry.\n. The guide is missing a part about deploying to a servlet container - it just describes the embedded server mode. Please do what the error message tells you and set the spring.boot.admin.client.service-url for your client application using the url where your service is deployed (e.g. http://localhost:8080/foo)\n. @sallampalli no there isn't.

The deployment script could write an external property file or even just some environment variables, which you could refer in your application.properties.\nYou should read spring boot's chapter on Externalized Configuration.\n\nThis also makes it so that the applications themselves (the clients) don't have to know about the URL that leads to them, they can be totally agnostic, which in my opinion, is a nice separation of concerns.\n\nAbsolutely.

You should implement your own ServiceInstanceConverter for Consul and add it to your admin server configuration. \nIf it's working well, a PR is appreciated. I didn't take a look for discovery with Consul, yet.\n.

I've filed #209 for this issue\n. @mirwais27 could you try a 1.3.4-SNAPSHOT?\n. Unfortunately the Consul API doesn't expose the health-url. \nThe best way would be to improve the DefaultServiceInstanceConverter and use information from the ServiceInstances metadata. This way we can have different settings per application.\nBTW: I've checked that the spring.boot.admin.discovery.converter.management-context-path also works when set in the admin server - but doesn't allow a per app setting.\n. Additionally we have to introduce an option to ignore certain serviceIds. Otherwise the consul agent itself is shown in the application list.\n. @mirwais27 I suggest you to use the same metadata key as I do with 1.3.4. This way you don't need to reconfigure all the clients when upgrading your s-b-a server to 1.3.4....\n. @mirwais27 not scheduled yet... but I think roughly in 2 weeks...\n. closing in favour of the PR #207\n. Merged with b9400eeec3298bd963ef6403d057dc2719db18a8. Thanks for contributing!\n. Spring Boot Admin Server itself uses a modified zuul proxy.

Merged with 37343d6c3c354420c708dffd2d463e16a60bdf1a.\nIt didn't like the list with the fields to display. I entirely moved the code to display a change log entry into a component. Thanks for contributing! good work!\n. Sounds reasonable.\n. Your code on gitter is pointing in the right direction. But remember we need to be compatible with Java 7.\n. Fixed with #215\n. Have you tried what happens if you place a custom logo at the same place in the classpath? it should take precedence. Sadly it wouldn't be configurable for each environment.\n. Since SBA registers custom resource handlers, the right place for the custom edited assets would be these:\nshell\nMETA-INF/spring-boot-admin-server-ui/img/spring-logo.png\nMETA-INF/spring-boot-admin-server-ui/img/favicon.png\nMETA-INF/spring-boot-admin-server-ui/css/main.css\nbut exchanging them is more a hack, but works. And with 1.4.x these paths changes slightly (at least for the css).\n. Merged with 991119e9457fe4e3e7ca046ff76cf61f607b9af4 into 1.3.x\nI did a slight modification so that the applications aren't removed while traversing the list. Depending on the underlying ApplicationStore this could lead to problems.\n. Thanks for contributing!\n. I would suggest you to include these informations in your info-endpoint. Which is already shown in spring boot admin.\n. > ... they present unnecessary burden on every application developer having to explicitly include them in the configuration.\nI'd suggest one of the following ways around this:\n1) you add these information during your (standardised?) build process (for example with maven filtering) - I guess the information is available in your pom.xml or build environment.\n2) you write a custom InfoEndpoint which contains the information\n3) you implement a InfoContributor (spring boot 1.4.x) adding the information\n\nCan you elaborate as to why you are reluctant to consider this feature, or at least to discuss it?\n\n1) You could already show the desired information right now without any change to SBA\n2) I don't think its a heavy burden to add the informations to the /info endpoint. If you don't want to do it manually for every app over and over again - automate it! (solutions given above)\n3) Imho the info endpoint is the right place where your application should show additional information.\n4) SBA uses  the info endpoint to show additional infos for you app. If you would only submit them to SBA the information is not available to others.\n5) SBA doesn't need any metadata to do it's work and therefore doesn't accept such. Your proposal needs extensions of the rest api.\n\nWould you be willing to accept a PR if I submit one for this functionality?\n\nI would accept a PR that would enhance the info section and render things that looks like urls as links.\n. The ui is currently not configurable and also doesn't show any metadata from discovery. In my opinion you should include the information you want to see in your info endpoints. For the most part there are similar reasons like in #216\n. @cforce do you have any comment on this or can i close this issue?\n. > The problem is that i need a filter (sort on a a table) to only show micro services having some attribute value.\n\nYour solution enforces me to click on every single instance and search for this property value.\nSo your solution doesn't solve my request.\n\nthe search box in the application list should also consider the values in the info coloum.\nFor adding things to the InfoEndpoint please refer to the spring-boot-reference guide.\nFYI: With spring boot 1.4 you have a more options\n. The c.c.c.ConfigServicePropertySourceLocator log events are not from spring boot admin.\nOnly the single line from d.c.b.a.services.ApplicationRegistrator is from spring boot admin. If you want to suppress this line set the logging level of this class to ERROR\n. The class ConfigServicePropertySourceLocator belongs to spring-cloud-config. spring-boot-admin-starter-client hasn't any dependencies on 'spring-cloud-config` - so I wonder why it included in your dependencies.\nBut anyway you can disable the config client via setting spring.cloud.config.enabled=false in your application.properties\n. This is not a feature of spring boot admin.\nI guess there is something wrong with your maven filtering options. The spring boot parent has this configured, but afaik they didn't change the config.\nThe maven integration in Eclipse sometimes messes this up.\n. 1. Which version are you using?\n2. Please heck spring boot's autoconfiguration report and beans endpoint for a MailSender and MailNotifier bean. The latter requires the former to send mails\n3. If both beans from 2 are present please check your mail server log.\nJust to clarify: If the admin server itself goes down, it might not be able to send the notifications.\n. P.s. I guess you have configured your own mail server and just copied the settings from the guide in your post...\n. > i debug spring boot's autoconfiguration, i found org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.mail.MailSenderAutoConfiguration\n\nnot create JavaMailSenderImpl Bean, \n\nThen this is your problem and you need to fix it. When autoconfiguration doesn't work, you could instantiate the JavaMailSender yourself.\n. MailNotifier.setTo() and setCc() both accepts a List of Strings. So you just need to write them comma separated, Spring should do the rest.\n. Via configuration this is currently not possible. To achieve this you need to implement your own Notifier.\n. SBA doesn't support notification for metric thresholds and I don't intend to implement this. But you can easily add your own code which polls the metric-endpoints and sends notifications.\n. Hey Christophe, which version are you using and can you please provide the stacktrace from the crash?\n. Could you try the 1.3.4 version? The Exception should be caught - but the application is probably still missing so we have to fix this nonetheless.\n. If you want clustering like features why don't you use our hazelcast support?\nSince every client sends a register request on a frequent basis, registering at all admin servers would multiply the chattiness by the numbers of servers...\n. Hmm ok. Would you be keen to submit a PR for such an option?\n. Please have a look at your browser dev-tools. Look at the console and networking tab.\n. ok so the first two errors aren't from spring boot admin. I guess it's from selenium ide (or similar).\nThe third is the long polling timeout, which is also no problem.\nSince the garbage collections stats are shown in your screenshot, the metrics endpoint in general seems to work.\nThe metrics tab only shows metrics with the gauge. or counter. prefix. Can you check your applications /metrics endpoint for these values? If the endpoint doesen't provide such, the ui can't display 'em.\n. The HEAD calls are made to detect if certain endpoints are available. So no you don't need to implement that.\n. The questions is how to visualize the different metrics. Until now it was simple to render gauges and counters as bars. Other metrics (jvm, datasource, ...) are shown in the boxes above.\nWhat are those metrics you want to show? Don't you use the CounterService so that your metrics are prefixed with counter.?\n. @tjuchniewicz If I will find the time I'll rewrite the metrics view for 1.4 anyway\n. You could write a HealthIndicator for your application watching the heap usage or certain metrics. This has the advantage that you could define the thresholds individual for every application and works with the current spring boot admin - you get a notification, when the status goes down or the jvm becomes unresponsive.\n. This is not an easy task and at the moment out of scope. But you could add such functionality in 1.4.0 as module...\n. This only works when you set spring.boot.admin.context-path to some value other than /. Otherwise Spring Boot Admin's resource handler will be registered for /** and it's resources must reside in META-INF/spring-boot-admin-server-ui.\nIf you don't want to move the context-path of SBA you need to register the resourceHandlers explicitly.\n. @ofbizbrazil in deed and it's fixed in the next version with ed00440 :grinning: \n. @ofbizbrazil 1.3.5 is now available\n. First of all thank you for the PR.\nIn my opinion an option spring.boot.admin.register-once with default true for the old behaviour would be good. And I would appreciate if you would sqash all commits into a single one and do a forced push to your branch.\n. merged with b0330cda6e8c61450c8dbeec91d1e56361c9f5a5\n. fixed with c6e45d74f4ef1e43d092f3adf7044f9acd668df5\n. Which version?\n. and spring boot admin's version?\n. The ui expects to names in the json to be camel case (e.g threadId: 30). Your dump contains names with underscores (e.g. thread_id: 30). The ui can't handle that. I guess you have a custom config for your jackson object mapper / message converter?\nYou should be able to create a configuration extending WebMvcConfigurerAdapter annotated with @ManagementContextConfiguration to register a different converter for the management endpoints.\nI won't do a fix because it would be simply too complex to regard every possible converter config.\n. This is a bug in spring (see SPR-14444). Either you downgrade to tomcat 8.0.33 or you wait for spring 4.2.8 containing the fix.\n. > Could it be done for 1.3.5?\nui enhancements will be only implemented in 1.4.x\n. @Antauri currently not. But a PR is always welcome.\nI don't use the logfile endpoint in our production env anymore, so for myself this isn't at the top of the wishlist....\n. duplicate of #236\n. Why do you think it's an SBA issue? we don't have anything related to Hystrix (yet).\n. merged with dad823c2d5ca646408d8691fb1b914bd5dca91e9\n. you're right. Didn't spot it.\nclosing due to duplication of #147 \n. Authentication is a broad field and everyone is approaching differently, so I don't tend to include it in the admin server itself.\nSetting up authentication isn't that hard. I've setup some samples for that: https://github.com/joshiste/spring-boot-admin-samples\n. As a workaround you should bring your own implementation of the ApplicationDiscoveryListener which doesn't  remove the stale applications.\nI didn't expected to see people using  two different registration mechanisms at the same time.\nAs a long term fix we can modifiy the stale detection to also respect the ignoredServices. This would you allow to add those services which registers via http to the ignored services and they won't get removed.\n. The sample project is build against the snapshot version. Unless you have the sonatype snapshot repository configured you need to build the whole spring-boot-admin project first. And to do that you need to have nodejs and npm installed to be able to build the spring-boot-admin-ui project....\nFrom your log I'd guess the spring-boot-admin-ui project isn't built properly.\n. The css files hasn't been packaged properly :cry: \n. The bug was caused by using an old nodejs version on the build server, which caused a webpack plugin to fail but unfortunatly this didn't break the build...\nFixed with a204453db96495ba94a488bff2881fe2b5e044b8. A fixed version will be published soon.\n. Are you using our client or one of the discovery options?\n. From the reference Guide:\n\nIf you want to customize the default conversion of services you can either add health.path, management.port and/or mangament.context-path entries to the services metadata.\n\nhttp://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/1.4.1/#_serviceinstanceconverter\nThis will fix your problem\n. This is maye caused by the error fixed with #247 (introduced in 1.4.0). Since there is no change in the REST-api you could try to use 1.3.6 just for the client....\n. SBA 1.3.x. is for spring boot 1.3.x  and 1.4.x for spring boot 1.4.x. Currently there is no compatibility matrix. Please use the pom.xml or release notes to figure out which version to use.\nI've to little time to test for multiple supported boot or cloud versions.\n. Please see the samples here for OAuth authentication: https://github.com/joshiste/spring-boot-admin-samples\n. Please provide a sample project to track down this issue.\n. Due to the lack of information I can't track down the issue. And Due to the missing feedback since 12 days i'm closing the issue.\n. What version are you using? This should have been fixed with #230. I guess this is a duplicate of it or a regression?\n. could you provide a sample project for this?\n. so you're using maven filtering to set  spring.boot.application.name ? Do you use a application.properties or application.yml file? \n. When using your UTF-8 characters in application.yml everything is correct. \nUsing your characters in an application.properties on the other hand, the name is displayed incorrect. This is due to spring boot loading .properties-files with ISO-8859-1 as default charset (for more read here: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/5361).\nIf there is no way around you for the .properties-file you need to use the unicode-escapes and ISO-8859-1 as charset. The escapes would be \\u6d4b\\u8bd5 in your case.\nI'm closing this issue right now since this is not a problem of spring boot admin.\n. duplicate of #248 \n. I guess you're referencing a not compatible version of spring cloud. Can you please post your pom.xml or a sample project reproducing the issue?\n. Please switch to Brixton.SR4\nxml\n        <dependency>\n            <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>\n            <artifactId>spring-cloud-dependencies</artifactId>\n            <version>Brixton.SR4</version>\n            <type>pom</type>\n            <scope>import</scope>\n        </dependency>\n. @javabotnetflix you need to use spring boot admin 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT. @javabotnetflix you need to use the snapshot repo\n<repository>\n    <id>sonatype-nexus-snapshots</id>\n    <name>Sonatype Nexus Snapshots</name>\n    <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>\n    <snapshots>\n        <enabled>true</enabled>\n    </snapshots>\n    <releases>\n        <enabled>false</enabled>\n    </releases>\n</repository>\n. The client application tells the admin server it's health url during registration. Afterwards the admin server polls this endpoint to determine liveness. So the registered health-url needs to be reachable from the admin server.\nThe admin client tries to guess the url where it is reachable. I guess in your case the url is wrong and the server can't access the client's health endpoint. \nEither you have to set the client's url correclty via properties or ensure that the url is reachable from the admin server.\n. looks like a duplicate of #257. Please check you Spring Cloud version ans switch to SR4....\n. I'm closing this issue since I've given the answer on SO\n. Looks like it tries to register before the local.server.port has been set...\n. A stacktrace alone isn't enough to track down an issue. At best you provide a sample project reproducing the issue, at least you should provide following information: \n- Which version of spring boot / spring cloud / spring boot admin are you using?\n- Are you using embedded Tomcat or war-deployment?\n- Have you any special application context configuration or are you trying to integrate the admin into your application?\n. sba 1.5.x needs boot 1.5.x. Which version are you using? can you post a complete stacktrace and figure out what the health-url looks like? Either by debugging into DefaultServiceInstanceConverteror querying your eureka registry?\nDo you register any non-spring-boot applications, which haven't a health endpoint?\n\nAnother thing I noticed is that Eureka discover is not working and fetching data for all apps registered in Eureka.\n\nThe applications triggering the exception aren't registered, so they are missing.\n. Thre registered <healthCheckUrl> in eureka must be an absolute URL not a relative one.\nI guess you need to revisits this clients' eureka config...\nMy eureka outputs:\n<healthCheckUrl>http://localhost:8080/health</healthCheckUrl>\nEureka by default uses the heartbeats do detect liveness. I bet if you tell it to do the health checks, it would also fail, see Spring Cloud Reference - Eureka's health checks\n. Did you check that the /metrics endpoint of your client application is active? Or did you change the path of it?\n. If you changed your management.context-path and use eureka read this section carefully http://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/1.4.1/#_serviceinstanceconverter\n. Do you mean /dump (for threaddump) or /heapdump (for heapdumps)? As your text mentions both and is a bit confusing.\nHowever the threads view (for /dump) is always visible. The heapdump link is only available when the client application has an accesible /heapdump endpoint - and therefore the client application must be at least spring boot 1.4.. \nIf you have a look into your browsers' console you should notice a OPTIONS request to /heapdump this is how the ui figures out is the heapdumps are available, since the endpoint is sensitive by default, it could be possible that the request fails because of security. \n. SBA supports multiple instances of the same service. You need to set a unique instanceId.\nSee also\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/36253363/register-multiple-instances-of-a-spring-boot-eureka-client-from-a-single-host\n. As in the SO post or in #134 you need to set the eureka.instance.metadataMap.instanceId for each instance to a unique value.\n. And they all got a unique health-check-url?\nIn general this should work, since we just use spring cloud's DiscoveryClient and do nothing special here. Mostly it's a misconfigured DisconveryClient. If it doesn't work for you, you need to debug it yourself. Have a look at the ApplicationDiscoveryListener.discover() and figure out if it gets all instances from the DiscoveryClient. \n. No. When you don't have a direct http-route to the health-endpoints you can't.\n. @pradeepkusingh have a loot here: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/gorouter/commit/1647c65cf65f712f7597c811cf7f98cfaab9365a\nIt's taken from \"this week in spring\". It  should allow instance-specific endpoints.\n. The admin server does make http requests to the client. How should this work if we got no unique http route to every instance?\n. For the logifle this is a duplicate of #263. For the heapdump we need a fix.\n. @aantono the browser notifications listen to all events and works a bit differently..\n@rnbWarden So do you expect a Slack notification when a service deregisters? Isn't it on purpose when a services deregisters so an extra notification isn't needed?\n. I got the race condition, but what behaviour do you expect?\nIn my opinion when the service shuts down on purpose and there is a cancel send to the Eureka server there should be no down event just the deregistration event. (which is currently flawed because of the race condition)\nBut when the service crashes and doesn't deregister from Eureka there should be an down event and no deregister event (which should already apply)\n. So you found a solution to your problem? Do you want to tell me what the problem was?\n. By default the status update is triggered every 10s and the status is updated if the old status is at least 10s old. So in the worst case the status recieves an update after 20s. Did you wait that amount of time?\n. The status check is a http get on the health endpoint. Did you check that the endpoint was really unaccessible (and no zombie process did answer)?\n. I couldn't reproduce the issue using both applications running on tomcat 7 on linux.\nEverything works as expected.\n. Did you check the admins log after stopping the client application? There should be an exception logged if the other instance gets inaccessible.\n. You need to check if you have your maven resource filtering setup properly. The information are taken from the /info endpoint from spring boot actuator and it's configuration has nothing to do with SBA.\nFor more information have a look at https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-resources-plugin/examples/filter.html\n. Also have a look at the spring boot reference guide section\n. Why are you using the sba client in addition to eureka?\nOK I guess the bootstrap context from cloud config is the parent context... So we need to get rid of the null check and solve #260 different.\n. >  But from your question it sounds as if it's best practice to register anything with eureka no matter if there are consumers of the service and having sba query eureka for the available apps/services?\nWhy not. I think it would be better just to use a single way of registering your applications and getting rid of the extra dependency.\nImho having a extra sba client is just needed if you have a good reason to keep the services out of eureka.\n. @jervi  please submit a new issue.\n. Please show me your full pom.xml or the dependency tree.\n. For examples on how to integrate security please have a look at these samples here: https://github.com/joshiste/spring-boot-admin-samples\nCurrently submitting credentials during the registration process isn't supported because the sensitive information could leak easily via the rest api.\n. Please try a 1.4.3-SNAPSHOT. Additional to the SSE polyfill one for es6 was necessary.\n. @gunnarvelle I've fixed this. Please have a look at the latest snapshot, which is currently built.\n. Duplikate of #279\n. But for the same reason: security solution are rather individual... OAuth\nopenId, LDAP, ...\nIf you had taken a look at the samples you would have noticed that they are\nsecuring sba server as well... Since securing the clients and leaving the\nserver unsecured doesn't make sense at all.\nSince the sba sever is just a simple spring web app just include spring\nsecurity and configure as you like...\n. @steave-oakey sorry. Didn't saw your answer in my mails.\n. > Is it possible to have a Spring Boot 1.3.8 application use Spring Boot Admin Client 1.3.6 and have it connected to a Spring Boot Admin Server 1.4.2\nIt is. The protocol for registration hasn't changed.\n\nOr could I even stick with Spring Boot 1.3.8 and put Spring Boot Admin Client 1.4.2 into it and let it connect to Spring Boot Admin Server 1.4.2 ?\n\nThat's not intended and very probably won't work,\n. You need to disable the CSRF-protection for the /jolokia endpoint in your spring security in your client application.\n. I guess you have a custom WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter? Then setting this property has no effect.\n. did you check server and client for not having csrf active? Since the sba server just forwards the request via zuul to the client endpoint both apps need to have csrf disabled...\n. I've also encountered this exception, but your application should work regardless of that. I already filed a Spring issue for that https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-14739\n. duplicate of #259. Please look at the SO post referenced in the issue.\n. The UI queries the /api/journal for the desktop notifications. Since you're adding the sba server to your application I guess there is a conflict with it's ContentType configurations..,\nYou need to provide a complete stacktrace and sample code to reproduce the error.\njava\n    @RequestMapping(path = \"/api/journal\", produces = \"text/event-stream\")\n    public SseEmitter getJournalEvents() {\n...\n. @Daerthox sorry but the gist is of no use. Can you provide the sample project as zip?\n. @Daerthox After 7 days still waiting on a response. Does the problem still remain? Please provide the needed info in the next days or I'll close the issue.\n\nsorry but the gist is of no use. Can you provide the sample project as zip?\n. I'm closing this issue, when you can't reproduce it yourself.\n. I guess you are using spring cloud config? Then this is a duplicate of #277.\n. duplicate of #277\n. I guess you are not using the latest 1.4.2? \n. This has been fixed with #247...\n. duplicate of #247 \n. The linked docs in README.md are up to date.\n. Please look into the SBA server's logs. If your application is listed as offline there should be an exception. I guess the server can't reach the client...\n. > I do see an info in the client who registers at SBAP (see my first comment!). As far as I understand the log message, the client registers with status \"statusInfo={status=OFFLINE, timestamp=1475682434470}}\". That sounds strange...\n\nIn deed registering normally has status UNKNOWN and triggers a status update.\nDo you use any \"special\" config for the sba server additional to spring security (e.g. spring cloud config)?\nYou could set the loggerlevel for the StatusUpdater to DEBUG and see what happens...\n. On the Server.\n. @rfelgent I could not reproduce the error. Can you please provide a sample project to reproduce it?\n. 1) In your local profile you disable the SlackNotifier, when you do this, the delegate for the FilteringNotifier will be null - resulting in an NPE. I'd recommend to configure a LoggingNotifier in this case.\n2) The StatusUpdater recieves a 401 from the client (itself in this case) you either need to add /actuator/health to the security ignores for the clients or you need to instantiate the StatusUpdater yourself with a RestTemplate which knows the credentials\nbtw, the client registers as \"DOWN\" not as \"OFFLINE\" - a slight difference OFFLINE = no tcp connect - DOWN = not HTTP-OK (200)\n. Also note that SBA 1.4.2 is built against Spring Boot 1.4.1 (your build gradle had a 1.4.0)\n. > My team decided to protect all actuator endpoints except /actuator/info because of the loadbalancer.\nWhy are you using /info for the loadbalancing? /health would be more reasonable cause it checks resources you depend on...\nAlso you can configure the health endpoint to expose only the status and no further details...\nThere are plans for Boot 1.5 to protect the endpoints as default. Improving the out-of-the-box experience  for protected endpoints is on my todo list.\n. I guess the url http://mydomain.com:80/health is not reachable from within your admin container...\nMost likely the hostname can't be resolved..... Does it run outside of docker? Can you provide a sample project to\nreproduce the error?\n. @wmz7year still waiting for your response\n\nDoes it run outside of docker? Can you provide a sample project to\nreproduce the error?\n. > It's inside of docker.\n\nso running outside of it works fine?\n. Which JDK are you using? It could be a problem with classpath-ordering of the resources... \nWe don't sort 'em explizit.\nsigh\n. yeah, we need to order the js files correctly...\n. can you post your complete pom.xml?\n. I finally found the bug. The problem wasn't the ordering, but the global 'use strict' in the acitivi-ui module. We just need to wrap it with a function scope.\n. @wmz7year could you test a 1.4.3-SNAPSHOT from https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots ?\n. Do I understand you right:\nIf server.address is set the url should use the hostname for server.adress and not localhost.\nright?\n. >  so I could submit a PR if you'd like.\nThe enhancement sounds reasonable, so go for it!\n. closed in favour of #296 \n. merged into master  and 1.3.x with e8d80584c3f5ab26dff9c345d32f1be8c97c6cf1\n. 1.3.7 is released.\n. please use the #296 and target 1.3.x\nI'll do the merge afterwards.\n. Overlaps with requirement in #262\n. mreged with 09b8a9560caa2e5f7a146a1daec26dbe37acbb01\n. 1.3.7 is planned for approx 19th October.\n. Hmm... the error is from a testcase or not? The log contains a \"TestContextManager\"...\n. Change it to @SpringBootTest(webEnvironment=WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT) and you're done :smile: \n. your root cause is a a HibernateException. SBA uses no Hibernate.. It was closed from a commit and the commit message saying 'fixed' ...\nSo you can try a 1.4.3-SNAPSHOT build and test the fix if you want to.\n. Thx for  the report. The bug was introduced in 91e79deaa087550452156ea7d946ebd43b654e9e. The Endpoints are in a child context when management port is != server port\n. I couldn't reproduce the error with 1.4.3-SNAPSHOT  (when spring-cloud-starter-config is active).\nCould you try the current snapshot? And when you can reproduce the error please provide the sample project..\n\n. > Can this admin UI work with TLS secured Actuator services?\nDo you mean to use client certificates to identify the SBA against the monitored applications? It's possible, it would require that you modify the used http clients for the zuul proxy filter and the StatusUpdater's restTemplate.\nIf you just mean that the SBA should accept self-signed certificates from your applications you just need to use a regular Java trustKeystore containing the certificates.\nIn the docs for the just released 1.4.3 there is a note on security and a reference to some examples to secure your endpoints.\n. P.s. I currently plan to improve the out-of-the-box experience with basic-auth secured endpoints for the next version (not scheduled yet; but not before boot 1.5.0)\n. Hmm... I've just tested for the \"default\" cluster. I guess we need to add a input field for specifying the cluster.\n. Yeah could work. But nonetheless a select box is needed for multiple clusters...\n. Hmm just figured out that the turbine.stream is no a regular actuator endpoint - so it doesn't run on the management port. This way it's not available via the SBA's zuul proxy...\nI tend to remove the turbine support...\n. Ok I'll have a look bypassing zuul until this is solved. \n. The longer I think about it, the current solution in SBA for turbine seems absolutely wrong. \nSpencer Gibb is  right when he says turbine is a application and isn't an single management endpoint. Additional it gives oversight over many services and therefore shouldn't be a detail view to one instance. So I'll remove the turbine support as it is today. And have a look how hard it's to add a top level view for it.\n. You can try the 1.4.4-SNAPSHOT with the Turbine module from https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/\nPlease read http://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/1.4.4-SNAPSHOT/#_turbine_ui_module on how to setup the module.\n. For registering client applications please read the Docs\n. please the the Question on StackOverflow\n. Yes we publish our artifacts to Maven Central.\n. The @EnableAdminServer is part of the spring-boot-admin-server artifact. Also I advise you to switch to the latest version (1.4.3)\nPlease read the Getting started guide on how to get started.\n. Yeah why not. PRs are always welcome :)\n. I'm currently making progress on this issue and will look something like this:\n\n. > The active connections are showing as 0 (screenshot attached), any idea what needs to be configured for this to work?\nI guess you need \"just\" to set you system under pressure. The data is taken from the /metrics endpoint.\n\nAlso, we don't need liquibase, flyway, is there a way we can disable some checks?\n\nAs of now it's not possible to disable some of the \"core\" ui-modules (which would remove the checks)..\nBut we could add that feature.\n. @ahmednasir91 with 32e1d9ba25635940cf4c333a26cf6b56686b6952 the checks for flyway/liquibase are made lazily and should hit your endpoints way less often.\nImho this reduces the need to disable core modules to almost zero. Can I close this issue, what do you think?. can you attach the npm-debug.log?\nDo you see any other messages  earlier?\nSuch as:\n[launcher]: No binary for PhantomJS browser on your platform.\n  Please, set \"PHANTOMJS_BIN\" env variable.\n??\n. Since you found the problem outside of SBA I'm closing this issue. \nDid you raise an issue for karma-phantomjs-launcher?\n. duplicate of #236\n. oops sorry for pointing out the wrong issue\n. I'll add a handler for the AsyncRequestTimeoutException so that no error get's logged.\n. The ui uses relative URLs.\nSo you need to serve the ui via HTTPS to make HTTPS zuul requests.\n. Since it's an ordinary spring boot application, have a look at the spring boot reference guide.\n. Please see http://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/1.4.3/#securing-spring-boot-admin\n. > The build fails even before I make my changes, maybe because I am on Windows?

I needed to modify the code slightly to make things work.\nIf multiple versions are found the lowest version (by lexical compare) gets displayed with , ... appended.\n. I made queryStatus() protected and added a public getter for statusLifetime.\nSince I consider field names a implementation detail I left them private. But it should be no problem to intercept the values for  publisher, store and restTemplate in the constructor / setter.\n. Do you have sample output?\nHaving more information in the notifications looks like a good thing. PRs are always welcome.\n. > Guess need to open a new ticket?\nwould be better\n. This is a duplicate of #317 and has been fixed with https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-14444\nYou should upgrade to spring 4.3.2 / boot 1.4.1.\nPlease note that you'll get another exception in the logs which is described here: #286 and handeld by https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-14739 and will be fixed in spring 4.3.4 / boot 1.4.2\n. Next time please use http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/spring-boot-admin\nDid you check that the eureka registry is correctly returning the metadata containing management.context-path for the client instance?\n\nAnd I think thats why it is showing OFFLINE in the admin UI. \n\nFor eureka the healtchCheckUrl from the registry is used. The management path isn't used for health checking. So either your healtchCheckUrl is wrong or not reachable from the admin server.\n. A week has passed. Any news on this? Or can I close the issue?\nYou could update to SBA 1.4.4 and set the logger level for de.codecentric.boot.admin.discovery.DefaultServiceInstanceConverter to DEBUG and see if the metadata from eureka is correct.\n. > I thought, SBA will guess the actuator endpoints like metrics, health etc.. based on the server.context-path if provided in the client. And in the client if management.context-path is given, I thought it would guess based on that. Adding all of them explicitly within eureka client config, is it really necessary?\nWhen using Eureka the SBA server can only use the information published by the Eureka registry: the healthCheckUrlPath and the service url (doesn't contain the servlet.context-path!) - so these need to be correct (and you need to set the healthCheckUrlPath explicitly when using non default context-path, see http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/spring-cloud-netflix.html#_status_page_and_health_indicator).\nIn this case SBA server can't guess anything based on the server.context-path or management.context-path, since it simply doesn't know about the values for the registered application.\nThis would only apply if you are using the SBA client - then the client computes the correct urls and uses them to register at the server...). What would you expect?\n. With default docker config, the problem is that the container running the admin server cannot resolve the hostname of the client.\nIn this case you can set spring.boot.admin.client.prefer-ip=true on the client, so the  client uses it's ip address to register at the admin, which should be reachable (if running on the same network).\nAnother way around this would need a DNS so that the admin container can resolve the hostname.\n. The eureka example includes the hystrix module. In the README.md of the repo is a screenshot showing it in action.\nThe spring.boot.admin.routes.endpoints property just reconfigures the zuul proxy. The module should be listed in the about page. If not  - I guess the ui-module jars are somehow not on your classpath...\nThe admin server looks for all classpath*:/META-INF/spring-boot-admin-server-ui/*/module.js files and serves them concatenated as all-modules.js. \nSince I miserably failed in adding log statements in the right places you could debug into ResourcePatternResolvingResourceResolver and see which files are found on the classpath....\n. Any news on this from your side? Can I close the issue?\nYou could update to 1.4.4 and set the logger for ResourcePatternResolvingResourceResolver to debug and see which modules got resolved.\nOtherwise you need to provide a reproducible sample for me...\n. closing due to missing feedback\n. Next time please use Stackoverlow to ask for help\n1) When using eureka the health checks are made using the healthCheckUrl from the eureka registry. So please make sure you configured your eurka client correctly. \nIn the Spring Cloud Netflix documentation there is a note that you need to configure the healthCheckUrl when you have a custom management.context-path .\nSee http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/spring-cloud-netflix.html#_status_page_and_health_indicator\n2) Did you check that the health endpoint responds with UP?\n. After detangling the model from client and server and a lot of pondering over your PR - I did take another approach as I suggested (and you did in your PR)\nI added a details field to the StatusInfo. \nThis has slight advantages: The details are not just accessible from the event, but also every where the StatusInfo is accessible.\n. See #329 for reasons not merging this.\n. Currently you can override the createApplication() method in ApplicationRegistrator on the client side.\nAdding an ApplicationFactory class and extracting the logic into it sounds reasonable. When doing this we should consider to remove the event listener and some noise from AdminClientProperties\nPRs are always appreciated :smile: \n. Looks good so far. Could you do a rebase and a forced push to resolve conflicts and to update the PR?\n. merged with 60c027e2a337df61d591bf620bf360188c39e2ba\n. Yes. They can have the same name but must have distinct health urls.\n. Is there any error shown?\n. Is the endpoint /api/applications/18963283/jolokia/ listed in the /mapping endpoint of your spring boot admin server? Is any error in sba server log?\n. Can you post the response of the /routes endpoint from your sba server?\n. The logstatement is from the sba server's own jolokia endpoint.\nBut looking at your routes (weird malformed xml :astonished:) I guess you have set the spring.boot.admin.routes.endpoints property. Please look through the list carefully I guess you accidentally removed jolokia from it.\n. What problem are you trying to solve?\nThe current implementation resolves the hostname into an ip address which in the most cases should work.\nAfter adding the ApplicationFactory for the upcoming 1.4.5 with 60c027e2a337df61d591bf620bf360188c39e2ba you can easily customize the way the address is computed if it doesn't meet your needs. So I won't merge this PR.\n. Your settings work for me as expected. Did you check that they are properly loaded? Is there anything else special about your configuration?\nAt best you provide a sample to reproduce the problem.. Looking at your project I see you are using Eureka and not the spring boot admin client. The spring.boot-admin.*-settings are just for using sba client. \nIf you don't use the default context-path please apply these instructions from the cloud netflix guide.\nAnd you need to add the management.context-path to the instances metadata as described in the sba guide. . See the Gettign started guide.\n(The link is right on the main page / README.md). I guess each application runs it's own applicationContext ? Each applicationContext  should run an independent spring boot admin client.\nEach context must not see the configuration of the others. One way to achieve this would be using a different spring profile for each app and using application-<profile>.properties. Or right away independent config files.\nI don't think this is a sba issue - how do you deal with other application specific settings? Don't you have the same problem there?. With the upcoming 1.4.5 you can provide your own ApplicationFactory to change the way the serviceUrl is constructed. see #331. >... is the application's status will be refreshed every 10 milliseconds. Am I right or is there something wrong?\nThe default value is 10000ms. The point is not a decimal point but a thousand sepearator. Sorry for the misunderstanding. I'll fix the docs on this.\nThe check is done every 10000ms (period) and each application is checked at most every 10000ms (status-lifetime). This means in the worst case the refresh is made after 19999ms.\n\n... I really want to know how to modify the configuration to refresh the status instead of unregistering web application first.\n\nI guess you are using Eureka or another DiscoveryClient implementation? Spring Boot Admin removes all applications which aren't listed in the service registry anymore automatically (see ApplicationDiscoveryListener)\nRefreshing the status and syncing applications with the service registry is independent from each other. You could ship your own ApplicationDiscoveryListener implementation and prohibit the removal of the stale applications or use the StatusUpdater to do a status check before removal.. The requests are mades asynchronous and (in theory) shouldn't affect the rendering performance.\n\nI suggest following optimization: render flyway/liquibase/heapdump/logfile buttons and after click validate whether particular application handles selected feature/endpoint.\n\nSo you mean to check the endpoints after the user clicked the drop-down button? Good idea!\nAdditionally it would be good to solve #314 so that the not needed modules aren't loaded in the ui.\n\nAdditionally, have you considered combining info endpoints on the spring-boot-admin backend site?\n\nNot yet since the info isn't used on the backend. On the otherhand it would be nice to use them in the notifications... I'd prefer to handle this in another enhancement issue.\n . >I thought about following improvement: UI requests backend \"please give me info for all registered applications\" - one requests instead of hundreds in my case. \nAgreed. Please file another issue for that to keep things tracked separately.. Please test a 1.4.5-SNAPSHOT if things now works  a bit better for you.\nBut this was only half of the rent. That many concurrent calls to /info are still a problem. \nI'll look if I can implement some kind of throttling in 1.4.5.\nAggregating the info on the server side won't make it into the 1.4.x branch, implementing this heavily benefits from a99a889ab7723a00dc5ba7e4abfb82f79a5a26f9 which is in the master branch for 1.5.x.\n. With the latest commit 34b2a071e8adfd407601040388e1827e423cd2a0 to the 1.4.x branch I could improve the rendering performance significantly. 300 applications now render in 2-3 seconds on my machine. Fetching all information for all applications does take longer but should not make the ui unusable. But that will be fixed with #349 hopefully.. If there are too many graphs for one row the wrap around, don't they?. > Fetching all info on demand would likely be quite slow.\nYes. I guess that wouldn't solve the problem.\n\nI assume you would you fetch the periodically like the health checks?\n\nI thought about fetching the infos when the status changes and not periodically. I guess most people have static infos that not gonna change over time without redeploying, don't they?. For the heapdump your client applications must be at least spring boot 1.4 and serve the /heapdump endpoint which should be enabled by default.\nFor the logfile view the client must have the /logfile endpoint enabled. Which is disabled by default. Either you set logging.file or endpoints.logfile.external-file on your client. For more details please have a look at the spring boot reference guide.. Are the graphs showing up despite the error message?. > I don't think it seems Zuul can handle event streams very well, so imho it would probably be better to go against the turbine.stream directly.\nAnother solution would be to copy and modify the ProxyServlet from the original hystrix-dashboard. Sorry for coming back to you this late, but I currently can't reproduce the issue...\nYes, the current (offical) Spring Cloud Zuul filters have problems with long running requests. But I included a patched filter with the changes from https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/pull/1372.\nSo any hints on how to reproduce the issue? \nI guess you are using the SBA Server 1.4.4?. Any feedback on this? Otherwise I close the issue in 2 days.... Closed due to Missing Feedback.. @heymysweetheart As I couldn't reproduce the error myself, it's hard to fix it.... Any hints on reproducing?. @javanan english please, so that everybody can participate.\n. The problem is that the hostname of the client isn't visible to the admin server in docker. Because one container is started before the other they can't see each others hostnames via /etc/hosts.\nA simple solution would be sticking to ip addresses instead, a complex solution would be to setup DNS for the docker hostnames.\nIn case you are using the spring boot admin client and a fat-jar deployment you just need to set spring.boot.admin.client.prefer-ip=true for using the ip addresses.. IIRC you can set these with zuul.host.connect-timeout-millis or zuul.host.socket-timeout-millis.\nBut I don't think this long running health check is not very desirable.\nDid you thought of doing the check itself periodically in a different thread and the indicator just returns the result form the last finished check? This way you get fast http responses and have a solution to throttle the checks in case the endpoint is hit very often.. togglz as well as ff4j have their own administration consoles. So I refuse to implement that in SBA.\nShowing informations from spring-cloud-commons /features can be integrated, but they are for informational purposes only.. We can discuss adding arbitrary links to the top navbar of Spring Boot Admin by configuration.. Implement a Notifier wich delegates to the SlackNotifier bean and just throw away the unwanted status changes.. Annotating your filteredNotifier bean with @Primary should do it.. Your client application needs to have spring cloud common included so that it hast the /env endpoint support the post method.\nHave a look at your /mappings endpoint of your client application. You should see something like this:\n```json\n\"{[/env],methods=[POST]}\": {\n\"bean\": \"endpointHandlerMapping\",\n\"method\": \"public java.lang.Object org.springframework.cloud.context.environment.EnvironmentManagerMvcEndpoint.value(java.util.Map)\"\n},\n\"{[/env/reset],methods=[POST]}\": {\n\"bean\": \"endpointHandlerMapping\",\n\"method\": \"public java.util.Map org.springframework.cloud.context.environment.EnvironmentManagerMvcEndpoint.reset()\"\n}\n``. Do you mean to have a separate application list views for each stage? \nSimply run a SBA server instance per stage. This way your SBA server gets staged too and has the same QA process as your other applications.. What's costly about it? \nMemorizing the urls? Put a reverse proxy (with url rewriting) in front!\nDeploying the applications? Automate it!. Or run a single SBA server for multiple environments. Include ainfo.env` property in the client applications so that the environment shows up in the application list and you can use the env as search string to filter the list.. > Ram, cpu etc. I know in most cases it's trivial, but starting a jvm for each instance can add up.\nHardware is cheap today. Also we run our SBA server with -Xmx256m which is really not much in my opinion.\n. Should be no problem to add your own controller and some template rendering stuff to achieve that.\nYou can use the ApplicationRegistry to obtain a Application instance and it's status.. Unfortunately as it turns out there is a problem with security and how we detect the presence of a heapdump endpoint: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/7720. Did you check your /env endpoint that the values are really set? . I tried using your application.yml and the spring-boot-admin-sample-1.4.4.jar from http://repo1.maven.org. The application registers using your config. \nCan you reproduce the error outside of CF? If yes can you provide me a sample project to reproduce the problem?. Also you could check the /configprops endpoint to see which values get actually bound to the AdminClientProperties.. The service-url is just informational.\nSo when I get it right you solved the issue yourself? Can we close the issue?. When I checkout your project, remove the service-url from the client-a/src/main/resources/application.yml and run client-a using spring-boot:run the application registers itself as intended:\nlog\n2016-12-20 06:24:02.582  INFO 24293 --- [gistrationTask1] d.c.b.a.services.ApplicationRegistrator  : Application registered itself as {managementUrl=https://client-a.cfapps.io, healthUrl=https://client-a.cfapps.io/health, serviceUrl=http://johannes-XPS:8080, name=client-a, id=38aee2c5, statusInfo={status=UP, timestamp=1482211429432}}\nI don't see any problem here that needs to be fixed...?. Ok now I tried to deploy your project using PCF Dev on my local machine.\nYour projects contain an application.yml and an empty application.properties. I deleted the latter one.\nWhen I use following application.yml for client-a, everything works as expected - I can hardly find any problem which needs to be fixed. \nyml\nspring:\n  application:\n    name: client-a\n  boot:\n    admin:\n      url: https://spring-admin-server.local.pcfdev.io\n      client:\n         health-url: https://${vcap.application.uris[0]}/health\n         management-url: https://${vcap.application.uris[0]}\nIs it possible that on your first try the application.yml was incorrect?. ?The sample you provided was a boot application...?\n\n...still using GUID as the url for serviceUr ... app is being deployed to Tomcat and service-url required in application.yml\n\nHmm I don't get it. When you doing a war deployment the url isn't computed by SBA client... and you need to specify it so, where should the GUID come from?. So should I be able to reproduce the problem using PCF Dev and your github repository?. > have you a pivotal web services account?\nNo unfortunately not.. When the service-/health-/managment-url are not configured explicit, they're \"guessed\" for fat-jar boot applications based on InetAdress.getLocalHost() / server.adress /  server.port / server.context-path.\nThis is described in the Docs and is done by the ApplicationFactory.\nAnd also it's intended behaviour.\nAt first I thought that you said the health- and management-url are guessed even though you specified them explicitly. If this is not the case, then everything works as expected. Or do you have an enhancement to propose?. There seems to be an error while copying the binary images and fonts. Unfortunately I don't own a Windows machine and I can't reproduce the error...,. You're possbily hitting https://github.com/webpack/file-loader/issues/101. Maybe I've spotted the error in using / as path separator. Could you try the build using the following webpack.config.js ? Please tell me if that works?\n. I reopened the issue and fixed the webpackconfig so that the ui should build on posix and windows systems.. In case you are using the Spring Cloud Turbine server it will discover the Hystrix applications via the DiscoveryClient (even non eureka).\nAlso your implementation will only work if Turbine is integrated in the SBA server...\n... and has no use for Turbine Stream.\nSo I'm currently really hesitating on adding this enhancement to SBA.. By default the zuul proxy inside SBA removes sensitive headers and don't passes 'em along. Setting zuul.sensitiveHeaders= to empty should help.. Applications are identified by their health-url so for each unique url there will be an entry in the list.\nI guess your application was restarted running on a new host? (Unfortunately you scratched the hostnames, but I can understand that. Are they exact the same?)\nIn case you are using SBA Client:\n * The instances aren't removed on shutdown per default. If you wish that the application deregisters automatically set spring.boot.admin.auto-deregistration=true.\n * If you really think, the same process registers twice please read through your client application's log for the registration message appearing more than once and compare the used health-urls. The service url is displayed in the list. Did you check that the health-url is the same too? Since the Id is a hash of the health url, and the ids differ in your screenshot the health-urls should differ too.... The InetAdress tries to resolve the address for your hostname... and fails.\nYou could set server.address to the ip address where your server is reachable so that the resolution for your hostname doesn't happen. (SBA Client >= 1.4.3 needed). Closed with 900c53a9b230db101ed11d27d9302d04a90f419f. Which version of Spring Boot and Spring Cloud are you using?\nCan you please provide me your full pom.xml ?. Which branch are you using? Looks like a duplicate of #363 which has been recently fixed on the master branch.. duplicate of #341 . The ui does some long polling on this endpoint. The default timeout is 30s for the async request. After the timeout the ui does a reconnect. So you don't need to worry about this. You can try to set spring.mvc.async.request-timeout=-1 and see if the message disappears.. Note that spring.boot.admin.turbine.url is replaced by spring.boot.admin.turbine.location.\n. Selected  85cea18 for cherry-picking into 1.4.x. Duplicate of #359. I can't understand Chinese. Please use English or I can't help you.. Closed due to missing feedback.. PRs are always welcome\ud83d\ude09. Please try using java8 and the mavenwrapper from the repo.... I use jdk8 with a source and target for 7.... OK I've got the same error. Since master is built against boot 1.5.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT it's most likely due to a dependency update.\nI'll dig into this and will push an update.. The login module is part of the 1.5.0 release which is scheduled end of January (after the Boot 1.5 release.) . But there are snapshot builds available.... @mstommes we need to postpone the spring boot admin 1.5 release after Feb. 17, since we depend on the spring cloud dalston release.. Hmm... I just digged into spring-cloud-netflix zuul's semantics of ignored services and they do a simple matching using org.springframework.util.PatternMatchUtils#simpleMatch().\nDo we need full blown regexes or should we align with 'em?. Merged with some slight modifications (removed guava, changed docs).. See my answer in #350. Did you try updating to a more recent version of spring boot admin? We won't do any updates on 1.3.x. Which version of spring boot actuator are you using in your client application?. Your /health endpiont renders the wrong format. It should look like this:\njson\n{\n  \"status\": \"UP\",\n  \"diskSpace\": {\n    \"status\": \"UP\",\n    \"total\": 498971181056,\n    \"free\": 423447494656,\n    \"threshold\": 10485760\n  },\n  \"hystrix\": { \n    \"status\": \"UP\"\n  }\n}\nNote the missing \"code\" and \"description\" inside \"status\".. Selected  5c90f47 for cherry-picking into 1.4.x. Merged with some changes (no org.json.simple, improved tests).. It's a networking error. Make sure the admin server can reach your clients on the registered url.. You currently can't turn of these requests... But this shouldn't affect the\nui.\nCan you provide some sample json for /metrics from the network-tab in your\nbrowsers dev-tools.\nSometime it happens that the json get rendered wrong from the acutator\nendpoints depending on your Jackson config....\n. Yep, your JSON has the wrong format. The {\"LinkedHashMap\": must not appear.\nYou can try setting the management.port different to the server.port. IIRC this should result in a nested ApplicationContext for the actuator endpoints using their own converters..... I think so. Please consult the spring boot reference guide on this.. If you want to see this happen you need to do it yourself. Any help and PRs are appreciated. I have too limited time to dig into this.. Showing code is always appreciated :)\nI wonder if we can make the collect-server use the ApplicationRegistry as source for collecting, so that sba-client and discovery are both supported..... There is now a solution for writing 3rd party view modules and also the backend is extensible. Therefore this integration should be developed as a 3rd party module (if ever done). Looks good so far. Did you check your application.prooerties is configured correctly for consul? Did you have a look at our consul-sample? Have you checked that the admin registers itself correctly at consul?. >  will check and get back to you.\nSo does everything work now? Can I close the issue?. Closing after a week without feedback.. Did you have a look at the current sba 1.50-SNAPSHOT and it's sample?\nIt now has a story for security included, also have a look at the according docs.\nIIRC there are several ways on using keycloack (oauth, jwt, servlet filter) but since sba is a \"simple\" webapp all should do it. I've also setup some (older) examples on how to integrate different security solutions (but none using keycloak).... The propertyname is correct. What do you mean by 'missing'?\nIf just the metadata is missing it should work anyway.... I'll reopen it to fix the metadata.. Are you using the latest 1.4.5? Should have been fixed with #347. Works for me with 1.4.5.. May be you get an old version from your browser's cache?\n\n. Currently you can only copy the sources from the spring-boot-admin-ui module, modify and build the module and use this to replace the original one.. The following is active until you scroll. If you zoom in, it might happen that a scroll event occurs.\nYou can see that the following is active when the \"Follow\" button is blue. You can just activate the follow after zooming in.. I turned on follow hit ctrl + '+' multiple times. And hit follow again.... There is no spring boot actuator endpoint to provide that. So we can't implement that.. > The newer versions use the ApplicationFactory interface, so in the future it may make sense to make a custom CloudFoundryApplicationFactory to autowire those custom values.\nPRs welcome!\n@ashwgupt Does @abracadv8's comment help you solving the problem? . Did someone tryspring.boot.admin.client.prefer-ip=true without any other modifications as it is sugegsted for docker?. @ashwgupt so can you show us some sample config?. Hmm I expected that you'd use the CloudFoundry Env-Variables.... Ok. That's really simple. I don't think I'll add myself a ApplicationFactory for this. But if someone wants to submit a PR its welcome.. The error is ok. The HEAD request is done to detect the spring cloud /refresh endpoint. The error occurs if it is not present.. Is there some error logged either from the zuul proxy inside the admin server or the application itself ?. duplicate of #394 .

Hmm I'd rather tend to add a assertion to the filteringNotifier that the delegate must not be null. And also let the FilteringNotifier extend AbstractEventNotifier. We could also remove the @ConditionalOnProperty(prefix = \"spring.boot.admin.notify.slack\", name = \"enabled\", matchIfMissing = true) from the slackNotifier bean (and the other notifier beans). > Can I assist you with an MR ?\nsure. Help is always welcome.. @rfelgent Are you working on a PR?. cherry-picked c410be8 for 1.4.x. Are you using Spring Cloud Camden.SR5?. Your error is related to https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/issues/1663. At best you downgrade to Boot 1.4.4 in your Spring Boot Admin Server (and don't override the spring cloud version we depend on). I don't recommend to run SBA Server on Boot 1.5.x, since we don't test and support that. The SBA 1.5.x release will be out end Feb, when Spring Cloud Dalston is released.. Just realized that we ship our won version of the SimpleHostRoutingFilter.... Could you try a 1.4.6-SNAPSHOT from\nxml\n<snapshotRepository>\n <id>sonatype-nexus-snapshots</id>\n <name>Sonatype Nexus Snapshots</name>\n <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>\n</snapshotRepository>. It is, but for what purpose?. Ok. That's just what i imagined, you want to do. :)\nDo you want to submit a PR? - Should be just a simple getter.... f1aaf770c51e72f97499bb6834e6142967b69c01. You either need to build the full project (including the npm builds) or configure the snapshot mirror:\n<snapshotRepository>\n <id>sonatype-nexus-snapshots</id>\n <name>Sonatype Nexus Snapshots</name>\n <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>\n</snapshotRepository>\nOr just don't use the SNAPSHOT and use the latest release (1.4.5). SBA Server 1.4.x ist not compatible with Spring Boot 1.5. We'll release SBA 1.5.0 end Feb.. Weird. Are you using Discover additional to spring-boot-admin-starter-client?. Either you should use @DiscoveryClient in your admin server and clients\n or\n add the spring-boot-admin-starter-client to your clients \nbut not both, that's why your application gets registered twice. One time via discovery second time via the SBA client.... The spring-boot-admin-starter-client does a registering POST requests every 30s by default. I have no idea why they all reregister at 12 AM... Eventually your operators restart the apps every night from a different host or such? I guess the easiest way to find out is to do some network traces to find out who sends the requests.... @SoberChina you must not use spring-boot-admin-starter-client and spring-cloud-discovery at the same time, just choose one of them!. This would result in the ApplicationContext being serialized in some JSON Endpoints, so we can't do it that way. You need to Implement ApplicationEventListener<PayloadApplicationEvent<ClientApplicationEvent>>.. Works for me. Please note that SBA Server 1.4.x is not compatible with Boot 1.5. Please switch to Boot 1.4.4. SBA 1.4.5 will be out in hopefully out end Feb.. @aschneid75 then you could try our 1.5.0-SNAPSHOT. 1.4.6 should work with Boot 1.5.6 if and Camden.SR5 or -6 but not with Dalston.... 1.4.6 is not compatible with dalston! you have to use the unreleased 1.5.0 of sba. First, i strongly recommend not to include the admin into your business stuff. It can lead to unwanted side effects)\nSecond Spring Boot Admin doesn't needs a DiscoveryClientRouteLocator and hence doesn't instantiates it (and never did). There are two flavors of Zuul, a simple (see ZuulConfiguration) and the discovery one (see ZuulProxyConfiguration). \nSpring Boot Admin only imports the former one.\nIf you need a discovery based Zuul you really should run it as separate application.. I don't think so. I don't want to include stuff I don't need, since it has to be tested and increases the surface. Also the default setup of SBA has no DiscoveryClient included.\nYou can try and add the @EnableZuulProxy config. Could be working due to the CompositeRouteLocator. But I don't give you any guarantees \ud83d\ude04 . You're right it's the max heap not the max memory for the whole jvm. I'll remove the labels. You need to follow all steps from the guide http://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/1.4.5/#_hystrix_ui_module. For the planned release date please look at the corresponding milestone (see https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/milestones). But please mind that we depend on the Spring Cloud Dalston release - if it gets postponed, I have to adapt the schedule.\nThe Docs from the current 1.5.0-SNAPSHOT are here: http://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/1.5.0-SNAPSHOT/\nThe 1.5.0-SNAPSHOT artifacts are not available on maven central, but here:\nxml\n<snapshotRepository>\n <id>sonatype-nexus-snapshots</id>\n <name>Sonatype Nexus Snapshots</name>\n <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>\n</snapshotRepository>. duplicate of #305 . @rpahli First of all thank you for your PR.\nI merged it into master (as currently no further 1.4.x release is scheduled) with 764bf72071e86f4780d4b3475604b6f489130709.\nI renamed hostUrl to just url.\n. Just hit the follow button and you'll jump to the bottom.. Your description seems incomplete, as the last sentence is incomplete.. duplicate of #238. Is your client a boot 1.5. application? If I recall correctly the format has changed with 1.5.\nThere is a fix in our master branch. You could try a 1.5. snapshot.\n. duplicate of #371 \nIf ain't so - give me a hint.. Doesn't setting the standard jvm system properties http.proxyHost and http.proxyPort work?. you could set the http.nonProxyHostsas well. Or instantiate the slackbean yourself and set a custom configured RestTemplate.. I'll keep the issue - may be we'll support this sometimes ootb.. Yes using multiple slack notifier beans. Define the configuration properties binding at the bean level yourself using another prefix.. It should, by using the composite notifier. . Thanks a lot for your PR. I think it's a useful addition. Could you do the requested changes from the review?. merged with 11ca47c62923b9db2c589d8e551dc2f5c26e591d. Thanks for your contribution!. Which version are you using?. With 1.4.6 the healthCheckUrl is used as health-url and the homePageUrl as management-url (plus some settings inside the admin server)...\nSo I don't really quite get how you get a good manamgent-url. The metadata-map is only respected by sba for 1.5.x.\nAt best you debug into the EurekaServiceInstanceConverter in your sba admin server..... > But why did you use homePageUrl for the management-url? I think it will be better if you take the statusPageUrl and if null take the homePageUrl.\nThe default value for the statusPageUrl is the /info endpoint. This wouldn't work out in the default setup.\nWith SBA 1.5.x things should improve since we support the metadata-map...\nI'm closing this issue right now since your problem is resolved.. Unfortunatly we depend on the Spring Cloud Dalston.RELEASE, which hasn't happened yet and the current schedule is unkown. I've reopened the milestone and postpone the release to end of march.. Merged with d880eb85dc3633ab69c1d9e0f0680bfb196f9515. Are you sure a JavaMailSender Bean exists in your ApplicationContext?. do you have a sample project to reproduce?. Thanks for providing the sample project.\nWhen I run your project using the Prod profile the doNotify() for the MailNotifier is executed perfectly. I couldn't find any issue, therefore I close this issue. Did you check you mail config and the mail-servers logs?. The project provided by you hasn't spring.cloud.config.discovery.enabled=false set, so it defaults to true and everything worked properly for me.. When disabling discovery no application is registered... If no application is registered there is no application going down to notify about...\nI'm very confused about your expectations..... If discovery is disabled there is nothing to notify about.... The applications are identified by their health-url. You need to make sure that both applications have unique ones. They must not reqister with their load-balanced address.. Do you have any findings or further questions?. Sorry, but I can't provide you an AWS example since I don't use it. Do you understand the described  prerequisites from my earlier post?\nYou need do register every instance with a non-load-balanced address.. from our gitter:\n\n@snakey1980 If anyone is interested, I got an AWS ECS multi instance set up working with the new awsvpc network style for tasks https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html. On the SBA client side I had to use the prefer-ip setting and manually pass the IP address (i.e. -Dserver.address=) to the Java process, it couldn't figure out IP or hostname on its own. To be clear SBA works fine here, all these workarounds are for ECS. You need to make sure that your homePageUrl in Eureka is correct. Please have a look at the spring cloud documentation  for that.. @selimok yeah would be really nice. But wee need first a spring boot actuator endpoint that provides the data. Have you filed an issue for Spring Boot?. do you have a screenshot?. Looking better than I imagined from your description. PR welcome!. Did you ensure that Zuul doesn't filter the authorized header? Have a look at http://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/1.4.6/#_securing_client_s_actuator_endpoints. ...oh there is a typo in the docs it must read zuul.sensitiveHeaders... . Hmm... how the sba knows which instances are available and what value to put in the corresponding header?. Currently there is no feature like that (as we don't use cf currently). But if you do a PR on it I'm keen on merging it.. You can achive that using the current SBA version by following some easy steps: \n\n\nConfigure the clients to submit their cf-app-instance id in the metadata\nAdd your own implementation of the ApplicationIdGenerator to the server. It should take the id from the metadata into account \nAdd your own implementation of the HttpHeadersProvider to the server which sets theX-CF-AP-INSTANCE header. Nice to hear about! Would you like to share the implementation and a small guide for the docs via PR?. @ankurkaps wanna share your implementation for this?. Hmm I guess you can't use the @Value because, there is no BeanPostProcessor which resolves this annotation (as the environment is still in instantiation). Get rid of the three fields and extract the values inside the postProcessEnvironment() from the environment parameter.. Are you sure the correct management-url gets registered in spring boot admin? Looks like the admin get's a 404 from your application.. is that url also reachable for the admin server? did you append a /info to the url an can you see the json?. I guess your JBoss is issueing the 404. Are you sure all paths are setup correctly? . you need to make sure that spring-cloud-context is on your classpath. The Environment Manager is shown when the /env-endpoint of the monitored application supports the POST verb, which is enabled via an actuator endpoint from spring cloud context.... You should use SBA 1.5.0 and set management.portand management.context-path for the metadataMap of your instance... see http://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/1.5.0/#_serviceinstanceconverter Table 5 Instance metadata options. Still works for me using the 1.5.0...\n\nAre there any errors in the browser's console?. closing due to missing feedback. @cabbonizio do yo have any further information?. the filtering is a full-text search on each element of the json-array returned by the /api/applications endpoint.... It's standard behaviour that all discovered services appear in the health endpoint from spring boot. I guess we need to restrict the search here a bit.. @cabbonizio could you try the 1.5.1-SNAPSHOT?. The build wasn't triggered. I fixed this. the Snapshot should be available in about 1 hour.. It's now rendered either with name or title and the type, also all attributes from the name are shown. Example:\n\n. The datasource metrics are provided by the DataSourcePublicMetrics from the PublicMetricsAutoConfiguration. If your DataSource is still a bean, the information should still appear. The information is taken from the /metricsactuator endpoint. Make sure it's listed there. This is not a Spring Boot Admin issue. It's related to Spring Boot Actuator.. Which version of spring boot admin are you using?\nYou could set the logginglevel for de.codecentric.boot.admin.registry.StatusUpdater to TRACE for the admin server an see if the status update is performed.\nAre you sure it wasn't just a browser issue and hit refresh?\n. Any exception in the log? \nThe update interval is configured by spring.boot.admin.monitor.period and spring.boot.admin.monitor.status-lifetime both defaults to 10s. so any logs? Did your network-topology changed over night?. Most of your services are registered and unregistered in a very short time (less than 5minutes) looks weird to me...\n. Yeah that's exactly what's intended. Do you really think it should be in the docs - I don't. Isn't this trivial?. First of all, thanks for your PR.\nI wonder if the solution has to be this complicated? Why don't we just introduce an option in the UI to show all metrics and not only the gauge.* and counter.* ones.\nAdditional, I think it's a bad idea to extend the Application model - your solution won't work for those who use the DiscoveryClient. I thinks it's better to put those config into the metadata, which can also be set when using discovery.. I tend to the easier solution and simply show all metrics.. Spring boot has the option to use rich-gauges which provide min/max/avg/... and these are rendered as bars with some additional marks.. When showing all metrics on the page, please consider a search input for filtering the metrics.... @ctoestreich are you still working on this PR?. looking good so far. I'll have a deeper look next weekend.. Merged with 82d707e6fc3a77b07880d566110c0478265cea71. \nI did modify the filtering to behave like the one on the environment page.\nThank you for contributing to this project!. Did you update the ui jar? Did you try clearing your browser cache?. can you please set the logger for org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate to debug and post the log details (headers + body). Is your request sent via a proxy?. I'm closing this issue due to missing feedback. The current version works for me.\nAt best you provide a sample project to reproduce the error or at least some more information.. @w3blogfr thanks for investigating this issue. I'll have a look at your PR. looks good so far. I'll hope to find the time to merge it this weekend.. Merged with b9b97677ae7b4fb36b06d6b0b7d01af7be24633b. Thanks for your contribution!\nI did remove your changes from the details-module. The button is always shown for the details, so marking the module as unavailable has no effect. What I did instead (with a8355c92238026f8821aa19f11493ba33988deeb) is to hide the sections from the details view which rely on the metrics.. I guess you are using the latest 1.5.0?\nAre you sure it's not just a leftover (in case your app was previously configured without https)?\nThe sba-client computes the url from your boot-config. The computation should always yield the same result and it, shouldn't register your application twice. Please remove the instance and watchout if it shows up again... @ExtremeYu You must use either on of the DiscoveryClient implementations or the sba-client, but you must not use both. If you already use the DiscoveryClient for your applications, I'd suggest you just remove the sba-client from all your apps.. You can't. This usually happens when the reciever of the http response closes the tcp session before having recieved all data and the server wants to send the next bytes.. You could turn the JavaMelodyConfiguration into an autoconfiguration and include it (as I did in the tubrine module). Sorry for coming back to this PR this late. Looking good so far. I left you some comments on minor issues. coul you also add a short chapter to the docs on how to use this module?. Sorry I'm currently short on time. And currently want to invest the spare time into the adaption of spring boot 2.0.. So will you rework the code for 2.x?. @evernat I guess (mostly) all of it has to be reworked. The ui is now using Vue instead of Angular and also the backend has now a slightly different domain model.. @evernat I do really like the fact that you published the module 1.5.x as external module, as it doesn't adds the burden of maintaining this on me.\nOnce https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/issues/683 is resolved I'd like to go down this route for 2.0.x as well. Do you agree, so that I can close this PR?. Thats ok. This is how the UI checks for the available endpoints. If you get a 404 on these the according sections are hidden.. This only makes sense if you use the corresponding tools eg hystrix, flyway, liquibase... \nBut this is described in our reference guide. Could you elaborate a bit more on the problem you're trying to solve?\nWhat I get: You can now use the sba-ui-turbine module without using the discovery client. For each application name a turbine cluster is \"setup\"?. What if I want every application to show up in the default or a group chosen by prefix?\nIf I recall correctly the turbine from spring cloud offers such feature... should we support that as well?. @jmirc are you still working on this PR?. \ud83d\ude22\nEnjoy your vacation!. can you provide a sample to reproduce the problem?\nI guess your client sends a wrong request. Do you have any logs from the sba server?. SBA uses zuul internally. Also server and client is separated. If you also want to monitor the sba server itself, it needs either the sba client or a DiscoveryClient implementation.. could you please set the loglevel for  de.codecentric.boot.admin.discovery.DefaultServiceInstanceConverter to DEBUG and post the logging output?. closed due to missing feedback.. merged with 230896f0a840371f65a1c2b2ed56dd9b16ed106e. Thanks for contributing!. You're using the wrong version of spring-cloud. Please don't override the version sba depend on.. Looks like one registration is with the hostname an one with the ip... \ncan you show me the code of your admin_server?. Your project works correctly on my machine. Maybe there is a second application from another machine registering at your admin?\nOr the call to InetAddress.getLocalHost().getCanonicalHostName() doesn't always return the same value on your machine... you could try to avoid that by setting spring.boot.admin.client.prefer-ip=true.\nOr you tap the wire with tcpdump/wireshark and look where the requests come from.... Because your eureka config is possibly wrong. Has nothing todo with SBA.. No we currently don't. But would indeed a nice feature. We're currently running Spring Boot Admin and Spring Batch Admin as separate apps.. Sounds quite reasonable to add some properties to configure the timeouts. \nFor now as a workaround you just need to instantiate the ~StatusUpdater~ ApplicationOperations with a properly configured RestTemplate yourself.. Did you have a look at the admin server logs? It should give you some hints why they are classified as offline. You could write a delegating notifier which only tiggers the delegate when the offline/down status wasn't resolved after a period of time.... The data is taken directly from the metrics endpoint. Your problem is related to the spring boot actuator. Not spring boot admin. the master will switch to boot 2.0 when rc1 of it is published\n.. Due date for the spring boot RC1 is January 25... \n. will merge joshiste/spring-boot-admin/2.x probably next week. spring-boot-admin-server-ui is in there. What are you missing?. > @joshiste can you please elaborate how to use spring-boot-admin-starter-client for spring-boot 2.0.RC1? Client stopped working after updating to 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT\nAll properties for the client were moved to spring.boot.admin.client.* so your properties need to be moved.. > JIC: has to add compile 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web' , because spring-boot-admin-server 2.x uses spring-webflux (not using spring-web transitively), so my\nYes. We need the WebClient from webflux. So you know should explicitely choose the reactive or serlvet starter and choose. Currently both variants are supported on the admin server.. p.s. sorry for the outdated docs. Any help appreciated :). p.s. ui-hystrix, ui-turbine and ui-activiti modules were removed...\nLogin is integrated into the ui module as I expect everyone to need it.\nCurrently only 5% of the core-ui downloads uses the uiactivitu as well - so I'm not planning on reimplementing this for 2.0\nAround 25% is using the ui-hystrix so this on my to do list.... @firegnome you have to use the BUILD-SNAPSHOT \nafaik currently there is no cloud MS/RC based on boot.RC1 so we have to use the snapshot. no RCs just SNAPSHOTs. \noss sonatype has no milestone repos.. The Finchley.RELEASE has been postponed to May 14.\n:(. The Finchley.RELEASE was postponed to June 13, 2018 \n\ud83d\ude2d . I'll investigate if a release without the spring-cloud part is viable. @Hronom \nhttps://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/milestones. @n0mer No. But with 2.0.2 we have support for custom ui modules. So it would be possible to write a  community extension as standalone project.. Since this PR is only half of the work I close it in favor of the issue #465. First of all your work isn't lost... since you got yourself a branch you can work on. \nMy personal opinion: a PR says 'look what i've finished - here is my code - do you want to integrate it in your project after revising ?'.\nBut this PR is far away from being done and has more the notion of 'Look here - wouldn't be this a nice thing to do? Should we work on it?' That's what issues are....\nIf you want to invite others to work with you on your branch you can tell them in the issue...\nAdditionally to that I already have a branch to work on 2.x and this PR is not even half the work...\nIt just fixes the compile issues but leaves things out as:\n - Spring Cloud for Spring Boot 2.x (afaik they not started the work yet)\n - Support reactive (non servlet) web-applications (by now the actuator doesn't work for reactive apps). \n- Changes in the Actuator endpoints\n. As I'm working on my free time for that I can't give you any timeline. I've currently have a local branch for 2.0 which I'll merge into master, when boot 2.0.0.RC1 is out.. SBA depends on Jackson for the Rest-Interface and the Jackson-MessageConverter must be used.. Afaik the spring boot keycloak integration is using spring security - so this should be possible, but I can't give you any good examples. If you have concrete questions feel free to ask in out gitter channel.. Looks like spring security is doing a redirect for the POST to /api/applications. So you should tell the SBA client the username and password (using spring.boot.admin.username and spring.boot.admin.password) for this http endpoint or allow requests without credentials for this endpoint.. It looks like your /heatlh endpoint is responding html instead of json. You'll need to fix this.. you should always align server-ui and server versions... \nAlso you should really go for the 1.5.1\nThis also needs you to update to spring boot 1.5. and spring cloud dalston... \nFor the compile error you are pointing, I guess you're using the wrong spring cloud version.. @bbaiggey see https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/issues/657#issuecomment-396177252. Looks like your client application is responding with the wrong content-type. this bug is was introduced with #398 in 1.5.1.... fixed with 1.5.2. I just hit the release button. Should be synced to maven central soon.. Thanks for the report. Could you try printing the thread name additional to your \"Hello world!\"? I the name is prefixed with registrationTask your scheduled method picks up the registrationTaskScheduler from SBA client.... So basically it's always a good idea to configure a TaskScheduler when using @EnableSchduling...\nYour TaskScheduler is picked up because of the name...\nFrom the Spring code:\nMore than one TaskScheduler bean exists within the context, and none is named 'taskScheduler'. Mark one of them as primary or name it 'taskScheduler' (possibly as an alias); or implement the SchedulingConfigurer interface and call ScheduledTaskRegistrar#setScheduler explicitly within the configureTasks() callback\nSince the scheduler provided by the SBA client is very similiar to the default one from @EnableScheduling and doesn't interfere when you are providing a custom one, I tend to not fix this issue.. you can query the /api/applications endpoint. Sample output:\n```\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": \"a973ff14\",\n    \"name\": \"spring-boot-admin-sample\",\n    \"managementUrl\": \"http:\\/\\/localhost:8080\\/actuator\",\n    \"healthUrl\": \"http:\\/\\/localhost:8080\\/actuator\\/health\",\n    \"serviceUrl\": \"http:\\/\\/localhost:8080\",\n    \"statusInfo\": {\n      \"status\": \"UP\",\n      \"timestamp\": 1498742746715,\n      \"details\": {\n        \"hystrix\": {\n          \"status\": \"UP\"\n        },\n        \"diskSpace\": {\n          \"status\": \"UP\",\n          \"total\": 498971181056,\n          \"free\": 331413581824,\n          \"threshold\": 10485760\n        },\n        \"status\": \"UP\",\n        \"refreshScope\": {\n          \"status\": \"UP\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"source\": \"http-api\",\n    \"metadata\": {\n},\n\"info\": {\n  \"scm-url\": \"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/codecentric\\/spring-boot-admin\\/spring-boot-admin-samples\\/spring-boot-admin-sample\",\n  \"build-url\": \"http:\\/\\/travis-ci.org\\/@env.TRAVIS_REPO_SLUG@\\/builds\\/@env.TRAVIS_BUILD_ID@\",\n  \"stage\": \"test\",\n  \"git\": {\n    \"commit\": {\n      \"time\": 1498385072000,\n      \"id\": \"650dd7e\"\n    },\n    \"branch\": \"master\"\n  },\n  \"build\": {\n    \"version\": \"1.5.3-SNAPSHOT\",\n    \"artifact\": \"spring-boot-admin-sample\",\n    \"name\": \"spring-boot-admin-sample\",\n    \"group\": \"de.codecentric\",\n    \"time\": 1498736845000\n  }\n}\n\n}\n]\n``. your ui build failed. you need nodejs and npm. I guess it's because the 68529299456 won't fit into an int. Try to add a Jackson ObjectMapper using theDeserializationFeature.USE_LONG_FOR_INTSenabled.. for example by setting:spring.jackson.deserialization.USE_LONG_FOR_INTS=true. Ok I figured out that jackson automatically switches to longs if the numbers are too big. Have you tried to debug this? Is the Json output you've posted exactly the answer the sba server gets? Or have you obtained it some other way?. closing due to missing feedback. You need to implement aNotifierwhich does the counting and filtering and delegates to the mail notifier. . spring boot already has this included: http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.5.3.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-metrics. You could just add your own implementation of the ApplicationFactory instead of this nasty hack. If you wan't to provide a PR to add this feature you're welcome.. @sddakoty  Hmm how do you know the port your tomcat ist listening on? Usuallyserver.port/local.server.portisn't set for war-file deployments.... \nWith this commit two new properties were added to ease the client\nconfiguration when used in servlet containers:spring.boot.admin.client.management-base-urlandspring.boot.admin.client.service-base-url`. Both properties can be used\nto specify protocol, host and port for the urls. The paths will still be\nguessed and appended to the base-urls. Additionally the servlet context\npath is not read from the properties but from the ServletContext itself.\n. You're right currently the logout uses absolute path's. I think we can improve here.. Hmm I wonder if we should really limit the number of attempts? What happens if the admin comes back online after the retries are exceeded? Wouldn't it be more convenient to implement an (exponential?) increasing backoff time?\n. Or is it just about the log warnings. We could log the first failure with WARN and every succeeding with DEBUG level?\n. I've opted in to degrade the loglevel on subsequent registration failures.. quite usual when your application doesn't respond in time. Maybe your health indicators are taking to long?. Basically you're telling (or at least your exception is), that your health endpoint of one of your services is not reachable. (also your failed curl is). This doesn't affect the startup of spring boot admin.. Hmm the getter is missing. Should be just a warning in your Editor. The property should work anyway.. The values shown in the ui are fetched via the zuul proxy. You can use zuul.host.socket-timeout-millis (default: 10000) and zuul.host.connect-timeout-millis (default: 2000) to control these timeouts.\nBut you should better fix your slow /health responses, as they are made quite often.. As described in http://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/1.5.2/#_serviceinstanceconverter this can be configured via the instance metadata. This way you get a per-instance config.. Do you have any exeption/error in the spring boot admin and/or turbine\nserver log?\n. I can't read chinese but as far as google translator tells me I guess the host isn't reachable. Also what's the difference in configuration between the first and the second screenshot?. so you are putting the sba behind a additional zuul or how do I misunderstand?\nZuul is having issues with long running https responses like these for the hystrix dashboard. So if the direct access is working for you please use that.. You can achieve that by a smart combination of the RemindingNotifier and FilteringNotifier\nYou need to build a notifier chain like that: RemindingNotifier --> FilteringNotifier --> MailNotifier.\nThe RemindingNotifier will resend notifications as long as the application is not up again. The FilteringNotifierwill throw them away while the filter is active. A filter can be set via the REST-api - which you need to do before the deployment and either you let the filter expire automatically or you need remove the filter after the deployment. If the application is back up before the filter expires you get no notification, but if the application doesn't come back online you will recieve notifications repeatedly until the application is back up again.. it is.. \nhttp://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/1.5.2/#filtering-notifications\n\nThis examples combines the reminding and filtering notifiers. This allows you to get notifications after the deployed applications hasn\u2019t restarted in a certain amount of time (until the filter expires).\n\nmay be it should be more emphasized. Hmm that would lead to late notifications. At best you implement a DelayingNotifier which implements your desired behaviour and delegates to a real notifier (may be a look into the RemindingNotifier does help) . And when you're finished and would like to see this feature in SBA included - submit a PR ;). You can change the interval via spring.boot.admin.monitor.period (default: 10000ms). This would make it less likely but wouldn't totally prevent your application found offline - or you would need to sync your deployment with the health-checks.. If the period is expired SBA is about to query all registered applications, except those whose status-lifetime hasn't expired. When an application registers in between a \"full run\", it's status is checked immediately and on the next run it's most likely to be ignored since the status-lifetime hasn't expired.. yes. The spring boot admin server relies on the jackson2 object mapper. Did you configure any other library for the json deserialization? Please provide a sample project to reproduce the issue.. Afaik the messageconverter should be configured using a WebConfigurer. You can disable the endpoints in your client application if you don't want them to appear in the admin server.. Which version are of sba are you using?\nIf you want to use eureka, you should omit the spring.boot.admin.url.\nFor the https to work correctly with eureka you also need to configure it properly: \nhttp://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-netflix/1.3.1.RELEASE/#_registering_a_secure_application. So please fix your eureka setup.. The spring.boot.admin.client.* properties aren't taken into account when you are using eureka. You need to set the management.context-path / management.porton your eureka instance metadata (see http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-netflix/1.3.1.RELEASE/#_eureka_metadata_for_instances_and_clients and http://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/1.5.2/#spring-cloud-discovery-support) \n. As I said you need to set eureka.instance.metadata-map.management.context-path and eureka.instance.metadata-map.management.context-port. The metadata options are in the guide. There is no section on how to add metadata to eureka - since there are many spring cloud discovery client implementations. That's why I've posted two links  which just need to be read carefully.. merged with 21082226904b0a4e651bb0ba9daf94c7029b4a9e. For non-boot applications you can only get health-monitoring. For this you need to do a POST request to /api/applications containing an json-object with the fields name and healthUrl.\nOr you need to implement http endpoints compatible to the spring-boot-actuator's endpoints .... Could you post a stacktrace? Which version are you using?\n. closing due to missing feedback. @jumkey A hostname component must not start with a digit!\nTherefore server.1 is not recognized as hostname but as authority.\nSee the BNF for URLs as defined by the W3C: https://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/5_BNF.html. The  MailNotifier only has the properties to,cc,from,text,subject all other properties are not present. So I guess gmail doesn't accepts your mail because of missing credentials.. For spring boot admin 1.5.x you need to use spring boot 1.5. You are using 1.4.x.. If you are not using boot the autoconfig doesn't kick in automatically - so the application won't register itself. You need to instantiate all facilities from SpringBootAdminClientAutoConfiguration. With prefer-ip you get the local ip. Your container doesn't know about your host-ip, so there is no way the sba client could know about it...\nI'd suggest that you update to 1.5.3 and use the spring.boot.admin.client.service-base-url property and set it to your docker host address (via env-vars).. you need to set the env var SPRING_BOOT_ADMIN_CLIENT_SERVICE_BASE_URL=http://<yourdockerhost>:<mapped-port>\non your docker container. I rarely can't provide you the values and please read the docker docs on how to obtain the values and set env-vars.. If you hover with the mouse over the status on the journal page you should get some info.. If you query the rest endpoint behind that view you should get them as well.. The info on the overview page is fetched by the backend and only updated when the status changes. So if your deployment doesn't trigger a status change the info isn't updated. There are two ways to circumvent this:\nEither you deregister and register your application explicitly or you setup a scheduled task which invokes the InfoUpdaterexplictly.. closing in the favor of the PR. Currently there are no integration test for the client. But the drop in coverage is acceptable to me.. Please add a section in the docs for the new property. This should be enough.\n. merged with 3dd252d90a03e87b256c200dc32a0d4ae523e47b. You need a unique health url for each underlying node. SBA identifies the applications via their health-url and also need those to query each nodes' health.. You need to specify the custom context path in the eureka instance metadata. All options are documented here http://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/1.5.3/#_converting_serviceinstances_into_monitored_applications (see Table 4.). did you check who is issuing the requests?. So apparently you solved your issue. Any findings you want to share?. SBA uses Netflix Zuul which in turn uses Servo where the error originates from. So I can't provide you any fix.\nBut having a quick look at the DynamicCounter class, I'd say Permission java.util.PropertyPermission \"*\", \"read\" should do it. Or just allow the read permission for the properties in question\n com.netflix.servo.monitor.DynamicCounter.expiration and com.netflix.servo.monitor.DynamicCounter.expirationUnit. SBA uses HEAD requests to determine the availability of the endpoints. If your application responses with a 200 for a GET and a 405 for a HEAD-request it doesn't comply to the HTTP-Spec.\nSo basically you should allow the HEAD requests for your client applications.. Using the SBA client you can deregister the application on shutdown using spring.boot.admin.auto-deregistration=true and if you're using some kind of DiscoveryClient the stale applications should get removed automatically.. Instead of opening a new issue you just could havre simply reopenend the last one.\nWhich version of Spring Boot are you using? Please provide a sample Project to reproduce the issue.. Generating a spring boot 1.4.x application on http://start.spring.io with web+actuator and doing HEAD requests to /env and /metrcis totally works for me. The issue must be your configuration.\n```\n$ curl -I -vv http://localhost:8080/metrics\n   Trying ::1...\n TCP_NODELAY set\n* Connected to localhost (::1) port 8080 (#0)\n\nHEAD /metrics HTTP/1.1\nHost: localhost:8080\nUser-Agent: curl/7.54.0\nAccept: /\n< HTTP/1.1 200\nHTTP/1.1 200\n< X-Application-Context: application\nX-Application-Context: application\n< Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8\nContent-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8\n< Content-Length: 623\nContent-Length: 623\n< Date: Fri, 18 Aug 2017 04:21:34 GMT\nDate: Fri, 18 Aug 2017 04:21:34 GMT\n```\n\nSo please provide a sample project (and with this I mean code) to reproduce the issue.. Please give any feeback within 3 day or I'll close this issue.. You need to configure the JavaMailSender using the spring.mail.* properties. See http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.5.6.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-email. For having mail notifiactions you need to configure a JavaMailSender. See http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.5.6.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-email. when running as war the server.port and -adress is not taken into account by spring boot. So you need to then the spring.boot.admin.service-base-url to the address where your tomcat is running. SBA determines the availability of the endpoints by doing HEAD requests.\nIf these HEAD requests fail the corresponding tabs are hidden. So you need to figure out why these HEAD requests fail.... It shouldn't. Did you have a look in the browser's network console for errors?\n. There is a example security config in the reference guide. If Spring Boot Actuator 1.3.x doesn't support the HEAD request you could put a servlet filter in front... or update your application?. You could add a zuul filter to sba that handles theses HEAD requests.... There aren't any google analytics in Spring Boot Admin. So why do you think there are?. Closing due to missing feedback.. merged with fd596efb3dce0d68b767ed601b6562c4e2819842. Thanks for contribution!. Yes indeed. The description is gone missing.. I'll target that for the next release. @frkautz Did you have a look into the jolokia response if the description is provided by jolokia? (and made sure you didn't had an old version from browser cache)?. Spring Boot Admin should not influence your logback config.\nDid you have a look at this Spring Boot Issue https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/1434 ?. spring.boot.admin.auto-deregistration must be set on the client side and relies on proper shutdown of the application context.. The traces are just taken from the /traces endpoint of the application, so no persistence involved.\nIf you want to persist the traces i suppose you should implement you own TracesRepository for spring boot. But may be it's just easier to log each request into a logfile.. q1: SBA does not include such a functionality. You could write a scheduled tasks that removes offline instances from the application registry. \nq2: the notifiers are just reacting on a status change. Deregistration is not a status change, but you can extend the notifier and override the shouldNotify method to act on a deregistration event.. Headers provided by your custom HttpHeadersProvider implementation should be included in every request... So this should basically work. May be you can provide a sample project so i can figure it out?. after 9 days without feedback I close the issue. I guess you could solve your problem.. I guess something went wrong when you've fetched all the dependencies. Try cleaning your local maven repository and start over again. It works for the Travis CI build and on my machine.. You need to install yarn on your machine for building the UI. You can use it with spring only. But:\n1) your monitored applications must provide the spring boot actuator endpoints (or at least a heatlth check endpoint)\n2) If you want to use the SBA client you would need to apply the AutoConfiguration yourself\n. SBA uses Server Sent Events for notifications and status updates. The error you are getting is related to Spring's SSE implementation and does occur when the request times out. You don't need to worry about it.. The http request for just times out. There is nothing you can do about...\n\nIs there some configuration missing on WL?\n\nI am not familiar with WL - so I cant tell...\nThere has been some similar issue #317  with running on tomcat. But adding a ExceptionHandler resolved that. If you really want to resolve this problem I guess there is no way around for you than to dig deeper into that. You should look into the Spring Framework's issue tracker if someone else reported similar issues with timeouts on server sent events or try to reproduce it.\n. Either you implement the JournaledEventStore interface with your custom implementation. Or you tell your SBA Server to use Hazelcast and configure Hazelcast to persist the data on disk. How to use Hazelcast with SBA is described in the docs and for the Hazelcast configuration itself please have a look at the Hazelcast's documentation.. Best way to resolve this is not to include your monitoring server into your business application. Make two separate applications out of it and SBA can't corrupt your application.. > do you mean to host both webapps on different servers?\nI just meant that you should use two separate spring boot apps: one for your business and one for monitoring.\nAfter re-reading your issue, I don't find any clue how this relates to spring boot admin.... When using Eureka Spring Boot Admin uses the EurekaServiceInstanceConverter to register the applications. This converter takes the healthCheckUrl from Eureka into account, that's why all other endpoints are working except for health. The healthCheckUrl is defaulted in spring cloud netflix. Please check your eureka registry server if the correct url has been registered.\nYou can enforce SBA to ignore the healthCheckUrl by adding a DefaultServiceInstanceConverter explicitly to your SBA server, which ignores the healthCheckUrl.. 1. Please use english\n2. Just posting a Stacktrace is a bit odd.\n3. If you are looking close enough to your logs, you'll see that you get a NPE from Hibernate - I don't see any relation to Spring Boot Admin\n4. You really should not include your monitoring application in your business application.. One ThreadLocal warning is an error in spring cloud netflix and I've submitted an issue: https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/issues/2283\nThe other warning is a bug in our OptionsDispatchingZuulController. It looks like we can get rid of it, but I need to do some investigation on that...\nAnd currently I've no idea where the expiringMap-0 thread is spawned..... You should either register the services via eureka or via sba client. But you must not use both at the same time.. Could you please provide a sample project for me to reproduce the issue?. Closed due to missing feedback. Somehow the admin responses with content-type text/html. Do you have any proxies / servlet filters / security (or something else) in between that gives the wrong response? Did you investigate the response?. @czhmzwlaoda the problem is not that the GET to http://domain/notify/health is responded with text/html but the POST to http://domain/springbootadmin/api/applications. So you've investigated the wrong url.. Did you try from your client's machine?. So maybe the best is that you tap the wire using tcpdum to look at the response your client applicaiton is getting.. closed due to missing feedback. Did you see https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/blob/master/spring-boot-admin-server-ui-turbine/src/main/java/spring/boot/admin/turbine/config/TurbineProperties.java ?. Yeah the ui will always use this URL, which is a Zuul route.... If you still want to customize the ui code the url is coded here: https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/blob/cfad8fe71cfad8a46955f2d3c785c5b825d8775d/spring-boot-admin-server-ui-turbine/src/main/webpack/turbineCtrl.js#L42. As we don't use Discord chat, it will never be on our agenda. But if you submit a PR adding the feature I'll have a look into merging that.. You can customize the default text using spring.boot.admin.notify.mail.text.  You can access the status details via #{to.details}. the SpEL expression is correct. I just returns a Map<String, Serializable> and not a string as you expected... So you need to convert the map with the details to aString.... toString() ???. As you can see from your String the exception is inside the map ... you just need to transform it correctly to a String.\nMaybe this is to complex for SpEL and you should override the getText() method in MailNotifier. Spring Boot Admin uses the Spring Cloud's DiscoveryClient interface. This interface defines two methods:\n```java\n    /*\n     * Get all ServiceInstances associated with a particular serviceId\n     * @param serviceId the serviceId to query\n     * @return a List of ServiceInstance\n     /\n    List getInstances(String serviceId);\n/**\n * @return all known service ids\n */\nList<String> getServices();\n\n```\nThe ApplicationDiscoveryListener uses the getServices to get all services and getInstancesto retrieve all instances for each service. Which imho is totally compliant to the interface.\nIt doesn't know anything about eureka and how you registered your services.\nImho if you have problems when spring.application.name is not equal to eureka.instance.appName it's a spring-cloud-netflix-issue (or your config maybe wrong?). (And also I don't get why you want two different names for the same application). ah ok. Good to know! \ud83d\udc4d . So when you have a 500 there should also be an exception either in the admin's or application's log (probably with a stacktrace...). Did you have a look in there?. Does you build fail? I guess it's from one of the tests and can be ignored.... > They are all running non web context's. Does this library support non web.\nNo. You need to provide the actuator endpoints via http.. you can exclude the SpringBootAdminClientAutoConfiguration and configure the components yourself.... Same problem as in #514: for performance reasons the info (for the application list) is cached on the server side and currently only refreshed when the application status changes...\nMay be we need to rethink the invalidation strategy.... In case you use the sba client you can use the auto-deregistration feature as a workaround.. Currently there isn't and it's not on the todo list. Imho you better setup a admin server for each user group. A client application is capable of registering at multiple admin servers (either with SBA client or using a discovery implementattion). Or you implement your own ApplicationController and a ZuulFilter which take account for the reduced visibility.. This error appears when the client can't figure out the port of your web application. SBA client only supports web applications and when you do a war-file deployment you must tell the client where your application is running via setting spring.boot.admin.client.management-base-url. Ok I can see the issue. Would you like to make a fixing PR for 1.5.x? Otherwise I'm afraid that I can't fix this before a 2.x.. I guess the metric is incorrectly recognized as rich gauge. Since the metrics endpoint has totally changed with spring boot 2.x I don't want to put much effort in this issue, but if you want to submit a  PR fixing this issue, I'll have a look into it - otherwise I'll close this issue and won't fix it.. Ok I can see the issue, but I don't think this fix will make it into a 1.5.x version as the UI will get an overhaul for 2.x.. This is not a SBA issue. The password is published by the underlying /jolokia endpoint.\nIIRC jolokia itself has some configuration options to restrict the access.. SBA 1.5.4 is built against Dalston.SR3 ... . As the log level can be for your application via jmx or via the rest endpoint (not necessarily invoked via SBA), I'd say it would be better to log that information not in the SBA server but the application itself....\n. As stated before imho the audit log should be written by the client applications and not the server as the config can be changed without sba. Also sba already has a view for showing audit events... It just not centralised.... Is it just the wish to aggregate across all your applications? \nHow do you approach this for your application audit log or logfile?. FYI: With SBA 2.0 implementing this yourself has become a breeze:\njava\n    @Bean\n    public InstanceExchangeFilterFunction auditLog() {\n        return (instance, request, next) -> {\n            if (HttpMethod.DELETE.equals(request.method()) || HttpMethod.POST.equals(request.method())) {\n                log.info(\"{} for {} on {}\", request.method(), instance.getId(), request.url());\n            }\n            return next.exchange(request);\n        };\n    }\n2018-02-23 08:55:47.880  INFO 52824 --- [io-9090-exec-10] d.c.b.admin.SpringBootAdminApplication   : POST for ba3d5d66fc2a on loggers/de.codecentric.boot.admin.client.config.SpringBootAdminClientEnabledCondition\n2018-02-23 08:55:48.274  INFO 52824 --- [nio-9090-exec-8] d.c.b.admin.SpringBootAdminApplication   : POST for ba3d5d66fc2a on loggers/de.codecentric.boot.admin.client.config.SpringBootAdminClientEnabledCondition\n2018-02-23 08:55:48.892  INFO 52824 --- [nio-9090-exec-1] d.c.b.admin.SpringBootAdminApplication   : POST for ba3d5d66fc2a on loggers/de.codecentric.boot.admin.SpringBootAdminApplication. This is no SBA issue. You need to configure your discovery clients to register with the https scheme:\nspring.cloud.consul.discovery.scheme=https. Please update to 1.5.x. With #349 there has been a improvement reducing the requests made by the UI, which improved performance siginificant.. The ui does some HEAD requests to figure out which endpoints are available and activates those. It appears that older Spring Boot 1.3.x applications are not responding correctly to those requests.. I guess it's the same as in https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/issues/527. Please have a look at https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/issues/478 I guess you are facing the same issue. > but for the other profile https://myService/api/manage/metrics is hit and 401 error is thrown.\nIf your application itself issues a 401, you really need to debug you spring security config. This is no issue for SBA.. both are valid properties for different purposes. the docs are correct.. did you check the sba server's log for any exception?. You need to add your CA that signed your certificate to your keystore. This is not a SBA problem. There are plenty of guides on the web for that (e.g. http://magicmonster.com/kb/prg/java/ssl/pkix_path_building_failed.html). did you check what the /flyway endpoint of your application gives you?. So when the endpoint just gives you a single datasource SBA can\u2019t show you all..... afaik there was an issue for that in boot 1.5.x\n. >These are in containers so the PaaS might just be doing a hard terminate on the container process\nYeah, I guess the applications are forced to quit, so that they can't deregister themselves.\nYou should be able to figure out in the logs if your application was shutdown clean or not.\nSomething like Closing org.springframework.boot.context.embedded.AnnotationConfigEmbeddedWebApplicationContext@48f2bd5bshould show up.\nI run some apps (boot 1.5) in a docker container (without a scheduler). 99% of the times instances deregister themselves when stopping the container; only in case of a hard killed container the applications remains registered.\n\nIf so, perhaps it would be useful to have a purge job running in the admin that could be set to sweep dead apps after X hours for example.\n\nShould be no problem that you add a scheduled task to your admin removing offline applications after a certain amount of time. But currently I don't want to add this as a feature.. closed in favor of SO. Why do you include the starter in non-web-applications?\n. >as non web app on a random port\nisn't that contradictory?\nOk. Got you point. As a workaround you can disable the client using a property.. merged with 8143743d9ef985fb10b3fcb7635bc869bb514610. Thx for contributing!. Did you check the SBA servers log for exceptions? Offline means that no connection could be established... I guess you haven\u2019t a valid certificate path. Next time please use StackOverflow for questions.. Yes SBA is capable of handling https. Please refer to the corresponding manuals for eureka / consul on setting up https. The SBA client uses https if you configure via the spring boot options.... As the DumpEndpoint (ThreadDumpEndpoint in boot 2.0) just spills out the java.lang.management.ThreadInfo which doesn't contain any information about daemon/non-deamon,\n we can't provide such info in the ui.. Did you check the SBA server logs for exceptions?. Please look into the docs (and the samples)\n. hmm ... so how does this relate to spring boot admin?. So can I close this issue?. so @slyoldfox's comment didn't has something to do with your issue? So what's this issue is about? Adding a swagger ui for the sba server's endpoint?\n. so @ctoestreich? did you read my last comment?. hmm is there a spring boot actuator endpoint for swagger? The url must reside on the management port.. > However, it is still possible to create custom Actuator endpoint for Swagger, that is exposed on the management port.\nYeah, but SBA shouldn't depend on everyone implementing it the same way...\nAnd currently providing extra actuator endpoints is out of scope for SBA. >  Maybe actuator should get a swagger module first, then it might make sense to embed a copy of swagger-ui in SBA.\nI totally agree. I guess you are using the wrong port if the connection is refused\n. you have a mistake in the URL:\nhttp://ibmt460pc0k53na/:8008/api/applications\nshould read as\nhttp://ibmt460pc0k53na:8008/api/applications\nnote the superfluous / before the port 8008. your yaml to configure the eureka client is imho wrong indented. Did you check the registration information which comes from the eureka server?. closed due to missing feedback. SBA use the heap value as max from the MemoryUsage-MBean's getMax() method.\nThe MemoryUsage Mbean doesn't tell if it is unbounded or not.\nFrom the Java doc:\n\nmax | represents the maximum amount of memory (in bytes) that can be used for memory management. Its value may be undefined. The maximum amount of memory may change over time if defined. The amount of used and committed memory will always be less than or equal to\u00a0max\u00a0if\u00a0max\u00a0is defined. A memory allocation may fail if it attempts to increase the used memory such that\u00a0used > committed\u00a0even if\u00a0used <= max\u00a0would still be true (for example, when the system is low on virtual memory).\n\nUnfortunately there is no info available if the maximum is unbounded or not. So we can't decide on that.\n. Which version are you using?. Are you sure your request is from a GET on the /api/applications?\nAs Jackson tries do deserialize some data, I guess you're trying to do a POST.... Hmm the only failure here is that a 400 Bad request should have been returned.. Hmm still pondering on this. In general it would be useful to have some checkstyle checks, but just a single rule is a bit too little or not?. Addes some more rules and merged with 69980a8d8481835eea83fc1e0578a7b5e6d6e164. The user.password is hidden in the response via the Jackson deserializer. And the admin won't use the USER_PASSWORD  - so why don't you just remove it?\nWhen querying the /api/applications endpoint on the sba-server the metadata is also shown - the user.password is also hidden there (by the jackson deserializer).\nSo I would encourage you to remove the USER_PASSWORD from the metadata.\nWe should make the sanitizing in https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/blob/master/spring-boot-admin-server/src/main/java/de/codecentric/boot/admin/model/Application.java#L308 ignoring the case - and  make the keys to sanitize configurable.\nAlso The client doesn't need the full answer - We should just return the id.. Just released 1.5.5 containing the fixes / enhancements. Thanks for your contribution. I left some comments in my review. Do you have a screenshot of what such a message would look like?. I'll try to merge this next week. Do you already run this Notifier yourself in some setup?. cleaned up the code and added the missing docs. Merged with 9bf54c32768db6d4b23be832c8b56d6d4be46a41. I don't want to disappoint you, but I'm already working on an 2.x branch in \nhttps://github.com/joshiste/spring-boot-admin/tree/2.x \n. duplicate of #99 . duplicate of #465 . I'll have a look if I can push out a release this weekend. The release containing this fix was published.. I guess you are facing the same issue as in https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/issues/478#issuecomment-311749930. Spring boot Admin 1.5.x is only able to run with servlet web applications. With 2.x there will be support for reactive web applications. \nBut please keep in mind that SBA needs the actuator endpoints to be accessible via HTTP - that's why only servlet based applications are supported in the past.... 1. You should be able to remove the instance by issueing a DELETE /api/applications/{id}\n2. When you are using discovery the ApplicationDiscoveryListener should keep the registered instances in sync with your service registry. So if you remove the application in the service registry it should disappear in spring boot admin.. If you are using the spring-boot-starter-parent as parent or import spring-boot-dependencies as bom - the spring boot admin client should not influence the chosen spring boot version.\nThere is a whole chapter for this in the spring boot reference guide: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-boot-build-systems.html. Did your sba successfully register with the eureka server? are there any errors in the logs?. closed due to missing feedback. You just need to implement the Notifier interface to your custom needs.. Imho you should do a InfluxDB/Graphite/Prometheus setup if you want to aggregate metrics. I consider this currently out of scope. Hmm looks like your browser serializes the date to 2017-12-13T14:01:00 0000 which should have been 2017-12-13T14:01:00+0000 (note the +).\nFor me this works on my machine. What browser are you using and what is your timezone?\nCan you tell me what new Date().toISOString() evaluates to? (please try out in your browser's console). Hmm I can't see why it shouldn't work - and it works on my machine. Do you have any custom settings in the admin regarding jackson's time deserialization? Could you provide a project to reproduce the issue. The date conversion doesn't accept aZfor timezone only a+0000. And this is just what the current ui implementation uses. \nAdditional to that for me it works using an embedded tomcat8.5.23. So maybe you've misconfigured some filters that the url is decoded twice. \nI currently don't consider this as a bug of spring boot admin.. duplicates #597 . @jmardis10 as @viruscamp has shown it's possible to inject your own headers into the requests made to the clients.\nIf it's about user authentication theAuthorization-Header from the browser can be passed along to the clients, if you configure zuul to do so byzuul.sensitiveHeaders=. But keep in mind that the server itself is doing requests to/healthand/infoand needs also to authenticate somehow.. With 1.5.4 we updated to Spring Cloud Dalston.SR3 and in 1.5.5 to Dalston.SR4. If iirc there was a breaking change in SR3. Please make sure you are using the correct version of Spring Cloud. duplicates #597. For adding custom HTTP-Headers you just need to provide an implementation of theHttpHeaderProvider` interface.. The information you provided is not endough to reproduce the issue. At best you provide a sample project to reproduce the error, at least tell me which version of spring boot admin, spring boot and spring cloud you are using. . closed due to missing feedback. merged with 37ec7d221a5fda5037029e7298da07eb7a30257d. Which version of SBA you are using?. for sba 1.5.5 you need to use spring cloud dalston SR4\nfor sba 1.5.6 you need to use spring cloud edgware. I'm no expert for hazelcast, but I don't see why it shouldn't work. . > is SBA expecting the multiple nodes on same server?\nNo.\nThe datastore is just switched to hazelcast and so all of hazelcast's replication mechanisms are supported. If you can't use multicast so that the hazelcast instances can find each other you need to use some other option (e.g. integrating eureka, or just use a list of fixed addresses to bootstrap). Did you set the spring.boot.admin.context-path for your sba server? you need to change the spring.boot.admin.url accordingly. closed due to missing feedback. you need to add the spring-boot-starter-security to your dependencies.. > The application log tab always shows the entire log file.\nThis is not quite correct. Only the last 307200 bytes are requested with the range header.\n\nIs there a way to show logs starting from the moment this tab is opened?\n\nCurrently not and I guess most of the uses want to see what happened before.. Currently not. Why do you want to?. in 2.0 the logview jumps straight to the end... so you don't need to scroll anymore.. https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/blob/master/spring-boot-admin-starter-client/src/main/java/de/codecentric/boot/admin/client/registration/ApplicationFactory.java. SBA is capable of monitoring via https. The urls wich are used to registrer at the sba server have to be set accordingly and the certificate must be valid. \nIn case you are using SBA client, you can use spring.boot.admin.client.* properties to influence the url computation. With great power comes great responsibility....\nYou already could use a custom login page showing this warning.... doesn't look like an SBA bug to me, as the SBA doesn't contain a ServletContextInitializer.\nAnyway I won't do fixes for a 1.2.x. finchley is based on boot 2 so for me this is  a duplicate of #465 . closed in favour of the PR #625 . The root-parent still imports Boot's and Cloud's dependencyManagement and so it's still contained in the bom's  dependencyManagement. Isn't that (according to @snicoll) to be avoided?\nI guess we have to split up the client into a starter-pom-module and a client-jar-module:\npom structure (not necessarily folders):\nspring-boot-admin\n +-- sba-dependencies (containing the sba dep. manamgement only)\n +-- sba-starter-server (pom just declaring dependencies)\n +-- sba-starter-client (pom just declaring dependencies)\n +-- sba-build (importing spring-boot-dependencies and spring-boot-admin-dependencies)\n     +-- sba-client\n     +-- sba-server\n     +-- sba-server-ui\n     +-- sba-...\n +-- sba-samples\nalso I guess the pluginManagament is just a boot copy and contains a lot we don't need (e.g. jooq)\ncorrect?. I've merged the changes with 840b910d952f54f8c5b9fce78b9c152417d1ffc4 and a cleanup in 895bc6b4c7d073e1223abac58b05e67719bd455d. I haven't yet renamed the starters. if you are using eureka you need to fix your eureka config... can't help you with that. did you have a look into your browser's console? Have an eye on XHR errors. closed du to missing feedback. By default SBA expects a turbine server running registered with the service name turbine. Try submitting application/json and not form-data. The SpringBootAdminClientAutoConfiguration picks up the RestTemplateBuilder so your interceptor will be used by the SBA client. If you want to prevent this, instantiate the ApplicationRegistrator your self with a RestTemplate not using your interceptor.. the data element is superfluous in the response. Do you have any ControllerAdvice or ServletFilter active, that is adding this element?. closed due to missing feedback. Please try using your first config and add a eureka.instance.healthCheckUrl=http://${MS_HOST}:${MS_PORT}/health property. \nExplanation:\nWhen using Eureka the SBA uses the EurekaServiceInstanceConverter which uses the healthCheckUrl the service was registered with. And I guess your service just registers with the wrong url (please check in your eureka registry)\n. Master has now switched to 2.x so you need to update this PR...\n... and since the UI got a complete make over this means a bit more work .... So will you rework the code for 2.x?. @bas-jan any progress on this?. closed due to missing feedback. it uses the address the hostname resolves to (InetAddress.getLocalHost()) if you want to use some other address you can set the server.addressproperty.. which version are you using?\nDid you check if SBA is adding the authorization header? Is your spring security config correct?. looking good so far. closed du to missing feedback. Why you want to do that? If the zuul is essential for your system - please run it seperate.. You can register a non-Boot application with a POST to /api/applications and only providing a name and healthUrl and SBA will monitor ist.\nexample request:\njson\n{ \"name\" : \"my-node\", \"healthUrl\":\"http://mynodehost/health\"}\nThe monitored applications need to respond with a 200 when everything is ok and a 5xx if otherwise.. What type of metadata you want to display? Can you give me some example?\nImho we should not add a additional column to the application list. Would it be enough to display it in the details view?. if you want to see this happen soon please submit a PR.. closed with #645. with 19baa38e4c9e68b8e039f61a8e6c66903e24c478 the version for the application list is taken from the metadata as well.  Either the key version or build.version must be present in the metadata.. \nI don't have a Openshift/Kubernetes installation at hand, so you have to track down the issue with me together. \nPlease set the de.codecentric.boot.admin.discovery.ApplicationDiscoveryListener logger to DEBUG and add the output to this issue. \nAre you sure your SBA server is correctly connected to the registry / all you clients are?\n\nit keeps reporting an instance as down when a new replica was started on a different IP.\n\nWhen the instance is removed from the service registry it also deregisters in SBA (when using discovery).\nIn case you are using the SBA client you can configure it to auto-deregister on shutdown. \n. Looking at the implementation, the problem is KubernetesDiscoveryClient doesn't publish HeartbeatEvents - so it's not a Spring Boot Admin issue.\nRaised https://github.com/fabric8io/spring-cloud-kubernetes/issues/92. The fabric8 project was moved to spring-cloud-incubator. I filed another issue: https://github.com/spring-cloud-incubator/spring-cloud-kubernetes/issues/150. I'm closing this issue as the spring-cloud-kubernetes project started working on this. Did you check the admins server's log? If an application is reported as offline the server can't reach the client and there should be an exception logged...\n. closed due to missing feedback. > Travis CI is failing with the modified branch.\nyeah it's due to changes in the snapshots for spring cloud. I've pushed the changes to master. If you rebase the build should pass.. merged with 1770b4c0a58ddf4761b7341dd9e1748794914306\n. version? is the EurekaClient bean present?. For adding additional headers just implement a HttpHeadersProvider. > jolokia endpoint is not present in client's /management/actuator\n\nthis is not an admin issue. It's a boot issue.\nthis has been fixed with https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/11902 in spring boot snapshot / rc2.. >jolokia is not enabled with webflux right?\n\nno. jolokia itself is servlet based, so it won't work on webflux using netty.. >Would you still prefer separate classes given the above?\nI'd still prefer different classes to separate concerns.  For hybrid environments we could instantiate them always. For the HeaderProvider this should be no problem. \nAlso we could just use the app_guid + \":\" + index without doing the hashing for CF instances...\nAddiotionally It would be nice if spring-boot-admin-clients would automatically add the metadata when running on CF. (may be this needs the concept for a MetadataContributor in the client project...). > Do you know if there is a method to instantiate with the hybrid one on runtime when detecting there is access from CF?\ndo you mean @ConditionalOnCloudPlatform(CloudPlatform.CLOUD_FOUNDRY)?. > I would like someone's advice.\n\n\nI'd rather use composition and not inheritance for the CloudFoundryInstanceIdGenerator. This allows to alter the fallback IdGenerator easily.\n\n\nThe CloudFoundryHttpHeaderProvider must not extend the BasicAuthHttpHeaderProvider. I just pushed a commit that allows multiple HttpHeadersProviders.\n\n\n\nBut I am not sure how to conditionally replace the autoconfiguration. Do I need to create a new autoconfiguration class for the hybrid version or can I modify the existing autoconfiguration class.\n\nI'd prefer to have it in a seperate AutoConfiguration as this makes it possible to easily disable it\n. > I am trying to figure out why AdminServerCloudFoundryAutoConfiguration is not run before AdminServerAutoConfiguration. \nI guess it's not run at all. Did you add an entry to the spring.factories ?. @tetsushiawano the DiscoveryClient for Cloudfoundry uses the applicationId and instanceId as metadata-keys (for the same information). It would useful to use the same keys, so we can support users using discovery on CF as well.. > I'm normally coding Ruby and don't have much experience with Springboot\nKudos for trying nonetheless and for contributing. @tetsushiawano I've just pushed the MetadataContributor to master. You just need to implement the interface and add it as bean.. oops sorry. pushed the wrong branch. It's now here https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/blob/master/spring-boot-admin-client/src/main/java/de/codecentric/boot/admin/client/registration/metadata/MetadataContributor.java. ad 1) Having service-base-url and auto-deregistration in the metadata has no effect...\nAlso as the DiscoveryClient's metadata is Map<String, String> I'd like to keep it this way.\nad 2) Basically you want to have different defaults for spring.boot.admin.client.server-base-url and ...auto-deregistration?. closed in favor of #655 . The samples already contain jolokia. I won't read the pasted code - it's too much to read as plain text. Either provide a zip file or a git repository that contains the project so that I can execute it.. Also your screenshot shows no registered application. You must fix that first.. https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/tree/1.5.x/spring-boot-admin-samples/spring-boot-admin-sample. For 1.x the ApplicationDiscoveryListener relies on the service name to be equal the application name. \nSo if you really wan't to alter the names you need to replace the ApplicationDiscoveryListener with a custom one. For 1.x I'll do only critical fixes. I consider this at best a minor bug if not an enhancement.\nWith Spring Boot Admin 2.x this problem does not occur - therefore I'm closing this issue as won't fix.. That's correct. looks good from my point of view. you should debug the EndpointWebMvcManagementContextConfiguration of spring boot if you're having problems. This is not a spring boot admin issue.. wrong repo. please file the issue in the sample repo. @tetsushiawano are you done with your changes? Or should I wait before looking into your changes deeply and merging?. @tetsushiawano I've already started to merge this. I'll take care of @shakuzen's comments.. Merged with 80eaf615029dfe67edacf345491ee22231a3ffdf. I'm a bit confused. Are you using the SBA client or a Spring Cloud DiscoveryClient? You really shouldn't use both.\n1) There is no spring.boot.admin.discovery.metadata.management.ssl.enabled or spring.boot.admin.discovery.metadata.management.ssl.enabled property.\n2) In case you are using spring-boot-admin-client\nIf you've set management.port you also need to use management.ssl.enabled=true and it should work out of the box.\n3) In case you are using some DiscoveryClient\nMake sure you configure the DiscoveryClient so that the application registers with the https scheme.\nFor eureka for example you need to configure eureka.instance.securePortEnabled and maybe eureka.instance.secureHealthCheckUrl.\n. It worked for my demo project. Did you check that the underlying endpoint is not just spilling out data every few minutes?. Yeah I guess we have to avoid the zuul for hystrix somehow.\nI'm not sure I'll fix this in 1.5.x as 2.x doesn't uses zuul anymore - but 2.x currently doesn't include hystrix (yet). Hmm the hystrix-dashboard has been moved to https://github.com/Netflix-Skunkworks/hystrix-dashboard and seems abandoned to me. I'm not keen on integrating this into 2.0.. Yeah it's possible to write a custom visualization for the /actuator/hystrix.stream data not relying on the hystrix-dashboard. PRs are any time welcome.. As there is no one fit's all solution, I implemented that the default value is chosen on whether an active CloudPlatform is present or not.. Hmm jolokia has the capaility of proxying requests for rmi connected jmx beans... May be you could setup a kind of sidecar which exposes the activeMq beans via jolokia.... We won't fix any minor issues for 1.5.x. Please check the 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT, it shouldn't have this issue.. Duplicates #657. It's due to zuul's incapability to handle the infinite chunked http-stream and therefore it's \"eating\" up the connections.. you need to use Spring Boot Admin 2.0.0 (currently only 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT available) for Spring Boot 2.0. http://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/1.5.7/#show-version-in-application-list. Please show me the output of /info. Which version of spring boot admin do you use? In 1.5.x there is an issue for the application list showing stale info... #556 . >  What is a bit confusing is on the instance info object there is a version property (that has been deprecated in our version on spring cloud) that is populated as \"unknown\" has this field been discarded for tracking service versions?\nSorry, but what are you referring to? SBA uses version or build.version from the /info-endpoint (in that order) for displaying the version - nothing else\n. you can't use Spring Boot Admin Client 1.5.7 with Spring Boot 2.0. You could try our 2.0.0-SNAPHSOT version.. can you show me the urls in the top-right of the details view?. closed du to missing feedback. How long is \"some time\" ?\n. Could you give me your memory limits -Xmx? . running on netty server or tomcat?. could you try with running on tomcat by explicitly including spring-boot-starter-web?. do you have the ui open all the time? I have the feeling that's somehow because of the infinite event stream..... can you tell me a bit about you usage? how many instances are registered in that application? Are you frequently restarting/redeploying the clients so that the registrations changes frequently?\n. @nomer good to know. could you tell us your -Xmx setting and the mem usage after a long uptime?. @nomer as we don't have a milestone repository there is no place to publish binaries..... @tetsushiawano did you check the logs for errors?. @didiez @tetsushiawano I did some load testing and couldn't find any memory leak. I guess I need more information about your setup (project, complete logs, jvm version, platform/infrastructure). As you probably doesn't want to make this sensitive information public, would you send me some email?. @shakuzen thanks for sharing. I had the leak detection active and there weren't any reports. I didn't observe the native memory directly but did a -Xmx128m which should also constraint the native memory or not?. I finally could track down the issue. -Dio.netty.leakDetectionLevel=paranoid helped. It turned out that the responses from the WebClient weren't always consumed and therefore the underlying buffers weren't released.. Which version of Spring Boot Admin are you using? Do you have this problem on client or server? \nWhat behaviour do yo expect? Fetching the config a once or never?\nCould you provide a sample to reproduce?. please provide a project (via zip or github-repo) to reproduce the problem, it saves me a lot of time.. The ConfigServerHealthIndicator (of spring-cloud-config) triggers a config fetch and caches it (by default for 5min).\nWhen you register your application at the SBA server, the server hits the /health endpoint frequently to check healthiness, therefore the ConfigServerHealthIndicator is triggered.\nI guess you just set health.config.time-to-live to a small value so the config is fetched on mostly every health check.. @Hronom then you need to provide a sample project to reprodue the issue, 'cause I couldn't and found no other explanation. Or you debug it yourself and look what triggers ConfigServicePropertySourceLocator#locate().. duplicates #465\nBecause SBA depends on spring cloud we can't release before spring-cloud-finchley.. Usually you don't writ color output to plain files. As the /logfile endpoint just serves the logfile as resources I don't expect it to contain ascii escapes..... p.s. PRs welcome :). I extended this issue to also add hyperlinks for everything that looks like an url.. If you use the spring boot admin client you just need to disable the auto-deregister property.. it will not be deregistered in the application list and shown as offline, this offline state triggers a notification.. you shouldn't mix eureka with sba client. In case you are using eureka you could extend ApplicationDiscoveryListener and remove the part where the stale applications get removed.\n. > Do I need to add to all spring-cloud-eureka clients @enablediscoveryclient(autoRegister = false)\nIs that correct?\nno. that's something different. The UI connects to an event-stream on the server, when this connection fails the banner is showing up. So I guess something is wrong with your application.\nThe event-stream sends pings at a fixed rate to the ui to keep up the connection from the stack trace i'd guess that project reactor doesn't have a appropriate thread pool to schedule those pings.\nCan you provide a sample project to reproduce the issue?. You asked in our gitter channel just a few minutes before and got a really quick response. There is no need to submit an issue asking a second time.\nSnapshots are available here: https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/. the spring.boot.admin.client.management-url seems not to be in effect, as the url looks totally different. are you sure you've configured everything properly? please have a look at the /env endpoint of your client application and look if it's set properly.. the spring.boot.admin.client aren't in there. It looks like you messed up your application.yml.\nFor the explanation of the properties please read the reference guide: https://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/1.5.7/. Thanks!. copy and modify sources from spring-boot-admin-server-ui-login and include your custom jar instead of ours.. SBA just can monitor the healthiness. So I suggest you add a custom HealthIndicator to your application,. The UI does hit the SBA server and not the registered instances. The XHR requests are resolved against the address the html file is served from.. duplicates #465. \ud83e\udd14 since we're just using spring cloud's facilities and do nothing special maybe you better ask there. Also I'm not very familiar with zookeeper....\n. When using non-default context-/servlet-path you need to set the metadata accordingly. See reference guide: http://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/1.5.7/#_converting_serviceinstances_into_monitored_applications. With Spring Boot 1.5.x and Spring Boot Admin 1.5.x Log4js is supported via the /loggers endpoint. @tetsushiawano if you want to try please sketch the solution first and let's discuss it.\n. @tetsushiawano do you have any outcomings so far?. Closed with 75a960a7e631def8d5e0536a2677b4a20ca152d7 and 1ebc75e90fac1f5713fff16867a444a5ede2151d\ndocs: http://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/current/#customizing-custom-views\n/cc @MrBW . as 2.0 uses eventsoucring, only the events have to be persisted..... you can't. resolving the root cause of the 500 should be a better option.. There is no limit that I'm aware of.\nAs the ui is completely re-written with 2.x and I haven't planned non-critical fixes for 1.5.x I'm closing this issue.. duplicates #465 . We published versions for boot 2 a long time ago. Merged  with 1283b1c1152f5a826932e0f61482627bbfab1228 and polished with 7e97009120ef2edf0c2a1783e69b59f5147d7b00. Sorry but I don't understand what's the issue here can you describe you problem in detail and provide a sample project to reproduce the issue?. @tjuchniewicz thanks fo the info. I'm closing this issue since we can't solve that here.. Please provide a project to reproduce the issue.\nThe most likely cause is that you've customized jackson in some incompatible way.\nThe NPE during the post is due to a missing 'name' attribute.. > i cannot reproduce the project... it's an existent Spring Boot application i added spring admin client to, same application works in local env with local SBA...\nI can't help you without reproducing the issue.. I won't do fixes for the old UI in 1.5.x and therefore close this issue...\nBtw the issue for hystrix is still unresolved according to the bugtracker. If your application stops responding the health-check should be triggered with the current implementation.\nIt's totally normal for applications to reach max heap - the problem is that it stays at max and gc is burning cpu. This is a rather difficult problem. In spring-boot#6988 a memory health indicator is proposed. This is in my opinion the way to go.. Look's good so far. I made some comments.. merged with 34d4f127b4734bfa108b9f0d968c459c6ddf7983. @matthjes Thanks for you feedback.\nFor the health section I agree with you that the current layout wastes space. We should address that.\nIIRC the cards in the old ui are also sometimes not well aligned. In your example they should align if the error messages disappears... The error message is caused by trying to fetch the systemload - which is not available on all platforms (as in your case) so we should fix that by ignoring the issue.\np.s. I hope you like the new ui in general despite the detail page, as there are lot of enhancements and new stuff on the other pages.... I've made some changes to the health section. It now looks like this:\n\n. Merged with c2b85bfb32553d4b51b47c0a08beb2f13e0f32b3. Thanks for contributing!. You need to use spring Boot 2.0.1. Any Error in the browser's console?\n. > @n0mer thanks for the hint! To add the dependencies for spring with Version 5.0.5 really did the trick!\nsounds like this issue is solved.. No it's not expected. Did you take a heap dump and inspected what's causing this issue?. Did you use a recent snapshot (including the fix for #666)?. @n0mer you can just download it via SBA. But please send it as a compressed file via mail since it may contain sensitive data.\nDid you check which snapshot version you are using?. >How is this MAX calculated in \"Memory: Non heap\" section?\nIt's the jvm.memory.max value from micrometer (which uses the MemoryPoolMXBean#getUsage().getMax() )\n\nsure - what e-mail address i should use?\n\nhttps://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/blob/master/pom.xml#L94. I guess it's the same underlying cause as in #713. Please try our latest snapshot.. Looks like the client can't resolve the local hostname. spring.boot.admin.client.instance.prefer-ip=true should do the trick.. same error?\n. Currently using an initial delay is not possible. You could implement this using a custom NotificationFilter for theFilteringNotifier or a custom Notifier.\n. check your spring-webflux version. Must be 5.0.5.RELEASE or higher. I guess the UNKNWON instance can't reach the application. You should have a look into the servers log.... So any findings in your logs?. closed due to missing feedback. what @shakuzen said - use boot 2.0.1 . I'll have a look on that. If I understand correctly, you're doing url rewriting?. The simplest way of achieving this with the current 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT is to not do url rewriting and setting a server.servlet.contetxt-path in addition. This way a request to /sba/ will be forwarded to /sba/.\nexcerpt from  application.properties:\nserver.servlet.context-path=/sba\nexcerpt from haproxy.cfg:\n```\nfrontend public\n    bind *:80\n    use_backend spring-boot-admin if { path_beg /sba/ }\n    default_backend default-backend\nbackend spring-boot-admin\n    server host 192.168.179.26:8080\n```. SBA depends on the spring cloud finchley release (which is currently scheduled for 30. April). For non-spring-boot processes you can just do simple health monitoring. The applications must provide a http endpoint for that.\nIn case you're using the mysql from you boot services the instance is monitored indirectly via the DataSourceHealthIndicator.. No. Most of the endpoints have a new layout. You need to update your server. \nYou can use old clients with a new server.. What did you expect?. Yeah the 2.0 version has too.\nWith spring boot you need to expose the actuator endpoints explicitly. Use management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*. The requests to actuator endpoints causes memory allocation and this in turn causes garbage collections which burn some CPU. I don't see a problem here as long as no memory is leaking...\nTo reduce the GC pressure, I've reduced the buffer size for the proxy requests. Previously 16K were initially allocated per requests. And the details page is doing a lot of requests. I've lowered the buffer size to 4K. Memory and GC usage should benefit from that.. This is a quite normal. The browser does some long polling and keeps the tcp connection open. If the browser window is closed the tcp connection is aborted and on the next write the exception is thrown. there is nothing to do about this, except changing the loglevel.\nsee also \nhttps://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-16688\nhttps://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-16528. The ui doesn't support CSRF you need to disable this in your security config. Please provide a github project which reproduces the issue\n. Error Fetching System Load failed: is totally fine and won't be shown in the ui as not every platform provides the system load metric. The weird NPE is fixed with https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/commit/553c88005ae0f25f18fa62ca902d8ed3a1864521. As Spring Boot Admin is like any other Spring Web Application you can configure OAuth2 the same way (as any other spring boot application).\nIf you need to pass along special headers when calling the actuator endpoints of the monitored instances you can write a HttpHeadersProvider. Either you make the container aware of his own hostname or you need to set either server.address or spring.boot.admin.client.service-base-url to a value where your admin server can reach the client.... I wonder wether the Eureka Client has the same issue... \nOtherwise we could just choose the first ip address from the NICs we find.... I guess you are using SBA 2? \nIt has currently no generic metric view implemented.. which version of SBA?\n. The UI uses the head request to determine the availability of spring cloud's enhanced /env endpoint. In 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT this mechanism has been reworked.. If you use any DiscoveryClient this button won't show up as the SBA can't deregister the application at the underlying service registry. The button only shows up when the application has been registered via the SBA client. This was fixed with 2.0.0 of SBA https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/issues/556. you need a custom ApplicationIdGenerator that takes the VCAP information into account. SBA 2.0.0 has a out of the box support for CF. You could try backporting the changes. from https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/commit/80eaf615029dfe67edacf345491ee22231a3ffdf. Please query the /applications endpoint from the SBA server. If the unwanted applications have (source = http-api) they are registered via the sba admin client. (what I guess is just the case here). Until now the metrics view is missing in SBA 2.0.0. Only some standard metrics are shown in the details  view.. I'm currently working on this, but I can't promise it to be included in the 2.0.0 release. closed by ec449eeb9dea801d3b98e42325ef5d3621398223 and ec449eeb9dea801d3b98e42325ef5d3621398223.

As last resort you could add a custom ServiceInstanceConverter to your SBA server which rewrites the URL.\np.s. please also make sure that there is no other error (e.g. invalid certificate chain) present.... sounds good..

Did you register it as bean? Have you debugged it?. closed due to missing feedback. 1. Please use english if you want me (and others) to follow the conversation - otherwise I can't help you.\n2. Please provide a sample project (as zip or github repo) to reproduce the issue. As Spring Cloud Finchley isn't released yet, the SBA 2.0.0 release doesn't include discovery support as noted here: https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/releases/tag/2.0.0\nIf you need Spring Cloud Finchley support you need to switch to our 2.0.1 snapshot version. The sample https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/tree/master/spring-boot-admin-samples/spring-boot-admin-sample-servlet contains a spring security config and also uses fixed username / password. It's essential to gain a bit of hazelcast knowledge. There is a sample for hazelcast https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/tree/master/spring-boot-admin-samples/spring-boot-admin-sample-hazelcast. The de.codecentric:spring-boot-admin-starter-server:2.0.1-SNAPSHOT includes the -cloud module as dependency. I suggest you use our starter and you don't need to include the dependency yourself. which endpoint are you referring to? all of 'em?. metrics are also broken for 1.5 as the endpoint has changed too much and can't be converted to the new format. I forgot to exclude the metrics for old applications.\nI'll take a look at what's wrong with env, threads and httptraces as they should work.. 1.4.x and older doesn't have the vendor content-type for spring boot actuator. We need to take plain json content type into account for the legacy converters. Works on my machine. Please provide a complete project (zip or github repo) to reproduce. \nAlso it's bad practice to choose a random port yourself - it could be already in use or belong to a range you are not allowed to use.\nYou better set server.port=0 so that the OS chooses a free port. This is not a spring boot admin issue. \nEureka is providing false information about the application.\nNext time please check your service registry before filing an issue for the wrong project:\nLog from started application CTN\nTomcat started on port(s): 43730 (http) with context path ''\nOutput from http://localhost:1110/eureka/apps\n{\n  \"applications\": {\n    \"versions__delta\": \"1\",\n    \"apps__hashcode\": \"UP_2_\",\n    \"application\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"XTRA-CLOUD-MONITOR-SERVER\",\n        ...\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"CTN\",\n        \"instance\": [\n          {\n            \"instanceId\": \"10.91.2.167:CTN:25167\",\n            \"hostName\": \"10.91.2.167\",\n            \"app\": \"CTN\",\n            \"ipAddr\": \"10.91.2.167\",\n            \"status\": \"UP\",\n            \"overriddenStatus\": \"UNKNOWN\",\n            \"port\": {\n              \"$\": 37693,\n              \"@enabled\": \"true\"\n            },\n            \"securePort\": {\n              \"$\": 443,\n              \"@enabled\": \"false\"\n            },\n            \"countryId\": 1,\n            \"dataCenterInfo\": {\n              \"@class\": \"com.netflix.appinfo.InstanceInfo$DefaultDataCenterInfo\",\n              \"name\": \"MyOwn\"\n            },\n            \"leaseInfo\": {\n              \"renewalIntervalInSecs\": 10,\n              \"durationInSecs\": 90,\n              \"registrationTimestamp\": 1527176083338,\n              \"lastRenewalTimestamp\": 1527176543377,\n              \"evictionTimestamp\": 0,\n              \"serviceUpTimestamp\": 1527176083339\n            },\n            \"metadata\": {\n              \"management.port\": \"37693\",\n              \"jmx.port\": \"63840\"\n            },\n            \"homePageUrl\": \"http://10.91.2.167:37693/\",\n            \"statusPageUrl\": \"http://10.91.2.167:37693/actuator/info\",\n            \"healthCheckUrl\": \"http://10.91.2.167:37693/actuator/health\",\n            \"vipAddress\": \"CTN\",\n            \"secureVipAddress\": \"CTN\",\n            \"isCoordinatingDiscoveryServer\": \"false\",\n            \"lastUpdatedTimestamp\": \"1527176083339\",\n            \"lastDirtyTimestamp\": \"1527176083098\",\n            \"actionType\": \"ADDED\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}. I think SBA should support the default format for actuator endpoints. It would be too tedious to support two formats in the UI.\nWhen https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/12951 is resolved you could configure the objectMapper for the business components without affecting the actuator endpoint.\nUntil then one option (when using SBA 2.0) is to implement a InstanceExchangeFilterFunction which converts the snake-case to camel-case for the ui.\nOr you don't reconfigure the global ObjectMapper in Spring Boot but add a HttpMessageConverter which uses snake case and is only active for your business endpoints. Examples for that can be found here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43079892. https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/12951 is still unresolved..... If you add this:\n@Bean\n    public MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter actuatorHttpMessageConverter() {\n        MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter converter = new MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter(\n            Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder.json().featuresToDisable(WRITE_DATES_AS_TIMESTAMPS).build());\n        converter.setSupportedMediaTypes(\n            Collections.singletonList(MediaType.parseMediaType(ActuatorMediaType.V2_JSON)));\n        return converter;\n    }\nto your client applications, the actuator endpoints are serialized not with the \"global\" object mapper and thus are not affected by the SNAKE_CASE naming.. As spring-boot-admin-server-cloud is depending on Spring Cloud Finchley which isn't released yet I had to remove the module for the 2.0.0 release. \nEither you use our 2.0.1-SNAPSHOT version or wait for the 2.0.1 release which will follow close to the Finchley release and will include support for it.. duplicates #751 . does it appear in the /actuator index of your application?. including flyway?. > all shows up except flyway\nthen then endpoint was not enabled by the actuator autoconfig of spring boot. So this is not a problem with Spring Boot Admin but with Spring Boot. looks like a spring security issue to me. here is a 2.0.0 sample for security https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/blob/master/spring-boot-admin-samples/spring-boot-admin-sample-servlet/src/main/java/de/codecentric/boot/admin/SpringBootAdminApplication.java#L69. This is not a spring boot admin issue. The environmentWebEndpointExtension is from spring cloud. The SBA 2.0 currently doesn't include Hystrix or Turbine support.. as Turbine uses the same dashboard as Hystrix this is a duplicate of https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/issues/657#issuecomment-396177252. > For SBA client running on CloudFoundry environment, routes is retrieved... at the timing of starting up the application.\nThat's right. The information is currently taken from the environment variables, which can't be changed for a running process. So we need to obtain the needed information somehow differently. Is there an api we can query?. @tetsushiawano are you willing to provide a PR which enhances the CloudFoundryApplicationFactory. I am no CF user and so this enhancement is low priority for me.. Please provide more details, with this little information I can't help you.\nAre there any errors in the logs? Did you add the Eureka Discovery Client to the SBA server? Is it configured properly?. For Spring Cloud Discovery support you need to use 2.0.1-SNAPSHOT as Spring Cloud Finchley is not released yet and the Spring Boot Admin 2.0.0 lacks support for it.\nSorry the docs are missing this point.. Imho this is a problem with your health indicator reporting the application is down.. After which time the error occurs? Could you please provide a sample project (GH repo or zip file) to reproduce the issue? (Works on my machine \ud83d\ude04 ). What Java version and platform is it running on?. is the admin server running on tomcat (did you include spring-boot-starter-web?) or is it running on netty?. Please add the spring-boot-starter-web and try running on tomcat. I could not reproduce this issue on netty with spring boot 2.0.3.RELEASE.\nAs there is a suitable workaround (using tomcat) I'm closing this issue. \nIn case you really want to use netty (for whatever reason) please provide something to reproduce this problem.. @dickerpulli I'm currently reviewing this and despite the fact that I suggested this solution I'm currently a bit skeptical on this..... merged with d7d72b87336b5f0d35ac10ca12c494fcfe0bec1f.

I'll address this with 2.1.x. Don't expect anything before the Boot 2.1.0.M1 (currently mid July). merged with b7aa64ee867b72f74d1dae58750737bf2c69ee2c.

Thx for contributing!. The discovery feature was removed from 2.0.0 as Spring Cloud Finchley is not released yet, currently you need to use our 2.0.1-SNAPSHOT.. Did you switch to sba 2.0.1?. IIRC gradle has some slightly different resolution algorithm than maven (esp. when using BOMs)\nUsing this simple sample using maven works for me:\nsba-eureka.zip\n. p.s. since  1.5.7 Spring Boot Admin itself has a BOM: de.codecentric:spring-boot-admin-dependencies.. yes it contains the disocvery stuff... either you depend on that or you use the\nspring-boot-admin-starter-server which pulls it in.\nSorry, I totally forgot that you might not use the server-starter (which is there since 1.5.7). could you please provide a sample project (GH repo or zip file) to reproduce the issue?. Remove the @EnableWebMvc and everything is working great.\nThe annotation pulls in some config and this ends up with a different configured ObjectMapper than SBA expects.. duplicates https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/issues/714#issuecomment-383854305. spring.boot.admin.client.api-path=http://localhost:9999 is wrong.\nUse spring.boot.admin.client.url=http://localhost:9999. Pleas set the loglevel of de.codecentric.boot.admin.server.services.StatusUpdater to TRACE. Ok this gives me no further information. The requests should be logged if you set reactor.ipc.netty.channel.ChannelOperationsHandler to DEBUG could you try that?\nI couldn't reproduce the issue.... The difference is the current test has no body and and an incompatible content type. Your request has no body, but a compatible content type.\nThanks for investigating this issue further and sticking to it, much appreciated.. you need to use spring boot 2.0.2.RELEASE!. Could you give a bit more explanation? As I don't understand what the issue is.\nWhich version of SBA you are referring to?. closing due to missing feedback.. The customization for the mails has been changed. This property doesn't exist anymore. Please consult http://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/current/#mail-notifications.

The HttpHeadersProvider is used to reach the other applications. If you get a 401 on the /applications I guess you've some error in your spring security config of spring boot admin.. see this commit: https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/commit/fa35de89c3a4a40f14ef2dae0fec029d1600aca7\n. You're right. The solution from the commit doesn't work when using a static configuration.... correct.. you could schedule a task that updates info frequently. Without digging deeper into the code - imho this is the right direction and should work. The problem is that not only the info gets stale but also the discovered endpoints, so it wouldn't fix all the problems..... I guess you have some error in your spring security config as a 403 is issued by spring security.. Imho exporting/publishing the audit-events is out-of-scope for Spring Boot Admin.\nExporting/publishing the events can be easily implemented in Spring Boot applications (e.g. by implementing AuditListener). It should not rely on Spring Boot Admin to be running and shoveling the audit events from the endpoints to a message queue.. merged with c4264c7d18140c602089974f651dd349d48ac26d. As we publish snapshots on oss.sonatype.org and releases on maven central I don't see any benefit in additional jitpack support.. imho to have a stable version should only use tagged versions (and not commits in between). For each tag a version in maven central is published.. Sorry to say, but I don't want to merge this pull request. \nIn my personal opinion the benefits are too small for adding the burden of a second build script which has to be maintained. Also I think there is currently no broad demand for reproducible build on a commit basis.\nNonetheless thanks for the suggesting and actively contributing to this project.. duplicates #776. Either set spring.boot.admin.client.instance.service-base-url. Or just make jar instead of war.. the property name was in my comment https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/issues/796#issuecomment-399326340\n. I guess the 401 is from the monitored applications. The requests made to the endpoint need to authenticate on the admin and the monitored application.. > Since this is only used to display the user name, a fix would be to create a simple DTO containing the principal name which is filled from the current principal, or just use the principal name as a string.\nyep. Are you willing to submit a PR? currently short on time.. just fixed it. Until the next release you can override the UiController to work around this problem.. sorry but I can't read chinese. What does the exception tell?. Doesn't look like a SBA problem. I guess there is maybe some firewall between (or on the remote host) resetting the connection. @liubin0211 @hellotoworld please use english so that more people can participate. by default SBA does not filter instances from discovery - so I guess you should look at the DiscoveryClient implementation. > Spring boot admin 1.5 How to monitor spring boot 2.0?\nyou can't\n\nSpring boot admin 2.0 how to monitor spring boot 1.5?\n\nsee http://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/current/#monitoring-spring-boot-1.5.x. it is spring.boot.admin.client.username and spring.boot.admin.client.password for the client.

We could add a spring.boot.admin.client.instance.service-path (default: /) to make things configurable. Would you like to submit a PR?\n. there is a section on using spring boot admin with spring security in the reference guide. duplicates https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/issues/714#issuecomment-383854305. set the adminContextPath to the route (prefix) of your reverse proxy and don't do url rewriting.. 1. Unrelated to Spring Boot Admin\n2. Pretty normal for Spring Boot Applications. instead of just posting a link to a project, it would be also nice if you describe the error you are experiencing or ask some kind of question do you have.... duplicates https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/issues/657#issuecomment-396177252. Spring Boot Admin needs to have access to the /health endpoint. I guess your config is somehow preventing that.. This is no SBA issue as you need to expose your actuator endpoints via http. Please consult the spring boot reference guide on that.. see http://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/current/#logfile. The /logfile endpoint of spring boot actuator needs to be enabled. Please read the boot docs on how to achieve that, this is no SBA issue.\nHint: there is a management.endpoint.logfile.external-file property that you can use to activate the logfile input (in case you don't set logging.path or logging.file). as the spring boot actuator endpoint has no support for this, sba also doesn't has. I guess the extra bit at the end is from some kind of middleware/firewall. The HTTP response status may be 200 but the returned content is not compliant to the JSON spec so the ui can't parse the content - there is nothing we can do about it - you need to fix your setup.\nMay be you should take some tcp dumps on your client and spring boot admin machine to figure out if there is something in between messing with the response. > Can we have some configuration to make UI call admin-server securely?\nCould you describe what exactly you are missing? \nThe ui just does ordinary http calls which usually use some kind of session token in the cookies. Imho there is nothing to do here.\nReferring to https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/issues/817#issuecomment-403501693 you should first figure out what your internal security library is missing, before opening a very vague and unprecise issue.. This error occurs if there are concurrent writes to the repository storing the instances information. Usually the operations are retried a couple of times until they are successful. Does this happen all the time or rarely? Could you provide the full logs as attachment?. the mentioned exception is not in the log, so I guess the issue is resolved.\n. your yaml doesn't look correctly indented for spring.boot.admin.client.url\n. closed due to missing feedback. No there isn't. \nBut as the SBA is totally extensible you can implement that yourself.\nI consider log analysis out-of-scope for SBA, as there are way better tools for that (ELK-stack, Splunk, ...).. Usual your application should either respond for the option request on either /dump or /threaddump and not on both. So it suprises me that both endpoints are discovered.\nNonetheless we should protect the server against just blowing up.. I guess we need to raise an issue in Spring Boot so that either the time unit is fixed or given for the metrics endpoint.... raised https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/13791. This just fixes the date conversion. We could do more awesome using the base unit, but time is lacking.\nPlease note that the fix will only work for monitored applications using the spring boot 2.0.4 release.. I guess there is a clashing of paths. Either you use spring.boot.admin.context-path to move where the admin ui is served or even better you split up the config and the admin server.\nI strongly recommend to not couple your monitoring tool with your config server (as there is no reason to do so) and opt in for the latter.. I've raised https://github.com/SoapBox/linkifyjs/issues/239 for the npm module used to to the hyperlink detection.. 1) What triggers the context close in this case? Application shutdown or sth. else?\n2) Please upgrade to Finchley.RELEASE\n3) Could you please supply a zip or link to a project to reproduce the problem?. Please provide a project to reproduce the issue. closed due to missing feedback. you need to specify an absolute URL. Thanks for providing the sample project!\nThis is primarily not a Spring Boot Admin issue, but as it's the code from the sample/docs I did take a look at it. The problem is the Spring Security configuration. You need to set the defaultTarget url via successHandler.setDefaultTargetUrl(adminContextPath + \"/\");\nI've updated the samples.. duplicates https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/issues/657#issuecomment-396177252. What's the purpose?. Currently you have following choices:\n1) cluster two Instances by using Hazelcast (see http://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/current/#clustering-support)\n2) If you use SBA client: Register your monitored apps at multiple instances (spring.boot.admin.client.url takes an array with the urls and spring.boot.admin.client.register-once=false)\n3) If you use Spring Cloud Disocvery: Just spin up multiple SBA instances. If the eureka version from Spring Cloud Finchley and Edgware are compatible it should just work. yes and it will ever stay this way for 1.5.x applications. The metrics endpoint has changed so much with 2.x so I decided to support only the new format.. just disable the jolokia endpoint,. please provide a project to reproduce the problem. A problem that I can't reproduce cannot be fixed by me..... currently you can't. It's due to the same reason as in https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/issues/829. Works for me.. merged with slight changes in ad0afd4f4238cc08b3a4f528f1ca2e7e49be4f20. Thanks for contributing!. Good catch! Thanks for reporting!. Currently there isn't.. But PRs are always welcome.. For storing the instance events you can implement the InstanceRepository with your favourite persistence tech. But the SBA doesn't store any historical data from the endpoints.. For IE 11 I won't do any fixes, but feel free to send a PR. \n. I can't reproduce this. It works on my machine using the current master.. merged with 0d1356816488d4ad31d1a569acbfd449a64c500b into master.\nAs 1.5.x applications can also be monitored with SBA2.0 you'd only need to migrate the SBA server to 2.0.. @asibross sounds like a nice addition. The information should be taken from the metadata so that the SBA client and SC discovery users can benefit from this enhancement.. how about spring.boot.admin.client.instance.metatdata.tags.*\ne.g. spring.boot.admin.client.instance.metadata.tags.environment=test. Currently the docs for  Discovery on CF are missing, but in short: You need to add the and applicationId to the metadata instanceId (like https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/blob/master/spring-boot-admin-client/src/main/java/de/codecentric/boot/admin/client/registration/metadata/CloudFoundryMetadataContributor.java) does for the SBA client. \nEverything else should work ootb (except when sba server itself runs outside CF - then you need to add the CloudFoundryHttpHeaderProvider and CloudFoundryInstanceIdGenerator as beans). @Sarvesh-D Would you volunteer for a PR on our documentation for this?. @Sarvesh-D at best a new paragrapgh on cloudfoundry in https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/blob/master/spring-boot-admin-docs/src/main/asciidoc/server-discovery.adoc. Please use Spring Boot Admin 1.5.7. Possible solutions:\n1) Pull SBA into the K8s cluster\n2) Do similar solution like it's implemented on CloudFoundry: Add a special header to the loadbalancer request which instruct the LB to route the request to a specific instance. SBA would need to take the header value into account for identify individual instances and add the header to the requests.\n3) Add special routes to your ELB which point to a single instance\nMonitoring just a single instance is imho a rather bad solution as you never know which instance you are looking at and e.g. setting log levels for a specific instance will be a game of roulette.... Thx for the PR:\nI wonder why you not just used plain configuration:\napplication.yml:\neureka:\n  instance:\n    hostname: ${vcap.application.uris[0]}\n    nonSecurePort: 80\n    metadataMap:\n      applicationId: ${vcap.application.application_id}\n      instanceId: ${vcap.application.instance_index}. merged with e58282b43c8273974d125f8c7be68e078bb1a6e2. I think it would be also good to have the tags as columns in the instances table for the \"Applications\" view.\nAlso I think it would be nice to have the tags explicitly in the backend model. We'd need to extract the tags in a similar fashion like we do for the version.. Just had a quick view at the code. Looking go so far - exactly what I was thinking of. The only thing left is to have a brief description of this in the documentation.. Looking good so far, I need to take a closer look for merging, but currently my time is too limited.. merged with 25373f532425e38857d2ec9a7f16ef528e422f96 and polished with 92a76b1c4ccc46e5b9116a59890c170c890d9744. I don't have this problem:\n. Ok i guess it's related to the timestamp from the httptrace endpoint. Could you please post a excerpt from your httptrace output showing the timestamp?. > so it is something make the server's httptrace response return timestamp in seconds unit?\nI guess so. Did you check the json response?. Are you using Boot 1.5.x in your client?. There is an issue in Spring Boot for having stable actuator json mappings. There isn't not much we can do about this. https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/12951. Sorry but I guess what it is: You have timeouts in your network... I don't see a direct cause in Spring Boot Admin. Show me tcpdumps that proves otherwise. Agreed. The probing should do a retry if a timeout/connection error occurs.. The authorization info from the metadata is not passed to the UI - it should never leave the backend server except to the instance which submitted the metadata. \nThe server enriches the request headers made to the individual instances. So it's no surprise that the requests from the chrome browser doesn't contain the Authorization header.\nFor security between SBA-UI and SBA-Server you should use some session based security.... You can do a PR right away - there is no need to have an open issue. I'll use the PR for the changelog then.. @stockmaj yeah, cause the fix is in 2.0.3 (not released yet). With d0e9deaec817059926b9bce2e2b5275dc02e7357 I decided to solve this problem slightly different:\nChange the @ConditionalOnMissingBean to look for a matching bean name.\nI expect more people to add the AsyncTaskExecutor for doing async methods or scheduled tasks but not necessarily async requests. With this (more defensive) solution a custom added asyncTaskExecutor is not used for async requests. If someone isn't happy with our defaults he just needs to add a bean with exactly this name.\nP.s. I currently expect https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/1563 to solve this problem for spring boot 2.1.x so that we can get rid of the async task executor config.. Please check that the endpoints are enabled and exposed via http? Please check that the managment url known to the admin server is correct. . For a fresh project from start.spring.io It works for me using mvn spring-boot:run (without any further configuration) but not running with java -jar...\nAnd even more interestingly it works for the spring-boot-admin-sample-servlet even with java -jar\nIf the extensions are discovered the log shows this:\n2018-08-03 19:04:14.486  INFO 7769 --- [  restartedMain] b.a.s.u.c.AdminServerUiAutoConfiguration : Loaded Spring Boot Admin UI Extension: UiExtension(resourcePath=custom/css/custom.684076aa.css, resourceLocation=classpath:/META-INF/spring-boot-admin-server-ui/extensions/custom/css/custom.684076aa.css)\n2018-08-03 19:04:14.486  INFO 7769 --- [  restartedMain] b.a.s.u.c.AdminServerUiAutoConfiguration : Loaded Spring Boot Admin UI Extension: UiExtension(resourcePath=custom/js/custom.5fda1dca.js, resourceLocation=classpath:/META-INF/spring-boot-admin-server-ui/extensions/custom/js/custom.5fda1dca.js)\n. Sounds weird, but: \nIf you place the custom-ui dependency as first dependency in your pom.xml it will be placed in the fat jar before the spring-boot-admin-server-ui and then it works as expected.\nI guess the pattern needs to be classpath*:.. instead of classpath:... @RestControllerEndpoints aren't registered as JMX beans therefore you can't find im on the JMX tab. This is not a Spring Boot Admin issue. But with SBA 2.0.2 you can add a custom ui extension to the SBA UI interface to visualize your custom endpoints. So do you mean integrating swagger for the rest-endpoints spring boot admin itself has? No.. duplicate of #868 \n. Without a complete stacktrace or a sample project to reproduce, it is hard to tell what the reason is.\nOne of the worst issue descriptions ever.. Could you please provide a sample project to reproduce the issue as the log output doesn't give a hint about the underground cause.. Inside the same application you can't - but you can run SBA on a different port by just running it as a single (standalone) application. Changing the port of a spring boot application is not a spring boot admin issue. Please consult the Spring Boot Reference Guide. Iirc, if you don't protect the static assets (ie / and /assets) then the UI redirects to the login (and not the server) and the fragments should be kept.. > 3. Change the instances/applications mapping to something else, so that it won't collide.\nThis is not necessary if the requested content-type is correctly considered, so that the html is not delivered for the json-requests..... @asibross I'd be happy if you could test one of our snapshot versions.... e is not of type Throwable it's a UiExtension. So this change would break the logging. The variable is just poorly named.. Please read https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-use-tomcat-behind-a-proxy-server\niirc spring boot rewrites the urls if proxy and spring boot app is configured properly.. I don't think this is a issue related to Spring Boot Admin, but more that your HTTPS setup is incorrect or you  are missing some certificates in your keystore.\nAnd when reading java.security.cert.CertificateException: No subject alternative DNS name matching localhost found I'd suggest just use plain http for localhost.. Just posting a stacktrace is one of the poorest issue ever filed\nAlso it's looks like a issue with your Eureka setup and not with Spring Boot Admin.\nAnd a java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused (Connection refused) is what it is: Your application can't do a TCP connection to your host.\nNot a Spring Boot Admin issue. duplicates #868 . closed in favor of the PR.

The sba servers config may interfere with your application config and vice versa. see #887. If you set the spring.boot.admin.context-path, you also have to include this suffix in the spring.boot.admin.client.url. @dmitrysenkovich Sorry, but as mentioned in the FAQ running SBA included in your business application might bear some problems - so I don't want to embrace this setup. Hence there are intentionally no starters, guides or samples..

I changed the base to master. I don't want this kind of risky change in the 2.0.x branch. Could you resolve the conflicts?. I'm sorry for not answering on this topic, but I've currently very limited time and for me this improvement has a low priority.... You could write some zuul filters to achieve that, but I wouldn't recommend it.\nWhy you just don't upgrade to Spring Boot Admin 2.x which can monitor 1.5.x applications (and will do the necessary conversions for you). You need to expose the actuator endpoints via management.endpoints.web.exposure.include. application.properties is correct.\nPlease make sure that the maven filtering is active and also that the resource location points to the correct location. (The given value is for the spring-boot-admin-sample-custom-ui-module...)\nThere is a working sample config in spring-boot-admin-sample-servlet . SBA allows you to include any authentication which works for \"ordinary\" spring applications. For saml you can use Spring Security SAML for example. There are guides from the Spring guys available..

Using no security is a no-brainer and the samples already contain a security sample configuration.

Your output should contain timestamps formatted this way \"timestamp\":\"2018-09-04T13:07:18.226Z\"\n\n\nSo I guess you've customized your object mapper. For SBA we depend on the default configuration.\nAlso see https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/12951 . Sorry I don't understand your problem. Could you give some more details (and maybe screenshots). Did you check the clients' logs if they registered successfully? There should be a single warning right after the application start if registration has failed.\n. Do they all register with the same healthcheck url?\n. applications are identified by the health url so the overwrite each others registration. The spring boot admin clients uses a RestTemplate. You can instantiate the ApplicationRegistrator with a custom configured RestTemplate which resolves your virtual hostname.. We only depend on Spring Boot and Spring Cloud. I try to keep track of version updates with a issue in the milestone for the corresponding release (e.g. 2.1.0).. Sorry but I don't understand your problem. Please provide a detailed description of your problem and a project to reproduce the problem..  Please provide a project to reproduce the problem.. Despite the fact that the csrf config is wrong (already reported and fixed in the docs with https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/issues/894) your sample works perfectly fine for me.. Either the url you specified for spring.boot.admin.client.url is just wrong or you have some kind of networking issue (may be a firewall blocking the traffic). The benefit for adding the initial delay is just getting rid of the single log event. Imho it's not worth doing it as the registration is repeated and succeeds.. @chrislhardin there is a spring.boot.admin.client.auto-registration property. If it is false it prevents that the application will register automatically. The ApplicationRegistrator#register() will register the application when it is called.. Please provide a project to reproduce the problem. Which version of SBA are you using?. As this targets 2.1.0 and I'm currently very busy you need to be a little patient.. @semeiser you implemented (similar to the loggers) that not all caches will be rendered at once.

As a follow up we could now move the cache-related metrics to the caches view.... Applications are per default identified by the health url. If you are running on cloud foundry you can alternate this behaviour. see http://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/current/#_cloudfoundry.\nThe instances are then identified by provided metadata and also the needed header for the router are added.. Sorry but I don't understand what your problem is. A single, contradictory phrase is far too lees.\nCould you please give a detailed description of your problem and the versions you are using?\nAlso please provide a sample project to reproduce the issue.. Your provided project works perfectly fine for me. If the  application is running on your local machine but not deployed to your server, please check the environment dependent configuration (e.g. urls). \nAlso please have a close look at the logfiles from your SBA server and client applications.. We make use of some Jackson annotations and some custom serializers (in the SBA server). So you'd need to replace all of this.\nI'd just suggest that you split up the SBA server (using Jackson) and your own application (using Gson) into two separate boot applications and you shouldn't have any problem.\nIn general it's better to split things up as there could be some other sideffects...\nWe won't support running SBA server with Gson, the SBA client should work using Gson.. The problem isn't the SBA client. The client just registers at the SBA server, all data are taken from the spring boot actuator endpoint. SBA depends on the default format for the Spring Boot actuator endpoints. My (false?) assumption was that the actuator endpoints look the same using gson and jackson.. I fixed this in 86ba5b9 as it was a quick one.\nBut I don't tested support for these browsers and we won't support them in the future. The browsers are more than three years old and have a global usage of 0.01% so the effort of supporting them has no relation to the benefit.. merged with bd7f8bcbcc110aaff89fc3cad1a7f1d7f641f3ad.

This is a message from the optimistic locking mechanism. It looks like there is a bug in there..... Could you please show me your hazelcast config?. Sorry for coming back late to this. I figured out that the way the retry is executed is wrong. But I'm interested in the first exception that triggered the retry. Can you post the first error from the log?. Could you try one of our 2.0.4-SNAPSHOT version to see if that helps?. looking at the timestamps it looks like a duplicate of https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/issues/861. If you want to build from sources see https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin#build. By default spring boot's info endpoint contains no data. Consider to add information via adding info.* properties or implementing a InfoContributor. The ui request results in a text/event-stream response returning server sent events. The connection will be kept open and not explicitly terminated and may result in this exception. It just tells you that the browser did close the connection and the server just wants to write some more data to the socket. This is quite normal.. No it doesn't. But you can extend the MailNotifier and adapt to your own needs.. Would you volunteer for a PR on this?. I'd appreciate a PR.. merged(19f50f5c3d6be06499b236eb2e710b3d69ad05e0) and polished (2f115959e711665100dc0f6b3048197c12dc22bf). thanks for the PR!. At best please provide a project to reproduce the error, at least please provide the responses from the corresponding actuator endpoints. You have configured jackson to use snake case. SBA depends on using the spring boot default for the actuator endpoints. This duplicates https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/issues/751 - please have a look at it for further information.. when this is a application.properties (and not .yml) it must look like this:\nserver.port=8090\nspring.boot.admin.client.url=http://localhost:8080\nmanagement.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*\nmanagement.endpoint.health.enabled=true. This is not a spring boot admin problem. It's a spring boot problem (and it looks like you forgot to exclude slf4j)\nsee https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-configure-log4j-for-logging. duplicate of #846. The service url is just a link to the the address the application submits during registration. It's not proxied by the url and thus needs to be reachable for your browser, which it isn't in your case.\nIf you can change this url via spring.boot.admin.client.instance.service-url.. http://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/current/#_converting_serviceinstances. The source maps for the js-files should be included. It should be debuggable in the browser.\nBut your issue seems to duplicate #944 \n. I'd guess in the browsers console you should see some errors.. cause the response doesn't look like the ui expects.. it must read management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=* (without the quotes)\n.

We have tests for this.. Can you try to reproduce the problem in your test environment by scaling up the instances?\nWhich version are you using?\nDid you checked if the application reached any limit (open handles/open tcp connections/memory)?. > How exactly does the wall page communicate with the backend?\nThe ui does a long polling on /applications with Content-type: text/event-stream. What bothers me a bit:\n1) The exception you show is from the reverse proxy in SBA which isn't used when querying the health status. But as you said the applications turn offline. There should be some log output for this in the SBA server log...\n2) The exception itself is somewhere deep inside netty and searching for the exception on the web yields no further insights.... Did you try to do some tcpdumps and gained some insights what's going over the wire?. I guess on the client side is less traffic.... on the other hand: to see wether the server succeeds in establishing a tcp connection you should take a look on the server side.. Any update on this?. closed due to missing feedback.. I'm no ECS user, so I can't help you with that.\nBut if you google a bit you find an article on how to determine host and port for your task (https://medium.com/@pedrojuarez/ec2-ecs-instance-metadata-2939d7a6f2ce).\nUsing this information you just need to set the spring.boot.admin.client.instance.service-base-url for the admin client.. duplicates #861 \n.

Could you post you output from the health endpoint?. @prafsoni I guess the nodes property is just a single string or an array? \nWhat is used for delimiter? Just a single comma or is it comma + space?. It looks to me that the application.properties you have posted belongs to a different application or is not in effect (as it configures a different application name than shown in the screenshot).\nPlease also test that the actuator endpoints are in fact accessible via http.. I've also raised https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-kubernetes/issues/247. Hmm could you post the json from /applications when this happens? . I need this information to figure out wether the error is in the front- or backend.. Thanks, that did help. The error occurs when more than a week has passed and was due to a incorrect moment usage. fixed.. This is not a SBA problem. The placeholders are resolved by Spring at startup time and when a placeholder can't be resolved it will be left as is. In your case the url the UriComponentsBuilder (inside SBA server!)  recieves the property with the unresolved placeholder (from your eureka client!) and tries to resolve it again but lacks the needed context for this.\nThe property must not contain any unresolved placeholders. When the management.port is unset the best thing to do, is to default the value like this: ${management.port:${server.port:8080}}. In case you want to prevent any unresolved placeholders at startup, do it like this: \n``\n    @Bean\n    public static PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer propertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer() {\n        PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer propertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer = new PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer();\n        propertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer.setIgnoreUnresolvablePlaceholders(true);\n        return propertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer;\n    }\n````. If I get your config right, you are using the \"standard\"-propertyserver.servlet.context-path` to set the path for your reactive handler in your custom code. So this is not standard spring boot behavior or is it?. Imho the solution proposed in #804 would be a much better fit for this problem.. >  I can update my solution... actually - adding a new property under spring-admin namespace was my first idea, but I've chosen such way because it described In spring-boot-client documentation: http://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/2.0.3/#spring-boot-admin-client (see spring.boot.admin.client.instance.service-url property description).\nThe docs are misleading and outdated as this property doesn't exist in spring boot 2.. @gtukmachev will you update the PR?. closed due to missing feedback. Could you please provide a sample project to reproduce the issue?. You can't. If you want to restrict the access from the ui to the server the only thing you can do is to set a reverse proxy in front of the SBA server.. closed by 814f525e770368488b4889ca6631fc8d0b3dbe16. For me the query params are shown. If they are missing in your case, they are most probably not included in the response from the /httptrace endpoint.\n\n. > I would rather like tabs layout in 2.0.2, it is ugly to set those tabs in left-top corners in 2.0.3\nOn smaller screens the tabs didn't fit on the screen so we moved the navigation to the sidebar. Do you have any suggestion how we can solve this problem in a more elegant way? Besides telling me that you don't like the sidebar I'm really missing a suggestion here.\n\nAfter I upgraded 2.0.2 to 2.0.3, the JMX tab is missing\n\nIt's under the JVM group in the sidebar. If it's missing, most probably the jolokia actuator endpoint isn't exposed. . You should check the eventstream request in the browsers console.. A request to the JournalController#getJournalEvents adds the SseEmitter . > Is it possible, during the execution, the server removes a SseEmitter wrongly?\nI don't know.\nThe best is to upgrade to SBA 2.0 as it doesn't use the Sse emitters. Also I won't do any fix for 1.5.x unless it's critical. Which is imho not the case here.. 1) The endpoint detection runs either when the application changes it status or when the registration (including metadata) is updated. \nTo enforce a endpoint detection after a (re-)deployment just add a timestamp with the startuptime in the instance metadata (when using the SBA client it will be done automatically). I guess our docs currently lack some hint on this.\n2) The ProbeEndpointsStrategy is merely just for (old 1.5.x) spring boot applications not providing an actuator index and probes the endpoints by doing a OPTION request to every endpoint. I guess when you have no endpoints present at all, your application failed to respond to the request. Please note that in the upcoming 2.0.4 there will be an option to retry the probing requests.. I've added a hint in the docs for triggering the update with 2d05959bba6ecda431611208d410100b50c4c61d. > 1. In my case, I register SBA with Eureka registry, where services are already UP, so I just attach SBA to it. The expected behavior of SBA, in this case, is to fetch all metadata from services and execute endpoint detection for each of them (even if they don't change statuses)\nThis should happen right now as with the first registration they should change from offline to up. So If you have a look at the Journal there should be STATUS_CHANGE Events for every instance.\n. Yeah, sorry my mistake it's in the upcoming 2.1.0. see https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/issues/862. see https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/milestones\n. Why do you use the spring boot admin client and eureka? There is no need for using both.\nA 401 indicates that the application does need some credentials (e.g. username/password) to access the http endpoint. You provided config totally lacks such information. \nPlease also be aware that Spring Boot 1.5.x autoconfigures some defaults when spring security is found no the classpath.. As SBA doesn't provide any security config. I can't help you much.. > My main application is a Spring Boot Admin 2.0 Eureka Admin Server\nThe why don't you get rid of the SBA client? The 401 should vanish and the registration is made by eureka.. Due to the https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-17396 bug in Spring 5.1.1 we have to wait for RC2 (or a 2.1.0-SNAPSHOT using spring 5.1.2). As Spring Boot 2.1.0-SNAPSHOT uses the snapshots from spring which already has fixed the bug. I've updated to the snapshot. Please provide a sample project to reproduce the issue.. First of all, I advise you to not include the admin server into your business application, as this can have side-effects on your business application as well the admin server (like it happened in your case).\nIf you still want to use your own ObjectMapper instance, you can add the RegistrationDeserializer as deserializer to the Objectmapper to get rid of this problem.. Please make sure that the endpoints are exposed via management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*. Imho we should strive for the lightest integration possible, e.g. placing some useful links or doing a ui integration via iframes.. When using a Discovery Client you need to add some unique metadata entry so that the info and endpoints are refreshed after updating the application. See https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/commit/2d05959bba6ecda431611208d410100b50c4c61d. > What if I update the endpoint without restarting my app ?\nTo trigger the refresh the metadata needs also to be updated.. > 1. Is there any way to continue displaying deregistered applications for at least 1 week?\nno\n\n\nIs it possible to remove any application manually from wallboard? It can get re-registered after 1 min (if up and running).\n\n\nIf the application instance is just removed from the SBA and not shut down, it will automatically register again. \n\n\nApplications status shows DOWN on wallboard and in Applications list section - when I tried to use Hazelcast for persistence. When I click on applications and open 'info', then status shows UP. Is it a configuration issue?\n\n\nI guess it's a configuration issue. You should have a look at the event journal and the details of the corresponding status-change event. Did you had a look at the SBA server logs for Warnings or Errors?. How do you deal with this problem for your other applications (which need to to a 302 or include links back to itself)?\nWhat you could do right now: \nDeploy SBA as root in your tomcat and set the spring.boot.admin.context-path to /proxy-junction/sba-app/applications and disable url rewriting.. closed due to missing feedback.. @matzegebbe  see #990 \n.

You can stick to the 2.0.x server until then - the api for sba-client/-server is up- and downwards compatible . @dotpanic Could you post a project to reproduce? A quick test (using cli parameters did work for me). @dotpanic when running behind a proxy make sure the forward headers are set and taken into account. See https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-use-tomcat-behind-a-proxy-server\nThis should fix the wrong scheme in the URL. SBA 2.1.0 uses Spring Boot 2.1.0 which uses Project Reactor Californium.SR2.\nThe Spring Cloud Sleuth version you are using is build against Spring Boot 2.0.0 and Project Reactor Bismuth.SR12. \nThere were some backwards incompatible changes in Reactor. You need to Upgrade to the Greenwich release train of Spring Cloud.. you need to use spring boot 2.1.0 with spring boot admin 2.1.0.

Currently not implemented. Contributions are always welcome.. Feel free to submit a PR. SBA just takes tho log output from the spring boot actuator /logfile endpoint so this is a feature request for spring boot actuator (and not admin).\nBut there is a property in spring boot to serve any file: management.endpoint.logfile.external-file. The sample doesn't require any parent project, it just requires spring security. The samples are also in our guide http://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/current/#securing-spring-boot-admin\n(To make it easier to build and test the samples they are submodules in our maven build). You need to tell the spring boot admin client the correct password for the server via spring.boot.admin.client.username and spring.boot.admin.client.password. sorry this was missing in the docs. fixed it. f02b38dff1cc6702700a66740f3a50a82adb8d30. Did you enable http basic in your spring security config ?. 1 ) Did you upgrade to the latest spring boot (2.0.x) and spring boot admin (2.0.x) versions? \n2) Are you running on tomcat or netty? Please try on tomcat (via including spring-boot-starter-web)\n3) The increasing disk_quota will not increase your available memory.... @Sarvesh-D any update on this?\n. >  Is any other configuration required to get SBA working with tomcat?\nno just include the starter-web. > Is this because zuul does not support text/event-stream? \nYes, afaik zuul has problems with indefinite chunked streams.\n\nIf is, can you provide config to disable some function that relies event stream? Or any alternative config without event stream?\n\nNo. The stream is needed to update the UI.. The scheme is determined by the servlet container. If you want that the https scheme is used (because you have a reverese proxy in front) make sure that the \"forwarded\" headers are used. See https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-use-tomcat-behind-a-proxy-server. Are you deploying a .war-file to a servlet container?\nPlease provide a complete project to reproduce the issue.. you must not use eureka and sba-client. Choose one.. This is OK. It's used by the UI to determine if the api for notification filters is available.. When a FilteringNotifier is present the corresponding controller should be instantiated by this autoconfiguration (2.0.x and later)  https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/blob/5e9b1eb681539312155d56cff9ddec4e838d5a5b/spring-boot-admin-server/src/main/java/de/codecentric/boot/admin/server/config/AdminServerNotifierAutoConfiguration.java#L97. Sorry for the late response, but currently I'm very busy.\nI would take one of the following approaches:\nA) Add a custom HealthIndicator to all applications, which has operations to control the reported status and is exposed via JMX. Also adding Jolokia to my applications. SBA will give me a JMX view an I can call directly operations on that.\nB) Add  a custom HealthIndicator which is also a actuator endpoint and has a write operation to control the reported status. Add a custom-ui module to the SBA server to interact with this endpoint.\nBut as both solutions involve custom code, I don't want to add this the sba codebase, so you need to solve this yourself.. please provide a comlete project to reproduce the error. please provide a attached zip-file or a github repo.. This is due to a bug in spring-cloud-kubernetes. see #643 for more information.. Sorry but I won't do non-ciritical fixes to the 1.5.x branch.. From #1094: A solution of this issue should contain a sample in the docs.. With the latest and greatest the selected metrics are stored per application.. I guess you have a custom configured jackson (and not using the defaults) - so it's a duplicate of #751 . The sba server must be able to reach the clients via the management adress the client submits during registration. If you are using the sba client this address is guessed based on the hostname and port. If your app is running behind a rev. proxy it's most likely wrong. You can override it via spring.boot.admin.client.instance.service-base-url. closed due to missing feedback. Please provide a proper description and a sample project to reproduce the problem.. are you using the sba client?. closed due to missing feedback. Sorry I don't get the question. The applications are identified via their health url so as long each service registers with a uniqe url it should work out of the box. closed due to misssing feedback. @mzorba @wtatum is still anyone of you working on this PR?. @dzlataric Tell me when you have finished. merged with ed28a683cf384a81c9c28553cf3331c666f0fed9\nand polished with d3a77f05d1d88d5309e2a9bb7bc74ede21443d86. >  I have exposed management endpoints to \"*\" . can anyone help on this issue. I am using 1.5x version\nThe exposure is a Spring Boot 2.0 thing, iirc.\nAre you using SBA 1.5.x whith Boot 2.0? that won't work.. If you can't reach the routes from your browser I guess your cf setup is not correct. I can't help you with that.. I don't know much about cf but I guess it's router is somehow not handling HEAD requests correctly.\nI'd advise you to upgrade to one of our 2.x releases as they don't make these requests.. Try configuring your application to respect the forward headers. See https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-use-tomcat-behind-a-proxy-server. Please provide a project as github repo or zipfile to reproduce the problem.. Running your project and navigating tohttp://localhost:8080 works for me pretty well.. The response of /logfile is wrong. It should ship the logfile contents. As the endpoint is not part of SBA (but of Spring Boot Actuator) it's not an SBA issue.. I guess this is due to the fact that the underlying discovery implementation most likely doesn't report the instances being down. So they're not added to spring boot admin. SBA doesn't do any filtering here.. > It's often reported that the CPU is too high\nAre you referring to the SBA server cpu utilization? Did you investigate if the garbage collector was burning the cpu cycles?\n\nThe spring boot admin version we used was 1.5.8-SNAPSHOT\n\nDid you try upgrading to 2.x?\n\n...  now we had 76 APPLICATIONS and 204 INSTANCES ... With the increase of the project, is it suitable to continue using spring boot admin?\n\nI guess you have more than one team working on these applications? What about using a SBA server instance per team, so basically to divide and conquer?\n. Is there anyway that you can provide some project to reproduce the issue? Or do you might want to investigate the issue on your own?. Did you had a view at the log when this happens? anything suspicious here?. closed due to missing feedback.. Aside from the logged error everything is working fine?. I can't currently reproduce the issue. Could you please provide a project to reproduce the problem?. I have the ui now open for about 1 hour and didn't experience the Server connection failed. message.\nI do get the warning in the server logs, but these should not be a problem:\nThe ui does a long polling, when the browser closed the connection and afterwards the server tries to write some data on this connection the warning is emitted.. More on this problem here: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/15057\nAs the application is running as expected and the message is logged by tomcat we can't do anything about it. Therefore I'm closing this issue.. please look at your responses. It looks like a duplicate of #861 to me.. closed due to missing feedback.. @klopfdreh in the past this error was mostly caused by custom json format of the httptraces endpoint can you show me the content of your response?. Sorry, somehow I missed your last response.\n\nDoes this also affects the actuator endpoints or do they use a separate Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder bean?\n\nYes it does affect the actuator endpoints. See https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/12951. https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/blob/master/spring-boot-admin-server-ui/README.md has some short instructions how to best develop the ui in watch-mode. @klopfdreh do you think you could do a PR on this?. Did you test that the changes prevents the out-of-memory?. Yep, I already spotted it and will take care of it.. closed with acfa5b73f87363ac443d90398698c30886b306ae. > For me it does but slows down because 1000 is a big value for this and of course a lot of markup.\nYeah, we should use something like vue-virtual-scroller so that non visible entries are not included it the first render.... Sorry I don't get your question. What do you want to achieve?. All registered applications can be obtained via the InstanceRegistry. By the way: that's not a Spring Boot Admin question. Just use Spring Boot's server.port as mentioned by @TarunBhateja . Add a HeadersProvider to your SBA server. See https://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/current/#customizing-headers. For such a massive count of services the best is to use something like vue-virual-scroller.... To pick up the discussion from gitter here:\n\n@yevtsy: I have 500+ services registered there. When SBA opens home page with list of all services, it takes more than 10 sec to render. The logs show /applications endpoint invocation loads more than 15 MB data.\n\nI've duplicated the registration 500 times for a single application. An here are my numbers for the 2.1.2-SNAPSHOT (on a MBP/2016):\nResponse size from /applications in plain text: ~1.2 MB\nTime taken from initial request to rendered application list (with active profiler!): ~3500ms\nSo my numbers aren't as worse as yours. The massive difference in response size makes me wonder...\n. The loading spinner was added with c304723. I'll further look into the list rendering.. There is no solution other than upgrading your client services. From Spring Boot 1.x to 2.x the metrics endpoint was massively changed so that an easy conversion for the metrics is not possible.. For Spring Boot 2.0.x you need to use a Spring Boot Admin 2.0.x.. In case you're doing url rewriting you need to set spring.boot.admin.ui.public-url. merged with 4eb9bf4080bf9e517128cc88f62af21cb5827b72 and polished with bb9646669e3043e5a4d63faceaa827bb9c608487. What problem are you trying to solve?. If you set server.address for your application the SBA client will use this address.. > there is a problem when use config server\uff0cmore than one client instances shared one config using ctrip apollo. server.address not support regex.\n@zhaolin81 in my personal opinion this should be solved using envorinmonent/host dependent config.\nI'm currently not very keen on merging the copied code from the spring cloud project. You're the first one in four years requesting this feature and currenty I don't want to add the extra complexity.\nFor now please solve the problem for yourself by subclassing the  DefaultApplicationFacotry.. Never seen this exception. Can you provide a project to reproduce this problem?. closed due to missing feedback. >after upgrade to 2.1.1 release i notice a change in how none spring-boot application registered with consul are handled. in my case, consul was also registered as a service, and in SBA 2.0.4 this was shown as a gray \"offline\" service. \n\nupgrading to 2.1.1 i had to add consul to the list of ignored-services because SBA was trying to collect /actuator information which is not available. this also remove the service from the overview/wallboard making it invisible, as it was not there.\n\nWe didn't change the way the discovered instances are handled in the recent releases. And the ability to exclude services by pattern is pretty old (but is not by default active).\n\ni't would be nice to have some way to show none spring-boot applications as well into the total overview but using the consul status for \"offline/online\" status, and not use /actuator for this service if this fails.\nthis allows the wallboard to be a general status page which can be show as overview of the \"cloud services\"\n\nYou could write subclass own DeaultServiceInstanceConverter and remove the management url for those services you want just to be health checked (e.g. triggered via metadata).\nUnfortunately we can't take the health information from consul as the ServiceInstance interface doesn't expose such information - but you could add a metadata entry with the key health.path to the service registration so this custom address is health checked (just needs to deliver a 200 OK http response). In summary the only enhancement we could reasonably to in SBA is to add the option to just health-check specific services if the have certain metadata.. >in this case SBA should not perform a HTTP based health check. so if no we have a a metadata flag like sba.health.disable=true , we could skip this ?\n@lucwillems  what would be the benefit of having the instance listed (but not health-checked)?. Currently there is no release version o spring cloud greenwich. Currently I plan to release SBA 2.1.2 roughly two weeks and will upgrade to Greenwich afterwards. With ce7f3daf995e0f7cf459fdff88cbdd4c3625c3e1 the master branch is now on Greenwich.RC2 you can try one of the snapshot builds.\nI'll resolve this issue after Greenwich.RELEASE is available. Please provide a proper description and a project to reproduce the problem.. closed due to missing feedback. Please use Spring Boot 2.1.x for Spring Boot Admin 2.1.x. Looking all at your screenshots and code I have no clue how this issue is related to Spring Boot Admin (SBA):\n- The code you are talking about is from micrometer / spring boot (and not SBA)\n- The URLs shown in the screenshots are not one of SBA\nMay be you wanted to open an issue on a different project?. Did you create a Spring-@Configuration class adding a @Bean-instance of this class?. closed due to missing feedback. Thanks for your contribution!. > Any ideas whats the root cause for that?\nCurrently not. Are you using hazelcast? Are there maybe two instances registered to eureka having the same health-url?. > Should the exception happen when the version is the same? lastVersion >= events.get(0).getVersion() in my case 0 and 0\nNo since then there would be two events with the version 0.. I'm currently hesitate to close this as there might be a bug hidden.\nAre you using eureka as well as the spring boot admin client? I wonder what the concurrent updates to the EventStore causes..... @asibross can you give me some details about your setup? Are you using some sc-disvocery or hazelcast?. > If I disable the StatusUpdaterTrigger (just for debugging), I don't see that error anymore.\nThats obvious, as the stacktrace tells StatusUpdaterTrigger is part of the issue.. Please prove a project (as zip or github repo) to reproduce the issue.. closed due to missing feedback. I guess the \"consul\" service is not really a spring boot service. You may want to exclude it via setting spring.boot.admin.discovery.ignored-services. you should disable it for your tests - there is a property for that.. see https://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/current/#slack-notifications. just set spring.boot.admin.notify.slack.enabled=false for your tests.. SBA depends on webflux in order to support servlet as well as nett. Also the reactive webclient is used for making the requests. So there is no way around using it.. if you include spring-boot-starter-web the underyling container is tomcat using spring mvc and works pretty well. The webclient (from webflux) is used instead of the resttemplate (no matter which underlying container is used).. looks to me that you hostname contains a dot? (which is invalid)\n. If there is a critical bug in SBA 1.5.x i'd fix and release it. But I'd guess you did a mistake in your config. Could you provide a project to reproduce the issue?. closed due to missing feedback. Could you add a test to AbstractAdminApplicationTest that tests the behavior?. Also the handler should be narrowed down to the content type text/html,application/xhtml+xml for the accept header.. Yeah, I did. But after thinking back and forth I\u2018m not sure about the approach. Currently I tend to make the mvc aware of the frontend routes as it involves less guessing and magic but adds some extra burden for custom extensions.... >  this will allow me to add the Filters on my side without introducing this change to everyone?\nI'm currently plan to to do a proper solution with the upcoming 2.2.0 (probably mid Jul, short after boot 2.2.0).

I currently see only the following solutions to your problem:\na) Don't cluster at all. Tell the clients to register at both SBA server instances\nb) Pay for hazelcast\nc) Establish a ssh tunnel between the instances and let hazelcast replicate using this tunnel.\nd) Implement your own InstanceEventStore which uses some secured transport to replicate the data\n. Just posting a stacktrace is a bad issue description.\nFor the exception itself please look at my comment here https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/issues/1039#issuecomment-449599963. Sorry I'm no weblogic expert, I can't help you with that.. Could you show me the response body of the first one?. you are using snake case formatting for the json. This is a duplicate of #751. We rely on the the default jackson json mapping configured by spring boot for the actuator endpoints. It would be to much effort to sort all variants of json encoders and options.. If you can somehow align the json encoding for org.springframework.boot.actuate.health.Status like it is for jackson, the error should disappear.. As there are too many options (eg. Authentication using Session, OAuth or JWT; Discovery using Eureka, Consul, Zookeeper...; Custom logos) that requires modification of the binaries I don't see any benefit in providing a docker image.\nAlso I don't see Spring Boot Admin as ready baked runtime, but more like a framework that can be customized and extended.. I guess your service is down / not reachable. When this happens the UI shows you the last known information from the server.... The SBA server itself must not return a 503 when the actuator endpoints returns a 500 (for the health endpoint) \nI currently can't link the ReadCancellationException to it.. See the milestone for it\u2019s due date. I'd guess it would be reasonable to have a integration test which tests the proper shutdown.... Merged with 1ce38e5e1764b47d8141c6c41d25f7fdae8c308c and polished with 7edd8ba7befb1482e744b9fd025b6ebcd9b261b1\nI did take a simpler approach which just disposes the schedulers when the subscription is disposed.\nSadly I didn't found a good way to check for non-daemon threads that plays nicely with the surefire plugin.... If you get a connection refused. The client can't establish a tcp connection with the host. It's most likely that the the url to the admin server or the docker/container config  is wrong.. The logFileType is a custom actuator endpoint? Can you make a request to /instances/b1ccf01ebbb8 and look if it's listed in the json?. closed due to missing feedback. make sure the endpoint is listed in the endpoints section of /instances/b1ccf01ebbb8. Imho if the health check can hit stale db connections, it is most likely that your users will do as well. So you'd better fix the underlying issue of the stale connections instead of raising the monitor read timeout.\nAlso you are describing a very special case, but it should be obvious that any health check which might succeed, but doesn't finish in time will lead to a OFFLINE status report.\nWhat currently comes to my mind if SBA should distinguish between OFFLINE (cannot connect to the address; connection timeout) and a TIMED OUT (could connect, but not responded in time; read timeout).... >Offline state is eg if the *.war application is undeployed in tomcat and thus physically removed. Then SBA usually shows the OFFLINE state.\nWhen Tomcat itself is running and just your application was undeployed I'd expect a DOWN status as the Tomcat should respond with a 404.. After having a night of sleep over this, I currently don't want to introduce a new TIMED_OUT status. The details of the OFFLINE status do contain an error-detail which tells you whether it was a connect  or a read timeout.. Do you have any easy steps (or at best a project) to reproduce this?. What ist the output for /applications?. closed due to missing feedback. For what reason do you want to subclass the InstanceWeblClient?. > Without subclassing this, I am not able to mutate the underlying WebClient per request and attach the correct SslContext.\nThe InstanceWebClient.Builder has a method that accepts a custom configured WebClient. Ah ok I see, I think it's pretty strange to have multiple certs for a single service (SBA). In case your SBA server gets corrupted you need to revoke multiple certs instead of one ...\nBut that shouldn't bother me. In order to keep things backwards compatible I'll merge this PR.\n. I'm currently thinking about a more elaborate solution, which wouldn't need to configure the names in the sba server...\n... The solution would include a derived application read model and also allow to throw new events (on application basis) so that we could do notifications based on the application and not the instances .... > Also, at some point, wouldn't you need to know all the existing applications ?... because the ones that are down never appeared\nUnless you make the data for SBA persistent, yes. sounds like a plan. And yes the applications-controller should get \"dumb\" at the end.. As  these are non-standard boot endpoints and SBA provides no views for them you need to configure it yourself using spring.boot.admin.probed-endpoints. for PCF at best use the spring cloud discovery client for cloudfoundry and read this short hints on it:\nhttps://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/current/#_cloudfoundry. Please use english.. Please make sure that the catalog watch (in SBA) recieves the update by setting the logger of org.springframework.cloud.consul.discovery.ConsulCatalogWatch to TRACE . Could you please also set the de.codecentric.boot.admin.server.cloud.discovery.InstanceDiscoveryListener to DEBUG.. >the problem occurs in this refresh() method. The specific code is as follows:\n\u00a0 String serviceId = this.config.getDiscovery().getServiceId();\nThe code is not inside the SBA project, isn't it?. >When it comes to consul, the refresh function in InstanceDiscoveryListener is not executed, and the log is not printed.\nWhich leads me to the conclusion that the spring cloud consul discovery client does not properly publish the Heartbeat event... Can you verify that? If yes it has to be fixed there.. @gxl191911 when having a close look at https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-consul/blob/master/spring-cloud-consul-discovery/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/consul/discovery/ConsulCatalogWatch.java it looks to me that the HeartBeatEvent is only published when a new service name appears (and not when a new node appears)  - can you verify that?\n. Using SBA 2.1.3 and Spring Cloud Consul 2.1.0.RELEASE I couldn't reproduce the issue. Registering additional services/nodes in consul are reflected in SBA.. I've improved the logging a bit. Could you please try the 2.1.4-SNAPSHOT version from our snapshot (repo https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/) with TRACE logging for org.springframework.cloud.consul.discovery.ConsulCatalogWatch and de.codecentric.boot.admin.server.cloud.discovery.InstanceDiscoveryListener and provide the full log?. closed due to missing feedback.. Please somehow provide a project to reproduce the issue, as I can't.... > Can you try to solve it?\nOnly if you provide a project to reproduce the issue.. > Yes, but how do I send my demo to you?\njust upload it as zip-file here (via drag 'n' drop). Any particular order for starting the services?. The new service is reported to SBA, but the discovery client doesn't report the new instance.\nIf you set spring.cloud.consul.discovery.query-passing=false the service instance is registered properly.. See https://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/current/#_running_behind_a_front_end_proxy_server. As #1019 is requesting a better solution for customizing the WebClient it should also include a appropriate example. I'm closing this as duplicate of #1019.. Please investigate spring-cloud-kubernetes for that, as SBA just picks up all instances retrieved via the discovery client. Usually SBA should run inside the cluster so that it can reach the applications by using the unmodified urls from discovery.\nThere are a few options to influence the conversion or it's possible to extend the DefaultServiceInstanceConverter and add a custom implementation.. OK. You just need ingress for accessing the SBA server, the SBA server itself forwards requests to the registered applications. Also helpful: https://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/current/#_running_behind_a_front_end_proxy_server.

Please provide a project to reproduce the problem. \nI just generated a off-the-shelf project on start.spring.io and everything is working fine.. closed due to missing feedback. You're using snake casing for your json. SBA relies on the default format.. Overall I didn't yet understand your exact problem so here are some questions:\n\nI have implemented Spring boot Admin client & server in my project and its successfully registering-an-application on the Spring boot Admin UI.\n\nWhich version are you using?\n\nWhenever application is deployed from PCF blue region to PCF green region it does not show the updates on the Spring boot Admin UI\n\nDo you miss the new version information or do you miss entire services? Do the instances from blue and green register at the same spring boot admin instance? Or do you use different admin servers for each region?\n\nI understand Spring Boot application auto-registers when the applicationContext is started and ready and this does not happen for PCF Blue to PCF Green deployments.\n\nIn fact (if you use spring-boot-admin-client) the application uses a scheduled task and registers over and over again.. > Then why my client is not registering over and over again? What am I missing?\nTry setting de.codecentric.boot.admin.client.registration.ApplicationRegistrator to DEBUG it may give you some insights\n\n(Spring-boot-admin-server - version 1.5.1) (Spring-boot-admin-client - version 1.5.7)\n\nI strongly advise you to upgrade to a 2.x version as it does have better support for CF routing. > Spring boot Admin should be upgraded to 2.X and Client can stay on 1.5.X?\nyes.\n\n[de.codecentric.boot.admin.client.registration.ApplicationRegistrator] - Application refreshed itself as 4b287e58\nI was trying the approach to invoke a rest service after each Blue/Green deployment which would invoke RegistrationApplicationListener.startRegisterTask().

So do your applications get a new name when going from blue to green?. >When PCF deploys from Blue to Green, it updates the route and the name of the application.\nInstance remains same, it will not be restarted and there would be zero impact to live traffic.\nDo you reconfigure the application at runtime?

Is application restart/restage the only option?\nNo you could use Spring Cloud's @RefreshScope. See https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/Greenwich.RELEASE/single/spring-cloud.html#_environment_changes\n\nYes we reconfigure application at runtime, updating the app route and name of the application.\n\nSo this means you're updating the spring.appliacation.name property?

Please provide a proper explanation and more details of your problem. With this little information I cannot help you. At best provide a project to reproduce the problem.. Thanks for the accurate description and the sample project. Had fun fixing it!. Thanks for the detailed bug report. \nAfter investigating the issue, I filed https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-bus/issues/151 because the problem is not caused by spring boot admin. The see issue for more details.. When an application is deregistered, it won't be reported as offline as no one misses it.\nHowever, you could extend InstanceDiscoveryListener and override the removeStaleInstances() to customize the behaviour...\nAlso there is already a feature request to check for minimum instances. spring.boot.admin.client.instance.service-base-url should include the scheme (e.g. http://)\nDid you also ensure that the url is reachable from the admin server?. > I think the IP address should look like the internal IP, why do it show an official IP address, and internal ip port? official IP uses 80 ports only ...\nSorry I don't get that.\nSpring Boot Admin Client is just taking the local ip-address and the local port. It doesn't know about other addresses (unless you tell it). closed due to missing feedback. can you post the response of /applications? Do you have any middleware in between maybe injecting some stuff?. Doing a mvn spring-boot:run on the admin-demo of you sample project works pretty well for me. I can't reproduce the issue. Could you please query the endpoint of the application directly and post the response (body and headers?) or provide a project to reproduce the issue.. closed due to missing feedback.. merged with acfa5b73f87363ac443d90398698c30886b306ae and polished with 9c7882c4193fe0db73fc98caa4a22e7fd859c37a. Instantiate the ApplicationRegistrator bean  using a custom configured RestTemplate, the client's autoconfig will back off then.. @patrick-vonsteht you just disabled the hostname verification, the trust chain is still validated, but this fails.. Yeah you need to add a @EnableConfigurationPropreties for these..\nWith 2.2.0 it will be easier to customize this as you don't need to instantiate the factory, just a thin wrapper class wrapping the RestTemplate..... duplicates #1083. reopened.. mixed up the numbers. Currently all instances will send the message as for the notifications there is no solution for clustering in place.\nThe exception should be solved with #1059.. >Is my config all messed up, or is the sample wrong?\ncan you provide a sample project?. Did you solve the issue yourself? The best is to start with a copy of our spring-boot-admin-sample-custom-ui module...\n. I guess DevTools would require a development profile build, which needs to be published with a different maven classifier. \nAlso importing from our bundle currently isn't possible as we don't export anything (and also the ui can't be required as npm module)\nI'm closing this issue as your original problem is solved.\nI'll think about your feedback regarding devTools and importing... . There slipped a little bug into the last release, causing the spinner to stay forever when no application is registered.. Thanks for spotting this mistake!. The code is from a sample where the SecuritySecureConfig is a nested class....  Issue found: You may have misspelled a JUnit framework method (setUp or tearDown)\n.  Issue found: Method names should not contain underscores\n.  Issue found: The user-supplied array 'delimiter' is stored directly.\n.  Issue found: Use of !important\n.  Issue found: Using width with padding-left can sometimes make elements larger than you expect.\n.

Move the local variable address out of this block and get rid of the getHostAddress() call in line 138.\n. Instead of writing a new StatusUpdater implementation I'd suggest to modify the existing one just setting the new details property of the ClientApplicationStatusChangedEvent to either the caught exception or the body of the response.\n. Instead of adding a new event class I suggest that a new property details of type Serializable is added to ClientApplicationStatusChangedEvent\n. Yeah the test should be all about the public methods. Should be no problem to test the behaviour of the private methods via the public api....\n. I don't have a problem with having a builder and a factory.\nThe former is just for ease of development/reading code and the latter on having (multiple) strategies on how to construct an object.\n. Please remove the guava usage.. Please fix this codacy issue. Please rename property to services. Tests are missing for this class.. Please don't rely on component scan - it might be disabled in the users' projects... since the service is in the config just remove the annotation. Please remove the wildcard import. All other notifier-beans are instantiated even if they are disabled. Please align to that.. Please add a correct content-type to the request. Depending on the order of the MessageConverters it happens that the requests end up being in xml. If you need a hint doing that please have a look at the LetsChatNotifier.. Please remove the wildcard import. Sorry that I spotted the foreign package declaration this late, but we can't include classes in foreign packages. It must be a de.codecentric package.\nThe downside seems that you cannot access the net.bull.javamelody.Parameters. So either you ask the javamelody guys to add a java-api to register applications in java melody or you need to make a post request to javameldoy's CollectorServlet.. Pleas go for a sensible default. Since the registration is performed periodically, \"breaking the behaviour\" should not be noticable.. Hmm... I wonder why the image isn't served by the admin server?. Please make the restTemplate final and inject it via constructor and remove the getter and setters to it. It would be cool if the message patterns can be customized.\nBut I don't insist on that if the effort ist excessive.. As the classes in de.codecentric.boot.admin.notify.microsoft.teams are just for the MicrosoftTeamsNotifier. Please move all classes from the MicrosoftTeamsNotifier as package private classes (default access modifier).. Why is this public api? please make this protected..

Don't hardwire the hashingInstanceUrlIdGenerator. superfluous comment . these three assignments are redundant, no need for local variables.\nAlso what is serviceBaseUrl used for? Imho it's ok to add instanceId and applicationId even when no url is present.. I'm currently wondering if we shouldn't make the auto-deregistration feature by default active even for non cloud-foundry... what do you think?. I'd rather instantiate the TaskScheduler in the constructor and also the afterPropertiesSet() of the TaskScheduler must be invoked!. I think it would be more suitable to have a package-private constructor to inject the mock so we don't rely on reflection.. the null check isn't needed when having the taskScheduler final an being set in the constructor.. the package-lock.json needs to be checked in and must not be ignored.. The projects ships a maven wrapper. No need for an extra package.. Lombok is defined in the maven dependencies. The extra debian package doesn't need to be installed for building... You only would need a lombok plugin for your favorite IDE.. Imho this is self-explanatory as node.js is required. Imho this is self-explanatory as jdk > 1.8 required. Please remove this additional dependency. Setting the content-type header for the request should do the job, as it's most likely that a json serializer is on the classpath.. Just pass along the Message object and let Spring's MessageConverter handle the serialization. Must not add state to the class. It will cause problems when doing concurrent notifications.. Imho server.getServlet().getContextPath(); should be moved to the ServletApplicationFactoryand replaced with /.. Shouldn't this line be removed?.

    "denschu": "Great! :-)\n. That looks a lot better ;-)) Thanks for the contribution!\n. I think we should implement it more dynamically. Maybe the Base URL could be configurable. The default should be blank.\n. Wow, a lot of great ideas :-) Thank you for this! Here are my short opinions about the points:\n1) Service Registration - We are using SBA to monitor the health of the applications. When an application shuts down gracefully and doesn't come up - maybe after redeployment - then we want to see it in SBA. So it would be great when you make this feature configurable over a flag. Maybe a manual deregistration option in the GUI would also be cool.\n2) Security -  The idea with @ EnableAdminServerSecurity sounds great :-)\n3) Service Discovery - I'm also very ambivalent at this point. There are a some great products outside (e.g. Eureka). I experimented with the registration implementation from Eureka, but I decided to replace it not with the simple existing solution. Mh, I think we should discuss if we would like to use SBA as a service discovery solution.\nPlease create feature branches for each of this points, so it's easier for us to get a detailed overview :-)\n. +1 for EnableAdminServerSwagger\n. Thank you for your idea. I already thought about this feature and from my point of view this makes sense. We are using SBA only in environments where we dont't have multiple apps of the same name. But in the future this could be also a use case for us. So feel free to make a pull request. But please do this in a separate branch and not in the enhancement branch from @RobWin, so it's easier for us to merge the stuff later :-)\n. It would be great, when \"Spring Boot Admin'\" is configurable :-)\n. spring.application.name is correct. info.id has a more informational character. Maybe we can remove it. I will also think about it and discuss it with the team...\n. Yes, the spring.application.name is the correct identifier. It's also used in Spring Cloud, so we should use it also here. I will have a deeper look in your changes...\n. Maybe it makes more sense to create separate PRs for each of the above topics. I will take a deeper look into the changes as soon as possible. \nOn Swagger: I saw in the code that it's not an optional dependency. 6 MB :-1:  -> https://speakerdeck.com/ankinson/documenting-restful-apis \nIs there another solution? Maybe we can use Spring HATEOAS and create hypermedia APIs...\n. I'm disappointed :-( I don't understand why @VanRoy didn't get in contact with us to discuss this functionality.\n. Yes, we thought about to provide another implementation of the ApplicationRegistry which is backed by Eureka etc. Pull-Request and ideas are also always welcome...\n. ",

    "RobWin": "I also added a Swagger API Documentation UI to the project.\nThe MicroService is \"self-documenting\".\n. Hi thx for your answer.\n1) I agree that applications shouldn't be removed automatically, if they are down. But in the case I shut down an application gracefully, it should unregister itself automatically. \nI've also added an unregister method to the controller and I would like to add the functionality to the SpringBootAdminClientAutoConfiguration that the application unregisters itself if the Spring context is shutdown gracefully.\nOne more enhancement idea: I would like to add a \n@ConditionalOnProperty(\"spring.boot.admin.enabled\") to the client auto configuration.\n2) I've added a spring-boot-admin-security maven-module which activates security, when you add the library and an EnableAdminServerSecurity annotation to your Application configuration. The type of security is BasicAuth and optinally a custom Security-mechanism, which could be project-specific. You can configure the optional Security-mechanism via Beans.\nI can push it to my repository if you would like to have a look at it. \nSensitive Actuator endpoints (like env, trace or metrics) of the client application might also be secured, or the management contextpath could be customized. \nIs there already an option in the Web Ui to customize the actuator endpoint URLs and security (e.g. BasicAuth)? \nI would suggest that the client application has to send detailed information about its Actuator endpoints during the registration phase (e.g. customized URLs, if an endpoint is secured and the security mechanism used). In that way a project is able to customize the contextpath and/or endpoints names. \n3) Spring Cloud Eureka and Hashicorps Consul also have Admin Uis included. Personally, I think that Service information and metrics also belong to a service discovery server. \nIn that way I could be able to select a service of a specific version, hostname/ip or datacenter. Either in the Admin Ui or via the Rest API. I think many features overlap.\n. I've updated my comment above. Please read again :)\n. Some more enhancements if have added. \n- You can register multiple instances of an application now.\n- The API is more Restful. Post returns Http code 201 Created and an location header now\n- Put updates the registered applications\n- many new integration tests oft the REST Api\n. I've added a spring-boot-admin-swagger Maven module which generates a swagger ui documenting the API if an EnableAdminServerSwagger annotation is added to the application.\n. The module spring-boot-admin-cache adds Hazelcast as the storage provider for the registry map\n. I would like to add the App Version, IP Address, Hostname and HealthcheckUrl to the Applications Model.\n. 1) We can reduce the traffic to the applications if the information of the index page is directly available via the Admin REST Api. Since the Clients currently do some sort of heartbeat anyway. \n2) We have the option to filter the list of registered applications also via the REST API. This is because we want to use it as a application registry.\n3) The Ui could retrieve the information from the REST API instead of querying the applications directly. (Only for the index page information. The rest is retrieved directly)\n. I've commited my changes to my fork into the branch \"telekom\". You can have a look at it. I made a lot of changes within the admin-server project. I also added ExceptionHandling and Integration-Tests.\nI still have to make changes in the admin-client project. I will change the registration/unregistration implementation and use the SmartLifecycle Interface of Spring to hook the registration/unregistration into the ApplicationContext Lifecycle.\n. Good idea.\n. Have a look at my new project https://github.com/RobWin/swagger2asciidoc\nIf you want to document a RESTful API with Swagger, but dont' want to have the runtime overhead.\n. Great thx.\n. I'm working on my fork on that and many other Features. if you like you can Support me. see my enhancement list in the other issue. \nkind regards \n. This is changed in my fork. There you will need spring.application.name and your actuator endpoint URL to register your app. Optionally you can provide info.version, info.hostname and info.ipaddress of your app.\nAnd you can register multiple instances of your app. You will get a unique ID for each instance. The ID is stored as info.instanceId then.\n. I'll commit my changes on wednesday\n. I've commited my changes to my fork into the branch \"telekom\". You can have a look at it. I made a lot of changes within the admin-server project. I also added ExceptionHandling and Integration-Tests.\nI still have to make changes in the admin-client project. I will change the registration/unregistration implementation and use the SmartLifecycle Interface of Spring to hook the registration/unregistration into the ApplicationContext Lifecycle.\n. Hello,\nI think the applications management url could be used as the unique identifier, but it should be the hash code of the url or the apllication object.\nIf you want to search for a registered application, you don't want to enter the whole management url as the search ID. \ne.g. http://localhost:8080/api/apllication/{http://localhost:8080/api/apllication/management}\nIn my solution, with Hazelcast as the storage provider, I create a cluster-wide unique ID for each registered application. \n. Changes:\n- Hazelcast is the storage provider of the Registry Map. You are able to start many spring-boot-admin instances and they build a distributed cache cluster. Hazelcast can be configured via the application.yaml config file.\n- The Registry API is more \"Restful\". RegisterApplication returns HTTP Code 201 \"Created\" and a location field now. UnregisterApplication and UnregisterAllApplications returns HTTP Code 204 \"No Content\". The API is documented via Swagger.\n- The Application domain model is immutable and can be build via the Builder pattern.\n- The spring-boot-admin-server module contains many new Integration Tests.\n- Correct Spring REST exception handling was added. All Spring exceptions are translated to the correct HTTP Codes now. A new \"ApplicationNotFound\" exception was introduced.\n. Hello Johannes,\nthanks for your comments.\nOn the caching: \n- Hazelcast cache is connected now.\n- At the moment it is not possible to switch the cache provider. I started to implement it with JCache Annotations, but I loose Hazelcast configuration options then.\nOn Security:\n- There is a lot of code, because it allows to customize Spring Security and allows us to add other Authentication mechanism than BasicAuth easily. I didn't have time to document/comment it yet. \n- The Code allows to use different Autentication mechanism and roles for the Registry API, Admin UI, Admin Actuator Endpoints and Swagger UI. For example i want to have Swagger UI not secured, but Admin UI accessible only for Admins and Registry API only for Client Applications and Admin UI.\n- The Admin Web UI is not updated yet. That's why Security is not enabled yet.\n- The Spring Boot Security AutoConfiguration can not handle that as flexible as this code can. \n  I have researched the Spring Boot SecurityAutoConfiguration a lot.\nOn the code:\n- Package issue was fixed\n- AdminServerAuthenticationEntryPoint and AdminServerWebAuthenticationDetails\n  and AdminServerAuthenticationToken are there for customization. If you need a more complex authentcation mechanism, you have to customize them. I did not delete the code, because I think it is valuable to know how to customize them.\n. Which thread view is gone missing? I cloned my base today?\n. I see. Thanks.\n. We need a git flow \"develop\" branch :)\nIt's not nice to merge everything in the master branch.\n. spring-boot-starter-admin-client is currently broken. I fix that. But its not an ApplicationContextListener yet.\nAlso the thread view is back in a minute.\n. The AdminServer creates a cluster-wide unqiue key for each registered application now.\nIt is therefore possible to Register multiple apps with a same name.\n. RAML would be an alternative, but its not code first, but contract first. http://raml.org/index.html\nThere is only a Jax-RS to RAML module, but no for Spring MVC. \nSwagger will drop Scala soon. So the dependecy should be smaller in some weeks.\n. I will have a look at the spring-restdocs project\n. OK. Thx. What about my Integration Tests and Restful API changes? HTTP Codes etc..\n. Looks great.\n- Application model is immutable.\n- ConfigurationProperties instead of Environment injection.\nI have three findings:\n- Does the SpringBootAdminRegistrator work, if an HttpStatus.CONFLICT was thrown by the AdminServer? Because I thought 4XX return codes (409 Conflict) throw a RestClientException. And you won't be able to check that in your code.\nelse if (response.getStatusCode().equals(HttpStatus.CONFLICT)) {\nI had the same issues with HTTP return code 404 NotFound. Have a look at my Client code.\n- Currently the RegistryController and SimpleApplicationRegistry are not ThreadSafe. We should use  a ConcurrentHashMap in the SimpleApplicationRegistry and the corresponding methods of the ConcurrentMap interface. Currently there is a  \"check-then-act\" or \"read-modify-write\" race condition possible (even if it is an uncertain event).\n- I think the JSON MessageConverter can be removed from the Client and Server configuration. From my knowledge the JSON Converter is registered by default in a Spring Boot application. Am I correct?\n. Ok. I see. But can Spring handle two different configured JSON MessageConverters?\n. +1\n. You mean something like\nhttps://github.com/VanRoy/spring-cloud-dashboard\n It's a fork of Spring Boot Admin to manage applications registered in service registry (like Eureka).\nNot everyone wants to use or can use something like Eureka.\n. Wow influxDB looks neat. Thx\n. A spring.boot.admin.enabled property would still be nice and more intuitive than leaving spring.boot.admin.url empty.\n. Ok. Do you have an objection if I change \n@ConditionalOnProperty(\"spring.boot.admin.url\") to \n@ConditionalOnProperty(\n        prefix = \"spring.boot.admin.client\",\n        name = {\"enabled\"},\n        matchIfMissing = true\n    )\nThe client would be enabled by default. But it would break backward compability. \nOr do you want me to write a more complex SpringBootClientEnablerCondition which extends SpringBootCondition and checks both properties?\n. Ok. I've already created a new issue.\n. Spring Boot and Supervisord are a nice combination. \nI created a small Python tool supervisorclusterctl which uses Ansible to control a cluster of Supervisord daemons remotely.\nBut you could also use Ansible directly.\n. I like the HazelCast implementation of the ApplicationStore.\n- It allows me to set-up spring-boot-admin in a reliable cluster.\n- The data is not lost, if I deploy a newer version of spring-boot-admin.\n- I would even store the Journal Events in the Hazelcast data grid.\n. You could also extract it into an own optional module and use auto-configuration if it is added to the classpath.\n. I also like the idea. :+1: \nI could also contribute if  @joshiste agrees.\n. Yes. Just getting rid of unnecessary dependencies.\n. And what about a separate endpoints module which can be plugged-in via a conditional bean? Similar to the admin-client-starter module? Just a management extension which can be added as a dependency by people who need it?\n. Ok\n. Ok. I change the PR next week.\n. The config-metadata is only used in the spring-boot-admin-server. Shall I still create a config-metadata file in spring-boot-admin-starter-client?\n. I fix the tests on monday. \n. If this PR is ok for you, I would update the documentation.\n. Yes I can squash them. Can I use the eclipse-formatter with IntelliJ as well?\n. I have squashed the commits, updated the documentation and reformatted the code using the Eclipse Formatter.\n. Thx.\nWhich E-Mail address do you mean?\n. Very nice :)\n. ",

    "shakuzen": "I have made the changes for this in my fork's feature/hostname branch.\nI just need to update the example and readme (including new screenshot of main page), and then I will make a pull request for it.\nThis is a sort of breaking change, unfortunately. I could not come up with a better way to do it. I had to switch to using the application name as the key for the registry instead of the ID, which was being set as the artifact id. This is in order to differentiate between instances of the same app. Additionally, I put the URL to the client app on the main page, which does make it a bit crowded and not always display the best... but I am not very good at UI. I am certainly open to suggestions on how to improve this... Perhaps make the application name a clickable link to the URL instead? It could also display the URL when hovering over the name.\n. This sounds neat, @RobWin. I'd love to take a look at the changes. Let me know when you have pushed them to your repo. In a (perhaps temporary/interim?) solution I just submitted as a pull request, I have gone with the spring.application.name as the key for registration of a specific instance. The info.id is something I intend to be the same for different instances of the same application. However, I am not entirely satisfied with my solution, so perhaps yours would be better. I look forward to taking a look at it.\n. Looks like I need to update the unit tests for the server module. I will take a look at this tomorrow if I have time.\n. > When there are many environments where the Spring Boot Admin server will be deployed to, it would be helpful to see the environment name as part of the UI.\nThis seems like a great idea, given that Spring Boot Admin makes it easier to use actuator endpoints that can affect the behavior of applications. It is important to make users aware of which environment they are interacting, and just having different URLs is often overlooked.\nChanging the background color is another way to help distinguish between environments.. We're also interested in this support and are willing to help. As far as I understand, without this support, there is no way for the instance status in SBA to be accurate in a Cloud Foundry environment since it isn't necessarily being routed to the instance it thinks it is (unless there's only one instance, of course).. @joshiste \n\nPlease write a dedicated CloudFoundryInstanceIdGenerator and a dedicated CloudFoundryHttpHeaderProvider without modyfing the existing implementations.\nThe CloudFoundry-* implementations should be instantiated via AutoConfiguration detecting that the server is running on cloudfoundry.\n\nI initially thought the same thing, but the need for these Cloud Foundry-aware variants is actually dependent on the Spring Boot Admin client's platform, not the server's platform. In many organizations, this could be expected (assumed?) to always be the same, but not in all. Alternatively, all clients may not be running on Cloud Foundry - this is actually true of my organization's current situation. Furthermore, these variants (as they are implemented now) do not negatively affect the behavior of clients that are not on Cloud Foundry, since those clients won't send the Cloud Foundry-specific metadata. Though, of course, I agree this should be demonstrated in tests.\nWould you still prefer separate classes given the above?. You can add those values to the environment in an EnvironmentPostProcessor that is conditionally registered when CloudFoundry is detected.. @joshiste \n\nmay be this needs the concept for a MetadataContributor in the client project...\n\nIt does seem a MetadataContributor concept would be helpful for the client-side implementation. Using an EnvironmentPostProcessor or just injecting and mutating the metadata in a @Configuration class feels like more of a workaround.. @joshiste in your testing, did you see how much native memory was used?\nIn briefly searching about the issue, I came across this blog which advises configuring Netty's leak detection. This guide from Oracle might also prove helpful in investigating this issue.. Please try with the latest release version of Spring Boot. Currently that is 2.0.1.RELEASE. The RC1 version you are using won't be compatible with the latest snapshots of Spring Boot Admin.. @joshiste I debugged this some, and the root context is the Spring Cloud bootstrap context. For reasons I still don't understand, it doesn't get the ClosedContextEvent, which I can reproduce in an application with only the spring-cloud-starter dependency and an @EventListener for ContextClosedEvent. It is only called for the main application's ClosedContextEvent. So I don't think the auto-deregistration when on a cloud platform feature is working for any applications using Spring Cloud.. We explored this internally a bit, and the only way we could come up with to get the latest route information for a running app programmatically is to call the Cloud Foundry Cloud Controller with the cf-java-client, for example. In addition to the added dependency, this would require extra configuration for credentials. It all seemed too much, and we changed our process so that apps are restarted if routes are changed. It isn't ideal, but I'm not sure the alternative is better (calling the controller for the current routes every registration request, from every instance). For reference, the groupings @joshiste proposed were:\n\n\ndetails\nmetrics\nconfig\nenv\n(configprops in future may be - at least there is a feature request)\nlogging\nlogfile\nloggers\njvm:\njmx\nheapdump\nthreadump\nweb\nmappings\nhttp-traces\nsecurity\nauditevents\nsessions\ndata\ncaches (with 2.1.x)\nflyway\nliquibase\nscheduled tasks. This property source name seems a little misleading. Something that indicates the property source is added for spring Boot Admin clients on cloud foundry would be better, in my opinion.. It might be a good idea to make this conditional on the user not having specified the property. Personally, I don't think it makes sense to disable auto-deregistration on cloud foundry, but a user should nonetheless have the ability to do so easily if desired.. Will this cause an exception on startup if there is no route mapped to the application? Perhaps checking for that should be worked into the condition since it doesn't make sense to register with spring Boot Admin without an accessible http route, I think.. I know this name was chosen to match the DiscoveryClient, but I find it a little unfortunate. There is such a thing as the instance ID, which is a GUID like the application ID. This property is really the instance index, as it is named in the VCAP application properties.. It's a tough call, I think. It depends on users' environment/platform and practices. If always deploying the same instances to the same machines, it might be nice to see an instance is down (stopped) in between deploys/restarts. Perhaps opening a separate issue and gathering feedback would be a good idea.. Does this need to be done in a custom InstanceProperties class? It seems like this logic could be done in the EnvironmentPostProcessor, which would maybe be a bit more intuitive since the only purpose of extending InstanceProperties here seems to be to conditionally set serviceBaseUrl; not to add any additional properties as one might expect from extending.. I know that the CloudFoundryVcapEnvironmentPostProcessor adds the property with this name, but we should probably follow the Relaxed Binding 2.0 advice and use the uniform format here and anywhere else. That is, kebab-case: vcap.application.application-id. I also wonder if it would be better practice to make something like a VcapApplicationProperties class that is annotated with @ConfigurationProperties(\"vcap.application\") and the fields we want. Then pass that in the constructor to this class, rather than using @Value annotations to inject individual properties. That would also make testing this class easier.. Doesn't this bean need to be marked @Primary because there is more than one InstanceIdGenerator bean?. This appears to not be used.. \n\n",

I'd also say that the UI is fine as it is, but some kind of plugin system to add custom pages would be good. What if we make the \"apps\" dynamic? The thing you call \"apps\" are the pages that are reflected in the navbar. It would be cool if you could package your new endpoint in a separate webjar that would be picked up by that plugin mechanism.\nMaybe naive, but what about this:\n- Projects with new endpoints package their own webjar with their JavaScript and their view.\n- We have a configuration with the following information per app / endpoint\n  - url (/env)\n  - templateUrl (views/apps/environment.html)\n  - controller (environmentCtrl)\n  - JavaScript - Location (js/app.js)\n- We import all different JavaScript - Locations in index.html (maybe through rendering with Thymeleaf)\n- The AngularUI reads that configuration and generates everything regarding apps dynamic\nMaybe naive, because I don't have any clue about Angular.

Thanks for feedback.\nI implemented some proof of concept, see this commit \nhttps://github.com/mariusznet/spring-boot-admin/commit/b59b6151a0d2e641f8ea4801b9dcfd6208382cca\nThis is really far from perfect, but should be sufficient to pass the idea :)\nYes, you are right - all endpoints are reachable from private network only. If we add basic auth via https it should be enough to meet company security policy. \nOn the other hand, integration with oauth2 flow in addition/instead to basic auth would be great also.\n. Just one more thing, to get this authorization prototype to work filter\nhttps://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/blob/master/spring-boot-starter-admin-client/src/main/java/de/codecentric/boot/admin/web/EndpointCorsFilter.java\nshould also accept authorization header.\n. That's true. but Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true header is missing.\nhttp://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/#toc-adding-cors-support-to-the-server\nNevertheless we made it works, without application modifications. Admin application is secured by basic auth, and all clients have the same credentials. On admin app node we have apache proxy, with rules per client app. Finally, when we authenticate in admin app browser does the rest without cors problems, because all clients endpoints are available under http://admin.app.com/client_url.com/actuator. Not the best solution, because for each client app we need to create new rule in proxy settings, but works ;)\n. I like this idea. I'm using something very alike with custom eureka based ApplicationStore, and everything works like a charm, including basic auth. \nPlus, using proxy allows to secure actuator endpoints just by setting listening address to 127.0.0.1 and only set up security in admin application, if everything is working on one server.\n.

So there is currently no way to protect the standard entpoints in spring-boot and use the spring-boot-admin-ui. \nWhat do you mean with configuration option? An option in the spring-boot-admin server? But then I cant dynamically register and deregister service without changing manually the configuration. \nFor now I assume that I have to leave those endpoints unproteced and secure my business endpoints with spring-security as usual.

I will close the ticket.\n. ",
    "ashwgupt": "@joshiste looking at this thread it tells that one must secure actuator endpoints for all of the application with same credentials should the actuator endpoints need to be protected.\nIf that understanding is correct - It can't be done in real production world, where we wouldn't be allowed to keep it same. Is there a work-around possible for it?\nIf this understanding is wrong, or if things have changed since last update on this issue - Can you please help me point to the documentation that tells how to configure different security credential for each app while registering itself with SBA server?. @abracadv8 thanks for the tip. As am using the latest SBA version and spring-boot 1.4, let me try to use the ApplicationFactory to inject the a CF compatible bean.\nShall report back the results.. Using the versions as mentioned above, we could overcome the erroneous status for the microservices showing on SBA.\nBelow is the code snippet used to achieve it:\n```\n@Configuration\n@Conditional(SpringBootAdminClientEnabledCondition.class)\npublic class BootAdminClientConfig {\n@Autowired\nprivate ManagementServerProperties managementServerProperties;\n\n@Autowired\nprivate ServerProperties serverProperties;\n\n@Bean\npublic AdminClientProperties adminClientProperties(){\n    AdminClientProperties clientProperties = new AdminClientProperties();\n    clientProperties.setHealthUrl(\"https://bootadmin-ms-charlie.abc.com/health\");\n    clientProperties.setManagementUrl(\"https://bootadmin-ms-charlie.abc.com/management\");\n    clientProperties.setServiceUrl(\"https://bootadmin-ms-charlie.abc.com/\");\n    return clientProperties;\n}\n\n@Bean\npublic ApplicationFactory applicationFactory(ManagementServerProperties management,\n        ServerProperties server,\n        @Value(\"${endpoints.health.path:/${endpoints.health.id:health}}\") String healthEndpointPath) {\n    return new DefaultApplicationFactory(adminClientProperties(),\n            management, server, healthEndpointPath);\n}\n\n}\n```\nI will ultimately replace the URL values with those from CF env, as you suggested. \nIf you see any other scope of improvement in it, please advise.\nAnd I would request either of you @abracadv8 or @joshiste to reply back on my Stackoverflow post - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41742918 as an answer so that I can accept it and make available for others to refer.. I just tried it and found the status to be doubtful, as out of my apps 2 instances running on CF, any one is showed as Online while other showes as Offline.\nIPs are not the preferred the way to work with on CF for the reason that, the IPs may change/masked/nat'ed when traffic passes through CF Router.. I've noticed that the simple app properties can also help in achieving the same. So in my view that's the preferred choice than creating a new config class.\nspring:\n  boot:\n    admin:\n      client:\n        management-url: \n        health-url: \n        service-url:\n. Here is all that we had to configure in properties file for our client apps' run on Cloud Foundry:\nspring:\n  application:\n    name: microservice-alpha\n  boot:\n    admin:\n      register-once: false\n      url: https://bootadmin-dashboard.az1.abc.com,https://bootadmin-dashboard.az2.abc.com\n      client:\n        service-url: https://microservice-alpha.az1.abc.com\n\nIt is for an application - microservice-alpha running on AZ1 of our private Cloud Foundry setup. The service-url will change for instances running on AZ2\n\nI hope it helps.. Yeah, I could have but after a debate and evaluation we wanted to keep it simple.\nUsing VCAP_APPLICATION_URIS[] could be a way out to achieve the same. But given in our topology we have multiple routes bound to an app on CF, varying from F5 GTM level to LTM level, using CF variable to find out the service DNS may not be very effective as we may not know the exact sequence of routes set in env.\nWe wanted an app to register itself with the server using the AZ specific route (LTM level) for sanity and ease of understand of correct status on dashboard, and hence the choice.\nLet me try to showcase a case of using the CF Env to set it up for use in a simpler topology unlike ours.. Below will be the code snippet if one wants to populate the application URI from the CF environment:\nspring:\n  application:\n    name: microservice-alpha\n  boot:\n    admin:\n      register-once: false\n      url: https://bootadmin-dashboard.az1.abc.com,https://bootadmin-dashboard.az2.abc.com\n      client:\n        service-url: https://${vcap.application.application_uris[0]}.

    "mar1ged": "I too am fascinated by the great insight Spring Boot Admin gives for my applications and miss the timers. But I think it is difficult to decide which values to display and with which type of diagram. Perhaps it is easiest to display three charts for the rates, the percentiles and the snapshot values which compare the 4 / 5 values. This could be bar charts which makes it easy to compare for example max, mid and mean value. Combining multiple timers into one diagram could be difficult to handle when one time is in the low milliseconds while the other is in the higher seconds range.\n. From my point of view the UI does not need to be changed. It looks good and is easy to handle.\nIf I were the one to decide I would say add more functions (timer metrics for example, https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/issues/41 ;-)) instead of putting effort into changing the UI. At least as long as the \"old\" UI does not keep you from adding new functions or makes it unbearable difficult.\n.

You were correct about not needing a new RestTemplate. Adding the java.net.ssl JVM properties was enough for the client application to ping the server successfully with x509 client authentication.\n\nHowever the server cannot complete the requests back to the client using the SimpleHostRoutingFilter. It does not build the HTTP client with an SSLContext that can make a secure connection back to the client. It uses a custom SSLSocket which (appears) not to load the key or trust store information. This may be an issue I can bring up with the spring-cloud-netflix project.\nShall I close this pull request? I can maintain a fork and use it until Spring Cloud can update that class, but as it stands now it will not work when the client requires x509 authentication.\n. Sounds good. I will submit a new pull request as not to pollute the commit\nhistory. This one can be closed.\n-Steve\nOn May 3, 2015 1:34 PM, \"Johannes Stelzer\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI'd bee keen to do the changes to AdminClientProperties.\nAnd the SecureHostRoutingFilter should be addressed in\nhttps://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/pull/68#issuecomment-98512965\n.\n.

Just my opinion, but I think the UI as it is now is fine.\n- unsure what type of customization you are referring to. What would you\n  want that wouldn't require modifying the source? Custom styling?\n- i18n could be  achieved using something like angular-translate (\n  https://github.com/angular-translate/angular-translate)\n- authentication can be done however the consumer wants to implement it.\n  For example, I am using the Admin server with SSL mutual authentication.\n  Are you referring more to authenticating with the registered apps? OAuth\n  could maybe help with this.\n- perhaps this is true, but I don't see that as a reason so rewrite the UI.\n  Right tools for the right job. Personally, this project helped me learn\n  about a node based build and angular applications.\n\nUltimately you are making the call on this, but I wanted to share my\nexperience with it. I have been using and following the repo for about a\nyear now and have been quite happy with everything. I'm surprised that\nPivotal has not shown interest in adopting this project as part of Spring\nBoot Actuator.\nKeep up the good work.\nOn Jan 15, 2016 1:53 AM, \"Johannes Edmeier\" notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nCurrently we have following issues with the ui, wich pops up quite often:\n- No support for configuring/customizing the ui\n- No support for i18n\n- No sophisticated support for authentication\n- Java-devs are quite unfamiliar with the node.js based build\nAdditionally we could improve these things:\n- Responsive design\n- Use server sent events (SSE) for status updates to reduce lag for\n  status updates\nSo after-all I think the ui should be rewritten.

We solved the security problem by using SSL mutual authentication on the\nAdmin Server application and passing the user credentials to the monitored\napplications via headers in a ZuulFilter. The applications run behind a\nfirewall and are only accessible through a reverse proxy (nginx) and from\nthe Admin Server. This works well in a private organization where you can\ngenerate your certificates using a private CA.\n\nI am sure that this could be solved somehow with OAuth2 as well however I\ndon't have experience working with it. Our applications are behind a\ncorporate firewall so we don't use OAuth2 providers and don't have our own\nresource/token server at this time.\nI could certainly write something in the docs about \"Securing Using SSL\nMutual Authentication\" and document what I've done if you are interested in\nimplementation details.\n-Steve\nOn Jan 19, 2016 5:50 AM, \"Johannes Edmeier\" notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n@steve-oakey https://github.com/steve-oakey I am interested in how you\nsolved security.

For authentication, a login page that matches the look and feel of the rest\nof the UI would be nice, but authentication to the web application itself\nshould be up to the user. I may want to implement Basic Auth, LDAP\nauthentication, SSL mutual authentication, OAuth, leave that up to me.\n\nThe bigger issue right now is handling the authentication to the\napplications the Spring Boot Admin application is monitoring. Currently\nonly basic auth (or nothing is supported) and this requires every client\napplication to have the same username/password. This is not ideal. To me a\nbetter solution is to proxy the user credentials to the applications being\nmonitored (not required to simply check the health but for each of the\nother pages) and have each of those applications decide if the user is able\nto access the specific endpoints.\n- Steve\n. @joshiste @mirwais27 If I recall correctly, the DefaultServiceInstanceConverter is created and marked with @ConditionalOnMissingBean but this would be conditional on a missing bean of type DefaultServiceInstanceConverter. The method signature should probably return ServiceInstanceConverter so that any bean of type ServiceInstanceConverter would override the default one. A work-around to that would be to have ConsulServiceInstanceConverter extend DefaultServiceInstanceConverter which should then cause the bean in the auto-configuration to not be created.\n. My bad, been so long since I submitted a PR I was unaware that it created an issue! \n. You can secure it however you'd like, it's just a Spring Boot application. You're embedding the server with @EnableAdminServer ... you can still write whatever security configuration code you want to suit your needs. Add spring-boot-starter-security to your dependencies and you have Basic Auth out of the box, for\nexample.\n. They do, but if you compare it to the stock Hystrix Dashboard, it is easier\n(maybe just in my opinon) to see a large number of graphs if they are\nspread out horizontally rather than vertically. I just think it's better to\nuse the whole space rather than just a percentage of it in this case.\n-Steve\nOn Dec 2, 2016 6:03 PM, \"Johannes Edmeier\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nIf there are too many graphs for one row the wrap around, don't they?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/issues/348#issuecomment-264586109,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ADzkI-Hu4uriD8V4nTNsJz2VUyCASiY2ks5rEKOsgaJpZM4LC1TD\n.\n.

From current snapshot doc :By default, Turbine looks for the /hystrix.stream endpoint on a registered instance by looking up its homePageUrl entry in Eureka, then appending /hystrix.stream to it. This means that if spring-boot-actuator is running on its own port (which is the default), the call to /hystrix.stream will fail. To make turbine find the Hystrix stream at the correct port, you need to add management.port to the instances' metadata:\n\nhttp://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/spring-cloud-netflix.html @Turbine\n. ",
    "mrumpf": "OK, I understand. We separated the Admin UI & the Hystrix Dashboard from the Eureka and Config server now.\np.s. You can set the server.contextPath, but that moves all applications to a new context path.\n. There is a section in the Hystrix Wiki about embedding the dashboard functionaility into another dashboard:\nhttps://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/Dashboard#customizing-and-embedding\n. I would like to disagree here. ZuulProxy is a functionality that can be used in different ways.\nOne is the \"API Gateway / Edge Service\" way how Netflix is using Zuul. The other one is to do some simple proxying to admin functionality for example that is used by a small group of admins only.\nWe have an admin microservice which does several things:\n1. Host the codecentric spring-boot-admin \n2. Host the Hystrix Dashboard\n3. Host the Netflix Vector UI\n4. Use the admin microservice as a (Zuul) proxy to different admin features of other microservices (single entry point; api gateway) for a very limited scope of admin functionality\nI agree with you that the non-related features \"Eureka\", \"Spring Cloud Config\", and \"Spring Boot Admin\" should not be put into one microservice, but adding several admin related features in one service is a valid approach in my opinion. We are not running on a PaaS platform yet and creating a new microservice involves some initial setup effort and continuous maintenance effort from operations. Adding a new microservice in such a corner case is not a reasonable option.\n. :) I also prefer living in a simple world. Unfortunately reality is more complex. The corporate environment I live in changes very slowly. Yes, we are automating a lot of stuff, providing new VMs for an application is not part of it because our IT provider still lives in the \"old\" world and I cannot change that. Besides that the customer has chosen to use static infrastructure instead of a dynamic cloud environment. These are the reasons why we are forced not to move every little aspect into a separate microservice because the maintenance bill would explode.\nBut anyway, thanks for your time.\n. There must be a choice on whether an action should be executed on one or on multiple nodes.\nWhen debugging a high traffic application it is probably wise to enable DEBUG level for one logger only for one node out of many nodes.\nBut when a service's log is too noisy, it would be cool to set the log to a silent level on all nodes at once. Especially if you have more than 2 nodes.. We are approaching 150 microservices in our system soon. With the Spring Boot Admin server a user can easily change the configuration or the log level of any microservice in the system, although the user should only be able to do that for a small fraction of the 150 microservices. \nI know that SBA uses the Actuator endpoints of Spring Boot and adding an audit feature would not prevent someone from doing a curl against the Actuator endpoints directly, but having a central place in SBA where all write operations are logged would be very convenient to check what was modified. The following operations are of interest:\n Override config values\n Change log levels\n* Create thread dumps\nThe issue I see is that SBA does not have the concept of a user. But we run SBA behind a SSO solution so that we have a HTTP header parameter which contains the user identity.. The centralization and the content of the audit logging is the idea here.\nThe Actuator audit logging provides \"login auditing\" events only (per default):\nhttps://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-auditing.html\nWe use an ELK stack for making all our log files searchable.\nI see 2 possible solutions:\n1. Add an auditing feature to SBA\n  * Con: This is not bullet proof because one could use curl to do modifications\n  * Pro: No additional software necessary to get an overview on all config events\n2. Extend the auditing feature of Spring Actuator so that config changes, log level changes and thread dumps are written to the audit log.\n  * Con: This solution has the drawback that you need e.g. an ELK stack to collect all logs from all instances.\n  * Pro: It covers all invocations to the Spring Actuator endpoints, even the ones that do not get triggered by SBA \nSo in our case, because we already have ELK in place, solution 2 would be fine. For those not having this in place, solution 1 would be preferrable.. Thanks for the hint. We will give that a try.. ",

Thanks @joshiste! I will try test 1.4.5-SNAPSHOT.. There are problems with metrics, environment, threads and http traces tab.\nActuator data are fetched successfully. The errors occous in JS.\n\n. ",

    "staleks": "Ok, to put more info in investigation of this issue.\nI've checked more logs and found that on Spring Cloud Config Server (another component of my system), I was receiving 404. \nI checked the reason for this, and found out that I had this in application.yml of Spring Cloud Config Server\nmanagement:\n     context-path: /admin\nAs a side effect, spring cloud config wasn't be able to find\nlocalhost:8888/health, but rather it was moved to localhost:8888/admin/health\nOnce I get this to default one, Spring Boot Admin was able to start.\nNow I can get admin-ui but I can see just 3 services:\n- config server (port: 8888)\n- itself, spring boot admin (port: 8585) and\n- zuul (port: 8765)\nI have other services, 2, 3 more microService that I can see from eureka side, but those are not visible from Spring Boot Admin app.\n. Hi,\nyou just made your point :)\nYou are 100% right, so this part is producing exception:\npublic void discover() {\n        for (String serviceId : discoveryClient.getServices()) {\n            for (ServiceInstance instance : discoveryClient.getInstances(serviceId)) {\n                registry.register(convert(instance));\n            }\n        }\n    }\nSo I have Eureka UP, and Cloud-Config UP and my first microService UP.\nStarting Spring Boot Admin, in a debug mode, I've put break-point in for and I see that\ndiscoveryClient.getServices() has two elements. That was expected, I guess :) Eureka anyway shouldn't be in this list.\nSo elements are:\n- my microService and\n- cloud config server.\nMethod registry.register(convert(instance)); pass OK for my microService, while 2nd service, \ncloud config server, fails on that method registry.register(convert(instance));.\nError is same as I've already posted, so I don't want to repeat myself.\njava.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.Integer cannot be cast to java.lang.String\n. My spot light goes to this:\nPlease note that there is convert(instance).\nI've debbuged a bit more:\nString healthUrl = append(managementUrl, healthEndpoint);\nWhen I execute this: I've got\n2015-11-07 21:28:32.895 DEBUG 10116 --- [  restartedMain] o.s.web.client.RestTemplate              : GET request for \"http://192.168.1.103:8888/health\" resulted in 404 (Not Found)\nwhich is clearly not ok, since it has mngmt part /admin before /health.\n. Actually, your previous suggestion fixed that stuff.\n. I've just downloaded it and start all 4:\n- eureka\n- cloud config server\n- my microService and\n- spring boot admin\nEverything is fine so far.\nRelated to your last post, I am even wondering if I will need config server to have /admin, but\nthat was some example that I've used in process of evaluation.\nCan you tell me, what is road map for 1.3.0-SNAPSHOT ?\nRelease comming soon ?\n. Further more, I've noticed that services that has log defined, I don't need jolokia anymore? Am I right?\n. yes, you can close. \nThank You for support.\n. ",
    "arunkpatra": "@joshiste I totally agree with you - it makes total sense to use seperate JVMs for production deployments. But for dev/integration/systest environments I would think quite a few users would be using a single JVM - and especially for these type of environments folks would like to tweak log levels to debug.\nI like your thought of looking for a MBean with the user's app-name as the contextName. \nCheers!\nArun\n. @joshiste Works like a charm!

I found a reason for that - Zuul will only load Spring Boot configuration when spring-cloud-netflix-core is in dependencies, thanks to ArchaiusAutoConfiguration.

Unfortunately I'm not allowed to do that (company restrictions).\nThis is my pom:\n<dependency>\n         <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>\n         <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>\n         <version>1.3.0.RELEASE</version>\n</dependency>\nI can also see it on the classpath in your Admin Server GUI. :) There is definetly no classpath conflict or more than one version. Concerning actuator, it looks exactly the same as in your 'spring-boot-admin-sample' App (where the logfile-Endpoint does show up). Very strange...\n/Users/mdengel/.m2/repository/org/springframework/boot/spring-boot-starter-actuator/1.3.0.RELEASE/spring-boot-starter-actuator-1.3.0.RELEASE.jar\n/Users/mdengel/.m2/repository/org/springframework/boot/spring-boot-actuator/1.3.0.RELEASE/spring-boot-actuator-1.3.0.RELEASE.jar\n. Ahh, I figured it out! \nThere seems to be a Bug in actuator 1.3.0 when using a different management port! I always used another one for our own apps due to security reasons (management port is only accessible locally).\nserver.port=8085\nmanagement.port=8086\nThis configuration (with different ports) leads to the fact that the /logfile endpoint is not available anymore via /configprops! If I use the same port for both, everything works as expected. I can reproduce this behaviour in both projects. \nThanks for your help anyway! The admin server is a great project. Would love to see a nice overview of the /flyway endpoint (introduced in Spring Boot 1.3). :)\n. ",
    "fastnsilver": "Nevermind, I figured this out myself.\nFor others interested, I fell back to the @EnableDiscoveryClient based registration of clients w/ Spring Boot Admin server instance.  \nAll I did was update the configs above and added a spring-cloud-starter-eureka dependency in each of the admin and client POMs.  I use an environment variable to set the active Spring profile in docker-compose.yml.\nSee this commit for how I changed things up to make everything work:\nhttps://github.com/fastnsilver/grivet/commit/63dfbdf515f012839cdb65872b062be1bf2c0cfc\n. I removed all occurrences of spring.boot.admin.url as you saw.   Anyhow, I'm good with the discovery approach rather than with having to add spring-boot-admin-client dependency to all client POMs.  And as for not being able to look at logs, well, in my setup, I pump logs to logstash so I can see them there.\n. In AdminServerPrroperties we'll need to update the embedded RoutesProperties.endpoints to be \n//@see https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.0.0-M1-Release-Notes#actuator-default-mapping\n        private String[] endpoints = {\"application/env\", \"application/metrics\", \"application/trace\", \"application/dump\", \"application/jolokia\", \"application/info\", \"application/logfile\", \"application/refresh\", \"application/flyway\", \"application/liquibase\", \"application/heapdump\", \"application/loggers\", \"application/auditevents\"};. Trying out the sample with as-is, cannot login.  Some Spring Security adjustments will be required.. Note to self... on a Mac you will want to update your /etc/hosts as per second answer here. Why? So that when DefaultApplicationFactory.getLocalHost() gets invoked it will resolve InetAddress for localhost properly.. Latest updates get us most of way there.  Something about security is still not registering/enabling the application/health endpoint and that is why the status always reports DOWN.  Note: default username and password has changed from user/pass to admin/admin.\nNext round of updates will include some updates to README documentation.. No problem.  I'll continue on my own.  Thanks for considering.. ",
    "aayushgupta": "Thanks a lot!.. it worked after upgrading the boot version to 1.3.0.

I am gonna try by removing the spring-hateaos, but like already mentioned, I have already upgraded my admin server to 1.3.0.. \n. Thanks a lot!! As mentioned by Praveen, it is resolved now. We are using swagger2 (2.3.0) that internally pulls hateoas-0.19.0.RELEASE.\n. Hey Johannes, I had explicitly excluded the hateoas-0.19.0.RELEASE jar file, and that led the boot 1.3.0 to generate the output as expected.\n But swagger fails to generate the API documentation, as it looks for hateoas-0.19.0.RELEASE jar.\nI think its not the swagger behavior that affects the /metrics output, because I also created a sample application adding spring-boot-starter-hateaos to boot 1.3.0, it still generates the /metrics output in format as follows.\n{\n    \"value\": {\n        \"mem\": 217628,\n        ..\n    },\n    \"serializationView\": null,\n    \"filters\": null,\n    \"jsonpFunction\": null,\n    \"_links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n            \"href\": \"http://localhost.com:8080/app/metrics\"\n        }\n    }\n}\nspring-boot-starter-hateaos automatically pulls in hateoas-0.19.0.RELEASE jar dependency.\nCan you make sure your sample app (adding spring-boot-starter-hateaos to boot 1.3.0) has boot 1.3.0 dependencies there in classpath. As it happened to me as well, when I scanned libraries in my eclipse project, it was referencing to boot 1.2.6 jar files.\n. @joshiste Hey you can pull the code from GIT\nhttps://github.com/aayushgupta/test_boot_hateoas\nURL to access the metrics\nhttp://localhost:8080/apidecorator/metrics\n. @joshiste Thanks a lot!!! It worked.\n. I am using a hostname in the actual configuration URL, I am surprised how it just disappeared while posting here... \nYes I have a setup where multiple admin clients are connected to a single admin server. I have been redeploying the application again and again, but I have restared the server as well.\n. My bad... its was the another instance of same application (with old configuration) running on different node, and had the wrong configuration (specifying the hostname name for other node).\nUsed tcpdump to get the IP of registeration request, cleanedup configuration and it worked. \nthanks a lot for your help!!!!\nI know its bad at my part, but won't it be useful to show the IP address of the application on details page along with version and other details...\n.

In the sample project I provided I am using @EnableDiscoveryClient on the resource server.  I just tried it using the Spring Boot Admin Client (and @EnableEurekaClient) instead, and it works.  So I guess the problem is somewhere with the 'discovery client'.\n. Hi,\nOK I've tried both the approaches mentioned by @joshiste  and @steve-oakey, and neither of them work.  Let me know if I'm doing something wrong.\n- if I set eureka.instance.hostname to anything other than the valid hostname of the machine the service is running on, then the URLs for the endpoints will be wrong and nothing will work.  E.g. if you set the second instance to localhost2, then the health URL will be http://localhost2:9000/admin/health, which is obviously invalid.  I guess we could put some alias in the DNS but that is going too far.\n- the metadataMap option doesn't work.  I already have a unique eureka.instance.instanceId  using ${spring.application.name}:${spring.application.instance_id:${random.value}}.  If i put that into eureka.instance.metadataMap.instanceId as well (or just on its own), it makes no difference.  Also, I'm using random ports (server.port: 0), so using ${server.port} to make it unique doesn't work because it shows up as port 0 in Eureka.\n@steve-oakey do you use random ports for your services?  It seems like you got it to work but I'm not sure how - can you share your configuration (or at least the relevant parts)?\nIncidentally, I think the key problem in com.netflix.discovery.shared.Application caused a similar problem that my colleague found using Turbine, which is why I started looking into this in the first place...\nThanks,\n. apologies to @steve-oakey - using eureka.instance.metadataMap.instanceId DOES work (when I use a random value as part of the instanceId).

The spring framework is designed to be easily extensible and so should be the actuator UI. Otherwise what happens is people extend the spring-boot actuators, add some new actuators, and then they can't extend the UI. A few more thoughts on this one - why not take out all CSS files in another jar called spring-boot-admin-theme-default and so if user wants to have their own theme, they simply include their own webjar, instead of the default theme jar.\n- +1 for angular-translate. Looks like the way to go.\n- The way I see the authentication thing is the following - 1) there must be a login screen 2) there must be a stub that returns always a hard-coded token. 3) The user can specify a property to change the URL of the stub and return real (expiring) tokens. Whether it will be implemented with Oauth or not is details.\n. ",

    "itsPoo": "Hi @joshiste, @RobWin,\nI have implemented Spring boot Admin client & server in my project and its successfully registering-an-application on the Spring boot Admin UI.\nWe are using PCF env for production/QA. Whenever application is deployed from PCF blue region to PCF green region it does not show the updates on the Spring boot Admin UI and we end up restaging all our applications on the production during deployment time. We would not want to do this activity.  I understand Spring Boot application auto-registers when the applicationContext is started and ready and this does not happen for PCF Blue to PCF Green deployments.\nI read this thread where its discussed above approach. Based on the change of the environment it will be register task again. Will this work for my problem? \nThanks for helping.\nPoonam.. Thank you so much for responding. Please find my answers in italics below.\nOverall I didn't yet understand your exact problem so here are some questions:\n\nI have implemented Spring boot Admin client & server in my project and its successfully registering-an-application on the Spring boot Admin UI.\n\nWhich version are you using? \n(Spring-boot-admin-server - version 1.5.1) (Spring-boot-admin-client - version 1.5.7)\n\nWhenever application is deployed from PCF blue region to PCF green region it does not show the updates on the Spring boot Admin UI\n\nDo you miss the new version information or do you miss entire services? In green region I miss seeing entire services\nDo the instances from blue and green register at the same spring boot admin instance? We have Jenkins pipeline which first deploys in blue region and then to green region for any environment. When blue pipeline step is completed, it registers on admin server and it shows the new version and also number of instances correctly. When the pipeline moves from blue to green region, it stops the blue services (which is correct) but it does not show the green services at all. Then we end up restaging our applications in Green region just to get them registered in spring boot admin server application\nOr do you use different admin servers for each region? Each region (dev/qa/prod) has its own Spring-boot-admin-server application deployed.\n\nI understand Spring Boot application auto-registers when the applicationContext is started and ready and this does not happen for PCF Blue to PCF Green deployments.\n\nIn fact (if you use spring-boot-admin-client) the application uses a scheduled task and registers over and over again. Then why my client is not registering over and over again? What am I missing?. I did set the de.codecentric.boot.admin.client.registration.ApplicationRegistrator to Debug and I see everytime the instance routes from blue to green, it does keep registering with [registrationTask1] [de.codecentric.boot.admin.client.registration.ApplicationRegistrator] - Application refreshed itself as 4b287e58\nI was trying the approach to invoke a rest service after each Blue/Green deployment which would invoke RegistrationApplicationListener.startRegisterTask(). Will this work? \nI cannot update Spring boot Admin to 2.X as it would require all my applications also to be upgraded to Spring boot 2.X. I also read (http://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/current/#monitoring-spring-boot-1.5.x) does it mean only Spring boot Admin should be upgraded to 2.X and Client can stay on 1.5.X?\n. When the registering task is running, starting it has no effect. Did you cross check that the services are registering using the correct spring.boot.admin.url?\nBoth my Blue & Green instances should register to the same spring.boot.admin.url as the code package is same and its declared once only.\nFuther more to this: When blue registers it shows Application refreshed itself as 232a8ac2 (my app instance id) - which is correct and it shows on my admin UI also.\nThen when Blue -> Green deployment happens I see in logs Updated app with guid 6d685f0e-6041-424d-bb77-8f7ead050a9e ({\"name\"=>\"billing-dev\"}) and Application refreshed itself as 232a8ac2 (my app instance id).\nThis is correct, as the when blue -> green deployment happens, the same instance becomes green. So the instance id should remain same.\nLooks like the problem is with my Admin server, its not showing the instance registered rather than shows it offline.  Which admin server logs can be enabled to see if Admin server is picking up or not?\nI really appreciate your help on this.\nThanks,\nPoonam.\n. Yes, the name in Blue is billing-dev-candidate and the name in Green is billing-dev. (It removes -candidate from any application name from Blue->Green deployment)\nWhen PCF deploys from Blue to Green, it updates the route and the name of the application. \nInstance remains same, it will not be restarted and there would be zero impact to live traffic.\nCurrently we are restaging each application after blue->green deployments, just for Spring-boot-Admin to show the green instances registered. Thats why I want to find out if its possible not to restage applications after blue->green deployment coz its like an add on chore for us.. The sba-client needs to be aware of the new name (by reconfiguring spring.boot.admin.client.instance.name). How can this be done? Is application restart/restage the only option?\nDo you reconfigure the application at runtime? Yes we reconfigure application at runtime, updating the app route and name of the application.\nAre you using the Spring Cloud's @RefreshScope? What should I do @RefreshScope?\n. ",

",
    "tjuchniewicz": "Snapshot works fine for me.\nWhen can we expect release of 1.3.3? Brixton.RELEASE is available now.\n. I've been searching 1.3.2 docs... Sorry.\n. I'm using 1.3.3-SNAPSHOT. \nI will try to make sample but it will take some time...\n. I'm using discovery support.\n. My debug result:\n``` java\npublic class EurekaServiceInstanceConverter implements ServiceInstanceConverter {\nprivate Application EurekaServiceInstanceConverter.convert(InstanceInfo instanceInfo) {\n      String mgmtUrl = instanceInfo.getHomePageUrl(); // mgmtUrl = http://localhost:8080/management\n...\n```\ninstanceInfo is read from Eureka?\n. I confirm that this is Eureka problem. I sniffed communication between Boot Admin and Eureka and Eureka returns wrong information. \nThis happens after restart of Boot Admin. It looks like Eureka returns corrupted, old values for instance which was shut down earlier.\n. But what about second problem.\nIt not always happens... Sometime good port is used but spring-boot-admin is trying to use it before fully started? This is maybe because of following scenario: \n1. Eureka starts\n2. Spring Boot Admin Server registers itself in Eureka. \n3. Admin stops\n4. Admin starts again\n5. Admin gets application list from Eureka and Eureka returns information about old Admin instance.\n6. Admin try to connect to this old instance but it fails and logs error message about problem with connection. Maybe because Admin is not fully started yet. Trying to deal with app but not listening on tcp port yet?\n. No. This is a second problem I described above. I should have described it in separate issue.\nContinued in: #201 \n. Any easy way to reconfigure Spring Boot Admin 1.3.3?\n. This fix does not work for me.\nI use this workaround:\n``` java\n@EnableAdminServer\n@EnableTurbine\n@Slf4j\npublic class AdminServerApplication implements ApplicationListener {\n ...\n\n@Autowired\nApplicationContext applicationContext;\n\n@Autowired\nAdminServerProperties adminServerProperties;\n\n@Autowired\nprivate ApplicationStore applicationStore;\n\n@Primary\n@Bean\n@ConditionalOnMissingBean\npublic StatusUpdater statusUpdater() {\n\n    log.info(\"Registering patched version of de.codecentric.boot.admin.registry.StatusUpdates\");\n\n    RestTemplate template = new RestTemplate();\n    template.getMessageConverters().add(new MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter());\n    template.setErrorHandler(new DefaultResponseErrorHandler() {\n        @Override\n        protected boolean hasError(HttpStatus statusCode) {\n            return false;\n        }\n    });\n    StatusUpdater statusUpdater = new PatchedStatusUpdater(template, applicationStore);\n    statusUpdater.setStatusLifetime(adminServerProperties.getMonitor().getStatusLifetime());\n\n    return statusUpdater;\n}\n\n@Override\npublic void onApplicationEvent(ContextRefreshedEvent  event) {\n\n    PatchedStatusUpdater statusUpdater = (PatchedStatusUpdater) applicationContext.getBean(\"statusUpdater\");\n    statusUpdater.setActive(true);\n}\n\n}\n@Slf4j\npublic class PatchedStatusUpdater extends StatusUpdater {\nprivate boolean active = false;\n\npublic PatchedStatusUpdater(RestTemplate restTemplate, ApplicationStore store) {\n    super(restTemplate, store);\n}\n\n@Override\npublic void updateStatus(Application application) {\n\n    if (active) {\n        super.updateStatus(application);\n    } else {\n        log.info(\"Application not started yet.

I have the same issue and feeling that it worked. How to debug this? What should be displayed here?\n. > The metrics tab only shows metrics with the gauge. or counter. prefix.\nThanks for explanation. This is my case. Are there any plans to make it more general view? I have my own metrics. Is there possibility to show them?\n. @joshiste thanks for explanation. Seems reasonable. Maybe other, not known metrics could be just listed in table?\n. Tail would be great. We don't use Log at all because we have very large log files difficult to view through the browser.\n. You are right. This is probably because @EnableHystrixDashboard or @EnableTurbine we use in our SBA. \nSorry for the inconvenience! Closing.\n. I use SBA 1.3.6 with Brixton.SR4. \nFor Brixton.RELEASE use SBA 1.3.3.\nSee https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/de/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/1.3.3/spring-boot-admin-1.3.3.pom\n. I can't make SBA 1.4.0 work with Brixton.SR4. I'm experiencing class not\nfound issues. But I use non default pom hierarchy.\nOn Aug 17, 2016 21:37, \"Duparc Loic\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nIs SBA 1.4.1 support spring boot 1.3.5 with Brixton.SR4 or is only for\nSpring boot 1.4.X ?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/issues/249#issuecomment-240522912,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AOtqRvYb1EvF4Wk2n-j87QeYjWJ2M1iyks5qg2L5gaJpZM4JmrHK\n.\n. Will 1.3.7 be published in Maven Central? How can I use this version?\n. I have the same issue using 1.5.4. Security is disabled. Tabs are hided quickly. \nFor example Details tab is visible under url: /applications/6db88706/details\nTab Metrics is not visible, but when I use this url manually: /applications/6db88706/metrics SBA shows valid content! Looks like UI only issue.\n\nIn browser console I see:\nHEAD .../api/applications/6db88706/metrics 405 (Method Not Allowed)\nFor me issue appears only for Spring Boot 1.3.8 apps. When monitored application uses Spring Boot 1.5 it works fine.\nSpring Boot 1.3 does not support HEAD. Any workaround?\n. This is not so easy in our environment to change microservice code. Too many services, too many teams. \nFor me best solution would be to fix it in single place (SBA). Any tips where to change SBA source to show all tabs by default without changing availability?  I will fork then.. To SBA... Now I get it. I will try. Thanks!. This custom filter works for me:\n```java\n/*\n * Fix for https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/issues/527.\n * Based on {@link FormBodyWrapperFilter}.\n * \n /\n@Slf4j\npublic class SpringBoot13SupportFilter extends ZuulFilter {\nprivate Field requestField;\nprivate Field servletRequestField;\n\npublic SpringBoot13SupportFilter() {\n    this.requestField = ReflectionUtils.findField(HttpServletRequestWrapper.class, \"req\", HttpServletRequest.class);\n    this.servletRequestField =\n            ReflectionUtils.findField(ServletRequestWrapper.class, \"request\", ServletRequest.class);\n    Assert.notNull(this.requestField, \"HttpServletRequestWrapper.req field not found\");\n    Assert.notNull(this.servletRequestField, \"ServletRequestWrapper.request field not found\");\n    this.requestField.setAccessible(true);\n    this.servletRequestField.setAccessible(true);\n}\n\n@Override\npublic String filterType() {\n    return \"pre\";\n}\n\n@Override\npublic int filterOrder() {\n    return 1;\n}\n\n@Override\npublic boolean shouldFilter() {\n    return true;\n}\n\n@Override\npublic Object run() {\n    RequestContext ctx = RequestContext.getCurrentContext();\n    HttpServletRequest request = ctx.getRequest();\n\n    log.debug(\"Filtering {} request to {}\", request.getMethod(), request.getRequestURL());\n\n    if (request.getRequestURL().toString().contains(\"spring-boot-admin/api/applications\")\n            && request.getMethod().equals(\"HEAD\")) {\n        HeadToGetMethodRequestWrapper wrapper = null;\n        if (request instanceof HttpServletRequestWrapper) {\n            HttpServletRequest wrapped = (HttpServletRequest) ReflectionUtils.getField(this.requestField, request);\n            wrapper = new HeadToGetMethodRequestWrapper(wrapped);\n            ReflectionUtils.setField(this.requestField, request, wrapper);\n            if (request instanceof ServletRequestWrapper) {\n                ReflectionUtils.setField(this.servletRequestField, request, wrapper);\n            }\n        } else {\n            wrapper = new HeadToGetMethodRequestWrapper(request);\n            ctx.setRequest(wrapper);\n        }\n    }\n\n    return null;\n}\n\nprivate class HeadToGetMethodRequestWrapper extends HttpServletRequestWrapper {\n\n    private HttpServletRequest request;\n\n    HeadToGetMethodRequestWrapper(HttpServletRequest request) {\n        super(request);\n        this.request = request;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public HttpServletRequest getRequest() {\n        return this.request;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getMethod() {\n        return \"GET\";\n    }\n}\n\n}\n. Yes i saw that properties. I'm using following configuration:yml\nspring:\n  boot:\n    admin:\n      turbine:\n        clusters: default\n        location: admin-server\n``\nand looks like SBA tries to use this url:http://localhost/spring-boot-admin/api/turbine/stream?cluster=default. But valid url for me ishttp://localhost/turbine.stream?cluster=default`.. This may be also fixed by https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/issues/212 after we can customize navbar text.. When I go directly to my service e.g:  http://localhost:8181/management/hystrix.stream it works fine.. We are also using in SBA Hystrix dashboard in standalone configuration (spring-cloud-netflix-hystrix-dashboard) and in this case it works fine but communication goes through ProxyStreamServlet  e.g. http://localhost:8080/proxy.stream?origin=http://localhost:8080/turbine.stream.\nLooks like spring-cloud-netflix-hystrix-dashboard provides workaround for SSE?\njava\n/**\n * Proxy an EventStream request (data.stream via proxy.stream) since EventStream does\n * not yet support CORS (https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=61862) so that a UI\n * can request a stream from a different server.\n */\npublic static class ProxyStreamServlet extends HttpServlet {}.

Thankyou so much :)\n. Thankyou so much @joshiste ! :) \n. well, that true @joshiste . Ihave some boot application in the same VM. I'll fix it. :)\nBut I still don't understand, cause if i change the dependencies version of spring boot admin server ui in 1.3.2 release, it's have no error (except the logfile button). but when I use the 1.3.3-snapshot builds by my self, i got that error. \noh, stupid me. so, I dont need to make snapshot-build by my self? then how to use that  tag? should I add it into my pom? \n. okay, thankyou @joshiste , I'll fix the rest. really appreciate your help and your fast responses. \n.

I tried adding a META-INF/spring-boot-admin-server-ui/css/main.css as follows, but that did not work (my logo is too large and exceeds the default 160px width):\na.spring-boot-logo span {\n    width: 300px !important;\n}. Well, I also tried renaming the file to core.css, but still nothing is overridden. The logo width attribute remains the same.\nOr if I move it to /META-INF/spring-boot-admin-server-ui/core.css, then the whole css file is replaced which leads to a completely destroyed ui. That's of course not what I want, I just want to override that single attribute.... Ok, this might come with developoment of spring-metrics?\nhttps://github.com/spring-projects/spring-metrics. That's true, but it's the same with server.contextPath. This also has to be set even though not read by the tomcat server.\nSo currently I'm setting server.port in application.properties to the same port that tomcat is run in production. Even though the property is not read by the tomcat server, it can still be read by SBA.\nBut Maybe it would be even better to introduce a new property that only sets the host for SBA, like spring.boot.admin.host=http://localhost:8080/, and the context path is always derived dynamically from ServletContext bean. Instead of having to harccode the full url.. Great improvement, works as expected!. Thanks for the detailed insight. Maybe this should be added to the docs, as a showcase how to chain the Notifier?\n. Hm that's not quite what I was looking for. I don't want to call a Rest path explicit before deployment to add a temporary filter. I want to set a global period (eg 60s) in which status changes are ignored.. Coming back to this, it would be sufficient if the /health polling interval could be configured. As a result any changes in the application state would automatically be delayed.\nOr is there maybe already a property for it? At which time interval is the health point called by default, and where does this value come from?. What exactly is the difference to spring.boot.admin.monitor.status-lifetime? The docs state something about /health endpoint, so maybe those two properties could be combined?. I see, so if I set period=60000, and status-lifetime=10000. If the app registers between 51-60sec of the period, then it will be ignored. Right?. I tried adding the spel as you suggested, but it seems to be invalid:\norg.springframework.expression.spel.SpelEvaluationException: EL1001E: Type conversion problem, cannot convert from java.util.Collections$UnmodifiableMap<java.lang.String, java.io.Serializable> to java.lang.String\nUnfortunately this is also not documented. Maybe the docs could be improved?. So and how could I achieve that in plain SpEL? As my goal was just include the health details plain in the mail.... Adding #{to.details.toString()} to the mail text message leads to the following content when status changes:\nFrom OFFLINE/DOWN to UP: the details are printed as expected.\nBut from UP to OFFLINE gives following error in notification:\n```\nstatus changed from UP to OFFLINE\n{exception=org.springframework.web.client.RestClientException, message=Could not extract response: no suitable HttpMessageConverter found for response type [interface java.util.Map] and content type [text/html;charset=utf-8]}\n```\nCould this be prevented somehow to send an exception as notification?\n. Some for me. This is critical, because usually one would deploy the admin ui to a tomcat webserver, where the servlet path is derived from the application filename.\nSo if you deploy a my-admin.war file, the location will be http://yourserver:8080/my-admin.\nIf only run locally with embedded tomcat, this can be simulated with setting server.servlet.context-path=/my-admin. Note that any server.* settings only apply to embedded tomcat!\nIn this case, as others mentioned already, spring-admin will still try to resolve the assets from localhost:8080/assets/... even if server.servlet.context-path is set!. I can confirm the 2.1.0 client works with 2.0.4 server. thanks!. Sorry, but your link is for an embedded tomcat webserver (\"78. Embedded Web Servers\"). Therefor any  server.* properties affect the application only in embedded mode.\n(or course I tried setting those properties anyway, but as expected that did not change anything).\nBut as said, I'm running the war file on a normal dedicated tomcat webserver! Therefore I set the reverse proxy configurations as stated above (eg X-Forwarded-Proto).\nAnd also, it worked in all the previous versions. So I assume this is probably a bug due to some changes since spring-boot 2.1.x?. I could solve it adding the following to server.xml before AccessLogValve:\n<Valve className=\"org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteIpValve\" remoteIpHeader=\"X-Forwarded-For\"  protocolHeader=\"X-Forwarded-Proto\" />. Of course my users will hit those stale connections as well.\nAnyways, if spring-boot users rely on both the spring-hikari and the spring-sba configuration, they might be confused as me that the application shows offline, even though it is working fine in general.\nOffline state is eg if the *.war application is undeployed in tomcat and thus physically removed. Then SBA usually shows the OFFLINE state. I think, as you suggested, that should be the only case when offline is to be shown. So TIMEOUT could be a nice improvement.. That's true indeed. Thanks for the discussion though!. ",

Spring Boot version 1.3.5\n. The latest (1.3.4).  The weird part is that the thread dump shows just fine when invoked on the admin app itself (the self-registering instance), but others (discovered via consul) do return the json back (posted above), but client-side angular code is throwing an error.\n. Hm, I'll investigate that... The issue could be that for our rest services we have to use the all lower case underscore format, so not sure if that can be changed.  I'll try the dedicated converter route, as you suggest.  Thanks!\n. I've noticed the same behavior.  The browser/chrome notifications do the same thing also. Would you mind Shari f your implementation of SlackNotifier?\n. It would be great if you could share a branch.  I'm working on an update of a Spring Boot Cookbook, where I've provided examples of how to integrate SBA, to SB 2.0, and would love to be able to test the integration and hopefully provide some feedback.. Looking at the code I'm not even seeing where this property is being consumed or bounded to a Properties object.... As we switched to k8s, we now use Spring Cloud Kubernetes discovery component, so it solved the problem by relying on k8s to only expose the actually running pods all the time.\nWe've also added a custom implementation of InstanceDiscoveryListener, which overrides discover method and does some cleanup of stale services:\nprotected void discover() {\n        final Set<String> staleApplicationIds = getServices();\n        for (String serviceId : discoveryClient.getServices()) {\n                    for (ServiceInstance instance : discoveryClient.getInstances(serviceId)) {\n                        Mono<InstanceId> applicationId = registerInstance(instance);\n                        staleApplicationIds.remove(applicationId.block().getValue());\n                    }\n        }\n        for (String staleApplicationId : staleApplicationIds) {\n            LOGGER.info(\"Application ({}) missing in DiscoveryClient services \",\n                    staleApplicationId);\n            registry.deregister(InstanceId.of(staleApplicationId));\n        }\n    }. Oh, nice, looks like it was added in 2.0.

I've squashed it into one commit. The only issue I still have is the return value of register. If you are registering against multiple and some fail, should it still be false or should it be true?

This isn\u2019t necessarily a barrier to using Eureka, but if you\nuse the router (recommended, or even mandatory depending on the way your\nplatform was set up), you need to explicitly set the hostname and port\nnumbers (secure or non-secure) so that they use the router.

    "mweirauch": "Thanks for the quick fix! I'll give it a try tomorrow.\nRegarding eureka and sba-client: There might be apps which are not providing any services discoverable via eureka. But from your question it sounds as if it's best practice to register anything with eureka no matter if there are consumers of the service and having sba query eureka for the available apps/services?\n. It's clearly stating that it can't allocate direct memory buffers: OutOfDirectMemoryError: failed to allocate 256 byte(s) of direct memory (used: 10485655, max: 10485760)] with root cause\nIIRC the Pivotal Java Buildpacks now explicitely limit all native memory \"pools\" if possible. What you are looking for is -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize set in the JAVA_OPTS. (Perhaps indirectly from the Buildpack.) You'd might wan't to increase that. But you should monitor this closely (e.g. with Micrometer) in case this is allocating more and more direct memory buffers then re-using. The Hotspot JVM also has a habbit of caching once allocated buffers for re-use. Tunable with -Djdk.nio.maxCachedBufferSize if I remeber correctly.. @joshiste No, direct memory buffer allocation is not part of the heap managed (in the sense of garbage collected) pools (Eden, Old, Metaspace, Compressed Class Space, ...). It's memory directly allocated by the JVM from the host OS. In a sense it's still managed due to being limitable by -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize and pools are reused (-Djdk.nio.MaxCachedBufferSize) for the JVM not having to re-allocate memory.\nI'd have assumed this is a application specific thing and unrelated to SBA. One should monitor the metrics and see if its a steady growth or actually triggered by some specific action within the application. E.g. monitoring the direct memory buffer metrics with and without SBA polling for information on the application itself.

On further investigation, the project in question actually refuse to read the spring.application.name property no matter where it is defined. I'll have to investigate further. Sorry for wasting your time!\n. For anyone interested: It was Swagger that caused the problem, more specifically the annotation @EnableSwagger2 from SpringFox. When I remove the annotation, the client registers using the correct name. I'm not sure what the actual culprit was, but it does register a PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer bean, which I suspect might be a possible cause.\nEdit: Should this be considered a problem with Spring Boot Admin or SpringFox?\n. https://github.com/springfox/springfox/issues/1514\n.

    "rfelgent": "I think the fluent api pattern is not well implemented in RestTemplateBuilder, as always a new instance is returned instead of \"this\" (the current one).\nFor a fast solution, the SBAP should adopt to the this...\n. Hi @joshiste ,\nthx for the fast response. I am using SBAP 1.4.1\n. Ok, i will try 1.4.2. Sorry for the duplicate. Isn't it a good idea to update the documentation then?\n. Hi @joshiste,\nI neither see errors nor warning in the SBAP log.\nI do see an info in the client who registers at SBAP (see my first comment!). As far as I understand the log message, the client registers with status \"statusInfo={status=OFFLINE, timestamp=1475682434470}}\". That sounds strange...\nFurthermore, I can access the endpoint information though SBAP without problems. It just the offline status SBAP's gui and the availabilty of the detail view at the same time that irritates me.\nIf I shout down the client, the SBAP gui hides the detail view correctly.\n. I do not use spring cloud. Is the StatusUpdater running on SBAP or the client?\n. Hi @joshiste ,\nthe error still exists. I attached the SBAP sample project\nsbap.zip\nwhen building the project, you must replace \"@@\" placeholder\n. Hi @joshiste \nthx for your fast responses! I appreciate your help!\nThe troubles the last days I had with SBAP was due to protected actuator endpoints. My team decided to protect all actuator endpoints except /actuator/info because of the loadbalancer.\nLooking back, I had to make following steps to make the things work again:\n1) SBAP/SERVER: Extending the com.netflix.zuul.Zuulfilter like described in https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshiste/spring-boot-admin-samples/master/basic-auth/admin-server/src/main/java/com/github/joshiste/spring/boot/admin/samples/admin/BasicAuthFilter.java\n2) CLIENTS: a required Update from 1.4.1 to 1.4.2, so the client registration uses http auth (buggy RestTemplateBuilder-pattern in Spring and see  #292 or #247 )\n3) SPAB/SERVER: creating the Bean StatusUpdater with required http basic auth credentials. (As far as I understand, SBAP pulls heartbeats from the clients from /actuator/health endpoint. I assumed earlier, that the clients push periodically the heartbeat to SBAP)\nI think it would be nice to add a chapter in the reference documentation like \"how to configure SBAP & Clients with protected actuator endpoints\". This could save time for other developers. (I can offer my help doing this)\nFurthermore, I was not aware the existence of the LoggingNotifier. Thx for the tip (or pls update the reference documentation ;-) )\n. Hi @joshiste ,\nI tried to register my bean of ApplicationRegistrator in an earlier attempt.\nWhen I looked into the code, I found it not the right way to go, as there is too much config logic and dependencies to other beans. That in turn would force me to duplicate (internal) code.\njava\n`      /**\n     * Task that registers the application at the spring-boot-admin application.\n     */\n    @Bean\n    @ConditionalOnMissingBean\n    public ApplicationRegistrator registrator() {\n        RestTemplateBuilder builder = restTemplBuilder\n                .messageConverters(new MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter())\n                .requestFactory(SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory.class);\n        if (admin.getUsername() != null) {\n            builder = builder.basicAuthorization(admin.getUsername(), admin.getPassword());\n        }\n        return new ApplicationRegistrator(builder.build(), admin, client);\n    }`\nI will try to make a PR :)\n. I try my best to resolve the conflicts ;-)\nPls have a look at my FIXME and TODO hint.\n. I am using version 1.4.2. here you go:\n```\n2017-02-07 17:22:55.934 ERROR 24889 --- [http-nio-10000-exec-5] o.a.c.c.C.[.[.[/].[dispatcherServlet]    : Servlet.service() for servlet [dispatcherServlet] in context with path [] threw exception [Request processing failed; nested exception is java.lang.NullPointerException] with root cause\njava.lang.NullPointerException: null\n    at de.codecentric.boot.admin.notify.filter.FilteringNotifier.notify(FilteringNotifier.java:52)\n    at de.codecentric.boot.admin.notify.RemindingNotifier.notify(RemindingNotifier.java:44)\n    at de.codecentric.boot.admin.notify.NotifierListener.onClientApplicationEvent(NotifierListener.java:16)\n    at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\n    at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:62)\n    at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\n    at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:497)\n    at org.springframework.context.event.ApplicationListenerMethodAdapter.doInvoke(ApplicationListenerMethodAdapter.java:253)\n    at org.springframework.context.event.ApplicationListenerMethodAdapter.processEvent(ApplicationListenerMethodAdapter.java:174)\n    at org.springframework.context.event.ApplicationListenerMethodAdapter.onApplicationEvent(ApplicationListenerMethodAdapter.java:137)\n    at org.springframework.context.event.SimpleApplicationEventMulticaster.invokeListener(SimpleApplicationEventMulticaster.java:166)\n    at org.springframework.context.event.SimpleApplicationEventMulticaster.multicastEvent(SimpleApplicationEventMulticaster.java:138)\n    at org.springframework.context.support.AbstractApplicationContext.publishEvent(AbstractApplicationContext.java:382)\n    at org.springframework.context.support.AbstractApplicationContext.publishEvent(AbstractApplicationContext.java:349)\n    at de.codecentric.boot.admin.registry.ApplicationRegistry.register(ApplicationRegistry.java:82)\n    at de.codecentric.boot.admin.registry.web.RegistryController.register(RegistryController.java:57)\n    at de.codecentric.boot.admin.registry.web.RegistryController$$FastClassBySpringCGLIB$$2753636d.invoke()\n    at org.springframework.cglib.proxy.MethodProxy.invoke(MethodProxy.java:204)\n    at org.springframework.aop.framework.CglibAopProxy$CglibMethodInvocation.invokeJoinp\n```\n.

You probably use another (older) spring boot version than Spring Boot Admin (SBA)?\nSBA uses 1.5.6.RELEASE, which contains\n<httpcore.version>4.4.6</httpcore.version>. Not sure how best to display this...\n. I would prefer another default, but this should maintain the existing behaviour.... ",

From admin server, hystrix dashboard works fine.

(It seems not reachable as the issue shows, don't know why.)\n\n\n\nAdmin server port is 8700\n\nConsumer server port is 8090\nTurbine server port is 8989\nAdmin config about turbine is: \"spring.boot.admin.turbine.url\": \"http://localhost:8989/turbine.stream\"\nVersion of dependencies of admin-server, admin-server-ui, admin-server-ui-turbine is the same: 1.4.5\n\nAnything I did wrong please let me know, and I would be really happy to test further..

As such we have no good way of managing SSL certificates required for using SBA with https. All our other applications communicate with each other over HTTP and we would have hoped to do the same with SBA. Is there any way to get SBA to act like its using https in the hrefs we have configured via \"admin.ui.public-url\".. I was facing a similar problem, i solved it by setting the spring.boot.admin.ui.public-url property.\nFor example if Zuul is localhost:80/admin and the spring boot admin server is localhost:8080 setting spring.boot.admin.ui.public-url: http://localhost:80/admin/ will change the href in <base> to localhost:80/admin.

I changed metadata to computed. Also, rebase the upstream/master to the modified branch.\nThank you for your support.\nI will paste screenshot after the changes.\nPC View\n\nSmartphone View\n\n. Followed \"2.1. Setting up Spring Boot Admin Server\" in the following page.\nhttp://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/current/. Sorry if it'd not related but are you trying to override the default auto configuration? If so you need to have spring.factories file under resources/META-INF. I think it is required to force the customized auto configuration.\nAlso, you need to set the customized autoconfiguration inside like below. \norg.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration={customized autoconfiguration}. Got it! I will come back with the change. . @joshiste @shakuzen \n  I will create the new class as mentioned by @joshiste which can be used for hybrid environments. So whoever want to use the hybrid environment can specify it by overriding the AutoConfiguration. Also, I will use app_guid + \":\" + index as unique id of cf instances. Also docs and tests.\n  CF instances have VCAP_APPLICATION environment variable which can be used to detect that it is running on CF. And if VCAP_APPLICATION exists, it will set the metadata automatically. But then, I feel it would be more consistent if the spring-boot-admin-server can instantiate with the hybrid version from the start. \n  Do you know if there is a method to instantiate with the hybrid one on runtime when detecting there is access from CF?. Thanks, I think we can also use @ConditionalOnCloudPlatform(CloudPlatform.CLOUD_FOUNDRY) to detect whether running on CF in the spring-boot-admin-client. \nBut what I meant was for spring-boot-admin-server where by default it will  instantiate with BasicAuthHttpHeaderProvider and HashingInstanceUrlIdGenerator which does not support CF. I was wondering whether we can re-instantiate with the CloudFoundryInstanceIdGenerator and CloudFoundryHttpHeaderProvider once detecting there is instances running on CF. \nI am talking based on the current plan of creating a new class for the hybrid version.. I will once implement with using hybrid version with the condition of @ConditionalOnCloudPlatform(CloudPlatform.CLOUD_FOUNDRY) for spring-boot-admin-server and spring-boot-admin-client.. I add hybrid version class for spring-boot-amin-server in the following branch firstly. \nhttps://github.com/tetsushiawano/spring-boot-admin/tree/feature/support_cf_v2?files=1 \nBut I am not sure how to conditionally replace the autoconfiguration. Do I need to create a new autoconfiguration class for the hybrid version or can I modify the existing autoconfiguration class. \nI would like someone's advice. . Thanks! I will revise it tomorrow. . I am the midst of revising but let me post the progress.\nhttps://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/compare/master...tetsushiawano:feature/support_cf_v2\nI am trying to figure out why AdminServerCloudFoundryAutoConfiguration is not run before AdminServerAutoConfiguration. Even though, I put @AutoConfigureBefore({AdminServerAutoConfiguration.class})\nI upload the latest change to CloudFoundry but it only shows 1 instance (actually there is 2 instance running) because AdminServerCloudFoundryAutoConfiguration is not run before AdminServerAutoConfiguration. \nUploaded to CloudFoundry\nI will continue tomorrow.. it's not run at all and I didn't set in spring.factories. Thank you for mentioning it! Will revise it today. . @joshiste , Thanks! Now spring-boot-admin-server is working. \nhttp://spring-boot-admin.cfapps.io/#/applications\nI will next proceed implementation of spring-boot-admin-client.. hmm... read spring-boot-admin-client but struggling to decide how to fix it. I will consider MetadataContributor tomorrow.. sorry... let me once give up on modifying spring-boot-admin-client for automatically adding the following 3 lines while running on CF. I could not think of a good solution to automate this part.\nhttps://github.com/tetsushiawano/spring-boot-admin-client-app/blob/master/src/main/resources/application.yml#L5-L7\nSo I will proceed to documentation, and submit PR..

We also did a similar fix first. our method was replacing the core code by creating a customized autoconfiguration. \nI think supporting cloudfoundry out of the box would be beneficial for many people so let me proceed it although struggling at the moment with the client side implementation. \nAlso, It would be great if someone could help me with the client side implementation. I'm normally coding Ruby and don't have much experience with Springboot. :). I see. Is there reference document somewhere related to the MetadataContributor concept? . Thank you! I will revise the code today!. @joshiste I looked at the master branch but couldn't find MetadataContributer. Am I looking at the wrong location? https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/commits/master. Thanks!. I was able to append metadata automatically by running on CF.\nhttp://spring-boot-admin.cfapps.io/#/applications\nAlthough, I find 2 problems.\n(1) metadata.auto-deregistration's value can only be set as String type (needs to be boolean) so it does not work when shutting down 1 CF instance. (still remain to be registered with health status is down.)\n(2) I still need to keep service-base-url in application.yml as follows. I could not think of good way to override InstanceProperties as modifying DefaultApplicationFactory as it seemed like a dirty fix.\nhttps://github.com/tetsushiawano/spring-boot-admin-client-app/blob/master/src/main/resources/application.yml#L8\n@joshiste \nregarding (1), To solve the issue, What do you think of the idea to change metadata type from Map<String, String> to Map<String, Object>? \nregarding (2), Do you have good idea how to set different service-base-url for CF case? \nTo solve (1) and (2),\nI thought maybe it would be better to use PostProcesserEnvironment instead of MetadataContributor because I can specify properties regarding of the data and its types. I will once try it out tomorrow.\nThank you for support!\nref\nhttps://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/compare/codecentric:master...tetsushiawano:feature/support_cf_v2?expand=1. Got it about metadata data type. \nI come to realize yesterday that some properties does not have any effect being on metadata. \nYes, If possible I want to set spring.boot.admin.client.server-base-url because CF requires a specific baseUrl to access to the specific CF instance. \nAlso, spring.boot.admin.auto-deregistration would better be registered as true because CF is not a permanent environment. Instance can be created and destroyed and would result in showing down status for some of the instances. \nI can also set the above 2 properties in each application as well but then spring-boot-admin would not work out of the box. Maybe, let that be and write in the documentation that the 2 properties should be set in each application. . Sorry for taking a long time. \nI finally managed to set the 4 properties automatically in spring-boot-admin-client and confirmed that all of them is working.\n4 properties.\nhttps://github.com/tetsushiawano/spring-boot-admin-client-app/blob/master/src/main/resources/application.yml#L6-L9\nBelow is the demo url.\nhttp://spring-boot-admin.cfapps.io/#/applications\nBelow is the modified branch.\nhttps://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/compare/master...tetsushiawano:feature/support_cf_v2?expand=1\nAlthough, 3 tests have error after this fix. I will investigate the cause and fix it tomorrow.\nAlso, I will add test codes for this modification tomorrow.\n```\n[INFO] -------------------------------------------------------\n[INFO]  T E S T S\n[INFO] -------------------------------------------------------\n[INFO] Running de.codecentric.boot.admin.client.ClientReactiveApplicationTest\n[ERROR] Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 2, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 9.677 s <<< FAILURE!

I fixed all points except for what should be the default value ofauto-deregistration`.\nI would like your feedback, thanks!. @joshiste Yes, I'm done with my changes. It's ready into look changes deeply.\nThank you very much. \n. @shakuzen thanks for checking. I will fix that part today!\nAlso, I confirmed that @joshiste added the auto-deregistration to true for CF environment with this commit. So I will remove the duplication logic today. Also, I will pull the latest master to this modification branch as well.. @joshiste Thank you very much!. maybe not related with memory leak but similar case happened. \nwhen running spring-boot-admin-server on a small spec CF (1g memory) instance, after a few days the  UI can not show the health status of each instance. Currently, changed to middle spec CF (4g memory) instance and checking if the situation will be resolved.. happened again.\n\n. I check error log. it was same OutOfDirectMemoryError. This error does not show regularly but when I open the instance page the following error is output to log.\n16:12:48.026: [APP/PROC/WEB.0]  at

Thank you for much for checking. If its application specific issue I will try to find the cause of it today.\nAlso I will provide a sample project today. Thank you for your support!. This issue was solved but updating the version of our organization parent pom. So let me close this issue once.. can I try to solve this?. @joshiste thanks for advice. yes, let me sketch a probable solution first and move to discussion afterwards. I think I can sketch the solution by April 8th (Sunday).. @joshiste\nSorry, I was busy and did not do it. I have time next week so let me look into it and try to have a proposal within a week. . @joshiste \nSorry, I was busy with other things and could not cope it.\nLet me get out of this ticket so someone else can solve it. \nDeeply sorry for delaying the resolution of this ticket.. Thanks! I will check this point today!. I checked the program today but I don't have enough knowledge to understand the lifecycle of the application context. @joshiste , can you give me advice where I should start looking? I asked some people and it seems application context is not created by spring-boot-admin-client but rather in the spring-boot application itself.. do you mean an api which return routes information? \nlet me check it tomorrow and write what i find out.. I find cloud foundry api which return all routes of the application.\nhttps://apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/1.37.0/apps/list_all_routes_for_the_app.html\nAlso, I checked the environment variable of cf instance. \nhttps://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html\nIt have cf_api which is the base endpoint of the cf api. \nSo maybe it is possible to call the cf api from the cf instance.\n\nUsing the cf api might be 1 solution.\nBut I also think there is a risk of cf instance making too many request to cf api. \nSo if possible if we can refresh the bean \"CloudFoundryApplicationProperties\" it will be much better.\n. yes, i plan to do it. . I change to computed with the following commit. e248feded985de1fdc000c9866890d54c4bea340. Thank you for your comment.\nWhat do you think with the name springBootAdminClientCloudFoundryProperties?. Thanks for pointing it out.\nYes, I think it will cause exception of invalid url in the spring-boot-admin-client when ${vcap.application.uris[0] is null. I will add condition to only add when accessible http route exist.. I understand what you mean. We used instanceId to keep consistency with DiscoveryClient but actually CF instance already have a instanceId which have a diffferent value. And what we use for instanceId is actually the instanceIndex.\nHow about applying instanceIndex here and ask DiscoveryClient-side to change it to instanceIndex in the future?. I think auto-deregistration should be not active by default. Because, for application running on permanent environment such as IaaS or real servers we would not be able to confirm servers which is DOWN (as they will be de-registered). \nCases we have is, \nOS will be rebooted for some reason and the application would not startup. I think it would be useful to show the list of DOWN servers in SBA.\n@shakuzen whats do you think?. serviceBaseUrl here is for only passing the applicationId and instanceId when serviceBaseUrl is present. \nAs you've mentioned, let me remove the 3 redundant local variables and remove StringUtils.hasText(serviceBaseUrl)) from the if condition as it would be ok to add instanceId and applicationId even when no Url is present.. @joshiste what do you think about this? \ninstanceId in DiscoveryClient is not really the instanceId but instanceIndex. We think we should use instanceIndex here and ask DiscoveryClient-side to rename to instanceIndex in future.. Got it! I will fix it!. I will remove it!. Yes, I will try to fix this by the end of Saturday. Thank you for pointing out. . I will try it today.. It worked without @Primary. But I will add it today as there is 2 InstanceGenerator bean.. I will check it today and remove it.. I agree that the current method is not intuitive.\nBut, I created CloudFoundryInstanceProperties so I can use the ${vcap.application.uris[0]:} variable. Firstly I tried to use EnvironmentPostProcessor but it can't resolve this variable.. Thanks, I will try it out today!. ",

    "cabbonizio": "Hey we started seeing this bug also once we upgraded to 1.5.0. Sure will check it out in further detail tomorrow.   Thanks for reopening.  I checked the console and didn't see an errors if I remember correctly.  It seems like the search is taking more things into account but no longer matching on application name like it used to.   I believe we were on version 1.4.6 prior to upgrading to 1.5.0.  . hey @joshiste as promised I am back with hopefully more detail.  I added a screenshot of my Chrome browser (with console window opened) and I have typed some text into the filter textbox.  In this case I typed \"authentication\" and have an application with that name but it never filtered down the list.  One thing that is interesting is all of the applications registered in Eureka as their /health endpoint, which leads to my next question on how \"deep\" are you filtering?   Meaning....which data are you filtering upon?  Are you using the /health results by any chance to match on what is typed in the text box?   I was assuming the match was only on what was on the opening screen columns (application name, version, info, etc.).   It doesn't look like there's any errors in the console but more of the functionality with the filtering itself.\nMany thanks!\n\n. Thanks that is helpful and now I can see what is happened and I think it's related to what I was saying earlier.  It looks like each service that is registered in Eureka is reporting back ALL of the applications registered in Eureka in the /health endpoint.  Therefore, when I search for something like \"authentication\", every application is matching so your functionality is working as you specified.   I will have to get to know how to control what's produced in the automatic health check for the Eureka discovery client, looks like it reports back all of the services.   Have you seen this behavior with Eureka, curious?  If this is standard behavior with Eureka then I assume others would find the search not very useful.   I certainly don't want to address Eureka concerns here, but wondering if it would be better not to full-text search and maybe limit the search to what is exposed in the screen such as just the name, version, info columns.

    "ctoestreich": "Perhaps the metrics should be a sorted set instead of a List. @joshiste Adding all metrics would be easier.  I think the code to filter gauge and counters is already overkill just to accommodate different gauges.  I don't know what the intent of rich gauges was (as I don't see anything \"rich\" in my UIs), but if we made all metrics just simple bars it would at least cover the use case that we need.  My change has the advantage of allowing clients to dictate which metrics they want to see in the admin.  We have other services that consume all of these metrics and I we emit hundreds of metrics per service.  Rendering a contextual subset is probably suitable to our case, but showing all metrics would encapsulate this as well.  \nYour comment has two different suggestions of work.  Show all metrics OR change custom metric set to metadata property.  I am happy to augment to fit one of those, but lets decide which one first and then I will make the change.. Okay i will clean this up and do all metrics grouped by the prefix.  Are we okay to simplify the gauges or do you want to keep those regex tests around and the \"rich gauge\" feature?  What exactly are the rich gauges supposed to be?. I went back to this recently and there are a few issues with adding \"all metrics\".\nFirst issue is that grouping and ordering of the metrics requires iterating the metrics more than once and the best grouping that can be implied is just grabbing the first word before the first period.  So that custom metrics like \"web.access.controller.action.count\", \"web.access.rate\" and \"web.errors.count\" would all get grouped together.  This isn't inherently a \"problem\" it just makes the page render slower due to having to \"prebucket\" and sort and buckets some different metrics together.  This can also throw off what the \"max\" value for a set is given that you now could be mixing jvm.memory and jvm.threads together for example.  \nThe other major issue is how to deal with timers by using the gauge style display.  For example we have the following metrics:\n\"web.access.controller.IndexController.action.index.fifteenMinuteRate\": 0.0043852199194119295,\n\"web.access.controller.IndexController.action.index.oneMinuteRate\": 0.03198334378909226\nThis doesn't quite fit into the gauge/bar graph that is currently used.\nI am open to thoughts on this.\n. @joshiste After spending a few hours working on this the simplicity of just specifying the interested metrics was pretty nice from a coding and display perspective.  To just boot a microservice below are the number of metrics that are created.  After it gets running there are may more given all the http interceptor, amqp and other custom metrics that start getting counted.  Not to mention our primary monolith has about 2k controller/action that log access rates, counts etc.\nSo for me to say show: \"jvm.memory, web.access, threads\" limits this scope to the SBA screen to stuff we want to see at a glance which the bulk of these are emitted to our metrics aggregation platform. \n```json\n{\n\"mem\": 292877,\n\"mem.free\": 46604,\n\"processors\": 4,\n\"instance.uptime\":

    "evernat": "@joshiste \n\nSo will you rework the code for 2.x?\n\nDo you mean rework the PR (as a new PR certainly) to work with spring-boot-admin 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT?\nIf yes, can you help us by saying what files in the PR are not good anymore and if possible how those files should be changed? And is there an example similar to this PR or should the (new) PR be the new example of such integration?. @joshiste I agree for the module in version 2.0.0 as an external module, if the module is migrated one day.\nBut @dvtoever is the main concerned by this PR and maybe also by the module migration and by #683 whatever it means, so I suggest to have his voice on this PR.. Instead of javamelody-core dependency and of javaMelody FilterRegistrationBean (which is not enough anyway), I suggest to show an example to add javamelody-spring-boot-starter in pom.xml. For example:\nxml\n<!-- https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/wiki/SpringBootStarter -->\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>net.bull.javamelody</groupId>\n    <artifactId>javamelody-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>\n    <version>${javamelody.version}</version>\n</dependency>. ehcache dependency is not needed here anymore: it can be removed.\nAnd I suggest to add the iText 2.1.7 dependency (licence MPL or LGPL at your choice) and the Log4J dependency, in order to have PDF links in reports (I think PDF links are important in the reports) and to have some logs:\nxml\n        <dependency>\n            <groupId>com.lowagie</groupId>\n            <artifactId>itext</artifactId>\n            <version>2.1.7</version>\n            <exclusions>\n                <exclusion>\n                    <groupId>bouncycastle</groupId>\n                    <artifactId>bcmail-jdk14</artifactId>\n                </exclusion>\n                <exclusion>\n                    <groupId>bouncycastle</groupId>\n                    <artifactId>bcprov-jdk14</artifactId>\n                </exclusion>\n                <exclusion>\n                    <artifactId>bctsp-jdk14</artifactId>\n                    <groupId>bouncycastle</groupId>\n                </exclusion>\n            </exclusions>\n        </dependency>\n        <dependency>\n            <groupId>log4j</groupId>\n            <artifactId>log4j</artifactId>\n            <version>1.2.17</version>\n</dependency>\nYou could also copy the collector server log4j.xml file in resources of this module.\nAnd XStream 1.4.10 dependency and aws-java-sdk-cloudwatch dependency could possibly be added to be able to export data as JSON or XML and to export data to AWS CloudWatch, but they are less important and I suppose that they could be added by the \"admin\" user.. This filterRegistrationBean() is not needed to make the collector server work and it should be removed I suppose. (There is a CollectorServlet below.)\nOr if what you want is to monitor the spring-boot-admin server itself, then it is not enough (javamelody-spring-boot-starter may be better for this).. Parameters.addCollectorApplication(applicationName, Parameters.parseUrl(application.getServiceUrl())); to be replaced by CollectorServlet.addCollectorApplication(applicationName, application.getServiceUrl())\n(using the latest javamelody-core snapshot). to be replaced by CollectorServlet.removeCollectorApplication(applicationName);. <javamelody.version>1.69.0</javamelody.version> can now be used to use the new methods in CollectorServlet. The FilterRegistrationBean is not enough because in general a SessionListener is also installed. See https://github.com/javamelody/javamelody/blob/master/javamelody-spring-boot-starter/src/main/java/net/bull/javamelody/JavaMelodyAutoConfiguration.java#L87\nThen the spring-boot-starter also adds monitoring of RestControllers, RestTemplates, Services, spring context and more.\nSo adding the javamelody-spring-boot-starter to monitor the spring-boot-admin server should be much simpler than adding filter, sessionlistener, etc.. No, I think that many users would be really happy to have the pdf reports. And, adding a iText dependency would be debatable in a monitored app but this dependency (with exclusions on transitive dependencies) is in my opinion not a problem in spring-boot-admin. So I think that we should really keep the iText dependency like it is now.\nFor Log4J, it is not included at the moment and finally it seems not needed since there is already a log4j-over-slf4j dependency in spring-boot-admin..

A GET request to http://domain/springbootadmin/api/applications returns a JSON, including:\n\"statusInfo\":{\"status\":\"OFFLINE\",\"timestamp\":1514464505597,\"details\":{\"exception\":\"org.springframework.web.client.RestClientException\",\"message\":\"Could not extract response: no suitable HttpMessageConverter found for response type [interface java.util.Map] and content type [application/octet-stream]\"}},\"source\":\"http-api\"\nThe Content-Type of the response to a GET request to http://domain/someapp/health is application/vnd.spring-boot.actuator.v1+json;charset=UTF-8.

I think the log lines showed are way more than I typically need to check. I just thought it would be a useful configuration to have.. Thanks @joshiste for the suggestion. Since I am not familiarized with SBA source code, that may be a time consuming task I can not afford right now. I came up with the idea of intercepting SBA logout request and redirect it to my custom path:\njava\n@PostMapping(\"${spring.boot.admin.context-path}/logout\")\npublic ModelAndView logout(HttpServletRequest request){\n    request.setAttribute(View.RESPONSE_STATUS_ATTRIBUTE, HttpStatus.TEMPORARY_REDIRECT);\n    return new ModelAndView(\"redirect:/logout\");\n}\nwhich seems to work..

Let me know if you need a screen shot and you cant reproduce this.. I support this feature request. It would be lovely to be able to list all REST-apis that Spring Boot Application exposes. For instance by having one specific Swagger UI-tab. URL to the swagger.json file could be configured with specific property, and if it is not set, you dont show that tab.. No, not according to Spring Boot Actuator Endpoint reference guide. However, it is still possible to create custom Actuator endpoint for Swagger, that is exposed on the management port.\nBasically when requesting /management/swagger you will get JSON response with URL to the swagger.json file, which Spring Boot Admin application renders by embedding Swagger UI on some way. I have not thought much on the last part, but Swagger UI is HTML/CSS/JS (React).. Yes, I see your point. What would be nice is an easy way to extend the core of SBA, such as new tab with custom content, but still be able to upgrade to latest version of SBA. The case is that SBA covers already many of the monitoring scenarios and it is nice way of getting the big picture into one place. So that is the reason why it would be nice to include swagger into the same portal.\nAnother input on the API-visibility would be to have an tab for Actuator endpoint mappings: Displays a collated list of all @RequestMapping paths.

    "snicoll": "\nIsn't that (according to @snicoll) to be avoided?\n\nCorrect.\nThe main issue I have here is that the BOM isn't used by the build at all, so I am with @joshiste there. Perhaps there is no need for such a change. In Spring Boot, we  do things a little bit differently.\nThe root pom is just used for the reactor, all modules inherit from spring-boot-build which itself inherits from spring-boot-dependencies so rather than moving the code you could move your \"main\" pom as sba-build (for instance), inherit  from  sba-dependencies, and have your modules inherit from sba-build. That way, you actually use the dependencyManagement section of the bom.\nLet me know if you have any question.. A bom shouldn't have a dependencies section. Also, ideally the project should use said BOM internally rather than having it as a side artifact. spring-boot-admin  brings full dependency management for a particular version of Spring Boot. This BOM should only provide dependency management for the modules that this project handles (as you've indicated in the content  below).. We use explicit versions in a bom usually.. I am not sure all that is needed. Probably worth adding plugin management only for the things this project actually uses.. ",

I tried to add the loggers endpoint to application.properties file, it didn't work:\nsh\nspring.boot.admin.routes.endpoints: env,metrics,dump,jolokia,info,configprops,trace,refresh,flyway,liquibase,heapdump,activiti,loggers. It appears the above exception has nothing to do with DOWN status.  First of all, I found that the exception was caused by this line in security config:\nsh\n.formLogin().loginPage(\"/login\").defaultSuccessUrl(\"/index\").permitAll().and()\nIf I comment out above line, no exception.  However in SBA, the application still appears DOWN.\nSo how to fix the exception? (of course I need form login, so I have to have that line).\nAlso, why it shows DOWN even my application is running?\nthanks. Thanks.  In deed I blocked /health in security... but after I enabled it, I got 404... and I have compile group: 'org.springframework.boot', name: 'spring-boot-starter-actuator', version:'1.5.14.RELEASE' in my build.gradle...\nother links like metrics doesn't exist also...\nwhat could be wrong?. @joshiste thanks, so I know why... I set it to a different port and context-root... so I can access from browser (of these endpoints) no issues.  Since I am not using standard context root or port, so I added this (management-url):\nsh\nspring:\n    boot:\n        admin:\n            url: http://localhost:8100\n            client:\n                management-url: http://localhost:8081/admin\nBut it still shows DOWN.\nwhat I do now?. I was using console logging, after I switched to file, still no log tab, or no buttons to download or view log...\nthis is my log config\n```sh\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n\n\n\n\n[%-5level] %d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%t] %c{1} - %msg%n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<Loggers>\n    <logger name=\"org.springframework\" level=\"info\" additivity=\"false\">\n      <AppenderRef ref=\"App-File-Appender\" />\n    </logger>\n    <logger name=\"org.hibernate\" level=\"info\" additivity=\"false\">\n      <AppenderRef ref=\"App-File-Appender\" />\n    </logger>\n\n    <Root level=\"info\">\n        <AppenderRef ref=\"App-File-Appender\"/>\n    </Root>\n</Loggers>\n\n\n`\nI checkedd:/temp/my`` has the log file.\n. @joshiste thanks.  It is working now.  I had to specify logging.file in my config.  logging.path doesn't work.\nAs you can see I have a logging.config, which points to a log4j2.xml file, and inside it, I use a roller appender.  Is there way to let SBA show these old logs as downloadable file?  (in my logging config, I set the max size of the log is 10M, so if it reaches this size, it will rename to ,log and then create a new log file.  So I would like to download these .log from SBA.

Meaning that the status won't be updated which we also see because the timestamps weren't getting updated. It seemed like the convertStatusInfo method wasn't returning anything (I'm not familiar with the reactive stuff yet so don't know if this could be normal).\n. The body we returned when calling health was empty or null. If I changed the code in the convertStatusInfo method  to this: \njava\n            return response.bodyToMono(RESPONSE_TYPE).map(body -> {\n                if (body.get(\"status\") instanceof String) {\n                    return StatusInfo.from(body);\n                }\n                return getStatusInfoFromStatus(response, body);\n            }).switchIfEmpty(Mono.just(this.getStatusInfoFromStatus(response, emptyMap())));\nusing the switchIfEmpty it did go red. The only thing that still baffles me is how our case is different from your test cases in the StatusUpdaterTest... I'd love to get a red test in there so we can validate it with tests.. No problem, yeah I saw the issue myself (of the tests that didn't break) too earlier today, was planning on making a PR for the fix. But since you've already fixed it, thanks for the quick resolution and pointing me to the correct logging classes!. You need to add the following repository in your pom:\n<repositories>\n        <repository>\n            <id>sonatype-nexus-snapshots</id>\n            <name>Sonatype Nexus Snapshots</name>\n            <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>\n            <snapshots>\n                <enabled>true</enabled>\n            </snapshots>\n        </repository>\n    </repositories>. I'm not sure if this would work in our case, with the SImpleDiscoveryClient, where there is no external DiscoveryClient and the configuration is in spring-boot-admin-server itself (we're only using the server not the client).  Hence we can't just add random metadata on every restart? I might be missing something though.. Just making sure that I understand some of the inner workings, the information you see on the detail page that's information that spring-boot-admin-server retrieves \"live\" from the instance by passing the request through to the instance using an InstancesProxyController. While the information shown on the Application list or the Wallboard are cached inside spring-boot-admin-server (which gets collected by the triggering of domain events), so the problem we're facing here is that existing cache invalidation doesn't work with the static config?. Do you have any idea on a possible workaround I could temporarily implement in our spring-boot-admin server?. That's what I've been trying to do, but I'm having issues finding a correct \"entry-point\" to accomplish this. I've tried some and it never seemed to reach the eventual doUpdateInfo in InfoUpdater\nI also tried to replicate the behaviour of the regular StatusUpdateTrigger in my own InfoUpdateTrigger to make it have an update interval too but that doesn't seem to do anything either. \n``` java\npackage com.ownapp;\nimport java.time.Duration;\nimport java.time.Instant;\nimport java.util.HashMap;\nimport java.util.Map;\nimport java.util.logging.Level;\nimport org.reactivestreams.Publisher;\nimport org.slf4j.Logger;\nimport org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;\nimport org.springframework.stereotype.Component;\nimport de.codecentric.boot.admin.server.domain.events.InstanceEndpointsDetectedEvent;\nimport de.codecentric.boot.admin.server.domain.events.InstanceEvent;\nimport de.codecentric.boot.admin.server.domain.events.InstanceRegistrationUpdatedEvent;\nimport de.codecentric.boot.admin.server.domain.events.InstanceStatusChangedEvent;\nimport de.codecentric.boot.admin.server.domain.values.InstanceId;\nimport de.codecentric.boot.admin.server.services.InfoUpdateTrigger;\nimport de.codecentric.boot.admin.server.services.InfoUpdater;\nimport reactor.core.Disposable;\nimport reactor.core.publisher.Flux;\nimport reactor.core.publisher.Mono;\nimport reactor.core.scheduler.Schedulers;\nimport reactor.retry.Retry;\npublic class OwnInfoUpdateTrigger extends InfoUpdateTrigger {\n    private Duration updateInterval = Duration.ofSeconds(10);\n    private Duration statusLifetime = Duration.ofSeconds(20);\n    private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(OwnInfoUpdateTrigger.class);\n    private Disposable intervalSubscription;\n    private Map lastQueried = new HashMap<>();\n    private InfoUpdater infoUpdater;\npublic OwnInfoUpdateTrigger(final InfoUpdater infoUpdater, final Publisher<InstanceEvent> publisher) {\n    super(infoUpdater, publisher);\n    this.infoUpdater = infoUpdater;\n}\n\n@Override\npublic void start() {\n    super.start();\n    intervalSubscription = Flux.interval(updateInterval)\n            .doOnSubscribe(subscription -> log.debug(\"Scheduled info update every {}\", updateInterval))\n            .log(log.getName(), Level.FINEST)\n            .subscribeOn(Schedulers.newSingle(\"info-monitor\"))\n            .flatMap((i) -> this.updateInfoForAllInstances())\n            .retryWhen(Retry.any()\n                    .retryMax(Integer.MAX_VALUE)\n                    .doOnRetry(ctx -> log.error(\"Resubscribing after uncaught error\", ctx.exception())))\n            .subscribe();\n    log.debug(\"Started!\");\n}\n\n@Override\npublic void stop() {\n    super.stop();\n    if (intervalSubscription != null) {\n        intervalSubscription.dispose();\n    }\n}\n\n@Override\nprotected Publisher<?> handle(Flux<InstanceEvent> publisher) {\n    log.debug(\"handling publisher\");\n    return publisher.subscribeOn(Schedulers.newSingle(\"info-updater\"))\n            .filter(event -> event instanceof InstanceEndpointsDetectedEvent\n                    || event instanceof InstanceStatusChangedEvent\n                    || event instanceof InstanceRegistrationUpdatedEvent)\n            .flatMap(this::updateInfo);\n}\n\nprotected Mono<Void> updateInfo(InstanceEvent event) {\n    return updateInfo(event.getInstance());\n}\n\nMono<Void> updateInfoForAllInstances() {\n    log.debug(\"Updating info for all instances\");\n    Instant expiryInstant = Instant.now()\n            .minus(statusLifetime);\n    return Flux.fromIterable(lastQueried.entrySet())\n            .filter(e -> e.getValue()\n                    .isBefore(expiryInstant))\n            .map(Map.Entry::getKey)\n            .flatMap(this::updateInfo)\n            .then();\n}\n\nMono<Void> updateInfo(InstanceId instanceId) {\n    log.debug(\"Updating info for instance\");\n    return infoUpdater.updateInfo(instanceId)\n            .doFinally(s -> lastQueried.put(instanceId, Instant.now()));\n}\n\n}\n```\nIf you could point me in any general direction where I could launch an event or something to trigger an update.

    "alexanderehi": "Did this issue ever get figured out? I am on Spring boot 2.1.1, Spring boot Admin 2.1.1, but I am using the simple client registration. the client registers fine and all of the actuator endpoints are accessible. But the SBA only shows health nothing else. In the SBA console output, I am getting the same connection aborted error you are, over and over again. If you found one, what was the solution?. thanks for the feedback. In my security config i opened the actuator path with \"/actuator/**\". If I browse to \"localhost:8080/actuator\" I get a list of all of the actuator endpoints. I can also click the button to achieve the same from the spring boot admin ui.. I just meant that I can click that middle button from the ui to see the list of available actuator endpoints.\n\n. I would share the project, however it is confidential to my organization. I apologize, hopefully we can narrow the problem down without a providing a full project.\nthe only errors I am getting on the SBA server is:\njava.io.IOException: An established connection was aborted by the software in your host machine\n and \n.w.s.m.s.DefaultHandlerExceptionResolver : Resolved [org.springframework.web.HttpMediaTypeNotAcceptableException: Could not find acceptable representation]\nOn the client side I get:\no.s.b.a.audit.listener.AuditListener     : AuditEvent [timestamp=2019-02-21T20:48:10.394Z, principal=anonymousUser, type=AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE, data={details=org.springframework.security.web.authentication.WebAuthenticationDetails@957e: RemoteIpAddress: 127.0.0.1; SessionId: null, type=org.springframework.security.access.AccessDeniedException, message=Access is denied}]\nI am not sure why the client is audit event is throwing access denied, as I do not have security set up on those endpoints right now.\n. The SBA and client are 2 separate app projects. I did not see any 406 status codes. And on the servers, there should not be any problem with the network, as before upgrading the SBA and client from 1.5.9 to 2.1.1, they communicated well. Right now I am just testing on localhost SBA port 8090 and client on 8080, which also worked just fine on the old version.. now it looks like the client is trying to register at the endpoint \"/instances\". So in my case right now http://localhost:8090/instances. is that correct for registration?\n. Have you came across anyone else having this issue where SBA only grabs the \"/actuator/health\", but does not hit any other actuator endpoints or display any other tabs other than health? It does not seem like the SBA is even attempting to grab any other data from the client. I really appreciate your help with this, it has been frustrating me for a while.. ",

Sorry guys, I wasn't able to provide sample quickly enough, but I will (if you still want it). \nMy project does NOT contain @EnableWebMvc. Only springboot annotations are: \n@Configuration\n@PropertySource(\"classpath:application.properties\")\n@EnableAdminServer\n@EnableWebSecurity\n@RestController\n@RequestMapping(\"/error\")\n@SpringBootApplication\nI WAS able to fix the issue by providing custom deserializer like:\n```\n@Bean\n    public ObjectMapper mapper() {\n        ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();\n    SimpleModule module = new SimpleModule();\n    module.addDeserializer(Registration.class, new JsonDeserializer<Registration>() {\n        @Override\n        public Registration deserialize(JsonParser jsonParser, DeserializationContext ctxt) throws IOException {\n            JsonNode node = jsonParser.getCodec().readTree(jsonParser);\n\n            return Registration.builder()\n                .name(node.get(\"name\").asText())\n                .managementUrl(node.get(\"managementUrl\").asText())\n                .healthUrl(node.get(\"healthUrl\").asText())\n                .serviceUrl(node.get(\"serviceUrl\").asText())\n                .metadata(calculateMetadataMap(node.get(\"metadata\")))\n                .build();\n        }\n\n        private Map<String, String> calculateMetadataMap(JsonNode metadataNode) {\n            Iterator<String> metadataFieldNamesIterator = metadataNode.fieldNames();\n            Stream<String> metadataFieldNamesStream = StreamSupport.stream(\n                Spliterators.spliteratorUnknownSize(metadataFieldNamesIterator, Spliterator.ORDERED), false);\n\n            return metadataFieldNamesStream.collect(Collectors.toMap(Function.identity(),\n                e -> metadataNode.get(e).asText()));\n        }\n    });\n    objectMapper.registerModule(module);\n\n    return objectMapper;\n}\n\n```\nbecause the issue actually is, that jackson cannot deserialize class, because there isn't any public on arg constructor. I don't believe there is any other way around it. It really seem as badly configured lombok (breaking changes in most recent version) or jackon.. I created stripped down version of admin, which worked just fine. So I retry with original version I had, reproduced the issue once more, and then never again. I have no idea what happened, seems to be OK, I have no idea what could cause that. I'll keep my eye on that, but just before you close this as invalid, can you please confirm, that jackson actually can cope with lombok builder/parameterized constructors? I will recheck that myself, but previously I did not find any trace of that mention. . ok, thanks.\nActually when I try to test it(just the deserialization), I'm still getting deserialization issues, but maybe it's just some configuration issue. I don't know. Anyways I don't see any @JsonCreator annotations generated or anything else which could help, so I really don't see a way how this could work. If you can share hint, it would be great. Lombok 1.18.2, jackson-databind 2.9.6\n```\n@Data\npublic class TestTO {\n    private final int a;\n    private final int b;\n@lombok.Builder(builderClassName = \"Builder\", toBuilder = true)\nprivate TestTO(int a, int b) {\n    this.a = a;\n    this.b = b;\n}\n\npublic static TestTO.Builder create(int a) {\n    return builder().a(a);\n}\n\n}\n```\n\n```\npublic class TestToTest {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();\n        TestTO testTO = TestTO.builder().a(1).build();\n    String json = objectMapper.writeValueAsString(testTO);\n    System.out.println(json);\n\n    TestTO deserialized = objectMapper.readValue(json, TestTO.class);\n    System.out.println(deserialized);\n}\n\n}\n```.

I know it isn't relevant here, but after configure ouath2 security on my spring admin, the admin server is not able to call it's /applications api and is getting 401.

Much thanks... @manish436 try below:\nmail:\n  template: classpath:mail-template.html\n  additional-properties:\n    environment: ${spring.profiles.active}. I did some investigation and found that the extra JSON element was added by our internal security library. I was able to get UI working by excluding calls from admin UI to admin server using below configuration:\n/**\n     * Ignoring all self-APIs/SBA server APIs which are called by SBA-UI internally.\n     */\n    @Override\n    public void configure(final WebSecurity web) throws Exception {\n        web.ignoring()\n           .antMatchers(HttpMethod.OPTIONS)\n           .antMatchers(HttpMethod.GET, \"/**/applications\", \"/**/applications/*\", \"/**/notifications/*\", \"/**/instances/**\");\n    }\nHowever, it would be good to call these endpoints securely too. I will raise a feature request for the same.. Sorry for not being clear with the description. I got the security thing figured out finally. As you see in the description, i had to disable security on some endpoints. But now security on all endpoints is enabled and i am able to access application UI perfectly. Below was the change (i had to add a filter) i made to the security config:\nhttp.addFilterAfter(new RequestContextFilter(), CsrfFilter.class)\nI am not expert in security or reactive WebClient, but my understanding is WebClient runs and makes request from a separate thread due to which i was getting Spring's No thread-bound request found exception (which was causing authorization to fail). Please correct me if i am wrong. I will close the issue anyways.. @joshiste Thanks for the answer, it worked like charm. And yes i would like to volunteer for PR on documentation. Please send me the details for the location of documentation files.. Hmm, I too am wondering the samw now.. actually I was working on a library where I needed some metadata which were not available from vcap and hence I needed the dynamic configuration. But thanks for simplifying that out, I will update the PR tonight.. Any updates on this issue? We too are facing similar problem. In our case, the ReadTimeOutException is resulting in SBA to consider the registered application is down and it triggers the notification. This is causing false positives. Any idea how to increase the read time out would be appreciated if the retry mechanism will be complex to implement. I am using SBA 2.0.1. Thanks.. looks like the issue was intermittent. closing the issue.. Yes i am on latest versions:\nspringBootVersion = '2.0.5.RELEASE'\nspringBootAdminVersion = '2.0.3'\nI am using Netty, will try using tomcat and reducing the memory to see if i can reproduce it.\nThanks for the suggestion, you can close this issue if it's not related to SBA.. Sorry I'm still in between other things so didn't get time to look into this, as I said you can close this, probably the issue is with netty. Ill try to switch to tomcat. Is any other configuration required to get SBA working with tomcat?\nFYI: we did not face this issue since I posted this, we however got same issue on other environment. So maybe I'll investigate it a bit further and reply if any possible solution I get. But for now you can close this issue. Thanks. @joshiste I was able to resolve the issue by upgrading libraries to below versions:\nspringBootVersion = '2.1.1.RELEASE'\n        springCloudVersion = 'Greenwich.RC2'\n        springBootAdminVersion = '2.1.1'\nLooks like the leak was in Spring WebClient https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-17473..

Metadata is a flat string -> string map so what actually would be added is tags.environment -> test.\nThat makes sense to me and it also fits well with Eureka or any other form of registering apps.\nI sent a PR that set the tags based on keys in the metadata that have the \"tags.\" prefix.\nThis is how it looks:\n\n. @joshiste, I updated the PR with above suggestions.\n. @joshiste, I added to requested description to the docs.. Hey @joshiste, you plan on merging this, or does it need extra work?. Hey @joshiste, thanks for merging. I see that this is part of the 2.2 release. I currently don't have a stable version for our internal solution with 2.2. I will try to get something this week, so I will be able to test it.. Going with this approach for all users will mean that all html calls will not be served if they fall under the context-path. As the default is /, it means:\n1. Actuator endpoints.\n2. /login\n3. Any other endpoints the user may wish to serve along side the admin server.\nWhile the first two could be explicitly allowed, the third may be an issue.. This is also not bullet proof, since the instances/applications ... endpoints which return json will still take precedence as all browsers send '*/*' in their accept headers.. Please checkout my latest commit for how to support this in MVC. For WebFlux, I don't have much experience with, I tried doing that with a WebFilter but I can't apply it to the AdminControllerHandlerMapping only.. Hey @joshiste, I updated the PR to resolve conflicts.\nDo you have any suggestion on how to handle this in WebFlux based apps?\nI can make this configurable so that only MVC apps will have the history mode on.. Hey @joshiste, did you get a chance to look over this PR?\nAs a middle ground, if you are not aware of any solution for the Reactive flavor, I can make this configurable with a property like: spring.boot.admin.ui.history-mode-for-mvc=true or some other property name.\n. FYI, I am seeing that same error.. I have my own registration based on Discovery. Its very similar to the existing InstanceDiscoveryListener only that I don't use the DiscoveryClient but rather make a call to Eureka endpoint directly and parse the data. The reason I am doing it is to support multiple region which the discovery client does not support.. Looks like this issue manifests when both InstanceDiscoveryListener and StatusUpdaterTrigger are in play.\nIf I disable the StatusUpdaterTrigger (just for debugging), I don't see that error anymore.\n. Hey @joshiste, I added the requested tests and narrowed the content type.. Hey @joshiste, was wondering if you got a chance to see my latests changes to this PR which addresses your comments.\nIt would be nice to have this merged before a new release, currently at Netflix we just use a fork which only has this change.. Hey @joshiste,\nI understand your concerns and appreciate your feedback.\nAs a middle ground, can we make the VueRouter mode configurable? this will allow me to add the Filters on my side without introducing this change to everyone?\nLet me know if thats acceptable and I will send a PR.. Cool. Thanks for the update.. The way I am authenticating against the services is using mutual auth. I am using a prebuilt SslContext that is dedicated to a specific host, as it also does hostname verification in a custom way. This requires me to change the HttpConnector per request. Without subclassing this, I am not able to mutate the underlying WebClient per request and attach the correct SslContext.. @joshiste, perhaps I didn't explain it correctly.\nIn the current design, there is a single InstanceWebClient bean that upon instantiation (after all customizations have taken place) is being used for making calls to management endpoints info/status/detection/... for all of the registered applications.\nIn my case I need different SslContext per application, but using the suggested builder will only give me a way to configure the WebClient once (at boot time).\nI am looking for a way (like I did in the 2.0.x releases) to change the client connector when the public WebClient instance(Instance instance) is being called.\nSomething like this:\n```\n    @Override\n    public WebClient instance(Instance instance) {\n        Assert.notNull(instance, \"must be valid instance to create a web client\");\n    WebClient webClient = super.instance(instance);\n    if (isSecure(instance)) {\n        ClientHttpConnector connector = clientConnectorPool.get(instance.getRegistration().getName());\n        webClient = webClient.mutate().clientConnector(connector).build();\n    }\n\n    return webClient;\n}\n\n```.

It actually looks much better. What I see is that for the most part, the wall manages to stay green for about half the time, and then intermittently a bunch of instances would go offline (about 20-40 of them) and then they come back again after a few minutes. But the strange thing is that when this happens, nothing in the server logs are shown. I tried to troubleshoot by opening the wall in Chrome n then opening the Chrome debugger and monitor network activity between browser and SBA when the instances go offline but I see no activity between browser and SBA when this happens (I have to click on something to see some network activity).

Hi, Johannes. Thanks a lot for your activity!\n\nIf I get your config right, you are using the \"standard\"-property server.servlet.context-path to set the path for your reactive handler in your custom code. So this is not standard spring boot behavior or is it?\n\nYou are right!  Unfortunately, I didn't find a proper standard way to configure a 'root contect path'  for reactive API in case of using MVC Controllers. The best I found (see my example with UndertowReactiveWebServerFactory  bean) helped me to solve my problem.... and I choose to use the standard property for the configuration.\n\nImho the solution proposed in #804 would be a much better fit for this problem.\n\nI can update my solution... actually - adding a new property under spring-admin namespace was my first idea, but I've chosen such way because it described In spring-boot-client documentation: http://codecentric.github.io/spring-boot-admin/2.0.3/#spring-boot-admin-client (see spring.boot.admin.client.instance.service-url property description).\nGuessed based on service-base-url and server.context-path.\nSo, I made my solution to meet the documentation. \nLet's discuss the best way and Ill implement it. \nI suggest: \n1. add the new property (from #804) -spring.boot.admin.client.instance.service-pathin y solution change using of theserver.servlet.context-pathto this new one (so - both reactive and servlet branches will have the same implementation)\n2. as  a default value for this new property - use the standardserver.servlet.context-path` - we'll save \"as-is\" the behavior for the non-reactive branch, and we'll provide the ability to configure it for the reactive branch as well.\nWhat do you think?\n.

    "klopfdreh": "Hi,\nwe also have this issue (SBAdmin 2.0.2). It is very hard to trace this down, but I tried it with the developer console of chrome. Here is a screenshot at which point the script stops:\n\nNote: We have other micro service registered on the same SBAdmin and the http trace for those are working fine. I think this issue occurs if there are a lot of http requests are coming in and the amount of data is to big.\nHope this helps.\n. @joshiste would you be so kind and have a look at this / reopen the ticket?. @joshiste I can't hand over the JSON, because it is client and user related.\nHowever I was able to access the JSON by calling:\nhttps://domain-name/sbadmin/instances/instanceid/actuator/httptrace.\nI just looked through the code and saw a change regarding the Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder.\n```java\n    @Bean\n    public Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder jacksonMapperBuilder() {\n        Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder builder = new Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder();\n    builder.deserializerByType(LocalDateTime.class, LocalDateTimeZoneIgnoringDeserializer.INSTANCE);\n    builder.featuresToDisable(DeserializationFeature.ADJUST_DATES_TO_CONTEXT_TIME_ZONE);\n\n    return builder;\n}\n\n```\nDoes this also affects the actuator endpoints or do they use a separate Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder bean?\nBeside this we don't change anything regarding the actuator configuration and other micro services are working.. Anything I can provide further on to move this ticket forward / get this issue fixed?. Do you know if this could lead to this issues? I don\u2019t know on how to setup a scenario to test this - are there any unit / frontend tests to check this is out?. Thanks! I am going to try it out and find the bug - meanwhile can we reopen the issue?. Hi @joshiste,\nI was able to debug the JS code from within chrome and the JSON and all data seems to be fine. I set a break point before the \"for\"-loop and was able to run through the first two chartData iterations where the buckets are pushed. When I release the break point the issue with the out-of-memory crash is occurring.\nSo my assumption is that this is simply an issue of too many traces for a specific time period which are causing an out-of-memory exception. I guess the markup is growing to much. (The one within the template)\nMy suggestion would be to introduce a limit for those traces which is configurable and use\njavascript\ntraces = myarray.slice(0,<limit>);\nto shrink down the array if it hits that limit.\nAlso I would suggest to not show all traces for the time period of viewing but recalculate the time period according to the amount of traces returned by the slice call.\nThis way the shown time would not increase infinite, but move based on the traces.\nHere is a screenshot of my first successful run through:\n\nTo my understanding this is a bug and I would like to reopen this ticket.. @joshiste - do you require some more feedback or is this something which helps out with this issue? (I am asking because of the label). @joshiste yes of course, but it is going to take some time until I can provide it because a lot of releases at work at the moment.\nSo one suggestion would be to make the limit field available within the same page of the httptrace - so that you can change the value on the fly - WDYT?. Oh it was rather easy to make those changes - do I have permisstion to create branches / perform a PR in this case?\nEdit: I am going to fork the repo and create a PR from my one.. Ok, I think the PR is ready for review, now.\nEdit: We can squash the commits later on and introduce it as a single commit.. For me it does but slows down because 1000 is a big value for this and of course a lot of markup.\nWhat do you think we should set as a default limit? 500?\nPlease also run it and see if there are any errors or I missed something (regarding filter / selection) - within this short time I couldn\u2018t test all functionalities working together without issues.. @super-ning - can you also test those changes and report if this is working for you?. I also saw that there is a logic according to concat traces - so my changes may initially work but lead to some errors if the next traces are retrieved with fetchHttptrace. Also it takes only the first 1000, but the order of the traces might be not correct, because they are sorted after the slice - also I guess we have to take the last 1000 not the first after the comparison right?\nhttps://github.com/klopfdreh/spring-boot-admin/blob/b69728e89f3d31e6c0477fa075493c4a8b16b3cd/spring-boot-admin-server-ui/src/main/frontend/views/instances/httptrace/index.vue#L200\nAlso if there are too many traces returned, this might lead to a gap - example:\n. Thanks a lot! \ud83d\udc4d \nI would suggest to do something like\ntraces.slice(traces.length-this.limit,traces.length) if traces.length is bigger than the limit after the sorting. Thanks a lot for your time! \ud83d\udc4d . Just want to link an already closed ticket, because I think it could belong to this one as well:\n1053. I had a closer look at this now and this seems to be a bit more complex.\nI just tried around a bit and when I set the div with the class \"card panel migration\" to overflow: auto and change the top:140px to top:0 of the header with the class \"card-header panel__header--sticky\" you can scroll the panel sidewise.\nBut I don't know were the sba-panel.vue component is used else and if this would not brake something else if the top attribute is changed.. I am going to change this to number. ",

Yes. problem solved :) It was sort of stupid issue, because I changed extension-resource-locations as stated in docs, so that extension was registered, but did not configure spring boot app to allow static resources from that folder. \u00a0I just did ResourceHandlerRegistry.addResourceLocations and problem solved.\nI found two more things that would be nice:\nAllow Vue DevTools -> they are disabled, because main Spring Boot Admin bundle was build with production profile, and one has to allow them before first Vue is mounted.\nSome way to import from Spring Boot Admin UI in my javascript - services and utils.

    "src-r-r": "Ah, I had assumed package-lock.json was something to protect concurrent execution (like a pid file). Just learned what it really is.. Right; sorry for the confusion. My build error occurred in a component using the library but it was my missing liblombok that was the issue.. I think only if you're using Eclipse. Even then Eclipse seemed to struggle finding the right libraries.. True; I didn't need to do this, but requirements are useful as a reminder.. Probably self-explanatory if you work on Java a lot of the time. IMHO, build docs should take the premise of \"if you're new to 90% of what's used in this project, this will get you going.\" Docs like these take up only a little space, but can save someone a lot of work..
