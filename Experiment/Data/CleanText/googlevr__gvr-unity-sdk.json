    "smdol": "W/dalvikvm( 9084): Unable to resolve superclass of Lcom/google/vrtoolkit/cardboard/proto/Phone$PhoneParams; (1646)\nW/dalvikvm( 9084): VFY: unable to resolve exception class 1645 (Lcom/google/protobuf/nano/InvalidProtocolBufferNanoException;)\nThese look like there was an error loading the protobuf jar.  Could you try this with the 0.4.1 release?\n. Each time this bug has been reproduced locally it turned out that the libprotobuf jar file was accidentally left out of the build.\n. Fixed in v0.4.1.  The CardboardGUI script was left active by default in 0.4.0, but it requires Unity Pro to wor, otherwise you get the above screenshot as a result.\n. The stereo cameras use the FOV returned from the underlying Android code, which is configured for a particular device by NFC tag or QR code, and otherwise falls back on the default configuration of the original Cardboard design.  In either case, the FOV is based on what you can actually see through the lenses of the Cardboard.\nThere is a control on the StereoController class called \"MatchMonoFOV\" that lets you affect the apparent FOV in stereo to match the mono (main) camera.  It needs a designated object to be specified in the \"CenterOfInterest\" field as well.  Then StereoController will adjust the eye position so that the COI object has the same size onscreen (in pixels) as it does in the main camera.\n. The alignment marker and settings button are currently only enabled when native distortion correction is active (they are drawn by the same call that does the correction, in fact).  Currently this only works in Unity Pro.  But it is a bug and should be made to work in Unity Free.\n. New release 0.4.9 is out.  It draws the alignment marker even if distortion correction is off, and also in the editor.\n. There are a couple of contributing factors to this issue:\n1. The Cardboard SDK is assuming a default device (the original cardboard viewer) with a particular lens configuration.  This is normally handled by the NFC tag in the Cardboard, or a QR code you can scan.\n2. The Unity plugin is rendering to the full screen even though the Cardboard SDK thinks the visible area is the size of a phone.  So the viewport being rendered to does not match the projection matrix being used.  This is an actual bug that needs to be fixed.\nThis doesn't happen in the editor since it calculates a projection matrix to match the viewport.\n. Fixed in v0.4.5\n. See also here, for a solution that backports Tooltip to earlier versions of Unity:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/27541593/google-cardboard-unity-sdk-import-error-for-android\n. The exception was thrown from some code that checks glError().  The actually error could actually have happened well before then.  1280 means GL_INVALID_ENUM, which if you are not calling some native rendering code, may mean you need to check the Open GL ES setting in Unity's Player Settings.  Try setting that to \"Force OpenGL ES 2\".\n. This could be a case where the code in the SDK is converting a \"warning\" situation (glError() != GL_NO_ERROR) into a \"fatal error\" (a runtime exception).  \nTo test this:\n1)  Do you see any similar issues for a Unity project with Cardboard not included?\n2)  You could also try disabling the distortion correction to see if the rest of the Cardboard SDK works.  To do that, edit Cardboard.cs and make the function canApplyDistortionCorrection() always return false.  That will cause the code that is throwing the exception here to be bypassed.\nIf you are able to run Unity (+ maybe Cardboard - distortion correction), then there is likely a bug in the SDK (treats glError too harshly).  If not, then the \"phone is too old\" explanation will look better.\n. The problem appears to be that something causes glError 1280 (GL_INVALID_ENUM), but the GL error state lurks innocently until the first time the distortion correction code is called (through GL.IssuePluginEvent() in Cardboard.cs), at which point it is converted into a java.lang.RuntimeException.  I can't tell if the origination point of the error is in the SDK or somewhere else in the Unity pipeline.\nThe most useful info would be an adb logcat snippet, assuming you can catch an occurrence in house.  Particularly, any warnings or errors about glError 1280 from prior to the fatal exception.  This might shed light on what exactly is causing the error condition.\nHere are the options I can think of at this time, until the SDK is fixed to not throw a fatal exception because of a prior GL error state:\n1)  Assuming the actual error cause can be determined, and that it is not also in the Cardboard SDK: make it not happen, or clear the glError state right away.  Seems iffy.\n2)  Edit Cardboard.cs and add a try/catch around the call to GL.IssuePluginEvent().  No idea if this will recover nicely on the next frame.\n3)  Turn off the distortion correction altogether by commenting out GL.IssuePluginEvent().  This could mess up the appearance of your screen.\nIn the meantime, the SDK team has been notified.\n. The new release (v0.4.5) should no longer have this problem.\n. New release 0.4.9 has drift correction enabled by default.\n. Should work in v0.4.5 now.\n. There is a possible answer here. \n    http://stackoverflow.com/a/27587358/4372377\n. Fixed in v0.4.5.\n. Two things to check:\n1)  In the Unity Player settings, make sure the Minimum API setting is not newer than your phone.\n2)  Do you have another model of phone you can try it on?\n. Verify-errors relating to CardboardDeviceParams appear to be caused by a missing libprotobuf jar file.  Make sure it is present in Assets/Plugins/Android and that it is included in the build.\n. Are you able to get into immersive mode with other apps?  If not, there is a possible fix here:\nhttp://appslova.com/how-to-enable-immersive-mode-on-android-without-root/\n. It looks like the HTC screenshot shows the top bar, so it did not go into immersive mode.  Also, I don't see the settings gear icon.  I know there is a bug in the Cardboard Unity plugin that affects how it interacts with Android -- the gyro and accelerometer are not accessible in Input -- and I wonder if this is also an effect of that bug.  If that is the problem, then when the bug is fixed, this problem will be fixed too.  One way to test this:  You mentioned other cardboard apps without unity3d.  What about other unity3d apps without the cardboard plugin?  If they can make the screen immersive mode, then it is likely to be that bug.  \nOne other thing to look for:  Does adb logcat show any error messages?\n. Based on your latest information, it looks like the HTC One X may be reporting an incorrect dpi.  I've heard of some other models that also have this problem.  The dpi is used to calculate the size of the screen in mm.  The SDK needs to know this in order to compute the correct projection matrix.  It doesn't seem to matter whether GetMetrics() is used, or GetRealMetrics() -- some phones return the wrong dpi for one of those calls or the other.  The result is the SDK thinks the screen is smaller than it is, and the smaller image is rendered like you see it:  centered horizontally and at the bottom edge of the phone.\n. I know that the underlying Java SDK switched from one of the two calls GetMetrics and GetRealMetrics at some point.  The hope was this would fix the dpi issue, but it was then found that it only made a different set of phones report a problem.  Likely he has an older version of the Cardboard SDK that uses the other metrics function from your version, and that one happens to give the correct answer on your phone!  :(\n. I guess the thread should be closed.  Regardless of how the issue is solved, it is not really a bug in the Cardboard-Unity SDK itself.\n. Yes, that is what you are supposed to do.  See the Cardboard Plugin Reference:\nCode Changes to Scripts using OnGUI()\n```\nvoid Start() {\n    CardboardGUI.onGUICallback += this.OnGUI;\n    // ...\n}\nvoid OnDestroy() {\n    CardboardGUI.onGUICallback -= this.OnGUI;\n    // ...\n}\nvoid OnGUI() {\n    if (!CardboardGUI.OKToDraw(this)) return;\n    // ...\n}\n```\nThe reason it can't be automatic is that CardboardGUI does not know if your object will be used across level loads.  See:\n    http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Object.DontDestroyOnLoad.html\n. I've seen some other people report this same rendering problem in other forums.  Since it is Unity Pro, the problem is likely due to a RenderTexture issue.  It could be the specific format used in the Cardboard SDK (RGB565) is not supported on this phone.\n. I was not able to reproduce this -- it imported fine and ran in Unity 5 for me.  Could you retry on an empty project?\n. The all black screen is caused by the CardboardGUI script, which is somehow\nnot compatible with Unity 5.  Disable the script and the scene should work.\nOn Mar 4, 2015 6:19 PM, \"Luis Pulido\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI could import perfect, with no errors, the demo scene works fine in the\neditor, everything seems to work ok, but, when I compile and run in the\ndevice, it doesn't work... it's all black (some times white when moving the\ndevice) so I think the head tracking is working but not rendering correctly.\nIs the plugin compatible with Unity5?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/googlesamples/cardboard-unity/issues/17#issuecomment-77293942\n.\n. More details about the Unity 5 compatibility issues have been found recently.  The release notes here have been updated:\n    https://developers.google.com/cardboard/unity/release-notes\nSee the \"Known Issues\" section under v0.4.5.\n\nThe latest info is that making any calls to GUI class methods (e.g. GUI.Button, etc) is what causes the black screen.  In the demo scene, removing CardboardGUI should disable all such calls, but in your own scene you might have some of these calls elsewhere in your code.\nThe build warnings and errors are from scripting changes in Unity 5.  The Cardboard scripts need to be updated to Unity 5 in order to fix those.  So far, I've been able to let the upgrade dialog do its thing without trouble.  \nThe SkyboxMesh (which gives the warning) is broken for a different reason:  Unity 5 skyboxes apparently no longer have 6 textures in them named _LeftTex, etc, so the script isn't finding them.  That has to be fixed too.\n. BTW, I've seen the white flash when looking where the GUI would normally be, but I've never seen the white radial gradient thing.  If you could capture that in a recording, post it here.\n. @darkesco @VanKurt @oatssss\nDo your scenes have any GUI calls (GUI.Button, etc) or skybox?  If so, can you disable or remove them and test to see if that makes things render better?  More data will be helpful in tracking this down!\n. Thanks @VanKurt for the test scene.  I think I have a workaround for the strange popping artifacts, although it also disables the barrel distortion and the UI stuff between the two images.\n1) On the Cardboard.SDK object, disable the following options:\n    Native Distortion Correction\n    Alignment Marker\n    Settings Button\n2) Edit Cardboard.cs, in function EndOfFrame, comment out the line:\n    GL.InvalidateState();\nYou may see some weird stuff around the edges of the phone and between the eyes.  That's because nothing in the SDK ever clears that area.  But these areas should not be visible when the phone is in a Cardboard.   The scene will look distorted in a Cardboard, just like it does in Unity 4 Free, because the distortion correction is turned off.  Hopefully this will still allow you to experiment while the real fix is being figured out.  \nNear as I can tell, any time the Cardboard SDK calls functions on the GL class in Unity 5, things can go weird like this.  The above workaround just bypasses all the GL calls currently in the SDK.  Unity has been told, awaiting response.\nPlease confirm if this helps or not!\n. Note on skyboxes:  Unity 5 now has 3 skybox shaders:  procedural, cubed, and 6-sided (the Unity 4 kind).  The SkyboxMesh script only works with 6-sided skyboxes, as of v0.4.5.\n. Another skybox + Unity 5 update:  I'm seeing that Unity 5's skybox shaders use the active projection matrix now during rendering.  That means they should correctly handle the parallax caused by Cardboard's off-center projection, which was the whole reason for adding the SkyboxMesh script in the first place.  \nI recommend ripping out SkyboxMesh script altogether, and trying the scene without it.  Make sure the sky seems very distant (farther than anything else in the scene) when viewed in stereo.\n(I have to check lens flares to see if they are similarly treated.  If so, the StereoLensFlare is not needed anymore either.)\n. @darkesco  Add an extra Camera to the scene.  Set its properties like so:\nclear flags = Solid Color\nbackground = Black (or whatever)\nculling mask = Nothing\ndepth = -100\nSee if that takes care of the glop around the two eye viewports.\n. @oatssss Turning on the Development Build option in the Build dialog makes the flashing textures problem go away for me.  I've also removed all traces of GUI calls, and the SkyboxMesh script as well.  Can you see if it helps you?\n. @VanKurt Can you try an experiment?  Put in the extra Camera like I suggested to @darkesco upthread, and remove SkyboxMesh, StereoLensFlare, and all CardboardGUI stuff from the project.  Do not enable Development Build.  Does this fix your rendering issues?  (I've been noticing lately that I haven't had to enable this anymore.)\n. @VanKurt That's what I'm seeing too, only now my scene not showing the problem was showing it before I made various changes to it.  That means the bug, wherever it is hiding, is triggered under very specific conditions, which aren't clear yet.  The experiment I had you try was a test for one possible condition (depth buffer not being properly cleared), but that doesn't seem to be it.\n@darkesco The component to remove is SkyboxMesh, located on MainCamera alongside StereoController.\n. New version 0.4.9 is out.  It includes all the fixes we've discussed here:  Unity 5 import errors, the kaleidoscope around the outside edges, etc.  Note:  Development mode may still be needed, but double check.\n. @VanKurt There are instructions for upgrading a project to the new version here:\nhttps://developers.google.com/cardboard/unity/release-notes\n. Yes, but I think the Release Notes are not clear.  Look down at the upgrade\ninstructions for v0.4.5 too.  There are some files to delete under Plugins.\nOn Mar 27, 2015 12:21 AM, \"VanKurt\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@smdol https://github.com/smdol That's exactly what I did: remove the\nold Cardboard folder, then import the new package.

Also, for anyone else reading: Don't just copy the Cardboard/ directory into your project.  It doesn't include the native libraries.  Those are in the Plugins/ directory which is only in the unitypackage.\n. @VanKurt Just noticed your update.  Good that it imports without error.  Does the Development Build option fix the flicker?\n. It's a shot in the dark whether Development Build is needed, it seems.  Currently I can build all of my test projects in Unity 5, and the only one that needs Development Build is the original version of the DemoScene (the one now in the Legacy subdirectory).  The rest work fine without this option.  It sure is hard to figure out what the problem is in this kind of situation...\n. @999999333 You select the tag corresponding to the previous release in the Branch: menu.  See attached picture.\n\n. Check the adb logcat for an exception being thrown or other error messages.\n. No, those are normal, or at least not new.\n. As the original issue (supporting Unity 5) is alive and well in the latest release, I'll close this post.\n. Source is now unpacked, although not from pulling this patch -- other changes made it incompatible.\n. Could you try again with the new release 0.4.9?  Also, make sure you have the latest Unity 5.  I haven't seen any compiler complaints about UnityEngine.\n. If you upgraded the plugin in an existing project, make sure remove some old files in the Plugins/Android from the previous version.  See the release notes:\n    https://developers.google.com/cardboard/unity/release-notes\n\nlibRenderingPlugin.so is one of them.\n(Unity does not remove old files when importing an updated package.  It just overwrites existing ones and add new ones.)\n. Unity 5 correctly handles off-center projections for skyboxes, so the script is #if'ed to a nullity in Unity 5.  So compile issues no longer occur.\n. So far the best workaround that had been found, until this big is chased\ndown, is to enable the Development Build option in the Build dialog.\nPlease try that and say if it helps or not.\nOn Mar 20, 2015 2:29 PM, \"Justin Hamilton\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI am running Unity 5.0.0f4 and the cardboard-unity 0.4.5.\nI have tried creating a basic scene with a plane, and pull in the\nCardboardMain prefab from the Cardboard/Prefabs folder, I can run fine in\nthe editor, but when I try running it on my device (Nexus 5 running Android\n5.1) I get the initial splash screen, followed by a completely white screen.\nI have also tried running the DemoScene after removing references to\nCardboardGUI, but then I only get the Unity splash screen, which never\nupdates.\nAny help is greatly appreciated!\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/googlesamples/cardboard-unity/issues/24.\n.

Unity fixed this in 5.1, it appears.\n. I've seen that appear as well. It shows up often when using Image Effects and building for Android. There are lots of forum questions about this, also asking what to do about it.\n\nNone of the suggestions on the forums have worked when the texture number is 0x0, because that's the main screen, and thus the destination RenderTexture reference is null in OnRenderImage().\nNote that the Image Effect is only used in the editor, not on the phone.  It's just a preview. So the performance warning does not really apply.\nYou can turn off the message by telling Unity to not emulate OpenGL ES2 in Play mode, which is under Edit -> Graphics Emulation. Or you can turn off the preview by editing the Cardboard component's Simulate Distortion Correction setting. And you can make Unity not fill the Console window with these messages by clicking the button that makes it not show repeats.\n. Latest release of Unity (4.6.4, and 5.0.1) seem to fix this issue.\n. Which version of Unity did you build with?\n. Confirmed.  Just got it to happen.  Digging into the logcat...\nEdit: This happened when I touched the screen after a couple of minutes.  Same for you, or did the ANR just pop up on its own?\nHere's what I see in logcat:\nI/WindowManager(  891): Input event dispatching timed out sending to com.google.vr.anrtest/com.google.vrtoolkit.cardboard.plugins.unity.UnityCardboardActivity.

That, and something about the M8.\n.

In my tests, this scene came out the correct way (floor down).  Looking in to it...\n. Have you tried Unity 5 as well?\n. If you turn off nativeDistortionCorrection, it should also go back to normal.\n. OK, I got this to happen on my phone too.  Sad, because it was supposed to be fixed before 0.4.10 was released.  \nSo if you are using Unity 4 Free, turn off nativeDistortionCorrection on the Cardboard object to restore the behavior to what it was in 0.4.9.\n. Yep, and that's why I'm bummed you ran  into this.  Although, if Unity 5 is\na possibility, give it a shot.

Can you check with v0.5 of the Cardboard SDK?  It has some changes that will hopefully fix this.\n. It can be removed safely.\n. It has been commented out in v0.5.1.\n. This seems like a good idea, although the results could vary across phone models.  Maybe the brightness level should be a user control (through the settings button), and all the SDK needs to do it make sure it is constant.\n. Not setting brightness to max is easy to do.  In the short term, it can be a developer setting.  That ought to be deliverable in the very near future.  (Notice I am not actually committing -- not allowed to.)\n. Interesting.  It is set to 1.0f in code.\n. Sorry for the delay in response.  Things got pushed back.  Adjustable brightness is still TBD.\n. That seems like it will work, aside from future compatibility.\n. Can you grab the output of \"adb logcat\"?  It will probably show some useful debug messages.\n. Hmm.  Multiple scene projects were tested, and this wasn't seen, but maybe that was luck of the draw.  I can think of a mechanism that could cause this (double instantiation of the UnityVrActivityListener), which I can look into.  As a workaround, if you make the Cardboard object live across level loads, this should not occur.\n. Fixed in the v0.5.1 release.\n. Find the GraphicsRaycaster component, and try changing its mask to not hit the layer that holds those elements.\n. Finally got a hint that might help:  Add a CanvasGroup to the UI object, and clear the \"Blocks Raycasts\" setting.\n\nhttp://answers.unity3d.com/questions/830371/ui-46-image-blocks-mouse-click.htmlhttp://answers.unity3d.com/questions/830371/ui-46-image-blocks-mouse-click.html\n. Oops, managed to paste the link twice before.  Try this:\nhttp://answers.unity3d.com/questions/830371/ui-46-image-blocks-mouse-click.html\n. Summary of the answer at the above link:\nAdd a CanvasGroup component to the Canvas, and set its \"Blocks Raycast\" property to false.\n. The scenes we have profiled showed no performance drop in Unity 4 (for some, there is a performance boost).  I haven't profiled Unity 5 as much, because of that horrible glitchy rendering bug that strikes randomly.  So it is possible that Unity 5 performance has suffered.  If so, I'd guess it has to do with the new shaders and GI, but I'm not sure.  When you turn off distortion correction, did you do it with the Cardboard.SDK.DistortionCorrection flag, or some other way?\n. The native distortion was turned off in Unity 5 due to that render glitch problem that appears in some scenes but not others (all black screen, all white, or flashing textures).\nGood news:  So far it looks like the glitch problem is solved in Unity 5.1 (currently in beta).  None of my tests so far have shown the glitch, even ones that do when I build with 5.0.2.\nThis means that we'll likely change the debugDisableNativeDistortion flag to false, just like you did here, in the next release.\n. This usually happens if you don't add resources.bundle to the Xcode project.  See https://developers.google.com/cardboard/unity/get-started-ios\n. The volume key policy changed, because the NFC tag has been deprecated.  In older versions of the SDK, the NFC tag was used to detect an \"in Cardboard\" state, and volume keys were disabled because they often get accidentally pushed due to contact with the viewer (plus, being encased in cardboard, they couldn't be reached anyway).  Now, without being able to use the NFC tag, the SDK must assume \"in Cardboard\" whenever VR mode is enabled, and the volume keys are disabled accordingly.  Your app is specific to a viewing device that doesn't enclose the phone?\nThe \"held down\" state has never been supported for the Cardboard Trigger event, because many phones have calibrated compasses, so detecting this with the magnet trigger (for original Cardboard viewers) was not consistent.  So you must be checking for screen taps directly?  And you must have TapIsTrigger set to false?\n. OK, I think I see where the errors you listed above are coming from, and they are bugs that occur when TapIsTrigger is disabled.  I believe they are new to v0.5, since the underlying native code implementation changed.  Also, the new native code intercepts screen touches and turns them into \"tap\" events, which is probably why you are seeing the two-finger issue (the first one is absorbed by the native code).\nI'm going to put these in as bugs and feature requests internally.  For your short term purposes, would reverting to v0.4.9 work for you?\n. Yes, right from this site.  Just select a tag where it currently says \"master\".\n. This may only be a hacky workaround, but you can adjust the volume if you press the gear icon first.  When done, hit the Cancel button to go back to the game.\n. OK.  Can you use the 'tap gear icon, adjust value, hit Cancel' workaround (for now anyway)?  Also, the volume keys are only disabled in VR mode.  If the app exits VR mode, the volume keys work.  (I understand this is ad hoc.)\n. Yes.  The motivation for turning the keys off is that when a phone is snug inside a cardboard shell, just holding the cardboard tightly can cause the keys to get activated.  The volume level pop-up is not in stereo, so it really hurts the eyes when it appears. \nWhat we probably need is a field in the QR code that says whether the viewer is closed or open.  The SDK could just leave the keys be when the viewer is open.\n. The volume key behavior is actually intended for users who get apps from the online stores.  You as a developer don't know what kind of viewer they'll be using.  (At this point, neither does the SDK.)  The SDK was designed when the only viewer model was a fully-enclosing bit of cardboard.  It tends to toggle the volume keys repeatedly -- if you haven't noticed that, that's because the volume key disabling has been doing its job...\nAs for changing the volume, no need to go through the Cardboard SDK for that.  You have full access to the Android / iOS operating system you are running on.\nAnyway, for the general user, I actually see a couple of ways to tackle this problem:\n1)  The QR code has a bit that says whether the viewer it describes is an enclosing type or not.\n2)  The settings dialog (gear button) sprouts an additional button called \"Preferences\" that lets the user override various settings, such as volume keys.\n. Don't know about iOS, but on Android, you can control volume through the AudioManager class:\n  http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager.html\nUnity provides a proxy class that lets you communicate with Java classes like the above:\n  http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AndroidJavaProxy.html\nSee the script BaseAndroidDevice.cs, which has example code that uses this.  So controlling the volume should be doable right now.\nThe issue you mention about putting the volume overlay in 3D is a good one.  This is one of the things that probably cannot be done so easily on stock Android:  Samsung hacked up their version of Android for Gear, and that may be one of the changes they put in.\n. Yes, that's correct.  The keypress happens, and the native SDK code says \"if in VR mode, don't pass this key to Unity\".  That's the point -- in Cardboard-type viewers, these keys are getting pressed spuriously because the phone is pressed up against the cardboard.  Those keypresses are not intended by the user, they cause the not-in-stereo volume bar to appear, which hurts the user's eyes, etc.  But if we had an augmented QR code that tells the SDK \"hey, this viewer doesn't enclose the phone\", then the SDK would not stop them from passing through. \nBut if you want to add floating buttons in virtual space that adjust volume, you don't need the keypresses, right?\n. Well, like I said, when the phone is in a Cardboard, most of the volume key presses are accidental, from the cardboard squeezing against the side of the phone.  Also, there's no way to suppress the 2D overlay (at least since Android 5.0 -- got rid of \"silent\" mode).\n. Volume controls are no longer disabled in Cardboard as of v0.5.2, the injectKeyPress error is also fixed in the same release.\n. I am able to build and run an IL2CPP Universal version of the SDK's demo scene, starting from a fresh project and importing the SDK.  This worked in both Unity 4.6.4 and 5.1.0.  I left most of the settings like stripping and Mono level.  \nCould you try this step, and see if you get the same results?  (Either I missed something you did or there is some other issue at work here.)\n. OK.  I recommend trying with a new blank project for the \"nothing but cardboard\" experiment.  Trying to scrub stuff out of a Unity project is tricky because all kinds of changes lurk in various places.  Then if that works, add in the other plugin to this new project and try again.\n. When you created your nothing-but-cardboard project, what build settings did you change?  I'll try the same.  Also, did you unpack the unity package on the Mac, or copy the files from Windows?  Make sure to try unpacking on the Mac.  (Let's get Windows completely out of the equation.)\n. That bug has been logged internally.  A fix will be forthcoming.\n. Unfortunately I'm really not allowed to give specific dates or time frames.  Sorry...\n. Could you get a description of what was happening from the one who tweeted you?  Crash, black screen, no \"Skip\" button, ignored all screen touches, etc?\n. Was the bloom effect attached to the parent main camera or to the stereo left and right cameras?\n. Additional question: which version of the Cardboard SDK are you using?\n. OK.  I am not able to reproduce this error.  Can you look in the editor log file to see if it manages to put out any error messages before it disappears?\n. This looks like an important line:\n    RenderTexture.Create failed: format unsupported.\nDoes this only happen when the bloom effect is being used?  Is it the standard Unity Bloom script, or some other one?  \nI guess the key thing to figure out know is that format.  There might be one in the bloom script.  Also, the default format for the Cardboard stereo texture is RGB565, which you can change in the BaseVrDevice.CreateStereoScreen() function, if you want to try that.\n. @thesambassador What's your version of Unity?\n. Can you post a screenshot?  That's pretty wacky-sounding, and I don't think I've seen it before.\n. As an experiment, can you change your Build Platform to Android?\n. OK, experiment #2:  Direct Render off, Use RenderTextureFormat.Default, and in turn off DistortionCorrection on the CardboardMain object.  (This just turns off the Image Effect that Unity is using in the Editor for distortion -- one less step in the pipeline.)\n. I'm looking at your screenshot with the black sky.  Something odd -- there's a faint bluish outline around the edge of the sky, where the vignette is supposed to be.  It's like the blue sky is being rendered behind the black sky (which is also obscuring the particles).\n. OK, this is definitely strange.  It seems to be specific to Windows (I have a Mac and don't experience any issue).  So I'm shooting in the dark a bit, but let's see what we can do to characterize the problem a bit more.\nExperiment #3: In the Cardboard.cs function AddDummyCamera(), change the color from black to something else.  Does the mysterious black sky follow suit, or stay black?\nExperiment #4: Comment out the use of AddDummyCamera() altogether.  Does the problem still occur?\nExperiment #5:  In Player Settings, in the tab for Windows, clear the \"Use DirectX 11\" checkbox.  This makes Unity use DirectX 9.  Still get black sky?  If no, can you go back to RGB565?\nExperiment #6:  Start Unity with --force-opengl (you'll have to edit the shortcut properties).  You won't see  in the title bar now.  Same question as for #5.\nIn #3 and #4 I'm looking at what's going on in the depth buffer.  In #5 and #6 it's about the graphics API the editor is using.\n. I figured out the weird \"Black Sky\" effect you were seeing when using RenderTextureFormat.Default:  If the render texture format has an alpha channel, then the non-direct-render path will blend the temporary render texture onto the screen.  The default blue sky color on Main Camera has a nearly transparent alpha value, so it is getting blended away.  I changed the alpha to 255 in the Main Camera's sky color, and the black sky effect is gone.\n. Reproduced. Looks like the 'device' member is null until you hit Play in the editor once.\n. OK, this will be fixed in an upcoming release.\n. If you mean to render OnGUI in VR, see the Legacy/DemoScene which has an example of doing that.\n. Is this GUI meant to be in VR mode or out of VR mode?\n. If you are willing to modify the Cardboard.cs script slightly, you can get something to draw on the screen after the stereo view is done.  That would be in the EndOfFrame() function.  You can use CardboardOnGUIWindow script as well.  Which version of the Cardboard SDK are you using?  (The exact way to do this depends on the version.)\n. @ro4tub The new 0.5.1 release should fix the missing java function bug.\n. @smxthereisonlyone Try turning off TapIsTrigger on the Cardboard script.  That setting makes screen touches look like magnet trigger events (which only happens on Android but not iPhone).\n. You can see screen taps either with Input.touches or Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0).\n. This is a bug (or misfeature) of the v0.5 SDK.  It hides real screen touches (of the first finger) whenever Cardboard.SDK.VRModeEnabled == true, reporting them as Cardboard.Triggered instead.  It will be fixed in an upcoming release.\n. When it is fixed, then Input.touchCount will work as you want it to.  In the meantime, you could use a previous version of the SDK (v0.4.9) which did not have this issue.  Make sure you Cardboard.SDK.TapIsTrigger = false too.\n. That bug will be fixed in an upcoming release.  Thanks for reporting!\n. Are you using the OnTilt event to register a handler?  If so, try switching to using \nif (Cardboard.SDK.Tilted) ....\nin an Update() function.  \n(We have found an issue with unregistering C# event handlers on Cardboard.SDK during app quit or level loading.)\n. Would it be possible to get a stripped down test case project that reproduces the problem?\n. If you are seeing the crash from rotating the phone and later pausing/quitting/loading, yes, we have traced down the crash to the event handler in the native code that looks for this rotation to occur (it's called a \"Tilt\" event).  Exact cause is not determined, but it is definitely related to that particular event handler.  It's in the native code layer, so there's no easy workaround at the Unity level. \n. Yes, it should.  Thanks!\n. Fixed in v0.5.2.\n. This bug will be fixed in the next release.\n. Fixed in v0.5.1\n. It's not available, and it's actually been retired in favor of a new C++ backend.  Whether that one gets open sourced is a separate issue, but we're not allowed to talk about plans like that.\n. Is it similar to the issue here?\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleCardboard/comments/3evtwk/stereo_cubemaps_viewer_in_unity/\nOr like this one here?\nhttps://plus.sandbox.google.com/106479673975069899471/posts/Dv7YPJUD8zJ\nLet me know if either of those posts match, and if the ideas there help you.\n. I'm a bit surprised it works in iOS, actually.  Normally screen overlays are hidden, because the Cardboard SDK overwrites the framebuffer during distortion correction.  This is why it is recommended to use World Space UI (or rather, one reason why).\n. Yeah, the volume keys get turned off because when the phone is encased in Cardboard, just holding the outside a little tight can push activate them by accident.  How bad it is depends on which viewer and which model.\nBut if you touch the gear button, then the volume keys become active again till you press Cancel and go back to the game.\n. Does this also happen if you turn off VR Mode?\n. Can you post a screenshot of it with VR Mode turned off, for comparison?\n. Wow, very interesting.  BTW, which version of Unity are you using?  I can try to reproduce it.\n. I tried your package in Unity 5.1.1, with the build platform set to Android.  Seems OK, but maybe I don't have all the same settings you did.  Here's a screenshot.  Did you see this in the editor or on the phone?\n\n. OK, I'll close the issue.\n. Answer added to the StackOverflow page.  Delete the old Cardboard/ and Plugins/ folder (assuming you have no other native code plugins), then import the new version of the SDK.\n. Copying the answer from SO here.\nhttps://developers.google.com/cardboard/unity/release-notes\nRelease notes for v0.5.1 explain: You must remove the Assets/Cardboard/ folder, and all Cardboard-related libraries from the Assets/Plugins folder before upgrading. (If you use no other plugins, just delete the Plugins folder itself.)\nThis is because a number of files got renamed and moved around for v0.5.1, but Unity's package importer doesn't look for that (it would be very difficult to do). If you just import the new package, you get some files left over from the old version of the package, which leads to the error you see.\n. As a test, try this.  Clear the MainCamera's \"enabled\" checkbox, and turn on the \"enabled\" checkbox of the left and right eye cameras.  Does this make any difference to the problem?  (There may be other side effects too.)\n. Does this happen when part of the face is off screen, or does that not matter?\n. I have filed the bug internally, so it is being tracked.\n. BTW, what phone(s) did you see this on?\n. You may also want to report this to Unity.  They've fixed a number of bugs recently in the 5.x family that addressed issues that Cardboard apps have been running into.  These have to do with using the native rendering plugin interface + RenderTextures.  This problem feels like it could be one of those.\n. The first thing worth trying is to switch from 16 bits to 24 bits for the depth map.  There are two places that 16 bits are used in the SDK:  CreateStereoScreen() in BaseVRDevice.cs and Render() in CardboardEye.cs (which is only used if you turn off Direct Render).\n. Also, are you using any Image Effects or deferred rendering?\n. Could you try the new v0.5.2 build and see if the Unity-based distortion avoids this problem?  Or if it doesn't.  (Either way, I'd like to know.)  BTW, on the Cardboard script, there's now a slider to downscale the RenderTexture.  You can get some extra FPS out of that perhaps.\n. 1.0 is basically equivalent to the old SDK, in that it does not change the default size of the RenderTexture.  This slider just multiplies the width and height of the default size, and makes the RenderTexture equal to that size instead.\n. I think the \"Place your phone into Cardboard\" screen responds only to Landscape Left, but the rest of the Cardboard SDK should work in either landscape mode.  (Note: I'm using the Android convention.  \"Left\" means the top of the phone goes on the left side.)  The bias towards Landscape Left comes from the original Cardboard model, with the magnet and NFC tag:  The phone needs to be placed so that the sensors can pick up those inputs.  Other viewing devices that don't have either of those inputs can theoretically work with the phone in either orientation.\nQuestion for @DavidSotir: When you were seeing the reversed directions, where was the settings gear icon being drawn (top or bottom)?\n. That's a good idea.  Unity 4 will still be supported for the time being, so there would still be some clutter for that version since it doesn't support AARs.\n. Turning AA on in Unity's render settings won't have an effect, since the SDK renders to a RenderTexture and then uses native GL code to draw that to the screen.  It should be possible to set up the RenderTexture for AA by overriding or modifying the RenderTexture that the Cardboard.cs script uses.\nOne app I know of, the Cardboard Design Lab, was able to use 2x MSAA at 60fps by using a different distortion correction technique (moving vertexes in camera space, and rendering direct to the screen).  It's a method that is being looked at for inclusion in the SDK.  The downside is you need will to keep your triangles small onscreen, which will affect how you model them.\n(As phones get more powerful in the next few years, this issue may fade away.)\n. Yeah, that advice is for when you aren't using distortion correction.  I believe you have to set the \"antiAliasing\" field of the RenderTexture to 2 or higher.\nhttp://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/RenderTexture-antiAliasing.html\n(I'm suggesting this so you can at least try it without waiting for a new release, which could be whenever.)\n. Edit the file BaseVRDevice.cs in Assets/Cardboard/Scripts/VRDevices, and change the function \"CreateStereoScreen\" to this:\npublic virtual RenderTexture CreateStereoScreen() {\n    Debug.Log(\"Creating new default cardboard screen texture.\");\n    var rt = new RenderTexture(Screen.width, Screen.height, 16, RenderTextureFormat.RGB565);\n    rt.antiAliasing = 2;   // <-- This is the new line\n    return rt;\n  }\nYou can experiment with 2, 4, and 8.  On my Nexus 5, 2 seems ok performance-wise.\n. Could be HW.  What phone are you using?\nI tried it before posting the suggestion, and it certainly made a difference, at least on the cube (less so on the floor texture).  Also in the frame rate.\nForcing MSAA should have no effect unless you turn off distortion, since the distortion renderer bypasses Unity's main framebuffer.\n. What version of Android?  The link below says it needs to be 4.2 or higher:\nhttp://www.jayceooi.com/how-to-enable-4x-msaa-in-opengl-es-2-0-android-apps-games/\n. @MiCkSoftware  Looks like aniso can be set to 0, so I'll do that.  \nI also tried linear filtering and didn't see a difference.  But the native distortion correction code sets up a sampler for the texture with filtering hardcoded to linear, so that may be why.  It might help with the Unity fallback distortion correction though.\n. The new v0.5.2 release sets the RenderTexture's antialiasing from the project's Quality settings now.\n. Which viewer are you using?  I don't see much chromatic aberration myself, but I understand it can be worse if the lens separation is very different from your actual eye separation.\nThe trouble with doing chromatic aberration correction on current mobile devices is that it absolutely kills the frame rate, which can then causes sickness and nausea instead.  So the problem would have to be pretty bad for a lot of people on a lot of devices to make the tradeoff worthwhile -- at least right now. \n. I haven't tried ALPSVR either, but they are using the same kind of shader for distortion as the Cardboard SDK's fallback in-Unity shader, which @MiCkSoftware you have said in another bug is too slow for your app.  (That's without the additional texture lookups for aberration correction.)  Of course, the Cardboard rendering code could be a factor contributing to that performance, and it has room to be optimized.  So there's no reason to rule out adding CA as an option.  I'll log it internally as a feature request.\n. There's a very nice viewer by GoggleTech, the C1-Glass, which has lenses whose separation can be adjusted.  They're pretty high quality too, and the viewer overall is as portable as any pair of glasses.  I really like it, and I don't notice any obvious aberration with them.  Might be worth trying to see if the aberration issue is related to eye-separation vs lens-separation.  (This is not to imply CA will never be addressed in the SDK, just something that can be done right away.)\n. Yep, those are factors too.  Leaving aside quality of optics for a moment, basically, the chromatic aberration is minimized when your pupils are centered over the lenses and you are looking straight ahead.  Larger lenses make it easier to look farther off center, and of course the separation mismatch I mentioned previously also contributes.  Also, if your eyes are in certain prescription ranges or you have had laser surgery, then CA can be worse just from that.  Finally, as you said, quality of optics is a factor.\n. Haven't looked at CMOAR yet, but Oculus Mobile is for Gear VR, which is running on a heavily modified Android stack.  The savings from those mods make the extra time for chromatic aberration worth it.  Stock Android isn't there yet (at least the last time we did performance testing for it).  I'm sure we'll reach that point before too long (I hope!).\n. No, as I understand it, the Samsung version of Android has a bunch of \"back doors\" in it that Gear VR can use.  (It's not uncommon for phone manufacturers to modify Android in various ways for their hardware.)\n. Re: Schedule of Releases.  The reason I have to be vague about release dates and upcoming features is that, even though I work full time on Cardboard VR, I am just an engineer and I don't have the authority to publicly commit Google the Corporation to anything.  I'm not in a position to make promises or implications about Google's future plans for Cardboard.\nSo what I do on this forum is 1) Find out about problems that users run into and new features they would like in the SDK, which I funnel back to the internal issue tracking system;  2) Help users make progress (work around bugs, implement a feature) with the currently released SDK.\nPersonally I think (and I stress, this is my personal opinion):  Cardboard is a way to turn any capable smartphone into a VR device.  It needs no additional expensive hardware, or any specific phone running a modified version of Android, just something you already likely have in your pocket.  So it can be used pretty much anywhere, at any time, as long as you have a cheap phone-holder with lenses and a QR code.\nAs long as the size of the audience willing to play with and use VR software (games and apps) is larger than the size of the audience willing to buy additional VR-specific hardware like Leap or Gear, then there's a market for Cardboard or something just like it.  There's also a severe shortage of VR-savvy developers in the world, and Cardboard is a nearly zero-cost way to get in and learn how to do it (assuming you already have the phone).\nSo that's what I feel about Cardboard, and why I'm glad to be able to work on it.  Again, that's my personal opinion, and I don't (can't) speak for Google Inc in any way.\n. To do positional tracking for VR, you need accuracy within a few cm or less and latency in the 10s of milliseconds.  The existing phone sensors are definitely not good enough for that.  There's another Google project called Tango (https://www.google.com/atap/project-tango/) that is tackling that problem.  I've also seen attempts to do position tracking using the camera and a vision SDK like Qualcomm's Vuforia (https://developer.vuforia.com/).  That's still not quite in the \"good enough\" range, but is getting better.\n. You should be able to add those separately.  They appear through the Input class as buttons and axes.\n. The 90 degree rotation causes an event called \"Tilt\".  When TapIsTrigger is turned off, then tilt appears as an Escape key (just like magnet triggers appear as screen taps).  You can stop this in your current project by editing CardboardAndroidDevice.cs in Assets/Cardboard/Scripts/VRDevices, and removing the \"injectKeyPress\" line in ProcessEvents().\n. This is changed in v0.5.2, which now has a separate \"Back Button\" in the top left corner of the screen.  This button is equivalent to the normal Android back button, which is usually hidden in VR mode.  The Tilt event still exists but has no key equivalent anymore.\n. That doesn't happen for me.  First thing to do is check the logcat for any error messages.  \nYou mentioned in another issue that you use Unity 5.1, which would rule out some of the Unity bugs in 5.0 that they fixed which affected Cardboard apps this way.\n. The logcat is where Android apps dump all their logging info on the phone.  You can print it out on your computer using the \"adb\" command.  That's a command-line / console tool included in the Android SDK, in the platform-tools/ subdirectory.  \nIf you don't have a platform-tools subdirectory, you have to open the Android SDK manager and install the \"Android SDK Platform-tools\" package to get it.  To do that, run the \"android\" command in the SDK's tools/ directory and use the GUI that appears to select and install it.  \nOnce you have it, and your phone is connected by USB, open a console window and run the \"adb logcat\" command.\n. Yep, the Cardboard SDK has never worked with multithreaded rendering in Unity.  It's in the release notes here:\n    https://developers.google.com/cardboard/unity/release-notes#known_issues\n. I really hope so, but I think it's Unity's issue with native rendering plugins.\n. Actually, all that Reset() currently does (by default) is call Recenter().  It might be better to remove that and let you (the app developer) decide when recentering is appropriate, and call Cardboard.Recenter() when you want.  Reset() is really meant to tell the device class to clear any internal state that should not survive a level load.\n. The new v0.5.2 seems to not crash with multithreading enabled, so that's nice.  The gyro seems more jittery though, which is not so nice.  Still trying to figure that out.  Closing this bug as it was originally about the \"multithreading black screen\".\n. Unity sees the Back button as an Escape keypress, so you can respond to it using Input.GetKeyUp().\n. The Cardboard SDK also uses GL.IssuePluginEvent() to jump into native code for distortion correction, so it looks like both your plugin and the Cardboard SDK are supplying a native UnityRenderEvent() function.  In that case, I'm not sure which one Unity will call from GL.IssuePluginEvent (first native library loaded wins?), and I'm actually surprised it works on any phone.\nIf you are certain your native function is being called by GL.IssuePluginEvent(), then you can get the SDK to handle distortion entirely in Unity as follows.  Edit BaseCardboardDevice.cs in Assets/Cardboard/Scripts/VRDevices, and make the following changes:\n- Set debugDisableNativeDistortionCorrection = true\n- Set debugDisableNativeUILayer = true\n- In PostRender(), remove or comment out the entire if (vrMode) { ... } block\n. Ah, I was beginning to suspect from your post that Unity might be calling all the UnityRenderEvent functions.  Definitely will take your suggestion for using a unique id.\nAnyway, the Cardboard native distortion code is given the GL texture id of the RenderTexture that was used to render the scene.  It just renders a mesh with a shader sampling that texture with a barrel distortion applied to the coordinates, once for each eye.  It also draws the vertical line between the eyes.  The code does try to save and restore GL state while doing this, but I don't personally know how extensive that is.\n. (Definitely like to follow up with you about that main thread being stalled...)\nThe two eye cameras are rendered into a single RenderTexture, side by side.  That texture's id has been passed to the native code during an init phase.  There's only one GL.IssuePluginEvent() call per frame in the SDK, and the native code it jumps into renders the distortion mesh twice, once for each eye, to the screen.  I don't think it changes glActiveTexture but I'm not absolutely certain.\nAs for seeing the code, it hasn't been open sourced.  If/when that happens (hopefully \"when\" where \"when\" == \"soon\", but that's just my personal feeling)...\n. I read a great suggestion on a blog post somewhere:  if you run on a Tegra-based Android device, you can use PerfHud to grab all the gl calls.\nOn iOS, you can do this right in Xcode.  The Unity gl pipeline might be different on iOS (make sure it doesn't use Metal), but the Cardboard SDK gl calls should be the same as on Android.\n. It looks like glActiveTexture is being set, but the code saves and restores it.\n. @SoylentGraham Question:  Does Graphics.DrawMeshNow() cause any performance hiccups if used in an OnPostRender() method?\n. Yes, you can use skyboxes in Unity.  In Unity 4, the SDK handles it automatically with a script called SkyboxMesh.  In Unity 5, skyboxes should work out of the box.\n. That indicates Unity is using Metal for the graphics API instead of OpenGL.  You can control this in the Player Settings panel.  But the app should still work either way -- these are warnings, not errors.  Are you not getting distortion correction or the alignment marker?\n. In Unity 4, under Configuration in \"Other Settings\", change \"Graphics API\" from to \"Force OpenGL ES 2\" (or ES 3).\nIn Unity 5, under Rendering in \"Other Settings\", uncheck \"Automatic Graphics API\" and then remove Metal from the list of APIs that appears.\n. OK, first, did the warnings you listed in the first post go away?  Next, make sure you have the Alignment Marker checkbox enabled in the Cardboard component (on CardboardMain's root game object).  At this point, is the Alignment Marker all that is missing?\n. Ah, screen all black is a different problem altogether.  It wasn't clear from your first post that you were seeing nothing at all.  OK, let's tackle that.  First, reenable Metal.  Then go in to the Cardboard options and disable VR Mode Enabled, so none of the stereo rendering stuff is active.  It is still black?\n. What's your version of Unity?\n. New v0.5.2 release should show the UI layer regardless of Metal or OpenGL, since it's now implemented using normal iOS View and ViewController objects.\n. Two communities that are about Google Cardboard are here:\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/googlecardboard\nGoogle+:  https://plus.sandbox.google.com/u/0/communities/111524380182206513071\nThey aren't Unity-based per se, but anyone talking about development is quite often referring to Unity.\n. Just to check:\n-  You have the iCloud capability enabled in the Xcode project?\n-  You have \"Sync with Cardboard\" enabled in the CardboardMain settings?\n. How are you highlighting the button?  Are you using GazeInputModule, or something else?\n. The only way I know offhand is Handheld.Vibrate:\nhttp://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Handheld.Vibrate.html\n. There are several fields for the accelerometer on the Input class:\nhttp://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Input.html\n. AndroidJavaClass used to be an IDisposable... I wonder if that change in the recent versions of Unity?  I'll check.  There are a couple of places in that script where it is used like this:\nusing (AndroidJavaClass player = new AndroidJavaClass(\"com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayer\")) {\n    androidActivity = player.GetStatic<AndroidJavaObject>(\"currentActivity\");\n}\nTry changing it to just this:\nAndroidJavaClass player = new AndroidJavaClass(\"com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayer\");\nandroidActivity = player.GetStatic<AndroidJavaObject>(\"currentActivity\");\nDoes that fix the error?  If so, you can do that and carry on.  Also, I'll install 5.1.3 (I have 5.1.1) and check it out too.\n. Make a similar change:\nAndroidJavaClass player = new AndroidJavaClass(cardboardClass);\nandroidActivity = player.CallStatic(\"getActivity\");\nThere may be a couple more \"using (...) { ... }\" in the SDK.  Make the same kind of change for each.\n. OK, thanks!  I think I have an idea on that black screen from returning to the app.  Can you try this?\nIn Cardboard.cs, in the StereoScreen property, there are these lines in the set {} block:\nif (stereoScreen != null && !stereoScreen.IsCreated()) {\n      stereoScreen.Create();\n  }\nThe idea is to move these lines into the get {} block, right before the line \"return stereoScreen;\".\n. @justinwasilenko OK, so I guess that suggestion isn't the right fix.\n@2600th you comment does strengthen the suspicion that something has gotten messed up or reset in the StereoScreen on returning to the app, because when distortion correction is off, this texture is not used:  the scene is rendered directly to the display.  \nWell, we'll keep working on this...\n. @rtauziac What phone do you use?  Is there a way you can print out the Screen.dpi value that Unity returns in both 5.1.2 and 5.2?  This number is passed to the native layer of the SDK, where it is used to calculate the physical size of the screen (in mm).  Different values would cause the SDK to think the phone size changed, which would directly cause the effect you describe.\n. If you go into the function Init() in BaseCardboardDevice.cs and use Screen.xdpi, Screen.ydpi instead of Screen.dpi, do you get any different results?\n. Hm.  So it doesn't.  It used to, but I guess they got retired.\n. Actually, I may be imagining things -- those fields are available on Android DisplayMetrics.\n. So it looks like Unity 5.2 is doing something unexpected, or undocumented.  It's probably worth asking them why the DPI changes so much in 5.2 -- is it a bug or a fix?\n. I found some code on the Unity Forums that lets you ask Android directly for the info:\n    http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/finding-physical-screen-size.203017/#post-1373867\nYou can get both width and height, plus xdpi and ydpi.\nIt may be worth trying this code in 5.2, to see if it matches more closely what you see with Unity 5.1.  If you do, let me know whether it works out.\n. I just noticed that the code I linked above is calling \"getMetrics\".  You might want to try \"getRealMetrics\" instead.\n. iOS is much simpler.  There are basically 2 possible DPI values, the one for 6 Plus (and now 6 Plus S, I think), and everything else.  One of the benefits of having a single hardware vendor (Apple), I suppose.\n. The new release of the SDK (v0.5.2) should fix these DPI issues for both Android and iOS.\n. Did you follow the guidelines on their site for modifying the Cardboard scripts?  There's a step in there you have to undo.\n. Is the square in the very center of the phone, or along the bottom edge?  And does it happen also when you don't use Vuforia?\n. I haven't used Vuforia enough to know.  The one line you commented out worked for my project, because it didn't show the video passthrough.  You may want to ask the question on the Vuforia forums.\n. The lens distortion is handled in native code.  The function BaseCardboardDevice.PostRender() is where the native code is called (through GL.IssuePluginEvent).\n. Cardboard is just an SDK that runs on top of whatever version of Android you have on whatever phone you have.  If this whole VR thing really takes off, I expect there will be changes similar to what Samsung did for Gear.  You're right it is mostly a software problem, but some crucial parts of it are at the OS level.\nAs far as good current hardware, I've found that iPhones rank up there (personal opinion).  In fact, the SDK turns off drift correction for iOS because it is basically not needed.\n. I use an iPhone 6 for testing.  It's much better.\n. Several hacks are in the native code, but we may be at the limit of what can be done on current stock Android.  The other tack is to optimize the app itself. \nFor comparison, have you looked at the Cardboard Design Lab app?  It is the best performing Cardboard app I know of.  How does latency look with it?\n. Yep, they used a modified version of the SDK to do distortion correction in vertex shaders.  Works really well, but it's a bit more work on the app developer's side.\n. That's not really recommended unless you are going to implement vertex-displacement distortion correction.\nhttp://gamasutra.com/blogs/BrianKehrer/20160125/264161/VR_Distortion_Correction_using_Vertex_Displacement.php\n. @ReedL That is correct.  Sorry.  But it will be announced in the release notes when a requested feature is added, and I typically come back through these issue pages and post a note here too.\n. Yes, it is actually in there, although I don't think it works as well as hoped.  You can enable it in code:\nCardboard.SDK.ElectronicDisplayStabilization = true;\nAlso, you need to set the distortion method to \"Native\" because the Unity method doesn't support it.\nAs for why I'm down on it, I think it increases the jitter you see rather than decreasing it whenever you hold the Cardboard in your hand.  If you use a headstrap, it may work better (but I haven't tried).\n. That's what you used to be using in the prior release, so there won't be any change relative to that.  The new Unity distortion method should help performance a bit, plus you can use Metal on iOS.\n. If I read you right, you get 50-60 fps in the default (old) Cardboard, but 25 fps in the Cardboard v2?  Is your scene very complex / active?  The new viewer has a wider FOV, so it will have to render more stuff (twice -- once per eye).  Less stuff gets culled out by the frustum which could lower your frame rate, although a 50% drop still seems excessive.\n. This may be worth trying with the new v0.5.2 release.  You can try the new in-Unity distortion method.  Also, you can downscale the RenderTexture size using the slider on the Cardboard component.  Another switch you might try is to use the VertexLit rendering path.\n. The new v0.5.2 release has a different sensor fusion algorithm from before.  It should work on a wider variety of phones.  \nI actually saw this app (and the author's thesis) last year and showed it to coworkers.  It could be integrated into the SDK if someone wrote their own derivation of BaseVRDevice.cs to use it (perhaps as a native code plugin).  I don't know enough to say if it would work better than the current algorithm.\n. Can you enabled the Development Build in the Build Settings dialog?  That will give more of a stack trace when the SIGSEGV happens.\n. Can you post a screenshot?\n. Is it cut off on the right side like that on your screen, or is that just the screenshot?\nAlso, the function that determines the screen size is in BaseCardboardDevice.cs, called Init().  It passes several numbers like Screen.width, Screen.dpi, etc, into the native Start() function.  Could you log those numbers and post them here?\n(In the 0.4.10 SDK, screen resolution and size were determined by Java code, which used a different method.)\n. I'm looking for an LG G4 to try this out on.  If I find one, I'll see what is going on.\nAbout the scene going black on level load, there were some bugs in the old SDK depending on how you used the Cardboard scripts in the various levels.  So yes, this definitely needs to get fixed :)\n. Unable to reproduce the problem so far on an LG G4 in house.  Seems to work fine with the latest release, and either Unity 4 or Unity 5.\n\n. For quality, I just kept the default settings for Android that you get when you start a new project.  Similarly, the default settings on the prefab that you get when you add it to the scene.  I built the apk and gave it to a coworker who has an LG G4 to test, and the above screenshot is the result.\nThis is a strange error, if your screenshot is correct:  I usually see issues where the eyes are too small but centered horizontally, or the eyes are separated too far (but still centered).  Both happen when the phone returns an inaccurate DPI.  Being cut off on the right like your photo shows is a new one.\n. Which Cardboard viewer do you have?  You didn't have any trouble scanning the QR code, right?\n. What version of Unity are you using?  \nI just saw a comment on another thread (issue 81) that different versions of Unity (5.2 vs 5.1.3) are giving different DPI values on the same phone.  From your photo, I'm guessing that the DPI value Unity is returning is too high.\n(BTW, in SDK 0.4.10 and earlier, DPI was retrieved in the Java layer, not through Unity, so this problem would not occur.)\n. Found some code on the Unity forums that should give the same results as the 0.4.10 and earlier SDK would give:\nhttp://forum.unity3d.com/threads/finding-physical-screen-size.203017/#post-1373867\nGive this a try and see if it fixes the problem.\n. Yep, I'm hearing this a lot, and we even reproduced it in house.  I don't know if this is because of a bug in Unity or a policy change.  It's on the bug list to be fixed now for sure.\n. New v0.5.2 release should fix these weird DPI issues which depend on the version of Unity.\n. Thanks for finding that!\n. Should be fixed in the v0.5.2 release.\n. Thanks!  We don't git pull directly into the repo here on Github, but I've found the same code in our internal repo and fixed it there, so this PR is effectively \"pulled\".  It'll be out in an upcoming release.\n. Two questions:\n1)  Does this still happen with v0.5.2?\n2)  If you add a Cardboard script to the non-VR scene, and set its VRModeEnabled property to false in the editor, does that stop the issue?\n. OK, this is turning out to be harder to squash than expected.  Here's another workaround:  In your code that is about to launch a non-VR scene, turn off the UI layer like this:\nCardboard.SDK.EnableSettingsButton = false;\nCardboard.SDK.EnableAlignmentMarker = false;\nCardboard.SDK.BackButtonMode = Cardboard.SDK.BackButtonModes.Off;\n(Use that last line only if you don't want the Back Button in the non-VR scene.)\n. This bug should be fixed in the new v0.6 release of the SDK.\n. I recommend the following steps:\n1)  Add a Cardboard object to your scene.  Just put it on some gameobject.\n2)  In the inspector for the Cardboard component, set VRModeEnabled = off.\n3)  When you add the prefab later, use the one that does not have a Cardboard on it (CardboardHead), or edit your prefab and remove it.  (You don't want two Cardboard scripts in the same scene.)\nSo this way the Cardboard will initialize with VRMode set to off, which removes the settings button and alignment marker.  Later, after you add your prefab, you can flip Cardboard.SDK.VRModeEnabled to true to switch into VR Mode.\n. Yes, there's a property on Cardboard called DefaultDeviceProfile.  You set it to the URI that you would get from using the online profile generator.  This property is not shown in the inspector; you have to edit the script.  \nFor Cardboard V2 , the proper initialization is:\nnew Uri(\"http://google.com/cardboard/cfg?p=CgZHb29nbGUSEkNhcmRib2FyZCBJL08gMjAxNR0J-SA9JQHegj0qEAAAcEIAAHBCAABwQgAAcEJYADUpXA89OghX8as-YrENP1AAYAM\")\nIt will only take affect for users who have not scanned a QR code, because the user's choice takes priority.\n. Also, your line above:\nCardboard.SDK.enabled = true;\nis not how you enable VR mode.  The proper code is:\nCardboard.SDK.VRModeEnabled = true;\nIf the settings button is not appearing, that is a bug.\n. See the instructions here:\nhttps://developers.google.com/cardboard/unity/get-started-ios\nfor steps you have to do to the Xcode project that Unity generates.  This will fix the missing labels.\nThis dialog will normally appear the first time a Cardboard object is instantiated in the scene.  But if you use the default URI, this should be skipped.  And if you really want to make certain that the setup dialog does not appear, edit CardboardiOSDevice.cs OnFocus() method.\n. We have been getting reports that Unity 5.2 is returning different DPI values than Unity 5.1 does.  Can you try with Unity 5.1 to see if this is the same problem?\n. Ah, so the change in how DPI is reported started before 5.2, then.  This is going to be fixed in an upcoming SDK release:  we're going to get the DPI directly from Android (or iOS).  Unity's DPI value probably makes sense from a UI layout perspective, but we need the real DPI because we use it to figure out the actual physical screen size.\n. To answer your earlier question, yes we have started seeing this on devices here, after upgrading to recent versions of Unity. \nNo, I'm not allowed to give dates on releases.\n. Yep, this is exactly what we're going to do internally, except we have to also support iOS.\n. It's not actually a good idea to move a camera independently of the StereoController that it belongs to.  The StereoController's camera, and the child stereo cameras form a single unit.  Are you moving all of them, and still losing the controller reference?\n. OK, that's a great find.  I'll fold this fix (or something similar) into an upcoming release.  Note: we don't actually merge pull requests here on Github, because the master source code lives in private repos.  But this PR is still very valuable for anyone else who needs this fix in the current version of the SDK, so thanks!\n. Any useful lines in adb logcat?  If you comment the antialiasing line, is the problem resolved?\n. That seems reasonable since we don't render the texture to a mesh that is flat in Z, and there is no anisotropy.  I just thought that mipMaps are off by default, because I tried turning them on once and my frame rate took a huge dive.\n. If you commented out the line \"rt.antiAliasing = ...\" and it still rendered like in your screenshot, I'm not sure how we know that the problem is with that line?  It might be the RT format is not supported on that phone.  (That's one thing you might see in the adb logcat.)\n. Yes, in the new SDK, we finally correct a problem that has been there for some time, which is that if the RenderTexture has the exact same size as the screen, then the barrel distortion will make the RenderTexture's pixels bigger than screen pixels in the parts of the screen right under the eyes.  This causes fuzziness there.  So the default now is to calculate the size of the RenderTexture so that after barrel distortion, on texture pixel = one screen pixel right under the eyes.  This results in a bigger texture.  But on the other hand, there's now the Stereo Scale slider on Cardboard to give you overall control of the resolution, so you can dial it back if it is too big.\n. It's a bit out of scope for the Cardboard SDK right now, so I don't have any idea when this would happen.  I found a nice rundown here:\nhttps://forums.oculus.com/viewtopic.php?t=18509#p234874\nThat talks about how to get your Bluetooth controller working with Unity and Android, using the Oculus code as a starting point.  If you want to get going on this soon, this is the way to go.\n. Direct Render is on the StereoController.  Definitely give it a shot.  Let me know if it has any effect or not, and we'll go from there.\n. Quick question:  Are you adding an image effect at runtime?  The way the screen is drawing in the 2nd screenshot is usually caused by image effects (or deferred lighting sometimes).  Direct Render is supposed to fix this, but it works by adding a final image effect to the cameras -- it has to be last in the chain.\n. I'll let our sensor people know.  If you set the phone down for about 10 seconds while the app is running, does it stabilize?  (Try it with the phone in the viewer, facing forward -- i.e. don't put the back of the phone on the table.)\n. Our QA gruop in house is unable to repro with the phones in house, but it could be that it shows up worse on some phones (i.e. specific units) than on others.  The new sensor fusion algorithm uses the raw gyro readings, and works the same on Android and on iOS.  I'm not a sensor expert, so I don't know a whole lot more than that, but I will keep feeding back your updates to the team.\n. @justinwasilenko Can you ask your tester if the phone is getting really warm?  I know that makes the gyro drift change, so we should at least collect that data point.  (One of my coworkers took this temperature testing to an extreme: he refrigerated his phone for 20 minutes and then tested drift.  I'm not asking for anyone to do that!)\n. Facepalm.  OK, it looks like I accidentally left in the line of code to disable the gyro drift correction for iOS from the old library, which didn't use our drift correction on iOS (it was tuned for Android only then):\npublic override void Init() {\n    isOpenGL = isOpenGLAPI();\n    setSyncWithCardboardEnabled(Cardboard.SDK.SyncWithCardboardApp);\n    base.Init();\n    // For iOS don't use Drift Correction.\n    SetAutoDriftCorrectionEnabled(false);   //  <--  OOPS, should have been deleted\n}\nCan you try again, after removing this line?\n. OK.  I just got the same feedback from another tester as well, so it's probably not recommended.  Thanks for trying it.\n. The new v0.6 release is out, and iPhone drift should be much improved.\n. As a test, try calling UpdateStereoValues on your StereoController after this change.\n. OK, it was worth a shot.  But I'm not very surprised there's a bug here.  I didn't think of it as a runtime option, so I didn't really test it that way.  But it seems like a worthy use case, so I will try to make it work.\n. You can actually do this now.  Just create all three RTs up front, and when you want to activate one, assign it to Cardboard.SDK.StereoScreen.  It's possible you may run into the bug you found here, but also possible you won't because this bug might have to do with something you'll avoid by pre-creating the textures.\n. Yeah, that's a good feature to have in the SDK, if we can find the right set of scaling steps and thresholds that work for most apps on most phones.  It'll take some experimentation so I can't say for sure when such a feature would land.\n. Quick update:  Although we didn't have a chance to add scaling or steps, the new v0.6 SDK doesn't have the performance issue of v0.5.2, which overcompensated for barrel distortion by making a bigger render texture (too big).\n. On your Main Camera, set the Clear Flags to solid color, and in the Background Color, set alpha to 255.  Does that help?  Let me know either way.\n. OK, I'll go back through my notes tonight -- that flags thing was the first thing that leapt to mind -- but I did manage to achieve this effect once and then fix it.  If you can, would you be willing to send me a DropBox link to this mini-project?\n. Got sidetracked last week with other issues.  Will take a look ASAP.\n. OK, reproduced and figured out the problem.  You can work around it for now by calling UpdateStereoValues() on the main StereoController class right after you enabled VR Mode, like so:\nCardboard.Controller.UpdateStereoValues()\nThe problem is that the stereo cameras' targetTexture is not updated to point to the newly created RenderTexture.  Definitely a bug.\n. @pjohnsonbue I suspect you're problem is related but not quite the same as @Oshroth (at least the gyro part).  If you get a chance to try 0.5.2 again, can you see if there's anything in your adb logcat?\n. Make sure to turn off Direct Render on the StereoController.\nIs this effect added to the cameras in the editor or by script?\n. OK.  The Direct Render option is there because many image effects cause the original problem that you saw: one eye is spread over the whole screen.  But it works by adding a \"final\" image effect to each eye which ensures that the output goes only to the correct half of the screen.  \nSince you are adding your effect by script, it is probably coming after this \"final\" effect, which causes the artifacts you see when you turn off Direct Render.  \nAs a test, could you add your effect to the eyes in the editor rather than by script, and turn off Direct Render?  Does this help?\n(The method for fixing the problems with image effects changed in 0.5.2, which is why you are setting this happen.  The previous release used a different method, but it was much slower.)\n. This should be fixed in v0.6 of the SDK.  (Make sure you add a StereoController to the existing camera in addition to the CardboardAdapter as a child.)\n. Just checked this with the current build.  I'm not seeing this behavior.  When the neck model scale is 0, the CardboardHead's position stays at 0,0,0 for me.\n. Does this happen with the demo scene (the red floating cube)?  There is a button on the floor that changes VRModeEnabled.  Please try this scene because I test this behavior with it and have never seen the problem you report.  Can you also say which Distortion Correction mode you are using and if you are changing it?\n. Is the common element from loading a new scene or starting with VR mode disabled?  And so far, not recreatable with the demo scene?  \nCould anyone make a stripped down test case that shows the problem and share it here?  I will definitely take a look.\nPossible workaround:  There is a function on the VRDevice class called OnPause(bool).  Normally it is only called by Cardboard from OnApplicationPause().  The workaround is to edit the Cardboard script and call OnPause() twice, first with true, then with false, right after you switch VR mode on.  Let me know if you try it and whether that has any effect, positive or negative.\n. It will definitely be fixed in an SDK update.  In the meantime, this sounds like the workaround to use.\n. This bug ought to be fixed in the new v0.6 release of the SDK.  There was a bug that was not updating the stereo cameras' TargetTexture property. \n. The symptom of not tracking the head can arise if you accidentally have more than one Cardboard component in the scene.  They stomp on each other and you get no head tracking.  Look for the error message \"There must be only one Cardboard object in a scene.\" in the logs.\n. Which version of the SDK is it?  We stopped auto-generating the Cardboard component in v0.6.  \nAlso, the CardboardHead prefab doesn't contain a Cardboard.cs script.  That script lives on the CardboardMain prefab, or in the latest SDK also on the CardboardManager prefab.\n. Oh right, my mistake.  There is one spot in the code that will still autogenerate a Cardboard.cs component, and that is in StereoController, which is in the CardboardHead prefab.  So that's expected.  The issue on the phone, not head tracking, is something else.  Any errors in your Xcode console? \n. Hmm.  Ok, this is interesting.  I guess the first thing to do is clear the decks and start with a sanity check.  Try following the procedure here:  https://developers.google.com/cardboard/unity/get-started-ios\nDo this on a fresh new project.  And if you still get no head tracking out of that, could you zip the whole Unity project and share it?  We have locally done this test and don't see this problem, so the problem is to figure out what is different in your setup vs ours.\n. Is this problem only happening in the Remote?  That's not officially supported, but there's a variable in Cardboard.cs called UseUnityRemoteInput that needs to be set to true.  It's a very poor VR experience, and I've never tried it on iOS.  If you actually build and deploy the app to the phone, do you get head tracking?\n. This looks like the head orientation is being continuously reset to the starting direction.\n. Doed it look the same as handyface's sample video, where it looks like the head tracking is resetting to zero frequently?\n. That's a bug:  The Esc key used to be matched up with Cardboard.SDK.Tilted, but is now supposed to be matched up with Cardboard.SDK.BackButtonPressed.  Looks like the old mapping didn't get deleted.\n. Ah, OK.  It's supposed to tell you to install Cardboard (and not crash).  This must be a regression because I'm pretty sure it worked in the prior SDK.\n. Well, v0.6 of the SDK, and for better or worse we are deprecating the Sync with Cardboard option.  It has not proven robust and workable, for this reason and others.  For the time being, each app will have an independent viewer setting on iOS.\n. This is a new report -- haven't seen a crash like this before.  Can you mine your 48 reports for anything consistent that might be new (iOS 9.1?  Recent build of your app?  etc) that might help narrow it down?\n. From the stack trace it looks like the app is exiting in this instance.  Is that true in general?\n. That crash is happening in the destructor for CardboardApiImpl, down in the memory allocation layer.  This object is a singleton, so it does not normally get destructed unless the app is exiting.\n. This looks vaguely similar:  http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/961173/some-crashes-on-unity-464-for-ios.html\n\"It's quite strange, because to it seems to happen once the app is killed from background by OS due to memory pressure.\"\nI'm sure the exact crash cause is different, but if the general situation is the same (not handling a background kill properly), that could narrow down the issue.\nAlso, here's another vaguely similar crash report, also from backgrounding the app:\nhttps://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/12977\nAlso this:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/33091466/nsnotificationcenter-causing-crash-trying-to-call-appwillterminate\nThe above two say something about a still-subscribed notification handler.  If this behavior pattern matches your case, then it gives a clue what to look for -- there is iOS-specific code in the native Cardboard SDK layer.\n. Quick question:  Do the other reported crashes look similar?  Is it always in the CardboardApiImpl destructor?\n. The turnaround to get a fixed version isn't going to be super quick -- we don't even have a root cause yet, and I have no repro in house to trace.  So in the meantime, I'll try to help you narrow it down, and hopefully work around it.\nSo:  When are you calling Destroy() on the Cardboard instance?  (Is it the CardboardMain prefab?)  Is it necessary to Destroy(), or can you get by with setting VRModeEnabled = false and then deactivating the prefab?  (I'm fishing for context here.)\n. Definitely it should not freeze or crash on Destroy -- just trying to narrow down the root cause and also hopefully find a workaround for you till the SDK can be fixed.\n. Would you be able to try this with the new v0.6 SDK?  We did find at least one crash related to the destruction of the CardboardApiImpl, if  the phone had been tilted on the side, triggering a \"Tilt\" event.  That event has been disabled.\n. Possible workaround is to include a Cardboard in the non-VR scene, but have its VRModeEnabled = false.  If you try that, please let me know if it has any effect.\n. Anyone using Cardboard.SDK.OnTrigger += [blah]?  Remember to -= that handler in OnDestroy(), or else the OnTrigger event is pointing to recycled memory.  That will cause a crash for sure.  Same for the other static events (OnTilt, etc).\n. Another lead has been found, which may apply:  Are you using LoadLevelAsync?  That may have a race condition with the static instance of Cardboard.  Can you try using LoadLevel (in house -- just see if it makes the crash go away)?\n. We've fixed a bug relating to crashes on LoadLevel or Quit in the latest v0.6 release.  Can you see if this fixes your crash?  (The particular bug was caused by tilting the phone sideways -- something in the tilt-detector code.)\n. There was a bug related to a certain thread calling from C++ to C#.  The thread watches for magnet and tilt events, but looked like it crashed only for tilt events.  The workaround was to disable reporting tilt events, as a stopgap until we have a different architecture for event reporting.  This is available in v0.6.\n. That message if for when it goes to read the scanned QR code but there isn't one saved yet.  It should have no effect on your playback.\n. It could be the Unity distortion correction.  If you set Distortion Correction to \"Native\" on the Cardboard component, it will go back to using the old method.  Let me know if that makes a difference.\n. For picture#1, make sure the main camera's background color has is fully opaque (alpha is turned all the way up).\nFor the start glitch, try setting the Enable checkboxes for each UI element to false.  Wait till you enable VR mode to turn them on.  This may affect the visibility bug you sometimes see.\nI'm not sure that will fix ask the pause/resume issues.  For those, cash you see anything in the adb logcat?\n. The SDK definitely needs an update -- there are several bugs already on the list of what needs to be fixed, including the start glitch.  I'm not allowed to say anything about when new releases are scheduled though :(\n. We can still try to find a workaround for you with the current SDK too.  Also, I typically come back through these issue posts and say when a new release is available if it has a fix for that issue.\n. OK, sorry for the long absence from this thread.  @HansBernd The GL rendering code in CardboardPostRender.cs is only for when you run the game in the editor.  \nThe \"start glitch\" is due to the native Java code that creates the UI elements.  It has their visibility set initially to \"on\", and only after that does the Cardboard SDK get a chance to turn them off.  So you can see a flicker.  As we see, this is a hard problem to work around from the Unity level.\n. Yes, changing the Java code would work.  (I counted Java as \"native\" code because of the need to marshal calls from .NET)\n. Definitely updates are coming.  We just aren't allowed to give exact dates, I guess because it's better to not make a promise than to make one and have to break it :(\n. The Application.LoadLevel() function causes the current Cardboard object to get destroyed.  I'm guessing that process races with your code's return from the event callback.  \nTo see if that is so, try writing your code not as an event handler, but as a simple if-statement in an Update function:\nvoid Update() {\n    if (Cardboard.SDK.Tilted)\n        Application.LoadLevel(\"foo\");\n}\n. Could you share that test project here by a Drive or Dropbox link?\n. Reproduced.  Found the following message in the logcat:\nW Unity   : Cardboard SDK object should be a singleton.\nThat indicates that two Cardboards exist somehow in the second scene.  That's a definite no-no (imposed by the native code layer).  Removing the 2nd copy of the Cardboard script in scene2 makes the crash go away.  (Side note:  I just checked the web site, and this singleton issue doesn't seem to be called out.  I thought it was.)\n. Change the line\nif (Cardboard.SDK.Tilted) ...\nTo\nif (Cardboard.SDK.Tilted || Input.GetKeyUp(KeyCode.P)) ...\nNow play the first scene in the editor and hit the 'P' key to simulate a tilt.  (You can use some other KeyCode if you want...)\nI did that yesterday and saw that same warning message about singletons in the Unity console.  That's when I noticed the 2nd game object with its own Cardboard script that was in scene2.  \nTry this too, and see if you also still get that warning.\n. Yeah, the crash is happening down in the native code layer.  Not much you can do in C# with the current release.  It is going to be fixed in the next release.  Same with the other problem where a Cardboard is instantiated.  (This comes from the editor script for Cardboard referencing \"Cardboard.SDK\" on one line rather than \"cardboard\".)\n. New v0.6 release of the SDK fixes tilt crash.  Unfortunately, it was more of a bypass, in that we had to disable the tilt detection in the native library altogether.  This means that Tilted and OnTilt are orphans at the moment -- they will not report anything.  A similar detection can be built in C# using Input.accel or Unity's DeviceOrientation support.\n. Turn off TapIsTrigger in the Cardboard component properties.\n. Definitely appreciate your feedback.  We prioritize SDK development based on developer demand, so it's very useful to hear that developers are eager for Cardboard support in Unreal.\n. So far we are unable to reproduce with LG G3.  Question:  Does this happen for apps downloaded from the Play Store too?\n. OK, I'll ask our QA team to try AirPano on their LG G3.  Thanks for the tip, it's very helpful!\n. So with AirPano on our in-house LG G3 we do see a weird gyro effect:  if you tilt the phone sideways and then back, the world has tilted about 20 degrees up or down.  This only happens a few times then stops.  Is this similar to way you are seeing?\n. We've made progress in tracking this down, though unfortunately I don't think it is fixed in the latest release, v0.6, yet.  For some reason on the LG G3 phone, the sensor time stamps can jump a lot for the gyro.  Too big a jump apparently causes the head tracking code to reset the orientation.  So that's under investigation.\n. LG G3 seems especially prone to this issue, but I don't know for sure if it is the only phone that it happens to.\n. A couple of questions:  This only happens on some tablets?  Is it black screen from launch or only after a certain point in the game?\n. I think we have an S3 in the office.  I'll download the game and try it out.\n. Wow, there's a lot of stuff going on in that review.  I'll take it bit by bit...\nDoes your app allow landscape right orientation?  That will cause the upside-down symptom?  (There may be other causes too.)\nThe 80% zoom could be due to several factors combining:  1) The change in FOV from mono to whatever profile they had (sounds customized), 2) the phone reporting a wrong DPI.  I don't have one of these phones at hand, so I can't say if that is an issue.  We are trying to resolve the issue of phone DPI inaccuracy in general since we depend on it to compute the screen size, but it is a tough nut to crack.\n. I can try recreating the user's profile for one thing.  The upside down problem normally happens if you leave on landscape right as an option and they put the phone in the viewer that way too.  (Bug in the SDK.). But there could be other causes.  I've not heard of the user's phone, so I don't know what chipset it has.  Could be an issue there.  If that turns out to be the case, you may want to blacklist that phone till we can figure out what the compatibility issues are (or Unity does).\n. This should be fixed in the new v0.6 release of the SDK.  There was an exception getting thrown which prevented the eye camera's TargetTexture from getting set.\n. If you can explain how to spot it in the DemoScene, I'll look for it and try to fix it.  Did you change anything in that scene?\n. Ah OK.  This problem is likely specific to Android, in fact just older Android (pre-4.4).  Before then, there was no Immersive Mode, so we have to fake it.  There could well be a bug in that code.\n. We found the bug, but it has not been fixed yet in the new release (we were past the deadline for new code).  It is part of the code that fakes immersive mode in older Android versions.\n. It's not fixable in the current release unless you are up for decompiling a .jar and hacking on the java code.\n. Closing this bug, since we dropped support for pre-KitKat versions of Android, so we don't fake immersive mode anymore.  And TapIsTrigger has also been removed.\n. Turns out there's a bug in CardboardEye.cs that is getting a null-pointer dereference in this case.  This will be fixed in an upcoming SDK release, but you can make the following change in your code to fix it right now:  In CardboardEye.CopyCameraAndMakeSideBySide(), move the \"var monoCamera = ...\" line out of the \"#if UNITY_5/#endif\" block.\n. In StereoController.CreateEye(), change\n...transform.parent = ...\nTo\n...SetParent(..., false)\nThis bug was lurking behind the other bug, so it came to light when the first was fixed.\n. TrackPosition is there because at some point in the future the Cardboard SDK will be used on a device like Tango that supports full position and orientation tracking.  On current phones, there is no positional tracking sensor, so the setting has no operational effect.\n. The most likely cause is referring to \"Cardboard.SDK\" after the Cardboard object has been destroyed.  This can happen when unregistering the OnTilt event handler, for instance.  This is a definite bug that will be fixed in an upcoming release.  If this sounds like what is happening to you, avoid using the guilty Cardboard events for now.  If it is not the cause, then... more investigation is needed.  Is it easy to make a test case?\n. Reproduced.  Interestingly you have to tilt the phone to the right.  This means it is not just an orientation change, but something to do with the OnTilt gesture specifically.\n. Yes, the update is that the problem is down in the native code that monitors the sensors.  It has to be fixed there for an upcoming release.  It is being worked on.\n. v0.6 is out, and fixes the problem -- or rather, bypasses it.  The downside is that we had to stop reporting the \"tilt\" event.  If you are using Cardboard.SDK.Tilted or OnTilt, they will no longer report anything.  If you need this functionality, you can use Input.accel to implement it in C#.\n. Sure looks like a memory corruption from somewhere in the native code.  The first time I got it to crash, Mono was doing a GC while trying to resize a string.  The second time Mono was doing a GC while trying to allocate a new array.\nRe: your workaround.  Does reenabling Cardboard in the new level work?\n. Have a test for you.  The script BaseCardboardDevice has a function:\npublic override void OnPause(bool pause) { ... }\nComment out that entire function, so that it no longer overrides the base class function.  Are you still able to make the app crash?\n(Side note:  Your ChangeSceneScript is calling LoadLevel when the application is being paused, not resumed.  Not sure that's a good idea in general.  But I got my crashes with just the DemoScene.)\n. For OnePlus One, the first thing we tell people is to change to phone's DPI from the factory default (and incorrect) value of 480 to the correct value if 401.  That practically always solves this issue.\n. It will not cause any problem (as long as you use the default Distortion Correction Method of \"Unity\").\n. Does this happen for any scene?  We tried the demo scene with the same combination of hardware and software and did not see this result.  \nAre you using any rendering features that are not in the demo scene?  (Light maps, image effects, etc.)\n. Just release v0.6 of the SDK.  I've never seen this issue before myself, so can you try to replicate using the new release?\n. Correct me if I'm wrong but so far everyone is seeing this only on Galaxy S6?\n@monizka The problem appears to be pixel garbage in the distortion texture.  Makes sense you don't see it when distortion is set to None, since the distortion texture is not used in that case.\nCan you try what @foundway did, removing the call to .Create() on the texture?  Does that fix it for you too?\n. There's another call to .Create over in Cardboard.cs, so make sure to remove that one too.\n. There is a Cardboard Codelab that shows how one could implement this:\nhttps://io2015codelabs.appspot.com/codelabs/cardboard-unity#5\n. It is definitely being addressed for an upcoming release.  As a workaround, try including this code in a C++ file:\n```\ninclude \nnamespace gvr {\n    class VrApp;\n    VrApp* CreateMainApp__EXPECTED_EXACTLY_ONE_VR_MAIN_APP_STATEMENT__(const std::vector&) { return nullptr; }\n}\n```\n. This should also be fixed in the new v0.6 release -- we pretty much did exactly the same thing in the native code.\n. You can edit Cardboard.cs and set the DefaultDeviceProfile variable.  (Sorry, no editor UI for this.)  This acts exactly the way you spelled out.\n. Definitely there are bugs related to alignment marker and settings button that we are fixing.  But the SDK does not activate unless the Cardboard.cs script's Awake() function gets called, so the key is to prevent that from occurring.  The tricky part is that any script referring to \"Cardboard.SDK\" will cause a Cardboard to get instantiated if one is not already awake in the scene (this will change in a future release), so you have to avoid that too.  Probably the sanest way is to instantiate the Cardboard setup at runtime from script, which you can then guard by preprocessor directive or even a simple property check on a \"VR Manager\" script of some kind.  Rather than using the prefabs, try just adding StereoController to your Main Camera in code, if the app is supposed to be running in Cardboard mode.  (It was set up to be used this way.)\n. We're having to do another hotfix, which has held up the doc updates, but in v0.6 we changed Cardboard.SDK to just log an error if it is null, rather than trying to activate automatically.  There were weird bugs happening at shutdown or level load, sometimes even at startup, where two Cardboards would get created instead of one.  The new way to handle this is to call the \"Cardboard.Create()\" static function just before you add a StereoController to the camera, and it will instantiate for you.  It is OK if Create() is called more than once, only the first time will it do anything.\n. For now, we've had to disable the auto-launching of the onboarding altogether.  The functions to launch it and set it as \"done\" still exist in CardboardiOSDevice.cs, if you want to use it.\n. You should extend GoogleUnityActivity, at least for now.  It is basically an altered version of UnityPlayerActivity that has hooks for the UnityVrActivityListener class.  This class holds the Cardboard UI layer, and it should only intercept events like pressing on the VR Back Button, the Gear Button, etc.  It does also catch screen touches and report them to Unity differently from usual, but you can disable that by clearing \"TapIsTrigger\" on the Cardboard.cs object.\n. That bug is from the native layer, but should be fixed in the next release (coming soon).\n. At the moment, there's no friendly way to do this, but it can be (and has been) done.  Decompile unityvractivity.jar and get the code for GoogleUnityActivity.  Incorporate it with the other plugin's activity, either as a base, or as an extension, or even just copy in the implementation.\n. I'll check with QA but I'm pretty sure they tested this scenario on an S6.  Thanks for the stack trace!  It will be helpful.  Do you have NFC enabled or disabled on your phone?\n. Can you try a quick experiment?  Remove the CardboardAudioListener from the Cardboard Main prefab.  Does the crash still happen?\n. OK, we've narrowed down this crash (your Problem 1) to the audio system in Unity 5.2+, which has a bug in it that causes exactly this problem.  See:\nhttp://forum.unity3d.com/threads/crash-within-unity-5-1-2p3-for-2-5-of-our-android-users.377839/ \nfor a similar report.  Removing or disabling the CardboardAudioListener will prevent the crash.\n. Updated the SDK to disable the audio component in the prefabs.  That fixes the crash in your scenes from using the new prefab.\nPlease note that the demo scene still has the component enabled so that it can be used to learn how to use spatialized audio, and what it sounds like in headphones.\n. BTW @noemis84 Thank you very much for reporting this so fast.  It was very helpful in getting the fix out ASAP.\nAbout Problem 2:  I actually am not sure it is safe to quit the app during pause like that.  Or at least, not with the sensor logic we are using in the SDK. \n. Definitely try the new 0.6 release.  It should have a fix for this.\n. Hi @Enumio, which version of the Cardboard SDK are you using?\n. OK.  Note: If you get a crash on resuming the app from the task mgr, we're working on that now.  You can fix by disabling CardboardAudioListener on the Main Camera.\n. OK, we've updated the SDK to disable the spatial audio in the prefabs for now, until the bug in Unity is fixed which causes the crash.\n. OK, I'll close the issue.\n. Potentially the same issue as #137, due to audio spatializer bug in Unity 5.2+.\n. This could  happen depending on the phone model and configured viewer that you are using.  Can you reply with that information?\n. On my Nexus5x using v0.6, I get this:\n\nDo you get the black space on your phone or just in the editor?  \nThe editor makes sense because it is rendering for a given phone aspect ratio into the game window which might not be that shape.  Currently, the image hugs the bottom edge of the game window, leaving extra space on top.\nOn your phone, you will sometimes see extra black around the edges of the images if you are using a Cardboard v1 (the original kind), because the eye viewports do not fill the screen.  But even there, the black is on all 4 sides.\n. Currently the SDK only properly supports Landscape Left orientation.  This is an issue being worked on, but for now it is necessary for Unity to think the orientation is Landscape Left at the time that you instantiate the Cardboard component.  You can do this in code by assigning to Screen.orientation.\n. With 0.6 is it crashing while moving the phone, or on LoadLevel/Quit?\n. I tried reproducing this with my Nexus 5x, and couldn't get a crash to happen.  (I did almost fling it across the room though. -- maybe I have to move it differently?) You said it happens on your Samsung S5.  Do you know any other models it happens on from the bug reports?  I can ask the QA team to try -- they have many more models in their stock.\n. When you upgraded to 0.6, did you delete the old Cardboard and Plugins directories under Assets first?  I suggest trying that if possible.\n. OK, I'm going to close the issue, but we can open it again if the problem crops up again.\n. Yep, it's a current limitation of the SDK that it requires Landscape Left orientation to be in effect when Cardboard is instantiated and active (not just for the picture, but also for the gyro readings).  You can change it in code by assigning to Screen.orientation, I believe.\n. @brianchasalow So if you need to start the app in portrait mode, the Cardboard component has to not exist at that point in time.  That means not adding the CardboardMain prefab or Cardboard scripts to the scene in the editor.  It all has to be done in code, like @nosmirck wrote above.  Basically, as @ybeaulieu said, make sure the screen is set to LandscapeLeft before Cardboard.Awake() is called.  If you need to debug, add a Debug.Log to Cardboard.Awake(), as well as the point in code where you set the orientation, and see which is happening first in your logs.\n. For iOS, go into Player Settings and set the Default Orientation to Auto rather than Landscape Left.  In Allowed Orientations, remove all entries except for Landscape Left.  And continue to use @nosmirck's workaround above.  Let me know if this helps or not.\n. I don't believe this has been addressed yet.\n. Duplicate of #120.\n. Changing the stereo level will only take effect when UpdateStereoValues() is called.  This is for performance.  If you want to test it, turn on \"Keep Stereo Updated\" on the StereoController.\n. Interesting!  I did this in v0.6, and saw what you saw on the bottom (cubes moving inwards) -- in the editor.  I just had to enable Keep Stereo Updated on the StereoController.  Are you seeing the problem on the phone, in the editor, or both?\n. OK, good to hear.  The SDK is withing as intended here.  For performance, jyou can ust call UpdateSteteoValues from code when you know you need to, or equivalently, leave KeepStereoValues disabled when you are not changing values on the main camera.\n. Yes, this is the bug in Unity 5.2/3 that affects mobile.  We are trying to find a workaround, but hopefully Unity will have a fix pretty soon.\n. I just double-checked with the demo scene that comes with the SDK.  Even though the spatial audio is working just fine in the app, I still see the same error in the logcat:\n01-24 22:21:50.651 16149 16174 E Unity   : Unable to find libaudiopluginvrunity\nI think the \"Missing DT_SONAME\" warning that @sprengundsonntag mentioned may be related to this message.  I am seeing that too.  Oddly, I am not seeing the part that says \"native render plugin support disabled\", so I don't know what's up there.\nBut anyway, since the audio is working in the app despite this message, I think it may possibly be a red herring for the crash caused by magnet/LoadLevel.  That crash may be related to the similar crash we had with tilt/LoadLevel (or Quit) in the prior release. \n@sprengundsonntag Can you temporarily disable all CardboardAudio scripts in your scene and see if the magnet/LoadLevel bug still exists?  (If you really want to be sure, delete the components completely.)\n. Please say if the trigger crash is fixed for you -- we reworked how the events come up from native code so that it all runs on a single thread now.\n. Can you say which version of Unity, which version of Cardboard SDK, and what your phone model is?  Does this happen with the demo scene too?  Can you capture a screen shot (Volume + Volume Down) and post it?\n. I'm very interested in getting feedback on how the gyro tracking is working, so I have something specific to take to our sensor team.  Is it too jittery, too laggy, drift too much?  Any other details?  Thanks!\n. Are you using Metal or OpenGL?  We have another weird rendering bug reported here on Github I think, which is also Metal-specific.  Interesting point about the 6S+ vs 6S, which I can check on the other bug too.  Also, any idea what version of iOS they are running?\n. For any iPhone 6 family device, Auto implies Metal, yes.  We don't have a recommended graphics API for Cardboard on ios, you ought to be able to use either based on your own needs. \n. From your original screenshots, I see a few things poking out around the outside edges of the eyes (mostly on the left side).  Do you have a non-VR screen with a white background?  It looks like the PreRender camera is not clearing the whole frame.  Just to check:  Make sure the PreRender camera has a black solid color background, and try setting it to (0,0,0,1), opaque black.  (If you updated this project to 0.5.2 from an older SDK, the PreRender camera might not have the right settings, perhaps.)\n. We just tried to repro with the SDK + demo in a new project on an x86 device and it ran OK.  We must be missing a factor that is affecting you.  Would you be able to share your fresh SDK + demo scene project that shows the problem?  \nAlso, can you say which phone and version of Android you are using?\n. @liyonghelpme  Which version of the SDK are you using?\n. To tell the SDK to keep the stereo cameras updated from the main camera during animation, set StereoController.keepStereoUpdated = true.  If it is resetting the position of the camera to (0,0,0), clear the TrackPosition flag on CardboardHead.\n. Can you post a screenshot from the 0.5.2 SDK for comparison?  Just from looking at this screenshot, it seems reasonable because of how small the ipod's screen is.  Our QA team tried this and viewed it in a Cardboard, and it looked OK.  \nAlso, what Cardboard viewer are you using?\n. The v0.6 pic looks very much like a V2 Cardboard profile.  (See how the warping is stronger and the eye images touch the center line.  V1 did not do that due to different lenses.)  If you have a V1 Cardboard, you need to set it up by scanning the QR code, and if that doesn't fix it, then the bug is that we're not picking up V1 QR codes properly (the originals had a different format URL than later V2 cardboard), which would be the actual bug here.  You can also test this in the editor by selecting CardboardMain and setting the simulation parameters for the Game window when you hit Play.\n. I should mention:  on iOS the QR code setting is not shared across all apps like it is on Android.  Try scanning the code with this very app.\n. There is a new reticle script that replaces it.  See the demo package for an example.\n. The tracking is a bit sensitive right now to hand jitter, which gets worse when you hold the phone away from your head.  For non VR, you could work around this with a bit of smoothing.  This would be done by modifying CardboardHead.cs to use Quaternion.Slerp() in the rotation update, with a multiple of Time.deltaTime as the interpolation factor.\nStrong caution: don't be eager to apply in VR mode.  It increases perceived lag by a factor that depends on the user's phone performance (or lack of), which leads straight to nausea for an unknown percentage of your users.  Check if Cardboard.SDK.VRModeEnabled is false before using smoothing.\n(We are still working on improving the overall tracking quality across all the phones in the market, with all the varying performance and gyro quality levels out there.  Not easy, unfortunately.)\n. Hmm.  Good point.  The distance function should not necessarily be tied to the is-clickable function.  I can get back to you with a workaround.\n. Looks like the dialog is working but no camera image is coming through.  Is it possible they accidentally hit the wrong button when iOS asked for permission to use the camera?\n. Do you know what viewer the crashes happen with?  Particularly, are they v1 Cardboards (or others) that have the magnet trigger?\n. Can you do this with the standard demo scene (the red cube)?  Or is it another project?\n. @asarior Do you know which phones?  Galaxy S6?\nHere's a test:  See if the crash is related to tilting the phone to the right (as in Cardboard App, which is used to go back to the main menu).  If you keep the phone firmly in landscape, looking forward, is it still possible to cause the crash?\n. I'll ask our QA team to reproduce if they can.  Is Sony Xperia z3 the only phone you have seen this happen on?\n. The QA team does have an Xperia z3, so we can try to reproduce the error.  Can you say which version of Android it runs, and which apps you experience the reset with?  If you are building the apps, which version of Unity is it, and do you see the issue with the SDK's demo scene?\n. Oh yes, please send a video.\n. I see it.  So it looks like it continues to reset itself after the headphones are put in?\n. We've tried running your app on the Sony Xperia z3 (Android 5.1.1), and cannot reproduce the problem when plugging in headphones.  Do you have any other apps or processes running that might steal CPU time because of the headphones?\n. Could you add some details about your hardware (phone, Cardboard viewer)?  One problem that shows up on some phones is that they report an inaccurate dots per inch, which throws off the calculation of screen size, and you get double vision.  There are other reasons this could be happening too, but we can start there.\n. That looks like a V1 Cardboard.  Scanning the QR code worked OK, right?\n. There's a variable in Cardboard.cs called DefaultDeviceProfile.  You normally just set it the expanded URI that the QR code refers to.  (It only has an effect if you have not manually scanned a QR code.)  For an original model cardboard, try setting it to \"http://g.co/cardboard\".\n. This bug was fixed in the v0.7 release of the SDK.\n. This can happen on phones that mis-report the dots-per-inch.  What model phone is it?\n. Are you using a V1 Cardboard (with magnet)?  That causes a crash on loadlevel due to a threading issue.  There is a separate bug on this site about that.  Fix is coming.\n. Are you trying to exit the app because of a back button press, and the crash is happening there?\n. Oh, I see.  There is a function on our Activity listener Java class called \"finishActivityAndReturn\" that might help with this situation.  You would call it rather than calling Application.Quit().  Look in the script CardboardAndroidDevice.cs to see how to call functions on the activity listener.\n. No, it's a bug.  We just have to figure out where.  Are you using Metal or OpenGL?  Do you have Direct Render on or off?\n. We have spotted a bug with Unity + Metal + Direct Render = off that is vaguely similar sounding.  We don't know if the issue is ours, Unity's, or Metal's.  Is there a way you test setting the Graphics API to OpenGL?\n. Setting NativeUILayerSupported to false causes the divider line to be drawn in Unity using GL calls.  It's chief function is for debugging, and also it draws the line when you play in the Unity editor.\nIf you start a fresh project with the latest SDK, do you get the native UI divider line?  If so, then the issue might be due to the upgrading.  My suggestion to fix that would be to (per the website's upgrade instructions) delete the Cardboard and Plugins directories, and then import the latest SDK.  \nSuggestion: make sure you have a backup, or a clean checkin to source control first.  Also, don't have a Cardboard scene open in the editor when you do this.\n. The order Unity compiles scripts in means you can't call from JavaScript to C#.  A workaround is to move C# scripts into the \"Standard Assets\" directory (which normally gets created when you import Unity assets like skyboxes, image effects, etc).  C# scripts in there are compiled early.\n. Are you using GazeInputModule, like in the demo scene?  It should be able to set a uGUI Slider if its Canvas is set to World Space render mode.\n. You could edit GazeInputModule's Process command to keep track of how long the current object has been started at, and if it exceeds a threshold, call the HandleTrigger() function.\n. How far away is it from the camera?  If it is too close, it will get clipped by the near plane.\n. Does this same issue appear in the demo scene included with the SDK, particularly the buttons down on the floor?\n. It looks like the answer has been found:\nhttp://forum.unity3d.com/threads/world-canvas-not-displaying-on-cardboard.396425/\n. There should be some .bundles in Assets/Plugins/iOS which can't from importing the latest SDK.  Did you update your project from an earlier version? \n. OK, so the actual error appears to be this:\n2016-04-14 15:46:11.748 MyiOSApp[1221:929504] +[GOOTypography robotoMediumWithSize:]: unrecognized selector sent to class 0x1c55050\nI'll ask one of the iOS engineers on the team about this.\n. Can you double check that the -ObjC flag is enabled in the Xcode project's \"Other Linker Flags\"?  The Cardboard plugin is supposed to add that automatically, but something might have prevented it.\n. It's coming from the GCSOverlayViewController class, which is set up during the call to createUiLayer() in CardboardAppController.mm (in Plugins/iOS).  It does that to prevent screen dimming when you enclose the phone inside a Cardboard viewer.\n. Sorry, I meant auto screen brightness adjustment.\n. @toykeinc The showstopper is the screen dimming and then turning off?  The initial issue reported here is different: the screen brightness is going to 100%.  If the screen is locking on you despite the Screen.sleepTimeout setting in Cardboard.cs, then that seems like a different bug.  If so, can you create a separate issue for that?\n. In our latest SDK, the brightness in VR Mode is held at the level it was at when VR Mode got enabled.\n. Where did you try \"[UIApplication sharedApplication].idleTimerDisabled = YES;\"?\n. v0.7 has a motion-detection based idle timer.  The normal idle timer is disabled when the phone is moving but enabled when it is still, so the battery won't drain so fast if you set the phone down.  It sounds like the motion threshold is too eager to enable the idle timer.  I will try to find where you can add code to get around this.\n. There is a class called GCSIdleManagementHelper, which is used by GCSOverlayViewController, but I don't think it is public.\n. The Unity SDK has a different manifest than the Java one, and it has targetSDK = 19.  Has there been a problem with READ_PHONE_STATE permission in the Unity SDK?\n. Look in BaseVRDevice.cs, at the bottom.  For your case, you might get it to work by making that code choose the UnityEditorDevice for Windows and OSX platforms.\n. I did some testing with just using a simple two-camera setup, one pointed at a uGUI Canvas, and rendering to a target RenderTexture, which is then applied to a Plane object. The second camera is pointed at the Plane.  The canvas is not showing up in the RenderTexture at all, which seems to be the root cause of the issue.\nWe use this \"render to RenderTexture, display it on a mesh\" technique to do distortion correction, so that's why you see the issue.  There must be a regression in Unity, or perhaps there are changes to how we have to render to a texture in order for uGUI to work.  I don't see any hints about this in their release notes, so it might be a Unity bug.\n. You can also get the issue to not happen by setting Distortion to None.  In either case, Cardboard is not in the render path, so this problem does not surface.\n. The Tango dev kits might be able to handle it (they use the Tegra K1), but other than that... I don't know. \n. Unity will have Cardboard / GoogleVR built-in to the engine in the not too distant future.  There's no known easy fix in the current SDK, which is going to be deprecated anyway in favor of the built-in support.\n. For your use case, does it matter if the data you get back is spatialized or not?\n. This seems like a useful feature.  CardboardAudioSource.cs actually contains an AudioSource internally, so if you edit that script and add a passthrough method, does it work?  (This is a quick test, and if it works, unblocks you.  We can still add an official passthrough in an upcoming release.)\n. OK.  This requires a change in the actual audio plugin (libaudiopluginvrunity) to pass the data along.  We'll have that in the next release, coming very soon (a few weeks).\n. Did you upgrade the SDK in this project?  I think the file moved, so you would have had both the old location and new location in your project.  (Unity tends to do this on package upgrades.  It's a good idea to clean out the old package manually before upgrading.)\n. Q: What viewer are you using?  In the Unity editor do you have it selected, and on the phone do you have the correct QR code scanned?  \nThe reticle is actually not supposed to be perfectly centered.  It is meant to be directly under your pupils (actually, center of the viewer lens), which for a tiny phone like iPhone 5 is closer to the upper/outer corners, especially if you have the default v2 Cardboard set as the viewer.  \nThe screenshot above looks kind of normal for this configuration, which is why I'm double-checking that you have the correct viewer configured -- a mismatch will cause double vision and warping.\n. The profile setting on the Cardboard component applies only to the emulation mode, when you play the game in Unity itself -- think of it as a \"developer mode\" setting.  To change the profile setting used on the phone, you have to scan the viewer's QR code from within your app while it is running on the phone, which you  initiate by tapping the gear icon.\n. Quick notes:  After v0.6, changing parameters on the main camera (including stereoMultiplier) don't take effect immediately.  This is a performance optimization -- we were recomputing way too much stuff each frame.  You can force it, though, by turning on keepStereoUpdated.\nIn your 2nd set of screenshots, the vignette in 0.5.1 looks like a V1 Cardboard but the one in v0.7.2 looks like V2 Cardboard.  Those are the respective defaults for those versions of the library.  You can control that in the editor on the Cardboard's editor panel.  On the phone, scan the QR code to make sure you have it set as desired.\n. 1) GetHeadPose returns the native SDK's idea of the current head orientation (and offset, if you have the neck model enabled).  The native SDK tracks this by integrating and filtering the raw gyro values, with some prediction as well to account for the time to render the next frame.\nIn Unity, you can get the raw gyro through Input.gyro (http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Input-gyro.html)\n2) The use of Quaternion.LookRotation() is to convert the orientation from Matrix4x4 to a Quaternion.  In the matrix, column 2 is the rotated Z axis and column 1 is the rotated Y axis, so calling Quaternion.LookRotation() with them returns a quaternion that rotates the Z and Y axes to this orientation.  \nAs for drift, the native SDK tries to account for drift by detecting when you set the phone down, and looking at the gyro rates that occur at that time.  Some phones defeat this algorithm because their sensors are too noisy for it to ever detect that you have put the phone down.  We're still trying to tune the algorithm to cover more phones.\n. We just released v0.8 which has more gyro improvements.  Can you try it?  Since we renamed all the classes, I suggest testing with a build of the demo scene in a fresh project and running it on your phone to test the drift.\n. Are you able to install and run the Cardboard app from the Play Store?\n. In the Build Settings, make sure you set the default orientation to\nLandscape Left.\n. Under Edit>Project Settings>Audio, is the Spatializer plugin set to Gvr?\n. OK, I'll close the issue.  If that doesn't fix it, re-open.\n. The file name in your error message (audiopluginvrunity.dll) is the old name of that file. The new SDK should not be unpacking anything to that path, since the new dll name is (slightly) different: audioplugingvrunity.dll (vr -> gvr).  There may still be a permissions issue, but that does seem weird.  If you delete the entire Plugins directory, does that help?  Another workaround is to unpack the SDK into a new empty Unity project, then copy the missing file over.\n. We've replicated your issue internally.  Looks like there is some permissions issue with the old SDK that shows up in Win10.  Let me know if the workaround helps.\n. This looks like the issue:\n2016-05-20 14:55:26.329 VRMAX[2028:592689] Uncaught exception: NSInvalidArgumentException: *** -[NSPlaceholderString initWithFormat:locale:arguments:]: nil argument\nDid you make any changes to the Xcode project that Unity created?\n. Is it a new project, or did you upgrade the SDK in an existing project?  If upgrade, did you delete the Plugins directory before upgrading?\n. Oops, missed a part of the URL during the renamathon.  There should be a \"-android\" at the end.\n. Fixed.  Thanks!\n. This happens when the manifest gets reset from the one included in the\nunitypackage.  In particular, the Java class needs to be\nGoogleUnityActivity.  If you delete it and reimport the SDK -- uncheck\neverything wise but this one file -- this will likely fix the problem.\n. Follow-up thought.  If you need the activity class to be your own, there\nare some options.  If you extend GoogleUnityActivity, that should take care\nof it.  Otherwise, it gets tricky, involving decompilation and modifying\nthe SDK C# code.  Let me know if you have to go that way and I can give\nmore details.  (This is just one reason we are pursuing native integration\nwith Unity.)\n. There are actually two things to do if you extend GoogleUnityActivity.  First, change the manifest so it refers to your class.  Second, edit the corresponding string in VRDevices/AndroidDevice.cs.  Text search for com.google.unity,GoogleUnityActivity to find it.\n. Oops, sorry.  My advice is out of date.  Let me dig a little.  First, did you update the manifest to your extended class?\n. That definitely won't work.  If your activity class extends GoogleUnityActivity, the manifest needs to refer to your class specifically.  GoogleUnityActivity lives in Assets/Plugins/Android/unitygvractivity.aar, and it depends on other classes in gvr_android_common.aar in the same place.  Make sure to add those as dependencies in Android Studio.\n. Yes.\n. This is a bit of a hack, but you can decompile GoogleUnityActivity and change its base class to AppCompatActivity and then recompile that.\n. The correct manifest (or at least the one you should start with before editing) is in Assets/Plugins/Android.  It appears that Unity uses it when building from the editor but not when exporting to AS.  We'll have to add that to the online SDK docs.\n. The manifest is supposed to use GoogleUnityActivity.  The C# code expects it.  It appears that the Android Studio project doesn't link to the .aar's that are in our SDK.  GoogleUnityActivity is in unityvractivity.aar.\n. Try this (I'm saying all my steps just in case):\n- In Unity, export the project to Android Studio\n- In Android Studio, import the project, make sure it is gradle-based\n- File -> New Module -> Import Jar/Aar, and select Assets/Plugins/gvr_android_common.aar\n- Repeat the above step for unityvractivity.aar\n- Open the Module Settings for the app, select the Dependencies tab\n- Add a Module dependency for each of the two .aar's\n. If you are using the IGazePointer interface (which GvrReticle.cs does) you can get the intersection position that way.  Through IGazePointer you get more information, like whether an object is even being gazed at, which camera is seeing it, and what the intersection position is.\n. Do you mean the skybox doesn't appear in the sky or on the reflection on the floor (or both)?\n. Hmm.  Those clear flags should have been copied from the parent Main Camera\nat startup.\nOn May 29, 2016 2:47 AM, \"Muhammad Tirmizey\" notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nNever mind, it was just an issue of changing the clear flags from solid\ncolours to skybox for both Main Camera Left and Main Camera Right. Thanks\nthough.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/issues/232#issuecomment-222351969,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe/AJzUNFZdINH-lIM8QYtTGGmW5t3c-kUvks5qGWC0gaJpZM4IpKQ9\n.\n. Regarding UI, Unity 5.3.4p2 introduced a bug that doesn't draw World Space UI into cameras with a target texture.  We use a target texture for VR Mode to do the distortion correction.  Due to that and some other reasons, I'm sticking with 5.3.3 for the time being.  Can you try that?\n\nI can't tell from the preview there what the issue is for non-UI elements.  Can you explain?\n. As a test, set the distortion method to None.  This switches off the post-processing for distortion, allowing Unity to draw directly to the screen.  Any change?\n. Your issue seems to be happening precisely when Unity is drawing directly to the screen, as opposed to through the post-processing filter we apply for distortion correction.  \nAre you using any other Image Effects?  Maybe you could post a screenshot of your Main Camera's inspector panel?\n. I'm not sure the Audio plugin we ship will link on Linux.  We don't officially support it since it is still experimental.  But:  did you build for a mobile platform or for desktop?\n. You can bypass this completely by setting the targetSDK in the manifest to 22 (Lollipop).  Then the user will be asked for permission during installation per the old method before Marshmallow.  Is this an option for you?\n. Can you check adb logcat to see if you are getting any errors posted during this process?  Also, is the app set up for landscape or portrait orientation?\n. After asking around internally, I hear that the GoogleVR (Cardboard) SDK doesn't ask for this permission (or any permission) at activity startup, only when the gear button is tapped. So I guess part of the problem is to figure out who/what is requesting it, in addition to how.\n. Which script are you using to drive the gaze events, GazeInputModule.cs or GvrGaze.cs?\n. Did you upgrade from the Cardboard SDK to GoogleVR in this project?\n. OK.  Check that you have the file libaudioplugingvrunity.so in Assets/Plugins/Android/libs/x86 and libs/armeabi-v7a.  Also, what's your phone model?\n. If you don't have any GvrAudioSource components in your scene, then the error is really just a log message.  It will have no effect on game play.  In that case, if you are getting a black screen, the problem may lie elsewhere.  Does the DemoScenes/HeadsetDemo sample scene work OK for you?\n. I think audio message might be unrelated to the black screen problem.  The \"native render plugin\" message is referring to audio rendering.  Can you say how you hooked up GvrAdapter to the main camera?  (Mainly, do you have a StereoController on the main camera?)\n. As a test, turn off VR Mode Enabled in the GvrViewer inspector.  You should see the scene in mono, and hopefully not just a black screen.\nBTW, let's gather some other data:\n-  What version of Unity?\n-  Any significant changes to the Player Settings compared to the HeadsetDemo?\n. I'll ask one of our iOS people, but I think the first thing they will want to know is if you have -ObjC in the linker flags of the Xcode project.\n. Try adding it.  The last few times I've seen the \"unrecognized selector\" error happen is was because -ObjC was needed.  Side note:  Our SDK as of v0.7 tries to add this flag to the Xcode project automatically, so I'm surprised it is not there.\n. For reference, here's the code in Unity that modifies the Xcode project:\nhttps://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/blob/master/GoogleVR/Editor/GvrViewerEditor.cs#L119\nSee the link for the specific changes made.  If you include these same modifications via your script, you are good to go.\n. This happens when the build target is WebPlayer, which is obsolete.  Open the Build Settings dialog and select Android or iOS as the build target.\n. This happens because the controller does a Recenter operation in Awake(), and at that moment the GvrViewer object may not have been instantiated yet.  The GvrViewer.Instance property returns null, and GvrController handles that properly, but it still does cause this error message as a side effect.  It's harmless for you, and we will fix it in the SDK so it is not alarming.\n. Unity 5.3.4f1 and earlier do not have the problem.\n. It's posted here:\n    https://developers.google.com/vr/unity/release-notes#known_issues\n. It appears that ___sincos_stret was introduced in Mavericks, according to this SO comment:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/a/19017286/4372377\nI don't think we've officially declared a minimum OSX version that our dylibs will run on, so this probably just was happenstance since internally we are all running more recent versions.\n. What version of Unity are you using?\n. Great catch!  We put that line in as a backstop to prevent 90% of developers from accidentally running at 30Hz on iOS (the default), which is really too slow for VR.  A better location for it would probably be in this function:\nhttps://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/blob/master/GoogleVR/Legacy/Scripts/Internal/VRDevices/iOSDevice.cs#L36\n. Can you make sure that you are forcing the app to Landscape mode in Unity's build settings?  For Mac, we recommend doing this by leaving the Default Orientation at Auto, but removing the Portrait modes from the Allow Orientations list.\n. That's an audio file processing problem.  You want to look for audio tools like Audacity or ffmpeg to help with that, as it's out of our scope.\n. I have not had a chance to dig into this much, but my first suspicion is that it has to do with the way Unity looks for the object to send event callbacks to.  They actually publish the source for all of the uGUI stuff here:\nhttps://bitbucket.org/Unity-Technologies/ui/src/2ab730c794ce?at=5.3\nWhat I think may be happening is that when the event processing code looks for the gameobject that will handle a \"pointer down\" event, it is finding the EventTrigger rather than the Button.  That's because Button only responds to \"click\", but EventTrigger is happy to respond to \"pointer down\", \"pointer up\" or \"click\".\nThere is logic in GazeInputModule to look for a pointer-down handler and then fall back to looking for a click handler if the first search yielded null.  This was modeled on the exact same logic in their TouchInputModule, which was probably the way they intended to make buttons work with the down/up event model.\nThe problem is that since EventTrigger says it handles pointer-down, it prevents the fallback search for a click handler.  So EventTrigger masking the Buttons under it in the hierarchy could just be a limitation in Unity's logic.  I don't see a way for making EventTrigger say \"yes, I respond to pointer down\" only when you have actually added a callback -- the current behavior is baked into the .NET inheritance and reflection mechanism they are using.\nI'm guessing they intended EventTrigger to be a catchall for event handling -- it does everything, or don't use it.  But there could be a way to make this work.  All uGUI event callbacks receive a data blob that says which actual game object got the event, so in the click callback you register on the EventTrigger, you could forward the click back to the original object if it also responds to a Click.  (I.e. if it can be cast to IPointerClickHandler.)  That would get around the fact that the object was missed due to the handler search logic.\n(As for why it works in the editor but not on the phone, that's still a mystery.  The additional complication is that on your computer, Input.GetMouseButtonDown() is real, but on the phone it is synthesized from a screen touch.)\nNot ruling out a bug in GazeInputModule that actually makes this happen, despite all the machinery I described above, but this is what I've got as of now.\n. The UI layer is effectively migrating out of the SDK into the core VR support of Android N.  The approach is now to consider it part of the system UI, similar to the status bar and nav bar.  Thus apps have less ability to control its specific appearance, other than hiding/showing it as a whole.  Darkening the vertical bar (or something like that) is being looked at actively. \nVS distortion is discussed here: http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/BrianKehrer/20160125/264161/VR_Distortion_Correction_using_Vertex_Displacement.php\nBrian also gave a talk at I/O this year about it but I don't have the YouTube link handy.  It's used in Cardboard Design Lab and the Cardboard app's arctic-themed welcome scene.\n. Here's the line in our post-build method that adds -ObjC:\nhttps://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/blob/master/GoogleVR/Legacy/Editor/GvrViewerEditor.cs#L103\nIf you aren't seeing that in the resulting Xcode project, the next step is to figure out if this function is being executed -- maybe a Debug.Log call.  It works for us internally.  Last version of Xcode I used when testing was 7.2 -- 7.3 caused compilation errors in Unity-generated code.\n. Very strange!  I am typically building on Mac these days, and the UNITY_IOS guard does seem to work.  Here's the list of directives Unity understands:\nhttp://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PlatformDependentCompilation.html\nWhere it says:\nUNITY_IOS   #define directive for compiling/executing code for the iOS platform.\nAlthough if the platform check on that line you linked to turns out to be sufficient we can make the change regardless.\n. The \"Unable to find libaudioplugingvrunity\" message is Unity's output. This message has been seen for some time, but apparently has no actual effect on the plugin's behavior.  It includes the \"lib\" prefix, which is implied in the System.loadLibrary argument, so those are actually the same underneath.  \nThe crash is most likely related to the FMOD message, which looks like it is a thread-related problem.\n. Which version of the SDK are you using?  The script GvrPreRender was added to the SDK to fix this bug, since the two eye regions only clear their own portions of the screen.\n. Check that GvrPreRender is getting set up properly and is enabled in your scene.  Its camera is the one that clears the entire screen.  In older versions of the SDK it was part of the GvrMain prefab.  In the most recent version, it is created at start time by GvrViewer.\n. We just tried repro'ing on an S7/6.0.1 device using the demo scene (floating red cube) from our SDK, but so far no luck.  \nHave you ever noticed any messages in logcat when you do the reinstall that causes the problem?  I can think of a possible way it would happen, but that involves an exception getting thrown at certain point, and also assumes that the S7 is one of those phones where we have to work around them reporting an incorrect physical dot-per-inch value.\n. Cardboard Design Lab uses vertex displacement distortion, which is done in the shaders, so you should set the distortion method to None rather than Unity.\n. There is a bug in undistortSurface that is not in undistortVertex.  Brian Kehrer pointed it out to me recently.  Basically, the bug is that the math in undistortSurface doesn't account for a non-identity model->world matrix (an oversight).  This is apparently \"worked around\" by the static batching setting that you found.  (To check this, try this test with a modified vert/frag shader, where you call undistortVertex.)\n. Can you try with this instead:\nvoid vert(inout appdata_full v) {\n    v.vertex = mul(_World2Object, undistortSurface(v.vertex));\n}\nThis is the missing adjustment for the model matrix (inverted, because we're cancelling out of part of Unity's built in MVP transformation).  If it works for you, the \"real\" fix is for us to move _World2Object into undistortSurface().\n. We shipped v0.9 of the SDK today, which includes this fix.\n. According to this post:\nhttp://forum.unity3d.com/threads/cant-compile-badimageformatexception.212371/\nThis may be one of those problems that can strike randomly when your system is in a weird state of some kind.  The \"builds-with\" vs \"doesn't-build-with\" test is frustrating because it may not actually have to do with the doesn't-build-with packages -- just the code paths they trigger in Unity.  (In that post, the user got the error just by adding empty C# scripts to a new project and then trying to build.  They also fixed their issue by the old standby, rebooting.)\nThis may not be the same as your instance of the issue -- other pages I've found are all over the place.\n. For reference, which version of Unity are you using?  Was it the same version for 0.6 as well?  There have been a number of uGUI-related issues in recent Unity point releases.\n. The dragging is done here: https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/blob/master/GoogleVR/Scripts/GazeInputModule.cs#L191\n. The UI issue was a bug in Unity itself, that came in at 5.3.4p2 and was fixed as of 5.3.6f1.  The bug was that Canvas objects in world space mode failed to render into cameras with a target texture.\n. What's your setup?  Which version of the SDK, are you using one of the prefabs in the older versions or a plain Main Camera with StereoController attached, does the camera have a parent object?\n. Moving the entire GvrMain object around (meaning, the parent of the Head) is the right way to control the user pose in the scene space, if that's what you are trying to do.\n. Just change the transform of the GvrMain root node.  This is like moving the player's body.  Their head rotation is relative to that orientation.\n. In our current incarnation of the GoogleVR SDK, you could insert per-eye shader uniforms around here:\nhttps://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/blob/master/GoogleVR/Legacy/Scripts/Internal/GvrEye.cs#L173\nThis won't translate to the upcoming native integration of GoogleVR in Unity, unfortunately.  Maybe Unity has another method planned or implemented in their native VR support, for cases like yours.\nAlternatively, if all you need to know is which eye, then the following trick will work in both current and upcoming SDKs:  In your shader, look at the sign of UNITY_MATRIX_P[2][0].  It will be positive for the left eye and negative for the right eye.  (Or vice versa, if the depressingly common sign-error bug decided to put in an appearance here.)\nIf-statements in shaders aren't great, although we do use one in our vertex-based distortion code, as it is a net win for Cardboard regardless.\n. Oh wow, that's a horrible leak.  Confirmed on 5.3.6.  \nHowever, I tried Unity 5.3.3 and I do not see the leak occurring.  Can you try it too in order to confirm?\nUnity had a major regression, starting in 5.3.4p2, with drawing uGUI Canvas objects into cameras that have a RenderTexture as the target, rather than the main screen.  From 5.3.4p2 up till 5.3.6f1 Canvases did not render at all.  Now it looks like they render again in 5.3.6, but with a bad memory leak.\nNote that every Cardboard camera in VR Mode is using a RenderTexture as the target (for distortion correction) -- this would be why you don't see the problem whenever you disable VR Mode or StereoController.  Oculus also does not draw into a RenderTexture.\nIf you confirm that 5.3.3 does not show the leak, the bug has to be reported to Unity.\n. The original Unity bugs filed about Canvases not rendering at all into RenderTextures were 790264, 799386 and 795880.\n. The issue is not specific to Cardboard.  It happens when Unity renders a world-space Canvas with any Camera targeting a RenderTexture, and that is the mechanism we use to implement the distortion correction.  \nA different UI system (NGUI, etc) likely will not have this problem, though porting your UI to that is not a pleasant thought either.\n. Hmm.  The camera is re-enabled at the end of the frame by the coroutine.  Perhaps that is too late, despite the wording of the forum post.\n. The targetSDKVersion attribute is in Assets/Plugins/Android/AndroidManifest.xml, and we been shipping with it set to 22 in order to (for now) use install-time permissions rather than runtime permissions.  \nThis was because our prior underlying Android NDK didn't actually know how to ask for permissions at runtime.  That's no longer the case, I believe, so updating to 24 ought to be OK.  \nTry editing that file and setting the targetSDK to 24 there.\n. I unpacked the unitygvractivity.aar and here's the manifest:\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n\n\n\n```\nThat's definitely a bit lighter weight than I recall seeing in the past...\nSome questions for you:  \nAre you seeing this from a straight Unity build of the apk, or are you exporting to Android Studio and building there?\nIs this an install time or runtime permission request you are getting?  (Or: what's the target SDK you have in your main manifest?)\n. Vuforia is one of the other Unity SDKs or there that suits things like mess with the apps view hierarchy (or on Android it wants to provide the Activity class, like ours).  This does make it hard to mix them.  \nIn the iOS case, both SDKs may be trying to override the app controller to control how the view hierarchy is built.  The files that do that in our SDK are in Assets/Plugins/iOS - look for the two ObjC source files.  If Vuforia has similar files, then they may have to be stitched together.\nAnother possibility we will have to look at internally is if our code that turns on the UI elements makes an assumption about the view hierarchy that isn't true if Vuforia has modified it.\n. No, the user's pairing process for viewer+phone is meant to occur outside of any app.  It's a \"system\" setting that spans all apps, kind of like in Android where you can go into the Settings and change whether the screen orientation is locked or not, or if GPS is enabled.  Apps aren't supposed to do that.\n. You can certainly decide programmatically at the app level whether to set the GvrViewer's DefaultDevice to a different profile URL.  It won't affect anyone who has already scanned a code for their own viewer, either.\n. First thing to check is: when are you executing the SetResolution call?  For it to work given the intermediate render textures the SDK uses, it would have to be done very early, before GvrViewer.StereoScreen gets created.  There might still be an actual bug here even so, but let's check that first.  To try, edit GvrViewer.cs and put the SetResolution call in Awake(), first thing.  Or if you know there is another bit of code in your scripts that executes early enough, put it there.\n. In the GvrViewer inspector, what do you have the Distortion Correction method set to?\n. There are notes here:\nhttps://developer.vuforia.com/library/articles/Solution/Integrating-Cardboard-to-the-ARVR-Sample\nthat address the AppController and related iOS issues (near the bottom of the page).\n. Our current SDK will only support Cardboard.  We're moving to the natively-integrated GoogleVR support in Unity in order to handle Daydream, because of the much higher performance demands.  The build settings in the editor are where you will say which you are targeting.\n. That's correct.  As of v0.9, the magnet trigger is no longer supported.  Notice given here: https://developers.google.com/vr/unity/release-notes\n. First thing to check is if you actually have those scripts in your project.  They live in Assets/GoogleVR/Legacy/Scripts.\n. What version of the SDKs do you have?  In our recent releases, we renamed unityvractivity.jar to unitygvractivity.aar, and now have a separate file, gvr_android_common.aar, which has the UiLayer and related classes.\n. When you upgraded the Unity SDK, did you completely delete the old SDK files first?  Unity does not do that, so you may still have old files like unityvractivity.jar left over from before the upgrade.  See the upgrade instructions here:\nhttps://developers.google.com/vr/unity/release-notes#upgrade_instructions\nThe current Unity SDK now has unitygvractivity.aar, which has only the classes GoogleUnityActivity and UnityVrActivityListener in it.  The rest of the Android classes it uses, like UiLayer, are now in gvr_android_common.aar, which is basically the same as \"common.aar\" in the Android SDK.  So you only need to keep one of those files.\n. GvrProfile is not actually used for much except simulating the stereo profile of a phone when you play the game inside the Unity editor.  In any other case it is meant to hold values that come out of the native C++ layer of the SDK.  So, modifying these values from your code in Android Studio will almost certainly not work the way you want.\n. That's a stub, and it only is used for the Game window rendering when playing in the editor.\n. Yes.  It is now always enabled.\n. It's not enabled yet.  That will arrive when Unity ships with GoogleVR built-in.\n. Were these test done with the phone lying flat?  If so, can you prop the phone on its side and see how that changes things?  The algorithm was changed between 0.6 and 0.9 in a way that should helps in many cases but not so much when the screen is flat (i.e. gravity is aligned with the Z axis).\n. That is so for iOS.  For Android, the profile is stored on the sdcard, so once the user has scanned a QR code from any app, your default is no longer used.  (You can't override a user's choice.)\n. Do you have the package Assets/Plugins/iOS/MaterialRobotoFontLoader.bundle in your project?\n. There's much discussion of this in a prior issue, with workarounds:\nhttps://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/issues/144\nIn the case of iOS, try the solution of building the app with orientation set to landscape, and then switch to portrait in Awake().\n.

Therefore, the phone which has encountered this issue was not mine and I cannot contact the phone user.

Hello,\nI've tested to put manually one of the HTC devices in immersive mode, but the result on the view is the same. With other cardboard apps without the unity3d plugin, I don't have this problem, each side of the view takes correctly the full available space on the screen. Maybe a problem with the computation of the render view size on HTC GPU devices with the plugin ?\n. Hi,\nThe top bar on the phone appears when we takes a screenshot (it's a custom rom device), it's a normal behaviour of the device. For the presence of the gear icon, it's normal, i've unchecked this feature of plugin in the unity editor. So, we have made several other tests : \n- We have tested if other \"simple\" unity3d apps without any cardboard or vr plugins : the app is running normally with full available screen.\n- We have launched the official cardboard app (i don't know which SDK this app is using), the problem is the same \n  \n- We have checked the adb logs and there were no error messages.\n. Okay,\nThank you very much for your good explanation of the problem. One more weird thing happened, when we tried to play this app (present on cardboard play store) : the stereo view works perfectly. However, in the description of the app, the developer says \"This is Card board unity3d plugin sample game\". Maybe he provided a bug fix in the unity3d plugin...\n. Ok ! Thank you for explanation ! \nCan the team provide some low-level fix in the plugin like check the dpi value returned by the two methods ?

We are actually moving away from Tilt to exit functionality. It'll stay in the demos, but we don't recommend it as a standard. It's hard for users to do and often results in phones falling out of cardboard.\n. If you disable the CardboardAudioListener component then this background crash will go away. We updated the 0.6.0 SDK package to disable this by default. Note that we're working to get a fix or workaround for this asap, so it should be safe to use during development if you need it.\n. Closing as this is fixed now.\n. Hi. We already smooth the change that happens when occlusion occurs. Maybe it's happening too quickly for you and sounds instantaneous? You can change the rate by editing CardboardAudio.cs and modifying occlusionLerpSpeed to be a lower number.\n. Closing as we're tracking this internally now.\n. Thanks for the feedback. We'll look into these requests for a future version of the SDK. The LayerMask should be especially straightforward.\n. Closing as we're tracking this internally now.\n. To be clear, the crash only happens when the app is backgrounded. We disabled CardboardAudioListener so that no one was inadvertently impacted by this crash, but you can safely enable it for development. We expect that either Unity will post a fix or we will post a workaround soon.\n. The inability to find the libaudioplugin is most likely the cause of the failure. Can you try importing the SDK you have into a fresh project, buidling for android, and letting us know if it crashes? If it does not crash, please delete the Cardboard and Plugins folders (or the parts of Plugins from Cardboard) and re-import the SDK package.\n. To be clear, you are importing the .unitypackage for Cardboard not cloning anything from git, right?\n. Can you confirm that your project has Plugins/Android/libs/armabi-v7a/libaudiopluginvrunity ? Thanks. We've never seen this error before, so trying to figure out what could be going wrong.\n. You're right about the path. Just verifying that the file is actually there. Are you building on Windows or OSX?\nOne more test, can you go into the AudioSettings and set the Spatializer to the Cardboard Spatializer and build again? I want to see if that pulls the file in.\n. Sorry, but that's not a currently supported or planned feature.\n. Hi. This is not expected to work because our SDK requires code running on the phone to read the sensors and compute the orientation, and of course there is no code running on the phone when you are using Unity Remote.\n. You need to set the Audio Spatializer plugin for your project as described in our getting started doc: https://developers.google.com/cardboard/unity/guide#spatial_audio_for_vr\n. You can set the DefaultDeviceProfile in Cardboard.cs. This will determine the default used for users. If they have already paired a viewer, however, this setting will have no effect. We do not intend to allow apps to programmatically override the actual viewer users have paired.\n. Justin, can you update to the 0.6.0 SDK and try again? IIRC we added a couple of fixes for the newest iOS phones in that release.\n. Thanks for the project. One more question. What version of Unity are you using?\n. It's a bug.

Hi. We're not able to repro here. Do you get that Failed to load error in the Editor console or when you build an app? What OS are you running? What platform are you targeting?\n\nAlso, it's very suspicious that you are not seeing Cardboard Spatial Audio in the Audio Project settings. That means something almost certainly is wrong. \n. Thanks for the information. The core problem is that the dll isn't loading, which is why you can't see the dropdown in the Editor.\nWe are testing on a Win 7 x64 machine using the same version of Unity and unfortunately can't repro. Clearly there is something subtly different on your machine than our test machine. Do you have Visual Studio installed by any chance? We're wondering if the issue is some sort of vc_redist related problem.\nLastly, just to sanity check, you do have the file Assets/Plugins/x86_64/audiopluginvrunity.dll right?\n.

Due to the way that platform works and the way it's licensed, they would need to integrate our SDK and not the other way around.\n. Yes, that is correct.

Thats's correct. This is a confirmed unity bug.\n. If you hold down alt and move the mouse, that will allow you to look around in VR.\n. Those additional binaries add a lot of size to the plugin which is problematic for some users. We're looking into other options, so I've re-opened this issue.\n. Sorry, I meant that for some developers the extra size hit was difficult. Cardboard is used around the world, including places where 100MB extra download is meaningful. Still, I agree with you that supporting the simulator is important and something we'll be looking at w/ the native integrations in Unity.\n. On both iOS and Android you can set the default viewer for your app by\nmodifying the DefaultDevice in GVRViewer.cs. This will be used unless the\nuser has already paired a device.

Removing magnet trigger actually opens up a lot more ways to help the platform going forward. The magnet trigger support had a constant performance overhead and prevented us from doing more interesting things with the compass (like improving drift correction). Given that WWGC partners started moving away from magnets over a year ago, the number of magnet based viewers in active use will only go down over time (they are, after all, just cardboard :)\n\nAlso, I should be clear that this SDK change doesn't impact any existing apps, and any developer who wants to hold onto magnet support can stick with an SDK version pre 0.9. \n. The public version of Unity doesn't currently include native support for Daydream. Until that is released, you won't get many of the features required for smooth, low latency VR even on a 6P. We'll hopefully have more to share about native Daydream support in Unity soon.\n.

If not, you can be running without the correct clock speeds and will run very fast for a short period of time and then will slow down.\nThe framerate drops w/ controller emulator on 6P are a known issue.

Hi. This is a regression for the 1.0 SDK due to our work on the native integration for Unity. We're working on restoring it in our next version.\n. Actually, I should be more specific. The ShowSettingsDialog() part will be fixed. We will no longer allow developers to disable standard \"aperature\" including the back button, alignment line, and gear icon.\n. Given that the behavior changes across Unity versions it's likely a unity specific issue. Please file a bug with them.. Closing as a dupe. Please add further info on #144 \n.

Very strange. I honestly have no idea what could have caused this. Have you tried rebooting the problematic phone?\n. Which phone are you using? Which version of Unity are you using?\n. You can try to use the Daydream preview version of Unity w/ native integration but we generally are not able to provide support for this kind of feature as external displays aren't intended to be supported by Google VR.\n. Which phone are you using? Which version of Unity? If using the Daydream preview, which VR SDKs are enabled?\n. You can have vr enabled if you are using the Daydream preview build, but not vanilla 5.4.\n. Yes. This is a known issue as mentioned. It'll be fixed in our next release, but if it's critical to you I suggest you drop back to 0.9.1.\n. I'm sorry but we can't provide support here for other pieces of middleware or older versions of our SDK.\n. Hi. Sorry for the confusing messaging. You are on a version of Unity previous to our native integration, so you should either update to the daydream technical preview or unpack the included legacy support .unitypackage. I've added this to our internal tracker and we'll fix it for the next release.\n. Glad you got it fixed!\n. This kind of \"how to\" question is better posted on stack overflow as this forum is just for bugs.\n. Hi, s1mar. Drift is a known issue on some phones. The amount of drift and repro steps depend on the specific hardware. We'll be making steady improvements to drift correction in cardboard, but it's hard to simply \"fix\" this for all devices. I'm closing this as we have other open bugs on this issue.\n. That compat message has an error.

Like I said, the problem is in the message. This appears on any version of unity that isn't the technical preview w/ Daydream integration. If you imported the compat packages, you can safely ignore it.\n. The phone-to-phone mode uses bluetooth. Please make sure to follow the instructions here: https://developers.google.com/vr/daydream/dev-kit-setup\n. Great!\n. Can you post a video or some images of the problem? It's hard to diagnose from your description.\n. Thanks for the feedback but the current behavior is WAI and we're don't plan to change this part of our SDK behavior.\n. The problem is that Daydream requires Android N(ougat) which is API 24\nwhich you don't have installed.

The crash you are seeing in 1.0 is due to a regression where support for Metal broke. If you use GL on iOS for 1.0 it should work fine. We'll restore the codepath that supported Metal in the next update of our Unity SDK.\n. Uncheck Automatic Graphics API in the player settings.\n. I think you are conflating two separate issues. We're already talking about the memory leak in another thread. The issue here is specific to metal based on your screenshot above and that should be totally fixable in player settings.\n.

We intentionally changed the location of the gear and the placement of the alignment line to accommodate the new Daydream View as well as to minimize glare on some cardboard viewers. These changes are active on Android and will propagate to iOS and the Unity editor soon.\n. What do you mean by \"VR mode enabled\"?

Thanks. That makes me pretty confident the bug has nothing to do with GVR but is just highlighted by it.\n. This doesn't have enough information to diagnose and looks very likely to be related to a unity build issue, not our SDK.\n. I'm sorry but we can't provide support for old versions of the SDK, especially when combined with versions of Xcode that weren't even available when that version of the SDK was released.\n. Which version of Unity are you using?\n. I'm sorry but these icons cannot be changed. There should be no mis-touches as long as your viewer conforms to the WWGC standard.\n. That's correct. We're migrating from a plugin to the native integration and we had to break a few eggs to make the proverbial omelette. Once we complete the transition to the native integration we'll re-add magic window support.\n. You need to unpack the backwards compat package inside the SDK.\n. From 1.0 on, the GVR Unity SDK is targeted at the native integration (now in technical preview). If you are using a version w/ out technical preview, then you need some extra scripts, which are in the \"backwards compat\" package.\n. What device is that? It looks like it's probably mis-reporting it's DPI.\n. What kind of AA were you using? Some formats are incompatible with our distortion correction code.\n. Which version of Unity are you using? Which version of the SDK? Is it failing to find Camera_Left or is it returning an FOV you don't expect? What FOV value is being returned?\n. You should take a look writing a shader that uses unity_StereoEyeIndex. This is much more efficient in the GVR Unity builds than setting up two cameras and works perfectly if you just want to change colors or UVs or textures based on which eye is rendering.\n. Which version of Unity are you using?\n. You can just disable the gvr view component or switch to a different\ncamera.\n\nOn Fri, Nov 11, 2016, 8:35 PM s1mar notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI'm using 5.5b10\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/issues/372#issuecomment-260101333,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ANamfqFHEdBxDu2IAgctVWSk_PpMSOcWks5q9UItgaJpZM4KvmcC\n.\n.

That's correct. The controller is only supported on Daydream devices, and Daydream is Android only.\n. This is a good request and will be something we add in a future SDK.\n. I bet this is a depth precision issue, maybe also from the fact that your skybox is geo. Can you try two things:\n\n1) In Daydream settings, use a 32 bit depth buffer not the default of 16.

What you are describing is pretty much working as intended. Daydream is only supported on Android, hence why you need to make that the build target. And yes, if you want to use the GVR Unity SDK you have to import it after you create the project. Right now the native integration focuses on rendering and head tracking (which you don't need the GVR SDK for) but over time more we'll migrate in more of the GVR SDK.. If you are using the native integration then you shouldn't use GVRView or StereoController at all. Also, GVR7 is pretty old. I suggest you update to GVR12.. Thanks for the bug report. We've heard of this in a few other places. What exact version of Unity are you using? What device are you testing on?. What platform are you building for? What version of Unity are you using?. Right now the technical preview GVR13 is targeted at Daydream, which is Android only. For native iOS (Cardboard) support, that should land in an upcoming beta of 5.6.\n\nIf you need to work around the missing script errors you can move the #ifdefs from the top of those class files to the inside of the class. That will make sure that the components exist, but do nothing.. The best immediate solution would be to use the 1.0 SDK w/ Unity 5.4 (non\ntechnical preview). The best solution in the near future will be the native\nintegration in 5.6.\n-Nathan\nOn Sun, Dec 18, 2016 at 7:39 AM, Massimo notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI know I'm a bit off topic but what if I'd like to develop just for\ncardboard?

The video components in the GVR Unity SDK should work just fine for cardboard. \n\nThe libaudioplugin warning is likely to be harmless.\nNote that while HLS is supported, I don't think HLS supports live streaming. You will likely have to modify the video player source if you want to support live streaming.. Sorry for the issues. We'll take a look with our friends at Unity.. Can you post a play store link to your game?. Do you have multiple cameras in the scene? If so, it's a known bug that we'll have fixed in the next version.. It'll be fixed in our next release.. Can you post an error log? And what version of the GVR Unity SDK are you using?. Those instructions are for the Daydream Technical preview, not 5.4.1.. The SDK includes that unitypackage. Just unpack it into the main project.. We appreciate the feedback and are looking into ways to minimize Home button false positives, but we don't plan to allow apps to disable the home button programatically.. In general, what you are describing sounds like thermal throttling, where the phone runs at max speed until it gets too hot, then slows down. \nIn terms of the difference between pre and post native, my guess is that you are now (unintentionally) rendering to a higher resolution than you were before. I suggest you play around with the VRSettings.renderScale.. @kalineh, vulkan is not supported for daydream or cardboard. \nAlso, that bug is unrelated to this thread. In the future please try to file new issues in cases like this. \n. Great!. Glad to hear that it's fixed.. Glad you got it fixed.. That's correct. Sorry for the typo.. We try to make version updates be as simple as dropping on a new plugin. Upgrading Unity is a bit more involved, but the issues you run into there aren't specific to Daydream.\nTo echo martin's comment earlier, specific examples of pain points would be very helpful.. Appreciate the feedback, closing out as 5.6.1p3 is pretty solid and we're focused on further improvements, and bug fixes.. If you build for cardboard it will disable async reprojection. Daydream always has async reprojection enabled.\nRegarding the perf issue you're seeing, what device are you testing on? What version of Unity and what version of the GVR SDK?.

Yes. Either use TargetEye (easier) or a shader (faster).. This is the expected behavior depending on the size of your phone and the viewer that is being used. There's no point rendering pixels that someone can't actually see in the viewer.. Sounds like a phone specific issue, and CDL is built using some very custom opimizations.. Yes, a hardware gyro is required for a reasonably good experience.. I'm pretty sure these phones do not have hardware gyros. They may claim to have a \"software gyro\" but that's not sufficient for the GVR SDK.. Yes, in VR disabling head tracking just leads to sick users. If you are trying to do magic window/monocular 360 I suggest you just use the gyro to drive the camera and don't rely on any VR features.. Sorry for the frustration.

Thanks for the clarification, Sanoend. There is fundamentally a big change between pre and post native integrations. Many ideas that were essential in the pre-native integration world (like GVR Viewer) are at best superfluous with a native integration. In many cases, maintaining the pre-native, post-native, and a compat layer was very time consuming and not something we wanted to do indefinitely.\n\nGoing forward we'll be focused entirely on providing a clean, stable API for the native integration, which is much easier now that we are no longer carrying the old baggage around. I know that doesn't make your life any easier right now, but it should help everyone a great deal in the future.. I'm sorry but these issues are for bug reports. For \"how to\" questions please post on stack overflow or a similar site. I will say that we do not support white-label usage of YouTube.

Yes, this was a feature that we had to disable on our way to the native integration. However, it's something that we recognize is very useful for Cardboard developers and we're looking into ways to bring it back.. We don't allow people to change the IPD as it's specific to the viewer being used.. This should be fixed in 1.6.1 of the keyboard app.. Async reprojection requires specific hardware and software, so it's a Daydream only feature.. I'm sorry but this is not a VR specific question, so you'd have better luck posting on the Unity forums.. Are you using Unity 5.6? If so, this was a regression and should be fixed in an upcoming bugfix release.. Looks like a clipping or z-culling issue. Try using a 32 bit depth buffer (in the VR settings).. For general questions about Unity, please use their forums. This tracker is just for bugs specific to Daydream/GoogleVR.. Thanks for the help resolving this!. Yes, the version of the GVR SDK bundled with Unity lags behind the main release. However, the Google VR Services (required for Daydream) will automatically hot swap the SDK built into your app w/ the latest so you should see these benefits at runtime.. Head tracking and stereo rendering are both required for VR rendering, so we don't allow them to be disabled independently anymore. You can simply disable VR mode entirely if you like..

Does it have a gyro?\n\nOn Jul 3, 2017 5:16 PM, \"xslipstream\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\ndowngraded to unity 5.5.4f1 and v1.30 googlevr sdk, same problem\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/issues/641#issuecomment-312753060,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ANamftjkbv8igYNApHwjlDU8PWiWeMbhks5sKYRvgaJpZM4OMfwt\n.\n.

If you want to render a screenspace button like the X then you need to hack it into the android view hierarchy.. We only support whole fractions of 60 fps (the vsync rate) to avoid judder.. This should be fixed in the current version of Android O.. Disabling main distortion and using app-specific vertex distortion is only supported in the legacy (pre 5.6) cardboard path. We may bring it back in the future, but it's not a high priority right now. If you want to go with vertex distortion, we recommend you use Unity 5.4 and an older SDK..

With cardboard some amount of drift is inevitable. This is one of the key differences between daydream and cardboard.. For cardboard you request permissions like any other Unity app.. The best approach is to use the stereo eye index in a custom shader. There is an example of this in the video player samples in the SDK.. Closing this as the GVR sdk does not support tablets.. For Unity, we recommend you use the built in controller components and prefabs, which have basically the same arm model (plus some additional, Unity specific features).. In Cardboard, you request camera permissions just like any other Android app.. Unfortunately this is a system notification that we can't work around..

You want to create two cameras and set the stereoTargetEye to left for one and right for the other.. Just to be clear, the expected behavior is that calling Application.Quit() while in Daydream mode should return you to the 2D android launcher. There are cases where you may get a few sections of the previous app showing, but that shouldn't cause a DFX submission rejection.\n\nI believe @bigfootaus issue is different. They have a \"Close Game\" button in VR which they expect to exit the app and return to Daydream Home, but they call Application.Quit() which conflicts with the above. The easiest fix is to simply not have an app specific \"Close App\" button as users can do that at any point just by pressing the Home button. If you feel you have to have such a button, then you need to fire off the right intent to launch Daydream Home, not exit your app.. Thanks for the bug report. We've reproduced this internally and will disable support for single pass on these GPUs as well as on cardboard generally (given overall driver maturity for this feature). Unity will automatically fall back to multi-pass rendering once this update is out when run on these devices.. Unfortunately single pass rendering just doesn't work reliably on those devices. We're going to release an update to the SDK and VRCore that disables single pass on devices that we know can't support it robustly.. Both, actually.\nOn Wed, Oct 4, 2017 at 11:17 AM, dustinkerstein notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n@nathanmartz https://github.com/nathanmartz ok, so that means the fix\nwill be in a future Unity release rather than Google VR Services, correct?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/issues/709#issuecomment-334244568,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ANamfsuw22WaWkjnzA8A2qsNKmtSeFnkks5so8vNgaJpZM4PK81-\n.\n.

From what I can tell, higher framerate will help a bit, but these are all expected on Cardboard (iOS and Android). Cardboard is designed to give reasonable quality, short VR sessions to the widest possible audience. If you want an experience with lower latency, better tracking, no ghosting, etc. then you should look to Daydream.. Single pass rendering is already enabled in Unity 5.6 for Daydream. However, due to a number of driver bugs, it is very rarely actually faster and we do not recommend developers enable it unless you are willing to spend time carefully profiling your app on different devices to ensure enabling single pass rendering is actually an optimization for you.. We are steadily improving our drift correction algorithms, both by improving the quality of the filters and adding new sensors (like magnetometer). In the case of the mag, this is only supported for Daydream ready devices, as there's quite a bit of variance between different versions of a given kind of sensor, and it's easy to wind up adding noise that makes your drift worse.. You'd have to make sure that the 5.5 and 5.6 versions are both rendering to the same sized framebuffer. If they aren't that could account for the difference. If they are, you're probably seeing general optimizations unity makes that we are better able to leverage using the native integration.\n\nI would not expect any performance changes specific to Google VR going from 5.6 to 2017, but of course various parts of Unity get faster and slower.. You should use unity 5.6 or later, which has a native integration and\nremoves the need for a Google unity activity entirely.\nOn Sep 13, 2017 8:35 AM, \"Quentin Lengele\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHi,\nIs there a way to extend this Android Activity?\nCan we have access to the classes.jar of the GoogleVR SDK?\nI would like to develop a android plugin that extends Extending\ncom.google.unity.UnityPlayerActivity because my plugin has to be the main\nactivity.\nThank you for your response.\nQ.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/issues/723, or mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ANamfuhp4db3IR8ikWgdYtkDc95UaC-Zks5sh_Y2gaJpZM4PWT0P\n.\n.

This is actually expected. The 6P is not, technically, a Daydream ready device. It had to be flagged that way during pre-release development (it was our devkit), but it's no longer flagged as Daydream Ready in O.. @delphinius81, pairing a viewer requires talking to a web service to get the configuration data. Does your test device not have internet access? . You just need to make the node that follows the player a parent of the camera, not the same game object as the camera.. The Zenphone 2 is not a Daydream Ready phone, so it can only run app sin cardboard mode.. That's correct. The GVR plugin does this work at the native level and cannot be overridden. We have no plans to support GVR with ARKit, so closing this issue.. I'm sorry, but we can only give support for the latest version of the SDK, which is 1.70. Please give that a try and re-open this post if you still have issues..

I'm sorry to report that the GVR Video Player is not yet supported on Cardboard at this time.. The GVR Unity Video plugin only supports Daydream at this time.  We will update our documentation accordingly.  In the meantime, here is a site that discusses various video plugins for Unity.  http://blog.soom.la/2015/07/top-10-unity-video-plugins.html.

Ah, i see the issue now.  Your video is 360 mono, not stereo.  The shader used in the demo app is configured by default to render top-bottom stereo video like this: http://youtu.be/LKsUxHASFBs\nTo use mono video you'll need to edit the SteroPanoSphereMaterial on the Sphere game object and set the \"Render Stereo Video\" value to 0.. I got your video to play correctly in the video demo by just changing the \"Render Stereo Video\" setting in the StereoPanoSphereMaterial shader settings to 0.\n\n. The feature to remove this overlay has been removed from the latest versions of Unity and the GVR SDK for Unity.. We are looking into open sourcing the video plugin.  What is your timeframe?  It might be faster to roughly outline how the video plugin works so you could implement it in your existing ExoPlayer codebase.. Let me write something up for you.  I'll try to get that jotted down this week.  This will definitely grow your Java and Android experience.. Source code will be available in the next release, coming soon.. The code is available in the latest release.. There are three binary pieces to the GVR video plugin:\n\nGoogleVR/Plugins/Android/gvr-exoplayersupport-release.aar is the Java portion of the GVR video plugin that interfaces with ExoPlayer.  This is where the bulk of the plugin logic lives.  This code lives in native_libs/gvr-exoplayersupport.\nGoogleVR/Plugins/Android/libs/armeabi-v7a/libgvrvideo.so is largely a C wrapper around the Java portion.  This wrapper is a far more efficient way to access the Java portion from Unity, as Unity's Java integration is known to be quite slow and generates a fair amount of C# garbage that will trigger the garbage collector.  This code lives in native_libs/video_plugin.\nexoplayer-r1.5.11.aar is the ExoPlayer library, pulled directly from JCenter.\n\nIf you want to change any behavior without changing any of the existing C# interfaces, you can do that just within the Java gvr-exoplayersupport.  If you want to add or change any of the interfaces to C#, you will need to do that in the C/C++ video_plugin.\nTo add your udp support, you may likely be able to do that entirely in the Java gvr-exoplayersupport by parsing the url string passed through to it to handle it differently.  I think that can be done here.. The steps you listed are the same steps I've used when working on the plugin.  I wrote some scripts that automate some of that process to speed it up, but the steps are the same.  We do not have a non-Unity Android app project to test the plugin.. I'm not familiar enough with the UdpDataSource class to know what is going wrong here without reproducing it myself, which, unfortunately, I don't have the available resources to do.  I'd add debugging code to see when these are created, with what url, and when they are released to see if the connections are closing properly.  Looks like something (maybe a previous playback?) is still using some address?. VR head-tracking is now built-in to Unity 5.6 and later.  Add VR SDKs in Player Settings and your main camera will be head-tracked and render in stereo.. What you describe is called Magic Window, where there is head tracking without stereo rendering.  This is no longer possible with GoogleVR native integration into Unity.  You will need to use Google VR SDK for Unity v1.40 in order to do Magic Window.. What version of Unity and the GVR SDK for Unity are you using?  Can you reproduce this with the latest GVR SDK for Unity?. Feel free to reopen this issue if you are still experiencing it.. The Camera Target Eye solution should still work for current versions of the GVR SDK and Unity.. This is a known issue with the GvrVideoPlayerTexture on older chipsets that we are working on resolving, likely to be in the 1.60 release.. The fix for this went out in the 1.60 release.. If your customer is reporting that Cardboard Design Lab works well, but your app doesn't, this no longer sounds like a device-specific issue, but an app-specific issue.  Without knowing what your app is doing, it is difficult to speculate on what the root cause is.  I would suggest using the Unity profiler to examine your app's performance.. Unfortunately, we're only able to address issues with the GVR SDK for Unity and aren't able to address all device-specific issues.. This should be fixed in the latest release of the GVR SDK for Unity.. Can you reproduce this with a project with just the GVR SDK for Unity and the GVR Demo scene?  Can you send me the Xcode project that is producing this error? . This is a known issue in Unity 5.6.1 on iOS that does not occur in Unity 5.6.0f3 (or p3).  Unity is aware of the issue and will be releasing a fix in the neat future.. Is this still an issue with the latest SDK v1.100.1?. The video plugin has been developed and tested primarily for Daydream and Daydream-ready devices, and as such is what we offer full support for.  However, it does work in Cardboard on some Android devices, but has issues on others.  Also, there is no support for iOS.  These issues may or may not be resolved in a future update, so beware of trying to use it in a Cardboard app.. What version of the GVR SDK for Unity are you using?. Did you open the .xcodeproj file or the .xcworkspace file when opening the project in Xcode?. Do you see this in your xcode project navigator?\n\n. This should be fixed now.. Where are you getting this error?  It is not possible to finish building a Unity iOS app from Windows. A Mac is required to finish the build with Xcode.  Are you getting this error on Windows or Mac?  Can you post more details about the error?. Our documentation has been updated.. If you are still experiencing this issue, feel free to reopen with more details.. If you are still experiencing this issue, feel free to reopen with more details.. I'm taking over as lead on the GVR Unity SDK from miraleung.  I'm getting this integrated now.. Fixed in the LICENSE file.. Are you still experiencing this issue?. Are you still experiencing this with 5.6 or later and a recent version of the SDK?. Also, GVR Audio is now deprecated and will be removed from the GVR SDK for Unity in a future release.  GVR Audio has been replaced by Resonance Audio.  There is a migration guide to assist you with the transition.. GvrAudio is now deprecated by Resonance Audio.  If you are still experiencing this issue, feel free to file it with the Resonance Audio issue tracker.. The video plugin is only supported on Daydream devices.  It may work in cardboard on some Android devices, but there is no support for it on iOS at this time.. Switching VR modes at runtime is covered here: https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/wiki/Switching-between-VR-and-non-VR-at-runtime. Duplicate of https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/issues/703.. It is no longer possible to do this with the Cardboard native integration since Unity 5.6 due to Unity no longer handling the final rendering to screen, rather the GoogleVR subsystem is now responsible for it and does not provide for this functionality.. The exit VR button is provided by Google VR services and is present for all GVR apps, Unity or otherwise.  We don't allow customizing the non-VR chrome around the VR eye viewports. . I tried your project out and I'm not sure I understand what the problem is.  I built it with 5.6.4p2 and ran on a Pixel XL running Android 8.0.0 and it appears to work properly. I'm not seeing the stretched video in non-VR mode.  Can you describe the problem in more detail?. I'm still not sure I see the problem.  By horizontally stretched I would think I would see the aspect ratio incorrect--  people look \"fat\" or extra wide -- but the images you posted look like they're the correct aspect ratio.  If the problem is that it looks \"zoomed\", like you see less of the field of view than you did in VR mode, then you can adjust the camera's fieldOfView parameter to make it wider.  Unfortunately, it appears that the field of view setting on the camera in Unity Editor GUI doesn't 'stick' when you exit VR mode, rather it defaults to 60\u00ba regardless of what you set in Editor.  So you have to set it in C#.  I added this to your ToggleVR script:\nC#\n    Camera.main.ResetAspect();\n    Camera.main.fieldOfView = 100;\nAnd got this result:\n\nIs that more of what you were expecting?. Did this resolve your issue?. Try with the latest patch release of 2017.2.  It worked for me, as do all of the latest patch released of 5.6 and 2017.x.. No, the GvrVideoPlayerTexture is only formally supported on Daydream, tho it may work in Android Cardboard on some Android devices.\nThere are other video player texture plugins for Unity you can explore, 3rd party and Unity's built-in video player component.. A GVR Audio engineer is looking into this now.. This should be fixed with the most recent versions of Unity 5.6 and 2017.1+ (5.6.4f1 and 2017.1.2f1).. Alternatively, opening a terminal window and running pod update inside the generate Xcode workspace directory, to update to the latest lib GVR, will also fix this issue if you absolutely cannot upgrade your version of Unity.. This is now fixed in the publicly released 2017.2.0f3.. I'm unable to reproduce this issue with 2017.3b4.  Are you able to reproduce this issue with the GVRDemo in the GoogleVR SDK on 2017.3b4?  If so, what is the specific failure mode you're seeing?. By failure mode, I mean how do you know it is failing?  What message?  Can you share all of the details of the error log?\nCan you try with the latest 2017.3 beta 7?. Can you file a bug with Unity on this issue from the Unity Editor?. Thank you for the Unity bug.\nGoogleVR has no plans at this time to deliver the iOS Cardboard SDK as something other than a CocoaPod.  This issue needs to be addressed by Unity in the Cloud Build service.. A fix for this is also coming to Unity 5.6.x.. The fix for this issue requires Unity 5.6.4p1, 2017.1.2p1, and 2017.2.0f3 and VR Services 1.10.172754103 or later.. You can also now upgrade to the latest Google VR SDK for Unity (v1.110) which has the Android GVR lib v1.101 embedded in the .unitypackage.  This embedded GVR lib has the fix in it and should work even if the user hasn't upgraded their VR Services.. We're taking a look into this issue.  Thanks for the report.. Are you using single- or multi-pass rendering in your player settings?. With the native support for Daydream/Cardboard in Unity 5.6 and beyond, there is no longer a need for GVRViewerMain, you simply configure the VR SDK in Player Settings > Other Settings > Virtual Reality SDKs: add Daydream and/or Cardboard as appropriate for your project.  Your main camera will automatically become a VR camera.  The GVR Unity SDK (since v1.40) no longer supports versions of Unity older than 5.6.. We will update our tutorials and documentation accordingly.  Thank you for pointing this out.. You can also write a custom shader for your stereo image that selects different regions of the source image based on eye index.  The gvr video shader has this capability:\nhttps://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/blob/27666a66e54427758c8a6aaa6701084ffd456cff/Assets/GoogleVR/Shaders/Video/VideoUnlitShader.shader#L60\nThis is probably going to be the most efficient implementation of stereo image rendering.  No extra cameras or special culling.. Here's a somewhat simpler example written in CG instead of GLSL:\nhttps://github.com/googlevr/media-app-template/blob/1c6d13e77b4b6f01fc4fe2864276f1e3d5ca03bb/Assets/MediaAppTemplate/Shaders/MediaScreen.shader#L56\n. Yeah, the shader lab stuff is daunting at first glance, but super satisfying when you figure it out and make some really powerful stuff.  Totally worth taking the time to climb the learning curve.  And there's plenty of shader code out and about on the internet in source code form to learn from.  If you start feeling super saucy with shaders, check out https://www.shadertoy.com/.  That place make my head asplode.. We're still waiting on driver support from the GPU vendors.. Unfortunately, the issue is more complicated than if the Android platform supports linear colorspace.  With VR, the Unity app isn't rendering directly to the screen where it would be able to configure linear colorspace mode directly on the framebuffer it allocated itself.  Instead, Unity is given a framebuffer allocated by VR Services (out of process in some circumstances) that is under different, driver-limiting constraints that prevent the configuration of linear color space mode.. There are a variety of issues with Unity's Single-Pass rendering.  Please file a bug with Unity through the Unity Editor to escalate this issue.. I believe this has been fixed in the most recent beta of 2017.2.  Please try that and let me know if it resolves your issue.. I just learned the fix isn't in a publicly available beta yet.  It is expected to be in 2017.2.0b6.. This should be fixed in the latest version of Unity 2017.2.. Why do you want to disable the settings button?  We strongly discourage doing this as this gives users access to general VR settings and is not visible to users when wearing a headset.. Did you open the .xcodeproj or .xcworkspace file?. What version of Unity?  What version of the GVR Unity SDK?. Thanks for bringing this up.  We'll take a look.. That invalid enum error is a red herring and occurs even when the video plugin works properly on Pixel devices.. Yes, the video player pipeline was redone in 1.70 to remove a buffer copy step that had previously been done in a native plugin to get the video buffers into a form Unity could use.  Now the GLSLProgram is able to use video buffers directly from the decoder without the copy step, improving performance and battery life.\nI just tried the Video Demo scene in the SDK built with 5.6 and 2017.1 on Samsung S8+, Android 7.0 and am unable to reproduce the issue.\n@sujay46, that logcat suggests the shader didn't compile properly on your device.  Can you give me any more information about the device?  What country was it purchased in?  What version of Android is it running?  What API level are you targeting in Unity?\n. Could you run this adb command and report back the output:\nadb shell getprop ro.build.fingerprint. @sandorvasas could you send me your android build fingerprint?  I've so far been unable to reproduce on both the Qualcomm and Exynos versions of the Samsung S8 and S8+.\n@sujay46 that version of Android should be supporting the needed extensions to support the video player.  Could you send me the project (with project settings) you created to reproduce the issue?. The video plugin is not guaranteed to work on non-Daydream-ready devices, like the S6.  I'm much more able to assist in debugging issues with the video plugin on a Daydream-ready device, like the S8.  If I can get my hands on an S6, I'll try to debug this issue, but no guarantees.. Great suggestion.  We're integrating something like this now.. Could you try replacing instances of Time.deltaTime in GvrReticlePointer.cs with Time.unscaledDeltaTime and see if that addresses your issue?. Good to know.  We'll get this fixed in the next release.. This is now fixed in v1.170.. This is working as intended.  Only the Daydream VR SDK is supported in Editor.. What version of the GVR SDK for Unity are you using?  I believe this issue no longer exists in the latest SDK.. This now sounds like a dupe of https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/issues/778. I'm not sure I understand the question.  What are you seeing on your Android device when you run your app?. Could you post a screenshot of what your app is doing?. The github repo is not a fully functional repo of the plugin.  It is meant to be used for reference.  Please use the .unitypackage in your Unity projects.. I just pushed the .metas.. GoogleVR doesn't support low-persistence display outside of fullscreen VR.  If it used to work it was unintentional.. Some things to try:\n\u2022 Upgrade to GoogleVR for Unity plugin v1.70\n\u2022 Use Android API level 24\n\u2022 If you're using Unity 5.6.x you'll need android-sdk-macosx-25.2.5 you can download the old version http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/tools_r25.2.5-macosx.zip\n\u2022 Make sure your Android dependencies (AARs / JARs etc.) are up to date.\n\u2022 Delete Plugins/Android/\n\u2022 Import the GVR and Firebase plugins again to restore what you deleted.\n\u2022 Select \"Assets > Play Services Resolver > Android Resolver > Resolve Client Jars\"\n. We have fixed this issue in the next release of the SDK.  You can safely remove the entire #if UNITY_EDITOR block in your local copy to work around the issue until the next release.. The volume buttons should be fixed for Cardboard in Unity 5.6.3f1, 2017.1.1f1, and 2017.2.0f3.. We are working with Unity to resolve this issue.. This is now fixed in Unity 2017.1.2p4, 2017.2.1f1, 2017.3.0f2.  A patch for 5.6 is coming as well.. Are you still experiencing this issue?  If so, can you try with the latest release v1.110?. If you are still experiencing this issue, please reopen.. What version of the SDK are you using?  Can you post a logcat snippet of the error and 10-20 lines before it?. Happy to hear everything is good now.. Fixed in v1.110.. This is a duplicate of https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/issues/665.  See that issue for a workaround until the proper fix is pushed live.. What version of Unity did this occur with?. We're working on a fix now.. Fixed in 1.100.1.. This is expected to be fixed in 2017.2.0p1.. Is this still an issue?. The gvr-instant-preview repo has been removed since IP now lives in the gvr-unity-sdk.  Could you detail your issues here?. This issue is resolved in the public release of 2017.2f3.. This is a known issue with 2017.2f3 and will be fixed in 2017.2p1 due out soon.. Unity will auto-upgrade the code in the GVR SDK for Unity to UnityEngine.XR.  When you import the package into Unity, a dialog will appear:\n\nClick \"I Made a Backup. Go Ahead!\"\nWe will look into avoiding this dialog in a future release.\n. Unity prompts me to upgrade those call sites at build time.  Does it not for you?\nWe are working on a proper fix to this issue as well.. There is also a new Unity command-line argument in 2017.2: '-accept-apiupdate' which will accept the API upgrades when run in headless mode.. This should be fixed in Unity as of 5.6.3f1 and 2017.1.1f1.. Can you try with 5.6.4f1?  I'm able to use the volume buttons with a Cardboard app built with 5.6.4f1.. This is fixed in Unity 2017.1.2f1.. Do you have an AndroidManifest.xml file in your project somewhere?  That is where that classname would be specified.  You do not need an AndroidManifest.xml file just to support Daydream and Cardboard.. The GVR platform team has traced this to a potential driver issue.  We're investigating a workaround at the VR Services level.. Yes, it is a driver issue.  Our platform team is working with the driver vendor and also trying to develop a workaround they could release in VR Services.  I'll post updates here as they develop.. It's triggered by either order or timing of GL operations.  That's what our platform folks are looking into.. We've narrowed the issue down quite a bit and hope to have a fix soon.  The fix will go out in VR Services, so there will be nothing for you to update when the fix is ready.  Users will just need the updated VR Services to prevent the crash.  When the release goes out, we will post the fixed version number here and if you need, you can have your app check the VR Services version and intent to the Play Store to update VR Services if it doesn't have the fix.. We have a fix for this in Google VR Services that is due out in January.  There will be a quick follow release of the GVR SDK for Unity that will have an embedded lib GVR that will also have the fix in it allowing devs to not worry whether users have taken an update to VR Services.. The VR Services fix is now due out in February.. I'm looking into this now.. I assume you have started with this document: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/VRDevices-GoogleVRVideoAsyncReprojection.html\nThe sample C# code doesn't copy the rotation of the video screen object into the transform passed into setVideoLocationTransform().  Replace the matrix (wm) calculation code with this instead:\nC#\n    Matrix4x4 wm = transform.localToWorldMatrix;\n    wm = Camera.main.transform.parent.worldToLocalMatrix * wm;\n    wm = wm * Matrix4x4.Scale(new Vector3(0.5f, 0.5f, 1));\n. Please reopen this issue if that does not fix your issue.. How are you moving the camera?  Are you moving the main camera itself or are you moving the main camera's parent?. The problem with using the camera's transform is that the camera's position is not GVR's origin.  The camera's position is offset from GVR's origin by a neck model.  If you derive the video transform direct from the camera, there will be a small misalignment of the edges of the video quad from the neck model offset.  The way to get the screen transform to line up is to parent your main camera under another game object and move that parent game object around your scene.  That way, the neck model will be applied relative to that parent game object and the screen to camera parent offset will stay correct and aligned.  All of the GVR demo scenes are configured this way, with the main camera underneath a Player game object.. Glad you got it working.. There is experimental support for x86 devices in the latest release.. This should be fixed in Unity 5.6.4p1, 2017.1.2p1, and 2017.2.0f3.  This fix also requires VR Services 1.10.172754103 or later.. Yes, either by having the latest VR Services (vrcore) or GVR SDK for Unity v1.110 or later.. If the app has been built with v1.110 or later then yes, it does not matter which version of VR Services has been installed.. The Instant Preview version mismatch issue has been resolved in the latest release of the GVR SDK for Unity.. Do you get that warning on every Play in editor?  It is expected to warn the first time.. That's odd.  Glad it is working for you now.\nAs an aside, we recommend upgrading to Unity 2017.2.0p1 for Daydream development, as it has a fix for the Daydream controller freeze after app background/foreground.. Can you reproduce this with an empty Unity project with just the GVR SDK for Unity and the GVRDemo scene?. Interesting.  Could you send me a sample project that reproduces the issue, or can you examine your project for key differences between it and the demo?. I think you've got this going now, so I'm going to close this out.  If you continue to have issues with this, please reopen the bug.. @dgoodine, are you able to reproduce this with a new empty project and importing the GoogleVR SDK package?. Did you delete the Assets/GoogleVR dir before importing the GoogleVR package?. This issue comes from poor sensors in the phone.. Dupe of https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/issues/767. We are looking into this issue.. This will be fixed in the next release of the SDK.. Can you share a repro project for us to look at?. This is a dupe of https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/issues/748. Are you still experiencing this issue?. Closing.  If this is still an issue, please reopen.. We're taking a look.. I assume this has fixed your issue.  If not, please reopen this issue.. Can you send a simple project that reproduces the issue?. Feel free to reopen this issue if you're still experiencing it.. If you're doing Daydream development, we recommend you update to the latest 2017.2.0 patch release as 2017.2.0f3 has an issue where the Daydream controller will stop working after background > foreground.. We are investigating non-quad surface projections for video, but we don't have a timeline for when that work will be available.  We will have to work with Unity to bring these new features up to availability in Unity.\nThe low level does support single stereo video streams, but we're still working with Unity to bring this functionality up to the Unity level.. did you set the active platform to Android?  instant preview doesn't work\nwhen targeting anything other than Android.\n. @sterlingcrispin, I wrote a build processor script that should alleviate this issue of having the Oculus Utilities package installed in a project that supports Oculus and Daydream.  \nDrop it in an Editor folder.  At build time, it will check current VR SDKs and disable GoogleVR or Oculus native plugins that aren't needed for the current VR SDKs.  It will re-enable the plugins at the end of the build.\nThis appears to work for me on a Galaxy S8.  Please give it a go.. Thanks.  We will take a look.. Closing.  If this is still an issue, please reopen.. This should be fixed in Daydream Home now.. What particular version of Unity 2017.1 are you using?. Can you try installing CocoaPods (if you haven't already), close the Xcode project in Xcode, and from the command line, in the generated Xcode project folder, run pod update.  Then try build and run your app from Xcode.. Oh, could you try updating to Unity 2017.1.2 and see if that fixes it without needing to do the pod update?  It should have a version of GVR native iOS that should be compatible with GVR SDK for Unity 1.110.. The Unity upgrade should be the easiest, workflow-wise.  The POD update can get annoying when you have to do it every time you have Unity recreate the Xcode project from scratch.. Happy to hear you've got it working.. On Android devices that fully support instanced single-pass rendering, Unity automatically uses instanced single-pass rendering.  However, there are many devices whose instanced single-pass rendering has bugs that prevent it from working properly.  Daydream automatically detects devices with full support for instanced single-pass rendering and enables it accordingly.. Yes, in Player Settings for iOS, under Player Settings for iOS > XR Settings > VR SDKs > Cardboard, click the triangle to get more Cardboard settings.  There you will find an Enable Transition View checkbox to control the showing of the transition screen.\n\n. Thanks for the report.  We'll take a look.. This is a known issue that is being worked on at the platform level.. This should be fixed on the Lenovo Mirage Solo devices, but will have to wait for Android P to come to smartphone Daydream devices.. We were unable to get this fix into Android P.  Casting with audio from Unity VR apps, for now, is only supported on the Mirage Solo.. This bug has been fixed in the latest release of the SDK.  Sadly, it no longer supports Unity 5.4.2.. I'm not familiar with that plugin, but if it launches any 2D activities to accomplish sign-in, which I suspect it does, you will not be able to use this entirely from within VR.  Our permissions demo in the SDK demonstrates the best practice for managing a VR > 2D > VR flow.. Not currently for in VR, native or engine, no.  I suggest filing a feature request with the Google signin  repo.. I'm sorry your upgrade process was so unpleasant.  Is there a specific issue you would like assistance with?\nWe won't be providing any support for old versions of the SDK at this time.. Can you send me a Unity project that reproduces the issue?  I'm not able to diagnose this problem from a single image.. Sounds like you have a solution.  Please reopen if you need further assistance with this.. I'll try to find someone who can help you with this issue.. You can achieve the same effect by placing the object you want to do tracked manipulation with as a child of the Main Camera, then attach a script to the object and in it's Update method do this:\nC#\ntransform.localRotation = Quaternion.Inverse(Camera.main.transform.localRotation);\nIf you want the lighting to be fixed to the camera, move your lights to be children of the main camera as well.. Happy to hear.. I'm sorry to say that we don't support that version of Unity or that version of the GoogleVR SDK for Unity anymore.  Are you at all able to use more recent versions of Unity and the GVR SDK?. You'll need to edit the shader to add this functionality.  I did this by editing VideoUnlitShader.shader in the GVR SDK for Unity and making the following changes:\nFirst, enable alpha blending by adding a new line after the line containing Cull off:\nBlend SrcAlpha OneMinusSrcAlpha\nThen changed the fragment shader inside #ifdef FRAGMENT block to look like this:\nGLSL\n  void main() {\n    vec4 color = gammaCorrect(texture2D(_MainTex, uv), _Gamma);\n    color.a = (color.r + color.g + color.b) * 10.0;\n    gl_FragColor = color;\n  }\nYou can fiddle with that 10.0 value to adjust the sharpness of the black cutout.  Increase it to narrow the black threshold.. Excellent!  Happy to hear it is working for you now.. In that thread this comment says that single-pass rendering has been disabled on Pixel + Android 8.0.0, but should be enabled in Android 8.1.0.. Looks good.  Can you make a pull request and agree to the CLA?. Thank you. This change has been accepted and merged into our internal repo and will be released in a future release.. Fixed in v1.120.. Thank you.  This change has been accepted and merged into our internal repo and will be released in a future release.. This should do what you want.. Please reopen and comment if you need any further assistance with this issue.. Fixed in v1.130.. Unfortunately, GoogleVR for Unity does not support x86 devices, only arm devices.. There is experimental support for x86 devices in the latest release.. Sadly, there is no way to enable head tracking in non-VR mode without triggering VR transition screens, even though you're not using VR mode.  We're working on a solution to this issue.. Can you run adb bugreport right after the issue occurs and post the bugreport file here?. Are you sure you're using GVR SDK for Unity 1.130.1?  We fixed the leaked ServiceConnection issue in that release.  I'm only able to reproduce it with 1.120, but not 1.130.1.. That's interesting.  Do you have the Oculus VR SDK enabled as well as Daydream?. This fix should be out in the next three weeks.  \nThe permissions flow works seamlessly on the Mirage Solo if you are using the latest GVR SDK for Unity.. Next release is in testing, expected release in two weeks.. This is now fixed in the latest release.. It may be a while before SRP Lightweight pipeline is useable on all Daydream devices, given that there are driver-level issues with some devices and Android versions that can only be resolved by the handset manufacturer shipping an update that resolves the issues.  Daydream Standalone devices, like the Lenovo Mirage Solo, should support it going forward, tho.. Sorry for the late reply, our platform engineers aren't aware of anything that would cause this.  A couple of things to try:\n1. Build your app with and without Cardboard support (working and broken apks), use apktool to disassemble each of the apks and compare each's AndroidManifest.xml to see if something is being added/removed to cause this.\n1. Try building for Cardboard and run on a non-Daydream ready device, like a Nexus 5 or 6, Samsung S6 and see if you're able to reproduce the issue.  If not (BTLE works great with and without Cardboard) then this could point to some poor interaction with the Daydream's usage of BTLE for the controller, even when in Cardboard mode.. Could you try the workaround suggested in this comment?. This should be fixed in v1.130.1.. We actually do plan to integrate this fix soon.. This is actually a dupe of issue 917, which was fixed in v1.150.. We've partially fixed this in the latest release.. This required an API change, and as such, is not likely to get a back port to 2017.4.. Now released.. You are right.  It shouldn't crash.  We'll address this oversight in an upcoming release.. @suchitabohra, the screenshot you posted is correctly rendered for the small screen of your iPhone.  Cardboard headsets have been designed for larger screens, so on smaller screens like yours the projection geometry mismatch means the distortion renderer maps to an asymmetric projection like you see here.  That should look fine when you put it in a headset and look through it.. The GvrVideoPlayerTexture doesn't work in Editor, only on device.  GetRenderEventFunc is additionally defined for Android devices as:\nC#\n  [DllImport(dllName)]\n  private static extern IntPtr GetRenderEventFunc();\nThis calls into the video plugin's native lib.  This shouldn't be blocking in either Editor or on device.  The native code simply returns a pointer and does nothing else that would block.\nCan you send me your Unity project that reproduces your issue so I can see what other project settings you have configured?. Closing this for now, since a viable workaround is easy to create.. Yes, unfortunately, Android doesn't support AC3 decode.  The easiest thing to do is to convert your video file's audio track to AAC before loading it on your device.  If you'd like your app to do the conversion, that will be a much more involved engineering task to embed ffmpeg into your app.  Unfortunately, we are unable to assist with that endeavor.. Please reopen if you can provide a sample project to reproduce the issue.. GvrVideoPlayerTexture is only supported on Android devices.. It should be Landscape Left set in Unity, which should then generate an Xcode project configured for that setting.  Could you share a project that crashes so I can compare against our reference project?. GVR is designed to be launched in landscape left orientation only. Landscape right is not a supported configuration.. Thanks for reporting this.  We'll take a look.. Did you set the AA setting on the correct Quality Level for iOS?  At the top of the QualitySettings inspector are several Levels.  Make sure the Level with the green checkbox below the iOS icon is selected before setting the AA level.\n\n. If this is still an issue, please comment.. If you have a GvrReticlePointer in your scene, you can get the trigger down from this property:\nC#\n   GvrPointerInputModule.Pointer.TriggerDown\n. Unfortunately, the Zenphone 2 is an x86 based phone, and GoogleVR is not supported on x86 devices.. There is experimental support for x86 devices in the latest release.. This will be fixed in 1.130.. In the meantime, you can work around the issue by adding this to the body of the GvrBuildProcessor class:\n```C#\nif UNITY_2018_1_OR_NEWER\npublic void OnPreprocessBuild(BuildReport report) {\n    OnPreprocessBuild(report.summary.platform, report.summary.outputPath);\n  }\nendif\n```\n. Fixed in v1.130.. Fixed in the latest release.. This is now fixed in the latest release.. Unfortunately, the ASUS Zenfone 2 is an x86 based device and the GVR SDK for Unity doesn't support x86 based devices.  The Cardboard app is based on an older version of GoogleVR that did support x86 devices.  You might still be able to build a Unity Cardboard app with SDK version 1.40.. There is experimental support for x86 devices in the latest release.. What are you using to play video in VR?. What Unity component are you configuring to play your video?  Is it Unity's built-in Video Player component, GvrVideoPlayerTexture, or some third party video player from the Asset Store?. Could you send me a before and after apk that we can profile?. I took a look at your apps, and the main thing that jumps out at me is the use of the h.265 video codec which is known to have poor performance on Pixel devices and a variety of other Android devices.  I would advise you encode your video in h.264 instead.  I'm not sure why the performance was better with 1.40 of the GVR SDK.  We made changes in 1.70 that eliminated an extra video frame copy from the rendering pipeline that resulted in performance gains with all of the (h.264) content we tested with.  Obviously, something is poorly interacting with your video with this new code path.  My experience with h.265 on Android makes me think you would get better framerate with h.264 video.. Now released.. This sounds like a device specific issue, likely poorly calibrated motion sensors.  Sadly, there isn't anything we can do about it at the GVR or SDK level.. No, this is a GVR system service.. We're working with Unity to get this addressed.. This is now fixed in Unity 2017.4.4f1, 2018.1.2f1, and 2018.2.0b4.. You can enable head tracking on a camera by settings its Target Eye setting to Both.\n\n. Oh, the player game object will not rotate with the camera.  Your game will have to use the rotation from the main camera in your game's player movement logic:  Camera.main.transform.rotation  This does not come for free.  You do not want to apply this rotation to the player game object, otherwise it will apply the head rotation twice.  You only want to use this rotation in your movement logic.. What device does this occur on?  Can you post a repro project?  Looks like a project or texture setting isn't right.. Did this solve your issue?. Can you send me a sample project to debug?. C#\n  GvrDaydreamApi.LaunchVrHomeAsync(Action<bool> callback);. A fix is on the way.. Fixed in v1.130.1.. Can you post a link to a sample project we can debug?. That project builds and runs without crashing for me in 2017.3.1f1, Xcode 9.2, iPhone 6s, iOS 11.2.2.. The Load XXX PNG buttons don't seem to do anything when I tap them.\nNow testing with 2017.3.1p4, Xcode 9.2, iPhone 7, iOS 11.2.6.\nLogs show initializing GVR version 1.100.0.  I did not do a pod update.  Just ran stock, tried both Release and Debug builds out of Xcode.. Scratch, that, i thought the squares were the buttons.  I repro'd the crash.. If I remove the Assets/GoogleVR folder entirely, the load PNG from WWW works, but not the load from file.  Disabling VR SDKs gets the load from file to work.  Even VR SDKs enabled, but with None then Cardboard (so it doesn't launch in VR mode) but still has all the GVR libs in it will cause the app to crash.  Very strange.. Verified GVR SDK version regression.  Using 2017.1.3f1, I do not see the crash with a build direct from Unity.  If I then run pod update to update the GVRSDK pod from 1.80 to 1.120, it will crash.. Unity and Google are working to resolve this issue in an upcoming release.  In the meantime, here is a workaround patch to resolve the issue. To apply the patch on Mac:\n\nOpen your Unity project, and build a new iOS app as usual - which should generate the corresponding Xcode project.\nClose the Xcode project (if open already), and make sure you backup its contents, as the scripts will directly modify the library & project files in the Pods folder.\nDownload and copy the attached script into the root folder of the generated Xcode project, i.e., the folder that contains the .xcodeproj file and the Pods folder (will be referred as $XCODE_PROJ_FOLDER below).\nOpen Terminal, then run the following:\ncd $XCODE_PROJ_FOLDER\n    chmod +x fixgvrunityios.sh\n    ./fixgvrunityios.sh\nOnce finished, open the Xcode project to build and run the iOS app. The new app should run as expected without any crashes now.\n\nPlease note that running this patch is required once, every time you generate a new Xcode project through Unity.. This is now fixed in Unity 2017.2.2p3, 2017.4.1f1, and 2018.1.0f1.  The fix is on its way to an upcoming patch to 2017.1.. now fixed in 2017.1.3p4.. The GvrVideoPlayerTexture component is not officially supported for Cardboard, only Daydream-ready devices.  It may work on some Android Cardboard devices, but it is known to not work on some.  I don't have any Mediatek devices on hand to test with.  If you could post a logcat from your running app, I could try to debug the issue for you.. Please reopen this issue if you'd like further help.. Yeah, the CocoaPods are for entirely native iOS code, not Unity plugins.  The Unity plugin doesn't come with a podspec and I don't believe there is a way to override the Unity built-in.  Unity has a copy of the entire GVR iOS CocoaPod embedded in it so that iOS Unity developers don't need to have CocoaPods installed in order to build for iOS.  AFAIK, there is no way for us to override that in our plugin.. I'm not sure that this is even possible.  Unity has a copy of the GVR CocoaPod embedded in it that it copies into Cardboard iOS builds so that developers don't need to have CocoaPods installed.  Adding a podspec to the GVR SDK for Unity won't change what version of the pod ends up in iOS.  Developers will need to have CocoaPods installed on their system and then run pod update after Unity generates the Xcode project to get an updated version of the GVR CocoaPod, and this process doesn't need an updated spec, as the podfile included in Unity specifies version or newer, allowing newer versions to be installed on pod update.. Does the pod update step not get you the latest iOS CocoaPod?  It should.  The latest is still 1.120, tho.  There was no 1.130 release for iOS this cycle.. Ah good, pod update is working.\nThere are separate releases for the platform SDKs (Android and iOS) and the engine SDKs (Unity and Unreal).  Usually platform SDKs both release in sync, but this cycle iOS was skipped for reasons.  Engine SDK releases usually trail by a couple of weeks.  Unreal is lagging Unity a bit this cycle for reasons.. @Moncader, could you try adding to your generated Xcode project's Info.plist file the CFBundleLocalizations key with this contents:\nXML\n  <array>\n    <string>en</string>\n    <string>he</string>\n    <string>ar</string>\n    <string>zh</string>\n    <string>zh_CN</string>\n    <string>zh_TW</string>\n    <string>fr</string>\n    <string>de</string>\n    <string>it</string>\n    <string>ja</string>\n    <string>ko</string>\n    <string>en</string>\n    <string>af</string>\n    <string>ru</string>\n    <string>bg</string>\n    <string>ca</string>\n    <string>da</string>\n    <string>es</string>\n    <string>et</string>\n    <string>fe</string>\n    <string>gl</string>\n    <string>hr</string>\n    <string>hu</string>\n    <string>id</string>\n    <string>lt</string>\n    <string>lv</string>\n    <string>ms</string>\n    <string>nb</string>\n    <string>nl</string>\n    <string>pl</string>\n    <string>pt</string>\n    <string>ro</string>\n    <string>sk</string>\n    <string>sl</string>\n    <string>sr</string>\n    <string>sv</string>\n    <string>tr</string>\n  </array>\n. We've got a build processor fix for this issue which will be in the next release.. You can add this snippet of code to GvrBuildProcessor.cs and replace OnPostProcessBuild to have this added every time you build from Unity:\n```C#\n  private readonly string[] SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES_IOS = {\n    \"ar\", \"ca\", \"cs\", \"da\", \"de\", \"el\", \"en\", \"en_AU\", \"en_GB\", \"en_IN\", \"es\", \"es_MX\",\n    \"fi\", \"fr\", \"he\", \"hi\", \"hr\", \"hu\", \"id\", \"it\", \"iw\", \"ja\", \"ko\", \"nb\", \"nl\", \"pl\",\n    \"pt\", \"pt_PT\", \"ro\", \"ru\", \"sk\", \"sv\", \"th\", \"tr\", \"uk\", \"vi\", \"zh_CN\", \"zh_HK\", \"zh_TW\",\n  };\npublic void OnPostprocessBuild(BuildTarget target, string outputPath) {\nif UNITY_IOS\n// Add Camera usage description for scanning viewer QR codes\n// and localization languages on iOS.\nif (target == BuildTarget.iOS) {\n  // Read plist\n  var plistPath = Path.Combine(outputPath, \"Info.plist\");\n  var plist = new PlistDocument();\n  plist.ReadFromFile(plistPath);\n\n  // Update value\n  PlistElementDict rootDict = plist.root;\n  rootDict.SetString(\"NSCameraUsageDescription\", \"Scan Cardboard viewer QR code\");\n\n  var localizations = rootDict.CreateArray(\"CFBundleLocalizations\");\n  foreach (var lang in SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES_IOS) {\n    localizations.AddString(lang);\n  }\n\n  // Write plist\n  File.WriteAllText(plistPath, plist.WriteToString());\n}\n\nendif\n}\n```\nThis will make all of those languages appear in your App Store listing, so edit the SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES_IOS list appropriately for the language support your app will actually deliver.. GvrMain has been deprecated and removed since the native integration of GVR into Unity.  What functionality did you need from it?. Please reopen if you still need help with this issue.. I assume you have a Java plugin for managing your DRM video stream.  Also, if your video is only monoscopic 2D, then you can use Unity's GVR Async Video Reprojection to stream protected video in VR.. Is Daydream screen recording disabled if you check the Enable Video Surface and Use Protected Memory checkboxes under XR Settings > VR SDKs > Daydream?. Hmmm..  the only way to protect video content at the moment is to use the GVR Async Video Reprojection facility in Unity, and due to its lack of support for non-quad projections, there isn't currently a way to prevent screen recording of it that I know of.\nThe secure path exception does seem like an issue.  Could you post a bugreport that captures the Secure Path exception for me to look at?. Unfortunately, not at this time.  I've filed a feature request with our platform team.. You can check GvrControllerInput.Recentered on each frame to see if recentering has just occurred.. Create a Player game object with the desired start position and place the Main camera as a child of this Player object.. Is this just a documentation issue, or is there some additional functionality you're requesting?. I think you're asking about XR.XRSettings.eyeTextureResolutionScale.  This determines the resolution Unity renders into before distortion rendering.  Higher resolution scale will result in higher sharpness, but increased GPU load, higher thermals, and possible lower frame rate.\nIs that what you're looking for?. If you still need help with this issue, please reopen.. We've added a warning in the latest release to help catch this in the future.. Yes.  Unity 2017.3 builds Daydream apps that support 6DoF head tracking by default.  You can control the level of head tracking support in Player Settings > XR Settings:\n\nIf you're using an older version of Unity, you can manually enable it by copying Assets/GoogleVR/Plugins/Android/AndroidManifest-6DOF.xml to Assets/Plugins/Android/AndroidManifest.xml.. We'll get the old release notes back up in the Releases section.. Previous release notes now available in the releases section.. investigating. The left eye flicker is fixed in 2017.2 and newer.  This is the only fix available at this time.  It will not be backported to 2017.1.. For 1) that is the natural result of the headset's field of view being clipped to a small screen.  That is not a bug.  You will see this on screens smaller than a Pixel XL or an iPhone Plus.\nFor 2) I'm unsure how you got that to happen.  What is \"cardboard views\"?. @TonGarcia in Player Settings > Settings for iOS > Resolution and Presentation, are you setting Allowed Orientations for Auto Rotation to \"Landscape Left\" ONLY (disable portrait orientations)?. I am happy to hear you are unblocked now.. If you still need assistance with this issue, please reopen.. Also, do you have the Assets/GoogleVR/Prefabs/Headset/GvrHeadset.prefab in your scene?. Are you able to share a sample Unity project that reproduces the issue?. Ok, if you find something in the GVR SDK that is related to this, please re-open this issue.. This old README has migration steps for upgrading from pre 1.40 SDK to current.  You can use Unity 2017.4 instead of 5.6 and GVR Unity SDK 1.130.1 instead of 1.50.. Yes.  The 1.40 SDK will delete some of the outdated plugin files when you open it in Unity 5.6 or later.  Then importing a new SDK on top of that should work.. You can create multiple cameras and assign them Left/Right Target Eyes.\n\n. If you still need assistance, reply to or reopen this issue.. No issue description here.. I'm unable to reproduce this issue with the same setup.  Are you able to send me a Unity project that reproduces the issue?. GearVR and Daydream devices are able to put their screens into a low-persistence mode which eliminates the blur and other low-level platform integration features allow the lag to be reduced.  Unfortunately, this is not possible on iOS devices, non-Daydream, and non-GearVR devices due to the lack of operating system and hardware support for these features.. Happy to hear you found a solution.. Follow this guide for instructions on building a hybrid VR and non-VR app.. Sorry, I misunderstood the question.  You're building two (or more) separate app packages and at least one of them doesn't target VR at all.  It seems that some of the Gvr C# source is getting pulled into a Unity app build on iOS even if VR Support isn't enabled and no components in the built scene reference any Gvr sources.  \nGiven that we have errors in our build processor, this isn't a configuration we support.  That said, I'm unsure why Unity is pulling in Gvr sources to a build that makes no reference to it at all.  This is outside of our control and you would have to take this issue up with Unity for resolution.\n. Can you run adb shell dumpsys display | grep mBaseDisplayInfo in both 16:9 and 18:9 modes and share that here?. This will be fixed in the next release.. Fixed in latest release.. Thanks for reporting this.  We'll take a look.. We're working on a fix.. For the on-device build, Unity doesn't transform the main camera with the neck model.  The only way to get the neck offset on device is to get the Left and Right eye positions and then get the mid-point between them.\nC#\nusing UnityEngine.XR;\nVector3 pos = Camera.main.transform.parent.TransformPoint(InputTracking.GetLocalPosition(XRNode.LeftEye));\nUnfortunately, XRNode.CenterEye and XRNode.Head report the same no-neck-model position as the main camera on Daydream.. What position is it that you would like to get?. I've dug into this a bit more and it looks like neck model used to be applied to the main camera, XRNode.Head, and XRNode.CenterEye from Unity 5.6 up through 2017.2, but broke in 2017.3 on.\nIn general we do recommend parenting the main camera to a player object.  This is how the HelloVR sample is setup.. This looks like it may be a GoogleVR platform bug.  Neck model offset is only incorrect on Android 8, but not Android 7.  I believe there is a known issue where GVR on Android 8 smartphones falsely reports that it can do positional head tracking.. The missing neck model from on-device builds running on Android 8 is fixed in the upcoming release of Daydream VR Services, due to be available in a week or two via Play Store update.  The missing neck model in Instant Preview is fixed in the upcoming release of the GVR SDK for Unity, due to be available in a few weeks.. Fixed in latest release.. GVR is designed to be launched in landscape left orientation only.  Landscape right is not a supported configuration.. Thanks for reporting this.  This will be fixed in the next release.. This is now fixed in the latest release.. Thanks for reporting this. This will be fixed in the next release.. This is now fixed in the latest release.. I'm unable to reproduce this error with 2018.1.2f1, Visual Studio 2015 Community.  It's odd that you would get that error given that System.Action is defined as:\nC#\n  public delegate void Action();\nmaking it a delegate type already.  Could you have some stale VS state?. Happy to hear this is resolved.. Are you able to reproduce this with the HelloVR sample scene?. Unity should by default build the currently open scene if none are specified in the Build Settings > Scenes In Build.  Did you have the HelloVR scene open in the editor?. Can you verify that Assets/GoogleVR/Plugins/Android/libs/armeabi-v7a/libaudioplugingvrunity.so exists and the Inspector says that it is configured for Android and ARMv7 CPU?. If this is still an issue for you, please comment and re-open.. You will need to create a VR to 2D transition activity and launch that activity when you want to leave VR.  This will involve making a native java plugin in Android Studio that hosts the transition activity code.  Your activity will need to run this little bit of Java in your activity's onCreate:\njava\n    // Prompt the user to remove the headset and get out of VR mode.\n    DaydreamApi daydreamApi = DaydreamApi.create(this);\n    daydreamApi.exitFromVr(this, RC_EXIT_VR, null);\n    daydreamApi.close();\nThis will launch the exit from VR activity that shows that prompt.  When VrCore determines the device is out of the viewer, the activity that called exitFromVr will resume and onActivityResult() for that activity will be called with a return code. Then call finish() to close the transition/login activity and return to the Unity player activity.\nAPI ref:\nhttps://developers.google.com/vr/reference/android/com/google/vr/ndk/base/DaydreamApi.html#exitFromVr(android.app.Activity,%20int,%20android.content.Intent)\nsample code:\nhttps://github.com/googlevr/gvr-android-sdk/blob/a8ec5b54e21a43558e31f0cb2b4c3911443395a1/samples/sdk-video360/src/main/java/com/google/vr/sdk/samples/video360/VrVideoActivity.java#L155. If you still need help with this issue, please reopen and comment.. Can you send me a project that reproduces this issue?. I'm unable to reproduce this with 2018.1.4f1 and our SDK.  Are you able to reproduce this with a new empty project and just the GVR SDK?. The Asus Zenfone 2 ZE551ML is an x86 based device and unfortunately, the GoogleVR SDK for Unity only supports Arm-based devices.. There is experimental support for x86 devices in the latest release.. Teleportation and other GoogleVR best practices have been moved to Daydream Elements.. Yes, that is roughly the same material.  We will update our documentation accordingly.. Google VR developer docs have been updated.. @SJLV-DEV does resetting the aspect ratio of the camera manually solve your issue?. Yes.  In fact, you can just run adb bugreport and then send the resulting zip file.. Not knowing anything about your setup it's hard to provide any assistance.  Additionally, since we don't directly support joystick integration in GVR, you would have to take this issue up with the joystick manufacturer.. Could you try the workaround suggested in this comment?. If neither the manifest change or Force 6DOF developer setting work, then there is something else amiss with your setup.  Can you fill out the following information?\nFound using:\n * Google VR SDK version:\n * Unity version:\n * Phone manufacturer, model, and O/S version:\n * Viewer manufacturer & model:\nSteps to reproduce the issue:\n 1.\n. If some other app does go 6DoF when you force it on, but your app doesn't then something is amiss with your project config.  Can you reproduce this with a clean Unity project with nothing but the GVR SDK for Unity and the HelloVR scene?  If so, can you zip up that project and send it to me?. Thanks for narrowing it down.  We'll dig into it.. Can you please supply the following information:\nFound using:\n * Google VR SDK version:\n * Unity version:\n * Phone manufacturer, model, and O/S version:\n * Viewer manufacturer & model:\nSteps to reproduce the issue:\n 1.\n. My default settings:\n\n\n. Are you able to create a project from scratch with the minimum amount needed to reproduce this issue?  If so could you zip that up and send it to me?. Please reopen if you are able to get me a minimal repro project.. Yes, this is in fact due to the fact that gyros in mobile devices aren't perfect and have some inherent drift.  On Daydream, you can press and hold the system button (bottom most) and it will reset the rotational orientation back to center.. > When you offer a script like the GvrEditorEmulator you should consider that Unity has a logical parent / child structure where transforms from parent objects inherit to children.  Your script does the very same, without showing this in the Unity hierarchy.\nWe'll look into making this work more Unity-like.\n\nIt is absolutely non acceptable that the camera FOV parameters cannot be influenced at all anymore.\n\nThis is a feature of VR common to all VR SDKs.  It is enforced at the Unity level, not our SDK.  Camera projection params are dictated by the geometry of the VR headset.  For rendering to texture, set the camera's Target Eye to None, then your changes to FOV will not be overridden.\n. As stated in the Unity documentation, all VR rendering systems have a fixed FOV.  Works as intended.  Related to issue 937. I've contacted Unity to see if someone knowledgeable with Unity IAP can offer some assistance.  In the meantime, have you posted to the Unity user forums or reported a bug to Unity?. You can disable Instant Preview by either disabling or removing the GvrInstantPreviewMain game object from your scene.\nWe will look into not installing it on non-Daydream devices.. As a temporary workaround, you can add this snippet of code to InstantPreview.cs at line 178 of version 1.150 of the SDK:\nC#\n            // Gets the vr feature capability of the device.\n            RunCommand(InstantPreviewHelper.AdbPath,\n                       \"shell pm list features | grep feature:oculus.hardware.standalone_vr\",\n                       out output, out errors);\n            // If matches the features grep, then not compatible.\n            if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(output)) {\n              Debug.Log(\"Instant Preview: device is not compatible.\");\n              return;\n            }\nThis will prevent IP from installing on Oculus GO.. Good find.  We'll take a look.. Good catch.  We'll look into this.. This will be fixed in the next release.. The easiest way to enable this is to copy the 6DoF AndroidManifest we provide into Assets/Plugins/Android and rename it to just AndroidManifest.xml.  This should have zero impact on any other Unity functionality.. @vinhui, that's odd.  If I build an empty project (no GVR SDK for Unity), targeting the Daydream VR SDK and Android with Unity 2018.2.11f1 (that auto-adds the headtracking manifest flag), the output apk has android:banner=\"@drawable/app_banner\" in the AndroidManifest.xml.  So, that seems pretty standard for Unity Android builds.  Do you have to do the same if you use 2017.3 or later (where headtracking flags are auto-added by Unity)?. @vinhui I see the same android:banner=\"@drawable/app_banner\" in the manifest with an empty project built with 2017.2.3f1.. Fixed in the latest release.. Thanks for filing this.  We will look into providing a way to do this in the future.. Does GvrPointerInputModule.CurrentRaycastResult return what you want? . If you still need assistance with this, please reopen and comment.  Closing for now.. This is the result of the Hybrid Raycast Mode configured on the Laser object of the ControllerPointer.  Direct mode won't change the angle of the controller, while Hybrid and Camera will adjust the controller orientation depending on depth of the raycast hit.  See docs on GvrBasePointer.raycastmode.. Thanks for the feature request.  We will look into it.. Fixed in the latest release.. Please do keep us posted on the results of your findings.. We are looking into a solution for this.. Happy to hear it is working for you now.  If you encounter this again, please reopen.. Can you file a bug with Unity through the Unity editor?. I'm unable to reproduce this on Mac or Win10 with those same versions of Unity and the GVR SDK.  Since this is a crash with Unity, I'm going to close it, as this issue should be filed with Unity.. related issue 961. Have you filed a bug with Unity?  If so, could you let me know the bug #?. Can you file a bug with Unity?  If you can share a Unity issue # with me, I can escalate it.. Thank you for filing this issue.. Thank you for the feature request.  We don't have support for this feature at this time, however, the full source code to the video plugin is now available such that you could take a crack at plumbing that information through yourself.. Can you file a bug with Unity through the Unity editor?. related issue 957. Have you filed a bug with Unity?  If so, could you let me know the bug #?. Can you file a bug with Unity? If you can share a Unity issue # with me, I can escalate it.. Did you get a Unity bug or issue # from filing a bug report with Unity?. I'm sorry to hear Unity was unable to help.  Unfortunately, the only way I'm able to help is to escalate an existing bugreport with Unity.. Yes, please file all Unity editor crashing bugs with Unity, then post your bug # here so I can escalate it with Unity.  It's ok if it is private, I don't need to see the bug, but I can take this issue up directly with Unity to escalate it.. There is no access to front facing cameras on the Mirage Solo.. I'm unable to reproduce this issue with the HelloVR sample with Unity 2017.1.5f1.  Could you send me a project that reproduces the issue?. Could you send me a simple project that reproduces the issue?. Could be.  Could you send a simple project that reproduces the issue?. Please reopen if this is still an issue and you can send me a repro project.. The controller pointer will follow the head if it is pointed in the same direction of the head.  If the pointer and head drift out of alignment with each other, the user can press and hold the System button (bottom most one) to realign the two.. Oh, are you rotating the player (camera parent) programmatically? If so, you'll need to rotate the parent of the controller pointers as well.  The HelloVR demo scene is setup with a Player object that is the parent to both the Main Camera and the GvrControllerPointer.  Transforms applied to the Player object affect both the Main Camera and the GvrControllerPointer, keeping them in sync.. Does this address your issue?. How did you apply the fix for #822 to your 1.130.1 SDK?. This scenario of mixing and matching parts from different releases is not supported.  If you can, please update to v1.150 or later to get the permissions flow fix.  We have verified that multiple permissions requests work with the latest SDK.. GVR SDK for Unity v1.150 has the permissions request fix but does not have the multiple controller changes.  We do support in-VR permissions requests on the Lenovo Mirage Solo.  Unfortunately, we don't yet have a timeline for bringing that functionality to smartphone VR.. As vinhui says the workaround to this issue is to add platform-tools to your PATH.  We are working on a fix so that EmulatorClientSocket uses the Android SDK path already configured in Unity's preferences.. Another workaround is to disable the Controller Emulator by selecting the GvrControllerMain game object, then in the Inspector, under Gvr Controller Input component, set Emulator Connection to OFF.. Turning the Emulator to OFF should address the issue with the errors from EmulatorClientSocket, as it doesn't get instantiated when the Emulator is OFF.  What error are you getting after turning the Emulator OFF?. I'm sorry to hear of all of your frustrations developing for Daydream with Unity.   We're unable to provide support on the development tools themselves (Unity, Visual Studio, Android Studio).  This issue forum is just for the GVR SDK for Unity, not Unity or other tools.  Please do either file a bug with Unity (under the Help menu in Unity Editor) or post to the Unity Forums.\nIf the original issue of \"ADB Android Debug Bridge ('adb') command not found\" has been sufficiently worked around, then we will be closing this issue when the Emulator default change becomes public.  If you have other issues with the GVR SDK for Unity, please file a new issue with repro steps.. I think this may be possible by using Chrome VR (you'd have to intent to the Chrome VR activity and back), but I have no experience with it.  I'll try to find someone who can give more specific assistance.. I'm not sure.  I haven't tried any of this yet.. You can change the Controller Emulator Connection to OFF to remove the warnings and clutter.  In the GvrControllerInput prefab object in your scene, under the Gvr Controller Input component, change the Emulator Connection to OFF.\nWe will look into fixing it to not create the extra DontDestroyOnLoad objects when it is OFF in a future release.. Also, those game objects are only created in Editor.  All of the PhoneRemoteXXX objects and Controller Emulator functionality is fully disabled in builds for device.. This is now fixed in the latest release.. That's very odd that the version of GVR Unity SDK would affect this issue.  Can you reproduce this issue without the GVR SDK for Unity package in your project?  You should be able to make a Daydream VR app with just the Daydream VR SDK enabled in Player Settings > XR Settings, but no GVR SDK package in the project.. Please reopen if you're still experiencing this issue.. Can you file a bug with Unity through the Unity editor?. When you file a bug with Unity, could you share the case # with me?. This is correct.  There is no editor emulation of the GVR Keyboard.. In VR mode, your scene will more or less be rendered twice, once for each eye.  When that rendering is complete, the rendered eye buffers are handed to the GVR compositor where it does yet another render pass to the screen performing the lens anti-distortion.  Also, what frame rate was your scene previously running at in non-VR mode?  It's possible your scene had been running at 30fps in non-VR mode.  VR mode tries to run at 60fps always.. If you have further questions on this issue, please ask and reopen.. Reopening until this issue is resolved in a GoogleVR SDK release.. Does the system button bring up the System Dashboard UI or is the whole system software hung?. Are you able to send us a Unity project or apk that reproduces the issue?. Emailed you.. This is a VR Services level issue that will be resolved very soon with an auto-pushed update to VR Services.  We will comment and close this issue when the update is pushed.. There will be an API to enable limited compositing-layer only access to the front facing cameras.  Initially the app will not have any access to the camera buffers, only turn on compositing of an underlying camera layer to enable SeeThrough mode.. The API is not yet available.. This will be in the next release of the SDK due by the end of March.. Teleportation now only lives in Daydream Elements.  That will still work with the latest GVR SDK for Unity.. It is probably best to use controller device connected state to do fallback to gaze-based controls when loadedDeviceName is Daydream.. You can configure adb to work over wifi, allowing you to build, install, run, and logcat without a USB cable plugged in between your computer and headset.  Instant Preview also works over WiFi with this configuration.  See instructions here.. This file was deprecated and replaced by GvrControllerInput.cs.. You can get the version string in C# like so:\nC#\nstring versionString = GvrUnitySdkVersion.GVR_SDK_VERSION;. This is a duplicate of issue 985.. we'll take a look.. You will need to assign your controller laser pointer to GvrPointerInputModule.Pointer for the controller laser pointer to emit events.\nThe demo scenes do this in DemoInputManager.cs. My apologies, I misread your issue.  The controller pointer object never activates in your scene when you hit play and hold the Shift key on your keyboard?. Unfortunately, playback of subtitle tracks is not supported in the GvrVideoPlayerTexture at this time.. Until we get a fix out, you can work around it by removing or disabling the GvrInstantPreviewMain game object.  It does mean losing Instant Preview until the fix is out.  Alternately, if you don't need any of the new bits in 1.190, you can roll back to 1.180 on our releases page.. This is now fixed in the latest release.. We have a sample project called Daydream Elements that has a sample scene that demonstrates the use of different arm models.  This scene also demonstrates visualizing more of the arm like I believe you are asking about.\nIt is possible to switch handedness in the System Dashboard.  This page describes how to change a bunch of system settings.  Handedness is at the bottom.\nWhen your app is brought to the foreground again. GvrSettings.Handedness will update accordingly.. What this means is that the video plugin is only fully supported on Daydream-ready devices.  It does work on some other Android devices, but not all due to API or hardware incompatibility.  If you are targeting a wide range of devices that you may not be able to verify it works yourself, this may not be the best solution for your app.  If you are targeting a range of devices that you CAN directly verify and it works on all of them, then this may be a good solution for your app.. Thanks for the detailed report.  We'll look into this.. We will look into what we can do to provide more flexibility of the GVR supplied UX layer.. Good catch.  Thanks for the spot.. GoogleVR disconnects from the motion sensors subsystem when the app is suspended.  If it is continuing to run, it may be some system issue where these systems don't shut down immediately.\nDo you notice any difference in power drain if you kill the cardboard app, not just suspend it?. It is not possible to disable VSYNC with GoogleVR.  GoogleVR handles final presentation to the screen and due to VR systems to maximize comfort and minimize latency, VSYNC must remain locked.\nIf you are seeing blocking in WaitForGPU, you are very likely GPU bound.  This could be due to heavyweight shaders or extensive use of transparency.\n. Rendering to VR is a two pass rendering process.  Unity renders each eye to an undistorted render buffer.  Then it hands this buffer off to the GVR renderer which does the distortion rendering pass and can do async reprojection and scanline racing to account for head movement between beginning of frame and end of frame as close to screen presentation time as possible.  This last process is always locked to VSYNC.  To unlock it would defeat the timing of these headpose adjustments and cause discomfort in VR.. Android 64 bit build support will be available in the next release, due in March.. we're working on a fix.. ",

Hi, I'm also highly interested in this thread. Samsung/Oculus have developed a lot of optimizations such as time warp and late latching, described in their blog. I remember I read somewhere that they also introduced a lot of optimizations for GearVR on a low level such as direct front buffer rendering (http://www.engadget.com/2014/09/04/samsung-gear-vr-john-carmack/) and an android kernel priority interruption layer for sensors (or something similar, can't remember where I read that). \nIt would be nice to know which of these optimizations, if any, are built in the Carboard plugins. Maybe there's documentation I haven't found? \nAlthough I can't tell for sure, I would think that sensors on mid to high-end phones aren't that bad. \nIn fact I recall reading somewhere that the sensors on the gearVR are only streaming data 2X as fast, but precision-wise are similar (please correct me if I'm wrong). Despite that, the feeling of responsiveness is just great on gearVR compared to a similar app for cardboard. Given my relatively little experience, I'm inclined to think that latency and drift are mainly improvable by software. That doesn't mean it's an easy task, by no means, and probably with a lot of compromises given the diversity of android devices. But hey, one can dream :)\nAs I said, correct me if I'm wrong in any of the points\n. ",

UPDATE: I moved the whole project to Unity 5, I had to fix some issues (skybox missing) and again compiled under the same settings as before (IL2CPP, Universal, no striping) opened in Xcode and tried to compile, the first error that came up was that it couldn't find the LibraryPlugin folder, I checked the libraries paths and there was a backslash \"\\\" between Libary and Plugin (I don't know why) but I just changed it to a forward slash \"/\" and that error is gone.\nNow, trying to compile again and after all the almost 400 files where compiled, it failed on linking, saying that libbase.a has not 8-byte aligned for architecture arm64.\nThis is the error: \nld: 64-bit LDR/STR not 8-byte aligned: from __ZNSt3__118condition_variable8wait_forIxNS_5ratioILl1ELl1000000000EEEEENS_9cv_statusERNS_11unique_lockINS_5mutexEEERKNS_6chrono8durationIT_T0_EE (0x100602620) to l007@0x00000F04 (0x10127B944) in '__ZNSt3__118condition_variable8wait_forIxNS_5ratioILl1ELl1000000000EEEEENS_9cv_statusERNS_11unique_lockINS_5mutexEEERKNS_6chrono8durationIT_T0_EE' from /Users/nosmirck/Desktop/iosbuildu5/Libraries/Plugins/iOS/libbase.a(task_loop.o) for architecture arm64\nclang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)\nSo I tried what @lesmo suggested (removing and adding the library) but it didn't work, the same error appeared.\nI'd really like to receive an answer from the developers of this plugin, maybe something is missing and I can't figure it out.\nThanks in advance for any help you could bring.\n. Well, I forgot to mention I did this all from PC (windows 7) Unity 5.1.1p1. I mentioned I'm using a plugin (aside from cardboard) that is mobile movie texture, latest version, but the issues are always with random libraries from the cardboard. I'm going to try now installing Unity on the Mac (I didn't before because I have no space on hard drive, but I just got an external drive to do this) I'll report back when I try this.\nAnyways I did what you said just when I moved the project to Unity 5. I removed and deleted everything related to cardboard and mobile movie texture and reimported from scratch both plugins.\nThe project has nothing else, strange thing is that it is showing me the same linking error I got the first time (when I was using 4.6.6) but with a different library now on 5.1.1.\nI'll let you know how it went.\n. @smdol Ok, I just tried \"nothing but cardboard\" and I got the same error with the same library (libbase.a(task_loop.o) linker error).\nSo I guess the error is because I'm compiling from windows and copying the result folder to my mac...\nI'm going to try compiling the whole project on the mac directly. I'll update in a few hours.\n. I just compiled the whole project from the mac on Unity 4.6.3 (the one I have installed for now, 5 is downloading) and I got the same error with libplatform.a.\nI created a new project from scratch on the mac with Unity 4.6.3, added only cardboard (v0.5) and tried to compile with the example (treasure) and I got the same error with the same library (libplatform.a).\nSo, I guess there is something wrong with the compiled libraries for iOS arm64 or I'm doing something wrong...\n. UPDATE:\nStill failing.\nWhat I've done so far:\n1) Moved the project to my Mac, installed Unity 5.1.1f1 and opened there (I had a Unity5 backup before moving to 4.6.6)\n1.a) Simply I built the project, opened in XCode, tried to build = same error with libbase.a\n1.b) Deleted the Plugin folder from the Unity Project and imported the plugins again (re-downloaded from here and the other from Asset Store), Built, opened in XCode, build, = same error with libbase.a\n2) Created a new project from scratch, added ONLY cardboard plugin, added the demoscene to the build\n2.a) Built, opened in XCode, build = same error with libbase.a\n2.b) Deleted everything (empty project) created a new scene, added a cube, built, opened in XCode, build, success.\nMy configuration:\n- Unity 5.1.1f1\n- Xcode 6.2\n- iOS SDK 8.2\nHow I am building from Unity5 (Mac OS X 10.10.2):\n- IL2CPP, Universal, .Net 2.0 subset, stripping: microslib\nHow I am building from XCode:\n- Nothing special, just setting the signing account. CoreText is being added by default, and adding the resources.bundle causes error for duplicated files (they seem to be added by default on Unity 5 builds)\n- I hit Build or Archive, the same error happens (libbase.a on Unity 5)\nSo, I still don't think there is a problem with cardboard plugin, I'm currently upgrading my Xcode to 6.4 to see if this solves my problem, still, I'd like you to check this out, please use the same .unitypackage we are all using from the releases tab.\nI'll come back here with updates when I upgrade XCode.\n. Ok, after upgrading XCode to 6.4, even the first build from windows worked just fine... I want to close this thread now that the issue is solved, but you should mention in the instructions that it requires XCode 6.4 because it doesn't say anywhere that it needs to be built from an specific version of XCode. Thanks anyways for the help!! you are doing a great job!\n. Hi! I'm having the same exact problem.\nIf the scene starts in portrait mode and I then switch to landscape left and then enable VR, this problem occurs.\nthis problem wasn't happening before with version 0.5.2 and I can't find the reason behind this.\nI've scanned through the whole code for a hint on what could be going on and I've failed...\n@smdol can you please check this?\nThe project I'm developing requires me to have the main UI in portrait mode, select a scene and start the VR experience. The experience occurs in the same scene by simply loading a texture to a reversed sphere and enabling the VR mode (previously switching to Landscape Left).\nI tried putting this into separated scenes and the problem persists.\nI also tried putting this in a thread that first switches to Landsacpe Left, waits 0.5 seconds, enables VR mode, disables distortion, waits 0.1secs enables distortion again. I also tried enabling VR mode once on Landscape Left, disbaling it after a brief time, then enabling it again... nothing... the problem persists.\nThanks in advance for any help you can bring to us!\n. @dill0wn I found a little workaround to the problem.\nFirst, don't add any Cardboard script to your first scene (the one that starts in portrait mode).\nAvoid calls to Cardboard.SDK before any actual call to go into VR mode. In my case, I'm saving any setting (for example the OnBackButton, DistortionMode, OnTrigger, DriftCorrection, etc...) on variables and as soon as you need to actually go into VR mode, then, what you have to do is to call a function that FIRST changes to LandscapeLeft, then, creates the Cardboard with Cardboard.Create() and then call a function to set everything from the variables if the Cardboard.SDK is null. Something like this:\n```\npublic void GoVR(){\n    Screen.orientation = ScreenOrientation.LandscapeLeft;\n    if(Cardboard.SDK==null){\n        Cardboard.Create ();\n        AssignCardboardVariables();\n    }\n    Cardboard.SDK.VRModeEnabled = true;\n    //Do whatever you need to do when you switch to VRmode.\n}\nvoid AssignCardboardVariables(){\n    Cardboard.SDK.DistortionCorrection = _my_DistortionCorrectionMode;\n    Cardboard.SDK.OnBackButton += BackDetected;\n    if (FindObjectOfType() == null) {\n            InputSystem.AddComponent ();\n    }\n    //etc...\n}\n```\nAnother Workaround I found (which I tried first and worked, but it is aesthetically ugly since it has to switch back and forth in the middle of the splash screen) is to add this line\nScreen.orientation = ScreenOrientation.LandscapeLeft;\nJust before\nInitDevice();\nOn the Awake() function on the Cardboard.cs Script.\nHope it helps!\n. @brianchasalow You are right! I started to experience the issue again, then I noticed that I needed at least a frame before calling create, so I changed my GoVR script to this:\npublic void GoVR(){\n    StartCoroutine(GoVRThread());\n}\nIEnumerator GoVRThread(){\n    Screen.orientation = ScreenOrientation.LandscapeLeft;\n    if(Cardboard.SDK==null){\n        yield return new WaitForSeconds (0.1f);\n        Cardboard.Create ();\n        AssignCardboardVariables();\n    }\n    Cardboard.SDK.VRModeEnabled = true;\n    //Do whatever you need to do when you switch to VRmode.\n}\nYou can change the WaitForSeconds for an EndOfFrame, however, I did it like that just to make sure it had enough time to switch the screen orientation.\n. Well, The issues on iOS could not be fixed, none of my workarounds worked, so I ended up forcing all the app to landscape left mode only and I created the canvas in world space, I work it all in a resolution of 1000x1600, and I set up an ortho camera with size 500 that renders only this canvas with a culling mask and the clear flag is set to Depth only  (Set the depth to 100 and on the cardboard preRender and postRender change their depths to -10, 10 instead of -100, 100) now, I added a script to the canvas that does the following on Start:\nvoid Start () {\n        canv = GetComponent<RectTransform> ();\n        float ratio = ((float)Screen.width) / ((float)Screen.height);\n        Vector2 size = new Vector2 (1000, ratio*1000);\n        canv.sizeDelta = size;\n        canv.localRotation = Quaternion.Euler (new Vector3 (0, 0, 90));;\n    }\nNow, to switch between \"portrait mode\" and VR mode, I simply activate/deactivate the ortho camera while activating/deactivating the cardboard VR mode (this is because I need to have the background of the screen in non-vr mode with head tracking enabled)\nSo, the end result is an app that is always on LandscapeLeft from start but I manage myself to draw the UI in portrait mode whenever I need it.\nHowever, I think that the Cardboard plugin should be able to handle this no matter the screen orientation. I know it is a hard thing to do, but could be much more easier for developers to have the freedom to work in portrait and/or landscape and switch back and forth without having any issue, this is really important if you aim to make some interfaces like in the native cardboard application, if you want to mimic the way the cardboard supported apps are listed (with a 360 \"banner\" that you can move around using the tracking) is something impossible to do with the current sdk, unless you force the app to be landscape left and rotate the canvas... which is not the most elegant solution.\n. Has anyone had luck with this? We are close to release and still having problems with the iOS version.\nWe need the portrait mode because we need to input some information in a search box, and writing in landscape is not an option here. Boss needs this to be on portrait. At least, how can we try to fix this by ourselves?\nIs there an estimation for the release of the new version of the Cardboard SDK?\nSorry for being pushy.\n. @Scott-Driscoll @apollow Thanks for your answers, I'll try this!\nHowever, I have to ask something.\nAs I have Unity Pro, I can simply disable all the splash screens and make one of my own in the same scene I have everything (so I don't have to start with a splash scene and then load a new scene) and destroy it after a fade, it looks good.\nSo, Can I just start in Auto with only Landscape left enabled, let the cardboard.cs finish its awake and, after half a second, switch to portrait?\nI didn't quite understand the override func startYnity thing. I'm not too familiarized with iOS development. I work mostly on Android.\nI'll try with Scott's solution, but to make sure the cardboard is instantiated during awake, I'll call the switch to portrait in Start().\n. One quick workaround is not to load the level immediately after the trigger has been pulled, set the button to call on click to a method that calls a coroutine that waits for 0.1 seconds (or invoke another method after the same time). Of course, it would be good to use some kind of \"traffic light\" with a boolean variable, something like this:\nprivate bool changingLevel = false;\n...\npublic void ChangeLevel(int l){\n    if(changingLevel)\n        return; //does nothing, it's already changing level\n    changingLevel = true;\n    StartCoroutine(ChangeLevelThread(l));\n}\nIEnumerator ChangeLevelThread(int l){\n    yield return new WaitForSeconds(0.1f);\n    changingLevel = false; //this is needed only if this class is a singleton or is not destroyed on load\n    SceneManager.LoadScene (l);\n}\nI don't know exactly why this may happen, I think that the trigger detection may be reading something from the hardware that takes a bit of time, so, if the level changes and the trigger script is enabling again on the new scene, it will find part of the script stuck reading, I don't know, I'm just speculating.\nAnyways, I hope this helps you find a solution.\n. @sprengundsonntag well, yeah, for me 0.1 was enough, but depending on the device, you may need more time.\nAnyways, I ended up implementing a \"trigger-free\" system to activate the buttons, by just gazing at them for 2.5 seconds, they activate. I put a small canvas with an image of a circle in the reticle and fill it radial, when it's full, it activates the button.\nHowever, in the release notes of the newest SDK build it says that this problem was fixed.\nv0.7 (3/30/2016):\n- ...\n- Fixed a crash bug from using the magnetic trigger or tilt event before loading a level.\n- ...\n. Hi @nathanmartz Thanks for replying.\nI would like to change the back and the settings icons with some of our design to match the general design and \"feel & look\" of the app.\nNot so big changes, but, they would look good for the app we are building.\nHow can I achieve this?\n. @smdol I'm writing here because I don;t want to open a new discussion. I wanted to ask how can I set the default viewer for the app by code so it compiles with that default cardboard viewer. I have the first cardboard viewer released and it doesn't have a QR Code. On android it looks great, but on iOS I get the same problem described here. So, I looked on Google for various QR codes for cardboard until I found one that fits perfecty: \"The Classic\" This one \nCan I set the default viewer to this device by code? How can I do that?\n. @smdol Great! Thank you!\n. What is the physical size of the screen? \n. This is really weird, never happened to me before. Which device is this? can you provide more information?\n. @jingjing0327 yeah, it seems that your device is not reporting the DPI correctly.\nI wonder if we can set this manually @smdol so we can create a custom settings UI where we can let the user input those parameters (physics screen size, DPI, resolution) and the render will adjust best on those devices.\nI've seen apps made on native code (like ParisVR, from 360images on the Google Play Store) that has this option. They allow you to modify these parameters in an advanced settings tab.\nThis could be a solution for those people using non-common devices or custom ROMs that don't report the DPI to Unity.\n. Confirmed to be happening still in 5.3.5f1.\nFor those that are still having trouble with this, I kind of found a workaround.\nI duplicated the 2 cameras (eyes) and removed the GvrEye Script on both, enabled them, set the culling mask to WorldUI (a custom layer) and Depth to 100.\nOn the GvrPostRender Script, I changed the depth to 99 instead of 100. This allows me to render the World canvas on top everything.\nAs my world canvas was used to show some HUD elements, it worked perfectly. Of course, you don't get any distortion on the canvas, but, I used the Curved UI plugin and it did the trick for me.\nLet's hope Unity priorize this issue and gets resolved soon.\n. Hi, I'm finding a similar problem, I just didn't want to create a new issue since other people getting the same problem can find a solution here.\nThe VR UI (back button, settings button and alignment mark) is not showing on iOS.\nI don't have Vuforia in my project, but I have AppsFlyer and I checked and it has a couple of ObjC code inside Plugins/iOS/ folder.\nIt's an AppController like CardboardAppController and I think this one is interfering with Cardboard's UI.\nI know I have to mix both of them, but I don't have experience with this and I have no clue how to do it.\nCan anyone help me with this?\nBoth files can be found here:\nAppsFlyer: http://pastebin.com/YCaiGYzp\nCardboard: http://pastebin.com/3XCd5pxQ \nThanks in advance.\n. Try moving everything you want to not move inside the main camera, not a perfect and ideal solution, but it may help.\n. Thanks @rusmaxham for getting back.\nThe current time frame for delivery is around mid July, so, there's not too much of a hurry, however, if you could outline how it works, that'd be great, since I can be trying to understand and get it ready for when you guys open source the implementation.\nI've been reading some other repositories and implementations and as I understand, I can render the video in a \"Surface\" object and I should be able to take the texture from there and pass a pointer for this texture in GPU to Unity and use it to render in 3D. But I have no clue on how to even start, I have not much java experience and I'm still learning how to code plugins for Android. All I have right now in the plugin is an activity that plays the video in full screen (I just send the media url and license url to the plugin and it starts the activity with exoplayer). @rusmaxham you're the man!!\nThank you very much for the support! I'll wait, in the mean time, I'll keep working with the project, my full screen exoplayer and tuning other stuff.. ",
    "oatssss": "I created a new project and imported the cardboard package and agreed to go ahead with the automatic api updates Unity prompted for on import.

Yeah, going into \"Development Mode\" solves all my issues, too. I wonder what this setting does? ;-)\nCould I upload an app to the Play Store that was built using this setting? I guess I'll have to do some research...\n. Are there any official news from the Cardboard or Unity developers?\nI'm really getting worried...\n. @smdol I tried adding a dummy camera as suggested by you. Also I have none of the scripts/components active (e.g. SkyboxMesh, LensFlare etc.). Still the rendering issues remain.\nOnly the Developer Build Mode fully solves the problems.\nAnother observation I made is that not all scenes are affected. I have one scene that works perfectly, and another that doesn't. Both use the same Cardboard camera system. Really strange...\n. Great news! Sadly the new version gives me a nasty error:\nCommandInvokationFailure: Unable to convert classes into dex format. See the Console for details.\n/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_60.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java -Xmx2048M -Dcom.android.sdkmanager.toolsdir=\"/Users/borisbrock/Assets/AndroidSDK/tools\" -Dfile.encoding=UTF8 -jar \"/Applications/Unity/Unity.app/Contents/BuildTargetTools/AndroidPlayer/sdktools.jar\" -\n. @smdol That's exactly what I did: remove the old Cardboard folder, then import the new package. Did I miss anything else?\n. @smdol Yes, it definitely will :-)\nBut now there's another problem: the CardboardSDKForUnity.unitypackage seems not to importable. Unity gives me a\nFatal Error\nThe file: 'MemoryStream' is corrupted. Remove it and launch Unity again!\n[Position out of bounds!]\nBefore I was just copying the Cardboard-folder from the zip archive to my Unity project. So I did not see that error. I already tried several times, re-downloaded the package, restarted Unity etc.\nBTW: I'm Using Unity 5.0 (main release) on OS X Yosemite.\nUPDATE:\nI just realized the error occurs AFTER the import. So after restarting Unity, everything is fine. But sadly the flickering problem remains. :-(\n. @smdol As with the previous version (0.4.5) of the Cardboard SDK, the flickering goes away when building in development mode.\n. That's really strange. I would really love to publish my first (freeware!) VR-Game in the Play Store. So I keep praying to the flying spaghetti monster every night for a quick solution that works on EVERY Unity scene ;-)\n. I just updated to 5.0.1f1 and the Cardboard 4.1.0 SDK.\nBut when running on the device, the app does not go into \"VR mode\", meaning no split screen, no sensor controlled looking etc. Just one simple camera facing\u00b4g to the front. In the Unity Editor everything seems fine...\n. On startup I get the following messages. Not sure if they are bad/unusual though...\n04-18 17:58:56.161    1603-1656/de.fun4mobile.brickbreakervr W/Adreno-EGL\ufe55 : EGL_BAD_ATTRIBUTE\n04-18 17:58:56.161    1603-1656/de.fun4mobile.brickbreakervr W/Adreno-EGL\ufe55 : EGL_BAD_ATTRIBUTE\n04-18 17:58:56.257    1603-1656/de.fun4mobile.brickbreakervr W/libc\ufe55 pthread_create sched_setscheduler call failed: Operation not permitted\n.

If you want\nsupport for both 32 and 64 bits, you must check \"Universal\".\nThe thing is that I am Using Unity 4.6.6f1 (pro) with the latest cardboard\nplugin. If I compile with Mono 2.x it works like a charm, everything work\nperfectly, even on iPad 2, it renders smaller to fit the cardboard. I can\neven run the app with iOS 7.1. I tried to upload to the appstore and apple\nrejected immediately the submission because it didn't have 64bits support.\nThen I just went to the player settings, compiled with IL2CPP Universal,\ndisabled the striping level (just in case) and went to Xcode to test. The\nresult: 1 error and I can't find ANYTHING about it ANYWHERE. Google shows 0\nresults. I don't really know if this is related to Unity only (something\nthey have done wrong) if I'm missing something (maybe some Xcode stuff I\ndidn't do correctly) or related to the plugin... anyways, if anyone here\ncan help me solve this I'll gladly appreciate it.\nMore info:\n- I followed the steps just like the instructions said (added\n  CoreText, libc++, added resources.bundle)\n- The project doesn't have any other plugins (except only for one to\n  reproduce videos, \"mobile movie texture\" latest version)\n- The error is this:\nld: 64-bit LDR/STR not 8-byte aligned: from l005 (0x100D1D540) to l036@0x00001304 (0x100ED4774) in 'l005' from /Users/nosmirck/Desktop/build/Libraries/libplatform.a(RotateToLandscapeViewController.o) for architecture arm64\nclang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)\nThanks in advance guys!\nBest Regards,\nLuis.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/googlesamples/cardboard-unity/issues/42.\n. I don't think so, because overlays won't get distortion correction.

The reason I have to be vague about release\ndates and upcoming features is that, even though I work full time on\nCardboard VR, I am just an engineer and I don't have the authority to\npublicly commit Google the Corporation to anything. I'm not in a position\nto make promises or implications about Google's future plans for Cardboard.\nSo what I do on this forum is 1) Find out about problems that users run\ninto and new features they would like in the SDK, which I funnel back to\nthe internal issue tracking system; 2) Help users make progress (work\naround bugs, implement a feature) with the currently released SDK.\nPersonally I think (and I stress, this is my personal opinion): Cardboard\nis a way to turn any capable smartphone into a VR device. It needs no\nadditional expensive hardware, or any specific phone running a modified\nversion of Android, just something you already likely have in your pocket.\nSo it can be used pretty much anywhere, at any time, as long as you have a\ncheap phone-holder with lenses and a QR code.\nAs long as the size of the audience willing to play with and use VR\nsoftware (games and apps) is larger than the size of the audience willing\nto buy additional VR-specific hardware like Leap or Gear, then there's a\nmarket for Cardboard or something just like it. There's also a severe\nshortage of VR-savvy developers in the world, and Cardboard is a nearly\nzero-cost way to get in and learn how to do it (assuming you already have\nthe phone).\nSo that's what I feel about Cardboard, and why I'm glad to be able to work\non it. Again, that's my personal opinion, and I don't (can't) speak for\nGoogle Inc in any way.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/googlesamples/cardboard-unity/issues/66#issuecomment-134767494\n.\n. It's now up and running with 5.2.2; I've probably run into this bug:\n(726121) - Android: IL2CPP - Fixed crash on startup when OBB is enabled.\n\nPS: no noticeable performance improvement. Longer build time.\n. Commenting resolves nothing. I'll check adb later on.\nLe ven. 16 oct. 2015 17:16, smdol notifications@github.com a \u00e9crit :\n\nAny useful lines in adb logcat?

Yes. More tests shows that the trigger is only QualitySettings.antiAliasing\nWhen set to 0 render texture has glitches on left camera.\n\n\nOK for mipmaps.\n. OK! A SettingsEventHandler lead me to the wrong conclusion.In the end the problem turns to be related to Direct render. The glitches are there when it is disabled.\nAlso I noticed (see the log) that rendertexture is bigger than screen resolution. Is it intended to be so ?\nadb log:\n```\n--------- beginning of system\n--------- beginning of main\nD/Unity   ( 7901): ASensorManager_destroyEventQueue returned 0\nE/Unity   ( 7901): RenderTexture warning: Destroying active render texture.

Just create all three RTs up front, and when\nyou want to activate one, assign it to Cardboard.SDK.StereoScreen.

I think in the future we have to set them\nvia code after they are automatically created?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/issues/266#issuecomment-232893066,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AMIc3Mr6T1ulhSn2SJKZMN2qLnJP04SDks5qV0TDgaJpZM4JMLwZ\n.\n. Thanks for your feedback too!\nI'll be glad if the overlay is darker so that it doesn't reflect on lenses\nduring dark scenes.\n\nI am aware about the switch. I already implemented it in my game but I feel\nlike it won't be possible anymore with the release of native unity support.\nAm I wrong?\nCheers!\nMick.\nLe lun. 18 juil. 2016 19:57, Mira Leung notifications@github.com a \u00e9crit :\n\nThank you very much for your feedback!\nUI overlay. We made this mandatory because we've seen too many people\nunable to perform basic functions like alignment, pairing, and exiting VR.\nThe darker color is a great point, and we may look into this more.\nDistortion. Turning off distortion makes for a suboptimal experience,\nso we intentionally don't support it as a pattern. Please consider\nimplementing VS distortion, which is very fast and can work on hardware\nback to an S3.\nTargeting left and right eyes. Please see this post\nhttps://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/issues/263 on how it can be\ndone in the native integration.\n3D toggling. This can be done in the app - the TreasureHunt example\nshows one way of doing it. We can also toggle between 2D and 3D activities\nby importing a Unity project into Android Studio and making the switch\nprogramatically.\nHope this answers your questions.

They are still an active\npart of the VR community. I understand the reason to remove it now, but\nthis will mean that a lot of developers will not upgrade or else their\nmarketing department will slap them in their face and tell them to fix the\nmagnet switch. Please consider putting it as a runtime switch in a build to\nturn it on or off and then we can offer it to the user whether they want\nthe old experience or move over to the better one.

Yes GazeInput is above the TouchInput, and just tried it with TapisTrigger turned off and it gave me the same result.\nI just tried to recreate it with a new empty scene and could not, it works like it should. So something I have done I guess causes the problem but not sure what could effect the button like that. Even creating a new button and I get the same result.\n. I checked the scene, everything is how it should be. On the plus side this only happens in the editor, not happening in the build of my game.\nMight have to rebuild that scene anyways, because I get crazy black artifacts when built for Android and not in the editor on some objects. Not sure what is going on there. But again its only in the one scene.\n. I updated to 5.2 and here are the Warning messages that pop up. Other than that it's running good.\n\nAssets/Cardboard/Scripts/VRDevices/BaseCardboardDevice.cs(120,10): warning CS0618: UnityEngine.GL.IssuePluginEvent(int)' is obsolete:IssuePluginEvent(eventID) is deprecated.

Just gave it a try, whole screen is black now without alt tabbing. I get the settings button in the middle but the 'eyes' are black.\n. I have a beta tester using a HTC One m7 and he is also reporting the extreme drift in the newest build of my game using the newest Cardboard plugin. Restarting the phone helped, but as time went on the drift got worse.\n. @smdol Not not any warmer than normal or when playing the game.\n. It was both real-time and baked, I found the issue which was the compression settings on the texture. I had set them to ASTC which did not work for normal mapping. Setting the normal textures to the default compressed fixed my issue. Probably more my fault then anything. My game is looking great now.\nNot really an issue so closing this.\n. I have this problem as well, using a Samsung S3 for testing my game. No users have reported it to me yet Been meaning to write about this but haven't been able to documented it with a video\n. Yep that is exactly the same problem here Hans.\nBut sometimes, and in the case of this screenshot below VR was enabled on start up and this occurred when I switched VR off.\n\n. Sadly got a 3 star review from someone that might be related to this bug:\n\"Zuk Z1. The game looks amazing when in the non vr menus however when turning VR on with the ZukZ1 the whole image turns upsidedown and also zooms in 80% so I can not see anything, I am using a generic vr headset and my own preset for Google cardboard 30mm lens to screen 50mm apart and 50fov for top bottom left and right not sure why it isn't working compatibility issues maybe? I had decided to refund and I just wish it may get updated. WILL CHANGE REVIEW IF IT IS FIXED FOR THE ZUK Z1..\"\nI think it might be related to this issue however the user also complains of it zooming in? Sorry I can't  ask the person for more info as it's just a review from the Play Store.\n- Side note As a developer for Cardboard it's hard to see my once 5 star rating fall because of bugs like this that I can't do much about. I hope by bringing it to your attention it helps you guys get the new update working tip top.\n. My app, only allows Landscape Left orientation. So not sure how it would be upside down? Sorry I can't  be more helpful but if you want a .apk of my game I can make it available to you. Or you can find it at http://endspacevr.com\nLet me know how I can help :)\n. Can confirm this, always wandered what caused this crash in my app, just tested it and found it to be the same.\nUsing Cardboard SDK 0.5.2 as well and Unity 5.2.3, Android 5.\n. Yep that solved the issue, thanks!\n. Can confirm this is happening on the Samsung S6, but not on a Samsung S3. Using 0.6 of the Cardbaord SDK and Unity 5.3.2. Both phones using Android 5.1.1.\n. Great @ludo6577  thanks for the tutorial / code to make this work. I'm in the process of porting my game to GearVR and this is a huge help.\n. Forgot to mention that... iOS 9.2.1. I'll check on Metal or OpenGL in a little bit. Is one recommended over the other for Cardboard?\n. Auto Graphics API was checked, so I believe that enables Metal?\n. Yeah I just finished updating all my audio sources to use the new\nspatialized audio system.

Yeah, The initial scene is a non VR scene, and then it loads a new scene with VR enabled. The stuff in the background is the initial scene images from the Unity UI.\nSo it looks like that isn't getting cleared.\nThe PreRender camera was set correctly, with black solid background. According to the latest App Store review, the whole screen is now white in the latest update using the 0.6 SDK. Not just the edges in the screenshot.\n. This was indeed the problem, thanks!\n.

    "dill0wn": "Thanks!\n. We're having a similar problem on our end on both iOS and Android.  I also tried raising to 5.0 and unfortunately the problem persists for us as well.\nOur project has one main scene that uses the new Multi Scene Editing features of Unity 5.3 to load and unload scenes additively.  This means cardboard's pieces are never created, destroyed, or changed much because they all live in that main scene.  \nThat main scene loads other scenes that request to be in either the \"landscape with VR ON\" or \"portrait with VR OFF\" state.  And the main scene does some transition bits to make that happen.\nOur crashes are occurring after going back and forth between portrait vr-disabled / landscape vr-enabled three or four times.  The meat of these transitions happen in a coroutine that essentially just set the Screen.orientation, and Cardboard.SDK.VRModeEnabled, with a yield return new WaitForEndOfFrame(); in between those two operations (We make sure when going to portrait to disable vrmode before the orientation change, and when going to landscape we change orientation before enabling vrmode).\nHere's an Android crashlog of what we're seeing.

I'm seeing the same issues, but on a Galaxy S5.  There seems to be an extremely subtle drift when looking straight ahead.  But after looking back and forth left and right for several minutes, I'm eventually looking practically behind where I start.  We have auto-drift correction enabled.\nIs this just where the state of the technology is right now, and there's no way to fix it?  Or might we be doing something wrong?\n. Any advice on what could be done in the event that a (non-cardboard) 3rd party plugin needs to be the main activity?\n. @smdol: Following your suggestion in #137 and Removing the CardboardAudioListener, fixed it for me.  Thanks!\n. Thanks, I'll whip up with a work-around then.\n. @ybeaulieu, @nosmirck's workaround is the same thing I had in mind, but I have not yet tried it myself. \n. Thanks!\nI missed a step in vuforia's integration documentation:\nhttps://developer.vuforia.com/library/articles/Solution/Integrating-Cardboard-to-the-ARVR-Sample\nThere's a file, VuforiaNativeRendererController.mm, which you're supposed to delete if you're using Cardboard (GoogleVR), and it sounds like that file is the sort of thing you're talking about.\nI Deleted that file, and voila! Thanks!\n. I just tried this in an empty project and it properly set my defaultviewer.\n. This is a known issue.  It only sets the viewer on the first launch of a fresh install.\n. I've updated and tried this with 1.0.0, with identical results.  Am I doing something wrong?  I've seen it on both iOS and Android.\n. Awesome, thanks!  I guess I'll leave this open until then?\n. Yes, for whatever reason the gear icon works fine.  I only have issues if cardboard is instantiated, vr is disabled, and i try to manually call ShowSettingsDialog() with my code. \n. I initially didn't do much digging, but now I see the GvrViewer::AddStereoControllerToCameras() method.  Why does it add StereoController's to every camera in the scene?  I will try disabling it for now.. bump!\nI'm getting the same problem with 5.6.0f1.\nAn example of my linker error:\n```\n...\nduplicate symbol OBJC_IVAR$_GTMSessionUploadFetcher._delegateCompletionHandler in:\n  /path/to/xcode/project/Pods/GVRSDK/NDK/Libraries/libGVRNDK_arm.a(GTMSessionUploadFetcher_58e8d1383eec8dda9cc9d9fddbb79d36.o)\n  /path/to/xcode/project/Libraries/Plugins/iOS/libgvrunity.a(GTMSessionUploadFetcher_d08b9eb98b259f6449b7f5ba7f534b75.o)\n...\nld: 1318 duplicate symbols for architecture arm64\nclang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)\n```\nI am not using 'Cardboard' in the iOS player settings (EDIT: It must have actually been enabled, I Just hadn't \"saved project\" or something).  I am just importing gvr 1.30.0 into my project.. Whoops! My bad.  The duplicate symbols issue only shows up if you have Cardboard VR enabled in Unity's iOS Player Settings. If you solely use the imported the SDK, then those issue go away. I did not have the box checked at the time, but I had previously checked it.  It must have been typical Unity serialization/project saving stuff where it though VR support was still enabled.\nThat being said!\nMy project now builds and runs but there is not a stereo view and there is not gyro-controlled look.\nTL;DR even after getting past the linker errors, it's still Broke as a Joke\u2122.. I found a work-around!  Downgrade to Cardboard 0.6.0.. I tried that out with Unity 5.5.2p4 and Gvr 1.0.0:\n\n\nAnd I was able to get this:\n\nOftentimes, when selecting Landscape Left in XCode, the gyro camera is upside down, too.\nOr is there a different way I'm supposed to set XCode to landscape left?. I just found out one extra helpful tidbit!\nWe have a few iPhone 6 Plus' hanging around.\n- iPhone6+ on iOS 9.3.2 - Works as expected :)\n- iPhone6+ on iOS 10.2.1 - BAD.

Please, add an option to enable them.\nI updated the Cardboard Unity SDK, but I still can't raise the volume when in VR mode.\n. You can let the developer handle it, as you never know if he's using a\ncardboard or another viewer without the button pressing problem.

The motivation for turning the keys off is that when a phone is snug\ninside a cardboard shell, just holding the cardboard tightly can cause the\nkeys to get activated.

    "Smorpheus": "As mentioned above, volume controls are necessary for video players. Users won't know the volume they want until after the video has started playing. We need to have the option to re-enable volume.\n. I certainly can, but I don't think my clients will be happy with it.  I do notice that Youtube Cardboard implementation on Android also has this problem.  Luckily, i can point to Youtube to show that the SDK just doesn't support it at the moment. I guess this will likely be resolved on the base SDK side and cannot be addressed on the Unity layer?\n. I believe the correct way to handle this is to put the volume overlay in 3D Space. This is what Oculus does on the Gear VR. If you gave us hooks to the volume inputs, we could emulate this within our apps.\n. You can control not only native device volume, but also Unity playback volume. The problem is, as it's setup now, I don't believe there's any way for me to actually respond to volume key presses correct? The Cardboard base SDK is capturing and suppressing them at the native level? This is the best I can figure based on device behavior.\n. First, thanks for all the replies, I'm sure this thread will help others when dealing with clients who are giving us a hard time for not having volume controls.\nI could add it to the pause menu for sure. It's a bit awkward for an app that primarily plays back videos, though. We could also have a \"sound adjustment\" scene before the actual Cardboard portion launches.\nHowever if the Cardboard SDK passed through an event I could respond to when the volume button press occurs, that would be ideal. I could respond to the event however I like. I could either ignore it, as you've locked in the current version of the SDK, or I could handle it gracefully with a 3D volume control. Also, why is the SDK not just adjusting the volume via AudioManager while suppressing the 2D overlay? Wouldn't that be a better behavior?\n. ",

    "thesambassador": "I'm hitting this issue too.  To reproduce, I just downloaded the Cardboard SDK unity package, the Cardboard Demo unity package, and imported them both into a project.  Then I opened up the demo scene, went to the StereoController component on the main camera, and unchecked \"Direct Render.\"  This causes it to crash for me 100% of the time (I have not added any image effects or done anything else to the demo scene).\n. Actually, I went ahead and upgraded to the latest (5.1.3f1) and now it doesn't crash, but instead when I start it's throwing a bunch of errors.\nRenderTexture.Create failed: format unsupported.\nUnityEngine.Camera:Render()\nCardboardEye:Render() (at Assets/Cardboard/Scripts/CardboardEye.cs:239)\nStereoController:OnPreCull() (at Assets/Cardboard/Scripts/StereoController.cs:330)\nGoing into CardboardEye.cs, if I change the line\nRenderTextureFormat format = stereoScreen ? stereoScreen.format : RenderTextureFormat.RGB565;\nand change the RenderTextureFormat to RenderTextureFormat.Default, it \"works\", but doesn't look right (the sky covers other objects in the scene, the sky is black, the cardboard curved overlay is rendered funny).\nAny ideas?\n. Here's what it looks like when I launch it just by disabling DirectRender:\n\nHere's what it looks like when I change the RenderTextureFormat to Default:\n\nFor reference, with DirectRender ON, here's how it looks (correctly):\n\nAgain, this is with no image effects added, I am ONLY just switching DirectRender on or off.\n. No change, same as before.\n. Still seems the same... works, but the background is black and the particles out of the cube seem to not be rendering correctly.\n. Yeah, it's really odd.  Not sure what is going on there.  I haven't changed anything in the demo scene, and it renders fine with the direct render.\n. Experiment 3 - Yes, I changed it to Color.green and the background changed to green!\nExperiment 4 - Commenting out the AddDummyCamera seems to make the background pretty much gone, but adds a weird trail effect too:\n\nExperiment 5 - I can't seem to set my DirectX settings in 5.1.3.  According to the \"what's new in Unity 5.1\", they mention replacing the \"Use DX11\" checkbox with another setting, but I can't find what they are talking about.\nhttps://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/unity-5.1\nExperiment 6 - Even with --force-opengl it seems like I have the same issue (black sky with default, error with RGB565)\n. Ah wait!  I figured out how to force DX 9.  Setting it to DX 9 seems to be working with RGB565!\nSo I have a workaround, but it looks like DX 11 is the problem!\n. This issue gave me some MAJOR headaches during one of my projects. In my instance, I had different objects for left/right hand pointers and was setting one of them inactive and setting the pointer, but when the pointer changes it doesn't correct the cachedPointerEventCamera.  So the existing GraphicRaycasters will be completely off when raycasting.  The above line is fine as a workaround but it'd be nice to have an official fix so that I don't have to worry about upgrading GoogleVR versions.. ",
    "miketucker": "Thanks for your advice. I'd like to do an old-fashioned OnGUI directly onto the screen frame. The legacy example appears to render the GUI to a render texture which is then imposed in the 3d environment (see screengrab):\n\n. the gui will simply be a static button locked to the corner of the screen that toggles between regular and VR mode. Traditionally this could be done with an OnGUI(){ GUI.Button()... but this is being overwritten by the SDK's rendering.\n. That did it, thanks! It was a little fiddly to capture touch inputs because OnGUI can occur more than once per frame, but that hook allows GUI textures to be rendered correctly. (Using latest version btw)\nMaybe for the next version there could be a standardized way of toggling Cardboard mode? I'd imagine there will be many apps that want to support it, but don't necessarily want to maintain two separate apps on the store.\n. @ro4tub \nIn Cardboard.cs add this to the header:\npublic delegate void CardboardOnGUIEvent();\npublic event CardboardOnGUIEvent OnGUIRender;\nand in the EndOfFrame function:\nif(OnGUIRender != null) OnGUIRender();\nThis will provide a hook for doing regular OnGUI stuff.\nThen in your script with the GUI:\n```\nvoid Start(){\n     cardboard.OnGUIRender += HandleOnGUIRender;\n}\nvoid OnDestroy(){\n     cardboard.OnGUIRender -= HandleOnGUIRender;\n}\nvoid OnGUI(){\n    HandleOnGUIRender();\n}\nvoid HandleOnGUIRender(){\n    if(GUI.Button ...\n}\n```\nThe key thing here is that Unity will continue to check for mouse/touch button events with the OnGUI function, and the new event hook will allow it to be rendered properly by Cardboard\n.

    "motorsep": "I followed advise of \"serg hov\" from this thread http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29633049/google-cardboard-for-unity-disables-aa-on-android-device , however that didn't do anything at all.\nCould you please provide modified script for Unity to have AA working with lens distortion correction ? \n. I looked into the code and it's kinda over my head :/ (I am an artist)\n. Hmm, doesn't seem to work :(\nForward rendering: http://i.imgur.com/QLwu6aV.png\nDeferred: http://i.imgur.com/eYaZ9yX.png\nCould it be my hardware? I even enabled Force 4x MSAA in developer's options, and it still looks jagged :/\n. I am using Galaxy S3 (USA T-Mobile).\n. Android 4.3\nYep, that's what I also do - no effect at all, in any of the games. So must be the hardware issue.\n. @MiCkSoftware I think I have \"Force AF\" option ticked on in the Unity SDK's setting (or somewhere in Unity :) ). Does it interfere with AA ?\nI also have soft particles option ticked on. Not sure if that interferes with AA too, or even if it works at all in mobile VR.\n. I am using this cardboard https://www.unofficialcardboard.com/ and I tried it with Galaxy S3, S5 and S6 Edge.\nI figured that while Android hardware is quite fragmented, maybe it makes sense to have profiles (like you already do in Unity SDK) for most powerful devices (Galaxy S6 Edge and whatever phones come later this year and in 2016) with chromatic aberration correction as a togglable option ? (unless it would kill performance on any device)\n. So when you plug S6 into Gear VR, another OS runs inside stock Android on S6 ? o.O\n. I see you points...\n. Well, there are accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass and barometer on higher end phones. Plus GPS. So I wonder if any of those can be utilized to determine changes in vertical/horizontal positioning.\n. @smdol Where do I find logcat ?\n. @noemis84 Could you please file a bug report with Unity (I am not even sure they have such thing o.O) ?\n. Ohh. Will it work with multithreaded rendering any time soon? (I think it's kinda critical to utilize multi-CPU / GPU architecture for maximum performance)\n. Has anyone already tested Unity 5.2 with Cardboard on the subject of multithreaded rendering working ?\n. I found a couple of things on Asset Store:\nhttps://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/10982\nhttps://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/7405\n. @lesmo I haven't updated yet, but multithreaded renderer wasn't working with Cardboard VR in 5.1, AA wasn't working (and most likely still won't) either.\n. @D3m0n92 Does multithreaded renderer work for you in VR ?\n. @omgwtfgames Sweet! Thanks for sharing this info!\n. @D3m0n92 I don't use Vuforia and I don't think I ever will - it's prohibitively expensive.\n. Hmm.. So is there no way you guys can add some hack to SDK to workaround phone's OS to reduce latency ? \nIt seems that if everyone waits on one another, to make it happen, it would lead to VR not taking off :) So far the Cardboard is the only \"device\" that 1M+ people have on hands. The rest of the devices can't even get close to 1/2M units (I've heard that Gear VR managed to ship less than 200k units to the date).\nI tried iPhone 5S and the screen on that thing is just horrible. I haven't tried anything moving to test latency, but viewing photospheres on iPhone 5S was such a turn off for me.\n. So in other words, you can't implement any hacks to Unity SDK to reduce latency on Android, correct ?\n. I haven't yet. I will check it out for sure. Can you retrofit their optimizations to Unity SDK ?\n. @smdol I tried Design Lab and it does seem to be more responsive than stock Unity SDK scene and other apps I tried. However I think my Cardboard itself is bad - I get horrible eye strain on my right eye when using it. The issue might be stemming from the adjustable IPD on my Cardboard. I am waiting for the normal one, with fixed IPD, to arrive and then I'll test again, but either way it would be nice to port all the optimization from Design Lab app to Unity SDK.\n. @smdol So I finally got my Knox V2 viewer - no eye strain, better quality of lenses.. Unofficial Cardboard viewer was all wrong :/\nSo I tried 2 things - Design Lab and viewing my JPGs photospheres ( https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwE6dxM0O2PsakNBV0lURV8xSGs ) using Galaxy S3 and Galaxy S6 Edge.\nDesign Labs was really awesome. I liked the responsiveness even on S3. It would be really nice to port all their goodness into Unity SDK. Although adding Sensor Fusion app tracking to the mix would be even better.\nI had pretty bad experience with photospheres. It doesn't have to do anything with Unity, but I don't know where to report it. The updating of the image as I was looking around was super choppy, even on S6 Edge. I don't quote recall what it was when I used uncompressed PNGs, but I don't think it was that choppy. And on Gear VR nothing was choppy, neither with PNG nor JPG.\n. That's understandable. I am wondering about when, if ever, it will happen (there gotta be some approximate time frame set by developers themselves for implementing things to Unity SDK)\n. I see an updated Unity SDK was propped into the repo recently - looking really good so far ! :+1: \nIs there a chance that timewarp made it into this build? (I don't see anything about in the release notes, but I figured it doesn't hurt to ask :) )\n. Hmm.. What would I lose by going with native distortion ?\n. @smdol Can't you guys make it work automatically? For example, in id Tech 5 engine (RAGE, etc.) once performance drops, renderer automatically kicks in scaled resolution down and when performance increases, it scales it back up. There are a few settings, like minimum threshold (in %%) of scaling, etc.\nThat would be nice to implement in SDK, so that we wouldn't have to manually do all that.\n. Actually you would expose scaling steps and thresholds to be set by a game designer. You'd of course have default values, but developers would have to experiment with them to find right values for their games / apps. \n. ",
    "Fredz66": "\nThe trouble with doing chromatic aberration correction on current mobile devices is that it absolutely kills the frame rate\n\nThe Oculus Mobile SDK and CMOAR VR Cinema both support chromatic aberration correction.\n. ",
    "omgwtfgames": "Somewhat reiterating what @smdol has said, but keep in mind that the hard part at the moment is figuring out what works to make a good VR game or app, and making the right tradeoffs between visual quality and performance. The underlying technology is important, but only one part of the equation. Cardboard is a excellent way to get started and discover what works - if it did fade into obscurity, a Unity-based Cardboard app can be relatively easily ported to other high end VR systems. Alternatively, if it grows in popularity and remains supported, you'll be right where the biggest market is.\n(apologies if you see a double post !)\n. @motorsep I just tested Unity 5.2.0f3 and the Cardboard SDK for Unity 0.5.1 with multithreaded rendering - it now works ! Some quick profiling suggests turning it on it improves performance too.\n. ",

UPDATE: I think a found the problem / \"solution\": there is a problem if \"Multithreaded Rendering\" is enabled in PlayerSettings.\nMy testsetup (if important):\nI created a new project, imported the sdk and created 3 scenes:\n1st scene contains just an empty object with a script, which does the following:\n- DontDestroy yourself onLoad and StartCoroutine ;)\n  - wait 5seconds and load scene 2\n  - create prefab \"CardboardMain\"\n  - wait 5seconds and load scene 3\n2nd scene = skybox + cube + textmesh\n2rd scene = skybox + sphere + textmesh\nResult after launch on Android:\nWith \"Multithreaded Rendering\" enabled: 3rd scene is black after resume / 2nd has a render/shading bug\nWith \"Multithreaded Rendering\" disabled: 1st - 3rd scene is fine after resume\n. Ahhh.. thank you for the fast response/tip. Normally I've the \"known issues\" on my mind, but since most thinks work like a charme after first import I forgot them ;)\nThe only thing I had to changed in the original cardboard.cs script is under OnLevelWasLoaded() there is a device.Reset() - which recenters the orientation\nIn my case that doesn't make sense, cause the orientation between different scenes may not change... maybe this could be an option in general settings or so?\n. It seems, that this is not a common problem. I thought, maybe there are other people with similiar problems.\nNo, my scene is not complex...and even with a wider fov you wouldn't see more objects. This problem appears until now only on a samsung s6 (tested two devices). On my moto x 2nd I have constant 60fps. I still rework the scene and do some code review, maybe I find a bug. If so, I'll post it here... thank you for giving an advice.\n. After some further tests I made the problem seem to be more clearly: it wasn't switching the viewer, this just happend the same time we used the app longer.\nAfter my last post I created a very simple unity project: a sphere with 4k texture (spherical 360), the cradboardMain prefab, an audio loop and a fps counter... the same problem appeared, after a couple of time the framerate droped down from 60 to around 30. Only on S6. So I could be sure, it has nothing to do with my other unity project.\nAfter a short web search I found this (the long answer is important and describes the problem I think very well): https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleCardboard/comments/3e4iva/galaxy_s6_cardboard_performance/\nIf I had a very complex scene I wouldn't complain about the s6 throtteling down, but as described above, the scene is very simple. So maybe we could find a solution inside the SDK to use the resources of the phone better... I doubt that the s6 is the only phone with this problem.\nAnother note: the s6 is slower after around 5min... but the backside is just warm, not hot. In many other usecases the s6 becomes much warmer.\n. You're right. After upgrading to 0.5.2. we have a constant high framerate (still with native distortion, unitys was very slow in a first try, I'll investigate that when I've more time)... after 10min the s6 was hotter, but no framerate drop down. I close this issue for now.\n. I had same problem on samsung s6 after upgrade to unity 5.2 - this fix solves it.\nThank you @WTF-Grinch @smdol  !\n. Thank you for your fast response...this helped a lot and solved my problem. But one important not: i could NOT enter vr mode via Cardboard.SDK.enabled = true;\nThat worked: [some gameobject].GetComponent ().VRModeEnabled = true;\nAnother related question: in vr mode the settings button is not visible on android, but if you tap on the screen on the position where it was (on android), the settings dialog appears. is this wanted?\n. Another related Question: can I define which device is assumed/standard? Like:\nGetComponent().deviceType = CardboardProfile.DeviceTypes.CardboardMay2015;\nI get errors while building... it would be nice, if there's a way to define the device via script on runtime... I ask, because a customers bought over 2000 cardboards V2 and I want the app be preconfigured...\n. Thank you!. I'll try that.\nCardboard.SDK.ShowSettingsDialog () works well on android... Device detected :)\nOn IOS it doesn't look good (canNotFindSymbol / SkipButtonLabel?) and I get an error on bottom of the screen: parsing failed. Is there a change to fix it or is it my mistake?\n\n. And another problem: now after adding the cardboard component (to enable the settings thing, which works on android, but not on ios) on iphone after app start the \"Let's setup you device\" dialog appears again (which wasn't a problem if the cardboard prefab was instantiated later), which is definitly not what we wanted: after starting an app seeing something completly different.\nAny ideas? Do you know, why the labels on ios are missing?\n. I took the cameras from the prefab, the only settings I changed are the clipping planes to 0.01. And I set the toggle culling mask @ cardboard eye script.\nI tried your advice and turn the settings and back button off and after instantiate to on, but this doesn't help. The glitch is still there.\nI also changed the cameras to solid black color, the distortion bugs seem to disappear, but difficult to say, they're not constant bugs.\nMeanwhile switched to 5.2.2 - I'll also change the title. I still try to figure out from where the crashes come... The app never crashes after first start. When I go to pause (via home button) and then return a crash is very likely, but not always...\n. I've to correct me: the setup of your scene doesn't matter. The startglitch is always there... it just isn't so obvious, when the settings/alignment/back button stays there, because your app starts with vr mode enabled... even if you just turn off vr mode from one of the prefabs (single cam mode) and so also the gui elements should be not visible, there is also a short frame between loading and your scene... so all in all it just would be cool to have more control or possibilities to divide between menue/app stuff and a vr mode... besides: this is the app I'm talking about: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mikavaa.vrais\n. No, I haven't a solution and even not an idea what else to try... in my eyes, the sdk needs definitly an update. I have another bug sample, which makes everything even more confusing for me. I have two cardboards V2.0... one from Zaak, one from google via a conference (the cardboards have been sponsored by google)... when I configure the viewer I get very different lens distortion... and the one from zaak seem to be correct. I have no idea why and I also remember, that both cardboards had the same correct distortion two weeks ago. These test are from Moto x 2nd. But on a samsung s6 I've seen same problems,,,, for better understanding see image attached below:\n\n. So this is good and bad news... good, because I stop thinking about fixing these issues and if they are're caused by me, bad, that I've no idea when I can say to our customers (even more for myself): Now I have an reliable vr mobile workflow with untiy + google sdk... looking forward the update. Is there maybe a source you can tell me/us from where we get the latest news about such update?\n. As simple workaround for missing gui elements, maybe interessting for someone:\n1. disable settings/back button in cardboard.cs\n2. in CardboardPreRender.cs set camera.depth from 100 to 99 for example\n3. use your own gui cam on depth 100 with similar icons/buttons and use anchors for position (in my case ngui, but unity ui should also work)\n4. call Cardboard.SDK,ShowSettingsDialog() and what you want on back button\n. To prevent some crashes I would like to quit the app, if the user pauses the app. I know, not best pratice, but most crashes (maybe all, and with no debug logcat output) happen after resuming the app. But when I want to use this code for example:\nvoid OnApplicationPause (bool state) {\n        if (state) {\n            Debug.Log(\"pause\");\n            Application.Quit();\n        }\n    }\nThe app quits not correct. I get an timeout error: \"Timeout while trying to pause the Unity Engine.\", When I restart it, it crashes/hangs at start (I think it tries to resume). Has someone a workaround for a clean exit like on IOS (exit on suspend) but for android for usage with this SDK? \n. So than isn't it possible that someone, who is able to, change (I assume unityvractivity.jar) the java code and set visibility initially to \"off\"? (a patched version beside the normal version)\nAnother important fix would be, that we can quit the app properly as described 3 posts above without timeout... that would make a more or less stable release possible.\n. Any chances of an update? I think there're enough bugs to fix and I wondering, when I see new posts and tweets about google cardboard sdk and unity, how easy it is, but no one talks about the problems... 3 months is a loooooong time for an important update :(\n. I saw, there's an update. Great! I'll test it and post the result here.\n. I'll close this issue after the new sdk release 0.6. This solves the\n1. the startglitch\n2. missing Gui Elements\nAll other problems (crash/timeout) are discussed in a new thread #137 \n. I updated my Java JDK, reinstalled android sdk, tried building with MacOSX, but it was always possible to crash the app within 30 seconds...\nNFC is disabled.\nhere is a short video showing the crash... (left side phone held in portrait, right side in landscape - the default orientation via unity is always landscape left): \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/yfaunfxnzj1q3zx/crashVideo01.mp4?dl=0\napp builded from this (nearly empty) project:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/89c7ux66wv1ntik/cbTest.zip?dl=0\nStill hoping that it's my fault and I'm blind after having this error with the older sdk version.\n. It also crashes on a One Plus X and Moto X 2nd Gen.\n. My first test are successful. Now I'll use and test the new sdk in our apps. Many thanks @smdol for your fast reaction and of course the solution... it seems, we can start in a stable VR year :+1: - i'll close this issue for now and hope never have to reopen again ;)\n. @smdol: We also have problems with constantly drifting gyros, but I know,it's hard to correct wrong sensor data via code. We've been asked, if it's possible, to use the compass to correct the drift over time. I know, that the compass values are even more jittery, but sometimes we have a drift >90 degrees... maybe there could be correction if the head movement is not fast, What do you think?\n. The answer to my question 3 seems to be: Yes. It's important. Removing NFC permission from manifest causes a crash on my S6 when going to home screen during runtime...\n. @arturleao thank you for your answer, but sadly it's not that simple... I already tried it and a minute ago again to make sure we talk about the same. The UI is gone in editor, but not on android. The reason is probably in OnRenderObject():\nif (!GvrViewer.Instance.NativeUILayerSupported)\n{\nDrawUILayer();\n}\nIt seems, that DrawUILayer() is only called for devices/platforms(?), which have no NativeUILayerSupport... but obviously my S6 (and I asume many more or even all) still show the UI...\n. thank you @miraleung for your response. first I thing it's never a good idea not to let the developer decide if he needs such overlays or not, not even in a hidden option. our use case: we want to upgrade the settings behind the gear button... not just the cardboard settings dialog, but also give more options: distortion on/off (for performance reasons) and also enable or disable vr mode, because we also have a 360 single cam option to share experience or just make screenshots. see an example from us here: OpenMovieVR which is a remake from a well downloaded/liked older version: OpenMovieVR_OLD.\nAlso the alignment marker is not our favorite... just too bright (in some cardboards/devices annoying visible) and not fundamental necessary, because the alignment works well with gear button itself.\nwhat @ezonecom said is also important for us. the option I used before is to set Toggle Culling Mask on the left/right cam in the prefab... I think in the future we have to set them via code after they are automatically created?\n. UI overlay. Making visible elements in a SDK mandatory is in my eyes not good. I create cardboard apps over one year now... at the end, I never had the alignment marker and no user ever complained about it.\nDistortion. Can you please specify \"VS distortion\". I never heard of it.\nThank you for the hint for Targeting left and right eyes and 3D toggling. I'll look at it, when I give >=0.85 a try. For now I'm back to good old 0.8 ;)\n. thank you @smdol for the link about VS distortion... sounds interesting.\n\"3D toggling. This can be done in the app\"  - the TreasureHunt example\"... what and where is it... in my sdk there is non such example.\nI tried \"Expeditions\" - first of all, it's not really working on S6 and S7 which is unbelievable... really? These most selled high end phones are not being tested?\nBut asuming  it uses newest SDK and we can take it as example. There I can see the fullscreen switch...\n\nAnd I also can see it in VR in bottom right corner of right eye. Hey! Pressing it enables the one eye mode with a jerky gyro + touch overlay (where you can also change horizon), which makes it in my eyes unusable.\nI just dont't understand how can someone decide making things mandatory before it's usable... sorry! I'm very disapointed about constantly changing things which worked before.\nI had my own gear icon, with a menue, which gives the user really OPTIONS. \n\nYou show some standard profils... ok, cool, this feature I was asking months ago ;( - but if you really want to make this gear icon settings menu a value, than PLEASE...\n- integrate this VR switch\n- using gyro as option\n- touchmode\n\nI really don't get it, why I have to write all these things... just let developer their options.\n. ### Dear manufacturers: READ THE FU* manual:\nhttps://support.google.com/cardboard/manufacturers/answer/6324808?hl=en. Now I tested my cardboard at home:\n\nBrizTech Ltd (Google Cardboard 2.0)\nCgxCcml6VGVjaCBMdGQSFEdvb2dsZSBDYXJkYm9hcmQgMi4wHexROD0lbxKDPSoQAABIQgAASEIAAEhCAABIQlgANXe-Hz06CAAAAAAAAAAAUABgAw\n45mm / 64mm / Bottom / 39mm / 0.000 / 0.000\n\nthe profile editor marks the k1 and k2 entries with the red words: \"...coefficient should not be left set to 0.00.\"\nResult: Also this cardboard is completly WRONG configured for VR.\nCurrent statistic says: 3 of 5 cardboards aka 60% using a wrong profile... wow!\n. To understand, how such a profile is generated and also prevent most of my cardboards going to trash I decided to configure them on my own. Even, this is not meant to be done neither by the developers (like me) nor the user, I still would recomend it to everyone who is interested in VR and in improving things ;)\nI noticed, that it does not take much time (shame on you manufacturers) and the cardboard viewing quality with your specific device improves... because the viewing profile in general \"tells\" the smartphone details about the specs from the cardboard, but as I had to learn: they are mostly not correct and those adjustment are depentdend from YOU... because your way of holding the cardboard, your eye distance, if you wear glasses,etc... too much differences from person to person.\nTo generate my \"personal viewing profile\" I used this guide:\nhttps://support.google.com/cardboard/manufacturers/checklist/6322188\nMany things to read and check but at least I took me about 20 - 30min to make this qrcode:\n\nimportant note: This is my personal adjusted profile for the BrizTech Cardboard 2.0 used with a MotoZ! I was very suprised about some values (e.g. smaller eye distance than expected), but the most important settings are: k1 and k2 - just don't leave them at 0!\nResult\n\nThe profile works about 300% better than the printed on the cardboard itself.\nI'm not sure, if I'm confused after all this testing stuff, but it was maybe the most comfort cardboard experience I ever had... the middle of the screen, eye distance, etc. works just great. I really liked the \"Tray to lens-center\" adjustment, because very often I have the feeling that the center of the screen is too low or too high... not the case with my pvp (personal viewing profile ;)\n\nTo sum up: I'm still very interested in some of your experiences with cardboard profiles, data of your devices and maybe you try also creating your own profile?\n. Yes, I had also this \"error\" with my Moto Z, but could solve it by typing in my ppi value.... @miraleung: I'm not sure, if a screenshot is helpul at this point - as described in the first post, I add none and cardboard... because I want to start this app in portrait with \"none\" vr functionality and initiate later cardboard skd.\n\n@guneyozsan  - thank you for the workaround idea... I hoped in 2017 I won't using workarounds anymore - at least for such simple kind of things, which are just a lag of dev options.\n. @miraleung: here is the case id and link to status page. hope that help's to find a solution.\n(Case 918407) Starting in portrait orientation when using virtual realtiy supported\nLink to status page. It seems 5.6.1 hasn't this problem anymore... close this issue for now.\nThe back button wasn't also not working in 5.6.1 as expected (like in #601 described) but now on 5.6.1p4 it works.. After disable VRSettings I had the same problem. The image was distorted in single mode. I'm using Unity 5.6.2. You should fix it via this simple line, after you disabled VR:\nCamera.main.ResetAspect ();\nThat does the trick for me. If you don't use the main camera tag then just use your camera reference.. ",

I'm not sure if \n[UIApplication _handleApplicationDeactivationWithScene:shouldForceExit:transitionContext:completion:]_block_invoke1974 + 316\nmeans that someone quit the app while Cardboard view was open and it crashed the cardboard API, or cardboard API crashed which quit the app.\n. looks like i was able to reproduce. I was in non-VR mode (not sure if that matters, though) and i pressed the Home button on the phone, and came back to the app and it reopened from scratch, so it had clearly crashed. I hadn't 'exited' the app, simply minimized it essentially. Doesn't happen every time. \nYou probably just need some nil tests in the destructor...\n. I have seen a handful of those bugs almost exactly, but I wasn't sure if it was related to the Cardboard API since it didn't mention anything Cardboard related. I don't know what notifications you are subscribing to in the lib... wish I could help further but most bits of the Cardboard API are closed source...\n\n. I'm definitely seeing some semi-rare freezes/hangs on destruction of the google cardboard instance as well. I'm not quitting the app- just Destroy()ing the Cardboard instance prefab... not sure if that's related to the dealloc issue.\nAre these things you can fix quickly? We have a lot of users, and I'd hate for them to have to deal with crashes -- even a small percentage of our users equates to a lot of people.\n. I'm up to 127 crashes now from our users, and spans every iOS version, 8.1, 8.3, 8.4, 9.0, 9.1, and 'other'\n. I call Destroy on a prefab very similar to the CardboardMain prefab- it contains roughly the same Gameobject hierarchy(but not exactly the same) as CardboardMain. I could theoretically try to not destroy it, but it's not trivial to do, as a lot of other scripts on the prefab rely on the destruction/awake lifecycle, so i'd need to change everything else to accommodate. \nI destroy the prefab when a VR experience has completed and a user has pressed a Unity UI button that triggers a short Coroutine to destroy it. The Cardboard scripts should really be able to clean themselves up properly/safely. My app could handle the Destroy/Instantiate previously- before I added the Cardboard API.  I do call DestroyImmediate- I wonder if Cardboard destruction calls are thread safe internally? Could it be a threading race condition? Although, much of Unity's iOS calls aren't threaded.\nBut, the Destroy freezes I occasionally, rarely get seem only tangentially related to the above issue, when [UIApplication handleApplicationDeactivationWithScene] fires and forces destruction, which shouldn't happen mid-app-run.\n. we're up to over a thousand crashes now, @smdol. Pretty sure it's 95% of the time when cardboard deallocs when you background the app- it's that first log i posted at the top. It shouldn't even be dealloc-ing, should it? It's not like it's changing scenes or calling OnDestroy or anything.\n. Our next version of the app should have v0.6 assuming no major other issues, but will first require some QA /testing before we push it out, and only after it's released will we know if it really solved the issue for everyone. So, TBD.\n. I'm seeing the same issue, btw. Testing the above workarounds now...\n. those workarounds didn't work for me. What is the exact line where it needs to be landscape before firing into the cardboard sdk? @smdol \n. so, it turns out it needs to wait a frame or so after setting Screen.orientation before I instantiate a prefab/ call into the Cardboard SDK. That's new to 0.6 ( I used to call it immediately after setting Screen.orientation)\n. The problem is, Cardboard instance is a singleton and is caching something behind the scenes. So, if you _ever startup incorrectly where the app is portrait while Cardboard instance is instantiated, your app will be bugged forever and you will need to force quit the app and reopen it. We ran into this recently and it actually got released to the app store in its bugged state with v0.6. \nY'all need to fix this.\nTo reiterate: if i:\n1) Set screen orientation to portrait\n2) enable cardboard,\n3) app is bugged. \n4) then disable VR/cardboard mode, force screen orientation to landscapeleft,\n5) re-enable cardboard, \n6) app is still bugged.\nIf I startup the first time in landscapeleft before instantiating the Cardboard instance, everything will forever be okay. \n. We disabled the Cardboard app icloud document sync thing as it was crashing the app in an earlier version of the Cardboard SDK, if a user didn't have the Cardboard app installed. I would imagine this has been fixed by now, but we haven't tested it yet.\nIt's also kind of strange to have a system setting that has a prerequisite of having another app installed to configure it (on Android, we have to download the Cardboard app/scan it in there to configure it- whereas on iOS we are able to scan it /select a QR code directly in the app.)  It makes onboarding for new users who aren't familiar with VR difficult, when we give out Cardboard at events. \"You have to download our app, then download this other app, then scan the code, then go back to our app\" \nWe're trying to find a way to simplify new (and existing) user experiences. If we're not able to ease the onboarding process by calling a SetQRCode function in our own way, maybe you guys should find a way to improve that device selection in the Cardboard SDK. \n. @nathanmartz Sorry for taking awhile to follow up here! We might've met at Google I/O this year- I'm at Within. I just want to say we often give cardboards out at events, but often the percentage of people with an event-cardboard is a minority, compared to the rest of the population using our app who might do better with a more generic default QR code. It might be a bad idea to switch out the default cardboard for an event, when it might affect everyone else all over the world using the app. \nMaybe we could do something clever where we detect a user's location, and if they're near the special event site they get a different 'default' QR code.  That seems like a bit of a messy workaround though... I'm open to suggestions!\n. ",

Any ideas?\nThis is the script I am using to enable the gyroscope.\n```\n     #if UNITY_EDITOR\n using UnityEngine; \n using System.Collections;\n\n public class GyroscopeEnable : MonoBehaviour\n {    \n    private Gyroscope gyro;\n\n     void Start ()\n     {\n         if (SystemInfo.supportsGyroscope) {\n             gyro = Input.gyro;\n             gyro.enabled = true;\n         }\n     }\n }\n\n #endif\n\n```\nAfter that, I edited line 75 of UnityEditorDevice.cs and change the line to read:\nif (RemoteCommunicating) {\n.

Ok, I have already opened a new project. Added the sdk along with the demo. The demo works if I am using the mouse pad pressing alt or ctrl but no head tracking on my phone via unity remote.

Please reopen if you are still having issues.. There is now a way to check.. Thanks for the bug report, we are looking into it.. This is the intended design. Apps can not change the handedness, it is a global setting for all Daydream apps.. @alxvrgames, you can get a stack trace by running adb logcat in a terminal. When your app crashes you'll see a stack trace along with a brief memory dump. Could you please share that with us here?. Forgive me for the silly question, but how did you install your app?. If you end up with access to a USB C cord, please feel free to reopen with a report.. This is working as intended.\nDaydream does not support current Cardboard apps because Cardboard apps do not enable async reprojection nor do they enable low persistence mode. Async reprojection is a technology that allows an app to reduce the motion to photon latency. Getting an extremely low motion to photon latency is critical to avoiding motion sickness in VR experiences. Low persistence mode allows the screen's display to display pixels for a shorter amount of time, which avoids the blur that happens with normal displays.\nBoth of these features are required to run on Daydream to ensure a high quality VR experience. I'd suggest instead building your app for Daydream instead of Cardboard as you'll create a much better experience. Basically, you'll have to switch \"Cardboard\" to \"Daydream\" in the VR platforms supported dropdown and check the Daydream controller's touchpad instead of the Cardboard button. Otherwise the APIs are identical.. Thanks for the bug report! We'll clean up the repo.. This is now working for me. Please reopen if you are still having issues.. I did a fresh clone of the repo locally and was able to pull master. Please confirm if this works for you. If it does not, reopen this issue.. The VR SDK does not support Unity 5.5. You either need to use 5.3, 5.4, or the 5.6 beta.. Beta 8 is a beta. We can help with GVR issues, but this issue is with Unity in general and needs to be reported to them at https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/bug-reporting.. Can you please copy / paste the full error from Editor.Log here? This will help us diagnose the issue.. @miraleung, can you comment on this?. Thanks for the report! I'm adding this to our internal bug tracker.. This is now fixed internally and will be part of an upcoming release. If you want to apply a fix yourself, change the line from setting .material to setting .sharedMaterial.. The actual video decoding is done using ExoPlayer which has some limitations with the FMP4 format.. Thank you for the bug report, I've added it to our internal tracker.. Thanks for the bug report, I've added it to our internal tracker.. I think you're reporting this on the wrong repo -- this is for Daydream (Google VR) bugs, not GearVR bugs..

Thanks for the bug report, we will investigate.. Yes, that's the right solution. Please reopen if you still are having issues.. Thanks for the bug report, we will investigate!. If this is still happening, please reopen. We believe we fixed this a while ago.. Unfortunately the help button is not customizable in our SDK. We do not plan to add customization at this time.. Closing old issues.. Closing old issues. Like discussed above, head-locked UI is not good in VR.. Could you please describe what seems distorted? A screenshot or repro project would help a lot.. That is unexpected, Windows 7 is expected to work fine. Could you please share a repro project?. We believe we fixed this. Please reopen if you still have this issue.. We fixed numerous bugs around connection, finding ADB, and such. I suspect that the OP's issue is addressed. But nothing around SDK version. If you are having an issue with the latest SDK, please create a new issue here. If you've already done that, can you point me to that issue?\nThanks.. Can you check if you can reproduce this issue with the 1.110 release? I made a fix for this that got into 1.110 and I'm very curious if I missed a case.. Happy to explain! Warning, some gory details follow.\nBeing in VR mode is a feature tied to Android activities. Switching out of VR (to pop up the permissions request) requires switching activities. The screen you see with the app's name in a box is what the permission activity used to look like.\nNow it wasn't always that way, we recently inadvertently changed the permission activity to have the \"Dialog\" theme. The Dialog theme fell had default content: the App's name as title, no body, and no dialog buttons.  So in other words, the app's name in a box. The fix was very easy, to remove the Dialog theme, and have a completely empty UI.\nAnd now you know!. Thanks for the nagging. With Android P out, I thought this was fixed. Will reinvestigate.. Haven't heard back from you, so I'm assuming your issue is resolved.. Thank you for the detailed notes. This sounds like a new bug. Could you please share your repro project in a new bug?. This is unfortunately not supported by the library we use to decode the video. Sorry.. iOS builds need to target 64bit.\nThis sounds like a general Unity issue and you should report it on their forums. I'm gonna close this because it is not GoogleVR specific.. Could you please share a project that reproduces this issue with us? Thanks.. Could you please share the results of an adb logcat -s Unity? This sounds like an exception is being thrown.\nThanks.. Could you please provide a sample project for reproducing this?. Honestly, this is really low priority for us. I don't think we'll get to it any time soon. Closing this.. Happy to take PRs! Please make sure it can be done in such a way that there's only one GvrKeyboard API to Unity apps that works in both cases.. I'd have to see the PR to judge if it looks reasonable or not. The core idea certainly seems reasonable.\nThis is certainly doable as sample code, but I agree with you that avoiding the duplicate effort seems vauable.. I believe we fixed this recently. Please reopen if you still have the issue.. Please reopen if you get more details.. Please file a new issue with the bugreport as the originally reported issue is fixed. Thanks.. Can you reproduce this with the Google Cardboard viewer on HelloVR?. Closing due to inactivity.. Please reopen if you still have this issue and attach a repro project.. This will work on the Lenovo Mirage Solo, but we do not have a timeline to share for bringing this to smartphone VR devices.. We only support GvrLaserPointer with the Daydream Controller or the Daydream 6DoF Controller, however there is nothing that should prevent you from communicating with a third party controller for your apps.. This sounds like a limitation of Unity on your device. Could you try to reproduce this on your device without using VR at all?. Closing due to inactivity. Please reopen with repro information.. Could you please share your project with us so we can investigate?. I'm glad you have a workaround, but we would still like a repro project so we can investigate the issue.. Thanks for the PM, I got the project you shared and will attach it to the bug in our internal database.. Could you please create and share a minimal repro project so we could investigate this?. Would you be able to share a repro project and steps to reproduce your bug? It sounds like you are having initial setup issues.. ",

Expect the staged rollout of the VrCore update to begin on Monday, October 2, 2017.\nTo see the current version of VrCore on your device, use:\nSettings > Apps > \ufe19 > Show system apps > Google VR Services. @helge79 Native integration of Google VR into Unity exists from Unity 5.6 onward, so at the moment that's Unity 5.6 and 2017.\nUnity 5.5 does not have native Google VR integration, so will not be affected by the installed Google VR Services.. @jules43 The current Google VR SDK requires Unity 5.6 or later.\n(Unity 5.3 does not include native integration of Google VR, which means the SDK is handling a lot more of the rendering implementation. For the update to Google VR Services to help, please update to Unity 5.6 and the latest Google VR SDK.). Could it be that yeild return null is subtly different from yield return WaitForNextFrame()?\nhttps://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/issues/492#issuecomment-285752385. After reading https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ExecutionOrder.html more closely, and after some testing, it seems that the https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/VR.VRSettings.LoadDeviceByName.html documentation is correct: use yield return null after invoking VRSettings.LoadDeviceByName(...) to wait until the next frame.\nUsing yield return new WaitForEndOfFrame() is not the right thing to do as it returns control at the end of the current frame, which is too soon.. @OllieGamer This issue is closed. Would you mind filing a new issue for the crash you're seeing when Cardboard is listed first? Before you do, check to see if #671 is what you're seeing.. Hey Oliver, thanks for connecting the dots, and sharing your workaround!\nNo need to file a new issue, as I believe your issue is what we're tracking in #671: apps closing / crashing when they try to load the \"cardboard\" VR SDK / device when the phone is set to a non-native (HD+/FHD+) screen resolution. Your workaround of putting \"daydream\" before \"cardboard\" in the Player Settings > Android > Virtual Reality SDKs means the app will avoid the bug, since Unity loads supported VR devices in order, and it finds \"daydream\" before it finds \"cardboard\".. @Flameshot  I wonder if your final apk is incomplete, since you said you're exporting the Android Unity project to Android Studio and then building the app from there. Have you tried using Unity to build and run the app directly from the Unity editor?\nJust a few more questions to try to narrow this down:\n\nWhat's the exact version of Unity 2017 you're using?\nWhat model phone are your seeing this on?\nWhat Android version is the phone running (\u2699 > About phone  Android version**)?\nWhat do you have in the Daydream app under:\n\u2630 > Settings > Headset\n\u2630 > Settings > Controller\n\n\n\nIf you have enabled Developer options, what do you have for:\n\n\u2630 > Settings > Developer options > Enable GVR SDK library loading\n\n\n\nFinally, do you see any error messages in the device logs (adb logcat) when this right before the Null GVR context pointer log message appears?\n. First thing I'd suggest is to get a working apk by building directly from Unity. You can then use this apk and compare it to the one you're getting out of your Android Studio build.\n\n\nA quick thing to check are the contents of the apk, especially libraries, which you can see by treating the apk as a zip:\nbash\nunzip -l *apk | grep lib\nYou can compare manifests entries of the working and non-working app using aapt from the Android SDK:\nbash\naapt l -a *apk\nNote that the AndroidManifest.xml entries won't be shown as XML, but the output is readable and you can compare the two side by side.. Player Handedness is only relevant for Daydream.\nCan you tell me which Gvr* prefabs or scripts you're using in your scene?. Note, there were a few fixes in 1.100.0 for cases where VRDevice.GetNativePtr() could return IntPtr.Zero that weren't checked in earlier release.\nObviously, user prefs' handedness doesn't make sense when running with the 'Cardboard' VR SDK, so please let do let us know if you're still able to reproduce this with the latest SDK, at least 1.100.0 or newer.. Note that VRSettings.LoadDeviceByName \"Loads the requested device at the beginning of the next frame.\" See https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/VR.VRSettings.LoadDeviceByName.html for a code snippet for switching VR SDK / device at runtime using a Coroutine, which requests the async loading of the new device, waits one frame, and only then sets VRsettings.enable = true:\nIEnumerator LoadDevice(string newDevice) {\n    VRSettings.LoadDeviceByName(newDevice);\n    yield return null;\n    VRSettings.enabled = true;\n}\n\nIn my game I'm able to reliably switch between VR (Daydream / Cardboard) and non-VR (my home grown implementation of Magic Window), using either of the current Unity builds which offer native Daydream support, which as of this moment (i.e. March 10th, 2017) are:\n1. \"Stable\": 5.4.2f2-GVR13 (https://unity3d.com/partners/google/daydream)\n2. \"Beta\": 5.6.0b11 (https://unity3d.com/unity/beta)\nMy home grown Magic Window uses the \"\" (=none) VR device and the phone's gyroscope to recreate magic window mode.\nNote by the way that the order of the VR SDKs in 'Player Settings > Virtual Reality SDK' matters. Unity will try to load the first supported device based on the ordering in that list.\nPersonal recommendation:\nUnity 5.4.2f2-GVR13 has proven quite stable for me as I've been using it for several weeks on my main project. However, the 5.6.0 beta series is really coming along nicely as well. It seems there's a new build every few days which is noticeably improved from the previous beta. I'm still seeing some \"beta\"ness in 5.6.0b11 (which is of course expected for a beta). If you want an as stable as possible build, use GVR13. If you can tolerate a bit a \"beta\" in your dev environment, or would like to have all the latest fixes, they do follow the 5.6.0 beta series, and don't forget to check back every few days!\n. @vinhui I've definitely seen cases where a second yield statement was needed. \nThinking about this a bit, I wonder if it's due to the difference between yield null (as recommended in the docs) and yield new WaitForEndOfFrame(), which is I think what I've since switched to everywhere in my code where I want to wait for the next frame. See also this thread:\nhttp://answers.unity3d.com/questions/755196/yield-return-null-vs-yield-return-waitforendoffram.html\nCould you try something like this:\nIEnumerator LoadDevice(string newDevice) {\n    VRSettings.LoadDeviceByName(newDevice);\n    yield return null; // try also: yield return WaitForEndOfFrame();\n    if (!VRSettings.loadedDeviceName.Equals(newDevice)) {\n      Debug.LogWarning(\"Waiting extra frame\u2026\");\n      yield return null;\n    }\n    VRSettings.enabled = true;\n}\nSee if\n1. You always need the second yield return null\n2. The runtime behavior changes if you replace with yield return null with yield return WaitForEndOfFrame()\n. Glad it's working for you.\nI've left the defensive !VRSettings.loadedDeviceName.Equals(newDevice) checking in my code, to make sure I can easily catch this situation in the future. I also have a similar !VRSettings.enabled check after setting enabled = true, just to be sure. (Those two extra checks are cheap at runtime and only happen when switching between VR and non-VR.). After reading https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ExecutionOrder.html more closely, and after some testing, it seems that the https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/VR.VRSettings.LoadDeviceByName.html documentation is correct: use yield return null after invoking VRSettings.LoadDeviceByName(...) to wait until the next frame.\nUsing yield return new WaitForEndOfFrame() is not the right thing to do as it returns control at the end of the current frame, which is too soon.. Suggest providing:\n- List of VR SDKs specified in Android's \"Player Settings\", i.e. whether you have [Daydream, Cardboard, None] or [Daydream, None, Cardboard] or something else\n- What C# code you are using im your app to switch VR on / off, for example switching to Daydream from 2D might be done by calling StartCoroutine(SwitchToVR()):\nIEnumerator SwitchToVR() {\n  // device becomes active in the *next* frame\n  VRSettings.LoadDeviceByName(\"daydream\")\n  yield return null;\n  VRSettings.enabled = true;\n}. Also, please try the latest version of the Google VR SDk for Unity, which in natively integrated with Unity. Note, with native integration you'll no longer see a stereo preview in the game view, but you will see stereo when running in VR mode on a phone.. If you download the current Unity 5.6 release (5.6.0f3) from https://store.unity.com/download you'll get native Unity VR rendering on Android. You'll need to set the build platform in your project to Android and you'll need to enable VR support in Android player build settings, as well as as add 'Daydream' and/or 'Cardboard') under the VR SDKs (which appears beneath the VR support checkbox). Build your app (*.apk) and push it to your Android device and you'll have working stereo rendering.\nIn order to use the Daydream controller, and to make use of any of the other Cardboard/Daydream prefabs and scripts you'll also want to install the GVR SDK (currently 1.40.0) *.unitypackage from https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk\nIn other words:\n- You get stereo VR rendering in Unity without having to use the GVR SDK\n- However, you'll need to install the GVR SDK to use the Daydream controller, take advantage of the GVR input system and so on\nFootnote:\nIf you have an existing project which was opened with an earlier version of Unity and/or an earlier version of the GVR SDK, here are a few things you can do to make sure you're not in a bad state:\n1. Close Unity\n2. Remove all files related to any version of the GVR SDK (get rid of Assets/GoogleVR/ and the GVR SDK files sprinkled around under Assets/Plugins/...)\n3. Delete GvrIgnoreManifestMergeCheck.txt and GvrIgnoreCompatibilityCheck.txt (you may not have these, but if you do, delete both)\n4. Open Unity (5.6.0f3); at this point your project will have errors because the GVR SDK is missing, that's expected\n5. Import the latest GVR SDK (1.40.0)\n6. Fix any compile errors in your code that remain due to API changes\n7. A few of you may have at some point created a custom AndroidManifest.xml (likely in Assets/Plugins/Android/) to workaround issues in some of the early Unity 5.6 betas; If so, remove those workarounds or simply remove this AndroidManifest.xml file entirely if you no longer have a specific purpose to include it.\n8. Build your apk and push it to your Android phone/. Note this is a closed issue.\nThe latest version of the Google VR SDK for Unity (currently 1.110.0) works with the Unity 5.6 and later. Please file a new issue if this is not working\nTo switch between VR and 2D modes, see:\nhttps://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/wiki/Switching-between-VR-and-non-VR-at-runtime\n. @aschau I use monoscopic rendering in my app primarily for showing my Daydream app on my phone, usually to a group of people (on the go, at social gatherings, to other game developers, etc.), although sometimes 1:1 when I don't have a Daydream View or Cardboard viewer with me.\nThis works like this:\nI've added three VR SDKs in Unity's player build settings, in this order: (Daydream, None, Cardboard). This way Daydream rendering is the default when the app launches on Daydream ready devices, but None (=monoscopic) is the default on other devices. This ensures that when the game is launched from Daydream home the app launches in VR (Daydream) mode and works as expected.\nOn non-Daydream devices the app launches in \"magic window\" mode, and I provide an on-screen VR icon which lets users switch to VR (Cardboard) mode.\nI've wired up the Android \"back\" button so that the app exits VR (Daydream) mode and switches to \"magic window\" / demo mode.\nFinally, since you asked about the controller:\n- In Daydream mode I use the Daydream controller\n- In Cardboard mode I use the Cardboard reticle\n- In \"magic window\" mode I also use the Cardboard reticle\n. Updated doc here:\nhttps://developers.google.com/vr/unity/get-started-ios\n.

Marking this issue as closed since the original issue (\"GvrViewer.Instance.VRModeEnabled not working on iOS\") is no longer relevant in the latest Google VR SDK.. Request for Magic Window support is tracked in #703.\n. We've updated the Get started with Google VR in Unity on iOS guide. The new guide includes a note about the importance of opening the generated *.xcworkspace file instead of the *.xcodeproj file.\nClosing this issue as I believe the above problems are fixed by a combination of:\n Updating to the latest Unity 5.6 or Unity 2017 release\n Updating to the latest Google VR SDK for Unity\n Opening the the generated *.xcworkspace Xcode workspace\n Following the steps in the above mentioned getting started guide\n@oa2013  Please let us know (by filing a new issue) if you encounter any issues creating a working Xcode project using the latest Unity 5.6 or Unity 2017 and the latest Google VR SDK for Unity.\n. The EXC_BAD_ACCESS crash in SetTexture() when switching scenes (case 891965) should be fixed in at least:\n Unity 5.6.3p3 and later\n Unity 2017.1.0p4 and later\nLater releases than these should work as well. These two versions just happened to be the latest available QA patch releases when I tested.. According to case 891965, this issue is fixed in:\n Unity 5.6.1p2 and later\n Unity 2017.1.0b1 and later\n. I believe the problems described in this issues have all been fixed in recent updates.\nAt this point I would recommend using the most recent release build of Unity 5.6 (or 2017), which will have the latest version of the Google VR native integration.\nTo switch between VR and non-VR mode, see https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/wiki/Switching-between-VR-and-non-VR-at-runtime.\n. Closing this issue for now. Please reopen if you're still having problems. In that case it would be helpful to know:\n- Specific Unity version\n- Google VR SDK version\n- Phone manufacturer / model\n- Android version (Settings > About phone > \u2026)\n- And, ideally, version of Google VR Services (Settings > Apps > \u22ee > Show system > Google VR Services)\n- Log output (adb logcat). > I found GvrViewer.Instance.VRModeEnabled = false in the editor is valid, you can turn off vr mode, but packaged into the phone is invalid. Come and help out\nTo correctly switch between VR and non-VR mode at runtime, see this example:\nhttps://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/wiki/Switching-between-VR-and-non-VR-at-runtime\n\nWhen I call VRSettings.enabled inside android, the program crashes\n\nIf calling VRSettings.enabled=false still causes your app to crash with a recent stable version of Unity, please:\n1. File a bug with Unity\n2. File a new issue in this issue tracker and include the Unity case number\n\nCan confirm this is happening in Unity 5.6.1p1 still using a S6 and a Pixel for testing. Sounds like from some other threads here this is a common problem and I will just disable this option from my app even though it is used by quite a few users.\n\nSetting VRSettings.enabled to true/false should not crash your app. However, there is an issue (still present in 1.70.0) which causes your app to crash if you call Recenter() while the GVR SDK is not active, see #667 to follow along.\n\nI am only missing the recentering when enabling VR, before I would do : GvrViewer.Recenter();\nbut GvrViewer, doesn't exist anymore :(\n\nAlso see #667, which shows how to use GvrCardboardHelpers.Recenter().. Closing as the original issue (\"GvrViewer.Instance.VRModeEnabled = false Does not work\") appears to be resolved.\n. Looks like we failed to mention this in the release notes, but I believe this issue was fixed in either 1.60 or 1.70 of the SDK.\nThe cause was the way that the EmulatorClientSocket script managed state. This script does indeed poll at a one second interval.\nPlease let us know if this not fixed in the latest release.. Switching between VR and non-VR is documented here:\nhttps://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/wiki/Switching-between-VR-and-non-VR-at-runtime\n. @Rahulxx01 If your second scene tries to load an already loaded VR device name, you might find that your app exits VR:\nYou can use a String.Compare in your code that switches to VR as shown in the sample code in https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/XR.XRSettings.LoadDeviceByName.html\nIEnumerator LoadDevice(string newDevice)\n    {\n        if (String.Compare(XRSettings.loadedDeviceName, newDevice, true) != 0)\n        {\n            XRSettings.LoadDeviceByName(newDevice);\n            yield return null;\n            XRSettings.enabled = true;\n        }\n    }. @mari-yam Note that XRSettings.LoadDeviceByName(\"daydream\" or \"cardboard\") when \"daydream\" or \"cardboard\" is already loaded will cause VR mode to exit. Use the String.Compare code avoid this situation. Or, just make sure your game only tries to load the Google VR SDK device once.\n.

The latest version of the SDK requires Cocoapods. Unfortunately, we're only able to support OSX + Xcode development for iOS.\nWe'll consider supporting alternatives to Cocoapods as a feature request.. Closing, after verifying that close/back button are both (still) working as expected in Unity 5.6.2p3.\n\nWhen clicking \u2715 (close) or \u25c0 (back), your Unity app will get an escape key press\nIn development and testing you can inject an artificial escape press using\n\nshell\n adb shell input keyevent KEYCODE_ESCAPE\n\nTo handle this in your code, look for the key down event:\n\nC#\nvoid Update() {\n  if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Escape)) {\n    // Android close icon or back button tapped.\n    Application.Quit();\n  }\n}. Here's a workaround for getting 2D/VR working, which I tested in Unity 5.6.4p1.\n\n\nCreate a hybrid 2D/Cardboard app with:\n\nPlayer Settings > iOS > Other Settings > Virtual Reality Support == enabled\nPlayer Settings > iOS > Other Settings > Virtual Reality SDKs == [\"None\", \"Cardboard\"]\n\n\n\nUse the general purpose approach described in https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/wiki/Switching-between-VR-and-non-VR-at-runtime to switch between VR and 2D modes. For example, for testing purposes you could automatically switch between modes every 10 seconds:\n\n\n```C#\n  IEnumerator Start() {\n    // Every 10 seconds toggle VR mode\n    while (true) {\n      yield return new WaitForSeconds(10f);\n      yield return SwitchToVR();\n  yield return new WaitForSeconds(10f);\n  yield return SwitchOutOfVr();\n}\n\n}\n```\n\nModify the SwitchToVR() method to programmatically disable auto rotation and wait for landscape left before loading the \"cardboard\" VR device:\n\n```C#\n  IEnumerator SwitchToVR() {\n    // Disable auto rotation, except for landscape left.\n    Screen.autorotateToLandscapeLeft = true;\n    Screen.autorotateToLandscapeRight = false;\n    Screen.autorotateToPortrait = false;\n    Screen.autorotateToPortraitUpsideDown = false;\n// Wait for landscape left / right orientation.\nwhile (Screen.orientation != ScreenOrientation.LandscapeLeft && Screen.orientation != ScreenOrientation.LandscapeRight) {\n  // **********************************************************************\n  // TODO: Ask the user to turn their phone to landscape orientation,\n  // otherwise this while loop may run forever since the phone may not\n  // auto rotate when held in portrait or portrait upside down orientation.\n  // **********************************************************************\n\n  Debug.Log(\"Screen.orientation = \" + Screen.orientation + \" -> ScreenOrientation.LandscapeLeft\u2026\");\n  Screen.orientation = ScreenOrientation.LandscapeLeft;\n\n  // Debug.Log(\"yield return null\u2026\");\n  yield return null;\n}\n\nDebug.Log(\"LoadDeviceByName('cardboard')\");\nVRSettings.LoadDeviceByName(\"cardboard\");\n\n// Wait one frame!\nDebug.Log(\"yield return null\u2026\");\nyield return null;\n\n// Now it's ok to enable VR mode.\nDebug.Log(\"VRSettings.enabled = true\u2026\");\nVRSettings.enabled = true;\n\n}\n```\n\n\nModify SwitchOutOfVr() to (re-)enable auto rotation after loading the \"\" (None) SDK:\n```C#\n  IEnumerator SwitchOutOfVr() {\n    Debug.Log(\"LoadDeviceByName('')\u2026\");\n    VRSettings.LoadDeviceByName(\"\");\n// Wait one frame!\nDebug.Log(\"yield return null\u2026\");\nyield return null;\n// Not needed, loading the None (\"\") device automatically sets VRSettings.enabled to false.\n// VRSettings.enabled = false;\n// If you only have one camera in your scene, you can just call Camera.main.ResetAspect() instead.\nResetCameras();\n// Enable auto rotation\nScreen.autorotateToLandscapeLeft = true;\nScreen.autorotateToLandscapeRight = true;\nScreen.autorotateToPortrait = true;\nScreen.autorotateToPortraitUpsideDown = true;\nScreen.orientation = ScreenOrientation.AutoRotation;\n  }\n```\n\n\nDon't forget to add the ResetCameras() method used by SwitchOutOfVr(), from https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/wiki/Switching-between-VR-and-non-VR-at-runtime:\n\n\nC#\n  void ResetCameras() {\n    \u2026\n  }\n\nIn Awake() make sure screen auto rotation is enabled if \"None\" is your first / default VR SDK:\n\nC#\n  void Awake() {\n    // Is \"None\" listed first in 'Player Settings > iOS > Other Settings > Virtual Reality SDKs'?\n    if (VRSettings.loadedDeviceName == \"\") {\n      // Ensures auto rotation is set correctly.\n      StartCoroutine(SwitchOutOfVr());\n    }\n  }\n.

For future reference, additional instructions, in case you ever need to switch between VR and non-VR modes:\nhttps://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/wiki/Switching-between-VR-and-non-VR-at-runtime. Fixed in 1.70.0. The correct fix here is to indeed call the Camera.ResetAspect() on all VR capable cameras.\n In a scene with only a main camera, calling Camera.main.ResetAspect() after switching to non-VR (2D) mode is sufficient.\n If your scene uses multiple cameras, you can loop through Camera.allCameras as illustrated in https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/wiki/Switching-between-VR-and-non-VR-at-runtime. Unity automatically adjusts both FOV (fieldOfView) and aspect ratio (aspect) when entering VR mode, but only restores FOV when exiting VR mode.\nHaving to call ResetAspect() on all VR capable cameras after leaving VR seems like an issue which would be best addressed by having Unity automatically restore the previous cameras' aspect ratios.\nIf you'd like to see this fixed, you can vote on Unity case 892084 here:\nhttps://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-vrcardboard-aspect-ratio-not-preserved-when-switching-from-vr-cardboard-to-non-vr-vrsettings-dot-enabled-equals-false.

You mentioned setting VRSettings=true (rather than false), which is not what you want, although I don't think that this would cause the wrong aspect issue from appear briefly.\nTo make sure that's not the case, can you try you the SwitchOutOfVr() coroutine from https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/wiki/Switching-between-VR-and-non-VR-at-runtime and confirm whether you still see the incorrect aspect ratio during switching?\nNote that there are effectively two ways to leave VR:\n1. Set VRSettings=false (but leave the Cardboard VR SDK active so you can later set this setting back to true)\n2. Call VRSettings.LoadDeviceByName(\"\") (meaning the None device), which will automatically also set VRSettings=false..

If you're still experiencing this issue can you attach or send me a Unity project which reproduces it?\n. @reed-alpert For future reference, We believe the right eye issues you were seeing has been fixed by a driver update which was included in the Pixel's Android operating system update from 7.1.2 to 8.0.0.. I was able to reproduce this using Unity 2017.1.1p3 (using an iOS 11.0 phone) by setting either OpenGLES2 or OpenGLES3 as the first Graphics API:\nFull set of changes from a new / default Unity project to reproduce:\n Player Settings > iOS > Other Settings > Virtual Reality Supported: enabled\n Player Settings > iOS > Other Settings > Virtual Reality SDKs: Cardboard\n Player Settings > iOS > Other Settings > Target minimum iOS Version: 8.0 (was 7.0 by default)\n Player Settings > iOS > Other Settings > Auto graphics API: disabled\n* Player Settings > iOS > Other Settings > Graphics APIs: OpenGLES2/3, \u2026. Unity is working on getting the fix out for the aforementioned issue (thanks @SamtheSpartan):\n\nUnity case 931397 [IOS][CARDBOARD][OPENGLES][REGRESSION]\nBLACK SCREEN ON VR CARDBOARD BUILDS WITH OPENGLES2\n. Great to hear 2017.3.0b3 fixes the issue.\n\nWill leave this issue open a little longer, until the fix is back ported and released by the versions mentioned by @p12tic above.. Hi akira32,\nAre you referring to the text in Unity's \"scene\" view, which shows the warning message even before you hit play? If so, sorry about the confusion.\nThe message text is currently updated dynamically based on your current environment, but only at runtime, after you hit play.\nSince the default text is pretty confusing right now we're changing the demo scene in the upcoming 1.70 release to only show an appropriate warning message at runtime, after you press play. (The static/default text in the scene will instead read something like \"Messages will appear here at runtime\".)\n. Fixed in 1.70.0. PB-P2 indeed has a link to a set of Photoshop files, which you can also open in GIMP. These files contain stencils which indicate precisely which portion of the full 512x512 image are used.\nThe actual area being used is somewhere between 256px and 512px, as indicated by the stencils. The areas outside of these stencil borders are not used anywhere else by the platform.. The GvrReticlePointer prefab has the wrong (Direct) default raycast mode in 1.70.0.\nThis should be fixed in the next release. The GvrReticlePointer prefab default will be Camera raycast mode.\n. Fixed in v1.100.. I can confirm that with GVR  SDK 1.70.0, the app crashes if it tries to call GvrCardboardHelpers.Recenter() or GvrCardboardHelpers.SetViewerProfile() when the Cardboard VR SDK is not currently activated.\nWe're working on a fix for an upcoming release. As a workaround you can patch GvrCardboardHelpers.cs manually, to make sure that the result of VRDevice.GetNativePtr() is not used when it returns IntPtr.Zero, which will happen in VR mode is not enabled:\n```C#\npublic class GvrCardboardHelpers {\npublic static void Recenter() {\nif (UNITY_ANDROID || UNITY_IOS) && !UNITY_EDITOR\nIntPtr gvrContextPtr = VRDevice.GetNativePtr();\nif (gvrContextPtr == IntPtr.Zero) {\n  Debug.LogError(\"Zero native context pointer\");\n  return;\n}\ngvr_reset_tracking(gvrContextPtr);\n\nendif  // (UNITY_ANDROID || UNITY_IOS) && !UNITY_EDITOR\nDebug.Log(\"Use GvrEditorEmulator for in-editor recentering\");\n\n}\n// \u2026\n}\n```\nIf you'd rather not patch the above file, you can instead add a check for IntPtr.Zero in your code before calling GvrCardboardHelpers.Recenter():\n```C#\nvoid DoRecenter() {\n  if (VRDevice.GetNativePtr() == IntPtr.Zero) {\n    // Invalid pointer.\n    return;\n  }\n// Safe, since native context pointer is valid.\n  GvrCardboardHelpers.Recenter();\n}\n``\n. @savashito Thanks for pointing out the missing docs.

Would you mind filing a new bug for the issue of VRDevice.model not updating itself after the VR SDK / device has been loaded? It's helpful if every issue only covers one subject.. @dustinkerstein Would you mind posting this question on Stack Overflow, which is a better place to advice and how-to's?\nPlease leave a link to your question in this issue.. \"Magic Window\" mode is not currently a supported feature, so marking this issue as a \"feature request\" as the SDK is currently focused on provided the best stereo / VR experience. Magic Window mode can, however, be made to work without too much effort. The question of what's the best way to do that (there's more than one option) is most appropriate for Stack Overflow.. > Interesting. I thought it actually was a supported feature. IMO it needs to be.\nMagic Window was a supported feature in the early days of the Cardboard SDK, before the native integration with Unity. The native integration effort is focused creating the best possible VR experience.\n\nIf here is not the right place, where would be the most appropriate place to actually request this?\n\nBugs and Feature Requests are best recorded in this issue tracker. I've marked this bug a \"feature request\".\n\nI truly believe it's crucial for developers building Daydream / Cardboard apps to have a seamless VR <-> Magic Window UX. And yes, while it can be made to work, there are either UX issues (unavoidable overlay when using the Daydream View headset in Magic Window mode) or sub-par orientation tracking (when not using GVR) that make it much less usable than it should be.\n\nMagic Window doesn't require special VR features such as asynchronous reprojection, and can be implemented using a non-VR Unity camera, driven by Unity's Input.gyro. Stack Overflow is the best place to discuss and share opinions around implementation details and design goals.\nPlease leave a link to your Stack Overflow question here.. Note, when you're not in VR mode (VRSettings.enabled=false), asynchronous reprojection will be disabled.  Because of this, tracking will feel less good, even if you're app is using the same sensor fusion algorithm, sensor sample rate, etc.\nThis is because asynchronous reprojection is designed to hide the perceivable delay between the time at which the IMU sensor measurements are made and the time at which the updated frame is first displayed on the device screen.\n. @dustinkerstein Is the feedback you received around the requirement is that the \"app never goes to 2D unexpectedly\" (UX-D9)? If so, have you made sure that \"Daydream\" is listed first (before \"None\"), so that when you app is launched from Daydream home, the phone stays in VR mode the entire time?\nBuilding hybrid 2D (incl. magic window) / VR apps should be fine. It's important though that the app launch and stay in VR mode when launched from (the Daydream home) VR environment, and that the app doesn't switch to 2D unexpectedly. Giving the user the option to switch to 2D is fine. In fact, UX-D9 shows what the user experience should look like.. Sounds like two part problem:\n1. Your button was a 2D on top of a stereo VR daydream view, which is problem for users in stereo\n2. The 'shake to switch' means that some users will unexpectedly transition to 2D.\nSuggest you remove the 2D button in the stereo view. It's okay to have a 'switch to VR' mode button in the 2D view, but you don't want a 2D button to be visible over the stereo image.\nYou could\u00a0allow users to exit Daydream/VR mode:\n when the users clicks 'X' in the top left\n when the user uses the Android back button (after swiping from edge to reveal back button)\n* using some sort of diegetic UI within the VR world which gives users the option to transition to VR, much like they would if you had a 2D permissions dialog\n. Hybrid apps are certainly possible.\nSee GvrIntent.IsLaunchedFromVr().. Note that that behavior of the app will be different based on:\n Daydream ready phone vs. non-Daydream (Cardboard only) phone.\n What headset viewer (Daydream vs. Cardboard) the phone is configured for in VR Settings (which you access from the top right gear icon in VR mode), or from the Daydream app's settings.\n* Which VR devices you've added, and in what order.\n   Unity tries to load the first supported VR device, from the list of devices you specify.\n   You can include any subset of \"Daydream\", \"Cardboard\", and \"None\" (and also other VR devices Unity supports).. You'll probably be most productive if you attempt to implement the behavior you want using the Android SDK first. See https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-android-sdk/blob/master/samples/sdk-treasurehunt/src/main/java/com/google/vr/sdk/samples/treasurehunt/TreasureHuntActivity.java as a starting point.\nOnce you have the basic interaction working, you can then work on translating your customizations to a Unity app. . Use case for app being notified of VRDevice.model changes:\n1. User opens app\n2. App starts up in VR mode\n3. User changes the configured VR Settings > Headset. Unfortunately, switching VR devices at runtime is not supported.\nWorkaround: Quit the application, then change VR Settings configured device, then restart the app.. Asynchronous Reprojection is behaving as designed. The renderered stereo image is only intended to be viewed from within a VR headset, where Asynchronous Reprojection is designed to improve head tracking and user experience.\nIn general, you should not attach visible game objects to the VR driven camera (1) or attempt to synchronize visible game object transforms with the camera (2, 3). Headlocked game objects generally lead to a poor user experience and can be uncomfortable for users. Place visible objects in the world. Use diegetic UI.\nSince Asynchronous Reprojection is designed to be viewed in VR, it doesn't make sense for Magic Window (4).\nTo understand Asynchronous Reprojection, consider a user who is rotating their head:\n At the beginning of the frame, the device captures the current head pose, sets the camera transform, and then begins rendering the scene using the current camera pose.\n By the time the frame is done rendering, which is several milliseconds later, the head pose will have changed, since the user has continued to move their head while rendering was happening. \n* Asynchronous Reprojection changes how the rendered image is rendered out to the device display. It compensates for the difference between actual head pose at display time vs. the camera pose which was used to renderer the scene several milliseconds earlier.. Marking this issue as a documentation bug.. In practice, I would stay away from non-diegetic UI.\nMore theoretical answer (since you're interested):\nTo create head locked UI, you would need to somehow render that UI to the screen independently of the world image which is being reprojected. Your app would need to render two image layers and composite them together on the device screen: 1) the world view, which you would reproject, 2) head locked UI which you would not reproject. However, the ability to do this is not presently included in the SDK, nor is it provided by Unity through native integration. Hence, the \"theoretical\" answer.\n. Marked as documentation bug for:\n- Document basic description of \"how\" async reprojection works & a little bit of \"why\"\nhttps://developers.google.com/vr/distribute/daydream/design-requirements#UX-D2 covers head-locked objects being undesirable.. The packages are now available on the releases tab.\n. After discussing in person we determined that this is very likely environmental interference given that the same issue occurs with different apps, and separately on two different mobile phones.\n. > I have not found how to disable it in the Unity Game preview. I guess the class to do it is GvrEditorEmulator.cs.\nGvrEditorEmulator is designed to emulate the on-device runtime behavior when running in VR mode. It's not designed to handle If you're trying to run you in non-VR mode, you can disable or remove the GvrEditorEmulator script component from the scene.\n\nBy the way, the music is broken during around a second. It did not happen before updating.\n\nSwitching between VR and non-VR modes requires an expensive state change since the rendering pipeline is different. You might want to consider fading the music out, and back in, together with a fade to black for the display, when switching modes.\n\nThe position of the camera changes to (0, 0, 0.08) on the Unity Game preview. It works well (position does not change) on the compiled game.\n\nYou're seeing the emulator neck model due to this constant in GvrEditorEmulator:\nC#\n  private static readonly Vector3 NECK_OFFSET = new Vector3(0, 0.075f, 0.08f);. Looks okay to me for both ideas:\n1. Don't try to load \"daydream\" or \"cardboard\" device when running in the editor, so skip starting SwitchToVR() coroutine\n1. Only enable GvrEditorEmulator script component when you want to emulate VR mode in editor.

However, if the issue does not go away with WQHD+ resolution, please feel free to reopen.\n. @aAAC If using WQHD+ resolution (Settings > Display > Screen resolution > WQHD+ > APPLY) does not fix the issue for you with the that latest Unity and Google VR SDK, then please file a new issue and include a crash logs (adb logcat).\n. Also, please check that Player Settings > Other Settings > Virtual Reality SDKs > Daydream/Cardboard > Depth format is set to 24-bit | 8-bit stencil. This is for example important for scroll Canvas UI elements which use the stencil.. If you're still having issues, please include a screenshot, and ideally a small project reproduces the issue.. If this is still an issue, please re-open and include any error messages you see, as well as steps to reproduce.. I would guess that you either have custom scripts which are limiting the controller, or have other constraints such as a rotation frozen rigid body.\nSuggest comparing the demo scene which works with your scene to see what the differences are.. Thanks for PR. Locking the mouse during emulated head and controller movement is a good idea.\nWe'll get this into an upcoming release.\n. Cursor lock was added in v1.100.. @Juanfry88 To help isolate the source of the problem, can you try creating a new Unity project with just an empty scene? Set the build platform to iOS, but leave Player Settings > iOS > Other Settings > Virtual Reality Supported disabled. Build and run the app.\nIf that works, enable VR support and build and run the app again:\n Player Settings > iOS > Other Settings > Virtual Reality Supported: enabled\n Player Settings > iOS > Other Settings > Virtual Reality SDKs: Cardboard\nIf the app still runs normally, import the Google VR .unitypackage into the working project, open the GVRDemo scene, and once again build and run the app.\nLet us know what you find.\n. @Juanfry88 Please file a new issue if you have any problems setting up a new project using our updated Get started with Google VR in Unity on iOS guide..

Note that the Google VR SDK's native integration with Unity requires Unity 5.6 or later. That's currently 5.6 and 2017.\n@jules43 What's the specific issue preventing you from upgrading from Unity 5.3 to at least 5.6?\n. @jules43 Both issues you mentioned (appearance of settings gear icon and correct distortion) have been fixed.\nHere's the configuration I tested:\n Samsung S7 Edge (Model SM-G935V)\n Android 7.0 (Android N)\n Settings > Display > Resolution > FHD > APPLY (i.e. Settings > Performance Mode > Optimized)\n Unity 5.6.4p1\n Google VR SDK for Unity 1.100.1\n Google VR Services 1.10.170928015\nI also tried scanning two different Cardboard viewer profiles:\n\n. @jules43 Since everything is working with the latest SDK and most recent Unity 5.6 release, I recommend updating your project to use these or later versions of Unity and the Google VR SDK for Unity.\nI understand your concerns about updating your tools at this stage in your projects. However, I think you'll likely find that the latest Unity 5.6 release has fewer migration issues than perhaps one of the earlier 5.6 releases.. A gyroscope is required: https://support.google.com/cardboard/answer/6295046\nAs for sensor lag mentioned in the linked Unity case, unfortunately that's not something that can be addressed in the SDK.\n. Sure:\nMake sure Player Settings > Android > Other Settings > Virtual Reality Supported is checked.\nMake sure Player Settings > Android > Other Settings > Virtual Reality SDKs lists:\n1. None\n1. Daydream.\nThis is ensures that:\n When launched from Daydream home, extra intent information is used to trigger use of the Daydream VR SDK. See GvrIntent.IsLaunchedFromVr() for an example of how the intent information is retrieved.\n When launched from the home 2D launched, the default/first None VR SDK is used.\nTo switch between modes at runtime, see https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/wiki/Switching-between-VR-and-non-VR-at-runtime.. You only need to set Player Settings > Android > Other Settings > Virtual Reality SDKs to [None, Daydream]. If you launch the app for the first time from Daydream home, it will launch in Daydream VR mode automatically. If you launch from the 2D launcher for the first time, it'll launch in 2D mode.\nIf you're testing one after the other, be sure to tap the recent apps button and swipe your app away so that the activity is killed. Otherwise the existing app (in whatever mode it was in) will simply reappear.. The 1.110.0 release includes this relevent:\n\nAuto API updater no longer needed to update UnityEngine.VR to UnityEngine.XR when using Unity 2017.2 or later.. @reinier450 Please reopen if you have additional details which would help us reproduce this issue.. At runtime, on your mobile phone, only cameras which target one or both eyes should follow the builtin head tracking. Set the Camera Target Eye to None (Main Display) to disable tracking.\n\nThe Camera's stereoTargetEye property is visible in the Camera inspector view when VR support is enabled in Player Settings.\nNote, while running in the editor, camera tracking is emulated in GvrEditorEmulator.\n Its ValidCameras() applies the same Target Eye filtering logic as the native tracking applies at runtime on the mobile device.\n. Will continue tracking this issue as #838.. I believe this is a duplicate of #671 . If you find that this is a different issues than that one, please let us know.. Fixed in 1.120.0. I'm unable to reproduce these issues. Updated to MacOS High Sierra (10.12.6) yesterday and Instant Preview is working fine on both Pixel and Pixel XL.\n@matttturnbull \nCan you try uninstalling Instant Preview, just to make sure that the latest version from the SDK is actually what is being installed?\n$ adb uninstall com.google.instantpreview\nCreate a new Unity project, import the latest (currently v1.110.0) GVR SDK for Unity, and open the GVRDemo scene. After entering Play mode in the Unity editor (and waiting several seconds for Instant Preview to be installed), you should see that version 1.1.10 is installed:\n$ adb shell pm dump com.google.instantpreview | grep version\n      versionCode=100 minSdk=23 targetSdk=25\n      versionName=1.1.0\nMight also be worth making sure that your have the latest Android tools installed. Use Android Studio's SDK Manager to update to the latest.\n. Will continue to track issues related to orientation in IOS in #838.. Single Pass (multi-view) support is currently in \"Preview\" and should probably not been used in production apps due to devices with bad drivers that fail to render content correctly.\nUnity has recently added a warning about this. Here's a screenshot from Unity 2017.3.0p1:\n\nPlease use \"Multi Pass\" rendering for now.. Filed issue #828 to track the feature request.. Thanks for providing the repro project. I was able to build an Android APK using your project using Unity 2017.2.0p1. I didn't chance any of the settings after opening the TestGVR.zip project you provided.\nCan you include the full console error messages text you see when you try to build?. Also, please check that the correct value is set for the Android SDK under \"External Tools\" section of the Unity preferences.. It sounds like you might be running into Unity case 888859.\nIf so, you can either:\n1. Upgrade to a version of Unity that fixes this issue\n1. Downgrade the Android SDK 'tools' folder to a version compatible with your version of Unity\nTo try the tools downgrade option:\n1. Rename C:\\AndroidStudioSDK\\tools to C:\\AndroidStudioSDK\\tools-backup-for-issue789\n2. Download https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/tools_r25.2.5-windows.zip\n3. Extract the zip file into C:\\AndroidStudioSDK\\, which will create a new, downgraded C:\\AndroidStudioSDK\\tools\n4. Try building your APK from Unity again.. @sterlingcrispin Thanks for reporting this issue.\nAs a workaround, you can temporarily uncheck the Android platform import setting for the Assets/OVR/Plugins/<version>/Android/OVRPlugin library when building the Daydream / Google VR version of your app.\nNote also that when you're building the Daydream / Google VR version of your app that you'll want to:\n Make sure (as you did) that Player Settings > Android > Other Settings > Virtual Reality SDKs does not include 'Oculus', as this will also cause the same problem\n Use a different Android Package Name for the Daydream and GearVR versions of your app\nI was able to reproduce your issue on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ with the Oculus Utilities for Unity 1.20.0 unitypackage imported into my project. Do you know if it was the Oculus Utilities for Unity, or some other library which caused the problem for you?\n. I filed Unity case 973572 to track your issue and see if there's anything Unity can do to workaround the library issue.. Marking this as a Unity bug for now.. We're still working with Unity to resolve the conflict. Unfortunately, no further updates at this time.. To scale the effective size of the player (so that the world looks smaller / larger) while keeping world scale unchanged (so that physics continues to work correctly), you can adjust the transform.localScale of a game object that is a parent of the main camera.\nTo shrink the player by 10x (world appears bigger):\nCamera.main.transform.parent.localScale = new Vector3(.1f, .1f, .1f);\nTo enlarge the player by 10x (world appears smaller):\nCamera.main.transform.parent.localScale = new Vector3(10f, 10f, 10f);\nThe behavior you're seeing with respect to camera field of view is as expected. The Google VR SDK is now natively integrated with Unity, which means the camera fieldOfView will be automatically set while your game is in VR mode, based on the optics and design of the user's viewer.\n. Ah, right. One more thing: you will need to adjust the player height as well. Otherwise, the scaled-up effects of the neck model might allow the player to see below the floor, which is what I think you're seeing.\nHere's a test script you can attach to the Player game object in the GVRDemo scene:\n```\npublic class ScaleController : MonoBehaviour {\n// Typically (0, 1.6, 0), assumes player is 1.6m tall.\n  Vector3 initialPosition;\nvoid Awake() {\n    // Capture initial player position, so we can later scale height.\n    initialPosition = transform.localPosition;\n  }\nvoid Update() {\n    if (GvrControllerInput.IsTouching) {\n      // For testing, use touchpad to select a scale, approximately 0.1 - 10. \n      float scale = 10f * GvrControllerInput.TouchPos.x;\n  // Scale player game object.\n  transform.localScale = new Vector3(scale, scale, scale);\n\n  // Set scale-adjusted player height.\n  transform.localPosition = new Vector3(initialPosition.x,\n                                        initialPosition.y * scale,\n                                        initialPosition.z);\n}\n\n}\n}\n```\n. Can you try:\n1. Start with the default GVRDemo scene\n1. Change the \"Player\" game object's local position: from (0, 1, 0) to (0, 1.6, 0)\n1. Attach the ScaleController script to that \"Player\" game object\nThe \"Main Camera\" game object should be a child of the \"Player\" game object with a local position of (0, 0, 0).\n(Attaching the script to the \"Main Camera\" won't work, because Unity will override the location position and rotation of the camera while in VR mode.)\n. Let us know if you were unable to get this working.\nLeaving this issue open since adjusting perceived player world scale is undocumented.. Glad you got it working.\nI'll note that I don't think changing fovZoomFactor is the right solution for most apps. If you set fovZoomFactor = 2f and then rotate your head left/right, you'll see that the world is moving at a different speed than your head is turning. It's like the player is wearing a pair of magnifying goggles, like a pair of strong eye glasses. If that's the effect you want, then go for it.. Thanks, Rory. Clearing the Daydream Home app's cache is currently the best workaround.\n. Looks like you're trying to use Input.mousePosition while in VR where there is no mouse. You can use the pointer input system provided by the Google VR SDK, or you can continue to use raycasting. \nFor gaze based raycasting, you can cast a ray from the main camera's position, using the camera's transform.forward direction.\nWhile in the editor you can simulate head (camera) movement using the mouse + keyboard controllers.. Unity has an article you might be interested in:\nhttps://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/virtual-reality/interaction-vr\nLook for the head \"SelectionRadial and SelectionSlider\" heading.. Try resetting the viewer profile to the default \"Cardboard\" profile? It looks like your viewer profile is causing the issue here.\nPlease reopen if you still see this issue after updating to the latest Google VR SDK for Unity and after making sure the viewer profile is not the issue.. Single Pass (multi-view) support is currently in \"Preview\" and should probably not been used in production apps due to devices with bad drivers that fail to render content correctly.\nUnity has recently added a warning about this. Here's a screenshot from Unity 2017.3.0p1:\n\nPlease use \"Multi Pass\" rendering for now.. Filed issue #828 to track the feature request..

Please follow #829 and #703, which aim to document how to do this.. @fadookie Glad you got it working.\nIn general, you should not move / update the camera transform. This includes not allowing multi-player networking to update the camera transform (or its ancestor transforms).. @Frizau Glad you got it working.\nIn general, updating plugins works best if you:\n1. Make sure your project is in a good, working state\n1. Backup your project\n1. Close Unity (so that it does not lock any library files)\n1. Delete the the old Plugins' files\n1. Open Unity (ignore the compile errors due to missing files)\n1. Import the new version of the plugin\n1. Make any updates required due to API changes. Can you include the code from Scene 1, but without the workaround?\nIf UnityEngine.XR.XRSettings.loadedDeviceName == \"cardboard\" is should still be okay to call XRSettings.LoadDeviceByName(\"cardboard\"). The Cardboard VR Device should remain loaded.\nNote, when the None VR Device is loaded, you will see that UnityEngine.XR.XRSettings.loadedDeviceName == \"\" (i.e. the empty string \"\", and not \"none\" as you might expect).. Thanks, I was able to reproduce this in Unity 2017.3.0p1\nI filed Unity case 984886 to track this.. I updated https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/wiki/Switching-between-VR-and-non-VR-at-runtime to include a workaround for this issue.. @numenavr Please file a separate issue, and include repo steps and detailed log messages there.. Magic Window is now documented here:\nhttps://developers.google.com/vr/develop/unity/guides/magic-window\n. Leaving this issue open to track Unity case 984886 (Loading already loaded \"cardboard\"/\"daydream\" VR device forcibly exits VR mode), for the issue where calling LoadDeviceName(XRSettings.loadedDeviceName) causes that VR device to unexpectedly unload, rather than doing nothing.\n. This issue has been fixed in Unity (verified in 2017.3.1p4). A warning message is now displayed in the console when attempting to load an already loaded VR device:\n\u2026 W Unity : Invalid request to load VR Device daydream that is already loaded.\n            This might cause the device to unload on some device configurations.\nTo enter VR mode at runtime see the sample code in the Unity reference docs (XRSettings.LoadDeviceByName), or for additional sample code, see the Switching to VR mode at runtime developer documentation.\n. Looks like the portrait width was used to determine the size of the stereo view, but that the video is being stretched horizontally. Similar to what's causing issue #602.\nCan you try the workaround I listed there?. @1Presidio Orientation is definitely an issue, which is what the workaround I mentioned in #602 is about. Glad you got it working.. Will continue tracking this issue as #838.. @Claytonious I've been looking into this and my understanding of the current level of support for multiview\u00a0(single pass rending) is this:\n\n\nUnity's Single-Pass Stereo Rendering for Android documentation covers some important implementation details, including shader script requirements.\n\n\nGoogle VR Services, installed on Daydream ready devices, maintains a blacklist of device chipsets / operating system / driver versions which do not work correctly. On blacklisted devices, single pass rendering will not be enabled and rendering will fall back to multi pass.\n\n\nIf you enable \"single pass rendering\" at edit time, Unity will check at runtime whether multiview is supported, and only enable single pass rendering if it is.\n. So, if you're currently seeing rendering issues when single pass rendering has been enabled, it would be useful to know:\n\nMake and model of the phone\nAndroid version of the phone\nVersion of Google VR Services that is installed\nUnity version that was used to build the app\nWhat the specific rendering issues are (black screen, or something else)\nWhat if any errors/warnings do you see in adb logcat output\nIs your app a hybrid app that supports both 2D and VR modes, or a Daydream only app. Documentation of how to transition between VR (Daydream/Cardboard) and non-VR (\"Magic Window\") will be covered in #703.\n\nNote, Unity docs currently describe Magic Window mode using:\nUnityEngine.XR.XRSettings.enabled = false;\nCamera.main.GetComponent<Transform>().localRotation = UnityEngine.XR.InputTracking.GetLocalRotation(XRNode.CenterEye);\nHowever, in the Daydream case, the user will see a transition view after calling XRSettings.LoadDeviceByName(\"Daydream\"), even though UnityEngine.XR.XRSettings.enabled remains false.. I've documented a basic script showing a working magic window which you can use to get started in your project: https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/wiki/Magic-Window\n. I added this missing }, but the script appears to compile just fine. Can you git it another try?\n. Magic Window is now documented here:\nhttps://developers.google.com/vr/develop/unity/guides/magic-window. As mentioned in gvr-android-sdk #405, we're planning to remove the \"Google VR Services\" installation prompt on devices that aren't Daydream-ready. \nPlease follow that issue for future updates.. Would be good to determine if this issue is related to Google VR.\nCan you try temporarily disabling VR mode and see if the app works?\nDo you see any errors in the device logs?. Do you see any errors in the device logs?\nCan you share a simple see that reproduces this issue?. adb logcat should show contents of the logs.\nadb logcat -s Unity will just show Unity logs.. 1. Stop the app\n1. Run adb logcat (and leave it running)\n1. Start the app\n1. Wait for app to lock up\n1. Save output from adb logcat above. Thanks, do you have a small Unity project that reproduces this issue?\nAlso, it would be good if you could file a Unity bug and report the case number here.. I don't see a scene in the Unity Package.\nAlso, what version of the Google VR SDK for Unity are you using?. Thank you.\nIt looks like your minimap Canvas game object is using Unity's Screen Space - Overlay render mode. Unfortunately, this isn't supported in VR, as documented in Unity's User Interfaces for VR.\nI suggest you use a World Space render mode Canvas component instead.. Great. Can you include a screenshot?\nAny chance you're  settings screen orientation to portrait when not in VR?. Will continue tracking this issue as #838.. Thanks, @chuwito. I borrowed your screenshot and created a new issue (#838), which includes a C# workaround script.. Here's a workaround for getting 2D/VR working, which I tested in Unity 5.6.4p1.\n\n\nCreate a hybrid 2D/Cardboard app with:\n\nPlayer Settings > iOS > Other Settings > Virtual Reality Support == enabled\nPlayer Settings > iOS > Other Settings > Virtual Reality SDKs == [\"None\", \"Cardboard\"]\n\n\n\nUse the general purpose approach described in developers.google.com/vr/develop/unity/guides/hybrid-apps to switch between VR and 2D modes. For example, for testing purposes you could automatically switch between modes every 10 seconds:\n\n\n```C#\n  IEnumerator Start() {\n    // Every 10 seconds toggle VR mode\n    while (true) {\n      yield return new WaitForSeconds(10f);\n      yield return SwitchToVR();\n  yield return new WaitForSeconds(10f);\n  yield return SwitchTo2D();\n}\n\n}\n```\n\nModify the SwitchToVR() method to programmatically disable auto rotation and wait for landscape left before loading the \"cardboard\" VR device:\n\n```C#\n  IEnumerator SwitchToVR() {\n    // Disable auto rotation, except for landscape left.\n    Screen.autorotateToLandscapeLeft = true;\n    Screen.autorotateToLandscapeRight = false;\n    Screen.autorotateToPortrait = false;\n    Screen.autorotateToPortraitUpsideDown = false;\n// Wait for landscape left / right orientation.\nwhile (Screen.orientation != ScreenOrientation.LandscapeLeft && Screen.orientation != ScreenOrientation.LandscapeRight) {\n  // **********************************************************************\n  // TODO: Ask the user to turn their phone to landscape orientation,\n  // otherwise this while loop may run forever since the phone may not\n  // auto rotate when held in portrait or portrait upside down orientation.\n  // **********************************************************************\n\n  Debug.Log(\"Screen.orientation = \" + Screen.orientation + \" -> ScreenOrientation.LandscapeLeft\u2026\");\n  Screen.orientation = ScreenOrientation.LandscapeLeft;\n\n  // Debug.Log(\"yield return null\u2026\");\n  yield return null;\n}\n\nDebug.Log(\"LoadDeviceByName('cardboard')\");\nVRSettings.LoadDeviceByName(\"cardboard\");\n\n// Wait one frame!\nDebug.Log(\"yield return null\u2026\");\nyield return null;\n\n// Now it's ok to enable VR mode.\nDebug.Log(\"VRSettings.enabled = true\u2026\");\nVRSettings.enabled = true;\n\n}\n```\n\n\nModify SwitchTo2D() to (re-)enable auto rotation after loading the \"\" (None) SDK:\n```C#\n  IEnumerator SwitchTo2D() {\n    Debug.Log(\"LoadDeviceByName('')\u2026\");\n    VRSettings.LoadDeviceByName(\"\");\n// Wait one frame!\nDebug.Log(\"yield return null\u2026\");\nyield return null;\n// Not needed, loading the None (\"\") device automatically sets VRSettings.enabled to false.\n// VRSettings.enabled = false;\n// If you only have one camera in your scene, you can just call Camera.main.ResetAspect() instead.\nResetCameras();\n// Enable auto rotation\nScreen.autorotateToLandscapeLeft = true;\nScreen.autorotateToLandscapeRight = true;\nScreen.autorotateToPortrait = true;\nScreen.autorotateToPortraitUpsideDown = true;\nScreen.orientation = ScreenOrientation.AutoRotation;\n  }\n```\n\n\nDon't forget to add the ResetCameras() method used by SwitchTo2D(), from developers.google.com/vr/develop/unity/guides/hybrid-apps:\n\n\nC#\n  void ResetCameras() {\n    \u2026\n  }\n\nIn Awake() make sure screen auto rotation is enabled if \"None\" is your first / default VR SDK:\n\nC#\n  void Awake() {\n    // Is \"None\" listed first in 'Player Settings > iOS > Other Settings > Virtual Reality SDKs'?\n    if (VRSettings.loadedDeviceName == \"\") {\n      // Ensures auto rotation is set correctly.\n      StartCoroutine(SwitchTo2D());\n    }\n  }\n. This should fixed in the latest iOS Cocoapod. To get the fix:\n1. Use the latest Google VR SDK for Unity\n1. Then run pod update from the command line\n   (Note, this requires that you have Cocoapods installed.)\nFinal note: Until Unity has updated the bundled version of the iOS pod, you will need to run pod update to get this fix.. Support for single pass rendering is trsacked in #828 .. Sorry. Only the code in the repository (https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk) is available.. Close due to inactivity.. What's the make/brand of the Cardboard viewer you are using? Have you tapped the gear icon to scan the right QR code for your viewer?. Can you try a certified Works with Google Cardboard viewer?\nI tested a sample app built with Unity 2017.3.1p1, running on iPhone X and I'm able to converge left and right images correctly using the default configuration and a Google Cardboard viewer.. Another developer reported that updating to the latest SDK fixed this issue.\nFeel free to reopen if this is still a problem with the latest SDK.. EDIT: Fixed my typo; I originally said 2017.1.3p2 (wrong) but meant 2017.3.1p2 (correct).\nUnity 2017.3.1p2 (https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/patch-releases) contains a fix for\n\n(971671) - Android: Fixed black screen in when using Daydream unless started through the Daydream VR launcher.\n\nCan you confirm whether 2017.3.1p2 fixes your project, so we can confirm that 971671 the problem you're experiencing ?. Apologies for the version mixup. 2017.3.1p2 is correct.. Would you mind filing a new issue with whatever Cardboard problems you're seeing in 2017.3.1p2 ?\nA few extra things that would help to report in that issue:\n- Player Settings > XR Settings > Virtual Reality SDKs (which SDKs and in what order)\n- Player Settings > Other Settings > Graphics Jobs (whether enabled or not)\n- Player Settings > Resolution and Presentation > Default Orientation / Allowed Orientations\n. Would you mind filing a separate issue for the Daydream 1 black screen out of around 30 attempts when building with Unity 2017.3.1p2?. The specific black screen issue that exists in Unity 2017.3.1p1 was fixed in Unity 2017.3.1p2:\n\n(971671) - Android: Fixed black screen in when using Daydream unless started through the Daydream VR launcher.\n\nFor clarity, let's close this issue. We can track the new / separate 2017.3.1p2 issues in new issues.\n. > This is already reported in Unity here but do you feel I should also write up the issue for this repo?\nThanks for filing the Unity case and providing the case number. No need to file an issue here.. I tried the project you linked to above (https://www.dropbox.com/s/37ld6u5i95ofnqg/DaydreamTest.zip?dl=0) and do find that it mostly renders black on a Pixel phone (with Google VR Services 1.13.185188193) when built using Unity 2017.1.3p1, although it appears to work using 2017.3.1p2. For reference, I filed Unity case 1008211 for this.\nThere's was at least one issue that was fixed in 2017.3.1p2 (and was problematic in 2017.3.1p1). It may be that that fix just needs to be back ported to 2017.1.*.. > My main concern is that the latest VR Services update may have caused a black screen issue (possibly unique from 971671) for Daydream devices across many older Unity versions, and there's a good chance developers aren't aware that the update is causing issues yet. Should this not be investigated from the VR Services perspective as well?\nAgreed that updating Google VR Services to the latest should never break existing apps that were working with a previous version of Google VR Services.\nYou mentioned several affected versions (including 2017.2.1p4, 2017.1.3p1, or 2017.1.2p4). I only tried building your project in 2017.1.3p1. While that APK doesn't work with Google VR Services 1.13.185188193, the same APK also doesn't work with the the 1.12.* version for me. I also tried the Test.apk you included in the zip, but couldn't get it to work with the prior version of Google VR Services.\n. The Play store will only give you the latest Google VR Services, so once your device updates there's no going back. And yeah, \"uninstalling\" the app will put you back to the old factory ROM version, which Play will then promptly attempt to update (as it should).\nDo you have any published apps in Play store that you think were working in 1.12 but broke in 1.13?. In case you're interested, Unity case 1008211 tracks the black screen on 2017.1.3p1 (and 2017.1.3p2).\nAs noted in the case, it appears that the issue will be fixed when 2017.3.1p3 comes out.. Note that 2017.3.1p4 is out and works.\nPlease continue to follow Unity case 1008211 for the latest regarding a potential fix on the 2017.1 branch.\nAs always, Unity QA patches are available from https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/patch-releases.. We hope to have a fix for Unity 2017.1 built apps in the an upcoming version of Google VR Services.\nIn the mean time, upgrading to a newer (2017.2, 2017.3 or soon LTS 2017.4) Unity branch should also address the issue.\n\nThough it's worth noting that 2017.3.1p4 isn't a viable solution for folks dependent on Cardboard support as it still has this issue - https://answers.unity.com/questions/1456999/\n\nI added a comment in https://answers.unity.com/questions/1456999/ to explain that manually pulling in an updated gvr.aar into your project, from the latest Google VR SDK for Unity, will also fix the issue if you don't want to wait for the patched Unity version.\n\ndo you happen to know which 2018 releases 1008211 has been fixed in?\n\nI don't. Source of truth is Unity's issue tracker:\nhttps://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/xr-daydream-application-fails-to-initialize-and-renders-black-on-launch\n. Fixed in Google VR Services 1.14.190701955.\nTo check the version currently installed on your phone:\n  $ adb shell pm dump com.google.vr.vrcore | egrep -i versionName\n. If you need portrait orientation in 2D but landscape for VR mode, see the C# workaround in issue 838:\nhttps://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/issues/838#issuecomment-358404072. There's not a great way for the Google VR SDK for Unity to enable only the languages that the app developer wants to support.\nIn the mean time, customize the SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES_IOS and OnPostprocessBuild provided by @rusmaxham above.. Agreed. We are still investigating if there's more that we can do that would in fact be useful and wouldn't get in the way. If there's not a workable solution, we'll close this issue.. @spaul13 Are you referring to floating point precision in world space coordinates?\nNear the origin (0, 0, 0) in world space, precision should be very high. Farther away from the origin precision is reduced, see many articles online (example).\nBest advice is to keep your game objects relatively close to the origin.. Since it's not possible to hold the viewer up to your development machine's display to see correct stereo image and depth in any kind of preview image, there isn't all that much benefit to having a stereo preview view in the editor.\nYou can however develop your app in the Unity editor without having to build and install the app on every iteration. In fact, it's generally easier to work in the editor with a monoscopic view, and then separately test out stereo / depth on a real device on headset when you really need to view the scene in VR.\nYou're options include:\n- On Android there's Instant Preview as @vinhui mentioned above, which lets you stream a stereo view from Instant Preview in the editor to your phone over USB or Wi-Fi; changes you make in the editor affect the experience on the device in real time\n- If you have access to a supported desktop headset such as an HTC Vive, you can do a lot of quick iteration in the editor, so save yourself build/iteration time\nIf there's some reason that you really want to see stereo preview image inside the editor game view, you can switch the build platform to Android and add the Mock HMD - Vive VR device, which works in the editor. You'll get a stereo view, but without the lens distortion.\n. Understood. You might be able to look at some of the\u00a0really old rendering code (i.e. pre-1.0 SDKs), back when there wasn't any native integration. Those older SDKs had Cardboard profile based distortion rendering in the editor.\nNote, however, that the lens distortion and field of view can vary quite a lot from viewer to viewer. The user's IPD can also affect which parts of the visual field they can actually see. All in all, working near the edge of the field of view is problematic unless you know beforehand which viewers will be used, and account for user-to-user variance.\n. Please reopen if you have additional diagnostic details.. Can you confirm that Player Settings > Android > XR Settings > Virtual Reality SDKs > Daydream > Positional Head Tracking is set to either Supported or Required?\n\n. This appears to be fixed in the latest Google VR SDK for Unity.\nPlease feel free to reopen if it still occurs with the latest SDK.. @zenhund74 I'm sorry you're having trouble with the SDK.\nWhen in VR, field of view\u00a0and lens distortion are dictated by the hardware: physical dimensions of the headset, position and shape of lenses, etc. Different HMDs / viewers can and do have very different FOVs.\nThe reason Unity locks the FOV in VR to the headset's actual FOV, is that the world wouldn't look like if you were able to adjust the camera FOV. You would see the world \"swimming\" as you turn your head. That is, you'd find that the world faster or slower than it should when you turn your head, which is the effect you'd see if you were say looking through a round fish bowl filled with water.\nThe easiest way to create a \"zoom\" effect is to use game object scale:\n1. Create a new parent game object called, say, \"Camera Holder\".\n2. Attach the Main Camera and any of its sibling game objects under the new \"Camera Holder\".\n3. Adjust the local scale of the \"Camera Holder\" to create the effect of scaling the player relative to the world.\nThis has the effect of \"shrinking\" the player to be smaller (think seeing the world as an ant would) or \"enlarging\" the player (think seeing the world as a giant would). \nYou should find that this effectively changes how things look and is almost like adjusting the FOV for flat screen content.\nHope that helps.. Understood. The fact that you can change some values in the editor is confusing at best.\nOne thing we could consider is adding some in-editor only script that at runtime checks any enabled VR cameras (often simply the main camera) and looks for changes to the FOV. We could then issue a warning explaining that FOV will not be changeable in VR, and suggest the scaling solution I mentioned above instead?\nWould that have helped you?. Jens,\nInstead of using a render texture and additional cameras with custom FOV (which is going to lead to the feeling of the world \"swimming\" when users move their head, can you try the steps I mentioned above?\n\nThe easiest way to create a \"zoom\" effect is to use game object scale:\n\nCreate a new parent game object called, say, \"Camera Holder\".\nAttach the Main Camera and any of its sibling game objects under the new \"Camera Holder\".\nAdjust the local scale of the \"Camera Holder\" to create the effect of scaling the player relative to the world.. @zenhund74  My understanding is that you wanted to adjust FOV. However, although setting FOV appeared to work in editor, you found that FOV cannot be adjusted in VR mode while running on the device.\n\n\nMoreover, I understood that you were only trying to use a render texture in order to workaround the fact that FOV cannot be adjusted in VR mode.\nI mentioned the same advice (to set the local scale of game object that is a parent of the main camera) twice, because I think it's easiest way to get a zoom effect that's most like what FOV would be for non-VR applications.\nUsing additional cameras and render textures is possible, and would allow you to hack around the FOV restrictions in VR, but doing so is not going to be a good experience for users:\n- If you do this, users will see the world spinning around too quickly or too slowly compared to their head rotation. That will feel wrong, and might be very uncomfortable for some users.\n- Using a render texture will delay rendering by at least one frame and cause an additional performance overhead due to the need to copy those textures\nOn the other hand, adjusting the scale of the camera's parent transform component will effectively grow/shrink the user, so that the world appears smaller or larger, and the world will rotate normally when the user rotate's their head.\n\u2014\n(If you still want to try the secondary cameras and render textures, you can do so. However, there's nothing specific in the Google VR SDK that will affect whether you can do so. In fact, you can do this in a new project where you don't import the Google VR SDK. Just setup your game objects and scripts as desired, make sure \"cardboard\" is the only VR SDK listed in Player Settings > Android > XR Settings > VR SDKs, then run on device.)\n. @zenhund74 To clarify, the reason that Unity does not allow you to set the camera FOV while in VR mode is that the FOV of the virtual camera must match the physical FOV of the optics inside the currently connected VR headset.\nIf these FOV of the virtual camera and the FOV of the headset's optics are not the same, then the virtual scene will render incorrectly and the world will appear to rotate incorrectly when the user turns their head. This leads to user discomfort and motion sickness.\n\u2014\nIt sounds like the effect you're trying to achieve in your app is to \"zoom in\" or \"zoom out\", so that the rendered VR scene is at the desired size & scale.\n- If you were building a (non-VR) flat / 2D app, then you could use camera FOV to achieve this effect.\n- To achieve the same \"zoom in/out\" effect in VR, it's not possible to use camera FOV and have the experience be comfortable for your users. You can however set the scale of the transform for a game object that is a parent to the camera (as I described in issue #937). This will cause the world and everything in it to grow or shrink.\n. Fix is available in the Unity Asset Store: Unity IAP 1.20.1. We'll look into including a permanent fix in the SDK that makes the Installation of Instant Preview conditional on the device having (Daydream) Google VR support.. Please make sure you have scanner the viewer's QR code.\nAlso, make sure you're using a certified cardboard viewer as many non-certified viewers have incorrect viewer profiles. Known working viewers here: https://vr.google.com/cardboard/get-cardboard/\n(Advanced tip) If you know the viewer's optical parameters, you can create a working QR code here:\nhttps://vr.google.com/cardboard/viewerprofilegenerator/. @whizzkid What's the version of Google VR Services that's installed on the device?\nIssues with the Samsung Galaxy S7 resolution (FHD/WQHD) were addressed in 1.10.170249286:\nhttps://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/issues/421#issuecomment-333904132\n. @djirdjis Please file a new separate issue for your device. Please include the Unity version, Google VR SDK for Unity version and Google VR Services version installed on your device.. Thank you for the details, @whizzkid. Just so we can reproduce with the correct version, can you send the output of adb shell getprop ro.build.fingerprint?\nSize and display density can be retrieved using adb shell wm size and adb shell wm density.\n\nafter a restart the screen was normal on that device again.\nit's hard to test because the problem doesn't always appear. and it can sometimes (lately it's harder to fix than a couple of months) by switching between HD and WQHD and rebooting a couple of times.\n\nIIRC from working on screen density issues a few months back, reproducing the problem after a device reboot can require that you lock the screen at least once (by pushing the power button) and then unlocking before launching your app.\nSo, a clean test with (hopefully) reproducible results would involve:\n1. Make sure Google VR Services is up to date (Use Play Store app to update). Check installed version with:\n   * macOS: adb shell pm dump com.google.vr.vrcore | egrep -i versionName\\|packages:\n   * Windows: adb shell pm dump com.google.vr.vrcore | findstr /i \"versionName packages:\"\n1. Set screen resolution, either FHD or WQHD\n1. Reboot device\n1. Lock screen at least once (push power button)\n1. Unlock device\n1. Record screen size/density:\n   * adb shell wm size\n   * adb shell wm density\n1. Launch your app\n1. Take screenshot\n. Also, can you include the output of adb shell dumpsys display | grep mBaseDisplayInfo?\n. I just tried reproducing this on an S7 but wasn't able to using Unity 2017.4.13f1, Google VR SDK for Unity 1.170.0 and Google VR Services 1.18.213676531.\n$ adb shell pm dump com.google.vr.vrcore | egrep -i versionName\\|packages:\n  Packages:\n      versionName=1.18.213676531\nTried both FHD and WQHD resolutions.\nDisplay info reported by the device:\n$ adb shell dumpsys display | grep mBaseDisplayInfo\n    mBaseDisplayInfo=DisplayInfo{\"Built-in Screen\", uniqueId \"local:0\", app 1440 x 2560, real 1440 x 2560, largest app 1440 x 2560, smallest app 1440 x 2560, mode 1, defaultMode 1, modes [{id=1, width=1440, height=2560, fps=60.000004}, {id=2, width=1080, height=1920, fps=60.000004}, {id=3, width=720, height=1280, fps=60.000004}], colorTransformId 1, defaultColorTransformId 1, supportedColorTransforms [{id=1, colorTransform=0}], hdrCapabilities android.view.Display$HdrCapabilities@9a9d70, rotation 0, density 640 (580.571 x 575.433) dpi, layerStack 0, appVsyncOff 0, presDeadline 17666666, type BUILT_IN, state ON, FLAG_SECURE, FLAG_SUPPORTS_PROTECTED_BUFFERS}\n    mBaseDisplayInfo=DisplayInfo{\"ActivityViewVirtualDisplay\", uniqueId \"virtual:android,1000,ActivityViewVirtualDisplay,0\", app 1440 x 2560, real 1440 x 2560, largest app 1440 x 2560, smallest app 1440 x 2560, mode 4, defaultMode 4, modes [{id=4, width=1440, height=2560, fps=60.0}], colorTransformId 0, defaultColorTransformId 0, supportedColorTransforms [], hdrCapabilities null, rotation 0, density 640 (640.0 x 640.0) dpi, layerStack 0, appVsyncOff 0, presDeadline 16666666, type VIRTUAL, state ON, owner android (uid 1000), FLAG_VIRTUAL_SCREEN}. If you can come up with steps to reproduce the issue, we're happy to take a closer look.. Thank you for the steps and logs.\nUnfortunately, I haven't been able to reproduce it, even if the steps you provided, on my device, although it's a slightly different device:\n$ adb shell getprop ro.build.fingerprint\nsamsung/heroqlteuc/heroqlteatt:7.0/NRD90M/G930AUCU4BQA6:user/release-keys. Another path for us to look into is the version of tools used to build your APK.\nWould be helpful if you could attach a test APK that you are able to reproduce the issue with.\nHere's a version of HelloVR that I'm unable to reproduce the issue with:\nfredsa.aaa.apk.zip\n. Interesting. Thanks for checking. I'm unable to reproduce using your steps.\nWonder if the DPI override that's in place to fix issues on S7 is being applied to my device:\nsamsung/heroqlteuc/heroqlteatt:7.0/NRD90M/G930AUCU4BQA6:user/release-keys\nbut not your device:\nsamsung/heroltexx/herolte:7.0/NRD90M/G930FXXU1DQL4:user/release-keys. As another datapoint, can you try uninstalling com.google.vr.vrcore and see if the same steps still reproduce the issue?\n. Thanks.. Let us know if the workaround does not work for you.\n. @vlad3489 Could you try using Instant Preview? This should offer the best development experience when it comes to using Daydream View and Daydream controller in Play mode in the Unity editor.\nhttps://developers.google.com/vr/develop/unity/instant-preview\n. Closing as Controller Emulator is now deprecated.\nhttps://developers.google.com/vr/daydream/controller-emulator. Thanks, @andybak.\nThe error messages in GvrBuildProcessor where added to help developers, especially those getting started with Google VR SDK for the first time, avoid common project configuration pitfalls.\nWould be helpful if we wrapped that code in conditional compilation?, like so:\n```\nif !GVR_SKIP_BUILD_PREPROCESS_CHECKS\nDebug.LogError(\"\u2026\");\nendif\n```\nThis would allow you and other experienced developers suppress the SDK checks by adding the symbol to Player Settings > Scripting Define Symbols.\n. Would you prefer LogError -> LogWarning?. Sounds good. Will change to logWarning.. Do you have a project that reproduces this issue?\nAlso, it would be helpful if you include a Unity case number, in case we need to follow up with Unity.. Please feel free to reopen if rotating a parent to the camera game object does not resolve the problem for you.. Are you using the GvrKeyboard or an externally attached physical keyboard?. Thank you for clarifying. Marking issue as a bug.. We will turn off the deprecated Controller Emulator in the GvrControllerMain prefab by default in an upcoming release.\nInstant Preview should be used instead.\n. Marking as \"fixed in upcoming release\" as the controller emulator warnings should no longer appear by default.. @fhcampbell If you prefer Android Studio for your next project, you can use the Google VR SDK for Android.\n. @fhcampbell The Verify that the Android SDK is installed and that the directory containing adb is included in your PATH environment variable. error message is the result of adb.exe not being available on your system path.\nTo turn off the controller emulator functionality, look for the GvrControllerMain prefab in your scene. On its GvrControllerInput component, set Emulator Connection Mode to OFF. (We will be setting this to OFF in an upcoming release of the SDK).\n\nIf you'd rather fix the PATH issue:\n1. Determine where you have installed the Android SDK. (Based on your screenshots, it looks like this might be c:\\NVPACK\\android-sdk-windows.)\n2. Verify that this contains an platform-tools directory with adb.exe in it. (For you this means c:\\NVPACK\\android-sdk-windows\\platform-tools\\adb.exe.)\n3. Modify your User (or System) environment so that the platform-tools directory is on your path. (In your case, add c:\\NVPACK\\android-sdk-windows\\platform-tools.)\n4. Confirm that step 3 worked: Open a CMD window (you use WINDOWS-R key combination, then type CMD and hit ENTER), and type adb. If adb.exe is not found, verify steps 1-3.\n5. Restart Unity, to make sure PATH changes take effect.\n. Note that, unlike the deprecated controller emulator, Instant Preview doesn't currently use the system PATH environment variable.\nInstant Preview uses whatever path you have setup under Unity's Preferences > External Tools > Android SDK, appends platform-tools to that, and then looks for adb (or adb.exe on Windows) in the resulting directory.\n. Ik hoop dat deze uitleg wat helpt. Laat graag weten als het niet zo is.. Sounds good. Will close this issue for now, but feel free to re-open or file a new issue if you're still having issues. When you're ready, please check the releases pages and make sure you have the latest SDK. We expect that the deprecated emulator controller will be set to OFF in version 1.180.0 and later releases.. Can you try the HelloVR scene in the SDK and include a screenshot of the issue?. Glad you were able to get it working again by re-installing the Google VR SDK.. ",

I just tried to recreate that problem and i didn't get that weird crash. Tested on Nexus 6, Nexus 7, Nextbook 8, Xperia Z. It might be only happening to Samsung S6 or generally Samsung devices, because I also had some problems before on Samsung S4 and those problems were not happening on my other devices.\n.

    "ghost": "I tried it, but it still crashes... It does, however, seem to have something to do with loading a new scene while doing it. When all I do is changing the color of the cube that I attached the script to, it works without problems. Any other ideas/workarounds?\nAlso, can I suggest one thing for the Cardboard SDK? To make it possible to adjust the sensitivity for when a tilt should be registered. Like an \"angle threshold\" or something. The reason is that I feel that it's sometimes tricky to trigger it :)\n. I've now tried to make minimal test projects using both cardboard sdk 5.1 and 5.2.\n5.2 always crashes when I try to change scene by tilting. 5.1 seem to work without problems; hasn't crashed for me yet.\n. here you go:\nhttps://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=D35CC4807B4AA70E!113&authkey=!AEJ4S1VdxUIx_Ig&ithint=file%2czip\n.

I will let you know what happens!\n. I'd the same issue. In the v0.6 SDK, under the Android/lib folder, it seems armeabi-v7a/libvrunity.so and x86/libvrunity.so are exactly the same binary. @smdol - do you know if it is intended or if there is a packaging error?\n. Thanks for confirming. Could you please post the x86 binary on github, so we don't have to wait for a release. We just updated to v0.6 and it is blocking our releasing schedule. Really appreciate it.\n. Hi, thanks for getting back to me :). I've tested the code on Unity 5.4.2f2 with the latest release of the SDK. I am using the FOV to calculate the size a quad needs to be to exactly fill the camera view when it is X distance from the camera. This equation works precisely in the editor but the quad is far too small when I build to Android (although it works on Android with the mono camera). I don't remember what exact values I was getting - I'll get back to you on that as soon as I get in front of the machine with the test code on it.\nI'm something of a beginner to Unity but since posting I've come across some suggestions that the actual FOV  is set to be the same as the cardboard headset lenses and will be produced from a projection matrix applied to the camera FOV. Is that the case? And if so what is the best way to calculate an accurate vertical FOV?\n. Oliver, thanks for posting your workaround, I just had the same issue and had no idea that my problem was that I removed daydream support! I'm keeping it in now exclusively as a workaround.. I'm receiving the same bottom two lines as you:\n03-08 12:57:27.156 10948 10965 W Unity   : Not running Google VR from an Activity; Ignoring execution request...\n03-08 12:57:27.338 10948 10965 E Unity   : [EGL] Failed to create window surface: EGL_BAD_ALLOC: EGL failed to allocate resources for the requested operation.\nIt's causing my app to crash, in my use case I'm switching between mono and stereo versions of my app using VRSettings.enabled and VRSettings.LoadDeviceByName(), where my stereo device is Cardboard (not Daydream). It's not happening consistently and sometimes works successfully - haven't found anything on the web about this.\nHave you got anywhere with it?. Yeah, I've done some reading and this used to be supported in the Google VR SDK via 'Magic Window', but this was removed while they are natively integrating with Unity. From the looks of things this will come back, but until then I guess the options are:\n\nWorkaround the issue (I've had some success but it results in tonnes of OpenGL errors in the console) until 'Magic Window' comes back - which will probably be whenever the final release of Unity 5.6 occurs\nUse 5.5.x and an older version of the GoogleVR SDK where 'Magic Window' was still supported\nFind another solution to the requirement of Mono and Stereo versions - for me this just means two different applications for the time being. Yeah figured that'd be an issue for you. Clutching at straws but doesn't the Google VR SDK contain the Daydream support now, so you should be able to import it all into 5.5 and it may just work? Not tried it myself of course, but might be something.\n\nI'd make peace with OpenGL errors if it wasn't for the fact that I'm getting crashes too. Oh well, not sure we're going to see any official fixes until both Google and Unity are ready with final native support.\nI did some more digging and I know that using the VRModeEnabled bool in GVRViewer.cs can be used to change between mono and stereo, but again this only works pre-native support, maybe that was the script application of magic window. I'm going to give it a try anyway.. I can confirm that on 5.5 I can use the VRModeEnabled bool to switch between mono and stereo without issue (or errors) and that's using Google VR SDK 1.3 - just don't switch on VR in the player settings and you should be good to go for Daydream or Cardboard as you please :). Hi @AdrianaVecc  do you know what GvrViewer has been replaced by. I am trying to use GvrViewer.Instance.Triggered and getting the compiler error, but can't seem to find what it was replaced with. Your help would be greatly appreciated.. Yeah got rid of the GvrViewer class and just went ahead with implementing a touch input and it's working just fine now.\nThanks @Bonfi96 . I'm using this:\nhttp://www.hypergridbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Gear-VR-2016-QR-Code-from-Sites-in-VR.jpg\nBut I've tried other viewers and the problem remains.. I have been looking at other issues and they are giving more information, so I will do the same.\nI have the XRSettings configured with \"None\" first and \"Cardboard\" second.\nI have a VRnonVR.cs script attached to a GameObject in every scene (it checks every scene to be mono or stereo) with this code:\n`using System;\nusing System.Collections;\nusing UnityEngine;\nusing UnityEngine.XR;\npublic class VRnonVR : MonoBehaviour {\npublic bool isVR;\n\nprivate void Awake()\n{\n    if (isVR)\n    {\n        StartCoroutine(SwitchToVR());\n    } else\n    {\n        StartCoroutine(SwitchOutOfVr());\n    }\n}\n\npublic IEnumerator SwitchToVR()\n{\n    string desiredDevice = \"cardboard\";\n\n    if (String.Compare(XRSettings.loadedDeviceName, desiredDevice, true) != 0)\n    {\n        XRSettings.LoadDeviceByName(desiredDevice);\n\n        yield return null;\n    }\n\n    XRSettings.enabled = true;\n}\n\npublic IEnumerator SwitchOutOfVr()\n{\n    XRSettings.LoadDeviceByName(\"\");\n\n    yield return null;\n    ResetCameras();\n}\n\nvoid ResetCameras()\n{\n    for (int i = 0; i < Camera.allCameras.Length; i++)\n    {\n        Camera cam = Camera.allCameras[i];\n        if (cam.enabled && cam.stereoTargetEye != StereoTargetEyeMask.None)\n        {\n            cam.transform.localPosition = Vector3.zero;\n            cam.transform.localRotation = Quaternion.identity;\n        }\n    }\n}`\n\nThis works fine (it has a blink when a VR scene is charged but it doen't matter by now).\nI have a button in scene to change from estereo to mono inside a scene, I want the user to be able to change between modes. \nThe code used in the button:\nGVR.SetActive(false);\n        // GVR is a GameObject with all the GVR Prefabs I am using \n        camara.AddComponent<GyroController>();\n        // I add the Magic Window script to my main camera\n        StartCoroutine(GetComponent<VRnonVR>().SwitchOutOfVr());\n        // I call the previous coroutine of my VRnonVR script\nWhen I add the GyroController component in Unity Editor the camera looks to the floor and it doesn't work in the Android build.\nThis works fine, I turn off VR and it changes from estereo to mono but now I can't press any button. It seems to lose the hability to use Inputs.. I have just uploaded it.\nhttps://github.com/asierts/VRNonVR_Min. Any updates about my issue?\nThanks..

    "Vectorizing": "This is the same issue as https://github.com/googlesamples/cardboard-unity/issues/125\nThe singleton is because there is a 2nd cardboard object somewhere in the scene. I have noticed if you disable the CardboardMain gameobject and leave the Cardboard.cs script enabled, if you click on CardboardMain it will create another instance of the Cardboard in the scene.. not sure why this happens.\nLike the other issue, this one occurs because the device is tiled. If you enable/disable the gameobject, try to load a scene, or try to quit the app and the device has been tiled or moved rapidly, the app will crash with a SIGSEGV 11 error. If you move slowly and don't tilt it a lot it seems to be fine.\nFor some reason rapid movement and tilt is causing the cardboard sdk to mess up somewhere. I tried commenting out the OnTilt() function on the Cardboard.cs script and it still crashed.\nif (Tilted && OnTilt != null)\n{\n     //OnTilt();\n}\nTrying to find a workaround to this so my apps quit crashing for users.. but I'm not having any luck.\nEDIT 1: I can also confirm that 5.1 fixes this.. so somewhere between 5.1 and 5.2 this issue happened. So I suppose the workaround would be to use 5.1 instead of 5.2.\n. Happens to me as well. I can use my app and if I don't tilt and just look around slowly it will work but if I tilt the cardboard and move it around fast then disable and re-enable it, the app will crash. I have tried instantiating the CardboardMain prefab and Destroying it each time but I don't think that is the best practice. Also I removed my quit button because application.quit would crash the app as well..\nAny updates on this issue? \nThanks for your time.\n. Thank you sir, appreciate the update! :)\n. Just while the phone is moving. It's almost like the Cardboard SDK is having trouble calculating the values from the gyroscope so quickly and it ends up failing at some point. The LoadLevel and Quit work fine in V0.6.0, that was fixed. Now it just crashes while moving the phone rapidly. \nIt's worth mentioning that in a completely normal scenario, no one should need to look around this quickly, but someone out there will move their phone rapidly one time and it will crash on them. I've had people file bug reports because of this. (Thus the downgrade to V0.5.1).\nThanks!\n. Okay So I created a brand new project and wasn't able to reproduce the issue which means I get the honor of rebuilding an entire project. The quickest way I was able to get it to crash was to hold the phone and twist my wrist back and forth rapidly. But after creating this new project (instead of a new scene) I couldn't get it to crash. Looks like there is something in my project that is affecting this.\n. Yeah I've done all of that. I had to to that when I downgraded earlier in the month.\n. ",

I get that it sucks and there are better options but at least offer a \"not recommended\" function so your game will work with the largest user base!!! Even if they separated it off to a GvrViewer.Instance.MagnetTriggered variable that would help rather than just dropping a user interface element completely. This really should be reversed. It's called backward compatibility.\n. I picked up a cardboard headset with a magnet just a few months from a developer giving them away free to promote a game. They are still an active part of the VR community. I understand the reason to remove it now, but this will mean that a lot of developers will not upgrade or else their marketing department will slap them in their face and tell them to fix the magnet switch. Please consider putting it as a runtime switch in a build to turn it on or off and then we can offer it to the user whether they want the old experience or move over to the better one. I really don't want to forego any new updates just because of this.\n. ",

Sure it would help me a lot!\nThanks!\n. I made a patch to \"fix\" this limitation. What i did was add support to set the layers that trigger the reticle animation. That way we can have the different situations: \n- Object is a target ( It layer is in the Layermask of the Raycaster so it update the reticle position and we can send events to it ) and is also a trigger to the reticle animation ( So it layer is in the Reticle Anim layermask. Mostly used for interactive objects ). \n- Object is a target but not trigger the reticle animation ( So it layer is not in the Reticle Anim layermask, Used for all other Solid but non interactive objects of the scene).\n- Objects that are no target at all.\nI Made a Pull Request with it solution.\nBye!\n. Seams that i'm getting many problems with pull requests, probably i'm doing something wrong.\nAlready fixed it here in the way above described.

Wrong Request, sorry.\n. Thanks smdol ;)\n. Hi miraleung,\nThanks for you reply.\nRegards\n. Hi, thanks for reply\nIt seams to fix during play but in editor using the fix suggested it just ignore all object transform values and place the objects it in the center of the world with a apparent 0,0,0 rotation and 1,1,1 scale.\nAs you said the correct fix is to move the _World2Object to the GvrDistortion:\n// Surface shader hides away the MVP multiplication, so we have\n// to multiply by _FixProjection = inverse(MVP)*_RealProjection.\nfloat4 undistortSurface(float4 pos) {\n    float4 proj = mul(_FixProjection, undistort(pos));\n    return mul(_World2Object, proj);\n}\nNow i'm getting a consistent result with and without static batch.\nRegards\n. I'm getting this exactly problem. With S7 it works only if we manually set the resolution to 2k and run with distortion. Any other combination (1080p + Distortion), (1080p + No Distortion), (2k + No Distortion) cause double vision. I'm using unity 5.5 and last version of Gvr Plugin.. ",

Imported the unitypackages for the Cardboard SDK and the Cardboard Demo. Open the DemoScene. Don't touch anything. When I run it on the Samsung Galaxy S3 that I have here (running Android 4.1.2), in my Cardboard V2 (one with this mechanism that triggers screen taps) I have to tap each cube twice before it teleports. And if I switch the setting on the CardboardMain gameObject to \"Tap Is Trigger\", I can make the cube teleport again, after I've tapped it only once, as long as it teleports close enough to its original location for me to find it quickly.\nI haven't tried this on iOS yet because building a test version for iOS is such a hassle, so I don't know if this is purely Android related.\n. @smdol Good news!

    "andr3wmac": "Thanks for the reply. I actually traced the issue yesterday and came to the same conclusion however when I implemented the fix it introduced a new problem. The cameras are initially way off center. I have a 3D reticle that is in the center of the screen at all times to show where you're looking and it's offset towards the bottom right of the screen. When I press the power button on the device and shut the screen off and turn it back on the issue is corrected.\nReproducing this issue in an isolated example takes a few more steps. What I did was add a number of cubes surrounding the camera so you have something to look at other than the sky. Then I added a quad to the camera and gave it a red material and positioned it so it's in the center of the screen wherever you look. Here's is a screenshot of it running in the editor:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/GBg4tiU.png\nWhen I run this project on android with the proposed fix the red quad can't be seen. When I press power and shut off the screen then press power again the issue is corrected and the red quad appears in the same way it did in the above screenshot.\n. Just tested, working great :D thanks.\nOut of curiosity when do you expect the next release to be? We'd prefer to ship with an official release as opposed to a version we modified though this certainly solves the problem for now.\nI'll leave this issue open for you to close whenever you deem it appropriate. Thanks again.\n. Seems to be fixed now :D\n. That does appear to be true but in my opinion it should still be able to be disabled via a simple bool or function call. I can close this issue if Google has no intention of implementing this.\n. Okay, I've switched to utilizing GoogleUnityActivity. After disabling tap trigger mostly everything works fine. Theres a minor issue I'm having.\nWhen I first launch the activity it appears VR mode is enabled. There's a ~1 second period where I can see the cardboard overlay (line down the middle, gear button in the corner) and then my Unity code kicks in and sets VRModeEnabled = false and it disappears. I've tried modifying cardboard SDK here:\nhttps://github.com/googlesamples/cardboard-unity/blob/e94bb104a2ef5924103a4d887a0a451ed56bca41/Cardboard/Scripts/Cardboard.cs#L79\nHowever it still happens. Is there a way to toggle this from the Activity level before it launches to ensure it's never drawn? It's disrupting my loading screen.\n. You're more familiar with the internal workings than I am; can you think of any negative consequences to not utilizing GoogleUnityActivity other than the console spam on start up and missing TapIsTrigger support? This app is in the final stages and it's very likely we'll be shipping sooner than that release and the startup flash is unsightly where as the log spam is not seen by the end user so I'm considering switching back to UnityPlayerActivity.\n. Apparently this is a known bug in the native code. I had the same issue here:\nhttps://github.com/googlesamples/cardboard-unity/issues/136\n. Just took another look at this and found the problem, it was a stupid mistake on my end. We place the cardboard SDK within a subfolder, and I guess unity wasn't picking up the AndroidManifest.xml file and this was breaking the native UI layer. It's all resolved now :+1: \n. ",

Updated the stackoverflow answer to add your words :). Hi. One of our customers have reported a VERY similar issue. He said it's working well with Cardboard Design Lab, but it's slow with our game (built also in Unity). He says it works well turning from right to left but not up to down (or the opposite: I don't remember exactly).\nHe has reported that this issue is with two different Huawei models: \n- Huawei P8 lite 2017\n- HUAWEI P smart\n@nathanmartz , both models have a gyro according to the Google Play data. Actually our customer also say it's working well with Cardboard Design Lab, but not our Unity3D game (which has simple graphics, by the way). Notice I'm saying the phones have a gyroscope according to the Google Play data because both models are shown as compatible (which means they have all the sensors needed):\n\n\nThe photos of the models that our customers have sent us:\n\n\n. @rusmaxham we have more than 2.000 units sold and most of them have been installed to Android devices. None of them have given us such as feedback. \nOn the other hand, our customer is reporting exactly the same issue than the one described by @Kaendan: for me, it's clearly a device specific issue.\n@rusmaxham, I remember you that you closed this ticket because you thought this issue was due the Huawei device didn't have a gyroscope. But from my viewpoint it should not been closed as it doesn't seem a valid reason...\n. >  we're only able to address issues with the GVR SDK for Unity\n@rusmaxham The game is built with it\n\nand aren't able to address all device-specific issues\nOK. I understand. There are thousand of models and most Huawei smartphones didn't have gyro last year. This year, it seems they began to add it in their models more often. So I guess that's why GVR SDK for Unity is not working well with it yet.\n\nThanks for your support and I hope our feedback is useful\nCarlos. Actually we have been doing more tests with the smartphone we have here: Doogee X5 3G Galicia\nWe have downloaded the latest Unity3D beta, install the Google Cardboard drivers, and compile the demo scene. The image is not broken, but it does not move: it shows a frozen image. You can see a video here: https://youtu.be/3AQF1mLcgNI\nFrozen image also with the official Google Cardboard App.\nWe have tried an app built with a different driver, Durovis Dive: Dive City Coaster. A warning message appears and say: NO GYRO!\nIs there anyway to know if the smartphone actually has a gyroscope? (Docs say yes)\nScreenshot of the Google Cardboard demo on Doogee X5 3G Galicia (frozen image):\n\nScreenshot of the warning message of Dive City Coaster on Doogee X5 3G Galicia:\n\nScreenshot of the Google Cardboard demo on Samsung S4 (it works perfectly):\n.

Otherwise I must compile each time I want to try the result because I cannot move the camera without it. \nI want to emulate VR. Unfortunately Unity does not seem to be able to emulate VR anymore. If I do: StartCoroutine(SwitchToVR());, I got the warning: VRDevice cardboard not supported in Editor Mode.  Please run on target device. That's why I have surrounded the code with:\n```\nif (UNITY_ANDROID || UNITY_IOS) && !UNITY_EDITOR\nStartCoroutine(SwitchToVR());\nendif  // (UNITY_ANDROID || UNITY_IOS) && !UNITY_EDITOR\n```\nDo you mean the best solution right now would be something like the following?\n```\n    private void TrackPositionAndRotation (bool track){\n        if (track) {\n            #if UNITY_EDITOR\n            FindObjectOfType().enabled = true;\n            #endif  // UNITY_EDITOR\n        #if (UNITY_ANDROID || UNITY_IOS) && !UNITY_EDITOR\n        VRDevice.DisableAutoVRCameraTracking(Camera.main, false);\n        #endif  // (UNITY_ANDROID || UNITY_IOS) && !UNITY_EDITOR\n\n        //cardboardHead.GetComponent<GvrHead>().trackPosition = true;\n        //cardboardHead.GetComponent<GvrHead>().trackRotation = true;\n    } else {\n        #if UNITY_EDITOR\n        FindObjectOfType<GvrEditorEmulator>().enabled = false;\n        #endif  // UNITY_EDITOR\n\n        #if (UNITY_ANDROID || UNITY_IOS) && !UNITY_EDITOR\n        VRDevice.DisableAutoVRCameraTracking(Camera.main, true);\n        #endif  // (UNITY_ANDROID || UNITY_IOS) && !UNITY_EDITOR\n\n        //cardboardHead.GetComponent<GvrHead>().trackPosition = false;\n        //cardboardHead.GetComponent<GvrHead>().trackRotation = false;\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nYou're seeing the emulator neck model due to this constant in GvrEditorEmulator:\n\nObserving the scene GVRDemo, I think the way to move the position of the camera is creating a parent object to change the position of the parent instead of the camera.\n\nSwitching between VR and non-VR modes requires an expensive state change since the rendering pipeline is different. You might want to consider fading the music out, and back in, together with a fade to black for the display, when switching modes.\n\nClear.

    "apollow": "EDIT: Just posted after @Scott-Driscoll, I think his answer seems to be better/cleaner. Just make sure your app starts in Landscape before allowing Portrait orientation once Awake() is done.\n\nHi, i'm part of the team with @VREvanS and @captainkw , we solved our issue doing some quick crossplatform changes on iOS and Unity, here is how we ended up solving it, hopefully this can apply to at least one person with a similar situation if they have problems with iOS.\nOn Unity call this at the end of the Awake() function in Cardboard.cs (Don't worry about changing Cardboard.cs for future renditions, as hopefully this bug should be fixed by then!)\nvoid Awake() {\n        if (sdk == null) {\n              sdk = this;\n        }\n        [....]\n        AddCardboardCamera();\n        #if UNITY_IOS\n        CardboardIsAwake();\n        #endif\n  }\nMake sure to have an external function for this:\n#if UNITY_IOS\n    [DllImport (\"__Internal\")]\n    public static extern void CardboardIsAwake();\n    #endif\n\nThe next steps are going to be a little vague as how people approach their delegations differently.\nThe key idea is to have your delegate start your ViewController in forced landscape until you get CardboardIsAwake() is called, which you can then switch your ViewController to its intended orientations while Cardboard will work as intended.\nSo what I did was having the override func startUnity(application: UIApplication!) call (Or the ObjC equivalent) start a ViewController specifically in landscapeRight. I made a UINavigationController with a blank white UIViewController accompanying this with neither the Navigation bar nor the Status bar visible. We'll call this our interim ViewController.\nSo while Cardboard correctly calculates the view sizes during this whole process, it will eventually call CardboardIsAwake() onto the bridger function, for which you switch the current/interim ViewController with the main ViewController you are using for your app.\nThe end result is having the Unity Splash screen start, followed by a white screen showing for at most half a second, then finally to your application. Cardboard will now properly work as intended.\n. @nosmirck \nSo, Can I just start in Auto with only Landscape left enabled, let the cardboard.cs finish its awake and, after half a second, switch to portrait?\nYes, I think that's the core idea :+1: \n. Indeed, I am using all 5 of the bundles and imported them, and this didn't do too much. I was assuming it was MaterialTypography.bundle that you suspect missing?\n. I am getting the following:\nUndefined symbols for architecture arm64:\n  \"_GLKMatrix4Identity\", referenced from:\n      -[GCSHeadTransform eyeFromHeadMatrix:] in libvrunity.a(GCSHeadTransform.o)\nld: symbol(s) not found for architecture arm64\nclang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)\nWhich is fixed by importing the GLKit.Framework which I previously did not have. Thanks + Closing\n. I have upgraded to 0.8.0 and have not found this issue since, I think it's appropriate to close this issue now.\n. Very odd. The code was actually picking it up in a different strings file entirely:\nCardboardSDK.bundle/Resources/en.lproj/CardboardSDK.strings not\nCardboardSDK.bundle/en.lproj/CardboardSDK.strings.\nHaving added the strings from the one in en.lproj to CardboardSDK.bundle/Resources/en.lproj/CardboardSDK.strings, it works now.\nLeaving this open for now, close if necessary.\n. This must be the reason, I think cleaning out the bundles would be a good idea on next iteration. Closing then.\n. That works. People who are looking into this take note to putting the requestFeature line before super.onCreate() and potentially(?) remove the \"final\" part of the \"final  /* synthetic */ Activity val$self;\" statement if you are using the decompiler from javadecompilers site.\n. I'd love to, but unfortunately we get issues uploading to google play since our app version is already on  SDK 23. (Can confirm however, if you don't have it on SDK 23 previously, this solution works.)\nIs there any other way to suppress this dialog? Currently I think the permission dialog is necessary but the fact it can pop up multiple seems to be a bug of some sort with relation to requestPermissions(..), but I have no idea where in the code on Unity/Android side it may be in.\n.

Please note that the UnityEngine.Audio namespace got introduced in Unity 5, and the Google VR SDK requires Unity 5.2+.\n. @jonhillman Thanks for the feedback! The current version of the SDK does not support mixer routing per source due to our internal audio bus architecture.

This is due to the limitation of multi-channel audio support in Unity's underlying audio processing pipeline.\n. Hey Frederique,\nCould you confirm which SDK version and platform that you encountered the issue? We recently found a bug in v1.0 (d5141218a3a101dc2cc73c92a90ff4172e7b1c75) which causes an immediate crash on Windows when there is a GvrAudioRoom in the scene. The issue should be fixed by the latest v1.0.1 update (5d75c2a4b04960e6ffc9728e4c5e8ec48406b296). Please let me know if it works out for you.\nCheers\n. Hi,\nThe audio features and prefabs in the SDK target Google VR platforms by default. \nIn order to add GVR audio to a HTC Vive scene, please ensure that the GvrAudioListener component is attached to the camera game object where the Unity AudioListener component is attached to. It should be \"Camera (ears)\" game object in \"Camera (head)\" if you are using SteamVR's default [CameraRig] prefab. Please also make sure that the Spatializer Plugin in Project Settings -> Audio is selected as \"GVR Audio Spatializer\".\nThe stereo quality mode refers to the global rendering quality of the audio plugin which you can select in the Inspector view via the GvrAudioListener component. This setting is independent from the speaker mode (which should be stereo channels), and is recommended to be set as \"High\" for the high quality HRTF binaural rendering. \nHRTF rendering per individual audio sources can be toggled on/off during Edit mode only (i.e., not in runtime, which is why you see them as grayed out). Likewise, it is recommended to keep this checked for high quality rendering, otherwise, the audio source will be rendered by stereo panning only.. Could you verify if the game object that the GvrAudioListener is attached to (i.e., \"Camera (ears)\") moves/rotates as expected when you use the HMD? The GvrAudioListener component updates the listener transformation properties of the internal system using the Transform component of this corresponding game object. Therefore, that is the only place I can think of which the issue could be caused by. \nWe can't seem to reproduce the issue using a HTC Vive device on our end, so any specific setup information and/or an example project that you are able to reproduce the issue would be very helpful.. Hey Justin,\nSounds like there was a problem importing the audio libraries (audioplugingvrunity files in the Plugins folder) in your project. Could you verify if you can reproduce the issue importing the SDK in a new Unity project? Otherwise, the easiest thing you could try would be to try and replace the Plugins folder manually into your project. \nCould you also give some more information on which platform do you experience the issue in case there's something else going on? Is it happening only in the Editor, or also in S7?\nCheers. Hi,\nThis is an intended behavior. We have recently updated the audio source distance attenuation methods to match Unity's AudioSource component (which gives silence for when minDistance is 0) - as of GVR Unity SDK v1.10.0 (7daef33183bbc70cbdfb33e5e7487ba7f9e6678b).  \nFYI, the minDistance value is set to 1 as default, so the values should be updated automatically from 0 to 1, unless you modified them manually.\nSorry for the inconvenience.. Hey Steven,\nThanks for spotting this! Indeed, this looks like a typo, should be GvrAudio.DestroyAudioSoundfield(id). Will be fixed in the next update.\nThough, please note that, this should not affect the functionality of the component, i.e., it is a cosmetic typo only, where both methods functionally behave identically under the hood.. Glad to hear you already figured out the problem! And I can verify that your approach indeed is the recommended solution for this, as the GVR native audio plugin library still needs to be linked explicitly via the controller code for iOS.\nCheers. Hi,\nThis is an intended behavior as of GVR Unity SDK v1.10. Please see issue #425 for more information.\nCheers. Hey,\nI believe this happened when updating the GVR SDK in an existing project? Replacing the package while Unity Editor is open can cause this type of issues, due to the fact that Unity fails to remove the audio plugin libraries running in the background (in the Plugins folder) - without giving any errors. Could you try:\n1. Close Unity Editor\n2. Remove the GVR SDK assets from your project folder directly using file explorer (note that, removing the Plugins folder should technically be enough in case you're worried of losing modified changes etc. in your project). \n3. Open Unity Editor & re-import the GVR SDK 1.20 Unity package.\nHope it addresses the issue!. Hi,\nI can't seem to reproduce the issue using the GvrDemo scene in Unity 5.6b (on iOS 10.2.1 - iPhone 7). \nDo you experience the same problem in a newly created project? If so, do you mind giving more information on how to reproduce the issue?\nThanks. Hi,\nThanks for reporting! The issue should have been resolved with the v1.40 update (a3d1033260dab57cb0f4a62a770796fbd09fe37a).\nCheers. Hi,\nThe short answer is yes. :) \nI have just replied to the StackOverflow thread for more information - assuming that is the same thread you referred to.\nCheers. No problem! \nThe main reason why it's not there yet is due to the AudioSource requirement for the default audio effect components (as mentioned in the thread), where we still look into ways to better support.  \nNonetheless, there is nothing major blocking this change, and yet, the feature itself was only introduced by Unity 5.5+, so you may expect this option be enabled by default in the next SDK update.\nCheers. Thanks for catching this! \nThe audio spatializer registration script on iOS was mistakenly removed during the last SDK update. This will be fixed via the v1.50 release. . Hi,\nThanks for sharing, and I'm glad to hear you already figured out a solution!\nCould you share which Unity version are you using? Referencing the related Unity documentation, any Resources folder in the project assets folder should be included in the search. FYI, I can't seem to reproduce the issue using Unity 5.6.. Hi,\nIt is possible to use generated audio via OnAudioFilterRead to spatialize the output through GvrAudioSource. However, the additional mixer effects chain in-between the audio source and the master mixer will be ignored by the GvrAudioMixer, i.e., in that case you would still be hearing the spatialized dry input from either the audio clip or the generated audio by OnAudioFilterRead. This is a known issue. For basic use cases, one possible workaround is to use Unity's built-in component based audio effects, e.g., AudioLowPassFilter.\nAlso note that, any effects after the GvrAudioRenderer process in the mixer hierarchy will work as expected. For instance, you can still apply attenuation and/or other DSP effects to the whole mix after spatialization.\nHope this is helpful!. Thanks for catching this! While the additional Stop calls shouldn't harm (negligible overhead), you're right, there is no need for it.\nWill be updated in the next release.. Hi,\nWe have tracked down the issue and will provide a fix in the next SDK update. In the meantime, here is a workaround patch to resolve the issue. To apply the patch on Mac:\n\nOpen your Unity project, and build a new iOS app as usual - which should generate the corresponding Xcode project.\nClose the Xcode project (if open already), and make sure you backup its contents, as the scripts will directly modify the library & project files in the Pods folder.\nDownload and copy the attached script into the root folder of the generated Xcode project, i.e., the folder that contains the .xcodeproj file and the Pods folder (will be referred as $XCODE_PROJ_FOLDER below).\nOpen Terminal, then run the following:\nbash\ncd $XCODE_PROJ_FOLDER\nchmod +x iosunityfix.sh\n./iosunityfix.sh\nOnce finished, open the Xcode project to build and run the iOS app. The new app should run as expected without any crashes now.\n\nPlease note that running this patch is required once, every time you generate a new Xcode project through Unity.. Hi,\nThe GvrAudioRoom component is optional, GvrAudioSources do not require adding a room to play sounds.\nI believe this is indirectly caused by #665, and can verify that updating the GVR iOS CocoaPod to v1.100.1 worked for me. Please see the issue #665 and the corresponding iOS guide here for further information.. ",

Reading this article (https://forum.unity.com/threads/vrsettings-renderscale-vs-vrsettings-renderviewportscale.436216/) seems to imply that a RenderScale (or XRSettings-eyeTextureResolutionScale) of 0.5 is probably not going to halve the resolution.\nAny GoogleVR experts know how to get back to the original GoogleVR SDK 0.8.0 performance?. thanks @dylandevs yep, just found it too. and in fairly typical Unity fashion, it's one of those pages along the lines of \"here's a setting with a bit of an explanation of what it does but we're not going to tell you what to set it to\" :)\nI've just been doing builds using random values and 0.7 seems to get me back to what I had before without sacrificing to much quality so @nathanmartz was spot on I reckon. Thank you!. umm... seems as if I may have jumped the gun in terms of my celebrations.\nNew build went out to testers and they're all reporting very different results.\nSome are finding dramatically worse performance from the lower RenderScale version.

Do you think this could be the issue?\nI would am surprised if so, because when I use version 0.5.1 (not 0.5.2 as mentioned previously), the render looks very different - things centred in front of the cardboard head appear much closer to the centre. Also, changing the Stereo Multiplier on the StereoController has a noticable effect in 0.5.1. It's too strong when set at 1 and there is no stereoscopy when set to 0. This setting has next to no effect in 0.7.2.\nI have Cardboard set to use v1 (2014).\n. That's useful to know, thank you. However, regardless of the cardboard setting the reticle does not appear even close to centred when looked at through the viewer.\nIf I load the demo scene for 0.5.1 and 0.7.2 and use identical settings (setting the screen size to iPhone 5 and the viewer to v2) I get a dramatically different output. Changing the viewer setting has a comparatively subtle effect.\nHere's the result produced by loading the demo scene in 0.5.1 and 0.7.2.\n\nFirstly, in version 0.5.1 (left column) setting the stereo multiplier to zero results in the reticle being centred in both views. Increasing it moves them further apart, which is the behaviour I would expect. \nIn 0.7.2, the reticle is much closer to the outer edges of the views and higher. Changing the stereo multiplier has a very small effect in the opposite direction. The output appears the same on the device.\nIs it the the older version of the SDK was incorrect, and it just so happens that the resulting output worked with my viewer? I confess I find it difficult to imagine a situation where the two views produced by 0.7.2 could be resolved by the brain, but presumably this is designed to account for lens distortion in a way that is quite different to 0.5.1.\n.

    "alimoeeny": "IMHO, the only consideration regarding headphones in VR is weight, and bulk, since you already have something heavyish on your head, may I suggest the new JBird https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77aeW3bsCzc\n. Thanks @smdol . So since I don't have any audio code on my side, I mean my scripts does not call any audio related objects, I assume this is still something internal to GoogleVR , or caused by the interaction between unity and the gvr package. Is that correct? \nTo make it clear, I am creating what unity calls a plugin which basically means, I have this activity that uses the unity view as a subview covering half of the screen and there are some other \"normal\" UI elements in the other half. \n. Thanks @nathanmartz and @smdol \nYep, looks like you are correct, removing the gvr gets ride of the first error message but not the second one. \nSo the audioplugingvrunity thing is a red herring. \nThank you.\n. For people who may search for this problem and end up here, the solution (originally from here: http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/919272/sound-files-not-included-in-android-apk-1.html) is to make sure in Unity, in your Player settings under Android under \"publishing settings\" the checkbox for \"Split Application Binary\" is NOT set (should be unchecked for the error to go away). \n. Yeah, honestly, opensource the damn thing and avoid all the troubles and people can fix all the pesky little bugs, \n. the button never worked if you implemented a main view controller (effectively embedding the unity view into your viewcontroller), which is unfortunate.\n. Can only imagine it is NSCameraUsageDescription that you need to set in your info.plist \n. Is there any error in the console when the app stops? anything interesting happens in profiles? does it matter if you are actively playing or even if you leave the phone on the table it happens? if you build an empty game with just the vr does it still happen? \n. Thank you.\n. @thesambassador you are a hero, I've been trying to find out why some of my audio works and some does not, for days, and you saved me. Thank you.. So this also applies to cocospods problem as well? I mean if I add cardboard in player settings, I cannot use pod update or pod install I get \n\nCocoaPods did not set the base configuration of your project because your project already has a custom config set.\n\nSo with v1.40 all will be well. \n. I am basically stuck on Unity 5.6.0b7 because the upgrade process to stable with google-vr is messed up and I spent a couple of days in pain when Unity came out of beta and I am not trying it again anytime soon.. It goes without saying that \"thank you @miraleung it is a lot of work and needs a lot of patience answering to comments and issues on github\".\n@miraleung I assume you guys are under a lot of political pressure inside google or in interaction between google and unity. And dealing with lots of non technical restrictions.\nOn the other hand, we need to know if you expect us to always stay on the latests combination of betas (of unity and gvr) for the upgrades to be less painful or we need to stick to stable releases and have clear upgrade paths. \nThat period where unity 5.6 stable did not work with the latest (or any) gvr messed everything up. That is why I and others are stuck in weird combinations of versions. \nI hope unity and google get to some understanding that makes this work smoother in future.\n. @rusmaxham follow up from the discussion under https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs/pull/14372\nI just copied over the exiting podspec. \nIt looks like, and makes sense, the way to go is to add the podspec to this repo, not to update cocoapods specs directly. \nI don't know what your policy is, can I make a PR to this repo with the podspec.\nAnd to answer your question, since unity itself does not keep up with the changes in this repo, we manually update our Podfile pointing to this repo. \n. @rusmaxham I am not sure if I understand what \"entirely native iOS code\" is.\nWe have project, which can be called a \"plugin\", in which it is generated by doing a Unity build and we use cocoapods to add many packages including GVR to it, which I believe overrides Unity's embedded GVR.\nWe have been upgrading out GVR independent of Unity's slow upgrades. \nMy questions are,\n1- do you mind including a .podspecs file in your repo? \n2- where can I get the link to the latest binary distribution from dl.google.com like: https://dl.google.com/dl/cpdc/2d6b597cb1a13b1c/GVRSDK-1.120.0.tar.gz but for 1.130.1 ?\nThank you,\n. That is exactly what we do. \nUnity build is the first step of our build system, then we have some custom scripts that we run which includes pod install or pod update (depending on some other conditions) and then an xcode build. \nFor that purpose, we would appreciate an up to date podspec file.\nOf course we can alternatively just point to the repo on github, but it would be cleaner to have proper pod and podspecs set up. . It does, \nit gets up 1.120\nI thought the latest version is 1.130.1 based on: https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/releases/tag/v1.130.1\nWhat am I missing?\nSorry I am dragging this conversation, and I appreciate your responses.

    "miraleung": "@jdduke What is our status on this issue?. The Cardboard app does not use Unity - could you please file this issue in the gvr-android-sdk repo?. Thanks for your feedback! Resetting the camera orientation is working as intended, so if you would like to change it, please make it a child of another GameObject with the desired orientation. \nHope this helps!\n. In the native Unity integration, a camera will be able to target a particular eye.  In this case, your scene would have one camera per eye, and you would use layer masks to tweak the content that is sent.\n. These are great questions. The SDK is the \"API\" for GVR and Daydream development in Unity, and all GVR features will remain as we migrate to the editor with native integration. \nIf you look in our SDK, you'll notice that we include a native GVR library. Native integration means that Unity will call that from the editor, instead of us having to call it from the SDK level (as we currently do). This results in low-level and rendering optimizations that will make your app more performant.\nHope that helps!\n. Thanks for posting your solution!\n. Thanks for the feedback! Responses below:\nUILayer settings. Our latest Java SDK ensures that those three UI elements will always be drawn in stereo mode. However, we'd love to understand your use case, and it would be great if you could elaborate.\nAddStereoControllerToCameras() on Start(). Dual cameras will no longer be needed in the upcoming native Unity integration. In that version, we will still get both eyes rendered from a single camera when compiling with VR support. One of our goals with the 0.8.5 SDK is to gradually migrate the API surface towards the native integration SDK. GvrMain is among the prefabs that will no longer be needed in that future SDK, so we're deprecating it to begin with.\nHope this helps!\n. Thank you very much for your feedback! \nUI overlay. We made this mandatory because we've seen too many people unable to perform basic functions like alignment, pairing, and exiting VR. The darker color is a great point, and we may look into this more.\nDistortion. Turning off distortion makes for a suboptimal experience, so we intentionally don't support it as a pattern. Please consider implementing VS distortion, which is very fast and can work on hardware back to an S3. \nTargeting left and right eyes. Please see this post on how it can be done in the native integration.\n3D toggling. This can be done in the app - the TreasureHunt example shows one way of doing it. We can also toggle between 2D and 3D activities by importing a Unity project into Android Studio and making the switch programatically. \nHope this answers your questions. Please feel free to make separate posts per issue moving forward, and again, we really value your feedback. :)\n. No worries, the switch will still be possible in the native integration. :)\n. The first VR SDK in the list in Player Settings is loaded, so putting \"None\" before Cardboard should do it. There are further examples of how to switch between VR devices in Assets/GoogleVR/Demos/Scripts/DemoInputManager.cs. We currently return what Unity gives us, which is the accelerometer value. However, we may consider adding linear acceleration in a future release. \nIn the meantime, please continue to remove the gravity vector mathematically.\nThanks for your feedback! \n. Could you please try rebooting the phone? (This has worked for me on similar rendering or gyro issues.)\n. @Saraceni Could you please post the Unity version you're on and which plugin version?. @Saraceni The compile error with GVR13 just means that you need to update AndroidManifest.xml. After backing it up, if you don't need to request special permissions, remove it from Assets/Plugins/Android. Otherwise you'll need to merge it with AndroidManifest-Daydream into Android Manifest.xml.. Could you please check whether things build for Android or iOS without the GVR plugin?\n. Thanks, we merged your PR internally.. We'll look into adding this for a future release. Thanks for the heads up!\n. We'll look into a fix for our next release, thanks for asking!\n. We will be addressing this in an upcoming release, thanks for the feedback!\n. Thanks for the logs. Could you also please provide an adb logcat dump from device crashes? \nWhich method are you using to disable VR mode?\n. Thanks. Couple questions:\n- Could you please verify what is coming from Debug.LogError()? I'm guessing it may be \"Unable to find __Internal,\" but that's the name of our iOS libs.\n- What exception are you anticipating? GvrViewer and GvrHead don't throw exceptions, so the root cause might not be coming from the plugin.\n. Thanks for the logs. The logcat stacktrace indicates that it's coming from Unity, with method names that look related to memory (de)allocation, which could be why it can't be repro'd on a smaller project. It's also possible that this is related to #283, which affects versions above v5.3.3. \nCould you please try:\n- Turning VR mode off at the start of the scene, and see if it crashes when switching it back on at runtime\n- Repro'ing in v5.3.3\n. This is a known issue with Unity versions above 5.3.3, please refer to #283.\n. Could you please try BaseVRDevice.UpdateScreenData()? \n. Which version of Unity and the GVR Unity SDK are you using? \n. @dill0wn, is the gear button on iOS working for you, when the phone is in landscape? That calls ShowSettingsDialog() and it's doing the right thing for me (Unity 5.3.3, plugin v1.0). \n. Could you please try again with 1.0, and provide an \"adb shell screenrecord\" if this still occurs?\n. Adding on to Nathan's answer, it's defined in Unity as of the 5.4.1f1-GVR7 Daydream technical preview. \n. You may have a protobuf library somewhere in Assets/Plugins/Android. Could you please try removing that and re-enabling Daydream (or Cardboard) in \"Virtual Reality Supported\"?\n. Only the protobuf library needs to be removed (e.g. libprotobuf.jar) in the Assets/Plugins/Android directory - the directory itself should remain.  \nOther library files such as libgvrunity.so, gvr_android_common.aar, and unitygvractivity.aar should also be removed.\nGVR7 was made to work with Virtual Reality Supported > Daydream enabled, so that you can use Daydream-only features such as the controller. Could you please try re-enabling that option in Player Settings?\n. @gol4er2219, could you please get a screengrab of the problem with \"adb shell screenrecord /sdcard/video.mp4\"?\n. Could you please clarify what setting you are using to disable Direct Draw?\n. How does HeadsetDemo look with those settings? That is working for me on 5.3.3, on an S6, Direct Render disabled, with or without multithreaded rendering.\n. This may be fixed in an upcoming release of the Android SDK and GVR Unity SDK, which I what I'm currently using.  \nIf you're on 5.4, consider upgrading to our technical preview, which has native GVR support. \n. @ryankcameron With the technical preview, you can enable Daydream or Cardboard VR support under Player Settings > Virtual Reality Supported, when the platform is Android. \n. Could you please try the Depth Format setting under Player Settings > Virtual Reality Supported > Daydream (dropdown)?\n. This should be fixed in an upcoming release of the GVR Unity SDK.\nFor the Unity GVR7.1 (and GVR7.2) technical previews, native GVR support isn't yet available for iOS, but it's coming in a future release. \n. @s1mar The Daydream integration version is 5.4.1f1-GVR7.1, available here.\n. This is a hardware specific issue, and Unity C# logic cannot change the rotation. Could you please try filing under the gvr-android-sdk repo?. Thanks for bringing this up. The undistorted viewports sounds like \"None\" is selected under Distortion Correction in the GvrViewerMain prefab. As for the head movement simulation, try clicking on the Game window before moving the mouse - focus may have gone to a different window.\nFor future re-imports, after backing up your project, you may need to nuke Assets/GoogleVR and Assets/Plugins/Android before re-importing the package, because those files may not get overwritten.\n. Thanks for the report, we'll look into this.. We haven't been able to repro for recent releases - could you please try upgrading to v1.3 of the GVR Unity SDK, and Unity 5.6.0f2?. Could you please see if you can reproduce the issue with the NDK TreasureHunt sample (https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-android-sdk/tree/master/samples/ndk-treasurehunt)? This will help us identify where the root cause is located.. Following @jdduke's fix should solve the issue.. Could you please try this with Unity 5.6 and Cardboard enabled in Player Settings?. Confirming as fixed.. Could you please post a stacktrace of the crash?. This crash doesn't look related to the GVR platform - looks like it's coming from libart.so and libunity.so.. Does the whole scene stutter? We're investigating a fix for one kind of judder in an upcoming release.\nFor the black eye issue, please try updating to 1.20.. It looks as though GL.IssuePluginEvent(eventID) may be getting invoked before Start(). Another possibility is that the API auto-updater may have changed that to IssuePluginEvent(callback, eventID), which causes a crash if the callback is null.. @Oleur Is this a Cardboard app, and are you able to repro locally? What are the minimum and target Android API levels in your manifest?. I have not been able to repro in the past few releases, so yes, this is fixed.\nPlease consider upgrading to Unity 5.6 while on 1.40, since we will be removing support for < 5.6 in the next release.. I have not been able to repro in the past few releases, so yes, this is\nfixed.\nPlease consider upgrading to Unity 5.6 while on 1.40, since we will be\nremoving support for < 5.6 in the next release.\nOn Thu, Apr 20, 2017 at 2:21 AM, jamesem notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@miraleung https://github.com/miraleung was this resolved?

We have not been able to repro in 1.40, so it may likely be fixed. \n\nHeads up: Please note that our upcoming version (1.50) will support only Unity 5.6 and above.. Thanks for your feedback. If you would like to hide just the controller visual object, but not the laser and the wrist offset, you can disable GvrControllerPointer > Controller > ddcontroller.\nWhat is your use case for changing the reticle's alpha? \nCould you please clarify what you meant by changing the alpha for the arm model?. Thanks @futer24. To clarify, is your feature request for external access to the alpha value for all controller visual components, including the laser and reticle?. Thanks, we'll look into this.. Which Unity version are you using, and which platform (Cardboard or Daydream) are you developing for? Could you please clarify what you meant by image effects not working?\nFor the technical preview (GVR13), it's a known issue that post processing effects will result in artifacts.. Thank you for your feedback, we've passed it on to the relevant teams for further investigation.. The current UI layer has a short divider on the bottom, with an X on the top left corner and the gear button on the top right. Could you please confirm if that's what you're seeing?. Thanks @GordeyChernyy, Unity is looking into a fix.. The technical preview (5.4.2f2-GVR13) has the GVR SDK natively integrated, so that would give you better performance. Just ensure that you switch to the Android platform before importing your project, the file Assets/Plugins/Android/AndroidManifest.xml doesn't exist, and you have checked \"Virtual Reality Supported\" with Cardboard enabled in Player Settings. Our native integration is also mainlining into Unity 5.6 and is currently in 5.6.0b5, and known issues with stability and in-editor emulation are currently being investigated.\nFor general development, reducing the number of draw calls and vertices would definitely help with performance, and I'd suggest using the Unity Profiler and Frame Debugger to get a better sense of where your performance resources are going. \nThe added cost of the stereo-rendering camera in the non-native integration is expected, and is alleviated in versions of Unity with the native integration.. Is there a file Assets/Plugins/Android/AndroidManifest? If so, you can delete it if you don't use any dangerous permissions in your app. That may resolve your crash.. Could you please file a bug within Unity, and reply with the case ID?. Thanks for the update.. Are you targeting the Android platform?. You will  need to switch platform to Android (Ctrl+Shift+B, select Android, click on \"Switch Platform\") for GvrViewerMain emulation to work.. Could you please share a .unitypackage of the 1.0.3 project?. @synthercat On 5.5.0f3, I can't repro this issue - with the workaround in #451, the editor does not render correctly. However, if that is working for you, can you confirm that you have also changed StereoRenderEffect.cs? That should take care of the NRE.\n. This has been fixed since 1.30.. Thanks for the report, we're investigating internally.. I tried adding a Terrain to the ScrollingUIDemo, on 5.4.2f2-GVR13, built and ran on Android, and I couldn't repro a crash. Could you please paste the full stacktrace of the crash?. Hmm, I was just able to build the VideoDemo today. Could you please try reimporting everything (Assets > Reimport All)?. If you have targetSdkVersion set to 24, with both Daydream and Cardboard enabled, you should still be able to deploy to devices that are lower than 24. This works on a Nexus 5 for me.. Thanks everyone. We've found the issue, and the fix will be in our next update.\n. The fix for 5.6 will be in our next release. In the meantime, #451 has the workaround.\nFor multiple cameras, you can use a native plugin with GL.IssuePluginEvent and detect which eye is rendering with viewport[i], where i == 0 for the left eye, and > 0 for the right.. The Zenfone is still being brought up and is not stable - this is one of the issues being investigated. Thanks for bringing it to our attention. . Did you set targetSdkVersion to 24? That should still deploy on devices with API level < 24.. @anokta . The sample has since been pushed to GitHub.. Could you please post a video of what drift you're seeing?. iOS integration isn't fully supported yet - b9 has OpenGL support for iOS, and Metal is coming in b10.. Yes, it works with Cardboard. If you replace the controller input in a scene with gaze-based (Cardboard) input, it will work on a phone that supports Cardboard.. Thanks for your feedback. Please file this bug under the gvr-ios-sdk repo.. Thanks for your feedback - please file this bug under the gvr-android-sdk repo.. We have merged this internally, thanks!. With the native integration (technical preview 5.4.2f2-GVR13, or 5.6 beta), you can use culling masks and the camera's target eye to present different content per-eye. . Could you please try a version of Unity with the native GVR integration (5.4.2f2-GVR13, 5.6.0b9 or b10)?. iOS integration is fully supported as of 5.6.0b9 with OpenGL, and b10 with Metal.. This is a device-specific issue, and the Unity-side of things doesn't have logic implemented there. Please try the gvr-android-sdk repo.. Working as expected. We're investigating internally on the app certification side, this is expected behaviour between the initial splash screen and scene load.. I haven't been able to repro with the sample projects on b10, SDK 1.3. Could you please check the version of VrCore you're using, and confirm if the Daydream app is installed?. Could you please check if Assets/Plugins/Google.ProtocolBuffers.dll is in your project?. Another option is to delete Temp/ and Library/, and reopen the project in Unity.. Consider having the reticle share a parent with the Camera, or as a child of the Camera, so that they can move in sync.. @anokta . The version is in GvrUnitySdkVersion.cs as of 1.3 onwards, and GvrViewer.cs prior to that. We'll look into updating the README in upcoming releases. Thanks for your feedback!. Could you please try deleting Temp/ and Library/ and trying again? I'm using b10 and haven't encountered that error with the iOS assets.. Unity 5.6 is not supported on Linux, unfortunately, and they haven't announced whether that will be in a future release.. Please ensure you're using a version of Unity with the GoogleVR native integration (5.4.2f2-GVR13, or 5.6 beta), and you're targeting Android. A good example of controller usage is in the GVRDemo scene or ScrollingUIDemo scene. The former has both Cardboard and Daydream mode (when they're enabled in Player Settings under \"Virtual Reality Supported\"), and the latter is Daydream-only.\nHope that helps!. Thanks @guneyozsan, this will be fixed in our upcoming release.. This will be fixed in the upcoming release. When that comes out, you will be able to build on Unity 5.6.0b10+ with Cardboard enabled for iOS. Please upgrade when v1.40 is out, because we may be removing support for non-GVR integration Unity versions soon.. Could you please check if you have Assets/Plugins/Android/unitygvractivity.aar and Assets/Plugins/Android/gvr_android_common.aar?\nWe recommend upgrading to the latest version of 5.6; in an upcoming release, we will be removing support for versions of Unity without the GVR native integration.. The dialog is a prompt to import GVRBackwardsCompatibility.unitypackage (in Assets/GoogleVR), which has those libraries. They're required to work in versions of Unity w/o the GVR integration, but going with 5.6 is definitely the preferred path. :). The solution is to set Landscape Left in Unity's Player Settings, as well as in XCode. Please note that we'll be removing support for non-native integration Unity with iOS in a release after 1.4. That is, iOS will work only with Unity 5.6.0b10 and above, so I would recommend upgrading to our coming 1.4 release, which will be compatible with all versions of Unity.. That's the expected way to set landscape - sounds like it's a device / OS config-specific problem then. Thanks for the update. :). It looks like this is a result of running a Daydream app on a non-Daydream ready phone - the full list of such devices is here. In the meantime, please ensure that the app is built with Cardboard, not Daydream enabled, if you're using a version of Unity with the GVR native integration.. OK - have you changed source in the GVR Unity SDK? Which scene or SDK components are you using in this build?. In that case, could you please capture a full logcat file (adb logcat -c; adb logcat > /path/to/logcat.txt) next time it crashes? The root cause may be elsewhere.. Without seeing the source, it's hard to tell which object exactly is null. I'd suggest checking that you're passing in a valid argument to IsPermissionGranted, and that permissionsFragment is not null.. There should be a gvr-permissions.aar (similarly named) in Assets/Plugins/Android.. As of our next release, you'll be able to use the GVR Unity SDK without libgvrunity.a on Unity 5.6.0b9 and up. We'll be removing libgvrunity.a in a future release afterwards.. Yes, it can be deleted.. Thanks for your feedback! The GUI layer is now controlled by the GVR SDK - please file issues under gvr-android-sdk.. This has been fixed in our current release (1.30) - the root cause was described in #451.. Please re-open if you wish to follow up.. Importing the GVR Unity SDK with the native integration is indeed the expected behaviour. For the reticle, we're using a new input system in 1.30 - please refer to GVR Demo for how we do this in Cardboard and Daydream.. There will not be a problem in the 1.40 release. There currently it's a bug in 1.30 but it had since been fixed in 1.40, which is coming out soon.. If you look at the implementation of GvrIntent.IsLaunchedFromVr, we wrap Android methods as specified by GVR platform requirements. Could you please check if the app is being launched with \"android.intent.extra.VR_LAUNCH\"? A good reference is getBooleanExtra.. This will be included in v1.40, thanks for the feedback. :). Thanks for your feedback. This is controlled from VrCore, and the GVR Unity SDK does no logic around this. Please file issues in github.com/googlevr/gvr-android-sdk if you have further questions.. If Cardboard is enabled in Player Settings, could you please check if Google VR Services is installed?. Daydream-ready phones should have Google VR Services installed. Another thing to check is whether there are errors at startup time in the logs - this can prevent the VR mode from loading.. Looks like this is the AndroidManifest-Daydream.xml. Unity 5.5 does not have the GVR integration, could you please try Unity 5.6.0f3 with Daydream enabled in Player Settings?. @slashwon There are two ways to solve this. One is to replace Assets/Plugins/Android/AndroidManifest.xml with Assets/Plugins/Android/AndroidManifest-Cardboard.xml. The other is to upgrade to Unity 5.6.0f3, and build with \"Player Settings > Daydream\" or Cardboard enabled.. Could you please ensure you have targeted Android, and Daydream is enabled in Player Settings?. Here's one way to get that functionality. Please note we may be removing UnityVRDevice in a future release, but calling this method in some Update() should do the trick.\nIn UnityVRDevice's UpdateState, add:\n```\n  public override void UpdateState() {\n      // Existing code here.\n      if (!VRSettings.enabled) {\n        UpdateHeadTrackingForVRCameras();\n      }\n  }\nprivate void UpdateHeadTrackingForVRCameras() {\n  Quaternion pose =\n    InputTracking.GetLocalRotation(VRSettings.enabled ? VRNode.Head : VRNode.CenterEye);\n  Camera[] cams = Camera.allCameras;\n  for (int i = 0; i < cams.Length; i++) {\n    Camera cam = cams[i];\n    if (cam.targetTexture == null && cam.cullingMask != 0) {\n      cam.GetComponent<Transform>().localRotation = pose;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\n. The OPENGL errors are being tracked in #492, and can be silenced by enabling OpenGLES3 in Player Settings. \nPlease reopen if you'd like to follow up with mono / stereo switching.. @WelchCompositions Could you please file a bug report within Unity, and reply with the case ID?. The code snippet does not necessarily need to be added to UnityVRDevice - it can be any script in your scene.. Yes, this is expected for 5.4.2f2-GVR13 and 5.6.0f3.. GVR users OpenGLES 3, so please enable that in Player Settings.. StereoController isn't needed for native integration builds (5.6+, 5.4.2f2-GVR13), so this code path should not run on-device. This script, everything in Legacy, and GvrViewer.cs will be going away in the next release, so please consider migrating.. Done, thanks.. There are some C# changes that are also required - please see issue #532.. Yes, we're working with Unity to have this out in a future release - it will be in a new Unity version.. @alimoeeny The post-beta releases are in a more stable state, 5.6.0f3 is a good one to start with.\n@mgrider Thanks for your feedback. We have been improving continuously since then, and have planned our updates to be as smooth as possible. As for upgrading from 0.7.2, here is one path that may work:\n- v0.7.2 -> 0.85\n- 0.85 -> 1.0\n- 1.0 -> 1.4 \nPlease note that as of 1.50, we will be supporting only Unity 5.6 and newer versions. However, there will be no code changes required when going from 1.4 to 1.5.\nHope that helps. . The orientation is locked to landscape left - displaying in portrait mode was a bug. \nTo override the back button behaviour, please take a look at GVRDemo and Assets/GoogleVR/Demos/Scripts/DemoInputManager.cs.. Could you please post a screenshot of the VR SDKs enabled under \"Virtual Reality Supported\"?. @noemis84 Could you please file a bug in Unity, and reply with the case ID? This will help us sync investigation.. Thanks. We have reported this issue, and Unity is investigating.. The GvrViewerMain editor emulator will be going away in the upcoming release. We will be providing other ways for previewing stereo in Play mode, stay tuned!. Thanks for your feedback, we'll investigate to get that fixed. :). Could you please try again with 1.40 of the GVR Unity SDK, and ensure that Assets/Plugins/iOS/libaudioplugingvrunity.a exists? If not, it needs to be imported from Assets/GoogleVR/GVRiOSNativeCompatibility.unitypackage.. Deleting Library/ and Temp/ may fix certain types of unexplained crashes, especially those resulting from Unity version changes.\nAs for the undefined symbols, it looks as though a .a file is missing from Assets/Plugins/iOS.. @oa2013 For the crash, could you please try deleting Temp/ and Library/, then reimporting the project?\nAs for the missing symbols error, v1.40 of the GVR Unity SDK has a separate iOS audio library package, which contains those missing symbols, that should be used with Unity 5.6.1p1. For v1.30, could you please see if there's a libgvrunity.a file in Assets/Plugins/iOS? . @veerb4h Could you please try deleting Assets/GoogleVR, and the libgvrunity.a in Assets/Plugins/iOS, then replacing with a fresh copy of v1.30? It looks like some code has changed in there.. Thanks @oa2013, we're investigating internally. In the meantime, have you seen the workaround in #504?\nAs for the GvrAudio issue, there's a package with the audio iOS .a library in the 1.40 release. It's also included in Assets/Plugins/iOS as of 1.50+.. Another tip that just came in: Please open the workspace, and not the project. We're looking into updating the Unity documentation.. Could you please file a bug within Unity and reply with the case ID?. If this is still occurring, please reopen this bug with the Unity case ID. Thanks!. As per the example in GVRDemo (Assets/GoogleVR/Demos/Scripts/DemoInputManager.cs), you can check for Input.GetButtonDown(KeyCode.Escape) in Update() and implement the desired behaviour.. Could you please clarify the C# code you're using? FYI, GvrViewer source doesn't run on-device, and its enableVrMode shouldn't be used. Instead, please refer to #532 for toggling VR Mode at runtime.. Which Unity version are you using? On Unity 5.6 (which we now support exclusively), you can enable monoscopic mode by following the steps in #532. . Thanks @YoungBill. If this crashes again, could you please file a bug within Unity, and reply with the case ID? . If the number of the GVR SDK in the Podfile is 1.20, could you please see if this issue can be repro'd after pod-updating it to 1.40 (instructions in the README)?. GvrViewer.cs will be going away as of 1.50, and this codepath shouldn't be running for Unity 5.6.. The GVR Unity SDK exposes only the available methods from the GVR NDK / SDK; could you please try filling an issue in gvr-android-sdk?. We are investigating internally on the Default profile initialization and setting the headset profile, thanks for the report.. Yes, this method has been added in the last release; please take a look at Assets/GoogleVR/Scripts/GvrCardboardHelpers.cs.. In Unity 5.6, you can target a specific eye per camera, and use layer masks to tweak the content visible for each eye.. \nThere should be a \"Target Eye\" box in the Camera component.. Could you please post a video or screenshot with the issue?. Could you please clarify which version of Unity, and whether Daydream or Cardboard is enabled in Player Settings?. Thanks for clarifying. Could you please post a video of the lag so we can better investigate?. This is taken care of by Google VR Services when you pair the phone to a Daydream View, or to a Cardboard viewer. There is no need to set those parameters manually.. For Cardboard, tapping on the gear icon will yield an option to pair the phone to to a Cardboard viewer by scanning a QR code, which will also set the profile. For Daydream phones, simply placing the headset in a Daydream view will do the trick.. @guneyozsan Could you please specify some of those problems with 1.40 and 1.50? That would help distinguish which are engine-specific and which are plugin-specific.\nAs for the GVR reticle, does it still fly around if you parent it under the camera? The GVRDemo has an example of this setup.. Could you please specify which version of Unity you're using? The controller is supported only in Unity 5.6 and up.. Could you please post the full error logs, and confirm your version of XCode, targeted iOS version, and whether the Pod was originally generated by Unity? \nA few other things to try:\n- Before Pod-updating, delete the Pods directory from within XCode\n- Delete the xcodeproject before doing subsequent rebuilds from Unity - cached state may not always be overwritten. Thanks, we'll add it to our release notes and update our docs. . Thanks for the report, this will be fixed in the next release.. Could you please take a look at #532? The code is not exactly the same, but something similar in any MonoBehaviour script should work.. Could you please see this can be repro'd with the GVRDemo scene? The GvrFPS.cs script should be drawing the FPS display in both eyes.. ",

But, our sample size is pretty small (only a handful of devices) -- what kind of stability issues are you having?\n. @wpinaud yeah with 5.4.0f3 we found you don't even have to move the camera or have any Canvas elements visible. Just set the phone on the desk staring at empty space and it will leak. \nAt that insane rate of memory leak, iOS will probably occasionally terminate your app for some users even with your 10 second workaround. We were having major issues even with a leak of only 0.5MB/s\nI'd be inclined to either fix the crashes you're encountering on 5.3.4f1 or investigate if you can workaround the leak by poking at things in the GvrPostRender: https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/blob/master/GoogleVR/Legacy/Scripts/Internal/GvrPostRender.cs#L91 \n(e.g. If you destroy and recreate the RenderTexture, does the memory get released?) \n@smdol Thanks for the clarification! I knew it was a Unity issue, but the RenderTexture was just a suspicion, so good to know that seems to be the specific culprit.\n. I'm not sure if Unity decided this was a great way to go or Google, or both. Either way, its a non-starter.. @dustinkerstein I've been holding off on a release because of this issue, and thankfully (hopefully) this was fixed in 2017.1.1p1 (https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/patch-releases)\n\n\n(940917) - iOS : Cardboard Enable Transition View fix added.\n\n\nWhich has a bug number that, confusingly, doesn't align with the other reported bug here: https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-cardboard-splash-screen-appears-even-if-enable-transition-view-is-set-to-false \nNo idea whose bug it was, ultimately. Could have been fixed by Google b/c the patch notes also say: \n\n\nXR : Updated Google VR NDK to 1.80.\n\n\nI'll add a comment here later to confirm fixed status.\n. > For me, a session viewer profile would be fine, as long as the gvr_get_viewer_vendor and gvr_get_viewer_model calls are surfaced for the Unity SDK or some other call so that we can test if the viewer is/isn't a cardboard default. \n@jdduke tedtheodore's proposal above would be great. A lot of our users just take the cardboard viewers we give them and expect them to work with our cross-platform Unity app.  The idea that they might need to configure their phone to make VR look correct with the viewer is something that never occurs to them.  \nWe don't need or even want to influence how other apps are configured, just so long as the \"session viewer profile\" can be reliably queried and set prior to enabling VR in Unity. Our ideal scenario would be this: \n\nReliably query the configured viewer profile prior to enabling VR.\nWarn user if they don't have our specific VR viewer configured (because 9.99/10 that's what they have) before entering VR and allow them to optionally press a single button to use our VR viewer config (not scan a QR code) \nReliably apply a custom viewer configuration profile prior to enabling VR.\nUltimately allow a user to view VR with whatever they want configured.\n\nIt may also be worth noting that ours is a \"hybrid app\" where we do a lot of enabling/disabling VR during an app use session, so ideally whatever changes to this API you make, they play nice with the hybrid scenario.\nI understand Daydream tries to solve this problem with the auto-configuring, but we're a cross-platform solution.  With that in mind, the more consistent the APIs & behavior between Android and iOS in the Unity SDK, the better.. \ud83d\udc4d This needs a proper fix.  These workarounds are prone to breakage between each GVR SDK update, don't solve the temporary override viewer problem on Android, and cycling VR on/off for Android is a bad user experience (screen flicker). .

When VR Mode is disabled the UI displays as expected. The canvas was also set to world space.\n. This can be avoided in the editor by changing Graphics Emulation to none, but this is no help on the device.\n. I have tried all combinations possible on Android with no luck. I have not retargeted iOS for a metal test.\n. I will try 5.3.3 when I can. Basically what's happening is the camera displays what appears to be near clipping much farther than it really is. The near is set as close as possible (.3-10). What you can see through the distance is a rather significant distance away. This has become a sudden issue, and reverting back to a previous cardboard version isn't possible since my workaround for blurry text on ui is most easily fixed with v0.8.\nI can give more images to elaborate if necessary\n. When it was set to None I noticed the issue translate over to VRMode enabled as well. I will try on 5.3.3 to be sure, but in the two versions I tested I had no luck. There was a noticeable difference between 5.3.4 and the most recent patch, but I did not go earlier than 5.3.4.\n. Unfortunately this wasn't the case. It's still happening with 5.3.3f1 (I was using a version of 5.3.4 that was noted to still be working).\nI reinstalled 5.3.3f1 and attempted all distortion correction modes with no luck.\nThe VR mode still works as expected, but VR disabled is a complete mess.\nAnd actually, the worldspace UI still displays in front of the camera as expected, which makes this even more confusing. The 3D environment all over does not display (with the exception of 1-2 objects) between the camera and the far depth. What I am able to see is the UI close up, one 3D object about the same distance as the UI, and very far 3D objects. There is quite a large chunk missing in view.\n.

I encountered the same issue and wanted to report it here. It will work in the editor's player, but not on the phone itself. I have only tried iOS since I don't have an Android phone. This was with Unity 5.3.6 since previous versions didn't render the canvas at all.\n\n\nI built a sample to demonstrate: https://github.com/ashleydb/Simple-GoogleVR-Canvas\nI'm not sure if this is a Unity or GoogleVR issue so I have reported it to Unity and will include the link here if I get one.\nMy workaround for now, since my UI is stationary in the scene at runtime, is to move the canvas to the root of the object hierarchy so that there isn't a parent with an event trigger component on it, but I can see how that wouldn't work if you wanted the canvas to move along with the object it was parented to.\n. I'm not. There is a 3d object in the world you can click, which is what has\nthe event trigger and is a parent of the canvas.\nOn Tuesday, 9 August 2016, papabew notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nWhy are you putting even trigger on Canvas?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/issues/265#issuecomment-238516011,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ALafyVVdKWfxJ1b7IniO34E5SNEQQiQxks5qeFgDgaJpZM4JMDHb\n.\n\n\nAshley Bennett\nwww.HiAsh.com\n.

They actually publish the source for all of the uGUI stuff\nhere:\nhttps://bitbucket.org/Unity-Technologies/ui/src/2ab730c794ce?at=5.3\nWhat I think may be happening is that when the event processing code looks\nfor the gameobject that will handle a \"pointer down\" event, it is finding\nthe EventTrigger rather than the Button. That's because Button only\nresponds to \"click\", but EventTrigger is happy to respond to \"pointer\ndown\", \"pointer up\" or \"click\".\nThere is logic in GazeInputModule to look for a pointer-down handler and\nthen fall back to looking for a click handler if the first search yielded\nnull. This was modeled on the exact same logic in their TouchInputModule,\nwhich was probably the way they intended to make buttons work with the\ndown/up event model.\nThe problem is that since EventTrigger says it handles pointer-down, it\nprevents the fallback search for a click handler. So EventTrigger masking\nthe Buttons under it in the hierarchy could just be a limitation in Unity's\nlogic. I don't see a way for making EventTrigger say \"yes, I respond to\npointer down\" only when you have actually added a callback -- the current\nbehavior is baked into the .NET inheritance and reflection mechanism they\nare using.\nI'm guessing they intended EventTrigger to be a catchall for event\nhandling -- it does everything, or don't use it. But there could be a way\nto make this work. All uGUI event callbacks receive a data blob that says\nwhich actual game object got the event, so in the click callback you\nregister on the EventTrigger, you could forward the click back to the\noriginal object if it also responds to a Click. (I.e. if it can be cast to\nIPointerClickHandler.) That would get around the fact that the object was\nmissed due to the handler search logic.\n(As for why it works in the editor but not on the phone, that's still a\nmystery. The additional complication is that on your computer,\nInput.GetMouseButtonDown() is real, but on the phone it is synthesized from\na screen touch.)\nNot ruling out a bug in GazeInputModule that actually makes this happen,\ndespite all the machinery I described above, but this is what I've got as\nof now.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/issues/265#issuecomment-238732848,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ALafycOzx-bZvrcOp82leWENvga3RPQwks5qeRqogaJpZM4JMDHb\n.\n.

There were some\nregressions in the way rendering to texture worked, around 5.3.4 I believe,\nthat GVR relies upon, (it even stopped world space canvases from rendering\nat all,) that were fixed in 5.3.6 but introduced these leaks which persist\nin 5.4. Unity are aware but no ETA of a fix AFAIK.

Starting with 5.3.4p2, a bug in Unity prevents rendering World Space uGUI Canvases into a RenderTexture.

Correct. In the recent 0.9 GVR update, support for the magnetic 'pull' buton has been removed:\nhttps://youtu.be/o_ciUnQQINs\n. GVR 0.85 is the latest release that still supports the magnetic cardboard button. The 'push' style 2015 cardboard buttons still work normally. \n.

Thanks for checking my videos guys. Is the Camera a child of another transform? You cannot move the camera directly. \"you cannot move the camera directly in Unity. Instead, the camera must be a child of another GameObject, and changes to the position and rotation must be applied to the parent\u2019s Transform.\"\nhttps://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/virtual-reality/movement-vr. In order to see that, you need Unity 5.6 (buggy) or Daydream Technical Preview (also buggy):\nhttps://unity3d.com/partners/google/daydream\nI recommend using Unity 5.4 or 5.5 with GVR 1.03, you will not see cardboard as a build target for VR.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saPTSdvacLE. Correct, covered at 24m: https://youtu.be/saPTSdvacLE?t=24m14s\nFor a GearVR build, you enable Virtual Reality Supported (oculus) and for GoogleVR (cardboard) you disable Virtual Reality supported.  More details about the differences between GearVR/cardboard can be found here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLCj6_gtLc4\nAnd we keep that project officially updated here:\nhttps://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/67019. Now, you would set the UI objects as a child of Main Camera. If you want to do this at runtime, myCanvas.transform.SetParent(Camera.Main.transform, true); would also work.\nCreate a worldspace ui as seen in this video: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0CAZYvrzGM\nIt would be better to set the position in the unity editor (not in script) by moving the transform in the Scene window and viewing what it looks like in the Game window. \n(You can do this at runtime, but you must \"copy component\" before you stop playing and then \"paste component values\" once play mode has stopped.)\nBecause you want the UI in front of the camera, it's position as a child of the camera will be somewhere around (0,0,1).\nSo this is very easy. Make UI as seen in video. Put Canvas as child of Main Camera. Position in Editor Window, view correct position in Game window. Now press play and UI is ready.. Original poster is developing for GoogleVR not Daydream. Supported phones link irrelevant.  I've also seen unexplainable performance drops when using Gvr.

And I had to remove some kind of gvrAudio thing which caused unity on mac to not compile. (can't remember which one, because I removed it :P ). Also, when you use the GyroController  https://developers.google.com/vr/develop/unity/guides/magic-window  GetHeadRotation doesn't work properly because the GyroController just changes the camera's rotation.. so you'll manually have to workaround that again.\nIt would be cool if you could actually SetHeadRotation  for situations like this.\n. cool thanks i'll check that out. Works very nicely thanks. I tried a different gyro camera once before but that was way off.. this works just like it should :). hmm   for some reason the gyro camera is jerking around randomly....  fun stuff.. @fredsa This issue has nothing to do with the viewer being used. if that were the case, the image would be incorrect all the time.  since this sometimes works and sometimes doesnt. and can usually (not always,which is also weird) be fixed by changing the resolution of the phone, this is something different completely.\nplease don't just skimread user reports and close issues without getting a reply.\nthis issue is definitely NOT closed.\n. I've got 3 Galaxy S7's all with google vr services v 1.18.213676531\ndouble checked the vr viewer profiles, the problem is there on google cardboard, google cardboard 2015 and our Owl glasses.\non one phone everything worked like it should.  the other showed the wrong view again.\nI took new screenshots, one with the cardboard profile and one with the cardboard owl profile.\n\n\nthe 3rd phone was set to HD 1280x720  and showed a similar view but this time zoomed in more (although the borders at the left, top and right show that part of the app knows the actual screen size) \n\nswitching back to WQHD 2560x1440 made it look like this:\n\n\nhaven't seen that one before :)\nafter a restart the screen was normal on that device again.\nit's hard to test because the problem doesn't always appear.  and it can sometimes (lately it's harder to fix than a couple of months) by switching between HD and WQHD and rebooting a couple of times.\nI've managed to log some data with a correct and incorrect view:\nI've logged the  Screen.dpi, Screen.width and  Screen.height,\nboth times the device was set to: WQHD 2560x1440\ncorrect view:\nDPI: 640   width 2560  height 1440\nincorrect view:\nDPI: 480   width 1920 height 1080\n. Ok, i've found a way to sorta reproduce it, although the problem doesn't normally occur like this because I never change resolution unless the VR-game bugs out first.\nThe screen also looks different now.  If you look at the the position of the reticles compared to my screenshots before,  they used to look like they were scaled from the bottom centre.\nThis time they look like theyre both scaled from the bottom left.\nstr:\n- change resolution to WQHD\n- run vr game\n- put app in background (don't quit it) \n- change resolution to HD\n- return to app.\nScreen looks like this:\n\noutput of the commands you requested:\nDevice: demo1\nC:\\Projects\\startrekenen-vr\\StartRekenenVR>adb shell pm dump com.google.vr.vrcore   | findstr -i \"versionName packages:\"\n  Packages:\n      versionName=1.18.213676531\n\nadb shell getprop ro.build.fingerprint\nsamsung/heroltexx/herolte:7.0/NRD90M/G930FXXU1DQL4:user/release-keys\nadb shell wm size\nPhysical size: 1440x2560\nOverride size: 1080x1920\nadb shell wm density\nPhysical density: 640\nOverride density: 480\nadb shell dumpsys display   | findstr /i \"mBaseDisplayInfo\"\n    mBaseDisplayInfo=DisplayInfo{\"Built-in Screen\", uniqueId \"local:0\", app 1440 x 2560, real 1440 x 2560, largest app 1440 x 2560, smallest app 1440 x 2560, mode 1, defaultMode 1, modes [{id=1, width=1440, height=2560, fps=59.0}], colorTransformId 1, defaultColorTransformId 1, supportedColorTransforms [{id=1, colorTransform=-22}], hdrCapabilities android.view.Display$HdrCapabilities@6be5966, rotation 0, density 640 (580.571 x 575.433) dpi, layerStack 0, appVsyncOff 0, presDeadline 17949152, type BUILT_IN, state ON, FLAG_SECURE, FLAG_SUPPORTS_PROTECTED_BUFFERS}\n    mBaseDisplayInfo=DisplayInfo{\"ActivityViewVirtualDisplay\", uniqueId \"virtual:android,1000,ActivityViewVirtualDisplay,7\", app 1080 x 1920, real 1080 x 1920, largest app 1080 x 1920, smallest app 1080 x 1920, mode 9, defaultMode 9, modes [{id=9, width=1080, height=1920, fps=60.0}], colorTransformId 0, defaultColorTransformId 0, supportedColorTransforms [], hdrCapabilities null, rotation 0, density 480 (480.0 x 480.0) dpi, layerStack 0, appVsyncOff 0, presDeadline 16666666, type VIRTUAL, state ON, owner android (uid 1000), FLAG_VIRTUAL_SCREEN}\n\nif you do it the other way around, the screen looks like this:\n\noutput of the commands you requested:\nDevice: demo1\n\nadb shell pm dump com.google.vr.vrcore   | findstr -i \"versionName packages:\"\n  Packages:\n      versionName=1.18.213676531\nadb shell getprop ro.build.fingerprint\nsamsung/heroltexx/herolte:7.0/NRD90M/G930FXXU1DQL4:user/release-keys\nadb shell wm size\nPhysical size: 1440x2560\nadb shell wm density\nPhysical density: 640\nadb shell dumpsys display   | findstr /i \"mBaseDisplayInfo\"\n    mBaseDisplayInfo=DisplayInfo{\"Built-in Screen\", uniqueId \"local:0\", app 1440 x 2560, real 1440 x 2560, largest app 1440 x 2560, smallest app 1440 x 2560, mode 1, defaultMode 1, modes [{id=1, width=1440, height=2560, fps=59.0}], colorTransformId 1, defaultColorTransformId 1, supportedColorTransforms [{id=1, colorTransform=-22}], hdrCapabilities android.view.Display$HdrCapabilities@6be5966, rotation 0, density 640 (580.571 x 575.433) dpi, layerStack 0, appVsyncOff 0, presDeadline 17949152, type BUILT_IN, state ON, FLAG_SECURE, FLAG_SUPPORTS_PROTECTED_BUFFERS}\n    mBaseDisplayInfo=DisplayInfo{\"ActivityViewVirtualDisplay\", uniqueId \"virtual:android,1000,ActivityViewVirtualDisplay,4\", app 1440 x 2560, real 1440 x 2560, largest app 1440 x 2560, smallest app 1440 x 2560, mode 6, defaultMode 6, modes [{id=6, width=1440, height=2560, fps=60.0}], colorTransformId 0, defaultColorTransformId 0, supportedColorTransforms [], hdrCapabilities null, rotation 0, density 640 (640.0 x 640.0) dpi, layerStack 0, appVsyncOff 0, presDeadline 16666666, type VIRTUAL, state ON, owner android (uid 1000), FLAG_VIRTUAL_SCREEN}\n\nso its similar to the original problem,  but not 100% :)\n. reproduced with your app.\nstr:\nset screen resolution to wqhd\n\nrun app\npress home\nset screen resolution to HD or FHD\nreturn to app\n\n\n\nSo it's not my setup that's the problem :) and apparently also not a windows or mac issue.\nBut do note that this is not exactly the bug that occasionally appears and takes several reboots/res. switches to disappear.

It was due to the way both Vuforia and Cardboard override the AppController. If you manually merge them together then it works correctly (Unity 5.3).\n. Any update on this? Is there a work-around to load a different profile with Unity3d + GoogleVR SDK?. Hi @nikhilcheruku12 to comment on your FBX question: The difference is when you load from a resources folder Unity Editor has already imported the FBX file and converted it into a format it knows how to load (you get to change the default import settings in the inspector for model, rig and animations). But when it gets a FBX at runtime (you download it bypassing the Unity Editor) it has no ability to read a FBX file.\nAn asset bundle is a way you can export a model from the Unity Editor and then it has everything set for Unity runtime to load (eg: download the bundle from the internet). So every asset you want to load that way you will need to first process in the Unity Editor. Secondly there are some gotchas with asset bundles - the biggest being Unity doesn't guarantee compatability between minor versions of Unity and only forward compatability. So you can't say export a Asset Bundle with Unity 5.6 and load it into a runtime built from 5.3.  \nFurther asset bundles are platform specific, so you need to export them for ios, android, windows, etc. \nYou can look at loading other (simpler formats) such as OBJ, DAE at runtime.\nAs @vinhui said, this topic is not related to GoogleVR and a good forum discussion.. OK, found the issue: GvrSettings and GvrCardboardHelpers on ios should use [DllImport(\"__Internal\")] not [DllImport(\"gvr\")] \nI have created a pull request with the fix:\nPull Request #622 \nSome interesting factors that took me a while to figure this out:\n\nIf you are using Unity VR profile \"None\" then calls like GvrCardboardHelpers.SetViewerProfile() will crash the app because the the VR native ptr VRDevice.GetNativePtr() (passed internally with calls such as gvr_set_default_viewer_profile) will be null for \"None\" profile. So don't call these cardboard specific methods when not in \"cardboard\" profile. \n\nMaybe an additional fix for safety is to check the current VR profile is \"cardboard\" before allowing these calls to proceed.\n\nYou must call GvrCardboardHelpers.SetViewerProfile()  in the Awake() method as Start() is too late. If you put it in Start, then you will still get the select profile dialog (unless the user has previous set it)..

Update: One downside of this fix is that appears to break on Unity Cloud builds. The linker can't resolve the references. It works fine on local builds.. How are you switching between cardboard and 360 ? \n\nI am doing this and not seeing a crash.. Here's how I switch in and out of VR mode:\nhttp://talesfromtherift.com/googlevr-cardboard-switch-between-normal-mode-and-vr-mode-at-run-time/\n. For anyone else, I found a work-around using 2 cameras:\n\nAdd a duplicate Main Camera. On one set it to VR mode \"none - main window\".\nOn second Camera set VR mode to \"both\" and set its depth to -2 (behind the other camera).\n\nThen any cardboard distortions on the VR camera won't effect the non-vr camera.\n. Thanks. I can confirm it is the same problem and that Camera.main.ResetAspect (); does fix it.\nBUT, that work-around on IOS leave a frame where the distortion is visible and then it is fixed - which is very ugly and makes the app look buggy.\nI ended up using this solution (over the 2 camera approach) because it made my logic for camera management easier. \nHowever, to avoid the 1 frame of distortion, I use a black overlay to fade out the screen, then switch out of cardboard, then fade it back in thus hiding the frame.\nThanks for your response. . Apologies for the non-answer -but why not use the X button to exit back to 2d mode?. Oh my gosh, I've been pulling my hair out for days on this. It's so random, for me every couple of runs after loading the 5th or 6th image I saw the crash above. I have been googling like crazy and never found this page until now. \nGoogle search is you are reading this then: unity_z_inflate EXC_BAD_ACCESS LoadImageIntoTexture LoadImage \n. Thank you @rusmaxham !!\nI confirm your work-around does resolve the problem. \nWithout your patch I will crash consistently in one or two screen of my app (Unity 2017.1.3p1, XCode Version 9.2 (9C40b), iPad iOS 11.2).

Hi, thanks for the reply! :)\nI fiddled a few hours with this yesterday, turns out it does differ from the cardboard and how the \"emulation\" in unity works. Which I found was quite confusing..\nFor future reference if anyone finds this thread, the solution for Daydream was to make 2 cameras(one left, one right), put them inside the GvrViewer and set the \"Target Eye\" for each one to Left/Right. And then set up the Culling Mask for each camera.\nBut you won\u00b4t see it working correctly inside Unity(using the emulation), but you will see it working on the Phone/Daydream.. ",
    "ibrews": "AHHH I'm so glad I found this. @oosmoxiecode , thanks so much for your explanation-- I've been struggling with how to do this on daydream for a while now. Finally it's working!\nAnd just to further clarify, for anyone who is now finding this and trying to do the same thing, these are the steps: (mind you I'm using Unity 5.4.2 GVR-13 so maybe it's different in 5.6):\n0) Have a scene with standard non-camera stuff for Daydream already setup (like GvrViewerMain and GvrControllerMain and whatnot)\n1) Create an empty game object and attach the Gvr Head component to it.\n2) Uncheck Track Rotation and Track Position\n3) Inside that game object, create two basic unity cameras (put them both at 0,0,0 inside the parent)\n4) Treat one camera as the left eye and one as the right eye. In the camera Target Eye settings, choose Left for one and Right for the other. \n5) Then uncheck whatever layers in the Culling Masks that each eye shouldn't see.\nTa-da! Yes indeed it does not look right in Unity but it does in Daydream!!. @eyalfx - instead of dong FindObjectsOfType, try building an array with GetComponentsInChildren< Camera >(). Maybe you're misunderstanding the solution being discussed in this thread. You need to add the left and right camera manually within Unity-- if you want this to work you can't let google do it's automatic camera adding to the main camera like it normally would. . gotcha. no I haven't tried this on 5.6 yet..

Thanks ibrews. I tried that first and there were no cameras to be found under the main camera. Which is why I tried FindObjectsOfType to see if there are any other cameras in the scene (anywhere)... but there are none.   really strange how there are no other cameras for stereo rendering..

    "cjsauer": "For people trying to play 360 stereoscopic video in Cardboard, I got this working in Unity 5.6 over at issue #511 . So I didn't quite solve my issue, but I did successfully get a 360 stereo video playing in Cardboard. For future people trying to do this I'll explain it roughly. It is not necessary to use two spheres to accomplish 360 stereo video playback! You can use only one with a bit of shader magic. \nFirst of all, I'm using Easy Movie Texture in order to render .mp4 files to texture on Android. This package is referenced often and seems to be the most recommended solution for accomplishing this on Android. \nFrom there, drag out a sphere, but do NOT use the Unity standard sphere. The UVs on it are not appropriate for equirectangular videos which causes distortion near the poles. Instead, use the pSphere09 mesh that comes with Easy Movie Texture. Or alternatively, you could model up your own in Blender and use that.\nNow the key ingredient: there is a shader bundled with the GVR Unity SDK called VideoDemoInsideShader. This is what you want to attach to your sphere's material. To make this work you have to make some edits to the shader code itself, because currently this shader is flipping normals and UVs manually. We don't need this. We already flipped and mapped the UVs correctly in Blender (or are using a sphere that has, like pSphere09). Comment out the following lines in the shader:\n```C#\n// cull the outside, since we want to draw on the inside of the mesh.\n// Cull Front      <--- Comment this out!\n// ...\nv2f vert (appdata_base v) {\n    v2f o;\n    // invert the normal of the vertex\n    // v.normal.xyz = v.normal * -1;                    <---- Comment this out!\n    o.pos = GvrUnityObjectToClipPos(v.vertex);\n    o.uv = TRANSFORM_TEX (v.texcoord, _MainTex);\n    if (_StereoVideo > 0) {\n        o.uv.y *= 0.5f;\n        if(unity_StereoEyeIndex == 0) {\n            o.uv.y += 0.5f;\n        }\n    }\n    // o.uv.x = 1 - o.uv.x;                   <---- Comment this out!\n    return o;\n}\n```\nNow when you set up the Media Player Control component to point to the sphere as its target (this is Easy Movie Texture specific again), it should be properly splitting the video to each eye using a shader. No need to use two spheres and culling masks!\nNote that this is for top-bottom oriented videos. Side by side (SBS) videos could be handled the same way with a bit of adjustment to the shader code..

Interesting, updating to Unity beta 5.6.0b9 solves the issue, at least for the Demo Scene.. Thanks @miraleung. In that case, iOS is not supported at all, as this issue was experienced with the bare-bone demo scene, and the documentation should be updated, as it currently states \"The Google VR SDK for Unity requires Unity 5.2.1 or later\" (https://developers.google.com/vr/unity/get-started-ios).\nThanks. Migrating from 1.1 to 1.5. The project no longer compiles because scripts use GvrViewer for various use cases:\n- toggle on / off of VR mode: GvrViewer.Instance.VRModeEnabled = false;\n- trigger an event when the Cardboard button is clicked: GvrViewer.Instance.Triggered\n- trigger an event when the smartphone device is tilted: GvrViewer.Instance.Tilted\nThe blocking error in these 3 cases is: \n\nThe name `GvrViewer' does not exist in the current context\n\nIt is frustrating that the documentation does not provide clear instructions on how to replace features leveraging GvrViewer. The only place I could find relevant info, is here in the repo's issues (which are not surfaced by Google search). Those are basic events, and it is annoying to spend time to merely maintain a project, and not improve it.\nThanks for listening to us though..

Hey! The first issue is solved by upgrading to 5.6.1p2 https://unity3d.com/fr/unity/qa/patch-releases/5.6.1p2.

Thank you @joejo-unity :). @antoniohof thanks for the workaround though, I am going to experiment with that now. What's s the sweet spot in terms of delay during the change?. Confirming that @antoniohof's workaround to set ScreenOrientation to Portrait solves the distortion issue, but I'd rather not use it since the non-VR mode is meant to be in Landscape thus it creates some other UI issues.

    "youlweb": "+100% on getting back the ability to toggle the vertical bar+gear icon. \nIn the app I'm building, I chose to display these options on the home screen only, then hide them during gameplay, which prevents annoying reflections in the lenses.\nThe risk that the toggling feature is even noticed by cardboard developers is minimal, considering the horrendous quality of most cardboard apps. They are less than optimized, to say the least.\nHowever, for the few mindful and/or corporate developers out there, this option adds a much needed uptick in overall user experience quality, which is much needed in this fragile ecosystem.\n. Hi Nathan, I'm using the Blitzwolf viewer. The lenses are surprisingly good, and will catch reflections whenever the app background is dark/black.\nI must add that by far the most disrupting part of the UI is the back arrow in the top left corner, because it is drawn on useful screen estate, unlike the divider/gear sprites, that may be partly hidden by the viewer's eye divider (although it may cause reflections). Additionally, the back arrow is rendered on the left eye screen only, causing an unpleasant non-3D perception of that part of the scene.\nI'm glad that various solutions are being explored to improve the user experience with GVR/Cardboard, an otherwise affordable and exciting VR landscape, which could gain mass adoption with the right level of quality built in its applications/games. I have reached 60+ FPS on a Galaxy S4 in the game I'm building, with engaging graphics, which now delivers a similar feeling as some of the more expensive experiences such as PSVR, on hardware that's already in the pocket of most consumers.\nThank you for your quick response, and encouraging words.\n.

    "dgoodine": "Is there going to be any update on this?\n. First, post WWDC 2015, having unused architectures doesn't increase the downloaded binary side \u2013 those get stripped out on Apple's side when the app is prepared for distribution.  So your users that have problems with the size being an issue are ill-informed.  There was an issue where apps were getting rejected last year for having those slices in place (it false-triggered use of a non-public API), and, as is typical of Apple, there's been no confirmation that has been fixed.\nThe only other option would be to supply two binaries, one with he ARM architectures, and another with the Intel architectures.  That would be fine, as it's easy to combine them into the fat binary that people tend to typically use.  (We're using 18 third party frameworks/libraries in our app, and yours is the only one that doesn't include the Intel slices, or alternative .a files.)\nWhen I dowloaded and checked out the native iOS Cardboard library, it did indeed include the Intel architectures. It shouldn't be too hard to implement either choice in your build process.  As more and more Unity experiences move to a native iOS app container, this is going to be more and more important.  Developing while needing to be tethered to a device is a very significant drag on productivity compared to working in the simulator.\n. Ah, I see.  Yeah, if that's a significant burden on some users, you could conceivably make two versions of each release, one for the device, one for the simulator.  Or you could just open-source Cardboard and we could do the build. ;)\n. @rusmaxham It isn't fixed as of 1.110.0. If you look at the file that is being output when Unity generates the Xcode project and sources, you'll see that it's a Java object file.. This is still broken in 2018.1.. I can't send the project, but I determined the problem is because of the old audio stuff in the Legacy folders.  Those classes contained the references to those symbols.\nfind . -name 'GvrAudio'\n.

    "GabeWeiss": "As suggested, downgrading to 5.3.3 stops the leak entirely. We don't see any memory increase.\nAs an added note, this is not a \"leak\" in the traditional sense. If it were, we would have caught it long before. The memory is seemingly being allocated and held, rather than leaking. This is also why things like trying to force garbage collection in Unity doesn't have an effect on it either.\nDo we have a link to the Unity filed bug we can reference here as well to keep all the information in one place?\n. There is! It's here:\nhttps://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/googlevr-canvas-are-allocating-memory-and-do-not-release-it-when-using-vr-cameras\n. I'm having the same issues (SDK version 8.5).

I've let the Android build of the demo run for a few hours and the native heap has climbed all the way up to 450 megs and still rising. Thanks for the tip about downgrading to 5.3.3. I'll give that a try.\n. I downgraded to 5.3.3 and the leaks are gone. Does anyone know if there is an active Unity bug to track this issue? We use a decent number of canvas objects in our VR scenes so these leaks are killing us. Thanks.\n. I can confirm that the combination of Unity 2017.1.2p1 and VR Services 1.10.172754103 is successful. What's the best way to detect if a user doesn't have the latest VR Services installed though? . I ended up using the PackageManager to get the PackageInfo for com.google.vr.vrcore. Then I checked the versionCode to make sure it was at least 160729830 (aka 1.10.172754103). If there's a better way then please let me know. Thanks.. Awesome. That works. Thanks!. Any chance you could push this fix into the Unity Long Term Support stream? Thanks.\nhttps://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases. https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/patch-releases/2017.3.1p2. +1. I'm the OP from issue #490 and we have a very similar use case as @tedtheodore. His proposed solution would work for us as well. Thanks.. Have you tried messing with Application.targetFrameRate and possibly also QualitySettings.vSyncCount? We found, at least on iPhone, that the newer versions of Unity and/or GVR SDK were setting the target frame rate to 30. I'm not sure about Android though.. We mitigate this with the following after entering VR:\n// Since Unity 2017 (?) the iPhone defaults to 30 fps which is too slow.\n// Explicitly request 60 fps. Also set the vertical sync count to zero so it doesn't interfere.\nApplication.targetFrameRate = 60;\nQualitySettings.vSyncCount = 0;\nThen, after leaving VR we do this:\n// restore the default frame rate\nApplication.targetFrameRate = -1;. I'm pretty sure I debugged this once and the cause seemed to be GVR using a 565 texture for lens distortion. Those bands look very much like what you get with color gradients on 565 frame buffers.. > there isn't all that much benefit to having a stereo preview view in the editor.\nCount me among the devs who really liked having the lens distortion available in the editor. We have some effects that we place around the edge of the view and it was really helpful to see that we were getting the placement of those effects correct relative to the distorted field of view without requiring a round-trip to a real device. That said, we are surviving without it and we normally use the Mock HMD device in the Unity Editor although it's a poor approximation. There were definitely some sad faces on our team when the in-editor lens distortion went away.. I agree, not quite fixed yet. I was able to make it work but only with some workarounds. My observations:\n\nYou still need to be in VR to call it. It would be much more useful if you could call it before entering VR.\nWe have to call gvr_set_default_viewer_profile ourselves instead of using the GvrCardboardHelpers.SetViewerProfile wrapper because it eats the bool return value which we need for step 3.\nIf gvr_set_default_viewer_profile succeeds (returning true), you need to call gvr_refresh_viewer_profile AND leave and reenter VR before the new default will take effect.\nAlso, the iPhone always seems to need a gvr_refresh_viewer_profile call or it uses the wrong one.. Like this:\n```\n\nif (UNITY_ANDROID || UNITY_IOS) && !UNITY_EDITOR\n    [DllImport(GvrActivityHelper.GVR_DLL_NAME)]\n    private static extern bool gvr_set_default_viewer_profile(IntPtr gvr_context,\n        [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.LPStr)] string viewer_profile_uri);\n\n    [DllImport(GvrActivityHelper.GVR_DLL_NAME)]\n    private static extern void gvr_refresh_viewer_profile(IntPtr gvr_context);\n\nendif\npublic static IEnumerator SetDefaultViewerProfile(string viewerProfileUri)\n{\n    if (XRSettings.enabled)\n    {\nif (UNITY_ANDROID || UNITY_IOS) && !UNITY_EDITOR\n    // GvrCardboardHelpers.SetViewProfile does not expose the return type so we\n    // call gvr_set_default_viewer_profile ourselves.\n\n    IntPtr gvrContextPtr = GvrSettings.GetValidGvrNativePtrOrLogError();\n    if (gvrContextPtr == IntPtr.Zero)\n    {\n        Utils.LogError(\"Cannot set default viewer profile!

With an app store submission in 10 days, we're short on time to figure out an acceptable workaround.\nOne option: Toggle between VR and non-VR mode in a single frame. Right now we black out the frame and it's a horrible user experience since we have to do it every 10 seconds. We're exploring capturing a screenshot and using that as a texture for the frame.\nAny other suggestions?\n. We've got a depressing workaround:\nPeriodically delete and re-add all canvases in a scene. Obviously this is risky and all references to Canvas elements are lost (fortunately we don't store references to Canvases in our app).

During the experiment I was just moving the camera around.\n\n. ",
    "mswf": "@sapanda I actually derived a better workaround, from a tucked away forum post from a Unity developer.\nhttp://forum.unity3d.com/threads/cant-view-canvas-in-daydream-vr.421401/\n\nThis issue is fixed and will be released in patches for both 5.4 and 5.3, however if you are using the cardboard plugin you can work around the memory leak for now.\nIn stereoController.cs OnPreCull comment out cam.enabled = false. The issue is that if the camera is not active at the end of the frame its resources wont be freed. This problem will be resolved in Unity going forward.\n\nThis workaround causes the main camera to still render the entire scene. ~~I found a slightly \"better\" workaround. In addition to commenting out 'cam.enabled = false', I added the following code there:~~\n// EDIT: No don't do this, look below for a better workaround\ncam.clearFlags = CameraClearFlags.SolidColor;\ncam.backgroundColor = Color.black;\ncam.cullingMask = 0;\nI also tried changing the viewport rect to be zero width and height, but this messes up the input events.\nNow here's to hoping the real fix will be released sooner rather than later.\nI also don't have access to my Unity account right now. Could somebody please be so kind to forward this workaround to the Unity bug thread?  \nEDIT:\nOkay so this does have side-effects after all. After the application loses focus the workaround settings applied to the main camera are applied to the individual eye cameras, making everything black. I will report back when I find where to properly prevent this from happening.\nEDIT2:\nI created a more satisfying workaround:\nAdded #define CARDBOARD_HACK at the top of the StereoController.cs\nIn void OnPreCull () changed cam.enabled to  \n```\nif CARDBOARD_HACK\nwarning Due to a Unity bug, a worldspace canvas in a camera that renders to a RenderTexture allocates infinite memory. Uncomment this line when fixed.\n        BlackOutMonoCamera();\n\nelse\n        cam.enabled = false;\n\nendif\n```\nIn IEnumerator EndOfFrame (), changed cam.enabled to  \n```\nif CARDBOARD_HACK\n            RestoreMonoCamera();\n\nelse\n            cam.enabled = true;\n\nendif\n```\nAnd finally added the following methods to the buttom of the file:\n```\nif CARDBOARD_HACK\nprivate CameraClearFlags m_MonoCameraClearFlags;\nprivate Color m_MonoCameraBackgroundColor;\nprivate int m_MonoCameraCullingMask;\n\nprivate void BlackOutMonoCamera ()\n{\n    m_MonoCameraClearFlags = cam.clearFlags;\n    m_MonoCameraBackgroundColor = cam.backgroundColor;\n    m_MonoCameraCullingMask = cam.cullingMask;\n\n    cam.clearFlags = CameraClearFlags.SolidColor;\n    cam.backgroundColor = Color.black;\n    cam.cullingMask = 0;\n}\n\nprivate void RestoreMonoCamera ()\n{\n    cam.clearFlags = m_MonoCameraClearFlags;\n    cam.backgroundColor = m_MonoCameraBackgroundColor;\n    cam.cullingMask = m_MonoCameraCullingMask;\n}\n\nendif\n```\nThis is of course still dirty as can be.

It remains that way until charging the device and then rebooting it, where I'd expect charging it would be enough and rebooting wouldn't be necessary. . Hey @fredsa  thanks! Unchecking that is definitely a better solution than deleting it thanks for that tip I forgot that was an option.  Yeah I'm pretty sure its the Oculus Utilities for Unity that was doing it. @chaosemer hey that did it!

Okay but about the other thing,why does the plugin run in compatibility mode even though I have unity 5.4\n. Hi Nathan,I updated to the latest Beta version of unity (5.5.0b6) and I still get that error\n\n. I'm using 5.5b10\n. I want the split screen, if I disable the component then it's gone.\n. I've already  tried that but to no avail, the main camera comes to the proper position, where I want it to in the scene but the 2 gvr cameras,  they always default to a fixed position, I'm unable to change their position via script. \n. Frank, I've added the main camera object as a child  to an empty game object and made the rest of the objects as the children of the main camera object. Now, during runtime, I can see that the parent object and the main camera object are at the right position but the camera objects created by GvrMain always default to a certain position..\n. The main camera is at relative origin to its parent object and I'm moving the parent object via script, in the scene view during runtime, I can see that the main camera object transform and the parent transform have moved to the appropriate position but the gvr cameras always appear at one fixed position(Now that I think of it, perhaps they are being created at the origin according to the world position and not relative to the camera, I'll have to confirm this at work. ) \n. In the hierarchy they appear to be the child objects of the main camera,but I think they're appearing according to the world position,I've even tried creating an empty game object and attaching  a script to it that will check and translate the transform of the GvrEye objects to the user decided position and set the parent transform as Main Camera as the the parent of these objects,yet to no avail.\nI've also tried the legacy prefabs still no success!!\n. I'm thinking of an alternative approach,in unity we have auto-tilt head up for emulation,can I make that happen in the app,does anybody have any clue\n. Anyone ?!?\n. @sixblades, I've yet to try the solution mentioned by @rawnsley, for I am busy with some other projects, but I think it should word, have you given it a shot?!?.. If not, then please try it out and let us know . lowering the scale to about (0.05) works but, once the reticle enters the activated or enlarged state,I again see 2 blurry reticles \n. nope,still back to square 1,the issue has returned\n.

Hopefully someone responds to this thread with a simple solution.. @jadware I compiled NDK example successfully just now and it still doesn't work.  I'm gonna have to put this on hold.   I think there's a critical step that's missing like paring the 6-dof controllers to the headset.   Hopefully someone updates us if they get it to work successfully.. I contacted google about this issue with a bug report yesterday.  They told me they found the issue and are working on a fix.  They also told me they'll update me as soon as a fix is rolled out.

I haven't tried this on Unity, but it works for a similar Android issue on the S8.. If you disable Google VR Services on the phone, does this issue still happen? GVR Services scans for Daydream controllers and that may be interfering with your app's scanning.\nIf you are trying to create a Cardboard app, you won't need GVR Services. You can also try on a non-Daydream Ready phone since that won't have GVR Services.\nIf you are trying to create a Daydream app, you could try scanning after the system has connected to the Daydream controller.. It's unclear what the issue is. When I try using Chrome's Web BT samples while in split-screen mode with a DD app, the DD app gets controller information and Chrome can find other BLE devices. One way to debug this may be to use the sdk-controllerclient sample which is a 2D app that uses the Daydream API to talk to a server.\nIf adding BLE scanning to that sample works and it can detect other BLE devices while it's paired with a controller, then the issue is with the Unity plugin. If the modified sample can't detect other BLE devices, then the issue is with DD blocking BLE scanning.. ",

Thanks for looking into this! I'm working on a multiplayer game where users need the keyboard to enter in a custom game name and chat with others via text, so having a working keyboard is pretty crucial for me.\nAlso, it appears that restarting my phone does not always fix the issue. I'm going to try experimenting with loading up the default Daydream app first, and whatever other things I can think of.\nSince restarting my phone seems to sometimes fix the issue, I'm wondering if maybe the native keyboard process is not getting cleaned up properly after closing an app that uses the DD keyboard? Atm, I'm manually killing Daydream apps by going to the Android app list and swiping right on the app.\nHere is an extended logcat when crashing at start due to the GvrKeyboard being enabled:\n08-29 13:57:31.631  7202  7223 D AudioTrack: Client defaulted notificationFrames to 192 for frameCount 384\n08-29 13:57:31.704  7202  7202 E art     : No implementation found for void com.google.vr.audio.DeviceInfo.nativeUpdateHeadphoneStateChange(long, int) (tried Java_com_google_vr_audio_DeviceInfo_nativeUpdateHeadphoneStateChange and Java_com_google_vr_audio_DeviceInfo_nativeUpdateHeadphoneStateChange__JI)\n08-29 13:57:31.706  7202  7202 D AndroidRuntime: Shutting down VM\n08-29 13:57:31.707  7202  7202 E AndroidRuntime: FATAL EXCEPTION: main\n08-29 13:57:31.707  7202  7202 E AndroidRuntime: Process: com.google.vr.unity.gvrdemo, PID: 7202\n08-29 13:57:31.707  7202  7202 E AndroidRuntime: java.lang.Error: FATAL EXCEPTION [main]\n08-29 13:57:31.707  7202  7202 E AndroidRuntime: Unity version     : 2017.1.0p3\n08-29 13:57:31.707  7202  7202 E AndroidRuntime: Device model      : Google Pixel\n08-29 13:57:31.707  7202  7202 E AndroidRuntime: Device fingerprint: google/sailfish/sailfish:7.1.2/NJH47F/4146041:user/release-keys\n08-29 13:57:31.707  7202  7202 E AndroidRuntime:\n08-29 13:57:31.707  7202  7202 E AndroidRuntime: Caused by: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: No implementation found for void com.google.vr.audio.DeviceInfo.nativeUpdateHeadphoneStateChange(long, int) (tried Java_com_google_vr_audio_DeviceInfo_nativeUpdateHeadphoneStateChange and Java_com_google_vr_audio_DeviceInfo_nativeUpdateHeadphoneStateChange__JI)\n08-29 13:57:31.707  7202  7202 E AndroidRuntime:    at com.google.vr.audio.DeviceInfo.nativeUpdateHeadphoneStateChange(Native Method)\n08-29 13:57:31.707  7202  7202 E AndroidRuntime:    at com.google.vr.audio.DeviceInfo.a(PG:36)\n08-29 13:57:31.707  7202  7202 E AndroidRuntime:    at ala.onReceive(PG:11)\n08-29 13:57:31.707  7202  7202 E AndroidRuntime:    at android.app.LoadedApk$ReceiverDispatcher$Args.run(LoadedApk.java:1122)\n08-29 13:57:31.707  7202  7202 E AndroidRuntime:    at android.os.Handler.handleCallback(Handler.java:751)\n08-29 13:57:31.707  7202  7202 E AndroidRuntime:    at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:95)\n08-29 13:57:31.707  7202  7202 E AndroidRuntime:    at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:154)\n08-29 13:57:31.707  7202  7202 E AndroidRuntime:    at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:6121)\n08-29 13:57:31.707  7202  7202 E AndroidRuntime:    at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Native Method)\n08-29 13:57:31.707  7202  7202 E AndroidRuntime:    at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(ZygoteInit.java:889)\n08-29 13:57:31.707  7202  7202 E AndroidRuntime:    at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:779)\n08-29 13:57:31.712  1114  2258 W ActivityManager:   Force finishing activity com.google.vr.unity.gvrdemo/com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerActivity\n08-29 13:57:31.717  7202  7202 I Process : Sending signal.

    "jdduke": "Hi @andrelevi , there are some instructions here that explain unlocking the \"Developer Options\" UI in Google VR Services, as well as how to enable the controller emulator device. Hope that helps.\n. Another thing to try is installing the latest version of Google VR Services. The GVR SDK used a set of DPI overrides for certain devices which misreport their DPI. However, such DPI overrides only work properly when the device is configured for native resolution. The latest version of Google VR Services might have a fix for this issue.. Just wanted to share an update. We've tested a tentative fix against several apps, and the results are promising. The fix would go out as part of a Google VR Services update at the end of the month. We'll post more when the rollout starts to get confirmation of the fix. Thanks for your patience.. The Google VR Services with the tentative fix should have the following version name: 1.10.170249286. Rollout will hit 25% today, and 100% be the end of the week.. No definitive ETA, but we're actively exploring several solutions together with Samsung. We'll keep this thread posted as we have more concrete details to share.. > Is there any ETA for the scaling fix? Thanks.\nThe plan is to push an updated Google VR Services build to resolve the second half of the problem (properly responding to \"density\" changes when declared in the manifest). We expect the rollout to hit 100% by the end of next week (Nov. 3).. The fix to allow \"density\" changes without an app restart (by way of the app manifest) has rolled out to 100%. Note that the resolution change will still occur if the user has not explicitly changed the resolution to native.\nSeparately, we're exploring rollout of a global prompt to change the resolution of the device to native, sometime in December. That will avoid the resolution switch entirely, though it may be suboptimal for some users who don't want their device always running at native resolution.. > Can I fix the crash at least with a manifest update like android:configChanges=\"density\" then?\nYou can try, though I don't believe the behavior will be consistent or correct unless you have the latest SDK and Unity version.. @sterlingcrispin: Did you observe a warning notification when you reached the thermal throttling threshold? If you exceeded the threshold, you should have been taken to a scene prompting you to remove the phone from the headset. This is not really a situation that apps can handle very gracefully, which is why we have the automatic behavior. what version of Google VR Services did you have on the device?\nThe device will remain thermally throttled as long as it remains in VR mode, but it should become unthrottled after leaving VR mode (provided the temps are now under the usual limits). If you're seeing otherwise, a bug report would be helpful. Thanks.. You can send the bug report directly to me if you like, and I'll triage internally. Thanks.. Per offline discussion, we weren't able to determine if this was thermal-related, and there weren't any other red flags in the bug report. Please re-open if you hit this again. Cheers.. @sterlingcrispin: Have you tried enabling sustained performance mode for your app? There are some instructions here, \"under the Targeting Daydream (Android only)\" section on how to configure this within Unity.. Hi @victorchentw, would you mind attaching a bug report that captures the issue? Or at least including the result of \"adb shell dumpsys display | grep DisplayInfo\"?\nThe assertion you're seeing is applied to the buffer size specification set by the client, which is required to be non-zero. If the client (in this case, Unity) is using the result of the recommended render target size, it's possible there's a bogus value being reported for the device's display metrics.\nAre you seeing this issue for all Daydream/Cardvborad apps? Or just this particular app?\n. It looks like the device is reporting a DPI value of \"0\" for the horizontal and vertical DPI:\ndensity 320 (0.0 x 0.0) dpi. Can you share some additional information about this piece of hardware, and its specs? Google isn't revealing much.. To those of you that are able to repro, can you try adding uiMode as an additional entry to the android:configChanges attribute of the permission Activity's manifest? For the S8, you might need to also add density to the same attribute. If we can get confirmation that this resolves the issue, we'll be sure to update the permission samples. Thanks.\nYou might need to unpack the gvr-permissionsupport-release.aar, modify its AndroidManifest.xml in-place, then re-archive it, e.g., for TransitionVRActivity change\nandroid:configChanges=\"orientation|screenSize|\"\nto\nandroid:configChanges=\"orientation|screenSize|uiMode|density\". > We hope to have a fix for Unity 2017.1 built apps in the an upcoming version of Google VR Services.\nThe updated version should be fully rolled out by this coming Friday (4/6).. Hi @tedtheodore, is there any chance you can add some additional context for the problem you're trying to solve? That is, more about the need to set the default viewer profile? We're looking for additional reasons to continue supporting this API, which we had been planning to deprecate.\nWould it be sufficient to simply override the session viewer profile, rather than the global viewer profile?. Thanks for the feedback. We'll look into improving support for this in the next release. I'll share more details as we decide on concrete changes to the API and/or Google VR Services.. Can you post a screenshot?. It's possible that the issue is related to the device misreporting the actual screen DPI, which would impact the distortion and prevent stereo convergence. Would you mind posting the result of the following command:\nadb shell dumpsys display | grep mBaseDisplayInfo. Nothing about the screenshot would indicate issues with convergence. Are you saying that only the Cardboard headset has problems? Is it impossible to converge, or just difficult?. It's also possible that the reported DPI isn't the true DPI, which could yield the stretched visuals you're seeing.\nIs there any way you can measure just the physical display area so we can check if the reported DPIs are in the right ballpark?. Yeah, it looks like the device is misreporting the (portrait) vertical DPI (actual: 402, reported: 449), which could cause stretching of the horizontal visuals when in landscape.\nWhat is the device name as reported by adb shell getprop ro.product.device? We might consider adding a static override for the DPI, though it'd be nice to avoid that. Does the device offer any kind of custom Display settings you can fiddle with?. The device is likely reporting the wrong DPI to ensure compatibility with apps that use 16/9 assets (16/9 == (18/9 * 400/450), where 450 is the misreported DPI). This probably works fine for some apps, as you say, but not for others (and not with Cardboard).. ",

Thanks for explaining the speaker mode...thats where there was some confusion on my end.\nI can hear audio...and the stereo panning does work,  But it seems that the audio doesn't change based on my head movement.\nIn other words, if I keep my head still and move the GVRAudioSource around I can hear tell that I just move it from my left to right. HOWEVER, if I leave the GVRAudioSource in one place and turn my head 360 degrees...I cant pinpoint the location of the sound. The sound doesn't change based on HMD movement. \nThis makes the sound coming from it the same regardless of where I look. It seems as though only distance and occulsion work properly for me. I fooled around with all of the setting as can't get the audio to sound \"different\" when I turn my head.. You hit the nail on the head.\nI did have the GvrAudioListener attached to the \"Camera (ears)\", however the transform was not being updated. I did a quick test by attaching the GvrAudioListener to the \"Camera (eye)\", (which the transform IS moving)...and the sound is working as expected!\nThat means I need to figure out why the transform for the \"Camera (ears)\" isn't updating...but that's another issue.

But I have no clues as where to look or tinker. and I have no idea what changes were made during the update. :-(. Hmm - my bad. Perhaps. \nIt turns out that the problem was that my project build settings, even after uninstalling Unity and reinstalling from GVR12, remained in set to PC standalone, not Android. Since only Android support is included in the GVR12 installation, the player failed. Changing build settings to Android seemingly solved the problem (I got a new one - somehow, the build process hits \"access denied\" when trying to build, but that is off topic here). \nHowever - it is somewhat annoying that after having made a project with Android as target, and trying to make a new project, I still keep the old \"standalone\" build settings, and the GVR unity package is not there when I open the project. If I try to \"Add Asset Package\" from the \"Make New Project\" splash screen, the Google package is not even shown, which means I have to manually import the package and then switch build settings in order to make the new project work. So much for \"native support\". Is that somehow fixable?. ",

I did try deleting the GoogleVR and Plugins folders from my project 1st then imported the GVR 1.03 SDK package instead but I still can't see Cardboard in the list of available VR SDKs (maybe it's meant to be like that since Selzier said I won't be able to see Cardboard as a build target for VR so I don't need to worry?).

Unfortunately I deleted the folder (GVR 1.0) in Unity and imported the package (GVR 1.140) before I read your post and ran into issue 774.

    "bopangzz": "Unfortunately, Vulkan is not supported in Daydream yet. . Which version of Unity you are using? Is it a Daydream Technique preview version?. I assume you are using the Daydream Technique preview version of Unity? If so, you can try to disable the built in neck model by setting InputTracking.disablePositionalTracking = true and modify your camera position.. I believe the source code of libgvrviceo.so is not available.. Can you get a full log by chance? I will take a look and get back to you once I have more info.. Thanks! We will look into this.. We uses some level-19 APIs in our sdk so it is not guaranteed to work with pre-19 target. You should set 19 as your minimal target for cardboard.. Which version of Unity are you using? Are you using the Daydream Technical preview version?. Thanks for the bug report. We will look into this on our side.. Yeah, if you are not using a Daydream Technical preview version, you need to import the GVRBackwardsCompatibility package.. Looks like you found the solution. Closing this issue.. You shouldn't need to do anything. Did it render the scene in stereo on the phone? Can you attach the logcat when you run your build?. Can you please try using Unity 5.6.b10?. Hi, I assume your app is a cardboard app? Which version of Unity and GVR sdk your are using?. It is a rendering order issue. I think if you set the Order in Layer of your canvas to non-zero value, you also need to set the reticle mesh renderer sorting order to the same or larger value than the on in your canvas.. I think you need to set the sortingLayerName and sortingOrder on the reticle meshrenderer in C#. GVR SDK doesn't have Vulkan support for now. You have to use gles if you are developing Daydream.. Do you mind put your issue in the gvr-audio-wwise-sdk repo?. Yes, FOV need to match the VR viewer so you cannot change it.. Yeah, that is the correct solution. The step for building iOS is included in the repo README file.. Thanks for the report. We will look into this issue.. Also can you provide more information on how you setup the intent and when you call the GvrIntent.GetData()? . I think you are correct. The runtime permission code you are using is for Daydream specific, which use the Daydream specific api to transit to a 2D activity so it doesn't work on cardboard-only devices.\nAre you trying have you app support both cardboard and daydream at the same time? \n. As far as I know, we don't have any plan to have permission api to support Cardboard but I will bring up with the team. \nAlso if you are building separately, why not just target Android 22 for your cardboard build?. You should be able to use GVR Unity SDK 1.3  and unity 5.6 with native vr disabled for iOS cardbaord.. Why you put a None there? Does it work if you only have Cardboard in the VR settings?. @joejo-unity Can you take a look at this issue? Seems like an issue in Unity VR rendering.. Thanks for the bug report. We will look into it.. Can you try comment out the following line in GvrViewer.cs and see if it fixes your issue?\ndevice.SetVRModeEnabled(vrModeEnabled);\nNote that there are two of them.. Sorry I missed that. Can you try comment out line 40 in AndroidDevice.cs? Basically make the SetVRModeEnabled function a no-op. \nThough the error you saw in the logcat may not be the the cause of the visual effect you saw. Can you also attach a screenshot? Have you tried pair with other viewer? Is the distortion correct for other viewers?. Thanks for the all the information. They are pretty helpful. Just one thing to confirm here, the setting button and your app works as expected on Moto G4n and S7 Edge but with the same build you are having those issue on S7? What is the Android Version for you G4 and S7 Edge?. Hi, \nI think there are basically two issue here and they may not be related.\n1. The setting icon is missing.\n2. The distortion is not correct on S7(It looks like this issue: #421)\nFor the icon issue, I tried to build GVRDemo with Unity 5.3.8p2 and GVR Unity SDK1.40 and run it on my Nexus 5, the icon shows up fine. Can you share your build of GVRDemo with Unity 5.3.8p2 and GVR Unity SDK 1.40 so I can test on my phone?\nFor the S7 distortion issue, according to #421, it should be fixed with GVR Services 1.10.17... Can you try revert your changes(make it call SetVRModeEnabled) with Google VR Services installed and see if you have the correct distortion? \nAnd could you also try set your screen resolution to native on you S7 and see if you still have the distortion issue? This is just to check if you are having the same issue as #421.\n. I tried your test app on a Nexus 5 and S7 edge and I can't reproduce the missing icon issue. I will try to find a S7 and run some test. But in the meanwhile, can you send me a full logcat running your GVRDemo build on S7 without \"Unity\" filter? . Thanks for the report!

    "ninjingames": "Samsung apparently reduced the screen resolution of the Galaxy S7 from its native 2560x1440 to 1920x1080 with the update to Android 7. This article is about a beta build, but I believe it's in the final as well.\nCould we please get an update on the situation from somebody at Google? The SGS7 is probably one of the most popular phones for VR applications and if it doesn't work correctly with the GVR SDK it's really tough for us developers dealing with all the bad ratings and complaints from users.. This is really a problem that Google has to fix. We can't force all SGS7 users to go into their settings and change the resolution.\nIt's a problem that Google is capable to fix, since the official Google Cardboard app works correctly with the lower resolution, so Google has a code branch somewhere that works correctly. Also the SGS7 properly reports the changed dpi for the different screen resolutions you can select, so the GVR SDK should be able to work with whatever resolution the user has selected.\n@miraleung You wrote \"we'll look into this\" two months ago. Any update on the situation?. @miraleung The problem still exists for GVR1.3 and Unity 5.6.0f3.\nSteps I took to reproduce the problem:\n- Create new project in Unity 5.6.0f3\n- Import Google VR SDK v1.3.0\n- Open GVRDemo.scene\n- Set Build target to Android, turn on \"Virtual Reality Supported\" in player settings, add Cardboard to \"Virtual Reality SDKs\", Change Minimum API Level to Android 4.4\n- Build and deploy to Galaxy S7 with FullHD Resolution\n- Run DemoGVR => Double vision\n- Change resolution to WQHD and run again => app displays correctly\n- Switch resolution back to FullHD => fail again\nAre you sure that the Galaxy S7 you've tried to reproduce the problem with is set to FullHD resolution instead of the displays native WQHD?\nIf you set the screen resolution to WQHD the 3D effect works correctly, but unfortunately all Galaxy S7 were changed to use FullHD by default during the upgrade to Android 7.0, so it affects the majority of all Galaxy S7 owners who didn't manually change resolution back to WQHD.\n@Zoriak22 I think this issue (which was posted 26 Dec 2016, not August 2016) really is about resolution and Android 7.0, because everything works correctly with the resolution set to WQHD (which was the default and only setting on Android 6.0 and was changed to FullHD during the update to Android 7.0).. This is probably the same as issue #421 \nWe've been waiting for a fix from the GVR team for almost half a year now, so don't get your hopes up...\n. ",
    "guneyozsan": "@miraleung I also confirm the view is out of focus in S7 set to Full HD both in Android 6 and 7 (you see double), but it is normal in WQHD. This is the case for all versions of Unity from 5.6.0b9 to 5.6.0f3 and Google VR SDK 1.20 and 1.30.\nI was thinking Google VR SDK was incompatible with Gear VR (in cardboard mode not oculus) and had ordered a different viewer. Thanks to this topic setting to WQHD resolved the issue. Honestly I didn't even know my S7 was downsized until I find this topic. I don't think any regular user can notice and change the setting for an app/game that behaves buggy.. I can confirm this is fixed for me after receiving the Google VR Services version 1.10.170928015.. If it helps our versions are Unity 2017.1.1p2 and GVR 1.60.. I was able to prevent the crash by delaying the load device for a few frames. I started by delaying for a few seconds then narrowed down to a few frames. I didn't measure exactly how many since it was sufficient for us.\nWe see this crash for Unity 5.6.0b9-10-11 and Google SDK 1.20 and 1.30. b9-10 and 1.20 was Android 7 specific (Google Pixel) but b11 and 1.30 was also crashing on Android 6 (Samsung S7).\nEventually I used WaitForSeconds because single frame delay is unable to return back to portrait UI. This time it doesn't crash either way, but when switching back to 2D it stucks with split screen rotated 90 degrees to portrait mode, displaying my 2D UI.\nSo the solution was something like:\nvoid Start() {\n        StartCoroutine(LoadDevice(\"cardboard\"));\n}\nIEnumerator LoadDevice(string newDevice)\n    {\n        yield return null; // repeat this a few more times or use yield return new WaitForSeconds(1f);\n        VRSettings.LoadDeviceByName(newDevice);\n        yield return null;\n        VRSettings.enabled = true;\n    }\ncrash log is:\nFinishing drawing window Window{3cba25c u0 d0 com.Test.Test/com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerActivity}: mDrawState=DRAW_PENDING\nTimeline: Activity_windows_visible id: ActivityRecord{422a918 u0 com.Test.Test/com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerActivity t4140} time:6680603\nScreen frozen for +207ms due to Window{3cba25c u0 d0 com.Test.Test/com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerActivity}\n[EGL] Failed to create window surface: EGL_BAD_ALLOC: EGL failed to allocate resources for the requested operation.\nSkipped rendering frame because GfxDevice is in invalid state (device lost)\nOPENGL NATIVE PLUG-IN ERROR: GL_INVALID_OPERATION: Operation illegal in current state\n(Filename: ./Runtime/GfxDevice/opengles/GfxDeviceGLES.cpp Line: 365)\nOPENGL NATIVE PLUG-IN ERROR: GL_INVALID_VALUE: Numeric argument out of range\n(Filename: ./Runtime/GfxDevice/opengles/GfxDeviceGLES.cpp Line: 365)\nForce finishing activity com.Test.Test/com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerActivity\nWIN DEATH: Window{3cba25c u0 d0 com.Test.Test/com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerActivity}\nThe process of this window already died: Window{3cba25c u0 d0 com.Test.Test/com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerActivity} : android.os.DeadObjectException\nFailed to report 'resized' to the client of Window{3cba25c u0 d0 com.Test.Test/com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerActivity}, removing this window.\ndispatchOnViewCreated > Target : com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerActivity isFragment :false. @Baptistegrv  To be more specific our problem is only when calling this at Start(). Delaying everything by at least a frame by using yield return null before VRSettings.LoadDeviceByName(newDevice); resolves our problem.\nFor the yield statement after VRSettings.LoadDeviceByName(newDevice);, weird but starting with some version of Unity 5.60fx I had to separate VR and None cases. So current working code called from Start() looks like:\n```\nIEnumerator LoadDevice(string newDevice)\n{\n    if (newDevice != \"None\")\n    {\n        yield return new WaitForSeconds(initialSceneDelayTime);\n    }\nVRSettings.LoadDeviceByName(newDevice);\n\nif (newDevice == \"None\")\n{\n    yield return new WaitForEndOfFrame();\n}\nelse\n{\n    yield return null;\n}\nif (newDevice == \"None\")\n{\n    VRSettings.enabled = false;\n}\nelse\n{\n    VRSettings.enabled = true;\n}\n\nif (newDevice == \"None\")\n{\n    SceneManager.LoadScene(\"MainMenu\");\n}\n\n}\n```\n(By the way, for the \"after\" case I like the approach of checking if the device is ready but I believe that kind of stuff shouldn't be necessary and taken care of internally.). I suggest switching to Unity 2017.1.0f1. Any version of Unity 5.6 gives OPENGL errors regardless of a crash or not (both sample logs below for GVR 1.30). It just can recover if it doesn't crash and looks like WaitForSeconds is buying time for recovery. WaitForSeconds can work for some time but anytime the crashes can revive back.\nLog when it crashes\n06-30 16:40:54.331  3111  3867 E BufferQueueProducer: [SurfaceView - com.company.product/com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerActivity] connect: BufferQueue has been abandoned\n06-30 16:40:54.332 23543 23561 E libEGL  : eglCreateWindowSurface: native_window_api_connect (win=0xdede9008) failed (0xffffffed) (already connected to another API?)\n06-30 16:40:54.332 23543 23561 E libEGL  : eglCreateWindowSurface:473 error 3003 (EGL_BAD_ALLOC)\n06-30 16:40:54.333 23543 23561 E Unity   : [EGL] Failed to create window surface: EGL_BAD_ALLOC: EGL failed to allocate resources for the requested operation.\n06-30 16:40:54.333 23543 23561 E Unity   :\n06-30 16:40:54.333 23543 23561 E Unity   : (Filename: ./Runtime/GfxDevice/egl/WindowContextEGL.cpp Line: 141)\n06-30 16:40:54.333 23543 23561 E Unity   :\n06-30 16:40:54.333 23543 23561 E libEGL  : call to OpenGL ES API with no current context (logged once per thread)\n06-30 16:40:54.366 23543 23580 E libEGL  : call to OpenGL ES API with no current context (logged once per thread)\n06-30 16:40:54.378 23543 23580 F libc    : Fatal signal 11 (SIGSEGV), code 1, fault addr 0x2d0 in tid 23580 (Thread-115)\nLog when it doesn't crash\n07-01 02:05:28.065 23509 23544 E Unity   : OPENGL NATIVE PLUG-IN ERROR: GL_OUT_OF_MEMORY: Not enough memory left to execute command\n07-01 02:05:28.065 23509 23544 E Unity   :\n07-01 02:05:28.065 23509 23544 E Unity   : (Filename: ./Runtime/GfxDevice/opengles/GfxDeviceGLES.cpp Line: 383)\n07-01 02:05:28.065 23509 23544 E Unity   :\n07-01 02:05:28.096  3111  3868 E BufferQueueProducer: [SurfaceView - com.company.product/com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerActivity] dequeueBuffer: BufferQueue has been abandoned\n07-01 02:05:28.115  3111  3868 E BufferQueueProducer: [SurfaceView - com.company.product/com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerActivity] dequeueBuffer: BufferQueue has been abandoned\n07-01 02:05:28.139 23509 23544 E Unity   : OPENGL NATIVE PLUG-IN ERROR: GL_STACK_OVERFLOW_KHR: OpenGL stack overflow\n07-01 02:05:28.139 23509 23544 E Unity   :\n07-01 02:05:28.139 23509 23544 E Unity   : (Filename: ./Runtime/GfxDevice/opengles/GfxDeviceGLES.cpp Line: 383). I had the same problem and following the suggestion by Unity and turning off the VR support to use the GVR SDK directly didn't run in VR mode either.\nWith Unity 5.6.0f2 update I could make it work by following these steps:\n- Enable VR Support for iOS in Unity and add Cardboard.\n- Search for UNITY_HAS_GOOGLEVR in the project scripts and modify the code to include IOS with Android as well.\nMostly this is  putting\n|| UNITY_IOS\nnear \nUNITY_ANDROID\nA few places require some more detailed tweaks but you can figure it out reading the code.\nYou should do this for all Google VR SDK scripts except the ones related with Daydream Controller. What I did was to put it everywhere and clean them back following the console errors after you hit Build in Unity. Also I commented out a few of the lines with errors instead of rolling back UNITY_IOS as some part of the code was still needed in iOS.\n- Build in Unity.\n- Remove the line containing:\n/* libPods-Unity-iPhone.a in Frameworks */,\nfrom the project.pbxproj file under Unity-iPhone.xcodeproj in the Xcode project, because it was complaining \"file not found\".\n- In iOS Project Builder for Windows, add the path \"-IPods\\GVRSDK\\Sources\" for the missing file \"GVROverlayView.h\" as a compiler flag.\n- Compile using iOS Project Builder for Windows.. For reference, this is my current GoogleVR folder:\nGoogleVR.zip\n@mjsibbald\nI am compiling using iOS Project Builder on Windows and it has different errors (and solutions) for the same problem. In Xcode removing ObjC from the list here had resolved this duplicate errors in a prior similar issue:\n\nAlso did you try deleting libgvrunity.a and libGVRSDK.a, or removing references to them? What I understand from the overall discussions here is at least libgvrunity.a shouldn't be required in native VR support (no idea about ibGVRSDK.a) and worth trying deleting the files and maybe the possible references of the latter errors it may cause.\nIn general, I suggest moving one step at a time and compile each time.. If you switch to a VR scene from a non-VR scene and enable VR in Start() of the new scene, delaying the switch a few Update cycles after Start() resolved our crash. You may check 453 and 492.. Issue persists with 5.6.0f3.\nIt also happens when I setup the objects manually, not special to prefabs as I mentioned above.. In my case, the reticle hovers to the UI button coming from the plane on the background which is quite close, so both near 10 meters away from camera. It also does the same from infinity to buttons located at 20-30 meters.\nMy workaround was to replace all UI Buttons with Mesh Colliders with Event Triggers.. Did you enable native VR and add Cardboard or Daydream to VR platforms in Player Settings? Because when you enable native VR you won't be able to set landscape left as you mentioned. Unity 5.6 doesn't support non-native integration as in prior versions of Google VR, it is not backwards compatible. You have to use native support, otherwise it won't work on Android.\nI only had manifest merge issues when I updated Google plugin or Unity, which was always resolved by deleting Google SDK and all of its files in the Plugins directory (including manifests) and reimporting it.\nInstead of reimporting the SDK, pulling the manifest files that used to work before the update from the repo, and replacing the updated manifests also worked.\nAlso be sure not to have an AndroidManifest.xml file but only AndroidManifest-Cardboard.xml and AndroidManifest-Daydream.xml in Plugins/Android.. @synthercat I agree it sounds a bit weird but you need to both install Google VR SDK and use native SDK starting with Unity 5.6. Native side takes care of the rendering but pointer and controller stuff is still handled by Google VR SDK. Perhaps there may be other things like that.\nFor iOS we need to wait for 1.40 unless you want to dive into crazy hacks. Unity removed backwards compatibility and iOS side is lagging behind.. @batchku Your app is working fine. You can simulate head with Alt+mouse or Ctrl+mouse and click around.\nThe message in the game window is just a warning that you don't have a Daydream controller (a separate device with buttons that you hold in your hands).\nWhen you click \"Virtual Reality Supported\" you use native SDK embedded in Unity. Before 5.6 you had to disable \"VR Supported\" option and use imported Google SDK instead but with 5.6 you have to enable it but still use Google SDK. What we discuss is the expected behavior when you enable native SDK in Unity is you shouldn't need to import also the Google VR SDK. This seems to create some confusion for people who started development before native support in Unity.. It can be better if you open a new issue for the reticle problem.. From Unity 5.6 release notes:\n\nVR: [Daydream] You may notice that your Daydream VR display is dimmer than other VR devices. This is by design, as a means of prolonging battery life while in VR.\nhttps://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/unity-5.6.0. @Ibrahimhassan1 you may check this discussion https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/issues/453\n\nAnd, have you added \"None\" to top of your VR build settings? \nAlso using Gyroscope is expensive. I suggest solving this early without building on gyro. Or you still want to keep tracking the orientation in 2D mode?. A workaround is to use Unity plus and turn off splash screen. Then if you want you can add a hand made splash screen as a separate scene.\nAlso you can make the first frame black so that automatic transitions on launch are not noticeable.  But still there is no way to prevent desktop rotating to landscape when the app launches. \nI think exiting with the cross is a global behavior among all cardboards. What you can do is to switch to portrait mode with back button or when you detect portrait orientation. . I also get similar errors with both Unity 5.6.0f3 and Unity 2017.1.0b4 with GVR 1.40. However I can build with Unity 5.6.0f3 and GVR 1.30 with some custom modifications.\nUnfortunately @oa2013's solution to set Scripting Define Symbols doesn't work for me.

Looks like this is fixed in 2017.1.0b8. I develop on Android and use iPad mini 1st gen for testing (same generation with iPhone5) and it also run very sluggish on both iOS8 and iOS9 (impossible to use, just can test) and it crashes if I load some number of large textures.\nIt is not surprising that VR requires a decent phone but I think you've got point about the documentation.. Did you also try delaying the initial call a few frames away from Start()?. A similar issue was mentioned here before for some WQHD (2560x1440) Androids set to 1920x1080 resolution. The problem was resolving by setting the device to WQHD resolution. Maybe it helps.. I agree about the inconsistency mentioned. We are stuck with Unity 5.6 and a manually modified 1.30 to have a Cardboard+2D app on iOS+Android. Our Android is stable, but iOS builds need manual intervention before building in Xcode. We only use 2D-VR switch and event system.\nAny combination of Unity 5.6, 2017b and Gvr 1.40, 1.50 has app or experience breaking issues here and there on either on iOS or Android even with such a basic setup. And with 1.50 even the previewing in Unity doesn't work with the new preview script (the plug and play built in GVR reticle flies all around the 3D space), and try attaching a HUD to your camera. I don't even mention introducing layers for menus.\nI try to report all issues here and also to Unity but every new version is a week's work just to test with a few Unity versions and reporting an issue doesn't mean much without preparing replicate projects or stripping down the commercial projects and post here (or to Unity). @miraleung \n- GVR reticle is child of the camera and works very well on builds through 1.30 to 1.50. The problem is the new editor simulator of 1.50 (not builds). Anything attached to camera (HUD and GVR reticle in this case) doesn't stay in the center and goes off screen very fast with head movements. But they enter the screen and find the initial point if I make a full 360 rotation. It looks like they follow an elliptical path around the camera and the camera is located in the middle of the focal points of the ellipse.\n\n\nIt is not possible to use Unity cloud builder for iOS builds due to all hacks and manual handling in iOS build pipeline. The \"add cardboard\" dialog added a manual obstacle to our local automatic build pipeline as well.\n\n@nathanmartz Thanks for the good news! The difficulty is we spend a lot of time just experimenting new  builds. It is very difficult to find additional time to reproduce bugs in small projects and submit them while maintaining stability for apps already in production. Migrating an actual project to a new version is already a few days of work, reproducing them for submitting is quite hard.. For \"GVROverlayView.h\" not found error in 5.6.0f3 and 1.30 using -IPods/GVRSDK/Sources linker flag or using the trick of copying the GVROverlayView.h file from Pods/Headers/Public/GVRSDK folder to the top-level Classes folder as mentioned here works: https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/issues/504#issuecomment-292692060\nYou can try that.. I saw this in 2017.1.0b8 release notes, is it related?\n\nVR: Fix for iOS Cardboard Left and right camera view is offset too far away from one another due to wrong viewport settings (being backported to 5.6) (912866). I put None because the app starts in 2D mode and switches to VR mode later. Unity launches the app in the topmost mode.. I think I got it. Although it says Virtual Reality support overrides the orientation settings, if I don't set \"Device Orientation\" to \"Portrait\" in Xcode this bug happens.\n\n\nXcode defaults to \"Landscape Right\" after building in Unity and building with this setting causes the bug:\n\nSetting it manually to \"Portrait\" fixes the bug:\n\n\nUsing this code on  Awake() or Start() doesn't make any difference:\nScreen.orientation = ScreenOrientation.Portrait;. The stereo focus of the laser changes according to the location of the object it collides. In your case it is the planet and infinity. You can try putting an invisible collider very close to (or in the same plane with) the planet.. I second this issue. @pozil The real problem is that the camera behavior of the GvrEditorEmulator and builded apps are different. I think we need to be sure the design in editor is consistent with the result in the builded app. It was very consistent in the previous double vision version which makes it easy to construct complex scenes and interactions.\nFor example Gear VR also takes over camera completely and requires a container game object, but the behavior is consistent between build and editor. It gets even more diverse if you have more complex camera setups. I want to know if container objects are required by design or by coincidence.\nInconsistencies I noticed that work well in builds but not with GvrEditorEmulator are:\n- The new emulator repositions the camera to (0,0,0).\n- Using different layers with multiple cameras results in strange behavior in emulator (for example UI).\nVideos.zip\nThis can be fixed by putting an emulator to all cameras but each GvrEditorEmulator script present in scene adds 1x to the movement speed and some jiggle.\nAs an example to a complex camera setup, I use a top-down camera that allows the player to look to the whole scene like a TV in front of him/her. I child Player Camera to a GameObject with a rotation (90,0,0) to be able to get the top-down view to in front of the player in VR. And set Player Camera's local rotation from a dummy camera controlled by Gvr.\n\n\nCurrently the emulator movement speed is 3x for this setup and I need to modify my code to fit a setup with a camera container although there is no need to have it work on builds.. @pozil I couldn't migrate to 1.60 until now. Finally I'm there and your trick https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/issues/606#issuecomment-308382227 worked very well. Thanks.. This asset from asset store adds timed click to Google VR's reticle:\nGazeClick for GoogleVR\nI should mention I didn't try it personally.. I also load the device with LoadDeviceByName, newDevice being Cardboard or None and both should be added in VR SDK's at Player Settings.\nThis is how I managed to switch between modes. I wait for a safety check + 5 frames to make the switch without random crashes or falling into that distorted screen. If you call this at start, LoadDeviceByName should also be delayed at least 1 frame. I also wait for extra 0.5 seconds after start which prevents random crashes.\n    VRSettings.LoadDeviceByName(newDevice);\n\n    while (!VRSettings.loadedDeviceName.Equals(newDevice))\n    {\n        yield return null;\n    }\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)\n    {\n        yield return null;\n    }\n\n    VRSettings.enabled = true;\n\n. In GVR 1.30 you can do this on your camera to disable head tracking.\nvoid Start()\n{\n    gvrHead = GetComponent<GvrHead>();\n\n} \nand later use \n        gvrHead.enabled = false;\n\nThis is a legacy class. Not sure how it will be possible to do this in future versions.. The errors are still there with 5.6.2 even though the issue looks fixed and to my experience you can never know when it starts crashing randomly again. 2017.1.0f1 looks clean.\nhttps://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/issues/453#issuecomment-314563071. Details on CocoaPods were more insightful, thanks. I was hopeful for cloud build support since the beginning of this year but no improvement yet. I also mentioned the issue little before here: https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/issues/656\nBeing unable to use cloud build, most of the issues on iOS block our QA and deployment cycle and takes away precious development time. Frustrating.. We get the same reports from users with S8+. If it is WQHD it works fine, if not it crashes during switch from 2D to VR. Since the app starts 2D we don't have info on what happens during switch from VR to 2D.. @dustinkerstein You should be able to get the current resolution by using a full screen canvas and reading canvas width and height in screen space (rotating the device will switch parameters, so you may need to use min and max for determining width and height). Screen class is useless as it always returns native resolution for some reason. If canvas method doesn't work let me know and I'll dig into my projects to find how I solved it before.. @dustinkerstein I checked and this is how I get the current resolution:\nCanvasScaler canvasScaler;\nint shortSide = Mathf.Min(Mathf.RoundToInt(canvasScaler.referenceResolution.x), Mathf.RoundToInt(canvasScaler.referenceResolution.y));\nint longSide = Mathf.Max(Mathf.RoundToInt(canvasScaler.referenceResolution.x), Mathf.RoundToInt(canvasScaler.referenceResolution.y));. @dustinkerstein Ops, you are right. Sorry, it has been a year I did this and the inconsistent results mislead me. Actually Canvas.pixelRect.width/height should also be the solution. Since both Screen class and Canvas.pixelRect.width/height gives native resolution I suspect that Unity always runs in native WQHD and the device downscales the display from WQHD to FHD.. You can also check this topic to see if WQHD fixes the crash: https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/issues/671. @aAAC yes that's another problem. I noted the issue to help you see if it is the same problem or not.. I also had some issues with ObjectPool class name conflicting with some other plugins.. ",

My assumption is that somehow it gets the wrong profile data in (UpdateScreenData). It's notable that the settings icon doesn't get drawn either. \nHere are three screen shots, all taken with Homido Mini configured:\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B0HJORhfMvneT3NQVVcyQmlqd0k?usp=sharing\nCardboardDemo is a shot from the actual Cardboard app.\nMagicVR is a shot from a Cardboard app playing a video.\nMyApp is a shot from my app.\nNote in particular the placement of the cursor dots in CardboardDemo and MyApp. The cursor is a 3D object straight in front of the middle camera. When my app is working (on other phones) the cursor looks 3D and with Homido Mini appears about the same place as the CardboardDemo one.\nI note that the app works as expected on a Motorola Moto G4 Plus and an S7 Edge (with same OS, GoogleVR services, Cardboard and Unity).\nCommenting out line 40 of AndroidDevice.cs made no difference to the appearance.\nI put a breakpoint in AndroidDevice.Init() and stepped through the code. Line 35 of AndroidDevice.cs does activityListener = Create(ActivityListenerClass). And that call fails returning null.\nEverything else in InitDevice seems sensible.\nFinally I have to apologise, I've done my last set of tests with my full app, rather than the 1.40 GVRDemo. I've re-run the tests and get the same results, and I've added an additional screenshot from GVRDemo.\nI've also added the full adb logcat -s Unity from the demo app to GVRDemoLogcat.txt and put in on the Google drive too.\nThis is probably a red herring, but I'd expect the settings icon, the separator bar and the back button to all be drawn as they are in the Cardboard demo. However on my S7 neither the GVRDemo nor my own app display either of these and as SupportsNativeUILayer is hardcoded to true for Android I'm assuming this is also supposed to be done in the Google VR Services? On the S7 Edge we do get a settings button with my own app.\nHope that some of this helps. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do.\n. Situation is not as straight forward as one might hope.\nMoto G4+\nOS: Android 7.0 August Patch\nGoogle VR Services: Not installed\nCardboard App: 1.8\nMy app - draws the settings / separator / back and seems to have correct profile\nGVRDemo - doesn't draw settings etc but does have correct profile\nI retested the two apps a couple of times and definitely what's happening.\nI installed GoogleVR servives and nothing changed.\nSamsung Galaxy S7 Edge\nOS: Android 7.0 August Patch\nGoogle VR services: 1.10.170928015\nCardboard App: 1.8\nMy app - recent but not same build (same GVR/Unity), does draw settings and does do correct profile\nGVRDemo - untested\nI note that my app (as opposed to GVRDemo) is running an older version of the Google VR Unity plugin.\nAs a final test I used the settings icon in my app on the S7 to change the profile (it prompted for VR Services or Cardboard - I chose Cardboard) and changed the config and went back to app and saw it change.\nI may be able to get someone to try GVRDemo on the Edge tomorrow, for now I'm signing off until midday UK time.. Just re-run all the tests with the same builds (SetVRModeEnabled commented out):\nS7\nMy App            Icon: No  Profile: No\nGVRDemo        Icon: No  Profile: No\n(Profile used for both builds is the same, just doesn't match the Cardboard configured one).\nS7 Edge\nMy App            Icon: No   Profile: Yes\nGVRDemo        Icon: No  Profile: Yes\nMoto G4+\nMy App           Icon: Yes   Profile: Yes\nGVRDemo       Icon: No   Profile: Yes\nAll: Android 7 August, Card 1.8, GVR Services: 1.10.17..., Unity 5.3.8p2\nDoesn't seem to matter if GVR Services are installed or not.\nMy App older version of GoogleVR plugin. GVRDemo 1.40 version of GoogleVR plugin.\nIcon means drawing settings icon, back button, separator.\nProfile means reacts to changes in profile within Cardboard app.\n. Regarding 1: Setting Icon Missing\nI've placed a fresh build of the GVRDemo scene using Unity 5.3.8p2 and plugin 1.40  into the same drive folder (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B0HJORhfMvneT3NQVVcyQmlqd0k?usp=sharing) and called it GVRDemoAndroidDbg.apk.\nI've tested it on my S7 with latest GVR Services installed in FHD and WQHD res and the settings icon doesn't show up.\nI've also uploaded a copy of my own app (ubeityvrpriorsfieldcarddbg.apk). It starts in magic window mode, touch screen to bring up switch icon in bottom right corner, then switch to VR mode. I've run this build on S7 (no settings icon) and Moto G4+ (settings icon appears). As mentioned before we tested a similar build on S7 Edge and it also had settings icon appear.\nThis app is running quite a lot older version of the plugin.\nRegarding 2: Incorrect distortion #421 \nTurning off power saving mode and raising the resolution from FHD to WQHD does fix the distortion problem. with both my app and GVRDemo.\nInstalling Google VR Services (1.10.170928015) which appears to be the build that is intended to solve the problem - cleared the pairing with the Homido. Once I'd reset it then that continued to work fine in WQHD.\nWith 1.10.17... installed switching back to FHD still has the same problem in both. Comments in the #421 thread would indicate this might be common to earlier Unity / Plugin combinations.\n. I have added some comments to #421 but I note that that issue is marked as closed, despite that it is apparently not fixed for some combinations of Unity / Plugin.. Moving to 2017 is definitely desirable, however for current purposes there are three main motivations for staying with 5.3:\n\n\nI am fixing bugs in a already released product and upgrading to 5.6 or 2017 would likely introduce a larger number of unknown bugs which would require heavier testing to fix.\n\n\nI am also dealing with bugs in a second product which is close to release and too close to release to go through a major upgrade.\n\n\nFinally, someone in my team made an attempt to upgrade to 5.6 previously and hit a bunch of compatibility issues around VR (Cardboard, Gear and Oculus) which they did not manage to fix in the time allocated for the experiment. So presumption is that the upgrade is non-trivial, and we have yet to find the time for it.. I've placed the logcat in the same Google Drive directory.

LOL, bad decision to have \"*\" after / in comments but this wasn't it. Unity 5.6 has internal support for cardboard VR. If you went to the player settings and added Virtual Reallity support AND also used the googe GVR SDK (I see in the screenshot that you did use that) then you kind of added VR to your project twice... try removing the one from the playert settings or go to Unity 5.5.1f1\nAnother case is if you used multiple cameras in your project, then check these out\n456\n451 . If I remember correct spatial sound didn't work on my Mac export... it could be the same issue. @alandyshev  I'll have my Mac owner friend test this on his Mac soon!. 1. Are you sure you imported the whole .unitypackage?\n\nIs this a new empty project?\nHave you imported the additional files Unity askes after you import the GVR SDK?\n(these usually hide and you have to minimize and re-maximize Unity to see the window for that). \"The unable to parse file \" errors usually associate with\na. Errors in paths (I see non-english letters on the third window) I'd bet this cause the problem \nb. If you don't have administration right to these files\nc. .svn or git conflicts on the meta files (http://druss.co/2014/09/fixed-unable-to-parse-yaml-file-in-unity-3d-project/)\n\nHere is what I would try to fix the problem in case of (a)\n1. create a simple empty project\n2. close unity\n3. move the whole project (the one you just created) folder to a path as simple as possible like the \"C:\\\" root of you hard drive. It should not have non English letters. I am Greek and avoid Greek characters because sometimes they could cause issues. Even long pathnames could do that on Windows 10 sometimes\n4. reopen unity (DO NOT SELECT ANY PROJECT)\n5. press the open button (on the top bar)\n6. Search and select the folder you moved your folder (see number 3)\n7. Now, import GVR\nI hope this will fix your issues\nNote : In the beginning you said GVR SDK version was 1.20 at your last post 1.0.3. Are you sure you are not using something older that these two? (these should both work fine, I can't say anything about prior to version 1.0 though). First you reopened and THEN you tried to import the Google VR SDK, right?\nAre you using SVN or git?. Do you have the Google SDK activated in player settings?. No I didn't.. you are not supposed to use native SDK together with Google VR SDK asset\nWeird... the combo of native + external asset does produce better result. My thought exactly.. It seems that Unity take more control now. Also there isn't any function there to disable rotation, just position. https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/VR.InputTracking.html\nI guess you could always read the rotation and counter-rotate an empty that holds the camera. This should have the same effect (but yes, I don't like the sound of that either!). Found it! Sorry.

    "isaacengel": "I found the solution. I was missing two important things:\nFirst, messing with main.mm causes a lot of trouble. The correct approach for defining a custom App Controller is to create a subclass of UnityAppController and adding the macro IMPL_APP_CONTROLLER_SUBCLASS(name_of_the_class) at the bottom of its .mm file.\nSecond, Unity automatically generates a custom app controller, called CardboardAppController, which is located in the build directory, under 'Libraries/Plugins/iOS'. One of its functions is registering the unity audio effect plugin. I was bypassing this file without knowing, causing the audio renderer to not initialize properly. So my solution was to comment out the macro at the end of the file CardboardAppController.mm (line 71):\n//IMPL_APP_CONTROLLER_SUBCLASS(CardboardAppController)\nAnd defining the new custom controller as a subclass of CardboardAppController:\n```\n #import \"CardboardAppController.h\"\n@interface NewAppController : CardboardAppController\n @end\n@implementation NewAppController\n @end\n IMPL_APP_CONTROLLER_SUBCLASS(NewAppController)\n```\n.

Unity ships with an integration of a specific version of the Google NDK from the Cocoapods manager and will create your XCode project using that version of the Google NDK. The way the library is integrated through Cocoapods changes the way we generate the resulting project. Cocoapods creates a wrapping XCode workspace that contains the Unity project as well as a project for the Google NDK library and its dependencies.

Having support for only cardboard caused a freeze every single time after about ten seconds of being in cardboard view mode after enabling. I'm still getting crashes after going between \"none\" to cardboard VR mode and looking about for 5-10 seconds. in logcat the only errors I can see are those openGL errors and I still get them when deselecting \"auto graphics API\" (OpenGLES3 was already at the top of the list). My scene is a default scene and randomly has worked once or twice but more often than not will hang head tracking (the settings button for cardboard is still fully responsive) and then will crash after a while. I initially had none and cardboard (in that order) in my device list and I just tried going from daydream, none, cardboard in my device list and still same issue. \nI verified if I just launch straight into cardboard it works fine but I need to launch in \"none\" and be able to turn on stereoscopic. I'm on Unity 5.6.0f3 and GVR SDK 1.4. Appreciate the mention @lachlansleight of different combinations of daydream and cardboard support. My app isnt intended for daydream so I didnt include it but without daydream support included cardboard froze after about 10-15 seconds after enabling vr mode wevery single time without fail after the same duration.

You need to make changes in \"GvrVideoPlayerTexture.cs\".\nI came up with a 360 video player using EasyMovieTextures, I can share the project if you want.\nRegards,\nDevesh V. @simnys Hey, I got through some connections man.\nRegards,\nDevesh V. @MrPatrickHenry Hey Patrick, I am able to build the streaming video apps using Easy Movie Textures and Google VR SDK. I have both the projects, I will share the GitHub repo, with you.\nRegards,\nDevesh V. @Selzier I really did not know about this. Will take care of this.. I have tried the video demo scene, It works well in VR mode but the  Non-VR mode does not work. Camera is horizontally stretched when switching from VR Cardboard to VR None. \nI have used the previous version of GVR to switch from VR to Non-VR and used to work fine but there were issues in the Exoplayer compatibility. \nI wrote the below script:\n```\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\nusing UnityEngine.VR;\npublic class ToggleVR : MonoBehaviour {\nvoid Update () {\n\n}\n\nIEnumerator SwitchToVR() {\n  VRSettings.LoadDeviceByName(\"cardboard\");\n  yield return null;\n  VRSettings.enabled = true;\n}\n\nIEnumerator SwitchOutOfVr() {\n  VRSettings.LoadDeviceByName(\"\");\n  yield return null;\n}\n\nIEnumerator Start() {\n    while (true) {\n        yield return new WaitForSeconds(10f);\n        yield return SwitchToVR();\n\n        yield return new WaitForSeconds(10f);\n        yield return SwitchOutOfVr();\n}\n\n}\nvoid ResetCameras() {\n    for (int i = 0; i < Camera.allCameras.Length; i++) {\n        Camera cam = Camera.allCameras[i];\n        if (cam.enabled && cam.stereoTargetEye != StereoTargetEyeMask.None) {\n            cam.transform.localRotation = Quaternion.identity;\n    cam.transform.localPosition = Vector3.zero;\n            Camera.main.ResetAspect ();\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n}\n```\nBut this is not working. Any help is appreciated.\nThanks,\nDevesh V. Hello @jplongo \nTried your script but does not seem to work.. I am building a demo scene as \"VRDemo\"\nI am using Unity 5.6.4f1 and GVR 1.6.0, I copied your script and removed the unused part.\nPlease find the attached link to download the project: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q1u8KyaYPoSY-grRv7Pup4fQ9rYDC7nv/view?usp=sharing\nThanks. Hi,\nThank you for trying out the project. My test device is Samsung S7 which is running on Android 7.1\nThe player works fine in VR mode, but when switching to Non-VR the camera is horizontally stretched.\nPlease find the images link below:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1KfNK1LF1nTzmm7MO563thXkKy_LqQ2XF/view?usp=sharing  => This in VR Mode\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fpl7QvjUUNsBgmHzmKTde_zq0HxSoxMT/view?usp=sharing  => This is NoN-VR Mode, you can see the video is horizontally stretched.\nThanks,\nDevesh V \n. @jplongo Yes, I did that. @rusmaxham He says it works on his device which is a daydream ready phone. I remeber this issues was not there in previous version of GVR SDK. I have apps which works well in VR and Non-VR mode.\nThanks,\nDevesh V. This issue is resolved in the latest GVR SDK update.. ",
    "AayushU": "Thanks that was it. I removed the old files and reimported and it worked fine! . @reubenkcoutinho - That refers to this line:\n\"[DllImport (\"PluginName\")]\"\nyou just put the name like \"gvrvideo\" instead of \"libgvrvideo.so\"\nI can repro this issue as well. @perqa - what device are you using to deploy? . It looks like it's this issue: https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-crash-in-settexture-with-googlevr-sdk-1-dot-2-on-ios\nIt's fixed in Unity 2017.1, but so far not in Unity 5.6.x. . ",
    "kaleknavicius": "Ok so for now the only workaround that I found was:\n\nScan a random QR code of some other cardboard (found on google images) which switches the way my Build is being displayed on Pixel screen.\nPut my phone into Daydream viewer with NFC turned on.\nThen when the phone is inside, NFC kicks in, switches VR settings to Daydream automatically and the same error pops up saying that this cardboard app is not compatible with my Daydream.\nThen I cancel the error. Go into settings, disable NFC, put the phone back into Daydream viewer and then it works...\n\nUp until I close the app. If I want to run it again, I have to re-do all the steps. Must be a better way haha.... ",

    "VadimTikhonyuk": "Hi, I have same bug on 5.5, But in my case I use two cameras, one for UI, second for 3d Environment\nSo I just disable GvrEye and StereoRenderEffect on both eyes of UI Camera(this scripts instance at runtime). Hi,\nSame issue on Google VR 1.2 Unity 5.5.0\n. Update, On Unity 2017.1.0f3 same issue. Update, On my old Fly IQ4516 everething works fine.\nI think this crash happens on Samsung S8 after android update, which I got few days ago, after this update I didnt test VR mode in my app.. Hi, tedruxpin,\nThere is log file, I cut it from adb logcat, so something important maybe lost, because full logfile is huge\nlog.txt\n. @fredsa There have any way to open native settings and give user to change resolution. Similar to how this work in Gear VR. I have some skills in writing plugins on java. You can add stereo preview, open demo scene in google package, Also you can connect smarpthone via USB and control camera in unity by this way. In my case I use 5.6.0f3 with GVR 1.4. @fredsa GvrIntent.IsLaunchedFromVr() return False everytime if None VR SDK on first place.\nIf Daydream then True\nBut If I launch from home 2d launcher, then I need to put phone in helmet to continue. So how to fix this?\nIf launch from home 2D - launch as 2D application without any daydream intros\nIf launch from daydream launcher - launch daydream sdk + VR scene. If I enable splash screen then it works, need to do some more researches. Also If I enter in VR mode from 2D Scene with this code :\n\nThen Controller don't work again,\nAlso If Enter In VR Home then back again controller change position in game\n. ",

    "kevin1437": "Ah pardon me, it seems my phone didn't support gyroscope for VR features, already tried on other phone and it works well, Thank you for your response @bopangzz :). ",
    "elalish": "Okay, so according to https://developers.google.com/vr/unity/guide apparently enabling \"virtual reality supported\" was incorrect, because this is actually the native support that doesn't support iOS? So given that, this bug drops back to the original problem which is that the demo as is looks like stereo in the player, but not on the iphone, and it doesn't react to the gyros either, so it's just a static scene that doesn't actually demonstrate anything. What should I try next?. Does iOS cardboard just not work at all on the Unity 5.6 beta?. Okay, so I'm using 5.6b10. Do you mean the SDK works with iOS or native integration works with iOS? Because both are broken for me, hence the report.. ",
    "nathansizemore": "Unity bug also filed here.. Problem only occurs when \"VR Supported\" is checked in Player Settings. When using the GvrViewerMain prefab, everything works as expected.. Issue has been resolved with latest version of Unity beta 5.6.0b11.. At that time, Unity 5.6.0f1 had a bug that caused the editor to crash almost 90% of the time for a certain scene, so I rolled back to just use the regular GoogleVR SDK. It has since been resolved in their latest RC, and I'm no longer using 5.5.2.\nHowever, no; at the time, those were not in the project. I'm assuming those are the \"plugins\" that the editor prompts you to downloaded when you build? If so, the pop up always came up when building, but it never actually downloaded anything. Just an error saying it couldn't download.. ",
    "vinhui": "We still have the issue with sdk 1.3 on unity 5.6.0f1 on a Moto Z with Google VR Services 1.3.149854881 and probably the on the pixel as well. It might have something to do with enabling and disabling vr mode. Does it maybe have something to do with the following?\n03-08 12:57:27.154 10948 10948 E Unity   : Error trying to call delegated method unload. null\n03-08 12:57:27.154 10948 10948 E Unity   : Google VR Error [Daydream]: Exception caught while loading GoogleVR.

I also do the switching between mono and stereo. I haven't found a solution and I assume i can't fix it without the help of unity or google. 5.5 isn't an option since I also need daydream support. I have the switching working, it just throws a ton of opengl errors.. @fresda I actually have to wait 2 frames instead of 1 before enabling vr because otherwise cardboard wasn't showing stereoscopic . I use the waitfornextframe instead of null but I didn't know about the difference between the two. I got the switching working as well, and seems to work nicely apart from the log bring spammed with opengl errors . By the way, you could also put the equals check in a waituntil https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/WaitUntil.html\nMakes the code just a bit shorter, but yeah, actually waiting for it also seems like a good idea . I don't think this is related to GoogleVR. Try right click on the Google.ProtoclBuffers.dll and clicking reimport. We don't have that issue, we're currently on 5.6.0f1 but I think we implemented that on 5.6.0b11 and didn't have any issues.. Is this the same issue as #521 ?. Have you tried setting Camera.stereoEnabled to false? https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Camera-stereoEnabled.html. I think they added native iOS vr support in unity, this means you have to use VRSettings.enabled. You might still be able to use the GvrHead script. See #558. Right click on the Google.ProtocolBuffers dll in the plugins folder and click reimport. That should fix it, a restart of unity might also help.. Nowadays you do it through unity: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/VR.VRSettings-enabled.html\nMay also be a good idea to read this thread #492. I have used it with Gvr 1.40 on unity 5.6, be sure to add the extra framed of delay. . you might have to load the None vr sdk, see #492 for examples. Does the logcat say anything interesting?. Do you mean the Unity build log or the Android logcat when running your app? . Youre not giving us much information to work with. Could you post the full errors you are getting?. Did you switch to Android in the build settings?. Do you want to load fbx files on runtime?. There is no way to load an fbx on runtime natively in unity, you will have to create a loader yourself. Obj might be an easier filetype to load\nEdit:\nSorry, didnt read it correctly, loading a mesh from the resources folder should work just fine\nuntested code:\nvar go = new GameObject(\"mesh\");\ngo.AddComponent<MeshFilter>().mesh = Resources.Load<Mesh>(filepath);\ngo.AddComponent<MeshRenderer>(). You will have to either load it through assetbundles or make your own importer, but this is totally unrelated to googlevr, the unity forums might be a better place to ask. did you setup the right viewer with a qr code?. The head tracking is now baked into the unity engine.. See #532 . These topics have been heavily discussed here see for example #640 . Have you tried different phones, might be your gyro being broken. It isn't missing, there is now native support for cardboard and daydream in unity (since 5.6). You could also create 2 cameras, one for the left eye, and one for the right. See https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Camera-stereoTargetEye.html (which can be set in the inspector).. Add another camera, and set the left and right eye field accordingly. Then use camera culling mask to only show something for 1 eye.. Do you set the rotation every frame?. @aAAC please create your own issue, and a logcat might be useful . I have the same issue\nEdit:\nUnity 2017.2.0p1 seems to fix this issue. I was also trying unity 2017.2.0f3. see #748\nUpdating to 2017.2.0p1 fixes this issue. But just to confirm, there's no daydream integration for google sign in, also not for native applications? . This was because i disabled the component because of other issues I had with execution order. I would love some more documentation on the usage of the keyboard.. Created pr #814 . I signed it!. Signed it now with the correct email. This seems to be because I was calling gvrKeyboard.ClearText(); while gvrKeyboard.IsReady was false. \nStill, it should not crash the entire application.. Also, be sure to cache the Camera.main because every time you call it the code behind the property does a GameObject.FindWithTag(\"Main Camera\"); which isn't cheap.. We seem to have this issue when were trying to apply post processing effects. You can use the controller emulator app for that.\nhttps://developers.google.com/vr/daydream/controller-emulator. Check https://developers.google.com/vr/develop/unity/guides/magic-window. The GoogleVR package comes with Instant Preview. Have you authorized your pc on your phone? Try adb devices in the command line, do you see your phone there?. Have you tried a different usb cable?. Check the PermissionsDemo scene, that might be what you're looking for. Any updates about this issue?. ~~So just removing the z offset (that's still there from old sdk setup) is the expected way to set up the camera?~~ (we dont have an offset on the camera)\nIt's not that I want to get the neck offset, it's that it's incorrect on device. We tested this by just Debug.Log() the camera position.. We don't want to get any position or offset but we noticed that the main camera always has an offset of 0.08. I assumed it had something to do with the neck model not being applied correctly but that's just a guess. We parented the camera to a player object. We move that player object around but because of the 8cm offset, we don't place them exactly where they should be. . Thanks, that was the answer I was looking for.. Did you add the correct scene to the build settings?. Try resetting the aspect ratio of the camera manually (https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Camera.ResetAspect.html). Maybe this is related to #831 . Found using:\n\nGoogle VR SDK version: 1.110.0\nUnity version: 2017.2.0p1\nPhone manufacturer, model, and O/S version: Lenovo Mirage\nViewer manufacturer & model: Lenovo Mirage\n\nNot sure how to actually reproduce it. I tried another unity app from the store that didnt support 6dof, for which the forcing 6dof did work. But since i dont touch the camera transform, i dont think its on our side.. After extensive testing, I found out that the Daydream Keyboard was breaking 6DOF. As soon as that is initialized, 6DOF doesn't work in any scenes. The issue also exists in the KeyboardDemo scene from the package.. Reading the release notes i now see that v1.130.0 already has a fix for this. This might have something to do with gyros not being perfect on mobile devices thus the view drifting over time.. That looks like distortion that doesnt work correctly, what viewer are you using?. I have not has this experience when i tried it half a year ago, for me it worked like you would expect. It doesn't work and I honestly don't expect it to work (although would be a nice alternative for people without a daydream device). My main issue is that if I accidentally do have the instant preview enabled that I need to reboot the device if I want to use it again. . Thanks, will try! . I personally had to remove the android:banner=\"@drawable/app_banner\" line from the manifest to make it work.. @rusmaxham This is with unity 2017.2.0p1, I can't easily check with the current project on 2017.3 since that would probably require some updating of our code base. @rusmaxham This is the full output we get if I add the line to the manifest:\nError output\n```\nCommandInvokationFailure:

You can use \ncsharp\nGvrControllerInput.GetDevice(GvrControllerHand.Dominant).GetButtonDown(GvrControllerButton.TouchPadButton); \nto get the touchpad click state. There is also a GetButtonUp and GetButton. You can use GvrControllerButton.TouchPadTouch to get just the touch. These functions work just like the unity Input.GetKey* functions.. Can't you just do a normal raycast from the controller? . Those methods are for the ui system.. It might also be handy to add the full stacktrace. You could put the camera in a parent gameobject and move the parent a percentage of the movement of the camera. It shouldn't accumulate if you're using the local position of the camera. You need to make sure to have the sdk platform-tools in your PATH.\nhttps://www.xda-developers.com/adb-fastboot-any-directory-windows-linux/. Could you also try adding it to the System variables PATH variable?. In the last image in your last reply there are 2 boxes, the top one is for the user variables and the bottom one for the system variables. Try finding the PATH variable in the second box (and if it doesn't exist, create it) and add the path to the platform tools there.. For UI interaction, you can make it work for your own controllers. \nFor example:\n``` csharp\n    public class UIPointer : GvrLaserPointer\n    {\n        public Hand hand;\n    public override bool TriggerDown => InputManager.Get(hand)?.touchpad.click.down ?? false;\n    public override bool Triggering => InputManager.Get(hand)?.touchpad.click.isPressed ?? false;\n    public override bool TriggerUp => InputManager.Get(hand)?.touchpad.click.up ?? false;\n\n    public override bool TouchDown => InputManager.Get(hand)?.touchpad.touch.down ?? false;\n    public override bool IsTouching => InputManager.Get(hand)?.touchpad.touch.isPressed ?? false;\n    public override bool TouchUp => InputManager.Get(hand)?.touchpad.touch.up ?? false;\n    public override Vector2 TouchPos => InputManager.Get(hand)?.touchpad.touchPosition ?? Vector2.zero;\n\n    private bool wasAvailable;\n\n    protected override void Update()\n    {\n        base.Update();\n        bool available = InputManager.Get(hand).available;\n        if (!wasAvailable && available)\n        {\n            GvrPointerInputModule.Pointer = this;\n            Debug.Log(GvrPointerInputModule.Pointer.transform.parent.name);\n        }\n\n        wasAvailable = available;\n    }\n}\n\n. Yes, it's almost the same as normal daydream development. This is what we use to check if the controller is connected:csharp\n        private GvrControllerInputDevice gvrDevice;\n    public override bool available\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            return gvrDevice.State == GvrConnectionState.Connected;\n        }\n    }\n\n```. When playing in editor, you wont see the keyboard but you can just type with your physical keyboard .. Did you have vr enabled when you didn't have the GVR package added when profiling?. Then that's where the spikes are coming from. VR is quite demanding on the device, especially on the GPU.. ",
    "Marchelune": "I also run into this with SDK 1.4 on Unity 5.6.1f1 when the first device listed in the \"Virtual Reality SDKs\" settings is None.\nIt seems that it comes from the Handedness property, which calls VRDevice.GetNativePtr() but I guess it returns IntPtr.Zero with the None VRDevice. \nAnd it is called after each end of frame in the GvrController, thus the debug flooding. \nShould we manually deactivate the GvrController in such case ?. Right, sorry, Unity 5.6.1f1. For those running in the same issue, it should be solved in 1.60 : https://developers.google.com/vr/unity/release-notes#fixes. @reed-alpert I know how the VR icon works, my problem is more about the format : Clients send us the two layers in a 512x512 format, as specified in the doc, yet what is displayed in the tiles in the image above is not the whole 512x512 file (seems more like 256x512, see the HBO icon for instance). If you provide Unity with a 512x512, it will appear cut in half here. \n. Couldn't we at least have some help to set up dependencies ourselves ? Like it is done for Firebase ? https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup#frameworks. This is basically a blocker for deploying Google VR apps to iOS platforms in production.. So according to the comment on https://feedback.unity3d.com/suggestions/cocoapod-support-dependency-management , cocoapod support has recently been added to unity cloud build \ud83c\udf89  !. @dustinkerstein working on same issues here, although not with Input.gyro : have you tried InputTracking.GetLocalRotation(VRNode.Head) ? (still a bit jittering tho). @dustinkerstein yes, with VRSettings.enabled equals false. ",
    "Flameshot": "Any solution for this? I have Unity 2017 with last unity gvr sdk 1.70. I export the project in android studio and then build with it. But when the app starts on device I have this error \"Null GVR context pointer, could not get GVR user prefs' handedness\". @fredsa Hello and thanks for answering. \nI'm using Unity 2017.1.0f3. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S4 with Android 5.0.1 as a device and a Cardboard. \nI want to mention that if I build and run on device the \"VideoDemo\" scene it works. The thing is I am using some custom things and I need first to export in android studio. Before having the \"Null GVR context pointer\" error I have this error when it tries to load the video \"file is compressed, not supported\" and for the codec video I use VP8 and H264. \nI think I have this problems because of AndroidManifests merging and android studio is not adding the cardboard manifest? I don't know really.\nAlso I am trying to make the video working with Unity Video Player. Should I use ExoPlayer from google vr SDK?. @fredsa  I forgot to mention that I am using Google Cardboard not Daydream. I don't know if I am asking it right but, does the GVR video player texture works on IOS? I made a scene with a 360 video but it seems that it is not rendered when I switch to that scene. It is just black screen.\nI'm using the last release 2017.2.0p4 . Or anyone knows a hackfix to make that 360 video works with GVR on IOS?\n. Fixed it by adding compile(name: 'gvr-exoplayersupport-release', ext: 'aar') in build.gradle dependencies.. @rusmaxham  Unity 2017.1.0f3. @rusmaxham  It worked. You are awesome.\nI am testing something and if everything is right you can close this ticket. I will reply here as soon as possible.. ",
    "lachlansleight": "I am most definitely still having this problem in Unity 5.6.1f1, specifically when switching back and forth between VR mode on and off a couple of times. Still testing.\nEDIT:\nAfter some more testing, here are my findings:\nOn a non-daydream device (Galaxy S7 Edge), and only when I do not have daydream included in the list of VR devices (i.e. only \"None\" and \"Cardboard\"), I am able to swap in and out of VR mode many times (read: I tried it like 10 times and it didn't break) without crashing, although I do get the constant \"GL_INVALID_VALUE: Numeric argument out of range\" errors getting dumped to the console.\nWhen daydream is included in the project settings, I get \"Error Enabling Async Projection. Aborting load operation etc. etc.\" every time and can never successfully enter VR mode (it just opens my VR scene in 2D mode)\nOn my Pixel XL, when I do not have cardboard included in the list of VR devices (i.e. only \"None\" and \"Daydream\", I'm able to enter VR mode sometimes once, sometimes twice, but always I will eventually get the dreaded \"Numeric argument out of range\" which is always followed by a crash.\nTo clarify, this is the function I'm using to switch devices (with VRDeviceName being either \"cardboard\" or \"daydream\" depending on whether I'm running in cardboard or daydream mode. I replace VRDeviceName with new string[] {\"daydream\", \"cardboard\"} in the case of including both daydream and cardboard in the player settings):\nVRSettings.LoadDeviceByName(VRDeviceName);\nyield return null;\nif(!VRSettings.loadedDeviceName.Equals(VRDeviceName)) {\n    Debug.Log(\"Waiting an extra frame to set VR device to \" + VRDeviceName);\n    yield return null;\n}\nVRSettings.enabled = true;\nif(!VRSettings.enabled) {\n    Debug.Log(\"Waiting an extra frame to enable VRSettings\");\n    yield return null;\n}\n. I have this problem, and have done a bunch of research to try and isolate - here's what I've found:\nThere are three broad cases - including both daydream and cardboard as VR devices in PlayerSettings, including only daydream, or including only cardboard.\n\nIncluding both results in a total failure to enable VR mode on cardboard devices, and results in the below list of errors on daydream devices. \nIncluding only cardboard works on cardboard devices (although it does spam GL_INVALID_VALUE errors to logcat each frame), and results in the 'incompatible app' error on daydream devices (which 99% of users will fail to get past since it's required every time)\nIncluding only daydream results in the below list of errors on daydream devices, and bars cardboard devices from entering VR mode\n\n\nThe errors\nCreating an empty Unity project and building four scenes recreates the problem.\nScene 1 is a 2D scene with a button to launch in VR.

    "Mozis": "These might be two different problems.\nI had a shake when I was using unity's graphics raycaster instead of gvr raycaster on my canvas. Such shake can be removed by commenting out a line \"pointer.OnPointerEnter(...)\" in GvrPointerInputModule > UpdateReticle() method (around line 300).\nBUT as much as I want the default raycaster, just commenting that out is not efficient. Having no gvr raycaster creates a new placeholder ray every single frame ( look at GetLastRay() method in GvrPointerInputModule).\nAnd another shake was from RETICLE_DISTANCE_MAX in GvrReticlePointerImpl.cs being too much. Using gvr raycaster or commenting out that line I mentioned does not help in this case. You just need lower distance. I had shakes with value 10f. Setting it to 1f removed the problem.. I totally would try that, but it would take too much time, I think. I don't remember the setup that caused the problem for me. I got it fixed and moved on.\nMaybe someone else can try the new version out.. ",
    "dsternfeld7": "Thanks for the report! Are you still able to reproduce this issue in the 1.100 version of the SDK? If so, can you provide steps to reproduce the issue in an empty scene?. Closing this because DaydreamLabsControllerPlayground is deprecated.. Thank you for the report! I am not able to reproduce this issue in GVR SDK 1.100.1\nIf you are still seeing this in the latest SDK, please feel free to open a new issue with details about how to reproduce the bug and I will investigate.\nThanks,\nDan. I believe this is related to the RaycastMode set on the GvrPointerPhysicsRaycaster you are using.\npublic enum RaycastMode {\n    /// Default method for casting ray.\n    /// Casts a ray from the camera through the target of the pointer.\n    /// This is ideal for reticles that are always rendered on top.\n    /// The object that is selected will always be the object that appears\n    /// underneath the reticle from the perspective of the camera.\n    /// This also prevents the reticle from appearing to \"jump\" when it starts/stops hitting an object.\n    ///\n    /// Note: This will prevent the user from pointing around an object to hit something that is out of sight.\n    /// This isn't a problem in a typical use case.\n    Camera,\n    /// Cast a ray directly from the pointer origin.\n    /// This is ideal for full-length laser pointers.\n    Direct\n  }\nIt looks like you extended the laser to be as long as the reticle, in which case it is recommended to use the Direct raycast mode. Additionally, if you use Direct raycast mode you should change the RenderQueue of the Reticle material so that it doesn't always render on top.\nIn Camera raycast mode this can happen if you have a long laser and are pointing at something that is close to you because the laser will be intersecting the planet but the reticle will not from the perspective of the camera.. We do not officially support this feature. You can implement this yourself in the latest SDK by making a subclass of GvrBasePointer and overriding Triggering and TriggerDown to handle the timer.\nThanks,\nDan. By Gamepad button clicked are you referring to the ClickButton on the Daydream Controller?\nHere is a link to the documentation for the ClickButton.\nAlso, when using \"GvrPointerInputModule\" you can implements the IPointerClickHandler on an object to receive an event when the the click button is clicked while pointing at the object.. Closing. If you would like help with this in the future please feel free to open a new issue.. The battery indicator should work if you use Unity 5.6.2f1.\nAdditionally, in the next release of the GVR SDK the battery indicator will be hidden if the battery state is unavailable instead of showing a question mark.\nThanks,\nDan. I misspoke. This is actually fixed in Unity 5.6.2p1, which can be downloaded here: https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/patch-releases. If you are looking at GvrDemo in the latest version of the SDK, here is some information that may help you:\nThe scene includes both the prefab GvrContrllerPointer (Daydream Controller) and GvrReticlePointer (Cardboard Reticle). The script DemoInputManager is used to automatically switch which one is active based on which Virtual Reality SDK is being used according to Unity's Player Settings: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/VROverview.html\nThanks,\nDan. Closing. Please feel free to open a new issue if you would like additional help with this problem.\nThanks,\nDan. What version of the SDK are you using? If 1.7, What is the raycast mode set to on the GvrLaserPointer script?\nThe 1.7 SDK made some changes to the structure of the GvrControllerPointer prefab, if you've modified that prefab based on a previous version of the SDK, that could cause this problem.. Thanks, have you set the demo to Cardboard mode or Daydream mode?. Select GvrReticlePointer and change the RaycastMode to Camera in the inspector, that should fix it. Thanks for pointing out this bug!. This error is happening on the cardboard reticle (GvrReticlePointer), not the controller (GvrControllerPointer). Do you have the demo set to use the the cardboard reticle or the daydream controller?\nThanks,\nDan. Try looking for it under Player->MainCamera->GvrReticlePointer, or in the search bar type \"t:GvrReticlePointer\".\nIn the stock demo of 1.7.0, there should be both of the following:\nPlayer->MainCamera->GvrReticlePointer\nPlayer->GvrControllerPointer->Laser->Reticle\nDemoInputManager automatically switches between using GvrReticlePointer (gaze-based cardboard reticle) and GvrControllerPointer (Daydream controller) based on what you have set in the \"Virtual Reality SDKs\" player settings.. The file GvrTooltips.cs was removed in the 1.20 version of the SDK (Replaced by GvrTooltip.cs). I recommend deleting the previous package before importing the new one to prevent issues like this when files have been removed from the SDK.. Additionally, you can render stereo images using a shader to control what texture is used for each eye. An example of this can be found in the Media App Template here. Addressed in v1.100.0 . In version 1.70, the functionality of GvrReticlePointerImpl and GvrLaserPointerImpl was merged into GvrReticlePointer and GvrLaserPointer respectively.\nWe will look into the issue with the documentation.\nThank you!\n-Dan. Documentation has been updated.\nThanks!. I would recommend that instead of starting with the video controls included in the SDK, that you use the Media App Template (https://developers.google.com/vr/unity/media-app-template) as your starting point.\nThe video controls included in the SDK is meant to simply be a basic example of how to play video, but the Media App template is mean to demonstrate best practices for the UX of playing videos. It includes playback controls that should be easier for you to modify and extend.\n. This is intentional. GvrPointerPhysicsRaycaster and GvrPointerGraphicRaycaster shoot a raycast from a pointer (Anything that inherits from GvrBasePointer). If a pointer is disabled, then raycasting is disabled. GvrReticlePointer (cardboard reticle) and GvrControllerPointer (daydream controller) are the two pointer implementations that come with the SDK. \nIf you desire to have Raycasting enabled with the reticle hidden, you can disable just the MeshRenderer component.. Thank you, this will be addressed.. Can you post what the transform properties are on the object GvrControllerPointer->Laser ?\n\nAs you can see in the above photo, the position and orientation of the laser relative to the controller is determined by the properties on the transform. It is oriented 15 degrees downward so that it is ergonomically comfortable for user's to point, otherwise the user's may experience wrist strain when pointing at objects (especially when pointing downwards).\nEdit: It is worth noting that the 15 degree downward orientation is a design requirement for Daydream applications when interacting with UI.. Ya, the laser is positioned forward so that it is at the front of the controller.\nIf you reset the rotation to 0,0,0 then your app will not pass the \"Lower the laser ray an additional 15\u00b0\" design requirement and will be rejected from the play store. I strongly recommend that you keep the default values for the transform.. Based on your initial images, are you sure that the laser is actual offset to the left or does it simply look that way because of the perspective that you are observing the controller from? Have you observed the laser orientation on-device as well?. The default values in the prefab are in the image I posted above. If they are different for you, you may have applied changes to the prefab in the SDK.. Can you send an image of all settings you have set on GvrLaserVisual?. I don't see anything wrong in the inspector, if you can send me a simple project that re-produces the issue I'll take a look.. No problem!\nDo you have any updates on this issue from your end? If not, I will close the issue.\nThanks,\nDan. Closing this issue. Please feel free to open a new issue on this topic if you need help with it in the future!\nThanks,\nDan. Thanks for the report!\nThis issue is specific to Unity 2017.2 and cannot be fixed in the GVR SDK for Unity. There are more details in this forum post here.. Hey there! I just tried reproducing this issue and wasn't able to. Would you be be able to provide more detail about how to reproduce it?\nAlso, I recommend against using Unity 2017.2.0f3 for Daydream development. Please see the thread here for more details.\nThanks,\nDan. Do these errors happen when you hit play? or just when the editor is open?\nCan you click on the \"Object reference not set to an instance of an object\" error and copy and paste the full stack trace into this issue?\nThanks,\nDan. What platform is your build target set to?. Thanks!\nWhen you click on an error in the Console, a window at the bottom of the Console displays more details about that error. Shown in the image below:\n\nCan you copy and paste the full detailed information about both errors into this issue?\nThanks,\nDan\n. I have a suspicion about what is going on - try making sure that your filepath's for both the Unity installation and your project do not contain any spaces or apostrophes.. Thank you! Some errors don't have more detailed information, so what you sent me is correct. Please let me know what happens when you try changing the filepath's for the Unity installation and the project!\nThanks,\nDan. Great! I'm glad it's working for you now! Closing this issue.. I believe it needs to be \"file://\" + \"full path to the file\".\nThe Media App Template uses the Gvr Video Plugin to play videos located in external storage, so I would recommend looking at that as an example.\nHere is one of the most relevant files.\nThanks,\nDan. First, make sure you have an instance of the ObjectPoolManager script in your scene.\nThen, you can create a script that has a serialized reference to the enemy prefab and provides a getter for accessing the pool like below.\n```\npublic GameObjectPool EnemyPool {\n  get {\n    // Get the pool manager.\n    ObjectPoolManager poolManager = ObjectPoolManager.Instance;\n    Assert.IsNotNull(poolManager);\n// Get the pool and return it if it already exists.\nstring poolName = enemyPrefab.name;\nGameObjectPool pool =\n  poolManager.GetPool<GameObjectPool>(poolName);\n\nif (pool != null) {\n  return pool;\n}\n\n// Create the pool if it doesn't exist yet.\npool = new GameObjectPool(pagePrefab, capacity, preAllocateAmount);\npoolManager.AddPool(poolName, pool);\n\nreturn pool;\n\n}\n}\n```\nNext, you can get an enemy from the pool like this:\nGameObject enemy = EnemyPool.Borrow();\nFinally, you can return an enemy to the pool like this:\nEnemyPool.Return(enemy);\nPlease let me know if that helps! I'm happy to answer additional questions.\nThanks,\nDan. Here is an example of the ObjectPoolManager being used in the ScrollingUIDemo for an example of paginated scrolling that uses pooled pages.\nThanks,\nDan. If the pool is currently empty, then each time Borrow is called a new instance will be allocated. It's pivotal that when an enemy is removed if is returned to the pool instead of being Destroyed so that it can be re-used.\nYou'll want to make sure to set the capacity of the pool to a reasonable number based on the number of enemies you need to have borrowed from the pool at one time. Optionally, you can also have the pool preAllocate enemies when the pool is created instead of having them be lazily instantiated when they are requested.\nWikipedia has some more general information about the Object Pool design pattern that you may find useful.. What did you pass in as the capacity and preAllocateAmount? Can you share your code with me?\nAfter you borrow from the pool, you'll want to change the parent of the returned object to whatever is appropriate for your application.. Additionally, it would also be helpful if you can share an image of what your scene hierarchy looks like after you've created the pool and called borrow.. How many times have you called EnemyPool2.Borrow()?\nWhen you borrow an object from the pool, it doesn't automatically change it's parent. You must do that yourself, so unless you change the parent of the borrowed enemy it will still look like it is underneath the pool in the scene hierarchy.\nI noticed that there are only four enemies underneath Enemy Pool in the hierarchy, it looks like one of them was re-parented after you borrowed it, but none of the others. It looks to me like what's happening is this:\n\nCreate the pool with a capacity of five and five pre-allocated enemies.\nOne enemy is borrowed, and re-parented.\nFour more enemies are borrowed, but not re-parented. Therefore, in the hierarchy they still look like they are part of the pool.\nMore enemies are borrowed, but now the pool is considered empty, which means that the pool has to allocate new enemies to meet the demand.\n\nAlso, it looks like you're going to want your pool's capacity to be larger than five. That number should be tuned to be a little bit larger than the number of enemies you expect to borrow from the pool based on the design of your game.. Since I saw that the issue is closed, I hope that you got it working and that that this is resolved for you! Please let us know if you need more assistance.\nThanks,\nDan. If you send me a simple project that reproduces the issue I would be happy to look at it.\nThanks,\nDan. Here is some example code I just tested:\n```\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\npublic class PoolTest : MonoBehaviour {\npublic GameObject testObjectOne;\n  public GameObject testObjectTwo;\npublic GameObjectPool TestPool1 {\n    get {\n      // Get the pool manager.\n      ObjectPoolManager poolManager = ObjectPoolManager.Instance;\n  // Get the pool and return it if it already exists.\n  string poolName = testObjectOne.name;\n  GameObjectPool pool =\n    poolManager.GetPool<GameObjectPool>(poolName);\n\n  if (pool != null) {\n    return pool;\n  }\n\n  // Create the pool if it doesn't exist yet.\n  pool = new GameObjectPool(testObjectOne, 5, 5);\n  poolManager.AddPool(poolName, pool);\n\n  return pool;\n}\n\n}\npublic GameObjectPool TestPool2 {\n    get {\n      // Get the pool manager.\n      ObjectPoolManager poolManager = ObjectPoolManager.Instance;\n  // Get the pool and return it if it already exists.\n  string poolName = testObjectTwo.name;\n  GameObjectPool pool =\n    poolManager.GetPool<GameObjectPool>(poolName);\n\n  if (pool != null) {\n    return pool;\n  }\n\n  // Create the pool if it doesn't exist yet.\n  pool = new GameObjectPool(testObjectTwo, 5, 5);\n  poolManager.AddPool(poolName, pool);\n\n  return pool;\n}\n\n}\nvoid Awake() {\n    // Borrow 10 objects from the pool.\n    // The pool only preallocated five, so it will first borrow the five\n    // and then allocate five more to meet the demand.\n    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n      GameObject testObj = TestPool1.Borrow();\n      testObj.name = testObj.name + \" \" + (i + 1);\n      testObj.transform.SetParent(null);\n    }\n// Borow two from the second pool.\nGameObject obj1 = TestPool2.Borrow();\nobj1.name = obj1.name + \" 1\";\nobj1.transform.SetParent(null);\n\nGameObject obj2 = TestPool2.Borrow();\nobj2.name = obj2.name + \" 2\";\nobj2.transform.SetParent(null);\n\n// Return just one to the second pool.\nTestPool2.Return(obj2);\n\n}\n}\n```\nResults:\n\n. Good question!\nThe reticle will expand if the object it is pointing at is considered \"interactive\". You can see the implementation in the function SetPointerTarget of GvrReticlePointer.\nSo what makes something considered interactive?\nAn object is considered interactive if it implements the IPointerClickHandler, IPointerDownHandler, or IPointerDragHandler event system handlers. Alternatively, you can add the Unity script EventTrigger (which implements these interfaces) to the object. This indicates that the object will respond to pointer input. This is part of Unity's API for responding to events from the Event System.\nThanks,\nDan\n. Yes, on GvrReticlePointer you can change the property maxReticleDistance (assuming you are using the 1.100 version of the SDK).\nThanks,\nDan. Can you post an image of what your \"Virtual Reality Supported\" Player settings look like for Android?\nThanks,\nDan. Thanks, I don't see any issues there. Can you connect your device to your computer and post the output of the command 'adb logcat' that occurs when launching the application?\nThanks,\nDan. Thanks! I'd also like to see the output that occurs just as the app first launches. This is how I suggest you get it:\n\nRight before launching the app, run the command 'adb logcat -c' this clears the log.\nRun 'adb logcat' to start printing the output.\nLaunch the app.\nCopy and paste everything from the start of running 'adb logcat' up until the point where you see the above errors in the log.. Thanks!\n\nI believe this issue is occurring because the SDK no longer supports phones with x86 architecture. Do you still see this issue if you use the 1.40 version of the SDK?. To solve this, do the following:\n\nCreate a GameObject named 'Player'.\nMove your camera underneath the 'Player' object and set it's position to (0,0,0).\nPosition the 'Player' object to where you would like the camera to be.\n\nGvrEditorEmulator will override the position of the camera to emulate the Daydream Neck Model which offsets the position of the camera based on the camera's orientation so that the camera pivots around an approximated neck instead of the center of the eyes.\nAlso, GvrEditorEmulator does not need to be a child of your camera. It automatically controls the pose of all stereoscopic cameras in the scene regardless of where it is located in the scene hierarchy.\nThanks,\nDan. Holding shift and moving the mouse is for changing the orientation of the controller. Instead, hold alt and move the mouse to change the orientation of the camera.\nThe controls for moving the camera in the editor are visible in the inspector when selecting the prefab GvrEditorEmulator. For the controller editor controls, you can look at the prefab GvrControllerMain.\nThanks,\nDan. 1. You can use the property GvrReticlePointer. CurrentRaycastResult to get the latest hit information from the reticle. You can also subscribe to events using Unity's pointer handlers. \n2. The screen position of the reticle is always the center of the screen, and you can use GvrReticlePointer.ReticleOuterDiameter to determine the diameter of the reticle when it is expanded. the ReticleOuterDiameter will change to match the current diameter of the reticle..

    "dustinkerstein": "Just an FYI - I've opened up a new issue (see #703) to discuss the overall UX for handling Daydream + Cardboard + Magic Window in a single app.. I have the same performance issues when I enable VSync in the Unity quality settings. The only difference is that instead of the small 59.98-60fps fluctuations, GvrFPS displays a rock solid 60fps even though the rendering is definitely much lower than that.. Ok good to know. \nMy perf issue turned out to be due to a plugin that wasn't fully threaded. Still strange to me that the FPS indicators weren't showing it, but I'll let that slide for now. \nThanks for the info.. @jplongo This sounds a bit like #766 though I didn't think it existed in 2017.1.1.x but I've since moved up to 2017.1.2.x and haven't tested the latest VR Services versions with that version of Unity - Which Google VR Services version are you on? Have you tried other/older versions? If not, you might also want to try disabling \"Enable GVR Library Loading\" in the Developer Settings for Daydream. . Ok. Have you tried Unity 2017.1.2p2 yet?. @jplongo Do you see any errors in logcat? Is this in iOS or Android?. @jplongo it's tough to say. It sounds like it could be something in your particular implementation. Have you tried building a clean project that just toggles VR mode? . @jplongo Yeah, depending on how you implemented those buttons, they may not be functional in VR mode. I use world space objects that function as buttons and raycast them on touch, but even that doesn't work on Android if the \"daydream\" VR device is loaded. You really shouldn't be relying on touch in VR mode though. To toggle VR mode why don't you just rely on the top left \"X\" button to exit VR mode, and then you can use your custom button to enable VR mode. That's how most cardboard applications function. Here's what that looks like in code:\nif (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Escape)) {\n     YourDisableVRMethod ();\n}. Any updates on this? It's definitely a blocker for using 2017.1.0f3 on iOS. \nTested on GVRSDK 1.6 and 1.8 on iOS.\nThis seems like it's either more of a Unity bug or possibly the GVR iOS SDK bug rather than GVR Unity SDK, right?. @SamtheSpartan, can you post the Unity forum bug link here? Thanks.. FYI - There definitely is an issue with Single Pass Rendering + GVR on Android Mali devices. I just posted a new issue specifically for that - #709\nThis current thread's issue (also cross listed in the GVR iOS SDK repo) is more specifically about the iOS issue.. @SamtheSpartan I haven't found any workarounds yet and there doesn't seem to be anyone working on it... I'm currently just planning on shipping with a warning (informing users how to get VR working) during the splash screen on iOS for the time being. Bad UX, but I really don't have any choice at the moment.. Yah, I'm actually loading iOS with the \"None\" device first, showing the warning splash text, and then letting users switch into VR mode when they explicitly choose to.. Do you happen to know if it's in the 2017 beta release yet?. And is also still reproducible on Unity 2017.1.1p3 - This is a breaking bug for me as well. Any update would be appreciated.. @fredsa It say's it's fixed in a future release but it's remained broken in the subsequent 2017.3 beta, 2017.2 RC, 2017.1 patch releases that are dated after it being marked as fixed. Should we just wait one more round of releases, or should we try to reach out to the folks on the Unity side to get more details?. FYI - Unity 2017.3.0b3 was just released today and does indeed fix this issue. Though I don't see it mentioned in the release notes. . Just wanted to check up on this issue as I'm getting more and more reports from users of this crash.\nThis is likely affecting the majority of S8 / S8+ / Note 8 users as those devices ship from the factory at FHD.\nI was thinking about pushing out an update to my app that warns these users and prevents VR mode, but since I have the \"daydream\" VR device as the first in the list (and needs to stay this way for Daydream approval), my app will crash immediately at launch since it loads in VR mode from the beginning.\nIf anyone has a workaround or insight as to when this might be fixed, I'd very much appreciate it.\n. Thank for the update @fredsa \nDo you happen to know if it's going to be a fix to VR services or Unity? Any ETA?\nAsking users to switch resolutions isn't really practical as I have no way to reach out to them, and in my case the application crashes immediately at launch so I can't warn them at all. . Just a quick note - I believe this bug will result in all Daydream Unity apps crashing on startup when set to FHD (the default resolution) on S8 / Note 8 devices, at least on the Unity / VR services versions where this bug exists. Please let me know if I can help at all. I'm happy to test any potential fixes or workarounds as this is a bit of a showstopper for me at the moment.. @fredsa I was able to directly test a Galaxy S8 via http://developer.samsung.com/remotetestlab and understand the behavior a bit more now. The crash won't happen for most Daydream apps as it appears to only happen when VR mode is toggled (VRSettings.enabled = false <-> true) but it will immediately crash under the exact same conditions as this #671 bug. The only difference is that VR device = \"daydream\". Should I still create a separate bug?\nAlso, please see the attached log for the crash - Crash.txt\nEffectively, all S8 / Note 8 devices will crash when toggling VR by default due to Samsung setting FHD at the factory. . Until this Galaxy S8 / S8+ / Note 8 showstopper is fixed, I'm going to warn these users with this condition: if (SystemInfo.deviceModel.Contains(\"G950\") || SystemInfo.deviceModel.Contains(\"G955\") || SystemInfo.deviceModel.Contains(\"N950\")) but I really would only like to warn users that are set to a resolution other than WQHD+. Has anyone figured out a way in Unity to detect when the device isn't in WQHD+ mode? \nIt seems like no matter what resolution is set (HD+, FHD+, WQHD+) all of these methods return the values corresponding to WQHD+\n\nScreen.dpi\nScreen.height\nScreen.width\nScreen.currentResolution\n\nAre there any other ways to possibly detect this condition?. Thanks @guneyozsan I will give that a shot.\nAlso, it's interesting to note that this crash does not happen on the Galaxy S7 / S7 Edge when set to HD, FHD (default in Nougat), or WQHD. The crash is specific to the taller screen (2960 pixels vs. 2560 pixels) of the S8 / Note 8 line of phones.. @guneyozsan I tried both GalaxyWorkaround.transform.localPosition and GalaxyWorkaround.pixelRect.width where GalaxyWorkaround is a Pixel Perfect Screen Space Overlay Canvas and I get the same results for all of the resolutions.. @guneyozsan I wasn't able to get that working as it seems to always return the reference size, not the current scaled size. Would you be able to send over a screenshot of your Canvas and CanvasScaler properties?. @guneyozsan Yeah, which in turn means that I won't be able to detect this condition and am forced to warn all S8 / S8+ / Note 8 users regardless of their selected resolution :(. Just wanted to check in to see if there was any ETA for this fix. Happy to help test any beta code or potential workarounds.. FYI, in case anyone was wondering about the newest Google VR Services update, it doesn't have any effect on this particular issue.. Just wanted to check in. Any news from the Samsung / Unity / GVR side of things?. @OmegaMule Nice! I just confirmed this is working correctly in 2017.1.2p1 for both FHD+ and WQHD+ resolutions. Toggling VR mode also works correctly.. @OmegaMule Can you post a screenshot of that? I haven't seen that when testing on the devices here - http://developer.samsung.com/remotetestlab/rtlDeviceList.action. @OmegaMule Interesting, I am not able to replicate that behavior with my app when testing on the Samsung Remote Device lab (which I believe are in fact real devices, not emulators or simulators). Is it possible to post your project online?. Bummer, it was a very nice feature. It seems like most games / 3D apps would benefit from this low-persistence mode. Thanks for the update though.. And further, I'm not quite sure I actually understand why I see this wobble effect in VR mode at all (though it is about 4x less severe compared to Magic Window mode). This VR mode wobble can easily be seen in any Daydream app when the phone is outside of the headset. Just give the phone a shake and you should see the black frames of the eye views wobble. Is this VR mode wobble by design? It just feels like the content being rendered inside of the eyes is 1 frame behind (or possibly more in Magic Window mode).. Ok. I'll try Magic Window without any VR device loaded - though if that is the best solution,  it may be worth asking the Unity folks to update their docs and also updating the GVR wiki as I believe both say you can use Magic Window by just setting VRSetting.enabled = false (see step 5 here - \nhttps://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/wiki/Switching-between-VR-and-non-VR-at-runtime and https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/VRDevices-GoogleVR.html)\nAlso, just due to my curiosity,  do you know where I can find an explanation of that VR mode wobble?. So I've spent some time with various gyro/accelerometer scripts (one even with sensor fusion) but the accuracy and latency isn't even close to the performance of the native GVR orientation tracking. While calling VRSettings.LoadDeviceByName(\"\") does solve the UX issues of the Daydream View interstitial (since it's no longer relying on GVR at all), it leaves me with a sub-par orientation tracking solution. \nIn my mind, GVR really does need to properly support both VR and Magic Window modes, and the UX transition between them. Cardboard is meant to be the \"bridge\" into VR for many consumers, and one of the primary ways developers are going to accomplish this is through a Magic Window <-> VR user experience. There are many ways this could be handled (exposing GVR sensor data even when a GVR device isn't loaded, allowing the developer to disable the Daydream View interstitial, etc.) but as of right now in Unity 2017.1.0f3 and GVR 1.7, it's impossible to build a single app that can seamlessly transition between VR and Magic Window modes for both Cardboard and Daydream headsets while maintaining good orientation tracking. This seems like what everyone should be striving to build: a single app experience that works with Daydream, Cardboard, and Magic Window. Right?\nMaybe I should create a new Github issue (closing #700, #701, and #702) that focuses on this particular UX. Does that sound like a good approach to discussing this?. K, I will do that now. \nYeah, that's a great resource, but IMO it would just be reinventing the wheel at this point. GVR has already essentially solved this problem. It's just not exposed in all cases where you want to use it.. Ok, I create #703 to track this UX discussion and closed the other two issues.\nHowever, I'd like to keep this issue open, as it does seem like there is a bug with Magic Window mode + Daydream device. I'll just try to keep the discussion focused on that particular issue now. Sorry about the tangents. \nUpdate - I did a little more testing of this wobble and it's maybe not as bad as I first though. I'm going to close this issue so we can focus on the UX mentioned above.. I'm going to create a new issue to track this asynchronous reprojection wobble specifically in VR mode.. Thanks, I'll give that a try. That very well could avoid all of the issues noted in #700, #701, and #702. The only downside is that I won't be able to use the exact Google VR tracking implementation which I feel is likely the best available.... Yah, I have a feeling like that may not end up working well enough due to this post - https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/using-google-vr-head-tracking-without-activating-vrmode.484467/ - I'll try to find a good gyro sensor fusion script, but if that doesn't work out, can you think of any other possible solutions? I'd really still much prefer to use the camera tracking from Google VR if possible.. Hey @fredsa , I'm actually looking for the loaded headset (VRDevice.model) rather than the loaded / supported VR devices. . Closing this issue in favor of tracking in #703 . It looks like VRDevice.model doesn't update when the user toggles between headsets using the VR services UX. You need to fully unload/reload the VRDevice itself, or restart the app. I tried waiting multiple frames with yield return null but it still doesn't return the current headset if it was changed during runtime. Do you feel like that's a bug? This would really be the only way I can effectively detect what headset a user has configured. \nIf this is indeed a valid bug, I'd be happy to edit the title of this one, or create a new issue.. Sure thing. I'd like to start in 2D, present the user a choice of whether to stay in 2D (but maintain gyro camera) or go into VR mode. Selecting VR works just fine and the transition screen is beneficial. But when I select 2D (which loads the \"cardboard\" device and sets VRSettings.enabled = false) I still get that transition screen. \nI just saw your comment on #701 recommending to just use the gyro data directly in Unity (and loading \"none\" device). That may indeed solve my problems here as well. I'll give that a try tonight. Thanks!. Closing this issue in favor of tracking in #703 . I can certainly do that, though I do feel like this is supposed to be a supported UX, but is blocked by various parts of the current design. Do you feel the above is not a supported UX?. Interesting. I thought it actually was a supported feature. IMO it needs to be. If here is not the right place, where would be the most appropriate place to actually request this? \nI truly believe it's crucial for developers building Daydream / Cardboard apps to have a seamless VR <-> Magic Window UX. And yes, while it can be made to work, there are either UX issues (unavoidable overlay when using the Daydream View headset in Magic Window mode) or sub-par orientation tracking (when not using GVR) that make it much less usable than it should be.. Thanks for the background. \n\nMagic Window doesn't require special VR features such as asynchronous reprojection, and can be implemented using a non-VR Unity camera, driven by Unity's Input.gyro. Stack Overflow is the best place to discuss and share opinions around implementation details and design goals.\n\nThat is entirely possible to do, but none of the Input.gyro scripts (ones I've written myself, found on the Unity forums, and even a sensor fusion one I've found on Google) come remotely close to the tracking accuracy and latency of the GVR head tracking system. It's just that much better. Rolling my own solution that's more closely on par with GVR honestly just feels like reinventing the wheel. That's why having access to the GVR head tracking system (as an opt-in feature) when the VR device isn't loaded would be extremely beneficial to people trying to tackle this same issue - which I guarantee there will be many of.. @Marchelune When you use VRNode.head you are in fact using the GVR tracking system, which is only available when a VRDevice is loaded (other than \"None\"). Jittering may just be due to your phone's actual sensors. You have a VRDevice loaded, correct?. FWIW, I'm going through the Daydream approval process right now and my app was initially rejected because I was allowing users Daydream View users to toggle into Magic Window mode. This apparently isn't allowed. So now, for users that have VRDevice.model == \"Google, Inc. - Daydream View\" I am disallowing the VR toggle and also instructing them, if they'd like to use Magic Window, to first switch to one of the \"Cardboard\" headsets in the VR settings, and then to quit and reopen the app (quitting is necessary due to bug #704). Given the above, it almost seems like the better approach is to create two separate apps (Daydream only / Cardboard and Magic Window), but I'm still trying to avoid that. The current situation just creates a very poor UX if the user, who has previously associated their phone to a Daydream View, wants to use the app in Magic Window mode. I'm asking them to jump through a few too many hoops.. @fredsa, yeah it's that requirement that they cited, and I do have Daydream listed first, then None, and finally Cardboard.\nUX-wise, I had a \"Toggle VR\" button that was visible to all users (Daydream view and others) which allowed switching back and forth. It was a relatively seamless transition, but it wasn't for accepting permissions, logging in, or any of the listed D9 use cases. I was just toggling Magic Window and VR. However, based on the D9 guidelines, I would have thought what I was doing should be allowed. What do you think? I'd be happy to share an APK if you'd like.\nRegarding knowing whether the app was launched from Daydream Home, do you know if this is currently possible to detect from within Unity directly, or possibly through a Java call?\n[Update] - I was also allowing the user to shake their phone to toggle VR. Though it did require a 2nd shake to double confirm. Here is what Google said:\n\n\"When in VR, your app should never display any 2D images. The app goes into 2D unexpectedly when you select the toggle vr button and when you shake the phone enough. For more information and examples, please see the Daydream App Quality Requirements.\"\n. The VR Toggle was in fact a diegetic button within the VR world. Sorry if that wasn't clear. Here's a screenshot of the VR UI:\n\n\nAnd Magic Window version:\n\nI do understand how the shake could have been an issue, but you would have to 1 - shake very hard with the headset on which is unlikely since it's uncomfortable, and 2 - Double confirm with a second shake after seeing a diegetic popup asking you to shake to confirm. \nRegardless of the shake, the Google employee did reference my VR toggle button as being part of the problem which I don't understand. I might try again but this time with a warning that pops up after clicking the VR toggle asking the user to remove their phone from the headset. That's where my UX differs from their hybrid UX demo - I just immediately toggled, which I still do feel is fine since it is an explicit user action to disable VR, but we'll see.... @fredsa, I just wanted to follow up on this specific question from above: \n\nRegarding knowing whether the app was launched from Daydream Home, do you know if this is currently possible to detect from within Unity directly, or possibly through a Java call?\n\nSince the VR device load order is fixed at build time, it doesn't seem like it would be possible to build a hybrid Daydream app with Unity. In order to successfully build a truly hybrid Daydream app, I'd need to be able to know where the application was launched from (Daydream Home, Chrome, Android Launcher etc.) and whether or not the previous app was in VR mode, and then decide which VR device to load. I feel like this is something that's likely possible with a native Java app, but not currently with Unity. Does that sound correct?\n. Awesome! I will give that a shot. Thanks.. @fredsa That definitely helps, but I still run into that other issue where the Daydream View interstitial is shown when I load the \"daydream\" or \"cardboard\" device with VRSettings.enabled = false. So it seems like it's possible to create that hybrid Daydream UX in Unity, but only if you're not using Magic Window mode. . Yeah, I'm specifically trying to address users who have Daydream phones paired with Daydream View headsets. I'd like for those users to be able to launch the app in 2D Magic Window mode when they either don't have their headsets/controllers nearby, or just would prefer to use the app in 2D mode. The hybrid UX with Magic Window support isn't currently possible for these particular (and important) users.. What I'm looking to do just isn't possible if I want to utilize the GVR head tracking in the Magic Window mode. My choices are:\n\nDon't use the GVR head tracking for the 2D mode and implement my own gyro/accel tracking solution. This would allow me to create a true hybrid app that starts in 2D and can transition into VR for all headsets (including the Daydream View). However, the big downside is that the available tracking code I've found/written is far inferior to the GVR head tracking code. Some of the tracking code available works well on some devices, but not others (see my Twitter message - that was tested on a Moto Z), and also just isn't nearly as accurate or responsive as GVR tracking.\nIf I use the GVR head tracking (requires loading a VR device) I am stuck with a very poor user experience for folks who have Daydream phones + Daydream View headsets (as soon as the VR device is loaded the Daydream View interstitial pops up - even though I'm in 2D mode). There is no current way to build an app that starts in 2D mode for these particular users if I use the GVR head tracking. I'd love to be proven wrong though :)\n\nMy current ugly workaround (sort of a 2a) is to use GVR head tracking but force users who have Daydream View headsets configured to always launch into VR mode, and ask them politely to switch their headset setting and relaunch the app (due to  #704) if they'd like to use 2D mode. Though I really don't like this solution. It's a very bad UX for these important and valuable Daydream users.  . @nathanmartz Yeah, I'm just hoping that I, and maybe others, would be able make the case for the importance of well functioning hybrid VR / Magic Window UX that was able to fully utilize the remarkably good GVR tracking. There's just such a large gap between the performance and cross-device reliability between GVR tracking and DIY tracking that it's not even a question in my mind.\nSide note - I'd also love to be able to utilize the other GVR Daydream tech (asynchronous reprojection, low persistence mode, etc.) as options exposed in Magic Window mode on Daydream devices. Certainly that wouldn't make sense in all use-cases, but for some, they'd be extremely beneficial. . Just wanted to check in on this one.  Anything I can help with?. Ok, that's a good explanation, but how would you propose building any type of UI like a HUD / visor?. I guess it's a matter of \"just don't do it\"... Reading up on diegetic UX now.\nIt seems as though while objects attached to the camera may be bad practice in VR, Asynchronous Reprojection entirely precludes your ability to really even try it. Sound about right?. Thanks for the theoretical answer. I'll give that a try.\nAs you already noted by tagging this issue as a \"documentation bug\" - I definitely agree that it'd be a good idea to inform folks via the documentation that non-diegetic UI + Asynchronous Reprojection are essentially incompatible. I imagine this will come up again :). I'd even go further. With Asynchronous Reprojection, anything large like a HUD is going to be a broken wobbly mess :) . I was just playing around with the new GVR 1.7 Performance HUD and noticed that it is headlocked but doesn't conflict with the Asynchronous Reprojection (ie. it's 100% stable). Would it not just be a better solution to have the workaround you proposed above, or something effectively similar, actually just be implemented \"behind the scenes\" in Unity's native integration for all objects that are intended to be in sync with the camera? . I can also replicate this on Unity 2017.1.1p1 and GVR 1.7 using Application.Quit() when invoking my app via a deep link from Chrome.\nAnd when launching inside of the Daydream app (in VR mode) calling Application.Quit() will return back to the Daydream app in VR mode, and then automatically quit to the 2D Android home in about 3 seconds - This particular behavior was noted here - https://forum.unity.com/threads/daydreams-native-x-quit-button-doesnt-quit-the-application.442942/\n. So this doesn't actually appear to be related to Single Pass Rendering. It was actually caused by having Anti Aliasing disabled. Turning on 2x Multisampling entirely fixes this issue. Strange. Going to change the title to reflect his.. Ok cool. I just re-tested again and it doesn't seem related to AA. Not sure what was going on in my Unity project. I'll go ahead and rename this issue back to its original since you say it was indeed a bug with single pass rendering.. Upon a little more testing on a Samsung S6 and S8 (Mali version), this actually does seem to be related to both Single Pass Rendering and Anti Aliasing. If AA is disabled when Single Pass Rendering is enabled, these errors will appear and VR mode will be broken. Enabling AA prevents this from happening.. @nathanmartz Do you know if this fix is going to be on the Unity side, or within Google VR Services?. @nathanmartz ok, so that means the fix will be in a future Unity release rather than Google VR Services, correct?. @nathanmartz Interesting. Will both the Unity fix and Google VR Services fix address the issue independently, or will it actually require both components in order to fix it at all?. Just gave it a quick test and it does indeed appear to be fixed in 2017.1.1p1. Ah ok. Sorry for the false alarm. I guess my friend with the Pixel was mistaken. . Note - This is only reproducible on Daydream compatible phones. . In case anyone wants to replicate this, here is a test project - https://www.dropbox.com/s/34z0gc5i6zxapy7/DaydreamCrash2017.1.2p2.zip?dl=0 - It is currently configured for 2017.1.2p2 so that you can see it working without issue. But once you upgrade to 2017.2.0f or 2017.3.0b you should be able to easily replicate.. Hey @rusmaxham, just wanted to check in on this one. Did it turn out to be a driver issue?. @rusmaxham Ok cool. I guess I'm just curious how it only affects 2017.2.0x / 2017.3.0x. Does that make sense if it's a driver issue?. Just checking in. Any updates on either the Unity or VR Services side of things? There are a few other fixes in 2017.2.0x / 2017.3.0x that I'd like to take advantage of, but I need to hold off until this issue is resolved.. I just confirmed this is fixed in the latest VR Services update. \nIt does appear that this update broke something on Unity 2017.1.2p4 when launching the the app with the Daydream View selected - When the app launches, both eyes stay 100% black. I tested Unity 2017.1.3p1 and this issue isn't present so I very quickly just pushed out an update to my app built with this newer Unity version. I'm not sure if this is more on the Unity side or VR Services. Let me know what you think and I'll post a separate issue.. It seems like the Unity 2017.3.1p1 release which fixes the black eye viewports issue has another, possibly bigger bug that affects all Cardboard devices:\nhttps://answers.unity.com/questions/1456999/google-vr-had-a-fatal-issue-while-loading.html \nhttps://fogbugz.unity3d.com/default.asp?990993_b5v2n79co80u7ia6 \nhttps://fogbugz.unity3d.com/default.asp?991127_jhl7ggsi3gon4ip4\nIf anyone has a workaround or knows of a release where both of these issues aren't replicable please let me know.\nUpdate - Cardboard devices appear to be broken in the same way in versions 2017.2.1p4 and 2017.1.3p1 but works in 2017.1.2p4 (and probably some other 3.x and 2.x but I haven't tested). Looking at the release notes of 1.3p1 it's looking like it could be the addition of the Google VR NDK v1.100. I understand that VR + orientation handling doesn't make much sense, but what about folks using \"magic window\" mode? In that case, various orientations might be unavoidable. I'm now running into this issue on iOS (GVR 170) and only 1 orientation works correctly - all others are flipped. Android doesn't seem to exhibit this behavior. Can you think of any potential workarounds?\nI could probably add 90, 180,270 for each of the 3 broken orientations (on iOS only), but I'd really prefer to avoid that ugly hack.. On Unity versions where this is visible I am able to fix the issue by disabling GVR SDK library loading in the Daydream developer tools.

W/GVR: [vr/gvr/render/scanline_racer.cc:1200] Missed vsync by 8752us (CPU load is too high). Quick update - Turning the screen off and then on when this issue occurs seems to fix it.\nAlso, I am not able to replicate this on 2017.2.1p2 - So even though disabling GVR Library Loading helps on versions that are affected, it doesn't seem like it's directly caused by the 1.80 -> 1.100 NDK upgrade that happened recently in Unity patch releases as 2017.3.1p1 (which also has NDK 1.100) doesn't exhibit this behavior. This is particularly useful info for me as I believe it's the only version I've tested so far that doesn't exhibit this black screen issue nor the broken Cardboard support - though I imagine there are other recent Unity versions that don't have these issues - I just haven't had a chance to test a lot of them.. @fredsa, do you have a direct link for  2017.1.3p2? It doesn't seem like that version is available yet. I only see 2017.1.3p1.. Ah, 3.1p2 not 1.3p2 - I will give it a try. However, as noted above, I was not able to reproduce this on Unity 2017.3.1p1 so I'm not sure what to make of that. Also, I can't use 2017.3.1p1 as it entirely breaks Cardboard support. Maybe that's fixed in P2... I will test later today.. No worries. 2017.3.1p2 seems to be better (like 2017.3.1p1), though I did see 1 black screen out of around 30 attempts. However, unfortunately this patch isn't really viable as it breaks Cardboard support entirely for non-Daydream phones. Is it possible this black screen issue can be resolved with another VR Services update?. This is already reported in Unity here but do you feel I should also write up the issue for this repo?. > The specific black screen issue that exists in Unity 2017.3.1p1 was fixed in Unity 2017.3.1p2:\nThis specific ticket (#855) was actually more about every other version besides Unity 2017.3.1p1. While there may be a black screen issue in that 2017.3.1p1, I didn't notice it. In fact, it was one of the only versions that I couldn't replicate this issue in. \nMy main concern is that the latest VR Services update may have caused a black screen issue (possibly unique from 971671) for Daydream devices across many older Unity versions, and there's a good chance developers aren't aware that the update is causing issues yet. Should this not be investigated from the VR Services perspective as well?. > While that APK doesn't work with Google VR Services 1.13.185188193, the same APK also doesn't work with the the 1.12.* version for me.\nInteresting. It's possible it broke in a previous VR Services update. How were you able to test with older versions? When I try uninstalling VR Services (reverting to the stock version) I receive an alert about updating VR Services when I launch my app, and if I hit cancel it doesn't initialize Daydream like it usually would (no interstitial or controller connection prompt). . > Do you have any published apps in Play store that you think were working in 1.12 but broke in 1.13?\nWell, I thought I did, but after retesting things today, the black screen issue seems to be even more fluky that I saw a few days ago. In the 10-15 launches (across both my app and the Test.apk posted above) I wasn't able to replicate on 1.13 or 1.12. I guess we'll just have to leave it there for now, and hope the root cause of this issue was fixed in 2017.3.1p2 (even though I did see 1 black screen in testing a few days ago). The flukiness makes it really hard to isolate. \n. Though it's worth noting that 2017.3.1p4 isn't a viable solution for folks dependent on Cardboard support as it still has this issue - https://answers.unity.com/questions/1456999/\nUpdate - The issue I mentioned above appears to be fixed in 2018.1 per this ticket. @fredsa do you happen to know which 2018 releases 1008211 has been fixed in?.

Anyone with any solution? @sandorvasas @KyKimGlobepoint . @rusmaxham, thanks for your reply. But I have already made the target eye settings to Both but it's still not working. (Means the player is not rotating as I rotate the Headset).\nCan you please tell me why this is happening, where I have to change or did wrong?. No. Not this one. I just saw the default value of its 1. But in the case of the grid density, typically it's valued 0.02 Unity units (I found after some search). But I want to know how to control it, how to change that value.\nWhat I know that in the virtual world, we can't move at each and every place we want as it's not continuous. The two neighboring points' gap is 0.02 Unity units which are referred to as grid density.\nCan u explain me this little bit and how to change this value?\n. @vinhui, No. I didn't enable vr from player settings before adding gvr package(it's a normal Android scene then). @vinhui, But if the scene is not changing, same drawcalls, why GPU load will vary only for vr?.

In the issue tracker a unity representative answered: \n\nthe fixes are targeted to 5.6.4p2, 2017.1.2p1, 2017.2.0p1 and 2017.3.0b3\n\nSo you should see the fix coming for 5.6.4p2. @SelaO I think this issue is unrelated to the SDK that is used. Rather something internally in Unity.\nan upgrade to 5.6.4p2 should be do-able, unless there is something broken for you in that release. if so focus on getting that fixed by Unity by sending them a bug report. Use metal rendering, open gles 3 is broken. It happens in our project as well. We made a workaround for the OpenGL error by first waiting until the screen orientation is in landscape mode and then activate VR. Having the screen in portrait orientation and setting the orientation to landscape left then activate VR in a line after setting the orientation will result in the Open GL error.\nI've already made a small project that reproduces the issue and is sent to unity QA (Case 948055).\nI ain't a 100% sure what causes this bug, but it doesn't seem to be AA / Single Pass in our project. We've tried many settings but never really fixed the issue. Instead we wrote the workaround which did the trick.\nGoogle VR has a lot of weird bugs in combination with several settings it seems. It is just not clear which settings are causing the problems.. Basically what you need is a script that extends UIBehaviour, attach it to an overlay canvas and override OnDimensionsChanged method. When you want to activate VR first set landscape left, wait till OnDimensionsChanged is called and then activate VR.\n(We did this by using a static UnityEvent, when OnDimensionsChanged is called we invoke this event which a method is subscribed to activate VR).

Hence, I have changed the video URL with \"udp://ip:port\" in the panoVideoSample, it seemed UDP not support.\nIn my existing ExoPlayer codebase, I have used UdpDataSource to support UDP streaming. Moreover,  I added some tunings for low latency. I want to build plug-ins for Android with my ExoPlayer codebase, but it seems complicated with so many modules (eg. extension-ffmpeg, extension-okhttp).\nIn this SDK, I have found that there are several AAR files under \"\\Assets\\GoogleVR\\Plugins\\Android\" folder, including \"exoplayer-r1.5.11.aar\" and \"gvr-exoplayersupport-release.aar\".

May I ask is there some ways to develop this ExoPlayer plugin more efficiently? So far, when I need to make some modifications (eg. add some logs) for this project. I have to do the steps in the following, which is quite cumbersome.\n\nWrite the code in Android studio.\nCompile the \"gvr-exoplayersupport\" module to an aar. \nMove the compiled aar to \"\\Assets\\GoogleVR\\Plugins\\Android\" folder. \nBuild the apk by Unity.\nPush the apk to my Android phone.\nStart the demo app and press the corresponding button.\nObserve the result from Logcat in Android studio.\n\nCould you share how you develop this plugin? I\u2019m a newbie in Unity programming. I was wondering if there is a pure Android application which used \"gvr-exoplayersupport-release.aar\" as an Android library. So I can omit step 3 and step 4 for faster development at the earlier stage, which needs not to switch IDE and waiting for the compiling time in Unity. Some other way to speed up the development is really appreciated. Thank you! . Hi @rusmaxham. As your suggestion, I added the udp handling code like the following.\nif (uri.getScheme().startsWith(\"jar\")) {\n      dataSource = new ObbDataSource(bandwidthMeter);\n    } else if (uri.getScheme().startsWith(\"udp\")) {\n      dataSource = new UdpDataSource(bandwidthMeter);     \n    } else {\n      dataSource = new DefaultUriDataSource(context, bandwidthMeter, userAgent);\n    }\nBut it came out the following exception\nE/VideoExoPlayer: raising exception to listeners\n    com.google.android.exoplayer.upstream.UdpDataSource$UdpDataSourceException: java.net.BindException: Address already in use\n        at com.google.android.exoplayer.upstream.UdpDataSource.open(UdpDataSource.java:116)\n        at com.google.android.exoplayer.extractor.ExtractorSampleSource$ExtractingLoadable.load(ExtractorSampleSource.java:823)\n        at com.google.android.exoplayer.upstream.Loader$LoadTask.run(Loader.java:222)\n        at java.util.concurrent.Executors$RunnableAdapter.call(Executors.java:428)\n        at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:237)\n        at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1133)\n        at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:607)\n        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:761)\n     Caused by: java.net.BindException: Address already in use\n        at java.net.PlainDatagramSocketImpl.bind0(Native Method)\n        at java.net.AbstractPlainDatagramSocketImpl.bind(AbstractPlainDatagramSocketImpl.java:96)\n        at java.net.DatagramSocket.bind(DatagramSocket.java:387)\n        at java.net.DatagramSocket.<init>(DatagramSocket.java:242)\n        at com.google.android.exoplayer.upstream.UdpDataSource.open(UdpDataSource.java:113)\n        at com.google.android.exoplayer.extractor.ExtractorSampleSource$ExtractingLoadable.load(ExtractorSampleSource.java:823)\u00a0\n        at com.google.android.exoplayer.upstream.Loader$LoadTask.run(Loader.java:222)\u00a0\n        at java.util.concurrent.Executors$RunnableAdapter.call(Executors.java:428)\u00a0\n        at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:237)\u00a0\n        at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1133)\u00a0\n        at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:607)\u00a0\n        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:761)\nBecause this plugin has a dependency on exoplayer-r1.5.11, I pulled the source code to check if exoplayer-r1.5.11 supports UDP or not. I modified the DataSource from DefaultUriDataSource to UdpDataSource, and the player works well with my UDP URL. Is there something else I need to handle for UDP support in this plugin? Thank you!. Hi @rusmaxham. After I added the log in UdpDataSource's read function. I found that after the \"java.net.BindException\", the plugin got the packet as usual, just like the behavior in exoplayer-r1.5.11 DemoPlayer. I try to dump the packet to file in UdpDataSource to check if there is a difference between DemoPlayer and this plugin, but the permission since Marshmallow does not allow me to do so in the ExoPlayer library. \nI have tried GVR SDK for Unity v1.180.0 with my UdpDataSource handling, it has been playing successfully for about 10 seconds. But it happened only once. I was wondering if there is some execution flows that is not handled correctly, that cause the player is always like below.\n\nI have tried to trace the code to compare the flow between exoplayer-r1.5.11 DemoPlayer and this plugin. But I still can not figure out what is the root cause of the failure playback. Actually the implementation of the DemoPlayer and the VideoExoPlayer is quite different. Could you share the experience of the plugin's porting logic from the HLS, DASH and local file example? Or maybe you could reproduce the problem and check what is going on? Streaming a UDP source is one line of ffmpeg command like the following.\nReproduction steps\n\n\nMake sure your Android phone can connect to your streaming server. In my case, I use my laptop for the streaming server.

If you attached the GvrHead script to your camera object and use VRSettings.enabled the cardboard toggle works in iOS.

Running Unity 5.5.3f1 on a Mac. . Hi Mira!\nThe plot thickens. I took out GVR 1.3 out of my project and imported 1.4. Unity now repeatedly crashes with the same error originating somewhere in libsystem_kernel.dylib (see the screenshot).\nOther projects with GVR 1.3 and below do not exhibit the same behavior.  I'll install the Unity 5.6 version alongside 5.5 and will let you know if I get the same error message. \n\n. Hey veerb4h,\nWhat version of the GVR SDK and Unity and Xcode are you using? Here are my Unity settings for GVR 1.3 for Unity 5.5.3 for Xcode 8.3 (see the three attached screenshots):\n\n\n\nThe scripting symbols doesn't seem to make any difference. But this does produce a xcodeproject that Xcode doesn't complain about -- no GvrAudio errors or any other errors. \nI've not had a chance to install Unity 5.6 in parallel with 5.5.\n. Hi  @veerb4h ,\nCan you please double-check that the Gvr Audio Spatializer is selected under Project Settings > Audio in Unity?\n\n. Hi Mira @miraleung!\nMy stuff's compiling now (on Unity 5.5 with SDK 1.3). \nDeleting the folders you mentioned and reimporting fixed the missing symbols issue for me but it sounds like @veerb4h is having the same problem based on his errors and he followed the same steps.  \nI'm not sure what else could be the issue except for not including the Gvr Audio Spatializer plugin. Ideas?\n. Hi again @miraleung!\nI've upgraded to Unity 5.6.1f1 and I'm getting the libPods-Unity-iPhone.a linker error with GVR v. 1.3.0.  Deleting Assets/GoogleVR and Assets/Plugins/iOS isn't making a difference -- I made sure I deletes and re-imported a few times for consistency.\nHere's what I see in Xcode when Unity finishes building the project:\n1)\n\nSince all these are missing, I delete them, try to build in Xcode and then get an error that says the GVROverlayView.h file is missing (it was in one of the subfolders under that Pods folder).\nI put the file here and build again...\n2)\n\n3) Now, I get this GvrAudio error we've seen before: \n```\nUndefined symbols for architecture arm64:\n  \"_SetSourceGain\", referenced from:\n      _GvrAudio_UpdateAudioSource_m910492288 in Bulk_Assembly-CSharp_0.o\n      _GvrAudio_SetSourceGain_m2700692092 in Bulk_Assembly-CSharp_0.o\n     (maybe you meant: _GvrAudio_SetSourceGain_m2700692092)\n  \"_SetSourceDistanceAttenuationMethod\", referenced from:\n      _GvrAudio_UpdateAudioSource_m910492288 in Bulk_Assembly-CSharp_0.o\n      _GvrAudio_SetSourceDistanceAttenuationMethod_m2494613792 in Bulk_Assembly-CSharp_0.o\n```\n4) Mucking around with the Xcode linker flags hasn't helped so far, so I'll go back to Unity 5.5.3. \nThanks for helping work out the kinks in the Unity/Xcode pipeline!\n. Hey @miraleung, yes, I've tried the workaround mentioned in #504, deleting the $(inherited) flag from Xcode but no luck this time. It has worked before. \nI am back to Unity 5.5 for the moment but of course eventually I'll need to use GVR 1.5 and hence upgrade to Unity 5.6+. \nIn a related note, I tried using Unity 2017.1 beta and it's not recognizing the Cardboard SDK at all but that's a Unity issue..

    "ddrocco": "Thanks for reporting, we'll look into it!. Thanks for your input!  Unfortunately your rewrite will break backwards compatibility for some other users, and we work very hard to keep the code working for everyone.\nI took a look and it looks like the code's original form actually works as intended.  A lot of the variables in question have misleading names, and it's not using Lerp in the usual way.  What the code currently does is gradually shift the Reticle(Inner/Outer)Diameter towards a target value, shifting more during longer update loops and less during shorter ones.  It's not clean or precise, but it gets the job done.. Thanks for your report; we'll take a look.. I've traced the allocation to the UnityEngine.XR.XRSettings.loadedDeviceName (UnityEngine.VR.VRSettings.loadedDeviceName pre-2017.2) method, which allocates the memory for a new string.  Unfortunately, I don't see a clean workaround from our end.  We've marked this as a Unity bug.. This has been fixed in our upcoming GVR release.  The fix will be compatible with 2018.3 Unity and later (and will have no effect on earlier versions).. Hi, I've been unable to replicate this bug (setting instance.keyboardState.isReady to false and then calling ClearText() every frame, and in a separate build doing the same only on certain actions, didn't ever crash the app).  It looks like it's been a very long time since this code was updated (mid-2017), so I'm not sure why it was crashing for you.  Feel free to reopen this if it's still a problem and you can provide any additional replication details.. Thanks for your report; we'll take a look!. Hi, I've tried to reproduce your issue with a new Galaxy Note 8 and a fresh download of GVR SDK 1.120.0 and everything worked for me.\nIs your phone loading anything, or is the static starting position scene in the Unity editor?  What do you expect when you tap the screen?\nUseful things to verify:\n-Unity is set to the Android platform in File > Build Settings.\n-The Galaxy Note 8 has USB Debugging set to True.\n-You have made no modifications to the code in GVR SDK 1.120.0.. Hi, I'm going to close this issue; if you're still having this problem, please let us know and reopen it!. Thanks for reporting; we'll take a look!. Hi, we've addressed the first problem, and it should be live with our next release on 5/28.  If you want to make a local change on your end before that, it was an issue with branching in the GetHeadRotation's editor code.  We've added the following lines inside the #if UNITY_EDITOR statement:\nif (InstantPreview.Instance.IsCurrentlyConnected != null) {\n  return Camera.main.transform.localRotation;\n} else {\n  //prior behavior\n}\nRegarding the second problem, we'll take a look at detecting the GyroController behavior and getting rotation accordingly.\nAccommodating a SetHeadRotation method would be useful, but would require a larger refactor to work well.  We'll look into it and let you know what we decide!. We've merged this into our system; thanks for the find and your contributions!  :). Hi, the primary use case of the Controller Emulator is for pairing with an actual Daydream headset.  The controller-only mode of InstantPreview is for working with a Bluetooth-paired device, be it a Controller or Phone emulating a controller.\nAt the bottom of the Controller Emulator developer page (https://developers.google.com/vr/daydream/controller-emulator), there's a section labelled \"Game engines\".  You can use a USB debugging-enabled phone running the ControllerEmulator app and connected via USB in Unity Play mode.  Make sure to enable the \"USB\" EmulatorConnectionMode on the GvrControllerInput script in your Unity scene (which should be default in the Demo scenes)!  Also, make sure the phone running the ControllerEmulator app doesn't have the InstantPreview app installed; I ran into some issues with the InstantPreview app closing the ControllerEmulator when I hit the Play button.\nWe'll fix up the documentation to point towards these, and look into documentation detailing setups for testing in Play mode with 2 Phones, 1 Phone / 1 Controller, and just 1 Phone.. Thanks for the report; we'll take a look.. Have you added a GvrControllerInput instance (eg the GvrControllerMain prefab) to your scene?  If it's in there, you should be able to see your controller (and move it with Shift+MouseMovement).\nThe missing GvrEditorEmulator instance warning seems to be a separate unrelated bug we'll look into.. Hi, thanks for reporting!  We're looking into this.. Regarding iOS eye swaps, that seems like a different issue entirely and probably warrants another bug.    I haven't been able to reproduce it.  Are you still encountering that issue?  What steps can I take to try to reproduce it, and what kind of Unity / XCode environment are you running?. Awesome, glad to hear things are working :). Thanks for reporting, we're looking into this!. Thanks for reporting, we'll look into this.. Thanks for reporting!  I suspect there's something missing here.\nFirst of all, it looks like the code snippet is returning in the Update method.\nSecond, I'm not sure why you're using the mouse with GVR (unless that's just for being able to trigger the check on-command).\nThere's available info on the object the pointer is actively touching; could you just have the pointer itself check which object it's trying to interact with, and call a method depending on which kind of object that is (eg activate a button if a UI element, otherwise fire a gun)?. Since it's been a while, I'm marking this as closed for the time being.  Hopefully you found a workaround or got things working!  If not, feel free to reopen this bug with more info and we'll take a look!. In MouseControllerProvider.cs, there's a method called private void UpdateOrientation().  In it is the line state.gyro = deltaDegrees * (Mathf.Deg2Rad / Time.deltaTime);.  Replace this line with the following:\nif (Time.deltaTime > 0f) {\n    state.gyro = deltaDegrees * (Mathf.Deg2Rad / Time.deltaTime);\n} else {\n    state.gyro = Vector3.zero;\n}\nI'll try to get an official fix out for this shortly.. Thanks, vinhui, that's correct.  Closing this issue for now; please reopen it if you have any issues with using the regular Android Phone development/deployment workflow on the Lenovo Mirage Solo!. Thanks for reporting!  I'll add it to our internal bug list.. Hi, I managed to fix this in my own environment.  It looks like the \"deactivation\" problem is being caused by the GvrPointerPhysicsRaycaster occasionally getting into a state of colliding with the VR_Player.  GvrPointerPhysicsRaycaster is currently set to collide with EVERYTHING.  When I disabled a layer from the GvrPointerPhysicsRaycaster's RaycasterEventMask and assigned the VR_Player to that disabled layer, I was unable to replicate the bug and it appears to be working.\nClosing this since there doesn't seem to be any action needed on our part.  Please reopen the bug if you have any more issues!. Hi, thanks for reporting!  We're working on a fix ASAP.  We'll keep you posted!. Hi, thanks for reporting.  We'll take a look.. This looks like it could be related to https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/issues/1002.  If it is the same bug, the steps listed there should be a reasonable workaround until we can get a fix out. . Instant Preview unfortunately only runs on Windows and Mac.  We don't currently have plans to support a Linux plugin for that feature.. ",

If I preallocate and then burrow, the preallocated ones stay hidden and new ones are being instantiated and not even under the same parent object. \nAlso, there's no way to know if I already have a number of active enemies in the scene or not from the pool itself, I need to keep a counter of my own for each pool. . ```\n    public GameObjectPool EnemyPool2 {\n        get {\n            // Get the pool manager.\n            ObjectPoolManager poolManager = ObjectPoolManager.Instance;\n            Assert.IsNotNull(poolManager);\n        // Get the pool and return it if it already exists.\n        string poolName = \"Enemy\";\n        GameObjectPool pool =\n            poolManager.GetPool<GameObjectPool>(poolName);\n\n        if (pool != null) {\n            return pool;\n        }\n\n        // Create the pool if it doesn't exist yet.\n        pool = new GameObjectPool(enemy, 5, 5);\n        poolManager.AddPool(poolName, pool);\n\n        return pool;\n    }\n}\n\n```\nAnd then call it like this: GameObject newEnemy = EnemyPool2.Borrow ();\nThen I have an EnemyPool with 5 hidden GameObjects and then with burrow, I get enemies without a parent:\n\n.

That's exactly the problem, I don't think that it's an expected behavior that some pooled objects will be children of the pool and some don't.\nAlso, when you borrow from a pool that already preallocated several objects, why allocate a new different object when burrowing and not gives one of those that were allocated? what's the point of having them if you can't get them?\nLastly, the pool should have a willGrow toggle to enable or disable auto growing when burrowing, that's the point of a pool. .

    "OmegaMule": "Hi, is there any progress? We are having the same issue, instant crash on S8/S8+ when using non-native resolution. It would be really wonderful to get a fix asap.\nOr is there a way to force user or Android to always switch to native resolution before staring an app?\nThx.\n. Thank you for response. \nJust my two cents on the first solution/workaround:\n\nThat would require new Unity (patch) release and re-import of ALL projects for every developer. Also from my experience with Unity, it might work in one release and stops working in another... \n\nCould anyone please point me to the root cause of the crash? Is it GVR SDK, GVR service or Unity Player causing this? Thx.. It is becoming to be a really pressing issue, especially for developers who have their apps already on Google Play. Bad reviews could bury their apps, nobody cares it's not their fault. I just hope they will be able to fix it via GVR Services update which should be released at the end of this month. If not, then I'll have to do some ugly workarounds. \nAlso, IMHO, VR (or any app) should keep the resolution user has selected and shouldn't try to switch to native. Software should respect users settings, not override it. This problem shouldn't exist.. There is another interesting bug related to this issue. Calling Screen.SetResolution() in Unity doesn't affect Cardboard's VR viewports at all. They are always being rendered at the initial size (being rendered outside of screen borders for example). What makes this even worse is that calling VRSettings.RenderScale or ViewportRenderScale changes their resolution, but not their on-screen size. So first of all SetResolution() should work correctly, without it nobody can really do any workarounds. \nAlso, since apps do NOT crash with VR Services turned off, probably because resolution is not being enforced, how hard can it be to release hotfix VRServices version which wouldn't enforce the native res for Cardboard apps?. @dustinkerstein: Unity 2017.1.2p1 \"XR: Fixed handling of Android density (screen resolution) changes to avoid a crash.\"\n\nI haven't tried it yet, because I use 5.6.x, but this change should avoid the crash. Whether they also fixed the scaling issue is unknown. Somebody should try it.. OK I've tested the crashfix change on Unity 2017.1.2p1 and Unity 5.6.4p1, the result is as I've predicted. Unity devs just added \"density\" to Android Manifest, which prevents the crash when GVR Services enforce resolution change. The scaling, however, is still not fixed. VR viewports are incorrectly scaled and positioned due to resolution difference. \n\nSo this is just first step. Users still need to change resolution to WQHD to use Cardboard.\nIs there any ETA for the scaling fix? Thanks.\nUpdate: \nLuckily it's possible to create a fully working workaround using Screen.SetResolution() to make it work without user intervention. . @dustinkerstein: \nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1235362/30393677-baf78ef4-9875-11e7-971b-f217abded447.png\nIt looks exactly like that on real Galaxy S8 device and clean Unity version I mentioned before.\nUpdate:\nI've also tried it on S8 simulator you posted with the same result..

    "gstanlo": "The app was originally focused on Daydream, and unfortunately uses several higher level Android API calls that are not available on devices which support Cardboard but not Daydream i.e. API <24. . We've noticed some issues with the latest version Instant Preview running on the Axon 7 phone. At this time the best suggestion we have is that a device update to the phone might help,. We're looking into this now, though.. Which version were you using before? Also, can you share your device and VR services version? For reference I've been able to get it to work with the following:\nModel number: ZTE A2017U\nInstant Preview: 1.0.0.57\nAndroid: 7.0\nvr services build: 1.10.170928015\nMiFavor UI (?): 4.2. Can you ensure that no other instances of Unity running Instant Preview are open? Also worth trying is to close all instances, run adb kill-server, and then reopen. It's rather puzzling that everything seems nearly identical (I tried updating to 7.1.1 as well). I can take a look at your logcat if you email it to me: stanlo@google.com. . It's surprising that you can't connect to the host computer, but it's visible in the host selection. When you select it from the drop down menu, does it stay in the disconnected (red) state, or does it appear connected (grey) but not stream? \nThere should be little difference between wifi/usb. Instead of connecting to 127.0.0.1, the app will connect to the advertised host address. Is it possible something in your router is blocking tcp packets going to port 49838? \nAlso, in your adb logcat, do you see a message from Instant Preview indicating that it is attempting to connect to your host's ip address?. The multicast is only used to advertise the host address, and that aspect seems to be working; I'm assuming that the host computer you're trying to connect to is indeed at 10.1.2.135?\nIs the logcat showing any exceptions?. Channel is unrecoverably broken and will be disposed \nlooks worrisome, are there any exceptions before that? \nAlso, can you try starting in VR mode? It should begin that way if you start it from the Daydream launcher, and it should list your host computer name in the vr view. There might be some issue when it switches activities.. The video streaming should be very similar between both versions -- can you confirm that the gvr demo scene works properly?. Hey Yunqi-Hu, there is currently a bug in the osx version that should be fixed soon. We recommend disabling the \"install on play\" check box after you've successfully installed the app once.\nAs for the phone output, have you been able to use it successfully with the GVR Demo scene or using the controller-only mode? Does it ever list itself as connected?. It appears that the Samsung S7 Edge isn't officially supported by Daydream which is required by Instant Preview. I assume that you're somehow able to build Daydream apps to this device? \nThe troubleshooting might help -- does your device or the Unity debug output say that it's connected? Also ensure only one instance of Unity using Instant Preview is open, and optionally try calling \"adb kill-server\" and restarting Unity.. Hi @matttturnbull, does the app show that it is connected as well? Is this an issue specifically with Pixel 2s?\nIf possible, could you send the logcat data after attempting to connect to stanlo@google.com?. Hi, sorry about the late response! There doesn't seem to be much in the logcat, but I would expect to see a connection message if you're able to connect. It looks like there aren't any exceptions being thrown? Does the controller-only streaming work? Also, does wifi behave differently?. Hmm I'll try to get a hold of High Sierra -- does the controller emulator work at all? That uses a similar connection setup.. That's a fascinating fix... I wonder why that works. The script starts the app using \nadb shell monkey -p com.google.instantpreview -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER 1\nand installs the app using \nadb uninstall com.google.instantpreview\nadb install (apk path)\nI've just tested it on Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, Instant Preview version 1.1.0 and the GVR Unity SDK version 1.110.0 and it worked without doing anything special (other than enabling debugging on the device?) The daydream version on the device is 1.12.171114043. \nI'm still looking into this but having trouble reproducing it.\n. Do you receive any output in the console window? I've tested on 5.6.4f1 and I'll get the message \n\nInstant Preview 1.1.0\n\nand\n\nConnected to Instant Preview.\n\nWhich OS are you running Unity on? . Hmmm strange, when Unity is open and previewing, can you open a terminal and run adb reverse --list? It should show a line like \n\n(reverse) tcp:49838 tcp:49838\n\nAnother common problem is having two different adb versions on your computer. If you type which adb, does that correspond to a different path in your unity preferences? Additionally, do the two have different versions if you run adb version?. Apologies I haven't found anything obvious from the logs from Pixel 2s yet, though our analytics indicate some Instant Preview activity from Pixel 2 devices.

It looks like a better fix is you have to have an instance of the GvrControllerMain prefab in addition to the GvrEditorEmulator as the GvrControllerMain prefab has the GvrControllerInput class as a component which then will call UpdateEditorEmulation if running in Unity Editor mode.

This can be useful for promotional materials. To facilitate this, you can access head tracking data when VRSettings.enabled equals false and the VRSettings.loadedDeviceName is daydream or cardboard.\nFor example:\nUnityEngine.VR.VRSettings.enabled = false;\nCamera.main.GetComponent().localRotation = UnityEngine.VR.InputTracking.GetLocalRotation(VRNode.CenterEye);\n\nAnd ResetAspect() is reverting the aspect ratio to the screen's aspect ratio.

    "ylluminarious": "Can confirm that this seems fixed in Unity 2017.3.0f3.. @fredsa Thanks for the advice. It turns out that the issue was that I had not tagged my Camera component with the MainCamera tag.. @rusmaxham I still have trouble connecting through Wifi, though my issues are somewhat different. Some details are available here.. @Yunqi-Hu @gstanlo \nI had a similar (same?) issue in Unity 2017.2.0p1.\nI had very similar warnings in my editor console and whenever I ran my game with Instant Preview, it would crash. There were no errors in my editor console, though. I'm not sure if crashing is what you mean by there being \"no output on the phone\" @Yunqi-Hu.\nFortunately, after disabling Install Apk On Run, everything worked fine. This only happened after upgrading to 2017.2 and did not happen in an older version of Unity 2017.1. I have to guess that newer versions of Unity are doing something weird which is causing these issues.. @Yunqi-Hu Have you tried launching Instant Preview through the Daydream menu? That's the only way I could get it to work. The vanilla Android interface that you show there did not work for me either.. @Yunqi-Hu Hmm, ok. The last piece of advice that I have is that you may not have your scene's camera tagged with the MainCamera tag. If your camera doesn't have this tag, Instant Preview won't work and troubleshooting it can be a pain. I had a struggle with it over at this ticket.. @Yunqi-Hu Well, sorry about that. Best of luck to you!. @dsternfeld7 Thanks a lot for your suggestions! Following your instructions fixed my problem, hopefully it also worked for @linglonglinglong.. Not sure why you closed this issue @LightOwlFlies. I cannot even get video to work in Daydream, let alone the editor. Plus there are some other gaping anomalies which indicate that this is still a real issue. Also, I'm writing this comment on the most recent SDK version, v1.120.0.\nThe root of this problem seems to be that GetRenderEventFunc is only defined as:\ncsharp\n  private static IntPtr GetRenderEventFunc() {\n    Debug.Log(NOT_IMPLEMENTED_MSG);\n    return IntPtr.Zero;\n  }\nAlthough it seems that it is supposed to be defined differently based on the platform. Because otherwise it will always block IssuePlayerEvent which is called by Init which is used to play video:\n```csharp\n  private void IssuePlayerEvent(RenderCommand evt) {\n    if (renderEventFunction == IntPtr.Zero) {\n      / it looks like GetRenderEventFunc is supposed to do something here\n       * but it can only ever just log \"Not implemented on this platform\" /\n      renderEventFunction = GetRenderEventFunc();\n    }\nif (renderEventFunction == IntPtr.Zero || evt == RenderCommand.None) {\n  Debug.LogError(\"Attempt to IssuePlayerEvent before renderEventFunction ready.\");\n  return;\n}\n\nGL.IssuePluginEvent(renderEventFunction, videoPlayerEventBase + (int)evt);\n\n}\n```\nI am really not sure how exactly this is supposed to work. But this broken chain of logic alone seems to make video a no-go in Daydream. If I'm missing something, I would definitely appreciate some help here. This honestly seems like it's a bug.. @rusmaxham Ok, I was not aware that [DllImport(dllName)] signifies calling into the native lib.\nI will try to come up with a demo project and send it to you privately. What email address would you like me to send it to?. @rusmaxham Friendly ping... did you see my last question there?. Ok, so I managed to solve this issue in an email dialog with @rusmaxham. If you're seeing issues similar to mine, it probably boils down to a few things:\n\nYou may be missing libgvrvideo.so. In order to get that library, import the GVRVideoPlayer.unitypackage file.\nYou will probably still see errors saying things like \"Video player not ready to Play!\" or \"illegal instruction\" when you try to play videos in the Editor or with Instant Preview. That is just something you'll have to live with for now and it should not prevent your video from playing in Daydream itself. More explanation is here.\nYou may also need to adjust the Stereo mode in the VideoStereo component's settings in order to get the video to display properly. For example, for flat videos you may want to set Stereo mode to None.\nOne more issue is that Cardboard isn't supported by the video plugin currently. Hopefully @rusmaxham or others will fix this and make the video plugin work with Cardboard as well.. @rusmaxham Sorry, I meant to reply to this a couple of weeks ago after you sent it. I've been terribly busy with this project so I haven't had the time.

    "delphinius81": "I've had it happen with a variety of QR codes. One of them is found at: http://www.sitesinvr.com/viewer/boboz4/index.html\nAlso with the QR code generated by the viewer profile generator using: http://google.com/cardboard/cfg?p=CghGZWFybGVzcxILRmVhcmxlc3MgWjQdl9snPSWPjYA9KhDsAz1C7AM9QuwDPULsAz1CWAE1KVwPPToIj8J1PZqZmb5QAGAD\nAs for a build with more details, I'm already building the Unity side as a development build and xcode in Debug. Is there a specific logging setting I should enable?\n. Trying to set the default profile also results in a hang for me, so that's not an option. (I made the __Internal dll name change for iOS to enable the SetViewerProfile function call.) The only way my app will run is if it uses the default carboard profile and it's never changed.\nIn fact, further testing today revealed that I can't get the app to launch into VR mode on a second run through even when I make no attempt to change the viewer profile. The application locks up when transitioning to VR mode. The following error shows in xcode log after I initiate the transition:\nNSURLSession/NSURLConnection HTTP load failed (kCFStreamErrorDomainSSL, -9806)\nHowever I have no idea what is making this call.. The device has internet access (pairing the viewer works fine using the Cardboard app). I have allow http download enabled through Unity settings for my app.\nBut I will experience a hang on a second attempt to run my application. This is very possibly a second issue that I've discovered with 2017.1.1p1 (which uses the 1.80 NDK).\nI do not call SetViewerProfile in code. I do not tap the settings icon to change the viewer profile through the camera. I launch the app the first time, get it to launch into VR mode, then quit the app. I launch the app again, it hangs when transitioning to VR mode and I see the HTTP load failed error.. The second run bug appears to go back several versions of 5.6 as well (5.6.1p4, 5.6.3p2, 5.6.3p3) and 2017.1.0p5. I went back to try versions with different gvr ndk versions.\nCreated a simple scene - just a camera and cube. No scripts added. No packages imported. Cardboard set as target vr device.\nBoth mentioned issues appear:\n1) Hang when attempting to change QR code.\n2) App hangs on launch (never loads the Unity splash screen) on a 2nd play attempt.. I'm thinking that it might have been due to the QR code that I generated from https://vr.google.com/cardboard/viewerprofilegenerator/. Any idea why a QR code would crash the app?\nThe parameters are from: http://google.com/cardboard/cfg?p=CghGZWFybGVzcxICejQdl9snPSWPjYA9KhDsAz1C7AM9QuwDPULsAz1CWAE1KVwPPToIj8J1PZqZmb5QAGAD\nDoes that work for you?. That QR code works (in that the app does not crash), but it results in a complete lack of lens distortion. The left/right images are rendered completely square, so either the code lacks any parameters, or something is ignoring them.\nI've tried to create additional QR codes with different names/parameters, and they all come up when scanned as being \"z4\" viewer and then freeze my application (though they seem to scan fine in the published iOS cardboard app on the app store).\nI can scan other QR codes for this device (found at https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleCardboard/comments/4i17vu/lets_compare_viewer_profile_values_for_the_bobovr/) just fine.\nThis is striking me as something wrong with 1) the version of the currently live version of the profile generator or 2) how new QR codes are processed in the latest ios cardboard sdk.. Sure. Following is the image that is generated.\n\nIt uses the following parameters:\nCompany Name: Fearless\nDevice Name: FearlessZ4\nScreen to lens distance: 38\nInter-lens distance: 60\nButton type: Indirect Touch\nScreen Vertical Alignment: bottom\nTray to lens center distance: 38\nDistortion k1: .2\nDistortion k2: .05\nFOV angles: all set to 50\nSave/Load parameters URI is: http://google.com/cardboard/cfg?p=CghGZWFybGVzcxICejQdl9snPSWPjYA9KhDsAz1C7AM9QuwDPULsAz1CWAE1KVwPPToIj8J1PZqZmb5QAGAD\nWhen I scan that QR code using the iOS Google Cardboard app, it says \"Your phone is now configured for your z4 viewer.\" It's like the new QR code is completely ignored, and it's trying to load up some corrupted old QR code instead. However, I can scan other codes and have it show up just fine.. The QR you provided works. So basically the profile generator is broken for me then? I entered in those parameters from a blank form, and it generated a broken QR code.\nIf I attempt to load the viewer parameters using the link you give, but I change the viewer name, I end up with a QR that is bad as well. Is https://vr.google.com/cardboard/viewerprofilegenerator/ just broken or something?. Same here. Version 61.0.3163.100 (Official Build) (64-bit). Using Safari seems to work though.\nI can load the viewer parameters from your QR code, change the viewer name, and the code is successfully loaded.\nGuess I can try incognito mode in Chrome, maybe some extension I'm running is interfering somehow.. Hmm, everything loads fine when using an incognito browser tab. Must be an extension messing with the javascript somehow.\nI guess this issue is resolved as much as need be, though I'd suggest improving the UX for when a bad QR code is scanned/provided. Ideally, if the user scans a bad code, that would be detected and discarded, and the last known good or default values would be used instead, with some kind of warning for the user to try a different code.. What version of the Oculus SDK were you using? Unity Tools SDK 1.15 to 1.18 had issues with projects that included the OVR code clobbering the fact that Oculus was not listed in VR devices - it would make changes to the generated manifest marking the application is a gearvr application instead of google vr..

    "fhcampbell": "\nWe believe we fixed this. Please reopen if you still have this issue.\n\nHi,\nCould you elablore possible, what is the fix?\nI've posted a reply  when the same issue occured immediatly after Android stuido updated.\nI am going back through the suggestions to my post about this issue less than 2 weeks ago.\nThere, you'll see that I ve checked the adb device. \nThis is consuming hours.\nWas the fix that you are referring to based on anything not accessible on Unity and solely based on android previous API versions?\nThank you for your reply.\nIt's bizarre that the entire editor is not working on play just after the latest updates to Android.\nSo, there's got to be an option to restore teh controller.\nThank you Chaosemer.\n. Thank you both VERY much each of you for your reply and for your suggestions.\nUnfortunately, seems to bypass the configuration for adb set directly by the PC.\nI re-verified that adb works from the command and I see the path , as shown.\nI rebooted too.\nSo, then I definitely went to also try emulator OFF, as you suggested.\nI am not getting any changes.\nWhen you say that I need to have the sdk platform-tools in my path, where do I do that exactly?\nMy Editor>External Tools>..already shows the jdk, ndk for it. \nSo maybe I am mistkane:  Are you possibly meaning there are other platform-tools to set? and if so, are those in the unity build settings? \n\n\n\n\n\nsdk platform-tools in your PATH\n\nIf I could, I would ask Google to convert the controller to an android peripheral designed like a collapsible husk inside more husks. then i could pull out the design control I want to use and push it back in, to whatever scale of operatoin I needed to build.  If so, then I could customize without the controller being forced to fit into  the unity editor and excluding all the other functionality that android studio has to offer in the final game rendering.  . Hi vinhui.\nThank you for your reply again, firstly.\nI know you wrote the reference to System variables PATH variable.\nThere is a possibility that I have overlooked a step that you mean.\nIf so, could you describe specifically how to do what you are suggesting.\nThat might bring the problem that I am having to a solution.\nIf not, I will tell you taht I have already done adding to the system variables path, and that I have done so and restarted all engines afterwards.  The problem persisted.  The adb device call is working from the start of my windows terminal, regardless of which folder I am in.\nFor this reason, I would be happy to follow your specific steps and what you mean.\nI would also be happy to show you my machine such as on zoom or the app of your pref if you think you might have a few minutes.\nThank you again very much.\nReally grateful.. What should the path to the platform tools look like?\nI found the PATH variable exists in the second box, shown in the snapshot here:\n\nAs you probably know, there are two files in there- each separated by the semi-colon.\nIf I understand you correctly, you suggest I add the same path found within the  second box . \nThat means:  copy that path in the second box and  then go back to Unity and paste it into the platform tools (External tools?) by going  Unity>Edit>Preferences>ExternalTools>SDK\nIs that what you mean?\nIf so, it shows  a download requirement.\nThis means: to copy the Android SDK into whatever that PATH file directory was.\nIs that what you mean?\n\nI'll definitely wait to hear if this is correct before doing it - just in case it would trigger any conflict\nAnd in the meantime I will start copying the long path because CTRL-C in the Environmental Variables windows does not seem to work.\nBut, I would be so happy if this was the solution and it worked !\n. The other option was to do the following:\n1. Add new to the path as SDK platform-tools \n\n\nAnd add it to the User Variables for User too.\n\n\n. The second option that I just described definitely does not work.\nTurning the Emulator to OFF from USB or WiFI does not impact the result.\nThe effect of this problem is huge: No game can be built or run on Google.\nI have tried using and setting up the Interactive360 feature, and it includes the GvrSDK instantly.\nWell, I have setup another post about the fact that when you launch it, it declares multiple duplicate plugins.  The solution includes deleting Unity's automatica TempPro package instllation .\nBut, when this is done, Unity auto-searches for OpenVR.\nWhen it does not find OpenVR, it uses Oculus.\nIt does NOT work with GoogleVR unless it forces in OpenVR and if OpenVR is not wanted, it uses Oculus literally as a constant operation.\nI need to use Google Daydream and I do not want Oculus.\nThis is really frustrating.. It says the same message of Controller Disconnected.  In the unity top , it also says Remote Not Connected.\nIt is at times freaking me out-\nI am bypassing the steps for now by exporting as an internal (Build > Check Export, Reject Gradle)\nMy God- I need ot meet with a network-client.  Im building on every workaround because of quality priorities in rendering.\nIf anyone works with google here, would it be at all possible to approach a direction as if you are eventually allowing development  with Android Studio Direct instead of Windows Visual Studio, and  monodevelop.  It would help so much TRULY.  I need that efficiency .   If you are already, thank you with my head bowed,...literally.. The replies I just received suggest these are bots.\nIf this is not true, then the issue is more advanced than those who have\nreplied.\nOp di 16 okt. 2018 om 18:51 schreef Fred Sauer notifications@github.com:\n\n@fhcampbell https://github.com/fhcampbell If you prefer Android Studio\nfor your next project, you can use the Google VR SDK for Android\nhttps://developers.google.com/vr/develop/android/get-started.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/issues/969#issuecomment-430312556,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AEcNUGWZb0_luymAnfVOcBbCs5nwU9Hzks5ulg6jgaJpZM4XM6hN\n.\n.

I have tried what you suggested to open instant preview from daydream menu, unfortunately, it still doesn't work.

But just couldn't get it to work now.... @rusmaxham Hi, thank you for the notice about the new sdk release. I have tried the new SDK, somehow, it still doesn't work for me. This is the waring from the console. May I know what does installed version and local version means respectively here?\n\n. @ylluminarious I checked the MainCamera tag. That doesn't seem to be my problem. Anyway, thank you!. @rusmaxham That warning appears whenever I enable the \"install on the run\".

You guys are so helpful!. @gstanlo Thanks for the reminder. I tried to start it from that path, it turns out that path is not valid somehow. I fixed the problem by relocate the SDK and put the new path into both Unity and the .dash_profile. Thank you! . ",

Afraid the emulator works, but instant preview doesn't! Tried with a brand new macbook and High Sierra as well, same problem. \ud83d\ude2c. Not exactly a full fix, but I read a comment somewhere that encouraged me to do this (works as an interim at least):\n1) Run from Unity with 'Install Apk on run\u2019 enabled to install InstantPreview\n2) Stop Unity\n3) Disable 'Install Apk on run\u2019 flag\n4) Go to Daydream store, library and open InstantPreview\n5) Run again from Unity, tada!.

Their fix was to remove the '-l' in the command.

Hi MG,\nNope.   I've also not managed to find anyone that can confirm it does work for the Pixel 2 XL.\nFor now it takes 40 seconds to compile, load, and run a new binary.   A bit of pain, but I've had much worse.\n. There was a new version of Unity released on the 19th Dec.  \nNow Instant Preview with the Pixel 2 XL Works!  Yay!\nThis is on OSX 10.13.2 and Google VR v 1.110.0 and Unity 2017.3.0f3.\nThere was a little fiddling with the settings.   VR supported moved to a new tab 'XR Settings'.  I have to compile and run on the device once.   After that the play button works.  Sweet.\nThanks Unity, Google, Community!\nLB. ",

    "Sourcetreehugger": "Hey Fredsa, thanks for your quick reply. Scaling the player (main camera) results in a translation of the main camera.  This indeed results an 'enlarged' effect of the world. However this is because the player is being translated. Rotating the player results in strange behaviour where rotation and translation clash. For instance looking at the floor results in the camera translating through the floor. \nI found a hacky workaround for the issue but it's probably not the best solution: Create an extra camera and set the field of view at your desired value. Render the camera to a render texture (a quad). Place the quad in front of the main camera and make it a child of the main camera so it rotates with your player. Enable the quad and binocular camera when you enter binocular mode. \nHere is a screenshot of a test with scaling the main camera.\n\n. Hey Fredsa. Thanks for your efforts in trying to help me out here. I tried your method, but still no succes for me. This script attached to the player root results into same behaviour as before (above). This script attatched to the main camera results in no change. \nScript used:\n// \nVector3 initialPosition;\nvoid Awake() \n  {\n    // Capture initial player position, so we can later scale height.\n    initialPosition = transform.localPosition;\n  }\nvoid Update() \n  {\n      // For testing, use touchpad to select a scale, approximately 0.1 - 10. \n      float scale = 0.5f;\n  // Scale player game object.\n  transform.localScale = new Vector3(scale, scale, scale);\n\n  // Set scale-adjusted player height.\n  transform.localPosition = new Vector3(initialPosition.x,\n                                        initialPosition.y * scale,\n                                        initialPosition.z);\n}\n\n//\nI deciced to stick with the render texture method as I described earlier. It is a more expensive render method, but it works for me now. I can get away with it with proper culling settings. Anyhow, thanks for your help :) \n. Hey Fredsa,\nI'm currently on Unity 2017.3. I have found a solution for the problem so I wanted to give an update. Please note that the update only works on a VR device (not in the editor).\nChanging field of view is as follows when your device is in VR mode (Tested on Android Oneplus 3).\nusing UnityEngine.XR;\n//Code for changing FOV\nvoid Start()\n{\n      XRDevice.fovZoomFactor = 2;\n}\n.

    "hshapley": "The original issue still happens for me with Unity 2017.3 and GVR SDK 1.130.1. If I change the Target API to 24, then the app doesn't crash. However, there are still some bugs in the PermissionsFlowManager code - the results callback is executed in a separate thread, so you cannot call any Unity APIs, such as setting the text or color. I worked around this by setting a boolean to trigger the desired actions in the Update() method. Not ideal, but gets the job done for now.\nIt would be nice to have this work out of the box and not have to set the target API.. I fixed 822 by using the updated manifest for gvr-permissionsupport-release.aar. I don't want to go through my code to support multiple controllers yet.\nI decided to request permissions on startup instead of during runtime. This goes against your own recommendations but is a better user experience. You really need to add in-VR runtime permissions requests where the user doesn't have to take off their headset..

    "areong": "Another solution is not to use the Runtime Permissions, which is not supported by Unity as described in https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/android-manifest.html, but to let the app request permissions on startup by adding the following line in the manifest:\njson\n<meta-data android:name=\"unityplayer.SkipPermissionsDialog\" android:value=\"false\" />\n(You can follow the section Overriding the Android Manifest in the link to modify the manifest.)\nUnity sets the value to true by default.

    "tedtheodore": "Was this introduced at all?. I also encountered this bug when using GoogleVR. Enabling VR disables your ability to edit the \"Default Orientation\" field in the \"Settings for iOS\" under \"Player Settings\". The way I solved this was to disable VR, set the Default Orientation to \"Landscape Left\" and then reenable VR. It looks like this should be fully overridden but it seems to be a bug.. A lot of trial and error!. Update:\nI'm now getting this to work consistently on iOS by waiting until XRSettings.enabled == true, before trying to call GvrCardboardHelpers.SetViewerProfile. \nI also modified GvrCardboardHelpers.cs to use gvr_refresh_viewer_profile from the DLL (as this was causing another bug where the view was using default parameters, even though the settings had the custom viewer set). \nDoing these same steps on Android however have not been successful. I've tried on an older device that doesn't come with VR Settings (a Galaxy Note 5) and a newer that does (Samsung Galaxy S8), neither do anything when calling GvrCardboardHelpers.SetViewerProfile. Both devices have been factory reset to ensure no profile previously loaded.. I've tried many attempts over the past week now with no success. This really should be looked at for Android. My app has read/write permissions as does Google VR, and Cardboard app for Daydream phones and still, calling GvrCardboardHelpers.SetViewerProfile does nothing. If I manually put current_device_params into /Cardboard/ onto the device, as soon as my app has read permission, the params are loaded correctly, but this is obviously not plausible in production.. I've just found after a device reset, if the phone DOES NOT yet have Google VR services installed, and an attempt is made to call GvrCardboardHelpers.SetViewerProfile the parameters WILL be set correctly. Then if Google VR Services is installed after this point, the parameters will then be lost. I have narrowed this down to the sole fact that Google VR Services doesnt have storage permissions. If this is manually given, the GvrCardboardHelpers.SetViewerProfile works fine. If Google VR Services prompts to give storage permissions by attempting to open the QR code reader, the call also works.\nI attempted to use GvrPermissionsRequester to try to get the permission when I start my app but this fails and seems to be Daydream only? \nWould be good to have a way to fire the permission request, or maybe if the params aren't stored on the SDCard?. I've noticed a user had the exact same problem as I'm facing in https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-android-sdk/issues/490 It seemed to go basically unresolved in December but since has been given a feature request tag in March... So fingers crossed!. The context for me is entirely the same as googlevr/gvr-android-sdk#490. We have our own hardware and app, and the intention is for our users to use our hardware without having to pair the viewer themselves, at the same time adhering to the Google standard of not strong arming the user into it, eg, if they have paired a viewer previously, then don't set by default.\nFor me, a session viewer profile would be fine, as long as the gvr_get_viewer_vendor and gvr_get_viewer_model calls are surfaced for the Unity SDK or some other call so that we can test if the viewer is/isn't a cardboard default. We would like to be flexible so that a VR \"power user\" can just use their own viewer without our intervention.. Thanks. What approach was taken in the end? I cant see it in the change log anywhere so not sure what calls we would use to do this.. If you can't reproduce it, as you say it might be a device thing, but past this it might be worth ensuring all the z rotations of your camera parents in scene are zeroed out. It might be worth reopening this, as it seems strange that having \"None\" in the list of XR Devices causes this framerate issue? Especially when its outlined in https://developers.google.com/vr/develop/unity/guides/hybrid-apps that it is required.. That's a great idea, cheers Adam. I'm glad you're following too! Yeah, it's a big deal for us. Thanks a lot for that! I think I will adopt this approach for the mean time and halt updates until its confirmed fixed.. ",

It's not noticeable when there is even the little movement, but when you leave controller on the table for example, the drift is apparent. . @vinhui  I tried using this, but then I don't know how to get PointerEventData for creating a raycast.\nHere in PerformRaycast, you need PointerEventData, Physics wants EventData too as I remember.\nBut event triggers functions receive EventData as a parameter (like 'Pointer Click').. Yep, just checked Physics.Raycast, and it doesn't need EventData. Don't know why I thought it needs.\nThanks !. Is there a way thought to do it with Gvr ? I would expect to have that functionality since there are methods for performing raycasts.. Yeah, but in 360 game you shouldn't be readjusting controller every 2 seconds. I believe there is a solution to this problem. In the game Wands on the Google Play market you can rotate yourself 360 degrees and controller arm moves with you. Although you cannot see the arm model directly, by rotating your head and trying to move controller you can notice that the arm model is being rotated too.. ",

Juli 2018 19:16:\n\n@zenhund74 https://github.com/zenhund74 I'm sorry you're having trouble\nwith the SDK.\nWhen in VR, field of view and lens distortion are dictated by the\nhardware: physical dimensions of the headset, position and shape of lenses,\netc. Different HMDs / viewers can and do have very different FOVs.\nThe reason Unity locks the FOV in VR to the headset's actual FOV, is that\nthe world wouldn't look like if you were able to adjust the camera FOV. You\nwould see the world \"swimming\" as you turn your head. That is, you'd find\nthat the world faster or slower than it should when you turn your head,\nwhich is the effect you'd see if you were say looking through a round fish\nbowl filled with water.\nThe easiest way to create a \"zoom\" effect is to use game object scale:\n\nCreate a new parent game object called, say, \"Camera Holder\".\nAttach the Main Camera and any of its sibling game objects under\n   the new \"Camera Holder\".\nAdjust the local scale of the \"Camera Holder\" to create the effect\n   of scaling the player relative to the world.\n\nThis has the effect of \"shrinking\" the player to be smaller (think seeing\nthe world as an ant would) or \"enlarging\" the player (think seeing the\nworld as a giant would).\nYou should find that this effectively changes how things look and is\nalmost like adjusting the FOV for flat screen content.\nHope that helps.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/issues/937#issuecomment-404245740,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AnM3TwE-LChv0-4eT8S5e5m-ERlJtmUDks5uFjLtgaJpZM4VKmh5\n.\n.

Also when I use a Main Camera and give it \"Both\" eyes in my scene,\nthe screen in the build will just stay black.\nIf I give it left or right eye it works fine.\nI uploaded my Unity project to my google drive, so you can take a look at\nit.\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1LFi0TTrWyr4n7LeUjrhd5ynsLn0k-4U9/view?usp=sharing\nSome short comments to the project:\n\n\nThe panorama pictures are imported as 8192 pxl texture so when you switch\nto Android in build settings, you have to make sure that Edit->Graphic\nEmulation is set to none as OpenGL ES 3.0 has a maximum of 4096 pixels.\n\n\nWhen you deactivate the main camera, set the left player camera to left\neye and the right camera to the right, the app is basicly working.\n\n\nProblem is, the cameras are a bit to far away from the \"screen\", the\ncylinder wall. When I make the cylinder bigger, the whole proportion of the\ntexture changes with the cylinder, so the resulting pictures stay the same.\n(Scaled Cylinder is under assets).\n\n\nAs you can see, I used a scaling script (only worked in the editor), I\ntried to enlengthen the \"neck\" vector in GVREditorEmulator Script(also\nworked in the editor), I tried to animate the camera position and\nparameters(as well), nothing reached my goal, to have the picture from the\ncamera a little bit bigger, so you don't see the ceiling and the floor,\nunless you loook up or down, like in the original cardboard camera app.\nI'm learning in a Unity course these days, and I cannot proceed with this\nproject, as it becomes to time consuming trying to find workarounds.\nMaybe you find a different way to deal with this problem. Render to texture\nwas my last idea how to solve.\nKind regards, Jens.\n2018-07-11 19:28 GMT+02:00 Jens Hellermann zenhund74@gmail.com:\n\nThank you very much for your answer. I will try it asap. (writing your own\nheadtracking algorithm is a little time consuming as well).\nQuaternation greetings, zenhund74.\nRus Maxham notifications@github.com schrieb am Mi., 11. Juli 2018 18:57:\n\nWhen you offer a script like the GvrEditorEmulator you should consider\nthat Unity has a logical parent / child structure where transforms from\nparent objects inherit to children. Your script does the very same, without\nshowing this in the Unity hierarchy.\nWe'll look into making this work more Unity-like.\nIt is absolutely non acceptable that the camera FOV parameters cannot be\ninfluenced at all anymore.\nThis is a feature of VR common to all VR SDKs. It is enforced at the\nUnity level, not our SDK. Camera projection params are dictated by the\ngeometry of the VR headset.

It was\nworking in the editor, but not in the build. Also, this is no explanation\nwhy important functions like rendering to texture don't work at all.\nYour SDK is buggy, not fully featured.\nKind regards, Jens.\n2018-07-12 20:08 GMT+02:00 Fred Sauer notifications@github.com:\n\nJens,\nInstead of using a render texture and additional cameras with custom FOV\n(which is going to lead to the feeling of the world \"swimming\" when users\nmove their head, can you try the steps I mentioned above?\nThe easiest way to create a \"zoom\" effect is to use game object scale:\n\nCreate a new parent game object called, say, \"Camera Holder\".\nAttach the Main Camera and any of its sibling game objects under\n   the new \"Camera Holder\".\nAdjust the local scale of the \"Camera Holder\" to create the effect\n   of scaling the player relative to the world.\n\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/issues/937#issuecomment-404600731,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AnM3TzfQnRweSeMxwX5RHZHUmmpWd25Yks5uF5CJgaJpZM4VKmh5\n.\n. \n",

What kind of info do you need?. @rusmaxham I cant share the bug report because there my private data =) But the conversation already closed and did not help to me.

And that message still doesn't help to me... In the same time that bug exists in Unity 2018.3.6f1. Deleting \"Textures\" directory only helps to me.\nHey,\nThere are a couple more things you could try resolving this. Some users have reported that the following helps:\n1) Delete the Library and Project Settings folder from your project folder and re-open the project\n2) As I can see from error.log this issue is caused by Ntdll.dll\nBelow there are few ways to fix it:\nCause of Ntdll.dll Errors\nThe causes of ntdll.dll error messages can vary greatly. However, most ntdll.dll errors result from a corrupt or\ndamaged version of the ntdll.dll file itself, corrupt hardware drivers, or issues between Windows and other\nprograms. Ntdll.dll errors can sometimes mean that a piece of hardware in your computer is malfunctioning, but this is rare.\nHow To Fix Ntdll.dll Errors\nRestart your computer. The ntdll.dll error you're receiving could be due to a one-time, temporary issue and a simple reboot may resolve the problem completely.\nReinstall the program if the ntdll.dll error only displays when you use a specific program.\nIf the software program has any updates or service packs available, install them too. The software's programmers may have identified an issue with the program that caused the ntdll.dll error and then issued a patch for it.\nNote: Third-party software programs that have been installed on your computer are almost always the cause of ntdll.dll errors. The remainder of these troubleshooting steps resolves ntdll.dll issues only rarely.\nCheck the Windows service pack level you're running and then check Microsoft's support site to see if there is a more recent service pack available for installation. Some issues that caused ntdll.dll errors have been corrected in these service packs from Microsoft.\nSelectively disable Internet Explorer add-ons. If your ntdll.dll error is displaying when you start, run, or close Internet Explorer, an add-on may be causing the problem. Disabling each add-on, one by one will determine which add-on is the culprit (if any).\nNote: As a workaround, assuming the ntdll.dll error really is Internet Explorer related, install and use a competing browser like Firefox.\nRename the NLSPATH system variable. If your Windows system does not have this environment variable, skip this step.\nNote: This is a troubleshooting step for this issue only. Be sure to set this path back to its original name if this does not resolve the ntdll.dll issue.\nDisable Data Execution Prevention for Explorer.exe. As in the previous step, this is for troubleshooting the ntdll.dll issue only. If this doesn't resolve the problem, return the Data Execution Prevention settings to their previous settings.\nUpdate drivers for any hardware in your computer where updated drivers are available. Outdated drivers sometimes cause ntdll.dll errors.\nTest your memory for damage. If you're receiving ntdll.dll messages, one possible cause could be a bad memory module in your system. Testing your memory will either identify a problem or clear your RAM of any responsibility.\nIf you encounter any other issues or have questions don't hesitate and reach out to us!. \n",

I now rely on my own tracking and am going to use a vertex warping shader instead (which will also lower overhead and suits my application better).. Ah, I wasn't sure GVR did that too (reprojection).
