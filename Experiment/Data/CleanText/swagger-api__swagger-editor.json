    "mohsen1": "Done with 80f16ff\n. @earth2marsh You can use /pet/{petId} with no problem. It's the same.\n. Duplicate of #24 \n. For starters we can persist the data on localStorage\n. I didn't have a chance to try your branch. What happens when I edit the title? Do you save a new YAML per key stoke?\n. Thank you for your work on this. We have a plan for having a backend for the editor so you save Swaggers in a database with versioning. We are interested in JSBin model where we use path params (UUID) for identifier and another path param for versioning. Doing too much in client side has less value since you can't share all of those saved YAMLs and also if in middle of editing title you might see another YAML magically appear because it matched the title. \n. Yes, I'm actually designing the backend API for such system. It's going to be very similar to JSBin. The way it works is, for the first time you visit editor it renders / for you. Then when you make changes, we automatically push URL state to /:id/1 where id is unique for your Swagger description. Now, every time you make changes, we update the content of the Swagger description in the DB. If you click save button, we save current document as final for version 1 and push URL state to /:id/2. \nThere is a bit more complexity to it, when you share your URL with someone else, if they make changes, because they don't have the \"ownership\" cookie in their browser we save that Swagger description as a new entity and push URL state to /:new-id/1 so people can't mess with each other Swagger specs.\nHere is the Swagger for API I explained above:\n``` yaml\nswagger: 2.0\ninfo:\n  version: \"1.0.0\"\n  title: Bins\n  description: An api for bins\npaths:\n  /:\n    get:\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: Renders empty bin\n    post:\n      parameters:\n        - name: body\n          in: body\n          schema:\n            type: string\n      responses:\n        200:\n          schema:\n            $ref: Bin\n          description: Makes a new bin\n/:id:\n    get:\n      responses:\n        200: \n          description: Gets latest version of the bin with id\n    post:\n      parameters:\n        - name: body\n          in: body\n          schema:\n            type: string\n      responses:\n        200:\n          schema:\n            $ref: Bin\n          description: Makes a new version of the bin\n    delete:\n      responses:\n        400:\n          description: Delete is not supported\n/:id/:version: \n    get:\n      responses:\n        200: \n          schema:\n            $ref: Bin\n          description: Gets a specific version of a bin\n    delete:\n      responses:\n        400:\n          description: Deletes is not supported\ndefinitions:\n  Bin:\n    properties:\n      uuid: \n        type: string\n      versions:\n        type: array\n        items:\n          $ref: Version\nVersion:\n    properties:\n      bin_id:\n        type: string\n      version:\n        type: integer\n      created_at:\n        type: Date\n      body:\n        type: string\n```\nFYI @earth2marsh \n@fehguy How can I describe that \"ownership cookie\" with Swagger?\n. Yes, if you have the link to your Swagger, you can navigate to it and start editing. You will get a new id and your version number starts from 1 again. \nIn very long run we can have user login and save documents under your user account.\n. Closing this since we discussed the plans and concerns already \n. Duplicate of #5 \n. Now works with YAML edits too\n. Related #81 \n. #81 will be ticket for this\n. @earth2marsh  :+1: good idea\n. @earth2marsh is this still relevant?\n. Not relevant anymore\n. @earth2marsh can you provide a link?\n. @earth2marsh Please make a simple example for this after specs issue resolved\n. $refs are now used for this\n. Duplicate of #25 \n. @earth2marsh These are the Regular Expressions that decides oauth2 is two tokens, a string token and a constant token:\n- String https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/blob/4d868a046ad9ad6352465b216d44fcb4df17df79/lib/ace/mode/yaml_highlight_rules.js#L72\n- Number https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/blob/4d868a046ad9ad6352465b216d44fcb4df17df79/lib/ace/mode/yaml_highlight_rules.js#L81\nTry changing those regex on your build and see if you can make that accept oauth2 is one string token. \nThese lines of code could be found at mode-yaml.js file in this app\n. @earth2marsh my bad, we are using the minified files of ace.\nTry changing this\n/bower_components/ace-builds/src-min-noconflict/mode-yaml.js\nIt doesn't worth setting up Ace build system. editing minified code is hard but it's just a try :)\n. @earth2marsh also, the regexs are cascading, the later they come in the array, the more powerful they are. \n. fixed by 73fdc92\n. @fehguy @earth2marsh I don't have access to that repo\n. #137 Related\n. very cool idea! :+1: \n. Duplicate of #81\n. Done\n. DONE!\n. There is no good AST parser for YAML out there\n. @MMux \n. @fehguy Sorry about this. \nDo a rm -rf node_modules and then npm run fix-coffee then it should work\n. @MMux any updates on this?\n. @fehguy This is great! I'm not sure if I can upload HTML5 file blobs via AJAX calls. But if that's possible, then we can have a button that uploads the JSON and downloads the zip file with a click of the button. \nI'll be looking into this. Please keep us updated if anything changed on your side. \n. @fehguy That's right. I saw curl and I thought it needs to be an actual file! I'll be experimenting with this asap\n. @fehguy Almost there. We only need CORS support on your end. To try it out, checkout deploy-wip branch and run it.\n. I'm using 'http://generator.helloreverb.com/online/api/gen/client/'\nPlease see here\n. @fehguy \nPlease see latest deploy-wip branch. I've updated it per your directions. I'm still getting CORS error\n. @fehguy for some reason I thought jQuery's setting for method is actually method. It's type!\n83334e0 fixes it. \nNow we are getting 500.\nIt's either the YAML file or backend has some errors. \n. @fehguy It's now in gh-pages. I had to write this hacky code to make it work:\n92705f1\nI need to get those properties from specs itself. Please guide me how can I do that?\nThis is going to be first Transform Filter we add to project. A Transform Filter is simply modifies the YAML generated JSON to JSON that Swagger apps accept. That way we can keep YAML clean yet having functional JSON output. \n. @earth2marsh \n- [x] Theme is donw\n- [ ] The syntax highlighter will eventually get merged and we will get it too. We removed node_modules from repo so it's not possible to do that hack anymore\n. I think the model wrapper is just necessary for your generators. We don't need those. One solution modify the JSON we get from editor to have model key (which should include everything in editor).\nI'm not sure about opts key.\n@earth2marsh Can you comment on this?\n. @fehguy is it a js-yaml bug? \n. @fehguy the js-yaml maintainer is not actively supporting browser version\nWe are using yaml-js. Could you confirm that it's a yaml-js issue?\n. Related #15 \n. @fehguy Is this still a valid issue? \n. The resolver is now implemented and resolves all $ref references. Please open a new issue if there's anything else wrong with $refs\n. We support non-Chrome browsers now\n. Yes! It's the right way! YAML is the way!\n. Hi @fehguy \nPlease check the default yaml file in spec-files folder. There should be models in there. \n. There is also a default_full.yaml that contains everything. You can switch to that in app.js \n. @fehguy Please comment when code-gen stuff are ready for v2\n. Done by f82c2bf\n. @fehguy Please comment here if Server generation is done for v2\n. Done by 81cbf92\n. This is done. Now you can import YAML or JSON form file system of from a URL. \n. @ch3sn3k We are not maintaining version 1.2 anymore. please try it with version 2 and let me know if you still have issues. \n. @ch3sn3k \nHere you can preview of the editor \nhttp://mohsen1.github.io/Swagger-Editor-2-Preview\nHere is the working group\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!forum/swagger-workgroup\nHere is the new specs GitHub repo:\nhttps://github.com/reverb/swagger-spec\n. I agree, multiline strings are looking better. Note that we parse multi-line strings of description to markdown when making HTML docs  which we haven't documented.\n. Fixed by cafd65b\n. We redesigned the preview pane. Please take a look at the preview here:\nmohsen1.github.io/Swagger-Editor-2-Preview\n. I implemented markdown support from scratch.  This issue is fixed by cafd65b\n\n. I just ran the app on a new machine with no problem. Maybe your port 9000 is acting weird or something. Try changing the port number in Gruntfile.js line 72. If that didn't help, Remove the CNAME file from app folder. That might be another root of this problem. \n. The master branch is a work in progress toward compatiblity with Swagger 2 specs. However you can checkout aa691cc and branch out from there if you want to work on 1.2 stuff.\n. should we ignore any key with X- and x- prefix? Both in paths and operations of the path?\n. Fixed by e59e08b\n. If there was an error (while user is typing) don't be too fast to report the error. \n. Done.\n. We don't minify code anymore. \n. Resolved by 59e0cf0\n. Almost done. There are some weirdness when keys are quoted that needs looking at. Making it P2 to revisit later\n. @MMux could you please take care of this? \nThe new menu might fixed it already.\n. Fixed by bbd8b83\n. It's a js-yaml issue, I'm opening an issue there \nhttps://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml/issues/138\n. Closing because it's unresolvable \n. @marcellodesales is editor 1.2 necessary anymore? Can we close this?\n. :+1: \n. Fixed\n. #109 is related \n. Subpath navigations are gone. Navigation is now based on folds and jumps\n. Yes, that's the plan\n. @earth2marsh @fehguy \nThis feature has been implemented. Please note that you will need a # before ? because it's an Angular app. For example this url will work:\nhttp://editor.swagger.wordnik.com/#?import=http://generator.wordnik.com/online/api/swagger.yaml\nEdit: updating the url to use import instead \n. @earth2marsh Now it's striping the query param. With 4678015\n. Done with https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-editor/commit/194e4036b07b472a22c1c2f3c0abd943bdc1654e\n. If we store specs in an array, angular would not be able to refresh content of the preview pane without re-rending all of it. \n. With 1 second delay in rendering this issue seems to be resolved\n. Fixed by 3d9cfb9\n. Done\n. @earth2marsh Please update this array according to files we have in spec-files folder so they show up in open example dialog \n. Looks good. \nI'm merging it \n. This should also disable \"jump \u2020o\" links from preview\n. @erikvanzijst for now you can build a custom editor with a branding.css that hides the editor pane and the top menu bar. Please read the configuration guide\n. Now that you can change the theme, its easy to choose a higher contrast theme. \n. \ud83d\udc4d\nScroll synchronization is in my plans. Because each pane has different height, it's a bit more complicated than just syncing scrollTops. It would be very similar to StackEdit \nhttps://stackedit.io/editor\n. The AST I worked on is really paying off. I just implemented this feature using row information we have for paths. Check it out here \nhttp://editor.swagger.wordnik.com/\nClick on pen button next to each path to jump to it's line \n. Same deal for operations now. Check it out in gh-pages \nThanks @fehguy.\n. @jwest-apigee Does the new approach help in this case?\n. @jwest-apigee shall we close this issue? It's working fine with that file now \n. We have \"Jump to\" links in place. Those will help navigation in a large file. I'm opening another ticket for parallel scrolling so we can prioritize it. \n. #137 \n. Command+L will bring up \"Go to line\" if you're inside the editor. Go-to-line link for YAML error is a great idea. I'll implement it. \nFYI: Here is all keyboard shortcuts\nhttps://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/wiki/Default-Keyboard-Shortcuts\n. @MMux Looks good. The only issue is apigee-127-branding.scss indentation . Can you re-indent the files and push to this branch your changes?\n. LGTM\n. @MMux did some styling on this area. It looks much better than before. This one slipped. Either me or Mike will fix it today \n. What are steps to reproduce? Delete responses line?\n. @jwest-apigee  0e1c06f should've fixed it already. I just pushed a new build to npm. Please close this issue if it's not happening anymore. \n. @MMux Please remove your changes to defaults.js. We can't change that.\n. LGTM\n. Can you please be little more specific? What was your YAML? What went wrong?\n. @miguelpuyol Thank you for providing this feedback. \n- The initial state is addressed here at #131 \n- I wasn't aware of the issues with Ubuntu and Windows. This ticket is for that: #132\n- Our default YAML files are not perfect at the moment. Those errors are normal because Swagger specs is changing too. We will fix them when we launched it. #136 addresses this //cc @earth2marsh \n. I'm closing this since we have a ticket for each issue reported here.\n. LGTM. \nThe app/styles/header.scss is extra. I'm deleting it. Make sure next time it's not there \n. Are you removing those arrows altogether? \nIf yes, please remove the image files and CSS related to it too.\n. Tested on Windows and Ubuntu (Chrome). Works for me\n. Is this for when you're using it with A127?\n. @earth2marsh ping!\n. LGTM. \nThis is great! Keep in mind we can use unicode characters in this app too. No need for HTML escaping.\n. Duplicate of #27 \n. \n. @earth2marsh yup. there is jump to link for yaml errors.\n. Done by cafd65bb4aaeb472b5f24a4007a0d44301dcccf4\n. By #186 we will allow user to customize keyboard bindings. I'm closing this issue because we don't want to manipulate Ace defaults \n. If Ace defaults are wrong then that's an Ace issue. changing one setting from many doens't seem rational. They override a lot of browser defaults like \u2318,.\nhttps://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/wiki/Default-Keyboard-Shortcuts\n. Related\nhttps://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/issues/640\n. LGTM\n. Good!\n. Why do we want client warp the specs in another object? Wouldn't it be more straightforward if it accepts pure swagger?\n. Vendor extensions are good for those kind of stuff. You can ask clients to provide those vendor extensions \n. Makes sense. Can you rename model to swagger? model is less intuitive. \n. What endpoint should I call to get the endpoints?\n. @fehguy Please review this commit 81cbf9238512153ba0aae68327be89564f8f5ebc\nMenu items are now being generated off of the API response.\nI get 500 errors when I hit the API for actual server or clients. Please try it in gh-pages\n. Fixed by 37482ee\n. I did it already. I applied your color adjustments. Closing this\n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. This only address renaming. Please open another ticket for striping the query param. \nThis looks good. Merging \n. It's how JSYAML converts 2. For now, you can use\nyaml\nversion: 2.0\nThis would output string. \nWe should manually convert the number to string \n. @webron I agree. We will add a specific treatment for fields that should be string. It will always dump those fields as string. re-opening \n. You're right. I'll fix it\n. @fehguy It seems that this is a schema error. The consumes at line 222 doesn't allow additional items but at line 44 does. \nDo we have to disallow additional items for array types?\n. @fehguy I use tv4 JSON Schema validator. Maybe something is being lost during YAML->JSON conversation. My guess is, the array being converted to an object with number keys. I need to look into it.  \nAfter all, why should root level consumes allow additional properties? \n. Thanks everyone for providing feedback. This issue is solved by updating schema to the latest (c4566c0)\n@fehguy I also added the mechanism to get the latest schema on the fly from a URL(7ee8a59). Please let me know if you are hosting the schema somewhere CORSable so I can put in the settings file and load the schema from there. \n. Where should I pull the schema from? I already implemented this. The URL to pull from is missing. \n. @fehguy I think updating schema on the fly without clear versioning can lead to confusion. How about using this from NPM here and you guys push patches to NPM?\n. Cool. Thanks!\n. @WhitneyLand I completely understand your frustration. Right now, because we don't have any backend all of the import job is being done in client side. As part of the import, we wanted to clean up query param from the URL. If we do that without a hash change a redirect will happen which is not optimal. I am working on a backend for the editor. After that is done, the import will be a real query parameter and it will redirect to a unique URL where your imported file stored. For now, we will continue to have import as this. I agree that we need to update the documentation to make it clear. Specially that it's not very common to use a fake query param after hash in a URL.\n. Here I explained my plan \nhttps://github.com/wordnik/swagger-editor/issues/5#issuecomment-55490383\n. @SimonTurner0 does your endpoint accept cross origin request?\n. I don't see any error when I paste that YAML.\n. This is fixed by latest schema\n. Purpose of the empty doc error is for when you use the app in 'docs only mode' which is not implemented yet. I guess we shouldn't show this error in editor mode since it's easy to see the side pane is empty!\n. I believe it's by design. In Swagger schema type isn't required.\nhttps://github.com/reverb/swagger-spec/blob/master/schemas/v2.0/schema.json#L367\n/cc @fehguy \n. Hey @webron could you confirm this is by design? \n. Shows up for me \n\n. You don't need the schema key for nesting schemas. If you do something like this it will work:\nyaml\ndefinitions:\n  Address: \n    properties:\n      street:\n        type: string\n        description: Description \n      phone:\n        $ref: Phone\n  Phone:\n    properties:\n      home:\n        type: string\n      cell:\n        type: string\nThe Schema renderer in operation fail to resolve secondary $ref which is an issue. I will look into it.\n. Thanks! Please give me some time to review this.\n. I merged this PR manually with rebase. Thanks!\n. We switched from regular bootstrap to scss version without changing the bower.json file. Thanks for pointing out. \n. PR Please!\n. :+1: \n. 0aded6d fixed this \n. Why did you have to do this?\nWe don't want to fix the version numbers in bower or npm jsons. \n. This is what I get for bower info bootstrap-sass-official \n```\nAvailable versions:\n  - 3.2.0+2\n  - 3.2.0\n  - 3.2.0+1\n  - 3.1.1+2\n  - 3.1.1+1\n  - 3.1.1\n  - 3.1.0+2\n  - 3.1.0\n  - 3.0.3-0\n  - 2.0.3\n  - 2.0.2\n  - 2.0.1\n  - 2.0.0\n  - 1.4.4\n  - 1.4.3\n  - 1.4.2\n  - 1.4.1\n  - 1.4.0\n  - 1.3.2\n  - 1.3.1\n  - 1.3.0\n  - 1.2.1\n  - 1.2.0\nYou can request info for a specific version with 'bower info bootstrap-sass-official#'\n```\nSeems like 3.2.0+2 is a valid version. We can use ^3.2.* (version 3.2 and higher with any minor patch) to be on the safe side.\n. You can download the YAML file to your disk but because it's a web app it can't manipulate that file on your disk. We are working on a backend that saves your YAML in a database and give you a unique link to it. That is coming soon \n. @dnephin Swagger Editor can use a backend for saving and loading yaml content. All you need to do is to configure defaults.js. Please look at apigee-127.js for an example\n. I worked on a backend to integrate that with the editor. It's here https://github.com/mohsen1/anybin\nI might put the backend and editor together at some point but for now GitHub is a great idea. I will explore the idea of saving it to a GitHub Gist via their API. You get the versioning too which is great!\n. Swagger Editor can use a backend but it doesn't have a backed nor it is planned yet. \n. I believe the parameters should be in the root of the document (same level as paths) and you need to refer to them with full path instead of a shorthand path. Something like this:\nyaml\npaths:\n  /:\n    get:\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description:  List all pets\n    post:\n      parameters:\n        $ref: \"#parametes/Pet\"\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: Make a new pet\n    put:\n      parameters:\n        $ref: \"#parametes/Pet\"\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: Updates the pet\nparameters:\n      - name: Pet\n        in: body\n        description: The pet JSON you want to post\n        schema:\n          $ref: '#/definitions/Pet'\n        required: true\n. I didn't know that. The $ref resolver really don't know about the schema. It just walks the tree with the given path. With that, you need to have the full path from root in your $ref value. It should work. \n. This has been fixed by 0aded6d and 8937fcc \nFor the record, this is working example for using $ref in parameters:\n``` yaml\nswagger: 2\ninfo:\n  version: 0.0.0\n  title: test\npaths:\n  /:\n    get:\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description:  List all pets\n      parameters:\n        -\n          $ref: \"#/parameters/Pet\"\n    post:\n      parameters:\n        -\n          $ref: \"#/parameters/Pet\"\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: Make a new pet\n    put:\n      parameters:\n        -\n          $ref: \"#/parameters/Pet\"\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: Updates the pet\nparameters:\n  Pet:\n    name: Pet\n    in: body\n    description: The pet JSON you want to post\n    schema:\n      $ref: Pet\n    required: true\ndefinitions:\n  Pet:\n    required:\n      - id\n      - name\n    properties:\n      id:\n        type: integer\n        format: int64\n      name:\n        type: string\n      tag:\n        type: string\n``\n. External$refs are not implemented yet. I'll implement it in near future\n. You probably wasn't able to install bower components successfully because of #168. That issue is no solved. Please try again and let me know if you still have the same issue.\n. You better ask this question in Swagger working group here:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/swagger-swaggersocket\n:smile: \n. Thanks for making the container. Since there is your name as maintainer in docker container details I need to confirm with @fehguy before merging this.\n. Here is the file name\nhttps://github.com/wordnik/swagger-editor/blob/master/app%2Fscripts%2Fcontrollers%2Fheader.js#L136\n. You're right. Let me look into this.\n. You are using shorthand$refsyntax which only works if your definition that you are referring to is indefinitionsarray (root level).\nFor parameters it's necessary to have full path in your$ref`.\nSee this example:\n``` yaml\nExample YAML for the bare minimum of required elements\nswagger: 2.0\ninfo:\n  version: \"1.0.0\"\n  title: petstore\nparameters:\n  productId: \n       name: productId\n       in: path\n       type: string\n       required: true\npaths:\n  /users:\n    get:\n      parameters:\n        -\n          $ref: '#/parameters/productId'\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          description:  Describe the 200 response in more detail\n```\nThe resolver can be smart and lookup $refs that are in parameters array of a path in parameters:(root) but I'm not sure if that breaks the specs. Even our shorthand syntax for definitions is not standard according to JSON Schema but at least that is documented.\nThis is second time I see users are confused by this. @fehguy What you think about this? Should we make Resolver smarter and document it or remove shorthand syntax altogether? Currently it's a little confusing.\n. It's fixed by 0aded6d and 8937fcc\n. @NikolaySl please refresh the page when you see this issue. That issue will get resolved in the next release\n. Hi @krallin This is a Swagger Tools issue. Could you please open a new ticket?\n. LGTM\n. They already fixed it with newer Schema. I just updated the schema on the editor. It should work now.\nFYI it's this regex responsible for this kind of issues\nhttps://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec/blob/master/schemas%2Fv2.0%2Fschema.json#L65\n. There is a definition of tag in swagger specs that allow you to group endpoints with them. They are not exclusive so an endpoint can be in two or more tags. This is not implemented in editor yet. But it's planned.\nhttps://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec/blob/master/schemas/v2.0/schema.json#L517\n. Tags are now implemented \n. @mattaylor after autocomplet and try-operation this would be next. I would say two weeks. \n. My plan is to show tags of operations as little badges in operation body. You can click on each tag to filter every endpoint in document. Kind of like navigating to that specific tag. Very similar to tags in GitHub issues. SwaggerUI treat tags like folders but that is not working well when you have an operation under multiple tags. GitHub tags models fits better. Your input on this is welcomed.\n. Yes, we will have a list of all tags on top of rendered document. You can click on it and filter down operations to that tag. GitHub has a list of tags too. It's kind of hidden. For example, this: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/labels\n. Now you can filter down operations with one or more tags\n1d56070 Closed this\n. @mattaylor Done! :sunglasses: \n. Multiple tags is supported in URL. You can specify multiple tags comma separated. Like ?tags=One,Two. \nI'll fix the empty whitespace ASAP.\n. @pward123 Thanks for pointing out. I'll take care of it\n. This is done\n. I'll create a separate ticket for file upload \n. That's a spec and swagger ui bug!\nSchema says (or at least should say) it should be an string \nhttps://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec/blob/master/schemas%2Fv2.0%2Fschema.json#L16\nYou can't have 2.0 as an number type in JSON. It has to be a string\n. You're correct, specs have a bug. You should open a ticket there. \ndefaults.js is here https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-editor/blob/master/app/scripts/enums/defaults.js\nbtw you can lookup files if you are in repository homepage and press t key\n. This is a weird situation because { \"num\": 2.0} is indeed valid JSON but almost any tool will convert it to { \"num\": 2} if it process it because in JavaScript 2.0 === 2. \n. Fixed by 3ed65729c75ecdae35b4eed6cb77de95c0f952a0 and 00252589622d8a4cfb0d5bf34f1c80726ed5dee4\n. did you npm install and bower install before doing grunt serve?\n. I just tried it with a fresh clone. Please do this:\nrm -rf node_modules app/bower_components; git pull origin master; npm i; bower i\nthen grunt serve should work\n. I'm closing this issue since I tested running the editor from a clean clone. Please re-open if you still have this issue\n. Duplicate of #27\n. https://www.npmjs.org/package/swagger-editor is the output and this is the source https://www.npmjs.org/package/swagger-editor-src\nI guess you want the first one \n. I pushed the source to swagger-editor@2.6.1 and 2.6.2 by mistake. Please get 2.6.3. It only includes dist\n. @robertlevy that didn't happen for me\nPlease npm cache clear to make sure your cache is up to date\n. Duplicate for #310 \n. :+1: \nI deployed a set of new files. Maybe it was that\n. It should work with latest. My plan is to internalize all global dependencies so you can just npm start and use the editor. It's going to use grunt and bower from it's own node_modules. \n. @dnephin Thanks for this PR. I'm making some modifications to the README while I'm merging this.\nPlease take a look and let me know if you're okay with this:\nhttps://github.com/wordnik/swagger-editor/blob/dnephin-config_docs/README.md\n. @dnephin Cool. Fixed those issues and also Node.js version you brought up in the comments in my other commit. Merged to master.\nThanks!\n. Good catch! Will fix it ASAP\n. @dnephin #201 for that error. \nThis is going to be both Swagger UI and Swagger Editor moving forward. That's why I'm defaulting to the UI mode to make sure everything is working \n. @dnephin We are not yet confirmed that this as  \"the plan\". I'm doing this \"UI Mode\" as a proof of concept. Right now Swagger Editor missing some features from Swagger UI. Specially in try operation part. So let's see if this get approved. I guess we will have a discussion in WG about this. \n//cc @earth2marsh \n. Sauce laps is very unstable. I want to move this to use xvfb. We definitely need more unit tests. \nRight now test is just checking if there is any console errors. But we need more tests.\n. For angular we use Karma that launches a real browser (or phantom, but phantom is problematic). But running Xvfb on travis is a piece of cake. Look at this for example:\nhttps://github.com/mohsen1/json-schema-view/blob/master/.travis.yml\n. We moved away from that renderer. It was pretty dumb! Please use this renderer that I published (if you're using AngularJS)\nhttps://github.com/mohsen1/json-schema-view\nWe are using the same renderer in the editor now\n. Also, the resolver was updated to support nested $refs. Please use the latest \n. I'm closing this issue since we resolved these issues in latest version. Please upgrade to latest if you are using NPM. \n. Solved by swagger tools way of reporting this\n.  @maxlinc The Schema has changed and apparently it's using external $refs in multiple places. There are couple of issues with that\n- swagger.io is not XHRable https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec/issues/163\n-  http://json-schema.org/ is not XHRable either. I'll ask swagger spec to remove those references \n- Resolver goes to an infinite loop with circular refs. I'll fix this one\n. @maxlinc This has been solved. I refactored validator to use Swagger Tools. Please try again in http://editor.swagger.wordnik.com/#/edit or get the latest via NPM\n. It also works in offline mode because Swagger Tools do cache the schema\n. Good catch. Will fix it asap. PRs are welcomed too!\n. I belive it's an issue with resolver that tries to append #/definitions to \"short-hand\" $refs. \nhttps://github.com/wordnik/swagger-editor/blob/master/app/scripts/services/resolver.js#L89-L101\nWill look into it.\n. I can't reproduce this. Could you paste your YAML here?\n. This is a bug in Swagger Tools(https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools/issues/53) \nFor now please embed your model.\nYou can use parameterDefinitions for reusable parameters then use them with $ref. You don't have to use YAML anchors which doesn't translate to JSON\n. @BigstickCarpet I just pushed a new version of the editor. Please try again and let me know if that solved your problem \n. :+1: \n. No, we don't have this feature yet. you can use #/prevew to get the preview of the docs. But no static HTML yet \n. @SirWellington @jitin-sameer This feature has been added. Click File>Download HTML to get the docs as a stand-alone document \n. @rafaferreira Please use Swagger UI for rendering the UI.\n. Swagger Editor can export your specs JSON. Use that JSON to render your UI using Swagger UI. Read swagger ui docs for more information \n. This feature was removed\n. Swagger UI is the one for rendering the UI but if you you can \"cheat\" and serve entire Swagger Editor with a custom CSS that hides editor parts. Learn about configuring Swagger Editor in the configuration docs\n. Resolver get into an infinite loop with that. I'm looking into using jjv for resolving $refs\n. 315c895 is a dirty fix for now. It will not make circular references in you model. Hopefully with using jjve this will get resolved \n. @intrz if client code gen is failing please file a ticket with your swagger spec in https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen\n. This is done\n. Works for me at http://editor.swagger.wordnik.com/#/edit\nAre you trying the editor from there?\n. grunt serve is meant for development. You are serving non-minified code. Better option is to build the project and use a http server. Try following:\nInstall http-server\nsh\nnpm install -g http-server\nsh\ncd swagger-editor\ngrunt build \ncd dist\nhttp-server -p 8080\nYou can use on any port you want. I used 8080 as an example.\n. dist is all static HTML. You can serve it with any http server \n. I'll look into it but for now you can do the following to get it running:\nsh\nnpm i -g grunt-cli bower\nnpm i\nbower i\ngrunt server\n. The npm start command uses local bower at node_modules but Bower uses a beforeInstall script and install a different set of files on Windows when installed globally. The best way for windows is to install bower and grunt globally. Readme is updated to address this. \n. do you use any $ref in your model? Could you paste your model here?\n. It's an issue in resolver. We are replacing the resolver with Swagger Tools resolver. As soon as Swagger Tools resolver is ready,  I will replace it with that. For now, between infinite loop in circular dependency and shallow $ref resolving I chose the later. It will get fixed soon.\n//cc @whitlockjc\n. @DavidPautet @majgis This issue has been resolved with the latest release. Please try your code again.\n. The Try-It functionality is under development. Please try the latest at master branch if you want to see how it's being developed. It should be in a ready to use state by end of next week. \n. This issue has resolved \n. :+1: \n. correct swagger declaration is this\nyaml\nswagger: '2.0'\n. You version of editor is very old. It might be using the old schema. Please update your global apigee-127 module via npm.\n. Please update to 0.6.3 globally. \n. @joseflexa Your issue is addressed here: https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools/issues/60\n. Errors and warnings come from SwaggerTools\n/cc @whitlockjc \n. @paraskakis Here is how $ref in JSON work:\nIf you intial JSON is like this:\njson\n{\"my-property\": { \"$ref\": \"some-url\"}}\nand some-url resolves to \"my-value\", the object wrapping $ref will get replaced with \"my-value\" resulting to this:\njson\n{\"my-property\":  \"my-value\"}\nReplacing range:\n{\"my-property\": { \"$ref\": \"some-url\"}}\n                ^                   ^\n                |                   |__ to here\n                |\n                |______________________ from here\n. @maxlinc there is a plan to host Swagger documents in a database and have unique URLs for each one of the. I made the backend here but hasn't connected the dots to make Swagger Editor to use that. \nThis issue will go away once we serve Swagger Editor with that backend \n. The way anybin works is it saves an ownership cookie in your browser when you create a bin so you can write to the bin. If someone else without that cookie want to write to the bin, it will make a new bin based on original bin. Kind of like forking. There is also versioning. Every time users clicks \"Save milestone\" a new version of bin is saved and state of the bin is locked down. And because URLs are not sequential unless you give your bin's URL to someone they can't really find it (security! \ud83d\udd13) \n. This is done\n. Do you have a backend server running? You need to have a server that accepts PUT calls on backendEndpoint address. See apigee-127 config for example\n. Yes. It can accept YAML if you enable the flag for it. Otherwise JSON works by default.\n. Thanks! Your fix is now live\n. It's a known issue.\nI'm working on refactoring Try-it. Check it out here\n. Yes, \"try operation\" is under development. I'll update this issue when basic functionality is there. As of 2448382 if response is being rendered. \n. This issue has been resolved by recent developments \n. Thanks for reporting. This is a valid bug. I'll look into it. \n. @steve165 Yes, please open a new issue for that.\n if it's possible, could you paste your YAML and version of editor you are using? \n. This has been resolved. Please try your YAML again and re-open if you're still seeing this issue\n. @carlskii security in \"try this operation\" of the editor is under development. For now, in master we only render your security definitions in the preview pane. We also have an example for security. It's here: \nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/app/spec-files/security.yaml\n. This is done\n. Could you give us more details? \n. If you are using \"Try Operation\" features, it's under development. If you define schemes in your API, you could define an API uses both HTTP and HTTPS. I'll keep you posted when schemes can be selected in \"Try Operation\".\nBecause it's a browser app, you can add your self signed certificates to your browser.\n. There is a bug that requires you to refresh the app. I'm aware of that and will fix it. but for now, please refresh the page and see if problem still exists \n. It works with index too. You just need to refresh. I'm updating Swagger Tools in next release. The refresh issue will get resolved by then\n. From Swagger 2.0 specs standpoint yes, you can. You can have $refs to external files. For example, if your parameters_common.yaml is living in the same folder that your main YAML file is living then you can include that files like this:\nyaml\nswagger: '2.0'\nparameters: \n  $ref: parameters_common.yaml\npaths: \n ...\nYour parameters_common.yaml would be just the array of parameters \nyaml\n- name: param_one\n...\n- name: param_two\n...\nThis works fine in current editor if you host the editor yourself so parameters_common.yaml path can get resolved as an HTTP path. Currently there is no way to jump between files or create a new one.\nIf you are doing a big project with Swagger, I recommend hosting the editor yourself. When editor and the API you are building are on the same origin, XHR call don't have to be cross-origin which help editor to show more details about calls in \"try-operation\" and your API doesn't have to have cross origin headers.\n. @newmanw Generators for 2.0 usually get one big specs file. If you have multiple files linked to each other (via $ref) you would need to resolve those links and make a large specs file then send it to generator.\n. We thought about it and decided to not make an IDE from Swagger Editor. Swagger Editor can resolve remote and relative $refs. So if you want to have multiple files, host the editor and use a relative path in your $ref to refer to another file hosted in your server. (For example $ref: /my-model.yaml)\nThere is no end in making Swagger Editor similar to an IDE. \nEven with this decision in place, you are more than welcome to spend the time and implement this feature. After all this is an open source project. \n. I'v written about current state of multi-file Swagger in this blog post\n. Supporting multi-file in editor is something I want to see also. We're discussing it here\nMaybe json-refs should allow resolving only file refs and leaving refs with fragment URLs alone. @whitlockjc maintains json-refs.\n. Linting errors from formdata.js are fixed by 162890e. Sorry about that\n. Looks good to me! \n. Since we introduced edit and preview modes, you have to use either edit or preview in your path before import. Here is an example:\nhttp://editor.swagger.io/#/edit?import=http://generator.wordnik.com/online/api/swagger.yaml\n. :+1: \n. We are now reporting correct error in situation like this. For example if you have following YAML:\n``` yaml\npaths:\n  /products/{productId}:\n    get:\n```\nYou will see this error: \nSwagger Error\nAPI requires path parameter but it is not defined: productId\nat paths \u25b9 /products/{productId}\nDetails\n Object\n swaggerError: Object\n errors: Array [1]\n warnings: Array [0]\n. One of the plans is to package Swagger Editor as a Chrome Packaged App. That can resolve all these CORS issues. This is a long term plan actually.\n. Thanks for reporting this. I'm working on try operation right now. Will fix it ASAP.\n. This issue should be resolved by now. Please let me know if you are still experiencing this\n. @rocktmn1 I don't see any error in editor.swagger.io with that block. If you're running a local copy, please update to latest\n. Swagger specs does not support anyOf and oneOf. For rendering the schema json-schema-view. An issue is open there for this already. \n. This was fixed. see #272 \n. What is your consumes for the operation you are trying? You can have consumes: [ \"application/json\" ] for that operation. Body format is for form data versus encoded URI in POST body. If you select \"raw\", it should respect your consumes value. \n. a3fb3f10774bb18df11d3845377c6c12ed1f1f70 should've fixed this. Please re-open if you're still having this problem \n. Do you mean it's not being POSTed or you can't even paste it in the textarea?\n. I can't reproduce it. It's working for me. Are using latest from master?\n. I'm closing this issue. If you are still having this issue, please re-open\n. @evil-shrike I'm using Swagger Tools for error reporting. Please follow up this issue in this bug report https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools/issues/72\n. This issue has been resolved \n. It has security issues to deal with. Closing for now. Will re-open if anyone asked for this feature.\n. Now raw body does not conflict with regular params\n. 641b1f247ee64a421b97469e0450a507d1c63340 Fixed this\n. Nice! \n. I can't access your links. Could you try from an outside network and make sure your links are accessible from outside? \n. Different ports are different origins. As long as we import using client side code we can't import files from servers with no CORS support. In future I will add an optional backend for swagger editor so user can import non-CORSable files via backend. \n. @whitlockjc This is a Swagger Tools bug I believe. tags on operations are allowed.\n. tags is not allowed in info. It should be in the root of your document \n. :+1: \n. Unfortunately a web app can not really know if an XHR call failed because there was a cross-origin error. See this  bin for example. \nI agree that we can do better for error reporting when import fails. I will update this issue when I added a better error reporting for failed imports.\n. With 0f53058 CORS errors are gone! Please try again! \n. For you situation I can make this link configurable so you can have your own CORS resolver. How's that? \n. e80c6c6 should resolve this issue. Please close if it's sufficient \n. Persisting the editor options is planned. Font size should be valid CSS font size value, i.e 15px. I will add specific menu commands for bumping font size (#255)\n. Should get fixed by #384 \n. This is an issue with $ref-resolver which is part of Swagger Tools. Temporarily you can refresh the page to get fully resolved $refs. We will fix this in the next release\n. This issue has been resolved. \n. This is a bug for Swagger Tools. We will replace our internal resolver with Swagger Tools in the next release. This issue hopefully will get resolved with that.\nAre you aware that you are missing definitions that you have $ref to in your API?\n. This has been resolved. Your YAML has some errors but it doesn't get stuck \n. Unfortunately you can't import from raw.githubusercontent.com because it's not accepting cross origin requests. Swagger Editor is a web app and is limited to cross origin policies. \nwadl2swagger looks very nice. Will check it out! \n. @maxlinc Now I use a service to make non-CORSable endpoints CORSable. The code is here and it's running on Heroku. \n. A lot of people faced the CORS issue with imports so I had to solve it. It's a quick and dirty fix. I will eventually replace it with an Apigee proxy that's much faster and can have spike arrest. \n. Why do you have parameters key in you path? ~~AFIAK any key in a path, other than vendor extensions are considered operations~~\nEdit: I was wrong, you can have parameters \n. This is most likely because the schema in Swagger Tools is not up to date. //cc @whitlockjc \n. @whitlockjc Please take a look at this YAML. The original issue is fixed but now I see a new error. \n. YAML is really just a syntax sugar on top of Swagger 2.0 JSON specification. There is a 1-to-1 mapping from YAML to generated JSON in Swagger Editor.\n. This feature has been added. In Mode menu select Disable Live Render\n. Thanks for your PR. This has been resolved by 70e8ad8\n. Empty spaces\n. Yes, it's a known bug. Please sit tight for next release of Swagger Tools. It's going to get resolved with that.\n. This has been resolved with the latest release\n. Swagger Tools we use in editor is using an old schema. It will get fixed when I update the Swagger Tools dependency \n. This was fixed by updating the Swagger Tools. Please try your Swagger document again at editor.swagger.io. It should not have this issue anymore.\n. https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#response-object-\n. This was fixed by updating the Swagger Tools. Please try your Swagger document again at editor.swagger.io. It should not have this issue anymore.\n. 0.0.0.0 was selected for Docker container. I will look into this. It should run on Windows without modifications.\n. I changed docker internal port to 80. You probably need sudo\n. It's because json-schema-view directive does not support allOf yet. https://github.com/mohsen1/json-schema-view/issues/1\n. This was fixed from upstream \n\n. @bagofjuice that issue has moved here https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/476\n. @SirWellington We are working on a convertor that converts 1.2 to 2.0. Do you want to contribute to the project? I can add you to the project.\n. @SirWellington Please review this project and let me know if you have any questions. I just started it. It will convert 1.2 to 2.0. \n. Thanks!\n. Designer has not yet implemented. Contributions are welcome! \n. Hi @EricWittmann! I'm glad you're interested in helping. The plan is to have some UI controls like buttons for manipulating the swagger specs from preview panel. For example in parameters table, at the end of the table there should be button that says \"add a new parameter\" and clicking that button opens up a modal that has a form for making a new parameter (with all possible ways of making a parameter of course). Then after a parameter is created by that modal, we need to put that parameter back to specs. In case of JSON, it's simple because there is no comments and styling in JSON and regenerating all of JSON is fine. In case of YAML it's a bit trickier. We need to use ASTManager to insert the parameter exactly where it should be without re-generating the YAML from specs JavaScript object. We don't want to modify user's YAML structure or remove their comments. \nTo get started, familiarize yourself with the project. There is a global mode variable that is accessible via $rootScope.mode in JS files or simply mode in templates. First step is to remove that alert and make the menu button override global mode. Then we want to add UI controls and limit their appearance to ng-if=\"mode === 'designer'\" because those controls should be hidden in other modes.\nPlease start fiddling with the project and make a PR according to what I described. We can continue this discussion there.\n. Well, we never thought about printing but we can add print specific stylesheet to solve this. You cant patch it and make pull request if you will.\n. Swagger Editor PUTs on a relative path. If you want to edit a different file, just serve the editor in a different path for each file.\nFor example,  if /myfile/edit servers the editor for myfile, editor will both GET and PUT the specs file relative to this path\n. This is an issue with Bower. Bower sometimes does this when bower.json has changed. You could do bower cache clean and rm -rf app/bower_components to start bower install from scratch. \n. Are you importing this JSON from a URL?\n. @aghodsi @webron I need clarification for this issue \n. Ok. understood. Made this as an example of bad JSON that we should let user know what's wrong with their file\n. Now, import button will be disabled if document is invalid \n. I guess it's bug. I will look into it\n. Fixed by efbd68a\n. Shorthand $refs are not supported anymore. You need to put full path for $refs. #/definitions/Pet instead of Pet. I need to update examples to not have any shorthand $ref\n. The bug in default example is fixed\n. Fixed by 4d6c7d6\n. Fixed by a72fc44\n. please rm -rf node_modules app/bower_components and try again and let me know what happened \n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. When you have a non-primitive type parameter you should use schema instead of type.\nyaml\n      parameters: \n        - name: \"parameter1\"\n          in: \"body\"\n          description: \"\"\n          required: false\n          schema:\n            type: \"array\"\n            items: \n              type: \"string\"\nYou also can't have non-primitive type parameters in query\n. it's a bug then, I need to update the editor to support it\n. @iflamed if you want to work on this bug feel free to do it. \n. I don't think we changed anything in that regard. the URL option is here.\n. @DavidBiesack localhost can be inaccessible form a process. It's a permission issue and should be resolved by system configurations. The fix you did works but I rather fixing system/process permissions. \n. Please see #296 for help. This is an external issue \n. It seems like schemaForm module pushed a version that lacks non-minified code that we use in this project. Please use version 0.7.6 to fix this issue. I'll lock those versions down\n. Please manually install angular-schema-form@0.7.6 for now. I'll fix it.\nbower i angular-schema-form@0.7.6\n. It's a bug in recent push of angular-schema-form. I've asked them to push the missing file back. It will get fixed when they push a fixed version.\n. Meanwhile you can update your bower json to explicitly use 0.7.6. No ~\n. It's an issue with the module itself but for now this solution is acceptable.\nPlease do the same in karma config file so tests pass. \n. Here is the line you need to change\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/karma.conf.js#L49\n. Thanks for this. This issue with schema-form has been fixed. Could you revert this and update version of angular-schema-form to 0.7.9. That would solve it.\n. Confirmed. It's a bug\nAlso note that parameters should be an array\nyaml\n    post:\n      summary: POST simple parameter\n      description: Test\n      consumes:\n        - application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n      parameters:\n          - name: _method\n            in: formData\n            type: string\n            required: true\n            description: testing\n. Swagger uses JSON Schema for those objects. JSON Schema supports extending if you want.\n. We are working on having a backend and saving Swagger documents for you. Very similiar to JSBin or PasteBin \n. Dupe of #174 \n. Right, #306 is the actual issue. I'm looking into it\n. @retrospectacus Please see #306. \nYou can do one of the following:\n- host the editor on your original domain\n- run Chrome with --disable-web-security to ignore cross origin policies\n- update your server to accept that header over cross origin calls\n. It's the nature of cross-origin XHR calls. The server has to allow headers over cross origin call via Access-Control-Allow-Headers. See this example\n. There might be some backend that expect query string to be encoded.\nNote to self: If anyone faced an issue with encoded query params an opened an issue here, we can have a boolean option for decode/encode query string\n. @iflamed no. That is a different issue.\n. Steps to reproduce:\n1. open security example\n2. authenticate internalApiKey\n3. rename internalApiKey to something else\n4. rename back internalApiKey to it's original name\nNotice that the Security is authenticated already \n. Well, in that case it looks like a bug and a feature at the same time! But try this instead:\n1. Authenticate  internalApiKey\n2. Change the name property of internalApiKey\n3. Use  internalApiKey in Try Operation. \nSee the name has not changed. Because we cached the security\n. Github won't allow me to do that. If you want to fix it, go for it!\n. Oops! \ud83d\ude31\nCould you please fix it and send a pull request?\n. This was fixed by df69f2d\n. Could you paste entire npm log file here? \n. I see you're using npm version 2. Please try installing npm version 1 and see if that helps. This is not reproducible on my side. \nnpm i -g npm@1\n. I was able to build successfully with npm@2.4.1. Please re-open if you're still experiencing this.\n. Do you want to use two securities at the same time in \"try operation\"?\n. For Response Headers I have #268. For multiple security in try operation we can have a checkbox for each security instead of a dropdown that allows only one security to be selected at a time. \n. @tuukkamustonen You can define parameters globally using global parameters object. Then you can assign that parameter to each path. Every operation in that path will be using that parameter. \nSee this example:\n``` yaml\nswagger: '2.0'\ninfo:\n  version: 1.0.0\n  title: Pets Store\nparameters:\n  x-something:\n    name: X-Something\n    in: header\n    description: Global header X-Something\n    type: string\npaths:\n  /pets:\n    parameters:\n      - $ref: '#/parameters/x-something'\n    get:\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: Returns all the pets\n``\n. I just tried on Ubuntu 14 which shouldn't be too different than Ubuntu 12 in this case. It's working with no problem.\nPlease clean your npm cache bynpm cahce cleanand get the latest in master then try again. If it was still happening please re-open.\n. It's because empty string is invalid JSON. It can print prettier errors for sure. Pull requests are welcome! \n. Could you paste your JSON here? If it's not valid JSON **Import** button will be disabled. You can check JSON with online tools before pasting there too.\n. Also note that Swagger Editor works with JSON too. You don't have to use this if you don't want to convert your Swagger to YAML.\n. Makes sense, will do\n. Duplicate of #174 \n. Thanks! We have this in our roadmap. \nThis is duplicate of #174 \n. I'm looking into this\n. @SeraphicRav I've killed this feature for now. We are going to have a better approach to this. Previous approach was not the best way of doing this. If you want to use that feature as is please use 4af7d94 \n. Please rebase from master. It will pass tests if you do.\n. :+1: \n. This is probably because of XHR CORS limitations. You can fix it by adding your header toAccess-Control-Allow-Headersin your server. \nIf you don't want to change your server, you can host the editor on the same domain or open the editor in Chrome with--disable-web-securityflag\n. This is good. If you could, please add some test.\n. Also please rebase yourfix` commits \n. Very nice! :+1: \n. Swagger UI has a lot of features that Swagger Editor is lacking. For now lets use Swagger UI for rendering the docs. \nI had the same idea and I did put a \"export HTML\" button in Swagger Editor where it was making a web page that was only the docs. I did revert that feature back (It's here at 4af7d94e569bfee90baca36c61d5a946f272dbe2). \nMain reason for doing so is Swagger Editor preview lacks some key features from Swagger UI (file upload for example) and  codebase of Swagger Editor is too much for just rendering the docs.\n@duncanhall @iflamed please don't start a new project for this right now. We will update you if we decided to make a new project so you can be part of it too. For now, lets focus on Swagger UI and Swagger Editor :)\n. @iflamed if you're interested in working on backend part of it checkout the backend branch. I'm working on enabling the backend. \nTo understand what the final goal is, checkout anybin project:\nanybin.herokuapp.com\n. We thought about it. I think it makes sense to start a new project for that. You can use code snippets parts from this project. \n. Rendering the preview is the easy part. The tricky parts are code completion and \"jump to line\". I would start with code completion. For rendering the preview I'm working on spinning off the preview of the Swagger Editor to a stand-alone project so projects like this can benefit from it. You can also use Swagger UI for rendering the preview. \n. Are you guys thinking about a new editor or an Atom plug-in? Since Atom renders itself via web technologies it's possible to have Atom plug-ins that render HTML in a pane. Atom Markdown Editor is a good example to look at.\n. I believe if you try to put everything everything in one app it's going to be hard to maintain. It's nice to have auto-generated tests, mock server and try request in one app but let's have the editor scoped around editing the code and trying out endpoints.\nTwo points about creating a new app:\n- Chrome Apps and Atom plugins can make requests with no limitations. See Postman(Chrome App) and HTTP Post(Atom package). There is no need of making a standalone app using Atom Shell just because of HTTP calls.\n- Programmers love their own editor. They have plug-ins, custom key bindings and themes on their editors that they use everyday. If they could edit Swagger in their own editor (Atom in this case) it would be much more appealing than launching a different app for editing Swagger\n. You can select Mode > Disable Live Render to disable per keypress updates. This will help you edit large Swagger spec documents.\n. Yes, we can write our own diffing algorithm to update DOM partially. AngularJS is very good at doing this if we keep the source specs the same object, but what we override the source specs object each time user press a key because we transform hashes to arrays to keep the ordering right.\nOne solution is to not override the source object and perform a deep diff and update only parts that are changed. \nI'll look into it in feature \n. With a56cd98eaab8b08c63813787b825b69a87515cf2 the diffing and rendering speed has improved dramatically because we are doing the diff in JS land instead of overriding Angular's scope. Let me know if you're still having issues with performance. \n. Fixed by 3e298353d694b29ae903fe0599bcc21389dab327\n. Thanks for this!\nThere are some house keeping to do. After I did your PR will get deployed to swagger.io \n. :+1: Thank you! \n. Closing as a duplicate of #91 \n. With #349 this is less of an issue \n. I just tested import URL and it did work. Note that you need to tab out of input field then click import. I can certainly improve that.\n. Made #352 to improve validation \n. Duplicate of #268 \n. Fixed in #268\n. items itself should be a valid JSON Schema\nYour schema should look like this:\nyaml\n          schema:\n            required:\n              - result\n              - status\n            properties:\n              status:\n                description: HTTP header code\n                type: integer\n              result:\n                description: Obtained data array\n                type: array\n                items:\n                  type: object\n                  description: A data item\n                  required:\n                    - data1\n                    - data2\n                    - data3\n                  properties:\n                    data1:\n                      type: string\n                      example: qwerty              \n                    data2:\n                      type: string\n                      example: qwerty\n                    data3:\n                      type: string\n                      example: qwerty\n. I don't understand your questions. Please provide valid JSON that you want to describe with JSON Schema. Your JSON examples are not valid JSON.\nFor this example:\njson\n{\n  status: 200,\n  result: [\n    data1: qwerty,\n    data2: qwerty,\n    data3: qwerty\n  ]\n}\nI assumed your JSON is really this:\njson\n{\n  \"status\": 200,\n  \"result\": [\n    { \"data1\": \"qwerty\" },\n    { \"data2\": \"qwerty\" },\n    { \"data3\": \"qwerty\" }\n  ]\n}\n. For now, you can refresh the page to get around it. This will get fixed soon.\n. For my own reference:\nhttps://github.com/mohsen1/apply-diff/commit/063051cf808f702ccf4023456afea1042a3d6f77 and https://github.com/mohsen1/apply-diff/commit/8e2807c1562325f7c4c1988f9cadeb91b5d1e2ce fixed this\n. allOf is not currently supported in JSON Shema View. So don't expect it to render anything accurate. \nThe editor crash is a bug. I'll look into this \n. Follow downstream issue here\nhttps://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools/issues/173\n. which format? format of JSON Schema or parameter?\n. ok. We will do it\n. You can click Mode and Disable Live Render to render manually. That will speed things up. \nIt's a good idea to make that debounce timeout configurable. \n. Fixed by 5e3fdd9\n. This https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/ceaecfe0e505ea64a51e4a737c77535472223712/app/templates/operation.html#L74-L99\n. This is done\n. Ignore the server branch. You can enable server mode in settings but you have to provide your own server that responds to PUT and GET calls.\nHere is the settings:\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/tree/master/app/config\nHere are more docs:\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/tree/master/docs\n. Will do. \n. 3744bf9 fixed this\n. By replacing swagger-tools with sway the CPU load for validation is minimal now. Most of slowness is coming from Angular $digest cycles which can't be moved to a worker.\n. It should work but apparently my service (https://cors-it.herokuapp.com) has problems with CORS stuff. It also goes to sleep if it's not used for a while because it's a free app.\nI just learned about https://rawgit.com/  I should replace cors-it with rawgit.\n. Swagger Editor proxies import URLs through https://cors-it.herokuapp.com \n. This was fixed by https://github.com/mohsen1/cors-it/commit/4687a454e99ba21b166ebb2a698414799f55080d\n. Please open Chrome Developer Tools and select Network tab then try this. Examine the XHR call and make sure there is no error in there.\nPlease note that Swagger Editor is a web app and has CORS limitation. Postman is a packaged Chrome app and does not have CORS limitations.\nIf you didn't see any errors in Network tab please paste you Swagger specs here so we can help you.\n. Are you sure your server allows cross-origin calls from swagger.io origin? You might need to enable CORS in your server\n. Yes, different ports are different origins. This got me once too! :) \nGlad you figured it out \n. Please paste your YAML here\n. Please follow this issue here: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/issues/520\n. I'm not sure if fully understand your requirement. Could you please explain what is your end goal?\n. Swagger descriptions are Github flavored Markdown. In this Markdown you need two line breaks for a line break in resulting HTML.\nTry this:\n``` yaml\nswagger: '2.0'\ninfo:\n  version: 0.0.0\n  title: Simple API\n  description: |\n    # Title\n    Crea una orden de venta de productos.\nLos datos obligatorios son los siguientes.\n\npaths:\n  /:\n    get:\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: OK\n``\n. You're welcome! \ud83d\udc4d\n. This is an issue with Swagger Code Generator. Please follow up this issue over there. You can run the code locally on your machine and potentially fix it. \n. This issue was fixed in upstream project. \n. I've addedalphabadge to each code generator option. It would be nice if the API that returns list of languages returns development phase (alpha, beta, final) of each language so I can show that in the UI too. \n. @freiden inprestartwe're doingbower installnow. The point is, we don't want users install Bower before using Swagger Editor\n. This is great. I'll merge it with no problem. I just want to emphasize thatnpm startorgrunt serveis for **development** not using the Swagger Editor. It's best to make build and servedist/folder statically \n. Fair enough \ud83d\udc4d\n. Which client you're trying to generate?\n. @whitlockjc Don't we validate models (JSON Schema) with JSON Schema meta schema in SwaggerTools? The schema @denodaeus provided doesn't seem to be valid.\n. Oh I see. For arrays that can have more than one type of item theitems` can be an array of multiple schemas.\n. Your schema should be something like this:\nyaml\n  metadata:\n    additionalProperties: true\nBut the form generator does not support \"additionalProperties\": true where you can add unlimited key/value pairs. For now if you put the request data in body you can provide raw json for the request.\nI'll replace form generator with Angular JSON Schema Form where it's possible to have additionalProperties: true\n. If you want to edit Swagger files in that folder you need to enable backend and run a server that work as a backend for Swagger Editor.  Please read the docs here\n. Duplicate of #272 \n. BTW you have wrong indentation in ExtendedErrorModel\nExtendedErrorModel:\n    allOf:\n    - $ref: '#/definitions/ErrorModel' # <--- this should be indented on level in\n    - type: object # <-- also this\n      required:\n      - rootCause\n      properties:\n        rootCause:\n          type: string\n. That's probably Swagger Tools issue. I believe it's this issue https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools/issues/180\nPlease follow up with @whitlockjc in Swagger Tools repo\n. I think ptr is required error is already fixed in Swagger Tools. Today I'm going to update Swagger Tools so it will get fixed. \n. The rendering of allOf is not fixed yet. Follow #272 for that.\n. This is fixed. \n. I don't fully understand what the issue is here. Can you paste your full spec or provide a full spec that fully demonstrate the issue?\n. I see no problem in your spec. It's the validator that doesn't resolve $refs properly. Please follow up this issue here\n. Yes editor uses SwaggerTools to check for errors and current SwaggerTools in editor uses an older Swagger schema. It will be fixed by https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/389\n. What platform are you running at? (Windows, Linux or Mac)\n. What version of Node are you using?\nAs you can see here build is passing so I don't think it's an issue with Swagger Editor itself. \nPlease get the latest master from Github and try again and let me know if you're still having issues.\n. Could you paste your entire stdout here so we can take a look.\nInstead of npm start you can also do the following:\nshell\nnpm install -g bower grunt-cli\nnpm install\nbower install\ngrunt serve\nMaybe above commands works for you\n. Swagger UI? If you have issues with SwaggerUI please open a ticket in swagger-ui repo\n. It doesn't have anything to do with using $ref the required property is being ignored. JSON Schema view is not rendering the required attributes. \n. The schema has updated to fix this issue. It will get resolved when we update to the latest swagger-tools which has latest schema. \n. @whitlockjc I thought you updated the schema in swagger-tools already. Please open a ticket in swagger-tools for updating the schema in the next release and link it to this issue if it's not the case\n. @who it's not published yet. @whitlockjc \n. Fix for this is deployed now.\n. Don't you see anything in any of the tabs? (Rendered, Pretty and Raw)\n. If angular sanitizer fail to parse the response this will happen. With this Swagger and https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt url it's possible to duplicate this issue \n``` yaml\nswagger: '2.0'\ninfo:\n  version: 0.0.0\n  title: Simple API\nschemes:\n  - https\nhost: cors-it.herokuapp.com\npaths:\n  /:\n    get:\n      parameters:\n        - name: url\n          in: query\n          description: The URL to fetch\n          type: string\n  responses:\n    200:\n      description: OK\n\nhttps://cors-it.herokuapp.com/?url=https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt\n``\n. Fixed by #430\n. Hmmm... that's new. Is it happening in Chrome too?\n. Maybe we should use ngAnimate for this instead of class toggling. \n. It's because themes havefontSizeoption in them. I think we should listen tothemeWillChange(if exists) and grab the font size before change and apply it after theme change. \n. This is a great improvement! Many people are using development mode for just using the editor in their machines. I should do the same fornpm start` task. \n. Can you do the following and see if it helps?\nshell\nnpm cache clean\nbower cache clean\nrm -rf node_modules app/bower_components\nnpm start\n. @webron is correct. It's a CORS issue. Swagger Editor uses a third party server to get around servers that don't have CORS enabled for importing swagger. But for making calls, you need to either enable CORS in your server or host the editor in your own domain. \n. Please do the delete node_modules and app/bower_components  folders and clean your npm cache (npm cache clean) and try again. \n. I did investigate this issue. For running in Windows:\n- Have node and npm in your PATH\n- Have git in your PATH. Because bower is using git to fetch some of dependencies. If you have Git Bash use that for running npm start, otherwise make sure you have git command working in your CLI\n- ~~When you run npm start Swagger Editor will make a new build, run the server and launch the browser to open http://0.0.0.0:8080. This is for Docker to work properly. In Windows this URL might not work. You can navigate your browser to http://localhost:8080 or http://127.0.0.1:8080 to make it work.~~ Edit: I made 9e0d18d to fix this issue.\n. I tried npm start on my Windows VM and it worked. I'm not sure why it's not working in your machine but there is a safer way of running npm start that doesn't involve a lot of npm script magic.\nPlease do the following:\n1. Delete node_modules and app/bower_component folders\n2. Get the latest in master via Git: git pull origin master\n3. Run following commands:\n```\n   npm i -g bower grunt-cli \n   npm i\n   bower i\n   grunt build\n   grunt serve:dist\n``\n. This is a problem in swagger-codegen project. I've moded this issue there (https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/issues/652). Please include your entire swagger description there.\n. Hmmm... Maybe it's already fixed but not yet deployed? @fehguy \n. @Cooker-Monster either way it's an issue in the swagger-codegen please follow up in https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/issues/652. Most of codegen stuff is community driven. You might want to adopt the node.js codegen and make it great. That will benefit everyone! \n. - Instagram API example is not yet completed\n- From what I understand you're having an issue in \"try this operation\" and that's probably CORS issue. Read this document https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/docs/cors.md\n. What operation system you're on? You shouldn't requiresudo`. You can run the following to start from scratch\ngit pull origin master\nnpm cache clean\nrm -rf node_modules app/bower_components\nnpm i\nnpm run bower-install\nnpm run build\n. Hopefully your issue was resolved. Please comment here if you're still having this issue. I'm closing this ticket. \n. This is a bug. For now use the Raw tab to post your body. When I finish #384, this should get fixed. \n. Fixed by #430\n. Are you making the call cross-origin? Please read the cors docs and be advised that even if your server is supporting cross-origin calls, cross-origin XHR calls will not have access to all the headers for security reasons.\n. It's most likely the CORS issue that is causing this issue. I'm closing this ticket but if you're still having this issue over a CORS-enabled server, please comment here. \n. @rajegit is talking about swagger-node. You need to pass correct content type. Browser won't do it.\n. Can you share the JOSN you used?\n. Please read here. It's not the most reliable when your json is behind a server without CORS (#370)\n. You need to open this issue in code-generator project\n. SwaggerUI does not generate a from for your request. There is a pull request there for this feature. Please open an issue in SwaggerUI project if you want to discuss this issue. It's not an issue in Swagger Editor. \n. It's because of this line. We're doing that because people might be using JSON instead of YAML in the editor. I think we should put this line behind a condition that checks if there is JSON in the code\n. Moved to https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/issues/714\n. I believe your npm install was failed in your machine according to this:\n```\n\n\nError: Cannot find module 'chalk'\nLoading \"less.js\" tasks...ERROR\nError: Cannot find module 'lodash'\n```\n\n\nPlease delete your node_modules folder and run npm start again\n. I tested the latest in my Window VM. I suggest you use Git Bash instead of Windows CLI or make sure you have git and node in your PATH.\nHere is the latest (c848614) running on Windows 8.1\n\n. You can manually install Bower and Grunt and start it with following commands:\nnpm i -g bower grunt-cli\nnpm i\nbower i\ngrunt serve\nI'll try to find out what's wrong with Windows scripts. \n. I don't know about that. Maybe you need to use IIS? \n. I tested the latest in my Window VM. I suggest you use Git Bash instead of Windows CLI or make sure you have git and node in your PATH.\nHere is the latest (c848614) running on Windows 8.1\n\n. Do you mean there is no Swift client code gen? If so, you can use Objective-C client SDK in a Swift code base.\n. Please follow this issue here. If you know Swift well enough you should contribute Swift SDK. Most of code-gen is community driven\n. Edit: Link to moved issue\n. Should we render it with some visual indication that it's deprecated or should we omit it altogether? \n/cc @fehguy @webron \n. Why are you running this as root?\n. Glad you figured it out.\n. Fixed by f0e715b9070c1710369fc6b82a62d6b93d91cab8\n. Your backend should return pure YAML string in body. It also should expect YAML in body of PUT calls that Editor will make. Look at Apigee a127 as an example of using backend feature. There is more docs here\n. if useYamlBackend is disabled editor will do JSON.parse instead of YAML.load. Remember JSON is YAML so passing JSON to YAML.load will just work.\n. Oh I forgot to mention AST builder will fail if you pass JSON instead of YAML. \n. This is easy to add. We need to add a secondary argument to FileLoader#importFromUrl (here)  to bypass the proxy url construction and pass that argument here when you see noproxy query param. \nPlease open a PR with those changes if you want it soon. \n. This was implemented in https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/455\n. Code generators are working for me at this moment. Can you paste your Swagger spec so we can try it?\n. Well, editor does a lot of work when spec changes. It parses the YAML, lets Swagger Tools walk the tree for issues(which is very expensive) and renders the HTML. I have #368 open for this. If we can move all those processes into different threads(Workers in browser) we can gain a lot of performance boost.\n. That what we're doing\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/app/scripts/controllers/editor.js#L5\nThat 200ms delay is not configurable. #364 is open for making that configurable from UI level\n. Right, we throttle processing and rendering but we don't throttle Ace getCompletion calls. getCompletions calls trigger AST composing for getting completions. It is an issue for big files.\n. I'm going to explore running getCompletions in a worker. Throttling that task hurts user experience in more common cases (smaller specs). \n. In 2.9.8 performance is more acceptable and there are options to disable heavy operation. Please comment if you still have concerns. \n. JSON is a subset of YAML, so if you can import YAML, you can defiantly import JSON too. I just tried importing this URL with success in the online editor:\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/master/examples/v2.0/json/petstore-expanded.json\n\nI guess the problem is, you're trying to import from a URL that is not accessible from the service we're using to get around CORS (cors-it.herokuapp.com) because it's hosted in your machine.\n. #455 will allow you to get around cors-it when it's implemented. \n. Do you mean your backend's basic auth works without a password? if so, providing any password (a single space) should work, no?\n. oh options hash is missing port: developmentPort,.  Will fix ASAP\n. Yes, we can have a query parameter (in fragment) to disable cors-it.\n. which version Swagger Editor are you using? In previous release we've added response headers rendering feature. It's live at online editor\n. Was this working with no warning before?\n. Please clean up your node_modules and app/bower_components folders and try again:\nshell\nrm -rf node_modules app/bower_components\nnpm start\nLet me know if it's still not working \n. Do you have grunt and bower installed globally? If so, please update them \n. Swagger 2.0 doesn't support it. Follow this thread for feature updates.\n. You're right. We should extend defaultHeaders. Will fix this ASAP\n. I don't see any difference in final YAML vs. the original YAML. Maybe I'm missing something. Can you point to exact location in YAML where it's loosing quotes?\n. Yes, that's how YAML works. If you don't put quotes around numbers they're going to be treated as numbers but if you don't put quotes around strings that can't parsed as numbers YAML will parse them as strings.\n``` yaml\nnumber: 12 # parsed as number\ndecimal: 0.00001 # parsed as number\nnotNumber: 123x # can't be a number\nstringNum: \"124\" # because of the quotes it won't try parsing it\nstring: Hello world\nbecause it's a multi-line string it won't try parsing this either\nmlString: >\n  12344 \n```\n. I spent a good amount of time figuring this out with no luck. For now you can change your parameter type to string to go around it. Since it's not JSON it really doesn't matter if you use string there. You can use a regex pattern to enforce minimum and maximum. I know it's ugly but that will fix your issue for now. I'll try to fix it in the next release.\nHere is the YAML with regex pattern:\n``` yaml\nswagger: '2.0'\nThis is your document metadata\ninfo:\n  version: \"0.0.0\"\n  title: \nDescribe your paths here\npaths:\n  # This is a path endpoint.

This is an [upstream issue with JSON Editor](https://github.com/jdorn/json-editor/issues/406)\n. Yes I noticed this issue and fixed it at 5e05323 couple of minutes ago. Please get the latest again\n. We're _extending_ parent values(security or parameters). I'm not sure if we should override parent values when you put empty array in lower levels.\n@webron what is the right way to go?\n. @webron Apparently it's clear that if array is empty we should remove upper level securitie. What should happen if user doesn't provide an empty array? Should we extend the upper level security array with current array?\n. @webron should it have the same behavior forschemes,consumesandproduces? If I define empty array in operation level, it overrides the root definitions? \n. This is fixed at e746aed\n. Swagger Editor uses relative paths to load it's resources. Maybe you should put a wild card afterhttp://${host name}/swagger-editorto allow other resources to load. I don't know much about Apache configs so I don't know how you can do that. If you open the online editor and open up network tab in the browser developer tools you'll see all the files Swagger Editor fetches.\n. All resources use./stylesor./scripts` prefix in their URLs. If that helps.\n. You can disable the code generators. Docs\n. In other static file servers I tried, all relative URLs are working. So it's not something we can fix here. It's probably your Apache configs. As you said, you can find and replace those strings.\n. I hope you figured it out. I'm closing the issue for now. Please feel free to open new issues if you're having other problems. \n. The build was successful in my attempt in OSX. I have iojs but all Node versions are successfully working in the CI. \nThe reference to app/images/favicon-16x16.png was changed in index.html in recent commits. I suggest removing all temporary folders (.tmp .grunt), clean up dependency folders (npm and bower) and get the latest before starting again. You should not have to install bower and grunt. Alos grunt serve is not equal to npm start. grunt serve starts the development mode while npm start serves a built version.\n. Please try removing all your node modules and clearing cache. Then start again, if that didn't help let me know.\nrm -rf node_modules app/bower_components\nnpm cache clean \nbower cache clean\nnpm start\nAlso I see you're using node 0.10 which is very old. Try updating your node engine also. We have no problem with node 0.10 but it's less stable in our build matrix.\n. :+1: \n. @webron It doesn't make sense to support markdown in description of an external doc. If description of external docs is markdown then it means it can contain a lot of things like tables, headings and so on. \nMaybe it should be plain text instead? \n. For example this external doc can be rendered in a simple link:\nyaml\ndescription: Find more info here\nurl: https://swagger.io\nhtml\n<a href=\"https://swagger.io\">Find more info here</a>\nBut if description is a complex markdown document it becomes tricky to render and support all cases\n. What is the necessity of having markdown here?\n. Swagger supports multiple content-types, you need to put them in produces array. Please provide your Swagger spec so we can help further.\nSwagger UI is a different project, if you're using it open an issue there.\n. Please check Swagger-Core and Swagger UI projects in this Github org. This has nothing to do with Swagger Editor. \n. Here you go: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core\nRead the docs and if you couldn't find the answer, ask in StackOverflow or open an issue. You can also join the IRC channel #swagger\n. It's an issue in the new Angular Bootstrap. on-toggle is not being triggered on dropdown menus\n. So if I understood it correctly you don't want to have those comments in the YAML itself. As of right now we don't have any plans to introduce Google Docs style commenting system. \nI suggest using comments in the YAML with some specific format or use a vendor extension node like x-comments to put in your comments\n. I know that would be really nice to have but it's a big item and as of now we don't have any plans to do it. \nI've created this issue to help you pointing to specific parts of the specs better. \nI'm closing this issue for now. \n. @webron should know, this error is a schema error. \n. Thank you for your PR. Per #494 we want to use ngAnimate to do the animation with less manual style calculation work. I know animating from height: auto to a height: 0 is not working since CSS animations are working if from and to values are numerical. That's why this directive is doing height calculation, but that should be all it's doing and uses ngAnimate to append and remove classes to do the animation.\n. Why did you have to use $interval with 0 time?  It's very expensive and can make it have some janky animation.\nI think ngAnimate has a nice API for dealing with stuff like this. Look at angular-material dynamic height tab source code. They've solved this exact problem. \n. Code has drifted a lot since this was proposed. This fix is not the best way of fixing the issue. #397 remains open. Please feel free to open a new PR based on suggestions above.\nThank you for your effort! \n. You can change the example folder in the configs. See all configuration options here\n. ok, examplesFolder is absolute right now. We can change it to be relative\n. @baruahp have you tried making your examplesFolder a relative path like ./spec-files? \n. You can use http-server module to serve at a different pathname. You can basically use any server. It might be possible to do it in connect.js, but I'm not sure how?\n. Your probably failed at compiling less files. Do you see the same results in editor.swagger.io?\n. It can be many things. Please try compiling again and share the logs if it's still not working properly \n. Thanks! Looks good to me. Did you manually test the result of this? Both in development mode (grunt serve) and compiled mode (grunt serve:dist).\n. bower_components/ace-builds/src-noconflict/ext-searchbox.js is getting 404-ed.\n. It's a good point. We should at least mention it in development guide\n. This is something we can have. I see the value in implementing it.\n. As of bd9e444 this feature has been landed \n\n. I'm aware of this and one of our goals for the next release is to make it more performant on larger spec files. \n. Duplicate of #448 \n. It's very similar to #498. I don't see it on Mac. Apparently it's Windows specific\n. @rantibi Can you checkout less-wiredep branch and let me know if that fix is working for you?\n. The CI is compiling with no issue. I'm guessing it's something on your machine. What version of Node.js are you using?\nJust to make sure do a deep clean up:\nrm -rf node_modules app/bower_components\nbower cache clean\nnpm cache clean\nnpm start\n. Hopefully you got this sorted out. Let me know if you're still having issues...\n. @netei have you tried removing everything and a starting fresh?\n. Maybe try SSH?: git@github.com:swagger-api/swagger-editor.git\n. You can download directly from releases https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/releases/tag/v2.9.6\n. We're supporting multiple securities already. In your case you have multiple apiKey securities in header. \n. \n. For each of application/json, multipart/form-data and x-www-form-urlencoded we use a different method to encode body of the request. I agree that we should allow other types of consumes but I'm not sure how the body encoding should look like?\nWhat is the consumes value in your API?\n. ~~Does the server at api.rclon.com expects XHR calls from swagger.io? Please read the CORS document for more information.~~\nI thought you have issues when using \"try this operation\". Your spec is not valid. Swagger Tools can't validate it either. Try using latest build of swagger tools to validate your schema. If it failed open an issue in it's repository\n. Ok, I did it for you. Latest SwaggerTools can indeed find the errors in your spec. Here is the list of errors:\n```\nAPI Errors:\n#/paths/~1merchants/get/parameters/16/$ref: Parameter could not be resolved: #/parameters/createdOnParam\n  #/paths/~1merchants/get/parameters/17/$ref: Parameter could not be resolved: #/parameters/createdBeforeParam\n  #/paths/~1merchants/get/parameters/18/$ref: Parameter could not be resolved: #/parameters/createdAfterParam\n  #/paths/~1merchants~1id~1{merchantId}/get/parameters/1/$ref: Parameter could not be resolved: #/parameters/fetchParam\n  #/paths/~1offers/get/parameters/20/$ref: Parameter could not be resolved: #/parameters/createdOnParam\n  #/paths/~1offers/get/parameters/21/$ref: Parameter could not be resolved: #/parameters/createdBeforeParam\n  #/paths/~1offers/get/parameters/22/$ref: Parameter could not be resolved: #/parameters/createdAfterParam\n  #/paths/~1offers~1id~1{offerId}/get/parameters/1/$ref: Parameter could not be resolved: #/parameters/fetchParam\n  #/paths/~1customers/get/parameters/24/$ref: Parameter could not be resolved: #/parameters/createdOnParam\n  #/paths/~1customers/get/parameters/25/$ref: Parameter could not be resolved: #/parameters/createdBeforeParam\n  #/paths/~1customers/get/parameters/26/$ref: Parameter could not be resolved: #/parameters/createdAfterParam\n  #/paths/~1customers~1id~1{customerId}/get/parameters/1/$ref: Parameter could not be resolved: #/parameters/fetchParam\n  #/paths/~1events~1customerId~1{customerId}/get/parameters/4/$ref: Parameter could not be resolved: #/parameters/createdOnParam\n  #/paths/~1events~1id~1{eventId}/get/parameters/1/$ref: Parameter could not be resolved: #/parameters/fetchParam\nAPI Warnings:\n#/parameters/createBeforeParam: Parameter is defined but is not used: #/parameters/createBeforeParam\n14 errors and 1 warning\n```\nAfter we update the swagger-tools dependency, you'll see those errors in the UI. \n. Moved to https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/issues/903\n. @cosbor11 Please follow this in codegen repo. \n. Yes, the online codegen which editor is using has the issue. \n. Can you share your Swagger spec?\n. It's the same issue as https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/509. Problem is, we use the Content-Type dropdown for choosing encoding method of the body and right now we have 3 predefined encoding methods. If you have a custom encoding method it's going to ignore it. \n. The change you've made in connect.js is a good change. Please submit a PR with that.\n. This is an issue in UI Layout. I've reported it here https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-layout/issues/100\n. Thanks! Could you please rebase in one commit? \n. Merged with rebase @ 76870dd24cd203630a4e080047e657ca6780c917\n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#925\n. This issue was moved to apigee-127/swagger-tools#237\n. @arockstar that's a good solution. Please make a pull request if you have time. \n. Related: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/624\n. This issue was fixed in Swagger-Tools. Once Swagger Tools is released and updated in here, this issue will be resolved. \nHere is reported errors using latest swagger-tools@master\n```\nAPI Errors:\n#/paths/~1cover~1{interpret}~1{title}.{extension}/get/parameters/1/$ref: Parameter could not be resolved: #/parameters/InterpretParam\n  #/paths/~1cover~1{interpret}~1{title}.{extension}/get: API requires path parameter but it is not defined: interpret\nAPI Warnings:\n#/parameters/IntrepretParam: Parameter is defined but is not used: #/parameters/IntrepretParam\n2 errors and 1 warning\n``\n. You got it! :+1: \n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#937\n. it should change based on the dropdown. It's a bug. Thanks for reporting. \n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#947\n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#948\n. Thanks,\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/pull/526 Fixed this already \n. This was fixed in 62c169f\n. What a read-only model should do?\n. Just to make it clear for myself, here I created a simple Swagger spec that has a model with one read-only property. The form generated for POST operation marks thecreatedAt` property as read-only and user is not able change that field:\n``` yaml\nswagger: '2.0'\ninfo:\n  version: 0.0.0\n  title: Simple API\npaths:\n  /:\n    get:\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: OK\n          schema:\n            $ref: '#/definitions/User'\n    post:\n      parameters:\n        - name: body\n          in: body\n          description: description\n          schema:\n            $ref: '#/definitions/User'\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: OK\ndefinitions:\n  User:\n    properties:\n      name: \n        type: string\n      createdAt:\n        type: string\n        readOnly: true\n```\n\nSo what is the bug?\n. No worries. :+1: \n. It's a dependency bug and I've reported it here\nhttps://github.com/jdorn/json-editor/issues/455\n. You can't do this:\ncustomer:\n        readOnly: true \n        $ref: '#/definitions/Customer'\n$ref resolver will replace everything in the object with it's referencer result. So your readOnly property here will be overriden after resolution \n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#957\n. :+1: \n. What is examplesFolder settings? See config docs to learn how to change it.\n. URL construction is happening here. Can you debug it and see why this is happening?\n. You can run grunt serve\n. BTW for your own use case you can specify an absolute URL for examplesFolder. Something like /editor/work/spec-files\n. Your regex is invalid JS regex. \njs\nnew RegExp(\"(?i)^[A-Z0-9._%!#$%&'*+-/=?^_`{|}~()]+@[A-Z0-9]+([.-][A-Z0-9]+)*\\\\.[A-Z]{2,22}$\")\nThis code throws with: \nUncaught SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression: /(?i)^[A-Z0-9._%!#$%&'*+-/=?^_`{|}~()]+@[A-Z0-9]+([.-][A-Z0-9]+)*\\.[A-Z]{2,22}$/: Invalid group\n. What is the question/issue?\n. The \"try this operation\" for the petstore example when host is localhost doesn't work. It's just an example \n. http://playground.apistudio.io/ is a different project. It uses Swagger Editor but it has it's own specific backend that can return mock responses based on your Swagger. \n. Just to make sure do a deep clean up and start again\nrm -rf node_modules app/bower_components\nbower cache clean\nnpm cache clean\nnpm start\n. Editor will try to run on port 8080. If that port is busy try changing it in connect.js or set the environment variable PORT to something else\n. \"It's not working\" is not helpful. What is not working? What happens when you npm start?\n. I have no idea why ELIFECYCLE is being thrown. Can you try installing grunt and bower globally using npm and run grunt serve?\n. did you delete the folder, cloned again and tried starting again?\nI see Fatal error: spawn cmd ENOENT in your logs. Apparently someone can't make a directory. It could be permission issues on your system.\n. Honestly at this point I don't know how to help. I have a Windows VM. I'll try running it in my VM to see what happens \n. I successfully ran Swagger Editor build in a Windows VM.\nThings that I notices:\n- I had JDK installed in my Windows VM. Selenium dependency of Swagger Editor needs JDK but in the build of npm start you don't need it. Installing JDK can help.\n- I ran npm start in regular Windows CMD application, not Git Bash.\n- I had git, node and npm in my path\n- npm 1.4.3\n- node 0.10.26\nYour Windows machines can be different, npm and node versions of my Windows machine are pretty old but that means it even works with older version. Unless they broke something in newer version of npm or node in Windows! \n. I understand what the requirement is but I don't know how this should be implemented. Problem is, it's impossible to tell if you're writing a fragment or the Swagger spec is just invalid.\n@webron Does Swagger have a method for marking fragment files? Something like specifically formatted comments maybe?\n. For Swagger Editor to support this we can have to have some specific comments. Here is my proposal for the spec of the comments I that indicates a YAML file is a partial swagger file:\n1. First line MUST be a comment\n2. Comment body is formatted as follows and containing  # partial-swagger: (space, partial-swagger, colon, space)\n# partial-swagger: {{path}}\n3. the path component can be a string or a JavaScript array. \n4. If path is string it is pointing to a root object in swagger document.\nExample: \nyaml\n   # partial-swagger: info\n   title: My API\n   description: An API\n5. If path is an array it is pointing to an object deep inside the swagger document. It should be valid JavaScript(or JSON) array\n   Example:\nyaml\n   # partial-swagger: [\"info\", \"contact\"]\n   email: me@example.com\n   url: example.com\n   name: My Name\nObviously this is not part of Swagger spec and it's here only to help Swagger Editor work with partial YAMLs that build up a larger spec.\n@webron @fehguy Please review \n. Yes, there is no way to know if Swagger is invalid or it's just a part of a larger spec.\n. > Can you please clarify the example of the array? I'm not sure I understand what you mean by it.\nThe array is a made up format for \"path\" to this partial from root of the spec. I guess we're better off using   JSON Pointer (RFC 6901) for that. \n\nAre you going to perform partial validation on those segments?\n\nMy thinking is to fill in the missing parts with minimal swagger and validate the whole thing. It would be a lot of work to support partial validation in swagger-tools\n\nThis kind of implementation forces a structure of the segments. I don't mind it, though some people may expect something slightly different. We can try breaking it down further and see if/how we'd want to support more cases. I'm okay with basic support at first.\n\nI can't think of anything other than breaking down swagger into smaller files that are pieces of a larger spec. I would love to see different ways of doing it though...\n. Because editor is not owning the spec in it's host, there is no way to resolve relative and fragments paths. the only ref we can resolve is absolute refs\n. @andylowry Your points are very valid. Having a GUI instead of comments to indicate you're working on a fragment is a good idea. That will not pollute the document with comments just for the sake editing. \nI'm not sure about automatically switching to fragment editing mode. In the world of invalid documents a lot of things can go wrong and all of that \"smartness\" can overcomplicate stuff. \n. If your browser can't render the unicode character, it shouldn't be any different if you use HTML code point syntax. Does changing  \u26a0 to &#9888; fix the issue for you?\n. We opted to use Unicode characters for icons for simplicity. Some browsers might not render them perfectly but I'm sure all browsers will get there soon. Since it's not critical to editor's functionality we can leave it as is. \nThere is also charset meta tag that tells browser to use UTF-8.\n. I've seen this before. The correct steps to reproduce: \n1. Paste the JSON\n2. \"missing response object\" error appears \n3. Add a new line in the end of YAML (or any change in YAML), the error goes away\n. No, it's not about the JSON. See #289 and #540\n. Yes, this is duplicate of #539 and #289 as result of https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/commit/03e0a18b01c4e517e8934833712807739272c286. I don't want to remove memoize call because it will introduce a lot of performance issues. I'll dig into it to fix it without losing memoize \n. If I understood your question correctly.\nBy this:\nyaml\nimage:\n  type: array\n  items: \n    $ref: '#/definitions/Image'\nYou are describing an array of Image objects. If you want an array of image object wrapped in a {Image: image} wrapper you can do as follow:\nyaml\nimage:\n  type: array\n  items: \n    type: object\n    properties:\n     Image:\n       $ref: '#/definitions/Image'\n. Ah I see where the confusion is coming from. The word Image in there is not a key, it's the title of your schema. Swagger Editor uses the key in definitions hash to add \"title\" to your schema. See examples of the schema-view directive to learn more. \n. :+1: \n. Duplicate of #539\n. Please submit a pull request for this change. Thanks\n. Please fix it and issue a PR :smile: \n. This is done. \n. It's a bug for sure but if you get stuck in things like this, just refresh the page... \n. This might be an issue in JSON Schema View dependency \n. Maybe order of the script tags are not right. Ace files should come after vendor. \n. We should be able to make try operation respond to changes in the state of security definitions. \n. :+1: \n. We are using a[download]. It's downloading a Blob that is having a URL generated from window.URL.createObjectURL. It's generated on the fly. If Firefox can't \"save link as\" the link it's a firefox bug.\n. Reported it here: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1184450\n. You can use Swagger Editor itself. Just add a little CSS to hide top bar and editor pane and make the preview pane 100% width. Read the configuration docs\n. Yes, I understand. I've made a project to bring editor style preview for documentation. It's not done and it doesn't have try operation component. \n. Security should be an array of objects. You are missing the -\nyaml\nsecurity:\n- Client ID: []\n- Basic Authentication: []\nBTW for multiline string you can use |:\n``` yaml\nswagger: \"2.0\"\ninfo:\n  title: \"Balance API\"\n  description: |\n    Description for the balance service.  Monotonectally foster stand-alone\n    potentialities without superior infrastructures. Globally extend mission-critical\n    ROI rather than high standards in niches. Proactively evisculate market positioning\n    meta-services and market-driven functionalities. Quickly expedite maintainable\n    intellectual capital and resource sucking architectures. Conveniently impact\n    parallel functionalities and web-enabled results.\n``\n. :+1: \n. Swagger editor does support mutlipe securities. Your example YAML is missing a-`:\nyaml\nsecurity:\n  - Client ID: []\n  -  Basic Authentication: []\nTry this simple spec in editor:\n``` yaml\nswagger: '2.0'\ninfo:\n  version: \"1.0.0\"\n  title: Basic Auth Example\nschemes:\n  - http\n  - https\nsecurityDefinitions:\n  basicAuth:\n    type: basic\n    description: HTTP Basic Authentication. \n  apiKey:\n    name: apiKey\n    type: apiKey\n    in: query\n    description: API Key\npaths:\n  /:\n    get:\n      security:\n       - basicAuth: []\n       - apiKey: []\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description:  OK\n```\n. I just read the issue at https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/issues/416. I didn't know about AND and OR. You're right.\n. Security should be an array of objects:\n``` yaml\nsecurity:\n - token-credentials: []\n```\n. JSON translation of that is:\njson\n{\n  \"security\": [\n    {\n      \"token-credentials\": []\n    }\n  ]\n}\nYup, it's a bit confusing but that's how Swagger is...\n. JSON Schema does not require type: object and it assumes all schemas are object schema by default. Is it a good to have or Swagger wants type: object to be specified explicitly? \n. termsOfService is not a markdown field. We might be able to linkify it.\n. No longer can reproduce as of bd9e444\n. Your spec is invalid. \"type\": \"double\" is not valid JSON Scehma type.\n. :+1: \n. imagemin has been source of many issues. We don't have a lot of images in this project. Maybe I remove ti altogether...\n. Can find steps to reproduce? Without that I don't what to fix.\n. Not happening to me. On Firefox or Chrome. I can type in with no errors in console. \n. Ace's JSON mode module is here and editor had no problem loading it. Try changing the mode to JSON in editor settings. \nCan you screen grab your flow? \n. I can assume it's GitHub pages not serving the script \"sometimes\"\n. I see... issue is here\nWe need to include json mode there also since editor can work in json mode too. \n. Try cleaning up node modules and starting again. I've seen this error in Windows reported here many times. Look at other issues like #270 #216 #407 to find more help.\n. Also see my comment here: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/535#issuecomment-123795690\n. I can't tell what's the error from your screenshot. Can you make a minimal Swagger with those parameter and paste it here? \nIf you open error details you might get some insights for what's going on exactly.\n. order of properties shouldn't matter. It's a hash.\n. did you disable useYamlBackend?\n. What version of Swagger Editor are you using? Try building from source and see if it's still happening. \n. You can run Swagger Editor in development mode (grunt serve) and see what's going on in Backend service. I'll take a look at it this week if I had a chance. \n. I believe it's the same bug as #592. Please follow the issue there. \n. From JSON Schema \u00a75.23:\n```\ndate-time  This SHOULD be a date in ISO 8601 format of YYYY-MM-\n      DDThh:mm:ssZ in UTC time.  This is the recommended form of date/\n      timestamp.\ndate  This SHOULD be a date in the format of YYYY-MM-DD.  It is\n      recommended that you use the \"date-time\" format instead of \"date\"\n      unless you need to transfer only the date part.\ntime  This SHOULD be a time in the format of hh:mm:ss.  It is\n      recommended that you use the \"date-time\" format instead of \"time\"\n      unless you need to transfer only the time part.\n```\nYou probably want to use date-time that is in ISO 8601\n. I don't even get the error with your parameter. How did you get the error?\n``` yaml\nswagger: '2.0'\ninfo:\n  version: 0.0.0\n  title: Simple API\npaths:\n  /:\n    get:\n      parameters:\n      - name: relative_to\n        in: query\n        description: ''\n        required: false\n        type: string\n        format: date\n        default: 2015-07-11\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: OK\n```\n. Ah I see. Schema was updated since 2.9.6 but we haven't published 2.9.7 yet. \n. Duplicate of #565 \n. Fixed by 82a26a6\n. Thanks,\nTwo notes:\n- Start your commit message with [examples]\n- Extend examplesFolder with this file so it shows up in the open an example dialog.\n. If you closed the tab before editor showing \"saved\" message in status bar your changes are lost unfortunately \n. Both should be valid. Could you try it again and make sure it's happening? \n. Yes @webron we have to worry about invalid specs in the editor! Editor shouldn't throw even spec is invalid. \nSee thrown errors in the browser console.\n. I've seen this error but I can't reproduce it right now. \nCan you come up with exact steps to reproduce this? Please use the latest master.\n. Yes, I saw it's not happening in master either. Maybe it's for when backend is enabled? \n. Since I was not able to reproduce it I'm closing this issue. Please comment here if you found exact steps to reproduce.\n.  @hzill I can't reproduce this error. It's very likely the error is on your server side. We have end to end tests that test POST functionality with our \"Petstore on Heroku\" example. Please try the heroku-pets example POST requests and let me know if it's still sending GET requests. Also, look at browser network tab to see outgoing XHR calls to make sure browser is sending the right call. \n. @davisford can you see your preflight call and make sure POST is being returned by your server? \nTry the heroku petstore in online editor and look at the preflights call.It returns POST,GET\n. The preflight call is sent by jQuery. It's a OPTIONS call to make sure the server is capable of accepting a POST call. From 2.9.6 we've updated the versions of Angular and jQuery. It can be an issue with new versions of those dependencies. I'll investigate. \n. Are you aware of host property in Swagger? You can point to a different host with that.\n. Yes, that's a bug in 2.9.6. It's fixed now. #529 \n. Ah I think I know what's going on....\nTry try-method-fix branch and let me know if that fixes the issue for you.\n. @davisford the error you're seeing should be fixed with 70d4285\n. Duplicate #542\n. Latest official release is 2.9.6. Anything in master is work in progress. You can git checkout v2.9.6 to go to latest release or download actual compiled version from releases page.\n. The dist folder is simply a bunch of HTML/JS/CSS files (static web). You can server however you want. \n. That's JSON number limitation. \nJSON.stringify({n: 708919584551129326})\n=> \"{\"n\":708919584551129300}\"\n. :+1: \n. Maybe it's ngStorage or updating the Angular to 1.4 did this.\nPossibly related to this https://github.com/gsklee/ngStorage/issues/119\n. ``` yaml\n\nswagger: '2.0'\ninfo:\n  version: 0.0.0\n  title: Simple API\npaths:\n  /:\n    get:\n      parameters: [{}]\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: OK\n```\n@webron should this be invalid?\n. An empty object {} is the most generic JSON Schema You can use that...\n. Localization of labels in Swagger Editor is something we can do, although it's a very low priority. We should use something like angular translate to achieve it. Instead of using a query parameter we can use standard Accept-Language header. We can have a query parameter that overrides Accept-Language. That would be nice.\nProviding translation in spec description and summary is something that might come in next Swagger spec (swagger-api/swagger-spec#274). When it landed in spec, editor should also show correct language entry for description. \n. here you can use defaults.useYamlBackend to add Content-Type header to the operation based on YAML or JSON backend. Pretty much like here\n. No, Swagger Editor is not using Swagger.js. Isn't JWT just a token? I believe Swagger Editor should't care how your generate that token.\n. 'Bearer ' prefix is part of oAuth spec but when it comes to JWT outside of oAuth there is no spec or at least Swagger does not support it yet. \nThe best option right now is to prefix it yourself manually. \n. Hi,\nIn print stylesheet we do all the print specific business. It should hide the text editor and make the preview full-screen. It's a bug that it doesn't do it at the moment. Please open a pull request if you want this fixed immediately.\n. I guess it's because of extra .preview-mode class here\n. If you need it immediately please issue a pull request. I'll merge and publish\n. That was an issue on your system. It has nothing to do with Swagger Editor \n. It's permissions of files outside of Swagger Editor folder. I don't know what happened in your system. I can't reproduce it in my Mac.\n. Yes, it was a bug. It's fixed now\n. Duplicate of #592\n. For now, file only in body is supported.\n. @webron is this the only way to have file parameters in Swagger?\n. Works for me \n\nDid it happen during the compose time?\n. I've seen errors like this before. Happens when typing in the spec. I don't have exact steps to reproduce so we can use that to debug and fix it. If you can come up with exact steps to reproduce this issue please comment below otherwise we can't fix it. \n. Uncomment 9a73430 after fixing this\n. > how to define models in swagger\nSwagger uses a subset of JSON Schema with a little difference\n. What are steps to reproduce? \n. is http://coreapiteam-test.apigee.net capable of receiving CORS calls from swagger.io?\n. From what I see at your user.json file it seems that you're wrapping the schema in two objects which makes the schema invalid. You Person schema should probably be like this:\njson\n{\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"title\": \"Person\",\n      \"properties\": {\n          \"name\": {\n              \"type\": \"string\"\n          }\n      }\n }\n. Your JSON is invalid. You're missing a }\n. No need for a fragment here. \n. Works for me. What version of editor you're using?\n\n. I don't know about Swagger UI. Open an issue in it's own repo. For the editor please refresh the page and see if it's still having this issue\n. That is working on my machine! \n. Is this resolved?\n. Yes, in YAML you should define an alias before using it. If you put definitions after paths the OperationType anchor is used before being defined. I recommend defining all of your anchors on top under a free-form swagger extension \n``` yaml\nswagger: '2.0'\ninfo:\n  version: \"0.0.1\"\n  title: API\nx-types:\n  OperationType: &OperationType\n    - registration\nDescribe your paths here\npaths:\n  /checker:\n    get:\n      parameters:\n        - name: operations\n          in: query\n          type: array\n          items:\n            type: string\n            enum: *OperationType\n          default: [registration]\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: OK\n          schema:\n            $ref: '#/definitions/OperationType'\ndefinitions:    \n  OperationType:\n    type: string\n    enum: *OperationType\n```\n. Yes, CI only fails in TravisCI. It's a Firefox thing I'm working on it. This change looks good! Thanks!\n. I get following error:\n\u2716 Swagger Error\nReference could not be resolved: {base_url}/operations/users#basic-login\nJump to line 30\nDetails\n Object\ncode:  \"UNRESOLVABLE_REFERENCE\"\nmessage:  \"Reference could not be resolved: {base_url}/operations/users#basic-login\"\n path: Array [3]\n err: Error\nlevel: 900\nwhich makes sense. You can't do URL templating in $refs\n. I don't see URL templating for $ref values in that document either. Swagger Editor tries to resolve your $refs to show a complete Swagger document. If your $ref value is not a valid URI it can't do it. \n. Yes I can see it, your $ref has {basePath} in it. It's not a valid URL\n. Ah I see! Sorry I missed that. It should work with absolute URLs in editor.swagger.io. For example, try this Swagger document:\nyaml\nswagger: '2.0'\ninfo:\n  version: 0.0.0\n  title: My bug repro API\npaths:\n  /persons:\n    get:\n      description: Gets Person objects\n      parameters: []\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: Successful response\n          schema:\n            title: ArrayOfPersons\n            type: array\n            items:\n              $ref: 'http://crossorigin.me/http://coreapiteam-test.apigee.net/v1/swagger/user.json'\nPlease note that you need to have CORS enabled for those URLs. It's being requested from a different domain.\n. Ok I was able to reproduce this. I believe it's a bug in sway.\n. @yomexzo can you provide a swagger that produces that error? \n. That's an schema bug. @webron can you confirm?\n. Right. Maybe @glen-84 put int16 in type instead of format by mistake. I can't reproduce it:\n``` yaml\nswagger: '2.0'\ninfo:\n  version: 0.0.0\n  title: Simple API\npaths:\n  /:\n    get:\n      parameters:\n        - name: parameters\n          in: query\n          description: description\n          type: string\n          format: int16\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: OK\n          schema:\n            $ref: '#/definitions/Name'\ndefinitions:\n  Name:\n    type: string\n    format: int16\n``\n. I'm assuming you have changed the type tonumber`. \nWith that, int16 is throwing an error\nparameters:\n        - name: parameters\n          in: query\n          description: description\n          type: number\n          format: int16\n          default: 123\nbut int32 is fine. @webron is this a bug?\n. That's a long dependency chain! \nz-schema->sway->sway-worker->swagger-editor\nSo basically we should not throw an error for this format value.\n. This was fixed by b6714d1\n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#1166\n. If https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/617 gets implemented there is no need for this.\n. Closing in favor of #617\n. Can you share your Swagger document?\n. Which server and client generators did you try? I don't see any error with Uber example when I try it.\nYou can't attach files to GitHub issues. Please paste your Swagger here.\n. There was some indentation issues which I fixed, here is the fixed.

You can disablestrictDi` to get rid of this error \nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/app/scripts/bootstrap.js#L32\n. Yes, detecting development mode based on URL wasn't a good idea. We need to change that. Follow that feature request here\n. First of all, that language is not welcome here.\nThe preview panel is not a replacement for Swagger UI. It has editor specific components in it. Use swagger-ui for that matter.\n. Can you squash into one commit? Thanks!\n. Please use latest master if you are running locally. We will release 2.9.7 soon. \n. I see 2 input fields actually and one binary dropdown as I would expect from your schema.\n\n. Can  you be more clear? I don't see what you're describing here in editor.swagger.io. Are you using a hosted version?\n. Got it\n. Simpler Swagger for reproducing this issue:\n``` yaml\nswagger: '2.0'\ninfo:\n  version: 0.0.0\n  title: Simple API\npaths:\n  /:\n    post:\n      parameters:\n        - name: body\n          in: body\n          description: description\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/Test\"\n  responses:\n    '200':\n      description: OK\n\ndefinitions:\n  Test:\n    properties:\n      deep:\n        type: object\n        additionalProperties: true\n```\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks for reporting! \n@iflamed is this caused by session storage changes we made recently?\n. Actually I can't reproduce it in editor.swagger.io. Please see the screenshot.\nAlso note that if your request is cross origin, some of the headers won't be sent.\n\n. do you close and open \"try this operation\" panel after authorizing? It's a known bug that the security authentications don't update the try operation as you change them. \n. I thought we have a bug open for this but apparently we didn't. We'll keep this open until we fix it. \n. Thanks @chrisdudley! \n. Yup, code-gen menus are populated based on code-gen server response. No work needed to be done on editor side. \n. Go ahead @webron. If something is broken we should fix it. :)\n. Does showing something like this works?\n\n. SyntaxError: Unexpected end of script (blob:http://localhost:8080/30afbe0...\nSafari can't handle large blobs as source of script for web workers. It's a bug in Safari which they fixed in WebKit version 602.1.2+.\nCurrent Safari in OSX has WebKit version    600.8.9. Either use a newer WebKit engine or Chrome \n. @webron @fehguy It seems codegen server has an issue.\n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#1208\n. I believe editor goes to an infinite loop with your spec (the one you posted on original issue). I'm looking into it. \n. I've closed this bug which was related to the import dialog. the swagger you have in that URL still crashes the editor but I'll open a separate issue if I can confirm what exactly is going on\n. Can you write up a minimal swagger that produces this error?\n. Where car.yaml is hosted? To resolve the document those URLs should be reachable \n.  You should serve those files where editor is being server or use absolute URLs to your server\n. So if your index.yaml is a sibling of index.html of Swagger Editor in it should be able to resolve it.\n. We found a bug. Relative paths do not work for now due to this issue:\nhttps://github.com/whitlockjc/path-loader/issues/5\n. Example absolute path:\ndefinitions:\n  $ref: http://localhost:8080/files/definitions/index.yaml\n. Fixed in c80708b\n. After file is selected AngularJS doesn't digest the modal. If you click outside of the blu button it activates. \n. Good point! This includes git sha:\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/arangodb/arangodb/73ada35a0d64edfb821eefa7df26c617f5226d83/js/apps/system/_admin/aardvark/APP/api-docs.json\n. We have Docker help in development guide: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/docs/development.md#running-with-docker\nIt would be nice if you can improve on that. Please don't remove code blocks with language name. They help syntax highlighter highlight the code better.\nThanks!\n. We decided not to maintain an official image in Docker Hub for Swagger Editor. Please feel free to create and maintain one. There are a bunch of them in Docker Hub but they're not up to date. \n. Can you provide the swagger spec you have on editor when it crashes? File->Download is also working for me for default example in Firefox.\n. It's probably the same issue as #658 \n. Duplicate of https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/636\n. Merged in lucky 2000th commit! ;)\n. I think we have a memory leak issue #641 is reporting the same issue. These Swagger docs are really large but it shouldn't crash the browser. \n. That's a request for JSON Schema View dependency. \n. This issue was moved to mohsen1/json-schema-view-js#1\n. Yes, that's a know bug in swagger codegen. Please follow this: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/issues/1170\n. The way $ref works is it overrides all it's siblings and itself with content of where it's value pointing at\nYou can use standard global responses hash:\nswagger: '2.0'\ninfo:\n  version: 0.0.0\n  title: '<enter your title>'\npaths:\n  /persons:\n    get:\n      description: |\n        Gets `Person` objects.\n        Optional query param of **size** determines\n        size of returned array\n      parameters:\n        - name: size\n          in: query\n          description: Size of array\n          required: true\n          type: number\n          format: double\n      responses:\n        200:\n          $ref: '#/responses/200'\nresponses:\n  200:\n    description: Successful response\n. What browser you use? Can you run locally off latest in master and let me know if it's still an issue?\n. Please get the latest again. 45ad38a might have fixed it.\n. Can you try again?\n. Good idea. There is also responses in root level which we can render next to paths.\nPull request welcome! \n. Yes I believe we have a memory leak. Please see #651 and #641\n. are you sure you're running the latest and it's not cached? It is updated. See here\nI like the idea of updating it as part of build process. Pull request is welcome for that! \n. @webron @whitlockjc This is interesting! \n. Error reporting will get better after this is done. \n. Import File works for me. Are you trying the latest build?\n. This is a bug in YAML worker. https://github.com/mohsen1/yaml-worker/issues/3\n. Can you provide exact steps to reproduce this issue? A minimal Swagger spec would be very helpful.\n. Also please use the latest version.\n. You can add this to your branding.css file to hide anything but the preview\n``` css\n.total-wrapper > header,\n.editor.pane,\n.ui-splitbar,\n[tooltip-popup],\n.jump-to-yaml {\n    display: none !important;\n}\n.preview.pane {\n    position: fixed;\n    left: 0 !important;\n    top: 0 !important;\n    right: 0 !important;\n    width: 100% !important;\n    height: 100% !important;\n}\n```\nSwagger Editor preview pane is not designed to be a replacement of Swagger UI so the \"hack\" above is not officially supported. We will add more editor specific stuff to the right pane.\nI've started a project based on this feedback for rendering Swagger documents in a nicer way. Check it out here: https://github.com/mohsen1/swagger-docs\n. Are you on Windows? It's working fine for me on OS X.\n\nOne improvement that we can do on this is to add unicode-range to Source Code Pro font family in fonts.less file.\nSource Code Pro has a wide range. I'm pretty sure Russian characters are in it. See Google Fonts entry and Source Code Pro repo\n. I think that is the case. Can you run Swagger Editor locally and update the font file with latest from their GitHub repo and let me know the results? It would be nice if you make a pull request with that change. \n. I would love to take out fonts from source code but not all of them are available in bower/github. If you can do it even partially I would appreciate it.\n. Then lets keep having font files in the source code. It's more reliable and predictable. \n. ok, works for me. Does it install all variants(thicknesses)?\n. Somehow related to https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/599\nFile upload component is kind of hacky in editor. It needs a proper refactoring. \n. Thanks! \n. Are you using the latest version? I can't reproduce this.\n. You mean File -> Import JSON option. Ok got it.\n. Are you running a backend for editor?\n. You can use an empty string with one single space instead of an empty string with no character maybe?\n. If you are modifying editor code, please paste you code here so we can see what exactly you're doing\n. Instead of doing that, why don't you update the default yaml file to be an empty file? Possibly with a single new line or space in it\n. Try cleaning up node_modules and bower_components folders and install dependencies from scratch. Tests are passing in HEAD of master\n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-ui#1634\n. @webron Does JSON Schema hyper schema validate examples?\n. The schema that validates JSON schema is often called hyper schema. Ok, if it's not validated by JSON Schema schema (hyper schema) or Swagger schema then it can be a feature request for Swagger.Next.\n@dolmen Please open an issue in swagger-spec repo if you want to discuss having this validation in the next version of Swagger. \n. Well, the \"models\" in Swagger are a subset of JSON Schema (without anyOf or oneOf) so I thought Swagger is using a modified version of JSON Schema's schema for validation of models.\n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#1325\n. Do you import YAML or JSON\u061f \n. I can't reproduce this. Try pasting this YAML in a file and importing it:\nyaml\nswagger: '2.0'\ninfo:\n  version: 0.0.0\n  title: |\n    Simple API\n    Two\npaths:\n  /:\n    get:\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: OK\n. It is just line wrapping. Try making the editor pane wider\n. I can't reproduce this. We do nothing to YAML files that can change structure of the file during import. \n. Why do you have <br /> there?\n. It's not YAML, it's markdown behavior to require double line breaks for paragraph breaks. It's an expected behavior. We are using marked module for rendering markdown. It this behavior is not making sense ask them.\n. That's right. But the fact that your YAML changes when you import it is weird. Maybe it's a bug. I'll look later.\n. A JSON Schema like this: {\"type\": \"array\"} is describing an array with any element. It is valid JSON Schema. This is a problem in swagger-codegen where it doesn't like arrays without items schema. \n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#1344\n. For rendering JSON Schema object we are using json-schema-view-js lib which does not support Markdown. Swagger Editor can not change behavior of this lib and this behavior is not something common to add to the lib. \n. LGTM!\n. You can use Sway node module for validating your spec. \n. Yup, works for me. Here is the swagger that I used:\n`` yaml\nswagger: '2.0'\ninfo:\n  version: 0.0.0\n  title: '<enter your title>'\npaths:\n  /persons:\n    get:\n      description: |\n        GetsPersonobjects.\n        Optional query param of **size** determines\n        size of returned array\n      parameters:\n        - name: size\n          in: body\n          description: Size of array\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/ArrayOfPersons\"\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: Successful response\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/ArrayOfPersons\"\ndefinitions:\n  ArrayOfPersons:\n    title: ArrayOfPersons\n    type: array\n    items:\n      title: Person\n      type: object\n      properties:\n        birthday: \n          type: string\n          pattern: '^(\\d{2}-\\d{2})$'\n          description: | \n            \"Birthday\\\n            \\ is optional but if sent, it should be sent in the formatMM-dd` (we do\\\n            \\ not store or care about the year). \\n\"}\n    name:\n      type: string\n    single:\n      type: boolean\n\n```\nThe gh-pages version hasn't been updated for a while though. master might be different. \n. Yes, duplicate of #514 and it's a dependency issue. Please follow the links in that issue. \n. Most of Docker images out there build the editor on start which is pointless. A good Docker image would be only the dist folder + a lightweight webserver. If release of Docker image becomes part of the release it would be super great!\n. I guess you don't want to push to DockerHub on each commit to master. The grunt ship command is a better place to put this script:\nAdd your script to this file as a new task:\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/grunt/shell.js\nadd that to grunt ship task list: \nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L74\nThen we can hook grunt ship to TravisCI tags to publish to npm and Docker: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/npm \n. Cool!\n. Correct way of having a multi-line string is using pipe with nothing after it (|)\n``` yaml\nswagger: '2.0'\ninfo:\n  version: v2\n  title: Address API\n  description: |\n    Provisioning Service provides following \n     capabilities to provision data needed for Address services.\n * Address API\n\n Note&#58; Some notes\n\n```\n. LGTM!\n. It's unnecessary to run npm install. Pre-start scripts will do it\n. There is never enough badges in README! ;)\n. If example is conforming to the schema you don't really need to traverse the example and add it layer by layer. There are some style errors (single quotes and other styling issues). Please add an end-to-end test for this.\n. You basically need to attach the example to parameters in bodyModel. The form generator will figure it out. \nOne thing we need to make sure is when example is not conforming to the schema. Since that is possible we need to check it before assignment \n. Problem with preview only mode is it's maintenance. We have to maintain this is working for each change. Swagger Editor wants to be the editor, not the UI. It's going to have a lot more editing components in the \"preview\" pane so it's going to be harder to maintain this mode. \nWe used to have preview only mode but decided to make editor focus on editing Swagger and UI for rendering Swagger. If Swagger UI is missing features, please make a ticket there and ask for it. \nI'm afraid I should say no to merging this although many people are asking for it. This pull request can be a good example of how you do it on your own.\n. I think \"electronification\" of the editor is done previously:\nhttp://blog.takuros.net/entry/2015/12/21/091330\nhttps://github.com/malko/swagged\n. Then it's a json-refs issue that mixes a web worker environment with node.js environment I believe. Please confirm and file an issue to json-refs.\n. Why you need authentication to respond to an OPTIONS call? I don't know how it's possible to control jQuery's preflight OPTIONS call to be honest. \n. @saharj Can you find what CSS selector is overriding the font-size in this instance? \n. I believe some parent element is having a font-size property. It's not easy to find which parent is it though \n. Moving to Angular2 doesn't give this project a lot of benefits to be honest. A complete rewrite makes sense but that's a lot of work...\n. Even the right side has a lot of Angular 1 dependency. There isn't a lot of benefits to this move at this time. Specially that Angular2 is still in beta. Dependencies are also a blocking factor. Just adding Angular 2 for template rendering doesn't make sense. Angular 1 does a good job for that.\n. ```\n\u25b6\ufe0e http-server --help\nusage: http-server [path] [options]\noptions:\n  -p           Port to use [8080]\n  -a           Address to use [0.0.0.0]\n  -d           Show directory listings [true]\n  -i           Display autoIndex [true]\n  -e --ext     Default file extension if none supplied [none]\n  -s --silent  Suppress log messages from output\n  --cors       Enable CORS via the \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\" header\n  -o [path]    Open browser window after starting the server\n  -c           Cache time (max-age) in seconds [3600], e.g. -c10 for 10 seconds.\n               To disable caching, use -c-1.\n-P --proxy   Fallback proxy if the request cannot be resolved. e.g.: http://someurl.com\n-S --ssl     Enable https.\n  -C --cert    Path to ssl cert file (default: cert.pem).\n  -K --key     Path to ssl key file (default: key.pem).\n-r --robots  Respond to /robots.txt [User-agent: *\\nDisallow: /]\n  -h --help    Print this list and exit.\n```\nPer http-server help this is correct.\nLGTM\n. @srinivascodes \nIf you want to make a lot of changes why don't you just fork this repo and make those changes manually? \n.

    "GerardSoleCa": "Hello!\nI'm working on this issue for personal enjoy and entertainment. By now I've achived to persist yaml to session but instead of using a unique key, I'm using the YAML title (info.title). By doing this it's possible to save multiple files to localstorage and then retrieve them.\nNow I've this feature working but I need to fix two little issues:\n- Default YAML loading duplicates the file\n- Saving text on top, is stuck on working...\nPS: I don't know if I should open a new issue, or only this one...\nPS2: I'll push a sample on my gh-pages to test and then a PR to this repository :)\n. Issues addressed. I'm maintaining the yaml key as the current opened api, but it is saved as yaml and info.title. So header text is working fine and duplicates are not a problem.\n. PR is done, hope you like it! :)\n. If title is edited it will be saved as a new YAML API Key. I reuse the SwaggerEditorCache keystore and then add the title as a key, so the localstorage will look like:\njs\nngStorage-SwaggerEditorCache : {\n    \"intro\": true,\n    \"progress\": 1,\n    \"yaml\": \"....\",\n    \"Uber API\": \"....\",\n    \"My Custom API\": \"....\"\n}\nExample:\nIf I'm editing My Custom API its YAML will be saved to yaml key (maintain compatibility with listeners and loaders) and to My Custom API key in order to store any changes done to that API.\nThe keys [intro, progress and yaml] are not shown in the modal.\nNow I'm working with the possibility to clean non-desired APIs\n. That's true, too much work on user's premises. I didn't know about JSBin, I'll stay tuned for incoming updates!\nAre you thinking about how will you implement that backend? In example nodejs+mongo?\n. Hi,\nI like that backend schema/idea but what happens if I'm editing my API and then I loose my cookies, or just change between browser/computer. The ownership of that API  will be still recoverable?\n. Nice!\nI'll stay tunned about future releases!,\nThanks!\n.

Yes, but for far in the future.\n. @fehguy  Is this a top-level declaration? Do you have any suggestions regarding initial key, e.g. \"SkipQueryParam\"?\n. OK, here is a refiddle: http://refiddle.com/refiddles/536d185075622d7b97cb0100\nI've updated line 81 of mode-yaml.js in the app, but I'm not seeing the change.

Do I commit it anyway? \nAnd should I submit it as a merge request back to ACE?\n. Answer may well be to simplify the YAML (uncouple it somewhat from the JSON spec) to make this more intuitive.\n. We will remove the redundancy in the YAML spec.\n. Desired syntax is available in app/spec-files/consolidated.yaml\n. Swagger-JSON begins with a root description that lists the resource families. Each family then has its own description. YAML may also get to the point where it needs to be split and included. But for now, having the separate description files complicates the back-and-forth. We need to figure out how to reconcile the two.\n. @fehguy I believe this is covered now. If there is anything further that hasn't been covered, please bring that to a new issue.\n. @fehguy Any other parts of that editor that are ripe for reuse?\n. Marsh to refactor into separate issues.\n. @fehguy dumb question, but where does that live? I browsed the repos and wikis for swagger-ui and swagger-core, but didn't see it. \n. This would make the existing html controls redundant. Consider removing from the template or hiding them with CSS?\n. By supporting markdown, we support html, as it is a superset.\n.

Also, it looks like the old regex patterns are being used for YAML syntax highlighting. oauth2, for example isn't doing what it should any more.\n.

A crude mockup:\n\n\nAt the beginning, it would work at the operation level. Later it could become smarter about jumping to the param level, but the mouseover target gets trickier, etc.\n. :thumbsup: I LOVE the new jump-tos, see:\n\nThe styling/positioning of the element isn't final, but the functionality ROCKS.\n. @miguelpuyol lots of work happening on it at the moment, but it must have been pushed in a broken state.

No, it's really a general purpose, but until there is a good YAML reference, that's the best I've seen.\n. \u2026 and allow a jump-to button! :)\n. But Ace has conflicted with browser defaults, so we need to did what they broke.\n. You mean to get the available clients?\n. @webron, does this address your issue, or are you asking for this to be checked as part of validation (or something else entirely)?\n. :boom: there it is\n. Also, b/c it currently throws a validation error, I'm backing off the change to the YAML examples to use the number. Whenever this issue is fixed on the validation side, we should update the examples.\n. Thanks! This got missed before it shipped last week. Good catch.\n. The import param does work (example), but there may be complicating factors in specific case:\n1. the editor is running on an http endpoint, and loading a resource over https may trigger browser security errors (solution might be to check for these and alert the user).\n2. the ?dl=1 forces the browser to download rather than load the data, which might be throwing things off.\n.

HI @mohsen1 luckily it's not a blob upload--it's pure JSON.  You can use the swagger-js client if you like, although it's probably easier to just use the ajax support with angular.\nThe payload for the post requests is just JSON data.\n. great--yes, i did that to keep it manageable on the CLI.\n. what endpoint are you hitting?  I see it open to all:\n```\ncurl -i http://generator.wordnik.com/online/api/gen/clients\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, DELETE, PUT\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type\nContent-Type: application/json\nContent-Length: 38\nServer: Jetty(9.1.3.v20140225)\n[\"android\",\"java\",\"php\",\"objc\",\"docs\"]\n```\nI'll try that branch\n. When I run it, it's sending as a GET:\n\nalso the path should be as such:\nhttp://generator.wordnik.com/online/api/gen/clients/{language}  for clients\nand\nhttp://generator.wordnik.com/online/api/gen/servers/{framework} for servers\ni think this changed from my initial deployment\n. Also note that you can get a list of all the clients supported by calling this endpoint:\nhttp://generator.wordnik.com/online/api/gen/clients\nor\nhttp://generator.wordnik.com/online/api/gen/servers\nwhich will be handy for populating your drop-down.\n. Hi, it's still appending the JSON body to the query string.  The error you're getting is because the URL is > 4096 bytes.\n\n. great checking\n. Must be--I've been using \"js-yaml\": \"~3.0\" and it works fine:\nhttps://github.com/wordnik/swagger-codegen/blob/master/bin/yml2swagger.js\n. Should this go in the swagger-spec repo?\n. Yes, I can reproduce this.  You can also download any client library and you'll see a \"specs\" folder in the zip file, which will contain the JSON files.\n. The server was down, thanks for reporting it.\n. Hah, I found the issue.  There's a codepath in the swagger-codegen that's doing a sys.exit(0) when a validation error occurs :)  I'm patching that now.\n. ok @gregoryfoster it's back and fixed.\n. https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-generator/issues/1\n. The server has been updated to give more friendly messages.  The description of the payload is here:\nhttp://generator.wordnik.com/online/api/api-docs/gen\nAn example is:\njson\n[\n  {\n    \"path\": \"/albums:/albums:parameter\",\n    \"message\": \"name is required\",\n    \"severity\": \"ERROR\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"path\": \"/albums:/albums:[unknown]\",\n    \"message\": \"type is required\",\n    \"severity\": \"ERROR\"\n  }\n]\nThese will be refined quickly but the structure will remain as stated.\n. It is not done yet.  Wait you said to comment if it was done.\n. Hi, the resulting docs use ajax calls, so they need to be run on the web server of your choice.\n. I just updated the template from the codegen project.  Can you please try again?  I've verified it's working with the sample description in the editor.\n. I suggest you follow the locations in the schema for the key vendorExtension.  Since X- is not allow by the schema, no need to apply a rule to exclude it, imho\nhttps://github.com/reverb/swagger-spec/blob/master/schemas/v2.0/schema.json#L268\n. this would be great for sharing links to swagger specs\nhttp://editor.swagger.wordnik.com/?spec=http://generator.wordnik.com/online/api/swagger.yaml\n. you rock @mohsen1 \n. there are other opts taht belong in the payload that are required for generating a good client.  Such as package names, versions, artifact id, etc.  I just haven't documented them yet.\n. i think that's a different use case.  I'm a consumer, and i want to build a java client against mohsen's api.  I have my own package names, versions, etc. that I want to use--has nothing to do with the server, nor the spec.  I discover your spec, and i want to use my configs for the client.\n. Sure will shortly. There is an API call to get the list of supported clients. If you can use that, backend updates will be seamless\n. yes, there is a swagger spec for this:\nhttp://generator.wordnik.com/online/api/swagger.json\n. ok updated to name as swagger, and you'll see that importing the URL:\nhttp://generator.wordnik.com/online/api/swagger.yaml\nworks beautifully in the swagger editor.  The whole swagger model definition is imported, since it's a dependency in the inputs.\n. thanks--fixed the page.\n. Looking into it.  @mohsen1 are you referencing the schema dynamically?  Will the editor pick up the changes?\n. well looking at the schema, the operation-level consumes/produces are correct:\nhttps://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec/blob/master/schemas/v2.0/schema.json#L214-L229\nIf anything is wrong, we would not allow additional properties on line 44.  My tests are passing and I think the schema is handling these correctly.\n@mohsen1 how are you doing the schema validation in the editor?\n. I've confirmed that the object being validated is indeed correct--the validator itself seems to be failing.  I saw that Z-Schema is the way the tests are being run because of bugs in tv4!  Maybe that's our root problem.\n\n. Hi @geraintluff thanks for looking.  The schema is here:\nhttps://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec/blob/master/schemas/v2.0/schema.json\nIs the editor linking to the schema dynamically, or is it copied into the project?\n. Thanks!  And that's telling me there's a static link between the editor and schema--I will make sure we keep them synchronized.  The spec documentation is the source of truth, but we would like the schema to be as close as possible to that.\nThe errors we had are visible from here:\nhttps://travis-ci.org/wordnik/swagger-spec\nThe tests are executed with mocha.  We have implemented both tv4 and zschema, and configure mocha to use zschema as such:\nexport VALIDATORS=zschema\nI didn't write the tests, but can find out specifically what the issue was.\n. Great.  I will get the schema behind our reverse proxy and add the appropriate headers.  Will open a new issue to track that.\n. I will provide a URL behind a proxy which points to github.  It's not done yet, will update the ticket when ready.\n. Hi having a back end is out of scope for this project.  It's developed so you can add one, but it doesn't belong here in this project.\n. It's not due to swagger hub, it's a separation of concerns for this product. Same reason why swagger-UI doesn't ship with a server either. \n. +1\n. back up--must have been transient.\n. Hi, if you're having trouble with the swagger-ui not rendering these parameters, can you please open an issue in that repository?  What I see here should be supported.\nBut in swagger-editor, it doesn't make sense to have a relative file location like ../commons/headers.yaml.  Why?  Because swagger-editor doesn't have a notion of the location of the spec file.  It's meant for being edited in-place, not remotely.  Some have suggested that the host should be used along with basePath for relative locations--however that doesn't make sense as that's the location for the API calls, not the specification file.\nIf you want a reference, the editor needs absolute or local refefrences.  Relative ones doesn't make sense\n. Anything that makes assumptions about how you're deploying which is outside of the specification itself is prone to being abused.  Can you share more about what you're describing?  How would you tell the editor that you're hosting the file at a particular location?\n. I'd be open to making swagger.io have a proxy which sets the headers appropriately. The only concern I have (and why I have not done it) is a good plan to avoid abuse\n. I don't know if raw links work with the url import. @mohsen1 ?\n. Hang on. I meant \"it will not work directly\" due to cors. Yes you can use a proxy but that's aa different question\n. Two things.\nFirst, you are probably getting the error when choosing swagger from the generate client menu.  That option is really intended for converting swagger specifications from 1.x to 2.0 and downloading the JSON representation.  For the editor's sake, it's really not even needed.  We'll hide it.\nSecond, there was one defect when generating java clients from your spec.  That's been fixed.\nIf you see issues in the code generation, please open them here:\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen\n. Can you please open this against swagger-codegen?\n. Your routes are using ruby-style syntax (I think).  You need to use curly brackets and declare the parameter item in the parameters section\n. You can paste JSON or import a 2.0 URL, I believe JSON format works fine:\n\n. I believe this issue lives deep in a dependency.  It thinks the number 0 is false the boolean, due to implicit conversions.  Not sure how it can be fixed.  @saharj is there a downstream library that we can report the issue to?\n. @mohsen1 does this mean you're suggesting support of non-swagger spec files inside the editor, by using the comment as the indicator?\n. No, this is a bug.  We're working on it, but it's caused deep in one of the dependencies.  We'll close this out when it's addressed (I know, it's annoying).\n. @SGrondin--wow.  Consider joining the community effort by contributing code rather than just complaints.  I bet everyone would appreciate that.. Sorry @SGrondin, you're being an ass about this.  I think you're missing the whole point of OSS--consider @RobWin's suggestion and good luck. @pals-sj-ca can you please try testing with master, locally?\n. Huh?\n. Ok well, if you want to share details of you issue, then it's possible that we can help.  But not much can be done with your comment from the other day.\n. You need to share more information.  For example:\nyaml\nswagger: '2.0'\ninfo:\n  version: \"0.0.0\"\n  title: a demo\npaths:\n  /persons:\n    post:\n      parameters:\n        - name: size\n          in: query\n          description: Size of array\n          required: true\n          type: number\n          format: double\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: Successful response\n          schema:\n            title: hello\n            description: it's an all of\n            allOf:\n              - $ref: '#/definitions/ArrayResponse'\n              - $ref: '#/definitions/Person'\ndefinitions:\n  ArrayResponse:\n    type: object\n    properties:\n      count:\n        type: integer\n        format: int32\n  Person:\n    type: object\n    properties:\n      name:\n        type: string\nWorks just fine in the editor.\n\nSo if you're having an issue, if you don't share the details then how do you expect to get help?\n. Master handles this just fine.\n\n. @praveensrao I see the issue.  I have slimmed down the sample below to reproduce it.  @saharj can you please look at this?\nyaml\nswagger: '2.0'\ninfo:\n  title: xcsdfs\n  version: 1.0.0\npaths:\n  /configuration:\n    post:\n      parameters:\n        - name: testing\n          in: body\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/Simple\"\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: A test\ndefinitions:\n  Simple:\n    allOf:\n    - type: object\n      properties:\n        merchantProfileId:\n          type: string\n\n. Ok @stevendearborn as @webron said, oneOf is simply not supported and if it does, that is a bug.  However we are in the process of updating the specification and this is one of the more requested features.\nSo unless we wan't to rename this ticket as \"swagger editor should not support oneOf\", I'm going to close this.  Please jump in the spec rep and add your 0.02 bitcoin...\n. thanks, I've merged #707 (I guess @mohsen1 is on vacation :) )\n. I don't really think we want to only support a single java client.  Keeping Android separate is a good idea, and even though the manifest has been added to java, I think it should go back to being separate.\n. Agreed but I would rather address that root problem in the codegen \n. many like it more.  many hate it.  right now, it's a separate project, and I believe you can disable the editor portion.\n. yes, the primary author is on soma holiday right now so if you'd like to dig in yourself that'd be best.\n. This is indeed a duplicate. Let's track in the other issue. \n. Can you please share more of your spec?

Please reopen if you have questions\n. follow here:  https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/issues/325\n. in the editor, it's a little odd.  Simply put, the relative URL is supposed to be relative to the location of the swagger definition.\nIf the swagger URL was loaded from http://foo.bar.com/swagger.json, the relative location should be http://foo.bar.com/schema/response-status.schema.  If the URL was loaded from http://foo.bar.com/ (note, trailing slash), it'd be relative to that location.\nBut since the editor doesn't have a location to load from (you could import it), the relative location doesn't make much sense.  If we had to solve this, I would say it's relative to the scheme + host + basePath location, but even that you could argue is wrong.\n@RitwikChatterjee what is it you're expecting it to resolve to?\n. @pgtelus that's not really correct.  What's being discussed here is \"relative file paths\", which in an editor context, do not make sense because there is no \"root path\" for the swagger definition being edited.\nWe can infer something, but it will always be wrong.  For example, the host + basePath is for the api and most people do not deploy the swagger definition there.\n. @pgtelus yes it does.  You need to use absolute paths:\n$ref: http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json#/definitions/Pet\nWorks just fine as a schema item.  The only issue here was about the paths being relative which doesn't make sense for the editor.\n. so you are saying the requirement for a relative location of shared files?  How about opening a new issue specifically on that and we can see how it could be handled.  As previously suggested, it's not clear what they need to be relative to.\n. sure, thank you\n. Please take a look at https://hub.docker.com/r/swaggerapi/swagger-editor/\nIt is now simply serving up pre-build code as you are, and is maintained by pushing to latest on each commit to master.  In addition, tags will be auto-deployed to dockerhub.\nIf you have improvements to the image, please feel free to send a PR!\n. Yes, if you think that'll do it\n. Yes, you are correct.  Internally, the swagger-schema that is used by the editor has a bug in it, making it different from the one used by the validator.  It should be flagging these references as invalid.\n. I believe this is in your local cache.\nThe default document is valid.  Let's figure out if this is an environment issue or other.  Please clear your local cache for editor.swagger.io and report back \n. Great, thanks\n. Try changing the response type to Animal, which is a common pattern:\nyaml\nswagger: '2.0'\ninfo:\n  version: 0.0.0\n  title: Simple API\npaths:\n  /:\n    get:\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: OK\n          schema: \n            $ref: \"#/definitions/Animal\"\ndefinitions:\n  Animal:\n    type: object\n    discriminator: petType\n    properties:\n      commonName:\n        type: string\n  Cat:\n    allOf:\n      - $ref: '#/definitions/Animal'\n      - type: object\n        properties:\n          isFurry:\n            type: boolean\n            default: false\nThis will define the basic response as an Animal and concrete implementations by the discriminator field.\n. It is a tiny bit different.  Think of Animal as the generic response for the operation--it returns some kind of animal but you don't know what.\nWhen the discriminator value is set to Cat in the response, the client knows that the response type is actually a Cat rather than generic Animal.\nSince we don't actually know what type could be in the response (it may refer to Alien) of which there is no definition in the schema, we look at the allOf references.  Because Cat is referencing Animal in an allOf construct, we know that it's a possible response type, and therefore it is \"in use\".\nDoes that make sense?\n. No, as of now there is no work around other than ignoring the warning\n. eh, well this is probably due to some underlying npm dependencies.  Do you need to rebuild the server?  Or can you use the pre-built version?\n. Got it--then I suggest following this part of the README:\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor#using-http-server-module\nnpm install -g http-server\nwget https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/releases/download/v2.9.8/swagger-editor.zip\nunzip swagger-editor.zip\nhttp-server swagger-editor\nNote you don't even need to use the http-server if you have your own server.  You really just need the contents of swagger-editor unpacked and accessible in some http server.\n. No problem.  The docker image is not official (our docker organization is called swaggerapi) and we will be adding one there.\n. @mohsen1 we are slowly adding docker images to our ci builds and will do it with editor as soon as we fix the failing tests:\nhttp://dockerhub.com/u/swaggerapi\n. OK I'm going to close this out, please reopen with any other issues.\n. Now available as https://hub.docker.com/r/swaggerapi/swagger-editor/\n. All done, thanks.\n. It'll push to latest if and only if the commit was made by someone who has configured credentials.  So that's just me :)\nIf it's a tag, then it'll be pushed and tagged as well\n. I don't know much about alpine linux (i'm a slow learner) but based on usage, it seems pretty darn legit.  So let's give this a go.\n. the swagger editor uses this service, which is online and readily available:\nhttp://generator.swagger.io/\nYou can generate a client to call that, or script it with python.\n. You don't need to build to use the editor. See the read me or pull the Docker image\n. Please try clearing your browser cache.  I've seen that cause trouble with spurious errors.\n. By definition, you cannot authenticate on OPTIONS.  This is a server configuration, @famer \n. Please open a ticket on swagger-codegen.\n. This is not possible with browser technology\n. Please open this on swagger-codegen.\n. thanks, i've removed it.  If you find any others, please send a PR.\n. That's a problem with your server, not swagger-editor.  Please enable CORS on your server.\n. sorry, that's your server not sending the appropriate headers, not the swagger editor.  tell your server to return access-control-allow-origin: * and it'll work fine.\n. awesome!\n. It actually is documented. Version is a string, and should be quoted to avoid automatic conversion to a number\n. @jehrlich if a string can be implicitly converted to a number, it will be treated as such.  A string of 0.0.0 can not be converted into a number and is therefore treated as a string.  I understand it can be confusing, but this is how YAML works.  You can always choose to quote every string to be clear that they are intended to be strings.\n. Looking into this\n. It looks like this works fine--be sure you follow these steps:\n```\npull deps\nnpm i\nbuild the distribution\nnpm run build\nbuild the docker image\ndocker build --no-cache -t swagger-editor .\nrun it on localhost:8080\ndocker run -p 8080:8080 swagger-editor\n```\nMy guess is you were missing the build step.  Can you please re-try and report back?\n. Not possible I think, editor doesn't use nginx \n. @ralfhandl doesn't matter.  The spec isn't supposed to support it.  As said, it's an error in the documentation.  If we supported arrays for type, we wouldn't have as many conversations about anyOf, etc.\n. We're certainly not being consensus driven on the spec, but we do know there needs to be some way to address this.  Please follow https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/issues/579\n. I believe we were going for IE9+.  But @owenconti you're saying IE9 is not supportable without major efforts?\n. Hi, you cannot use $ref with any sibling attributes.  This isn't an issue with swagger, it's a design constraint of JSON pointers.  It shouldn't be allowed in Apiary's tool, either, you should open a bug there.  Furthermore your use of $ref with path parameters is forbidden by the spec.  You can only use primitives or arrays of primitives.\nIf you want to reuse your definition of, say, IntID, consider something like this:\n``` yaml\n...\nget:\n    parameters:\n      - $ref: '#/parameters/IntID'\n...\nparameters:\n  IntID:\n    in: path\n    name: id\n    type: number\n    format: double\n    minimum: 1\n``\n. @saharj are you looking to publish builds from master or just releases?\n. Sure looks good to me!\n. LGTM!\n. What behavior do we want?  It seems like we should be pushinglatesttags on builds from master.\n. Hi, that formatJSONis not supported.  You'll have to leave it asstringwithout a format for now\n. @SandeshSarfare the Amazon API Gateway doesn't support all features in the Swagger Specification.  You can read up on their docs, or use the API Gateway integration on SwaggerHub to do this for you.\n. You'll need to log into the Amazon Gateway console and test it there.  I suggest you move your question over to the SwaggerHub support forum https://community.smartbear.com/swaggerhub\n. Correct, that _is_ technically supported but I believe the tooling (including the editor) doesn't like it.\n. Please open this in the swagger-codegen project.\n. By definition, theOPTIONScall can **not** be secured.  Please see that you can remove the basic auth requirement from the options call then it should work.\n. You cannot use the relative reference syntax in the editor.  Why?  Because what is it relative to?  You can use external references but please use the entire host/port/path to them.\n. Hi, please try again.  Was doing some maintenance on that server.\n. reopen if still an issue...\n. I think you should open this on swagger-core, doesn't look like an editor issue.\n. You'll see a fix shortly. You really have to give details if you want help.  This isn't a forensics panel\n. @cshar7 please read up on how JSON schema works.  What @webron showed definesRelatedCategoriesas an object, which has keys with the valueMyUnknownObject.  That's whatadditionalPropertiesmeans.\n. there is no python in swagger-editor.  Do you mean you're using a python package to read the definition?  Or are you using codegen?\n. ok got it.  Please open an issue in swagger-codegen for this issue.  I believe the underlying issue will be in the underlying [zalando connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library\n. I'm looking into this\n. We are only pushing tagged releases, not from master.  Last release was [Jul-14](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/releases)\n. YourallOfsyntax is wrong, and you spelledallOf` wrong (computers are very picky about this stuff)\nyaml\ndefinitions:\n  foo:\n    allOf:\n    - $ref: '#/definitions/bar'\n    - $ref: '#/definitions/baz'\n  bar:\n    properties:\n      bar:\n        type: string\n  baz:\n    properties:\n      bar:\n        type: string\n. no longer relevant with the 3.x branch. OK, so you're changing an example, which isn't really necessary.  The existing example is valid, and it can be changed to run on any port a user wants (even 666).  But the README is not wrong, and using port 80 for a web server is pretty much the norm.\n. Thanks, this is a known issue and we have a fix that should get in shortly.\n. Yes, you can only use strings for the required array, and they should reference existing, available property names.. That's not quite what I'm saying.  You would declare the required fields inside your object.  So for example:\nyaml\nUser:\n  required:\n  - id  # id is required\n  - address # the address object is required, but we don't specify _here_ what is required in the object itself\n  properties:\n    id:\n      type: string\n    address:\n      type: object\n      required:\n      - street # street property is required\n      properties:\n        street:\n          type: string\nSo think of the required attribute as having \"no object depth\".  It only applies to properties in the current hierarchical scope.  If you want to look into an object property, you would define it there, like I did in the address object. We can't change the syntax for the required field because it's straight from JSON schema.  But possibly improve the display.  Can you please explain more?\n. The error message you're getting is per the swagger specification, not the implementation.  See here, the operationId is expected to be unique across the document.. Yes, also publishing to docker has the added benefit of flexing the docker build.  Just did this on swagger-ui as well.. what does that mean?. You'll have to in-line the $ref for right now.  A fix is on the way, but it's a major redo, not a simple update. no problem.  Just change from this:\nyaml\n      parameters:\n        - name: graduation_school\n          in: formData\n          description: The school the translator graduated from\n          required: false\n          type: array\n          items:\n            $ref: '#/definitions/bar'\nto this:\nyaml\n      parameters:\n        - name: graduation_school\n          in: formData\n          description: The school the translator graduated from\n          required: false\n          type: array\n          items:\n            type: string. See here:  https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md\nThis defines the entire structure that the spec supports.. The editor is an editor. The UI is a UI and is used for viewing and documenting.  it has confused some people but we have separated the concerns intentionally. . In JSON Schema, $ref does not allow siblings.  Thus description in all of the above will be ignored (the editor should be warning you about this).  So yes, you should not expect it to work, and yes, their example too is incorrect.\n. that darn @fehguy. I think you're talking about the online generator and self-hosted editor.  You can host yourself if you need it in different scheme.. Yes, you can configure the editor and run your own generator.  Take a look at the configuration for the editor.. Looks great on the 3.x editor version:\nhttps://editor.swagger.io/\n\n. Hi, as we have limited resources, our efforts are focused on the new version, which will allow us to support the next specification. If someone can create a PR for the 2.x series, with tests, we can certainly get it in. . try this?\nhttp://online.swagger.io/validator/debug?url=http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.yaml. http://online.swagger.io/validator/debug?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swagger-api/swagger-parser/master/modules/swagger-parser/src/test/resources/sampleWithMinimumValues.yaml\nIt works fine.  Maybe the issue is your spec is bad?. @DavidBiesack we have done so--in the 3.x version, you can extend the editor very easily.  Please take a look at how the new code is structured, and you can now implement plugins to add additional logic on the existing editor.. Sure thing and yes, docs are needed.. Hi @orientzc you are correct, the editor at https://editor.swagger.io and the latest docker image are the most current version of the editor, and that is missing the generate buttons.  If you need them, please use the previous version, v2.10.5.  Since this a duplicate of #1224, please follow that issue for resolution.. I believe we've used this process in the past:\n\nKeep tags in the order defined (if there is an order defined), otherwise use alpha\nSort operations by path, alpha-ascending, then by HTTP operation \"commonality\":\nGET\nPOST\nPUT\nDELETE\n{others}\n\nI think that was pretty intuitive in the past.. well the editor is yaml-only.  So the whole thing should be marked as invalid!!!  Switch to YAML, please.. swagger: 2.0 must be swagger: \"2.0\" (i.e. a string).  Start there, and make your operation id values unique.. ",
    "webron": "Closing as a very old ticket. Please open a new one if still relevant.. Closing as a very old ticket. Please open a new ticket if still relevant.. Closing as a very old ticket. Please open a new ticket if still relevant.. Closing as a very old ticket. Please open a new ticket if still relevant.. My bad. I meant the \"swagger\" property (though it's valid for \"version\" as well).\nIf you look at http://editor.swagger.wordnik.com/, you'll see that it says\nyaml\nswagger: 2.0\nat the top, but if you export it to json, the output is:\njs\n\"swagger\": 2\n. Almost. The top \"swagger' field should also have \"2.0\" as value.\n. :thumbsup:\nI'm not really that familiar with YAML and its transformation to JSON. I believe it would have been more user-friendly had the user not had to add quotes around values that are definitely strings, but I understand the possible limitations. I'm not sure how validation is performed by the tool, but it should definitely not pass validation if a numeric value is used instead.\n. Fair enough. I'm nearly done updating the Swagger 2.0 spec, so I'm fairly familiar with the various edge cases and restrictions. If there's anything specific (or general) that you'd like me to review, please let me know.\n. I think there's still a problem. It does save it as a string, but the default value is 2 and not 2.0 as it should be.\n. It is split into two cases:\n1. Parameters that are \"in\": \"body\" - require the \"schema\" property.\n2. All other parameter types require the \"type\" property.\nThis is reflected in the latest major update to the schema - \nhttps://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec/blob/master/schemas/v2.0/schema.json#L455-L459\nhttps://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec/blob/master/schemas/v2.0/schema.json#L849-L853\nWith detailed information in the spec itself - https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#parameterObject\n. I'd suggest changing the yaml file name here too - https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-editor/blob/master/app%2Fscripts%2Fcontrollers%2Fheader.js#L141 - to swagger.yaml if only for consistency.\n. @mohsen1 - it seems to still export as spec.json?\n. Thanks!\n. @davisford - copying the snippet @krallin provided above into the editor works just fine.\n. You gotta add required: true to path parameters.\n. Can you provide a sample YAML/JSON to reproduce it?\n. @joseflexa - I just tested it and it seems to work fine.\nThe only difference is that is should be in: formData.\n. Are you using the hosted editor or did you build the latest version?\nCan you possibly add a screenshot of the issue you're seeing?\n. @joseflexa ?\n. @whitlockjc - yup, you're right about the format.\n@paraskakis - we already went over the problem with the \"items\" definition in the mailing list.\n@mohsen1, @whitlockjc - I think he still got the warning when using the correct format.\n. Oh my, yes, that's just wrong. Would you mind opening an issue about it on swagger-spec and I'll get around to fix it?\n. Keep in mind that operation parameters can override the ones defined at the path level (but not remove them).\n. Basically, you add a security definition of type apiKey, setting it as a header.\nAfter that, assuming you need to set it for all operations, you refer to it from the security property.\nNow, since you probably don't want to require it for the authentication method you have in your API, you can override and remove that requirement by setting the security property of the operation to an empty list.\n. Are you sure you're using the latest version? Just tried it on the online editor and it shows the parameter.\n. @mohsen1 - could this be related to the name of the property? It looks like if I change it from \nyaml\nparameters:\n  index:\n    name: index\nto:\nyaml\nparameters:\n  index1:\n    name: index\nand from - $ref: '#/parameters/index' to - $ref: '#/parameters/index1' it displayed it properly, but once I revert the change, it shows a blank parameter only with the default value of 'No' for the Required column.\n. Path parameters are always mandatory.\n. Actually, the spec does specify that - https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#parameterRequired. \nAnd I agree, the editor shouldn't deviate from the spec, so looks like we're good here ;)\n. There were many changes in Swagger 2.0, and we debated whether to make said suggestion and more (support, for general URI Templating - RFC 6570 but we decided to postpone it for now for various reasons.\nYou're more than welcome to open an issue on swagger-spec suggesting it for the next version of the spec, but a PR to change it now is unfortunately unreasonable.\n. I hope you realize brackets are not legal URL characters...\n. Of course it is, I confused it with something else, my bad. There are other common examples for it.\n. The editor is 2.0 only. \n. I'd like to be part of that discussion as well.\n. For example, as a responses value (notice the extra comma after the description):\njs\n        {\n          \"200\": {\n            \"description\": \"The user was successfully unfollowed\",\n          },\n          \"400\": {\n            \"description\": \"User to be unfollowed not found.\"\n          },\n          \"204\": {\n            \"description\": \"You were not following the user you were trying to unfollow.\"\n          }\n        }\n. @mohsen1 - the original definition looks fine (unless I'm missing something). Query parameters allow arrays of (arrays of) primitives.\n. :+1: \n. That's a known issue (for me) and it's not related to the editor, it's related to swagger-spec. There's no open issue there about it there, but it's on my to-do list of fixes.\n. For tidiness, you should probably open an issue on swagger-spec and track it from there. I doubt I'll remember updating here when it is fixed. Of course, you can reference from there to this issue.\n. The spec itself documents the primitive data types as taken from the JSON Schema definition. This in return directs to http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-core.html#anchor8 which clearly states the definition of 'number'.\nThere are several examples included in the editor, some of which contain examples for path parameters (such as the petstore-full).\nIn the same sample you can see the Definitions Object is functional and holds samples for complex objects, including ones that rely on definitions of other objects.\nAs far as I can see, the error gives you a reference to the line number in the editor, and in fact it is a hyperlink to the relevant line:\n\nYou may have mixed your comments as some can be taken to both the spec and the editor. If the points are regarding the spec itself, it would be better to open an issue on the spec's repository. I'm in the process of adding the examples there.\nYes, the software is still under development, especially the support for Swagger 2.0. Nobody is trying to \"annoy\" anyone. We prefer to make the progress transparent and available to the general public. The tickets people open help us immensely in the development process and sometimes helps us focus our efforts in areas that are more important.\n. Are you on the latest master version?\n. The editor. Swagger is a specification, not a piece of software.\n. Swagger has its own way to support inheritance, and it's not the one mentioned in the given snippet.\nI'm currently working on modifying the spec with clearer examples of what it should look like.\n. Unfortunately, not at the moment, no. Hopefully in a few days.\n. @mohsen1 - according to the spec, that is indeed a possibility, and they way @mazzock described his security, it requires both security requirements.\n. @prabhatjha - I don't have a discussion thread on the matter, it's just one of the changes we put into the spec after many requests for it over the years.\n@mazzock's design is not really far-fetched, and is actually relatively common. It's not really multiple authentications, but rather a single authentication with several layers. Nothing wrong there, and it's not really our place to say whether it is a proper or improper design, we're just here to help document it.\n. Thank you, but we have a chat room for the project on IRC.\n. Sure, feel free to to change it. The original just gave out completely wrong information regarding the YAML place in the Swagger world.\n. This is actually going to work the other way around. Instead of supplying two separate project, the intent is to integrate swagger-ui inside the editor and not spawn off an additional project to maintain.\nHow this is going to be done is yet to be determined.\n. There are various reasons why we'd want to go on the road of using swagger-ui rather than the current inline viewer. However, we'd be more than happy to get assistance in that direction, including improving what you feel is missing from the ui at the moment.\n. Yup, I completely understand the confusion and apologize for it. FWIW, there are features supported by the UI that are not supported in the editor.\n. Thanks for the offer to help. Basically, anything under https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3Av2.1-M2 could be handled, and we can provide additional details if required.\nThat said, if you feel something specific you need is missing, feel free to submit a PR nonetheless. M1 included quite a few community contributions that we didn't necessarily plan on including in that release (for example OAuth2 Access Code flow support).\n. Given the issue is closed - no.\n. That's not a valid definition. I think you're looking for something like this:\nyaml\n  BuildsByUser: \n    properties: \n      status: \n        type: \"integer\"\n        description: \"The HTTP status code\"\n      data: \n        type: \"array\"\n        description: \"An array of data\"\n        items: \n          type: \"object\"\n          properties: \n            smartID: \n              type: \"string\"\n              description: \"Unique identifier for each build\"\n            name: \n              type: \"integer\"\n              description: \"The name of the build\"\n            description: \n              type: \"string\"\n              description: \"The build description\"\n            username: \n              type: \"integer\"\n              description: \"The user which created the build\"\n            dateCreated: \n              type: \"string\"\n              description: \"The date the build was created\"\n. @FlevasGR - while entirely up to you, I'd generally recommend externalizing the object definition rather than defining it inline.\n. It shouldn't add the brackets for any collectionFormat ;)\n. You're getting the error because that's not a valid type. If you want to mark it as a primitive double, it should be:\nyaml\n  /features/bigDecimal:\n    post:\n      tags:\n        - feature-demonstration-service\n      summary: updateBigDecimal\n      description: updateBigDecimal\n      operationId: updateBigDecimal\n      consumes:\n        - application/json\n      produces:\n        - \"application/json\"\n      parameters:\n        - in: body\n          name: body\n          description: input\n          required: false\n          schema:\n            type: number\n            format: double\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          description: OK\n. That looks like two different parameters fields (and they do exist in two different flavors). Can you paste a full spec example so we can see if it's a real issue or just misinterpretation of the spec?\n. I see. The confusion here is derived from the naming which I hope to improve in the next version of the spec. The example above is correct.\nPlease refer to https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#operationParameters - this is the parameters property of the Operation Object which is indeed an array and does not carry the additional named object.\nThe Parameters Definitions Object to which you initially referenced can be used at the top level Swagger Object to define parameters that can be referred to from the Operation Object's parameters property to avoid repetition of definitions (which is why it requires a name, so you can reference it).\nDoes that clarify it?\n. Can you provide us with more details so we can try and find the problem?\n. In Swagger, we only support items being an object describing a single option. It's true JSON Schema allows it to be an array of options, we just don't support it.\n. That has nothing to do with the topic of this issue.\n. Closing as a very old ticket. Please open a new ticket if still relevant.. date and date-time are not applicable types. If you want to use them, you can use them as format type alongside with a string type.\n. You can do that, but no third party tool will currently render that.\nThe proper way to do it would be:\nyaml\ntype: string\nformat: date\nYou have more information here to see what that format(s) that would support. If you need a specific format, you'd have to use the pattern property which accepts a regex.\n. It's a CORS issue - https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/docs/cors.rst.\n. @chmercesmoreira - can you share the output of curl -I <path to api>?\n. It looks like your CORS headers are still not set correctly then. You're missing the Access-Control-Allow-Methods and Access-Control-Allow-Headers headers. \nCheck the output of curl -I http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/pet/1 for example.\n. I assume it still doesn't work. If you're not any special headers of your own other than the one you added, you'd still want to add Content-Type to the list of allowed headers.\n. @rajegit I have no idea what you're talking about.\n. As mentioned in the other issue, you cannot convert query parameters to body parameters seamlessly. Their structure is slightly different as the type of a body parameter is indicated under the schema property.\n. Please follow https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/issues/471 instead.\n. It would be neither. It's not a bug since it's not supported but the Swagger spec. It's not a feature, since... it's not supported by the spec :) It could be a feature request for the spec, but that won't be implemented soon.\nAlso, a type integer with an enum of strings would validate... nothing :)\n. There have been discussions about simplifying it, but there are a few complications around it.\nFWIW, we're probably not going to add $ref's for enums because that's just not standard in JSON Schema.\nYou /can/ ease up some of the repetitions if you need to define the same parameter over and over again, but you would still have to define the enum explicitly at least once for a given parameter (unless it is a body parameter).\n. @mohsen1 - I tend to agree with the comments above. Would be better to have the word Deprecated. \n. I believe you can just set https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/app/config/defaults.json#L38 to an empty string, assuming you run it locally. \n. Sorry, I missed part of your original message. I guess it could be on by default and have a setting to disable it.\n. @jknapka - Swagger spec doesn't support oneOf...\n. What you linked to is a proposal for the next version of the Swagger specification. It's not part of it.\n. There's no screenshot...\n. Are you using the online editor?\n. @kbiger - if that's your actual YAML, both are invalid.\nThe editor seems to work well with:\nyaml\n      responses:\n        201:\n          description: \"\"\n          schema :\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/Response\"\n          examples: {}\n. Which version of the editor do you use?\n. The online editor seems to accept it fine. Can you try pulling the latest version?\n. From http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/:\n``` yaml\nliteral_block: |\n    This entire block of text will be the value of the 'literal_block' key,\n    with line breaks being preserved.\nThe literal continues until de-dented, and the leading indentation is\nstripped.\n\n    Any lines that are 'more-indented' keep the rest of their indentation -\n    these lines will be indented by 4 spaces.\n\nfolded_style: >\n    This entire block of text will be the value of 'folded_style', but this\n    time, all newlines will be replaced with a single space.\nBlank lines, like above, are converted to a newline character.\n\n    'More-indented' lines keep their newlines, too -\n    this text will appear over two lines.\n\n``\n. Sorry, my bad. Theexamples` property for a response is an object with a map between a mime type and the example itself.\nyaml\n      responses:\n        default:\n          description: \"t\"\n          schema :\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/Response\"\n          examples: \n            application/json: |\n              {\n                \"test\": \"test\"\n              }\nworks fine.\n. Renders fine to me.\n. @avercoutere - those are equivalent though. The numbers need to be quoted to type them as strings and not numbers. Strings are just... strings.\n. Based on related issues, this applies to other types of parameters, not just path.\n. This is a long open issue, and it deserves an update. If you've been following other tickets, you may already know that we're working on a major update to swagger-editor and our main focus is there. Unfortunately, due to time constraints it's unlikely we'll resolve the issue with the current version, but I believe the issue does not exist in the new update. Before you ask, about 3-4 weeks away.. It's going to be a beta release when we push it out. It won't be available before then.. This should not be an issue with 3.X. If the issue persists, please file a new ticket.. That's a good question. I know what the spec says but please remind me in a couple of days.\n. Okay, so if the top level security is defined, it is inherited by all operations.\nIf an operation wants to override it, it can, with an empty array to completely remove it. There's no way to add to it, besides defining everything from the top level and the additional ones at the operation itself.\n. Yup.\n. FWIW (and unrelated to the issue directly), adding type: object alongside the $ref is meaningless. It should be part of the a and b definitions though.\n. Closing as an old ticket.. It's not my place to say whether it makes sense or not. People should use it however they want. If they want to go crazy, let them.\n. It's part of the spec. Can't be changed now. \n. Should be fixed in 3.X.. That's on me, unfortunately. Please follow https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/issues/260.\n. Can you share your YAML?\n. A YAML that reproduces the problem would help best.\n. Running the online codegen from the editor doesn't produce errors for me on this definition. What exactly do you run with the codegen to produce the error?\n. Okay, that's specifically a problem with the html generator. You need to open a ticket on swagger-codegen for it, and provide the sample spec as provided here.\n. Closing as an old ticket.. Yup, this is filed here - swagger-api/swagger-spec#260. I'll try to get around to resolving it this week.\n. @Srithar-ccs - what you described in the google group, and swagger-spec has nothing to do with this issue. Right now, you're not making it easier for us to help you by writing about it all over the place.\n. The problem is that you repeat the path.\nTry:\nyaml\n  /api/repos/{repositoryUrl}:\n    head:\n      description: |\n        Fetches meta information about the specified repositoryUrl.\n          This operation can be used to normalize repositoryUrl's, ie:  \n          - a request with `git@github.com:zalando/kontrolletti.git` as repositoryUrl will end up redirecting to  \n          `/api/repos/{NormalizedRepositoryUrl}`.\n          - a request with `https://stash.zalando.net/projects/CD/repos/ansible-playbooks/browse` as repositoryUrl will end up redirecting `/api/repos/{NormalizedRepositoryUrl}`.\n      produces:\n        - application/json\n      parameters:\n        - name: repositoryUrl\n          in: path\n          description: URL of the repository\n          required: true\n          type: string\n          format: uri\n      responses:\n        301:\n          description: The `repositoryUrl` is not normalized, follow the redirect for to its normalized URI.\n        404:\n          description: The `repositoryUrl` is normalized, but its resource cannot be found.\n        500:\n          description: Internal Server error.\n    get:\n      description: |\n        Fetches the `Repository` object for the specified URI.\n      produces:\n      - application/problem+json\n      - application/x.zalando.repository+json\n      parameters:\n      - name: repositoryUrl\n        in: path\n        description: URL of the repository\n        required: true\n        type: string\n        format: uri\n      responses:\n          200:\n            description: Retrieved the object successfully.\n            schema: \n              type: object\n              properties:\n                commits:\n                  type: array\n                  items:\n                    $ref: \"#/definitions/Repository\"\n                _links:\n                    type: array\n                    items:\n                      $ref: \"#/definitions/Link\"\n          400:\n            description: Request could not be understood, due to malformed syntax.\n            schema:\n              $ref: \"#/definitions/Error\"\n          404:\n            description: No objects could be found matching the specified parameters.\n          500:\n            description: Internal Server error.\n            schema:\n              $ref: \"#/definitions/Error\"\n. Just clone https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor.git.\n. Just cloned the repository successfully. This is probably an issue with your git installation. You may be able to contact github's support for further support.\n. @mohsen1 - readOnly sets a model property as only applicable when being sent from the server, but not to the server, so it shouldn't appear in a model form for operation parameters. For reference - https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#schemaReadOnly.\n. LGTM\n. Closing as an old issue. Please file a new one if still relevant.. @ericsodt - questions regarding the generated code belong to swagger-codegen. I hope @mohsen1 won't mind though, and I'll say that I tried following the same process, ran it with mvn jetty:run and loaded up fine. The URL points to the root though at http://localhost:8002 which unsurprisingly returns 200 with an empty response.\n. That's a fair question, but the answer is no. Eventually, it's just YAML/JSON files. The 'root' file, representing the Swagger object, has a specific structure (as you know), but the fragments can pretty much be anything.\nThat means that the validation could be done only from the root file, as that's the only time you can assign a meaning to the referenced objects. And yes, that makes auto-complete and so on more complicated. I can possibly think of a few ways to ease up the implementation (in terms of user experience), but perhaps we should discuss that separately? May be easier.\n. The comments way is probably the only way to go due to obvious limitations.\nA few questions/comments:\n- Can you please clarify the example of the array? I'm not sure I understand what you mean by it.\n- Are you going to perform partial validation on those segments?\n- This kind of implementation forces a structure of the segments. I don't mind it, though some people may expect something slightly different. We can try breaking it down further and see if/how we'd want to support more cases. I'm okay with basic support at first.\n. Oh, so by this example:\n``` yaml\npartial-swagger: [\"info\", \"contact\"]\nemail: me@example.com\nurl: example.com\nname: My Name\n```\nYou meant Contact object under Info? (I'm ignoring that this is not really a 'reuse' use case)\n\nI believe partial validation is going to be requested as soon as there's ability to split files. If there's not going to be partial validation, I'm not sure there's a reason for the first-line comment (other than saying it shouldn't be validated at all, but you don't need to define the 'path' in it).\n\nTo clarify, it's technically possible to have something like (and forgive my json):\njson\n{\n  \"mypersonaldefs\": {\n    \"modelX\": {\n      \"type\": \"object\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nand $ref'ing it from the root Swagger as /path/to/file#/mypersonaldefs/modelX. However, it's not really 'definitions' and it's not really a single definition in that file. We may say initially that we don't support this use case, but it's technically feasible.\n\nAnd on that note, how will the multi-files be referenced each other? What would be the path?\n. Okay, I have a couple of thoughts on resolving relative fragments as well, but that can be phase 2. What about the other points? :)\n. For now, this will not be supported by the editor.. @jenswachtel do you experience that with the 3.x editor?. Closing as should be fixed. File a new ticket if not.. @zoharsanchez tested it with the current editor, and it sends the query parameter just fine.... Which version of the editor do you use?. Should no longer be an issue in 3.X.. Add type: object to your inline schema:\nyaml\nswagger: \"2.0\"\ninfo:\n  version: \"1.0.0\"\n  title: Debug\nschemes:\n  - http\npaths:\n  /comments:\n    post:\n      summary: Post a new comment\n      parameters:\n        - name: comment\n          in: body\n          schema:\n            type: object\n            properties:  # <- offending node\n              content:\n                type: string\n          required: true\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: success\n. Unfortunately, JSON Schema does not assume it and the meaning of it is pretty much 'any'. If you try to validate a string against a a definition with only properties and no type, it will pass validation.\n. This is due to a bug with the JSON Schema. I've opened https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/issues/414 for it.\n. You need to use type: number and format: double for it.\n. There's no readOnly property for parameters. \n. @sram54 which version of swagger-editor do you use?. wat\n. I don't see it, but I trust you. I thought you meant that's what's displayed to the user.\n. @astrodsg - to add to @chrisdudley's comment, what you're adding there is not multiple body parameters but a single body parameter with a model definition. The way required properties are described in models is different than how they are required parameters are defined, and works as @chrisdudley mentioned.\n. Should be fine now, thanks for reporting.\n. This should no longer be an issue in 3.X.. Yeah. \nyaml\n  parameters: []\nis fine. However, having an empty object in it is not a valid parameter structure, which should fail. Your snippet will not pass schema validation.\n. No type.\nyaml\n  OrderDetail:\n    description: order json provided by vendor\n    required:\n      - orderJson\n    properties:\n      orderJson: {}\nThough if you know it's a JSON Object:\nyaml\n  OrderDetail:\n    description: order json provided by vendor\n    required:\n      - orderJson\n    properties:\n      orderJson:\n        type: object\n. Thanks, but this has nothing to do with swagger-editor. It's a feature request to swagger-spec which exists here - https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/issues/274. Feel free to add your comments there.\n. Closing as an old issue. Please file a new one if still relevant.. @mohsen1 - as the spec defines it, file is only supported with formData, not body. This is a bug.\n. Of type file? Yes.\n. Swagger doesn't support multiple types for items (or type for that matter).\n. @Darshan-shivashankar - The use case presented in SO and the use case presented here are different. What you wanted to do in SO is doable, what you want to do here isn't. There's no workaround for it, it's simply not supported.\n. I'm afraid we can't do much without seeing the definition itself.\n. Great, thanks.\n. Fixed the format for you.\n. While it shouldn't fail because of it, you should always add type: object when describing an object. Add it to both the #/definitions/messwert and the inline definition at 200 response schema, and it would work as expected.\n. For example:\nyaml\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          description: successful operation\n          schema:\n            type: object\n            properties:\n              id:\n                type: integer\n                format: int64\n              message:\n                type: string\n. Happy to hear.\n. Can do much without the YAML.\n. Yup, just email it to me.\n. There are actually a few issues with the YAML which you need to resolve prior to seeing the rest.\nFirst, swagger has to have the value \"2.0\".\nSecond, one of your paths isn't properly indented. You need to un-indent it one step back and then you'll see the other errors.\n. No worries. Just remember that YAML is sensitive to indentation.\n. That's not really a valid reference, and it also looks like the error is related to something else in your definition which you haven't shared.\n. @mohsen1 - as far as I can tell, format is defined as type: string throughout the schema with no additional restrictions, so it doesn't seem to be a schema bug in this case.\n. @whitlockjc -\n\nHowever, the format property is an open string-valued property, and can have any value to support documentation needs. Formats such as \"email\", \"uuid\", etc., can be used even though they are not defined by this specification. Types that are not accompanied by a format property follow their definition from the JSON Schema (except for file type which is defined above).\n\nSo, for example, whether true or not, JeremyIsAwesome is a valid format.\n@mohsen1 - the type has no affect on the validity of a format. How or whether the value is validated though is a different matter.\n. I'm afraid that's inaccurate as well. From http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-validation.html#anchor106 - \n\nImplementations MAY support the \"format\" keyword. Should they choose to do so:\nthey SHOULD implement validation for attributes defined below;\nthey SHOULD offer an option to disable validation for this keyword.\nImplementations MAY add custom format attributes. Save for agreement between parties, schema authors SHALL NOT expect a peer implementation to support this keyword and/or custom format attributes.\n\nThat suggests that if the formats are unknown, they can (and should) be ignored.\n. It's an implementation and they may have chosen to not turn off validation of unknown formats. The JSON Schema specification explicitly says they are allowed, and in fact, JSON Schema's JSON Schema is non-restrictive - https://github.com/json-schema/json-schema/blob/master/draft-04/schema#L140.\nAnd just because they all fail, doesn't mean they don't all have a bug in them. I didn't write that specification :)\n. Thanks, @whitlockjc, much appreciated.\n. Whenever you describe a model, make sure to add type: object.\nFor example:\nyaml\n  Value:\n    type: object\n    properties:\n      amount:\n        type: number\n        format: float\n      currency: \n        type: string\n      country:\n        type: string\n      region:\n        type: string\n. Two more points (not that any should give you the error, but changing it would solve your problem):\n- You can't have anything alongside a $ref, so remove the type: object in those occurrences.\n- You don't need format: string with type: string. Remove the format and the generation would work.\n. Closing as an old ticket.. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#1179\n. @mohsen1 - newValue is a generic object, and should allow adding arbitrary keys and values to it. \n. That's actually a bug in the codegen. \nhttp://generator.swagger.io/#!/clients/clientOptions\nhttp://generator.swagger.io/#!/servers/serverOptions\n. It's not fixed. That's Scalatra, not Sinatra :)\n. That's on @fehguy or me.\n. @mohsen1 - that reminds me I may want to open a related issue ;)\n. Fine ;)\n. Yeah, that works as a basic functionality, thanks.\n. Hopefully, this is no longer an issue with 3.X.. It shouldn't have been, but I'd suggest you try the new editor, for now hosted at https://editor3.swagger.io.. It's fairly new, so not a lot of resources. It's GA.. We're not planning on supporting that for Swagger/OpenAPI 2.0. It might change in OAS3.0.. It's got nothing to do with the enum, it's the path parameter itself. It has to be required.\n. That's really not enough info.\n. Confirmed. For now, as a workaround, you can use a different browser for now.\n. @ChriWiChris - can you elaborate on the disadvantages? \n. Thanks for the detailed explanation, that helps us in evaluating future changes. \n. @eschizoid - swagger-editor supports Swagger 2.0 only. The output you shared is Swagger 1.2 and it looks like you're using a really old version of swagger-springmvc. Please consider upgrading to the latest version of the product, now called springfox.\n. Not sure what you mean by 'hyper' there, but the JSON Schema does not validate the example, and unfortunately cannot validate it. This is something for extended validation.\n. This is something that can't be validated using a JSON schema, and I'm afraid opening a ticket on swagger-spec won't change that. This is a limitation of JSON Schema.\nAnd @mohsen1 - I'm confused by your definition. This is is not JSON Schema that validates a JSON Schema. This is a JSON Schema that validates a JSON. Just because use use some JSON SChema definitions in that JSON doesn't make it a JSON Schema on its own, but that could be what you meant.\n. Fair enough, and yes, it does use a modified version of JSON Schema's Schema to validate those.\n. That's an issue you'd have to open over on springfox as the Swagger definition it produces is incomplete. Swagger Editor can't (and shouldn't) handle non-existing references.\n. This is not relevant in 3.X as we don't have the import via query parameter implemented.. Yes.. This should no longer be an issue in 3.X.. Are you talking about swagger-ui?\n. From @KevinMitchell on October 22, 2015 7:37\nNo, I'm talking about the live rendering view to the right of the editor.  It shows a rendered view of most things you add in the editor, but ignores any examples.\n. @stevendearborn - oneOf is not supported by Swagger.\nHowever, for specifying OAuth2, you shouldn't need it as there's an internal way of specifying security access using OAuth2. Check out https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#security-scheme-object for further details.\n. If you paste that snippet into the editor you get an error. The JSON schema used for validation does not allow the usage of oneOf (because, as mentioned, it is not supported by the spec). Furthermore, as far as I know, that's not the right construct usage for oneOf and what you're actually doing there is defining a property called oneOf which I assume is not your intent. I can suggest a more accurate usage of oneOf for your case, but that will still not work with Swagger nor the editor.\nHowever, not all is lost. Since you have a type property that differentiates between the object options, you can use that as a discriminator and use inheritance to represent the different types. Please take a look at https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#composition-and-inheritance-polymorphism and the following samples for reference.\n. the -ve values?. This should no longer be an issue in 3.X.. @kemalmemis please file a new ticket with a (full) spec that reproduces the problem.. @whitlockjc, can you have a look please?\n. The editor uses the generic templates we have at the swagger-codegen project. You can easily create your own templates based on the documentation in that project, and if you require any help with that, you can open a ticket directly on swagger-codegen.\n. Thanks for the input everyone.\nThe exposed options is actually a relatively new feature and we are looking into how to integrate it with the editor. We appreciate your feedback and suggestions, which we'd take into account, but for now we're going to keep the current API of the online generator as-is.\n. Sorry for the delay on this, thank you for your patience. Please feel free to go ahead with it if you wish.\nOne thing though - the thread is a bit long and I'm not sure what changes/proposals are relevant (both for the editor and the codgen) - can you point me to the relevant parts?\n. @cbornet - you mean the ability to pick the underlying implementation under a specific template (java in the linked example)? Sounds good to me. \n. Sounds good.\n. This is a duplicate of #472 (though this is more generic).\n. @HEDIDIN did you mean to close the issue? is it resolved for you?\n. Your Request body parameter has the property type which is invalid for body parameters. Try removing it and see if it helps.\n. The problem is that without the exact YAML that you're using I can't tell what's in those line numbers. I'd either need the full expanded errors or the current version of your YAML file.\n. In this case you have to issues, both at POST / (the root):\n- The Content-Type parameter is missing a type. As a side note, you should not specify the Content-Type header directly. This is why operations have the consumes property.\n- Your id body parameter is missing the schema property.\n. With pleasure. Any other issues with your current spec?\n. The spec may seem long, but it's actually fairly straight forward. If you have any questions about the structure or the spec, I'd suggest posting those in the google group.\nWould it be ok if we close this issue for now?\n. You certainly can. Keep in mind the external schema has to be a Swagger Schema Object, which is slightly different than pure JSON Schema. For more information, refer to the Schema Object.\n. You'd have to create different models. You can still take the common properties and use allOf to include them in an extending object to reduce repetition, but still you'd need separate models.\n. @sms81 - I can be blamed for a lot of things, but not for JSON Schema's limitations.. @ironsmile - I miss Sofia! Haven't been there in ages.\nThe way allOf works is that it defines an array of schemas against \"all of \"which an input would be validated with. However, this does not mean that the schemas are merged, but rather that each one of them is checked individually. That means that the required schema stands alone... and it doesn't like that because those properties are not defined.\nOf course, @darrelmiller just posted a similar answer while I was typing this one, but I'm still going to post it.. It's because I miss Sofia so much.. @ironsmile that could be a bug with swagger-tool :). Please follow the discussion at #713.\n. Duplicate of #717.\n. Closing the issue as moved to the codegen.\n. Which version of the editor do you use to produce that error?\n. Looks like a duplicate of #668.\n. You're getting that error where?\n. From @0x62ash on November 30, 2015 23:56\nHere - http://editor.swagger.io/#/\n. In that case...\n. What's the warning you're getting?\n. @whitlockjc?\n. You have to put those under the same entry:\nyaml\n  /profile:\n    get:\n      summary: Profile\n      description: Returns the current user's profile.\n      parameters:\n        - name: provider\n          in: query\n          description: Storage provider\n          required: false\n          type: string\n      tags:\n        - Profile\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: Profile\n          schema:\n            type: object\n            $ref: '#/definitions/Profile'\n        '400':\n          description: Unexpected error\n          schema:\n            $ref: '#/definitions/Error'\n    put:\n      summary: Profile\n      description: Updates the current user's profile.\n      tags:\n        - Profile\n      parameters:\n        - name: provider\n          in: query\n          description: Storage provider\n          required: false\n          type: string\n        - name: name\n          in: query\n          description: name\n          required: false\n          type: string\n        - name: bio\n          in: query\n          description: bio\n          required: false\n          type: string\n        - name: photo\n          in: formData\n          description: photo upload\n          required: false\n          type: file\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: Profile\n          schema:\n            type: object\n            $ref: '#/definitions/Profile'\n        '400':\n          description: Unexpected error\n          schema:\n            $ref: '#/definitions/Error'\n. That's right, the schema doesn't enforce it because the spec doesn't enforce it. There may be tools out there that will help with it, but it's outside the scope of the spec.\n. This should no longer be an issue in 3.X.. I'm afraid we don't have the capacity to solve issues in older versions of the editor. Try the latest version, and if you have other issues, please open new tickets.. You are correct that the error is due to it not being supported. While it doesn't make sense for us to not enforce the validations, we do have plans to make the experience easier on the users.\n. Because the spec itself supports only a subset of JSON Schema. It's got nothing to do with swagger-editor.. CORS.\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/f571a6a46145587dfd3e311312cda969844e182c/docs/cors.md\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui#cors-support\n. To clarify, the type field is not mandatory. However, the lack of type means that the type is a wildcard. Specifying properties does not set the type to be an object implicitly. It means that if the value that's passed is an object, it will be validated against the properties, however, the value will also be valid if it's a string, number, boolean, array... you get the idea. As a best practice, you should always specify the type.\nWhen it comes to rendering type-less definitions, that ends up being challenging for that exact reason.\n. This should no longer be an issue in 3.X.. @Lakshmi2505 - YAML is white-space sensitive, and your indentation is messed up. I'd suggest going over all the your spec and bringing back each line and intending it using tabs in the editor (don't mix tabs and spaces). I've started doing it, but each time I fix one thing, another pops up so I'll leave it to you.\nAlso, you have quite a few invalid things in your spec. Your operation paths should not include the query parameters in them, and many of the types you use are wrong - please take note to these.\n. This should no longer be an issue in 3.X.. @davisford - which version have you tested it with? Checking with the online version it seems to validate well.\n. This should no longer be an issue in 3.X.. Well, if that it builds, then even for multi it's a bug as it shouldn't add the square brackets. \n. I'd ask you open a separate issue on swagger-ui as the projects are handled independently. \n. Ah, then forget it. ;)\n. Yup. Try:\nyaml\n    parameters:\n        - name: body\n          in: body\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: object\n            properties:\n              userId:\n                type: string\n                example: 5695b0b389f3409e2986eee9\n              event:\n                $ref: '#/definitions/AnalyticEvent'\n              userDevice:\n                $ref: '#/definitions/UserDevice'\n. Can you provide an actual sample that exhibits the problem and would help us to test?\n. This is a non-issue because the spec does not support query parameters in the paths, so that cannot be supported.\n. Perhaps I didn't explain properly, apologies. Anything that comes after the ? is query parameters by definition. Even if you define them as part of the path with fixed values, those are still query parameters. That's just how query parameters are defined. The spec simply does not support that. They cannot be considered part of the path, and cannot be treated as path parameters. This has nothing to do with the editor, this has to do with the spec. And the editor should not support things that are not supported by the spec itself, so yes, it would deliberately reject those.\n. Future spec versions may or may not support it, I have no way of knowing.\nWhether 'most' swagger tools support it or not, is not really relevant. It's not even relevant how easy it is to support it, as we simply will not provide support for it if it's not supported by the spec. I'm afraid that with the current spec, this is a definite won't fix.\n. Validating that is slightly more difficult, though not impossible. We explicitly don't validate is as part of the JSON Schema, but that's not the source of truth. Perhaps it would make sense to add the validation one way or another to avoid such issues in the future. Thanks for the feedback.\n. Well, that's an interesting bug.\n. I'm afraid as @mohsen1 explained that it's unlikely we'll merge the PR. But also, as @mohsen1 mentioned, this could be a good reference to anyone looking to doing that on their own.\n. This should no longer be an issue in 3.X.. Not sure why it doesn't render properly, but I have a feeling you're not modeling what you expect... Does your RewardPager really have a property called allOf? Not impossible, just checking.\n. Can you share what errors you're getting? We can't do much with that info.\n. @saharj - I was able to reproduce the problem with the online version.\n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#2029\n. Your use case isn't clear enough. Can you please specify the steps you take to reproduce the problem?\n. @mushahidh - Would love to help, but this is not the place. Please submit a question to the google group and we'll try to assist there.\n. @jgonzalezd not sure it continued on the google group. if you have a question, just post it there.\n. Yes. security is an array of Security Requirement Objects. Each Security Requirement Object can contain multiple security definitions, and between them there's a logical AND.\n. Try:\n``` yaml\npaths:\n  '/endpoint/':\n    security:\n     - securityDefinitionA: []\n       securityDefinitionB: []\n     - securityDefinitionC: []\nsecurityDefinitions:\n  securityDefinitionA:\n    type: apiKey\n    name: X-HeaderA\n    in: header\n  securityDefinitionB:\n    type: apiKey\n    name: X-HeaderB\n    in: header\n  securityDefinitionC:\n    type: apiKey\n    name: X-HeaderC\n    in: header\n``\n. You need to describe the wrapper explicitly. There's no way to define a wrapper with the current spec.\n. Yes, you can't do that. You have to define it all in one object, or useallOfto include the properties from both.\n. At most it can be a warning. JSON Schema is not strict about it (could be a string value for a boolean).\n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#2221\n. There are no immediate plans to migrate the code to Angular 2. The donation of the spec to the OAI doesn't affect the state of the project.\n. We migrated to React instead ;). Closing as an old issue. Please file a new one if still relevant.. This should no longer be an issue in 3.X.. Put them both under the same path and it will work. JSON doesn't allow duplicate keys.\n. What error are you getting? Seems to load fine for me.\n. @JacquesPerrault - same as the original issue. You havex-swagger-router-controllertwice under the same level, which is not allowed.\n. Sounds like, yeah.\n. Thanks for the update, glad it worked out.\n. I'm afraid the spec doesn't allow parameters to be defined at the basePath. If you require it to be a parameter, you'd have to exclude it from the basePath and include it in the path itself.\n. If I understand correctly, you're saying you're using curly braces in your URL. If that's the case, then bad news - curly braces are *unsafe* according to the [URL RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1738) and should not be used. They are not supported.. Okay, I don't understand how they are not related to swagger. The URL to execute the call is part of your API, and you're using Swagger to describe your API. So either they are fixed, or they are part of your API.. Current editor doesn't have this feature. We'll circle back if/when it's reintroduced to 3.X.. The Swagger/OpenAPI spec currently doesn't allow specifying such operations. The combination of verb+path uniquely identify an operation, query parameters do not affect it.\n. It's undecided yet.\n. This should no longer be an issue in 3.X.. @mtsmfm - that's an invalid spec. Thetype` has to be a single value. I realize the spec is not super clear about it, but it's not supported.\n. @ralfhandl there's no consensus, but that's a discussion for the spec repository. \nClosing this as not supported.\n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#2607\n. Closing as this feature no longer exists in the editor.. This should no longer be an issue in 3.X.. You're missing either application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data set as the consumes value for the operation.\n. Since the release of the new editor, give it another try. If the issue persists, please file a new ticket (preferably with spec samples for testing).. The new version of the editor has a clear editor menu item under File.. The experience is clear, but right now there's no functionality we can add to avoid it. We're working on improving the performance and that should much such issues be avoided in the future.. @Johngtrs - what you're trying to do is not fully supported by the spec right now. You can combine multiple formData parameters to upload files and other data, but in that case you cannot specify a model as a data type for the parameter (this is a limitation of the spec). The only real way you can do it right now is describe it as a string and not structure the content, which is a miss.\nBody parameters are intended to be the case of a single payload to the request, which is not the case you have at hand.\n. So it's not supported in 2.0. 3.0 added support for the use case, but it's not finalized. When we add support to it, you'll be able to do that.. Read the spec here - https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#parameterObject - specifically the description of Form parameters. \n\nSince form parameters are sent in the payload, they cannot be declared together with a body parameter for the same operation.. It's got nothing to do with the UI. If you read the spec, you'll see that non-body parameters can only be primitives or array of primitives. You can't represent a JSON with formData parameters. This changes in 3.0.. We can add a warning - however it is not incorrect. If a code generator breaks because of it, better file a ticket on the code generator.. On second thought, this should be fixed in the codegen and tooling itself. Providing such a warning will not help the user since it's not wrong.. @saharj when you get a chance...\n. This is no longer relevant in the new editor.. @AviiNL - not quite up to use. We're using JSON references as defined by the JSON Reference spec which just doesn't allow what you describe.\n. @peacemakr there's no 'best' way. You'd need to tailor and construct your models properly using composition.. That's a parameter, not a property. The only thing you can do is define two parameters, one required and one not, and refer to each where appropriate. There's no other alternative. . 'properties' is a common term for model definitions, that's where the confusion was from.\n\nUnfortunately, there's no way around it.. @AlwaysAbhl001 yes, use the allOf construct.. json\n\"Orders\": {\n  \"allOf\": [\n    {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/definitions/Pager\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"ProductName\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        },\n        \"Quantity\": {\n          \"type\": \"integer\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#2766\n. @rcesecurity thanks for reporting this.\n@saharj can you have a look at it?\n. This is no longer an issue with the new editor.. There seems to be a confusion here. The body of the request is described as an object, and the response is described as an array. You're describing that you're taking the response you get from the operation and try to use it for the body - obviously, that's not going to work.\n. @stcrestrada - does this explain the problem?\n. Closing this due to lack of activity. @stcrestrada please reopen if still relevant.\n. While this is true, now the source of it is in swagger-ui, and there's a ticket for that there. Closing.. https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/search?q=discriminator&state=open&type=Issues&utf8=%E2%9C%93. @camminati it's not out of scope as much as it is a lower priority. We have limited resources, but as always, we'd love to get community contributions to support it.. This is no longer relevant in the new editor.. @trifwnas - this is indeed a CORS issue. It works well from Postman because it doesn't have the same browser limitations. It works from the basic web form because that's how HTML works. It will not work for web apps though, unless either CORS is enabled on the server itself or if you're using a CORS proxy to add the relevant headers. This is a browser limitation and not something we can control.\n. The problem seems to be with your personal installation on Azure. I've uploaded the same file to both your instance and the original (using the direct website for both) - it didn't work in yours and worked in the original.\n\n. @saharj - now it looks like the request is not being built properly. Can you look into that? The payload ends up being just f: barcode.png where it should be:\n```\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------13326974253911837651178094888\nContent-Length:

from the sample barcode)\n. It looks like there's a bug in the way that multipart/form-data parameters are generated in the editor.\n. The issue should have been fixed in the older version of the editor and should have no issues with the new eone.. That's because it's not supported in the spec - see https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/issues/254. Unfortunately, this can't be done right now.\n. This is no longer relevant in the new editor.. This should no longer be an issue in the new editor.. This is an issue in swagger-ui now, not swagger-editor. I believe we have an open ticket for that, can't find it right now.. Apologies for the delayed feedback.\nUnfortunately, our code base might have deviated from the time this PR was submitted, and we cannot easily merge it (certainly not against master), and so, we're going to close this PR.\nIf you find the change important and would like to resubmit it, please let us know. Be aware that we are focused on the 3.X version at the moment (now master), and new changes should be applied to it.\nWe appreciate the time you've taken into submitting this PR. We're now making extra effort to review PRs within a few days at most, to avoid situations like this.. Huh, I meant to post it on the relevant PR. However, this should no longer be an issue in 3.X.. We don't have the capacity to build and maintain this feature. If anyone wants to give a try, feel free to submit a PR and we'll review.. You didn't attach the spec...\n. @grcreddy the attached file is a malformed yaml, and it doesn't look anything like you shared in the screenshot (you have a reference to Pet which isn't even defined there). Can't help with an actual proper file.\n. @ChriWiChris - following your previous feedback, that's one of the differences between the goals of the tools - swagger-editor is not meant for this kind of functionality.\n. There isn't in 2.0 - we explicitly removed the ordering in that version (can be argued, but hey... ;)).\nJust remember that currently the operations are in a map, and by definition order is not guaranteed in maps (in JSON). That said, most tools just keep the order, so it's normally not a real concern.\n. @CsatariGergely There's no preferences screen in 3.X.. There's no way of doing that at the moment.. File a new ticket, you never know what might happen ;). Circular references should no longer be an issue in master.. @gordey4doronin - It will not be possible to pull it into 2.x. \n@cen1 - there's definitely an issue with what you shared, and we're looking into it.. This should no longer be an issue with 3.X. However, if the issue persists, please file a new ticket.. @rapw3k what response do you get from the server? 500 or something else?\n. You're showing the network tab of our browser's console - the response code will be there, it's just not in the screenshot.\n. If you're getting 500 for OPTIONS, then it's likely you don't have CORS enabled on your server. You need to fix that before being able to proceed with executing calls - https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/docs/cors.md\n. Using the version at http://editor.swagger.io, disabling CORS in Chrome, providing the Authorization header in the example - it works as expected and doesn't pop up any other window.\n. I used the value of Bearer 4e5b6138-5885-4c8f-a794-cf368c67a4e4 from the curl command you shared.\n\nI used the command you shared to run Chrome with CORS disabled.\n. That's a separate issue. If there's no more issues with swagger-eeditor, please close this one and open one on swagger-ui, mentioning which version you use and so on.\n. Apologies for the delayed feedback.\nUnfortunately, our code base might have deviated from the time this PR was submitted, and we cannot easily merge it (certainly not against master), and so, we're going to close this PR.\nIf you find the change important and would like to resubmit it, please let us know. Be aware that we are focused on the 3.X version at the moment (now master), and new changes should be applied to it.\nWe appreciate the time you've taken into submitting this PR. We're now making extra effort to review PRs within a few days at most, to avoid situations like this.. Duplicate of #1005.\n. There's no support for nested tags. I don't even know what you mean by nested request parameters. You can emulate nested tags by using something like tag1/tag2 but you'd have to modify any tool you'd want to reflect this yourself.\n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#3427\n. This is not an issue - it's a JSON limitation - JSON doesn't support comments.\n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#3436\n. There's no solution for it yet, and we haven't covered that in the talks about the next version of the spec. Vendor extensions are pretty much your extensions that you write, they will not add functionality magically, but they can be used by various tools to extend the functionality. If you want a tool to understand your extension, it's up to you to modify it to support it.\n. Sure, the tooling may not quite support it, but you can always say the method consumes application/zip and has a single empty schema as the body (since there's no real way to represent it).\n. I don't really understand the question. \n. Okay, let's separate things. Do what you want to do, you'd need to set it as a body parameter. The tools, specifically, the editor and the ui, do not support this form of file upload, and I doubt they will soon.\n. Closing as we don't actively maintain 2.x. If anyone wants to submit a PR against the 2.x docs, we'll look into merging it.. This should not be an issue with 3.X. . We no longer offer this functionality.. This should no longer be an issue in the new editor.. Going to Preferences -> Reset Editor Settings will set it back, but of course reset any other settings you've changed.\n. This is not relevant with the new editor.. I assume this issue is no longer relevant. Please reopen if it is.. This should no longer be an issue with the new editor.. What's the host you're trying to add?\n. Try it without the trailing /.\n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#3505\n. You mean something like the existing ctrl/cmd+z?\n. There's undo support in the new editor.. This should no longer be an issue with the new editor.. You mean it shows the reference name instead of the property name?\n. Yup, just making sure I understood correctly. It's indeed a bug.\n. This should no longer be an issue with the new editor.. @akauppi you can't define a model under definitions with type file. You can only define that inline in the response itself (that's specified in the spec).\n. This should no longer be an issue with the new editor.. @saharj - the issue exists, at least in the version at editor.swagger.io.\nFollowing @centromere's directions, I've modified the spec to contain:\nyaml\n  /pets/findByTags:\n    post:\n      tags:\n        - pet\n      summary: Finds Pets by tags\n      description: Muliple tags can be provided with comma seperated strings. Use tag1, tag2, tag3 for testing.\n      operationId: findPetsByTags\n      produces:\n        - application/json\n        - application/xml\n      consumes:\n        - application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n      parameters:\n        - in: formData\n          name: tags\n          description: Tags to filter by\n          required: false\n          type: array\n          items:\n            type: string\n          collectionFormat: multi\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          description: successful operation\n          schema:\n            type: array\n            items:\n              $ref: \"#/definitions/Pet\"\n        \"400\":\n          description: Invalid tag value\n      security:\n        - petstore_auth:\n          - write_pets\n          - read_pets\nWhen running Send Request, the payload clearly shows that two formData parameters are being sent, but with the name tags[] instead of tags.\n\n. @saharj keep in mind that the test you referenced tests query parameters and not formData, even though the behavior is similar.\nToday, the name of the parameter in the url or payload will always be the name of the parameter in the spec. The collectionFormat never affects the name. That means, that even if the collectionFormatis multi, the name of the parameter will stay as defined (that is, no square brackets are added). The only way to add the square brackets is to actually name the parameter with the square brackets (that is, tags[] instead of tags).\nThe collectionFormat affects how multiple values are sent. csv will separate them by , and so will all other formats, except for multi. multi is the only one that instead of adding a separator character, will repeat the parameter name, each time with a different value. This, again, will not change the name of the parameter as it is constructed in the request.\n. This should no longer be an issue with the new editor.. ``` yaml\nMyUnknownObject:\n  type: object\n  properties:\n    name:\n      type: string\n    identifier:\n      type: string\n    isPrimaryCategory:\n      type: boolean\nRelatedCategories:\n  type: object\n  additionalProperties:\n    $ref: '#/definitions/MyUnknownObject'\n```\n. The spec doesn't support it, so the editor doesn't as well. For reuse guidelines, please check https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/guidelines/REUSE.md.\n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#3632\n. @bodnia should be able to help as well, she's implemented it in swaggr-ui.\n. Closing as an old issue. Reopen if still relevant.. Where do you see that link that you think it's broken?\n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger.io#130\n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#3816\n. Apologies for the delayed feedback.\nUnfortunately, our code base might have deviated from the time this PR was submitted, and we cannot easily merge it (certainly not against master), and so, we're going to close this PR.\nIf you find the change important and would like to resubmit it, please let us know. Be aware that we are focused on the 3.X version at the moment (now master), and new changes should be applied to it.\nWe appreciate the time you've taken into submitting this PR. We're now making extra effort to review PRs within a few days at most, to avoid situations like this.. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#3852\n. This should no longer be an issue with the new editor.. You're getting the error not because of the inheritance but because you quoted the required value, making it a string instead of boolean. Remove the quotes around true and the error will go away.\n. Just ignore those warnings. The editor at the moment can't recognize inheritance, but that doens't affect the spec.\n. Swagger UI will not display it as inheritance, but will also not show you warning/error.\n. The editor is intended for YAML editing. If you want the JSON, you'd need to download as JSON from the menu.\n. I'm not going to go into the inaccuracy of that statement. What we should do is convert on import to YAML, but not have a constant toggle button.\n. Yeah, even though it might no longer be relevant with the new swagger-ui.. You can't use allOf directly under definitions - it's invalid by the spec.. It's a bug in swagger-ui (or rather swagger-js) - it will try to interpret allOf (and other keywords) in places they're not allowed.\nThere's no way to include a list of definitions from 2 separate files (or even one file for that matter), but I'm not really seeing the need for it either.. Yeah, what you're doing there is defining a model called allOf, not exactly what you want.\nJust reference the external models from where they are needed.. That indeed wouldn't list them. You can file a request to have an option to list all models, including referenced ones. Right now, to make it work, you'd need to 'redefine' them individually under definitions by creating a model for each and referencing the external files.. I agree, but if you want them to appear in the models, right now it's the only way.. Can't help without actually seeing the definition(s) and we're polluting this issue already.... Closing as an old ticket. Please reopen if needed.. I'm afraid you can't reference descriptions.\n. This should no longer be an issue with the new editor.. This should no longer be an issue with the new editor.. That's not a swagger spec...\n. This should no longer be an issue with the new editor.. This should no longer be an issue with the new editor.. This should no longer be an issue with the new editor.. Closing due to lack of response.. This is currently not supported with the new editor.. You have the path /{companyKey}/{app_name}/users and /{company_key}/{app_name}/users - which are equivalent. The templates path name, even if different, translates to the same thing.\n. It doesn't matter, they are still the same path. If you want to describe the different methods, put them under the same path.\n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#4165\n. @jolinder - I'm not really familiar with MS Flow, but the spec you shared seems valid. I can't really tell you why the tool is giving you an error but your best bet is to contact their support.\n. Sure thing. I'll close the ticket, but if you get more information that could help potential users, please add it as a comment.\n. Please provide a full test to test with and not just a fragment. \n. This should no longer be an issue with the new editor.. Verified the issue exists.\n. @aleksei-saharov - well, in our defense, we never said it was fixed.. Got it, thanks.. We're working on a major update and that's where our focus lies, so unlikely before then. I don't have an ETA for the update though.. This should no longer be an issue with the new editor.. @aleksei-saharov I did not. I had to go through ~300 tickets, I don't have the capacity to test every single one of them. Sometimes, tickets were wrongfully closed. However, this issue is covered by https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/2745. I believe there might be another ticket in the UI, but I can't find it right now.. This is swagger-ui and not swagger-editor, and you opened the ticket there as well.\n. The editor is meant to be used for editing YAML files and not JSON files, so producing errors on invalid JSON is out of scope.\n. This should no longer be an issue with the new editor.. This should no longer be an issue with the new editor.. This should no longer be an issue with the new editor.. Yeah. It'd really help if you can provide the actual example you use though.\n. Yeah, the JSON files. If it makes it easier, you can email me directly instead of attaching here, but a minimal reproducing example would work great as well.\n. This should no longer be an issue with the new editor.. Can't do much with that.\n. Path parameters must be required. Set it to true, and you're good to go.. Unfortunately, the error messages are produced by a third party tool that does JSON Schema validation. These error messages are indeed not overly useful, especially if you don't know Swagger's JSON Schema (which you shouldn't really have to).\nWe're working on something that will greatly improve this, but it'll take a bit before it's out.. This should no longer be an issue with the new editor.. This is no longer relevant with the new editor.. Are you running your own instance or using http://editor.swagger.io?. Try refreshing your browser and download it then. You shouldn't lose your work.. Try selecting all, and then 'ctrl+c' to copy.. This should no longer be an issue with the new editor.. The value of items itself cannot be an array. Remove the dash to render it as an object, and it should resolve correctly.. The spec itself doesn't support associative arrays like that. You can define query[0][title][like] explicitly, but you cannot define it as something dynamic that will be supplied by the user.. That's not a valid schema. Swagger does not support multiple types for arrays (or anything else for that matter).. You're correct that the spec doesn't explicitly say that, but it was a miss in the documentation and it's not supported. This will be fixed (the documentation) in the next version of the spec.\nThe validation can obviously be improved as well.. As said, please open the ticket on the codegen project.. @HarprasadShukla you need to open the ticket on the swagger-codegen project, as mentioned above.. That looks like a bug.. This is no longer an issue with the new editor.. Question is not clear.... The editor is not customizeable this way. This is done via validation which is based on either the JSON Schema or an additional specialized validation library. You can change the JSON Schema used or add an additional check in the other library, which you'd also need to fork an change.. This is not an issue. We might try to remove that menu option. The editor is intended for YAML editing only.. @OmgImAlexis we're working on a major update to the editor, and this kind of behavior would work as expected there. However, we will not make a similar modification in the current project.. New editor is out.. The good news is that you're most likely right and it is a bug in the parser.\nThe bad news is that even if it validated correctly in the editor, it still wouldn't do what you expect it to do. That's just not how allOf works I'm afraid (it is not a merge).. @gsi-delmo - because we're working on a major update, we're focused on that and can't afford the resources to fix these issues right now. They should be fixed in that update, but I cannot provide you an ETA.\nAs for the allOf usage - I think I got confused based on something else. What you described should work.. @gsi-delmo - Thanks for checking back and verifying it works better now.\nAs for the new issue you've found - would you mind closing this ticket and open a new one with the details on swagger-ui? Anything related to rendering is now swagger-ui based as the editor is just an extension of it.. You cannot use $ref's in any way under non-body parameters, not directly and not for arrays. You'd have to define it all inline. This changes in the next version of the spec.. @gjorgic - today, you'd need to declare those explicitly. So you'd need to create a parameter with the name contact[0][name]. In the next version there will be better support for it, but I'm not sure it will fully cover your use case.. We no longer use github pages.. This is no longer an issue with the new editor.. This is no longer an issue with the new editor.. Can you check your browser's network console to see what request and response you get from that action?. That's why I wanted to see the network tab, not the console... :). @aleksei-saharov - took me a bit to process this, and I'm still not 100% sure what you're expecting here, so let's discuss.\nPutting the spec aside, you're trying to describe an enum in your code, which is used in the API.\nIf I understand, you want a numeric-values enum, but would also like to provide, in the code, a description to those numbers.\nThe spec, today, does not support providing descriptions to enums. It's an existing limitation, one which does not change in the next version. The limitation is derived from the capabilities of JSON Schema.\nThe best way to describe enum values in the spec is indeed in the documentation. This, however, will not reflect back to the code.\nThe example you gave:\nyaml\nMyEnum:\n    type: integer\n    enum:\n      - value: 3\n        description: Value 1\n      - value: 10\n        description: Value 2\nis technically a valid definition (enum values can be objects) but in terms of validation, nothing would validate against it - what you are effectively saying here is that MyEnum is both an integer and an object (the objects limited by the enum) and nothing will be both.\nGiven those limitations, you need to decide what you want to achieve, and hopefully I can guide you through it.. Trust me, I'm well aware of the issue, and it's a common request. \nWhen it comes to the spec itself, we've considered extending support for it in the next version, but eventually decided against it. The main issue is that this is just not how JSON Schema works and we have little control over JSON Schema. Going outside the bounds of JSON Schema (not by adding but by changing existing features) will cause any tool that does JSON Schema to break - less tooling support in general. We're not giving up on it, just don't have a solution yet.\nAs for extending our tools - we're committed to create tools that are compliant with the spec. That means that making changes that break compliance is not on our roadmap. However, we might consider adding non-breaking extensions at some point (we do something small like that in swagger-ui) but I cannot give you a timeline for it (nor a guarantee).. Yup, confirmed as a bug.. @TokenJan with which version of swagger-editor did you try it with?. This is no longer an issue with the new editor.. This is no longer an issue with the new editor.. Hmm, what?. Closing as an old question. Please reopen if still relevant.. @edgarjs not sure what you're asking. Complex types are not supported with formData parameters. If it's not related to that, please open a new ticket.. It wasn't released. It's going to take a few more months. When the time comes, we'll support it.. Sorry, this question slipped between the cracks. The node environment is just used to build (and can be used to run) the code, but the /dist directory is a set of static files you can deploy to any http server.. This is now how you open tickets for support.. It's a valid YAML maybe, but it's not a valid Swagger specification.. This is no longer an issue with the new editor.. @chrisdudley - actually, markdown is a fancy way of writing HTML without writing HTML (yes, ok, it can be translated to other formats as well). However, in markdown, you can use HTML tags and those would be used as is, and not escaped. That's why you can create tables even with non-GFM markdown and get other HTML features.. As @OlafvdSpek mentioned - the spec doesn't support optional path parameters.\nIt also doesn't support query parameters being defined as part of the path.. That sounds like something from your side is dropping the headers, especially if you see them being sent in the request.. Not really sure what you're referring to... can you explain?. Thanks, that explains it. At what point would you expect this behavior though? There's no explicit save action in the editor (it auto-saves with every change) so when would those be removed?. Knowing the audience of the tool, adding empty lines (with or without line numbers) would be confusing to a lot of our users, so I don't see us doing that.\nRemoving the extra lines on download is something that makes more sense.. While the behavior should be more user-friendly and allow it, you should know that you actually need to specify that the type is object.\nContrary to common belief, the type is not inferred from having properties define. If you don't define it's of type object, it means that it can also be a string, integer, boolean, array and so on.. Keep in mind - it's not required. It just means something different than you'd expect. That's just how JSON Schema works, and is beyond our control in Swagger.\nWe're releasing a new version soon that will warn the user about these things though, hopefully will help in educating the users.. Thanks for the offer, @samvv.\nWe are approaching the release of a major update in the upcoming weeks - one such that would make the efforts in making this change needlessly pointless. I'd suggest waiting for the new release, re-evaluate the need for it, and if still needed, we'd consider your suggestion (and even accept a PR! :smile:).. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#4752. This is no longer an issue with the new editor.. Soon. Very soon.. This is no longer an issue with the new editor.. This is no longer an issue with the new editor.. It's a completely valid JSON, but the spec doesn't support a representation of it. There's nothing we can do about it.. This is a Safari specific issue, which we need to resolve. It works fine on other browsers.. Sure. We'll get right on it. Sorry for the inconvenience.. That small line contains quite a few errors, with regard to JSON Schema and the Swagger spec.\nThe proper way to represent what you want would be:\nyaml\nitem:\n  type: object\nI cannot guarantee the editor supports this type of input though, but it's worth a shot.. @choran to be honest, the editor wasn't really intended as a documentation tool but more for quick testing. Since sending arbitrary objects is not so common, we didn't tackle all edge cases (though we should have). It should work fine in swagger-ui.\nThat said, we're working on a major update at the moment, so I don't foresee this being fixed in the current version. I'm hoping it'll work out-of-the-box with the next update, but if not, it'll be easier for us to handle.. The approach is right, but the spec actually doesn't support additionalProperties: true. You can use additionalProperties: {} as an equivalent alternative.. Yes, when I said 'the spec actually doesn't support...' I meant the Swagger spec.. This is no longer an issue with the new editor.. This is no longer an issue with the new editor.. @RaulTsc do you experience it with the latest version of the editor?. Closing due to lack of response. Shouldn't be an issue with the new editor. Reopen if that's not the case.. Are you hosting the second file somehow?. If you open http://localhost/swagger-editor/Json/id.json in your browser you see the file?. This is no longer an issue with the new editor.. Unfortunately, you just can't add anything to $refs. The JSON Reference spec is very clear, saying that anything added to it will be ignored.\nWe're working on a major update which will affect both the UI and the editor. In the UI - you will no longer see the descriptions. In the editor, warnings will appear only in the gutter, but will not appear under Errors section in the editor.. @hlubovac - When it comes to technical subtleties, it's not illegal. You can write whatever you want alongside a $ref - they will just be ignored (so not the behavior you'd expect). The example in JSON Schema's website is just misleading. It's not an error, but processors will ignore it. The text can still be read by any person actually reading the schema itself.. @hlubovac - I've mentioned in the first comment that this is going to change in swagger-ui.. If you define it in the object you reference, it will be displayed. If at the same level of the $ref, it will be ignored.. @Cooker-Monster it's a bug. it should be a warning.. @Cooker-Monster would you mind filing a ticket on that?. @naldino74 - again, this is a limitation of the spec, not the tool. We can't make this work in the editor without making changes in the spec. There are related tickets on it on the spec's repo. If you'd like to see it changed, you should voice your opinion there.. @otto-gebb I'm actually one of those 'spec guys', but regardless, no - we can't ignore the spec in this particular case.. I'm guessing you intended your page_no and result_per_page to be query parameters (so you need to change the in value).\nIf they are path, then they have to be required, and you need to put them in the path as well.. Set your consumes to be application/form-data.. It would help if you shared the entire spec and not a snippet. Can't help you much without it.. @saharj - we solved this issue a couple of months ago. Can you take a look?. This will change soon.. I don't know :)\nWe're going to have a new version within a few weeks pushed out, but it's going to be in a beta status as it's a major (major) update.. It's going to be a public beta. . This is no longer an issue with the new editor.. Your indentation of #/definitions/Error/properties/description is off, it needs one space less.\nYour definition of #/definitions/Token/properties/role is wrong. It's either type: array (and then the items also needs to be reworked, or it's type object and then items should be changed to properties. I have no way of knowing what you really wanted to do there.. Not sure what this means.. @michaelkourlas this should already be supported in 3.x. If you find that's not the case, please file a ticket on swagger-ui.. This is no longer an issue with the new editor.. This is no longer an issue with the new editor.. @saharj - can you take a look?. @ivanfmartinez seems working for me. If it still doesn't work for you, please file a new ticket and provide more details such as your browser.. You can undo the changes in the new editor.. @saharj - can you look in to that?. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#4864. Try clearing your cache. It will remove existing work you have.. Awesome, thanks for the update.. The spec is invalid. paths is an object, not an array. Must be making the validation tool crazy.. It's going to be changed relatively soon. We can make sure this is addressed better in it.. When you run everything, if you open http://localhost:8080/definitions.yaml in your browser, does it open correctly?. This is somewhat out of scope for us. You can reference external files, but how you host them is up to you. The editor, at the end of the day, supports editing a single file only.. The editor can't access files directly from the file system, if that's what you're asking.. This is no longer an issue with the new editor.. This is no longer an issue with the new editor.. It is. You just need to define the GET and POST under the same /me.. This is not relevant with the new editor. Please follow the new build instructions.. This has nothing to do with the editor. Might be with the codegen, if so, open the ticket there.. @nemenemsrouge the editor uses its own validation mechanism. It's a combination of JSON Schema validation and manual validations.. At the moment we have no plans on extracting the validation as a standalone library.. This is no longer an issue with the new editor.. Should no longer be relevant in 3.X.. This is no longer an issue with the new editor.. Please open the ticket on the swagger-codegen project.. Yup, it's missing at the moment. Hoping to add that by the end of the week.. Appreciate the feedback, but it's not going to change.. When we get to it. It's high on our list of priorities.. Combining format and pattern can be contradicting itself. date-time has a very specific structure and it's not what you want. Drop the format, keep the pattern, and you're good to go.. @rycler date-time has a specific format, you can't change it. If you need to have a specific format, use pattern to specify it instead.. @rycler I'm guessing when you say you use swagger to build the serverside controller, you're referring to swagger-codegen. If that's the case, then the bug is in the codegen as it should interpret date-time as being able to accept noly the output sample you provided. If that's not the case, then the bug should be opened on the codegen where that restriction should be added.. Which version of the editor are you using?. A bit confused - after clearing the cache, do you still see the issue?. Yes, we're aware of the issue. We're working on improving the layout of the parameters and the information that's being displayed.. Closing in favor of https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/2773.. @moishy90 we need to update the README. The new version of the project can only be built with Node 6.. Thanks. It's on our todo list - hopefully by the end of the week.. Closing due to lack of response. Please reopen if needed.. Should be fixed in master.. Related to https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/2758.. You want to set the default YAML loaded with the editor (something different than the pet store)?. Can you explain your use case? I don't understand what you're trying to do.. You get it on the response, you don't get it on the parameter.... You need to use the following spec:\n```json\n{\n  \"swagger\": \"2.0\",\n  \"info\": {\n    \"description\": \"Test endpoints.\",\n    \"version\": \"v1\",\n    \"title\": \"Rest API\"\n  },\n  \"host\": \"www.test.com\",\n  \"basePath\": \"/v1\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"File Transfer\",\n      \"description\": \"Api calls\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"schemes\": [\n    \"https\"\n  ],\n  \"paths\": {\n    \"/services\": {\n      \"get\": {\n        \"tags\": [\n          \"File Transfer\"\n        ],\n        \"summary\": \"Get transfer services list\",\n        \"description\": \"List of services\",\n        \"operationId\": \"getServicesList\",\n        \"consumes\": [\n          \"application/json\"\n        ],\n        \"produces\": [\n          \"application/xml\"\n        ],\n        \"responses\": {\n          \"200\": {\n            \"description\": \"Success\",\n            \"schema\": {\n              \"type\": \"string\"\n            }\n          },\n          \"400\": {\n            \"description\": \"Bad request\",\n            \"schema\": {\n              \"$ref\": \"#/definitions/ErrorResponse\"\n            },\n            \"headers\": {\n              \"Content-Type\": {\n                \"type\": \"string\",\n                \"description\": \"application/xml\"\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"definitions\": {\n    \"ErrorResponse\": {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"errors\": {\n          \"type\": \"array\",\n          \"items\": {\n            \"$ref\": \"#/definitions/error\"\n          },\n          \"xml\": {\n            \"wrapped\": true\n      }\n    },\n    \"traceId\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"example\": \"f59c89b8-4e90-4d3a-ad44-99543d8d0697\",\n      \"description\": \"traceId\"\n    }\n  }\n},\n\"error\": {\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"code\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"example\": \"InvalidRequestBody\",\n      \"description\": \"error code\"\n    },\n    \"description\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"example\": \"The data in the request body was not found or is invalid.\",\n      \"description\": \"Human readable message meant details decription of error cause\"\n    },\n    \"details\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"example\": \"The request contained missing or invalid data in body.\",\n      \"description\": \"Human readable description of this error code - always the same.\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"xml\": { \"name\": \"error\"}\n}\n\n}\n}\n```. That's something you need to ask the Springfox people.. Closing in favor of https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/2906.. See #1232.. Issue confirmed. Not sure it's related to Safari though, I've seen similar things in other browsers. We'll need to investigate.. What?. Not really sure what you're asking us.. This is not something we can help with (and it has nothing to do with the editor). You generated the swagger spec from a tool, and what you have generated doesn't work as expected. That swagger file simply describes your API and apparently the description itself is wrong. We can't tell you what's wrong with it because we don't know your API. I suggest you file a ticket with the product producing your Swagger spec.. While we understand the merits of separating it, due to our own constraints, we cannot do it at this time and it's not on our near roadmap. . @karux you can't do that with the OSS Editor. If you want to make it work, you'd need to introduce code changes and manage it locally. Is this what you're after?. Closing for lack of response.. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#5322. It doesn't support JSON and YAML schema imports, it supports JSON and YAML representations of the spec itself. There isn't a representation of that in XML and there won't be one, so you can't just import an XSD. An XSD will normally describe a model, not your API, but even if it does describe your API, it's not Swagger.. I cannot. They have nothing in common. There is just no representation of Swagger in XML. Nor Protobuff. Nor other representation formats other than YAML or JSON.. XSD is an XML model description.\nSwagger (whether in JSON or YAML) is an API description.\nThere is no support for importing XSDs. You can describe your APIs using JSON or YAML, and if you need XML modeling for your schemas, you can do that, to some extent, but you cannot do that with XSD but you'd have to manually convert it to JSON Schema and use Swagger's XML extensions. Note, not all XMLs can be represented in Swagger.. Please check the README and the prerequisites. You need to run it with node 6.. The project is intended for single user only, we currently don't have plans changing that.. @kPshi - which version of swagger-editor do you use?. Try the latest version - it should be fixed there.. Great :). @shockey to clarify:\nitems can only have a value of type object and not an array.\nSo in the example, the following is invalid:\nyaml\n          schema:\n            type: array\n            items:\n              - $ref: '#/definitions/Product\nwhereas this is valid:\nyaml\n          schema:\n            type: array\n            items:\n              $ref: '#/definitions/Product. Closing for inactivity. Please reopen if needed.. Is the github file public?. Is there any chance you're passing the direct github url to the validator and not the raw? (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmware/harbor/master/docs/swagger.yaml). Thank you for pointing that out. In the mean time, the link to the document is https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/2.x/docs/cors.md.. We're not going to fix this issue.. The link will be broken. It only exists in the 2.X version and doesn't exist in the 3.X version. We're not going to release a new 2.X version unless we find something insanely critical.. @shockey the type array can appear in the Schema Object, the Parameter Object and the Header Object. The first two as you mentioned are covered, not sure if the third is as well.. What does this mean?. Try clearing your browser's cache or run the latest version locally. We're working on updating the online editor to the latest version where this issue should not occur.. @brodney we'd love to help, but really need more details.\nWhich editor did you use? OS? Browser? What crashed? The browser? The editor tab?. Thanks for the details. We recently released a new version of the editor, but that's not available online yet (soon). Can you try running the editor from a clone of this repo? You only need to open the index.html file at the root, no build required.. Just master.. Thanks for the feedback, @brodney. You mentioned you use Safari - which version of Safari? Would you mind testing the file opening with a different browser too?. Thanks for your patience and checking things, @brodney. I really appreciate the help.\nIf you don't mind, could you open a separate ticket for one of the two issues you mentioned here. It's easier to handle isolated issues, and I normally prefer users to open the tickets so they get notified about the progress properly.. Not at the moment, and I'm afraid it's not high on our priority list, especially because you can do it manually.. This is not something we're planning on implementing in the editor.. See known issues.. The answer you got on SO is right. OPTIONS should never require auth to execute.. @shockey huh. Didn't notice, thanks.\n@michkhol this is something we won't fix in the 2.x branch, so please use the 3.x one.. That's an issue you need to take with the SmartAPI site.. The online editor has a way to revert to the older editor until we implement the code generation calls in it. Unfortunately, there's an issue with the older editor being hosted, but we'll fix that issue later today.\nIn the meantime, you can always use the codegen directly, or the online generator at http://generator.swagger.io/.. You can switch back to the old editor (link works now), or you can use the generator directly, as mentioned above.. editor2.swagger.io (link is in the current editor).. It works for me. We just updated the DNS so it might take some time to get to you. Also, you might want to clear your DNS cache and try again.. See https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/1280#issuecomment-295587275.. See https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/1280#issuecomment-295587275.. It's accessible now.. We've made a lot of changes to the validation in the editor. They include more cases, and we've tried to provide clearer messages to help you with authorizing a spec.\nThe first error is real - you cannot have query strings in the path.\nThe second one, I haven't seen before, so difficult for me to say. If you can share your spec, I could look into it.. The spec doesn't support it, so it's an error. It's an invalid definition. Warnings are things that are recommended to look at, but you don't have to 'fix' them. This error, you do.. It's a validation issue we can change. However, I don't really see why you'd use an anchor for that specific case, if you only reference it from models. Just reference em1 and em2 to NetworkInterfaceState and that's it.. Yeah, that should be a warning and not an error, but why would get that?\nI'm saying you should have it like this:\nyaml\nNetworkInterfaceState:\n  type: \"string\"\n  enum:\n    - \"UP\"\n    - \"DOWN\"\nSystemState:\n  type: \"object\"\n  properties:\n    master:\n      type: \"boolean\"\n    networkInterfaces:\n      type: \"object\"\n      properties:\n        em1: \n          $ref: '#/definitions/NetworkInterfaceState'\n        em2: \n          $ref: '#/definitions/NetworkInterfaceState'\nThat shouldn't yield that error.\n. If you want to set a different example for each instance, then you're right, the $ref won't work.\nWhy you'd want to have an example for a field that has two possible enum values... that's a different issue ;). Related to https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/2946.. That's an issue with swagger-node. It hasn't been updated. Please file the ticket there.. What do you mean by fold the left panel?. Thanks for the explanation. Is the goal to have a view only mode? If not, what would be the reason to do that? Trying to understand.. The new Swagger-Editor is just a plugin to Swagger-UI. If you want only the view part, simply use Swagger-UI and you'll get exactly the same result, without the need to configure anything.. We'd be happy to review PRs that work that in :). @shockey - this seems to be a repeating issue, that fixes that get into swagger-ui, don't get into the swagger-editor release.. Just tried it and it works as expected. If you have an issue, please share the spec for us to reproduce.. @MBurchard that's due to https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/2841.. So the small tweaks that include changes to 39 files... what's up?. Can we close this PR while the smaller ones are being prepared?. Thanks @ponelat.. Yup, the tokenUrl must be a full URL.. Sorry for the delayed reply. Going to close out the ticket as we have other tickets referring to improving error messages.\nAs for the API being hosted in different environments, OAS3 now supports relative URLs, so that would be an alternative.. Thank you for the suggestion, but at the moment this is outside of the capacity of what we can do. . @robinsingh-bw Swagger doesn't use the full JSON Schema. One of the restrictions is that type must be a single value and not an array. null is not supported as a type at all.. That's a bug. I believe we made the wrong assertion at the time.. Check the prerequisites. Also, you don't need to build it to run it locally - check the README.. @shockey \n``yaml\nswagger: \"2.0\"\ninfo:\n  description: \"This is a sample server Petstore server.

This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#5524. Thanks for the report @QuduSEC. As you suggested, we'll add the email. In general it's just security@swagger.io.. Can you share a copy of your spec?. Thanks. I suspect this is due to how the spec is converted to JSON.. This is not a high priority for now, but the first thing I'd test is the request being sent to the codegen with v2 and v3 (given the example above) - I suspect a difference there.. We should just convert the content of the editor to JSON before sending it, no need to use swagger-js for the resolution (or the pre-resolved object).. Afraid not. This is low on our priority list for now. We'd be happy to review PRs addressing this issue.. @grosch thanks for the feedback. Can you share a screenshot to point us in the right direction? Just want to make sure we're on the same page.. There's a link at the top bar of the new editor to use the old editor - http://editor2.swagger.io.. Might even make more sense to just convert and bring a popup message saying it was converted.\nWe officially don't really support JSON for editing, so might as well just work around it.. No. There's a manual process that deploys to editor.swagger.io, _and_ we do it only after releases - so what's deployed is notmaster` but a tagged version. \nAt the moment, we make a release every Friday, so the delay in fixes isn't that long.. We're not dismissing the benefits of this feature, but we just don't have the capacity to implement it. If anyone wants to give a fix a go, and submit a PR, we'll be sure to review it as soon as possible.. They're gone again, @shockey. Gone again.. Yup, thanks for reporting.. @bodnia is this the same as https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/3069?. @gwynjudd right, if it does, then that's something you'd need to fix on your end.. Not yet.. Not yet, but PRs are welcome.. While somewhat unclear in the spec itself, type arrays are not supported in the spec, nor is type null in general. The next version of the spec clarifies these restrictions and adds support for a nullable property to overcome the lack of null type.\nThere's no issue with the editor. You'd have to change your spec.. It's not clear, you're right. But that was the intent. I'm afraid it really is not supported by the spec. . This is a duplicate of #1241 - but currently we have no immediate plans on implementing it.. You defined the path as /user/{username} - that means you must have a path parameter called username - it's part of the path.. Thanks for reporting. This is an issue with swagger-ui. Moving there for further treatment.. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-ui#3163. That's what it does today. The Editor is just an extension to the UI.. There's no difference. You can use it offline just as before. Not sure what's missing for you. You can edit any spec in it.. We know that we're way behind on the documentation. Unfortunately, it's hard to maneuver between the priorities. Did you try just adding a file to that folder, build, and see if it's being picked up?. And now I'm curious about the usecase :). Aha! I thought you meant the import from the menu. The import with URL isn't implemented yet - it's in the known issues.. The import from the file menu works, it's only the query parameter that isn't. We'd welcome PRs :). We don't have the capacity to implement all features at the moment. If this feature is important to you, consider submitting a PR and we'll do our best to review it as soon as possible.. @dynostudios how is that the same issue?. @hkosova Thanks for reporting, I'd noticed that too.. We've tried to include all old validations, and new ones, but probably missed a few. The best approach would be to open tickets on those, and of course, if possible, submit PRs.\nProperties alongside $ref are still provided as warnings. The difference is that we do not present the warnings in the view pane, to less clutter the UI. Warnings are still shown as a yellow triangle in the gutter left to the line in question.\nAs for the enum, that's an oversight. I don't know if it's right to consider it an error rather than a warning, but that's a different question.. Moving this to swagger-ui as this is a rendering issue.. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-ui#3208. Which version of the editor are you referring to?. I assume you mean anchors, not references.. You can't. The spec only allows you to describe one data type/description per response.. The next version of the spec will allow more flexibility. However, if you depend on the http error code as the differentiator, defining multiple potential responses won't help other than documentation, for which you can use the description field now anyway.. Can you share your current file so we can look into it?. You can email it to me (email in profile).. The 2.0 spec doesn't support Bearer authentication, so the editor doesn't support it either (unless done via an OAuth2 flow). The UI will offer ways of manipulating it so you can control and add the string yourself, but it doesn't at the moment.\nThe next version of the spec added support for bearer authentication, but it's not released yet.. 2.0 will never support null as it's fixed. 3.0 of the spec already added support for it, and we'll enable it as we develop 3.0 compliance.\nAs for the validation itself, that's something we can take care of, but not the highest priority at the moment.. Using which version of swagger-editor? What do you mean by 'clicking any element'?. Thanks. I was able to reproduce the issue as well.. The current version of the spec doesn't support templating the host (the next version will), so there's nothing we can do about that.\nThe second issue is covered by #1303.. We do not support OpenAPI 3.0.0 yet. It's not even released.. Yup, that's a validation issue.. Thanks @hkosova, was looking for that ticket. Closing as a duplicate.. See #1261.. The online one works for me. Which browser+version do you use?\nCan you share the API definition you have?. There's always going to be a trade off when it comes to performance vs the time errors are displayed. Lowering the delay would work for smaller definitions, not so much for larger ones.. The specification doesn't support differentiating path parameters based on its type and/or pattern. The two paths would be considered identical.\nClosing as \"won't fix\".. @RoyHP are you seeing the validation error when using swagger-ui directly or when using swagger-editor?. From @RoyHP on June 27, 2017 16:22\n@webron I see this on the online editor http://editor.swagger.io/. Not sure why I moved the ticket here, but... \n@RoyHP - the 2.0 spec doesn't support examples for non-body parameters.. Now that swagger-editor is based on swagger-ui, this is an unimplemented feature in swagger-ui. You can follow up on the request here. That said, at the moment, it will not be included unless there's a community contribution as it's not high on our priorities.. It's actually handled correctly. Description fields use markdown, which means that the <script> portion is treated as HTML, specifically, an opening tag. You'd need to escape it in order for it to render properly.. No problem. Please reopen if there's still an issue.. Thanks for the update.. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-ui#3328. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-ui#3342. It's a valid YAML, it's not a valid API definition. You can't have an array of files, it's not supported by the spec.. Please try the latest version - there are known issues with IE11 in 3.0.13 - https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/releases/tag/v3.0.14.. Thank for the PR, but I don't see us merging it. The editor is intended to support YAML editing only, and already has a method of downloading it as JSON.. We appreciate the willingness to contribute though, it's very important to us. We'd be happy to consider future PRs for merging.. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-ui#3376. Please don't cross-post issues, it just makes our lives more difficult.\nThe issue is with the online validator, the editor validation is correct. You have duplicate paths. Move the operations under the same path and you'd be good.. It is a bug in the online validator and you already filed a ticket there.. This is not an issue with the editor. Please file the ticket on the codegen.. Can you share a full definition?. I don't see the behavior of this being changed soon. The editor works locally and has no knowledge of where the file is hosted.. I understand, but in terms of priorities, it's not at the top. We'll gladly review PRs though.. This is not a PR, it's a feature request. At the moment, we're not doing any active work on supporting it, but we might in the future.. Unfortunately, given the work load that we have - I can't prioritize it at the moment. I'm sure this is not what you'd want to hear, but there is a solution we provide as a company in our commercial tool (whether free or paid versions). \nThis is not to say that that's the reason this is not being implemented here. The way it's implemented there is very different than what we could just migrate to the open source, otherwise we would have done it by now. We have limited resources and our to do list is (very) long - someone's going to not be happy with the results eventually. As stated above though, we'd review related PRs should anyone submit them.. The redirect uri is not part of the spec, so it's not something we're just able to support (perhaps via an extension). For now this would be needed to be configured directly in the ui/editor.. I don't recall seeing such a request, but you can file a ticket if you see the need for it.. You can pass it as a parameter to swagger-ui. You can also write your own plugin to extend the functionality.. It may be part of the OAuth2 spec, but it is not part of the Swagger/OpenAPI spec. If you want to see it changed, you'd need to file a ticket on the spec.. I've seen the issue with the current editor as well, just don't know how to reproduce it.. In the upcoming weeks we'll be taking a look at the auto-suggest and some other underlying features in the editor - hopefully this will get resolved as part of the process.. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#6145. The attached file is not a valid JSON (it's definitely not YAML).. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#6190. There's no mocking plugin in the online editor.. Please contact SwaggerHub's support then, this is not related to the OSS tool.. @halmai you're in luck, because @hkosova is responsible for that page :wink:.\nFYI - the example definition you provided is likely 2.0 and not 3.0.0. 2.0 doesn't support CommonMark, but it does support GFM which still allows for the ``` construct. . This is an issue for the spec, not swagger-editor. We just follow what the spec allows. If you'd like to try and see a change, you can file a ticket on the spec's repo.\nThat said, considering we're using a subset of JSON Schema, it's very unlikely that we'd deviate from that in the spec.. Before we dive into whether or not to implement the feature - swagger-editor uses swagger-ui directly. I can't see how you'd see different results at all. Can you share a spec that produces different views on both?. Not sure how, but you're using an old version of the editor. If you upgrade to the latest one, the display would be identical.. :scream:. ?. @shockey - this is the same as #1445 - the JSON Schema is not up to date.. What do you mean by 'root element'?. It's just how the template is built. If you'd like to see it changed, please submit a ticket to swagger-codegen and consider submitting a PR.. @shockey - This is like #1445 - looked at the schema in the code and it doesn't match the one in the JSON Schema PR.. Thanks @hkosova. This seems to be true if other properties are wrong too. Tried changing the in value to monkey - same effect.. @aleksi-kallio OAS3 has significantly changed the structure of the document.\nSpecifying security schemes is now under components and has been renamed to securitySchemes.\nTry the following:\nyaml\ncomponents:\n  securitySchemes:\n    jwt:\n      type: \"http\"\n      scheme: \"bearer\"\n      bearerFormat: \"JWT\". Yes, closing as duplicate of https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/3489.. Yup, closing as a duplicate of https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/3489.. @shockey I think this is due to a bug in the JSON Schema I fixed after you took it from the PR. Try to update it first and see if resolves the issue.. @patrickd- we introduced a fix yesterday, but failed to deploy it. It should be better now, can you give it another try? You might need to hard-reload the page to get the latest version.. Regarding the parameter ordering - does the order change when you export the yaml file from the editor or what you run it through swagger2markup?\nAs for the descriptions - that's a limitation of JSON references - you can't add additional fields to it. If you're just referencing a schema, you can use allOf the $ref and a simple description field, but I don't know if swagger2markup would process that.. This is due to a bug we have in the released version of the editor that's already fixed in master. You can use master for now, or wait until we make an official release which is planned for EOD today.. No worries, better to have duplicates than no reports at all.. Thanks, but yeah, without the file we can't do much.. It's an interesting case. I can't easily tell if your YAML is valid or not.\nYou're using YAML anchors abundantly. I've tried multiple tools around YAML, all failed to load and parse the file you attached.\nI'd recommend not using anchors but using JSON references as that's the standard way in the spec to support reusability. You can find out more details at https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/guidelines/v2.0/REUSE.md.\nAnother issue you have is that sometime you set the type of a definition as object and put items alongside it, which only makes sense if the type is array.. This is more of a question to the google group. Try posting the question there and provide more details on your server.. Are you defining a Swagger 2.0 or OpenAPI 3.0.0?. @Diarsid it's impossible to help without having a full API definition. Please file a new ticket and follow the issue template.. This issue belongs in swagger-codegen. Reopen the issue there and provide an API definition that reproduces the issue.. swagger-editor does not mock your API. If you run requests against a server, it will show you whatever the server returns.\nAs for the use of content, your definition is 2 .0 one, and content is part of the 3.0.0 version.. @minchao - in the above example, what do you have in the editor vs what do you pass to the online generator?. @shockey yeah, you hit the issue. Should pass the unresolved doc.. The definition you provide suggests a 2.0 version, but the error suggests a 3.0.0 validation. Can you provide your full API definition?. I see that now, thanks.. You need to host the definitions file and reference it with a full URL.. @rygilles while there's an issue with the validation error  because it's not giving you the right problem, your definition is invalid because implicit flow doesn't support the tokenUrl field.. Happy to hear. I'm reopening this because we still need to ensure a better validation error.. I don't think the spec needs to be updated. Semver is very common these days (for better or worse) and we try to not replicate information that's provided in other specifications where possible, but rather link to them.\nAs for the validation error - the validation defaults to Swagger 2.0 when it doesn't recognize the openapi field - that's the differntiator. . Thanks for the report, closing in favor of https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/3325.. @shockey any thoughts?. Then it must be closed! Thanks for the report, @Somebi.. Sure, a configuration option makes sense and it existed in the previous version of the editor as well. As for prioritization, given what we have on our plate right now, not very high.. Note that we offer two packages, one of them is swagger-editor-dist.. The online codegen hasn't been updated in at least 2 months. What has changed though, is the resolution of references as they are sent to the codegen from the editor.\n@shockey could that be the reason for this?. Thanks. I suspect this is because we now no longer send the resolved spec to the generator, as that produced other issues with the generated code (and it's the right approach). \nWe'll wait for @shockey's confirmation, but if that's the case, then the issue should move to swagger-codegen.. Yup. @tagliala, please reopen the ticket on swagger-codegen and provide the relevant details there.. It should produce a validation warning that anything other than the $ref will be ignored.. Should be:\nyaml\n      parameters:\n        - name: title\n          in: query\n          required: true\nPlease refer to our documentation about how to write API definitions - https://swagger.io/docs/specification/describing-parameters\nIn the future, provide full API definitions and not snippets as it makes it more difficult to support.. @owenconti maybe you can look into this one as well.. Hmm, I don't think we can take away the sanitization due to the XSS vulnerabilities. Can you check with @shockey about it?. Can you provide an API definition that reproduces the issue?. On second thought, I'm going to close the issue. Please file a new ticket and follow the issue template. We need more details to be able to address it and the questions are available in the template.. Assuming this has been opened by mistake.. Yeah, that's a regression caused by changing the JSON Schema validator. We really need to address this.. You're mixing 2.0 with 3.0.0 here. 3.0.0 doesn't have definitions, it has components\\schemas. You'd need to modify your definition and references to make it work.. Thanks for reporting the issue and the fix. I'm going to reopen the ticket since we need to rework that validation message. It's not useful to users and we should do a better job at it.. @mroach fwiw, fixing and improving the error messages is a high priority for us, hopefully would have a major improvement within a couple of weeks.. This is due to #1343 - closing as duplicate.. parameters is a reserved word of a sort as it is used by the spec. The problem is the reserved words are not based on the location which is causing the issue. If you change the name to parameters1, the error will go away.. I understand that, and it's a bug, and that bug is covered by the referenced ticket above.. @alasdairhurst thanks for opening the ticket, it's very helpful. Mind reopening it on swagger-ui? The rendering is controlled there.. Thanks. Since for now, this is mostly a rendering issue, it's definitely a UI issue.. @JRGit4UE - using the url parameter loads the API definition for me. The issue I'm seeing is that it loads it as a JSON string where it should auto-convert to YAML, but that's a separate known issue.. @shockey - looks like it doesn't render the array entry as an array, unlike with OAS2.. You can have references to external files, but those would only work if those files are hosted. You can't edit multiple files with the editor.. @dantebarba are you using the online editor at http://editor.swagger.io or do you use swaggerhub.com?. Okay, in that case, please continue using the SwaggerHub's support for any further issues with it. They use modified versions of the open source version and are better equipped to provide you with the answers you'd need.. The Editor is intended to be used with a single file. You can still use references, but they'd have to be fully qualified URLs and not relative ones.\nWe might implement a way to set a base URL for references, but it won't be soon.. @stevendearborn it sounds like you're confusing the versions of the tool with the versions of the spec.. Closing this in favor of #1409.. We just provide the tool, not the API. If you have an issue with their API, contact them.. We need to create a similar document for swagger-editor, but https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/master/docs/version-detection.md is fairly close when it comes to 3.X. . Thanks for the report - this is another example of https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/1919. Please add a comment there with the attached file so we can have that as a reference.. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-ui#3853. https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen. Most likely you need to enable CORS in your server. Take a look at https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui#cors-support.. That's only one header out of 3. You're missing Access-Control-Allow-Methods and Access-Control-Allow-Headers.. Take a look at the browser's network console. Also, which browser do you use?. The actual requests being sent when you execute the call + the responses.. Okay, but I need to see the network console, not just the result in the editor.. Looking for something that looks more like this: \n\n. Assuming Firefox, Tools->Web Developer->Network.\nIn Chrome, View->Developer->Developer Tools, and switch to the Network tab.\nYou should execute the API calls only after you have the Network console open.. Thanks, that explains it. For some reason, your web server requires authentication for OPTION calls, but it shouldn't. You need to disable that.. Great, happy to hear you got it sorted out.. Thanks for the report. Issues regarding code generation should be opened against https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen.. Generally speaking, yes, a bug can impact both. That said, an empty items object is not wrong.. For general questions on how to use the spec, please use the google group.. This is indeed an issue that needs to be addressed, but it's also a configuration option in the server. The Accept header is what the client requests, but the server does not have to comply with that request if it is not familiar with the media type, and can reply with whatever it wants (providing the proper media type in the content-type header, of course). There is no technical limitation of having the client ask for JSON and the server replying with YAML.. Right, I'm only saying that this is not a workaround but a perfectly acceptable solution.. You're right, we disagree. There's nothing imperfect/non-compliant/vague about that solution. I'd argue that we should just send */* and let the server decide to return whatever it wants. That's not really different than having the server return whatever it wants regardless of the Accept header. . Again, we don't fully agree. The client doesn't state what it can only accept. It states what it wants to accept. The server does not have to comply with that request. There's no ambiguity. The server is not saying \"hey, I'm telling you this is a JSON but it's in fact YAML\", it's saying - \"This is what I can give you, it's YAML, hope you can work with it.\". Nothing ambiguous, nothing wrong with it. This does not go against the HTTP spec and it's a perfectly valid solution.. Is this when rendering the definition or when trying to generate code from it through the editor?. The rendering is probably due to CORS - https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui#cors-support. What do you mean by \"generating the json\"?. It sounds like you expect the editor to dereference the remote references when you download as JSON (or YAML) - that's something the editor doesn't do (and won't). The download option simply gives you a file copy of what you have in the editor, and will convert it if needed to YAML or JSON.\nAs a side note, your referenced definitions have mistakes in them. They seem to use internal references that don't exist.. Is there any other pending issue or can the ticket be closed?. This is not an issue with the editor. If you're using the generator to generate the code, file the ticket with that project. If you're using it directly within a different project, open it with that one instead.. @shockey this needs to be addressed.. Please file the ticket on swagger-codegen.. The issue template is there to help us help you. If you take the time to fill it, we'll be happy to take the time and help you out.. The template is there when you file a new issue. You literally had to select it all and delete it in order to file the issue.\nAnd no, I don't want 'my users' to do 'free beta testing'. This is a free product and an open source one. Use it at will. If you want our help, we'll do our best to offer it, but the least you can do is follow our structure.. Thanks for the report. Please file any code generation issues with swagger-codegen.. I've asked you to follow the issue template when filing the ticket here because we need that information. Which version of the editor do you use? We'd also need an API definition that reproduces the issue.. A few things here. time is not a recognized format in OAS and as such, will not affect the rendering. It might be added at some point in the future to the OAS format registry, but there's no formal work on that yet.\ndate is a recognized format which would have the format YYYY-MM-DD according to the spec. While compliant with ISO 8601, it doesn't mean that's the exact format you'd expect. You are right that the examples should render that more appropriately. \n@shockey can elaborate more on this, but there might be a way to extend the UI to render user-created formats based on their needs. If that were the case, you'd have to create your own plug-in and run it locally to use.. Do you get that on loading the editor? After editing something? . Thanks. We need some way to reproduce it though, so any details would help.. @MartinDelVecchio do you get the same experience of 'valid' documents using our online validator?. Yes, it's a different tool - it's the one used to validate through swagger-ui. For example, https://online.swagger.io/validator/debug?url=http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json.. @jemerald much like the editor, the codegen can't support local references. If you want the code generation to work, you'd need to use fully qualified URLs (or a hosted version of all files where the references are relative), and then the codegen will be able to pick those up and process them.. @shockey this should have been resolved with #1343?. Unfortunately, this is a limitation of JSON Schema - there's no real easy way of doing that.. This was a temporary issue with the online generator which is now resolved.. This was a temporary issue with the online generator which is now resolved.. This was a temporary issue with the online generator which is now resolved.. What @hkosova said.. They are not different. /path/{pathName} and /path/{whatever} are equivalent not matter what. That's how the spec regards it, and that's pretty much it. The fact that your server doesn't have issues with it, doesn't mean the spec doesn't. The spec doesn't allow plenty of things different server implementations do.. Thanks for reporting. We had an issue with the online generator, should be all good now.. Please re-file the ticket following the issue template. The ticket is missing some crucial information for us to be able to offer assistance.. We don't maintain the IBM products and we don't know what version of the editor they provide. We'd need to know the actual version in order to point you in the right direction.\nHowever, checking that API definition in the latest editor version (which you can find at editor.swagger.io) shows the behavior as expected, so it's likely the issue is with whichever version IBM provides you, and the solution would be to upgrade that version.. @OwenLittleWhite - sorry you're experiencing that. Do you think you can create a short video demonstrating the problem?. @ealpha - interesting! Thanks for sharing the screencast. We'll look into it.. @shockey perhaps the first step would be to file a ticket with Ace?. Yup, this is not good. @shockey - ideas for the options?\nThis is going to be a struggle with performance vs functionality. I'm not sure adding a button is the right user experience.. @ponelat forgot to update the ticket, but we do have some thoughts on a solution, hopefully would be available in this week's release.. @glipman - that's... an unfortunate regression unfortunately which we'll fix shortly. The mistake is in the validation itself, not the remote reference. You can keep using those.. 1. Great question. Will have to get back to you on that.\n2. Should be available, yes.\n3. I believe the main concern is first to get to the correct line. This is the current behavior, expect when the errors point to the wrong line.\n4. It's asking for both.\n5. Do you mean 13? Doesn't make sense with 15.\nItem 17 doesn't exist! Is that means to be 15?. For 5 (13) - I believe the idea is to not trigger validation right away as that could drive the user nuts to see things change/flicker as they're typing.\n. OAS3's identifier is openapi: 3.0.0. Use that, and it'll work.. Your YAML file contains plenty of errors that you have to fix before the code generation will work. Not sure why you're using version 2.10.4 of the editor really.. @hkosova is (as usual) right. Swagger/OAS2 does not allow for relative token URLs.. Doesn't hang for me.... @shockey you lied :wink: . This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#8017. Quick update - we're working on changing the way our demos are served (some things have already changed). Hopefully this process will be completed by the end of the week and the issue will be resolved. Thanks for bringing it up.. Should be fixed now. Thanks for reporting.. @tk17aug this is not an issue for swagger-ui, but rather whichever too you use in your .net project to produce the API definitions.. Released!. The definition is actually valid, that's why there's no error or warning.. It's potentially a bug in the codegen as well, though it does look like the definition is not what you intended it to be (even though it's not technically wrong).. It's not a question of how it's interpreted by Swagger 2.0 but rather by JSON Schema. To my understanding, the editor is the one parsing it correctly. However, it's a non-intuitive way of representing it, which is why I'd suggest adding the indentation regardless of the correctness.. @ralfhandl Swagger 2.0 (and OAS3) require that type is a single value and not an array. The error is with Editor 2.10.5, not the current version. As such, there's nothing to fix.. I know what the spec says, and that's missing information in it - and that's why the wording was improved in OAS3. As such, it's not supported and will not be supported. null is not a supported data type not in Swagger 2 and not in OAS3, though OAS3 introduced a way to express support for null value.\nThe limitations of Swagger 2 are known and clear (as you said, no support for anyOf) - the progression path should be to migrate to OAS3.. > The Responses Object MUST contain at least one response code, and it SHOULD be the response for a successful operation call.\nThat's the key sentence. SHOULD is not MUST. It's a recommendation, but failing to meet it does not invalidate anything. As such, changing the validation does not make sense. We really only need to make sure that there's at least one response defined.\nAs for the pet store itself, we're working on a new updated version of it, and hoping to tackle these things in it - however, these changes will not come into effect in the current version..

Not sure how you could easily group the end points on this basis, and still keep the operations collected under the same end point.\n. I like that idea, but I think it also is important to be able to navigate thorugh the api using tags from some kind of index - (which github used to support but now does not).

Right now, because we don't have any backend all of the import job is being done in client side. As part of the import, we wanted to clean up query param from the URL. If we do that without a hash change a redirect will happen which is not optimal. I am working on a backend for the editor. After that is done, the import will be a real query parameter and it will redirect to a unique URL where your imported file stored. For now, we will continue to have import as this.

I'm trying to use this myself, but I noticed that it's just using marcellodesales/swagger-editor-runtime and most of the steps are actually in the base image. Where is the Dockerfile that creates that image?\nI think it's best practice to make all the steps available in the source repo.  I'd like to propose the Dockerfile in this repo include all the steps necessary to create the image from some base distro container (like ubuntu:14.04). Maybe the image available at marcellodesales/swagger-editor-runtime can be the image created by this Dockerfile instead?\n. I think it's actually more than best practice. A developer should be able to rebuild the image with their development branch. That is currently not possible since all of the steps are hidden away in the base image.\n. @marcellodesales No worries! \nThe docker build cache actually caches every step, so you don't gain anything by splitting it into multiple Dockerfiles. Try it out! The only time it will not use the cache is after an ADD if the hash of the files changes. So I always do ADD . as one of the last steps.  For builds like this that have dependencies in a file, you can ADD package.json first, so that it only re-builds those steps when dependencies change (not when any file changes).\nI put out a CR that was merged (#188). Most of the steps are from docker history from the original image, so it should be pretty close to what you had in the base images.\n. You are right that it wouldn't know about transitive dependencies.\nIt will bust the cache for every step after an un-cached ADD, so if the dependencies in package.json change, the following steps are run. But, if package.json doesn't change, it continues to use the cache for all steps until it finds an ADD that has changed.\nTo pickup transitive dependencies that aren't reflected in a package.json you'd have to run --no-cache.\nPython deals with this problem by storing both: immediate dependencies in setup.py, and a full list of all dependencies (including transitive), in a requirements.txt.  I'm not sure if npm has any similar mechanism.\n. Thanks!\n. Interesting, it seems like you could get away with just representing 2.0 as the number 2, since it still allows for 2.1, etc. Should we be creating an issue on the swagger-spec project then, if you feel it is incorrect?\n. The thing is, I don't really feel this is a bug in the spec. It seems perfectly valid to make the version a number. If you feel this is an error in the spec, I think you should ticket it.\n. True. Thanks for creating the issue on the spec! I'll follow it to see where it goes.\n. Thanks for the fix!\n. @mohsen1\nI think your edit is misleading. The config section is under the Docker section, but they are not related.\nThe config section applies to everything under \"Running Locally\".\nI believe it should be made it's own section under \"Running Locally\", not Development\n.

No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://djb.na.sas.com:9000' is therefore not allowed access.\nso I guess now CORS support is needed now even on the same host, but if different ports are used?? I think that's new, as the editor was working fine for me previously before I did a git pull today.  (my swagger-ui instance is running on my localhost port 80 so it can access the swagger.json file fine w/o CORS support)\nI enabled CORS on my localhost server via https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/blob/master/samples/java-jaxrs/src/main/java/com/wordnik/swagger/sample/util/ApiOriginFilter.java\nand now swagger-editor can read my swagger files again.\nThis does seem like a regression because I do think I was able to access\nthese files before.... (I'm not positive; I may have pasted the YAML in \nor loaded files, not URLs).\n. It would be extremely nice for your users to produce a more meaningful message in the Import dialog than the cryptic\n{\"data\":\"\",\"status\":0,\"config\":{\"method\":\"GET\",\"transformRequest\":[null],\"transformResponse\":\n[null],\"url\":\"http://djb.na.sas.com/swagger/examples/test.json\",\"headers\":{\"accept\":\n\"application/x-yaml,text/yaml,application/json,*/*\"}}}\nAlso, would also be extremely nice for your users to create a Troubleshooting section on the swagger-editor README.md and/or in the wiki would. I fear some folks may simply give up since the constraint is not at all obvious to newcomers. Simply marking such non-obvious usability things as closed does not address the overall usability of the Swagger ecosystem.\nI'll add another ticket...\n. Using https://cors-it.herokuapp.com/ won't work for resources inside a corporate intranet or on a local workstation, i.e. any time the Swagger spec is not visible from an external internet service,\nsuch as during development of an API/API spec.\nIn fact, I think this makes the situation worse because that external service appears to have a long timeout (30 sec or so?) before I finally get\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n    <html>\n    <head>\n      <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">\n      <style type=\"text/css\">\n        html, body, iframe { margin: 0; padding: 0; height: 100%; }\n        iframe { display: block; width: 100%; border: none; }\n      </style>\n    <title>Application Error</title>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n      <iframe src=\"//s3.amazonaws.com/heroku_pages/error.html\">\n        <p>Application Error</p>\n      </iframe>\n    </body>\nPlease reopen.  Documenting how to handle CORS during Swagger spec development is still important.\n. useful, yes. I was able to simply add my own servlet filter, but a configurabl CORS proxy service would be highly useful.\n. I added a pull request for cors-it to document how to build and use it. If I have time, I'll do the same for swagger-editor / README.md\n. Note that the location of the importProxyUrl cited in e80c6c6 has moved from ./app/scripts/enums/defaults.js to ./app/config/defaults.json ; this should be added to README.md when documenting CORS support in swagger-editor.\n. I created a pull request for documenting how to configure CORS for swagger-editor and how to enable CORS for local resource that cannot be accessed by the default cors-it proxy at https://cors-it.herokuapp.com\n. I was able to find some help after searching a bit, but it might be useful to keep this issue here in case others hit the same problem.\nI was able to get swagger-editor running without the above error with angular by first doing\n$ mv app/bower_components app/bower_components.old\nthen doing\n$ npm start\nThus, cleaning up before starting via \n$ rm -rf app/bower_components\nshould also do the trick\n. thanks, @mohsen1 \n. Thanks, I was able to change this to djb.na.sas.com and the editor now works as expected. Can you add a note about this to the 'Running Locally' section on README.md?\n. any pointers on what to configure? I'm not a system or network administrator. Whatever you can do to make installing/configuring/using the swagger tools easier for all potential users, the better. Thanks.\n. https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/pull/515\n. My change to connect.js does not fix the problem - I was merely showing what changes I tried\nthe problem still exists that development mode only works on localhost and does not work if\nI set a hostname (in my case, I used swagger.na.sas.com which is a DNS alias for the host\nI'm running this on). prod mode works with a hostname other than localhost but development mode does not.\nplease reopen and investigate\n. I'm running dev so should that not be disabled for me already?\n. Ah, I see - I'm not running on localhost, so it thinks I'm on production. Can this setting use the same logic in connect.js - i.e. if I run `npm run develop' then I should be in develop mode -- set a flag there that is read by boostrap. (I can't use localhost because I want to share this instance with other develoeprs)\n. setting that to false in my dev branch works - editor comes up.\nStill need a fix for production when using a configured local cors-it instance\n. I'll resubmit a new PR  - I don't see an easy way to squash after creating the pull request, and this one is easy enough to just recreate\n. Thanks, @feyguy - I look forward to some doc on how to add extensions... preferably with an example. (Being able to manage  two+ codebases -- clone from github and the local extensions/plugins -- is important.) a Developing.md page would help.

    "davisford": "Hi, I'm having the same exact issue.  The shorthand - $ref: '#/parameters/someParam' is giving me errors on editor.swagger.io -- has anyone else found a workaround aside from inlining every parameter, which is awfully repetitive for each op.\n.

I'm a bit baffled on what I'm doing wrong here?\nI thought that a path would take a parameters object, but it doesn't like whatever I'm feeding it ?\n\nUnder swagger object, parameters has:\nyaml\nparameters:\n    orgId:\n       name: orgId\n       description: the id of an `org`\n       in: path\n       type: number\n       format: int\n    cardId:\n       name: cardId\n       description: the id of a `giftcard`\n       in: path\n       type: number\n       format: int\n. Wow, I just figured that out myself via trial and error.  That was a tad frustrating....thank you so much @webron \n.

There is a separate route to update customers, and I don't want to send it back on every update.  But you can send back the customerId.  Unfortunately marking it readOnly does not appear to work.  In the \"try this operation\", it lists customer and since customer itself has required fields, they are required on any method that embeds it also.\n. Oh, that explains that, I guess.  Can you somehow pull it in under the property name, like:\nyaml\n   properties:\n      customer:\n         readOnly: true \n         allOf:\n           - $ref: '#/definitions/Customer'\n. I'm having this same problem.  I cloned this repo today, built the dist, copied dist/ into my own project and serve it up at localhost:8080/editor/ then I work on the yaml and try it against the server apis running there on local host.\nI have a a path that looks like this:\n``` yaml\npaths:\n/orgs:\n    post:\n      produces: \n        - application/json\n      consumes: \n        - application/json\n      description: |\n        Creates a new Org object.

I did not see an OPTIONS request being sent out.\nIncidentally, with the editor, is there no way to set the server's base url for the \"Try This\" feature?  Currently, I have to host the build statically in my own app so I can try it out against my own api endpoints.  I'm aware of CORS, and could run the browser with security disabled, but it would be nice to be able to launch the build locally from the filesystem, and point it to my running server.  I could not figure out how to achieve from skimming docs.  I'm sure I could hack it into the code, but just wondered if I was missing something.\n. I'm not sure how I missed that :)  Last (quick) question: when I dropped back to 2.9.6, it seems to be ignoring the readOnly property I have on the definitions.  With the latest release, it would only post those values in the body that were not listed as readOnly -- was that added just recently?\n. I seemed to have gotten past most of my issues -- thank your for the help.  I'm building and running the editor on 9000 in dev mode, and pointing host to my server, so readOnly works again, and I do now see the pre-flight OPTIONS requests being sent.\nThe editor is running HEAD but I do notice this error fills up the console - is that expected?\n\n. After adjusting my CORS setup on my server as per the docs\nThis is what I'm seeing (note, I just did a git clone github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor && npm install && npm serve)\nEdit: whatever version is running on editor.swagger.io does not have these problems -- it works just fine for me when I point it to my server.\nThe pre-flight OPTIONS request (note how it urlencodes the JSON payload)?\n\nThat seems to have succeeded, and then it is supposed to POST, but again, instead it issues a GET request, and the params are urlencoded.\n\nThis is what the editor preview is showing would be sent for the above post:\n\n. Success - it is now posting the body as expected.\nEdit spoke too soon, angular errors are still there in the console...not sure if it is benign or what.\n\n. JWT is a token.  I have an unprotected endpoint to authenticate and get the token, but I'm having trouble specifying the securityDefinition and security section.  I'm fine with pasting the token in, and I have that working via \n\n..but I'm having trouble specifying how to secure a particular endpoint with the token.   JWT server libs typically expect the format Authorization: Bearer <token here>.  I'm not seeing that get posted through after I add the token.\nyaml\nsecurityDefinitions:\n  auth:\n    type: apiKey\n    description: autheticate with jwt\n    name: Authorization\n    in: header\nand on an endpoint:\nyaml\n    post:\n      security:\n        - auth: []\n. I think it boils down to this section of code which assumes for OAuth it requires \"Bearer\" but for api_token it just pastes the token and allows no way to specify what the server expects.\nI do suppose I can prefix the token with \"Bearer: \" when I paste it in, but it seems pretty standard for most JWT libraries to expect it, even though I do not find it referenced in the RFC - so I can understand any pushback on including it.\n. Ok, thanks @mohsen1 \n. It is not specific to IE, I am using Chrome. \nEdit: seems to work fine in Firefox after completely clearing history / storage, etc., but I am not able to make it work in Chrome.\n. It's cross-origin, yep, but I do have a CORS server which happily serves these requests.  In any event, the preview of the outbound POST also doesn't update and show the Authorization header.  Not sure if that's a surefire indication that it still wouldn't actually send the header, but in practice when I do send the request, the header is not present.\n\n\n\n. @mohsen1 I think you hit the nail on the head.  I was not aware it was a known bug :)  I'm betting that was it, b/c after I tried refreshing and toggling the list all operations button a few times, it finally does appear in the outbound post preview.  Feel free to close or mark as dupe of the other issue.  Thanks for the quick responses.\n. @mohsen1 it seems this is a newer regression, b/c I've been using editor.swagger.io to test my specs for several weeks now, and this recently popped up.  I can't put my finger on when, but it was a week or so prior.\n. Huh, that's really bizarre.  I do test my specs with https://editor.swagger.io - I rebuild them and paste them in and point them to localhost server.  So, I tried your snippet above and indeed it does work.  \nLet me take another look and see if mine still fails, and what the difference is.\n. Yes, it seems to work now for my spec as well.  Strange.  Did you deploy a new release in the last few days?  Last I tried it was the day I posted this issue, but it does seem to work now, so I'll close.\n. Cool, do you happen to know when the change will hit editor.swagger.io?\n. ",

Any change I can make to the JSON to fix it so the error doesn't appear in the first place?\n. Well spotted. Thank you!\n. Can I reopen this please?\nWhat I am trying to define in the swagger is two compulsory security requirements (AND not OR).\nSo I think the YAML should be:\nsecurity:\n  - Client ID: []\n    Basic Authentication: []\nRon confirmed in https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/issues/416 that that is the right way to write the YAML.\nIn which case swagger editor doesn't seem to support multiple security requirements?\n. PR https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/pull/563 submitted which fixes this.\n. I've seen the same, but only in chrome.\nIt always works in FF.\nChrome debugger shows this error on editor.swagger.io:\nRemote Address:185.31.19.133:80\nRequest URL:http://editor.swagger.io/bower_components/ace-builds/src-noconflict/mode-json.js\nRequest Method:GET\nStatus Code:404 Not Found\nWhich is likely not helping, and might then be causing the knock on effects meaning you can't actually edit content.\n. In my case its simple.\nOpen chrome browser, go to http://editor.swagger.io.\nTry and type in the editor panel - it will let you click, but if you bring up the debug tools you'll see you get an exception as soon as you hit a key on the keyboard.\nCan't really tell you where since its compiled JS.\n. Do you get the 404 for the mode_json.js file ?\n. setting editor mode to yaml means things work and I can type in the editor window.\nIf i set the mode to JSON (which seems to be the default) then I can't.\n\n. Seems fairly consistent to me - if I change any browser to use mode: json then I get the 404.\nThe reason I was seeing it straight away in chrome was that it was defaulting to mode: json.\nFF for some reason was defaulting to mode: yaml and so it didnt try to load that file and hence no 404.\nIf I force it to mode: json then I get the 404.\nAs yet I can't get it to successfully load that file anywhere:\nhttp://editor.swagger.io/bower_components/ace-builds/src-noconflict/mode-json.js is always a 404.\n. Add an extra section listing the required properties rather than adding 'required: true' to them individually.\nE.g.\n\ntype: object\nrequired:\n- name\nproperties:\n  name:\n    type: string\n  address:\n    $ref: '#/definitions/Address'\n  age:\n    type: integer\n    format: int32\n    minimum: 0\n\n. No idea why the CI build is failing - but it doesn't look to be related to this change.\n. See 'running in development mode' here in the docs:\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/docs/development.md\n. Is issue specific to IE? (If so its the session storage bug)\n. https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/551 :-) \n. The swagger spec says the host can only be a hostname or ip address. It does not support path.\nIf you want to use a subdirectory then look into the basePath property.\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md\n\"The host (name or ip) serving the API. This MUST be the host only and does not include the scheme nor sub-paths. It MAY include a port. If the host is not included, the host serving the documentation is to be used (including the port). The host does not support path templating.\"\n. As per the docs:\ngit clone https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor.git\ncd swagger-editor\nnpm start\n. If you follow the instructions above it will automatically open a browser window pointing to something like: http://localhost:8080/\nIt just works - I just ran it myself (on windows 7).\nCheck the output of the npm start command - maybe there was some error there?\nIt doesn't just build the 'dist' folder, it stands up a webserver and runs it automatically.\nI have never needed to manually point my web browser anywhere - the npm start command opens the browser tab for me.\n. If youre in IE, try a different browser. I think there is a known defect with ngStorage in IE.\n. Duplicate of either or possibly both the following? \nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/652 (example attribute within schemas)\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/674 (response example attribute)\n. Likely related to https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/pull/707\n. You can hide the editor pane in CSS, or I have had some success with modifying the router to simply not load the editor or header panes at all. But that was a nasty hack and not something that could be merged in.\n. If its a defect in the generated code rather than the editor itself then\nyou probably want to raise it here:\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen\nOn 28 November 2015 at 19:39, deefactorial notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nmy specific API error for my yaml is a little different:\nAPI Errors:\n#/definitions/access_token_response/properties/access_token_expiry/minimum: Expected type number but found type string\n1 error and 0 warnings\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/731#issuecomment-160331405\n.\n.

That doesn't look to be a valid swagger document. Looks like the definition of a model not a full swagger document, so the error is correct.\n. I am fairly sure it used to support XML. \nAdding try support to swagger editor back in Dec 2014 even has XML support ticked off.\nSo what I was expecting to happen is what the spec says - swagger editor would take the JSON schema representation and generate an object of the required content type (as set by 'Content-Type'), in this case application/xml.\nThere are XML specific attributes that can be set in the JSON Schema, but they are not required.\n. There's a duplicate operation in there too: /statuses/retweets/{id}\nI'll submit a PR when I get a chance, but mentioning it here so it isnt forgotten.\n. Different port on the same server is still a different domain from a CORS point of view. \nThis is working as designed.\n. It seems to be the definitions that are just $refs to other definitions that it doesn't like.\ne.g.       \"DeviceTag\": {\n         \"$ref\": \"#/definitions/Tag\"\n      },\nBut I can't see anything in the spec to say that isn't allowed.\n. Try the loopback project from strongloop, it can connect to database tables and create models (exposed as swagger) from them.\n. Since you say your issue is about generating client code, you likely want to raise it here: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen. Required attributes have to be local to that object itself - they cannot be ones inherited from other objects.\nIn your example if you want to make name and email required then they should be marked required on the object that declares them (\"user\").\nSlightly odd I know, but that just seems to be how swagger works.. The swagger spec says description fields are GH flavour markdown not HTML. So it is quite correct for HTML to be escaped.\nSee https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for tips on using markdown..

I added a screenshot where the 1st path is the one which is the subject of our conversation. Seeing the swagger-editor I have 2.6.18 ~/.npm/swagger-editor-for-apigee-127/2.6.18/package/package.json\n\n. I see two apigee-127 versions:\n$ ls ~/.npm/apigee-127/\n0.5.6   0.6.3\nAnd 0.6.3 is the last from 6 days ago. \n. Nice. Thanks for the quick answers. Closing this one.\n. Updated apigee to 0.6.3 globally and now the swagger-editor accepts type: file in a formData but the req.swagger.param.file object comes with its value undefined.

    "whitlockjc": "This should had been fixed already, swagger-tools/issues/61.  The difference between the scenario fixed and the one that is broken is that your items configuration doesn't seem to be proper, although I wonder why the structural validation isn't failing.  Long story short, here is how you are doing arrays:\njs\n{\n  \"type\": \"array\",\n  \"items\": {\n    \"SomeName\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"SomeRef\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nBut based on the schema, it should be done like this:\njs\n{\n  \"type\": \"array\",\n  \"items\": {\n    \"$ref\" \"SomeRef\"\n   }\n}\nNow, swagger-tools supports the later form and that support was from the Swagger 2.0 schema.  The reason this isn't throwing a structural error is because #/definitions/schema doesn't have \"additionalProperties\": false anywhere in its schema.

The second document above produces no warnings and it is the same as the first document but with proper array items.\n. I've updated swagger-tools/issues/#72 to describe this as I understand it.  Just know, /{type}{id} will never be supported as there is no way to tell where type ends and id begins.  Some might argue that this is one argument and its up to the implementor to take the typeWithId and parse it themselves but I will do what I can to support this in the ways possible.\n. I'm expecting to have Swagger Tools supporting references properly within the next few days.  Supporting references has resulted in a near full rewrite in the library.  I'll update you when I'm done.\n. While this is valid, I'm sure it's not what was intended by the user.  items can be an object or an array: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/schemas/v2.0/schema.json#L951\n. I did not, I've not put any time to swagger-tools due to other projects.  I'll get it fixed tomorrow.\n. int16 is not a valid format.  See the Data Types section of the Swagger 2.0 specification.\n. But int16 is not a valid JSON Schema format either.  So any JSON Schema validator will bomb on this without registering a custom validator.\n. In fact, I just tested this here https://json-schema-validator.herokuapp.com/ with the following: \njs\n{\n  \"type\": \"number\",\n  \"format\": \"int16\"\n}\nAnd got when validating the schema:\n[ {\n  \"level\" : \"warning\",\n  \"schema\" : {\n    \"loadingURI\" : \"#\",\n    \"pointer\" : \"\"\n  },\n  \"domain\" : \"validation\",\n  \"keyword\" : \"format\",\n  \"message\" : \"format attribute \\\"int16\\\" not supported\",\n  \"attribute\" : \"int16\"\n} ]\nHowever, using a valid (JSON Schema format or Swagger format) format works just fine.  Here is an example:\njs\n{\n  \"type\": \"string\",\n  \"format\": \"email\"\n}\n. Of course, most JSON Schema validators have ways to register custom validators...which is how the sway validator used by swagger-editor handle's Swagger's formats.  But registering custom, non-Swagger and non-JSON Schema validators, seemed to be outside the scope of things so nothing was ever supported in swagger-tools or sway.\n. I've deleted my comments.  I made a few of them not realizing the implementation linked to was giving a warning and not an error.  Anyway, the JSON Schema validator swagger-editor uses is z-schema and I'm filing a bug there to allow us to not fail on unknown format.\n. Done...I'll submit a PR there and when that is released, I'll update sway so that swagger-editor can be itself updated.\n. https://github.com/zaggino/z-schema/pull/133  As soon as it's pulled an z-schema releases, we'll update sway and swagger-editor.\n. That's what the PR above does.  Once it's supported, I will update the z-schema version in sway and configure sway to use this new feature.\n. sway@master supports this.\n. ",

    "jeff9finger": "This makes sense, but can an option be created that would allow this if someone really wants to do it? If I know that my spec is on the same system as the API and I am developing the spec, it seems reasonable to allow this as an option.\nWould support for this option create other problems?\n. When I'm developing an API, I would like to easily test and inspect the API as a whole using swagger-editor. If my API is large and I have multiple files that define the models, endpoints, etc., this is impossible with swagger-editor.\nCurrently, I'm trying to do this with swagger-ui. It is very cumbersome. swagger-ui is not really for development of an API, so error reporting is minimal. It is very difficult to determine where an error in my spec might be. I am open to other ideas, but have not really found a good one. Using swagger hub does not really solve my problem because I need to access my reference files from my local network.\nWhat I suggest is a property or some configuration setting that will allow me to specify the base bath for the relative references. Ideally, this would be able to be a remote protocol (like http) or local (like file).\nWould that concept work with swagger-editor?\n. Here is an update on the workaround that we have found...\nWe have worked around this problem by \"normalizing\" all the yaml files into one big file as part of the build process. This allows the tools to work on the one big file, but we can still develop and manage the files as separate files.\nI believe swagger-codegen has templates for normalizing all the separate files, but we have been using the tool from Reprezen. A great eclipse based tool and the product support is awesome!. @terencechow (sorry for the really slow response!)\nMy solution using Reprezen would work with swagger editor only by normalizing all the swagger files into one first, then loading it into swagger-codegen. Not really a good solution for swagger editor.\nBut we are using Reprezen instead of swagger editor to design our spec. I hope this answers your question. . +1\n. +1\n. I am having this same issue.\n. It seems that the relative $ref should resolve to something other than the editor URL. Maybe we can create a configuration property that specifies the location of the swagger spec for the purpose of resolving the relative refs.\nBecause the swagger spec supports the relative $ref, the editor should support it in some fashion if possible.\nCan this issue be revisited before closing it as wont-fix?\n.

Version cloned from githut doesn't work (white screen), because it doesn't contain \"dist\" directory.\nBut, you can make it work simply downloading it from \nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/releases/download/v2.10.3/swagger-editor.zip\nAlternatively you can clone branch gh-pages which seems to include \"dist\" folder.\nCan someone enlighten me why \"dist\" directory is added to .gitignore on master branch?\nI think this case should be mentioned in docs...\n.

The existing swagger tools are great, and we'll use them as-is.  I noticed that the Swagger Editor was a text editor (yaml editor with live preview) and thought it would be great to have something more Designer-like.  \nBecause it's not critical path to our project, and because it seems like a reasonably meaty contribution, I thought this might make a great senior project for one of the schools we work with for such things.  Then I saw the \"Designer\" menu item and thought \"uh oh, I'd better run it past these guys first to see what they think\".\nSo that was going to be my suggestion - if you're interested, we could come up with a set of requirements for a pie-in-the-sky visual/wysiwyg editor and get it implemented as a formal project.\nIf that sounds interesting, let me know.  If not, I totally understand!  :)\n. Hey @prabhatjha - yeah I'm definitely up for a google hangout.  That's probably the fastest way to discuss this. :)  Let me know when.

ID > 10 or nonintegers will simulate API error conditions\n      operationId: getPetById\n      produces:\n        - application/json\n        - application/xml\n      parameters:\n        - in: path\n          name: petId\n          description: ID of pet that needs to be fetched\n          required: true\n          type: integer\n          format: int64\n      responses:\n        \"404\":\n          description: Pet not found\n        \"200\":\n          description: successful operation\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/Pet\"\n        \"400\":\n          description: Invalid ID supplied\n      security:\n        - api_key: []\n        - petstore_auth:\n          - write_pets\n          - read_pets\n. the api_key mode will add the header to the request.\n. it will be fixed\n. @kurtuluso it's not a bug. When you send the request, it only make a OPTIONS request to server. The get request is not be sent because of the CORS strategy\u3002More info: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS#Preflighted_requests\n. @kurtuluso  It's a brower strategy. How did you implement the CORS fiter, Could you post pr or paste your code to us?\n. ok, I will learn how to add some test for this commit.\n. I have added the e2e test for the stored authentication.\n. Good idea! The editor preview looks more beautiful the the swagger-ui viewer.\n. After the backend is ready,  Swagger-editor will be support the multiple project preview and public sharing or team collaboration.\n. Ok, I have visited the anybin project before.\n. @mohsen1 I have figure it out finally! It's a json-editor's bug. When the param is required, a number type can not be zero.\n. @mohsen1 When type 0 to the duration filed, the schema-form's model is not updated. View the line: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/app/templates/try-operation.html#L3 for detail. \nBut I don't know how to fix it.\n. OMG, I just cost 2 hours to find out this issue.\n. @mohsen1  Maybe yes. I will check it today.\n. javascript\n$.getJSON('/config/defaults.json')\nThis make a request base on the url root. if we deploy the dist folder to sub path like http://domain.com/editor/index.html. Then it get the defaults.json by the url http://domain.com/config/defaults.json so throw a 404. \nthe window.location.pathname would be end with '/' or 'html' or a dirname like 'editor'. When it end with '/', it dosen't need to add a root path,just change the '/config/defaults.json' to './config/defaults.json' will be ok. When it end with 'html' or a dirname like 'editor' , the root path is the parent directory, so rootPath = pathname + '/../' . This logic fixes the defaults.json and the examples yaml 404 error, when deploy it in a sub folder or reverse proxy by nginx.\n. the same as above.\n. ",

Hi,\nI've found the reason:\nIf I want to send \"custom\" header,\nAngularjs  asks the server if it supports this header.\nSo that, It sends OPTIONS http call to requested address with \"Allow-Control-Request-Headers\". The server should response with \"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\"  header and with correct \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\" header.\nAngularjs then sends the call with custom header if and only if it gets valid result (200 OK) from OPTIONS call.\nI've implemented the CORS filter with  Access-Control-Allow-Headers and it worked!\n. It may be browser strategy but this tool should directly process the request. Chrome extension \"Advanced REST client\" can directly sent the request without OPTIONS. I think somehow you can handle this with advanced coding.\nThe CORS info is below for java/jersey. You should also register \"ResponseCORSFilter\" on the application or web.xml\n``` java\npackage org.quran.qurantools.core;\nimport org.glassfish.jersey.server.ContainerRequest;\nimport org.glassfish.jersey.server.ContainerResponse;\nimport javax.ws.rs.container.ContainerRequestContext;\nimport javax.ws.rs.container.ContainerResponseContext;\nimport javax.ws.rs.container.ContainerResponseFilter;\nimport javax.ws.rs.core.Response;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n/\n * Created by kurtulus on 05/02/15.\n /\npublic class ResponseCORSFilter implements ContainerResponseFilter {\n    @Override\n    public void filter(ContainerRequestContext containerRequestContext, ContainerResponseContext contResp) throws IOException {\n        contResp.getHeaders().add(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"\");\n        contResp.getHeaders().add(\"Access-Control-Allow-Methods\", \"GET, POST, OPTIONS\");\n        contResp.getHeaders().add(\"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\", \"access_token\");\n    }\n}\n```\n.

The problem is (aside from the fact that you have to have those $refs here and there, which is not too bad), that these fields are endpoint-specific and not global like security fields. In other words, user has to always redefine these fields when doing test requests, even when they would remain the same throughout the endpoints.\n.

    "tgrant59": "+1\n. Ah, its working now that i've changed to YAML. So what is the purpose of the useYamlBackend flag in the configuration if it always uses YAML regardless of the setting?\n. If that is true, why doesn't it work with JSON passed to it?\n. Some of these don't have to be performed on every character change, like checking for issues with the yaml. This can be made so that only when you stop typing for a few seconds it will parse the tree and try to render it. This would increase performance greatly, without even having to worry about web workers\n. Oh great! thanks for that link, I'll just modify the source for my purposes now to solve the problem\n. So modifying that delay does do something, but i'm still experiencing quite a big lag when typing.\n. Maybe allow for throttling of getCompletions in configuration, so only people who need it may enable it\n. ",
    "Russell-": "Thanks, Moshen, for the pointers.  I'll research.\nRussell\n. The best way to get to the bottom of this is to install the dist directory in a new folder below \"DocumentRoot\" of any web server, e.g. in a folder called swaggereditor.  Now press F12 in most browsers (e.g. Chrome, Firefox) so you can see the network traffic and then go to http://hostname/swaggereditor and you should see various 404s.  It would be best to try different operations to make sure all the 404s are fixed.\n. Yes, I understand I can change the example folder and that is what I did as I explained in my first post.  But there should be no need for someone to change that if they do not change the relative location of the example folder.  I'm copying the whole distribution without any modification.  The only difference is instead of putting the whole distribution under the root of the ApacheServer I'm creating a context called \"swaggereditor\" and putting  the whole distribution there.  That also results in the other 404's that are shown in red in my second image.  Those also do not use the context.  There may be other instances too.  I've not tried various functions to see what other 404s may also be caused.\n. That'll be great!  Thanks!\nPlease also look at the other two requests that are red / 404 in the second image.  I'm not sure how important they are for the editor to work correctly but the issue there is probably similar.  There may be other places where the same issue arises and it'll be nice for all of these to be addressed.  My initial post should be helpful to get these fixed, assuming you have Apache running.\n. My original title was \"dist needs to handle a context\".  However, mohsen1 changed that to \"Make examplesFolder path relative\".  That being the case I would not assume that what appears in the dist folder will work in any place other than at the root of the web-server.  As shown in my screen capture there are various other items which are not found even when I worked around the examples issue.  baruhap, I ended up putting it at the root level by creating a virtual host.\n.

So just got through it again, I am totally wrong. I must have assumed that for operations, the parameters key is the same as for the general document but indeed, the spec says for operations this is different like you implemented it in the editor.\n(The Parameters object is meant to be a template for parameters)\n. Yes, thanks for clarification. Finally got the distinction of the definition objects at the root and the concrete usage.\n. ",
    "dannylevenson-ps": "Examining the network tab in Chrome makes it look like the response only contains the headers without any body.

There is a functiona already:\nUse _File => Paste json This validates your json string input and then puts the content into the editor as yaml. If you want it back to json format just download it as json file as webron suggested.\nIs that what you were looking for?\n. Does not seem to be a duplicate #1078 for me. That's a feature request which suggest so implement a conversion from json format to yaml format which already exists in \"import json\" feature.\nI had the same issue today with the editor release 2.10.4. Unlike the initial bug report I used YAML instead of JSON. I replaced a YAML definition with another (bigger) YAML definition and I still see the old models in the preview window together with the current models.\nI suggest to reopen this issue.\n. +1\nIt can be reproduced on both swagger.io editor and ui with the following Spec:\nhttps://forge.etsi.org/rep/gitweb.cgi/NFV-SOL002-SOL003.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/src/SOL003/VNFLifecycleManagement/VNFLifecycleManagement.yaml\nIf I understand correctly the loader within Swagger-UI should be configured with the right value of basePath by the Editor. \nMaybe this could be done using the loaded url and stripping of the latest segment?.

Hi,\nNo news... \n@webron @fehguy can you please review @mohsen1 proposal ?\nThanks.\n. Hi @saharj ,\nThe #1000 fix does not address really this initial request of this issue...\nBut, if I understand all, support of reusable fragments separated from pure and complete Swagger 2.0 document is abandonned...\nIf so, reject this enahancement request.\n. You'll will then face a render problem on swagger-ui (if you use...) as only 'application/json' examples are rendered...\nI shoud have open a swagger-ui issue but didn't take time to... in my case, we have 'application/hal+json' production, I modified ui to support this content type and the JSON stringification for good rendering.\n. +1 !!\n.

    "jmccaffrey": "glad I found this ticket. \nI was having an issue when trying to load a swagger.json file from localhost, entering the url and trying to uncheck the CORS checkbox, and it would never load properly. \nNow that I see I can use this url to get it loaded without the proxy, I'm back in business. http://editor.swagger.io/#/?no-proxy&import=http://localhost:3000/api/json/swagger.json\nThanks for making an awesome thing awesomer!\n. ",
    "saharj": "This issue seems to be fixed.\n. Please build from master and try again. If issue persists, let us know.\n. Yes it is a bug in json editor dependency. You probably go around it by setting a defeult value to 0 or false. \n. Now you can use --production to start the server in production mode.\n. #1000 will fix this. Please check it out. \n. That's correct. With that change you can edit Swagger files that uses fragments that are referenced with a relative path such as './foo.yaml' but it will not be able to edit those fragments. \nEditing the fragments is not completely out of scope of this project so i will keep this issue open. Although I dont know how we can allow such thing at the moment.\n. I guess this issue has been fixed now. Would anyone take a moment and test it please?\n. This is a dependency issue: https://github.com/jdorn/json-editor/issues/406\n. Moving it to next milestone.\n. This issue should be fixed now. We have web workers that take the load off the main thread.\n. Seems like this issue has been fixed. Please let me know if you still have this issue.\n. Sorry but we have no plans to do this. \nIf you're interested, you can make a static Swagger documents renderer using this project's HTML/CSS in Swagger Code-Gen Project, then Swagger Editor will show it in Generate Client section. \n. It should be fixed by #1141 . Please let us know if you still face the issue.. This is a duplicate of #805.\n. Duplicate of #743 \n. This commit will fix this issue. \n0fd38f27e9f67df740f43bb849dc363188e97c03\nPlease build from master and try it and let me know if you still have this problem. \n. Duplicate of #805 \n. This issue was fixed here: #706\nPlease try it out again and let us know if there is any issue.\n. @tommyjcarpenter This is a code-gen issue. \n. @tommyjcarpenter No worries.\n. I can not reproduce this. Could you please try again and let me know?\n. Swagger Editor is a static application and can be integrated in any server. You can read more about this here.\n. The problem is that this code will break cross origin calls. We might be able to add it if the call is not cross origin.\n. My bad, withCredentials is useful only for CORS calls. If this pull request limits adding withCredentials only when isCrossOrigin() is  true, then I will merge this pull request (or a new one that does it). \n. That's right, and it's because it uses a ng-if. The problem can be solved by using ng-show or ng-hide, but this way we'll have much more HTML elements that slow downs the app, so it is better to keep the code as it is now.\n. Hi, \nThat's probably a network issue. I'm not sure if it's related to Swagger Editor itself. If you are still experiencing this issue, please let us know.\n. Swagger Editor only supports Swagger version 2.\n. For multiline strings in YAML you need to use a pipe (|).\nHere is the example:\n```\ndescription: |\n            First paragraph of description.\n        Second paragraph of description\n\n```\n. This works fine for me. This is my code:\nswagger: '2.0'\ninfo:\n  version: 0.0.0\n  title: Simple API\npaths:\n  /:\n    get:\n      parameters:\n        - name: velocity\n          in: query\n          description: minimum velocity of trends\n          required: false\n          type: number\n          format: float\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: ok\n\n. This is a dependency issue with json-refs.\nhttps://github.com/whitlockjc/json-refs/issues/68\n. I don't see any issue here with the default. Do you still have it?\n. What do you think about this @fehguy? Are we adding this to codegen?\n. I can't reproduce this.\n. Glad you figured it out.\n. Fixed #780 \n. Do you still have this issue? We just recently updated Sway\n. @fehguy How should a relative URL like this \"./schema/response-status.schema\" be resolved. As of now, the URL gets added to the swagger.io URL.\n. According to @fehguy we can not resolve relative paths in Swagger Editor.\n. Do you still have this issue? I can not reproduce it.\n. The thing is that in Swagger schema, the type of version has to be a string, and when you put 0.1 in front of version, YAML sees it as a number. That's why you get an error.\nThe second . makes it clear for YAML that the value of version is not a number.\n. Can you try it on master to see if the problem still exists? I can not reproduce it.\n. - When you use a pipe, all the object becomes a multiline string.\n- By design swagger does not check the response schema with examples. If you want to go into more details see here.\n\n. It\u2019s the Swagger schema\u00a0that is not enforcing it. @webron what do you think of this?\n. I am not able to reproduce this.\n. I can not reproduce this issue anymore. Does anyone still get the error?\n. Thank you @Herst , I am able to reproduce it now. The key is to press Ctrl-A and Ctrl-V keys very quickly.\nI'll look into this issue.\n. I'm not able to reproduce this issue, I need precise steps.\n. I'm going to close this issue for now. If you see the bug again, please let us know and we'll reopen the issue. \nIt would be helpful to have precise steps to reproduce the issue.\n. @takahashiyuya Can you please tell us how you get the issue? I am unable to reproduce this\n. @nhhockeyplayer Thanks for the comment. I opened an issue to fix this.\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/803\n. I just tried the latest master in Windows 10. Down in dependencies there are two modules that can not compile in Windows:\n- bufferutil\n- utf8-validate\nSince both of them are dependencies of dependencies we can't really update them right now. Last time I updated dependencies (#803) did not resolve this issue. \nMoving it to the next milestone. For now please use compiled version from the releases page or use a Linux VM to compile it.\n. As you linked, this is an issue or feature request for Swagger schema.\n. That's an invalid YAML, I'm not sure if we should allow importing that.\n. Would you please check it and let us know if you still have this issue?\n. This is possibly fixed by my pull request #750, also see #697.\nIf you can, please try it on master and let us know if it's fixed.\n. Due to no response, I'm closing this issue. If you still have this problem let us know, and I'll open this issue.\n. @whitlockjc This is a Sway issue I guess. As far as I know it has been fixed from our side.\n. This issue is fixed and will be available on the next deployment.\nSee #674, #698, #652 and this.\n. I'm working on this.\n. Yes this is a bug. I just confirmed it.\n. This is a dependency issue. An issue is opened.\n. This issue seems to be fixed. Is anyone still has this issue?\n. This is not inline with Swagger Editor goals. Feel free to fork and make your own module.\n. Neither in online swagger, nor on master I could reproduce this. Here is my swagger:\nyaml\nswagger: '2.0'\ninfo:\n  version: 0.0.0\n  title: Simple API\npaths:\n  /:\n    get:\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: OK\n          schema: \n            $ref: \"#/definitions/Cat\"\ndefinitions:\n  Animal:\n    type: object\n    discriminator: petType\n    properties:\n      commonName:\n        type: string\n  Cat:\n    allOf:\n      - $ref: '#/definitions/Animal'\n      - type: object\n        properties:\n          isFurry:\n            type: boolean\n            default: false\nYou probably didn't use the schema.\n. Here is my understanding about this:\nCat is using Animal, the schema is referring to Animal, too. So there is nothing that uses Cat (Animal doesn't use Cat). In this case, the warning is valid. \nAm I missing something?\n. As you reported, it is a dependency issue. https://github.com/mohsen1/angular-json-schema-form/issues/7\n. Yes, this issue had happened because sway has changed its API (https://github.com/apigee-127/sway/issues/59) and sway-worker was working with the old API. The issue is fixed on the new version of sway-worker.\nI made a pull request to fix this.\n. @MrWhiski Please make sure you are using the latest version of Swagger Editor, and then let us know if you still have this issue.\n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#1932\n. This should be fixed now in #750 \n. @vnalla It is fixed on master\n. How does it look to you @fehguy ?\n. @fehguy Looks good to me if you want to merge.\n. @fehguy Please review. Looks good to me\n. Duplicate of #743 \n. I could not reproduce this issue. Everything looks good to me.\nHere is my code and the preview: \n\n. I have updated sway-worker recently. Can you try with the latest and let me know?\n. With webpack build system this issue should have been fixed.\n. It is building successfully in Travis CI. It is possibly your environment. Make sure you have all requirements like latest Node.js\n. As of now, try operation does not support XML.\nWhat exactly do you expect with this swagger?\n. This issue has been fixed in this pull request: #787 \n. This issue was fixed here. I just deployed it to editor.swagger.io/\n. I can not reproduce this. Can you please provide a full swagger?\n. It seems like this issue has been fixed\n. I can not reproduce this issue. Can you please try again to see if you still see this?\n. It does work on my machine. \n\n. I can not reproduce this issue. Maybe you are using an old version of Swagger Editor.\n. My bad! There is an error.\n. I just made a PR to fix this.\n. @SEWilco This issue has been fixed and will be published on next release very soon.\n. Seems like this issue is fixed, so I'm closing it. Please leave a comment if you thin this should stay open.\n. It's a duplicate of #743 \n. From what I can tell, the link you sent is not a swagger file. Can please explain more?\n. @webron I think you can help with this\n. It seem like a duplicate of #807 \n. This is a jQuery thing and we have no control over it.\n. It seems that the font is correct.\n. @IvanGoncharov The font size and style of tables and lists in the Swagger Editor are supposed to be like this.\n. @IvanGoncharov We are using Github style and the view you get is matching the style.\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/app/styles/markdown.less\n. #849 Will fix this\n. Thank you for this pull request. As discussed before, Swagger Editor's goal is to be an editor not a preview tool. We decided not to merge this.\n. Thank you for the pull request. We decided to not merge it.\n. Yes, code folding data is stored in memory not in local storage. We can move it to local storage at some point. \n. This issue should be fixed by #726 #780. Please let me know if you can reproduce it in master. \n. This issue has been fixed on master and it will be fixed on the new release soon.\n. Have you tried deleting your node_modules folder and trying npm start again? \nIf you are looking to build Swagger Editor you can use the latest build from releases directly \n. We never had XML body preview. We can add this feature for sure. \n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#2315\n. Duplicate of #704 \n. You have a typo in line 179: Your definition has 3 s! s/Messsage/Message\n. Different ports are different domains. This is expected behavior.\n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#2430\n. This is result of Sway upgrade. @whitlockjc is this a bug in Sway?\nIn #849 we will depend on Sway directly.\n. @reece & @ralfhandl I guess this issue has been fixed now. Would you please take a moment and see if you still have the same problem on master?\n. @ralfhandl Awesome!\nI made a  new PR to fix the issue here.\n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#2429\n. Works flawlessly on Windows:  \ud83c\udf89 \n\n. Thank you. We will look at this\n. I have made a new PR, hopefully it will fix this issue. \n. Do you still have this issue?\n. Please try again. This should be fixed now. \n. Possibly we haven't updated sway api in backend service\n. The options.definition must be either an object or a string error was from a discrepancy in API calls to Sway. It should be fixed now. Please let me know if you still have this issue. \n. @amritgre did you build after getting the latest? Also I recommend you don't build from source and use the published version either from npm or Docker. \n. @amritgre Can you please give us more details about the error you are getting? And a sample project that produces the error?\n. I'm working on a new PR that may fix this issue.\n. We have recently updated the build system. Would you please try again to see if you still have the same problem?\n. I can not reproduce this issue. Can you give us the full swagger code?\n. This is a duplicate of #733 \n. Can you try building from master?\n. Duplicate of #864\n. There will be a new update soon that may fix your issue\n. We have updated the build system. Would you please try again and see if you still have the same problem?\n. @prestonvanloon It is possible that nginx is running in your 8080 port. Please try another port and see if your issue gets fixed.\n. It has peen fixed.\n. Yes, that's a bug. I'm working on it.\n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-node#365\n. This is a Sway issue.\n. f4c3237253e813a56f954249b792dd4771c1bcb9 will improve the error pointer a little but at its core this is an issue with yaml-js.\n. Thank you for spotting this.\n. Thank you!\n. @fehguy Are we going to support < IE 9 ?\n. Files that are running in web workers are these: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/tree/master/scripts/workers\nI'm not sure how to run them outside of web workers. They are using web workers APIs. \n. We have realized that there is a problem with twitter.yaml example. Do you have this issue with other example files as well?\n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#2680\n. Have you tried turning off autocomplete and live preview in preferences menu?\n. Thank you!\n. Swagger Editor gets the title from either the title in schema or the name of your schema defined in definitions section. You just need to add a title to have a similar result.\n```\nswagger: '2.0'\ninfo:\n  version: 0.0.0\n  title: Simple API\npaths:\n  /:\n    get:\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: OK\n          schema:\n            $ref: '#/definitions/profile'\ndefinitions:\n  profile:\n    title: Profile\n``\n. Duplicate of #899\n. Everything seems to work fine. The problem can be from your machine.\n. Your spec is invalid, and the error message is right.\n@webron can you help with this?\n. I have no idea why that's happening. Please read the README.md file and follow the instructions.\n. You need to build from master. After you clone the Swagger Editor, you need to runnpm installand thennpm start`.\n. I can't reproduce this issue. \nTry this and let me know if this worked \nnpm install -g http-server\nwget https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/releases/download/v2.10.1/swagger-editor.zip\nunzip swagger-editor.zip\nhttp-server swagger-editor\n. If you don't have the dist folder already, you just need to run npm install and npm run build to generate the dist folder.\n. After you run npm install you need to run npm run build to get the dist folder.\n. There is nothing strange in your output file. That's webpack logs. After that output you should have a working dist folder. \n. Your dist folder looks good. What is the problem exactly?\n. Your AJAX preflight is failing. It's probably your API that causes the issue.\n. Check out this module: https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-editor-server\n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#2729\n. This is probably a codegene issue. Please provide your swagger document. I'm moving it to swagger-codegen.\n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#2730\n. I can't reproduce this issue. Can you build from master and try again?\n. In Swagger Editor when you import, it simply makes a Get request, and there is no way to change that. Maybe you can pass a token in the query parameter.\n. Reported the dependency issue here: https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-layout/issues/209\n. This seems to be fixed now. \n. I tried the code and everything looks fine.\n\nAm I missing something?\n. Ok, I figured out what the problem is. When you are using a $ref, it should'n have a sibling, otherwise you'll get a warning (it's weird that I didn't!). That's because when there is a $ref, everything (including $ref itself) will be replaced with the result of what that $ref is pointing to. So if you put siblings next to a $ref, they will not appear because resolver replaces it.\n. Would you please provide more information? I can't reproduce the issue.\n. I'm closing this issue due to no response. \n. This looks good. Can you rebase off master so tests pass? \n. I'm working on this.\n. We will release the v2.10.0 very soon. Until then you can build directly from master.\n. Could you please paste your swagger here?\n. I wasn't able to reproduce this issue on Chrome or on Firefox.\n. This might be a Sway issue. You can open a new issue here: https://github.com/apigee-127/sway\n. @fehguy I'm looking to release  2.10.0\n. @fehguy With this PR, TrivisCI will deploy whenever we push a new tag.\n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#2813\n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#2814\n. I don't get it. When you click on List all operations, all operations get folded and you won't be able to see or use the button. So how do you go from step 2 to 3? \n. I don't see this issue. Please make sure you build from master.\n. I still am not able to reproduce this issue, so I'm going to close it. Please feel free to let us know if you still have this problem\n. This has been discussed before. We decided to not do that. See #664 \n. With    5408972 there will be only fonts that suffer from issue. That's an issue in Webpack's file-loader module which is reported here https://github.com/webpack/file-loader/issues/62\n. I've reverted 5408972 but this doesn't mean we will not fix this in the next release. We need to fix it properly. \n. It can be CORS issues. Please read here: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/docs/cors.md\n. PORT is a standard environment variable used in many places. I don\u2019t see why this is helpful.\n. To avoid collisions you can start a subshell and set PORT environment variable in it. \nFor example:\n$ (export PORT=8123 && npm start)\n. Maybe this is what you're looking for: https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-editor-open\n. After you open http://editor.swagger.io/#/, you can import a file or an URL using the File tab.\n. Also if you're using import query parameter for accessing a private file you should provide no-proxy argument to avoid our CORS proxy server. \n. Yes, Swagger Editor is not able to get the information from private repositories.\n. Cookie is just a header. You can define a header parameter for it. \n. Do you still have this issue?\n. It's possible that codegen server was down at that moment. Please let me know if you're still having this issue. \n. Please provide your Swagger that produces this issue. \n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#2918\n. You can use iframe for that.\n. @fehguy It should build on new tags.\n. I could not reproduce it. Do you still have this issue?\n. Closing this issue due to no response.\n. @dolmen please follow this issue here: https://github.com/whitlockjc/json-refs/issues/86\n. @nodo If you git clone the repository, you have to build it first.\n. Duplicate of #890 \n. This issue was moved to apigee-127/sway#84\n. Could you please provide your swagger and your expected url?\n. Please help me understand this.\nThe URL I get is http://example.com/test?id=abc#def. Does the format have to be http://example.com/test?id=abc%23def?\n. I am going to close this issue. Please let us know if you still have this issue and you think this should stay open.\n. Your body parameter schema is an object, and Swagger Editor is showing it correctly. It should not have brackets around, when the schema in not an array.\nIf you want to have an array of Person objects you can use type:array and set items: to the Person.\n. This is what I get:\n\nWhat do you expect to see?\n. In the code below: \nauthor:\n        readOnly: true\n        $ref: '#/definitions/UserObject'\nwhen you use a $ref, its result overrides everything in author: so the readOnly won't work.\n. I realized that the UserObject already has the readOnly: true, so the code works fine (with no warnings) when you remove this line from author.\nOn the other hand, I noticed that on line 124, you have required: [\"lat\", \"lng\"], so the code will ask you to give these information. Check if you can remove this line.\n. This is making the test fail in TravisCI. Do you want to revise it? \n. This project is not using gulp. \n. This project is using Webpack.\n. Can you try again? Maybe GitHub had issues at that moment. Source Code Pro is downloaded from GitHub during the build process. \n. Closing this issue due to no response.\n. Apparently discriminator is not supported by Swagger yet. \nhttps://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/issues/333\n@fehguy am I correct? \n. As I mentioned earlier, we are not using gulp in this project.\nIn order to generate the dist file, after you clone the repository, you need to run npm run build in the command line.\n. Also, we don't know much about gulp. If you want a good answer for your question, maybe it's better to ask it somewhere else like stackoverflow.com.\n. The development server is a Node.js process. Depending on your OS you can kill that process fairly easily. \n. What you're trying to do is not possible with editor. You might be able to achieve this using a Node.js program that resolves Swagger the way you want it. \n. We're using Sway which uses JSON Refs for resolving JSON Pointers. JSON Refs is using Path Loader for loading URLs.\n~~Path loader has PrepareRequestCallback option that allows us to override the request location. With that I thought we can replace the request location based on an option set by Swagger Editor user.~~\nJSON Refs provide relativeBase option which is a shortcut for what I described above\nIf we override origin and base path for each request in PrepareRequestCallback during resolution of $refs we will have a working remote resolver. Even if a remote JSON Pointer result have another $ref that points to another relative remote JSON Pointer.\nHere is an example:\nindex.swagger.yaml\nyaml\nroot:\n  $ref: './a.yaml'\na.yaml\nyaml\na: \n  $ref: '../b.yaml'\nb.yaml\nyaml\nfoo: bar\nLets say index.swagger.yaml is located at example.com/swaggers/my-swagger/index.swagger.yaml but we're trying to edit it in Swagger Editor, so we copy the contents to Swagger Editor and tell Swagger Editor to resolve all $refs from example.com/swaggers/my-swagger base. \n- a.yaml will get requested to editor.swagger.io/a.yaml but we override the base with example.com/swaggers/my-swagger and it resolves fine\n- b.yaml will get requested to editor.swagger.io/../a.yaml but we override the base with example.com/swaggers/my-swagger and resolve it to example.com/swaggers/my-swagge/../b.yaml and it will resolve fine as well.\nMy plan is to add an option to preferences for the base URL of resolving $refs and use that in $ref resolution. \n. @pgtelus @dolmen @RodH257 please checkout my branch at #1000 and let me know if it works for you.\n. You can try this feature in http://editor.swagger.io now\n. It's possible that your server (zxing.org) is not allowing such request. Please read here for more information.\n. @trifwnas I have made some improvements with file parameters. Would you please check to see if this issue is fixed?\n. @sjaensch is your problem solved? \n. Please follow all the steps provided here and then let us know if you still get the error.\n. I assume this has fixed the error, so I'm going to close this issue.\n. The reason is that json-schema-view-js is way faster than the other project. We are hoping that @mohsen1 will include allOf to this project as well, in the near future.\n. Descriptions can only be on the root \u201ctags\u201d entry. In operation level it can not have description.\n. We are using marked markdown renderer. I'm not sure if that has an option to allow that. I'll take a look. \n. You're right. It's because we\u2018re embedding fonts in the CSS file. We will consider improving it later.\n. @brylie we know it's important but there is a bug in webpack file loader still open. That issue needs to be fixed before we take any action toward fixing this issue. \n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#3315\n. Thanks for reporting. \nTry operation and file uploads have some bugs. I think we should refactor the file upload piece. \n. I have made some improvements in file parameters. Please check to see if it has fixed this issue. Thanks! \n. I assume your question was answered @ChriWiChris. I'm going to close this issue for now. Feel free to reopen it if you think otherwise.\n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-node#406\n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#3381\n. This is the result of this change in JSON Refs.\nIt used to resolve circular dependencies until a few levels that was working in editor unless you dig in really deep. \nThen it was changed to resolving to empty object which break previous behavior and now it resolves to {circular: true} that to our renderer doesn't mean anything.\nIf we can get back the original behavior (resolving up to n levels) or at least have that as an option in JSON Refs, we can't do much.\n/cc @whitlockjc \n. Follow this issue here: https://github.com/whitlockjc/json-refs/issues/91\n. @webron can you help? \n. Can you try again? I just tested 2.10.3 again to make sure it's correct. It should work fine.\n. There is not set size limit. If your Swagger is really large it will make the app slow and sometime it breaks the app. See the Instagram or Twitter examples as large file examples. \n. Follow this issue here: https://github.com/whitlockjc/json-refs/issues/91\n. Tryoperation has some bugs, specially with file uploads. Maybe we should refactor it. \n. Try Operation is the component you see after you click on Try this operation.\n. This PR may has fixed this issue.\n. This issue should be fixed with the latest PR #1141 . Please let us know if you still see the issue.. It seems like maybe the npm install didn't work properly. Try to install again, and hopefully it will work this time.\n. You can use iframe for it. You can read more here for hooking to editor events.\n. I'm not sure what the problem is. Try http-server -p with some other port. Maybe this will fix your problem.\n. Yes. This is an issue with Ace syntax highlighting\n. Yes, we are aware of this issue. The problem is that selecting the twitter example shows the petstore example in the preview.\n. This is not supported with Sway.\n. Yes, please open an issue in Sway repo and link it here. \n. bundle.js:169 Failed to load defaults.json from /index.html/config/defaults.json(anonymous function)\nWhen you visit the editor path, your server should not add index.html to path. That's the problem. \n. Please see #664 \n. Closing this due to no update. The worker we've is simply a wrapper around yaml-js and js-yaml. It's very specific to this project. \n. If you are using the config object you can't disable it but you can always remove the code if you have a clone. \nWe need to disable GA when the value for analytics is null.\n. There is a npm script for pushing to gh-pages branch:\nnpm run gh-pages\nThat should build and deploy to GitHub Pages.\n. Can you provide more details? Are you trying to modify Swagger Editor code base?\n. This is a Codegene issue. let me move your issue there.\n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#3537\n. Maybe we can have an \"Edit\" menu for basic stuff like this but I'm afraid this is a developer tool! \n. I looked into it and here is what's happening:\nSwagger Editor uses the key in definitions object for JSON Schemas with no title. If you provide a title for your JSON Schema that title will be used. \n- Definition A refers to a definition that has no title so the key in the definitions object (\"string-ref\") is used\n- Definition B is result of merger of two JSON Schemas. One the referred one and the other one has the title B. When we merge allOf, the later wins so \"B\" becomes the title\n- Definitions C is not having a title property so we're using the key in definitions \nAll of this is expected behavior and I don't think it's a bug.\n. This is probably a bug in JSON schema. cc @webron \n. I'm not sure if I understand this issue correctly.\nI've added a recursive allOf resolution method see here. Maybe it's that service that doesn't resolve this specific case correctly .\n. In definitions/body-bad/p2, the second item of allOf is a schema with just a title, so Swagger shows it as a schema with just a title. This is an invalid issue.\n. It seems like this issue is fixed now.\n. @centromere This is what I get on editor.swagger.io\n\nAm I missing something?\n. I still don't see any problem. Are you running locally?\n. @centromere I'm not able to reproduce this issue. Maybe you would like to take a look on the URL builder test and let us know which part is not working well.\n. @webron I don't know the swagger specs very well. Can you please tell me what is the problem in this test? https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/test/unit/spec/controllers/tryoperation/generateUrl.js#L340\nShould we add or change anything?\nAccording to my research, there are three ways encoding an array. Which on is recommended by Swagger? \n- ?id[]=1&id[]=2\n- ?id=1&id=2\n- ?id=1,2\n. Sorry but this is an invalid request. Amazon S3 decided to add index.html to the path, and there is nothing that we can do about it.\n. Thanks for the fix!\n. Please clear up your localStorage and then try again. This may solve the issue.\n. This sounds good. Thanks for the work. However, the \"disable sync between editor and preview for folding paths and operations\" part seems not working. Maybe you want to fix this before we take any further action.\n. Try this:\nLeave the box checked, which means the fold/unfolding is synced between editor and preview panel. Now fold one of the paths in preview. There will be no change in the editor panel.\n. Here is a better picture of what is happening when the Editor Folding is checked/unchecked.\n(https://gfycat.com/EdiblePoshBarebirdbat)\nUnfortunately I wasn't able to upload the whole video here. Basically what I was trying to show was that it does not matter if the box is checked or unchecked, the code would do the same either way.\nAlso, in reference to your last comment, in order to disable the syncing, the Editor Folding should be checked.\nWe would be happy to merge this PR whenever this issue is fixed.\n. Thanks for your work, but we can\u2019t merge this. Vendor extensions are not part of Swagger standard.\n. Looks like a duplicate of #542\n. Yes, this is a known issue with json-refs dependency. Please see this issue: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/1005#issuecomment-232859440\n. Follow this issue here: https://github.com/whitlockjc/json-refs/issues/91\n. Originally from here\n. Do you mean this search box?\n\nI can't reproduce it on Chrome. Can you give me more details please?\n. @webron maybe you can help with this.\n. I just fixed this in https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/commit/4f1bd208e5af1e5810c4d7360d4fc2ac11a2069d\n. We discussed this in https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/991\nIt's not an easy fix because we want Swagger Editor work from any path in a server so all of it's resources should have relative paths. Configuring webpack to do that is something I wasn't able to do because of this bug: https://github.com/webpack/file-loader/issues/62\n. Unfortunately the answer is \"No\". Swagger editor is a client side only app and it does not care about the server status. \n. You probably have a typo or bad schema in one of your schemas. From what you gave us, it looks okay. \nI made this simple Swagger from your snippet and it works:\n``` yaml\nswagger: '2.0'\ninfo:\n  version: 0.0.0\n  title: Simple API\npaths:\n  /:\n    get:\n      responses:\n        200:\n          $ref: \"#/responses/200\"\nresponses:\n        '200':\n          description: OK\n          schema:\n            type: object\n            properties:\n              _id:\n                $ref: '#/definitions/Id'\n              _links:\n                type: object\n                properties:\n                  curies:\n                    $ref: '#/definitions/Curies'\n                  self:\n                    $ref: '#/definitions/Self'\n              name:\n                type: string\n                description: The name of the category.\ndefinitions:\n  Id:\n    type: string\n  Curies:\n    type: string\n  Self:\n    type: string\n. Thank you for the change!\n. This is an issue with Ace. You can follow the issue [here](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/issues/3027) .\n. We suggest iFrame as editor has a router. However if you would like to do it differently, you can look into [app.js](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/scripts/app.js) file. \n. @cmhakkim Your YAML is not valid. Changing the `Awol` inside the `definition` will fix your problem. See below:\nAwol:\n    type: object\n    allOf:\n      - $ref: \"#/definitions/Foo\"\n      - $ref: \"#/definitions/Bar\"\n    properties:\n      xxx:\n        type: string\n        format: date\n      yyy:\n        type: integer\n      zzz:\n        type: boolean\n    required:\n      - xxx\n``. The problem is that you have defined atypeforin: bodyinstead ofschema`. You can either change the parameters to:\nparameters:\n        - name: task \n          in: body\n          description: task object\n          required: true\n          schema: \n           type: string\nor change the in: body to in: formData if that works for you.\n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#3884\n. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#3885\n. I know nothing about Docker. If you'd like to make a PR, it's much appreciated.\n@fehguy what do you think about this?\n. @nikmash There will be a new release soon.\n. We have now published a new release.\n. By design, the schema does not enforce to have an(/a correct) example.\n. As you can see in TravisCI everything is passing in master. I guess your npm installation didn't work well.\nTry removing your node_modules folder and starting over.\n. Instead of adding them both, use allOf.\n```\ndpf_templates:\n  type:\n    allOf:\n      - $ref: '#/definitions/Dpf_template_VCF'\n      - $ref: '#/definitions/Dpf_template_Json'\ndefinitions:\n  Dpf_template_VCF:\nDpf_template_Json:\n```\n. This is probably a CORS issue.\n. @neolf Thanks for your effort, but it is done in a Web Worker. See here and here.\nAlso you have made 2 PRs for the same code.\n. Duplicate!. The editor is intended for YAML editing. If you use File => Past JSON, instead of directly pasting JSON into the editor, you will not have any problem\n. Looks like a duplicate of #1078\n. Fixed\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/releases/download/v2.10.4/swagger-editor.zip\n. I just fixed that. Thanks for reporting. \n. Can someone run npm install --verbose and paste the result here? \n. I don't see this issue. Please try to remove the node_module and then npm install and npm start. This may solve your issue. Please let me know if you still have see this issue\n. Sorry for the late response. Did you follow all the steps that are mentioned here?\n. Would you please tell what you expect to see and what you get instead?\n. @Kitanotori It seems this issue is somehow related to another one, so I'm going to close this. You can follow more about the issue there.\n. Do you type the # or does the editor put it in the URL?. @hsgreen This is what I see in the Try Operation section. \n\nAnd the security option is obviously there.\n. @hsgreen Did you Authenticate?. Seems like a duplicate of #807. Should we reopen the issue?\n. Closing due to no responce. This is a JSON Schema View issue.. This issue was moved to mohsen1/json-schema-view-js#13. Do you still have this issue?. Duplicate of #853 . Can you give us an example please?. Can you help me reproducing the issue? . This looks like a normal behavior. For example see the Instagram API. Although, I'm not sure why it shows 1 in front of Data. To update the Try Operation section, you need to close and reopen it.. I'm not sure if we are planning to implement this feature. What do you think @webron ?. We are using Unix commands in npm run clean to delete dist folder. We should use something that works in windows too. this is a good solution. \nPR is welcome! . This issue exists, and we don't yet know what causes it. Please make sure you clean your cache and local storage and try again. Unfortunately, I'm not able to reproduce the issue. Please clean up your cache and local storage and try again.. The best way to have multiple line description in Swagger is to follow the example below.\n```\nswagger: '2.0'\ninfo:\n  version: 0.0.0\n  title: Simple API\npaths:\n  /:\n    get:\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: |\n            This is the first line\n        And this is the second line\n\n``. @grosch Sorry for any inconvenience. Until we fix the issue, please clean your local storage and cache, and try again. . I'd forgot to update the github pages. @Karayel please try again. It should work now.. It's fixed now.. This issue should be fixed now.. Thanks for you participation. This documentation is for production, and we don't want to run the dev server for production. I'm guessing that you are mixing this up with https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/README.md. Sorry for the mistake. It should be fixed now. Please try downloading again.. Duplicate of #472 . The issue is fixed now.. This not a constructor. Specify the return type value (function returns debounced unchanged function) \n. Indentation and multiline\n. We can't have absolute paths for assets. publicPath query is interesting. Maybe it works if value is justdist/. I have to try.\n. This should be a security not a header param\n. we had|` to show some of the YAML features in the default example. \n. Don't add extra quotes \n. Why you removed the format? if it's different, please update it instead \n. ",

    "mbeko": "I think the Apache configuration is alright since it works this way with the other web apps (Redmine, Jenkins etc.) on the server. The main difference is that in those apps I can configure a base path, so for Swagger Editor, it would be something like base = \"swagger-editor\".\nThis way, all relative URLs could use that value in front of them to address the resources correctly, e.g. ${base}/images/favicon-16x16.png.\nAnyway, thank you for the hint with the online editor, maybe I can manage to find and replace all relative paths. It would be a nice feature to have a central configuration for this as it is common in web apps, but I'm not sure if I can provide a pull request because I don't have much experience with Javascript development.\n. Thanks! I hope I can ignore the requests to http://generator.swagger.io, otherwise I found these prefixes in the online editor:\n- styles\n- scripts\n- config\n- images\nTomorrow I'll try to search for these in all files in the dist folder and add the base path.\n. Alright, it seems to work now except for the URL being strangely rewritten to http://${host name}/swagger-editor#/.\nThere were more prefixes to change, all in all these are:\n- styles\n- scripts\n- config\n- images\n- templates\n- spec-files\n- bower_components\n- views\nI had to modify the following files:\n- index.html\n- scripts/317074e0.scripts.js\n- styles/6b0dfbac.main.css\n- templates/operation.html\n- views/main.html\n- views/preview/preview.html\n- views/header/header.html\nCould you point me to how you would go about making a central option for this? Which config file would best contain this option and how would you replace the variable in all those files with the actual value? With some general orientation, I could implement that, I guess.\n. Have you used a reverse proxy adding a base path after the domain name in those other servers? This is where the problems start with Apache.\nAs I mentioned, the Apache config works with other popular web apps and they all provide a central configuration, so one doesn't have to tediously debug, find and replace. And apparently adapting the URLs is fixing the problem, I'd only like to make it more convenient.\nAlso, this feature would help me a lot while it wouldn't disturb other users who can leave the option by default as base = \"\".\nI don't expect anyone to implement this, I'd only welcome some general guidance because I'm not too familiar with the capabilities of Grunt etc. I imagine that it should be straightforward to read the variable value from a configuration and run a find-and-replace task after copying all to dist. I just hope you can tell me the best location of this configuration and the basic structure of such a task. Providing the right manual pages could be enough. Or is it not that easy?\n. Well, not really, still digging through Grunt documentation and plugins, but it's OK, then I'll have to do it on my own.\n. Thanks a lot for sharing your solution, @mudithae!\nIn the meantime, they started to release the editor as a set of static files to place in /var/www.

If you can give me an email address I'll send it to you, but I don't want to post it here, no.. @saharj That seems to have resolved the issue, thanks.. If you fix #1177 then I won't care about this one any longer :). @webron Clearing the cache, as someone suggested in #1177 worked, which lets me now download directly since it works well in Chrome.\n. @webron Really?  I assumed the editor WAS meant to be the documentation tool.  What should I be using instead?  I use the editor to get it looking right and then save the produced JSON to somewhere that swagger-ui reads.. It's much cleaner if you group by operation first, and then path.  Generally you know you want a POST or a GET for example, but might not be entirely sure of the path.  . Any ETA on this one?. The UI code is huge.  I'd have no idea where to even begin to look to figure out how to fix this myself :(\n. Once I make changes, how do I build it to test?\nCurious, why aren't any of the statements terminated with a ; character?  PhpStorm is so unhappy :). Well unfortunately I can't because the editor is the new one now, and I always just used the online one.\nBut basically if you just open up the default online editor, on the right-hand side there's a Schemes dropdown, then a horizontal line, and then all the methods group by tag.   There used to be a \"Collapse All\" type option between that horizontal line and groups of tag dropdown so that I could just collapse them all at once.\n. \nIn the middle there is \"List all operations\".  Clicking on that collapses all of the elements (like GET /products).  That's what I'm looking to get back into the new editor\n. \n. I mean whatever the things are called that I showed in the example :)\n. Seems pretty limiting.  Methods frequently will throw an exception for a number of reasons.  So I'm limited to just saying \"Something failed\"?  That's kinda bad.\n. Can you provide somewhere to upload it?  I don't want to post it here where it'd be public.\n. Email has been sent..

Will look into the 'swagger-generator` under swagger-codegen...\n. My bad. Fixed in https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/pull/1206\n. @mohsen1 FYI. We need to pull the latest master of swagger-codegen server and bounce the service in order to pick up the fix. (I do not have the right to do that)\n. @chitankensuru currently C# client does not support HTTP libraries other than RestSharp. Technically it should be possible to do so as we've done it with the Java API client, which supports Jersey1.x, Jersey2.x, okhttp, retrofit, retrofit2.\nPlease open a ticket here for tracking purpose.\n. Yes, that's a pre-requisite.\nWhen sunsetting the Android generator, I suggest we update the name of \"Android\" to something like\n\"Android (decommissioned, replaced by Java)\"\nso that users using Swagger Editor will have a better idea about the change.\n. For the change, I mean here: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/blob/master/modules/swagger-codegen/src/main/java/io/swagger/codegen/languages/AndroidClientCodegen.java#L79\n. What about retrieving the option only when someone clicks on the programming language in the dropdown menu? (For example, if I want to generate a Ruby API client, whether Java library supports 5 different HTTP libraries does not interest me)\n. Well I'm no expert in Angular either. I'm just making suggestions from the user's perspective :)\n. Not sure if the size of the JSON response that contains all the options returned by the new endpoint would be a concern given that it will return a lot more than just a list of programming languages supported by the generator (http://generator.swagger.io/api/gen/clients returns 493b only).\nSince you're the one who's making the change, we can go with your approach first and revise accordingly later based on user's feedback.\n. I prefer exposing all options so that the user is aware of different options available to customize the SDK.\nFor the format/def of the response data, I do not have a strong opinion on it as long as the data can be easily parsed by the front end (Swagger Editor in this case).\n. For Golang server and client generation, please try https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger.\n. FYI. swagger editor leverages swagger-codegen (https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) via https://generator.swagger.io to generate API client or server stub.\n. @MTUNNISSEN it's fixed in the latest release (2.1.5) of swagger codegen:\nSwaggerClient-php/lib/Configuration.php:        $this->accessToken = $accessToken;\nSwaggerClient-php/lib/Configuration.php:        return $this->accessToken;\ngenerater.swagger.io (used by editor for generating clients) may be still pending the update to 2.1.5.\n. @MTUNNISSEN np. Let us know if you've further question or any feedback at https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/issues\n. Yeah! I added those to hopefully better manage user's expectation.\n.

    "andylowry": "I'm not a fan of specifying where a fragment belongs in the root spec, within the fragment itself. If I'm reusing something in more than one root spec, I may want it to be accessed by different paths in those specs. Or if want to reference it more than once in a single spec, I'm forced to place it in some placeholder in the root spec and then use local refs where I want the fragment to appear.\nThe existing support for JSON refs seems adequate with the sole exception of not supporting the editing of fragments, and it avoids the issue of nailing down in the fragment where it belongs in any root spec that references it.\nSince the only limitation occurs during editing, it seems that comments are not required at all - merely an editor GUI option to state that the fragment is not a Swagger spec (and so should be treated as a plain JSON or YAML object by the editor). The editor could even be smart enough to offer, when it loads an object without swagger root property, to switch to non-swagger editing mode, or silently default to that and dynamically switch if a swagger root property is added. Or whatever...\n. @mohsen1  Makes sense re the automatic switch. Still it might be helpful to  have it offered when a syntactically valid object is loaded without  a 'swagger' root element. It would avoid the hassle and ugliness of  loading a non-swagger document and then putting up with the error  messages until the editing mode is manually switched.\n. @chris922 You might want to take a look at RepreZen API Studio. It includes a generator (\"GenTemplate\"in API Studio lingo) called \"Swagger Normalizer\" that can turn a multi-file swagger specification into an equivalent single file, suitable for software that does not deal well with multifile specifications.\nThere's a youtube video that talks more broadly about API Studio's support for multi-file swagger specifications.\n[Disclaimer: I work for RepreZen]. A few comments on motivation for this feature:\nSwagger specifically recommends model reuse through JSON references. However, it is currently difficult to do this in the editor, except in cases where the referenced models are hosted in the same domain as the editor itself.\nFor organizations aiming to promote internal reuse, same-domain is not much of a challenge. For developers hoping to reference models shared in external repositories (notably github), use of a CORS proxy may be the only viable approach.\n. ",

Should I open a separate issue for this?\n. @webron The definition of a Schema Object explicitly lists type among the properties that are \"taken directly from the JSON Schema definition and follow the same specifications\". This would include arrays of strings, see JSON Schema Validation, section 5.5.2.\nBoth Swagger UI and Swagger Editor gracefully handle array values for type.\nOnly for Parameter Objects other than body parameters the spec explicitly restricts type to a single string value. \n. @fehguy Seeing the number of people asking for it: is there already a consensus forming on which way the spec wants to go?\n. Well, it still is an issue: just pulled the latest Swagger UI and what I get is this:\n\nWhen will the HTML be interpreted and rendered by the new editor?. @webron Actually the Swagger 2.0 spec literally says in Schema Object that type  is \n\ntaken directly from the JSON Schema [Draft 04] definition and follow[s] the same specifications\n\nJSON Schema (including Draft 04) explicitly allows arrays for type. \nAlso it\u00b4s the only way to express nullable properties in Swagger 2.0 due to the lack of anyOf. Hiding nullability in the Swagger descriptions would most likely cause problems when generated client code encounters null values in real life.\nWe are currently faced with the dilemma that we really want to move from Swagger 2.0 and the corresponding 2.x tools to OpenAPI 3.0.1 and the corresponing 3.x tools, but we have hundreds of Swagger descriptions that work fine with the 2.x tools and appear to be incorrect when viewed with Swagger Editor 3.x.\nHow to proceed?. Ok, found it - very nicely structured source code! :+1:\n\nRemove validateTypeKeyShouldBeString from src/plugins/validate-semantic/validators/schema.js, \nThen npm run build\n\nAnd all is well. JSON Schema validation ensures that type only has one of the allowed string values in OAS3 files, so this only affects Swagger/OAS 2.0 files.\nWould be nice if this could become part of the standard distribution, or if it at least would be relaxed to a warning - which the name of the validation already indicates :wink:.. @webron We want to migrate to OAS3. This means\n\nMigrate tools to support both existing OAS2 content and new OAS3 content\nMigrate existing OAS2 content\n\nWith Swagger Editor 3.x not accepting content that is accepted by Swagger Editor 2.x migration fails in step 1.\nWhich is why it would be helpful if Swagger Editor 3.x would be more lenient. Making validateTypeKeyShouldBeString a warning instead of an error in the standard 3.x distribution would remove that obstacle.\n. @shockey that sounds very elegant: how/where do I register this override plugin? . @shockey cool, works like a charm \ud83d\ude04 .

I even checked out the http://editor2.swagger.io/#!/ to check if it's a user error on my end, but it seems that by making the following change under /products => get => parameters:\n- name: latitude\n          in: query\n          description: Latitude component of location.\n          required: true\n          type: boolean\nWhen selecting false, it does not appear in the query (I am trying to put the boolean in the body). Unfortunately, for me it's essential that I use a boolean...if I change the type to string, it works, but only if the user inputs either true or false (and that is prone to error - \"tue\", \"fasle\", etc.).\nPerhaps this has already been fixed or there is a workaround? :) Thanks!. @webron Hmmm, that's strange, I'm still getting the error...I made the same change as above and when I click on false, I get this for the query: GET https://api.uber.com/v1/products?latitude=&longitude= versus if I click true: GET https://api.uber.com/v1/products?latitude=&longitude=true\nAm I doing something wrong? \ud83e\udd14\nNote: I did try it out on Petstore and it worked there.. @webron 2.0, same as that in http://editor2.swagger.io/#!/. @shockey Awesome, thank you for pointing that out! I'll upgrade the version to get outta this limbo! :) Cheers!. ",
    "shockey": "@zoharsanchez, this bug may still exist in the 2.x series of the editor, as that series is no longer under development. If you use editor version 3 (found at http://editor.swagger.io/), you should be clear of this problem \ud83d\ude04 . I'm going to lock this thread since it applies to a very old version of Swagger Editor.\nIf you're still experiencing a problem, please open a new issue. Thanks!. Closing in favor of #1666 :+1: . Closing; I'm not seeing how this would map to the 3.x editor series.\nThanks for the feedback, @mm-gmbd!. The resolution is fixed in 3.x, but there's an incorrect \"Definition is never used\" warning when using the correctly escaped $ref (with %20).. Yeah, you're right @glen-84, this has cropped back up.\n~Reopening!~. This is going to land in a few parts (this week):\n\nExtending Swagger-Client to handle percent-encoded $refs, while still allowing unescaped values* so that we don't break anyone's documents\nAdding validators for unescaped $ref values in Swagger-Editor\nTaming the validators that complain about escaped $ref values\n\n*I usually don't allow non-spec behavior to hang around, but since the correct way to do this has been broken and the incorrect way has been working, I imagine we have a lot of this in the wild. I've made a note in the codebase to consider dropping this behavior in v4.. @julianlfs this is a very, very old issue - if you're having a problem, please open a new one \ud83d\ude04 . @jorgeorpinel, this issue was closed by a commit that was marked as fixing the issue: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/commit/856b5d984a0adf9a1383a7188da9556128b84e37. Closing as a duplicate of https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/1255.. @mindstretch23 AFAIK, this should work in any tool that is properly(!) implementing the OpenAPI Specification.. . - Codegen docs: http://generator.swagger.io/#/\n- Load server/client list once at load\n- Need to rename generated files on the fly\n- Optional: need config variable for custom codegen URL\n- Optional: use Swagger-Client to talk to codegen server (via http://generator.swagger.io/api/swagger.json). Hi @hemikak, apologies for the delayed response.\nI have a hunch that npm may have installed a bad version of React (or a related library), which would be our fault. Can you share your output of npm ls?. Hi,\nWe don't currently publish bundle files to npm, because npm will install Swagger-Editor's dependencies when the package is installed. You should be able to find all Swagger-Editor's dependencies in node_modules after doing an npm install.\nYou mentioned you're using Webpack- I'd expect Webpack to handle the bundling of Swagger-Editor's dependencies for you. Can you show me how you're using Swagger-Editor?\nConsuming a bundle installed via npm strikes me as odd- but I may not be considering every use case.\n@bodnia, @ponelat, @bn: your input is welcome here. My core concern with providing the bundle files in the npm module is that everyone will end up downloading dependencies twice: once when npm pulls down swagger-editor-bundle.js, and again when npm installs dependencies to node_modules.\nAs mentioned in swagger-api/swagger-ui#2758, one best-of-both-worlds solution is to publish a separate package with no dependencies listed in package.json that includes the bundle.. Fixed in 9e25440.\n@roonyh, feel free to open another ticket if you have any more to share about your use case. Thanks for your input here, and thanks for using Swagger!. Oh, also- it's available on npm as swagger-editor-dist \ud83d\ude04 . @hemikak, you can get the editor's value dynamically by calling self._swaggerEditor.specSelectors.specStr(), and set the value by calling self._swaggerEditor.updateSpec('new string for the editor').\nCheers!. Just looked over this again- my apologies, the correct way to set the value is self._swaggerEditor.specActions.updateSpec('new string for the editor').\nOther than that, you should be good to go. Thanks for using Swagger!. Using this spec to test:\n```yaml\nswagger: '2.0'\ninfo:\n  version: 1.0.0\n  title: Swagger Petstore\n  description: A sample API that uses a petstore as an example to demonstrate features in the swagger-2.0 specification\n  termsOfService: 'http://swagger.io/terms/'\n  contact:\n    name: Swagger API Team\n  license:\n    name: MIT\npaths:\n  /pets:\n    get:\n      description: Returns all pets from the system that the user has access to\n      parameters:\n        - name: tags\n          in: query\n          description: tags to filter by\n          required: false\n          type: array\n          collectionFormat: csv\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: pet response\n          schema:\n            type: array\n        default:\n          description: unexpected error\n```\nI get a semantic error:\n\nInvalid?. \n. Hey @MattGurneyAMP, @jemerald's plugin above automatically sends requests when Swagger Editor's content changes, not when the File menu is used \ud83d\ude04 . @MattGurneyAMP check out Netlify CMS, which lives under version control and already stores its data in YAML. Not sure if they have the necessary APIs for automated modification though.. This should be working again when we release new versions of Swagger-UI and Swagger-Editor on Friday. \ud83c\udf7b . Confirmed working for me; releasing version with a fix now.\nPlease reopen if the problem persists.. Looks good for the time being.\nThanks @Haroenv!. I'll add a validator to check for this.. Hi @duncanmg! \nIs there somewhere I can see your code? I have an idea of what's going on, but seeing what you're describing would make it easier to help out.. Hey @duncanmg, I'm looking at this, expect a reply from me today \ud83d\ude04 . First- wrapActions is an object, you provided an array. Easy mistake, ES2015 shorthand property names tend to look like array items at a glance \ud83d\ude04 \nSo, wrapActions is used to wrap an action that's already defined by another plugin.  updateSpec is provided by the spec plugin in Swagger-UI, which is why we wrap it in local-storage (but this isn't documented yet, so there's no reason you'd know that). \nIf you want to add setSpecName as a new action to specActions, you'll want to do this instead:\njs\nreturn {\n  statePlugins: {\n    spec: {\n      wrapActions: {\n        updateSpec\n      },\n      actions: {\n        setSpecName\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}. Also, once making the changes mentioned above, you should be able to use the specActions prop to call setSpecName instead of passing around setSpecName as a prop. Not having to pass around things is the reason we designed the global system like that \ud83d\ude04 \nIn order to read the spec name once you set it with setSpecState, you'll want a selector that you can access via specSelectors to match your action. Good example of that in the UI spec plugin. \nLet me know if any of this is too dense.. closing; we use a <textarea> now:\n\nthanks @lcofre!. The bugs mentioned upthread appear to have been fixed a while ago, so I'm going to close this ticket.\nThanks for the report, @brodney! Please ping if you're still experiencing any of these issues.. Dream solution: Create a higher-order component that consumes the UI's built-in StandaloneLayout, bolting on editor things.\nLow-effort solution: Copy what the UI layout is doing, in our layout.. Fixed \ud83c\udf89 . Closing this as it's out of scope for Swagger-Editor itself.\n@moon0326's solution is a good one to use while you're waiting for Swagger-Node to catch up :smile: . Closing; we have Customization docs now!. @webron, this is 2.x \ud83d\ude04 \nI've added a unit test to the 3.x series to prevent a regression there. \nUnassigning myself (edit: unless you want me to tackle this in 2.x @webron).. We can (should) mirror what we're doing in UI - provide the top bar and other assorted things for standalone use in a plugin.. Work being done here: https://github.com/shockey/swagger-editor/tree/ft/standalone-preset\nHaving an issue with the build process - going to fix some other things and circle back.. This appears to be fixed: \n\nI know we fixed this in the UI a short time ago - I can't find the relevant PR at the moment.\nClosing!. @webron, in order to support this, we'll have to change our \"Download YAML\" functionality to effectively be \"Download editor content as YAML\". \nShouldn't hurt anything - just wanted you to know what'll be going on behind the scenes.. This was an oversight on my part - when I built swagger-editor for 3.0.6* release, I had a stale swagger-ui version in my node_modules.\n@twawszczak, I'll cut a new release with the new stuff in it \ud83d\ude04 . \ud83d\ude31 . Working for me as well - @twawszczak @MBurchard, sharing specs we can test with will help us get this fixed.. @kkoumantaros Semantic validation should not be blocking the rendering. Can you check for an error message in your browser console?. @kkoumantaros I think you're experiencing a different problem. Can you open a new ticket and provide a copy of the spec that's giving you trouble, so we can look into it?. @michaelkourlas, apologies, no ETA from me - we have a sizeable backlog of issues, so it's hard to predict.\nI chatted with @webron and we settled on removing the partial path templating validator. A PR that does so would be much appreciated \ud83d\ude04  feel free to ping me if you need any pointers!. Can't reproduce this.\nI tried this, and only got a resolver error for the non-existent path:\nswagger: \"2.0\"\ninfo:\n  description: \"This is a sample server Petstore server.

Good catch @gitolicious!\nCan you merge/rebase your branch so I can merge this PR?. Looks like something got out of whack - no worries, I'll merge the change in in another PR and attribute the commit to you.. Code looks good! Thanks for the feature, @semagarcia.. @lpalash, a new interface for making autosuggest plugins just landed in master via https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/pull/1367.\nI'm going to rope in @ponelat, since he contributed the feature. Josh, I think you have a custom autosuggest plugin that's grabbing from a remote server, can you provide some pointers on implementing that?\nPS: Sorry for the delayed response - we've had an influx of tickets lately, and this slipped past us.. Hey @jaydreyer! \nFirst, I'll say that while I'm excited to see customized uses of the UI and Editor, it would be better if you customized things by passing in plugins to the Editor constructor. You can modify UI and Editor components/state/etc by doing so!\nBeyond that, I see a couple things here:\n1. A missing step here is an npm run build in your UI directory. Editor's build process uses UI as a module, so it expects something already built, regardless of which UI file you're consuming. Running build in your UI shoud put your changes into UI's dist directory.\n2. Based on your second message, I'm not 100% sure that the npm link took. Take a look at my output below, and use it to compare with what you're seeing:\n```\nkyle in ~/swagger/editor on git:master \u25cf [18:56:50]\n\u2192 ls ~/swagger/ui/dist\nfavicon-16x16.png                   oauth2-redirect.html                swagger-ui-standalone-preset.js     swagger-ui.css.map\nfavicon-32x32.png                   swagger-ui-bundle.js                swagger-ui-standalone-preset.js.map swagger-ui.js\nindex.html                          swagger-ui-bundle.js.map            swagger-ui.css                      swagger-ui.js.map\n\u2192 ls node_modules/swagger-ui \nLICENSE      README.md    dist         node_modules package.json\n\u2192 ls node_modules/swagger-ui/dist\nswagger-ui.css     swagger-ui.css.map swagger-ui.js      swagger-ui.js.map\n\u2192 npm link ../ui\n/Users/kyle/.nvm/versions/node/v6.9.0/lib/node_modules/swagger-ui -> /Users/kyle/swagger/ui\n/Users/kyle/swagger/editor/node_modules/swagger-ui -> /Users/kyle/.nvm/versions/node/v6.9.0/lib/node_modules/swagger-ui -> /Users/kyle/swagger/ui\n\u2192 ls node_modules/swagger-ui   \nDockerfile                        make-webpack-config.js            test\nLICENSE                           nginx.conf                        webpack-dist-bundle.config.js\nREADME.md                         node_modules                      webpack-dist-standalone.config.js\nbuild-tools                       package.json                      webpack-dist.config.js\ncomposer.json                     snapcraft.yaml                    webpack-hot-dev-server.config.js\ndev-helpers                       src                               webpack-watch.config.js\ndist                              swagger-config.yaml               webpack.check.js\ndocker-run.sh                     swagger-ui-dist-package           webpack.config.js\n\u2192 ls ~/swagger/ui/  \nDockerfile                        dist                              snapcraft.yaml                    webpack-dist-standalone.config.js\nLICENSE                           docker-run.sh                     src                               webpack-dist.config.js\nREADME.md                         make-webpack-config.js            swagger-config.yaml               webpack-hot-dev-server.config.js\nbuild-tools                       nginx.conf                        swagger-ui-dist-package           webpack-watch.config.js\ncomposer.json                     node_modules                      test                              webpack.check.js\ndev-helpers                       package.json                      webpack-dist-bundle.config.js     webpack.config.js\n```\nNote that I'm using the shortcut for npm link, Cmd+F You may also shortcut the two steps in one on the npm link docs for more info.\nThe takeaway is that after the link, my editor/node_modules/swagger-ui directory mirrors my main UI directory that I linked to, which looks entirely different from the prior folder of dist files.\nHopefully this is helpful. Let me know!. @jaydreyer, where/how are you pulling your UI plugin into the UI?\nSwagger-Editor passes its own options to the Swagger-UI constructor, which means your plugin may be placed in a spot that executes when Swagger-UI is being run directly, but not as a module.. Yep, so the Standalone preset gets used when you do things like npm run dev, or use the dist/index.html file - but it is not called when UI is used as a module \ud83d\ude04  There's no way you would've known that, though, because it's not documented yet.\nYou can either:\n1. move your plugin file(s) to your Editor repo, and pass your Info plugin in when you call the Editor constructor function.\n2. add your plugin to the UI core here - i don't suggest this, it may cause pain in the future if you need to update, but it will work\nLet me know if this isn't clear!. Awesome! Good luck \ud83d\ude04 \nI'm closing this, feel free to reply if you need it reopened.. @webron, I'm missing something... Can you clarify the specific issue here?. Aha! Thanks for the clarification.\nIt appears that we're sending the resolved spec to the generator API (see https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/src/plugins/topbar/topbar.jsx#L109 and https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/src/plugins/topbar/topbar.jsx#L122).. Yep, this is resolved.\nThanks for the bump, @jemerald!. (This is a UI feature)\n@webron I'm seeing two tasks here:\n\nSort tags in a predictable way\nSort operations within a tag in a predictable way\n\nMy question: how? Sorting tags alphabetically seems like the go-to, and sorting operations in a tag by method makes sense, but sorting by path then method is appealing as well.. @grosch, no worries, it is a lot of code \ud83d\ude04  Here's some pointers...\nThe order of tag/operation display comes from https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/master/src/core/components/operations.jsx#L78. We're just iterating over the taggedObj and operations in the order we get them, which ultimately comes from the mapTagOperations function in swagger-js:  https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/master/src/core/components/operations.jsx#L78.\nYou could probably sort the taggedObj object and operations array on the fly in the Operations render function that I linked to, and use the sorted versions to spit out the result in the render function.. @grosch, the best way to see your changes is by running npm run dev. It'll spin up a local server that automatically rebuilds your latest changes in memory. You can also run npm run build to get fresh files in the dist folder.\nThe lack of semicolons is just how we do things here - they have little utility in JavaScript source files outside of certain language constructs (loops etc), and affect readability. Most modern JS projects omit them, and we have a linter in our test suite that keeps us from running into gotchas related to omitting them.\nFor an optimal developer experience, I'd suggest installing a linter for your editor that can read eslint settings. It'll tell you how your code looks based on the style rules we've set. . This would actually be handled in http://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui \ud83d\ude04 \nWe can handle it here though, no worries.. Hey @DavidMCook, version 3 was actually a ground-up rewrite of Swagger-UI and Swagger-Editor, so this is more of a \"didn't reimplement\" situation, due to our limited resources.\nFYI: If you want to start out with all tags collapsed when the page loads, there is a docExpansion display configuration option that will do that for you today. . Fixed by https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/pull/3106.\nFixes will be released Friday \ud83c\udf89 . Just pushed out a point release (3.0.11) to fix this. Updated the swagger.io editor as well.. @rabbl, interesting. Can you provide me with a full spec that reproduces this behavior?. Bumping this request - I need a full spec in order to test for this. I'd also like to know what's in your browser console when this happens.\nIf curl works but your browser doesn't, this may be a CORS issue, if your server's Access-Control-Allow-Methods doesn't cover PUT.\nLastly, can you elaborate on \"The server redirects the put-request to the get-request\"? How are you implementing this?\nWill close this if there's no response.. Closing due to inactivity. Feel free to comment if there are any further thoughts or concerns.. Closing due to inactivity - feel free to comment if there are any further thoughts or concerns, and we'll be happy to reopen this issue.. Thanks for reporting this!\nThis is a known issue (duplicate of https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/1332). We patched this a couple of weeks ago in 3.0.11, please upgrade to that version to get the fix.\nI'm closing this, but feel free to reply if you need any help.. Thanks for the report!\nYou're correct, this is a bug. We're working on this in #1343.\nI'll keep this open until it's fixed. . Closing; one of the PRs for #1343 solved this :smile: \nThanks for the report, @SandeepNadella!. Related: #1342 . The new validation system, combined with my just-merged Swagger-Client PR, allows the test definition to return no validation errors in Swagger-Editor :tada: . @matterove, I don't see an attachment in your comment, can you try again?. Closing due to inactivity - feel free to comment if there are any further thoughts or concerns, and we'll be happy to reopen this issue.. Fixed in #1517 \ud83d\ude04 . I'm able to open Swagger-Editor locally without an internet connection - everything except the Generate menu works, since that requires talking to the generator.swagger.io API.\nWhat's not working for you?. Hey @jaydreyer!\nCurrently, the validation system is pretty much walled off. If you want to get a custom validator in the existing system today (or modify a current one), the only way is to add a validator file in src/plugins/validation/semantic-validation/validators and create a custom build. See this README for some documentation on how to cook up a validator. The builder should automatically pick up any validator file in that directory.\nTo do this through the plugin system (always my recommended solution), you'd need to roll your own validator. This isn't too difficult, it's basically a three step process:\n\nIntercept any updates to the resolved spec and trigger your validation: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/src/plugins/validation/apis/index.js#L7\nDo your validation work. Your spec is the first argument in your updateResolved wrapAction, you can write code that recursively scans your spec for the field you want to validate, not unlike this: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/src/plugins/validation/semantic-validators/validators/walker.js#L15\nAdd any errors you generate to the error state by calling errActions.newSpecErr: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/src/plugins/validation/helpers.js#L34. Also, @ponelat's PR this week (https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/pull/1367) added a state-based interface for editor plugins... it may be feasible to create a similar interface for semantic validators to be provided to the existing validation system by end users at runtime.. @jaydreyer, has this helped? Haven't heard back from you \ud83d\ude04 . @jaydreyer, that should be possible! \n\nAs long as you take a spec as an input and provide errors as an output, you should be able to do any sort of validation you'd like to in a plugin.\nYou won't be able to tie it into the validation system itself (which is a plugin itself), as the one we have is a closed system from a third-party plugin's point of view. You'd, essentially, need to build out your own plumbing. It's not a lot, our validation system is just an abstraction layer and aggregator for all the validators' results.\nI mentioned earlier:\n\n(#1367) added a state-based interface for editor plugins... it may be feasible to create a similar interface for semantic validators to be provided to the existing validation system by end users at runtime.\n\nThis would allow you to provide validators that work within the existing validation system, taking advantage of the plumbing already present in it. I'm not sure when we'd be able to get around to implementing this, but if you'd like to contribute this functionality, I can write up a detailed specification for the feature.. Closing due to inactivity.\nThis is simply to keep our issue tracker clean - as always, feel free to comment if there are any further thoughts or concerns, and we'll be happy to reopen this issue.. Hey @malerba118! I'm not exactly sure what you're referring to, see below:\n\nwe're sending our specs server-side for validation\n\nThe Editor does its validation locally in the browser, but the UI has a validation badge that uses the online.swagger.io validation service. Is that what you're referring to?\nIf sending specs over the wire is a concern, we could consider adding a configuration flag that disables online validation features - there's a related discussion for doing the same thing in a Docker context here: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/1488.\n\nit doesn't appear that these validators support async operations\n\nAre you referring to the x-async-operations (https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/issues/716)? AFAIK, there isn't any tooling that supports that keyword - from the discussion I linked, sounds like it lives on as callbacks in OpenAPI 3.0, but was never adopted as a Swagger 2.0 extension.. Ah, I see.\nThe semantic validation system we have assumes a synchronous validation function, but you can add errors directly into the global application state by using errActions.newSpecErr, just how we do in the semantic validation system: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/src/plugins/validation/helpers.js#L35. You'd be able to do any async work you want, then trigger the newSpecErr action when you have the data you want.\nI'm not sure how familiar you are with React and Redux - if you are this may be pretty intuitive, and if not you may need some guidance to get started with this. Let me know if you have specific questions, or if a general overview of how the existing system works would be helpful..

There's a few Object.values references as well: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=%22Object.values%22&type=. @ponelat you're right, but Object.values is an ES2017 feature (currently in stage 4).\n\nAutomatically requires babel-runtime/core-js and maps ES6 static methods and built-ins.\ntransform-runtime docs\n\nSounds like Object.values may not be covered by transform-runtime..

Hi @hemikak!\n\nCurrently when editing in the ace editor, if we update the YAML text and make a mistake, the annotations on the editor takes 1200 milliseconds to show in the gutter. Is it possible to remove this delay ?\n\nIt's not currently. I'd be open to adding an Editor setting for this, but for the moment it's always 1200ms. Pull requests are welcome \ud83d\ude04 \n\nis there a function to provide an YAML swagger or a JSON swagger text and check if it has errors?\n\nYou can't attach to the validation system that's built into the Editor, directly. \nHowever, you may want to check out the Swagger Validator Badge service: https://github.com/swagger-api/validator-badge\nYou can send your spec to the service's /validator/debug endpoint and get back validation information about your spec, It's not the same validation system that powers the Editor, but the two validation systems cover a lot of the same cases.\nLet me know if this helps. Thanks for using Swagger!. This sounds invalid/wontfix? Closing.. @wenkchan, I need the following info:\n\nYour OS\nYour node -v\nYour npm -v\n\nThanks!. @fvillanueva, are you having this problem as well? If so, I'd appreciate you providing your exact Node/npm versions and OS you're using as well.. @fvillanueva, I'm a bit confused - are you saying you don't have a problem running the project now? Can this issue be closed?. @wenkchan, are you still having issues? Still need some more information from you.. Easy fix, but I'm holding on this pending #1517, which should be merged this week.. Your guess is probably right - at some point I moved most of the codebase to using array paths, but there may be a few dot-delineated string paths running about.. @jerrywangatoracle, I'm able to open a Petstore operation in IE11:\n\nAre you able to do the same?\nAlso, are you able to share the spec that's giving you trouble? Something about your spec may be causing a browser-specific issue.. Closing due to inactivity.\nThis is simply to keep our issue tracker clean - feel free to comment if there are any further thoughts or concerns, and we'll be happy to reopen this issue.. Well, this is embarrassing.... The path translator tests weren't running, because of the just-test-in-node script definition.\nJust fixed that, looking more into this now.\nClarificaton: tests not running aren't @owenconti's fault, by any means.... in fact, it's likely my fault. @S73417H, I'll zoom out a bit to give you some more context:\nSwagger-UI exposes a plugin system, and Swagger-Editor itself is a plugin of Swagger-UI (see here, whenever you create a SwaggerEditor instance, SwaggerUI is called). The right side of Swagger-Editor is a Swagger-UI instance with the editor value fed in.\nYou'll also notice that the options that the Editor is called with will be handed off to Swagger-UI, so you could pass a oauth2RedirectUrl (that's url, not uri) to the Editor today and be on your way. \n\nI'm not aware of any proposals to add a redirect url to the specification, but you're welcome to open an issue about it over at the OpenAPI Specification repo: https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/issues.\nAs for the UI and Editor, the x-oauth2RedirectUri: 'http://foobar.com' functionality you're describing would be a great candidate for a third-party plugin. AFAIK, we don't have any unofficial extensions to the spec supported today, so we're unlikely to add it to the core project.. Closing due to inactivity.\nThis is simply to keep our issue tracker clean - feel free to comment if there are any further thoughts or concerns, and we'll be happy to reopen this issue.. At first glance, I don't feel great about using . Pane1 and . Pane2 for CSS targeting.\nI know we're doing it elsewhere and it's not likely to change, but it would be best to add IDs for the Editor and UI panes so they can be targeted more specifically.\nI'll circle back on this PR soon \ud83d\ude04 . @cproof, that would be great! If that change is made, I'd be happy to merge this.. @cproof, yeah, I see what you're saying now, we're just pulling in the UI layout, so it'd be hard to inject ids.\nIn light of that, this should be fine (since it works!). Thanks for the contribution!. I loaded your example spec into the Editor (at http://editor.swagger.io/) and refreshed a couple times, I saw a request for B.yaml each time the page loaded. I even changed the ref to $ref: 'http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json' to simulate a successful fetch of a remote YAML document - same behavior, an HTTP request went out with each refresh.\nCan you help me reproduce this?. Closing due to inactivity.\nThis is simply to keep our issue tracker clean - feel free to comment if there are any further thoughts or concerns, and we'll be happy to reopen this issue.. To follow up here - there are no persistent (past a refresh) caching mechanisms for YAML built into Swagger-Editor that I'm aware of, though the Editor may cache a file within the same editing session. That mechanism is in place to make sure that a remote reference used in many places within an API definition is only fetched once.\nIf you're having problems with persistent caching, please make sure that the server hosting your YAML isn't setting any caching headers (like Expires or Cache-Control). . I have a theory: when our autosuggest code throws an uncaught error, Ace returns the current character as the resolved autosuggest value - so when live autocomplete fires and ends with an error, that buffer is appended to the value under the cursor, and the user sees a repeated character.. Good news! I'm pretty confident I've fixed this issue in #1544.\nI'm going to keep this issue open for a little while longer.. Shipping the new version now - it will be live in about 15 minutes.\nThanks, everyone! Feel free to bump this thread if you run into this issue again.. @traber333, good idea \ud83d\ude04 keep in mind that PRs for functionality are welcome, if you have the time!\nAlso, if you can provide the spec that's giving you problems, that would help us debug what's making the Editor slow for you.. @traber333, FYI we pushed out a performance release last week that has made the Editor much faster!. See: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor#running-locally.\nThat section is a bit thin, any recommendations on what could be improved?. Hey @theigor!\nWe actually publish two modules, swagger-editor and swagger-editor-dist. You're correct, this has been undocumented, which is a problem. I just added a section to the README about it (via #1505), which you'll find copied below:\n\nThis repository publishes to two different NPM modules:\n\nswagger-editor is a traditional npm module intended for use in JavaScript web application projects that are capable of resolving dependencies (via Webpack, Browserify, etc).\nswagger-editor-dist is a dependency-free module that includes everything you need to serve Swagger-Editor in a server-side project, or a web project that can't resolve npm module dependencies.\n\n\nIf you want to serve Swagger-Editor with http-server, this should do the trick:\nnpm i -g http-server\nnpm i -g swagger-editor-dist\nhttp-server $(npm root -g)/swagger-editor-dist -p 3002. > what is the process for getting this running via webpack or something similar? \nSure, you'd just import swagger-editor into your project like you would any other module. \nI wrote an example React application that illustrates what this looks like with Swagger-UI: https://github.com/shockey/swagger-ui-cra/blob/f71b79125512bf4a159bf7f1b14af3c4d19e1894/src/App.js#L20\nDoing the same thing with Swagger-Editor would be very similar.\n\nAre you saying I can globally install swagger-editor and start the editor on some port via a script?\n\nThe Swagger-Editor project is a web application/library, so providing an application server to serve the Editor is a bit out of scope for us (though we do have a Docker image that does that, since Docker containers need to expose something to the world).\nTo sum it up: the swagger-editor module is meant for use within single-page applications, and expects that your project is capable of resolving npm module references. swagger-editor-dist, on the other hand, is for server-side projects and times when you literally just want to serve Swagger-Editor (like you just did with http-server!).. Thanks @zaynetro, I hadn't realized the omission. I opened a new ticket for that specific bit of documentation \ud83d\ude04 . @halmai, this is expected behavior. See the discussion here: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/pull/3353#issuecomment-314190476\nYou should be able to preserve whitespace by wrapping your code in triple backticks, which translates to a <pre> element in the resulting HTML.\nI'm closing this as wontfix, but feel free to reply if you have any further thoughts!. @halmai, FYI there's a pretty helpful project that will save changes you make in the Editor to disk: https://github.com/moon0326/swagger-editor-live. Thanks @hkosova - closing as fixed!. Sorry @owenconti, didn't see this until now.\nThanks for the fix!. Closing as a duplicate of #1413.. @iget-master, this fix hasn't been pushed out to editor.swagger.io - we usually push out releases on Friday evening.\nI just tested your spec in the latest revision and there are no errors \ud83d\ude04 . This is part of semantic validation, which isn't yet implemented for OAS3.\ncc @webron. Not sure this is actionable - JSON, and JavaScript objects themselves, only allow key names to be strings.\nOur YAML parser in the Editor casts numerical keys to strings as I would as expect a YAML parser to - as a result, it's impossible to identify what was a number in the resulting JS object. The only way to reliably detect this would be to traverse a YAML AST, which would introduce more overhead to the validators.\nDo we know of any cases where using a YAML number breaks tooling?. Closing for now, per discussion with @webron. If tooling issues with the keys come up, we will reopen!.

Confirmed:\n\n. Closing as a duplicate of #1414, which was fixed by #1544, which will be released tonight :smile: \nThanks @MidnightP & @tgockel!. This is an oversight on our part \ud83d\ude2c  \nFor starters, you can use any parameters mentioned in Swagger-UI's documentation: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui#parameters\nI'll keep this open so we can get around to documenting this in the Editor README, and some better documentation of Editor-specific things.. @tyrsius, my apologies for dropping the ball here - this was mistakenly not tagged as a Support ticket for your questions.\n\nHow do you start the editor with a spec using a URL? (README says this is missing)\n\nThere's currently no officially supported way to do this (there's some work that needs to be done on it, for example it should convert JSON to YAML when it imports), but the Editor will pick up on a url configuration option. You can set it in the configuration object you pass to Swagger-Editor, or in the query string of the URL you're using to access the Editor.\n\nHow do you start the editor with a spec in memory?\n\nAgain, this is not officially supported, but you can pass a spec as a JavaScript object in through the configuration object only, as the spec option.\nIf you want to add YAML... that's trickier. You'll need to reach into the Editor's internals to do that, here's an example:\n```js\nconst editor = SwaggerEditor({\n  dom_id: '#swagger-editor'\n})\nconst myYamlSpec = \"swagger: 2.0\\ninfo:\\n  title: Here is my spec\"\neditor.specActions.updateSpec(myYamlSpec)\n```\nThis method is not part of our public API, and may change when the project's minor version changes. That said, it hasn't changed since 3.0.0.\n\nHow do you listen/subscribe/hook changes to the editor's value (the current spec)?\n\nYou can write a plugin that achieves this:\n```js\nconst SpecUpdateListenerPlugin = function() {\n  return {\n    statePlugins: {\n      spec: {\n        wrapActions: {\n          updateSpec: (oriAction) => (...args) => {\n            const [str] = args\n            console.log(str)\n            return oriAction(...args)\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nSwaggerEditor({\n    dom_id: '#swagger-editor',\n  plugins: [\n    SpecUpdateListenerPlugin\n  ]\n})\n```\n\nHow do you set the editors value?\n\nSee my answer above that uses updateSpec.\n\nHopefully this helps. The use cases your questions allude to are valid, and I'd love to see first-class interfaces for them (I imagine a onEditorValueChange callback config option, and a better spec option, for starters), but our resources are limited - if you have the time to submit a PR for any of this, it'd be appreciated!. Glad to hear it!\nI'm going to leave this issue open, as I'd like to see these cases addressed in our documentation as common examples of how to use the plugin system.. This is likely coming from handing the resolved API definition to the generator: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/src/standalone/topbar/topbar.jsx#L126\n@webron, is it safe to pass an unresolved API definition to the generator? I couldn't find any documentation that mentions it. If so, this is an easy fix!. This should be fixed in master, and released tomorrow \ud83d\ude04 \nThanks for the report @minchao!. I can reproduce this when accessing the Editor over HTTPS (https://editor.swagger.io/).\nThis is interesting, since we're fetching the Generator API definition over HTTPS: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/src/standalone/topbar/topbar.jsx#L18\nMaybe there's some funk with the scheme inference on Swagger-Client's side.. @hemanth7787, yep, this hasn't been fixed yet.. Aha - this is Swagger-Codegen's fault!\n\nMixed Content: The page at 'https://localhost:3201/' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure resource 'http://generator.swagger.io/api/gen/download/9072771b-127c-4d76-9046-a9e7216f69fc'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.\n\nThe generator is sending the user agent to an http download URL, even if the initial request was over HTTPS. Clearly, browsers don't allow accessing HTTP content from an HTTPS page, so the download fails.. @easygoingalex, what do you mean by \"fall back to http\"? Can you explain what you're expecting to happen?. Approved.\nThanks for this, @edugonz! \ud83d\ude04 . Hi @maclonghorn!\nWe're following the OpenAPI specification here:\n\nThe OpenAPI Specification is versioned using Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 (semver) and follows the semver specification.\nhttps://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#versions\n\nSemantic Versioning, in turn, says:\n\nA normal version number MUST take the form X.Y.Z where X, Y, and Z are non-negative integers, and MUST NOT contain leading zeroes. X is the major version, Y is the minor version, and Z is the patch version. Each element MUST increase numerically. For instance: 1.9.0 -> 1.10.0 -> 1.11.0.\nhttp://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html#spec-item-2\n\n\nThat being said, that's an easy thing to overlook. I'd be open to a note in the README pointing this potential hangup out - @webron, any thoughts?. This is a duplicate of https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/1474 \ud83d\ude03. Taking a look at what goes into the Docker image (index.html in particular), I didn't see any references to any assets that would require an internet connection (see: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/index.html)\nCan you provide the errors you're getting when running the image? Seeing what it's trying to reach out for would be very helpful.. Ah, got it now. Those three requests are needed for the codegen features (Generate Server and Generate Client in the top menu) to work. No API definition information is sent in those initial requests, but if the Codegen features are used, the definition is sent to generator.swagger.io.\nWhile it is possible to disable the Codegen feature if you're controlling the initial Swagger-Editor call, there's currently no way to disable it from the Docker level. \n\nGiven that additional Docker images for the validator and the codegen/generator features exist I thought that the Editor could be provisioned similarly to the UI.\n\nThe Validator project is actually different from the validation you find in the Editor :smile: Similarly, the Codegen feature in the Editor that you're observing is an interface to a running instance of the Codegen project.\n\nI think the best way forward here would be to add a configuration option, codegenUrl, that is controllable through Docker environment variables. A null/\"null\" value would disable the Codegen menu entirely, and prevent any requests for Codegen resources.\nPinging @webron for prioritization and thoughts!. Hi @pofallon!\nAs @webron mentioned, we maintain two different npm modules for the project, in order to support two very different use cases. I'll try to give some more context...\nThe swagger-editor package is meant for consumption within other browser-based JavaScript projects that are capable of handling the way NPM installs dependencies (i.e., a module bundler). We expect that you're doing something along the lines of importing the module into your project's code and creating an instance of Swagger Editor that mounts into your application, running in a user's browser.\nIf you want to use Swagger Editor indirectly, say by having a Node project open a browser window to the static index.html you can see in our repository, you'll want to use the swagger-editor-dist package, which comes with the bundle files (dependencies included) and the HTML/image assets  necessary to use Swagger-Editor without any build system or frontend code on your end.. Hmmm - I see that from my end too. That's an oversight on our part, probably stemming from the fact that we borrowed the dist package's build script from Swagger-UI - for legacy reasons, index.html is in UI's dist folder, but in Editor's root directory.\nI'll open a PR that fixes that today, which should go live when we release a new version on Friday. In the meantime, you should be able to safely copy the index.html we have in the repository and use it for building out your project!. @pofallon, I just merged #1492 which will include index.html in future releases of swagger-editor-dist. Thanks for bringing this to our attention!\nI'm going to close this since it seems like this is solved. If you have any lingering concerns, feel free to reply and I'll reopen this ticket.. @hkosova, I'm not seeing this in Chrome 63:\n\nClosing; let me know if this is in error!. Note that this adds to our deeper issue with validation misinterpreting blessed string values (https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/1343)... avoiding would require significant changes, and is best left for dedicated work on the problem.. Hmmm... I like this a little better, than stacking properties into the Schema message, since we have a special one for Headers already. Let's keep it \ud83d\ude04 . Thanks for the spec, @tagliala! It helped me test this quickly.\n@webron, I agree with your assessment. The only recent change to the codegen interface is moving away from sending the resolved spec.\nHowever.... something isn't quite lining up \ud83e\udd14 The change to the codegen interface on our side, went live as part of 3.1.7: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/compare/v3.1.6...v3.1.7.\nVersion 3.1.6 had no changes to the codegen interface: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/compare/v3.1.5...v3.1.6\nI tested the example spec in 3.1.6, and it generated a JavaScript client correctly. 3.1.7 did not.\nIt looks like codegen is complaining:\nUnable to build target: Could not process operation:\u21b5  Tag: rides\u21b5  Operation: addRide\u21b5  Resource: post /rides\u21b5  Definitions: {Ride=io.swagger.models.ModelImpl@4c0887cd}\u21b5  Exception: null\nThat being said... I think this should be kicked over to swagger-codegen \ud83d\ude04 . @hungnd, make sure your openapi property is openapi: \"3.0.0\". If that doesn't solve your problem, feel free to open a new issue and we'll help out there.. Closing, we produce validation warnings for this now:\n\n. Closing due to inactivity.\nThis is simply to keep our issue tracker clean - feel free to comment if there are any further thoughts or concerns, and we'll be happy to reopen this issue.. This should be fixed now \ud83d\ude04 . From @tbarsballe, in the related UI issue:\n\nUPDATE: For me, this only seems to occur when using editor.swagger.io. When using swager-ui standalone, everything displays fine.\n\nMy first guess would be that there's some CSS being used in the standalone versions that cause the problem \ud83e\udd14 . Hey @jaydreyer! Great to hear that you're integrating it into your portal.\nAdding the Topbar plugin just provides the Topbar component to the system - in order to do something  with the component, you need to create a layout that uses the component.\nCheck out how we do this with StandaloneLayout:\n\ndefining it here, and placing the Topbar alongside the regular EditorLayout: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/src/standalone/standalone-layout.js#L24\nproviding the StandaloneLayout to the system as a component: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/src/standalone/index.js#L4\nthis could be done in the TopbarPlugin (two different plugins is not necessary, StandaloneLayout is just a regular component)\ntelling Swagger-Editor to use StandaloneLayout: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/index.html#L55\n\nOne other thing...\n\nadded TopbarPlugin to the list in const plugins = {}\n\nI'm not sure what you're referring to. The plugins configuration option is meant to be an array, but you may be referring to something different - can you share some more context on this?. No worries! I\u2019ll take a deeper look at this tomorrow and ping you.. Bug confirmed - we need to provide an OAuth redirector in the Docker image.. @freegnu that would be nice, but would require a change to the OpenAPI specification!\nIt currently reads: \n\nParameter.required\nDetermines whether this parameter is mandatory. If the parameter location is \"path\", this property is REQUIRED and its value MUST be true. Otherwise, the property MAY be included and its default value is false.\n\nIf we just transparently added required: true in the UI/Editor, it would be out of line with the specification and confusing to end-users. It may also break other Swagger/OpenAPI tools that don't transparently add required: true.\nThat said, I don't think it'd be a terrible idea to change the specification to something like if the parameter location is \"path\", this property's default value is true, and MAY explicitly be set to true. \nFeel free to bring it up with the OpenAPI folks here: https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/issues. @andynuss, is there still something we can help with here?. @andynuss, glad to hear you got it working.\nFor future reference, we're unable to give support for SwaggerHub here. The SwaggerHub team should be able to help you though :smile: \nClosing!. Thanks @ponelat!\nFYI, we're no longer doing builds in PRs. No worries there, I'll just revert your dist changes.. @ponelat, is there a configsSelector UI PR open?. @ponelat, sorry to kick this back... can you hit the merge conflicts?. @ponelat sure, email me with a time in the coming week and we can sync up.\nI also can't merge this until the tests pass \ud83d\ude09 . Work continues on this; marking the PR itself as On hold since it's not in a final state.. Fixes:\n- https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/1347\nImproves:\n- https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/1343. Thanks for the report, @nickshoe!\nWe have a pretty significant validation PR waiting in the wings (#1517). I have a hunch that the new validation selector system will allow for more precise targeting of parameter validation.\n#/definitions/Context Object/properties contains a property named parameters, which is incorrectly triggering parameter validation. You're seeing many errors due to the fact that we validate $ref'd objects at each point that they are used.\nThis is part of a larger issue, #1343.. I managed to find a simple way to fix this \ud83d\ude04 \nI'll merge the PR in a moment, and the fix should be released on Friday. If you urgently need the new build, you can clone the project and cut your own build. \nFWIW, with this fix, your definition validates with no errors - just a few warnings about siblings of $ref values!. \nNo problem! Thanks for reporting the issue.. This works for me as well.\nI did the following:\n1. Downloaded a ZIP of Swagger-Editor's master branch, expanded it into a directory\n2.

Hi @niculistana!\nYou can use http://gist.github.com/ to share your definition, or email it to me (email is in my profile). Without it, there's not much to work with.. @cabbonizio, you can pass any valid Swagger-UI configuration item to Swagger-Editor, and it will hand off the value to the underlying Swagger-UI instance :smile: Setting docExpansion: \"none\" or defaultModelExpandDepth: 0 should help with your specific issue.. @cabbonizio, let's continue this discussion in #1547 \ud83d\ude04 I left some notes about the current state of Docker configuration there.. @niculistana, profiling is mostly done by using JavaScript and React.js performance tools to analyze the application. If you're interested in going that route, I can point you in the right direction.\nAs for optimizations... you could make your definition less complex by minimizing $ref usage.... but that makes for a bad user experience.\nThere's a lot of moving parts in the Editor (which also uses Swagger-UI and Swagger-Client under the hood), so performance debugging could turn into quite the rabbit hole. The best way to speed up your definition, IMO, is to help us reproduce the issues you're facing. We're aware of many things we could do to improve performance, but with our limited resources we prioritize based on what users report.\nIf your definition is proprietary, you can email the definition to @webron and I privately. Alternatively, you could provide us with a link to a secret Gist you control that includes the definition. I understand sharing it may be out of your control, but without a definition there's not much we can do from our end.. @niculistana my apologies! I have seen that email, I just didn't put two and two together here \ud83d\ude04 \nAs Ron mentioned, we did look at your definition, and found the bottleneck to be in Swagger-Client's   dereferencing plugin, which takes ~30 seconds to run. This appears to be the source of the lion's share of the slowness you're seeing.\nWe do know of ways to improve that area of Swagger-Client, and the level of slowness there puts it pretty high on our performance todo list, but I can't give an ETA on it being fixed.\nIn the meantime, reducing your $ref density and splitting your definition into parts is a good stopgap measure.. Update: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js/issues/1150 is likely a fix for your issues, @niculistana \ud83d\ude04 . Closing due to inactivity. \nThis is simply to keep our issue tracker clean - feel free to comment if there are any further thoughts or concerns, and we'll be happy to reopen this issue.. @cabbonizio, awesome, thanks!\nIf you or someone on your team has the time to spare, a pull request that implements this would be welcome - it'll be a little while before we can get to this.\nFor reference, here's how Swagger-UI is doing Docker variables: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/master/docker-run.sh#L33. We have a similar docker-run.sh script in Swagger-Editor.\nAlso, cc @webron, please chime in if you lean one way or another w/r/t the possible solutions!. Hi @jonDel, thanks for the request!\nThe menu items aren't controlled by the Editor itself - we fetch a list of available clients and servers from the Generator service: http://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://generator.swagger.io/api/swagger.json\n@webron, where should this request live?. Closing, as this is a Codegen issue.\n@jonDel, feel free to re-file this at the repository @webron mentioned.. @zmlcc, in the Editor we're just listing the server generators provided by GET /gen/servers, so IMO it's on the Codegen project to list the generators they use correctly - feel free to open a ticket there!. thanks @lshaw-sb!. Holding on this pending #1517 (cc @ponelat).\nThanks @joshuawoodward \ud83d\ude04 . The underlying issue (https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/1343) was solved by the new validation system and some Swagger-Client changes, so I'm going to close this out.\nThanks, @joshuawoodward!. > This code is in the web.config file and other requests work, except basic authentication\nWe see this sometimes, where CORS headers are not attached to HTTP responses with errors. Please make sure that the Access-Control headers are present if your server is sending back a 401 Unauthorized for the authorization \ud83d\ude04 . @ASchmidt1, we hashed this out in Swagger-UI recently: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/4070\nWe send Accept: application/json, application/yaml now, does that work for your purposes?. @ASchmidt1, there wasn't a lot of art behind choosing to add application/yaml: in the absence of any standards guidance on which is best, I chose what appears to be most widely supported by server implementations.\nIf you'd like to improve on what we have now, feel free to open a pull request in Swagger-Client. It's a simple one-line change to the Accept header, see here for an example: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js/pull/1232/files#diff-166c7983bf6f3e2e63b5c6fe74b6c2d9L257. @hkosova, done - I'll look at this in the coming week!. This is more complex than I was anticipating :confused: \nThere are some elusive issues with $$ref meta patches in specmap within Swagger-Client that are causing $ref validation here to be unreliable.\nI'm going to have to punt this to next week (when I have more time) and dig into specmap.. Reopening to ensure that this is tracked when the OAS3 semantic validation work ships.. @dylan-colaco, can you provide a copy of (or link to) your definition? Without it, all we can do is speculate about what the problem is.. This is fixed over in Swagger-UI.\nThanks for the report, @rranade!. This is fixed! \ud83c\udf89 . Thanks, @XuluWarrior! Good catch.. Thanks, @c-swope!. Hi @MSourabh17! Thanks for the report.\nThe Generate Server/Generate Client options are powered by Swagger-Codegen, so you should file an issue with them: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/issues. This is a bug in Microsoft Edge: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/4060236/\nBasically, it's not rendering the Jump icon because the image is encoded as a base64 svg+xml data URI.\n@webron - should we change our image embedding strategy to avoid this browser bug?. Hi @SuperMasterBlasterLaser!\nTry this on for size:\njs\nconst isValid = !(editor.errSelectors.allErrors().size)\nThis will be true if there are no errors stored in the Editor's state (i.e., the current content is valid) and false otherwise.\nWord of caution: this API is pretty stable, however, changes to it are not considered breaking changes. This means that it may change in minor version updates, so plan your versioning accordingly.\nAlso, on an unrelated note, if you're using Swagger-Editor in a React application, it would be better to use the swagger-editor module than swagger-editor-dist. Module bundlers are able to make your bundle smaller that way :smile: \nLet me know if this helps!.

Thanks, @scop!. Hi @mustafamotiwala, thanks for the report.\nAre you using editor.swagger.io? If so, are you accessing it over HTTP or over HTTPS?. Aha :) This is a duplicate of https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/1474, then, so I'm going to close this in favor of that ticket!\nI'm going to do my best to address the issue this week, since it's a recurring issue for folks.. @alevinetx @manoadamro, the downloadFile issue was fixed in https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/1648 today!. @thinkh apologies! the Generator service crashed last night, it should be back as of 9 hours ago \ud83d\ude04 . @gurmeetb, it's working for me when I try to generate a server from the Swagger 2.0 Petstore.\nDoes that work for you? If it does, can you provide a Swagger definition that doesn't work, so we can look into it?\nThanks!. Hi everyone, I\u2019m going to lock this thread since the original problem was identified as a duplicate long ago. \nIf you\u2019re having a Generator interface issue, please file a new issue. Thanks!. Hi everyone - sorry about this problem! I've just patched it in Swagger-UI, and the fix will be released tonight.\nThanks for filing this \ud83d\ude04 . Thanks @hkosova, didn't notice the swagger: \"2.0\".\nMoving this to support!. Closing due to inactivity. \nThis is simply to keep our issue tracker clean - feel free to comment if there are any further thoughts or concerns, and we'll be happy to reopen this issue.. @nickzao, yep, this is a bug. Looks like some of the new validators aren't correctly guarded to only process Swagger 2 definitions - oof!. Hi @greenstatic! I've released swagger-editor@3.2.1 which includes a fix for this bug.\nThanks for the report!. OpenAPI 3.0 definitions shouldn't be subject to semantic validation yet (cc swagger-api/swagger-editor#1599), so this is a bug!. Hi @weppos! I've released swagger-editor@3.2.1 which includes a fix for this bug.\nThanks for the report!. Hey @alexander-frolov, can you provide a sample API definition that demonstrates this issue?. Thanks! I was looking into this last week actually - the $ref is causing a problem with our new validation system. This should be fixed soon!. Hi @scara! This was fixed in swagger-editor@3.2.3, which was released last Friday.. Hi @axnsan12!\nThe OpenAPI and JSONSchema specifications both indicate that they use JavaScript's regex dialect, as defined by the ECMA 262 specification for the language. ECMA says:\n\nIt is a Syntax Error if FlagText of RegularExpressionLiteral contains any code points other than \"g\", \"i\", \"m\", \"u\", or \"y\", or if it contains the same code point more than once.\nref\n\nSo Swagger-Editor is more correct than Swagger-Validator actually :smile: \nThe Swagger/OpenAPI 2.0 specification is no longer being worked on, so this is the law of the land... however, if you'd like to suggest that the OpenAPI 3.0 specification be changed to accommodate a wider regex vocabulary, you can open an issue over at the OpenAPI Specification repository.. > I guess I will have to adapt my regexes then\nSounds like fun :wink: \nThanks for the report, glad we got this resolved. Closing!. Hmm, yeah, you're right. I looked at the original regex wrong and was reading it as /Z, my apologies!\nLooking at this again now.. So this is interesting... We use AJV for validating API definitions against a JSONSchema for each version of the OpenAPI specification we support (2.0 and 3.0). \nIn their regex validator, they specifically mark regular expressions that end in \\Z as invalid: https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv/commit/08e87c1f30025918e04b44c36bdef61d3bafa188\nIf I had to guess, I'd say that they're trying to prevent misuse of regex over the built in date-time format... anyway, I've reached out on their Gitter channel for an answer to why this is being done - so stay tuned!. Yep, looks like that's the answer, see the JSONSchema JavaScript test suite: https://github.com/json-schema-org/JSON-Schema-Test-Suite/blob/master/tests/draft7/optional/ecmascript-regex.json\nThat being said, I do think we should add a semantic validator for this case, since the current error message is (clearly) not helpful.. Hi @xjurcak! This was fixed in 3.2.1, but we're having problems redeploying editor.swagger.io :confused: it should be resolved tomorrow!. Deployed! This should be fixed :smile: . Thanks for the report, @shengt!\nThis was fixed in 3.2.1, but we're having problems redeploying the online Editor service (cc #1604). This should be resolved in the next day or so!. Deployed! This should be fixed :smile: . @filipsuk yep, it is - we're tracking that in https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/1614, and should have it fixed this week \ud83d\ude04 . Hi @rajkumaridsil, the OPTIONS request is a CORS preflight request that your browser sends whenever a web application tries to send a request to any origin that doesn't match the current page's origin.\nWe have some documentation on how to set up your API server to support CORS, see here: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/master/docs/usage/cors.md. Closing due to inactivity. \nThis is simply to keep our issue tracker clean - feel free to comment if there are any further thoughts or concerns, and we'll be happy to reopen this issue.. This is fixed, thanks @elasti-ron!\n  . fixed (again!), thanks for the heads up @elasti-ron!. This is being caused by a TypeError in the isAuthorized auth selector, which expects securities.toJS() to yield an array:\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/master/src/core/plugins/auth/selectors.js#L82\nWe could fix this by doing more type-checking or providing fallback values in that selector, or even avoiding converting from the Immutable data structure in the first place... but what we really need to do is try/catch the Redux code, so that any error within the Redux bits doesn't bring down the entire application (see https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/3362). This generalized solution is good because a large amount of the application runs on arbitrary user inputs, so we can't realistically hope to cover every possible case.. Oh, also, I did fix this specific case in a Swagger-UI PR that's still unmerged: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/4054.... but the general solution still needs to happen :smile: \nThanks for filing this, @tnjohansson!. Fixed! This will be live on Friday evening.\nThanks for the report, @tnjohansson!. Confirmed, getting a TypeError:\njs\nTypeError: path should be an array of strings\n    at Object.getLineNumberForPath\nThis may be related to the recent specPath changes.. Fixed.\nThanks, @tnjohansson!. @gitforpushpak I'm expecting to get a fix out tomorrow evening \ud83d\ude04 . This is fixed. Thanks @wol190!. @wol190, is this with the API definition that you provided in the original issue filing?\nIf so, I'm not able to reproduce it. Do note that the dist/ files in the repository are stale, since they're only updated during releases. You'll need to clone the project and run a development server in order to work with the latest changes.\nLet me know!. Hi @killkohon!\nUnfortunately, all tickets need to be in English. Please open a new ticket in English if you're able to :smile: . Hi @gitforpushpak!\nThis is a known bug (https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/1614) that was introduced by our new validation system last week.\nI expect to have this patched within the next day or two, and have a fix released this Friday. SwaggerHub will need to pick the changes up though, you'd need to ask them when they have a release scheduled that will include it.. @gitforpushpak, if you're using SwaggerHub you'll need to wait until the SwaggerHub team updates their service to use the latest version of Swagger-Editor - there's no way for you as a user to swap out the version used within SwaggerHub.\nThe fix I'm about to merge into our master branch changes the data going into the path item validator, so that $ref'd parameters are correctly taken into account.\n(cc: @ponelat). I closed this as the issue is resolved on our end, but feel free to reply if you have any lingering questions @gitforpushpak!. Hi @rafiqips5, please open this ticket in the swagger-codegen project!. Hi @RadMK! \nThis is not a Swagger-Editor issue - please open this issue in the Springfox repo \ud83d\ude04 . cc @webron. Thanks for the report! This is an issue with MS Edge's Fetch API implementation \ud83d\ude04 \nClosing as a duplicate of https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js/issues/1206; cc https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/pull/1592.. Sounds good. I'll most likely be able to pick this up this week, I'll keep you posted!. Bumping to next week :sadjordan:. @ponelat, I had to eliminate the debounce delay and raise the validate helper delay in order to get this to pass in CI.\nMy changes add a few seconds to CI runs, which isn't a big deal, but if you see another way around this, let's discuss!. There is not, our semantic validation is contained within the Swagger-Editor project.\nThat being said, thank you for mentioning it! We'll take it into consideration as we continue to improve the project.\nClosing for now - if there's anything else, or I misunderstood something, just reply!. PS: there is a library that works as a CLI for extended validation, check out https://github.com/wework/speccy. It's not related to the validators in Swagger-Editor, though.. > @FloWi: would it be a lot of work to create a separate js module?\nIt wouldn't be a nightmare, but the validation system is currently mounted to the Swagger UI plugin system in a few places, so structural changes would need to be made.. hey @mambru, IMO the way you're currently doing it is the best way \ud83d\ude15 Swagger Editor's validation engine is still only available in the Editor itself.. @vnalla, hopefully you can clarify one thing for me: are you accessing your Swagger-Editor through a file:// URI or is your Tomcat server serving it to you?. @vnalla, ah, I see. This is not Swagger-Editor's fault: in order to allow your browser to make requests to a different origin, you need to set some specific browser security-related headers. https://enable-cors.org is a good place to start for this.\nFor more context, check out Same-origin policy.. Closing due to inactivity. \nThis is simply to keep our issue tracker clean - feel free to comment if there are any further thoughts or concerns, and we'll be happy to reopen this issue.. This is technically possible, but would be a pretty heavy change of Swagger-UI.\nGiven Swagger-UI's new plugin system, maybe this is something that could sit on top of it!. Closing in favor of https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/1824. Fixed by https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js/issues/1221.. @jemerald we held off on a Swagger-Editor release last Friday since it (a) had a special release last Wednesday, and (b) has no new source changes since v3.2.5.\nWe will cut a new release on Friday that includes the updated Swagger-Client version. If this is severely impacting your workflow, just let me know and I can run a release to get this out faster.. Hi!\nUnfortunately, your ticket is a bit thin on details as a result of it not following the provided issue template.\nPlease open a new issue, and follow the template. Thanks!. Hi!\nUnfortunately, your ticket is a bit thin on details as a result of it not following the provided issue template.\nWe'd be happy to take a look if you open a new issue, and follow the template. Feel free to tag me in the new ticket so I see it.\nThanks!. thanks @zainkhalid!. Hi @qcarduinoyun! Thanks for the report.\nThe server stub generation actually happens in Swagger-Codegen - you should refile this issue there \ud83d\ude04 . Hi everyone, thanks for the heads up on this! I've just opened a PR that fixes the issue; once that's merged I'll push out a patch release.\nIndeed, the problem was the attempt to use this as a reference to the Topbar component, inside of a named function that was providing its own this binding. I resolved that by making handleResponse a component method, as it makes little sense to be recreating the function each time downloadGeneratedFile is called.\nZooming out a bit, this sort of functionality should be covered by integration tests. We've added many integration tests to Swagger-UI (see for yourself!), and I'm currently working on wiring them into our PR builder (https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/pull/4090), but Swagger-Editor doesn't have an integration test harness as of today. In light of that, I'm going to follow up on this with a ticket describing what we'd need to port or implement in order to be capable of testing Topbar functionality in a live browser, so something like this doesn't crop up again.\n\n\nGetting this as soon as the editor loads\nTypeError: n.slice is not a function\n\n@manoadamro, this sounds like a different issue (I'm not seeing this on editor.swagger.io or my local environment). If this continues after the patch release, could you open a separate issue with more information?. Okay, v3.2.7 is live on npm and swagger.io \ud83d\ude04 everything seems to be working now, thanks again everyone!. Hi @jemerald!\nThis is actually a Swagger-Codegen limitation, so you should open this issue there: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen\nI'm going to close this out for now, but if the Codegen folks kick it back to Swagger-Editor for some reason, feel free to ask for a reopen.\nBTW - thanks for your PRs and issues recently! It's always appreciated \ud83d\ude04. @jemerald, thanks for the note! I brought this up with the team here, and @webron indicated that the Editor is not meant to do the resolution work for the Codegen.\nThat being said - there is the possibility of writing a Swagger-Editor plugin that would send the resolved spec to Codegen instead of the unresolved one. If that's something you're interested in doing, let me know!. @jemerald, as of now option 1 is a non-starter as we currently have some work underway that does away with the resolved spec altogether, in favor of an on-demand resolver interface.\nAs for the others - @webron should be able to shed some light on Codegen support for external references (or lack thereof!). hi @manoadamro, why was this closed? did you observe a change in behavior?. Woah, good catch. I'm not sure how the linter missed this.... Looks like name is a global variable in the browser: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/name\n. thanks @jemerald!. This requires Swagger-Client's changes to be released, so it will be merged as part of the Swagger-Editor release process tonight.. Also worth noting that CodeMirror is doing a rewrite.. thank you @zainkhalid!. This is probably an issue with some recent changes we've made to the resolver - investigating!. @MartinDelVecchio, I just managed to confirm the bug and write a failing test case in Swagger-Client for it based on the API definition you provided, thanks!\nThe problem is indeed in the $ref resolver. There's some specific interaction in the resolution between the definitions you have that's causing a not-yet-available subtree of the resolved data to be accessed (hence \"undefined\").\nStay tuned for a fix! In the meantime, you can work around this by ordering your models in order of inheritance, from highest to lowest:\nyaml\npaths:\n  /path1:\n    get:\n      summary: Get some data\n      operationId: get\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: Got some data\n          schema:\n            $ref: '#/definitions/DataObjectArray'\ndefinitions:\n  DataModifier:\n    type: object\n    properties:\n      prop1:\n        type: string\n    title: Data Modifier\n  DataModifiers:\n    type: array\n    items:\n      $ref: '#/definitions/DataModifier'\n  DataObject:\n    type: object\n    properties:\n      modifiers:\n        $ref: '#/definitions/DataModifiers'\n    title: A data object\n  DataObjectArray:\n    type: array\n    description: An array of objects\n    items:\n      $ref: '#/definitions/DataObject'\nTo be clear: this ordering is not required in the normal flow of things (since object key order is never guaranteed in JS), but while we get this pinned down you can sidestep it :smile: . @MartinDelVecchio - this is fixed! thanks for the report!. Hi @netlander!\nThis depends on swagger-codegen supporting OpenAPI 3.0. They've just pushed out a release candidate that does have support. Once they make a stable release from that RC series and switch http://generator.swagger.io over, we'll enable support in future versions of the Editor!. Closing due to inactivity. \nThis is simply to keep our issue tracker clean - feel free to comment if there are any further thoughts or concerns, and we'll be happy to reopen this issue.. Closing this; looks like the relevant OpenAPI tickets have this covered.. @jemerald, can you link me to a Travis build that failed? I don't see it in the build history :/\nThere is a test that intermittently fails for me locally, it's part of the semantic validation. That system is async, and we use a hard cutoff (60ms iirc) to allow the async stuff to settle, and every once in a while it doesn't make it.. Hmm, that is strange.\nI couldn't get it to happen, so I'm just going to call it a fluke unless it shows up again \ud83d\ude04 . thanks @jemerald!. I think this is great \ud83d\udc4d . Hi @jennaprice!\nI tried replacing your $ref with the Petstore document:\nyaml\npaths:\n  /activity:\n    #I have verified that I can reach this path from my browser\n    #I tried just using the fiel path, they are in the same folder also had an error so I hosted it because per you documentation a url is best way to specify a path\n    $ref: http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.yaml\nand it works as expected, so I'm inclined to think that this has something to do with the content of the referenced file, or how it's being served.\nSome requests:\n- Can you share the YAML file you're referencing? If it's private, you can email it to me (email in profile)\n- Can you share how you're serving it over HTTP (what server)?\n- Can you share a screenshot of the network request that fetches the YAML file as shown in your browser Dev Tools?\nThanks!.

Maybe you would contribute that feature? \ud83d\ude04\nI'm going to keep this open as type: out of scope so that we can hang onto this as an idea for a project that lives outside of Swagger Editor itself.. Hi @maviss385, unfortunately we're not going to be able to help here - this sounds like it has more to do with Docker and Eclipse than Swagger-Editor itself.\nBest of luck getting it working!.

I spent quite some time on this today, it appears that the issue is inside of Ace: the Undo stack is being wiped out and then popped from, which wipes the editor out. Not sure of the root cause yet.... Looks like this was solved by https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/pull/1744 :smile: \n. Yep, this is new, due to the new resolver strategy. \nExpanding the option surfaces the error:\n\n. this is fixed - sorry for the inconvenience @glipman!. @BrenBarn, the Editor is unable to resolve relative references (e.g. $ref: \"./doc1.yaml#/definitions/Abc\") because the top-level document (the one you write in the Editor) has no associated URL, since it's just text content in the Editor.\nRemote references are fine, but you'll need to add full URLs to your references so that the Editor's subsystems know where to look for your documents.. . @webron:\nQuestions & notes\n\nShould Swagger-UI errors (e.g. fetch, auth, parser) continue to appear in the traditional Errors container, or are we replacing that entirely here?\nAre the icon assets used in the mockup available somewhere?\nRegarding 3, it's very easy to add column information to the goToLine call, but the quality of the start marks are limited by the subsystem producing the error data. Semantic validators don't send this data today, and would take a few days to retrofit.\nDoes 9 imply that we should drop the gutter icons, or are we having icons and colored line numbers?\nI don't quite understand what 15 is getting at - on the technical side, it's not feasible to validate one line without walking its entire context today (The AST change-based system proposal would solve that limitation, but that's an entirely different conversation). That said, we can get a 1-2s delay for all errors updating after last user interaction for free, since we do that already.\n\nEstimate\nThis should require 2-4 days to complete.\nItem 17 is a potential snag point - tweaking Ace's internal stylesheets is a dice roll.. @webron yep, s/15/13 and s/17/15 \ud83d\ude04 I pulled this into a text editor when I wrote my questions, and it was counting creatively.. Closing; we don't offer support for the 2.x Editor. \nFixing the errors in your document should get the Codegen working correctly!\n. Yeah, this should be allowed. Per the specification:\n```\nRelative References in URLs\nUnless specified otherwise, all properties that are URLs MAY be relative references\nas defined by RFC3986. Relative references are resolved using the URLs defined in \nthe Server Object as a Base URI.\n```. @pbarbier, not quite sure what's going on here - the validator is in Swagger 2.0 mode, but the output is quite strange.\nI'll look into this in the coming week. Sorry for the trouble!. @pbarbier, I've opened a PR that addresses the case you just mentioned :smile: \nAs for the main part of this ticket, I'm going to backlog it for now, since we tend to batch schema validator fixes and this appears to be closely related to the other difficulties we're seeing at the moment.. @vspiliopoulos @anboo @arpitgarg1 - please note @webron's comment above. If you're using Swagger 2.0 and a non-absolute token/authorization URL, you should fix that!\nThis ticket is still open so we can fix the quality of the errors reported. If you are seeing an error, there still most likely is something wrong with your definition!. Confirmed - going to patch this now.. Fixed via https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/pull/1715\nRelease will be on npm, docker hub, and swagger.io shortly.. Thanks for the report, @liuyikun!. Sorry for the delay - there were some issues with the Docker image builder, which was holding up the Swagger.io update.\nEverything's resolved now, 3.5.1 is live at editor.swagger.io :smile: . Sorry for the delay - there were some issues with the Docker image builder, which was holding up the Swagger.io update.\nEverything's resolved now, 3.5.1 is live at editor.swagger.io :smile: . Yes!\nYou can use Swagger-UI's config options to load in your own definiton: there's url for fetching a remote document, and spec for passing in a JavaScript object directly. Swagger-Editor passes these options directly to its underlying Swagger-UI instance.\nMore info here: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/master/docs/usage/configuration.md#core. . @ponelat any updates here? is this still being worked on?. @ponelat, any updates here?. Confirmed. I haven't found a fix for this, but I have some observations:\n\nThis is not browser specific.\n~This is specific to the JSON representation of this definition.~ I wasn't reproducing this with the YAML that was generated from the JSON with json2yaml, but upon further investigation, the YAML that Swagger-Editor is generating does cause the issue\nSwagger-UI does not have the same issue.\nFirefox shares an error when the thread is killed. The message implies that the problem is within Ace, not Swagger-Editor:\n\nError: Script terminated by timeout at:\nthis.getLineTokens@http://editor.swagger.io/dist/swagger-editor-bundle.js:173:875\nthis.$tokenizeRow@http://editor.swagger.io/dist/swagger-editor-bundle.js:174:23137\no/this.$worker@http://editor.swagger.io/dist/swagger-editor-bundle.js:174:21623\nAce's getLineTokens function does have a for loop nested within a while loop, and drives its while loop condition with a regex, so I'm not absolutely shocked to find out that it's getting stuck on a line with a regex string in it.\nDigging further into this, I logged each input to getLineTokens, and found that it was choking on #/definitions/UserViewModel/properties/email/pattern, which in your definition is a hefty regex string. The startState value was qqstring when loading the JSON representation of the definition, which was odd because startState was set to start for the same line when in YAML.\n\nAll that said - I'm kicking this to next week's milestone, since this is (a) not an issue in our code and (b) relates to editing JSON, which we don't support, though I realize the Import URL feature is causing this by dumping raw JSON into the Editor.\n@webron, I'll sync with you on this on Monday to determine the best path forward here :smile: . Workaround: import YAML instead of JSON :smile: . @webron, indeed... but I have something for you better than a conversation - a fix!\nThis is happening because (a) Ace blows up on folded YAML block scalars that have unquoted regex values and (b) we're telling js-yaml to fold any lines longer than 80 characters (which is the library's default) when converting JSON received from using Import URL. Notably, it does not have to do with the JSON that was downloaded into the Editor.\nHere's a minimal test case that sets Ace alight:\nyaml\ndefinitions:\n  largeRegex:\n    type: object\n    properties:\n      name:\n        pattern: >\n          ^((([a-z]|\\d|[!#\\$%&'\\*\\+\\-\\/=\\?\\^_`{\\|}~]|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])+(\\.([a-z]|\\d|[!#\\$%&'\\*\\+\\-\\/=\\?\\^_`{\\|}~]|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])+)*)|((\\x22)((((\\x20|\\x09)*(\\x0d\\x0a))?(\\x20|\\x09)+)?(([\\x01-\\x08\\x0b\\x0c\\x0e-\\x1f\\x7f]|\\x21|[\\x23-\\x5b]|[\\x5d-\\x7e]|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])|(\\\\([\\x01-\\x09\\x0b\\x0c\\x0d-\\x7f]|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF]))))*(((\\x20|\\x09)*(\\x0d\\x0a))?(\\x20|\\x09)+)?(\\x22)))@((([a-z]|\\d|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])|(([a-z]|\\d|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])([a-z]|\\d|-||_|~|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])*([a-z]|\\d|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])))\\.)+(([a-z]|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])+|(([a-z]|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])+([a-z]+|\\d|-|\\.{0,1}|_|~|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])?([a-z]|[\\u00A0-\\uD7FF\\uF900-\\uFDCF\\uFDF0-\\uFFEF])))$\nFor our purposes, we can disable folding on import to sidestep this issue, which I've just done in #1750.\nI'll follow up with an Ace issue so this gets properly fixed upstream. (Edit: eventually. It wasn't straightforward to reproduce this in vanilla Ace, so I'll have to come back to this another time to build up a reproducible test case.). Hi @rgalanakis!\nThis was a regression in the last version of Swagger-Client, and was patched in the current version (see https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js/issues/1277). Swagger-Editor uses the Client under the hood to fire requests.\nSwagger-Editor has not been updated since that was patched, so the current dist files still surface this problem. Until we release the Editor again (next Friday at the latest), you can pull in the latest Client locally:\n- clone Swagger-Editor\n- run \u2018npm install && npm update\u2019\n- run \u2018npm run build\u2019 to regenerate the dist files\n- open \u2018index.html\u2019 in your browser\nLet me know if this helps!. PS: this error only surfaces when there\u2019s a network error (a refused connection, for example). I\u2019m able to try out the Petstore as I normally would, are you sure you don\u2019t have a proxy or something that would be giving you trouble?\nConsider inspecting the Petstore request in your devtools Network tab to see what\u2019s going on across the wire.. @rgalanakis, I've raised this issue internally - I'm going to modify this issue so we can track this, since the HTTPS->HTTP request was the original underlying error you were getting.. Looks like Ace is receiving some undo events that represent the entire contents of the editor being removed and replaced (with no actual delta in the content):\n\nMy strategy so far has been to unplug custom code from our editor to isolate what the source is, but I'm running out of things... Plan B is to intercept Ace's UndoManager to trace where the bogus undo events are coming from.. Fixed!\nThanks for reporting this, @hsgreen. No idea what I was thinking when I implemented that validator.... @intellisense, SwaggerHub probably hasn't picked up the latest version - please reach out to their support for more clarity on what's going on \ud83d\ude04 . Reopening this - upon further review, this validator is still hitting too hard. See my notes below:\n\nThanks @G-Rath, your example opened my eyes to this problem.. fixed, will ship on Friday!\nthx @hsgreen @maiconmichelon @G-Rath @mminns for pointing out the flaw in this validator \ud83e\udd1c \ud83e\udd1b . Looks like js-yaml is actually letting this be parsed correctly, even though the YAML is invalid:\n\n\n. Closing in favor of https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml/issues/418.. MOAR issues. Hi @hn3000! As you mention, this has been fixed in Swagger-UI but Swagger-Editor hasn't picked up the fix yet.\nWe'll run a release of Swagger-Editor on Friday that will pick up the new Swagger-UI version.\n. Thanks for the heads up, this has been resolved :smile: . Hey @rowshan, I'm going to close this since I don't see anything related to Swagger-UI in your ticket - this is not the place to ask questions about other Swagger/OpenAPI tools, or the specification in general.. CC @ponelat, please review on your side to ensure this doesn't affect you \ud83d\ude03 . Diagnosis!\nParameter values are stored in Redux state, which causes the following to happen when replacing $ref: \"#/definitions/Pet\" with type: string:\n- Before the change happens, the object example value has been stored in application state as the current value for the parameter (so it could be used, for example, if the user clicked Execute instead of changing the definition data)\n- When the change happens, the resolved subtrees are flushed from the application state, which causes the ModelExample component (along with everything else in the operation) to unmount.\n- Once the new data has been resolved, the ModelExample component and body form mount again. Since the parameter already has a value stored (the old example), ModelExample uses that value instead of generating a fresh example.\nThe crux of the issue is that ModelExample has no way to know whether it's mounting for the first time/in response to a schema change (which would call for a fresh example value), or mounting because an operation was collapsed and expanded again (which would call for retaining the previous value, optimally).\nPossible solutions:\n- Always reset the form to the example value when mounting the component. This solves the issue, but would also cause the body value to be wiped when collapsing an operation, which is a slightly degraded UX.\n- Batch the flushing and updating of the resolved subtree values, so that the operation components don't unmount. This is the most correct way to do this, but could introduce some unrelated bugs, so it will need manual testing.\n- Index stored parameter values by a key that would change if the parameter's schema changed, so that these collisions don't happen. Effective and narrow solution, but makes the way we store parameters less intuitive.\n\nI'm going to kick this to next week - @webron, let's chat about this on Monday and decide on a way forward.. Hi @chechecarer, I'm closing this since there are little/no details provided in the body of this issue.\nWe're happy to look into this if you file a new ticket, and fill in the fields in the template.. This was being caused by @kyleshockey/object-assign-deep, which we just started using in Swagger-Client last week (https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js/commit/f328f47d7b0dc87b74f929e162a204118eea2704).\nBabel was picking up the .babelrc file for the module, which contained a reference to babel-preset-env. I solved this by not publishing the .babelrc file with the module, which should have been happening from the beginning (https://github.com/shockey/Object-Assign-Deep/commit/d3b3d7fa159fce26f055c8947b66af34915dc434).\nRegardless - thanks for noticing and opening a PR! We surely appreciate it, and look forward to any future contributions you might make \ud83d\ude04 . @Cloudmersive, I just generated a client from the definition that you linked to, and there's no import statements in it. Are you sure that you aren't mistakenly using import syntax in your project (maybe at server.js:3:20)?. Oops - didn't notice that you were seeing this in SwaggerHub.\nPlease reach out to SwaggerHub support, they can get this through the proper channels for you \ud83d\ude04 . Closing due to inactivity. \nThis is simply to keep our issue tracker clean - feel free to comment if there are any further thoughts or concerns, and we'll be happy to reopen this issue.. Yeah, this is a bug.\nLooks like this has been in since 3.0.0, I'm absolutely shocked that this hasn't come up before now.. @djfdev, a fix for this will go live on Friday! Sorry for the trouble.. fyi @ponelat, you probably have something on your end mitigating the previous state of this.. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-ui#4578. Well this is just silly...\nGenerator3 supports HTTPS, we just aren't using it \ud83d\ude2c . thanks @delmartechdude!. @delmartechdude no problem! Glad to hear it.\nWe run releases weekly, so you should see this fixed on Swagger.io around this time of day on Friday.\nIn the meantime, using the Editor over HTTP should let you work around the issue!. Interesting indeed... If your definition was valid, the Codegen folks would probably love to hear about it: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen. @ponelat, I've stepped the delay up in the past (via process.env.ASYNC_TEST_DELAY) and haven't gotten any consistently good results. I think there may be some other gremlin: possibly something that isn't isolating itself between each instance of the system that's being created? \nAlso, if timing is the issue, maybe a more intricate trailing edge throttle mechanism for delaying the test resolution until n ms after the last state mutation would be better than a static delay.\nI've marked that down for further investigation soon (https://github.com/orgs/swagger-api/projects/1#card-10252668), but I recall you wrote most of the current async test harness - so if anything comes to your mind, ping me and let's try to get to the bottom of it \ud83d\ude04 . @ponelat, I've just merged https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/pull/1786 which uses throttle to resolve the validation test after the Redux state has settled down for a time. let's see where it gets us \ud83d\ude04 . @karunchinna, is the name of your definition Response\u00abAppServerProfile\u00bb?. @karunchinna, Swagger-UI itself does not influence the key names of your responses. If another library is generating your Swagger definition with these key names, you'll need to file an issue with them \ud83d\ude04 . Hi @protegesolutions:\n\nDef files that were fine from months ago are now breaking in Editor. It would be really nice if these back-end BREAKING changes were highlighted to us simple users of Editor (please!)\n\nValidation changes aren't considered breaking changes, because they don't actually break anything. You're still able to generate, export, and render your definition as you normally can.\nWe add validators pretty frequently, in order to encourage the authoring of definitions that follow the standards set forth in the OpenAPI Specification. Complaint definitions result in better compatibility across the ecosystem, which is good for everyone.\n\nSuggested fix is that supposedly invalid JSON is simply escaped as it probably was being previously. No too difficult, really, and saves all this back-and-forth.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean here? Invalid JSON isn't the problem here. I'll assume you meant JSON pointer?\nCare was taken to make sure that non-escaped pointers continued to resolve, even though they should not, in order to avoid a breaking change for users. See this test in Swagger Client: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js/pull/1322/files#diff-12b5bbbad775a24af3453f63f749f2a2R81\n\nif you make the recommended escaping change to the $ref values (in my case [ and ] to %5B and %5D respectively), you end up with broken client-side - and presumably, server-side - generated code\n\nThis is a problem, but the issue here actually lies in Swagger Codegen. Consider opening an issue there - I will follow up on this with the Codegen folks as well. \nHopefully we can get this fixed soon! It's unfortunate that Swagger Codegen isn't following the specification perfectly here, but do note that special characters in key names is a fairly uncommon practice. Things go unnoticed in projects as large as the Codegen, from time to time.\n\nSo, essentially, it's now impossible to use Swagger Editor to generate - at least - C# client-side code and probably most of the rest of the code types.\n\nAgain, this is caused by Swagger Codegen not being able to handle a valid definition when it's properly escaped. The only thing that changed on our side is that we tell users when they're writing something that's invalid now.\nYou can still generate code - you can simply disregard the validation error until the Codegen patches the escaping issue.\n\nExcellent, well-done!\n\nThis kind of snark is unnecessary, and unwelcome here. \nIt's not a lot to ask of you to be constructive and assume good faith, in exchange for support and development from us at no cost to you.\nNo one is trying to ruin your day with these, or any, changes that are made - on the contrary, we strive to make it easier to create OpenAPI definitions that are useful because they follow the rules set by the relevant specifications.. Closing due to inactivity. \nThis is simply to keep our issue tracker clean - feel free to comment if there are any further thoughts or concerns, and we'll be happy to reopen this issue.. @jemerald, my apologies, I didn't see your PR before I created my own \ud83d\ude2c \nYou're right, the async tests are a bit flaky. The issue is not trivial to fix, unfortunately - but it is on our radar.. Hi @AnandHirekatur, please file an issue with the Codegen project about this: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/issues/new\nThanks!. Thanks @jemerald, there's a pending patch for the Codegen to undo the breaking change that moved the definition \ud83d\ude04 . It looks like the Codegen service is sending back an error - please file an issue with that project, since that's a bug on their side \ud83d\ude04 . Hey @nitinguptadr-dori,\nThe Codegen project dictates the file names that we'll save the zip as - please file an issue over there.\nThanks!. There are several validation tests that don't provide version fields - they need to be fixed.\nThere's no Swagger-Editor release this week, so I'll address this next week.. @herozeng you can use the url configuration option to load a definition \ud83d\ude04 . @breakline87, the only reason I can think of for this, is that you're refreshing before the Editor can write to local storage (~1.5s after the last keyboard event). It sounds like this isn't the case, so I haven't seen this before.\nCan you provide some way to reproduce this?. Have you customized your editor? Is there anything going on in the console when this happens?. Closing due to inactivity. \nThis is simply to keep our issue tracker clean - feel free to comment if there are any further thoughts or concerns, and we'll be happy to reopen this issue.. Sounds like this is resolved. As @webron mentioned, this error message is correct.\nFYI @ralfhandl, if you wish to disable this validator, you can use a plugin instead of having to cut custom builds. This should work:\njs\n() => ({\n  statePlugins: {\n    validate: {\n      actions: {\n        // Mimic the built in validator's shape: Function => Function => Promise<Array>\n        validateTypeKeyShouldBeString: () => () => Promise.resolve([])\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}). @ralfhandl, just drop the plugin into your plugins array when you call Swagger Editor \ud83d\ude04 \nFor example:\njs\nSwaggerEditor({\n  plugins: [\n      () => ({\n        statePlugins: {\n          validate: {\n            actions: {\n              // Mimic the built in validator's shape: Function => Function => Promise<Array>\n              validateTypeKeyShouldBeString: () => () => Promise.resolve([])\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      })\n  ]\n})\nAs a reminder: Swagger Editor is an extra set of plugins on top of Swagger UI (see this in the source), so Swagger UI options are valid in Swagger Editor (we should probably add this fact to the README...).\nSee the Swagger UI documentation for more on this option: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/master/docs/usage/configuration.md#plugin-system. @ralfhandl awesome! Just one more note from me here...\n\nWith Swagger Editor 3.x not accepting content that is accepted by Swagger Editor 2.x migration fails in step 1.\n\nNote that Swagger Editor doesn't bar you from doing much of anything based on the validity of your definition - you can still save, Try-It-Out, and use the Codegen service. \nWe add new validators fairly frequently, and we'll probably never have a complete set of them. OpenAPI has upwards of 30 object types, many of which nest inside of one another, so there's a large set of things that we could validate for, that we haven't validated against yet.\nWe never tag new validators (even error-level validators) as breaking changes, our stance is that we only support fully spec-compliant (as opposed to previously-validator-compliant) definitions. I know it's not any fun to think you have a good OpenAPI document one day, and have it flagged the next, but given the problem space that our validators cover it's the best experience that we can provide at this time. \nHopefully this sheds some light on why we do things this way \ud83d\ude04 . This is an artifact from Swagger 2.0 having examples at the code level - you should not rely on it in OpenAPI 3.0.. @younss, yes, this is an unimplemented feature in Swagger UI: see https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/3437 for updates about it \ud83d\ude04 . Hi @kumariannu,\nWe're no longer supporting the 2.x series of the UI, you should upgrade to v3 \ud83d\ude04 \nThanks for the report, though!. @kumariannu, this is legal in OpenAPI 2.0 and 3.0: both specifications say A Path Item object may be empty (citation 2.0, 3.0), to support the security filtering feature.\nSo the lack of validation here is correct \ud83d\ude04 nonetheless, thank you for filing an issue! Reports are always appreciated.. Hey @thesageinpilani, I covered how to do HMAC last year here: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js/issues/1173. Closing due to inactivity. \nThis is simply to keep our issue tracker clean - feel free to comment if there are any further thoughts or concerns, and we'll be happy to reopen this issue.. This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-js#1367. @fleimgruber, this is out of scope for Swagger Editor, but there are projects that do something like this. \nCheck out swagger-ui-watcher!. hi @thesageinpilani!\nthe best way to do this would be to create a base definition for your Invoice, and then create your InvoiceRequest and InvoiceResponse with the necessary extra data:\nyaml\nswagger: \"2.0\"\ndefinitions:\n  BaseInvoice:\n    type: object\n    properties:\n      referenceId:\n        description: This should be unique.\n        type: string\n      description:\n        type: string\n  InvoiceRequest:\n    allOf:\n    - $ref: \"#/definitions/BaseInvoice\"\n    - required:\n      - referenceId\n      - description\n  InvoiceResponse:\n      allOf:\n      - $ref: \"#/definitions/BaseInvoice\"\n      - properties:\n          otherProp:\n            type: string\n        required:\n        - otherProp. Keeping this around as a validation enhancement - the messaging here isn't great.\nAs is with most of these issues, the problem lies in the JSON Schema validator not being smart enough to make guesses about which anyOf a user intended, and instead complaining about not matching the anyOf itself... which is not useful.. @thesageinpilani, this concept isn't directly supported by the specification, but OpenAPI does have form and explode for parameters, so you could use it to define \"sets\" of parameters.\nMore here: https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/issues/256#issuecomment-370538097. @marcellodesales, this is a Swagger Codegen issue, please file an issue here: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/issues/new\nThanks!. @marcellodesales \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f  thanks! GitHub autocomplete strikes again.... @delim29, your OPTIONS preflight request isn't being handled correctly by your server, which is a CORS issue.\nSee our documentation on this here: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/master/docs/usage/cors.md. @SureshKarunamoorthy, are you getting the 403 in Swagger UI, or when you run the curl command in a terminal?. Closing; sounds like a fix was found. \n@SureshKarunamoorthy, if this is still an issue, let me know and I'll reopen this ticket!. Hi @lurumad! You're right, this is not allowed, we just haven't added a validator for this yet \ud83d\ude04 . @lbcsy, it looks like this is working in the latest version:\n\nClosing - let me know if I reproduced this incorrectly!. Closing; sounds like this is invalid.\nThanks for the report, @WAvdBeek!. Gotta love schema validation. Hey @Seavert!\nJSON->YAML parsing is handled by jsYaml.safeLoad. If you'd like to see this, please open a ticket (or a PR!) there, and we'll adopt the change here in Swagger Editor \ud83d\ude04 . This solves the issue for me \ud83d\udc4d . Closing as a duplicate \ud83d\ude04 . > Maye I wrong, but I see the schema as protector for unexpected data to come in/come out.\nYou're correct, but Swagger Editor validates the static content of your schema, not the live responses from your server. If you'd like to prevent any functionality that isn't described in the schema, you should do this server-side. Swagger Editor has no way to control what your server sends back.\nI'm going to close this out, since as @hkosova and @webron have mentioned, the specification doesn't disallow partial coverage of possible responses. Thanks for the report!. @mdegel, you're correct, TRACE is supported. This is a logical error in our validator - it wasn't looking at trace operations when enumerating which operations in a path define a path parameter.. thanks for the report @mdegel!. Indeed - #1819 fixed this. Thanks @hkosova!. @m-mohr, I haven't been able to reproduce this - do you have any idea how to reliably trigger the behavior?\n@jemerald:\n\nIt's probably best to only show the \"Please drop a .yaml or .json OpenAPI spec.\" UI when the things being dragged is actually acceptable\n\nAFAICT, the drag/drop API doesn't allow an application to know what's being dragged until it's been dropped for security/privacy reasons.. @m-mohr aha! That gives me something to go on.

Feel free to reply if you'd like to keep a discussion going!. Hi @bingtimren, thanks for the report \ud83d\ude04 \nThis is, indeed, an error quality issue. Behind the scenes, the validation engine is trying to match your parameter against an internally-defined schema for a Path Parameter Object, but doesn't match because schema is missing. Since it doesn't match, it assumes that it's a generic Parameter Object... so you get weird errors.. @ChristianDavis no one is working on it currently, it\u2019s a pretty general issue with the JavaScript JSONSchema validation libraries. Big thing that we want to tackle, but of course there are smaller, more pressing things.\nIf you feel up to the task, let me know here, and I\u2019ll share some more context..

If you elaborate, maybe I can point you in the right direction.. @Aansh2, since Swagger UI runs completely inside of a browser, it has no idea what's in your filesystem. \nIf you have $refs left in your YML when your server gives it to Swagger UI, Swagger UI will try to resolve it..

Awesome! Glad to hear everything's okay. \nBased on Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <, I'd take a guess that something in your setup is falling back to serving an HTML file if nothing else matches the request (this is a popular way to handle client-side routing in JavaScript web apps).\nGood luck getting everything integrated \ud83d\ude04 . Hi @xct24!\nThe Python error output you shared mentions a problem with an occurrence of oneOf in your definition, but the document attached doesn't have any.\nAre you certain that you attached the right document?. Okay, I think I see now - looks like the validator you're using is looking at the Swagger 2.0 JSON Schema document.\nThis seems to be a bug with the swagger_spec_validator project not being able to consume the Swagger schema correctly, not a problem with Swagger Editor not catching something.\nI'm going to close this for now, but if you file a bug with that project and they think Swagger Editor is doing something wrong, ping me here and I'd be happy to take another look.\nThanks! \ud83d\ude04 . @xct24 ah I see! the project you're looking for is https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen - they're responsible for the code you pull down from the Generate menus!.

This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#9068. Hi @stephenc,\nWe're following OpenAPI for this validator, justified by this:\n\nThe requestBody is only supported in HTTP methods where the HTTP 1.1 specification RFC7231 has explicitly defined semantics for request bodies.\n\nAs is clear in the RFC 7231 excerpt you shared, DELETE lacks defined semantics.\nIn order to have this changed in Swagger Editor, a modification to the OpenAPI Specification would have to happen. As luck would have it, a ticket for this was opened this week (https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/issues/1801) - consider chiming in there!\nOn a more practical note:\n\nFar too many people don't seem to understand that \"has no defined semantics\" is standards-ese for \"FFS don't do this!\" and not \"sure, do whatever!\"\n@handrews, https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/issues/1747#issuecomment-439146861\n\nI don't know enough to argue for or against this opinion of what the standard intended, but it seems to be in line with the opinion of the OpenAPI TSC, since DELETE bodies went from being technically allowed in 2.0 to explicitly banned in 3.0.\nFor more context on this, see https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/4425.. Closing due to inactivity. \nThis is simply to keep our issue tracker clean - feel free to comment if there are any further thoughts or concerns, and we'll be happy to reopen this issue.. Marking as an enhancement, as we don't have $ref path validation at all for OpenAPI 3 yet.. > Auto-complete only works for YAML?\n@arjunballa correct - Swagger Editor only officially supports editing YAML. We highly encourage editing in YAML (as it's much easier to write by hand) and using the File menu to export to JSON.\n\nI don't see OpenAPI 3.0 suggestions. Also I am not able to find documentation on how to open editor in 3.0 or 2.0 or do the switch. Can you please point me to doc?\n\nOpenAPI 3.0 suggestions will appear once you start your document with openapi: \"3.0.0\":\n\nGood point on 2.0 autocomplete being the default though - we should be disabling both until a version is indicated by the user.. Hmm... We should really have this information in the project README. Keeping this open as a request for documentation!. Hi @Qwertie-!\nWe don't provide support for SwaggerHub in this issue tracker, so I'm going to have to close this out. You can reach SwaggerHub product support here.\nFWIW, I happen to remember that this was a known issue in SwaggerHub, which was fixed a couple of weeks ago. If you're still seeing this bug even after emptying your cache, I'm confident they'd be very interested in hearing about this.. Hi @alexfrieden, it looks like you're seeing an error from a generated Python server.\nThis is a Codegen error, so I'm going to move it there for you..

Hi @mkiran18!\nThis is something we're working on currently - you can expect guidance on how to integrate Swagger UI/Editor in React within the next couple of weeks.. Hi @JerryMWeeks, \nThe two versions of Swagger Editor you're seeing couldn't be more different - the first is v2, which was retired in 2015, and the second is v3, our current version.\nCan you share more about how you're consuming Swagger Editor? npm definitely shouldn't be giving you both version 2 and 3.. please build. Hi @stevenbaylor, since this is related to generated code, I'm going to move this to Swagger Codegen \ud83d\ude04 . This issue was moved to swagger-api/swagger-codegen#9172. please build. thanks @yodeyer!. please build. please build. @galvo, there's currently no way to do this within the Swagger ~UI~ Editor container itself.\nIf you need this functionality, the best practice is to sit a request router in front of Swagger ~UI's~ Editor's container and rewrite URL paths into the container.. Interesting.\nWe don't actually change any resolver behavior in v3.6.24, only the way that resolver errors are surfaced.\nIndeed, in v3.6.23 this same error is being reported by the resolver, but is being wiped from Swagger UI's error state a few milliseconds after being added:\n\nThe only change in v3.6.24 is that the error sticks around and is displayed.\n\nI'm going to prioritize this, at least to get eyes on it - this isn't the first time we've looked at nested document resolution problems, but perhaps the additional visibility into the problem that the error message changes give will help triage this.. please build. please build. Sorry for the bad CI readouts here, @hkosova. I (finally) nailed down an async test timing issue in https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/pull/1963, then needed to trigger the build again because a master branch build collided with the final PR run.. please build. please build. please build. Okay, 5 out of 5 builds here are passing. Merging!. Is this needed? Consider switching back.. Undo!. This breaks HMR \ud83d\ude15 . If this is used by webpack, why dependencies and not devDependencies?. @owenconti, apologies for tripping you up here \ud83d\ude2c . \ud83d\ude31 . prefer md to org. is this a magical incantation? \ud83d\ude09 . @ponelat it's the little things \ud83d\ude09 . for https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/1614. This seems fine to me - the plugin system is great for exposing code that someone else may want to override/customize, but I can't imagine someone wanting to write a custom JSON Pointer escaper \ud83d\ude04 . @ponelat yeah, it is done on the whole object - I didn't test .hashCode(), but a pr is welcome! \ud83d\ude04 . Any reason this check was dropped? I don't imagine it could hurt anything.. Looks like this should be onKeyPress={this.onKeyPress}. Looks like this prop/instance method can be removed altogether, actually. Nice thinking here, but, IMO it'd be more idiomatic to keep the function signature () => null (as opposed to the () => () => null here) and use arrow functions in the JSX.\nBoth are better than the current bind solution.. @linelson, why was this changed?\nI'll keep it - a quick Google search indicates that this is the best form of this external. Just curious what prompted the change.. The javascript pseudoprotocol in the href here doesn't make much sense to me - I'm going to remove it.\nIf it's a browser-specific thing (IE maybe?) we can keep it!. minor issue: dangling space here. I'd prefer passing specific callback functions to AddForm instead of making it aware of the objects that the container component gets. Here and throughout, components should use getComponent to get references to each other, instead of importing directly. This allows other users to override component content and behavior.\nIt also gives try/catch/fallback protections to each component, which prevents a render-time error from affecting the entire application.. Backlogging - we have a ticket for stratifying container components already.. Backlogging - this is housekeeping that can be done this week.. This ended up breaking our production build - I reverted it in https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/pull/1902.\n@linelson, let me know if there's a pressing reason to reintroduce this!. @linelson, if you have the time that'd be wonderful \ud83d\ude04 . @ponelat, we do give an afterLoad hook to plugins, would that work for you? docs: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/master/docs/customization/plugin-api.md#afterload.

We have model's where we have nested array's.\nCan you please guide us on how to define models in swagger where we need to support multiple types under items.

Any guidance would be welcome and it will un-block us to automate our process of creating Swagger 2.0.\nPlease find some details i pasted here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32256991/can-i-define-nested-array-objects-in-swagger-2-0?noredirect=1#comment52404417_32256991\n. @mohsen1 @webron @fehguy \nIn that case do you suggest the only way we can achieve this is by having to go with use of $ref . \nIs there any frameworks or libraries that we can use to create $ref schema ? Currently we are using some Swagger-Core libraries to generate the swagger 2.0 spec. Any reference to some libraries or frameworks to create $ref schema would be helpful.\nThe good part is we were able to create nested inline models when all the elements were of type object. We hit the road block when we encountered nested array model.\n. http://coreapiteam-test.apigee.net is a proxy configured in apigee and yes i can definitely define CORS through inbuilt CORS policy that apigee supports.\nBut i tried \"$ref\": \"http://crossorigin.me/http://coreapiteam-test.apigee.net/v1/swagger/user.json#/Person\" \nWhere i used http://crossorigin.me as mentioned by @webron . \nI don't see the CORS issue with this option now but do see one issue.\n\nI don't see Person object in there. Same with Swagger UI.\nUnder Model schema \n\n. @mohsen1 Even after this change to the Person schema i see the same issue where i don't see Person Object.\n. Thanks. One last thing on this issue ,what should be the $ref in this case now ?\n\"$ref\": \"http://crossorigin.me/http://coreapiteam-test.apigee.net/v1/swagger/user.json#??\n. @mohsen1  But when i use this \"$ref\": \"http://crossorigin.me/http://coreapiteam-test.apigee.net/v1/swagger/user.json\" it throws me anSwagger validation error.\n\n. I am using the online Swagger editor http://editor.swagger.io/#/\nAlso when i tried the same on Swagger UI which is deployed local is also throwing the below in model and model schema \n\n\n. @mohsen1  Sure.

I think the problem doesn't come from my file but from from a bug in the JSON Schema validator that uses the schema for Swagger 2.0 that has \"title\" properties along a \"$ref\" property (in /definitions/schema/properties).\n. One more workaround to implement in my preprocessor :(\nNote that swagger-ui correctly renders that model.\n. I don't see any issue in swagger-editor 2.10.1:\n- The body of the request is correctly rendered as a Person object.\n- The body of the response is correctly rendered as an array of Person (where the description says \"Array of products\" which is confusing, but this comes from the input).\n. When importing a file the editor has no idea of the original location of the file on your filesystem: this is a limit of the browser to protect your files.\nFo a similar reason, the editor which runs at http://editor.swagger.io can not access data on another domain or URI scheme such as file:///...\nSo this request is not implementable for imported files.\n. > What about letting the user specify the relative root location on a local filesystem, can that be done?\nAn app running in a browser can't access files on a local filesystem.

    "ChriWiChris": "+1 for the really much better layout in the editor preview than the generated swagger-ui.\nI think it's not that important to export static HTML pages but to be able to use different layouts for dynamically generated swagger.json specs. The layout in swagger-ui has a lot of disadvantages in comparison to the layout of the editor preview pane.\n. Sure. I compare the petstore in swagger-ui (SUI) to the petstore in swagger-editor (SE):\n1. The headlines in SE are way more precise. I find \"summary\" and \"description\" instead of \"implementation notes\" in SUI. Also I find a schema in the response insted of a Response Class (in json there are no classes).\n2. The ordering of elements in SE is much more intuitive since the request params are always on top of the response and its description. In SUI there is a response class on top of the request params which is confusing.\n3. For the testing of endpoints via the frontend SE has a separate section, that only opens if the user hits the Try It Out Button. In SUI there are the input fields in the documentation which is a bit messy and in case of disabled Try It Out Button confusing.\n4. The Description of single attributes in the response message is in SE directly when clicking on the object (like \"String\" or something\").\nIn my opinion this makes SE a more user-friendly API documentation than SUI. As a developer consuming public APIs it is important to have the best documentation about everything that deals with that API, so SE is much more preferable.\n. By the way: if you want to export the preview pane of swagger-editor in a static HTML page, do the following: \n1. Open your YAML with swagger-editor in Chrome\n2. Right click on the preview pane and select \"Inspect Element\"\n3. In the HTML view look for the DOM-element<div ui-preview=\"preview\">\n4. Right click on that element and select \"Edit as HTML\"\n5. Copy all the Code and Paste it into a new HTML file with html, header and body tags\n6. Link to the swagger-editor stylesheet with <link rel=\"stylesheet\" media=\"all\" href=\"http://editor.swagger.io/dist/styles.css\"></link>\nNow you have your docs in a static html file. The only thing you need to do is to write some JavaScript to get the toggling of the operations etc. working. \n. Thanks for your answer, @webron . Ok I understand the different goals of each of the tools. \nWhen reordering the operations in the yaml file swagger editor takes this ordering, so I just have to get them in the right order before loading in swagger editor. Maybe I'll write some script to do that or is there a way to tell swagger in my JAX-RS application to use a special ordering when creating the yaml file?\n. Thank you for the detailed answer.\n. ",

There are Maven/Gradle plugins, a CLI and a Docker Image and template projects available which show how to use it. I think the documentation is also good..

    "SGrondin": "UPDATE: https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc solved my problem beautifully.\nIt's mind boggling that @ChriWiChris 's hack is the best (rather, the least terrible) way to generate static documentation.\n\nswagger-codegen -l html looks awful, the result is not user friendly at all and injects links to helloreverb.\nswagger-codegen -l dynamic-html looks awful, the result is not user friendly at all and requires me to run a Node process to serve STATIC DOCUMENTATION. How does this make any sense?\nswagger-ui is not user friendly. For these reasons plus:\nThe grouping by tags is counter-intuitive. Paths are duplicated if they have more than one tag. The Swagger-Editor does it right.\ndocExpansion should be list by default. Otherwise, users are greeted by a list of tags that don't immediately make sense.\ndefaultModelRendering should be model. The example is more confusing than helpful.\nvalidatorUrl should probably be null by default, this is for visualizing an API, not validating or editing it. I don't want a dependency on the online validator.\nLet me disable the Parameter \"Value\" column! I don't want to make requests, I want to VISUALIZE an API. The Value column takes up a lot of horizontal space and does nothing except confuse users. Give me an option to disable it without having to resort to custom JavaScript to delete it!\n\nI can kinda work around Swagger-UI's issues by only having a single tag per path and setting a few options, but it's still light years behind the user friendliness of the Editor.\nI'm far from the only user interested in using Swagger for documentation purposes. I don't care about Swagger's apparent obsession for code generation. I'm honestly tempted to direct users to the Editor and ask them to load from Url and just use that to visualize... or to fork the Editor directly.\nI don't want to run a server. I don't want it to look like 90s Javadoc. Ugly looking docs don't get read. Docs don't have to be beautiful, but they can't be ugly.\n</rant>. > @SGrondin--wow. Consider joining the community effort by contributing code rather than just complaints. I bet everyone would appreciate that.\nThe language I used was strong. It's nice of you to remind me that we're all responsible for fixing what's broken, however, you might have noticed that there is a disconnect between how people use Swagger and how the tooling assumes people use Swagger.\nI know for a fact I'm not the only one wary of investing time into this when it is very likely the contributions would not be welcomed. My rant is targeted, I list exactly what I think is broken and I suggest specific improvements. The first of which would be to acknowledge that this is a problem that can be fixed, instead of ignoring it.\nRead the comments on this Issue and count the number of people suggesting ugly hacks due to the tooling being unfit. By refusing to reopen this issue, you're forcing the users to work outside of the community and invent their own workarounds instead of investing that time into the Swagger project.\nUntil that happens, no one can \"join the community effort by contributing code\"..

This works in Swagger Editor and Swagger UI:\nyaml\nsome_property:\n  description: My custom description\n  allOf:\n    - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Something'. @meeech A possible workaround to avoid the warning is to move the definitions referenced via YAML anchors to an arbitrary section prefixed with x-, say, x-types.

OpenAPI 2.0 Specification does not state whether OAuth endpoints can be relative. This was clarified in OpenAPI 3.0, which explicitly supports relative URLs in tokenUrl.\ncc @webron . This sounds like #1714. It's supposed to be fixed in v.3.5.1, but it looks like the online editor was not updated yet.\ncc @shockey. See #1714. This was fixed in v.3.5.1, but it looks like the online editor was not updated yet.. This looks related to (or duplicate of) https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/3325.. @shockey OAS3 check for missing items does not work in request bodies and responses, see #1767.. @karunchinna The error is valid. #/foo/bar is a JSON Pointer, and according to the JSON Pointer Specification, special characters in key names must be percent-encoded when a JSON Pointer is used as an URL fragment[1] (as is the case with $refs). So you need to replace\nyaml\n$ref: '#/definitions/Response\u00abAppServerProfile\u00bb'\nwith\nyaml\n$ref: '#/definitions/Response%C2%ABAppServerProfile%C2%BB'\nBy the way, if you will be migrating to OpenAPI 3.0, keep in mind that it only allows the characters a-z A-Z 0-9 . - _ in component names. So Response\u00abAppServerProfile\u00bb is not a valid model name in OpenAPI 3.0.\n\n[1] JSON Pointer Specification, section 6 (emphasis mine):\n\nA JSON Pointer can be represented in a URI fragment identifier by encoding it into octets using UTF-8 [RFC3629], while percent-encoding those characters not allowed by the fragment rule in [RFC3986].\n\nRFC3986, section 3.5:\n\nfragment    = *( pchar / \"/\" / \"?\" )\n\n\nwhere\n\npchar         = unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / \":\" / \"@\"\nunreserved    = ALPHA / DIGIT / \"-\" / \".\" / \"_\" / \"~\"\npct-encoded   = \"%\" HEXDIG HEXDIG\n\n\nand ALPHA = A-Z a-z, DIGIT = 0-9.\nThe characters \u00ab and \u00bb do not belong to the unreserved set, so they must be percent-encoded when used after the # character in URLs.. That's because Swagger Editor uses the online version of the Codegen at https://generator.swagger.io. The online version cannot resolve localhost paths. The solution is, as you correctly noted, to use the command-line codegen.. This is likely the same issue as #1774.. Your example produces the desired output in the latest version of the Swagger Editor at https://editor.swagger.io and does not trigger any errors. But this example does not make sense because schema D is equivalent to\nyaml\n    D:\n      type: object\n      allOf:\n        - properties:\n            field:\n              type: string\n        - properties:\n            field:\n              type: object\n              properties:\n                field:\n                  type: string\nor the simplified version\nyaml\n    D:\n      type: object\n      properties:\n        field:\n          allOf:\n            - type: string\n            - type: object\n              properties:\n                field:\n                  type: string\nand the top-level field property cannot be type: string and type: object at the same time.. The errors are misleading. The real issue is that the path parameter is missing required: true.\nAlso, allowEmptyValue only applies to query parameters but not path patameters.. @delim29 by the way, this response schema is not valid:\nschema:\n            type: object\n            items:\n              $ref: '#/definitions/accountRsp'\nThe items keyword is used with arrays, not with objects.\nLooks like it should be:\nschema:\n            $ref: '#/definitions/accountRsp'. The error is valid. According to the OpenAPI 2.0 specification:\nhttps://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#user-content-schemaReadOnly\n\nProperties marked as readOnly being true SHOULD NOT be in the required list of the defined schema.\n\nThis restriction was removed in OpenAPI 3.0.. Some YAML parsers use y, yes, n and no as true/false equivalents:\nhttp://yaml.org/type/bool.html\nI guess that putting \"y\" in quotes ensures it will be parsed as a string in other tools (e.g. in case you export YAML from the Editor and then use it with a third-party tool).. Thanks for the report! This issue is already being tracked in https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/4442.. OpenAPI Specification says that the responses section does not need to cover ALL possible responses, so technically, the missing definition for the 200 response does not make the Petstore spec invalid or the backend non-compliant.. @KES777 you're right, I missed that part.\n@webron thoughts?. This should be fixed by PR https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/pull/1819. This should fix https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/1818. Could you please post the complete definition?. Unlike header parameters (aka request headers), response headers do not have the in and name attributes - because they are implied from other things. As explained in the OpenAPI Specification:\nhttps://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#headerObject\n\nHeader Object\nThe Header Object follows the structure of the Parameter Object with the following changes:\n1. name MUST NOT be specified, it is given in the corresponding headers map.\n2. in MUST NOT be specified, it is implicitly in header.\n...\n\n\nThe following parts of your example are not valid - parameters can only $ref parameters and cannot $ref components/headers, and, similarly, response headers section can only $ref components/headers and cannot $ref components/parameters.\nyaml\n      parameters: \n        - $ref: '#/components/headers/test'   # <--- INCORRECT\n        - $ref: '#/components/headers/demo'   # <--- INCORRECT\n      ...\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: response\n          headers:\n            ...\n            'Demo-Parameter-Header':\n              $ref: '#/components/parameters/demo' # <--- INCORRECT\n\nIf you want a reusable header parameter (aka request header, not response header), you would define it in components/parameters. components/headers is for response headers only.. type: oauth2 works fine for me:\n```yaml\nopenapi: 3.0.1\ninfo:\n  title: test\n  version: 0.0.0\npaths: {}\ncomponents:\n  securitySchemes:\n    oauth:\n      type: oauth2\n      flows:\n        implicit:\n          authorizationUrl: https://api.example.com/oauth2/authorize\n          scopes:\n            read_pets: read your pets\n            write_pets: modify pets in your account\n``\nCould you post your complete definition? The error might be somewhere else.. Code generation is done by [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen). Please open an issue in the Swagger Codegen repository https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/issues.. Your spec is not valid - OpenAPI 2.0 does not support$refin response headers. You need to replace the$ref` with an inline header definition.\n$ref'erencing response headers is supported in OpenAPI 3.0 though, check out the example here: https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/issues/1586#issuecomment-391128098. Note that reusable headers are stored in #/components/headers, not #/components/schemas.. Thanks, this issue is already tracked in https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/4442.\n\nJust to clarify - are you trying to describe a JSON object send in the query string, like so (before URL encoding):\nPOST /getLabelUrl.action?filter={\"type\":\"foo\",\"color\":\"bar\"}\nor do want to send JSON in the request body? In the latter case, you need to use requestBody instead of parameters.. Thanks for the report! This issue is currently tracked in https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/3325.. The online version http://editor.swagger.io runs the latest version of the editor.\nIf you want to run the editor locally:\n1. Download the latest version (\"Source code (.zip)\") from the Releases page:\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/releases\n2. Unzip.\n3. Open the index.html file in your browser.\nIn this case you only need the index.html file + files in the dist folder, so you can delete other files (src, test, etc.).\n\nOr if you want to run the editor on localhost using node:\n\ncd into the repository root folder, then run:\n   npm install\n   npm start\nOpen http://localhost:3001 in your browser.. @tunecrew you need to change the CORS response headers and instead of\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\nreturn\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: https://app.swaggerhub.com\nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials: true\nFor details, see CORS Requirements for \u201cTry It Out\u201d in SwaggerHub documentation.. Thanks for the report! This issue is already tracked in swagger-api/swagger-ui#4442.. The problem is that the parameter definition is not valid, you can see the syntax error reported in http://editor.swagger.io. Specifically, the enum must be wrapped into schema. Body parameters need a schema, they don't use type-specific keywords (such as enum) directly.\n```yaml\n      parameters:\nin: \"body\"\n    name: \"body\"\n    description: \"Pet object that needs to be added to the store\"\n    required: true\n    schema:      # <------\n      enum: [\"empty\"]\n``\nThe fixed version is rendered fine.. ReplaceoneOf: [a]withenum: [a]`.\n\n\n\nEnums are used to specify possible values (e.g. 'red', 'green' or 'blue'), oneOf is used to specify possible types (e.g. \"either string or integer\" or \"either object A or object B\").\nEnums\noneOf, anyOf, allOf, not. Hi @mindstretch23,\n\nPerhaps might be useful to update the wording of 1st sentence in screenshot a bit.\n\nThanks for the feedback! I'll look into improving that page.\n\nIs there any plan to support examples within components section? Just wondering and then I will close this issue out...\n\nThere's a discussion about this in the OpenAPI Specification repository: https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/issues/1494. Swagger UI follows the Specification, so any syntax changes need to be added to the Specification first.. You can mark the id property as read-only:\nyaml\n      properties:\n        id:\n          type: \"integer\"\n          readOnly: true\nFrom the Specification:\n\nDeclares the property as \"read only\". This means that it MAY be sent as part of a response but MUST NOT be sent as part of the request.. In the body parameter, replace\nyaml\ntype: string\nwith\nyaml\nschema:\n  type: string\n\nEverything else is fine - just make sure the indentation is correct.. Requests with both path and body parameters work fine for me in Chrome on Windows:\n\nHere's the definition that I used:\nyaml\nswagger: \"2.0\"\ninfo:\n  title: test\n  version: 0.0.0\nhost: httpbin.org\nbasePath: /anything\npaths:\n  /post/{GroupID}/{myExtId}:\n    post:\n      operationId: TestMe\n      consumes:\n        - application/json\n      produces:\n        - application/json\n      parameters:\n        - name: GroupID\n          in: path\n          description: Unique identifier of the group.\n          required: true\n          type: integer\n          format: int32\n        - name: myExtId\n          in: path\n          description: Unique identifier of my extension.\n          required: true\n          type: string\n        - name: Model\n          in: body\n          description: testing of body with string parameter.\n          schema:\n            type: string\n          required: true\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: OK\nDoes the example above work for you?. Also, please provide the following information (as required by the issue template):\n\nSwagger Editor version (browser dev tools > Console tab > evaluate versions)\nMethod of installation: [e.g. npm, dist assets, online version at http://editor.swagger.io]\nOS version\nBrowser and version\nYour complete YAML/JSON definition (if it's too long, put it in a gist and post a link here)\nWhat do you mean by \"body parameters are missing\" - are they not displayed in the UI, or are they missing from the generated cURL command, or are they missing in the data that your server receives?. Open a ticket with swagger2-postman-generator and/or Postman instead. These projects are not related to the Swagger Editor in any way.. Yes.\n\nSwagger Editor supports OpenAPI 2.0 and 3.0.. Cookie authentication currently does not work in Swagger UI and Swagger Editor because of browser security restrictions that prevent web pages from modifying certain headers (such as Cookie) programmatically. Please see https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js/issues/1163 for details.. That doc is an OpenAPI syntax guide. OpenAPI Specification allows describing cookie authentications in API definitions.\nSwagger tools (Editor, UI, etc.) are specific implementations of the OpenAPI Specification. Since Swagger Editor/UI are web pages run entirely client-side in a browser, they are subject to browser security mechanisms like forbidden headers, CORS, etc.\nOther tools may or may not have the same limitations depending on their implementation and runtime environment. For example, one of the workarounds discussed in https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js/issues/1163 is to proxy the requests through a server-side application to work around browser restrictions. SwaggerHub does this, so cookie authentication works in API docs hosted on SwaggerHub.. This scenario looks similar to the deepObject serialization style, however, the OpenAPI Specification defines the deepObject behavior only for simple objects (with primitive properties) but not for nested objects or objects containing arrays. Please see these discussions in the OpenAPI Specification repository:\nSupport deep objects for query parameters with deepObject style\nAre indexes in the query parameter array representable?\nhttps://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/issues/1006#issuecomment-289196647\nSo this scenario needs to be added to the OpenAPI Specification first. Once the Specification is updated, tool developers can implement the new behavior.. Please remove name and in - responses do not use these keywords.. ",

Of course oneOf is supported by JSON schema and so it is supported by the YAML editor, however there is an incorrect interpretation of it as rendered in the swagger editor.  I need to define the OAuth endpoints so that they can become implemented, including grants management and token revocation which are not a part of the present version of the OAuth 2.0 standard.  I am attempting to build a \"complete\" interface specification for OAuth provider.  The security setting which you mentioned allow you to refer to the endpoints but do not define the input and output parameters, errors and options providers have to implement these standards.\noneOf will be needed for other REST APIs where the input or output JSON structure varies according to something similar to grant_type in OAuth, or some other variable or condition.\n. Thanks.  I will have a look at the example. BTW the Swagger YAML editor does not error on the oneOf structure: there are no parse errors displayed; it just does not render the variable structure according to the discriminator value input.  I did not paste the entire snippet since it is too long.  I will try to implement using the examples you cited to see if that works with the Swagger editor UI.\n. I noticed that version 3.0 of the now Open API specification, formerly known as Swagger has been released.  Are thre any plans on improving the Swagger Editor based upon the changes in the language specification?. Thanks.  I reviewed the specification again and noticed it was not released yet.  Some of the proposed improvements are verbose and redundant.  The \"servers\" feature: the ability of the user to select the destination of their API request is one I hear as feedback all of the time. I have other comments that would be better to place on the specification feedback site.  I will close this issue.. This worked in Swagger 2.x editor.

    "cbornet": "CI si broken: #715 \n. swagger-editor uses http://generator.swagger.io to generate libs and it is possible to specify the library to use with the \"options\" field in the request body so it should not be much work to add all java libraries to the editor.\nI think this is also a pre-requisite before sunsetting the android generator (see https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/issues/1353)\n. Arf ! Not so easy : swagger-editor gets the client list from http://generator.swagger.io/api/gen/clients which doesn't give information about supported libraries so the generator must be modified first.\n. We can get the supported libs from https://generator.swagger.io/api/gen/clients/java but that will make a lot of requests if it needs to be done for each language. So maybe it would be better to have a resource that outputs all languages with all libraries all at once.\n. Yes. I don't know Angular very much. Is it possible to dynamically open a sub-menu with the result of the request ?\n. A quick google search seems to show that it is possible so this looks like the way to go :smile: \n. @emilianobonassi the codegen already has a resource for displaying options : see https://generator.swagger.io/api/gen/clients/java for instance. So this is just editor implementation.\nGiven my experience with Angular, I'll gladly let you implement this :smile: \n. It is not possible to have different response models for a given swagger operation so that would mean a breaking change in the generator API which I think is unwanted. A new path resource would be preferable I guess.\nAs @wing328 stated, the ideal would be to make the request only when the user selects a given lib : when you click on \"Java\", it sends the request and if the response has libraries, it opens a submenu to select the library. Do you think this is possible ?\n. Seems nice :+1: \n. He will first chose his language, then its library but I can understand your point.\n@wing328 what is your opinion ?\n. I find it less user friendly if you just want to select a lib\n. @emilianobonassi Also note that your approach takes longer to implement since we need to first update generator.swagger.io with the new endpoint.\n@wing328 I can do the new endpoint if we go that way. Do we expose all options or just the libraries name if any ?

OK\n@emilianobonassi Will you be able to parse the first format easily ?\n. @webron OK, this is understandable. Thanks for your input.\n@emilianobonassi That leaves us for now with the request at language selection. Still OK to do it ?\n. I would say that for now just keep simple library selection since it is the subject of this issue and what is the most important. For other options this is more complicated and it should stay simple for the basic user.\nNow, I am not owner of this project so you have to ask to @webron \n. After further study, it seems to me that it is not possible to have the dialog box at the moment since the options types are all \"string\" where some should be \"boolean\" for instance (eg. ensureUniqueParams) and I guess there should be default values for all options so that the user who don't care about fine tuning can just click \"OK\" on the dialog.\n. @emilianobonassi well, the primary idea for this issue was the ability to select the library which IMO shouldn't be an \"expert\" config (on the contrary to the other options). I understand the idea behind your dev but I think this should go in another issue.\n. A lot of people are afraid of using libraries because they are not selectable in the editor. Can we do something about this issue ?\n. Yes there are a lot of ideas and I think most of them shoumd go in other issues. The main and most wanted feature of this issue is to have the ability to choose the library like this.\n. Yes, exactly that.\n. @emilianobonassi are you on it ?\n. Could someone take this ? I really think it's an important/wanted feature.. Is it really an issue with the PR or is the CI broken ?\n. See #715 \n. Well, the current android generator is outdated and I think people should not be given the false idea that they should use it instead of one of the more advanced java libs which also support android. For an android app, I would for instance recommend java-retrofit, not the deprecated apache client.\n. ",

Which will be accessible here.\n```javascript\nexport default function EditorAutosuggestCustomPlugin() {\n  return {\n    statePlugins: {\n      editor: {\n        wrapActions: {\n          addAutosuggestionCompleters: (ori, system) => (context) => {\n            // Remember to concat this onto the existing autocompleters ( assuming you want that )\n            return ori(context).concat([{\n              getCompletions(editor, session, pos, prefix, cb) {\n            // Get path within spec... expensive, be careful \n            const path = system.fn.getPathForPosition({ pos, prefix, editorValue: editor.getValue(), AST: system.fn.AST})\n\n            if(path[0] === 'definitions') {\n              // Cool, we're under definitions\n            }\n\n            // Can be async...\n            setTimeout(() => {\n              const suggestions = [{\n                score: 100,\n                meta: 'on the right side',\n                snippet: 'this will be added, as-is, with snippet functionality', \n                caption: 'match on this'\n              }]\n\n              // Always fire the callback.\n              cb(null, suggestions)\n\n            }, 100)\n          }\n        }])\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n}\n}\n```\n@shockey this is for you too, hopefully something to add to the docs... . also. LEET!\n\n10 points will be awarded to Gryffindor if anyone remembers what LEET is. I should mention example, properties can also contain freely-named keys.. used in src/index.js https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/src/index.js#L1. yeah... but I don't think they're instance methods. They should be static members of Object. Not sure about them.... aha!\nSo we can either import it ourselves via core-js, or just use lodash :grimacing: . This is somehow related to swagger-js and in particular Edge's native fetch. We're getting undefined from the res.body in topbar.jsx, and its causing this.state.servers.map to fail.\n\nhttps://github.com/github/fetch/issues/407#issuecomment-255724541 is a possible workaround.. Yeah for some reason babel-polyfill is only allowed once on the page. It adds polyfills like Promise, Set, etc.\nAnywho, they don't seem to be fixing/changing that in babel-polyfill, so we're currently moving to use the recommended approach of using babel-plugin-transform-runtime. \nYou can follow that over here https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/pull/2959 - its being actively worked on, so given a couple of days, it might get merged - and this issue will likely just disappear. ( we live in hope :) )\nIn the meantime, if you're using a bundler (browserify, rollup, webpack, etc ) you don't need to include the whole swagger-editor-bundle, you just need the plugins it exports.\nSee https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/src/index.js for what its actully doing under the hood. Ie: swagger-editor is just a few plugins on top of swagger-ui.. Still need to ensure swagger-editor works, and cut a release ( likely end of week ).\nBut we're on track! :grin: . @shockey I realized you just added a fix for this :/\nMight need the extra paragraph... unless it works without it?. Please close it out, if it doesn't add anything meaningful.. Yikes... I realized this contains a few tweaks. I'll need to break each one into a PR.\n@shockey consider this a preview PR :grin: . Closing out, in favour of...\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/pull/1513\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/pull/1514\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/pull/1515\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/pull/1516\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/pull/1517\n. NOTE: needs tests... if anyone can write them before I do. I won't hold 'em back :grin:. @shockey no configsSelector PR yet... stay tuned. configs plugin PR in swagger-ui: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/pull/3813. Merge when happy @shockey ( since I imagine you may not want to merge on a Friday, just before a release ).. ping @shockey . bump @shockey . ping @shockey please merge if you're happy. @shockey done :). @shockey this is a big PR. Wanna talk about it?. Fix conflicts. @webron assgined to you, for input on this. \na) It is different behaviour from what we had before\nb) We may want to delegate this to a button in the editor ( or some such ) to allow the user to decide if they want to validate all $refs.\nc) I feel its more a design decision than a bug, but listing as bug due to breaking change.. As a workaround for now, I'm fully resolving the definition on load. Which obviously removes the cool perf boost we got with lazy loading.\nAs a side note on that, validation only occurs on updateJsonSpec. Not on resolving a subtree... I'll see if there's a fix. And log a ticket, with an example.. thanks @webron @shockey \nI see the PR for the invalide local $refs. \nFor my situation I'll need to figure out how/when to validate the whole definition in its entireity.\nBut I can understand how that might be out of scope for this project.. Tests incoming!. laying down some foundation tests here: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/compare/master...feature/add-unit-test-to-editor first.\n@shockey we welcome your comments there. The tl;dr is we're faking ace and writing unit tests. @shockey Yes, slowly surely. Got pulled away, but hopefully can get a chance to push this up. The tests include changes ( relatively minor ) to the editor logic. \nI'll put them in its own PR, will need to think about what to do with this one... :thinking: . Ping back :) Going to close this out this week :crossed_fingers: . yo @shockey this is good for a review.\ntl;dr\n- Adds mechanism to only load yaml into the editor when the origin != editor\n- Adds a fakeAce thing to test ace stuff. \n- That's about it, oh and tests!. @shockey looks like we need to fix the validation tests... when run in isolation, they're good.\nI think its taking longer than the XXXms we set for it.\nThoughts?. Yeah, could very well be a leaky environment. Will need to take a look, hopefully its solveable by just updating the helper method.. Nice one @shockey !. Playing around with this, we still validate against the previouslyCorrect definition. So in addition to clearing the validation messages, we'd also need to block validation when there is a parser error. \nConsider this a WIP..... Yeah, looks like react-dropdzone@2.2.12 broke things :/\nGoing to downgrade that.... @Gby56 that change alone fixed my swagger-editor issues. Are you testing swagger-editor master? Did you restart npm run dev after changing package.json?. Thanks! Apologies for the typos! . good catch. not sure how that got in there.... We should use a filter instead of relying on fn to return the node.\nWe should not pass in the traverse instance directly instead we should use a simple interface for future support...\neg:\njs\nconst shouldAdd = fn({ path: this.path, value: this.value }) // Note  we should probably support some sort of \"traversal\" here, ie: how does one navigate to the parent? this.parent exists, but it would yield another traverse obj... blarg \nif(shouldAdd) { ... }. is toString done on the whole object? It might be better to use the internal hash of the object, which should be unique?. I believe this is addressed by the https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/271a02dd9130a93a3fe7da851fc57c5195dae9b5/src/plugins/editor/components/editor.jsx#L229 change.\nBut simply because I don't know if it has, is why we're adding a bunch of tests based on this file.\nCan be tracked here: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/compare/master...feature/add-unit-test-to-editor. The changes in this PR are all about improving this area. Ie: only update editor when the origin is different. We can include this check if you like, but this check is not the core logic behind our defence against bad re-renders. shucks, I forgot about this... some code needs to call .setup\n@shockey I was thinking we put a hook in src/index.js of swager-ui, an action that runs once after the system is built. . Awesome, that'll do it! Its missing from this PR...\njs\nreturn {\n  // ...\n  afterLoad: system => system.jsonSchemaValidator.setup(),. ",

    "emilianobonassi": "I've not read the swagger-editor code but @cbornet let me point the issue.\nFirst we have to modify swagger gen to output all possible options for all clients/server lib.\nThen parse it client-side and display on the menu.\nMy idea, from user perspective, is to display a submenu for each language which supports additional libraries, i.e. Generate Client -> Java -> retrofit, retrofit2 etc...\nI've developed a project in AngularJS so I'm confident I can implement that feature.\nI prefer we decide how we split the work and then I will start.\nIs it ok for you, @cbornet and @wing328 ?\n. @cbornet , yes, I referred to your suggestion:\n\nWe can get the supported libs from https://generator.swagger.io/api/gen/clients/java but that will make a lot of requests if it needs to be done for each language. So maybe it would be better to have a resource that outputs all languages with all libraries all at once.\n\nAs you stated, it's more efficient (and backward compatible) to optimize the endpoint so it will returns a json with all possible options for every client, may be  something like \"https://generator.swagger.io/api/gen/clients?with-all-possible-options=true\". What do you think?\nIf you want we can implement both, Angular is a beautiful and useful framework to learn. I'm not the top on Angular but I can do.\n. @cbornet , both options are possible.\nI've just implemented the second option, get a look (click on java) and give me a feedback.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/7c49zt5h/2/\n. Anyway from UX perspective in my opinion the best option is a new endpoint with full data otherwise how can you inform the user that options are available for a client/server?\n. Anyway, another idea is to the user the option to insert custom entries in the menu, specifying the language and custom options. By this way, we can modify swagger-editor to fill the menus with data from swagger-generator and from the user custom data. The latter may be pre-filled with the customization we are talking about. What's your idea?\n. Thank you very much for your feedback. \nI vote for the new endpoint and to fill the menu with submenus on the client/server which admits them. It doesn't change substantially the UI, it only adds a lateral menu for those libraries and it appears only on hover (instead of click as in the example). The solution is in the middle between a request for each client and a request only on click but offers a better UX, in my opinion. \nWaiting for @wing328 , if he won't reply I will prepare anyway a PoC in my forks (and send you the link). At the end, he will reply when I will do the PR.\n. Thanks for the answer.\nIn order\n- @wing328\n\nNot sure if the size of the JSON response that contains all the options returned by the new endpoint would be a concern\n\njson size is not a problem\n\nSince you're the one who's making the change, we can go with your approach first and revise accordingly later based on user's feedback.\n\nperfect.\n- @cbornet \n\nI can do the new endpoint if we go that way\nThank you!\nWill you be able to parse the first format easily ?\nYes, it is native in javascript. I would start to parse only the library option for each client/server, then (in another issue I think) we may extend the topic on other options. May be when you click on a specific library you may see a dialog with checkboxes and other ui object to grab user willings. What do you think?\n\n@cbornet , at the end, let me know when the new endpoint will be ready.\n. @webron I understand you perfectly, we don't modify (as now) the API. What do you think about the idea to display a dialog with respective options when the user click on a specific client/server? By this way we don't modify the API and retrieve client options when the user clicks.\n@cbornet , for me  it is ok to do it but what do you think about the latter idea I've just told to @webron ?\n. I will post a jsfiddle/codepen on monday with a sketch of the idea.\n. @cbornet , thanks for the sincerity, I agree with you, before I start to implement something we have to wait @webron .\n@cbornet , you are right about default values but for me the options have to be shown only to experts. I believe that an image/sketch is better than 1000 words. This is my idea: http://jsfiddle.net/7c49zt5h/5/ . Click on one of the clients and watch what would appear in the dialog (for that as I said few comments ago, I will post a sketch tomorrow, modals are a little bit time consuming to implement in angularjs).\nIf you don't press for custom options the client/server is generated as the actual implementation (so without options and not with the default ones which not exists for every of them as you stated before).\nI didn't say before but thanks for your feedbacks to you all.\n. Sorry to be late, this is the sketch of the idea with the real dialog http://codepen.io/anon/pen/ojmyoK . During the week I will implement it on my code fork.\nWaiting for your comments, thanks.\n. @psychowood , store/read options in swagger-editor json config file is it ok for me but not in the APIs description, it should be independent from that, shouldn't it?\n@cbornet , I agree with you that the issue may be splitted in two ones. Anyway I've have some difficulties to think about the UI. Do we remain with http://jsfiddle.net/7c49zt5h/2/ ?\n. @psychowood , very interesting idea, this may be the way!\n. @cbornet , thanks for resume this issue. As you stated, now a bunch of people are calling for it, we can follow the route indicated by @psychowood but I'd like to involve @webron on the discussion to agree on the direction. Waiting for him to start!\n. @webron, no problem for the delay.\nWe can start from the PoC @cbornet linked that I did, than in the future we may extend it with specific options.\nI am going to develop that feature for every language that admits a specific template. I will post a jsfiddle before integrating it in the project.\nDo you agree with me?\n. Great! Thanks @webron !\n. @cbornet thanks for the follow-up.\nSincerely, not actually. I did some work but I stopped. In this week, I am going to understand if I have time or leave the ball. I am sorry.\n. Guys, I am really sorry but I've not time to invest in this project.

You can still take the common properties and use allOf to include them in an extending object to reduce repetition, but still you'd need separate models.\n\nI've tried doing just that with this example:\nyml\nswagger: '2.0'\ninfo:\n  description: Example\n  title: Example\n  version: '1.0.0'\nconsumes:\n  - application/json\nproduces:\n  - application/json\npaths: {}\ndefinitions:\n  InputWithRequired:\n    allOf:\n      - $ref: '#/definitions/Input'\n      - required:\n        - id\n        - number\n  Input:\n    type: object\n    properties:\n      id:\n        type: number\n        example: 53\n      number:\n        type: string\n        example: \"0000000024\"\nBut the swagger validator ends up showing the following errors:\n```\nAPI Errors:\n#/definitions/InputWithRequired/allOf/1/required/0: Definition requires property but it is not defined: id\n  #/definitions/InputWithRequired/allOf/1/required/1: Definition requires property but it is not defined: number\n```\nIs this a misunderstanding on my part or is it a bug in the swagger validator? As you can see the properties number and id are clearly defined.. I see, thank you guys, both! @webron, Sofia is especially sunny and beautiful today so I do understand you.\nIt seems the my misunderstanding stems from the fact that I do not think in terms of JSON Schema. And in the end, is there a way to achieve what I am trying to do? Short of copying the whole model one more time but with included required properties. My real schema models have dozens of properties and supporting nearly identical versions of them with different requirements would border the impossible.. Yes, the example does work in the editor. And also the swagger-ui shows everything as I expect it to. But the schema is nevertheless wrong. You can see that by running swagger-tool validate over it.. Thanks! It does work and you saved me quite a lot of effort. I've never thought to arrange it this way :D Hope this is useful for others as well.. This one: https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-tools. ",

You can't make properties required if they haven't been defined.\n. Too slow!\n. @ironsmile Just for a moment, can you ignore everything I said and go and paste your example into Swagger editor https://editor.swagger.io/  I'm not seeing any errors and it appears to be doing what you want.\n. @ironsmile The JSON schema folks seem to be saying what you were trying to do should work.

When I use the provided example data this would be possible, because it's a flat structure. When there is nested data like in the json-api standard eg. data, attributes, relationships, included... it is only possible with traversing right?\nWhen you say we need to check, if the example is conforming to the schema you mean the type? This could be a bit tricky, because when you want to check a type in js and describe an api of a service, written in a strong typed language this is not possible? Or do you mean something else?\n. ",

Everything else is already working fine with it...\n. For example, this is where you need to check if you should use ? or not:\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/blob/master/app/scripts/directives/tryoperation.js#L572\n. Most of the swagger tools don't have a problem with using path?querystring as \"resource\". In fact, they have no problem treating any {stuff} in querystring as path parameters too, just like they would in the path part.\nAnd that's how we want it if we want to be able to model an API where operations on resources are not uniquely identified just by the endpoint path + http method, but by ?action=something as well.\nSo as long as all swagger-related tools do not support having the same path & http method reused several times with different query parameters without messing everything up at code generation and/or documentation, putting those querystring parameters inside the \"path\" is the only way to deal with this.\nUnless future specs will support other ways to handle this?\n.

Validation still flags this. I like my brace-char wrappers; what do the specs care about the value of the path [when 'parameters:' don't have an - in: path entry]? It's seems like a broken logic to me. Even if there is a way to escape these 2 characters, it's an ugly solution (because, those escape characters, used in another realm, won't be treated the same way). Because of this flaw (sorry, but I have to look at it that way), I'm forced to use the very-much-ugly (in my world) characters such as brackets). Care to comment?. No, I do not use curly braces in my URL. Those are path-parameters to where they are used, but not for the purpose of anything that relates to swagger. If they were, they would be listed under parameters: > - in: path.. You're right: I need to redesign that part, as that conflict is not worth solving. I apologize for the trouble.. Still unrelated to the question, but that JS error that I reported is actually originating from the server (I see the same printed out in the server console). It's passed onto the client, so when I reported it it was because I saw it in the browser console first.\nSourced from multiple files (paths taken from the console): ./index.js, ./scripts/app.js, etc (likely all). Might be something related to Windows version of npm and how it handled creating these files during npm install process (just my best guess). Sharing this info just in case you care about that particular problem :). Please confirm this (rephrased): are you saying that my YAML above is, by design, illegal, and that those description fields should be moved to definitions that their $refs point to, and that swagger-ui should be adjusted to look for those values there instead of where I defined it?\nWhat about those 2 example JSON snippets that I copied over from http://json-schema.org/example1.html (bottom of that page)? They are clearly showing examples of description values acceptable at both locations.\n. I see. Thank you.\nI noticed that @fehguy is involved in swagger-ui project. You two indirectly stated that swagger-ui is the one that incorrectly processes that description as the sibling of $ref. Perhaps he'll want to adjust that there then. Again, swagger-ui ignores description within $ref, but it processes it as sibling instead.. @webron - sorry, I misinterpreted that somehow. Thank you very much.. ",

I assume that this constraint is the result of the view that RESTful APIs should strictly follow a RESTful architecture and each path should map to one resource. This isn't the case all of the time and sometimes an API can be represented in a more concise way by deviating from the REST architecture a little. \nIf this constraint is lifted and a single path can have multiple definitions with different parameters then all current cases can still be supported and it will enable more APIs to use swagger. I'd be interested to hear the counter argument. The only thing I can think is that a stricter specification keeps people from writing sloppy, nonuniform APIs, but I'm not sure if that is the role swagger should play. \nFor completeness, my specific use case is a single path that takes different body parameter types based on a header value. My plan was to define multiple path definitions for each header value and body parameter type pair. I could move the header value that results in a different body type to the path, but I am implementing a spec that generically defines header values independent of the transport protocol chosen. Conceptually, it matches the spec by keeping these as headers instead of putting them in the path.\nEven with this constraint, swagger is awesome. Thanks for the great work.\n. ",

I think my problem was a hickup in the browser anyway. \n. Thanks for the comment. I tested that branch again and it works for me. Could you please give me your steps you did? \nIn my understanding, the explanations of the preferences are a bit confusing (but I did mine the same way as for the others). To write it down: \"Editor Folding needs to be UNCHECKED\" that the sync is disabled. \n(Another thing is that you may have to clear browser cache/local storage?)\n. Thanks for the information. I recently was on vacation and now need to check when I can get back to this PR. \n-  What I did was only to disable the folding sync when you click in the preview. I didn't changed the ace editor part. I thought of leaving it like this. Do you think the folding sync when you click in the ace editior itself should also be disabled?\n- However, as I tried recently to reproduce the issue you have I found something that seemed to be a bug, so I need to have a look anyway.\nRegarding the meaning checked/unchecked, I still think that (analogously to the other settings), that checked = sync is on, unchecked = sync is off should be the behavior. If you stick to your opinion on this, I'll change the name of the setting to \"Disable Editor Folding\" to be more precise.\n. I checked the behavior while doing a spec. It works fine for me, but I always start using the editor with folding sync turned off. Do you fold/unfold with sync enabled and then disable the sync and expect to everything be unfolded?\n. Not following this anymore due to new editor version.. Ok, I understand. \nHowever looking at issues and the swagger world around I thought it would be a good thing as people looking at how to add additional information and get it rendered. The PR doesn't add any specific x- property nor does it render \"all specified x-properties\" by default. The editor behavior is the same as without the PR initially. \n. ",
    "owenconti": "Hi @Winterwind83 \nJust so you are aware, I have an open PR to fix the issue in IE 10 and 11. There is a separate issue (having to do with WebWorkers) that prevents IE <9 from working.\nLink to the open PR: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/pull/877\n. So IE9 does not support web workers and it appears swagger-editor depends on them. I have zero experience with web workers so I don't know how easy a fix is. some quick googling led me to believe it is not a simple plug n' play fix, but maybe someone more familiar with swagger-editor/web worker setup would have a better idea\n. Added a second commit to center align (vertically) the left/right arrows in the splitbar:\n\n\nThere are still other functionality issues with IE10. Eg: if you collapse the splitbar to the left (so the preview is full-width) and then try to collapse it the opposite direction (so the editor is full-width) it breaks.\n. So I can confirm this is due to the Markdown sanitization. My \"fix\" is to remove the sanitization altogether. However, it was obviously put there for a reason (probably because of this issue: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/3163) - but when I remove it, I cannot reproduce that issue.\nSo it may be safe to remove sanitization altogether. If anyone knows of other XSS vulnerabilities that should be present when not sanitizing, please let me know so I can test against them..

    "rapw3k": "Hi @webron , not sure about the response code, I just receive information: ERROR Server not found or an error occurred in chrome and in safari a pop-up window asking for username and password: \"To view this page, you must log in to area \u201cROSRS\u201d on sandbox.wf4ever-project.org:80\". \n\n. I think its 500. See new screenshot.\n\n. In any case, would it be possible for you just to copy my swagger file (at the top) and try to execute to see what is the problem? Thanks\n. I have CORS enabled explicitly in both chrome and safari and it works because if I try the same API call from the editor without authentication it works fine. Was there any possibility for you to try to execute it from your editor ? - The token information is above.\n. To complement.  I tried also using the last solution on the link you provided: Run Swagger Editor in a browser that ignores HTTP access control,..... For example in OSX you need to run the following command:\n/Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome --disable-web-security --user-data-dir\nand when executing the call, I get the pop-up window as with safari, asking for some username and password  (see figure 1), and when I close that windows (as I don't have username password), I get error 401 Unauthorised (see figure 2). \nPlease note that if I don't use the authorisation, it works fine (see figure 3)\nBtw, you can also try it from our swagger UI: http://www.foodie-cloud.org/swagger_ui/?url=http://www.foodie-cloud.org/swagger_api/RO2_API.json (it works without authentication token, I dont know how to provide it from there)\nFigure 1\n\nFigure 2\n\nFigure 3\n\n. Not for me. Exactly as with our swagger editor, if I provide the key I am not able to make the call work using http://editor.swagger.io. Note: It works if I don't provide any key. \n- Can you confirm me if you provided they key? or how did you provide the authorisation header? did you edit the swagger file definition at the top?\n- What was the result got (please paste it here)? The expected result should be only one entry if you give the key, not multiple entries as in the Figure 3 above. \n- If you got one entry, then can you tell me how did you disable CORST in Chrome? I tried both, using the chrome plugin Allow-Control-Allow-Origin, and using the --disable-web-security option.\n- Can you show me a screenshot of the editor after the call? \n. Thanks, I realised what was my mistake: In the api key box, I need to write explicitly the word \"Bearer\" before the key, and previously I was writing only the key.\nMy question would be now how to make the call from Swagger UI? I mean how to pass the token appropriately in the header?\n\n. Thanks, what do you mean by try operation? How to track any progress on this?\n. Hi,\nI think my issue here is exactly the problem described in https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/issues/636 and https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/issues/222. \n@webron mentioned that this feature request was added for the next proposal (Dec 2, 2014). Is there any news on this? \nAlternatively @webron also mentioned that vendor extensions can be used to extend this functionality. Could you point to those vendor extensions?\n. Alternatively, @webron is there any way to send the file in the body, like the equivalent in curl:\ncurl -X POST  --verbose --data-binary \"@aggregatedNoFolder.zip\" -H \"slug: mytest2\" -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/zip\" -H \"Authorization: Bearer 4e5b6138-5885-4c8f-a794-cf368c67a4e4\" http://sandbox.wf4ever-project.org/rodl/zip/create\n. Thanks for the answer, but I am not sure how would you do something like this in the swagger file. I can say that the file parameter is in body, but how to send it ? how would you define the parameter to pass the zip file to the service (e.g., zipfile parameter in the example below) @webron ?\nyaml\nparameters:\n        - name: slug\n          in: header\n          description: Identifier of the research object.\n          type: string\n        - name: zipfile\n          in: formData\n          description: content in zip format\n          type: file\nsomething like this won't pass any file:\nyaml\n        -name: zipfile\n          in: body\n          description: content in zip format\n          schema:\n            type: string\n. The question is how can you send a zip file in a POST method from the swagger file, to achieve the same behaviour as the curl command below:\ncurl -X POST --verbose --data-binary \"@aggregatedNoFolder.zip\" -H \"slug: mytest2\" -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/zip\" -H \"Authorization: Bearer 4e5b6138-5885-4c8f-a794-cf368c67a4e4\" http://sandbox.wf4ever-project.org/rodl/zip/create\nAt the moment I can send the file using parameter type \"formData\", but I cannot say that its a zip file, as the consumes has to be \"multipart/form-data\", so I receive Status Code:415 Unsupported Media Type. With a parameter type \"body\", as you proposed, I don't see how can I send a file.\n. ",

The navigation arrows will then appear to be mismapped, as you expect them to move the box to the previous/next instance. \nOn closer inspection the current instance is subtly highlighted (has a dark grey background instead of black), but that isn't very visible, and wasn't obvious until I looked for it.\n.

For me, this was because Apache was already using port 8080 (could also be Skype or some other program for you). \nTo fix this, I opened server.js and changed line 38 to:\nvar PORT = process.env.PORT || 8081;\nAll working now :)\nIt would likely be better to change process.env.PORT, but for the life of me, I couldnt figure out where that pulls from.\n. @hsgreen  I feel like this is expected behaviour and not a bug. When you apply a security model to to your entire API, there is no reason to list the \"Security\" section at the bottom of every endpoint/path/method because it is assumed that that model applies to all of the endpoints. However, you can override the Security model for a specific endpoint and then it does show because that one is different and it needs to be visible that it is different. \nIn your test case, Swagger thinks you are overriding the default security model on your second endpoint because you explicitly listed a security key for that section. Swagger just assumes since you listed it, it must be different and it should show. \nAs an example, see this definition. Note that UserSecurity is applied to the entire API. Also note that AdminSecurity is used to override the model on the POST method. \nNow, as you can see, the GET method does not show a security section (it is implied since the model is applied to the whole API). You can confirm this by clicking \"Authenticate\" in the UserSecruity section then attempt to \"Send Request\" for the GET method. Notice that the api_key header value is added to the request. Even though the method doesnt explicitly list the  UserSecruity model, it IS being used. \nNOTE: after clicking \"Authenticate\" and typing a random key, I had to refresh the window for Swagger UI to pick up the change\nSeems like \"By design\" IMHO.\n``\nswagger: '2.0'\ninfo:\n  version: \"1.0.0\"\n  title: G-Data API \nhost: homestead.local\nbasePath: /api/gdata/v1\nschemes:\n  - http\n  - https\nconsumes:\n  - application/json\nproduces:\n  - application/json\nsecurity:\n  - UserSecurity: []\npaths:\n  /agent-sines: \n    get: \n      description: |\n        GetsAgentSineobjects from G Data's database of agent sines.

That seems, well odd, No? \nNote, obviously, we must use strings in this line required: [body,details] like body and details.\nBut you are confirming that I can make Notification.id required because its a string but I cannot make Notification.body required because it's an object? . @fehguy gotcha, ok, yeah that's what Im doing now, that does work to a degree but it requires the user expand the nested object to know if any of it's properties are required, I was hoping there was a way to indicate that the object itself was required so the user would know to expand the object. Oh well, thank you for clarifying, at least I know to stop fighting with it lol :). @fehguy Any chance we can make this an improvement request? Maybe show an orange star next to nested objects that contain required properties? . @fehguy Sure. \nConsider the below definition. In the Notification model, the properties title, body, and body.summary have been marked as required. However, if a user looks at Swagger UI, it looks like only the title property is required:\n\nOnly if the user expands the body object do they then see that body.summary is also required and even then, it's not entirely clear. Is body.summary always required, or is body.summary only required if a body property is provided? \n\nOf course, the \"try operation\" understands they are both required and enforces that, but for someone just reading the docs, it's a bit ambiguous.\nPersonally, I would like to see the UI respect the rule required: [body, title] and show the <span class=\"required\">*</span> next to the the collapsed body property itself like this:\n\nThen, if the user expands body, they would see which specific properties it must provide:\n\n```\nswagger: '2.0'\ninfo:\n  version: \"1.0.0\"\n  title: Some API \nhost: homestead.local\nbasePath: /api/v1\nschemes:\n  - http \nconsumes:\n  - application/json\nproduces:\n  - application/json \npaths:\n  /notifications: \n    post:\n      # Describe this verb here.

The other information in the JSON object is used to update Bc4SC's metadata about the blockchain participant.\n\n\n    The signature parameter is based on the JSON object concatenated to the user.\n\n\n    The successful response to this contains a new user ID for the blockchain participant. The new user id is RSA encrypted with the blockchain participant's public key and then base64 encoded.\n\n\n    After clients have switched over to using the use user ID. The DELETE operation should be used to retire the old user ID.\n\n  parameters: \n    [ \n      {$ref : '#/parameters/userId' },\n      {$ref : '#/parameters/signature' },\n      {$ref : '#/parameters/userInfo' }\n    ]   \n  responses: \n    # success response codes\n    200:\n      description:\n        Success.

    "gsi-delmo": "If I mark \"name\" as required in \"user\" representation then it wouldn't be useful to validate an endpoint like this:\nGET /users/123\nwhere \"name\" is not required. As you can see the intention here is to have a representation for reading operations (\"user\") and reuse the set of properties from that representation for writing operations (\"newUser\") marking some properties as required. It should not be necessary to duplicate the whole representation just to mark some properties as required (FYI: I have some representation with more then 90 properties).\nIMHO the full compatibility of Swagger with JSON Schema should be a goal for Swagger team and the community.. Thanks @webron!!! Any idea when the bug will be fixed in swagger-editor?\nAbout the use of allOf with the purpose I am using it, it would be very useful if you explain a little why it wouldn't work as I expect. I see it as a kind of inheritance instead of a merge. So the resource representation for writing operation must validate first the representation for reading, i.e. type, format, even prevent the use of readOnly properties (if I use a swagger validator instead of JSON Schema), etc. then validate the required-properties-schema. I could even extend the representation to include write-only properties (until it comes in swagger 3.0). It works like a charm in JSON schema online validators so I am curious about your statement.. I checked this issue again on the new version of Swagger Editor and it was fixed. Even the inherited properties are shown in newUser model which is really awesome. Good job!\nJust a little issue was found. I named the second model as newUser, however it is shown as user in the UI. Please, see the following image.\n\nThanks!. Sure!

Only few may be aware of \"OPTIONS\" HTTP type apart from POST, GET, PUT and DELETE.\nThis OPTIONS call will be made to the HOST site and it will expect a \"200\" response with \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\" in the header with the full qualified URL of the Client site from which the CORS call was originated.\nTo fix this you handle it on the REST API by defining a new Method to handle OPTIONS call and always return successful 200 response and make sure the HTTP response contains \"Access-Control-Allow-Orgin\" header.\nOr you can do this fix at much higher level like the Application Server or Load Balancer level. \nMy application server JBoss EAP 7 is load balanced by Apache Load Balancer and hence I added the following configuration in the Apache configuration. By doing this I don't have to worry about the response CORS headers and how to handle OPTIONS call in my API. Following are the configuration\n# Always set these headers.\nHeader always set Access-Control-Allow-Origin \"https://[full-hostname]\"\nHeader always set Access-Control-Allow-Methods \"POST, GET, OPTIONS, DELETE, PUT\"\nHeader always set Access-Control-Max-Age \"1000\"\nHeader always set Access-Control-Allow-Headers \"x-requested-with, Content-Type, origin, authorization, accept, client-security-token\"\n\n# Added a rewrite to respond with a 200 SUCCESS on every OPTIONS request.\nRewriteEngine On\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} OPTIONS\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ $1 [R=200,L]\n\nIssue 2:\nThe above configuration fixed the CORS issue by handling the OPTIONS call but still the headers was missing out on the actual POST call\nSo added my two custom headers to the \"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\"\nHeader always set Access-Control-Allow-Headers \"x-requested-with, Content-Type, origin, authorization, accept, client-security-token, Token, EventName\"\nAnd successfully the Headers started coming in the HTTP Request.

I suggest you either add empty lines in the end (in above example you see numbers of lines, so just remove them (I think 30 line will be enough) and leave the empty space - more acceptable variant) or when I export file remove empty lines in the start and end of file.\nHere is the example:\n\nIt's a little fix I know but work with much more comfortable.\n.

    "choran": "Thanks for the response. No, your right, for some reason it does not seem to support that type of input. I assumed it would work via\nitem:\n    type: object\nbut this give me no option to edit the object so its always an empty object. I tried different combinations, even for the basic object, of the above format and it didnt work. I found it strange since it is a fairly basic structure to support.\nDo you know why the editor would not be able to support the way you described? Is it a version issue? Does this mean that swagger does not support sending a user defined json object as part of the request body? (i.e. one where the key and value are defined by the user)\nthanks again. Below is a picture of the issue. I can select any type other than object in the array and it works, sting, int ... they are all fine. But when I select object I dont see any \"Edit JSON\" button or \"Object Properties\" button. So it looks like an empty object in the array. It works fine for the object above where you can see the two buttons. But not when it is part of an array. I am new to swagger so it may be simple mistake on my side but I have tried lots of other options and still get the same issue\n\n. Hi @bpedro \nThanks for the response. Yeah, it is strange even editing the JSON from the above example to add an array directly causes the same issue. I just used additionalProperties as the only way I could see of creating an unstructured object. Is there another way to create an unstructured object that might allow the creation of an array of those objects? I wasn't sure if there was? For the body I am trying to re-create it has to have an array of objects for one of the parameters. So I was trying to see if there was any other way of achieving this or, like you said, this is a bug preventing the creation of any array of object?\nThanks again for the response.. ",

Hi @choran \nI think your approach is the correct one (using additionalProperties). The fact that the Swagger Editor doesn't support doesn't mean that it's not working.\nCan you shed some light here @fehguy ?\nThanks!. @webron Not according to the JSON Schema spec (see http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-validation.html#rfc.section.5.18).\nAccording to it, and I quote, \"The value of \"additionalProperties\" MUST be a boolean or a schema.\"\nDoes the Swagger spec follow something different?.

    "roonyh": "Hi, Is there any reason this file is not published? If its there, I can use webpack script-loader to load it. I can avoid committing it to my source code. Please consider including it. Thanks!. @shockey @ponelat Putting it in a <script> tag is exactly what I want to do. But I don't want to manually download the bundle file and put it in my source control. If I do that everytime I need to update it I will have to do it manually again.\nWebpack along with npm can help save this trouble. There is a specific webpack loader to create script tags and put js files in it. See script-loader. So I can do,\n~~~javascript\nimport 'script-loader!swagger-editor/dist/swagger-editor.bundle.js' // or the correct path\n~~~\nand the script tag is created for me!\nThis saves me the trouble of updating swagger editor manually, since npm takes care of it and the trouble of keeping it in source control.\nFurther its absolutely normal to install client side dependancies via npm. Npm is not only for node.js packages. To quote this post from npm blog,\n\n\n\u201cnpm is only for CommonJS!\u201d\n\nNot true. npm would like to be the package manager for JavaScript, so if it\u2019s JavaScript related, the npm registry is a good place to put it. Node.js provides a CommonJS-esque module environment, but npm has no feelings on the matter.\n\n\u201cnpm is only for server-side JavaScript!\u201d\n\nAlso not true. Your package can contain anything, whether it\u2019s ES6, client-side JS, or even HTML and CSS. These are things that naturally turn up alongside JavaScript, so put them in there. . > My core concern with providing the bundle files in the npm module is that everyone will end up downloading dependencies twice\n\nI understand. But is that a huge problem? Since this is something that happens in the build time.\nA seperate package sounds great to me! I was thinking about that as a solution as well. I think you can automate the publishing of this package so there will be no additional maintenance overhead.. > Oh, also- it's available on npm as swagger-editor-dist :smile:\nAwesome!!

Then the link to edit a specification is http://localhost/editor/?url=/specs/file.yaml. @sureshui18 the 403 error would come from your webserver and has nothing to do with the code above.\nYou will need to make sure you can access the yaml files served by your webserver. Try test it with curl or similar tools. @MattGurneyAMP my post above already included the setup. Here's how things work under the hood:\n\nUser open browser to http://localhost/editor/?url=/specs/file.yaml (if the specs is hosted on a different server from the editor, just need to include the full URL: http://localhost/editor/?url=http://server2/specs/file.yaml)\nThe modified index.html is served\nSwagger UI/Editor downloads the spec by issuing AJAX request GET http://localhost/specs/file.yaml\nUser makes changes in the editor\nThe plugin code saves the spec by issuing AJAX request PUT http://localhost/specs/file.yaml with the body being the entire payload\n\nServer side code would handle GET/PUT methods on path /specs/* to do the reading and writing of files. Mine is just a simple express server:\nvar route = app.route(`/specs/*`);\n    route.get(function (req, res) {\n        // substring(1) removes the initial slash and turns it into relative path, which matches the folder structure on the server\n        let path = decodeURI(req.path).substring(1);\n        res.send(fs.readFileSync(path));\n    });\n    route.put(function (req, res) {\n        let path = decodeURI(req.path).substring(1);\n        let rawBody = '';\n        req.on('data', function(chunk) {\n            rawBody += chunk;\n        });\n        req.on('end', function(){\n            fs.writeFileSync(path, rawBody);\n            res.send(fs.readFileSync(path));\n        });\n    });. This should have been resolved by this commit?. Not 100% sure what the complain is, the latest 3.5.2 swagger editor DO support external JSON reference. Even works with the online version, using the following URL:\nhttp://editor.swagger.io/?url=http://localhost:8080/specs/a.yaml\nThe local setup is a simple NodeJS express server serving content from a folder, with CORS middleware to allow access from editor.swagger.io\nWe don't usually use the online editor, instead, we run a local copy hosted on the same express server. The local copy uses the swagger-editor-dist package and a custom index.html page, which adds an extra plug-in to save the changes from editor via HTTP (e.g. PUT /specs/a.yaml).\nFor the extra plug-in, see my reply on https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/1241#issuecomment-342695807. @carignani You need to open the editor with url query parameter, like this:\nhttp://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://forge.etsi.org/rep/gitweb.cgi/NFV-SOL002-SOL003.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/src/SOL003/VNFLifecycleManagement/VNFLifecycleManagement.yaml\nI have tried the above and the relative file references are loaded properly as you expand the method in swagger UI, see screenshot of the network traffic:\n\nNote: the 404 error is caused by a bad reference in SOL002SOL003_resp.yaml line 95 (extra slash at the beginning):\n$ref: \"/../definitions/SOL002SOL003_def.yaml#/definitions/ProblemDetails\". @shockey thanks for merging the PR. However the latest swagger-editor-dist@3.2.5 still has this problem. Perhaps the published version didn't include the swagger-client changes?. @shockey thanks for the quick response. Friday release is fine. \ud83d\udc4d . @rahulsaini the bug was fixed, but your spec is actually invalid as it indeed has duplicate operationId - getModifiedTerms on two methods.\nThis bug is about the editor showing validation error when there is NO duplicate operationId in the spec.. @rahulsaini the operationId has nothing to do with the path of your API.\nSee https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#operation-object\nFor what you want to achieve, you need to put it into the path, e,g. /searchdynamic/substtype/getModifiedTerms:. @shockey I'm not sure if it is Swagger-Codegen's problem though...\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but as far as I can see, when performing code generation from swagger editor, the editor actually calls POST https://generator.swagger.io/api/gen/servers/{lang} with the swagger spec in the body. The code gen API does its thing, and respond with a one-off link to download the code in a zip file.\nswaggerClient.apis.servers.generateServerForLanguage({\n        framework : name,\n        body: JSON.stringify({\n          spec: specSelectors.specJson() // here\n        }),\n        headers: JSON.stringify({\n          Accept: \"application/json\"\n        })\n      })\n        .then(res => this.handleResponse(res, { type }))\nIn such an architecture, the codegen service only receives the content from the POST request, and would have no idea about the location of the spec file, nor where to find the externally referenced specs.\nThe way I see it working, is for the editor to traverse and merge the external references to a single spec before sending it to the codegen service.\nWhat do you think?. I don't mind give it a try. But I'm not familiar enough with the whole system so might need some guidance.\nHad a brief look though the code in the 3 projects (editor, ui and js) and here are my findings:\n\nSwagger UI uses the resolver from swagger-js to resolve the internal and external $ref for display, the resolved spec is stored in spec.resolved. All the referenced models gets copied inline.\nSwagger Editor used to send the resolved spec to codegen until this change, and now sends the original spec instead\nthe above change fixed issue #1319 (generated code contains models like InlineResponse200), but causes this issue of not supporting external file references\n\nPotential solutions:\n\nRevert to use resolved spec for codegen - this is the simplest option but means going back to the InlineResponse200 problem\nOption 1, plus rework resolver in swagger-js to address the InlineResponse200 problem (not sure if this is possible as it will be a breaking change in terms of the resolved output)\nOption 1, plus modify codegen to take the $$ref field as hint for model name when generating code\nImplement new codegen-friendly resolver to be used by editor when generating code\n\nThoughts?. Problem seems to be caused by the isSubSchema function in schema selectors incorrectly picking up the type node as a sub-schema because it is two levels down from additionalProperties.\ndefinitions: \n  Pet:\n    type: object\n    additionalProperties:\n      type: object\n      properties: \n        type: # this node got selected as sub-schema incorrectly because its grand-parent node is \"additionalProperties\"\n          description: \"here there is the bug!!\"\n          type: string. @shockey not sure why the one test breaks... should have nothing to do with my changes?\nSame test actually passes on my local machine.... Hmm... force pushed a commit subject change to trigger the build, and the test passed (even though swagger-client still throws the same exception).\nHad a look at some historically builds, the same exception was there since PR1656... Any idea?. @shockey here it is, you can find it by clicking on the \"Pull Requests\" tab\nhttps://travis-ci.org/swagger-api/swagger-editor/builds/338293608. Oh, really? So it's a bug in codegen for not generating barProp?. Hmm... I'm a little confused. Examples I see in Swagger 2.0 spec usually have the following structure when using allOf:\nbar:\n    allOf:\n      - $ref: '#/definitions/foo'\n      - type: object\n        description: bar model\n        properties:\n          barProp:\n            description: bar\n            type: string\nThe above works as expected in both editor and codegen, so i consider it the correct way when combining model definitions.\nWhen you say\n\nThe definition is actually valid\nthe definition is not what you intended it to be (even though it's not technically wrong).\n\nHow should the badly indented spec be interpreted according to Swagger 2.0 standard? Does the bar model have property barProp or not?\nCurrently the editor shown both fooProp and barProp in the bar model:\n\nbut codegen ignores barProp. One of them has to be wrong.... Thanks for the reply. Although I think it would be nicer if Swagger/OpenAPI standard would impose extra restriction here to prevent bad indentation.\nClosing this for now.. @shockey the one test that failed on TravisCI does not fail on my local run... This same thing happen with my previous PR as well... These async tests seems to be rather flaky....\nEdit: looks like the same test failed for master branch build :laughing: \nhttps://travis-ci.org/swagger-api/swagger-editor/builds/382452149.

What I didn't understand before is that I can use either the packaged swagger-editor-dist or the full source and the only code change needed was to change node_modules\\swagger-editor-dist\\index.html (or equivalent unpackaged source), and replace the window.onLoad script with what you included above.\nAdditionally as you mention above a simple node express server is needed to act as the backend.\nSorry for any confusion and thanks again for your help and a great project :).\nI may attempt to extend this solution to integrate into a more fully featured backend with more of a workflow around versioning, update history, save on demand instead of automatic etc. If anyone has any ideas on a npm project which could act as the back end Content Management System, let me know.. Ok, thanks @shockey will do.. ",

    "jaydreyer": "Here's some more info based on what I can find:\nIt appears the npm link worked - when I look at the node-module folder for swagger editor, there's now basically a link to a swagger-ui folder. Within there are only two js files in a dist folder - swagger-ui.js and swagger-ui.js.map.\nThis is interesting because when I was working on swagger-ui and fine-tuning the info section, I used all of the .js files EXCEPT swagger-ui in my site. That includes the css. So, swagger-ui-bundle, swagger-ui-standalone-preset, etc.\nFor fun I copied all of the files in my dist folder from swagger-ui into the linked folder, but it didn't have much effect other than changing the color of the title. The things I added to the info section aren't appearing.\nThat's all I've been able to figure out so far. My swagger-ui integration into our developer portal looks great, based on the changes I made. I just haven't been able to get those same changes into swagger-editor. I feel like I'm very close, though.\nOne last thing, and hopefully this isn't the whole problem. The version of swagger-ui I've been working with is 3.0.7. Swagger-editor is the latest - 3.0.9. I'm hoping the difference in versions isn't the issue, although, if it is, I guess it wouldn't be too much work to upgrade swagger-ui.. Thanks, @shockey!\nWell, you were right on the npm link not being correct. I re-did that and now mine shows up just like yours. Any changes to swagger-ui on my end are reflected in the node_modules/swagger-ui folder.\nI have been doing npm run build in both swagger-ui and swagger-editor, so it's not that. I left that out of my steps above, but I've been doing that.\nIt's still not showing my swagger-ui changes, however. I'm going to give up for tonight and try some more things in the morning.  At least I know the npm link is working correctly now.. I still can't get the plugin I created for swagger-ui (that shows up in swagger-ui) to appear in swagger-editor. I see it in the npm linked node module, so the code is there. It just doesn't render in editor. Any other suggestions? Maybe a setting somewhere or something?\nAlso, I want to double check that using swagger-ui 3.0.7 and swagger-editor 3.0.9 should not cause this problem, correct?. In src/standalone/index.js\n```\nimport StandaloneLayout from \"./layout\"\nimport \"../style/main.scss\"\nimport TopbarPlugin from \"plugins/topbar\"\nimport Info from \"plugins/info\"\n// the Standalone preset\nlet preset = [\n  TopbarPlugin, Info, \n  () => {\n    return {\n      components: { StandaloneLayout }\n    }\n  }\n]\nmodule.exports = preset\n```. Great. I went with option #1. That was pretty easy since I had already built it for swagger-ui. Having to keep them in sync will be a nuisance, but not too bad, all things considered.\nThanks again for your help! Now on to custom validation. I just can't make it easy on myself! ;-). Any updates?. Sorry, @shockey. I've been waiting for the swagger-ui update, which looks like it happened today. I'll need to update everything and take a look.\nWe currently validate the extra spec section I mentioned above using joi. Is that an option, assuming I can tie it into your plugin system? I'm trying to figure out how to make this all work without having multiple validation systems. It may not be possible, but I'm not an expert.\nFor even more background, we have about 300 apis, all documented in swagger (300 different swagger specs). We're trying to make it easy for people to create new swagger specs using the new editor, and have the editor provide all of the validation feedback - our special x-api-definition section included. We have a separate validator page they can paste their spec into, but it would be great if they could see it real-time via the validator. If there's a way to tie our existing joi schema into the new validation system, that would be great.. Cool, @shockey. I was on vacation and banished all email. I'll take a look at this and see what I can do. Thanks again for all of your help.. That's fine. We were able to implement custom validation and it works great!. Just to add a bit more info, it's definitely due to both running. Here is a section of my index.html:\n<script src=\"components/swagger-ui/swagger-ui-bundle.js\"></script>\n  <script src=\"components/swagger-ui/swagger-ui-standalone-preset.js\"></script>\n  <script src=\"components/swagger-editor/swagger-editor-bundle.js\"></script>\nIf I comment out or remove the swagger-ui ones, swagger-editor works. If I move the swagger-editor line above the swagger-ui ones, the swagger-ui ones return the babel-polyfill error.. Cool. I'll hold off until the releases are updated.. I managed to get this all working. It might have been a caching issue or something else being goofy, but it's working great now. Thanks for the help!. ",

    "MichaelNeas": "Thank you, so for now the online editor.swagger.io cannot use the accessCode flow with a required redirect_uri .  Do you think that feature would ever be a part of the spec in the future?. What about when there is a public swagger ui and users want to use their app specific credentials to test API calls?  \nWhere a part of the process of retrieving an auth code and access token for their specific app is to pass a valid redirect_uri at both steps, verified against app registration.. Okay thank you Ron!. ",

Whilst it is specified as optional, many Authorisation Servers will not work with authorization_code flow without a redirect_uri specified. For example, we use Keycloak as our Authorization server. The swagger editor will not work with out application because the authorization process fails without the redirect uri.\nAm I missing something here?. I think I understand the playing field a bit better now @webron. So, swagger-ui supports the oauth2RedirectUri as part of its API, but swagger-editor does not support it because the core swagger spec does not define a field for it. So, I guess swagger-editor can wait for the spec to catch up with swagger-ui and then bridge the two, or implement a solution to get half way there?\nI'm thinking your earlier suggestion of using swagger extensions might be a good middle ground until the spec catches up? Something like x-oauth2RedirectUri: 'http://foobar.com'. When/if the spec catches up (let's face it, it must) then the x- could be dropped?. Thanks @shockey for the clarification.

It doesn't work either if I embed the whole string into a multiline structure:\ndescription: \"\n```\n{\n   \"result\": \"OK\"  \n}\n```\n\"\nAfter these ones, I have no more idea how I should create a multi-line description with a code block. \n. @hkosova Thank you so much. I think this is such a valuable information that it would be nice to include in the https://swagger.io/docs/specification/describing-responses/ page of the specification. . Thank both of you, guys. :). Oh, yes, thanks. I did not read the specification carefully enough. Sorry for that.\n. Thanks, I issued a feature request in order to get this way of specifying a constant value:\nhttps://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/issues/1313. Here is my simplified YAML file:\n``\nswagger: \"2.0\"\ninfo:\n    version: \"1.0.0\"\n    title: My API\nhost: localhost\npaths:\n    /auth/account/:\n        post:\n            summary: \"Creates a new user\"\n            parameters:\n              - in: \"body\"\n                name: user data\n                required: true\n                schema: \n                    type: object\n                    properties:\n                        email:\n                            type: string\n                        password:\n                            type: string\n                        displayed_name:\n                            type: string\n                    required:\n                        - email\n                        - password\n                        - displayed_name\n                    example:\n                        email: \"johndoe@gmail.com\"\n                        password: \"abc123\"\n                        displayed_name: \"Pocakq\"\n            responses:\n                200:\n                    description: Registrationwas` successful\n```\nThe example part is displayed nicely in my locally installed swagger-ui in a visually well separated part. \nOn the other hand, the right hand side of the swagger-editor shows the example only as a part of a larger Schema JSON object which I have to open after each changes I made on the left side. So, it is much harder to check the changes in the swagger-editor than it is within swagger-ui. \nAnother difference is that the markdown formatting is displayed in the swagger-ui less precisely. See the was part in the last line of the sample YAML. It is rendered nicely with different colour, backround-colour and font in swagger-editor while swagger-ui renders it without any highlighting. . \n\n. Oh, thanks, I just followed the \"Setup with http-server module from GitHub\" section of the installation manual from the https://swagger.io/docs/swagger-tools/ page where the old v2.10.4 version number is explicitly mentioned. :)\nAfter upgrading, now the swagger-editor shows exactly the same result as the swagger-ui which is much better, it is less frequently needed to save the yaml file. However, it is still needed every time I want to put it into the local working directory (for committing it or just compare it to the original version). So, the hot key (or manual in worse case) based export still would be a nice feature. \nActually, I could imagine a plugin system where one could install/write their own *.js functions in a separate file for some operations. Like this:\nswaggerEngine.registerMenuItem('File/Export as YAML', 'Ctrl+E', function {\n    var yamlContext = swaggerEngine.getYaml();\n    jQuery.post('http://my.favourite.service/for/yaml/processing', yamlContext);\n});\nThis would add an Export as YAML menu item to the File menu of the swagger editor which could be invoked with the Ctrl+E hotkey as well. The implementation is the user's decision, now he used jQuery. . ",

The Swagger Editor fetches at least three different resources from generator.swagger.io on load even when supplied with a local API file. These are servers. clients, and swagger.json.

Using the standard Docker image I don't see a way to easily disable or reconfigure these extended features. Whether or not the people running and maintaining swagger.io actually do anything with that information is irrelevant I think.\nGiven that additional Docker images for the validator and the codegen/generator features exist I thought that the Editor could be provisioned similarly to the UI..

It seems much of the examples I see ask you to specify the parameters in such a way that does not pass validation.

This would mitigate a lot of frustration because there is so much incorrect or no longer valid examples online.\n```\n/my/path/{id}:\n  get:\n    parameters:\n    -name: id\n      in: path\n      required: true\n      type: string\n. . .\n```\nFor me the change was to specify type: string instead of the long form where I was specifying the schema for the type.  I think that is what threw off validation for me.\nThe documentation here: https://swagger.io/docs/specification/describing-parameters/ tells us to describe the path parameters with schema which does not work in the editor.  You must (as of today) specify the type on a single line in short form e.g. type: integer or type: string`.. ",

We have a lot of different model objects and since the models are expanded by default it stresses out the browser trying to scroll through documentation in the Swagger Editor.  Once I'm able to scroll down to the models section and collapse it, scrolling through the API operations is much faster.   For starters, it would be nice to collapse things by default or introduce configuration to allow the editor to do so for models and for operations or both.  I believe something similar was done with Swagger UI.. Thanks @shockey will give it a shot!  This would be very helpful. @shockey works perfect!

By design our spec requires a lot of refs, which does cause the performace bottleneck. An approach that I came up with was to separate our swagger definitions in many different (and smaller) files which is rendered as separate api groups. This may be the best move moving forward without having to remove refs.. @shockey Thanks for the input.

    "ASchmidt1": "Thank you webron for your comment. \nAs I had stated under \"Context\" I am already aware of the available, temporary work-arounds (such as changing the server configuration to be lenient). \nThe motiviation of documenting bugs is to eventually make some of the countless work-arounds obsolete which server administrators have to maintain (and remember) at any given time as the only interim way to deal with bugs in the myriads of technologies they are expected to support.. I suppose we just disagree on the definition or semantics of \"solution\":\nWhenever you have to \"work around\" the fact that the underlying problem persists, by IGNORING THE EFFECTS of the problem - then obviously you have not solved the problem of the imprecise Accept header, you literally have implemented a \"work-around\".\n(If our system intentionally enforces strict with Accept... headers we receive from various external sources besides \"swagger.io\", then being forced to \"open up\" our system to imperfect/non-compliant/vague outside requests is something we might grudgingly accept temporarily - but only until the original technical shortcoming is addressed.)\n. We fully agree - there would be NO problem if */* was used. THAT would be a solution.\nIt would mean that the server is free to serve its default content-type. THAT is perfectly reasonable - the assumption being that the client's operator knows that they are doing and are willing to cope with whatever we'll deliver.\nThat is not at all the same than the client explicitly stating that it can only accept the wrong content type for the format requested. To which our server will respond that it has nothing to match that literal request. Again, our system assumes that the client's operator is competent and it is better for them to clarify their ambiguity.. http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html\n\"Accept headers can be used to indicate that the request is specifically limited to a small set of desired types\" ... \"If an Accept header field is present, and if the server cannot send a response which is acceptable according to the combined Accept field value, then the server SHOULD send a 406 (not acceptable) response. \"\nand I know you do appreciate the unique semantic meaning that \"SHOULD\" has in the context of RFCs.\nTherefore, our server fully complies with RFC2616 by responding with a \"406\" response, because it sending a content-type \"application/json\" with YAML formatted response would violate other RFCs that explicitly define the \"application/json\" content-type as being reserved for JSON formatted responses.\nIt is my believe that the Swagger editor should ENABLE the remote server to implement the application RFCs literally (while I realize that a reasonable work-around is available in the meantime.). I very much do appreciate this now having been recognized as a bug, and a solution being proposed.\nAllow me to comment that the media type chosen is NOT registered \u2013 nor am I aware that such a registration has even been submitted. \nContrary what\u2019s being implied IANA will NOT \u201cget around to\u201d arbitrarily assign a media type. It is up to the group managing the YAML specifications to decide upon - and then apply for - a media type to be assigned. I remember them making the argument that while \u201cJSON\u201d was intended to be primarily \u201cmachine readable\u201d (thus the application/json type), one motivation for \u201cYAML\u201d was for it to be a easily human readable and editable document (thus the text/yaml type being more applicable).\nI therefore question how factual/informed the statement \u201cfrom what i can tell, application/yaml is likely to be the canonical media type for YAML going forward (once the IANA actually gets around to it...)\u201d is. Can the author of that statement support it by citing the pending registration application, or at minimum the YAML specs, that points to \u201capplication/yaml\u201d as the soon-to-come new type?\nI respectfully question the wisdom of Swagger ignoring the specs and standardization processes, in favor of unilaterally/casually implementing a different, unregistered media type?\nFrom: kyle [mailto:notifications@github.com] \nSent: Monday, January 29, 2018 10:41 PM\nTo: swagger-api/swagger-editor swagger-editor@noreply.github.com\nCc: Andy Schmidt Andy_Schmidt@HM-Software.com; Mention mention@noreply.github.com\nSubject: Re: [swagger-api/swagger-editor] Accept header too narray for external YAML references (#1558)\n@ASchmidt1 https://github.com/aschmidt1 , we hashed this out in Swagger-UI recently: swagger-api/swagger-ui#4070 https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/4070 \nWe send Accept: application/json, application/yaml now, does that work for your purposes?\n.

    "protegesolutions": "Helpful, thanks.. This creates problems with generated code. Partial escaped codes are embedded in types. Please reverse this change.. @shockey @hkosova I came across this today as well. Def files that were fine from months ago are now breaking in Editor. It would be really nice if these back-end BREAKING changes were highlighted to us simple users of Editor (please!). @shockey @hkosova Suggested fix is that supposedly invalid JSON is simply escaped as it probably was being previously. No too difficult, really, and saves all this back-and-forth.. @shockey @hkosova Also, if you make the recommended escaping change to the $ref values (in my case [ and ] to %5B and %5D respectively), you end up with broken client-side - and presumably, server-side - generated code:\n    ApiCollection5BString5D AttachmentTags (); instead of ApiCollectionString AttachmentTags ();\n\n    ApiCollection5BCustomFieldCategoryRead5D OpportunityCustomFieldCategories (); instead of ApiCollectionCustomFieldCategoryRead OpportunityCustomFieldCategories ();\n\nThis is because the generator removes the % but not the rest of the escape code: %5B -> 5B, %5D -> 5D, etc.\nSo, essentially, it's now impossible to use Swagger Editor to generate - at least - C# client-side code and probably most of the rest of the code types.\nExcellent, well-done!\n. @jemerald \"2. Open developer console\" - where is this? And can you edit Editor settings?. @jemerald Ah, I see. Thanks. Pity; I was hoping there was a way to change some settings such as packageName or targetFramework. In the end I had to change over to using online Swagger Generator via a small utility app. BTW, this seems much more robust than Editor.. ",

    "axnsan12": "Hmh, yes, it seems this details has eluded me \ud83d\ude04 \nWell, I guess I will have to adapt my regexes then. \nI don't think supporting more complicated regex flavors would be a good idea from a code geneartion perspective (lowest common denominator and all that), so this can be closed.. By the way, for what it's worth, the original regex is still a valid javascript regex, just with unexpected semantics:\n```js\n\n\nre = /^[-a-zA-Z0-9_]+\\Z/\n/^[-a-zA-Z0-9_]+\\Z/\n\"this-is-a-slug\".match(re)\nnull\n\"this-is-a-slugZ\".match(re)\nArray [ \"this-is-a-slugZ\" ]\n```\n\n\ni.e. the \\Z is just interpreted as a redundantly escaped Z, and it actually works just like that in swagger-ui.\nSo perhaps this should still not trigger an error in swagger-editor, though it should probably be a warning like \"javascript regex does not support \\Z as end of input anchor; will be treated as plain Z\".. \\Z in more advanced regex flavors has the meaning of \"end-of-input anchor\" (as opposed to $ which is end of line in multi-line mode) - https://www.regular-expressions.info/anchors.html\nJavaScript regexes do not support this usage, so my guess would be that they want to prevent confusion caused by \\Z suddenly matching a literal Z instead of end of input, since there is usually no reason you would have an escaped Z when you really mean Z. Which I guess would be right, it did catch my error which was exactly that (I was directly printing a python regex into a swagger spec).\n. So in short \\Z is techincally a valid regex, but probably invalid from the point of view of what the user intended, which is probably the reasoning for that error. . ",

If the property is not in the required it doesn't mean it can't be presented in the request\nbecause that's how oneOf works... if you have both properties present in the request, both branches in the oneOf will be \"true\", and therefore, the oneOf check will fail, since oneOf requires that only one of the branches is true.\n. Looks like normal CORS behaviour. Before sending POST request to a different server (\"different\" means a server other than the server in the URL of the page you're accessing), the browser sends OPTIONS and expects to receive Access-Control-Allow-Methods header in the response. If it doesn't, CORS is not allowed, and the real request (POST) is not even sent.. What I meant is that what you're seeing is the normal behaviour of the browser, enforcing the CORS standard. There is nothing the Swagger tools can do about it: if you test your API from, say, swaggerhub.com, or editor.swagger.io, and your test API server is in a different host, then your browser will trigger CORS enforcement..

If the property is not in the required it doesn't mean it can't be presented in the request. > because that's how oneOf works... if you have both properties present in the request, both branches in the oneOf will be \"true\", and therefore, the oneOf check will fail, since oneOf requires that only one of the branches is true.\ntyvm, issue closed.

It is far clearer and easier than \"Clear Editor\" then begin typing.. The view difference is due to bundle.js which contains what you call the older menu, including \"New\" and \"Load Example\", no idea how I ended up with it.\nThe newer code uses swagger-editor-bundle.js which doesn't have \"Open Example\", or \"New\".\nI like the earlier \"Open Example\" and \"New\" - it is user friendly, especially when you need to get team members up to speed..
