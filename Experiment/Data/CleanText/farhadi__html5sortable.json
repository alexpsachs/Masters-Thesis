Thanks!\nI've just made a minor change to make it compatible with jquery-ui.\n. Thanks!\nI removed the fade effect to keep the code simple.\nI'v also updated the code to use only li and div elements as placeholder. other elements might not be suitable (i.e. it's not correct to use a placeholder of type img without src in a list of img elements). This way the bug you fixed in the last commit is also fixed.\n. ",

Hi Phil,\nI don't know if you already received a response to your question.\nNevertheless, here goes.\nThe reason that the \"return false\" is needed is to prevent the default \naction.\nOne of the reasons I added the distinction between draggables and drag \nhandles (the change you put in your e-mail) is that we needed input \nelements in the draggables to work.\nThe first thing I tried (like you) is to remove the \"return false\" part, \nbut that broke drag & drop in some browsers.\n.
