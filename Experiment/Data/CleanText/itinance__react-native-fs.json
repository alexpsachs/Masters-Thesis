    "johanneslumpe": "Ha thx!\n. @KishPatel1996 No. This has been some time ago haha and I had no concrete use case so I closed it. We don't have appending functionality right now afaik.\n. Superseded by https://github.com/johanneslumpe/react-native-fs/issues/19\n. Ok just to make sure that I understood you correctly: you're requesting the ability to pass a node-style callback as last param, yes? Or are you asking for a 100% identical api  (Buffer objects et al.)? I'm not sure how feasible a full re-implementation of the node fs api would be, given the fact that data transfer from js to obj-c is really slow for bigger files.\nAs for passing options to readFile, writeFileetc. - the only relevant part would be the encoding I assume. Currently everything is handled as UTF8.\n. The use-case for this was actually to be able to read data from the caches and document directory and not to provide an arbitrary filesystem-replacement. I can see that some things need to change or should be improved, but I'm not sure whether this module will/can be a full re-implementation of the fs modulle.\n. Yeah sure :) I will try to make it resemble the node api a bit closer at least. \nThat will include:\n- being able to pass callbacks instead of using the promise based api\n- use a generic options object as 2nd parameter for functions\nWould that at least help you a bit?\n. Oh I just copied one of my other projects and then renamed some stuff. Initially I set up my project by creating it manually in Xcode (iOS -> Framework & Libs -> static lib).\n. @agenthunt can you elaborate a bit what you want the shim to look like? Especially since writing data from js to obj-c is kind of slow, it might not make sense to implement the full api. What are your thoughts? I'll take a look at the integration tests as soon as I can!\n. That's a good question. If we provide a node-ish api, then we could use bluebird's promisification methods to create a promise based api on top of it.\nI'm still not quite sure how compatible to the node api we can make this, just because of the fact that a lot of stuff won't work properly via the bridge.\n. I guess this is stale now, closing.\n. Thanks for the PR - checked out the tests, nice! I noticed that if I let a test fail on purpose, the test-runner never finishes. Have you encountered that behavior too?\n. Ok, can you fix that then? :)\n. I just changed the value to compare to to a static value, in order to see what would happen if it failed. The test itself doesn't fail normally, but it would be nice to get this fixed anyway instead of having hanging tests on errors.\n. Ok cool! Let me merge this in for now :)\n. No thank you :)\n. This has been fixed now.\n. That's fine with me for now, but maybe we could mark it as a dev dependency so that you can still do npm i when you want to build the static library on its or when you want to run the integration tests. Could you add it with a  * there?\n. ping @jtremback Will you change this in the PR or do you want me to do this afterwards?\n. Ah well, nevermind.\n. I will take a proper look at this soon. In the meantime, can you fix the indentation? 2 spaces and please don't indent the returned dictionaries. (I know Xcode is like that). Please try to keep the original code style. Thanks :)\n. Using atom + Xcode here.\n. There are indentation issues here:\nhttps://github.com/agenthunt/react-native-fs/blob/topic/fsapi/FS.ios.js#L61\nhttps://github.com/agenthunt/react-native-fs/blob/topic/fsapi/FS.ios.js#L126\nExcessive new lines:\nhttps://github.com/agenthunt/react-native-fs/blob/topic/fsapi/FS.ios.js#L5\nhttps://github.com/agenthunt/react-native-fs/blob/topic/fsapi/FS.ios.js#L156\nHere there are two unnecesary else blocks:\nhttps://github.com/agenthunt/react-native-fs/blob/topic/fsapi/FS.ios.js#L42\nhttps://github.com/agenthunt/react-native-fs/blob/topic/fsapi/FS.ios.js#L46\nI think there are places which can be made cleaner (https://github.com/agenthunt/react-native-fs/blob/topic/fsapi/FS.ios.js#L52 for example. Instead of having the call duplicated, just create an args-array and apply it at the end) but that's stuff we can discuss later :)\nI'm not sure whether I want the promisified api to live in the Promisified namespace. That turns me off a bit - bit I haven't thought of a better solution yet:D \n. Not using it currently, but I could set it up I guess :)\n. @agenthunt I think your last commit made the identation just worse ;)\n. @agenthunt I still haven't set up atom-beautifier, but in general: indentation of 2 spaces that' the biggest issue here ;)\n. @agenthunt that looks much better - somehow I didn't get a notification from github, that's why I'm replying so late :/\n. This will be a breaking change, so let's make it a good as possible before we merge this in!\n. @agenthunt hmm that seems rather odd. Maybe this helps: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6984368/undefined-symbols-for-architecture-i386-objc-class-skpsmtpmessage-referenc\n. Closing as inactive\n. @MattFoley oh sorry for the late reply! I kind of missed this. I don't have time to test this at the moment, but I assume you did? :) I know it's just a tiny change, but just give me a quick feedback: does this still work with < 0.9 ? Was nonnull supported prior to that version?\n. @MattFoley just published to npm!\n. No thank you sir!\n. Hey! Cool sure :) But if you are making changes to for example method declarations make sure that you are sticking with it. Right now some methods are aligned with the: and others - albeit being spread out over multiple lines now - are not ;)\n. @MattFoley no that is it :) Would you like me to give you collaborator status on this?\n. Ok you got it :)\n. Just published with version 0.4.0!\n. Sorry for the long wait - I kind of lost track of this ;)\n. Just as in #13 - feel free to submit a PR.\n. Feel free to submit a pr :)\n. Just published with version 0.4.0!\n. Thanks!\n. Just published with version 0.4.0!\n. Hmm this is a breaking change. I'd like to wait a bit here to see if somebody else has the same issue. Apart from that: please do not declare a local variable with the same name as an argument ;)\n. Closing as inactive\n. @cjdell awesome! I'm totally not a Java guy, but seeing you putting all the effort into this is great! Would love to have cross platform support in the lib. Not sure what the equivalent for document directories etc would be - is there nothing like that on android at all?\n. @cjdell check your permissions ;) I currently cannot check out the demo project, am a bit busy, but I trust that you will do a good job! \n. Let's see about that :)\n. @cjdell have you tested it thoroughly? If so we could cut a new release\n. Because I forgot to push the commit which bumps the version to github :/\n. @cjdell do you want to test this in your app a bit more first before we push out a new version?\n. Let's close this as it has been integrated :)\n. @cjdell Yeah I think that would be fine. For that we then definitely have to bump to 1.0 before shipping. But that's cool with me :)\n. @cjdell I don't think the features of the lib ever changed since I published it :D\n. @cjdell Oh I didn't notice that method before! Cool - did you test it thoroughly? Also in terms of connection errors etc?\nPublishing this is easy yeah :) We can do a 1.0 release.\n. @cjdell oh that's a bummer :( I hope you can figure that out though! :+1: \n. @cjdell Is everything working as expected now? I saw you changed the downloadFile method to an AsyncTask\n. @cjdell https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-fs :)\n. libsqlite3.tbd has nothing to do with this project. Neither should you have to install bluebird on your own if you do not use it. You will have to add this project's library after you installed it.\nPlease refer to https://github.com/johanneslumpe/react-native-fs#usage and post back if those instructions do not solve your issue.\n. @cjdell what do you think about this? Is there an equivalent for Android?\n. @cjdell sorry for not replying here - kind of forgot about it. I think a feature-request thread/list might be useful to consolidate things in a single place and then to figure out what's priority.\n. @superandrew213 not to my knowledge\n. I haven't really worked with CocoaPods, so I will have to look into this when I get the time. Does CocoaPods require an account, just like npm? Does it provide a CLI for publishing easily?\n. @cjdell do you have any thoughts on this?\n. Closing this for now, feel free to re-open if you feel like it.\n. @cancan101 yeah that is an oversight, a sync method shouldn't have been used there.\n/cc @cjdell \n. @cancan101 Where did you see BOOL success = [urlData writeToFile:filepath atomically:YES]; in the codebase?\n. oh :D Ok cool, then we can close this :+1: \n. @cancan101 The data has to be sent from JS to native, and that is done via a string. As @cjdell pointed out, this will be slow for any larger amount of data. The way around this is to employ native libraries which do downloads etc. for you and have their interface exposed in JS land.\n. Published with 1.3.0\n. @cjdell are we set for a 1.1? Is there anything left to test? @demiurga Your build failed with The current version on github?\n@cjdell I'll check out how to do that on Npm :) But we should still have some kind of milestone set up and not wildly publish to npm :D\n. @cjdell I will publish that now but I also added you on npm!\n. @demiurga published as 1.1.0\n. @ms88privat I haven't used this myself but reading the source it seems that all the methods you need are already added there?\nWhat do you want to do with the image? If you just want to read it, there is a method for that, called getImageDataForTag in the RCTImageStoreManager module.\ncropImage returns the tag for the cropped image, and using getImageDataForTag you should be able to read it. Is that what you are after?\n. Closing this due to inactivity.\n. Hey, a little bit of research turned up that there is no ability on iOS < 8 to delete an image from the camera roll. According to https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Photos/Reference/PHAssetChangeRequest_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/clm/PHAssetChangeRequest/deleteAssets you can do this in newer iOS versions but you will need permission from the user to do so. I feel that this is a bit out of the scope of this library though.\n/cc @cjdell \n. You're welcome @skeie \n. Closing this due to inactivity.\n. Cool, thanks!\n. Have you tried running your app in the simulator and inspecting the local storage directory to see whether the file actually has been removed? Is this iOs or Android related?\n. Oh you are recording a video using the camera? Then your issue could be related to this:\nhttps://github.com/johanneslumpe/react-native-fs/issues/34\nFiles in the asset library cannot be removed like a normal file. \n. @cjdell Do you think you can provide the Android equivalent for this?\n. Published in version 1.2.0\n. @cjdell Could you give this a test run? I'm currently occupied with other work ;(\n. @corbt @iwater sorry for the long wait. Have you tested this for iOS and Android? If so I will merge this in :) just give me a short feedback please.\n. @jrichardlai Thanks! I'm not an Android-person but I guess @cjdell has an opinion on this :)\n. @jrichardlai Are you using this in production? I'm inclined to merge this as @cjdell isn't responding. But I cannot test it on my own right now, so I want to make sure that you are positive that this works as expected. Is there anything you think we should add to the readme/docs for this?\n. @wootwoot1234 As of now it isn't. A quick search brought up https://github.com/kamilkp/react-native-file-transfer and https://github.com/booxood/react-native-file-upload - did you try those modules out? Is there any specific reason to not use those modules?\n. @wootwoot1234 Would you like to submit a PR for this?\n. @wootwoot1234 Have you tried out what @mcorb suggested? If uploading files is easily possible with react native's utilities, then I feel that this does not have to be included in RNFS. I'm open to further discussion regarding this.\n. @wootwoot1234 I haven't looked into that functionality at all. But if you can specify a URI, I'd assume that it accepts arbitrary file paths?!\n. @rreusser @wootwoot1234 I still haven't checked out react-native's internal upload functionality. Because if it supports all use-cases then there wouldn't be the need to add anything here. Did any of you try it?\n. /cc @cjdell \n. Thanks!\n. @wootwoot1234 Thanks! I will take a look as soon as I can :)\n. @wootwoot1234 sorry, couldn't take a look yet -swamped :(\n. @wootwoot1234 Now we have a downloadFile and uploadFiles method. What do you think about having a uploadFile method instead, which gets called multiple times for multiple files? Just so that the api stays similar. We could easily implement uploadFiles by looping over the file array and calling uploadFile for each of those? This might also make it feasible to instantly throw an error if the file does not exist because the other upload instances wouldn't be affected\n@cjdell Thoughts on this? How about adding a downloadFiles method too, which basically does the same thing I suggested for uploadFiles and automatically loops over a provided array of url:localFile values? \n. @wootwoot1234 Sorry I currently don't have the spare time to go through this PR and format it properly. Will do so when I get some time.\n. Great, thanks!\n. Had to revert this, I missed that https://github.com/johanneslumpe/react-native-fs/pull/51 was an earlier and more complete version of this. But thanks anyway :)\n. @skizzo I would have recommended checking whether you have write access, but I assume you already did that. I haven't had a ton of time to devote to this project recently. I'll try to look into this and give you some feedback soon.\n. @WestleyArgentum Thanks for the quick response :) Appreciate you guys helping each other out! @skizzo I guess we can close this then? \n. :+1: \n. @yellow066 Sorry, I'm not really into Android. Have you tried to specify a path for downloadFile?\n. Closing as inactive.\n. @magrinj Without more information on your project setup this is hard to diagnose. If you set up a blank app with RNFS, do you get a white screen?\n. Closing as inactive.\n. @grabbou I haven't tried this before so I can only assume what might be happening: If you unlink a file while it is being downloaded, it's possible that ios will either finish the download without continuing to save to disk or that the file might be marked as to be removed internally and will be removed as soon as all access has seized. This is a long shot but right now that's the only thing that would make sense to me given the behavior that you're describing.\nThe download feature was not added by myself and I haven't used it. The note in the readme only refers to the use of stopDownload, which does nothing else but to cancel the connection. But since you are also invoking fs.unlink I'd assume that there might be a weird interference going on, as per my assumption above.\n. @grabbou Is this still an issue?\n. :+1: \n. Are you sure that on a device you are allowed to move files out of the bundle? I'd think that you would have to copy them.\n. @plrthink We don't currently have a method to copy files. Do you want to open a PR?\n. @corbt Thanks! As soon as somebody is willing/able to test this on Android, I will merge it in.\n. @cjdell Can you maybe give this a try? Would like to get this merged in too :)\n. Thanks!\n. @bomalley Sorry, I'm not very well versed with Android. I'll leave this issue open, so maybe someone else is able to help.\n. @9mm sorry I didn't have any time to investigate this. Does it still not work for you?\n. @cjdell This is another one to maybe give a test :)\n. cc @cjdell (he implemented this)\n. This looks good to me, let's see if @cjdell will comment here too :) Else I will merge this in soon.\n. @cancan101 what's the result on iOS? What is your expected result here?\n. This should work as of version 1.5.0.\n. @andreacab Do you mean the temporary directory on iOS? (NSTemporaryDirectory)  That is not implemented at the moment but I'm sure it could be added. Do you know whether there is a temporary directory available on Android too?\n. @jeduan I'm not sure that just skipping the files is expected behavior. This is like silently failing, which might be even more confusing to users?\n. When this error occurs, that means that we cannot read any file in the directory, right? Because it would always break for those files. I think instead of skipping over those files or just failing hard, we might want to send an object with the filename and a custom error prop, so we can continue with the rest but the user will still know that the file failed. Then the user itself could filter the result to get rid of those files from the list maybe? What do you think about that? Just a suggestion though, nothing set in stone.\n. @jeduan Did you ever get around to add the custom error object instead of just skipping over a file?\n. Thanks!\n. @paulondc Is there anything we can do here?\n. @paulondc I'm not sure that this really belongs into the library. I'd kind of like to open this one up for discussion and see if other people think it's useful before we make a decision on this.\n. @af this is a limitation of iOS - when your app goes into background any activity is stopped. What is the exact error you are receiving?\n. @af It will require some code changes but without looking further into it I'd assume it is definitely possible. A downside I see is that it looks like iOS then will re-launch your app when the download completes which might not be a behavior people expect by default. (I might be reading that one wrong though).\n. Closing as this is possible as of version 1.5.0\n. @yulinho you are welcome to send a PR for this.\n. @faceyspacey I didn't include it at the time because I just didn't think about it. Nowadays I just lack time.\n. Fixed with 6d129706572c8674977280839634a32b160d88eb\n. @benvium thanks for this! I currently don't have time to test this so I have to rely on you to confirm that it's 100%. A thought though: on iOS you also cannot edit files within a bundle, you'd have to copy them to your documents directory first. Is this something we can/should incorporate here? It seems to me that it would achieve a similar goal for iOS. Feel free to correct me if you think I'm wrong or have a better idea :)\n. @benvium I've sent you a collaboration invite, feel free to merge this in!\n. Done!\n. @dabrut Is there any difference in declaring React/Core vs React as in  https://github.com/johanneslumpe/react-native-fs/pull/82 ?\n. @cjdell got time to test this?\n. @grabbou If it cleans up the code base, then by all means, why not. Are there performance drawbacks?\n. @grabbou I think I just screwed up the github release ;) I usually bump versions in the package.json. Somehow something went wrong with that release, not sure what. But yes, those should be in sync...\n. @grabbou I do not have time to test all these and since we don't have automated tests it would be great to make sure that everything works as expected.\ncc @cjdell \n. @grabbou any updates on this? would be cool to get this out with 1.5 I think :)\n. @grabbou No worries, that wasn't an inquiry in order to put pressure on you :) Just checking in.\n. @grabbou Did you make any progress on this or is this pr stale?\n. @grabbou sounds good to me. If NativeAppEventEmitter works for both iOS and Android, I'm all for just using that one.\nThanks for catching that bug, definitely not cool for those listeners to override each other and hog memory like that. Looking forward to the PR :)\n. @tristola thanks. I do not have time to confirm whether the directory exists on both. Would be great if you were able to check and report back here.\n. This should have been resolved with the latest version (1.5)\n. Thoughts on this? cc @grabbou @cjdell \n. This seems fine to me. Thoughts @cjdell ? I'm not sure as to whether getReactApplicationContext is an important part here and maybe shouldn't be ignored. (Despite the fact that something seems off)\n. @kitolog Thanks!\n@grabbou @cjdell Thoughts?\n@kitolog Please do not increment the package version in your PR. (apart from that: this would be a minor version change and not a patch, as it adds a feature)\n. @charliesbox as per my comment above I am waiting to receive some feedback from @grabbou and @cjdell. Also please note that there is a pending change to not increment version number ;) Furthermore this PR needs to be rebased against master as there have been changes todownloadFile.\n. @cdmalcl I'm sorry but could you please re-phrase your issue properly? :)\n. Is this still an issue with the new 1.5 release?\n. @mkraft are you linking the project correctly? It seems a bit weird to me, because else we'd have quite a few more issues about this.\n. Unfortunately I cannot set aside any of my time to work on this library :/\n. @cjdell Did we merge breaking changes? If so, we'll have to release 2.0, else 1.5\n. @cjdell ok cool 1.5 it is!\n. Just published 1.5.0 to npm.\n. Thanks!\n. @cjdell @insraq This is not just sort of a breaking change, it is definitely one ;) This could be a non-breaking change if we still kept the response entry in the dictionary. Thoughts?\n. @K0rdan great! As @IjzerenHein mentioned, it would be great to get this in for Android too, so we have feature parity on this one :) Is that something you could look into?\n. @cjdell Is there anything else you want to merge in or should we cut a release?\n. @cjdell Thoughts on this? This would be a breaking change.\n. The way to do that right now is, like you already mentioned, looping over the contents and removing each file on its own.\n. Thanks! Sorry, was on vacation :) Why are you printing the stack trace before sending back the error on Android? Is that an Android best practice? Just wondering if there are any downsides to it in terms of performance (if it is not required)\nLooks good to me in general though!\n. @superandrew213 Ah ok - I didn't write any of the Android stuff. @cjdell can you shed some light on this?\n. @superandrew213 sure, fine with me!\n. I have to direct this to @cjdell as I haven't written any of the Android code.\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. @cjdell wouldn't that put quite a burden onto the users of the lib? If there are equivalent attributes for Android and iOS, maybe we should abstract them away for the users and create a generic wrapper? Why do you think it may be impossible to find a suitable abstraction?\n. @cjdell I really do not remember haha. I originally wrote the library for fun, not because i actually needed it. Someone was asking for it and I had nothing better to do ;) I think we should see which of those have a matching attribute on Android and then go with that subset. We might be able to support others using OS-specific methods, but it would be great to have at least a cross-platform subset working.\n. @cjdell I completely agree! I think we shouldn't push v2 back for too long, as we already have a lot of new features in master which aren't accessible via npm. Thoughts on an ETA?\n. @cjdell That would be amazing. I know I haven't done any work in recent times on this, but I'm so busy with other stuff in life at the moment :/ Eventually I will come back to this though ;)\n. @cjdell https://github.com/johanneslumpe/react-native-fs/issues/148 is already fixed in the laster master, right?\n. @cjdell How much more testing should we do on this? I won't be able to test (have no project using RN atm..)\n. @cjdell @CesarLanderos I just published a release candidate to npm: 2.0.1.-rc.1\n. and just published to npm!\n. I have no time to fix this at the moment, but a proper PR is always welcome :)\n. @francisco-sanchez-molina thanks for this. what does setReadTimeout do exactly? Does it time out if no data is read at all, or does it also timeout if some data is read and the connection subsequently fails in the middle of the download?\n. Ha, nice! Thanks!\n. @bhumit1709 Did you by any chance post on the wrong repo?\n. No worries :)\n. @amibition521 I assume you are posting on the wrong repository?\n. @amibition521 You are trying to download the same file twice? If so, have you tried to remove the original file first? I'm not sure if overwriting will just work.\n. Closing this due to inactivity.\n. This does not seem to be related to this library. Seems like an issue with react native itself?\n. Closing because of inactivity.\n. @macdabby I agree that this would be a nice addition. Right now I cannot devote any time to this though. Feel like submitting a PR to add this functionality for both iOS and Android?\n. Thanks! I I'm not sure if scanFile is the appropriate method name to use here, since it does not scan for all files, but only a subset.\nThoughts @cjdell ?\n. No, the library does not support this as of now. Feel free to submit a PR for this functionality for iOS and Android though.\n. @cjdell my oh my, how could I miss that :D ok great, closing!\n. @gauravbhusare have you checked which headers are transmitted to your server? Is the issue that no headers arrive or is it something else?\n. @gauravbhusare If the headers are sent as expected, why are you assuming that it's an issue with the library? What do you mean by \"user\" object? What kind of user would fetch send automatically? \n. The method returns a promise, it is not synchronous. You will have to chain .then and .catch to  deal with the result.\n. @prabhaav I'm not an Android dev so I cannot tell you exactly whether Android can determine the availability of files in the asset library using file.exists(). You might have to use the AssetManager api directly, which is not supported by this library at the moment. @cjdell any ideas?\n. @prabhaav ah ok. I just assumed that you were using Android. The library supports both but it seems that also in iOS you cannot check for asset existence using the file manager api. A very quick search turned up the information that you have to use the ALAssetsLibrary framework for that, which again is not supported at the moment.\nI'd accept a PR which adds the functionality to check for assets for both iOS and Android to the exists method.\n. You never propagate the error. What exactly do you mean by \"getting stuck\"?\n. Closing because of inactivity.\n. A PR for this is welcome - I have no time currently to fix things.\n. @fgrs are you sure that the URI is supposed to only start with file: instead of file://? Can you access the same URI using native Java code?\n. @fgrs ok, so then this is not an issue with RNFS I assume :) Feel free to reopen if you still think that we can do something here.\n. Just openly accepting all https certificates kind of defeats the purpose of using https in the first place in my opinion. Is there no other way to deal with this?\nAlso, is this an Android-only problem? (as there are no changes to the iOS code)\n/cc @cjdell \n. @cjdell I think the PR should also cover iOS, as this could just as well be an issue there too (I do know there are ways to accept self-signed certs etc. and that iOS does fail on those without further processing)\n. Thanks! Would you mind refactoring the Javascript file so that the readFile and readAsset share common code? (which is 99%). I wonder if instead of always throwing on iOS, we should maybe try to read the file from the main application bundle instead since that's where assets are stored.\nThoughts on this?\ncc @cjdell \n. This question rather belongs on stackoverflow :)\n. Thanks!\n. I feel that this is outside of the scope of the library, similar to https://github.com/johanneslumpe/react-native-fs/issues/34\nThis should be part of a separate library which allows manipulating the assets libraries.\n. @opp100 have you investigated more? I currently do not have the time to check but this sounds more like a UI issue than an actual bug?!\n. @superandrew213 This would be a breaking change for some users, no?\n. @tomprogers were yo able to look into this issue further and come to a conclusion where we might have a bug?\n. We got rid of the bluebird dependency and started using the promise interface provided by react native, so yes - this is expected.\n. What is the status here? @NunoCardoso did you resolve your issue?\n. Thanks!\n. @saidmoya12 PRs are welcome but I personally do not have time at the moment to work on any of this.\n. @nmorel do you know why this error occurs? Is it because the connection is aborted and thus there exists no status code?\n. @nmorel yeah if your app goes into background mode and you do not request time to finish things (max ~ 10 minutes) i think, then connections are just being severed I think.\n. I'll just go ahead and merge this, thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. This looks rather useful! :) How well has this been tested?\n. Ok. Let's merge this in an go from there :) I don't have time to test this on my own but I trust you on this.\n. @freshlybakedcode thanks :) Could we tweak this a little bit?\n\nAt the command line, in your project folder type:\nDone! No need to worry about manually adding the library to your project.\n. Thanks!\n. Want to send a PR for this?\n. Your issue is not related to this package. We have a peer dependency on react with ^15.2.1, which allows 15.3.2.\n\nYour installed react-native version does not allow for the react version you want to install. And react-native-statusbar-alert is failling too.\n. This is not an issue with the library and expected. The main bundle is immutable. You have to use the document directory as you already discovered.. No. This is not a file server module ;). I currently do not have any spare time to devote to this project :/. @nbolender Since I haven't implemented the download functionality, I just want to make sure: If a download is already completed and then someone aborts, no callback is going to be executed. In that case what happens to the download promise? I assume it will just resolve with the downloaded file, as this fix is just for an edge case?. @nbolender Makes sense, thanks!. You have to look at your debugging console of your IDE to see the logs.. @ejabu that's probably a question for stackoverflow.com. But you could just get started with Android Studio. It's all about personal preference though.. I don't remember at the moment ;) PR would def be accepted.. A PR is appreciated!. Ha, look at that. Thanks!. @cjdell Yeah I think adding a deprecation warning makes sense given the fact that neither I nor anyone else actually has time to properly maintain this library.. Please take a look at https://github.com/johanneslumpe/react-native-fs/issues/228 I currently do not have time to work on this library, and the other contributors seem to be busy as well.. @benvium I've just published the new version to npm. react-native-fs@2.1.0-rc.1. Thanks!. No, it can't. Please not that I'm also not actively maintaining the project due to time constraints.. @codesinghanoop Feel free to! I cannot devote any time to this project at the moment but maybe @cjdell or other contributors can take a look at your PR.. @huhuanming I have no time to support this project due to my day job. See https://github.com/johanneslumpe/react-native-fs/issues/228. I have just updated the repo description and the readme file to reflect this.. @itinance @Antonhansel I am not using react-native actively at work and my day job takes a huge chunk of my time, thus leaving no extra time to maintain this library. I haven't been able to keep up with all the changes to react-native and the codebase became stale rather quickly. Long story short: I can transfer ownership to @itinance but it would be nice if original credit would remain in place somehow. How does that sound?. Using a switch statement here would clean thing up a bit:\n``` javascript\nvar splitPath = filepath.split('/');\nswitch (splitPath[0]) {\n  case 'Documents':\n    splitPath[0] = RNFSManager.NSDocumentDirectoryPath;\n    break;\n  case 'Caches':\n    splitPath[0] = RNFSManager.NSCachesDirectoryPath;\n    break;\n  case 'tmp':\n    splitPath[0] = RNFSManager.NSTmpDirectoryPath;\n    break;\n  default:\n    return RNFSManager.NSDocumentDirectoryPath + '/' + filepath;\n}\nreturn splitPath.join('/');\n```\nSeems much more readable to me.\n. I don't like that we are not specifying all arguments here. I'd rather have something like:\nreadFile(filepath, options, callback)\nand then a check like this: \n``` javascript\nreadFile(filepath, options, callback) {\n  var processedFilePath = processFilePath(filepath);\n  var hasCallback = typeof callback === 'function';\n  callback = hasCallback ? callback : options;\n  options = hasCallback ? options : DEFAULT_OPTIONS;\nRNFSManager.readFile(processedFilePath, options, callback);\n}\n``\n. Same as forreadFile`:\nmkdir(filepath, mode, callback)\nAnd then also an updated check for the callback.\n. Please always use curly braces around if statement blocks. Also, no need for parens around info.\n. Same as above, curly braces\n. Curlies\n. Curlies\n. !==\n. I think we should just check once beforehand whether NativeAppEventEmitter.addListener is available, instead of doing it every single time. It can be a constant value like:\nvar NATIVE_ADD_LISTENER_AVAILABLE = !!NativeAppEventEmitter.addListener;\n. ===\n. Could you remove the trailing space?\n. Could you remove the trailing space?\n. Could you remove the trailing space?\n. Could you remove the trailing space?\n. Indentation for the example code should be 2 spaces\n. Could you please invert this predicate so we can get rid of the empty block?\n. Indentation should be 2 spaces\n. Any reason why you are swallowing this error here and just continue? I feel the user should get feedback in JS-land if an upload fails due to the file not existing.\n. This test does not work for iOS does it? Because ExternalDirectoryPath is null.\n. ",

I understand  that a lot of it will not be possible (ex: synced stuff), but that can be left out. My goal is to minimise writing different(backend) code for different platforms.\nMy initial thoughts with react-native was that we could do  something like that easily, but as I  delved deep I realised it is missing a lot of node core apis. I hope there will be more similar modules that fill the gap for different platforms so that we can have similar backend code and maximise user experiences with react-native ui code.\n. If you plan to  make the api node like, are you still planning to keep the existing promise based apis or would it be good idea to make the api node like and then provide a promisified api on top of that ?\n. I took a first stab to make the existing api node-like( Pull Request ).  I hope it can serve as a good starting point for discussion/further changes.

Demo project here: https://github.com/cjdell/react-native-fs-test\nWould you trust me with access to the repository? :-)\n. @johanneslumpe Awesome, thanks :-) It's official now, just merged my pull request. This may end up becoming the de facto FS module for React Native :-)\n. @johanneslumpe Have tested it with demo app so I'm reasonably confident.\nNot sure how one goes about automated tests in ReactNative but this would increase my confidence. I'm currently building an app using this module so if I find problems I will be fixing them in the days to come :-)\nAlso why is version of NPM module package.json higher than version in GitHub?\n. @johanneslumpe Sure, as I say I'm building an app at the moment so it should be a good test. Also thinking of adding a mkdir and maybe a downloadFile\n. @johanneslumpe Awesome, it that case might also make readFile and writeFile more uniform and more Node like (basically add encoding param). :-)\n. @johanneslumpe I'm very happy with the API now, it is now more Node like. I think a feature freeze might be in order.\nBy the way I appreciate you giving me the freedom to make these changes. I really hope this becomes a popular library. :-)\n. @johanneslumpe Well I added a downloadFile to bypass JS pipeline because writeFile is slow. Other than that it has mostly been interface changes and of course Android support.\nIs it easy enough to publish the module? Do you want to commit to a 1.0 release?\n. @johanneslumpe Made some minor fixes today. I've noticed in Android that downloadFile blocks the UI on large files but not in iOS. Will need to have some fun with threads. Will have to be tomorrows job. :-)\n. @johanneslumpe Yeah it's working much better now. Nearly ready to publish my Android app. You might as well publish to NPM :-) \n. @johanneslumpe Awesome!\n. @johanneslumpe Sorry for the late reply. Android's method of accessing assets is to use file:/// URL. We could extend support to all URL formats supported by the platform, so long as it doesn't lead to ambiguities. I think both can convert URL to absolute path and vice versa.\nCan we start some sort of wish list for requested features? I will be using this library in other projects so am happy to put the time in to improve it :-)\n. @johanneslumpe I believe this is an important feature to have, and maybe useful to mitigate the performance penalty of traversing over the native bridge. I think taking inspiration from Node's fs.createReadStream and fs.createWriteStream would be a good idea, however we would likely have to settle for a subset of Node's API.\nIt will take me quite a bit of time to put this together and I have a busy schedule so I can't make any promises of an ETA just yet.\n. @crysfel No way to do this as yet but it is planned. Download progress is something I will be needing for an upcoming project.\nOut of interest, what do you plan to do with the zip file after it is downloaded? Will you be wanting to extract it? Reading large amounts of data as base64 is very slow. I can see there being a need for an unzip method. :-) \n. @crysfel Just implemented a progress callback, have a look at the README for more info :-)\n. @cancan101 @johanneslumpe Noted, I can change this. It's strange though that it didn't seem to block for me. Maybe because React Native runs its UI stuff on it's own threads?\n. @cancan101 @johanneslumpe OK I've reimplemented this using NSURLConnection. I think the way React Native handles native calls was disguising the problem, however this needed to be done anyway to allow for another requested feature which was download progress, which is next on my todo list.\n. @johanneslumpe It's gone now, I rebuilt downloadFile. :-)\n. @cancan101 Not as far as I know. Unfortunately the bridge between JS and native code is always going to be slow and is the reason I introduced a (poorly) written downloadFile. This effectively means that all data heavy lifting operations will need to be pushed beneath the filesystem abstraction that this API provides. Another API method that I might need to implement soon is unzip. This will be way too slow to do outside of native. \n. @MiincGu Thanks for doing this. I'll give this some testing later today and if all goes well I will merge this in. :-)\n. @MiincGu Again thanks for you contribution. There is a slight issue in that your implementation assumes that only one download can be happening at any one time. If two download jobs are running concurrently then your stopDownload will only abort the last one. It has however made me realise that the exposed API could be better.\nI'm going to make another callback that will return the job ID of the download as soon as the download begins, along with other useful infos like response headers. The caller will be able to use the job ID to tell the module which download to abort.\n. @MiincGu Have refactored and manually merged in some of your code. Need to test stopDownload in new implementation but I've run out of time today. This pull request is now redundant.\n. @MiincGu I'm not sure why this is necessary to be honest. Errors are passed from native by calling the callback with an object as the first argument (Node.js style error callback). Because the calls to native are promisified, this means the promise will reject if the native function calls back with an error.\n. @cancan101 @fov42550564 I will implement this feature shortly as it is a quick win.\n. @johanneslumpe Sorry for being inactive for a while. I merged in a pull request for this feature a couple of weeks ago. My test app shows this working so it might be worth doing another NPM release when you get a moment. Thanks\n. Only @johanneslumpe can do this at the moment, speaking of which, can I be added as a collaborator on NPM?\n@demiurga you can directly reference the GitHub repo in your package.json for the latest version. What issues are you having with the build?\n. @johanneslumpe I think a version 1.1 release is in order. I'm unlikely to be adding any new stuff over the next few days. I might get some time over Christmas to add some requested features for a version 1.2...\n. @johanneslumpe Sorry to reopen this but just noticed the readme on NPM is still the old one. Close this as soon as you've updated. Thanks\n. @johanneslumpe Showing up now, closing the issue :-)\n. @guizmaii I will happily look into this problem for you, if you could just let me know which method you are calling and the parameters being passed. Because of the asynchronous nature of JS, it is very difficult to determine this just from the stack trace. Thanks\n. Good spot, this method is effectively synchronous so it doesn't return a promise. I've corrected the README to reflect this. Thanks\n. @onzag It looks like you might have misconfigured at least one of the files needed to reference the library. Android project settings are pretty horrible and very easy to get wrong, so triple check these files. Also make sure you have modified the correct build.gradle (there are two). My sample app might be a useful reference to compare to: https://github.com/cjdell/react-native-fs-test\n. Thanks for finding this :-)\n. I had this occur with the test app last night after an upgrade. I solved it by making sure the \"Build Settings\" -> \"Header Search Paths\" was set to include the React library. You should have this entry:\n$(SRCROOT)/../node_modules/react-native/React - (Recursive)\nYou might also be able to fix it by removing and re-adding the reference to library, but that didn't work for me. Hope this helps.\n. @iSimar Did you do it for both Project and Target (in the sidebar)? They are actually two separate configurations (not sure why). Failing that, you could try a reinstall of the react-native module.. @corbt @asamiller Brilliant, thanks guys for your hard work!\n. @johanneslumpe I'll update the demo app and do some tests when I get a moment, been meaning to do this for a while. I'm a little busy myself :-) \n. @wootwoot1234 I've manually merged this in. Sorry for taking so long to do this.\nDo you think you could add Android support for this? If not I will try to do this myself when I get time.\n. @corbt Manually merging this. Thanks for your contribution :-)\n. @af I think this should be opt-in behaviour. Android has a background download service of sorts so it might be possible to have an elegant cross platform abstraction. Others have suggested making downloadFile more capable so I'm debating having arguments passed as an options object so we can have optional things like headers as well. That would work well for this feature because we could have { background: true } as an option.\n. This has been superseded by a later pull request, although I have used the README contents and merged this manually. Thanks\n. @benvium @johanneslumpe Thanks for this. Sorry for not being able to integrate and test this just yet. Should probably get a release out first, then I can look at bringing this in.\n. @mattvot @johanneslumpe Apologies for the delay, I've been focusing all my efforts on getting V2 in a releasable state. V2 will have some breaking changes with the old API. Once this is done, I can look at properly integrating this.\n. @johanneslumpe  @grabbou Working on bringing this in. Some merge conflicts to deal with. Good to finally get rid of the promisify stuff.\n. @johanneslumpe @grabbou Finally merged this. Sorry for the delay, it was a bit tricky.\nTried hard not to make to breaking changes but there probably are some edge cases due to the different way errors are being handled. Might finally be time for V2.0.\n. @af @grabbou @johanneslumpe Will merge this in soon. I want to sort out the argument structure so we can set request headers as well (like uploadFiles). Hope to sort this before the weekend.\n. @af I've merged this in. I've tested it on my test app here:\nhttps://github.com/cjdell/react-native-fs-test\nThere does seem to be an intermittent issue however:\n\nOther than that it appears to be working.\n. @af I think it is happening when I press the button more than once. The first download seems to work, but later ones can fail. I'm also sometimes seeing in Xcode logs that a background download with the given URL is already in progress, however it never completes\n. @af Just pushed the added download test, forgot to push it.\n. @af Thanks for looking into this. Please open a new PR as I've done quite a bit of refactoring since this one was opened. It will be much easier to merge in that way :-) Will close this PR now that it is reductant\n. @Frosty92 This is a tricky one. Do you know where previously ExternalDirectoryPath was pointing to before you made this change, and what it is after? Changing how this path is acquired will break things for existing users of the library who have stored persistent data.\n. @charliesbox @kitolog @johanneslumpe I'll try to get this merged in today at some point\n. @charliesbox @kitolog @johanneslumpe Merged this in now. Tested it in my test app and it appears to be working :-)\n. @charliesbox This hasn't yet been published to NPM, are you referencing the GitHub repo directly inside package.json?\n...\n\"react-native-fs\": \"git+https://github.com/johanneslumpe/react-native-fs.git\"\n...\n. @vince-rowe At the moment, you can't I'm afraid. I intend to make the signature for downloadFile more like uploadFile so that it can have more optional parameters (such as headers). We can support the old parameters by inspecting the argument length. Will be a few days before I get a moment to implement this though.\n. @vince-rowe The method downloadFile now supports setting custom HTTP headers. Please see updated readme.\n. @Sean-Snow Perhaps the file is not encoded as UTF-8, but maybe as binary or ASCII? Have you tried specifying a different encoding as per the readme?\n. @Sean-Snow @franzejr readFile defaults to utf8, I think it might need to be read as binary or ascii, or the file might corrupt or truncated.\n. @mkraft @johanneslumpe I agree, this smells of the native module not being loaded into memory. Can you triple check that you have linked the .a file with the binary in Build Phases?\n. @savelichalex A release might be in order. Have added quite a few new features since the last release. There are a few other PR's I need to sort, but don't want to add too much at once :-)\nWhat do you think @johanneslumpe? I have tested the new features so I am reasonably confident in releasing.\n. @johanneslumpe I have made downloadFile so that it still supports the old parameter format. I've changed the docs so people only see the new format\n. @johanneslumpe Added a deprecated warning for this\n. @insraq Looks good, tested and working, thanks for this :-)\n. @insraq @johanneslumpe Shame on me for not spotting this, I have returned the key to being response as there is no (really) good reason for this to change. I'm now also capturing this behaviour in my test app.\n. @insraq @johanneslumpe Just realised in the docs that we're not actually describing the returned Promise object for some methods. I'll have to sort this out when I get another moment.\n. @insraq Sorted, I've added them both in now. Did it manually as it was easier than dealing with the merge. :-)\n. @insraq Already done this, though not with both property names. Thought of doing that but I figured it would make the API more confusing. We can make breaking changes in V2. :-)\n. @K0rdan @johanneslumpe I think we should accept however I'm wondering if this should be a separate appendFile method. It would be nice to make the library follow the same pattern as Node's fs module:\nhttps://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_appendfile_file_data_options_callback\nIf no one objects I can make this change on top of this PR.\n. @IjzerenHein Sorry appendFile has already been added, but I forgot to update the readme!\n. @IjzerenHein Sorry, I meant it's on master. You can add the GitHub repo URL directly to your package.json if you need it now. I can't update the NPM package, only @johanneslumpe can do that.\n. @johanneslumpe @locly I think we should accept this PR, it makes much more sense to have 0 mean everything so 1 can be used for each percentage point. Will give it a test now.\n. @johanneslumpe @locly Manually merged this in\n. Fixed in V2\n. @asommer70 Good spot but this has been addressed in the new version:\nhttps://github.com/johanneslumpe/react-native-fs/blob/master/FS.common.js\nIt was initially a mistake. Old names were put in for backwards compatibility but the new names were added to match up to the ones in downloadFile. We needed it to be consistent.\n. attributes argument has been removed from writeFile and appendFile, but I realise no alternative way of setting attributes exists just yet. It may be impossible to find a suitable abstraction for both platforms. I'm thinking maybe there should be a separate platform specific method just for setting attributes for people who really need them.\ni.e. setIosAttributes(filepath: string, attributes: object)\n. @johanneslumpe These are all the keys that could previously be set in the attributes hash:\nNSString * const NSFileType;\nNSString * const NSFileSize;\nNSString * const NSFileModificationDate;\nNSString * const NSFileReferenceCount;\nNSString * const NSFileDeviceIdentifier;\nNSString * const NSFileOwnerAccountName;\nNSString * const NSFileGroupOwnerAccountName;\nNSString * const NSFilePosixPermissions;\nNSString * const NSFileSystemNumber;\nNSString * const NSFileSystemFileNumber;\nNSString * const NSFileExtensionHidden;\nNSString * const NSFileHFSCreatorCode;\nNSString * const NSFileHFSTypeCode;\nNSString * const NSFileImmutable;\nNSString * const NSFileAppendOnly;\nNSString * const NSFileCreationDate;\nNSString * const NSFileOwnerAccountID;\nNSString * const NSFileGroupOwnerAccountID;\nNSString * const NSFileBusy;\nPerhaps we should only support a subset of them? Since you originally introduced the feature, do you remember which attributes you needed to be able to set? I imagine only a very small number of them will be used in practise.\n. @johanneslumpe Will try my hardest to get V2 publishable this week.\n. @johanneslumpe I think so, I'll check. Going to see if I can finish off V2 this evening.\n. @johanneslumpe We have a prerelease. I'm only one man so I wouldn't count on it being bug free just yet. Could do with some feedback from others before we push it out to NPM. :-)\nhttps://github.com/johanneslumpe/react-native-fs/releases/tag/v2.0.1-0\n. New prerelease out people! https://github.com/johanneslumpe/react-native-fs/releases/tag/v2.0.1-rc.2\n. This will be fixed in V2.\n. I actually knew this but had forgotten. :-) The downloader on Android was made to run on its own thread because this was an obvious problem. The other methods however normally run inside a few milliseconds so not quite so obvious, unless someone is attempting to write a huge base64 string. This problem could be solved by wrapping all the Android methods like this:\njava\nnew Thread(new Runnable() {\n  public void run() {\n    // do stuff\n  }\n}).start();\nOnce we have V2 out I will look at doing this.\n. @corbt Thanks for this. My only feedback on this is that I think copyFile should be called internally for the sake of DRY, or maybe refactor both to call an internal private method. The implementation is almost identical.\n. @corbt You're obviously alert. Thanks :-)\n. @corbt Good spot, obviously my ES6 powers are weak :-)\n. @CesarLanderos We could return the jobId synchronously.\nSo instead of returning just the promise, we could return something like:\njavascript\n{\n  jobId: 1,\n  promise: <Promise>\n}\nWhat do you think? We're in the process of releasing V2, so now is the time to be making breaking changes such as this one. :-)\n. Added this in https://github.com/johanneslumpe/react-native-fs/commit/5af22b2782515ed2b21280a6c55b716d235a96bd\n. @susylPearl @johanneslumpe We do have appendFile in V2, see README.md\n. @gauravbhusare Looks like you're using an older version of the lib. I know this because downloadFile now returns an object rather than the promise directly. Try updating the lib and remember to add .promise.then instead of .then due to the breaking changes in V2.\n. @macdabby Thanks for this. It is my preference to make the API as Node-like as possible as a lot of JS devs know the Node FS API by heart. Node has a method simply called read which allows you to specify a length and offset. The only complication is it returns a Buffer which doesn't exist in RN.\n. @Mr7Cat If this is something people really need then we should probably make it available as an option, rather than just blindly accepting all self signed certs. It should be a relatively easy modification to make to this PR, but I would rather test it first.\n. @asamiller Thanks for bringing this to my attention. They're actually both wrong, did a lot of refactoring recently and the key is actually NSURLIsExcludedFromBackupKey. Will fix it now...\n. I have been off this project for a while and feel really bad for that. I want to get back into it now I have more free time.\nThis library has admittedly fallen behind. The react-native-fetch-blob looks very promising, and it seems to cover everything that our library can do and more. However there are apparently a lot of people using this library who will continue to need support for the foreseeable future.\nThis just my opinion, but in my view there are two options moving forward:\n\n\nDeprecate react-native-fs, and suggest that people move to react-native-fetch-blob. We could provide a shim to make the transition less painful. Working together behind a single project we may be able to achieve more.\n\n\nTake all the features we like from react-native-fetch-blob and integrate them into react-native-fs. We are both MIT licensed. We can still collaborate, but also maintain the freedom to go in our own directions.\n\n\nWhat do people think?\n/cc @johanneslumpe @grabbou @corbt @aforty @freshlybakedcode @benvium @esamelson anyone I missed?\n. This flares up from time to time. It means the native part of the module isn't loading. It's usually because the reference to libRNFS.a has been lost from the project. Make sure you have it in \"Build Phases\" -> \"Link Binary With Libraries\".. This is more of a workaround than a fix. If you create a new app with the CLI tool it will use arrow brackets. We should find out why arrow brackets isn't working in this case.. @br4nnigan Agreed, am in the process of tidying the networking site. Will add a timeout option or network detection of some sort..

My guess is you won't.  If you can't figure it out, I would recommend creating a new project, import your code and plugins and I'll bet the problem will go away.  When you do figure it out, post it the solution here for the next person.  That's what I should have done, sorry.\n. Yes, try this out:\nhttps://github.com/wootwoot1234/react-native-save-asset-library\n. @johanneslumpe  Yes, I looked into using both of those but because they didn't report back the progress (percentage uploaded).  I asked if you were planning on supporting uploading because I already use this module (thanks for that BTW) and thought it would be a good fit.  In the end, I created my own (or heavily modified react-native-file-upload) with progress reporting.  I you're interested, you can add my code to react-native-fs.  Here's a link to my module: https://github.com/wootwoot1234/react-native-transfer\n. @johanneslumpe I'm finishing up another project I was pulled into but will get started on a pull-request today I hope.  I'll keep you updated.\n. @mcorb do you have an example of the fetch file uploading in react native?  I wouldn't have spent the time creating a pull-request for fs with uploading if I had known it was already possible.  I guess one thing that is nice with my code is that it can upload multiple files with one call or is that possible with fetch too?\n. @mcorb I think adding that to the readme would be good.  It would keep people from going down the same path I did.  Can fetch do downloading too?\n@johanneslumpe are you still interested in the upload files pull request I did.  I have time to clean it up right now or would you rather just suggest people use fetch?\n. @johanneslumpe I haven't tried it.  Looking at it a little closer it looks like it might support multiple files too.  The only thing I couldn't tell from looking at the code is what type of file paths it supports.  In other words, can you upload files from the main bundle, documents, and library directories?\n. Does the react native upload functionality support all the file paths?  If it does I think this can be closed, if it doesn't, I've been using my code in production for a while now and it works great.. Great, looking forward to hearing what you think.\n. No worries.  When ever you get around to it is fine.\n. @johanneslumpe I don't think adding two functions 'uploadFile' and 'uploadFiles' when 'UploadFiles' will do both makes sense to me.  Also, the way the uploadFiles function works, is that it uploads all the files at once with one call to the server which is more efficient than sending each file one at a time.\nAs for your critiques to my code above, why don't you just accept the pull request and make any of the minor changes that you see fit?  I think that will be much faster and that way you can have it exactly how you like it.\n.

    "itinance": "This is done now by https://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs/pull/286: \"copyAssetsFileIOS()\". Ah, good hint. I already have the code for video finished and use it in another app natively so far. \nWill put it into the library. For Videos another approach is required. I've already wrote the method in iOS, i still need to add the javascript-bridge. I will provide this on the Weekend.. We have a similar scenario in the current project where large videos should be downloaded from S3/Cloudfront and uploaded to AWS in chunks and with resume mode depending on network connectivity. \nI think here about to make this complete in native without to handle these chunks in javascript-land. I think about a background task (thread) that is doing the whole work and informs the RN-land (i mean the javascript-layer) with a progress-event (progress in generell, event when stopping because of lost connectivity, event when resuming the download/upload and so on...) So then no base64 encoding/decoding would be necessary any more, particularly as the files are stored on device as binary and the video-player will play them as binary as they are ;)\nIs there a special reason why you would do the handling of chunks on the javascript-layer, @MarkMurphy?. In order to fully understand, i will draw a picture of the process to see, if we both discuss the same scenario: :)\n\nuser is recording a video with his smartphone\nthe video-recording-app (wether it is the default system-application or a specific one) will save the file on the device's drive\nRN-developer wants to upload the file to a server, even if it is very large, even if the connectivity is slow or sometimes broken. The maingoal is to get this video up to the backend server or some cloudstorage.\n\nI think you have another point that i am not aware of yet, when you are saying \"reuse stuff i've already written for browser projects\". What exactly is this what you want to reuse from browser-projects?. Thanks for reaching out. Just one thing. Please consider my comment. i would guess that this folder is for readonly usage. Can someone confirm?. Have you tried this method readFileAssets . I always use downloadFile() for dealing with binary data. It is doing an asynchronous GET-request to a specific URL and stores the response binary on device.. Hm... seems that we should reactivate this mentioned PR, @lefoy \nDo you want to do another PR with that?. Merged. Sorry for being late, didn't get a notice on this PR. I came across this one while reading thru recent pull request. Please upgrade to v2.13.. Whats about the current state of this PR?\n. Apparently a line was twice when running Android-App first. But the error remains. i now rebootet everything and the error disappears :)\n. This will be solved with https://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs/pull/283, which is in test now and will be published in upcoming days :). Just use the hash-function.. For images at xcassets you don't need to use RNFS. \nAs written in the official react-native docs for Image-component, you can just place their name as URI:\n\nFor images included via Xcode asset catalogs or in the Android drawable folder, use the image name without the extension:\n\n<Image source={{uri: 'app_icon'}} style={{width: 40, height: 40}} />. Alright, i got your point now. You don't ask how to use XCAssets-Images with Image-Component, but how to use them within WebView. I think this is beyond this library, because it is little tricky and very specialized to iOS only. \nThe answer for your issue is here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/39114460/1397160\nMaybe someone wants to provide a Pull request with this? . @vaukalak show me the whole filename please. We shouldn't break compatibility here. Too dangerous. However, thank you very much for contribution!\n(Another option would be to introduce another constant like TemporaryDirectoryPathEx or something like this. Please send PR if you find it usefull). This is strange. We use downloadFile with large Zip-FIles in our Zizzle-App very unblocking. Download happens in the background, a progressbar is shown at the bottom of the screen during the download and while all that the user can navigate thru the application without any implications.. Please provide more info. What do you do? Whats your code? What happens exactly and what do you expect instead?. There is no specific download-directory of the device. You specify the final location by yourself and it will exactly download each byte onto this location and not some where else. If you don't believe me, just take a Debugger (XCode for iOS, Android Studio on Android) and step thru each line while downloading :)\nDoes this answer your question?. It depends what you really want to do. \nFor decoding base64-data you can yes the npm module base-64 for decoding. Otherwise you can read the file as plain ascii or utf-8 to \"JSON.parse\" it. The issue here is that the file would remain completely in memory as base64 and the success of those operations depends on the available memory in your device.\nApart from that, with base64-encoding the memory consumption will be 4/3 from the original filesize. \nThat's why you shouldn't never ever load big files into memory wether with RN/JavaScript nor in native code. For playing audio files use react-native-sound instead that streams the audiofile from a filename with native counterparts without loading it into memory once.\nJust to name it: we can't do anything here. If you load 50 MB e.g. into memory while only 43 MB are still free, then those things will happen . code from node_modules will be bundled as well with your code and is not accessable with readFile. No worries, @hardcodet and all others. There are NO plans to deprecate this library again. It is \"too big to fail\" in my eyes. Thats why i took it over nearly one year ago. react-native-fs is widely used since Q1 2016 in a bunch of actively managed apps of my company and my customers and so on.\nSince it is open source, you all can help to make this library much better! As you can see in the project-history, i give my best to check and merge pull requests. Most PR's have landet in master. In some periods of time faster and sometimes not so fast. It also depends on the extent of the PR, how fast i can act here.\n. iOS or Android or both?. Under the hood this Lib uses native methods to manage network requests:\niOS: NSUrlSessionDownloadTask\nAndroid: HttpUrlConnection\nBut, on Android the Buffer-Size is very small (8 kb). You might want to increase the buffer-size for testing purposes and make a suggestion if you could speed up the download process then?\nChange these both lines for testing with a higher buffer size (maybe 64 kb or more):\n\nhttps://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs/blob/master/android/src/main/java/com/rnfs/Downloader.java#L103\nhttps://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs/blob/master/android/src/main/java/com/rnfs/Downloader.java#L106\n\nDon't forget to restart the packager after modification of native library code and to recompile/reinstall the app then. Let me know if you could speed it up pls.\n. Any feedback?. Closed because of lag of feedback. Please post the values of \"bytesWritten\" and \"contentLength\" to give an example. I never experienced this issue while using it in 3 separate Apps. Can you double check using curl what your server will respond?. Alright, ^2.0.1-rc.3 fixes this. I started with ^2.0.1-rc.2 where xcodeproj was gone. This PR would break compatibility with ReactNative >= 0.40 (and in fact it will undo the changes that where necessary when 0.40 came out). \nIf you are below RN 0.40, consider to use an older release of react-native-fs please.. Good point! Will look at it. Nice catch! Thanks for contributing. Do you might adding a section to the Readme describing the purpose of this method (with special warning that this is iOS only)?. Done. Thanks for pointing out!. Hi @IjzerenHein, are you still available for contribution? Since some days this library is back maintained again (i am the new maintainer) and your proposed solution seems to fit to other users requests. Your suggested API looks fine to me!. maybe we should start each download task in a separate thread? For android there is already a PR from @codesinghanoop https://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs/pull/254. If we would parallelize all download task with next release, some apps could get in trouble than maybe. For keeping backward compat i would suggest to add an optional separateThread-Mode. If this is true, the downloadTask would start in a separate thread, otherwise not.. And you use the code of your PR for this, right? https://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs/pull/254\nThen i will speed it up in upcoming days to test and merge. Ok thank you! I will do the same on iOS side and merge it then together with your PR. Tomorrow or on Monday.. I will merge this in upcoming days, together with a solution for iOS also by my own. Thought i could do this much faster but it will take some days. . Because multithreading is often a pain to debug. Also we don't know if any apps would come into trouble when downloads now would be run in parallel. But for next release i will add a note that we've changed the Download-Task to Threads now. /cc @a-koka \nAnyway I just merged #254 for android. Need to do this also for iOS or someone wants to send a PR for it?. i've updated the readme that name and path will not be returned.. waiting for a small change [or discussion], then i will merge quickly. As with stat() there is now \"ctime\" and \"mtime\" available also in readDir(). Thanks to #283 . Sounds very usefully! Any Java-Head out there to help double check this PR? Maybe @benvium ?\n. I will merge this in upcoming days, together with a solution for iOS also by my own. Thought i could do this much faster but it will take some days. @a-koka unfortunately i haven't much progress on this for iOS. Any help with PR's are much appreciated :) Thank you!. What have you tried out and on which platform? Any code?. there shouldnt be any linking issues if one does this the right way.\nreact-native init x\ncd x\nyarn add react-native-fs\nreact-native link\n... add some custom code\nreact-native run-ios\nworks.. I'd like to reopen this PR. Ah, the underlying repository was already deleted. . Just tried it out and it works perfectly. You need to put these files into the assets-folder within the android-folder.. Thank you for contributing! See my comments please :). @crysfel yes, it is back under active maintainance. as @wootwoot1234 said, will @a-koka propose the final solution into the readme that we can close this issue that way? :) thank you very much. Thanks a lot. Merged. . Since this is an opensource-project, everybody can submit Pullrequests to enhance the featureset or the supported platforms. For windows, i won't do it by myself. Maybe you or others?. I don't know how it is on android, but on iOS there is no special path where you can place files to include them into the photo album.\nBut i think about to add a special method in RNFS to achieve that. More information according to this issue can you read here: https://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs/issues/281#issuecomment-298115758. You can download this File to a temporary Directory (using the constant RNFS.TemporaryDirectoryPath) and put it into the Album using official CameraRoll.saveToCameraRoll. Thank you for contributing! I made some comments to consider in order to make this code less duplicated and more clean. Can you improve it a bit? Will merge then. Anyways, very usefull contribution!. I think we should leave it on par with react native itself. Moreover, lots of applications outside are still on SDK 23 and also all the new ones that are created with \"react-native init\".. Hm.... the folks from react-native-camera also refer (and finally dit it) to update buildtools to 25. Thx for clarifying. @markusguenther. Lets keep this open until RN will update itself its build tools.. Yes i did this also in all projects :)\nBut with next release we will already be at 25. . Any news on this? Could you solve in the meanwhile, @barzev?. Pls retry the full setup from scratch. This error is mostly caused with a not-linking of native modules.\nAlso don't forget to recompile and restart your whole project. Just a refresh is not sufficient.\n@zGuindouGit in ypur code is also a space missing between await and RNFS:\nreturn awaitRNFS.readFile(this.img, 'base64').then();\nreturn await   RNFS.readFile(this.img, 'base64').then();\n. Please specify your question and telll us what you really need (or try StackOverflow). Oh yes, thank you @johanneslumpe for this excellent work! I was totally shocked yesterday that i've forgotten to mention it separately in my opener :). Sounds great @johanneslumpe! Of course i will keep original credits. I sent you an invite on linkedin to introduce myself :). hi @br4nnigan  I'm in contact with @johanneslumpe. He will transfer ownership to me in upcoming days.\nAs said before, we use this library very heavily in several projects and don't want to let it die :). Transfer is done. Thank you very much for your trust, @johanneslumpe, and once more for the awesome work on this library! \nOver the next days (and weeks for the complicated ones) i will view the open PRs and merge if valid and possible. thank you for pointing out! Also: contributions are always very welcome :). Okay, did it by myself. Please open if you think my description fits not their needs. Have you tried to call stat() or exists() on exactly this path then and can leave here the result?. unlink() returns already a promise, so this will be right syntax:\n```\nRNFS.unlink(audioPath)\n.then((result) => {  // <=================================\n    console.log(\"audio removed success!\");\n})\n.catch((error) => {\n    console.log(error);\n});\n```\nBtw, your first approach with a separate property injection \".promise.\" should result in an exception because \".promise\" is not defined.. Currently this is out of scope of this library because there is no specific path to the photo album. On iOS you need a special function UIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbum to achieve this and i would rather expect this from a photo/camera-related library, especially as this function needs an instance of UIImage and not a source filepath. . Thanks for your feedback!. There is a strange issue. I got the error message\n\nRCTJSONStringify() encountered the following error: Invalid type in JSON write (__NSTaggedDate)\n\nwhen readDir() of MainBundle-Directory. Turns also out, that some items are not really NSStrings that can't converted into JSON-valid Values:\nWhen i comment out these both lines out in RNFSManager, it works pretty fine again.\nIt seems that the JsonSerializer is not happy with this kinde of NSTaggedDate. But i wonder why this works for you? . Many sources are saying \"you can't convert NSDate to JSON, use NSString-presentation\". Maybe we should work with unix timestamp here as it is done also in the stat-function?. Merged. Thank you very much!\n@Ignigena i did a small change in order to fix this json-serialization-error. I found out that the stat-method had a similar issue maybe and so I used its approach here. Moreover i renamed the properties \"created\" and \"modified\" to \"ctime\" respectively \"mtime\" in order to be compatible with the stat()-method.\nMaybe you need to change your app-code this way now, sorry for inconvinience. But i think that a common naming scheme across all methods and parameters should be priotized :)\n. Thanks a lot!. Any news on this? I did several installations those days on newly created RN-projects with each PR that was sent and got never this error (and finally it looks like babel-issue).\nWhat did you do exactly?. Thanx for figuring out! Could you make a PR pls with your fix?. Fixed with \"putInt\" instead of \"putString\". fixed with latest release. You're welcome! I thought this would be a showstopper thats why i was acting fast :). Hey @IjzerenHein, thanks for contributing! Good work!\nOne thing: write() has a similar signature (and purpose) like writeFile(). What if we would extend the already existing method \"writeFile\" with the optional parameter \"position\" and handle this case then  with your implementation instead? This would keep the structure of RNFS more clean and no one would be confused when having a method \"writeFile\" and also \"write\", which have the same signature except for \"position\".\nWhat do you think?. Good hint, @IjzerenHein! I follow the argumentation to leave it close to the NodeJS-API as i read it here in more issues already that the people like to follow it.\nThank you, i will merge now.\n. Thanks for contributing! Please consider that created/modified was renamed to mtime/ctime in order to be compatible with result of stat()-function (although it wasnt reflected right in ReadDirItem). I changed this in ReadDirItem after the merge.. I am currently adding some further methods and will release today apparently. Thank you very much for contribution!. Thx, but i won't adorn myself with borrowed plume. It was originated by @johanneslumpe, who did the most work here :). Are you sure that this happens with \"RNFS.downloadFile\" and not with \"RNFetchblob.fs.scanfile\"?\nI would suggest to console.log the input parameters as well . Which version are you using? The explicit \".promise\"-Property is not necessary anymore and would fail with new releaseses?. This is react-native-fs, not RNFetchBlob.. Closed due to inactivity. Basically it is a setup issue. Please follow the installation-section in README wisely.. @arthurpankiewicz do you have any suggestions how to describe it better? in my oppinion everything was said, but since i am familiar with native iOS and android development, many steps happen automatically in my mind :) \nPlease feel free at any time to submit a pullrequest with installation instructions, that are more suitable for beginners.. Release is out now.. Thank you very much for contributing! I will look for equivalent iOS-Settings in upcoming days. Nice catch! Thank you very much!. You should work with absolute paths using these constants.. Thank you vey much!. @javache I'm also curious to know if facebook is using this module :). @younatics  Could you solve this issue? If not, pls provide more information (build.gradle). For me it seems like a wrong and outdated version of React-Lib will be installed thru Pods. Can someone confirm?.

Please show some code and tell which versions you are using (RN + RNFS).\nThis is some example code which works out of the box, if the Linking of RNFS was done the right way:\n```\nRNFS.mkdir( RNFS.DocumentDirectoryPath + '/test').then( () => {\n  RNFS.exists( RNFS.DocumentDirectoryPath + '/test').then( exists => console.log(exists))\n}).catch( err => console.log(err))\n```. WOW! Thank you very much. \nFor now pls use master. I will create a new release in the upcoming week. What do you mean with \"expiration date\"? That one given by the webserver on \"downloadFile\"?\nIf so, it is up to you to store this attribute somewhere, maybe in a Sqlite-Database or something like this. The underlaying filesystem does not offer to store custom attributes AFAIK.. I use RNFS on 0.45.1 without this line and it worked well.\nHow could that be?\nI will merge anyways. Thank you! There is already a PR existing concerning 25. \nThe common opinion across several RN-libraries and their maintainers was to stay with the setting that RN comes with itself.\nOne question:  will this force all people to install SDK 26 or can they also compile with 24 or 25?. Okay, thx for clarifying. I just merged PR with build version 25. You're welcome. And thank you very much for clarifying!. thank you!. As for your subfolders pls refer to the README:\n\nCreate a directory at filepath. Automatically creates parents and does not throw if already exists (works like Linux mkdir -p).\n\nYou need to pass only a /very/deep/path and all parents will be created automatically if still not present.\n. How was it going, @hellomaya ?. Thank your for reaching out @simitii! I am fine with it. Looking forward for your PR.. @pewh \"Apps Sandbox\" means that every iOS-app got its own \"home\"-folder with several sub-directories like an own \"tmp\" and \"Documents\" and \"Caches\" and so on.\nThis lib will not be able to watch global picture folders on iOS due to the sandbox-concept.\nBut Apple offers an API for detecting screenshot. https://stackoverflow.com/a/30691533/1397160. Wow! Thx @ptelad  ! Please consider my comment on the README-line before i can merge it.. Thx! Looking forward :). I use react-native-sound to play files that was downloaded once before with RNFS.. @themakerman \n\n@itinance did you accessed the files stored locally on iOS device?\n\nYes, sure. On Android the prefix \"file://\" is required sometimes while on iOS not.. @eslambasher have you tried \"react-native-sound\". I have 4 apps with this both for iOS and android that plays local audio files that was downloaded with RNFS. The same for video with react-native-video.. @eslambasher where have you stored the files? Document-Directory? Caches-Directory? You should show at least some code that people can get an idea of what you are talking about in detail. Thx... It is very confusing. First in. Then out.\nIt is breaking change up to 0.47.0 while  createJSModules will be required for 0.45 and 0.46?\nCan someone confirm? @Buthrakaur @maxkomarychev @joshuapinter (according to https://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs/pull/319). Thx for clarification.\nI will do the following: i will create a new (long overdue) release that is valid until 0.46.\nAfter it i will then create another new release with 0.47-breaking change.\nThis should be more convinient for all those that will wait with upgrading to 0.47 (which is quiet common for already existing RN-projects to wait a bit with upgrading). At the end I handled it differently as seen in this PR: https://github.com/andpor/react-native-sqlite-storage/pull/188/commits\nI added back the method but removed the @override.. THx @samueljmurray  and @tyleralves !. Thx for pointing out! But shouldn't we rather use a long-integer (\"long\") instead of double? Current implementations out there are used to get integers and no floating point numbers. Thank you!. Pls provide more information. Happens this one time with ONE specific file or with every file that comes from iCloud? . I'll look at this on this weekend and will test it and merge if all works fine! . Tested, merged and published. Thank you all!. Pls clarify \"damaged\". Was the file empty with 0 Bytes size?\nHave you mediainfo installed? If not, it could be usefull for double checking such issues:\nbrew install media-info\nWith mediainfo you can alayze the saved videofile. If your app runs in iOS-simulator, you can simply reach the file from your terminal. If it was running on XCode, you need to export the \"Container\" in XCode -> Devices to get file access.\n. Hell yes, thank you :) My issue was that i haven't any windows system here to test it. Since it doesnt effect any existing code for iOS and Android i will merge now.. @rozele Would you mind providing a section in README.md for UWP-support? Thank you!. Great. It would be part then of next release.. Many thanks!. Thank you for contributing!. Use moveFile()\nVia IPhone...\n\nOn 18.

Hi @EyalSi! The scheme \"content://\" is currently not supported. \nPRs are very appreciated.\n. @LukBowen which one do you mean?. Yes, i remember. I turned back to the contributor but he never answered. I will modify this PR manually to keep backward compatibility alive.. Submitting your own PR would be a good option! I would merge quickly (while CET-timezone ;) ). Great and many thanks. No rush :). I don't know if i got you right. You are deleting an image, right? And the UIImage shows a placeholder then because the image was already deleted? This would be as expected.. UIImage will cache Images once it was loaded, even if you remove this file later on physical device. \nI don't know how smart UIImage is while recognizing if the original file was removed, that it will also automatically purge the cache. You should work with state to tell the UIimage that the URL is not existing and should render then somehing else.\nAnyways, a second call to .exists() should return false instead of true. Have you tried this out?. Hi! In upcoming days :). pls find v2.8.1 on npm now.. What is the console-output in line 3? Pls post this as a comment.\nInternally, all methods like \"stat\" and \"readDir\" as an example pass through the filename-parameter to normalizeFilePath. If the given \"path\" is undefined or a promise or so such an exception will be thrown as you're reporting.\nSo i guess that something is odd with the results-parameter.. According to the code, that you've postet:\nRNFS.readDir(RNFS.MainBundlePath) // On Android, use \"RNFS.DocumentDirectoryPath\" (MainBundlePath is not defined)\n    .then((result) => {\n      console.log('GOT RESULT', result);\nis the line number 3 this one:\nconsole.log('GOT RESULT', result);\nWhat is the output?. thanks for reaching back. will close due to unreproducability. This error is raised when somewhere is calling the method RNFS.stopDownload().\nCan you ensure that nowhere this method was called in your code?. Use moveFile() for that. But pay attention that the \"destPath\"-Parameter not only contains the new filename but also the whole path. . Thanks a lot man!. i am also bundling sqlite-files with my rn-apps using this practice from react-native-sqlite-storage: https://github.com/andpor/react-native-sqlite-storage/#setting-up-your-project-to-import-a-pre-populated-sqlite-database-from-application-for-ios\nhave you tried this? works out of the box if everything was done right.. Got your point now. There is a small sentence stating: \n\n\"For Android, the www directory is always relative to the assets directory for the app: src/main/assets\"\n\nPutting the database into the assets directory will let you create a database copied over from the prebundled one.\n. template.sqlite:\n\n```\n    let params = { name: DATABASE_NAME + mandantId, createFromLocation: \"~template.sqlite\" }\n    if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {\n        params.location = 'Library';\n    }\nreturn new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    SQLite.openDatabase(params, (db) => {\n        __db = db;\n        __isDatabaseOpen = true;\n\n        resolve(db)\n    }, (err) => reject(err));\n})\n\n``. Wow! Great. Thank you very much. . use RNFS.mkdir() as stated in the README.. Thank you very much! Just one thing to look at (see my code-comment) and then i will merge.\nYou can add a second commit to this PR.\n. thank you!. Although the main purpose of this library is to provide plain native access to the filesystem, we already provide some additional features like access to PHPhotoLibrary as used e.g. incopyAssetsFileIOSandcopyAssetsVideoIOS`.\nAre there any concrete features you are missing or do you mean that methods like \"copyFile\" and readFile should be able to handle photos-URLs as well?. There is a reason behind these custom-schemes like \"photo://\" and so on. If we would provide them with \"stat\" or \"read\" we first would need to copy over them into a somewhat storage. And where should we put them? Temporary-Path? Cache-Path? Document-Path? Library-Path? When should we purge them?\nThere is a lot of thinking behind those advanced techniques.. Thank you very much for your Pull request. Merged and released now.. Thx a lot!. just released. just released with 2.8.5: https://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs/releases/tag/v2.8.5.

You can't create folders in iOS-Camera-Roll with the POSIX-style. There are special native methods necessary to create your own custom albums.\nBut thanks for the hint! I think we should add this feature to the library!. thank you very much!. Read about DS_Store-Files: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.DS_Store\nWouldnt happen on real device.\n. Many thanx for your feedback!. Hi @tomer1490 !\nThere was an issue with the \"react\"-dependency as it causes installations of React in Versionnumber 0.11, which is dead old and leads to multiple compiler issues.\nI did several tests and found out that without the dependency everything was working fine. \nIn your attached Podfile your are already adding React as Pod, are you sure that it has installed the right version?\n. Here is more discussion on the topic. The issue with react as dependency is that it will install React 0.11 instead of the current version. There are many things messed up on this.\nBtw, the same issue appears on other libraries like Bugsnag: https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-react-native/issues/193\nAnother Issue on react-native itself for this: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/16912\nI hope we'll find a solution that fits both scenarios, those with and those without Cocoapods.\n. Try adding in your Podfile: pod 'React', :path => '../node_modules/react-native'. It should tell Cocoapods to use the version of react installed from package.json.\nAnd pls follow these recommendations: https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-react-native/issues/193#issuecomment-355166756.

I wonder why nobody send a PR with this fix? \nI have changed now the buffer creation to a fix buffer size of 10 KB in the hash-function. \nPlease find the fix in latest release of v2.9.10. How shall we help you with this little kind of information? What have you done? Show at least some lines of code. I can tell you that i have a bunch of Apps in the AppStore and also PlayStore dealing with heavy file-system operations powered by react-native-fs.\nIf you really want our help, help us that we can help you!\n. Do you want to submit a PR?. Thank you!. The DocumentDirectoryPath is based on Operating Systems defaults: (getPathForDirectory:NSDocumentDirectory) for iOS and the base application path for androids application context.\nSo the short answer is: no. But you are free to store your data at any other path if you want to do that (and if you are allowed to having write access). Just place an absolute path like \"/my/absolute/path\" to downloadFile or writeFile.\nBut to repeat it once more: there are specific restrictions on every OS and it depends on the systems permissions. If i understand you correctly there is no need to use your own absolute paths to access the applications folder. You should use these constants as their purpose is exactly that what you want to achieve: https://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs#constants\nYou would then write something like\nawait RNFS.mkdir( RNFS.DocumentDirectoryPath + '/my-fancy-directory)\ni guess you are working on android right?. Apparent your variable RNFileDownload is unassigned. Look for your import-statement.\nI will close due to inactivity. Pls feel free to reopen if your issue still persist. You should provide your code then including how you're importing RNFS.. Good catch! This way RNFSTemporaryDirectoryPath would point to the caching directory path of RNFSCacheDirectoryPath instead returning null. Thank you!. Published.. Thanks for reporting the issue! I fixed the catch-handler and just published 2.9.10!. i am going to close this one now. Feel free at any time to reopen if it still persists for you . This error happens because the image can't be found properly. You should always work with absolute Paths in order to reach the correct file: these constants will help you to find the best \"root\"-path depending on which location your image will be stored:  https://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs#constants. How did you saved your image and to which location? Also, in your latest code line you should omit the Dot in \"./image\". You don't need this when you're using the constants and also it can lead to errors . Android? How did you integrated this image in the app? In asset-Folder? raw? via downloadFIle()?. You need to give me more insides. Which platform do you use? And are we talking about the same that the Image will be stored really on device and not on a web platform/web application?. You could speed up any help if you would give more information. Where have you placed the image? Which folder? . Please post at least some code.\nAlso, on Android in specific cases the prefix \"file://\" is required!. Don't worry! These are just WARNINGS, no Errors! Similar warnings appear on \"react-native init testApp\". It has something to do with required versions in package.json and we need another approach here towards RN upgrades. But nothing will break here.. @no23reason please feel always free to send a PR :). Please ask in englisch. . sounds like a permission issue. There are several options for your case: if the images are downloaded from a network, you can save them everywhere where you have write success like in the applications documents-directory (see the constants for this in README). \nIf the images are originated by react-native-camera or similar libraries, you will get a cached filename and can move the file to the same location as mentioned in the top.\nIf you need to pick images from the picture roll, you can use this method: copyAssetsFileIOS. At zizzle we use this function to download large files and even show a progressbar at the bottom of the screen, while the user can navigate between different views without and freeze.\nSeems that something different is causing your issue. . Actually downloadFile should put the file where you tell it to put with the toFile-parameter. Works here on all projects and with all devices this way as documented in Readme.  I bet there must be another thing causing your issue.. Glad you've found it out!. Thx for pointing out!. Thx for feedback! Will merge.. Thanks for reporting! Most likely a normalizeFilePath(filepath) would solve this issue in Line https://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs/blob/master/FS.common.js#L328\nIs anyone willing to provide a PR? Otherwise i will fix it later by myself\n. Just released with 2.9.11. \nThank you!. Just released with 2.9.11. \nThank you!. The \"content://\"-scheme is currently not supported. I suppose it is android related right? \nWe definitely should add support for it.. i'm going to close this due to insufficient information that was provided here. Feel free to reopen if you want someone to help you. But then you should at least some lines of code that you wrote. Please provide us more information. . good catch! thx!. Please read my comment and suggestions towards this issue in the specific PR from @wd https://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs/pull/468#issuecomment-380806481. Thank you for this PR. \nI know what you try to solve and this would be a good fix for the colon-issue, but I am not sure if we would break something here, because in all other methods like \"readFile\" and so on nowhere the decode-function is used yet:\nFile file = new File(directory);\nagainst to \nFile file = new File(URLDecoder.decode(filepath, \"UTF-8\"));\nShouldn't we use the decode-function everywhere to be consistent?\nBut if we would do so, there could be compatibility issues towards those files that has been created in older versions of react-native-fs.\nI'd like to suggest to use the decode-function on all lines where a File-object will be created with a path-argument, but also we should provide a feature-flag, that will allow to switch to the \"old\"-mode. This feature flag would be placed best in the context of the RNFSManager instead of adding a separate argument to all those specific methods-\nWhat do you think?. Thank you very much!. Good catch! Thank you very much for contributing!. Just published :). We definetely should move the utf8-encoding into native layer instead of using JS-layer therefor. \nThis should be implemented in upcoming versions. Many thanks! Could you pls add some notes in the appropriate section of stat() in README? Thx!. Release is out. Thx for the reminder, @sesam !. Awesome, many thanks! Since you've added further commits afterwards during recent days, can we merge this now? . Please provide your code and configuration and tell us on which OS you was testing.\nIn general: download-process will not download byte by byte and trigger the progress-callback, it will download in larger chunks. If your file is smaller than a chunk, only one progress would be there. The end.\nAnyway, have you played with progressDivider?\nFrom README:\n\nIf options.progressDivider is provided, it will return progress events that divided by progressDivider.\nFor example, if progressDivider = 10, you will receive only ten callbacks for this values of progress: 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 Use it for performance issues. If progressDivider = 0, you will receive all progressCallback calls, default value is 0.. is .../assets a folder within the javascript-space? if so: no chances and beyond the scope of this library.. Fixed by https://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs/pull/502. Good catch, many thanks!. Thank you!. We should definitely update the buildToolsVersion to 26 right?. Thank you guys very much!. Statuscode will always be received by the server. So you need to fix the server where you want to download files from. I\u2018m going to close this with mentioned reasons.\n\nMaybe this helps: https://httpstatuses.com/206. Thank you vey much!. Thank you! I am going to close this PR as another Fix #585 was already merged for this issue. Please feel free to reopen if you are concerned about it.. thank you!. Wow! Good catch. Thank you!. Hi @mmerickel, thanx for reaching out! I think the only gap you were stumpled into was the 2.9.7 right? If i remember correctly, 2.9.7. was only a short sequenze of seconds the most recent on NPM and i needed to make a new release then on 2.9.9, which is covered in the release-section.\nFor every minor version change there is a section in the README covering PRs and what has changed. Anything else that i can do? Something to suggest?. Yes, you're right. The last 2 releases have uncomplete tags against to those before. I'm use a shell script for this stuff and will check it. Must be a bug in my deployment tool. Thanks for pointing out!\nTherefor i am going to close this issue. Next release will have complete tags again.. You're welcome!. @hejile a PR with fixes is always appreciated :) . Pretty cool! Thank you very much!. Merged. Many thanks!\n. Many thanks!. Its already fixed with latest release. pls update to https://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs/tree/v2.11.17. Have you tried to remove react-native-fs from node_modules directory and re-installing it?. Are you sure that the path-parameter is a valid string? \nPlease provide the result of\nconsole.log(path) \nbefore you call the exists()-method. Before the line \"RNFS.copyFileAssets(path, dest)\", please add the following code and show me the results:\nconsole.log(path, dest)\n. Ok, thx. \nNow place at the top of your code file the following line:\nvar normalizeFilePath = (path: string) => (path.startsWith('file://') ? path.slice(7) : path);\nand replace the line containing \"console.log\" like this:\n```\nconsole.log(normalizeFilePath(path));\nconsole.log(normalizeFilePath(dest));\n``\nWill this reproduce the error?. Hm.... strange. It should have raised the same error as mentioned in this issue. Will the code line containingRNFS.copyFileAssets` fire the error or does it happen somewhere else?. @mitevdev please upgrade this package to latest version. It should not give the error anymore.\nPlease feel free to reopen this issue, if the error persist.. I will fix moveFile as well, thanks for your hints!. #558 \n. released. thanx guys!. thx!. @skb1129 any advice how to make it backwards compatible?. One option could be that older RN versions should be fixed with v2.11.17:\n https://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs/tree/v2.11.17. thx!. Any news on this? With latest release this issue should be fixed in favour of Gradle 3 support.. @jonathangreco i am already on it :) \n@hank121314 \nJust added some hints. In particular, to remove the fileID/JobId  from onProgress-Event is against our documentation and would differ here from iOS-implementation. We should keep it to not break any existing software.. I'm ready to create a new release. Would you like to join testing current master with merged PR, @jonathangreco ?. Sure :) Which one is it? i'm testing the same here with https://zizzle.io :) . Wow! Sounds really interesting. Looking forward to see it in action!. v2.12.1 is out now\nThank you very much @hank121314 and @jonathangreco . Thank you!. thx man!. thx!. Thx!. Thx a lot!. Well, such things happen when you are blowing your devices memory with such a big file. It was never a good practice to load a file completely into memory. You should treat this instead on a chunk-by-chunk basis. \nBest thing here would be to find a library, that is capable of decrypting the crypt12-file. Then you can load this database (assuming it is Sqlite3 based) with react-native-sqlite-storage to dig trough the data.\nThere is little chance, that whatsapp is using sqlite-cipher for encyrption (DYOR pls). Then this issue should give you help: https://github.com/craftzdog/react-native-sqlite-2/issues/32. Thx a lot!. Hotfix is out. Please update to 2.13.2. Thank you very much! Hotfix is out.. thx! but i am going to close this in favour of #607 . If there were no urgent updates happened in latest releases i would go with @zizzle0 as we already did with other critical version upgrades of RN itself. \nv2.12 for those that want to be compatible with older Android 6.0, and all newer for the others.\nWhat do you think, @a-koka?. We are debating about how we should come to a consensus in your current Issue but without to complete ignore https://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs/pull/583, which solved an IntegerOverflow-Issue that happens on large files > 2 GB.\nI confirm that we can't ignore Android 6-users. And the use case with large files might be happen in only a few apps.\nI think the best approach would be to use the getContentLengthLong if it is available and otherwise fall back to the former version.\n. New release is out, supporting both Android 6 and also integer-overflow-fixed variant on Android 7, thx to @a-koka . Thx for PR. The discussion happens already here: https://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs/issues/606\n. thx man!. thx!. thx!. This code exists 3 times in the file now. In order to reduce duplicated code it would be better to have an own static method here called \"isImage\" that would be called from all 3 occurrences where this detection is needed. until this line it is the same in readFileRes, copyFileRes and existsRes. I understand the purpose, but wouldn't it make sense to isolate all this boilerplate in a separated private method and give it a callback what to do with it finally (reading, copying, existance-check) in order to reduce duplicated code and make it more clean. Thank you for contributing! I think it is not a good idea to deliver the current date on Android (as file.created will not be available). We should instead deliver \"null\" here to indicate that this attribute simply not exists. Can you change this that way? i will merge then. thx :). I would suggest to reject this promise with a meaningful error message . Can you add please again the File-Exists-check and throw an Exception, if the file does not exists? To not throw an exception would be compatibility break for all those that rely on this check in the thrown exception (instead of calling .exists() by themself in JS-layer). Pls note that this option is currently only working on iOS. i'd suggest to tell both methods to requiring/import the module. One for ES5 and one for ES6. Since most projects are based on ES6 in the meanwhile we should not show the ES5 syntax anymore so popular. What do you think?. Funny :) If you want to continue this conversation somewhere else (like FB) and miss my answer, please tag me or leave the link here that i can find it. . If i understood the code of \"public void getAllExternalFilesDirs(Promise promise){\" correctly it will return a promise with an array if Strings and not an Promise<FSInfoResult>, right?. Is it a good idea to remove the FileID? What if i would to assign the upload progress event to a particular File upload running multiple of them?. I think we should use a fixed buffer size depending on the available memory size of the device instead of 1 percent of the file length. If the user wants to upload a very big file, the app could crash because of \"Out of memory\" exception.\nSince this file length based approach was already present before this PR, it has not to be done here. Just an idea for further discussions and for next steps :) \nWhat do you think?. Also, the jobID-attribute is documented in README and part of the iOS-implementation also. Therefor we should keep it.. Ah yes, probably a misconception between jobID and fileID.\non iOS (and in Readme), the jobID is mandatory:\nhttps://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs/blob/master/RNFSManager.m#L601\n. As long as we keep this also by for Android i am fine with the changes.. What do you think, shall we solve this buffer size issue with another PR in favour of a fast merge of this one, @hank121314 ?. Sure. Looking forward. ",

I have merged this in. It has been tested in one of our in-house apps here, and also via the test repo (https://github.com/cjdell/react-native-fs-test/pull/6). This is covered by https://github.com/johanneslumpe/react-native-fs/pull/83 now, so I'm going to close this PR. Thanks for your contribution!. We'll still be using this for some time at our company - we've got 6 or 7 apps using it at the moment. However, we will investigate react-native-fetch-blob when we start our next project. \n\nOne thing that's worth pointing out though is that the name of this library is much better - especially for those from a Node.JS background. \nI want to access the file system - well, I use fs in Node so react-native-fs just makes sense.  Perhaps in the long term we could consider 'donating' the name to fetch-blob? (just an idea!). I've tested this my end and it works great - thanks for the PR! Merging now. @DaniilHarik I don't believe I have access, but I've asked @johanneslumpe if he's able to do it.. Thanks for this - I've closed it as a duplicate. The changes have been merged now. Thanks @DaniilHarik - these changes have been added in a different PR, so closing.. @adrienbataille If you do want to stick this this, our company will be using this repo on react native 0.40 pretty soon - so I'll take a look at the PRs (#229 looks most promising at a glance) and if it works I'll merge. . @adrienbataille Will do - thank you.\nI noticed that a newly created React Native project (react-native init) is targeting React ~15.4.0-rc.4 and so I may use that instead so new projects can use this library.\nEDIT: Though actually 15.4.2 is installed (I checked the npm shrinkwrap file) - so yes, I'll do as you suggested. @adrienbataille Ok, done. I've added a new pre-release version\n@johanneslumpe If you're happy, can you push the release to npm? . Looks good to me. I put in the same backwards-compatible fix on react-native-sound. If someone can confirm they've tested this PR on RN < 40 and RN 40+ I'll merge it. \nAway from office at the moment so can't test myself.. Thanks - I tried it here and worked well..

Great!, and yeah!, definitely most be asynchronous, but with this approach, i have just one concern, its not really bad.\nI am working in an app in wich a user can download certain contents, each content has many files to download, so i make use (extensively) of Promise.all()\nFor example:\nPromise.all(files.map(file =>\n    RNFS.download(options)\n))\n.then(results =>\n    // done\n);\nBut well, i will just have to make some adjustments to the map function, it will not be as clean as before, but is cleaner that the workaround that i had to make, than consisted on deleting the content from the downloaded contents db, and when the onBegin callback gets called, i check if the content still exists in the db, if not then immediately stops the download, it is not very semantic to be honest :p\n. Typo!, must be synchronous, not asynchronous hehe.\n. thats more ios/android related you have to store ir in a folder where only your app has access, i dont have the exact info but i am sure that you can find it on the corresponding documentation, also, in the readme file, there is a section that explains this module folder  constants.\n. as fas as i know, to write on disk with a base64 string like the example you posted, you need to strip the string so you only have the actual base64 string, like, the data:image/png; which its not part of the real base64, those are like headers for the browser so it knows its rendering a base64 image\n.

It's still a fact that bad bytesWritten is a bug that ought to be fixed.\nYes, the promise resolves IFF the download completes, but without bytesWritten, it's impossible to know whether the data you saved to disk is the data you expected. Common example: make an incorrect \"download\" request to a URL that responds with an error page. Naive download code will unwittingly save the error HTML as a file on the device. The workaround is to make a second FS call to get the size of the new file from disk, but that's additional complexity that this module is supposed to eliminate.\nFix this bug.. ",

Hi guys! Thanks for the research around this. It would be great to parallelize downloads.\n@itinance, why do you think that parallelizing may cause issues on some devices? . @itinance, any update on this for iOS? I'd love to have parallel downloads on iOS. Happy to help out if you haven't made much progress.. @codesinghanoop What about using a ThreadPoolExecutor instead of spawning a new Thread per download? I'm happy to provide a PR where the pool can be configured or perhaps just limit it to 8 simultaneous downloads.\nWhat do you think?. @codesinghanoop Can you help me understand why long tasks will definitely fail? I may be missing something here.\nI have a lot of experience with ThreadPoolExecutor. It can be configured to not have idle threads so there should not be an issue with idle threads. Plus the cost of spinning new threads for each download will be removed and faster download speeds as for the case explained below.\nFor apps like mine that need to download several images or other assets upon installation (which I assume is a common use case), devices end up spinning 40-50 (in my case) threads and parallel downloads at the same time. This causes slowness due to a high number of threads and multiple connections to download. Having a thread pool would greatly help with this.\nHope I'm not missing something here. Happy to submit a PR for review.. @itinance Sounds good. It's not at the top of my list but I would love to work on this and submit a PR in the next few weeks.. No, I've been waiting on someone who may know the answer.. Thanks for the update @wootwoot1234. Appreciate it! I'll leave this open for the authors to update the docs with this information.. There you go guys!. It appears that my emulator can't access the internet at all. Non-issue here. My bad.. Just upgraded to react-native@0.46.4 and it's still required.. Thanks for bringing this to my attention @zizzle0. Glad to know that Android 6.0 is no longer the market dominator but a 20% market share is still not something we can ignore. React native also sets minSdkVersion to 16 which is what most libraries support from what I've noticed.\nAn Integer contentLength could still download a 2 GB file which seems pretty large to me but perhaps I'm overlooking some use cases. We can also modify my PR to use the newer getContentLengthLong on devices it's available on.\nIs there a reason why we're debating merging this PR? Or are we debating releasing the change? I'm just a little confused regarding the proposal.. Excellent! I'll update the PR with that suggestion.. Fixes #606 . This should be merge-ready. Please let me know if it needs changes. Thank you!.

Here is the timeline of the edge case:\n\nJS component starts download & native component creates download task\nDownload completes; native component resolves the promise which queues the success callback to be run on the JS thread\nSomething triggers the JS component to want to cancel the download (such as an unmount)\nJS component still has not executed the success callback that has been queued on the native side, so it calls stopDownload() instead of doing nothing\nNative component creates an error and tries to reject the promise, which queues the error callback to be run on the JS thread\nThe success callback is finally run on the JS component\nThe error callback reaches React Native's MessageQueue.js, but the callback has already been freed from memory when the success callback was run\nA React Native error is triggered with the description \"Callback with id #: undefined.undefined() not found\". \n",

Yeah, that's because react-native guys don't publich react podspec into public repo, they ask you to use local dependency from within node_modules. This is only works for requiring it from Podfile,  can't be done for podspec. The original problem of the topic seems to be caused by the fact that subspec RCTImage of react-native is not installed.\n@colewinans can you share your Podfile and Podfile.lock?\nYou can also try fixing this by having this in your Podfile:\npod 'React', :path => '../node_modules/react-native', :subspecs => [\n        // other subspecs you may already have here \n        'RCTImage',\n    ]. This will also cause compile time error for those who updated to react-native 0.47. @itinance the breaking change was introduced in recent release 0.47.0 of react-native.\nThe mentioned method is no longer exists in RN api in java. This means all libraries which still have this @Override... are no longer compatible with latest release of RN.\nI am not entirely sure if the library will still be working with previous versions of RN without this method howerver I would say this method should be removed from the mainstream so people who already updated to 0.47 can use it normally. Those who didn't - can still use previous versions or fork with backports.. @Buthrakaur I agree, you should also update version of react-native in package.json to be greater than 0.47.0.\nside question: doesn't it have to defined it as peerDependency as well?. this is all due encoding that is done on js side.\nrnfs does coding in js https://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs/blob/master/FS.common.js#L158-L166\nthe competing rnfb does this in native https://github.com/joltup/rn-fetch-blob/blob/master/ios/RNFetchBlobFS.m#L506-L531\nI had to switch to rnfb, reading large json files is around 10-100 times faster now\nthis is also true for ios btw.

I added it to preserve an error code (ENOENT/EISDIR) in rejected promise, because I moved error handling to other methods that do not take Promise as an input. I'd be glad to hear if there's a better way to do it.. @ankag94 I have tested this PR on several Android versions (API 23, 25). An exception you're getting may be caused by calling getContentResolver() from reactContext instead of the context of activity that has requested the file or trying to open an Uri that has not been requested by the app. How do you obtain your uri/path?. @annammarri getInputStream() is available only internally in native Android code. You can use one of the methods annotated with @ReactMethod. And yes - it means that you can't read the file piece by piece, as if you would do it using streams \ud83d\ude1e. @imran1992, please see what console.log(RNFS.DocumentDirectoryPath) prints, I think you meant to use RNFS.ExternalDirectoryPath or RNFS.ExternalStorageDirectoryPath.. When you do val = func(), val contains the Promise, not the result of promise. You have to await your func, which returns a promise returning parsed file, i.e. val = await func(). When you use such syntax, the containing function also has to be async.. If you want to console.log an object, you can do it like this:\njs\n  console.log(\"found:\\t\" + JSON.stringify(files))   // found:   {\"something\":{\"blah\":\"x\"}}. Ah, according to this thread on StackOverflow Android will return null when path does not exist. Can you first try to check if the directory exists?.

React Native is numbered sequentially, I think the correct spec would be something like\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    \"react-native\": \">=0.51 <1\"\n},\nHowever, one of the reasons React Native is not yet 1.x is that there can (and often are) breaking changes between minor releases. Therefore I believe a strict peerDependency spec is a good thing here as it tells you \"This has been tested on this release of React Native and it works. Any other might not work properly\".. ",

It's the whole point of this workaround. Catch it and do what you need to do :). Hi can you provide some code that you're using to \"looped with downloadFile()\".\nThe way you'll handle the promise may be related to your issue. But we can't tell anything with juste the behaviour.\nA way to go is maybe download a ZIP file instead images directly, then unzip it at the right location.. Ok problem solved.\nThe documentation should say that fields section cannot take JSON, because it's sent in the Query and will be unusable.\nThe solution is to make a second fetch in the promise to send the Json in another endpoint.. Solved it was a missconfiguration server side.\n. Another error with android, if we have 4 files to send, we will have 4 progress (one for each file) it's amazingly long compare to IOS.\nThe weird thing at the second progress, my server have already the 4 files..\nSo 4 progress one for each files, all amazingly long.\nBut at the end of the first progress my server have all already.\nPlease fix this.. @itinance Hi, can you tell me if you have the same issue ? Do you need more informations ?. @hank121314 thx, the problem occured on \nAndroid device 'SM-T580 - 7.0'\n. Hey @hank121314  I will test this tomorrow, really thank you for digging into this issue.. Ok our team tested your work, bytes sent are faster, it seems correct.. Thanks I don't know if it's an issue but I've also 4 progress events for 4 files. Can you make sure that this is what we want to have one progress per file ? (On IOS there is only one progress, for all of files to upload). We will now. Thanks !\nEDIT : All working good.

    "llamaluvr": "Looks like previous issues reporting this error were frequently with ejected Expo/ CRNA apps. I, too, saw this error after installing and linking on my ExpoKit project. The missing step was restoring my cocoapods after linking.\nSo, for ExpoKit, the steps are:\n1. NPM/ yarn install\n2. react-native link react-native-fs\n3. Change to the ios directory\n4. pod install. One troublesome thing about this error with respect to CRNA/ Expo is I just noticed is that it happens when you simply import RNFS from 'react-native-fs' without even using it. This means, you can't do something like only turning on your filesystem-API-dependent features based on the availability of the plugin, as you typically can when referencing something from NativeModules), e.g.,\n```\nimport RNFS from 'react-native-fs';\nif (RNFS) {\n // Do file-specific stuff\n}\n```\nHaving the ability to turn off a native module is great if you want to still run most of your code in the Expo client during the development process. I think of it as kind of like being able to build most of a Cordova app by debugging in a web browser, and then only building it into an actual native app when you're ready to test native-specific features/ test end-to-end.\nOf course, it's also kind of nice that you get an error when not everything is restored correctly on the native side for when you do intend to run in your actual ExpoKit standalone app..

Update : \nChanged my function to \n```\ncreateOrGetFilePath(){\n        let filePath = fs.DocumentDirectoryPath + '/videos/';\n        return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n            fs.exists(filePath)\n              .then((exists) => {\n                  if(!exists){\n                      fs.mkdir(filePath)\n                      .then(()=>resolve(filePath))\n                      .catch((error) => reject(error));\n                  } else{\n                      resolve(filePath);\n                  }\n              })\n              .catch((error) => reject(error));\n        });\n    }\n```\nNow works well.\nI was considering return of RNFS.exists() method to be boolean. Rather it was a promise to return boolean. Once I got that right, the \"False positive report of path existing\" was solved, and file was downloaded.\nActually, a promise object, when typecasted to boolean (Since it was used in an if(...) ) is always true. Even a promise to return void will be true if converted to boolean.\nThe problem was that I was not listening to promise of knowing if the path is ready. And funny enough, the promise code is executed only when you call it's \"then\" method, which my old implementation didn't, so the directory was never created.. ",
