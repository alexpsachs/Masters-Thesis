    "nitrada": "for the presets, i think it would be great to be able to have subfolders. this would allow to sort different types of data into different folders, like \"contacts\" vs. \"products\" vs. \"emails\" etc. this should then also be somehow reflected in the UI.\n. we're currently using pngs for icons as well. would already be great to use svgs instead so the colors are flexible. \nA svg couldn't be used as a rectangle background though. an idea: we set a placeholder icon in the desired size and color and replace it with the svg asset. The size and color should be adapted programmatically. \n. @z-vector could you specify \"strange things\"? \n. Select all groups that contain the placeholders. for example, selecting the parent group or artboard would lead to populating the same dataset to all children.\nAlso make sure the groups you populate with images or icons are no symbols. otherwise, they will be synced, just like all other elements in symbols (apart from text, which can be excluded).\n. @fculshaw this is not yet possible but exactly what we need. :)\n. @VinSpee @fculshaw @clarklab @theoBLT \nSince v1.3.0, this is fully supported, including nested arrays. Please let us know if you run into issues.\n. It IS in there, isn't it? @ricburton \n. Alright. \ud83d\ude0e\n. \"Populate from URL\" command?\n. I read about people rather writing a helper app to get and play around with data from an API, but store it as local JSON and assets, ready for use for the plugin. \nBest of both worlds: real-time access to an API, but the performance from local files.\n. @tdemooij is it fast enough (given hundreds of images)?\n. We decided to keep it a locally operating kick ass plugin for now ;-)\nwe'll rather investigate in tools to gather/model data from different sources more easily.\n. @lajlev that's because once populated, the text {placeholders} lose their meaning. the image layers names remain the same though.\n. @lajlev I think we have an idea how to fix this (need to persist the original string with {placeholders} before populating a text layer). working on it.\n. it's now possible to re-populate text layers:\nhttps://github.com/preciousforever/sketch-data-populator/commit/db3d45cdb900f33d5d340dd115495466b6702542\n. you can re-populate images because they keep their {placeholder} layer name.\nnaming the text layer itself {placeholder} doesn't work since you can use several placeholders in one text layer (for concatenation, e.g. \"{first_name} {last_name}\" or \"{quantity} x {price} = {subtotal}\"). layout and truncation would be awkward with several text layers. \nbut as commented in #10, we're already working on a solution to be able to re-populate text layers.\n. @lukas77me I think that's a great idea! It should still be possible to set a \"default string\" (to get rid of \"undefined\") somewhere globally in the bundle, don't you think?\n@rockitbaby what do you think about the syntax? any recommendation beyond the \"?\"?\n. also, if a image/icon field ist empty, why not turn off the fill? this way, it would be possible to place a bg (representing an image/icon \"placeholder\") behind the actual asset {placeholder} that becomes visible once there's no actual data.\nwhen re-populating, filled image/icon fields should turn the fill on again.\nexample: https://www.dropbox.com/s/yzjcbvdy7mvs8b3/image-placeholders.sketch.zip?dl=0\n. our heavy usage of the plugin has shown that we always need to try to keep our {placeholders} as short as possible. For example, {first_name} {last_name} is too long \u2013 if you populate it with hundreds of names, the placeholders will still most often be longer than the actual data. We'd rather go for {firstname} {lastname} or even {firstn} {lastn}.\nSo adding \"? No First Name\", leading to {firstn ? No First Name} can be quite counterproductive in that regard.\nOn the other hand, if we have something like a global \"no data\" string configured, which could be used in 80% of the cases, it should be ok. So the behavior could be:\n{placeholder} -> no data = empty string\n{placeholder ?} -> no data = global no data string\n{placeholder ? No data available} -> no data = \"No data available\"\nRegarding the syntax: as short as possible, but also meaningful would be best. I was thinking about something like this \u2013 not sure if it makes sense though\n{placeholder!No data available}\nMeans:\n- no spaces\n- ! instead of ?\nDoes this make sense @lukas77me @rockitbaby?\n. now possible since v1.1.0\n. @rorysmyth yeah, that's the case unfortunately and we haven't found a way around it. I fear it has to do with a limitation on the Sketch side and we cannot really solve it for the plugin.\nAny comment on this from @lukas77me or @bomberstudios?\n. @lukas77me maybe this could hint to a solution? https://medium.com/sketch-app-sources/sketch-plugin-snippets-for-plugin-developers-e9e1d2ab6827 (scroll down to \"Working with Text Layers\")?\n. Yes, the plugin persists the original string with its {placeholders} in the text layer. We do this to be able to populate again without the need to manually set new placeholders. Like that, you can for example shuffle through dozens of data. \nTo get rid of it, use the \"Restore Placeholders\" command. This will remove it from the text layer and write back the original string into the layer. From here, you can use the layer as a regular text layer again \u2013 or go on and populate it again. \nDoes this work for you, @mvdandrieux?\n. @Booozz this should work! Like @maxfell said, select all elements and run the command. Let us know if this doesn't work.\n. @maxfell thank you! :)\n. @dinko fixed with https://github.com/preciousforever/sketch-data-populator/commit/5f9dd947fe56bb92f384d0f8750adf3493c5115d\n. @dinko it's in the \"development\" branch. could you check it out and let us know if this fix works for you?\n. @lukas77me can you merge?\n. @lukas77me didn't we fix this for \"Place image/SVG\"?\n. That would be useful! \n. fixed with https://github.com/preciousforever/sketch-data-populator/commit/45f9adceaedf65a2ad37aad041c5e6023095c918\n. @lukas77me I have not tested with 3.4 beta yet. Did you?\n. @clarklab it seems to work with commands that are not using the plugin UI (see @lukas77me's explanation). we're still investigating, since this bug seems pretty odd.\n. @justinlwz @clarklab can you try the latest version of the plugin and let us know if the fix works for you guys?\n. hey @kmerc, does this new release help you? https://github.com/preciousforever/sketch-data-populator/releases/tag/v1.2.1\n. @kmerc have you figured this out? does the current version of the plugin work for you?\nrelated: https://github.com/preciousforever/sketch-data-populator/issues/30, https://github.com/preciousforever/sketch-data-populator/issues/34\n. hey @waltercoots, did @lukas77me explanation help you?\n. thanks for your contribution, @JakeLin! this addition addresses a pretty common need (we had it here, but also people got in touch about it).\nwe had a lively discussion though if we consider color values data (or content), or if this isn't rather something for another plugin (eg. a \"conditional design\" plugin). but i think we shouldn't be too strict here for now, especially as long as there's no other way to do it.\n. nested data should be possible since v1.2.1, do you have the latest version of the plugin? https://github.com/preciousforever/sketch-data-populator/releases/tag/v1.2.1\n. have you figured this out, @alexcolbeck?\nrelated: https://github.com/preciousforever/sketch-data-populator/issues/24, https://github.com/preciousforever/sketch-data-populator/issues/34\n. yeah, the syntax was only in the release note, not in the readme. will update.\n. No, it's not possible and not planned. We prefer to keep all data and assets local for performance reasons. \n. we often use the plugin to populate huge amounts of elements, which can be quite slow already with local images. That's why we're not looking into adding the feature. \nIn case you want to give it a try, feel free to add and send a pull request :)\n. have you tried https://import.io/ \n. now possible https://github.com/preciousforever/sketch-data-populator/pull/33\n. @fortress can you share your sketch and json files with us and let us know which version of sketch and which version of the plugin you're using?\n. @alexcolbeck thanks for suggesting it! :)\n. this should be possible since https://github.com/preciousforever/sketch-data-populator/releases/tag/v1.2.1\u2014 shouldn't it, @lukas77me?\n. @sdnyco I was wrong actually \u2013 at the time I replied it was possible to use nested data via dot path, but it's only since v1.3.0 that nested arrays do work. can you give it a go with the recent version of the plugin and let us know if it worked?\n. @epan thanks for reporting this, very strange and never happened to us. Which version of sketch did you use? Also, did you try to take elements to populate to another sketch document and see what happens there?\n. It looks like there's a problem with your data. Could you share your JSON file?\nBefore that: is the content of your \"My API\" file valid JSON? It should be an array on the root level. Also, please try to call your file \"something.json\".\n. @imvunoah \nI just checked the output and as expected, the JSON was missing an array on the root level: the [] brackets (check out this JSON primer for more detailed info). Also, please use .json at the end of your file.\nHere's your example data with the root array added:\njson\n[{\n  \"id\": \"49020834\",\n  \"title\": \"My First Post Sample\",\n  \"slug\": \"my-first-post-sample\",\n  \"content\": \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit\u2026\",\n  \"date-created\": \"2013-03-26-13-59-59\",\n  \"date-modified\": \"2013-04-09-15-01-49\",\n  \"thumbnail\": \"http://lorempixel.com/400/400\",\n  \"tags\": \"web development, api, demo, example, node\"\n}]\nThis is how it would look like if there's more than one object in the array:\njson\n[{\n  \"id\": \"49020834\",\n  \"title\": \"My First Post Sample\",\n  \"slug\": \"my-first-post-sample\",\n  \"content\": \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit\u2026\",\n  \"date-created\": \"2013-03-26-13-59-59\",\n  \"date-modified\": \"2013-04-09-15-01-49\",\n  \"thumbnail\": \"http://lorempixel.com/400/400\",\n  \"tags\": \"web development, api, demo, example, node\"\n},\n{\n  \"id\": \"49020835\",\n  \"title\": \"My Second Post Sample\",\n  \"slug\": \"my-second-post-sample\",\n  \"content\": \"Dolor dicta in at error ipsam vel ipsum odit tempora ipsa nulla facere\u2026\",\n  \"date-created\": \"2013-03-26-14-00-00\",\n  \"date-modified\": \"2013-04-09-15-01-50\",\n  \"thumbnail\": \"http://lorempixel.com/401/401\",\n  \"tags\": \"web development, api, demo, example, node\"\n}]\nHope this helps. I tested the JSON on my end and it worked.\n. Which example do you mean?\nOur JSON data usually consist of dozens or hundreds of objects and we preferred to put them in an array on the root level. \nWe could consider making it work without an array if there's only one object \u2013 or even if there's a list of objects. It's a matter of taste probably. What do you think, @lukas77me?\n. @imvunoah apart from that, does adding the array fix it for you for now?\n. @daniloq is the JSON you pasted here exactly the one you used? there's a closing curly bracket (}) missing in the second object (id 2). Maybe that's the problem?\n. @daniloq I just tried with you data and it worked fine. btw, the populating is much faster if your images are locally stored in a subfolder\u2026\ndo you have your sketch layers containing \"{name}\", \"{image}\" and {location} in a layer group each, all on the same level?\n. That's a sketch feature request :)\n. @leffi7 the only workaround is not using a symbol ;-) have you tried using styles instead of a symbol, or a different nesting?\n. hey @leffi7, that's not possible with Sketch Data Poplator's internal grid tool at the moment, since placeholders containing arrays need to be manually set up. what you could do is create the grid with Sketch's grid tool, then rename the text layers manually, then populate.\nthat's actually something we're currently thinking about: make it Data Populator more data-driven. \nright now, the paradigm is: create the layers to be populated first, then populate them with data. so if you use the internal grid tool, you probably noticed it always first creates the grid with the elements, then populates afterwards. there's no real connection between the elements and the data \u2013 Data Populator just runs over all selected elements and populates them if they contain placeholders. you could create a grid with 3 columns and 4 rows, and if your data contains 20 data sets, 8 of them will remain unpopulated.\nthe limitation is there's only one level of grids, and that grid is arbitrary. in your example data, there could be several levels of grids. we're exploring ways to incorporate this, where you rather add grid properties as meta data (tags) to the layers or layer groups to be populated. like this, you could have grids within grids, and we would always populate what's in the data (unless you probably limit a grid with a MAX property)\u2026 \ndoes this help for now? if you have ideas or specific requirements, let us know!\n. @rockitbaby @lukasondrej  thoughts?\n. @lukasondrej is this PR compatible with the sketch-3.5-support branch? we should then merge everything into master\n. That's fine!\n. @gunkdesign does it work with the latest version of the plugin? https://github.com/preciousforever/sketch-data-populator/releases/tag/v1.7.1\n. @alex-colbeck this is how you address arrays properly:\nhttps://github.com/preciousforever/sketch-data-populator/releases/tag/v1.3.0\n{categories.name} would work if you'd have nested objects, not an array within an object. am I right @rockitbaby?\ndoes this solve it for you, @alex-colbeck?\n. @deepesh55 can you send your sketch file to feedback@datapopulator.com?\n. @alex-colbeck can you share an excerpt of your JSON?\n. is the issue fixed for you as well, @deepesh55? \n. we're investigating. \n. Yeah, it's double brackets. But also, the SVG stuff is a bit shaky, since loading external SVGs is more complex than loading an image. \n. that's nothing we're going to implement in the near future, but feel free to contribute :-)\n. We're investigating. \n. @sweeting we're still having several issues, but you can check this out: https://github.com/preciousforever/sketch-data-populator/releases/tag/v1.6-beta.1\n. @skipjack have you tried using {name} in the content of the layer inside the symbol? Like this, the placeholders always remain unpopulated and the populated data is just in the overrides. . @skipjack you don't need to detach them. They can have different data in each instance although they have the same placeholder in the symbol!. @skipjack sorry, no video tutorials. but have you checked the demo.sketch?\nwhat about creating different nested symbols, each with their own data key {placeholder}? you could then use swapSymbol to change them driven by data\u2026. (regarding the feature you mentioned earlier: would be great if you coud open a new issue as a feature request. demo would be helpful, too!). wasn't this always the case, @lukasondrej? maybe there's a way to get rid of the need to set the background type to image as soon as we knock on a shape's door with an image in our pocket :)\n. @lukasondrej great \ud83d\udc4d \n. Unfortunately, you cannot use several styles within one text layer with data populator. \n. ah it's with the new symbols \u2013 sorry, things have changed here :) we'll investigate. \n. can you elaborate a bit more please. i'm not sure if i get you 100%. maybe also show the error case (as the example on the right looks also correct although there's no substitute\u2026 or do i still get you wrong?\n. @r-ss-ll on my machine, the substitutes don't work at all (see https://github.com/preciousforever/sketch-data-populator/issues/58), can you upload the file you showed in this issue so we can investigate?\n@lukasondrej here's a related substitute issue.\n. @russgoodman can you try this with the current version of the plugin?. @whosdustin feel free to add the feature and send us a pull request :)\nif you just prefer YAML to edit the data, you could \u2013 in the meantime \u2013 use some yaml-to-json converter before populating.\n. @lukasondrej can you reproduce this? it happened to me as well. Can send you the doc. \n. I will share my doc later today.\n. @F-DK can you try the new version? https://github.com/preciousforever/sketch-data-populator/commit/6ef513309e51ff151cdb2b8945b7e495a7d089b7\n. here's a new pre release:\nhttps://github.com/preciousforever/sketch-data-populator/releases/tag/v1.6-beta.2\nI recommend you use this version in parallel by renaming a) the bundle file and b) the \"name\" field in \"manifest.json\" within the plugin bundle (\"Show Content\" on \"Sketch Data Populator.sketchplugin\" plugin bundle).\n. @F-DK https://github.com/preciousforever/sketch-data-populator/releases/tag/v1.6-beta.3\n. @r-ss-ll you populated symbols (in sketch 3.7), right?\n. here's a test file \u2013 try populating the \"item two\" symbol with the \"missing-data\" preset that comes with the demo. re-populate until you run into an empty field.\ndatapop new symbols.sketch.zip\n@lukasondrej does it crash on your setup as well?\n. @lukasondrej will check.\n. @lukasondrej seems to work now. the text formating behavior is a bit strange still, will go into detail sometime later. https://github.com/preciousforever/sketch-data-populator/releases/tag/v1.6-beta.3\n. multiline text is not yet supported as it involves the rather complex topic of \"flow layouting\"\u2026\n. @russgoodman @PDXIII multi line text is now possible, but not yet well documented. We'll update the readme/documentation in the first week of January.\nShort version: \nappend a Layer name (in the Layers Inspector) with -l n  \u2014 set n as the max number of lines in a fixed size text layer. For example, Layer name | -l 3 will turn the Text Layer into a box with 3 lines (if there's enough data).. now documented in the https://github.com/preciousforever/sketch-data-populator/blob/master/README.md\na better demo.sketch will follow.. Can you send JSON and sketch file to feedback@datapopulator.com?\n. @mrkevanlin understandable. can you try populating a) without SVG (that feature is shaky) and b) just one SVG per group?\n. Can you check this @lukasondrej?\n. @acleave thanks for reporting! We'll release an update that will improve populating sysmbols sometime in January 2017.. @acleave we reworked the nested symbols populating behavior in v2.0.2: https://github.com/preciousforever/sketch-data-populator/releases/tag/v2.0.2\nplease check it out and let us know if everything works for you!. thanks @lukasondrej!. @rorysmyth in order to make iconfonts work with data populator, we needed to make a few minor changes. just get rid of the curly brackets in the layer name and it should work. \nwe're close to release a completely refactored version of the plugin and there will be more documentation coming with that. for a sneak peak, you can check the \"refactoring\" branch...\n. @rorysmyth you'll like \" | -l n\" if you're into truncating text ;-)\n. Thanks for pointing @bomberstudios!\n. hey @russgoodman, can you elaborate a bit more? give an example?\n. @Ninerian no, it doesn't replace Layer or layer Group names \u2013 just the content of Text Layers or \"Image Layers\". You can use a {placeholder} in a Text Layer name as a proxy to replace the whole Text Layer with respective data (that's eg useful for IconFonts).. our desired behavior is: 'clear' reverts a selected text layer to its initial {placeholder}. this means there can only be ONE placeholder per layer. \nwe did this because sometimes, we were quite irritated ourselves when we used an already populated layer, overwrote its data with another placeholder \u2013 but populating would always use the original placeholder, because it is stored in the layer as meta data. that's quite unpredictable.\nalso, we wanted a 'clear' that's really solid and works across different versions of the plugin (meta data on layers get usually linked to a specific plugin identifier). this is something we changed/added at some point. \nfor us, this behavior works much better and is above all predictable. no surprises. \nif this makes your work more inefficient, could you please elaborate a bit more on what your desired 'clear' behavior would be?. @marcelosomers should be fixed with v2.0.2:\nhttps://github.com/preciousforever/sketch-data-populator/releases/tag/v2.0.2. great, thanks!. that's awesome, @shannon-murdoch-webjet! \nwould be so cool if you could share that \"flight data card\" example including the JSON for it. great source for learning! ;-). @mlindholm can you try downloading the latest release and installing it as described in the readme?. hey @evandeininger, v2.0.1 should fix this: \nhttps://github.com/preciousforever/sketch-data-populator/releases. Thanks for reporting. We had it fixed earlier but i only pushed the release after you created the issue! :-). @vladmoroz as a conditional action, you mean? meaning you can change this setting driven by data?. > respect layer's pattern fill type and not overwrite it\nthat's something we could do, right @lukasondrej? (i think when we implemented it back then there were no options for the fill). thanks @rezaarkan @vladmoroz @shannon-murdoch-webjet!\nplease check out v2.1.2\nhttps://github.com/preciousforever/sketch-data-populator/releases. Thanks! We're going to check it out!. Hey @eob, I have checked out your Cloudstitch plugin and found it pretty cool. The ease to set up data, instead of writing JSON is impressive. \nAs I wrote in this article (https://medium.com/sketch-app-sources/designing-with-meaningful-data-5456b40e172e?source=linkShare-345ea3b8842a-1486889395) I'm not convinced it's always the best goal to make a designer's life more easy and convenient. Working with real data, and digging through APIs and JSON structure makes them more data literate and I'm convinced that's important. \nOn the other hand I have learned to appreciate spreadsheets as a great design tool to design for different contexts at the same time by using formula for dimensions and proportions. So for sure, working with data in spreadsheets also adds to a designer's data structures education. \nBut I would expect to be able to also work with more complex data structures: how can I populate a spreadsheet with two dimensions (as in a real data table)? Or how can I use a spreadsheet for nested data?\nIt's not well documented, but Data Populator has the capability to populate from a two dimensional TSV. The structure you need to prepare for that within Sketch is very restrictive, or strict and we're not so happy about his. But we were able to show it's possible. Can you imagine investigating here? I think this would be so much better if you could leapfrog the whole TSV process and just connect to a service like Cloudstitch. \nSo what I think is that I'd like to include Cloudstitch features into Data Populator. But I would expect it to become more sophisticated in the long run. \nSomething else I figured where I see room for improvement: we went down the path of using local JSON and introducing the Presets feature because we found that populating performance is so much better. That's why for now, we avoided something like \"Populate from URL\". Images can be URLs, but this already slows down the process.\nIf we integrate Cloudstitch features into Data Populator, I think there's still room for a Cloudstitch plugin you could offer your customers as a direct link to Sketch. I would just expect it to become more individual then \u2013 not have all the other Data Populator features, its own readme etc. It could become a bit of a maintenance nightmare otherwise (and it's already a bit irritating in Sketch Runner).\nWhat do you think?\n. @eob check out these files to see a demo of the 'Populate Table' command as it's currently implemented: PopulateTable.zip. Will check out the blog post!\nI think \u2013 apart from maintenance \u2013 the biggest issue with overlapping commands is if you use Sketch Runner \u2013 what you get is duplicate commands (same command names, descriptions and icons!). We'll look into the PR!\nThe biggest issue I have with our \"populate table\" (apart from the need to manually export the data via TSV, which Cloudstitch fixes! :) is that the elements to be populated are determined by a very strict layer structure: you need certain names, levels and order of things. That's pretty restrictive. I think it would be much better if this would be done by their x/y coordinates on the artboard. What do you think?. @guillaumechabot thanks! can you describe step by step what you are doing? still don't fully get what the issue is, sorry.. @guillaumechabot did you populate the artboard name before? what's weird is that usually if you clear a layer (or artboard), it should go back to the original {placeholder}\u2026\nmaybe @lukasondrej has an idea.. that's a Sketch Runner issue.. @ployer900 can you please describe your issue with more details and give us an a example file to investigate?. @ericazf make sure the Layer (in the Layers list on the left) is not called {streetname}. otherwise, the {placeholder} used in the Layer name will always overwrite all other {placeholders} inside a Text Layer's content (that's necessary if you use Iconfonts).. hidden + hypen means there's no corresponding data in the JSON. since the JSON shown above has these data, it could also be that the layer was populated with other data before.\ncan you select the layer that is not working and clear it? if it shows {something} after clearing, replace this with your desired concatenation and it should work.\n(the main issue here is that you cannot see on the UI if a layer already has data. we have some ideas here\u2026). you're welcome!. If layer names or text layer content do not have a {placeholder} in them, they are automatically excluded. It might be that your layers that get overwritten with an empty string had been populated before. Try the Clear command to see if that's the case. Hope that helps!. @timothyachumba what is the layer called (in the layers list)?. @adamkirkwood \u2705. @lukasondrej do we really have (or want to have) that constraint?. @henryhadlow have you tried without ID and it didn't want to? Can you try again?. @lukasondrej what do you think?. we're still thinking about it\u2026 :). @bottledsmoke feel free to fork off and PR :). @bottledsmoke still up for helping out to make it work? :). @mhcom feel free to contribute. we'll evaluate every single PR! :) . @skipjack @bottledsmoke @mhcom we're trying to get this working for v3.0.3!. @skipjack please check out v3.0.3!\nhttps://www.datapopulator.com/sketch/changelog.html. @rohr thanks for the nice words!\nthe example you referenced is the #swapSymbol conditional action, which is a generic way to swap a symbol based on a certain condition \u2013 eg if the string in the data contains a certain content (eg. \u201cblue\u201d) or amount of characters, swap the symbol to symbol XY (eg. symbol name \u201cblue\u201d). \nso in the example, the {color} placeholder is being used to set the symbol name \u2013 it could also be {whatever} though, color is just an example here.\nthe part we won\u2019t do is using hex values in data to set hex values for objects in Sketch, because we think that\u2019s too specific and we don\u2019t need it for our own requirements. but feel free to change or extend the plugin to your liking, it\u2019s open source and the architecture is quite accessible and modular. . @lukasondrej will have a look once he's back from his vacation (this week).. it should work with this release: https://github.com/preciousforever/sketch-data-populator/releases/tag/v2.2.0\nplease let us know if you're still running into troubles!. @bomberstudios ready with this release:\nhttps://github.com/preciousforever/sketch-data-populator/releases/tag/v2.2.0. @adamdiestelkamp great idea! it's open source, feel free to contribute the feature! =). @chanjohnathan i'm not sure what you mean exactly. your example already works if you use {status.status1} or {type.type1} etc.\nPlease refer to #45 and #49 . Hey @meganfrankosky, which version of Sketch and Data Populator do you use? And what do you mean with \"inserted symbol\"?. @meganfrankosky @sixtyfourthirtytwo please update the plugin to v2.2.0 and let us know if it works. great, you're welcome :). @andyra @fonograph we'll actually not be able to make #show, #hide and #delete actions work within symbols. but #swapSymbol now works well in nested symbols and also with Libraries. for now, you could create a condition that swaps to an \"invisible\" symbol, but we're going to make it possible to swap to None (= no symbol selected) with \u2013 most likely \u2013 the syntax eg. [#swapSymbol[\"{name}\".length > 0] \u2014 so if you don't provide a symbol name like [#swapSymbol[\"{name}\".length > 0, symbolname], it will swap the symbol to None. please check out v3.0.3!\nhttps://www.datapopulator.com/sketch/changelog.html. It's not working, since a Layer Group is treated like a regular Layer. But I agree it could be helpful in some cases \u2013 and since we also added that support for Artboards\u2026. @rynhsy AFAIK, this is required by Sketch to work.. @niksmac can you provide an example use case?. Maybe there should be a Filter that allows basic mathematical operations:\n{quantity * rate} \u20ac \u2192 {3 * 4,99} \u20ac \u2192 14,97 \u20ac\n{rowvalue * 12} \u2192 {10 * 12} \u2192 120\n${=SUM(value1,value2,value3)} \u2192 ${=SUM(10,20,30)} \u2192 $60\nI guess this would also need rounding and decimals parameters then\u2026. @niksmac maybe you're interested in working on such filter? I think most things are already there and could be integrated via existing frameworks. Data Populator's API is pretty basic and open as it is all based on JavaScript\u2026. that would be great!. @niksmac did you look into adding those basic math filters? ;-). @Oli4k \nwe never deeply investigated to use json via a URL due to performance. if you use massive data with loads of images, i assume it will take a remarkable amount of time between running the populate command and seeing the result. \non the other hand i totally understand your reasoning \u2013 why not point to a json somewhere instead of just files on your hard drive. especially since this would allow much more dynamic use cases with different API calls in the url etc. \n@lukasondrej \ni think we should investigate. also, i think it would be even more powerful if we could somehow connect to PAW, which would allow to even use protected APIs and a lot of convenient features to gather data (https://paw.cloud/. post-request hooks is the relevant keyword. \n. Pssst, something's cooking around this topic! We'll keep you posted.. @lyapustin only a few days left until a new release. stay tuned!. @lyapustin @lpredster @Oli4k @csantiago132 please get in touch via feedback@datapopulator.com if you'd like to get a sneak peek of the next version of data populator!. i\u2019m closing this issue as populate from URL is now available. if you run into bugs or have some feedback, please open new issues :tada: . @florianpnn not sure I got the issue right, but all those work for me:\n\"a\": \"1000\",\n\"b\": 1000,\n\"c\": 1.000. does v2.2.1 work for you all?. does v2.2.1 work for you all?. hey, something\u2019s broken in 48 and we\u2019ll ty to fix it soon. it seems it\u2019s again a general issue with image placeholders, not just symbol overrides. \nthanks for using the plugin and providing your feedback!. this should fix the issues with 48:\nhttps://github.com/preciousforever/sketch-data-populator/releases/tag/v2.2.2. @andyra great to hear this! :)\nbtw, from v2.2.2 on, the internal sketch update mechanism will work for data populator. . hey all, please check out v2.3.1 \u2013 we optimized the way you manage your preset library and the plugin bundle now doesn't contain any images anymore, making internal updates much faster.\nwould be great to hear if it works well for you!\nhttps://github.com/preciousforever/sketch-data-populator/releases/tag/v2.3.1. @thierryc it's in v2.2.2. thanks a lot!. @nwpappas check this out:\nhttps://github.com/preciousforever/sketch-data-populator/pull/126. yeah, we\u2019ll release a new version soon. thanks again!. introduced with v2.3.2. @fotini-ioak try using it like this \u2013 it should work:\n\"phone\": \"070 123 456 789\". @lukasondrej can you look into the symbols in Sketch 49 issue?. @lukasondrej please note that it was already an issue with sketch 45 https://github.com/preciousforever/sketch-data-populator/issues/104. @hlambert we're aware of those issues and @lukasondrej will look into it next week.. @andyra  @hlambert @setheryb @patowod @pieterh83 please update to version 3.0.2 and tell us if it now works for you! \nhttps://www.datapopulator.com/sketch/. can you try closing sketch and re-opening it and then test populating a simple object in a simple file?. @rgbk have not been able to reproduce. if it still occurs to you, please reopen this issue.. thanks @zethussuen!. @meaziz \nwe never tried that combination of plugins. will have a look. . doesn't work here neither \u2013 it seems the \"plugin\" command is broken (as I also didn't manage to run any other plugin). getting this error message:\n\n@lukasondrej do you have an idea?\n. we are aware of some issue with symbols and will fix as soon as we'll find the time.. @meaziz please see last comment in #104. there was this pull request by @eob about google sheets support \u2013 that would mean no \"detour\" via JSON export from the spreadsheet. I really think somebody should do a catch up there! ;-). Data Populator knows Conditional Actions. You define conditions (everything that works in JavaScript basically can be made working here) and if the condition renders TRUE, the defined actions is performed. Usually, those are Actions in Sketch \u2013 things like Show/Hide Layer or Run a Plugin Command. \nMaybe there could be a Conditional Action that, if the conditions is TRUE, just does specific data population based on that. So if e.g. Key 1 = X, populate Key 2. And I assume this should be a list of Keys \u2013 both for the condition as well as the action.. @lukasondrej might be an easy fix?. hey @classyentrepreneur @napathello, a fixed has been released (v2.3.5). Get the update via \"Plugins > Manage Plugins\u2026\" or here: https://github.com/preciousforever/data-populator/releases/tag/v2.3.5\nLet us know if it works for you and close the issue.. @dave-morris that\u2019s a great idea: using custom data substitutes from the json! why don\u2019t you add that feature and send us a PR? :-). @dave-morris it's now possible with the latest version for Sketch: https://www.datapopulator.com/sketch/changelog.html#v3-0-1\nPlease check it out and let us know if it works for you!. @defawlt what type of object/layer are you using with the {image} placeholder? can you add a screenshot?. @defawlt you need to use {image} as the name of an image mask (shape layer).. @defawlt happy to help. that\u2019s valuable feedback to hear, thanks for that \u2013 it\u2019s not yet obvious how to do it apparently :). @cat-martiancraft could you provide the sketch and JSON used?. @cat-martiancraft so your expectation would be that after populating, when switching the embedded symbol (via the override inspecator) from e.g. \"number 1\" to \"number 3\", that the value for {three} should be visible?. apparently not at the moment :-P\nbut there are another few issues with (nested) symbols we need to look into (e.g. #123 and #104). could you have a look, @lukasondrej?. @cat-martiancraft what you need is what's described in #94: there would be no {placeholder} inside the symbol, you would just put {one}, {two} and {three} in the overrides for the very same symbol.\nas commented over there, we're trying to get this running in the next version\u2026. please check out v3.0.3!\nhttps://www.datapopulator.com/sketch/changelog.html. @benjigreig please describe your issue in more detail and send over that demo file to feedback@datapopulator.com. @creativechris08 which version of sketch and data populator are you using?. @creativechris08 ok, so you need to use the {placeholder} in the layer name of the text layer, not the content of the override and it should work just fine!. @creativechris08 ok, we already had this feature request before. This would be helpful if you for example want a single symbol in which you always have e.g. an image, a H1, a H2 and a Description. but in Case 1 you want it to be a Contact, in Case 2 a Product and they don't share the same key names \u2013 so you need to put the {placeholders} in the overrides. Right now, you need to define a Symbol for \"Contact\" and one for \"Products\".\non the other hand, it's already possible to have the order in the JSON in the populated grid. because the {placeholder} would always be {name}, but it will populate the grid sequentially along the order in the JSON (if random is 'off'). or maybe i don't get your point.. #94 is the original feature request.. @creativechris08 see #94 \u2013 we're trying to get this running in the next version\u2026. @creativechris08 please check out v3.0.3!\nhttps://www.datapopulator.com/sketch/changelog.html. @JaccoSchumacher should work with v3.0.2 \u2013 please check it out and let us know!\nhttps://www.datapopulator.com/sketch/. @guymeyer i\u2019d say that\u2019s covered in #94 \u2013 please verify. @guymeyer your feedback is priceless :)\nso your problem rather is that although there are multiple actual instances of a symbol within a symbol, from data populator's perspective it's treated as a single instance (= the one from the parent symbol).\nthis is exactly the same if you just group multiple symbols and populate the group, not select all symbols one by one and populate.\nso I guess your issue is rather related to #115 \n@lukasondrej what's your thoughts?\n. please check out v3.0.3!\nhttps://www.datapopulator.com/sketch/changelog.html. @Happyperson there are no plans from our side \u2013 but it\u2019s open source, so feel free to add the capability!. @junaid2ali please give more context. what are you trying to achieve and what doesn\u2019t work?. @junaid2ali still don\u2019t get it. can you maybe record a video?. @bgott we\u2019d actually love to add numbers specific filters at some point \u2013 even some basic calculation would be great (see #113). would you be up helping here? :-). @tsheiner we\u2019ll have a look!. please see #97 . @Wiredframe do you want them to fit to both width and height and therefore distort imported images?. no plans for a figma version in the foreseeable future..

    "lukasondrej": "There is now a 'Presets' folder in the plugin bundle and nested folders are also supported. When selecting the presets on the new UI panel, nested presets are shown like 'folder/subfolder/my-preset'.\n. I think a reasonable solution could be to omit the placeholder if there is no value to populate it with unless a specific custom string is specified some syntax. \nFor example, {oldprice} could mean that if no value is present in the data, it would be omitted (replaced with empty string) but {oldprice ? n/a} would populate the placeholder with 'n/a' instead (string after the ?).\nI'm not sure about the '?' syntax but I think it'd be a great way to easily configure what happens to each placeholder with full control.\n. Personally I would go for the {company_name || self-employed} as @rockitbaby suggested but without the ' ' around the string since you could have ' in the string itself and then we'd need to escape it, etc. I suppose it's very unlikely that you'd have || in the string. What do you think?\n. This issue should be now be fixed in the 'development' branch. Please check it out.\n. So far, I haven't found any way to extract the font/text style from a substring inside a text layer. It'd be great if @bomberstudios could point us in the right direction.\n. The article points out a great way to set the style to a range so I'll see if I can get it to detect the initial style ranges too. Then it'll be possible to reapply the original style.\n. Done\n. Yes, for place image/svg it remembers the last folder. We can definitely\nadd it for selecting JSON too.\nOn 28 Jul 2015 16:03, \"Christophe Stoll\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@lukas77me https://github.com/lukas77me didn't we fix this for \"Place\nimage/SVG\"?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/preciousforever/sketch-data-populator/issues/22#issuecomment-125640623\n.\n. I just did some testing in 3.4 and it seems to be an issue with how the labels (on the alert) are created. I'll look into it.\n. The only solution that works in 3.4 beta I have found is to make the bold labels/titles on the UI regular thickness. The issue seems to be with setting the font for the labels (even just creating an instance of NSFont crashes which is very odd).\n. This works great, thanks a lot!\n. That's a great explanation! It may seem really strange but as far as I understand, what you are describing is the intended behaviour. Let me explain:\n\nThe reason this is happening is because Sketch Data Populator stores the original string in the text layer, e.g. \"Pencils, {var1}, and pens\" to the layer's metadata when you populate it. This is in order to be able to re-populate the text layer with new data. If it didn't store it in the metadata, the original string with the placeholders would be lost in the process of populating, hence it wouldn't be possible to re-populate the layer.\nIf you wish to change the original string, e.g. \"Pencils, {var1}, and pens\" to \"!!! Pencils! {var1}, and pens!!!\", you need to select the layer(s) and run the 'Restore Placeholders' command which is located next to the other Sketch Data Populator commands. This will put the original strings back and clear the metadata. At this point, you can edit the string and when you next populate, the changes should be taken into account.\nI hope that helps. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.\n. I agree that it'll make it more intuitive if you only have a single object\nin the JSON. I can take a look at this.\nOn 24 Nov 2015 8:55 am, \"Christophe Stoll\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nWhich example do you mean?\nOur JSON data usually consist of dozens or hundreds of objects and we\npreferred to put them in an array on the root level.\nWe could consider making it work without an array if there's only one\nobject \u2013 or even if there's a list of objects. It's a matter of taste\nprobably.

From the code, it looks like it should all be fine, I'll do some testing. The reason why I didn't merge 3.5 support into master yet is that it then won't be compatible with any lower version. But if that's ok, we can merge.\n. @alex-colbeck I've just fixed an issue with images when using urls. Please give it a go and let us know if it works for you. Thanks\n. Please try the version in the sketch-3.5-support branch with Sketch 3.5. It should hopefully work as expected. \n. Thanks for reporting this. Please try the version in the sketch-3.5-support branch which addresses these issues. It'd be much appreciated if you could let us know if it works for you.\n. Thanks for letting us know - this issue was caused by shape layers with image fill not getting populated. It should now be fixed, please check the latest commit in the new-symbols-support branch.\n. @nitrada I think with the previous versions of Sketch, it was done automatically but doesn't seem to be with the new symbols. It should be possible to automatically set the background as image when there's an image available, I'll investigate that.\n. I've tried reproducing this but with no luck. The doc where this happens would be very useful.\n. @r-ss-ll this should be fixed now, please check out the latest commit.\n. @nitrada in my testing, substitutes worked without any issues however I've found another issue with missing/invalid image URLs when populating symbols. This could be the cause of the crashes - fixed in the latest commit.\n. Populating image placeholders with URLs should work as expected now. It'd be great if you could give it a go using the latest commit and let us know if it works for you.\n. The issue should now be fixed. Let us know if it works for you.. Thanks, I'll take a look at that.\n. I've had some ideas about this too @russgoodman. I'd say a nice way to do it could also be just adding something like [2] or @[2] to the name of the layer/group you're populating to select the object at index 2 in the data array. What do you think about that?. Nested objects are now fully supported. You can also nest any number of objects, e.g. {top.nested.anotherNested.property}. Please try it out and let us know if it works for you.. That's great, thanks!. @guillaumechabot you're right, there seems to be a bug. I'll take a look at it soon.. Filters should now work as expected. There are a few things to keep in mind though:\n\n\n-l n can only be added to layer name, not within a placeholder written in a text layer\nfilters must be nested using () not {}, e.g. {(valOne | upper | max 4), valTwo | & \u2022 }\nif the text layer name contains a placeholder, it will override any placeholders contained in the text layer. @ColeTownsend to avoid the need for string comparison, please don't use quotes around boolean placeholders, e.g. if selected is a boolean value then {selected} == true is valid. \"{selected}\" == true is not valid because it renders to \"true\" == true for example. Hope this helps.. @Stompfrog as far as I know, it's not possible to load images over HTTP due to the App Transport Security restrictions which are enabled in Sketch. This means that Sketch only allows connections that are secure, e.g. over HTTPS. Unfortunately, it's not possible for us to overcome this issue at this point in time.. @ColeTownsend joins with dot syntax work as expected. The source of this issue was actually that the space between the pipe and the filter name was not allowed, e.g. {one,two | & \u2022 } didn't work but {one,two |& \u2022 } did. Now both work. Sorry for the confusion.. @nitrada there's no constraint that enforces 'id' in objects and personally I don't think there should be. We do have it in the sample data though.. @tdemooij please try the latest commit. Overrides that are not overwritten or cleared are kept, meaning that the example mentioned above now works as expected.. @seandellis overrides now work in 44.. We'll do more testing, thanks for the comments!. Really sorry for the inconvenience, the fix will be ready very soon (as part of the next release).. Hey @docmars, \n\ncould you verify the name of the text layer. I believe the issue is that your layer name contains {company?Freelance} and hence only the company is populated. \nIf the layer name contains placeholders, only the first one is considered and takes precedence over any placeholders in the text content of the layer.\nYou may wish to rename the text layer to not contain placeholders. \nHope that helps.. Hey @alirenttrack, I've looked into this issue in detail now and I understand what you'd like to achieve but there's a conceptual issue with it. Let me explain:\nWhen you check 'Create grid', Data Populator only considers the top-left artboard in your selection. It then creates the grid using that single artboard (or layer, group, etc).\nWhen multiple artboards are selected, all apart from the top-left are discarded as per the intended behaviour. The reason for this is that if you create a grid and then want to change the number of rows/cols or margins, you can simply repopulate again and a new grid will be created using the original single artboard.\nThis means that we'd need to change this behaviour to instead create a grid originating from each selected artboard/layer. That's something that needs further discussion.\nWhat do you think @nitrada, @rockitbaby, @dgwiasda?. There was a similar issue at some point before when Sketch got updated. It's most likely because of a changed internal structure of how symbol overrides are stored on symbols. I will investigate.. ",

    "bgohsman": "I believe I have figured out what I am doing wrong. Looking at only one demo, I assumed that SVGs were treated the same as any other image type and, as such, would use the same placeholder. However, looking through the code for populate(), I found that it looks for specific iconPlaceholders with the pattern {{*}}. Which tells me that I probably need double curly brackets on my placeholders for SVGs. I'll make that change later this afternoon and see how it goes.\n. Using the example from demo.sketch [the icon on a ListItem in the \"contacts\" example] definitely behaved differently, but Sketch still crashed. I could see the rows get generated. I could see the icon placeholders but the actual SVG icon did not load into them. The view appeared to zoom out, almost as if I'd hit Command + 1. And then Sketch crashed. For the moment, I'm just going to use PNG versions of the icons and generate SVG assets for development. \nIf it helps, I am running Sketch 3.6.1 (26313) on El Capitan 10.11.3.\n. That makes sense. For our purposes, it's working great just using PNG files. Then we export icons as SVG for the dev team. This has already saved hours as design iteration progresses. Being able to update a single object and then re-populate a layout [in my case, a table full of rows of data] has been a very good thing.\n. ",

I've just started playing around with this plugin so maybe I'm missing something or approaching this in the wrong way but I'm seeing a few issues with using it to populate data within symbols (and nested symbols).. @nitrada thanks for the quick response! Yes that does work however the symbols I'm trying to populate are broadly used and thus would not have the same {placeholder} data in every instance. \nSo detaching them and doing what you mentioned works, but then I lose out on updates to those common symbols.. @nitrada Sorry I think I should have mentioned these are overrides within nested symbols. Also, I meant they wouldn't necessarily be pulling from the same key within the JSON data. I can try to put together a demo if that would be helpful.\nRelated side note: Are there any good videos or tutorials you could point me towards that go through using this plugin for symbols and nested symbols? I was looking through the readme but couldn't find much on symbols except for the swapSymbol directive.. @nitrada sounds good, I'll...\n\ncheck out the demo.sketch file\ngive this some more thought and try the alternatives you mentioned\ncreate a new issue with more details and an example\n\nThanks again!. Awesome @nitrada and thanks to anyone else who helped push this forward!. @napathello you may want to see #94... long story short is yes via layer names/content but not via overrides. There's an example in the demo.sketch file.. ",
    "russgoodman": "I'm still getting a bit of a bug. When I populate my symbols the image doesn't appear. I have to manually set the master symbol rectangle to have a background image set to fill. Then when I populate my symbols in my design page the fill image in the symbol is replaced with the image from the JSON data. I really appreciate your work on this.\n. @nitrada But I have in the example above and it works. bottom left is a populated version of top left. If there is substitute content in the curly brackets it styles correctly. If there is not, it does not style correctly. It'd be great for both to work consistently like the version on the left.\n. The bottom left is the top left version once it has been populated. The word Goodman is in the same styling as Russ. The bottom right is the populated version of the top right. The word Mazza has not continued the styling of the word frank. Having substitute text in place is the difference. It seems that without substitute text only the first word of {name} gets the styling applied to the tag, and the rest of the text gets the styling used after the tag, which seems to be a bug to me. \n. @nitrada That was correct. Great work.\n. For sure. I'm making a part of an interface that has five videos players. There's an image, a title, the length of time per video, and I have 20 sets of video data in my JSON file. I'd like to be able to select a single video component, and be able to select which of the 20 sets of video data in my JSON file I would like to apply to this video component. Currently I would either need to have 20 JSON files, or produce 20 components then select the one that I wanted.\nIf there was a picker after selecting your JSON file, that'd be very good. If you want further explanation/clarification I'll be happy to expand further. I'm using this plugin a lot. We've even written a script that makes a Google Sheet output perfect JSON for the plugin so the rest of the team can contribute to the content in our designs.\n. @lukasondrej I think it would be preferable to decouple the specific data request from the vector. Because there are various sets of data in the json file I'd think I'd be more likely to be using symbols. Although I can see the Data Populator UI getting complex if you're populating repetitive pieces design components. I'm not sure where more difficulty lies here, from a development perspective.. ",
