    "edward": "Awesome :)\nLooking forward to seeing a new dashboard for DA\n. ",
    "pushmatrix": "The beauty of running on a free heroku instance :P.\nIt should be back up now.\n. @utkarsh2012 Not sure I understand the question. There is indeed a graph widget\n. Currently the graph widget only supports 1 timeseries. It's pretty easy to customize it to add more though.\nThere is also an iframe widget. Does Graphiti expose any embeddable charts?\n. Good call on having it not show up if the widgets don't move. It will be especially helpful for mobile devices where fat fingers tend to nudge the widgets.\nI'd prefer it if the 'Save Layout' dialog only shows up when the widgets are moved. Having it only pop up on the first nudge seems weird to me. People will discover the ability to drag since the default dashboard makes mention to that functionality. Also, as soon as people see that you can move a widget around, it won't take long before they start dragging it all over the place.\nWhat do you think of something like this:\ndashing.gridster.coffee\n``` coffeescript\nDashing.getWidgetPositions = ->\n  $(\".gridster ul:first\").gridster().data('gridster').serialize()\nDashing.showGridsterInstructions = ->\n  oldWidgetPositions = Dashing.currentWidgetPositions\n  Dashing.currentWidgetPositions = Dashing.getWidgetPositions()\nunless JSON.stringify(oldWidgetPositions) == JSON.stringify(Dashing.currentWidgetPositions)\n    $('#save-gridster').slideDown()\n    $('#gridster-code').text(\"\n      \\n\n      $(function() {\\n\n      \\ \\ Dashing.gridsterLayout('#{JSON.stringify(Dashing.currentWidgetPositions)}')\\n\n      });\\n\n      \n    \")\n```\nAnd then inside application.coffee, the last line of setImmediate could set the initial widget positions. There shouldn't be a race condition.\napplication.coffee\ncoffeescript\nBatman.setImmediate ->\n    $('.gridster').width(contentWidth)\n    $('.gridster ul:first').gridster\n      widget_margins: Dashing.widget_margins\n      widget_base_dimensions: Dashing.widget_base_dimensions\n      avoid_overlapped_widgets: !Dashing.customGridsterLayout\n      draggable:\n        stop: Dashing.showGridsterInstructions\n    Dashing.currentWidgetPositions = Dashing.getWidgetPositions()\n. What's unfortunate is that Gridster has a defective function for showing what widgets have changed: serialize_changed. It returns an array of all moved widgets....but it unfortunately also returns widgets that have only been nudged.\n. Hmmm. What if we update the current position of widgets at the start of the drag, and then compare that and the end of the drag? It unfortunately involves having to serializing the positions every time you start dragging, but the perf hit shouldn't be too bad, especially since the main functionality of the widgets is not to be constantly dragged around.\ndashing.gridster.coffee\n``` coffeescript\nDashing.showGridsterInstructions = ->\n  newWidgetPositions = Dashing.getWidgetPositions()\nunless JSON.stringify(newWidgetPositions) == JSON.stringify(Dashing.currentWidgetPositions)\n    Dashing.currentWidgetPositions = newWidgetPositions\n    $('#save-gridster').slideDown()\n    $('#gridster-code').text(\"\n      \\n\n      $(function() {\\n\n      \\ \\ Dashing.gridsterLayout('#{JSON.stringify(Dashing.currentWidgetPositions)}')\\n\n      });\\n\n      \n    \")\n```\napplication.coffee\ncoffeescript\nBatman.setImmediate ->\n    $('.gridster').width(contentWidth)\n    $('.gridster ul:first').gridster\n      widget_margins: Dashing.widget_margins\n      widget_base_dimensions: Dashing.widget_base_dimensions\n      avoid_overlapped_widgets: !Dashing.customGridsterLayout\n      draggable:\n        stop: Dashing.showGridsterInstructions\n        start: -> Dashing.currentWidgetPositions = Dashing.getWidgetPositions()\n. Looks good! Squash your code into a single commit, and I'll merge it in.\n. Should be up now.\n. This is a great idea. I can imagine a lot of rails projects benefiting from this.\n@cbeer looks like you're on the right track! I'll play around with this when I get some time.\n. I'll look into this.\n. The fix is on master. The issue is that the AnimatedNumber filter uses SetInterval to do the animation, but I did not specify the delay for it. Chrome interprets this as \"RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN\", but Firefox is a bit more of a stickler and decides not to run.\n. Yeah it is. I'll close this one.\n. One thing that would need to be taken care of is the fact that the ruby jobs get loaded & started with each instance of the app. That means that having 4 unicorn workers would spin up 4 job schedulers. The scheduler is very simple, and does not run off a queue, meaning that more schedulers will just duplicate jobs.\nIf you have an idea for getting around this, I'm all ears. However, I don't want to make the job DSL or setup more complicated. The beauty of Dashing is that you can start it up out of the box without needing to worry about much. If it means you now have to spin up a separate job server, then that would suck (unless its taken care of for you through a Procfile or something like that).\n. Awesome! Keep in mind too that everything should stay deployable to heroku.\nI've seen that heroku plays nicely with unicorn, so I guess it shouldn't be\na problem.\n. For option 2, you could create a lock file for the scheduler instead of for the jobs. That way, only one of the unicorn workers will have a scheduler running. \nAfter a bit of googling, turns out that this is a popular question for rufus-scheduler. Not sure if this article gives you any further insights.\n. Redis is good at locking, but then you also have to worry about running redis. I do agree that multiple instances is overkill though. The only use case would be if your dashboard is public facing and getting a ton of traffic.\n. Awesome! \n. Dashing uses Gridster.js for its layout, and as such is bound by the responsive capabilities of that library. In its original state, it does not support auto-resizing, but there has been much discussion about it over at https://github.com/ducksboard/gridster.js/issues/5.\nThere is one way to configure Gridster such that it will attempt to auto-layout the widgets based on the screen dimensions. The drawback is that the layout is only applied to the initial size of the window; if you resize, nothing will happen. To get this to work, go inside your application.coffee file and remove the line\nDashing.numColumns ||= 4\nAlso make sure that you don't have any custom Dashing.gridsterLayout() config at the top of your dashboard's erb file.\nDashing's original use case was to display dashboards on 1080p tvs in a deterministic fashion. Libraries like Masonry.js were tried at first, but the issue was the widgets wouldn't necessarily render in the same spot, or in visually appealing layouts.\nAlthough responsive wasn't the initial goal, I'd love to see something that makes this possible for Dashing. Any suggestions are welcome.\n. Not sure why this would be happening. For my own dashboards, I'm running OSX Lion with ruby 1.9.3-p194 without problems, and I'm loading in tons of libraries and jobs.\nMight sound silly, but are you loading any libraries inside of adder.rb, or are you doing anything computationally expensive? If adder.rb is empty, does it still do the same?\n. The lib directory is not meant to run code, but rather to supply helper methods & classes for your jobs. If you have any executable code in there, it will run as soon as Dashing starts. Since you're calling sleep 1000 times, that would explain the slow load.\nPlacing adder.rb in your root folder won't cause a problem because the file won't be loaded/run. The only autoload paths are in jobs & lib.\nIf you want to do something every 0.2 seconds, your best bet is to use jobs. Each job is threaded, so you can do more expensive stuff in there.\njobs/adder.rb\nruby\nSCHEDULER.every '0.2s', :first_in => 0 do\n  system `echo \"#{rand(10..100)};#{rand(10..100)};#{rand(10..100)};#{rand(10..100)};#{rand(10..100)};#{Time.now}\" >> C:/Users/winmais/code/anas_dashboard/fake_data`\nend\n. Good call. I was requesting a feature like this over on #7.\nHere's where the awesomeness that is Server Sent Events comes in. You can actually specify event names, which will act like channels. You can thus have a channel for all widget related messages, and a channel for all dashboard related ones. If you don't specify an event name, it defaults to the 'messages' channel.\nYou specify event names by formatting the SSE like:\nruby\ndata: {\"msg\": \"My message\"}\\n\\n\nevent: widget_update\\n\nThen in js land, you would attach an event listener to that event:\ncoffeescript\nsource.addEventListener 'widget_update', (e) =>\n  ...\nThis way there wouldn't need to be any parsing of the data id. SSEs are so cool. Here's an awesome article about them: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/eventsource/basics/\n. Any interest in changing the implementation to use the event field I mentioned above? If not, I can modify this PR. I think it's a cleaner approach.\n. Awesome!\nNo pressure though. I was just wondering what the status was on this.\n. By restart, you mean just refresh the page right?\n. It's definitely something that's been on my mind, and something that will be needed. I'm still trying to decide on the best way to host the widgets. \nThe two options I see so far:\n1) A single repository where people submit pull requests for their widgets.\n2) A wiki page that contains links to people's widgets. The widgets would be hosted by the maintainers, and could be stored in gists or could be in their own repos.\nI'm leaning towards the second option. It would be easier for people to update their widgets without having to issue pull requests for every change. I sometimes feel bad for the guys over on the Homebrew repo, who have to be merging in tons and tons of requests all the time.\n. I don't see how it'd be harder than having a git repo filled with widget\ndirectories. If anything, the wiki would provide a field for people to add\na description, which would provide more context if you're doing a page\nsearch.\nOn Mon, Nov 5, 2012 at 11:40 PM, SeanJA notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nA public wiki might get a lot long and be hard to search though...\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/Shopify/dashing/issues/14#issuecomment-10099022.\n. Apologies for the delay in adding this.\n\nI've added the wiki with a sample widget, and instructions on how to contribute: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki/Additional-Widgets \n. Just use simple http/Ajax calls. I really don't see the need to overcomplicate things with web sockets.\n. Are the communicating widgets on the same dashboard, or is this across dashboards? More importantly, when you pick a state on the map, does it need to sync with the graph widget of every open instance of the dashboard, or is the change only local?\nIf changes are local, then it's really simple to achieve: You can observe the state variable in your Map widget.\nPut the following in the ready: -> block of your graph widget.\ncoffeescript\nDashing.widgets.map_widget_name[0].observe('state', updateFunction)\nNow make sure that when you pick a state, it calls set to set the state variable. Ex: set('state', 'Texas'). This will trigger the observer that your graph widget setup, and will end up calling the updateFunction. \nLet me know if that works for you.\n. What browser are you on?\n. Can you try the latest master? I believe I fixed this issue with 837cf50007ef8cbd7ec017d4e8cb67adc5725568. Let me know if it now works on Firefox.\n. Do you mean set a default dashboard?\n. You'll want to make sure you only ever have 1 instance of Dashing running at a time. If you have more than one, there will be multiple job schedulers, which will cause duplicated jobs to fire. Is there a way to limit it in passenger?\n. This article seems to suggest a similar problem with a different gem: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12130162/cucumber-fails-with-json-encodinginvalidbytesequenceerror\nLet me know if that export they suggest works for you.\n. Dashing only works on ruby 1.9.\n. Thanks. It's back up now.\n. Let's create that custom widget wiki this week.\n. Hey,\nGood catch. I mistakenly added a ? to the end of the redirect line. I fixed the wiki with an example that should work.\n. I will be adding a wiki page shortly. Rather than add all of these custom widgets into the repo, they will be added to the wiki along with any supporting instructions on how to use them.\n. Points takes an array of hashes containing x,y. Check out how the sample dashboard job is doing it:\nhttps://github.com/Shopify/dashing/blob/master/templates/project/jobs/convergence.rb\n. Closed by 5934a2729d.\n. In the json you're sending, are you passing in value: or text:? Meter widgets take the former as input.\n. I should document the widget's APIs better. Number takes in a current value, and an optional last value (to show a % change). Don't be afraid to open the widget html files to see what it expects under the hood :P\n. Discussion started on https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/issues/5\nI'm not sure where @cbeer is with his branch, but he had a work in progress for mounting dashing into rails.\n. Are there any errors in the console? What browsers are you on?\n. I have not been able to reproduce this issue. However, some googling of the error message seems to suggest it could be interference from a Chrome extension. Try disabling all your extensions, and see if it still freezes.\n@florian-bayer: We tried using MK802s for our dashboards at Shopify, but those things ended up being crap. They would overheat all the time, and would boot only half the time.\n. Two more questions: \n- What type of server are you running Dashing on?\n- Does this dashboard (http://dashingdemo.herokuapp.com/sample) freeze for you? Or is it only your own custom one.\n. @dieterdemeyer Are you also only using the API, or are you using jobs to push data to the widgets?\n. Ok I have an idea, go inside your number.coffee, and remove this line:\n@accessor 'current', Dashing.AnimatedValue\nThen tell me if it's still freezing up. I'm wondering if it's an issue with the number animation...\n. No, leave that one as is. Then we'll see if that's the one that jams up.\n. How long till it freezes?\n. @dieterdemeyer: This is still an issue for your right? Only on firefox?\n. I'm going to look into this more this week.\n. An ugly workaround for now would be a good ol' meta refresh\n<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"3600\">\n. @mpavlov How long do you have it running before it craps out? \nAlso, are you running the server on that same laptop, or on a diff server?\n. @sikosis There's a possibility that the scss changes over time. As long as your dashing project is in source control, you'll be able to see what has changed when you copy the new files over, and pick the parts that you want to keep.\n@mcookDaxko: You don't have to do anything for sass to compile. What type of change are you making?\n. It's a totally valid use case, and would make for a good extension. If you can figure out how to make it as a gem, that'd be ideal.\n. I wish it were as simple as just putting an href tag. What I've done in the past is put something like this at the top of my dashboard's .erb file:\n<script type='text/javascript'>\n$(function() {\n  $('li').live('click', function(e){\n    var widget = $(this).find('.widget');\n    var url = widget.data('url');\n    window.location = url;\n  });\n});\n</script>\nThen in my widget I can set the data-url attribute to my link.\n<li data-row=\"1\" data-col=\"1\" data-sizex=\"1\" data-sizey=\"1\">\n  <div data-id=\"karma\" data-url=\"http://www.shopify.com\"></div>\n</li>\nDashing wasn't originally designed for interactive widgets, so this area could definitely be improved. If you find a better way, please let me know.\n. IE doesn't support server sent events, which is the core mechanism behind Dashing. IE 10 might support it if that's a possibility for you. \n. Does the following work?\nexport LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8\nexport LANG=en_US.UTF-8\ngem install dashing\nI forgot to specify utf-8 encoding in the gemspec for Dashing. I'm pushing that to master now. \n. Did this work?\n. Awesome.\n. Just added this to the wiki. Let me know if it works for you.\nhttps://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki/How-to:-Add-authentication#wiki-httpbasic\n. Yep, it's totally possible!\nIn fact, the graph widget currently uses Rickshaw.js, which is a nice library built on top of D3.js\nTake a look at the code over here: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/tree/master/templates/project/widgets/graph\n. The sample job that feeds that widget is over here: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/blob/master/templates/project/jobs/convergence.rb\n. It's an indentation issue. If you notice, the lines after ready: -> are not indented, meaning that they are going to be run immediately as the file is required, instead of when the widget is ready.\nHere is your function with fixed indentation:\n``` coffeescript\n  ready: ->\n    @chart = new Highcharts.Chart\n      chart:\n        renderTo: \"HCcontainer\"\n        type: \"line\"\n  series: [\n    name: \"Tokyo\"\n    data: [7.0, 6.9, 9.5, 14.5, 18.2, 21.5, 25.2, 26.5, 23.3, 18.3, 13.9, 9.6]\n  ,\n    name: \"New York\"\n    data: [-0.2, 0.8, 5.7, 11.3, 17.0, 22.0, 24.8, 24.1, 20.1, 14.1, 8.6, 2.5]\n  ]\n\n``\n. Nice! Thanks for that.\n. Are you trying to deploy the default dashboard that comes with Dashing? That one should work by following the instructions here: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki/How-to%3A-Deploy-to-Heroku\n. You can tryheroku ps:scale web=1to make sure you have a web process running, but you shouldn't have to do that.\n. Ah, I see. You'll need to run your dashing project at least once before pushing to heroku. Or you can justbundle installbefore you commit the files. I've added that to the wiki. Let me know if that works for you. \n. Didheroku ps:scale web=1do anything?\n. I'll assume this is fixed. Let me know if it isn't, and I'll re-open the issue.\n. This will be solved when #48 is pulled in.\n. In the case of sorting, it gets a bit trickier. Even if you re-order the array of data coming in for a list, the DOM will not reflect the changes. This is because Batman.js only re-orders lists if the data is aBatman.Set, and not just a regularArray`.\nIn your list.coffee, try adding the following:\ncoffeescript\nclass Dashing.List extends Dashing.Widget\n  onData: (data) ->\n    sortedItems = new Batman.Set\n    sortedItems.add.apply(sortedItems, data.items)\n    @set 'items', sortedItems\nThis essentially just converts the incoming list data into a Batman Set. It looks kinda ugly, but it works.\nThen in your view, you can sort the list of items with something like:\n<ul class=\"list-nostyle\">\n  <li data-foreach-item=\"items.sortedBy.timestamp\">\n    <span class=\"label\" data-bind=\"item.timestamp\"></span>\n    <span class=\"value\" data-bind=\"item.value\"></span>\n  </li>\n</ul>\nNotice how the keypath for data-foreach-item now includes the key that the list should be sorted on. This assumes that the data you pass in has a timestamp field.\nLet me know if that works for you.\n. Yeah, I like the flexibility of @crcastle's approach. @davefp, can you incorporate that into your PR?\n. Do you know if there's a way to make respond_with render an error message if the dashboard file is not found? As it stands right now, if it can't find the file, it just renders a white screen. \nIdeally we can show a message to the user, similar to what erb does when it can't find the file:\n\nI like the addition of respond_with. Now anyone can use whatever rendering engine they want. However, instead of including 'haml' as a dependency, I'd prefer adding an article to the wiki explaining the steps to include/use it.\n. When someone loads the dashboard in their browser, all widgets will automatically receive the last values that the job server fetched -- you shouldn't need to tell the job to re-run. Your widget should receive the daily value.\nIs this behaviour not showing for you?\n. It won't be available in the ready event. However, if the job has already run, then the  onData callback inside your widget will be called as soon as the page loads (but only after the ready event is triggered). Can you initialize the chart within ready, but update its data within onData? Perhaps I'm not fully understanding the issue.\n. There was mention to an error 13 happening over here: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/issues/42\nWe were able to get highcharts running in there.\n. Hey Kevin,\nI also haven't done much CLI testing before, but this looks to be pretty good! I just merged it in.\nThanks a lot for starting this. I intend on contributing to the tests as well.\n. I'm starting to think that having to write x,y for each point is overly verbose. I'm digging the two element array...\n. Rickshaw is smart in the sense that if you give it time series data, it will try to figure out the best intervals to use to display the graph. So if you give timestamps that span years, it will probably only show axis labels on each year. If you put in months, it will probably only do months.\nIn the case of the convergence demo, the difference from one point to another is so small that it assumes it's in seconds. Is it possible for you to pass in your timeseries data as an epoch time integer? I believe that's the time format it likes.\n. Try passing in the x values as integers instead of as strings. \n. As far as I know, Rickshaw determines the best timescale for you.  If your dates span multiple months, you should see months appear.\nI'm not an expert on Rickshaw, so your guess is as good as mine for a lot of these issues. However, I think you can specify custom time units like so:\ncoffeescript\nx_axis = new Rickshaw.Graph.Axis.Time(\n      graph: @graph\n      timeUnit:\n        name: 'minutes'\n        seconds: 60\n        formatter: (d) ->  d.getUTCMinutes()\n    )\nSo all timeunits take a seconds parameter. So hours would be 3600, days 86400, and so on. I believe this will create an axis marker for every unit you specified. As for what gets displayed, the formatter parameter determines that. In the example above, every 60 seconds on the graph will have the minutes printed out on it using d.getUTCMinutes().\nBe careful though. If your data points span over multiple days, and you specify seconds:1, you're gonna have a bad time. It's gonna draw thousands and thousands of labels.\n. I'm not sure I really understand the issue. Are you saying that your dashboard runs for a certain amount, and then at one point stops responding to CURL?\nWhen you restart the dashing server, does it start working again? Then does it eventually stop working?\n. I'm assuming you're still having this issue?\n. Yeah you can, it's in the gh-pages fork. I'll just make the change though. Thanks for the tip!\n. 1) \nSynergy (Meter widget)\ncurl -d '{ \"auth_token\": \"YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN\", \"value\": 50 }' \\http://localhost:3030/widgets/synergy\nBuzzwords (List widget)\ncurl -d '{ \"auth_token\":\"YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN\", \"items\": [{\"label\": \"item1\", \"value\": \"Test1\"}, {\"label\": \"item2\", \"value\": \"Test2\"}] }' http://localhost:3030/widgets/buzzwords\nValuation (Number widget)\ncurl -d '{ \"auth_token\": \"YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN\", \"current\": 50 }' \\http://localhost:3030/widgets/valuation\nThe reason why it's current instead of value, is because you can also specify a last value, and the widget will show the % difference.\nConvergence (Graph widget)\ncurl -d '{ \"auth_token\": \"YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN\", \"points\": [{ \"x\":1356733421, \"y\": 20 }, { \"x\":1357338234, \"y\": 50 }, { \"x\":1357942985, \"y\": 10 }] }' \\http://localhost:3030/widgets/convergence\n2) When you create a new a new dashing project, it comes with the sampletv dashboard, and that shows the implementation of twitter and the clock.\n. I updated the answer in https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/issues/56 to contain a CURL for buzzwords\n. Although I really love the idea, I'm closing this for now for two reasons:\nThe main one is for simplicity. Rather than making people create new gems for sharing their widgets, it'd be simpler if they could just paste a link to the files on the wiki. I will create a page so that people can put a description of their widget, as well as a screenshot/demo of it. Each widget would have a link thats leads to either a github repo, or even better, a gist of the required files. Copy & paste the widgets you want, and there's no complicated magic going on.\nSecondly, I'd like to eventually decouple the frontend from ruby. I've seen someone implement the Dashing backend in Perl, and another in Python. It seems like people want to port the frontend to different technologies. If widgets are inside ruby gems, it'll be trickier to do that.\n. Your renderer: 'bar' shouldn't be nested within series, but within the main options list:\ncoffeescript\n@graph = new Rickshaw.Graph(\n  element: @node\n  width: width\n  height: height\n  renderer: 'bar'\n  ...\n. First thing's first, you're going to need to specify an id on that div. This is because the api needs to know which widget you want to send the data to.\nhtml\n<div data-id=\"myiframe\" data-view=\"Iframe\"></div>\nOnce that's done, you can do:\ncurl -d '{\"auth_token\": \"YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN\", \"url\": \"http://yoursite.com\" }' \\http://localhost:3030/widgets/myiframe\n. Oops, my bad. I put a \"iframe\" instead of \"Iframe\" as the data-view. I fixed what I wrote above.\n. Also, try without the set :protection config. It might still work. I might have been wrong about the frame options thing.\n. Most likely related to https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/issues/64\nIf you have rack 1.4.3 in your Gemfile.lock, it's not going to work. I'm working a fix for it now.\n. @ckelner: You shouldn't have to include rack in the gemfile. Just Dashing 1.0.2 should do.\nMake sure you do bundle update rack so that it fetches the right rack.\n. Hey guys,\nI recently added a public directory to dashing, where you can put custom 404 pages, and stuff like that. 6dcda5d7cd26514cac1b18438af7913105e68f00\nIt also rescues from 404's, like in your PR.\nA fun fact that I just discovered: Symbols in ruby are never garbage collected. Therefore if people keep getting 404's, then  erb params[:dashboard].to_sym will create a new symbol every time. Do that enough times with random URLs, and you got yourself a pretty little DOS attack.\n. Hey, this seems to be an issue with the recent update of rack to 1.4.2. I'm investigating now.\nTemporary fix is to add this to your gemfile:\ngem 'rack', '1.4.1'\nLet me know if that works for you.\n. It's now fixed on master & in gem release 1.0.2.\nIt's an issue with Sinatra using Rack 1.4.2+ https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/issues/606\nSinatra gem should be bumped soon...\n. It actually has something to do with any widget that has a background icon image. I'm working on a fix.\n. Are you talking about the issue where it is 1 pixel off? Can you try it in firefox & a webkit browser, and tell me if you get the same results? I think it's a webkit bug...\n. Oh I see. You're using custom dimensions. I was just looking at the defaults on http://dashingdemo.herokuapp.com\nYou should be able to adjust the font size. Slap something like this in your clock.scss:\ncss\nh2 {\n    font-size: 25px !important;\n  }\nThe !important property will make sure that this is the one that's used, and not the h2 that is defined globally. Play around with that font size until you get the results you want. Let me know if it works for you.\n. Rather than include new widgets inside dashing, I've added a wiki where people can link to their own.\nhttps://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki/Additional-Widgets\n. I don't think there is one in Batman. In the example you show, just use a regular js slice. Coffeescript version:\n data.items = data.items[0..15]\n. Oh right. That shouldn't work then. It will sort the smaller list, but it might have chopped off things past 15 that actually belonged in there.\nDoes something like this work?\nAdd this to your list.coffee\ncoffeescript\n@accessor 'sortedItems', =>\n  @get('items.sortedByDescending.value.toArray')[0..15]\nAnd change this in your html:\n<li data-foreach-item=\"sortedItems\">\n. Yep, you can. If the value doesn't exist, it will just return undefined. No exceptions will be thrown. However, you should check to see if the value exists before you do the slice. A little coffeescript magic:\ncoffeescript\n@accessor 'sortedItems', =>\n  @get('items.sortedByDescending.value.toArray')?[0..15]\nThe question mark there will make sure it's defined before doing the slice\n. It's normal that it's an array, but it should be an array of objects. foreach will loop over the array, and for each item it will grab the label and value associated to it.\nThe issue is actually my mistake. You don't need the fat arrow in the accessor. Modify it to look like:\ncoffeescript\n@accessor 'sortedItems', ->\n  @get('items.sortedByDescending.value.toArray')?[0..15]\n. Dashing runs on Thin(http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/). Any documentation you can find on autostarting Thin should work.\nAs @promisedlandt said, look into an Upstart script: http://www.treeder.com/2012/03/upstarting-thin-aka-using-upstart-to.html\n. Where are you sending the data from? Curl?\n. ping.\n. Good find! \nTo keep things consistent with Dashing, I suggest we keep the hyphens in the classname. Let's make the fix to the SCSS file generator.\n. ping. Any update on this?\n. Hey @banafederico, \nYour change was hyphenating (dashizing) everything. In this case, we only want to dashize the name in the css file. I've tweaked your PR to reflect this, and I also added some tests.\n. Hey Martyn,\nIt's actually pretty easy to do it. I think @davefp was thinking you were using a number widget, but I think you're talking about the meter widget right?\nThe meter widget uses the jquery-Knob library (http://anthonyterrien.com/knob/)\nAccording to the docs, you need to fire a trigger event with the fgColor set. You can change your meter.coffee code to something like this:\ncoffeescript\n  constructor: ->\n    super\n    @observe 'value', (value) ->\n      meter = $(@node).find(\".meter\")\n      if value > 90\n        color = \"#00FF00\"\n      else if value > 80\n        color = \"#FFFF00\"\n      else if value > 70\n        color = \"#FF9900\"\n      else\n        color = \"#FF0000\"\n      meter.val(value).trigger('configure', fgColor: color)\n      meter.val(value).trigger('change')\nThat should work.\n. Just have a database on the server that Dashing is running on. Since Dashing is based off of Sinatra, pretty much any stuff you find about Sinatra can be used with it.\nTake a look at this ruby gem (https://github.com/janko-m/sinatra-activerecord) that shows how to add activerecord to Sinatra. Note that all the stuff they mention will go in your config.ru file.\n. I'm not sure what you mean. Is this using the image widget?\n. Inside your dashboard .erb file, put this at the top:\njavascript\n<script type='text/javascript'>\n$(function() {\n  $('li').live('click', function(e){\n    var widget = $(this).find('.widget');\n    var url = widget.data('link');\n    if (url) window.location = url;\n  });\n});\n</script>\nThen when you use an image widget, add a data-link attribute:\nhtml\n<li data-row=\"1\" data-col=\"1\" data-sizex=\"1\" data-sizey=\"1\">\n  <div data-view=\"Image\" data-image=\"/logo.png\" data-link='abc'></div>\n</li>\n. This should help\nhttps://github.com/maxstauss/dashing_active_record/pull/1\n. Something like http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJMRKB3RU_s ? Hehe\nSo your first step is to figure out how to monitor the updates to the file:\n\nAssuming you have a setup where the spreadsheet you are working on is on a different machine than the server Dashing is running on, you could use write a small ruby program that uses something like rb-kqueue to monitor when the file changes-- assuming you're on OS X. Whenever your file changes, you just use the roo gem that @toddedw mentioned, and then push the data to your dashboard using the Dashing api. Done.\n\nAssuming you have a setup where the spreadsheet you are working on is on the same pc as the Dashing server, you could do something prettttty cool. Since the Thin webserver uses EventMachine, it has access to something called FileWatch. If you're on OS X, EM will use kqueue to monitor file changes. If you're on linux, it uses inotify. If you're on Windows...I have no idea. Anyway!\nIn your jobs directory, replace the sample.rb with:\nsample.rb\n``` ruby\nrequire 'roo'\nEM.kqueue = EM.kqueue?\nfile_path = \"#{Dir.pwd}/spreadsheet.xls\"\ndef fetch_spreadsheet_data(path)\n  s = Roo::Excel.new(path)\n  send_event('valuation',   { current: s.cell(1, 2) })\nend\nmodule Handler\n  def file_modified\n    fetch_spreadsheet_data(path)\n  end\nend\nfetch_spreadsheet_data(file_path)\nEM.next_tick do\n  EM.watch_file(file_path, Handler)\nend\n```\nFor this to work, make sure that:\n- You include roo in your Gemfile.\n- You have a spreadsheet in the root directory called spreadsheet.xls. The data it is fetching is in cell (1, 2)\n- You have a Number widget called 'valuation'. The Sample dashboard has it.\nLet me know how that goes for you. Hope this helps!\nAs a side note, I guess you could do something fancier with ODBC straight to the excel file, but I'll leave that as an exercise to the reader :P\n. And roo also supports Google spreadsheets, which is pretty awesome. \n. @rickleigh Good to hear you figured it out. I don't have a linux box handy, so couldn't test.\n. Hmm, it's working on my end. Are there any js errors?\n. It works with coffee-script-source 1.6.2. I'm going to bump it to that.\n. Merged.\n. See #42\n. All you want is just a job that imports data, and then uses the list widget.\nHere's a quick sample of what you could do. In this case, the order is preserved.\n``` ruby\nfields = %w(revenue orders customers)\nSCHEDULER.every '10s' do\n  items = []\n  fields.each do |field|\n    value = ActiveRecord::Base.execute(sql)\n    items << { label: field, value: value }\n  end\nsend_event('buzzwords', { items: items })\nend\n```\nThe reason why the buzzwords example is not alphabetical is because the list is populated at random. Every time the job runs, it picks a random buzzword and adds +1 to it. These counts are stored in a hash, and will not be sorted alphabetically, regardless of the buzzwords array.\nLet me know if that works for you.\n. A common thing we do at Shopify is use some fancy metaprogramming to fetch fields we want. For example:\n``` ruby\nfields = %w(revenue orders customers)\nSCHEDULER.every '10s' do\n  items = []\n  fields.each do |field|\n    value = send(\"fetch_#{field}\")\n    items << { label: field, value: value }\n  end\nsend_event('buzzwords', { items: items })\nend\ndef fetch_revenue\n  # code that fetches & returns the revenue\nend\ndef fetch_orders\n  # code that fetches & returns the orders\nend\ndef fetch_customers\n  # code that fetches & returns the customers\nend\n```\n. How about something like this:\n``` ruby\nrequire 'net/http'\nrequire 'json'\nDefault value is set to '0'\ncurrent = Hash.new(0)\nlast = Hash.new(0)\nSCHEDULER.every '1m', :first_in => 0 do |job|  \n  %w(licensecount revenue customercount).each do |type|\n    last[type] = current[type]\nhttp = Net::HTTP.new('10.20.10.55',8080)\nresponse = http.request(Net::HTTP::Get.new(\"/#{type}.php\"))\nresults = JSON.parse(response.body)[0]\nif(results)\n  current[type] = results[\"Agents\"]\n  send_event(type, { value: current[type] })\nend\n\nend\nend\n```\nProtip: If you want to do a codeblock, wrap your code in backticks:\nruby\nbla bla bla code\n. Good idea! I just merged it in. https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/commit/4247f127bd88cd5d09f3778e07daf2a5d9c5de88\nI made it a bit shorter, and added some error handling in the case that the gist isn't found.\n. That Replicator thing looks amazing! I'm looking forward to seeing the project.\nYou should be able to package up a Dashing project. Just run bundle install, and then bundle dashing start, and it should work fine.\nI'm assuming you want to include all the files within your Dashing project right?\nI'm not sure what you mean by copying files not working without the dashing command.\n. Oooooo weee. It does take a pretty long time. Thanks for the PR! I just merged it in.\n. IE is not supported since it doesn't support Server Sent Events. :(\n. You can also write jobs in any language you want, and use the API to send\nyour data over.\nOn 2013-03-27, at 16:53, David Underwood notifications@github.com wrote:\nNot with the current implementation. However, there are versions of Dashing\ncurrently being written in Python, .NET, and a couple of other languages.\nThat said, the amount of ruby actually required to write a job is minimal.\nIf you're familiar with another scripting language, getting up and running\nwith Dashing should be straightforward.\nOn 27 March 2013 11:46, Micah Fitzgerald notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nIs it possible to write jobs in other languages (Python, Java,\nJavascript)?

You can easily add your own database layer. Here's an example of using Dashing with ActiveRecord: https://github.com/maxstauss/dashing_active_record/issues/1\n. Ah that makes sense because using Dir doesn't guarantee order across OSes\nWill add the sort.\n. I pushed a fix to lock it to 1.6.2 and higher. Seems like that version is stable.\n. Merged.\n. I avoided adding the twitter gem because I don't want to add dependencies that people won't necessarily need.\nWhat are your thoughts on this?\nEdit: I skipped over some of the discussion. Ignore my comment.\n. After speaking with devs, it seems like the twitter widget is a popular one and is often included on dashboards. \nI really didn't want to have to add a dependency to twitter, but I caved :P\nI did it in a way that is easy to remove. It's not part of the Dashing gemspec, but rather part of the gemfile of your project.\nAlso, I put a link inside the job on where to get your API keys. \nI also made it fail gracefully, so if you start a new dashing instance that does not have the API keys set, it shows a helpful message instead of throwing a big ugly exception:\n\nLet me know what you think.\nhttps://github.com/Shopify/dashing/commit/f91c1b8962860eaeaa428d3ea75ebf61ced9ec6a\n. Because some people were also asking to change the format of the clock, I think the most flexible way is to simply redefine the updatedAtMessage function. \nFor example, put this in your application.coffee:\nDashing.Widget::accessor 'updatedAtMessage', ->\n    if updatedAt = @get('updatedAt')\n      timestamp = new Date(updatedAt * 1000)\n      hours = timestamp.getHours()\n      minutes = (\"0\" + timestamp.getMinutes()).slice(-2)\n      \"Fresh as of #{hours}:#{minutes}\"\nSince this is the only actual text snippet provided in the app, I'd prefer to not add it as a config option/i18n\n. I agree entirely & am on this.\n. Merged.\n. If this is a popular request, it will be added to Dashing 2.0.\nIn the meantime, here is a quick hack around it:\nThe following code assumes a new instance of Dashing. It will make it so that the buzzwords list keeps getting rows added to it.\njobs/buzzwords.rb\n``` ruby\nbuzzwords = ['Paradigm shift', 'Leverage', 'Pivoting', 'Turn-key', 'Streamlininess', 'Exit strategy', 'Synergy', 'Enterprise', 'Web 2.0'] \n@buzzword_list = []\ndef send_delta_event(id, body)\n  body[:id] = id\n  body[:updatedAt] ||= Time.now.to_i\n  send_event(id, body)\n  body[:items] = @buzzword_list\n  Sinatra::Application.settings.history[id] = format_event(body.to_json)\nend\nSCHEDULER.every '2s' do\n  new_item = { label: buzzwords.sample, value: rand(5) }\n  send_delta_event('buzzwords', { item: new_item })\n  @buzzword_list.unshift new_item\nend\n```\nThe key thing here is that we are maintaining the 'master' list of all buzzwords. However, we are only sending one item/buzzword at a time each time the job runs. The 'master' list is used so that when you refresh the browser, you get all the previous buzzwords that were added to the list.\nwidgets/list/list.coffee:\n``` coffeescript\nclass Dashing.List extends Dashing.Widget\n  ready: ->\n    if @get('unordered')\n      $(@node).find('ol').remove()\n    else\n      $(@node).find('ul').remove()\nonData: (data) ->\n    console.log(\"GOT DATA!\", data)\n    items = [data.item]\n    for item in @get('items')\n      items.push(item)\n    @set('items', items)\n```\nHere you can see that the onData method knows how to handle the single items coming in, and adds them to the list.\n. Not sure what to say. I tested it out on Windows 8 with Firefox & Chrome, and they are both working for me. Hmmm...\n. \"A++++~~~~~~~++++~~~~~ would ask to test again\"\nYou are my hero! Excellent work, and thanks for contributing! It was just merged in.\n. My bad. I meant the list widget.\n. Are you on Ubuntu? \nThis stack overflow article suggests a solution to a similar problem when installing rails: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11058952/why-do-i-get-an-error-installing-the-json-gem-in-ubuntu\n. The erb will have access to any global variables set on Sinatra::Application. It's a bit of a hack:\nconfig.ru\n``` ruby\nget your clients\nSinatra::Application::CLIENTS = [..........]\n```\nThen in your template\nerb\n<% CLIENTS.each do |client| %>\n  .....\n<% end %>\n. The reason it's not straightforward is because the dashboard rendering does not assume any variables are being passed in. Ideally with erb, you can specify erb :dashboard_name,  :locals => {:clients => [1,2,3]}.\nIf you'd prefer, you can edit the dashing.rb file to allow passing these variables in.\n. Closing this because https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/issues/127#issuecomment-18401056 addresses OPs question.\n@scubes13 & @lagsalot: Those are slightly different than the original question, and will require some rewiring of how dashing works. \nQuick suggestion:\nRight now Dashing maintains an array of all connected users, and then sends all the data out to it. You could change it so that your jobs loop through each connected client, runs the job appropriate to their client id, and then send_event only for them. This goes beyond the scope of Dashing, and would be suited well suited in a fork. Discussing this further would best be done in a new issue :)\n. In your config.ru file, add the line set :default_dashboard, 'about_us.html'\nex: \nruby\nconfigure do\n  set :auth_token, 'YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN'\n  set :default_dashboard, 'about_us.html'\nend\nThen in your public directory, add a file called about_us.html. Should work.\n. How about:\njavascript\nif( /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPad|iPod|BlackBerry/i.test(navigator.userAgent) ) {\n  $(\".gridster ul:first\").gridster().data('gridster').draggable().disable();\n}\n. You can do something like this in your config.ru (within the configure do section):\nruby\n  get '/' do\n    protected!\n    file = File.join(settings.views, \"sample.erb\")\n    render(:erb, file)\n  end\n  # Sinatra doesn't support overriding routes. The routes are evaluated first come first serve.\n  # In this case, we want our route for '/' to come first, so we put it at the front of the routes array. hacky? yeah\n  Sinatra::Application.routes[\"GET\"].unshift(Sinatra::Application.routes[\"GET\"].pop)\n. What happens to this on windows? We should probably use the more generic Tempfile that ruby has (http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/tempfile/rdoc/Tempfile.html)\n. Take a look here: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/blob/master/javascripts/dashing.coffee#L16\n. This has been fixed with https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/commit/f91c1b8962860eaeaa428d3ea75ebf61ced9ec6a\nThis will only affect new dashing instances. If you want an existing dashboard to be fixed, youll just need to replace the code in your twitter.rb file with the one I just linked to.\n. And here's an awesome article on html5 audio: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/\n. Seems like an issue with the latest sinatra_contrib gem. Dashing started off using 1.3.2, which allows for the content_for(:title) { \"blablablab\" } syntax. Not sure what happened. We will switch to the syntax used in #153, since it also seems to be backwards compatible.\n. Are there javascript errors caused by Google Maps that might be preventing any further javascript from running? Can you provide a javascript console log?\nWhen you say reloading the backend makes it work again, do you also refresh the browser?\n. It is generated and served automatically by the server at runtime. Uses sprockets.\n. Whoa, norwegian broadcasting unit! That's awesome. \n. @thenayr WHOA THAT'S AMAZING.\n. I am trying to think of a good theming system for Dashing :)\n@thenayr: Did you guys implement the ability to swipe between dashboards, or is that functionality of the tv browser switching tabs?\n. Hey! Thanks for pointing that out. I had pushed out a new version of the gem to the demo page, and forgot to change the auth token. Good catch.\n. I should probably strip out those script tags though...\n. @drubin, Good suggestion: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki/How-To:-Send-HTML-data-to-your-widgets\n. I also think that persisting to a history file should not be default behaviour. What do you guys think?\n. Awesome, thanks.\n. Yeah, moving all discussion to #427 for now\n. What @davefp suggest would be the easiest IMO. I think it's pretty clean to use the html attributes as a way of configuring the widget. \n. The issue is that you have a function called 'render', which is overriding Batman's render function. I would name it something else, and it should work :)\n. Can you guys try with execjs 2.0.1 and see if that works?\nI can only reproduce it with 2.0.0\n. Hey,\nPut this in your config.ru\nset :protection, :except => :frame_options\nIt allows cross domain embedding.\nI should add this to the default config.\nOn Sunday, August 25, 2013, mintigoYael wrote:\n\nHi,\nI created a new dashing project with a new dashing dashboard, and it works\nwithout any problems.\nI wish to present it in iframe inside html, but I can't.

Out of curiosity, what are you looking for in Masonry that would make it better?\n. Yeah decided not to go with Masonry for reasons mentioned above.\n. Dashing is currently relying on Sprockets to compile all the coffeescript assets and provide it in 1 single file. It also does some nifty things like making the widget html files available at /views/[widget_name].html. \nThe real way of doing this without a backend would be to handle includes using something like RequireJS, and compile coffeescript assets manually. \nIn the meantime, (and as a proof of concept) I just copied the generated application.js and application.css files and placed them in a repo:\nDEMO: http://pushmatrix.github.io/mini-dashing/\nhttps://github.com/pushmatrix/mini-dashing\nYou can play around with the widgets with something like: \njavascript\nDashing.widgets.welcome[0].receiveData({text:\"WOOHOO IT WORKS\"})\n. That is the idea for Dashing 2.0, to be able to support different backends.\nIn the meantime, include the following scripts in your html (in this order)\n- jquery\n- es5-shim\n- batman\n- batman.jquery\n- dashing.js (compiled from dashing.coffee.)\n  You can find these in (https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/tree/master/javascripts)\n  Here's a link on compiling all coffeescript files in a directory (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8817281/coffeescript-compile-all-coffee-files-in-current-directory-and-all-sub-direct)\nNow you need to include each widget you want. So if you want the list widget, the meter widget, and the text widget, you would compile the list.coffee, meter.coffee and text.coffee. and require them in your html.\nYou will also need to include all the files in https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/tree/master/templates/project/assets/javascripts. Be sure to compile the coffeescript files.\nAs for css, you need to require all the files in https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/tree/master/templates/project/assets/stylesheets. For the scss ones, you can find documentation online on how to convert them. I personally use LiveReload to monitor and compile assets (if I don't have a backend doing it for me).\nNext is to include all the css for the widgets. You need to compile all the individual widget scss (list.scss,etc...), and include those.\nThose should be all the files you need to keep the project more maintainable (and less of a giant blob of js).\n. You can either check for Sinatra::Application.connections.empty? inside the job, or if you want to do it for ALL jobs:\nPut this in config.ru\n``` ruby\nmodule Rufus::Scheduler\n  class Job\n    old_trigger = self.instance_method(:trigger)\ndefine_method(:trigger) do\n  unless Sinatra::Application.connections.empty?\n    old_trigger.bind(self).call\n  end\nend\n\nend\nend\n``\n. TrySinatra::Application.settings.auth_token. Try justSinatra::Application.auth_token`\n. :+1: \n. You can use something like this:\ncoffeescript\nDashing.Widget::accessor 'updatedAtMessage', ->\n    if updatedAt = @get('updatedAt')\n      timestamp = new Date(updatedAt * 1000)\n      hours = timestamp.getHours()\n      minutes = (\"0\" + timestamp.getMinutes()).slice(-2)\n      seconds = (\"0\" + timestamp.getSeconds()).slice(-2)\n      \"Last updated at #{hours}:#{minutes}:#{seconds}\"\n. ?\n. Anything interesting popping up in the javascript console?\n. From ruby land, it is:\nSinatra::Application.settings.history\n. Keep in mind that it only stores the last data sent, nothing further back.\n. I decided I would update the base twitter widget to using 5.0.0, and update the Gemfile to use 5.0.0 as well.\nhttps://github.com/Shopify/dashing/commit/5b045724acd44e691552c0fb8f86b61aa2e0cd06\nThe reason for this is that going forward, all new users will be using the latest twitter gem. For anyone with older versions of the gem, their Gemfile would need to be changed anyway (since updating the gem won't update the generated Gemfile in your project).\n. Hey @pseudomuto. I'm looking into this.\n. Let me do a quick check. Apologies for the delays. I've been in the midst of lots of travelling.\n. Awesome work @pseudomuto, and amazing code coverage. Thanks a bunch!\n. The closest you'll get to an API right now is to use the same endpoint (/events) that the dashboards use the get their values. \nExample:\nhttp://dashingdemo.herokuapp.com/events\nIt's designed to be streaming and to use Server Sent Events. There should be libraries in your favourite language that make it easy to handle it. \n. Will merge today.\n. Thanks for bringing this up. Sorry for the long delay in merging it.\n. Unfortunately no simple way right now, but will be coming in the next version. I never really liked the history file anyway...\nWhat you could do is put this in your config.ru file:\nSinatra::Application.settings.history.clear\nThis will make sure that the history is cleared when the app starts.\n. I'd rather not add a dependency on redis gems. I'd prefer if this functionality could be added as a separate gem. Something like dashing-redis. I should look into a nice extendable way of creating these for dashing. I can imagine people wanting to use different data stores.\n. Thanks!\n. I've been meaning to see up a google group. Stay tuned. \nStack overflow has a dashing tag that yields answers:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dashing\n.

That I'm not sure about. Dashing uses \"sinatra\" as its server, so you can search for \"Sinatra + MS SQL\" to see how other people are doing it.\n. In your application.coffee, you can configure the sizing of base widgets:\ncoffeescript\nDashing.on 'ready', ->\n  Dashing.widget_margins ||= [5, 5]\n  Dashing.widget_base_dimensions ||= [300, 360]\n  Dashing.numColumns ||= 4\nYou can play around with that to fit your screen :)\n. The CSS is fully customizable, and most likely it is the font sizes that are causing problems. \n. This looks good to me. I tried it out and it didn't seem to have any breaking changes. Thanks!\n. @wolfspyre Feel free to create PR for 0.5.6 :)\n. I noticed it too. Looking into it. This is new.\n. Fixed it here https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/pull/366\n. Thanks for pointing it out guys. Update to version 1.3.4 and you should be golden\n. +1 @protomouse. Awesome deduction.\nGood to see you found your solution, @spuder :)\n. Out of the box it should always get the last value of the widget when you refresh the page (regardless of when the job is scheduled).\nDoes this happen to you with the sample dashboards? \n. Hmmm... but the sample dashboards have number widgets on them. And you're saying those work?\n. Ah, glad you solved it. Hmmm, that is a potential gotcha that I'll keep in mind for 2.0.\n. This change may not be necessary for everyone. If you want this format in your project, you just need to put this in your application.coffee\ncoffeescript\nDashing.Widget.accessor 'updatedAtMessage', ->\n    if updatedAt = @get('updatedAt')\n      timestamp = new Date(updatedAt * 1000)\n      month = timestamp.getMonth() + 1\n      day = timestamp.getDate()\n      hours = timestamp.getHours()\n      minutes = (\"0\" + timestamp.getMinutes()).slice(-2)\n      \"Last updated at #{hours}:#{minutes} on #{month}/#{day}\"\nand it will override the default Dashing one.\n. I'm on my phone and can't see it right now. I'm just in transit so\ngive me a sec to take a look\n. So my concern here is that some users of Dashing don't use thin. I\nrealize that it's still a hardcoded dependency so they'll have to\ninclude it in anyway... I guess this override won't run if they use\nsomething different, correct?\nDashing 2.0 will be a tad more agnostic for this.\n. It already is. Look at http://dashingdemo.herokuapp.com/sampletv\n. Yep that's where you put it. It will then be accessible to you from any dashboard.\n. Looks really valuable. Will add to Dashing 2.0 widgets.\n. Unfortunately not much progress made yet :(\n. I can't reproduce it on Chrome. What browser are you on?\n. Ah, I see what you mean. I thought you meant it was preventing drag handling.\n. Thanks for the fix :)\n. Open3 is a lib that gives you access to stdout, so you could do something like:\nruby\nrequire 'open3'\nx = Open3.capture2('perl myscript.pl')\nsend_event('my_widget', { value: x })\nfrom within a job, and it will send the value that you got to all widgets with id='my_widget'\nHere's the docs for Open3: http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/open3/rdoc/Open3.html\nThat's just one of the ways. You could also use the job scheduler just to launch the perl script, and then do the API call to dashing from within perl... \n. You can use js if you want, but each widget needs to adhere to the coffeescript \"class\" structure.\nI used http://js2coffee.org to convert the list widget to js, and it looks something like:\n``` javascript\nvar hasProp = {}.hasOwnProperty,\n  __extends = function(child, parent) { for (var key in parent) { if (__hasProp.call(parent, key)) child[key] = parent[key]; } function ctor() { this.constructor = child; } ctor.prototype = parent.prototype; child.prototype = new ctor(); child.__super = parent.prototype; return child; };\nDashing.List = (function(_super) {\n  __extends(List, _super);\nfunction List() {\n    return List.super.constructor.apply(this, arguments);\n  }\nList.prototype.ready = function() {\n    if (this.get('unordered')) {\n      return $(this.node).find('ol').remove();\n    } else {\n      return $(this.node).find('ul').remove();\n    }\n  };\nreturn List;\n})(Dashing.Widget);\n```\nHere is the js version of the graph widget:\n``` javascript\nvar hasProp = {}.hasOwnProperty,\n  __extends = function(child, parent) { for (var key in parent) { if (__hasProp.call(parent, key)) child[key] = parent[key]; } function ctor() { this.constructor = child; } ctor.prototype = parent.prototype; child.prototype = new ctor(); child.__super = parent.prototype; return child; };\nDashing.Graph = (function(_super) {\n  __extends(Graph, _super);\nfunction Graph() {\n    return Graph.super.constructor.apply(this, arguments);\n  }\nGraph.accessor('current', function() {\n    var points;\n    if (this.get('displayedValue')) {\n      return this.get('displayedValue');\n    }\n    points = this.get('points');\n    if (points) {\n      return points[points.length - 1].y;\n    }\n  });\nGraph.prototype.ready = function() {\n    var container, height, width, x_axis, y_axis;\n    container = $(this.node).parent();\n    width = (Dashing.widget_base_dimensions[0] * container.data(\"sizex\")) + Dashing.widget_margins[0] * 2 * (container.data(\"sizex\") - 1);\n    height = Dashing.widget_base_dimensions[1] * container.data(\"sizey\");\n    this.graph = new Rickshaw.Graph({\n      element: this.node,\n      width: width,\n      height: height,\n      series: [\n        {\n          color: \"#fff\",\n          data: [\n            {\n              x: 0,\n              y: 0\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    });\n    if (this.get('points')) {\n      this.graph.series[0].data = this.get('points');\n    }\n    x_axis = new Rickshaw.Graph.Axis.Time({\n      graph: this.graph\n    });\n    y_axis = new Rickshaw.Graph.Axis.Y({\n      graph: this.graph,\n      tickFormat: Rickshaw.Fixtures.Number.formatKMBT\n    });\n    return this.graph.render();\n  };\nGraph.prototype.onData = function(data) {\n    if (this.graph) {\n      this.graph.series[0].data = data.points;\n      return this.graph.render();\n    }\n  };\nreturn Graph;\n})(Dashing.Widget);\n```\nIt's not the prettiest, but it should work.\n. Of course! The beauty of Dashing is that EVERYTHING is customizable.\nTo change the background, modify the body in the application.scss file.\n. http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-image.asp\n. Do you have a demo URL we can check out? \n. That's an interesting idea, and could be handy for changing static things inside text widgets. To make this look nice and be more functional, I think it would clutter up the codebase and ease of use. I also don't see 80%+ of dashboard users using it. It would be cool to see as a plugin though.\nThanks for sharing!\n. I'm not able to reproduce the problem. I can set Dashing.numColumns = 9 and I get more than six columns, and my widgets can also span the whole length. Was there a new version of gridster that put a hard limit at 6?\n. Inside your gemfile, you can specify it to use the master branch on github. Something to the tune of:\ngem 'dashing', :git => 'https://github.com/Shopify/dashing.git'\nFor more advanced usage, look at: http://bundler.io/git.html\n. I want to make this happen while remaining backwards compatible\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Well said @tylermauthe \n. Hallo, cool to see you using Dashing!\nThere are no licensing issues with this. I think that putting license headers in all generated files looks kinda bloated and corporate. I see you added the \"This dashboard is based on dashing from Shopify\", and while not required, is cool by me :)\nEnjoy Dashing!\n. Closing this for now. Re-open if you are still having issues.\n. X-Frame-Options is your culprit\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/X-Frame-Options\nThe issue here is that google prevents people from iframing their page from other domains. You can check the response headers yourself.\n\nUnfortunately there isn't really a good way around this, but maybe this can be of help?\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/a/25587469/208314\n. That's not possible. The widgets have no concept of the jobs that run them.\nYou could add a custom endpoint to your dashing server though, that first updates the database and then sends an event to the dashboards.\n. You could add to the server logic, similar to how authentication works: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki/How-to:-Add-authentication\nProbably just hook into the send_event method and do whatever logging you want.\n. Strange that you're seeing these issues. I just followed the regular dashing instructions and pushed it without having to specify a ruby version.\nhttps://pure-journey-2648.herokuapp.com/sample\n. Closing for now. If @tylermauthe's suggestion doesn't work, just re-open.\n. Closing this for now till more demand shows up.\n. I would like to. Still evaluation options.\n. Seems like the react.js train is rolling :P\n. Hey folks,\nSorry for the delay in all this. There's been a lot of evaluation lately of different technologies to replace Batman, but I've decided to keep it as-is. Batman bindings are simple and still work. In an hour or so you can be familiar with the syntax and can throw together great dashboards. Many people coming to Dashing have never used a binding library before, so they'll need to learn new syntax anyway (whether it be vue, react, or whatever). The benefits of switching to a different library are not worth breaking many of the community widgets that have been created, especially now that the project is no longer being actively maintained.\nHopefully forks like the one above using vue.js can provide a good template for people wanting to expand on the library and use the binding system of their choice.\n. Thanks for your work on this. \nThe goal for Dashing is to be as simple and readable as possible. That's why SSEs were originally favoured over websockets, because they are a ton simpler.\nI want to keep the base installation minimalistic, so I suggest we leave this PR here for people who are curious about adding websockets (or other engine) support to Dashing. \n. @kneradovsky Feel free :)\n. Yeehaa!\n. Thanks @adambyrtek, this is a great fix :)\n. Have you tried any of these suggestions? \nhttps://gist.github.com/stonehippo/5896381\n. Sweet thanks!\n. There currently isn't, but that's a pretty good idea and I'll look into adding it.\nIn the meantime, there is a workaround. Inside your config.ru file, paste the following inside the configure do....end block:\nruby\nget '/widgets/:id.json' do\n  content_type :json\n  if data = settings.history[params[:id]]\n    data.split[1]\n  end\nend\nYou should then be able to go to /widgets/your_widget_name.json to get the most recent data :)\n. Like @tylermauthe said, you should be receiving 204's:\nhttps://github.com/Shopify/dashing/blob/master/lib/dashing/app.rb#L108\n. Closing this for now. But please share when you're done :)\n. Not dead, just unfortunately not maintained as well as I'd like. I apologize for that.\nI have been working on other projects at Shopify and have not had much time to give Dashing the love it deserves. \nI need to do a big triage of the PRs. Some are okay to merge, and some do have some non backwards compatible changes.\n. Thanks!\n. Hi there,\nPlease post these types of questions to stack overflow. The Dashing issues list should be reserved for issues relating to core dashing. Any questions related to writing custom widgets fall outside this scope.\nI will be updating the readme shortly with these issue guidelines.\nThanks!\n. Ah this is great! Thanks so much for doing this :)\n. Amazing! I'm merging now\n. Thank you!\n. Strange, you shouldn't need to have node.js installed for this to work. Glad you got it working though.\n. Hey this sounds like a great idea. I do agree that most people using it don't use scrolling.\nHowever many run dashing off of raspberry PIs and dedicated boxes, which may not have access to press 'f' for fullscreenage.\n. I assume you're talking about a widget based on showing DFP?\n. Be at the root of your dashing dir, and do bundle exec dashing start\n. Core Dashing deals with Server Sent Events and not Websockets. Like @tylermauthe mentioned, help requests for things not part of Dashing should be directed to Stack Overflow.\n. The main use cases I've seen for Dashing have been to design for a single screen in mind (ex: a tv). If you want to optimize for smaller screens, you can set the dimensions using something like @mapledyne mentioned. There may be some css needing to be tweaked.\nDashing was created so that you pick the exact spots where widgets will be. After all, it's nice to always see the widgets in the place you expect them. If it becomes responsive, then suddenly you lose some of that. I'm open for convincing though.\n. @agassner How much memory?\n. Is your box crashing or is the browser tab crashing?\n. @robacarp I unfortunately was mistaken. I thought we were running Puma at Shopify, but it turns out we aren't :(. It was a discussion a few ops peeps had and I had thought they switched it, but didn't. Sad...\nI will have to look into it further then. I'd like to have Puma in shortly. Can't give an exact date @MartynKeigher, but will look into your pastebin. Thanks for putting that together.\n. :+1:\n. Check out the documentation on how to add authentication, and it includes adding in some endpoints (like '/auth/g/callback')\nhttps://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki/How-to:-Add-authentication\n. Hey @zwergengott, these types of questions are better suited for Stack Overflow. This issue list is best used for problems related to Dashing itself.\nCheers!\n. Looks like this is affecting other gems too. It seems to deal with El Capitain no longer coming with OpenSSL headers. See if the fixes here work for you: https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine/issues/643\n. Sounds good! Thanks :)\n. Thanks!\n. LGTM. Good find.\n. :+1:\n. Ah damn, didn't realize they changed it. If you figure out what's changed it'd be great to get that merged in.\n. Thanks @MartynKeigher!\n. For integrations related questions, please direct them to Stack Overflow.\n. @qbrossard @tylermauthe this is looking real good :)\n. Thanks for you work on this @qbrossard and @tylermauthe. Let's get this thing merged this week. I'll be reviewing it shortly.\n. Hey @qbrossard and @tylermauthe.\nI've given a lot of thought into this, and unfortunately I have changed my mind on putting this into master. I initially thought that the switch to puma would be straightforward, but it seems like there are many gotchas in the way, and that it doesn't play very nice with Sinatra. As this project has now become no longer actively maintained, I fear that adding a bunch of complexity may introduce new issues that may not be addressed. I also don't want to break any existing dashboards out there.\nWhat I suggest we do is make a branch for it, with a wiki article on how to use it. That way people will be able to use JRuby if they want to, and they won't have to fear about missing out on features because....well....there probably won't be any new ones coming :\\\nThanks guys for your help in diving into this! Hopefully it was a good learning process, and I hope it will be of use to other people looking to use Puma and Dashing.\nCheers!\n. It's now an official branch over here: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/tree/puma_webserver\nIf there any gotchas or specific things someone needs when running it, feel free to post them on this wiki: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki/How-To%3A-Run-Dashing-on-Puma\n. Of course! Thanks @qbrossard !\n. Thanks for you help with this @jmb!\n. Hey @charlievogt. These questions are better suited for Stack Overflow instead of as an issue here.\nWhat you're running into is that Dashing expects data as JSON and not as plain form data. You'll need to use some javascript to turn the form data into valid JSON before sending it off\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/22195065/how-to-send-a-json-object-using-html-form-data\n. Hmm, not sure I can be of much help because this project doesn't rely on Rails at all. It's a Sinatra app.\nMaybe the folks over at dashing-rails can be of help: https://github.com/gottfrois/dashing-rails\n. @fuzzy76 @webmaster128 Yes of course!\n. @mgifford Maybe not big enough, but there has been mention of the fork for some time:\n\n\n\n. Oh shit, that's not good. Fixed!\nThanks for bringing that up.. Why enforcing 2.0?\n. Is this to aid in testing or just for extra clarity?\n. Here's the PR that introduced that change for some context: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/pull/383\nI am aware that this is thing dependant, and I do want to take it out.\n. I think it's fine\n. Yeah, although it's nice to have consistency with verb tenses and moods, I don't want to make the list of \"rules\"/\"suggestions\" seem too long. I'd just stick with the emojis\n. I don't think it's necessary to mention this.\n. Awesome! That's a great idea\n. I'd leave the last line out. It's enough to say that we will discuss and critique.\n. Well put!\n. :(\n. Just send them this: https://vimeo.com/93947228\n. I'd just link them here for now: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki#how-tos\n. Mention that they should add them here: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki/Additional-Widgets#other-third-party-tools\n. Is there a weird newline here between idea and fits?\n. updated:\nFeature requests are welcome, but take a moment to consider whether your idea fits with the scope and aim of the project. A good rule of thumb is to apply the 80/20 rule: every feature should be useful to at least 80% of users. Adding in every possible edge case will only make it more difficult to understand, maintain, and hack on.\n. Small nitpick. A questions mark at the end of this\n. I'll edit this on master\n. Each connection gets its own Mutex?\n. Can you guys explain this section a bit more?\n. There's no way to keep alive a connection without doing an idle loop?\n. ",

To be honest, there was very little to no work on this for quite a while, only some +1. I think this won't happen unless more folks are interested in this and diving in. The work I did 7 months ago was never tried or reviewed by anyone (not pointing at Dashing's team at all here, just saying no one from the community dived in). This makes me think there is not enough interest in that to make it worth to add complexity. Added complexity means harder to maintain and this is certainly not a good idea in an open source project for maintainers to add complexity only for a few folks interested to use it but not helping maintain it. My 2 cents! :)\nPS: this is all fine by me! :)\n. ",

It is working well, easy to use and I added a bunch of configuration options to it.\nI'm using Redis to push & pull data to the widgets since not all of us have their project under Rails 4 yet. This way you can have a dedicated app for your dashboards and a shared Redis database.\nIt's also functional using CURL commands.\nPlease give it a try and let me know what do you think. This is not a beta version, I am using it in my day to day work as a metrics viewer on a TV screen.\nHere is the link https://github.com/gottfrois/dashing-rails\nHave fun!\n. Either one is possible. You can have one dashing-rails app with many dashboards (one dashboard per application you want to monitor for example).

I've pinpointed the problem: Firefox doesn't seem to like the Dashing.AnimatedValue function that's being used to animate the transitions on the Number and Meter widgets.\n\nAs a workaround, you can simply remove the Dashing.AnimatedValue definition in those widgets.\n. As @pushmatrix mentioned the framework originally used masonry.js to do layouts,\nwhich gave a responsive feel. However, there were issues with wasted space\non the screen as the bottom of the dashboard was inevitably 'jagged' due to\ndifferent widgets being different sizes. Column 1 would be longer than\ncolumn 2, for example.\nTo answer the 'how hard would it be' question: Not very. The markup for\neach dashboard could remain the same, whilst the js controlling the grid\ncould be swapped out for something more responsive (masonry.js, Bootstrap's\nresponsive media queries, etc.).\nThe main use case we saw was to make a dashboard that would look equally\ngood on 1080p TVs and small mobile devices. Ultimately we decided that\nsimply creating a two dashboards (using the same widgets) was easier than\nhacking one together for both scenarios.\nOn 5 November 2012 23:05, Daniel Beauchamp notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nDashing uses Gridster.js http://gridster.net/ for its layout, and as\nsuch is bound by the responsive capabilities of that library. In its\noriginal state, it does not support auto-resizing, but there has been much\ndiscussion about it over at ducksboard/gridster.js#5https://github.com/ducksboard/gridster.js/issues/5\n.\nThere is one way to configure Gridster such that it will attempt to\nauto-layout the widgets based on the screen dimensions. The drawback is\nthat the layout is only applied to the initial size of the window; if you\nresize, nothing will happen. To get this to work, go inside your\napplication.coffee file and remove the line\nDashing.numColumns ||= 4\nAlso make sure that you don't have any custom Dashing.gridsterLayout()config at the top of your dashboard's\nerb file.\nDashing's original use case was to display dashboards on 1080p tvs in a\ndeterministic fashion. Libraries like Masonry.jshttp://masonry.desandro.com/demos/fluid.htmlwere tried at first, but the issue was the widgets wouldn't necessarily\nrender in the same spot, or in visually appealing layouts.\nAlthough responsive wasn't the initial goal, I'd love to see something\nthat makes this possible for Dashing. Any suggestions are welcome.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/Shopify/dashing/issues/11#issuecomment-10098608.\n. @kevinthompson @MartynKeigher @joannecheng  I'm open to a merging a pull request with an alternate responsive layout.\n. Still open to a PR on this, but the question posed has been answered.\n. Merged as part of PR #164 \n. I'm also interested in getting this nailed down. Specifically, what format should new widgets take?\n\nMy ideal use-case would be bundling new widgets in gems dashing-whatever that can be added to a project's gemfile.\nYou would then be able to add the job and/or widget associated with the gem to the project with a command like this:\ndashing generate [widget|job] whatever\nDashing would recognise that 'whatever' is an existing widget and generate an instance of the whatever template for a job or widget rather than the default empty one.\nI had a go at implementing this yesterday but my knowledge of ruby metaprogramming failed me and I didn't get anywhere. :(\nWhat are other people's opinion on this? Am I overengineering things?\n. Good point.\nPer widget config could be done with further params dashing generate job whatever as whatever2 username password, this is really easy to do in Thor.\nIn fact, I'd ditch the 'as' and just have this: `dashing generate [widget|job] whatever name [options]\n. A javascript runtime is not explicitly specified by Dashing as some of them\nare platform dependent, people have preferences, etc.. Dashing uses ExecJS\nto pick a runtime at runtime  (yo dawg...) so you'll need to make sure you\nhave one installed before running Dashing.

You can add an onData: method to your widget's coffee file to do transformations whenever new data arrives.

You'll have to create a new widget to do so, I recommend copying the number widget.\n\nOnce you have a new widget, look in the coffescript file and you'll find an onData method that gets called when it gets updated. In there you can do a switch on the value and set the background colour depending on the result.\n. @MartynKeigher You mentioned that you already know how to change the colour of the widget, so update the code in @pushmatrix's example to act on the background instead of the meter.\n. Works For Me (tm). Can you post more info about your environment? Browser, OS, etc.\nI wonder if there's some weird version mismatch going on somewhere. I've uploaded my Gemfile.lock, compare it to yours and see if there are any suspicious differences: https://gist.github.com/davefp/5149163\n. This change will make ALL h2 tags on the dashboard smaller. The correct place to do this would be in clock.scss instead so that it doesn't affect other widgets.\nEven then, this bug is dependant on the width of the widget. On the sample tv dashboard the clock displays fine.\nBecause of that, I don't think this edit is suitable for propagation back to the mainline.\n. Dashing relies on Server Sent Events, which aren't supported in IE.\n. All dashing start is really doing is calling this: bundle exec thin -R config.ru start -p 3030\nI'd hazard a guess that you've got some gem incompatibility going on somewhere. What happens if you run bundle exec thin start?\n. I thought that might happen :)\nSomewhere you have a version of a gem that's causing an incompatibility. I'm having a hard time figuring out which one. Here's my Gemfile.lock for a working dashing project. Compare it to yours and see if there are any differences.

Dashing uses Thin as its application server, so I'd recommend looking there for advice on scaling out the application to handle more concurrent users.\n\nUltimately it'll depend on your available resources, at some point you'll run out of memory/cpu cycles/available connections on the box you're running Dashing on. It's hard to give you good advice as I'm unaware of your setup.\n. This issue is out of scope for being solved here.\n. What's wrong with redirecting to a dashboard? I feel that allowing a default and root dashboard is confusing and unnecessary for most people.\n. Agreed. This is too specific for general use. Closing.\n. @pushmatrix Did this get done? If so let's close this issue.\n. Keep in mind that the browser state is not shared. Each client would have a different version of the list and if they refreshed they'd lose all the old state.\nIf you still want to do this, you'd need to create a new widget (based on the existing list widget maybe) that did some DOM manipulation in the onData function to append (or prepend) incoming data to the list already present.\n. Merged, but I don't have access to rubygems so it won't go out until @pushmatrix is around to push it there.\n. I'm a bit iffy on the hardcoded timeouts for server restarts. It seems somewhat arbitrary. An exponential backoff over a longer period might work better.\nI'd also like to see the restart route removed. I don't see it being very useful to most people.\n. You can use conditional comments in IE9 and below to render content to IE users only: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537512(v=vs.85).aspx\nFor IE10, MS recommends a different fallback strategy: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh273396(v=vs.85).aspx\n. @MartynKeigher Have you tried either of the solutions here?

Unless @atrophic wants to do it himself ;)\n. This wiki page has the info you need: How to change the default dashboard\n. At Shopify, we run our dashboards on HD TVs around the office. We used to run them through the built-in browser but we found that the processor on the TV wasn't up to the job. Now we have a Raspberry Pi attached to each TV to do the hard work for us. It works really well.\nI did a quick search for getting a web page running as a screensaver on Linux but didn't come up with anything I could pass on to you without knowing more about your setup. If you get something running, it would make a great addition to the wiki.\n. Default widget sizes are defined in application.coffee. Here's the line in question.\n. @pushmatrix I tweaked the functionality to put the history file in the local Dashing dir (i.e. .). I wasn't aware of the tempfile functionality though, that's a great alternative.\n. @derwin12 It should Just Work\u2122.\nMake sure that you run bundle update dashing in your project and then start the server with bundle exec dashing start. Once you shut it down you should see a history.yml file in your project dir.\n. @derwin12 \nRunning bundle update updates all dependencies listed in your gemfile to their most recent version. bundle update dashing will only update Dashing. This is useful when you have a lot of dependencies but only want to update one.\nAppending bundle exec to your command is basically saying 'use the version of the gem listed in the gemfile, rather than the system default'. The system default is the one you installed by running gem install dashing. If you run gem update dashing then you'll update the system's default install and you'll be able to drop the bundle exec.\nHere's a Stack Overflow Q/A in the context of rake, but the situation is the same here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6588674/what-does-bundle-exec-rake-mean\n. I think a solution on the client side would be more appropriate. Some more powerful number formatting tools can be found here: http://emcien.github.io/number-helpers-coffeescript/\n. You can do that in the onData function for a specific widget. There are a couple of widgets that do special things when updated, take a look at number.coffee for an example: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/blob/master/templates/project/widgets/number/number.coffee#L18\n. The code to parse the numbers is assuming that the delimiter is a .. The author is German (as far as I can tell) so the follower numbers would be written as 8.000 if localized correctly. In English speaking countries, that number would be 8,000, so removing the dot is unnecessary.\nTry removing the .delete('.') portion of the parsing code and see if that helps.\n. That should do it :)\n. Running gem update dashing will update the local copy of  Dashing.\nRunning bundle update dashnig will update the bundled version for your project only.\nYou probably want to do both, unless you start Dashing with bundle exec every time.\n. Thanks for the heads up!\n. Interesting. You're exactly right, the content_for line sets the title, which should be yielded in the layout on line 9\nFor some reason it's not. I'll have to look into it. Thanks for noticing :)\n. We haven't done a release to RubyGems with that functionality yet (it's still serving 1.0.6). If you wait it'll get released soon.\nIf you want thew new features now, you can clone the repo onto your local machine, then run this from the root dir of the repo:\ngem build dashing.gemspec\ngem install dashing-1.0.7.gem\nThat will build and install the newest code locally for you.\n. @derwin12 I just released version 1.1.0 of the gem, it contains all recent updates including the history file. Enjoy!\n. Please see #127, it deals with the same issue (albeit for a slightly different purpose)\n. This line is incorrect: tweets = Twitter.search(\"@{search_term}\").results\nThe hash on that line (which you replaced with an @) has nothing to do with the twitter search. It's part of the ruby syntax for including variables in double quoted strings. Revert your change to that line and everything should work.\ntl;dr: The only thing you need to change is the search term: search_term = URI::encode('@username')\n. @MartynKeigher At this point I'd recommend reading the docs for the Twitter gem that's being used to get the info. How to use Twitter's API (and its capabilities in general) is out of scope of this project.\n. Closing as off-topic.\nThere are plenty of modal dialog libraries out there, and adding them to a webpage is a generic issue that's not specific to Dashing.\nI'd start by finding a library you'd like to use, giving it a try, and asking for help there if you have issues.\n.

I was able to get it working using the snippet @apeckham posted previously.\nWith regard to the status classed (warning/danger), setting the value to anything else should clear it. I commonly send 'status': 'normal' to do this. If that's still not working for you, please give us more information on exactly what you're doing so we can see where you're going wrong.\n. I believe so. Like you said, dashing is a sinatra app running on Thin. Under the hood, dashing start calls bundle exec thin -R config.ru start.\nLooking at the Thin docs, you can specify a number of config files in /etc/thin for the different apps you want thin to run for you. I'd create as many YAML config files as you need and point them each at a different rackup file. Then you should be able to start the server using thin start --servers 2.\nI've not actually tried this, but the Thin docs and some Googling lead me to believe it should work.\n. I'm not familiar with Rack::URLMap, and a quick search didn't reveal much. Can you elaborate on what it does and how it would help when using Dashing?\n. I like this a lot, it leaves the door open for people to add their own global events rather than locking them to certain ones.\n@cjolly I get the feeling that we should interrupt message propagation before calling Dashing.fire if it's not meant for our dashboard. Right now we have to check in each of the handlers. Please implement this and I'll merge the PR.\n. @cjolly Would you mind expanding this PR to use the temp file functionality for the history file everywhere (i.e. during regular use)? I was unaware of Dir.tmpdir when I merged the current implementation, and I think it would run a lot cleaner this way.\n. @cjolly I see. Thanks for the explanation. I definitely want the history file to stick around between server restarts, so let's leave it as-is. Merging.\n. What @pushmatrix said. The source files are application.scss for the styles and application.coffee for the js.\n. I'm not sure what's going on, but your browser window is reporting an IP address that isn't localhost in your screenshot. Have you modified your Hosts file at all?\n. If you don't know where it is, the chances are you've not edited it. If you\nwant to take a look though, here's a good guide:\nhttp://blog.grapii.com/2012/08/how-to-edit-the-hosts-file-in-mac-os-x-10-8-mountain-lion/\nOn 22 July 2013 16:13, allisonmin notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHow do I get to the host file?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/Shopify/dashing/issues/169#issuecomment-21372014\n.\n. I think you have some strange things going on with your network. I'm afraid there's not much I can do to help from here, but it's not an issue with Dashing.\n. Your code should look like this:\n\nsend_event('tvLRnumberFF', { \"background-color\" => B21404 })\nYour symbol won't parse because of the dash, but switching it to a string should work.\nAs for the second question, look at using if statements in ruby. It's a very common task, so reading up on it will serve you well later on too.\n. Please squash these commits together and I'll merge this. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. That script is designed to make sure that any binaries installed by gems are on your execution path. I'm not much of  a shell scripter, so I can't tell you why it's not working.\nOn the other hand, I have an alternate method you might try. Adding the bin path to your global PATH variable should allow you to run anything that's installed by rubygems. Here's a good guide: http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-newbie-8/how-to-set-path-variables-403964/\nIf you run into more issues, I recommend Googling around the topic of running ruby binaries in linux in general, it should help you out.\nOh, one small thing: /var/lib/gem/1.9.1/bin/dashing -start is incorrect. you need to drop the dash before start.\nIt should look like this: /var/lib/gem/1.9.1/bin/dashing start\n. @awestvik please re-open this issue if you still have problems.\n. I'd love to see more themes. If you want to create one go ahead, and I can create a page on the wiki for third-party themes similar to the widget one that we can kick off with your submission.\n. @thenayr Excellent! I look forward to seeing it :)\n. @thenayr wow, that's badass. I love the Leap Motion integration!\n. Good call. merged\n. Take a look at the buzzwords.rb example job, it populates a list widget.\nSpecifically, you need to send an items array that contains hashes with label and value keys. It should end up looking a little like this:\njson\n    items: [\n      {'label': 'Incident', 'value': 22},\n      {'label': 'Request', 'value': 1}\n    ]\n. Can you post the jobs code you're running? That would help me diagnose the issue.\n. Are you starting Dashing with bundle exec dashing start?. I have a feeling you're mixing your Dashing versions somehow, prepending bundle exec will make sure that everything is using the same version.\n. That's very strange.\nWhat happens if you create a new Dashing project (dashing new blah) and run that? If it works, try copying your custom jobs/widgets etc. over to the new project and see if it causes it to break.\nSorry I can't be more help :(\n. @Sgoettschkes any luck with this?\n. Very strange. I'm sorry that I can't help further, but hopefully now that you've got things working on your laptop you'll be able to proceed. Best of luck!\n. Glad you guys got it sorted :)\nI think there might be a case for adding some better error handling around the loading of the history file. I'll have a think.\n. As discussed in #161, background colour isn't directly editable through the event. Assuming you still have your modified number.coffee file that scans for data['background-color'] though, the following should work:\nsend_event('tvLRtext2', { moreinfo: 'Latest Feedback', 'background-color' => 'red'})\nNote that the \"background-color\" key is a string, as the dash means it can't be a symbol.\n. I updated this myself, I can't/won't merge pull requests with minified js, too high a risk of malicious code getting in. Thanks for the heads up though, I appreciate it.\n. I don't have a display that size to test on, but seeing as the default margins are 5px around each widget (making the gutter 10px), the following base dimensions should work:\nDashing.widget_base_dimensions ||= [263, 246]\nTweak those as necessary, but they should be pretty close.\n. The thing about the meter widget is that the graphic is basically circular. Right now it's set to be as wide as possible but if a widget is shorter than it is wide (like yours), it'll overflow. You can get around this by explicitly setting a data-width attribute on the meter itself. You can see it defined here: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/blob/master/templates/project/widgets/meter/meter.html\nHere are the docs for the library we're using to generate the meters, it might have more useful info for you: https://github.com/aterrien/jQuery-Knob\n. Turns out there's an undocumented height option you can specify too. add a data-height=\"150\" (or whatever height you need) attribute to the meter definition, that should fix it.\n. Create a copy of the list widget (or just edit the original) and have it apply the shortenedNumber filter defined here: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/blob/master/javascripts/dashing.coffee#L16\nThis is what the number widget does do display 10K instead of 10000. See it in use here: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/blob/master/templates/project/widgets/number/number.html#L3\nYour new list.html should look something like this:\n``` html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```\n. You'll also need to rename all the files in the new widget's directory. As long as your directory structure looks like this, you should be good to go:\n| widgets\n|\\ list\n| | list.html\n| | list.scss\n| | list.coffee\n|\\ listK\n| | listK.html\n| | listK.scss\n| | listK.coffee\n. You also need to edit the first line of listK.coffee to read\ncoffeescript\nclass Dashing.ListK extends Dashing.Widget\nI forgot to mention that, sorry.\n. I think this is happening because Dashing is taking the classname ListK and converting it to an underscored version to try and find the files. The convention is that file names are lower case with underscores before each previously capitalized letter. ListK becomes list_k.\nModify your folder name, file names, and the data-view property to be list_k and things should work again. If not, maybe just change the name to something simpler that's only one word.\n. I like this. Giving users the ability to use the app server of their choice is a great addition.\nBecause of the breaking changes it'll have to be part of a 2.0.0 release though, so I may not merge it in for a while. It will also be dependent on fixing the dashing stop command.\n. You can set an explicit font-size in the list.scss file.\nLook at the .li style defined here\nand change it to something like this:\ncss\n.li {\n  margin-bottom: 5px;\n  font-size: 12px; /*or whatever size you need*/\n}\n. If you want a style to apply to a single widget only, you can do the following:\nCreate a new file myWidget.scss in the assets/stylesheets folder. Inside, Add an id like this\n``` scss\nmyWidgetId {\nli {\n    font-size: 12px; / or whatever /\n  }\n}\n```\nThen add a class to the widget in question in your dashboard template:\nhtml\n    <li data-row=\"1\" data-col=\"1\" data-sizex=\"1\" data-sizey=\"2\">\n      <div id=\"myWidgetId\" data-id=\"buzzwords\" data-view=\"List\" data-unordered=\"true\" data-title=\"Buzzwords\" data-moreinfo=\"# of times said around the office\"></div>\n    </li>\nThe styles from myWidget.scss will only be applied to the widget with the id myWidgetId as all the styles are nested under that id. You could do this using a CSS class too if you have more than one widget that needs to be altered.\n. Dashing's graph widget is powered by Rickshaw, so anything it can do Dashing can do too. I recommend reading the full Rickshaw docs if you're going to be doing heavy customization of your graphs. I've also outlined how to achieve the effects you asked about below:\nThe y-axis can be fixed by setting min and max attributes on the graph object. It'll look something like this:\ncoffeescript\n@graph = new Rickshaw.Graph(\n      element: @node\n      width: width\n      height: height\n      min: 0\n      max: 10000\n      series: [\n        {\n        color: \"#fff\",\n        data: [{x:0, y:0}]\n        }\n      ]\n    )\nFor custom x-axis labels, take a look at the source of the example here: http://code.shutterstock.com/rickshaw/examples/x_axis.html, particularly this snippet near the bottom:\n``` js\nvar format = function(n) {\nvar map = {\n    0: 'zero',\n    1: 'first',\n    2: 'second',\n    3: 'third',\n    4: 'fourth'\n};\n\nreturn map[n];\n\n}\nvar x_ticks = new Rickshaw.Graph.Axis.X( {\n    graph: graph,\n    orientation: 'bottom',\n    element: document.getElementById('x_axis'),\n    pixelsPerTick: 200,\n    tickFormat: format\n} );\n```\n. Quick question: Can you provide a few more details about the platform\nyou're using? Which linux distro? 32 or 64 bit?\nFor Chrome, you can see the network usage by popping open DevTool\n(Tools>Developer Tools) and selecting the Network tab. You'll probably have\nto refresh the page before it starts logging.\nFrom there you'll be able to see each resource and when it was downloaded.\nThe /events resource should keep growing, as it's where the streaming\ndata is coming from. Over time you'll be able to see how much data is being\ndownloaded.\nOn 12 August 2013 15:26, bgood-trada notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI cycle through a few dashing dashboards with firefox or chrome on linux.\nFirefox slowly creeps up in memory usage over a day and will exhaust all\nmemory on the system in one day.\nI have tried chrome and I get excessive bandwidth usage for the same\nperiod.\nI don't see any special widgets being used.

That data usage is way higher than it should be.\n\nI just noticed that you say you're 'cycling through a few dashing dashboards' in the original issue. Can you expand on that a bit? It sounds like you may have written some custom code to do this, which might be causing the problem.\nAlso, what kind of data are you sending, and how frequently? Take a look at the jobs you're running on the server and see what they're sending. Maybe images are getting transmitted frequently, or you're updating a data-heavy widget with a high frequency.\n. This isn't possible without multiple widgets out of the box.\nI think the following would work OK:\nDefine all the HoverDetail objects in graph.coffee, and then in the ready function do a switch based on a data.hoverdetail variable being passed in and assign the correct hover detail accordingly.\nThen you could write something like this in your dashboard:\nhtml\n<li data-row=\"1\" data-col=\"1\" data-sizex=\"2\" data-sizey=\"1\">\n  <div data-id=\"convergence\" data-view=\"Graph\" data-title=\"Convergence\" data-hoverdetail=\"blah\" style=\"background-color:#ff9618\"></div>\n</li>\nThat's still going to clog up the graph coffeescript though. Js isn't my fort\u00e9 unfortunately, but I'm sure there's a way to tidy things up there.\n. @mrhaiem I need more info before I can help you.\nFirst up: What error are you getting? Please share any output you have.\n. When you load the page, open the developer tools (instructions for Chrome and FireFox). You should be able to see any warnings/errors emitted there. You should be able to fix the problem based on the info provided there.\n. :+1:\n. The updated at function is defined in dashing.coffee, here: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/blob/master/javascripts/dashing.coffee#L48\nI disagree that displaying HH:MM is 'wrong'. While it's less precise than HH:MM:SS it's accurate enough to still be useful.\nWhile the sample dashboards update widgets many times a minute, I've found that in production use it's much more likely that widgets only need updating every few minutes or longer.\nWith that in mind, I'm happy keeping the display as it is. If you want to change the behaviour on your own dashboards, you can override the method in your widget definitions.\n. Some of the newer icons won't work as Dashing doesn't (currently) use the most up-to-date version of fontawesome.\nCan you see the icons on the sampletv demo dashboard? In addition to Twitter the Clock widget has a clock and the Karma widget has a heart.\n. Start dashing with bundle exec dashing start to make sure you're getting all the correct gems loaded. Let me know if you're still seeing issues then.\n. The text widget just spits out what you send to it, so simply sending your data as a string should work. If you need line breaks, drop <br /> tags into your text and add the raw filter to the text widget HTML (otherwise it'll get parsed out).\n. Is this something you're planning on working on, or a feature request?\n. Absolutely, please submit a PR and I'll look at it. Thanks!\n. If you start Dashing with bundle exec dashing start the jobs you've written will get run on the schedule they define. The foobugs job you reference is set to run every 30 seconds, as defined here: https://github.com/foobugs/foobugs-dashboard/blob/master/jobs/yahoo_stockquote.rb#L32\nCan you post the full source of the job file you're trying to run? I get the feeling something isn't being loaded correctly.\nAlso, the latest version of Dashing is 1.2.0, so the version you've listed in your question must be from something else. Running bundle list | grep dashing in your project's folder should yield the version number.\n. Glad you got it sorted. I'll look into the ruby 1.9 vs 2.0 and update the docs as necessary\n. Fixes #206\n. @micpango While you were looking at this, did you find a workaround for #149?\nI'd love to have a wiki page detailing the steps required to get Dashing running on a sub-path. Once this is merged in and the next release goes out, would you be interested in writing one?\n. Very interesting. Can you reliably reproduce the case where the dashboard never re-attaches to the server? I restart my server all the time during development and I don't usually have a problem with the Dashboard failing to re-connect.\n. This is as designed. If you can't change the system clock on your machine then I cant't really help I'm afraid.\n. What section of the code is failing? In the web inspector in your browser grab a copy of the compiled application.js and see which lines are actually failing.\nAlso, jquery.min might just be a version of jquery in which case you can remove it as jquery is already loaded by Dashing\n. This site should help you out: http://js2coffee.org/\nHere's what it came up with for your code:\n``` coffeescript\n$(\"#chartContainer1\").insertFusionCharts\n  type: \"Column3D\"\n  width: \"600\"\n  height: \"300\"\n  dataFormat: \"json\"\n  dataSource:\n    chart:\n      caption: \"Monthly Sales Summary\"\n      subcaption: \"For the first half of 2013\"\n      xAxisName: \"Month\"\n      yAxisName: \"Sales\"\n      numberPrefix: \"$\"\n      bgcolor: \"ffffff\"\ndata: [\n  label: \"January\"\n  value: \"14400\"\n,\n  label: \"February\"\n  value: \"19600\"\n,\n  label: \"March\"\n  value: \"24000\"\n,\n  label: \"April\"\n  value: \"15700\"\n,\n  label: \"May\"\n  value: \"23700\"\n,\n  label: \"June\"\n  value: \"22800\"\n]\ntrendlines: [line: [\n  startValue: \"17100\"\n  displayValue: \"Last year's {br} average\"\n  valueOnRight: \"1\"\n  color: \"999999\"\n]]\n\n```\nThe only thing that jumps out at me is that instead of using the jquery selector to grab the widget by ID in the first line you can get it directly using @node. The graph widget does this: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/blob/master/templates/project/widgets/graph/graph.coffee#L10\n. Feel free to add a page to the wiki with this info in.\n. You can create a dashboard that is in essence one giant widget, inside of which you add/remove elements as necessary.\nAnother option is to use dashboard-level events (detailed in the API section of the docs) and build something that will add and remove widgets as @shaundon suggests above.\n. There's already support for different graph types on master, but it's not been released yet: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/blob/master/templates/project/widgets/graph/graph.coffee#L18\nI'd love to see the other changes in a PR though. the graph widget definitely needs some attention.\n. I just pushed v.1.3.0 to RubyGems, it locks rufus to 2.x.x until we can fix it for version 3.\n. Oops! I just merged a fix to restrict the gem to version 2.x.x. Bad timing on my part. Please rebase this PR so that it merges cleanly and I'll get it in.\n. This is probably a regression in the 1.3.0 release (I updated fontawesome). Can you try a vanilla 1.2.0 install and see if the problem persists?\n. Thanks for troubleshooting, I've meged @sangmank's fix and pushed to rubygems. Version 1.3.1 contains the fix, so run bundle update dashing to pull it down.\n. Thanks for the fix!\n. Is this using Dasing v1.3.1 or v1.3.0? The issue should be fixed in the former.\n. do a gem update dashing to update the global version of dashing. Creating new projects will then use the new version :+1:\n. Yep, 1.8.x doesn't support that hash syntax. Upgrade to 1.9.3 and you'll be golden\n. @pushmatrix Thanks for keeping Dashing going all this time, and congrats on building one of the most popular dashboard projects out there. You're awesome \ud83d\udc4d \n. I've been building a Dashing clone that uses React on the frontend for a while now: https://github.com/davefp/handsome\nIt's still a work in progress and doesn't have anything in the way of integrations yet, but if anyone is interested in helping out or using it they can get in touch with me!\n.

    "polymetis": "Well that is certainly a good reason. I do want to keep the app as simple as possible - was planing on using a Procfile actually - but didn't think about the job replication. I still think it will be an interesting thing for me to figure out and if/when I do I will report back with code.\nThanks for responding so fast. \n. Actually my blog is a rack-Jekyll-unicorn thing currently so I have some experience with that. :)\n. Okay I have figured out two way do doing this but both feel suboptimal. Before pushing forward I would like an opinion. \nThe way would be to spin up a jobs dyno that passes the send events to unicorn running dyno. But this mean we would have to run two dynos on Heroku and one would just being jobs. Good if you have several hundred jobs but I don't think this particular use case is really what this software was meant to do. \nThe other feels hackish. Basically if would create a lock file that counts so that it each job would be preceded with a check if the file exists and remove it after a number of passes.\nThis just feels like an odd solution to the problem and I would have to muck about with the each iterator. Beyond the fact that I would have to somehow set the number of unicorn workers as a variable in the config settings so that it knows many times to count.\nIf anyone feels like weighing in but this hack seems a bit more trouble than it's worth. \n. I am still working on this - been having an odd week - and I would just like to chime in.\n[while talking this out with my roommate I realized this may be a fools errand for certain obvious reasons. Going to have a think.]\nAlthough I agree that this is a bit overkill for the traffic handling the feature even for the use case I was thinking of is it as a screensaver/mobile dashboards. \nThis is still not a lot of connections to handle but if we have to handle updates without shutting down the server completely. Active connections will keep an active version of the app running until close and new connections can just get the updated app. \nMind you, this does not work on a heroku deploy but then again the app would work about the same in all other regards so I don't think it hurts. \n. Sorry meant to close this. This turned out to be a bit a foolish errand. Generally speaking if you ever got to the point that unicorn was needed it would be wiser to spin up a second dyno and split the the scheduler and jobs to that process. \nFun experiment though going to work on fancy widgets instead. \n.

Hey Fuzzy, \nI have managed to install dashing using the currently available MASTER.ZIP from this repo. If you need some assistance getting it up and running, and perhaps you might be interested in getting it \"auto start\" with your server... I can help you with that too!\nAs for it not running remotely...I can take a look over your config and help you out if you want??\nProb a REALLY stupid question (and im really sorry for asking)...but your are putting \":3030\" in your URL to view it remotely?? and can you ping the Ubuntu VM from where you are trying to view it from!?\nWhat does a telnet repsonse give?? And did you perhaps change the port number from 3030 OR do you have something else running on 3030??\nI have my dashboard setup in my lab, you can view it here: http://lab.martynkeigher.com:3030 \nSpeak to ya soon.\n. HHmm.... is your dash external facing? If so, whats the URL? I'll see if it can display data for me.\nIve never had issues viewing data on the dashboards like this. I have all browsers installed and check them all regularly. (Reason I have them all...I do website development/design) They're all patched and plugins updated, etc.. wondering why no data pulls through though!! Check your plugins for updates etc...\nI primarily use Firefox on Windows 8 (currently version: 21.0) and I have no issues.\nDo u have a server you could throw another VM on of Ubuntu Server and see if it happens again? \nAnother thing you could do, is temporarily disable the firewall on the Ubuntu desktop to see if that for whatever reason could be causing the issue here??? You would do this using the following command:\nsudo ufw disable\nTo re-enable it its:\nsudo ufw enable \n. +1. PUMA for the win! ;p \n. Hey all, \nThis can be closed. I fixed it. I forget to update a few things:\n\napt-get install ruby1.9.1 ruby1.9.1-dev rubygems1.9.1 irb1.9.1 ri1.9.1 rdoc1.9.1 build-essential libopenssl-ruby1.9.1 libssl-dev zlib1g-dev\napt-get update\napt-get upgrade\napt-get install nodejs\n\n& finally.....\n\ngem install bundle\n\nOnce I ran these..everything worked!\n. PushMatrix wrote: \"If you'd prefer, you can edit the dashing.rb file to allow passing these variables in.\"\nAny chance you could show us how that is done, as I would really find this useful on my dashboards.\nThanks.\n. You don't have to re-open this... but I wish I had have read this about 30 mins ago! :(  lol\n. Ah Gotchya!\nI figured the # would have something to with Ruby, but i wasn't 100%. I really appreciate the quick response to this! :)\nEDIT.... \nSo... this does and doesn't work. I replaced the #Citrix with my twitter account @martynkeigher, and although it does come back with tweets, it's not MY tweets, its just tweets that include @martynkeigher(where i'm mentioned)  in the tweet itself. What I am after is a 'tweet timeline' from a @ account, so that when my system generates alerts, (via a dedicated twitter account)... it shows on the HUD. \nI'm just just using my @martynkeigher to test the functionality at this point.\nAny thoughts??\n. http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/3.2.1/cheatsheet/\n. Hey,\nI also noticed that the images where also a little big for what I was needing, they really took up too much room (even in the background!), so I created my own background class in assets/stylesheets/application.scss and called this new class in my layout.erb file. Instead of icon-background. I also changed my top and opacity attributes.\n.icon-background2 {\nwidth: 100%!important;\nheight: 100%;\nposition: absolute;\nleft: 0;\ntop: -50px;\nopacity: 0.15;\nfont-size: 195px;\n}\n. OK...I 'think' I know where you are going with this one, so please correct me if I'm wrong! :)\nAre you trying to present tweets FROM the @HomeFinder1 timeline in your widget?\nIf so, I also had this problem.... It turns out that it's not really a problem at all. From the looks of it, @HomeFinder1 or #HomeFinder1 has to be in the body of tweet message, as opposed to it just coming from the account.\nI too was puzzled by this for a while, but as soon as i \"mentioned\" my @RMMAlerts account, using my @MartynKeigher account, the one test tweet showed up for my search_term = URI::encode('@RMMAlerts') search term.\nIf someone knows HOW to pull a TIMELINE into the widget, then please do share the knowledge, as I would love to know how! :)\n. First, grab a couple of extra bits...\napt-get install freetds-dev\ngem install tiny_tds\nThen edit your Gemfile nano Gemfile\nAdd: gem 'tiny_tds'  to your list of current gems, save Gemfile, then do bundle install\nCreate your rb file: nano jobs/mssql.rb\n```\nrequire 'tiny_tds'\nSCHEDULER.every '300s', :first_in => 0 do |job|\nclient = TinyTds::Client.new(:username => 'username', :password => 'password', :host => '192.168.1.1', :database => 'dbname', :port => '1433')\n rs = client.execute(\"SQL Query Goes here\")\n rs.each do |row| \n  send_event('test', {value: row['value'] })\n end\n client.close\n```\nLastly, add the job to your dashboard using the following code: (I'm using the Hotness widget in the following example!)\n<li data-row=\"1\" data-col=\"1\" data-sizex=\"1\" data-sizey=\"1\">\n          <div data-id=\"test\" data-view=\"Hotness\" data-title=\"Test Title\" data-moreinfo=\"\" data-cool=\"30\" data-warm=\"110\"></div>\n       </li>\n. Try running sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y upgrade first, and then try apt-get install -y freetds-dev again.\n. Here is a copy/paste of a working MSSQL job. Take and change it to fit your needs... \n```\nSCHEDULER.every '300s', :first_in => 0 do |job|\nclient = TinyTds::Client.new(:username => 'fred', :password => 'P@ssword', :host => '192.168.1.1', :database => 'abc', :port => '1433')\n rs = client.execute(\"SELECT count(*) as xyz FROM [abc].[dbo].[SR_Service]WHERE SR_Board_RecID = \\'36\\' AND Date_Closed IS null AND SR_Status_RecID != \\'475\\' \")\n rs.each do |row| \n  send_event('ev1', {value: row['xyz'] })\n end\n client.close\nend\n```\nThe data-id that @tylermauthe referes to above, in my scenario here is ev1, and that is what I would call in my dashbaord.erb file. The query itself returns a numerical value, so I have it displayed using the hotness widget.\nNote: I have the tiny_tds gem installed and referenced in my Gemfile to access the MSSQL DB.\nHope that helps you out a bit.\n. Hey maxfields, \nI'm going to assume (seen as i don't have any more info to go off) that you are running Dashing on Ubuntu and that your ruby gems are installed in the default location at /var/lib/gems/1.9.1/gems.\nTake a look at server.rb located in the /var/lib/gems/1.9.1/gems/thin-1.6.2/lib/thin folder and on line 60/61 you will see ...\nDEFAULT_MAXIMUM_CONNECTIONS            = 1024\nDEFAULT_MAXIMUM_PERSISTENT_CONNECTIONS = 100\nI believe those would be the values that you would need to change and don't forget to restart thin for changes to take effect.\nHope this helps or at least points you in the right direction! \nRegards, \nMartyn.\n. Hey @maxfields2000 ...\nDid this help you out??\n. Well here is my awful workaround to complete the switch to puma ...\nAs my ubuntu server is a VM, i just to go the console and kick off sudo bundle exec puma there and just let it run. (doesn't affect my putty sessions then!) Totally 'OLD SKOOL'! ;p haha\n. Yup! Go for it man! +1000\n. Hey Rolfie,  Here is what I did....\nAdd the following code block ABOVE the \"\" line at the top of your dashboard.erb file:\n$(function bringToTop() {\n  $('li').live('click', function(e){\n    var widget = $(this).find('.widget');\n    if(widget.data('url')){\n      var url = widget.data('link');\n      var win = window.open(url, '_blank');\n      win.focus();\n    }\n  });\n});\nNext, add a 'data-link' property to your a tile's dashboard.erb config with the desired URL you want to go to when you click your tile. Here's an example:\n```\n\n      <div data-id=\"mydata\" data-view=\"Hotness\" data-title=\"Data Title\" data-cool=\"20\" data-warm=\"1000\" data-link='http:\\\\www.google.com'></div>\n    </li>\n\n```\nWith this feature added, you can have diff tile's have different URL's attached.\nHope this helps, although I hope you had already figured it out by now! - Sorry the delayed response.\n. I also have this issue, however access to my dash is actually running through a NetScaler. I have content switching, virtual servers, responders, etc... all setup to get to it, and I'm pretty sure that's MY reason. Now,.. while you may (or may not) be running it through a NetScaler yourself, what other network devices are you running it through?? Do you have concept of rule based forwarding on them at all or is purely ip:port access, on the same VLAN?\nI'm just trying to think outside of the box here on this one.\n. Turns out (in my case at least) its a THIN thing. If i run it on Puma.. its works straight away, even through the NetScaler.\nMove it onto Puma (off 'thin') if you can.\n. I had this issue once before... Installing NodeJS on my Windows server helped me out massively!! \n. I wonder if you could do it by having the data-suffix BE the other number you need?? I haven't tried this, but it could be worded something like this (?):\ndiv data-id=\"agentcsatmonth\" data-view=\"Number\" data-title=\"agent CSAT MTD\" style=\"background-color: #B06B0B\" data-prefix=\"\"data-suffix=\"Agent Surveys:\" + \" \" + data-id=\"agentsurvey\" + \" \" + \"%\">\ni class=\"icon-thumbs-up icon-background\">\nI doubt the EXACT syntax i have used above will work, as its stated, but something along those lines should do the trick, or at least point you in the right direction.\nYou will also have play with the number.html file if you wanted the agentsurvey to be a slightly different size text or even on a different line.\nI'm looking to do the same thing, so if you make any progress...i'd be curious to what it is that does this! ;) \n(if i figure out how to do it before you post it.. I'll also post what i find out!)\nRegards, \nMartyn.\n. Hey @tclass, mind sharing with the rest of the class you did this?? ;p\nThanks.\n. Yah... I gave it a go (with my limited knowledge and extensive googling) and didn't get it to work! I definitely broke my dash a few times along the way too.\nI ended up re-installing dashing from the master branch and settled for the 3.2.1 icons. ;p \nI would still like to see the new icons as part of this project though! :) The spinning icons for sure would definitely be a great +1 . Would bring a little more \"life\" into the dash i think.\nSpeaking off adding things... I wonder if you could add sound, or blinking tiles?? - Are those things achievable with the current master?\n. Hey Tyler, \nThanks for the prompt reply, and thanks for the suggestion on the blinking tile. I'll give that a whirl in my lab soon for sure!! FYI: My use-case is a \"Server Offline\" tile. I run a query against a MySQL db, so if the value in the tile (a single number returned from the query) is NOT 0, then blink, just to draw extra attn. to it. - but as you stated, there are several use cases for this.\nAs for the FontAwesome update... I realize i might be asking a bit much, so if it's too much of a bother, then at least consider it a feature request for Dashing 2.0! :)\nWhich... by the way.. Whats the ETA on that?? \nThanks.\n. Sounds like a plan! ;)\nAre you still using Dashing on Thin at all?? Fwiw: I shifted over to Puma and got much better results! I had plans I move it to Raptor (new passenger build), but not tried that yet! \nI'm an enthuastic user too for sure and I've been making some decent dashboards for my managed services practice (& others), but my coding skills aren't at the same level as my thoughts... Yet! ;p\n. Hmm... I may have to check out that Puma fork to be honest. I do quite a bit of documentation so when i do new things, I get all it noted (i live in evernote!) I can go over and validate it, so every time i install Dashing (as i blow it up on \"purpose\" sometimes) I manually convert it to run on Puma.\nThe reason why I went to Puma was because it was running behind a (Citrix) NetScaler and while dashing ran on 'Thin' it took 50+ seconds for the tiles show data, :-1: and with Ruby it was around 3 or 4 seconds. :+1: \nI also ALWAYS add this great tweak to it to: https://gist.github.com/jwalton/6670630 , although i 'think' it affects my ability to drag the tiles, or maybe that's something else?\nMy only missing piece to the instructions, is getting Puma to run as a Daemon. Right now (As my ubuntu server is a vm) i have to go to the console and kick off sudo bundle exec puma there and just let it run. :( \n+1 on the 'Everyone is always learning' quote!! A day without a smile (and a lesson learned) is a day lost! :) \n/me is off to look for the Puma fork! ;p\nOh... one last thing, if you was to do a fork that included the newer version of FontAwesome, would it be  configured to run on Thin or Puma?? - Thanks.\n. Yeah, sorry @cefigueiredo for bringing this one slightly off topic. @tylermauthe and I kinda segway'd a bit! ;p  Thanks @howardsternisbatman for bringing right back on track!!\nHaving the full use of FontAwesome (even including the animated icons)... would be pretty spectacular!! \n. Nicely done @jmb! @tylermauthe ... would your PR be on PUMA too, by chance? ;p \n. Hey all, sorry for asking a dumb question here, but what the simplest way to merge this PR into my current project? Usually I just grab the master and then make my changes, but this is a big one that I'd rather not do manually! ;p\nI suppose I could DL it and 'WinSCP in' to copy/replace files, but i know there must be an easier way! Apologies if this sounds very \"GitHub 101'ish\", but i'd love to know how! \nThanks for your patience!\n. Yeah, I'll prob just copy/replace the files as I have pulled the master, then got it running on PUMA. I was concerned that if pulled the PR, it would overwrite all the PUMA stuff I have configured. I'll go ahead and copy/paste the files the old fashioned way in WinSCP! I just don't wanna break it all over again! \n(PS: VMWare snapshots are your friend!) ;p\nThanks for your quick response! :) \n. ha ha... as SOON AS I copied the LAST file (via WinSCP), you replied! ;p\n(About to test it out now!)\n. @jmb YOU ARE A LEGEND!! ;)\nI know you cant tell from this image: http://i.imgur.com/y1WQPyD.png but the cog is spinning too! \nThank you so much for putting this up!! Can't remember how many times I broke it trying to get this to work! You will notice that the \"spinning icon\" is outside of the tile... I can work around this by lowering the font size! \nThank you once again! :)\n. For what it's worth, I now have a Dashing project running on PUMA and also with the updated font. I'll figure out how to get this up to GitHub today! (But first.. I need coffee!)\nPS: I realize that the comments here are growing quite a bit.. To minimize the chatter in here, I am also on IRC (Freenode network. Name there is \"MartynKeigher\". Maybe chat to you on there??? \n. Hey, \nThe default implementation of this will make the icons \"rotate around a relevant point on the tile\", instead of \"spinning on their own axis\" (spin). So to tackle this 'issue' i did the following:\nAdded an additional class in the application.scss:\n.icon-background-spin {\n  width: 100%;\n  position: absolute;\n  left: 0;\n  top: 0;\n  opacity: 0.1;\n  font-size: 225px;\n  text-align: center;\n  margin-top: 55px;\n}\nThen in my layout.erb I called the new icon-background-spin for spinning icons and called  icon-background (as usual) for static icons.\nI also slowed the spinning down. Edit font-awesome.css on line 81 & 82 to the following:\n-webkit-animation: fa-spin 8s infinite linear;\nanimation: fa-spin 8s infinite linear;\nYou can also apply the same change to fa-pulse class on line 85 & 86, too.\nI would make a pull request if I knew how, so if someone wants to do this, then please... go right ahead.\nRegards, \n. I'm going to close this now as a PR was made. Hope it gets pulled into the MASTER branch soon. :)\nPR is here: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/pull/514\n. Pardon my ignorance here (probably a simple Q) but... has this been merged into the master yet? and if not.. whats the easiest way to implement it?\nI'm looking to re-install my dashing VM, and I remember there was \"a lot of find and replace\" to get this rolling! Is this still the case today, or has something more streamlined been introduced, since this happened in February? \nThanks.\n. Hey @filthyrake, \nI too am suffering from the same issue here! It's got to the point where the dash is now practically unusable on Thin, and flipping it over to Puma made it a 'little better' but not brilliant.\nIts as if all my MySQL queries (which i checked the thread count on the database I'm pulling the data from... was at 1014!!), and therefore.. dash load times are pretty bad! Sometimes upto 30 seconds...\nOne thing i have done from time to time is kill the log file, that grew to 12GB recently, that helped a little bit, but not enough. Seemed that the tiles loaded quicker, and their titles... but the data (being pulled through multiple job.rb file) still took a while to populate.\nDid you make any progress on this, or are you still experiencing slow page load times? \nThanks.\n://mk\n. Hey @pushmatrix and @tylermauthe!!\nWas wanting to know when the switch to PUMA is on the roadmap! This month, next month, Xmas? I'm loving dashing more and more, and as i add more and more... that need for puma is, well... ya know! ;p\nThat (swith to puma) along with FontAwesome 4.4 being put into the master branch are my 2 items for a HUGE +1! \nFWIW: Here is a step by step I did to switch to the current master (at the time of this post) to Puma... http://pastebin.com/6LvgBFmb (cc: @robacarp) \nKeep up the awesome work guys!!\n://mk\n. Hey buddy, \nHere is what I have for a meter widget...\njobs/lollipops.rb\n```\nrequire_relative 'my_db.rb'\nSCHEDULER.every '10m', :first_in => 0 do |job|\n    db = MyDb.conn\n\n    sql = \"SELECT `name` FROM `table` WHERE `column` = lollipops\"\n\n    results = db.query(sql)\n\n    current_lollipops = results.count\n\n\n    send_event('lollipops', { value: current_lollipops } )\n\ndb.close\nend\n```\ndashboards/home.erb\n<li data-row=\"1\" data-col=\"1\" data-sizex=\"1\" data-sizey=\"1\">\n      <div data-id=\"lollipops\" data-view=\"Meter\" data-title=\"Lollipops remaining\" data-min=\"0\" data-max=\"500\"></div>\n    </li>\nHope this helps you out! I don't use the graph, so hopefully someone else can share an example!?  \nSeen as your SQL will only return a number,take a look over at #321 to see how you can append your result with the \"%\" sign.\nFWIW.. My meter widget is not about lollipops! ;p (just using it as an example here!) and as for require_relative 'my_db.rb' check out this post: https://github.com/brianmario/mysql2/issues/474 \nRegards, \n://mk\n.

Hey, \nHere is a snippet of code in my RB (JOB file) I use, to do what it is that you're doing in your coffeescript file....\n```\ndb = MyDb.conn\n    sql = \"SELECT SUM(bandwidth) as 'sumb' FROM computers WHERE clientid = 1\"\n\n    result = db.query(sql).first\n    total = 0\n    total = result['sumb']\n    total = total / 1000000.00\n    total = total.round(2)\n\n```\nSimply put... I'm guessing you just need to change your .toFixed(2) to .round(2) ?\nHope this helps! \n://mk\n. Hey @R2Developer ... If this is fixed...can you mark this issue as closed, please?\nThanks.\n://mk\n. Hey @bombastic1.\nIs this still an issue? If so, let us know. if not... please mark this issue as CLOSED.\nThanks\n://mk\n. Hey Daniel! For sure man...

Give this a read... i've used it for a while now with awesome success!!\nhttps://github.com/QubitProducts/dashing-contrib/wiki/Widget:-Switcher \n. Can you please put your operating_system.rb file here please?\nTO add: I had sporadic issues with Dashing on windows using Ruby 2.3, I held it back to 2.2.6.. ",
    "kevinthompson": "@pushmatrix & @davefp - With Dashing's interface and application (potentially?) being separated, is there still a possibility that this issue will be addressed in this repo, or should the issue be closed?\n. Ultimately I believe the decision of how to falls to the Dashing maintainer(s). If a separate repo is used, pull requests will need to be reviewed and approved. If a wiki were to be used instead, content and links could easily become outdated, and would need to be maintained. The latter does lower the barrier for community contribution though.\nAlso, although it's slightly off topic for this thread, I do like what @davefp is proposing in regard to widget and/or job inclusion and generation. It would be very nice to simply include a few gems for the required components.\n. @bashtoni It sounds like your issues is solved, but I would recommend trying the Midori browser on Raspberry Pi instead of Chromium. Midori performs much better, and might actually be able to render the number animations without any issue.\nWe're running three Dashing dashboards on Raspberry Pi computers, each with a fair amount of animation, or frequently redrawn html (widgets with data-foreach), and we found that Midori (a webkit-based browser) outperformed Chromium on the RPi, specifically in regard to animation.\n. This has actually been a problem for us on our dashboards for a little while. As I mentioned in a previous comment, we're using the Midori browser running on Raspberry Pi computers using the Debian Wheezy distro. \nAfter some period of time, the browser stops synching with the Dashing application. Refreshing the browser re-establishes the connection, so it seems that some browsers are simply failing to reattach to the event stream when losing connection.\nI've been meaning to spend a little more time looking into this issue as well, but if nothing else, hopefully this information helps someone else dig into the issue.\n. @pokerfundr Are you still having trouble getting your Dashing dashboard running on Heroku? Any new errors, issues, or insights arrise?\n. :+1: \n. I'll look into raising the appropriate error when a template doesn't exist. I agree with you regarding the Haml dependency as well. Eventually there could be dependencies for any number of rendering engines, but the gem should never include them all.\n. Before building additional functionality on top of Dashing, such as the Haml support proposed in #49, I'd like to form tests surrounding the existing functionality in Dashing.\nTo do this, I've started by establishing a base framework for testing the CLI. This is the first time I've attempted to test a command-line interface, let alone one that generates additional files, so I welcome any questions, comments, or concerns.\nIf the basic structure here seems sound, I intend to write additional tests surrounding the CLI, then move onto testing dashboard behavior, before finally returning to feature development.\n. Has anyone had a chance to look this over? If I'm on the right track here I'd love to continue fleshing out tests. Thanks!\n. If you're going to be posting points into your dashboard, without modifying the graph widget, I believe you're going to need to pass all of your graph's points through curl as an array of hashes with \"x\" and \"y\" keys:\nbash\ncurl -d '{ \"auth_token\":\"YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN\", \"points\": [{ \"x\":\"1\", \"y\":\"9\" }, {\"x\":\"2\",\"y\":\"14\"}] }' http://localhost:3030/widgets/convergence\n. You're probably going to need to create a custom graph widget to display the data the way you'd like. The existing graph widget uses the Rickshaw JavaScript library and simply defines the width, height, and series of data:\ncoffeescript\n@graph = new Rickshaw.Graph(\n  element: @node\n  width: width\n  height: height\n  series: [\n    {\n    color: \"#fff\",\n    data: [{x:0, y:0}]\n    }\n  ]\n)\nRickshaw does support a number of additional options and extensions though, including an extension named Rickshaw.Graph.Axis.Time for adding x-axis time labels. View the source on their examples for more information.\n. @mattjerry - I'm not sure I understand what your last question was. Can you please rephrase? It sounds like you may just have one remaining issue with your labels.\n. Would it be possible for you to create a gist, or a public repo, of your dashboard project, with any sensitive information stripped out? It's difficult to discern the cause of this issue without more context.\n. I really like the idea of extending Dashing in this way. \nOne thing I had hoped to see in Dashing is the removal of any unrelated or ambiguous cruft that could trip up more novice developers, which in the case of your dashing-weather gem would be things like the references to Thor, but I'm not sure how much simpler a custom DSL would make things.\n:+1: \n. Is this still an issue? The AWS instance you linked to in your question appear to be offline.\n. @banafederico Could you add a few quick tests around your CLI.dash_separated method verify the functionality? Otherwise, @pushmatrix, this PR looks like it's ready to merge.\n. @MartynKeigher Did @pushmatrix's answer solve your problem? Can this issue be closed now?\n. Should this still be an open issue or has the original question been answered?\n. @brodo - Did @pushmatrix's answer resolve this for you? Are you still having trouble distributing your dashboard?\n. For anyone that is still having this issue, are any of you using a Ruby version manager (rvm, rbenv, chruby)? Can you verify that the version of ruby active within your project (ruby -v) matches the ruby versions you've posted previously.\n. I like all of the functionality suggested in this PR, but it seems like you might have two different distinct features here. One that converts jobs to independent classes that subclass Job, and another for the dashboard from config functionality.\nAll in all, :+1:.\n. In config.ru the default dashboard can be defined using set :default_dashboard, :sampletv. Can you see if a different default dashboard has been defined there?\n. Ok. I'm trying to reproduce the issue. What Ruby version are you currently using?\n\nI just created a new project and verified that there isn't a default dashboard defined in config.ru and I get 302'ed to /sampletv vs. /sample when I enter 0.0.0.0:3030 in Chrome (or FF).\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Hi Paul,\n\nCan you provide a more detailed example of what you are trying to accomplish? Are you trying to change the directory where dashboards are stored? The url they're resolved at?\nIf you just need to define config variables, you should be able to do so in your config.ru file:\n``` ruby\nrequire 'dashing'\nconfigure do\n  set :auth_token, 'dev'\n# Custom Config\n  set :my_var, 'foo'\nhelpers do\n    def protected!\n     # Put any authentication code you want in here.\n     # This method is run before accessing any resource.\n    end\n  end\nend\nmap Sinatra::Application.assets_prefix do\n  run Sinatra::Application.sprockets\nend\nrun Sinatra::Application\n```\nThen in your dashboards, the config variables should be accessible through settings.my_var. For more information see the Sinatra docs on settings here: http://www.sinatrarb.com/configuration.html\n. What sort of data do you need to load prior to loading the dashboard? Is it not possible to create a job to load this data periodically?\nIf you do need to load data on page load instead of periodically, I would use Sinatra's filters. Here's the default generated config.ru file with a few added lines that define a before filter:\n``` ruby\nrequire 'dashing'\nconfigure do\n  set :auth_token, 'YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN'\nhelpers do\n    def protected!\n     # Put any authentication code you want in here.\n     # This method is run before accessing any resource.\n    end\n  end\nend\nExecute some functionality before loading the \"sample\" dashboard\nbefore '/sample' do\n  # Fetch data...\nend\nmap Sinatra::Application.assets_prefix do\n  run Sinatra::Application.sprockets\nend\nrun Sinatra::Application\n```\n. +1 for haml support, but I believe you need to change more than just the dashboard rendering in order to get it working properly for any developer new to the project. For example, you should verify that a haml parser is available before attempting to parse a haml file.\nAlso, instead of a condition check, it would probably be best to have a way to register multiple parses, in the event other developers want to add support for additional rendering engines in the future.\n. I think requiring oauth credentials makes this job less valuable as part of the template. It may be best to move the twitter job outside of the project template, or the project entirely.\n. @hannesfostie Can you provide a bit more context; possibly a gist or a git repo? It would help to see your widget(s)' JavaScript and your Twitter job.\nWhile it's possible to pass variables such as username to your JavaScript in the way you've depicted, you would need your JavaScript to then make use of those variables to sort your content. In your CoffeeScript file you should be able to use @get('username') to fetch the username from your view configuration.\n. +1\n. I ran into the same problem running Chrome on a Raspberry Pi; Chrome doesn't seem to perform well on low resource devices. What you're observing is Chrome redrawing the HTML elements in the list.\nIn my case, I was able to switch to a different browser, but if that is not an option, you can try to customize the widget's JavaScript to be more performant. Instead of clearing the entire list and recreating each element, you can attempt to update the values inline, only adding or removing list items that are added or removed entirely from the source data.\n. I'm not sure it's a good idea to have the default template loading more gems than simply dashing.\n. You should be able to remove net/http and json since you're requiring twitter.\n. ",

Do you get some glues on your console? It looks like you could not start Sprockets or something has broken when the app started...\nBecause you are suposed to see an compiled application.js, besides the raw application.coffee and Sprockets are responsible for it..\n. And, it is known that some ruby gems has issues when running on Windows environment. So, I suggest you install and test your app on a *nix environment. \n. Great that you solved your problem! :D\nThe only relation I can see, is with the javascript engine, that when u install Node.js, you use its engine.\nSo just by installing node.js, you should use the coffee-script gem without problem, don't being necessary install it by npm. \nYou could try install only the gem therubyracer besides node.js, to remove third-party dependencies.\n. That repository has no compatibility with rails, and it's not because of batman itself. It's because it is a Sinatra's framework.\nYou should see dashing-rails\n. But besides the missunderstanding of @ravishi about rails. It would be really nice to upgrade batman and take advantage of batman-0.16.0 as well.\n. It's on ./assets/stylesheets/application.scss\ncss\n$background-color: #222;\n. \ud83d\udc4e for style tag\nIt's possible, but it sux. You will have a painfull life when decide change again and search EVERY erb file to update your styles...\nDashing.io uses a lot of SASS style on the .scss files but it's not mandatory. You can override it and write the CSS in a more verbose way, because it still understand it. \nSASS just add some structures to let you repeat less code, setting variables and letting you write css as partials (or snippets) to be imported in a biggest one to organize your code, and some other tricks to repeat less code when the behaviour repeat.\nYou should learn at least a bit of SASS. It is a nice reading and it will improve a lot your css skills.\nBut if you don't. No problem. As I said before, you can still write your css as you know SASS just add structures that will be translated to normal CSS after processed.\n. I'm not sure if you are talking about widget background or entire page background.\nFor entire page, you can add a class chosen by you on body tag, and style that on the scss, setting the background-color for that class like:\nhtml\n<body class='prettyBG'>\nscss\n// default setting\nbody {\n    background-color: $background-color;\n}\n//your setting\nbody.prettyBG { \n    background-color: $your-fancy-background-color;  //SASS syntax is not mandatory, i'm just lazy \n}\nFor a let the entire page background there, and change just the dashboard background (gridster) you can add a class into the div where you the dashboard are inside. Actually is a div where there are a class called gridster and make it as fancy you want :)\nhtml\n<div class='gridster prettyBG'>\nscss\n.prettyBG { \n    background-color: $your-fancy-background-color;  //SASS syntax is not mandatory, i'm just lazy \n}\nAs you can see, you can even let the original settings there, and just add yours. And you can have as  fancy classes you want, and you just need to control which will appear on your html (and that you do as you want as well... with javascript, ruby, raw html...)\n. I think that this issue must be closed!\nAnd the correct place for ask these kind of questions is Stackoverflow http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dashing\nMaybe someone had already the same problem and another have already answered.\nThe fact is, here is supposed to contain more subjects related with bug reports and proposals for changes. \nAnd to not be only a jerk, I can help you find the answer as well... You should check the configuration of your gridster component.\n``` javascript\n// assets/application.coffee\nDashing.on 'ready', ->\n  Dashing.widget_margins ||= [5, 5] \n  Dashing.widget_base_dimensions ||= [300, 360]  //here you set the minimum width/height of each widget as larger it is, larger is your page\n  Dashing.numColumns ||= 4  //here you set how many column you want..\n```\n. I don't know if I'm misunderstanding your question...\nBut Dashing is just a gem that plays inside a Sinatra framework and implements some widgets functionalities. But they are just html pieces, so they renders in the way you write them... So, nothing interdites you from code a form and put it inside a widget.\nThe question is... Does it make sense on a Dashboard? For me, a dashboard is like a page with informations you care most concentrated in a way to let you notice them easily.\nI prefer just have widgets to see information, but if you want input some data on interacting with a widget, you can... they are just html with some style and functionalities... \nSo, if you need some kind of interactivity on a widget, you can customise that just as you can code a normal Sinatra app.\nYou also said something like save an input as a file... To do that, you just need to make a Sinatra's POST route to submit the data for. Sinatra's routes\n. :+1: \n.

You need ensure that your firewall let event-stream MIME type pass, and that your firewall does not close the connection.\nDashing works based on Server Sent Events, so you need search discover how configure your firewall to let it pass freely.\n.

I dont see multi as a valid renderer...\n\ndata-renderer: Any valid Rickshaw renderer, including 'area', 'line', 'bar', 'scatterplot'.\n. Perhaps my sample might help:\ncurl -d '{ \"auth_token\": \"MY_TOKEN\", \"data-render\": \"area\", \"data-legend\":\"true\", \"title\": \"Graph Test\", \"data-color-scheme\":\"rainbow\", \"data-moreinfo\": \"sample graph\" , \"series\" : [  { \"name\" : \"Line1\", \"color\": \"red\", \"data\" :   [ { \"x\":1, \"y\": 11 }, { \"x\" :2, \"y\" :27}, { \"x\":3, \"y\": 6  } ] }, { \"name\" : \"Line2\", \"color\": \"blue\", \"data\" :  [ { \"x\":1, \"y\": 5  }, { \"x\" :2, \"y\" :2 }, { \"x\":3, \"y\": 25 } ] }, { \"name\" : \"Line3\", \"color\": \"green\", \"data\" : [ { \"x\":1, \"y\": 15 }, { \"x\" :2, \"y\" :12}, { \"x\":3, \"y\": 45 } ] } ] }' http://:3030/widgets/samplegraph\nNote that I often have to restart the webserver if I make big changes in the graph .. like type..perhaps caching causing issues?\n. You know .. i dont even see Pie as being a valid type..(using defaults/rickshaw).\nPerhaps you are using a different widget?\nhttps://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki/Additional-Widgets\n. Thats the one i was referencing but the methods are not the same .. and I am too new to ruby to come up with the equivalent.\n. I updated my code above.. getting closer.. any ruby coders out there can review/critque/suggest?\n. Had to close the cursor to stop the every increasing number of open cursors.\n. The code above is valid working code.\nAnother simple example:\nrequire 'oci8'\nconn = OCI8.new('someuser','password','myhostname:1527/MYSID');\n  sql = \"begin my_dashboard_lag_data(); end;\"\n  cursor = conn.exec(sql)\n  puts \"5min_refresh job executed\"\nconn.logoff\n. Couple of things. When running from the command line, outside of DASHING, you cant use SCHEDULER/do-end, so comment those out for testing.\nI wonder if its this line: when I changed it it seemed to work.\nconn = OCI8.new(apps,apps,\"192.168.56.102:1598/vis\");\u2028\nYou need single quotes around the userid (apps) and the password (apps)\nAlso try single quotes around the ip address instead of double quotes.\nI am a trial and error ruby programmer too :-)\n. Also you have the 2nd parameter (still) as a number .. i dont think lastname is likely to be a number :-)\ncursor.define(2, Integer)\u2028\n. iframe .. thats pretty cool. \nSee: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/issues/60\nedit your dashboard's erb file - add in your widget.\n<li data-row=\"1\" data-col=\"2\" data-sizex=\"2\" data-sizey=\"1\">\n      <div data-id=\"myiframe\" data-view=\"Iframe\"></div>\n    </li>\nThen populate it .. here it is via curl\ncurl -d '{ \"auth_token\": \"YOUR_TOKEN\", \"url\": \"http://helpdesk.eastquayit.net:8080/conn1.aspx\" }'  http://<yourhost>:3030/widgets/myiframe\nNow a full solution could be done via scraping the page like this widget:\nhttps://gist.github.com/petehamilton/5494590\nNot too difficult .. i can hack it out if the above doesnt suffice.\n. curl is a unix command that you can run whenever you want from the command line or via cron.\nIf you want to use the dashing jobs then place a file (call it iframe.rb) in the jobs directory. It should look like this. (Not a ruby expert but it works :-) )\nSCHEDULER.every '20m', :first_in => 0 do |job|\n    url = \"http://mywebaddressgoeshere\"\n    puts url\n    send_event('myiframe', url: url)\nend\nOf course you can change the 20m to 60s or whatever refresh interval you think is appropriate. \"myiframe\" has to match the  <div data-id=\"myiframe\" ... that you have in your dashboard erb file.\nIf this issue is done be sure to close it. Thanks.\n. I am confused there are only 2 pieces required and I put them in my comment above. Edit sample.erb add in the \n<li> .. </li>\nSave the file. (its not urgent that the position parameters are wrong .. dashing will by default place it wherever)\nCreate a new file in jobs directory .. call it iframe.rb,   put in the the lines above SCHEDULER... etc.\nNow restart Dashing.\nkill -9 <dashing pid>\nbundle exec dashing start -d -e production\nPS. You dont touch the widget files themselves at all.. just place it in a dashboard erb file and create a job to populate it.\n. I just installed your widget.. I changed your code slightly to correct the issue (or it appears to).\nYou need to divide by two the amount of space padding, so half goes to the top and half goes to the bottom. Likewise for the left and right space. (ie. / 2 was added to these two lines)\n```\n$(@node).find('.plum-image-position').css('top', (-(100 - (@height / @imgElem.height() * 100)) / 2) + '%')\n..\n$(@node).find('.plum-image-position').css('left', (-(100 - (@imgElem.width() / @width * 100)) / 2 ) + '%')\n```\nAlso your widget grows too big for the widget container .. so I arbitrarily removed 10px padding.\n@width = (Dashing.widget_base_dimensions[0] * container.data(\"sizex\")) + Dashing.widget_margins[0] * 2 * (container.data(\"sizex\") - 1) - 10\n. This works for me for the Rickshawgraph widget. Perhaps check your bracketing.

It allows you to graph multiple series etc.\n.

Can someone please point me in the right direction?\nThis project is amazing!\nThanks!\nTzvi\n\u2014Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Can you post your dashboard's .erb file? Obviously there are some fonts that are too large for your widgets. You can override these in the html. I like to use chrome and inspector to find and tweak these.\nYou can tweak things like this:\n```\n\n$(function() {\n  Dashing.widget_base_dimensions = [195, 175]\n  Dashing.widget_margins = [5, 5]\n  Dashing.numColumns = 6\n});\n\n\nbody {\n  font-size: 10px;\n}\n\n```\n. Confirmed .. this is a result of how the icon is being displayed. its setting the global icon-background value. So whichever one gets called first, it sets the style for the entire webpage. Hence the same icon is displayed for each widget. Best to post this bug on the widget github page and hopefully they can code around this issue. Unfortunately that element is not data driven but stylesheet driven.\n<i class=\"climacon icon-background sun\"></i>\nIf you wanted to .. you could copy the weather widget multiple times.. call it weather1, weather2 etc..\nthen change that class to be climacon1,, ..2, ..3 etc.\n(similar change to weather.coffee)\nNote that each widget has to have like named directory and files .. so weather1/weather1.coffee etc.\n. The klimato widget works fine with multiple cities.\n```\n    \n\n\n<li data-row=\"1\" data-col=\"5\" data-sizex=\"1\" data-sizey=\"1\">\n  <div data-id=\"klimato2\" data-view=\"Klimato\"></div>\n</li>\n\n```\nThen have multiple jobs .. send one to kilimato and the other to klimato2 for example.\n. What do you mean by large? You can tailor any part of it by adding the css code in your .erb dashboard file.\nFor example: Add this prior to the <% content_for code..\n```\n\n\n.widget-klimato h1 {\n  font-size: 20px;\n}\n\n.widget-klimato h2 {\n  font-size: 20px;\n}\n\n.widget-klimato h3 {\n  font-size: 20px;\n}\n\n.widget-klimato .updated-at {\n  font-size: 6px;\n}\n\n```\n. Someone mentioned this in a prior issue that it could be related to max threads.\nTry --max-persistent-conns and --max-conns as outlined on \nhttp://macournoyer.wordpress.com/2008/02/24/staying-alive-with-thin/\n. I am .. and have a working example. Be sure you have refreshed your browser and not grabing the html from cache.\n<div data-id=\"g1\" data-view=\"Rickshawgraph\" data-color-scheme=\"near-rainbow\" data-stroke=\"true\" data-legend=\"true\" data-renderer=\"area\" data-title=\"Graph\"></div>\nOh wait thats a Rickshaw example ..\n. I am not certain highcharts has legends defined. I see coffee entries saying legend: enabled: false\n. Why not echo \"\" > thin.log via cron. Wont that work? You dont want to simple delete it since Unix will often hold the file handle open.\n. That is perfect. Thanks.\n. Nope .. could never figure it out.\n. ",

    "florian-bayer": "We have the same problem with our dashboard. After a while all widgets do not update anymore, which is also visible in the updatedAtMessage. After a refresh of the page everything is up to date again.\n. I use Google Chrome on Mac locally and we have a TVPeCee Android Strick running with Firefox (actually we wanted an Ricomagic MK802 but that wasn't available at that time). And both stop updating after a while.\nIn the Chrome Console I can see the following:\nat the very beginning there is\nPort error: Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist. miscellaneous_bindings:235\n    chromeHidden.Port.dispatchOnDisconnect\nAnd after something like every 1 to 5 minute there is this message:\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'filter' of undefined\n    (anonymous function)\n    stackData\n    render\n    Dashing.Graph.Graph.onData\n    (anonymous function)\n    Dashing.Widget.Widget.receiveData\n    (anonymous function)\n    (anonymous function)\nConnection error\nConnection opened\nBut at this point the widgets are still updating for one or more hours.\n. Thats sounds good! We will try that as soon as possible on our dashboard.\n. I just tested out dashboard in different browsers again (without the animate fix).\nIn Chrome its running fine all day long, but in Firefox in stops updating after a while. So it might be a Firefox bug? It would explain why it is freezing on our Android TVPeCee Stick. There we use Firefox as well to display the dashboard (because it looks like it is the only browser on Android which is able to show real fullscreen).\nBy the way, the TVPeCee Stick itself was running well, it was booting fast and didn't crash itself. But it just gives you 720p output, not as supposed 1080p, but it scales very good on a full HD Monitor so that itsn't that big problem.\n. we don't have a meter on our dashboard and it is stopping as well, we have Numbers and Graphs and little own variations of those\n.

Since then, I did upgrade to 1.3.1.  Is there possibility that something about 1.3.1 causes this edit in application.coffee to be ignored/not understood?  Perhaps the 'if' condition never executes because navigator.userAgent is no longer able to detect that I am on an iPhone?\n. I was able to resolve my issue my installing Dashing 1.3.2 and creating a new project, then slowly moving over my customizations.\n. @kayaj - Did you get the sound to play?  If you could send me a sample from your .rb for the playing of sound (mp3), that would be great.\n. Thanks. And agreed: these guys have been really helpful - our dashboards are now not only on 4 TVs in our lobby but also in our Sales, Product, and Operations aisles.  Looking to take them to the next level with audible alerts. :)\n. For me, this does not work in Safari either.  Did you find a resolution for this?\n. Thanks Dave -- Using that as an example, I modified my number.coffee to look like this ...\nonData: (data) ->\n    if data.status\n      $(@get('node')).addClass(\"status-#{data.status}\")\nif data.background-color\n  # clear existing \"background-color-*\" classes\n  $(@get('node')).attr 'background-color', (i,c) ->\n    c.replace /\\bbackground-color-\\S+/g, ''\n  # add new class\n  $(@get('node')).addClass \"background-color-#{data.background-color}\"\n... but then this command still did not change the background color:\ncurl -d '{\"auth_token\": \"YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN\", \"background-color\": \"#000\" }' \\http://localhost:3030//widgets/tvLRnumberFF\nBut it does still change values:\ncurl -d '{\"auth_token\": \"YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN\", \"current\": \"50\" }' \\http://localhost:3030//widgets/tvLRnumberFF\nAny other suggestions as to where I might be going wrong?\n. Still no luck. My number.coffee file now looks like this ...\nclass Dashing.Number extends Dashing.Widget\n@accessor 'difference', ->\n    if @get('last')\n      last = parseInt(@get('last'))\n      current = parseInt(@get('current'))\n      if last != 0\n        diff = Math.abs(Math.round((current - last) / last * 100))\n        \"#{diff}%\"\n    else\n      \"\"\n@accessor 'arrow', ->\n    if @get('last')\n      if parseInt(@get('current')) > parseInt(@get('last')) then 'icon-arrow-up' else 'icon-arrow-down'\nonData: (data) ->\n    if data.status\n      $(@get('node')).addClass(\"status-#{data.status}\")\nif data['background-color']\n  $(@get('node')).css 'background-color', data['background-color']\n. This does not 100% answer my previous question but I was able to get background color to change using the information in this article -- https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/issues/24 -- my follow-up question, though, is: After setting status to Warning, how do I reset the status back to ok (pass ok has no effect - only warning and danger cause a change)?\n. Update: Actually warning or danger will cause a change, but then it is stuck.  If I use danger first then I cannot later apply warning (no effect/ignored) and vice versa.  Hoping someone has some advice.\n. I 'still' have the same issue whereby the status can only be changed one-time.  It changes to the desired background color but then it never changes back.  Any idea what I might be missing?\n. @thenayr - I am going to be using Leap Motion at our company soon.  If you have any advice, please let me know. :)\n. Ditto!\n. Perfect. This works, thanks!\n.

Only meter and number widgets have the freezing problem, the others update reliably even when we leave the dashboard running for several days.\n. I checked the behavior described by @Dbzman by POSTing to a meter widget on a new dashboard generated by dashing 1.2.0.\nTest 1:\ncurl -d '{ \"auth_token\": \"YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN\", \"value\": \"3\" }' http://localhost:3030/widgets/my_meter_widget\ncurl -d '{ \"auth_token\": \"YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN\", \"value\": \"3\" }' http://localhost:3030/widgets/my_meter_widget\ncurl -d '{ \"auth_token\": \"YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN\", \"value\": \"4\" }' http://localhost:3030/widgets/my_meter_widget\nResults:\nWidget correctly updated to show \"3\", but not \"4\".

Unfortunately it doesn't seem to work for updates over http.\nThe right solution is for the widget to either reject strings (with an appropriate error message), or handle them properly. Since these are normally numbers-only widgets, the only case I can think of for wanting to handle strings is for when a value is not available, in which case displaying \"n/a\" or \"unknown\" makes more sense than -1.\n.

Yep, thats exactly the same problem I'v struggled with for so many hours. You are trying to use gems from Ruby 1.9.3 but using ruby 1.8.7 to execute them. The reason it is working when you are logged in is that you are in an interactive shell which means the PATH environment variable gets exported correctly (with Ruby 1.9.3) in one of the initializiation files (.bashrc, etc...)\nI've solved the problem by specifing the the correct Ruby version in the PATH variable above GEM_HOME in the script:\nbash\nexport PATH=/opt/chef/embedded/bin:$PATH\nIf you're not sure where to find your currect ruby installation try \"which ruby\" when logged in with your account.\nHope that helps. :)\n.

This is because the lastEvents updatedAt value for the widget ID is the same as the incoming data's updatedAt value,  until the data is updated \u2013 which in cases where this may be hours results in blank widgets.\nThis is because in dashing.coffee in the source.addEventListener method for 'message', the lastEvents for the id is set EVEN when the widgets[data.id] is not found.  Subsequent EventSource messages will find that the lastEvents for the id and the incoming data both have the same updatedDate value, thereby short-circuiting a call to widget.receiveData UNTIL the incoming EventSource data's updatedAt value is updated by a scheduled event on the server side.  This is a problem for scheduled jobs which are not executed often.  \nIf this code in dashing.coffee is changed as follows, the widgets will refresh on the next GET Events fired from the EventSource/SSE cycle in chrome so blank widgets are only a transient occurrence.\nsource.addEventListener 'message', (e) =>\n  data = JSON.parse(e.data)\n  if lastEvents[data.id]?.updatedAt != data.updatedAt\n      if Dashing.debugMode\n        console.log(\"Received data for #{data.id}\", data)\n      console.log(\"onMessage event widget for id #{data.id} is #{widgets[data.id]}\")\n      if widgets[data.id]?.length > 0\n        lastEvents[data.id] = data #Move into the if widgets block to assure widget and lastEvents are in synch\n        for widget in widgets[data.id]\n          widget.receiveData(data)\nThe case where Dashing.widgets has loses references to the ids for the page on refresh can be observed in Chrome and in Firefox (but not in Safari), but only occurs occasionally and only on some machines and not others (with the same versions of the browsers and plugins/extensions removed or disabled).\n. @pushmatrix, would you please take a quick look of this pull request?\n. @pushmatrix or @dylanahsmith, would you please take a look of this pull request when you get a chance?

If you are passing true integer values the animated numbers work as they should. \nFor example:\nI'm using HTTParty's GET function to grab the values from a server:\n```\nresponse = HTTParty.get('URL')\ntemp = JSON.parse(response.body)[0]\nsend_event('temp', { value: temp.to_i })\n```\nThe [0] piece is very important. It's tells the parse to pull the actual value out of the response instead of the response string [\"70\"]\nJSON.parse(response.body)[0] ==> 70  (as a string, still need to convert to int)\nJSON.parse(response.body) ==> [\"70\"]  (as a string with markup, can't convert to int)\nI know that last part is off topic, but it took me a bit to figure out (ruby noob) and I wanted to share.\n.

    "thoughtcroft": "I know this is an old issue but I used the onclick= method and that works fine except not on an iOS device. Anyone work out the fix required for that?\n. ",
    "DeanCording": "One problem with this solution is that moving the widget triggers the onclick call, making it impossible to re-arrange the dashboard.\nSee #651 for a solution\n. The problem is that widgets can only be 0-5 columns wide, irrespective of the dashboard width.  If you specify more than 5 columns wide for a widget it fills the entire dashboard width.  I encountered this issue with a dashboard I am developing.  To maximise the use of screen space, I have set the column width to 50px, with most widgets being 4 or 5 columns wide.  The problem occurs when I have a larger widget that takes up 10 columns, it fills the entire dashboard width.\nI can confirm that the proposed fix solves this problem.\n. Dashing.AnimatedValue has a bug which causes it to lock up if the old and new values are the same.  See #672 \n. Use a Batman filter.  The Batman fixed filter hasn't been implemented in Dashing but it is easy to do.\nIn application.coffee, add the filter at the end:\nBatman.Filters.fixed = (num, f) ->\n  return parseFloat(num).toFixed(f)\nThen include the filter in your widget html .  For example,\n<h2 class=\"value\" data-bind=\"current | fixed 2\"></h2>\n. The solution I have used to prevent this is to add a drag handle to the widget.\nIn the dashboard file, add a <header> for every widget, for example:\n<li data-row=\"1\" data-col=\"1\" data-sizex=\"1\" data-sizey=\"1\">\n    <header class=\"fa fa-arrows drag-handle\"></header>\n    <div data-id=\"time\" data-view=\"Clock\"></div>\n</li>\nWe just need to tell gridster about the handle, using handle: 'header' in assets/javascript/application.coffee:\nBatman.setImmediate ->\n    $('.gridster').width(contentWidth)\n    $('.gridster ul:first').gridster\n      max_size_x: Dashing.numColumns\n      widget_margins: Dashing.widget_margins\n      widget_base_dimensions: Dashing.widget_base_dimensions\n      avoid_overlapped_widgets: !Dashing.customGridsterLayout\n      draggable:\n        stop: Dashing.showGridsterInstructions\n        start: -> Dashing.currentWidgetPositions = Dashing.getWidgetPositions()\n        handle: 'header'\nNow for some CSS magic to make the handle appear and disappear on mouse over.  In assets/stylesheets/application.scss add:\n```\n.drag-handle {\n  position: absolute;\n  right: 5px;\n  top: 5px;\n  z-index: 99;\n  opacity: 0;\n}\n.drag-handle:hover {\n  opacity: 1;\n}\n```\nThe end result is that a drag handle will appear when you mouse over the top right corner of a widget.  Clicking on the drag handle will allow you to move the widget.  Clicking or dragging anywhere else on the widget is just a normal click or drag event for the widget. \n. This is still an issue. #310 doesn't appear to fix the problems when using Edge.\n. Actually, this is a coffee related problem.\nThe offending line in dashing.coffee is:\nunless @[timer] || num == to\nwhich looks fine, except it gets translated to:\nif (!(this[timer] || num === to)) {\nwhich is a bit different.  The work around may be to change the animation loop termination test from:\nif (up && num > to) || (!up && num < to)\nwhich fails if num = to, to \nif (up && num >= to) || (!up && num <= to)\n. PR created.\n. Same change as proposed in #618 \n. ",
    "phylor": "@thoughtcroft Dashing uses gridster to move widgets around. There is an open issue for click events on iOS devices over at gridster.\nThe temporary fix is to use pushmatrix's solution and to additionally register for touchend events. The click event works on most devices and the touchend event on iOS.\nI'm successfully using following code to achieve the same behavior on desktops and iOS:\n```\n\n  function openUrl(obj) {\n    var widget = $(obj).find('.widget');\n    var url = widget.data('url');\n    window.open(url, '_blank');\n  }</p>\n<p>$(function() {\n   $('li').live('click', function(e){\n    openUrl(this);\n  });\n  $('li').live('touchend', function(e){\n    openUrl(this);\n  });\n});\n\n```\n.

    "tylermauthe": "Please direct support requests to Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dashing\n. Not sure how I feel about this... Seems to go against the spirit of Dashing... Why not just pay for Ducksboard or some other point-and-click thing.\n. We hope to move Dashing to Puma from Rack, there is an open and almost completed PR for this: #427 \n. The change in #427 with -jruby is one of the reasons that PR cannot be accepted. The other changes should be fine, except they break the unit tests.\n. This PR can be closed as it is superseded by #427 -- hopefully that one is merged soon.\n. @pushmatrix and I are taking a look at the memory leak in the next little while. Memory leak aside...\nThis issue is ancient, so it deserves a worthy response! Seems like a two part question to me, with both parts relating to the operation of Dashing's Server Sent Event (SSE).\nThe first is a question that has been asked several times since this issue too: #387 #415 #582. The pages are hanging because each tab requires a persistent connection (SSE).\nA little known fact about browsers is that you can only have a certain amount of connections open to the same host name at the same time. No matter what kind of connection! Firefox has a max of 6 (source: http://browserscope2.org/?category=network&v=top).\nYou can test this out yourself by creating a little web application that just does while(true);. Then make a bunch of AJAX (more than 6...) calls in a loop and watch the other calls sit in pending as the first 6 spin indefinitely. An SSE is effectively a while(true);-type persistent AJAX connection disguised by the EventSource object. That being said, this same problem exists for Web Sockets. Heck, the same problem exists even for the most versatile long-polling mechanism in existence: the Gif Socket.\nThere are workarounds:\n- Traditional AJAX polling ($.getJSON().done(pollAgain)) masks this problem because each connection eventually gets it's turn in the queue after stalling for a period ... this may involve increasing the AJAX timeout values. :godmode: \n- \"Domain Sharding\" - create a bunch of phony subdomains that all point to the same server (dashing1, dashing2, dashing3[.yourdomain.com]) ... This tricks the browser into allowing 6 connections per shard.\n- \"Domain Sharding\" redux - use nginx or haproxy + virtual hosts as a front-end to each shard (could be the same box or multiple)\n- Have multiple servers with different hostnames, split up your dashboards among them (max of 6 simultaneous per host)\nThe second issue cited is heavy data usage. This has also been asked in #439 - possibly others. Admittedly, Dashing is a bit of a heavyweight if you have several dashboards with lots of data-intensive widgets. This is because all events for all widgets on all dashboards are sent in the same HTTP endpoint (the endpoint that you pointed out - /events). This allows Dashing to start receiving data immediately, without having to parse the DOM before polling the SSE.\nIt should be possible to wait for the DOM to load, parse it and determine what data the current dashboard cares about and then selectively request the appropriate data from the SSE. This doesn't really fit in the 80% use case for Dashing though, so such a change should live as a Gem to extend dashing.\n. Do people want this? Not sure I see the value in it... It is kind of nice -- would be cool if this could be an extension somehow... #pipedream.\n. Yeah, Masonry is not free for commercial use. I'd recommend closing this issue.\n. Is this still the idea for Dashing 2.0? :+1: \n. I think there are Additional Widgets that support this use case.\nI like that the default widget is simple.\n. Seems sensible, no breaking changes and consistency FTW. :+1: to merge this.\n. As @gordhawkins has pointed out, this change seems to be a breaking change and as such should wait for the next major release to be merged.\nThe migration path is pretty clear though, simply replace .start_new with .new in all jobs. Perhaps the change is small enough to be merged? Thoughts?\n. I like this PR and the approach taken. Many people don't know how to use the auth token and this leaves their Dashing instances vulnerable to exploits. This PR would make them secure by default (random token).\nI do however prefer @kmayer's syntax but no need to open a block: ENV.fetch('AUTH_TOKEN', SecureRandom.uuid). This is definitely a matter of personal preference though, as ENV['UNKOWN_KEY'] || true will return true just as surely as ENV.fetch('UNKOWN_KEY',true) will.\nThat being said, @pseudomuto brings up a good point: that this would be a (small, but) breaking change. Not sure how to resolve that.\n. Not sure if this is still required, I believe favicons work.\n. I've seen a few PR's that are very similar.\nPerhaps data-status should be moved up the chain, so all widgets support it.\n. This is a cool idea, though it might be nicer to simply persist the history whenever send_event is triggered -- debounced so that it is only written once every minute or so. Somewhere in here maybe: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/blob/439182f3b91c6c3c0cb5b5c8f5bee2562cfff2d4/lib/dashing/app.rb#L133-L139\nThis depends on how expensive it is to write the history to disk...\n. Yes please! :+1: \n. Please close, superseded by #292.\n. Seems like a sensible change, except for the edge case I bring up in the note above.\n. I am using a 2-way ProxyPass directive inside a vhost to proxy my thin process through Apache.\nThis lets me serve multiple hostnames by adding more vhosts for each DNS entry. I can also run Hudson and Dashing on the same box, each with a different vhost / hostname.\nHere is the relevant docs for this: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/vhosts/examples.html#proxy\n. This is a desirable feature, I've seen many support requests for this. Not sure how much I like the name subdir, but otherwise I think this should be merged.\n. This is nice -- error handling ftw. :+1: to merge.\n. Moved to here:\nhttps://github.com/SmashingDashboard/smashing/pull/27. Seems like a great change, the graph is misleading without it.\n:+1: to merge.\n. Either this or #322 should be merged. This PR seems to be more comprehensive and well-tested.\nWill have to look at this in greater detail to decide which is better.\n. I would prefer if this were implemented as a widget. However, there are no breaking changes so it could be merged if people think this is desirable.\n. @davejohnston - You can trigger a refresh from the job by running this send_even:\nruby\nsend_event('refresh_sample', {event: 'reload', dashboard: 'sample'}, 'dashboards')\nReplace refresh_sample with whatever you want to call the event, some descriptive name. Replace dashboard: 'sample' with the name of the dashboard you wish to refresh.\n<rant>\nIn general, my suggestion to solve this problem is to create a single widget that scales to the number of data sources you wish to display from multiple jobs and looks like individual widgets. This solution will fit nicely into Dashing.\nDynamically generating the HTML for the Dashboards is another option if you do not want to create your own widget, but it will instead require you to build a backend for dynamically generating the content of the Dashboard ERB files.\nDoing this in a sane way is outside the scope of Dashing IMHO, but could be written as a Sinatra Extension packaged as a Gem that extends your ability to define the view model used for each Dashboard or adds some view helpers for data synchronisation and iteration.\n</endrant>\n. Have you tried @jwalton's Rickshaw Graph widget? It enhances the stock widget with more features.\nIf that doesn't do it for you, the next thing to try is modifying Graph.coffee. The widget is based on Rickshaw, you can find documentation for that here: http://code.shutterstock.com/rickshaw/\nIt has a number of options for Axes and Tick Marks. The Graph widget included in Dashing is generic enough to suit most use cases, but certainly not all. I don't think we want to increase the complexity of this widget, but I'm open to debate on that point.\nAnyone else have any thoughts about whether Dashing should include more customisation capabilities for the stock Graph widget?\n. Based on @rafaelescrich's comment, can someone confirm if this PR works in IE and if so, what versions?\nOtherwise, no breaking changes and this seems like a desirable feature. Even if IE is lame.\n. Just found #310 -- seems like that PR is a better candidate as it includes these fixes as well as other changes.\n. Dashing is a Sinatra app under the hood, you can access an item in the params hash like params[:item].\nYou can also define a custom route, so that you can parse params out of the URL. Alternatively, you could use querystring variables, which will automatically be placed into the params hash.\n. Please close this issue.\n. This PR seems to try to load history from Redis but I don't see where it is saving the history to Redis.\nYou'll probably want to add some code to do this around in this block:\nhttps://github.com/Shopify/dashing/blob/937fcce2dcca8010dbe8e9e26df954cb1330c1e0/lib/dashing/app.rb#L56-L58\n. Are there specific widgets that hang? I think you'd have to deal with this on a widget-by-widget basis, as they all work differently.\nThere are some animations in application.scss that you could disable, but I doubt those are slowing you down. CSS is usually blazing fast...\n. This change is also in #333 -- this PR should be closed as it is superseded by #332.\n. You've also added data-binds for height and width.\nDoesn't seem like there are breaking changes and adds new functionality. Seems like this should be merged.\nAgain, this is a batman change -- so it will be nuked when batman.js is replaced.\n. What is the data-id of your widget?

Please close this issue.\n. Duplicates #339\nShould be fixed by #420 \nPlease close this issue.\n. Please close this issue.\n. This is a default of Gridster, not Dashing. However, Dashing should provide a mechanism for overriding these configuration parameters.\n420 should allow this specific functionality.\n. Are there other jobs interacting with the widget? This shouldn't happen.\n. Please close this issue.\n. Can you install any gems? Seems like your ruby environment is not correctly configured.\n. Please close this issue.\n. Are there any breaking changes in this update? Or in the update to 0.5.6?\n. Please close this issue.\n. It looks like you're doing everything correctly, I suspect the widget you've created has some issues. Perhaps this may be of use: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki/How-To:-Debug-incoming-widget-data\nPlease close this issue.\n. This is way outside of the scope of what Dashing does and should do (IMHO)...\nThis seems like a job for Graphite or similar. Also, why MongoDB?\nThat being said, that's approximately where I'd add such functionality -- though I'd probably break it out into a persist_event_to_db method.\n. There are a number of options in this list: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki/Additional-Widgets#other-third-party-tools\nPlease close this issue.\n. I agree. It seems that using Omniauth State requires you to implement a CSRF mechanism:\nhttps://github.com/zquestz/omniauth-google-oauth2#omniauth-state\n. Heroku free dynos will spin down if not in use and are generally unreliable. It looks like OpenShift doesn't idle as frequently: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23795884/how-long-with-no-traffic-before-an-openshift-gear-goes-idle\nYou may have better luck with some gears... Alternatively, you could run it locally. It doesn't need much processing power, a Raspberry Pi would be lots.\nPlease close this issue if it is solved.\n. Please close this issue.\n. You can run a copy of Dashing locally and test your updates like that... I guess I'm not sure what you're asking. I would urge you to develop and test this as web application.\nTo answer your question, you need to require 'dashing'. However, this won't actually do anything as send_event won't update anything anywhere.\nOne solution that may fit your use case is to use an if-statement to branch the code near send_event, something like:\nruby\neventData = { current: current, value: current, points: points }\nif(runFromCommandLine) {\n  p eventData\n} else {\n  send_event 'incoming_target', eventData\n}\nYou can tell if it's being run from the command line with something like this:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/8990790/run-code-only-if-script-called-from-the-command-line\n. You have a couple syntax errors, you need to add two end's after the client.close.\nIn Ruby, when you say \"do |x, y, z|\" you are beginning a block (kind of like an anonymous function / lambda). You must close it by saying \"end\".\nSo:\n``` ruby\n!/bin/env ruby\nencoding: utf-8\nrequire 'tiny_tds'\nSCHEDULER.every '300s', :first_in => 0 do |job|\n  client = TinyTds::Client.new(:username => 'MYUSER', :password => 'MYPASSWORD', :host => 'MYHOST', :database => 'MYDB', :port => '1433')\n  rows = client.execute(\"SELECT Caption, IP_Address, Description, Vendor, StatusLED, StatusDescription, LastSync, LastSystemUpTimePollUtc\n    FROM [MYDB].[Nodes]\n    WHERE StatusLED LIKE '%down%'\n    ORDER BY LastSystemUpTimePollUtc, Caption;\")\n  rows.each do |row|\n    send_event('list', {value: row['value'] })\n    client.close\n  end\nend\n```\nYou might also find this interesting: https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide\n. The first parameter in your send_event call defines the data-id that will receive the event. This must correspond to the data-id value specified in your dashboard.erb file.\n. It doesn't look like send_event is escaping anything... Perhaps on the batman.js side of things?\nIs the data coming out of /events correctly or is it escaped?\nIf you've solved this, please post your solution and close the ticket. Thanks!\n. Please close this issue.\n. application.coffee defines the front-end code, so it is only turning on debugging in the browser. It has no effect on the Rufus jobs.\nWhat is the error that Eclipse throws?\n. Please close this issue.\n. Please close this issue.\n. The changes can be viewed here: http://juhamust.github.io/dashing/\nOverall, I like these changes. My only gripe is with the Widgets section that was added to the bottom of #data -- I've made a note in the source code.\nMy suggestion is:\n- Add a page which lists the widgets in detail, or perhaps create demos of them in the demo app\n- Remove the <ul> -- it looks unfinished to me as it is\n- Link to the page that lists each widget with details instead\n. You have installed font-awesome-rails.\nThis is not a Rails application.\nYou want font-awesome-sass.\nFollow the instructions here: https://github.com/FortAwesome/font-awesome-sass\nIn particular, do not forget to do this in your application.scss:\nsass\n@import \"font-awesome-sprockets\";\n@import \"font-awesome\";\n. I don't see how WebSockets would overcome this, as you would still have a WebSocket per tab.\nYou can solve this by Domain Sharding, which is a technique of adding bogus DNS entries that all point to the same host.\ndashing-1\ndashing-2\ndashing-3\nThis tricks the browser into allowing the connections, because the hostname is different for each.\n. Fork the Number widget and modify the fork to support these features.\n. Please close this issue.\n. Do you get errors in your browser's console? Sounds like Highbar is failing to load.\n. Please close this issue.\n. Add a data-bgcolor property on the widget in your Dashboad .erb file. This enables you to specify different colours for individual widgets.\n. This URL is now protected. I suspect you have solved your issue.\nPlease close this.\n. This is not true for standard Dashing widgets. Perhaps it was true for a dark period of time when Chrome had a ridiculously terrible bug.\nIf this is still happening for the Rickshawgraph widget (although I am dubious of this), you should submit a request for support here: https://gist.github.com/jwalton/6614023\n. This is a good idea. We can definitely grab the local timezone from the user's browser.\n. https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki/How-To:-Change-the-default-dashboard\nBad support request is bad...\n. Have you created any jobs?\nAs you can see in Dashing.coffee, the onData method is called whenever receiveData is called on a widget. receiveData is triggered whenever a message is received from the EventSource. If /events is not returning any data, your widgets won't get any data and the onData function will not trigger.\n. Please close this issue.\n. Makes sense to me, this would be a non-breaking change as triggering it would require events to be sent with a status field. :+1: for merging.\n. As I mentioned in #255 -- perhaps this should be moved up the chain to Dashing.Widget so that all widgets support data-status.\n. Dashing uses Batman.js at its core and you can use Batman's view bindings to achieve this.\nIn the Widget's .html file, you need to add a data-bind-onclick=\"onclick\" attribute.\n. This is a cool idea, any progress made on it? What's the roadmap for Dashing 2.0? How can I help???\n. Cool, I suppose this will be on hold until a replacement for Batman is chosen / implemented?\n. There are two ways that I can think of to do this.\n1) Add an onData handler to the list widget which updates the @items property of the widget instead of replacing it whole-hog.\n2) Add some kind of middle-man which aggregates the results of the disparate sources into a single event that is sent to the dashboard.\n. You can use this as an example: https://gist.github.com/Skeyelab/9bc044bc7f68aa365157\n. Please close this issue.\n. Do you see data coming in from /events inside the Network Panel of Chrome?\nIt may be related to how Thin executes on this environment. The Event service is an SSE endpoint, so it is a bit weird -- the data keeps streaming out and the request never really finishes...\nIf there's no data coming in from the endpoint then the request is never actually leaving the server. There are many possible reasons for this...\nIf using Puma resolves this, that is one more reason that Dashing should make the switch from Thin.\n. Please close this issue.\n. Don't trust that @welsh guy, he's trouble. :wink: \nI'm not sure that I'm clear on what the problem is here... But if I do understand, this is the correct code:\n``` ruby\nrequire_relative 'my_db.rb'\nclients = [\n        {name: 'OS-client1', id: '1'},\n        {name: 'OS-client2', id: '2'},\n        {name: 'OS-client3', id: '3'},\n        {name: 'OS-client4', id: '4'},\n        ]\nSCHEDULER.every '30s', :first_in => 0 do |job|\n  clients.each do |client|\n    db = MyDb.conn\n    sql = (\"SELECT computerid FROM computers WHERE LastContact < DATE_ADD(NOW(),Interval -120 Second) AND os LIKE %Server% AND clientid = #{client[:id]}\")\n    results = db.query(sql)\n    current_client[:name] = results.count\n    send_event(\"#{client[:name]}\", { value: current_client[:name] } )\n    db.close\n  end\nend\n```\n. Please close this as it duplicates #192 \n. I suspect that this is a limitation of the browser.\nBrowsers specify a maximum number of connections per hostname: www.browserscope.org/?category=network\nIf this is the cause, you can skirt this issue through a technique called Domain Sharding. Add a few extra DNS entries that point to the same IP and load each in a separate tab.\ndashing.corp.int\ndashing-1.corp.int\ndashing-2.corp.int\netc...\nYou can automate this by redirecting (via JavaScript or in your protected! helper method) to one of your shards randomly from the base URL...\n. Serve the image from Dashing via HTTP. file:// is flaky at best.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_URI_scheme\n. It is the job which injects data into the history.yml file and it is not possible to stop this from happening for a specific job. Furthermore, this is not a desirable feature.\nI recommend increasing the frequency that your job sends events. If there are expensive operations that you perform in this job, you should decouple those actions from the scheduled task which sends the event. So you can have one scheduled task that runs every 5 minutes and stores data in memory and another scheduled task that runs every 5 seconds and shuttles out the data that is stored in memory.\n. send_event also takes a third, mysterious parameter. If you set it to 'dashboard' the history.yml won't be written to.\nIt is witchcraft though, use at your peril.\nPlease close this issue.\n. Maybe a better solution would be to add an optional config object. Store the default config (defaultConfig) in an object, use a deep-copy override overriddenConfig = jquery.extend(true, {}, defaultConfig, Dashing.gridster); and then supply overriddenConfig as the parameter to gridster.\nThis would allow people to override any of gridster's settings on a per-dashboard basis.\nI'd argue that moving into Dashing 2.0, then we should use this approach to customising all aspects of such components. Lodash provides the same extend functionality, if jQuery is undesirable.\nSo instead of setting Dashing.widget_margins in your dashboard to customise, you'd set Dashing.gridster.widget_margins (or Dashing.gridster = {widget_margins: ...})\n. Let me rephrase my last sentence (which was a generalisation, not specific to you):\nSo instead of setting Dashing.numColumns in your dashboard to customise, you'd set Dashing.gridster.max_size_x (or Dashing.gridster = {max_size_x: ...})\nThe reason why I make this suggestion is that you may want this flag, but another developer may want to set a different flag. If we add each one by one, pretty soon we will have replicated Gridster's API and we'll have a mess of flags.\n. I've already said my peace on this PR -- I don't support adding one more flag.\n. Please close this issue.\n. I believe this is happening because the /events service is returning before Batman has parsed all of the Widgets from the DOM. Gotta love concurrency...\nA better solution would be to wait to apply data returned from /events until all the widgets are loaded into Dashing.widgets.\n. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12520456/execjsruntimeerror-on-windows-trying-to-follow-rubytutorial\nGo with option 3 in the accepted answer.\nPlease close this issue.\n. There really isn't enough information here to provide a solid answer.\nThat being said, the code that is querying the database is assuming that it will be successful. You must modify this code to handle exceptional cases, like network outages.\nAny decent database interface library will provide this capability.\nPlease close this issue.\n. Now that batman is deprecated, this can be closed ( #498 ).\n. Please close this issue. (Duplicates #498)\n. Currently, Dashing can be run as a daemon with dashing start -d ... which is a tricky way of passing -d to thin.\nIt seems that Puma uses a different model, so I think pumactl needs to be used like this:\nbundle exec pumactl -S /path/to/state.file restart\n. Not sure how everyone else feels about this PR, but I think it'd be a positive move once the tests are fixed up to reflect this change.\n. There are a number of requests for this in #183 -- seems like this should be merged after being fixed up.\n. I am going to take this over and get it up to code so we can merge it in, unless there are objections.\n. Batman has a style binding for this: data-style-#{styleAttrName}\nHowever I don't think it supports vendor specific prefixes at this time.\nYou may have success with a custom widget -- I don't think it would be difficult. The approach I would take would be to attach to the onData method and use jQuery to apply the transformation from the data value.\n. Please close this issue.\n. The drag & drop functionality is provided by Gridster.js - the docs for that library may be useful.\nYou can probably just do what is recommended here: https://github.com/ducksboard/gridster.js/issues/58\nSo something like this inside your widget file:\ncoffeescript\n$(@node).data('gridster').disable()\n. You can do this with CSS too: https://github.com/ducksboard/gridster.js/issues/195\nAdding .no-drag to an element would disable dragging.\ncss\n.no-drag .gs-resize-handle-both{\n  display:none;\n}\n. This sounds like a nice feature, though I believe you could accomplish similar behaviour with a mutex -- couldn't you?\nAre there many breaking changes in the upgrade from 2.x to 3.x?\n. Can anyone provide insight on whether the upgrade to 2.x to 3.x has breaking changes in it?\nThis is a critical component of Dashing -- it is important to know what the impact will be on current users and whether this change needs to be held off for a major version release.\n. Someone already tried to do this in #237. Please close this PR as a duplicate.\n. Makes sense to me and the behaviour was added as a flag on the install command (so no breaking changes). :+1: for merging.\nI am a bit of a Docker noob, so forgive me if this is a dumb question, but... In terms of a Dockerized app, is that the standard way for configuring software?\nIE: You put the config in the container before installing and the installation doesn't clobber your config?\n. Dashing supports posting arbitrary data via HTTP POST. This is protected by an auth token, specified within your config.ru. Finally, Dashing is really just a collection of open source tools and at it's core it's really a Sinatra app.\nArmed with this knowledge, you have several options. The simplest is using an AJAX POST request:\n$.post \"/widgets/myWidget\", \"{ \\\"auth_token\\\": \\\"YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN\\\", \\\"value\\\": #{value} }\"\nThis had the distinct disadvantage of exposing the keys to your kingdom on the client side. A better approach would be to perform this post on the server side, thus hiding the auth token. You can expose this server-side post request as a Sinatra route and then post data to the route you define instead.\n. To clarify, this allows a suffix to be added to the Current Value via a data-suffix attribute on the Graph Widget.\nVery small change, seems useful, :+1: for merging.\nThat being said, this change relies on batman.js -- which Dashing will be moving away from due to it's deprecation. So if it is merged, it will be deleted when version 2 finally awakens.\n. To really solve this problem, it would require re-engineering the event service to supply data to various widget endpoints and then have the dashboard subscribe to only those endpoints.\nI don't know Batman well enough to say how difficult that would be, but it certainly would not be a small change. That being said, this sounds like an important and interesting problem to solve.\nIn the mean-time, it seems like your suggestion to gzip the event service output has merit:\n\nConcerned by high overhead of UTF-8 on the wire? An SSE connection is a streaming HTTP \nresponse, which means that it can be compressed (i.e., gziped), just as any other HTTP response \nwhile in flight! While SSE is not meant for delivery of binary data, it is nonetheless an efficient \ntransport: ensure that your server is applying gzip compression on the SSE stream.\nSource: High Performance Browser Networking\n. I've thought about this a bit more, there may be a simpler solution to this problem. Also, the solution I suggested before may actually make the problem worse because of the additional HTTP overhead associated with each request (1 request per widget vs 1 request per dashboard). This would depend on how many widgets you have per dashboard (more than 4 / dashboard and this becomes useless).\n\nFor example, the event service could optionally take a list of widgets as a parameter and supply only data for those widgets. This would impact performance however, as the connection to the SSE endpoint could only be establish once the DOM is parsed and Dashing.widgets is filled with data.\nIf this is implemented, it should be a setting that must be turned on a per-dashboard basis.\n. You can pull out the gridster instance of a widget like this:\ngridster = $(@node).parents('ul').data('gridster')\nFrom there you can resize it with the resize_widget method:\ngridster.resize_widget(1, getRandomInt(1, 4), getRandomInt(1, 4))\n. Have you tried https://gist.github.com/jwalton/6614023#supported-html-data-fields ?\nIt looks like there are a lot of colour configuration options in there.\nYou have changed the colour of the Title of the widget and the colour of the More Info caption -- neither of these are shown in the attached image. What are you trying to change the colour of specifically?\nThe text in the legend can be enlarged by adjusting this value: https://gist.github.com/jwalton/6614023#file-rickshawgraph-scss-L76\nPlease close this issue if you've already solved it.\n. Thanks, that would be great as these issues can act as a knowledge base for others :+1: \n. I just implemented this last night, I reverse engineered this example: http://code.shutterstock.com/rickshaw/examples/lines.html\nThere were two key insights:\n- There is a ton of CSS that you need to copy over\n- call new Rickshaw.Graph.HoverDetail with your @graph before the first @graph.render()\nLet me know how it goes!\n. Perhaps css fits the bill?\nli {\n    border-top: 3px solid #ccc;\n  }\n  li:first-child {\n    border-top: none;\n  }\n. Please close this issue.\n. Why do you want this? I don't think Dashing is really suited to your use case.\nIt is meant for people who like to write code.\n. Dynamic management of Dashboards is way outside the scope of Dashing.\nSounds like one of the paid Dashboard services might be better for you:\nhttps://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki#why-use-dashing-when-there-are-plenty-of-cloud-based-dashboards-out-there\n. Also @kaltinril's suggestion will not work unless you add some kind of persistence layer...\n. The comma delimited text file is persistence.\nAs I understand it, @martenpalsson wants to configure the dashboard inside Dashing (not through some CSV file). To do this, the changes made in the browser would have to be written back to the text file (or a database, or some other persistence layer). If they weren't, all changes made in the browser would be lost upon refresh.\nNot sure why you'd prefer to create your dashboards as CSV's instead of HAML / ERB templates... Unless the CSV file is generated by some Hipster Batch or otherwise Dynamic process...\n. Awesome, you are using a Hipster Batch :+1: \n. Please close this issue.\n. To me, the beauty of Dashing is the fact that you can define a Dashboard to be whatever you want. You aren't forced into a mould and you can create whatever crazy thing you can dream up.\nAs @cefigueiredo suggests, you can add custom routes for this. In your config.ru you can add routes:\n``` ruby\nmap Sinatra::Application.assets_prefix do\n  run Sinatra::Application.sprockets\nend\npost '/custom/form' do\n  puts params[:name]\nend\nrun Sinatra::Application\n```\nYou cannot really add routes like /form, as this will collide with Dashing's default dashboard route (/:dashboard).\nInside the route you can do whatever you want with the data -- which will be available in the params hash.\nI would also suggest using a database instead of a file, even if you use SQLite. You may be able to store the data in memory too, if you do not require persistence. You can set a class variable in your config.ru (@@variable) and its state will be shared across requests.\n. Please close this issue.\n. Dashing comes with a Graph widget that is built with Rickshaw; however Rickshaw doesn't support funnel charts.\nIf you need this functionality, you will have to create it yourself. However, I recommend looking at how the Graph widget was implemented for an example of how you might do it yourself. Personally, I would copy the Graph widget and hack it up until it worked (and then clean it up for contribution!).\n. With Highchart's license it doesn't really make sense for someone to create an Open-Sourced widget based on their libraries. Also, you can use Rickshaw's stacked bar graph to show the same data.\nThis issue can probably be closed.\n. This is intended for the Number widget. A status field can be added to the event data which can be used as a visual indicator of an important metric.\nIf you are annoyed by this feature, I suggest that you do not use it. The template dashboard does not implement this functionality.\nThis issue can be closed.\n. In the protected! helper method of your config.ru you could switch on params[:dashboard] to run different auth code for different dashboards... Maybe. Let me know if that works!\n. I have a cleaner solution for this, although it violates MVC so... Still kind of gross still.\nFirstly, follow this:\nhttps://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki/How-to:-Add-authentication\nExcept instead of calling the method protected! call it something else (maybe authenticate!)\nThen inside your .erb file(s), you can just call it at the top: <% authenticate! %>\nMaybe this is an indication that it would be nice to be able to mixin functionality to specific dashboard routes, but still have the standard dashing route execute after (or before).\n. This issue can be closed.\n. Issue can be closed.\n. This is an issue with your Ruby environment configuration (not Dashing). Are you able to install other gems?\nI recommend using RVM or rbenv to manage this configuration for you...\nhttp://cbednarski.com/articles/installing-ruby/\nAlternatively, you can hack up your Ubuntu environment until this works. Yuck...\n. Please close this issue.\n. Alternatively, you can add it as a helper as recommended.\nThis is done in your config.ru... See the example dashboard template if you've removed this section from your dashboard.\nYou can call it from your ERB files like this <%= getGitVersion %>\n. Not sure if you're aware, but /events is an SSE endpoint - it streams as long as the browser will let it.\nTry loading it up in a browser, you will see that as each job runs more data is added to the page... Eventually it might timeout - this is a limitation of the browser mainly. This issue can mostly be skirted by increasing the frequency that events are sent.\nMore info about SSE's: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events\nOther than /events taking so long to load, what other problems are you seeing? Widgets not updating? Initial Dashboard load time is slow? etc?\nI think you might have better luck diagnosing this issue using your browser's network panel than by looking at the server logs -- just a hunch though!\n. Please close this issue.\n. Dashing requires an execjs compatible JavaScript engine:\nhttps://github.com/sstephenson/execjs\nOn Windows, that should be built in (JScript):\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9bbdkx3k.aspx\nMaybe that is an avenue to explore... Is JScript available for ruby to use.\n. https://github.com/gsmedley/thin_service - Use this.\n...\nThe key here is you want to run a Thin-based Ruby application as a Windows service. Try googling \"ruby thin as windows service\".\n. The Dashing Client would need to be located on the same machine as the Dashing Server (otherwise the browser wouldn't be able to load the iFrame contents).\nOtherwise, this should be possible:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/11152103/displaying-local-htm-file-in-iframe\nHowever, it sounds weird. If possible, put the HTML files into your Dashing app's public folder and reference them like this: (assuming: Dashing/public/SFDC.html)\n<li data-row=\"1\" data-col=\"1\" data-sizex=\"1\" data-sizey=\"1\">\n      <div  data-id=\"iframe\" data-url=\"/SFDC.html\"></div>\n    </li>\n. You could also look at running dashing via thin and telling it not to log anything.\nThis has the distinct disadvantage of being impossible to determine what went wrong if things go sideways.\nJust roll your logs with cron as @derwin12 suggests.\n. This is not a Dashing issue. Please close.\n. You can adjust the widgets data-sizex or data-sizey parameters in your dashboard.erb file...\n<li data-row=\"1\" data-col=\"1\" data-sizex=\"1\" data-sizey=\"1\">\nreplaced with:\n<li data-row=\"1\" data-col=\"1\" data-sizex=\"4\" data-sizey=\"4\">\n. From ruby?\nsend_event( \"valuation\", { last: 0, current: 10 } )\n. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6868507/automatically-adding-proxy-to-all-http-connections-in-ruby\nThis is not a Dashing issue... Please close.\n. This is not a Dashing issue.\nPlease close this, as per this comment.\n. You could make the number widget alternate between two different numbers (changing the title also to reflect the current mode). This could be accomplished by two separate offset Rufus jobs on the backend, though this approach may get strange with certain values:\nSCHEDULER.every '60s', :first_in => 0 do\n   # First Value\n   send_event('number',{title:'First Number', current: 2})\nend\nSCHEDULER.every '60s', :first_in => '30s' do\n   # Second Value -- Offset\n   send_event('number',{title:'Second Number', current: 1})\nend\nAnother approach for alternating values would be to use a mutex, you can see more about that on the Rufus docs: https://github.com/jmettraux/rufus-scheduler\nIf you don't want to alternate between numbers, you might have success by using a data-foreach-#{itemName}. You can read more about how to do this in the Batman docs: http://batmanjs.org/docs/api/batman.view_bindings.html#data-foreach\nIf you do take the approach of using data-foreach and find you want to show more data or start to customise in other ways, you should look into creating your own custom widgets. There are lots of great examples here: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki/Additional-Widgets\nGood luck and let me know if you have any more questions.\n. Seems to have been answered here too:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/27167440/dashing-does-not-run-on-heroku\n. Not sure if I see the use case for this, but it's a cool idea. This would need some work if it is going to be carried out.\n. How are you using the padding attribute? I think that is the correct approach to solving it.\nThis solved it for me: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21708577/rickshaw-graph-max-y-axis-is-cutoff\n. You could send each peer to a different event ID (in my examples, \"peer-#{peer.name}\"). Then go back to using the data-foreach-peer approach, but make the ID of each element dynamic (like this: data-id=\"peer- | append peer.name\").\nYou can also loop over your configuration data when dashing starts to run the Rufus jobs in parallel, so that the widgets would update independently.\n. That is a lot of servers! I would probably create a custom widget for this...\nI would move those getJSON calls to the back end into a Rufus job (or two...) and do as @rmosolgo suggested -- using the data-foreach-#{item_name} Batman binding.\nRead more about Batman bindings here: http://batmanjs.org/docs/api/batman.view_bindings.html\nThere are many examples of it's use in the widgets folder of a Dashing app and there are lots of excellent widgets here: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki/Additional-Widgets\n.

Support requests should be directed to Stack Overflow unless there is a specific change that someone can point to be made to Dashing.\nSo far, there is no information to go on and I am unable to reproduce this behaviour.\n.

So as long as Dashing runs normally for you, it should run from Ruby Mine.\nhttp://blog.jetbrains.com/ruby/2012/06/rubymine-nire-eap-welcome-sinatra/\n. It appears you are on Linux, add therubyracer to your gemfile:\n```\nLinux only Gems\nif RUBY_PLATFORM =~ /x86_64-linux/\n    gem 'therubyracer'\nend\n```\n. You can deploy Dashing to any system with Ruby 1.9+... So yes, it can be deployed to AWS.\nHere is a rubygem for handling oci8:\nhttps://github.com/kubo/ruby-oci8\nDashing is a general library that allows you to display data from any system that ruby can get its hands on. The backend is just a set of jobs that run at intervals and execute ruby code. The front-end is an awesome widget-based system built on top of batman.js.\n. The gem you are using requires the environment to provide some of it's functionality through a dependency. Heroku doesn't have the proper Oracle client libraries installed by default. You would need to use a custom buildpack for this.\nTry something like this:\nhttps://github.com/nasali/oracle-oci8-heroku-buildpack\n. @Mitsumi is the correct value shown when you refresh the page, as it is for @ykyuen ?\n. Perhaps the browsers JavaScript engine is becoming thrashed somehow? That\nshouldn't happen right away under normal circumstances.\nHow long before this starts happening?\n. ~~Perhaps the browsers JavaScript engine is becoming thrashed somehow? That\nshouldn't happen right away under normal circumstances.~~  -- If the console is still outputting stuff, the JS engine cannot be thrashed.\nTry setting a breakpoint inside the number widget's onData and step through... Perhaps it is being updated momentarily and then being overwritten?\nIs this a stock number widget, or does it have modifications?\n. If you can create a publicly available example of this happening I will take a crack at debugging it.\nOtherwise I can only recommend to workaround this issue by sending a refresh every now and then.\nPlease update this issue with a URL to an example of this or close this issue.\n. Please close this issue.\n. Care to elaborate on this issue?\nI think this should be closed.\n. onData: (value) ->\n    meter = $(@node).find(\".meter\")\n    if value >= 85\n        color = '#fff'\n    else\n        color = 'color' # what color do you want to use?\n    end\n    meter.trigger('configure',\n        'fgColor': color\n    )\n. What are the options under evaluation? I am curious about where the project may be headed.\n. Very cool!\n. http://hamlet.coffee/ would get my vote if we're going esoteric...\n. Not sure why React was chosen, but if it was for performance:\nhttp://blog.500tech.com/is-reactjs-fast/\nTo be clear, there are tons of other great reasons to choose React.\n. I love how easy it is to pick up Dashing and start cranking out dashboards with basic knowledge of HTML and ruby. Diving deeper and creating widgets is also quite a pleasant experience.\nIt does seem eerily similar: http://vuejs.org/guide/#A_Quick_Example\nIt has built in support for filtering, views/models, etc.\nThere is a react fork going already: https://github.com/florianz/dashing\nIt hasn't seen much action lately and I'm not sure how I feel about it in general. It doesn't feel like the original Dashing, but it would make it much easier to programmatically generate dashboards. Not sure how I feel about doing that either...\nIt does seem like VueJS would give us a more Dashing-like experience -- if I compare what I see in the existing React fork to the VueJS example above.\n. Is it a Heroku free instance?\nThey go to sleep after 1 hour of inactivity:\nhttps://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos#dyno-sleeping\nYou may be able to skirt this issue for a while with:\nhttps://coderwall.com/p/u0x3nw/avoid-heroku-idling-with-new-relic-pings\nHope this helps!\n. I'm sorry, I should have read the details of your inquiry more closely the first time. The events service streams data to the dashboard via server-sent events, so you are seeing H12 because Heroku is toasting the request.\nhttps://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/request-timeout#long-polling-and-streaming-responses\nYou are probably already using the Cedar stack, as it is the default buildpack. Use it instead if you specified something else.\nOtherwise, I think the issue may actually be that you aren't sending data often enough:\n\nCedar supports HTTP 1.1 features such as long-polling and streaming responses. An application has an initial 30 second window to respond with a single byte back to the client. However, each byte transmitted thereafter (either received from the client or sent by your application) resets a rolling 55 second window. If no data is sent during the 55 second window, the connection will be terminated.\n\nAdd a heartbeat job like this and let me know if it resolves the H12 issues:\nSCHEDULER.every '50s', :first_in => 0 do\n    send_event('heartbeat', { pulse: true })\nend\n. Try asking Heroku support.\n. Not sure if the Timeout issue has been solved -- but maybe this could be solved by trying to recover gracefully when there is a timeout. Your data should be written to a history.yml file when Dashing is shut down gracefully, which on Heroku is deleted because of its Ephemeral Filesystem.\nIf PR #330 were reviewed and merged, then data could be stored Redis, allowing it to persist...\n. @ryanprater Thanks a ton for your insights into this issue! Very helpful information and it sounds like the best theory yet that explains the symptoms described in this issue.\nGood luck resolving this with Heroku! Please create a new issue if you think that Dashing could be improved to play more nicely with Heroku, but it sounds like any old Ruby (2.1+) app would suffer the same problems.\n. Does this issue occur with a brand new dash board?\ntry this:\ndashing new test\ncd test\ndashing start\nHow did you install your gems? You should be using Bundler.\nSeems like something probably went wrong with your ruby / gem installation or that your dashboard has become horribly corrupt since it was created.\n. +1 to this... I'd also recommend adding history.yml and tmp/\nThoughts?\n. I do this on every Dashing project -- probably a sensible default. :+1: for merging.\n. I just created a brand new dashboard and was able to push it to Heroku no problem. You must have changed something either in your Gemfile or your Gemfile.lock.\nPlease compare those files with a fresh instance and see if that helps you track down the issue.\n. The #weekly div doesn't have a .x_tick class, so your CSS rule is wrong.\nI think you probably want #weekly .xtick.\n. Sounds good, that is a more general solution.\nPlease close this issue.\n. I believe the issue is that you are trying to define a route that is already matched by Dashing's /:dashboard route... Although this seems inconsistent with what I see in app.rb -- I'm not a Sinatra expert so I can't say for sure.\nTry doing something like (it worked for me):\n``` ruby\npost '/temperature/details' do\n   # find temp\n   @temperature = temp\n   erb :details\nend\ninside ERB:\n<%= @temperature %>\n```\nNote that you'll also be able to go to /details unless you guard against this in your ERB by analysing the path or something gross like that...\nI found this out by exploring the Dashing source code.\n. It just occurred to me that probably a better solution to this is to create a helper method that calculates the temperature.\nSomething like this (untested):\n``` ruby\n  #config.ru\n  helpers do\n    # ...\n    def getTemperatureDetails(item)\n      # get temperature details for item\n      return temperature\n    end\n  end\n#details.erb\n  <%= getTemperatureDetails(params[:item]) %>\n```\n. This version change would be a breaking change, as outlined here: https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/wiki/Upgrading-from-3.2.1-to-4\nNot that this would be an impossible task, but it certainly makes things a wee bit trickier.\n. You can make the tiles blink by applying a status-warning or status-danger CSS class to them when appropriate. The number widget also takes a status parameter when sending events, in addition to the current parameter.\nSo you can make a number widget blink out of the box with something like:\nruby\nsend_event('my-number-widget',{current: 150, status: 'danger'})\nYou can look at number.coffee in the onData handler to see how you could replicate this functionality for other widgets. Maybe a Dashing 2.0 change could be to do this on the base widget -- as any widget could benefit from this functionality.\n. I'm a bit busy at the moment, but I can take a look at updating this later. Maybe next week.\nWhether or not the PR is accepted... I dunno. It would be a breaking change for anyone using Dashing, not just for the gem itself. Seems like a Dashing 2.0 thing.\n. No idea on ETA, I think @pushmatrix has big ideas for Dashing 2.0 :+1: \nI can certainly fork Dashing and make a PR for the update, I'm not sure if the maintainer will accept it until 2.0. I'm just an enthusiastic user. :neckbeard:\nI'm happy to do the update when I've got time, I bet it's a 1-2 hour job.\n. I use thin. I start dashing like this, with an Apache proxy-pass on a vhost:\nbash\n$BUNDLE_CMD exec thin start -p 3030 -d -R \"$DASHING_DIR/$RACK_FILE\" -P /var/run/dashing/web_console.pid\nWe have a PR waiting to be merged that swaps out Thin for Puma, this would enable us to run Dashing on JRuby. This would also enable people to bring Java data (like JMX) into the mix really easily, as well as improving overall performance for most users. I'm hoping it gets merged.\nI'm not sure if there are other undesirable impacts of switching to Puma, I'm glad to hear that it's working for you. Learning to code is a lifelong process! Everyone is always learning.\n. That's excellent, I wasn't sure if the update changed had breaking styling changes. Sounds like it's a pretty quick job. Which also gives me hope for getting a PR merged before 2.0, as User's customised widgets and dashboards would also be easy to change. Thanks for the info!\nIt's up to you, but I'd support a PR to resolve this issue.\n. As that is an unrelated change, that would be in a different PR. #427 has been started for that -- though the intended goal there is to allow Dashing to run in JRuby out of the box.\n. Any updates on this issue?\n. Are there any breaking changes in the upgrade of rickshaw? Does this commit integrate with #542?\n. Hope this gets merged :+1: \n. This would have breaking changes -- but the migration path is likely a simple Find All & Replace.\n. This hasn't been merged.\nIf you install the dashing gem from that fork, you should be up and rolling with the latest font-awesome.\nIf you had any custom widgets, they would need to be updated to use the new fa- prefixes. This is the main concern with merging this PR, is that 3rd party widgets would need to be updated.\nHowever, we will eventually need to do this...\n. You might have better luck with a Rails based framework, as Figaro is designed to work with Rails.\nTry: https://github.com/gottfrois/dashing-rails\n. Dashing is really just a Sinatra app under the hood.\nHere is the route that defines how the dashboards are accessed: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/blob/f4b121e8dead69e02223ee9d50e431dbc7f5b3c5/lib/dashing/app.rb#L78-L86\nIn your config.ru, you can add custom routes according to the Sinatra documentation: http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html#Routes\n. You can probably just use wildcard routes like get '/dashboards/*/:dashboard' and then use :dashboard to render the correct partial.\n. Any update on this? Can this be closed?\n. It's wonderful to see a company giving back to OpenSource -- cheers!\nAfter sifting through your message, it seems like you have these issues:\n1. jqPlot expects each graph element to have a unique ID\n2. JavaScript dependency load order\nFor # 1:\nAn understanding of how jQuery and jQuery plugins work would be beneficial, specifically this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8884463/jqplot-target-that-doesnt-have-a-static-id\nFor # 2:\nDashing uses Sprockets to manage client-side dependencies (like CSS and JS). If you open application.coffee you'll see:\n``` coffeescript\n= require_directory .\n= require_tree ../../widgets\n```\nYou need to add your dependencies above the require_directory line. Something like:\n``` coffeescript\n= require jqueryPlugin1\n= require jqueryPlugin2\n= require_directory .\n= require_tree ../../widgets\n```\n. For # 1:\nI apologise if I assumed your knowledge of jQuery was limited. As you know, proper jQuery plugins should be available on $.fn.<plugin>. This allows them to apply their functionality to a jQuery selection. Load up your Dashboard, in your browser console run console.log($.fn.jqplot). What do you get back? You should see a function.\nIf you get undefined, you may be using an old version, as suggested in the the accepted answer for the SO I linked.\nYou can get the latest code from here:\nhttps://bitbucket.org/cleonello/jqplot/\nBrowsing this source code seems to indicate that the bug in jqPlot that you're referring to has been fixed.\n. Can you paste some code samples or put this up in a public repo? I think I'm just misunderstanding what you're asking for.\n. haha, sounds good. Do you have multiple graph's per Dashing widget? I think you'll need to keep a handle on each of the Graph instances as a class variable of the widget so that you can update them in the onData like this:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/10459631/jqplot-how-to-live-update-a-chart\n. I'm just taking a quick look at it on my lunch break, but it looks like you're doing everything in a sane way.\nI will make some time this evening to dig deeper into this. What is the undesired behaviour that you're seeing with this code? Is it giving errors or just not doing what you expect?\n. Aha! It was such a small thing, I overlooked it several times before finding the main mistake.\ndrawGraph was not defined as a class method, meaning that it didn't have access to the other instance properties like @node.\nSo this:\n``` coffeescript\ndrawGraph = (val, buckets, bucketColors, reverse, sLabel, pos) ->  \n    bucketColors.reverse() if reverse\nreturn $.jqplot(\"jqmeter\", [[val]],\ngrid: {background: 'transparent'}\nseriesDefaults:\n  renderer: $.jqplot.MeterGaugeRenderer\n  rendererOptions:\n    label: sLabel\n    labelPosition: pos\n    showTickLabels: true\n    intervals: buckets\n    intervalColors: bucketColors\n)\n\n```\nShould be:\n``` coffeescript\n  drawGraph: (val, buckets, bucketColors, reverse, sLabel, pos) ->\n    bucketColors.reverse() if reverse\nblah = $(@node).find('.jqmeter').jqplot([[val]],\ngrid: {background: 'transparent'}\nseriesDefaults:\n  renderer: $.jqplot.MeterGaugeRenderer\n  rendererOptions:\n    label: sLabel\n    labelPosition: pos\n    showTickLabels: true\n    intervals: buckets\n    intervalColors: bucketColors\n)\n\n```\nI've modified div#jqmeter to be div.jqmeter in the HTML and I am using jQuery.fn.find after selecting @node to ensure that the data update is namespaced to the correct DOM element (IE: the widget). I'm also using jqPlot as a selector method, as indicated in the StackOverflow I linked earlier. \nNote that by making drawGraph a class method, you'll have to reference it like this: @drawGraph.\nHope this helps!\n. I'm not sure I'm fulling understanding your request, but I think that this is more of System Administration issue than a Dashing issue...\nI would achieve this by enforcing system permissions on the folder.\n. Oh, I got you. I don't know if it violates the license...\nThere are two approaches I would take to this:\n1) Obfuscation - Make the auth code hard to remove / alter\n2) Container / Appliance - Put the code into a VM or Container that has locked down permissions and 'just works' in their environment\nDashing certainly doesn't provide any functionality for licensing or restricting the number of running copies. You'll have to come up with some magic.\n. Gridster attaches the initialised Gridster object as a data property to the element.\nhttp://gridster.net/#usage - You can retrieve the data values like this once the grid has been initialised:\ncoffeescript\ngridster = $(\".gridster ul:first\").data('gridster');\n. +1\n. Maybe squash your commits? It is not clear what must be done to please the merging overlords... :wink:\n. I do not believe this to be a breaking change... Anyone feel otherwise?\n. What you could do is send all the data to the Widget on the Front-End and have the Widget display only the filtered data. This would be quite simple to write, though if your dataset is very large this may not be feasible. Dashboards should ideally be a presentation layer only -- most of the logic should be in the widgets and dashboards. The jobs should only be doing enough to securely grab data from your reporting services.\nWith that being said, you could use the HTTP API to allow users to \"collaboratively filter\" the data. This means that if one person filters, all people see the same filtered data. If another person changes the filter, the first person's filter will be changed. Remember that Dashing is intended to display the same data to all consumers of the page -- not uniquely filtered data to each consumer. If that works for you, you can send POST requests like this:\ncoffeescript\nfilterStart = $(@node).find('#filterStart').val()\nfilterEnd = $(@node).find('#filterEnd').val()\n$.post \"/widgets/report\", \"{ \\\"auth_token\\\": \\\"TOKEN_FROM_CONFIGRU\\\", \\\"filterStart\\\": #{filterStart}, \\\"filterEnd\\\": #{filterEnd} }\"\nIf neither of these would work for you, you'd have to override Dashing.Widget to not use an SSE EventSource and instead only request & render new data when the filters were set by the user. You'd also have to add Sinatra routes in your config.ru to handle the submission and return the filtered data.\nStart reading the source here to go down this path: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/blob/v1.3.4/javascripts/dashing.coffee#L34-L63\n. @yogeshrathore15 Why are you pasting that here?\n. Dashing 2.0 is probably going to use React.\nThere are some interesting forks to this end: @FlorianZ - 2dce07309581b04e8f1070517f835a4aa2b7f01c\n. Any updates on this?\nDashing works fine over an unimpeded network connection.\nMy bet is that the browser is failing to render it. Can you see the browser console on either device?\n@nikilster - What browser are you using on the Pi?\n@mattrayner - What browser are you using on your Pi's?\n. Any updates on this? :ski: \n. Dashing is built on Sinatra, sessions are disabled by default: http://www.sinatrarb.com/faq.html#sessions.\nTo enable them, you need to add this to your config.ru:\nruby\nconfigure do\n  # ...\n  use Rack::Session::Pool, :expire_after => 2592000\n  # ...\nend\nYou can access them from a Dashboard view template like this:\nerb\n<%= session['key'] %>\nThe session can only be accessed from a Sinatra route of some kind. So, accessing it from a Job file is different depending on your intent. For example, if I wanted to set a static variable in the session before every request I could do this inside a .rb file in my jobs directory:\n``` ruby\nrequire 'sinatra'\nbefore do\n    session['key'] = \"Hello World!\"\nend\n```\nHope that helps! Please let me know if this solves your issue.\n. Any updates on this?\n. Thanks for asking your question on SO instead. I will endeavour to answer it there. I intend to write up Issue Submission Guidelines that will require support requests to be submitted there.\nCan you please close this issue though? I promise I will connect with you on StackOverflow. :grin:\n. I am unable to reproduce this issue with stock Dashing. Do you have any other customisations? Can you provide any further details?\n. Are you sending the current and last values in your Rufus job?\nFrom the sample project:\n``` ruby\ncurrent_valuation = 0\nSCHEDULER.every '2s' do\n  last_valuation = current_valuation\n  send_event('valuation', { current: current_valuation, last: last_valuation })\nend\n```\nhtml\n<div data-id=\"valuation\" data-view=\"Number\" data-title=\"Current Valuation\" data-moreinfo=\"In billions\" data-prefix=\"$\"></div>\n. Glad to hear you got it sorted. Hopefully once #514 is merged, people won't have this kind of issue again.\n. :+1: - Looking at the D3.js changelog, there are a lot of good fixes, additions, and performance improvements and there does not appear to be any breaking changes.\n. Thanks for updating with a solution, can you please close this issue?\n. Try looking at how the Hotness widget does it:\nhttps://gist.github.com/rowanu/6246149#file-hotness-coffee-L8-L23\n. Have you invoked Bundler to install the bundle from Gemfile?\nIf not, make sure you have Bundler installed: gem install bundler\nThen cd to your dashing directory and run: bundle install\n. You need to actually run bundler to install the bundle though...\nDid you do this:\n\nThen cd to your dashing directory and run: bundle install\n. Can you please paste the output from this:\ncd /path/to/dashingProject && bundle --verbose\n. Great, it looks like your bundle is installed... You should be able to skirt any issues with the environment by running dashing from the bundle:\nbundle exec dashing start\n\nLet me know if that works...\n. Try loading /events in your browser and watch the event stream for a bit. Are the JSON values coming through as you expect?\n. Do you have other jobs that are sending data successfully?\n. What if you create a new project? Does that work?\n. If you are able to run the demo project:\nAre you running Dashing with dashing start? If so, do you have any customisation in your config.ru?\nYou can try deleting your history.yml and ensuring the directory is writable by the user that is executing Dashing.\nAlternatively, create a new project and copy your jobs, dashboards and any custom widgets into the new directory.\n. You should be able to use unicorn. Add it to your Gemfile and reinstall your bundle with bundle install and then run unicorn from the bundle with bundle exec unicorn.\n. Dashing is Sinatra under the hood. You can set up Sinatra routes in your config.ru, as I outlined here: #516.\nI should make up a wiki page with this info, it is a commonly asked question.\n. What widget are you using? Is the data coming in to the browser via SSE correctly?\n. It depends.\n. At the top of the MySQL example, they require 'mysql2'. You need to require 'pg' instead, as per:\nhttps://bitbucket.org/ged/ruby-pg/wiki/Home\nThis will require installing the pg gem (IE: gem install pg or add to your bundle).\nHere is the MySQL example rewritten for Postgres and completely untested:\n``` ruby\nrequire 'pg'\nSCHEDULER.every '15m', :first_in => 0 do |job|\n# Postgres connection\n  db = PG.connect(:hostaddr => \"192.168.1.1\", :user => \"dashing\", :password => \"SECRET\", :port => 3306, :dbname => \"users\" )\n# SQL query - simplified because lazy\n  sql = \"SELECT * FROM users\"\n# Execute the query\n  db.exec(sql) do |results|\n# Sending to List widget, so map to :label and :value\nacctitems = results.map do |row|\n  row = {\n    :label => row['account'],\n    :value => row['count']\n  }\nend\n\n# Update the List widget\nsend_event('account_count', { items: acctitems } )\n\nend\nend\n```\n. I wonder how often @get receives callouts from CoffeeScript code that isn't wrapped in pre-formatted text blocks...\nThis is an awesome idea for a widget -- it's like the Hotness Widget but with relative values instead of absolutes. I suggest taking a look at this code: https://gist.github.com/rowanu/6246149 ... Specifically, finding a way to set warm and cold dynamically based on previous values.\nPlease post back on this thread with any progress you make, I think I might take a crack at it as well.\n. I have a widget which submits data via HTTP POST, triggered by JavaScript in the user's browser -- it works fine for me.\nHow are you sending the request and what kind of response are you expecting back?\nThis is the response header that my jQuery.post happily accepts, resolving the Deferred:\nHTTP/1.1 204 No Content\nDate: Wed, 20 May 2015 00:43:35 GMT\nServer: thin\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\nContent-Length: 0\nConnection: close\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n. If this application thinks that a 204 means failure, it is not interpreting HTTP correctly. Please submit a support request to them, this is not an issue with Dashing.\nThank you and good luck with your issue.\n. If #div-id in that context refers to the div you want to scroll, the code you have written should work.\nHere is a simple CodePen which demonstrates the behaviour in simplified form:\nhttp://codepen.io/tylermauthe/pen/xGEEXE\nThis isn't specifically a problem with Dashing, please close this issue and ask the question on StackOverflow or similar. This is almost certainly caused by your CSS rules.\n. Dashing is listed in the most recent edition of ThoughtWorks' Tech Radar as being a technology in the \"Trial\" stage. It's wildly popular and extremely hackable, but there are many more requests for support than there are people to support it...\nThat being said, I won't let this project die if I can help it! I've gone on a bit of a triage spree this morning, trying to comment on whether I think PRs can be merged and asking for more info where required.\n@pushmatrix -- to clarify, when I say a PR could be merged I mean that the features do not have breaking changes and they seem desirable to me. I haven't actually done a merge of it myself and I am assuming the original authors did some level of testing.\nIt will take time to test each merge before accepting them, please bear with us.\n. In short, there isn't a pre-defined order. I suggest trying to implement your widget in such a way that it doesn't matter what order the events occur. For example, the Graph widget will only process the onData event if the @graph is initialised: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/blob/439182f3b91c6c3c0cb5b5c8f5bee2562cfff2d4/templates/project/widgets/graph/graph.coffee#L35.\nIf this is unreasonable or impossible, I suggest using a jQuery.Deferred to synchronise the asynchronous events.\nSomething like (untested):\ncoffeescript\n...\nlibraryLoading: $.Deferred()\nready:\n  @loadUpMyLibs();\n  // call this when all init completed (might need to go in callback if lib init is async.)\n  @libraryLoading.resolve();\nonData:\n  @deferred.done(@doMyStuff);\ndoMyStuff:\n  // some stuff\n...\nTo elaborate a bit on why there is no order...\nonData is fired when there is a message received from the SSE EventSource: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/blob/439182f3b91c6c3c0cb5b5c8f5bee2562cfff2d4/javascripts/dashing.coffee#L107-L115\nready is fired when the Batman.js view is 'ready': https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/blob/439182f3b91c6c3c0cb5b5c8f5bee2562cfff2d4/javascripts/dashing.coffee#L55-L56\nA Batman.js view is considered ready when \"the view's bindings have been initialized. The view may or may not be in the DOM.\" (http://batmanjs.org/docs/api/batman.view_lifecycle.html#ready)\n. Yeah, I had initially called it @deferred but decided @libraryLoading was a better name. Glad you were able to resolve your issue and thanks for closing this.\n. In your job file .rb, don't send the last: parameter:\nruby\nsend_event('valuation', { current: current_valuation })\n. Okay, I've incorporated all the feedback (I think) and I've squashed my commits.\nShould we let this stew for a day or two before merging the PR or just go for it?\n. Yeah, I like the way squash commits look because it shows the original history beneath the squash message -- but still shows up as one commit. Nice for fixing up PRs. I should have customised the squash message to be a summary of the squashed commits :+1:.\nI probably didn't even need to squash these... But squashing commits is so much fun! I use SVN on a day-to-day basis so I like to git it up as much as I can when I do.\n. It works fine for me when I freshly install Dashing on my Mac.\nPlease direct support requests to the Stack Overflow tag.\n. I answered this without being sure in #415 - this has prompted me to do some research. You can't open more because of browser limitations on simultaneous connections per hostname. Each Dashboard uses one persistent EventSource connection.\nwww.browserscope.org/?category=network\n. We set the history file on line 32 of app.rb:\nhttps://github.com/Shopify/dashing/blob/937fcce2dcca8010dbe8e9e26df954cb1330c1e0/lib/dashing/app.rb#L32\nNot sure if I would consider this a bug, but it would be quite easy to fix.\nShould be a sensible addition as long as it is added as an optional configuration parameter.\n. Duplicate of #498.\nmustache.js is not an adequate substitute for batman.\n. Duplicate of #592 ... :trollface: \n. Feel free to submit that fork as a pull request. Based on the way it is used in Dashing core, I don't upgrading it being an issue.\n. Thanks for creating this. No breaking changes that I can see.\nThis should be merged.\n. Not that I am aware of.\nIn order to be fully customizable, the backend is always written in (ruby) code. This is core to the philosophy of Dashing. It could certainly be a gem to extend Dashing, that'd be cool...\nThere are seceral cloud based alternatives with pre-baked integrations and nice UI to simplify things.\n. Please close this issue. Support requests like this should be directed to Stack Overflow from now on.\n. The JSON API could be improved in many ways, but I believe this would be better done through a Gem to extend dashing. 80% of Dashing use cases are satisfied by the current API.\nFor yourself, I would define a custom route in config.ru:\nruby\npost '/collectd/:id' do\n  # do something to make event data play nice with Dashing\n  normalized_event_data = normalize_event_data(request.body.read)\n  send_event(params['id'], normalized_event_data)\nend\n. If your OS doesn't have a JS Script Host then you may need to install one. Windows and OSX both have em, Linux often does not.\nThis is a fairly common source of trouble for newcomers to Dashing. If we included therubyracer in the default Gemfile for the template project, it would eliminate this problem -- but we wouldn't always be using your OS's native JS host. We would instead use the native V8 engine bundled with the gem.\n. Please direct support requests to Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dashing\n. This doesn't feel like it should be part of Dashing core, I'm not sure though. Chrome already supports this by entering \"Presentation Mode\" (under the View menu on OSX).\nI would suggest to implement this as a Widget instead. The widget wouldn't take up any space, but when added to a dashboard it would simply enter fullscreen mode when the page loads (no need to hit F).\n. I think what @pushmatrix is getting at is that Dashing is often run without a keyboard / mouse. So if you require user interaction, I don't think this fits into Dashing core.\nI went ahead and made the widget:\nhttps://gist.github.com/tylermauthe/75e70a7bc4ae7c237453\nBam! Feel free to leave feedback for the widget on that Gist.\n. Please direct support requests to Stack Overflow:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dashing\n. People are supposed to add their widgets to this list:\nhttps://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki/Additional-Widgets\nI don't see one in the list. Feel free to create one.\n. Thanks for that link, I think I'll use that as my init script :+1: \n. Please direct support requests to Stack Overflow.\n. Please direct support requests to Stack Overflow.\n. @pushmatrix - I believe that @nautilus28 wanted to use WebSockets in a job (on the server side). Dashing doesn't specifically support this, but you could easily write a job to pull data from a WebSocket and send it to a dashboard using something like websocket-ruby.\nThat being said, this is still a support request and it will get better assistance on Stack Overflow.\n. Dashing isn't designed very responsively, as the project was created to be run on TVs of a specific size.\nI guess you could throw a CSS zoom on the body to resize it.\nI think making Dashing resize more automagically via Responsive Design would be a cool feature though. Would that be something you'd be interested in?\n@pushmatrix -- What do you think about responsifying Dashing?\n. This is hard because you are not doing things the way Dashing intends you to.\nDashing jobs are supposed to PULL data into the widgets. The API is more for fun or the odd use case here and there -- it certainly should not be the main way that you pass data to widgets. If you are unable to query your test framework for data, then store it somewhere and poll that thing in your jobs. MySQL, redis, MongoDB or any other Data-storage system would work just fine.\nAlso, please close this issue and direct all future Support Requests to StackOverflow, as defined in the Contribution Guidelines. When you create an issue or pull-request, it is shown in a big yellow box above where you type the title.\n. Please direct support requests to Stack Overflow: stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dashing\n. Forcing a refresh, in my opinion, is a hack.\n. Well, I'm not sure that Dashing is really well suited for Dynamic Dashboards. Not without a lot of work.\nHowever, a component itself could be dynamic. This can be achieved by the component JS manipulating the DOM to create and remove tiles which represent the data.\nYou have only one component, but it dynamically generates tiles for each data point.\nI've been meaning to explore the possibility of creating a Meta-Component which comprehends lists of data-points compatible with other widgets. This would allow you to nest other components inside of the container and it would marshal the data automagically to update/create/delete sub-components. This should be possible, though it might not be as nice to use as I'm imagining.\n. I dunno, try asking on Stack Overflow.\n. Looks like a bug, I've committed a fix.\n. Sorry, this is not a bug. I jumped the gun and then cowboyed a pull request.\nYou should set some CSS on your widget to style it. Add a selector to the li tag around your widget and do something like this:\ncss\n.server-widget, .server-widget * {\n  color: white;\n  background-color: black !important;\n}\n. The data attribute is being set on the input element inside the widget, based on the widget's CSS colours. It is used by the jQuery Knob plugin to set the meter's colours.\nPlease close this issue if the solution works for you.\n. This is not a bug.\n. @pushmatrix - We should discuss this issue, something like React would probably minimise this kind of DOM-thrashing.\nEven if Batman doesn't have a memory leak, it definitely doesn't have anything like a Virtual DOM to minimise thrashing.\n@blaffoy - You can't really do that with the DOM, some JavaScript libraries (like React) get around this by having a Virtual DOM which is much faster and then only rendering what actually changed. Batman.js is likely re-rendering everything.\n. @agassner - We're investigating memory leaks in the client side.\n@pushmatrix - Maybe we should update Rufus to the latest? (#237)\n. - [ ] Add therubyracer gem in a sensible fashion to enable JS engine portability on Linux\n. Doing this helped me out, I was hitting memory caps on a Heroku free dyno: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki/How-To:-Prevent-a-job-from-overlapping-with-itself\nBased on some anecdotal testing of my own, I've become convinced that the memory leak I was experiencing was related to my jobs. If you're doing something like creating an array outside your job and filling it indefinitely during your job, you're going to have problems eventually. However, I couldn't find anything obvious like that -- though it may be that a library I was using does something like that.\n. Also: Sorry about the delays on Puma everyone, life happens. I took the work done in #427 and updated to the latest release here: https://github.com/tylermauthe/dashing/tree/puma_server\nI will endeavour to clean up the outstanding isues (outlined in #427) by the end of Feb.\n. Yeah, sorry about that. We've discussed adding a gem that would enable portability without needing to install a separate JS engine.\n@pushmatrix - This is something else for the todo list, adding therubyracer gem for JavaScript portability on Linux.\n. +1, this is an important issue\nBlocker for next release IMHO.\n. lol - no worries!\nGlad we got that sorted out, for a second I thought we might have to rewrite the thing in Perl 6 to resolve the issue!\n. Would you be able to put together a PR with your fixes?\nIt'd be much appreciated!\n. Awesome! Someone took a shot at this in #427 and I was going to find time to clean that up so it could be merged... but if you've got it going here that's great!\nI don't know that we want to start running the tests with JRuby though, I think the most common use case will still be to run dashing as a Ruby app. My understanding was that switching to Puma will allow us to run in a JVM as well as in a normal Ruby context -- is that correct?\n. At a glance, this looks great. I'll give it a more thorough look at lunch today and let you know if I find any issues. Also, any chance you've tried this on Windows?\nThis is amazing! I've been putting off doing this for ages, thanks so much!\n. Okay, I took a quick peak at this using the generated sample Dashing project -- it looks great. Exactly the behaviour I was hoping for. I thought it might be possible to specify the web server in the config.ru, but this is great!\nI'd like to do some testing to see what happens when you try to start Dashing as a daemon on Windows -- I suspect it fails because Windows doesn't implement fork(). I'd also like to make sure the changeset plays nicely with existing dashboards -- though I don't see how moving to Puma would affect them.\nI should be able to complete the rest of the testing tonight, so unless @pushmatrix finds any issues, we should be able to merge this sucker within the week. Thanks again!! :+1: \n. Yeah, I think the lack of Windows support for that is okay in this case. I believe that Thin didn't support it either:\nhttps://github.com/macournoyer/thin/blob/master/lib/thin/daemonizing.rb#L40\nWindows does not have the concept of a daemon in this sense, so it's okay that the feature doesn't work. It looks like Puma handles this gracefully as well:\nhttps://github.com/puma/puma/blob/33e0fa9999de17e85ed7e064d5f8ede8dc009014/lib/puma/launcher.rb#L73\nI tried this on Heroku and it is working fine so far, though I can't tell if it's actually using Puma -- I don't have a Procfile so I think it's just reading my config.ru and just plugging my code into whatever server is best for their dynos... I may try overriding this behaviour and see what happens.\nI was also able to try this locally with two dashboard applications, they both worked well with dashing start and dashing start -d. However, I was a little sad that the port number changed to 9292. I can live with this.\nThe only issue I've found is that the EventSource is producing constant errors and is essentially being cut off directly after the SSE call returns the first datapoint. This seems to be a problem with Puma itself:\nhttps://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/issues/1035\nThe issue was identified a long time ago in Puma and was essentially closed as \"won't fix\":\nhttps://github.com/puma/puma/issues/3\nSadly, I think that this may require changes to Sinatra to resolve the issue properly. However, I did find an interesting article wherein Aaron Patterson describes how he created a Server Sent Event class for use in Puma:\nhttp://tenderlovemaking.com/2012/07/30/is-it-live.html\nIt might be possible to use this technique to make it work for Dashing, since I am doubtful that Sinatra can be made to support this. The interface of the @io member in the SSE class would need to be adapted for Sinatra's Stream class. Alternatively, we could swap the EventSource for something like SockJS and just do xhr-streaming / long-polling -- not really ideal but it's an option.\n. This is a problem for lots of people, not just us! I've pinged the Sinatra team to see if they're cool with adding in a Puma adapter: https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/issues/1035#issuecomment-185582945\n. Hey, no worries at all on the SSE stuff -- I am so thankful for your assistance.\nWe can build in our own adapter until Sinatra fixes their Stream class. It could act as a proof of concept for the fix in Sinatra as well, as the adapter would essentially be a re-written copy of their Stream class which has support for EventMachine. This will require the creation of an adapter class which simply blocks the thread for the lifetime of the request. Puma's threading model should handle this gracefully, as proven by the Rails 4 implementation of SSE -- which doesn't rely on EventMachine since the switch to Puma.\nI'll see what I can whip up and try to submit a PR to somewhere. Thanks again for this work! :beers: \n. Okay, I was able to get this working without changes to Sinatra -- making use of the Stream class already provided in sinatra-contrib.\nI'll submit a PR to your PR as soon as I get the test working with the new connection style.\n. I am not sure how I feel about the fact that we now create a queue of events to send to each connection, this increases the memory requirements by at least 2 * connections * total size of history. To be fair, though, this should really only be a couple megabytes.\nAlso, when a connection is dropped we simply let this queue grow to 2 x the length of history and then remove it. I couldn't figure out how to actually respond to the disconnect event :-1:. Again, there's waste and also a chance that poorly performing connections will lose data. I would argue that naturally throttling poor connections is a good idea anyway and that the waste is kept small by the max queue size.\nIn any case, this is the best I've come up with. If it performs well, I am inclined to keep it. If anyone has improvements, especially in the above two areas, I greatly appreciate any and all feedback!\nLet's let this change stew for a while so we can test it thoroughly.\n. As I feared, my dashboard running on an old-school Heroku-free instance is completely unstable with my latest changeset. It was working fine with your changes @qbrossard, though the SSE was failing behind the scenes. It should be noted that the dashboard worked fine, but the browser JS console was strewn with errors and SSE reconnection attempts.\nI see this in the logs:\n2016-02-23T04:08:41.857508+00:00 heroku[web.1]: Process running mem=561M(109.6%)\n2016-02-23T04:08:41.857697+00:00 heroku[web.1]: Error R14 (Memory quota exceeded)\nI haven't tested this theory, but my guess is that the need to keep track of events on a per-connection basis combined with the ad-hoc mechanism for removing dead connections has increased the memory requirements too much.\nOptions I can think of:\n- Find a way to reduce the memory footprint of this change (write to disk, find connection ended event, be smarter, etc)\n- Switch to using a AJAX polling instead of an SSE (super lame)\n- Profile the actual memory difference in running applications -- do we actually care? (pretty lame too)\nHopefully someone else can think of a better idea because I'm not in love with any of those!\n. That is very odd, I can't reproduce the SSE errors when running locally or on Heroku. I only left the connection open for a few minutes though, perhaps it dies after some time?\nI'm starting to think that the memory problem is unrelated to my changes, but I haven't spent much time investigating this further.\nA more worrying aspect of this change is that running in JRuby actually causes scary errors:\n```\nscheduler caught exception:\nDetected invalid array contents due to unsynchronized modifications with concurrent users\norg/jruby/RubyArray.java:1113:in <<'\n/Users/tmauthe/.rvm/gems/jruby-9.0.4.0/gems/dashing-1.3.4/lib/dashing/app.rb:142:inblock in send_event'\norg/jruby/RubyHash.java:1343:in each'\n/Users/tmauthe/.rvm/gems/jruby-9.0.4.0/gems/dashing-1.3.4/lib/dashing/app.rb:138:insend_event'\n/Users/tmauthe/Developer/opensource/test_puma/jobs/buzzwords.rb:8:in block in (root)'\norg/jruby/RubyProc.java:318:incall'\n/Users/tmauthe/.rvm/gems/jruby-9.0.4.0/gems/rufus-scheduler-2.0.24/lib/rufus/sc/jobs.rb:229:in trigger_block'\n/Users/tmauthe/.rvm/gems/jruby-9.0.4.0/gems/rufus-scheduler-2.0.24/lib/rufus/sc/jobs.rb:204:inblock in trigger'\norg/jruby/RubyProc.java:318:in call'\n/Users/tmauthe/.rvm/gems/jruby-9.0.4.0/gems/rufus-scheduler-2.0.24/lib/rufus/sc/scheduler.rb:430:inblock in trigger_job'\n================================================================================\n```\nThis is happening because in one thread I'm appending objects to a data structure and in another thread I'm draining objects out of it.\nThis page has a fairly good breakdown of what options there are to solve this:\nhttps://github.com/jruby/jruby/wiki/Concurrency-in-jruby\nHopefully there is a clever way to avoid the need to share mutable data across threads as I have implemented. Sharing mutable data across threads is typically the most naive way to implement concurrency -- so maybe if inspiration strikes we can figure a smarter solution.\nThe trouble comes when we need to actually send events from the jobs. How can we ensure that the data acquired in the Rufus threads is shuttled out exactly once to all connections?\n. I took another stab at it:\nhttps://github.com/tylermauthe/dashing/tree/puma_webserver\nI'm going to let it run for a bit see how stable it is. So far, it's looking much better.\nI will submit another Pull Request as soon as I am done trying JRuby, Rubinius and MRI for a while. I would appreciate it if you could rebase the commits afterward to have a bit cleaner history. I'd do it myself, but I believe the owner of this Pull Request must do that.\nI realized that with EventMachine gone, Rufus was also free to spawn many threads -- send_event was being called simultaneously, so by adding a mutex there I was able to send the event directly to the stream instead of needing to queue it. This should drastically decrease the memory requirements.\n. Seems to be running quite stable. It's pretty fun to just crank up the MAX_THREADS and watch the sucker take off.\n. Oh, I just realized that I forgot synchronize access to the history.yml file. This isn't an issue on Heroku because there is no writable file system...\nI'll fix that up too.\n. Oh, sorry my commits could be squashed too. Especially the two that are fix and actually fix - hehe. Oh well!\nI am curious if anyone else has run this for any length of time? My dashboards are running fine with it...\n@qbrossard - Thanks again for all your work on this! It's been super helpful and it gave me the kick in the pants I needed to get it done.\nI think we could probably merge this now if you've given it the Shopify seal of approval @pushmatrix\n. +1 for the Puma branch -- makes sense to me. There are a lot of major changes and I know I don't have the time to deal with the fallout from the impact of those changes on thousands of dashboards in the wild.\nGood thing rubygems are easy to install from a branch :)\nhttps://github.com/gottfrois/dashing-rails - Runs on Rails 4, so that's another option for those looking to get Puma support from Dashing.\n. Looks good to me :+1: \nThanks a lot!\n. You need a JavaScript runtime of some sort, probably just install NodeJS. therubyracer gem is another option to look into.\nPrevious answer: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/issues/20\n. The problem is that Dashing relies on a history file to maintain persistence across restarts. Heroku filesystems are read-only.\nWhen your dyno idles down, because it's a free dyno, the contents of memory should be safe in the history.yml file -- but on Heroku they are nowhere.\nThis has been solved by some through a persistence layer like Redis or MySQL. IMHO, this isn't the use case of Dashing -- it is a service to pull data from other data stores and visualize it. If you'd like to use Dashing as a storage layer for your application, I suggest implementing the techniques described in #330.\nIn any case, if you'd like to add a cautionary note on the wiki, please do so. Thanks for the report!\n. Make the job collect an array of hashes with values for x and y...\nPlease close this and direct support requests to Stack Overflow.\n. It would be easy to fork that widget and make one that accumulates values in the client... However, you won't persist those values to the history unless you're passing an array to {{send_event}}. If the values aren't persisted to history and only in the client, they'll be lost when you refresh. I would recommend that you instead create an array inside your job and accumulate values in it and send them out to the clients. You might also want to think about whether that array should have a maximum size.\nThe default Convergence job implements the behaviour I am describing, out of the box with a fresh project:\nhttps://github.com/Shopify/dashing/blob/a4a4564f760bb1bcd541366186cd46488d5a569b/templates/project/jobs/convergence.rb\nI'm not sure why we want a more generic way to create arrays than what ruby provides. The upcoming release of Dashing under Puma is also multithreaded, so access to the collection in this generic function you're proposing would need to be synchronized. I don't want to do that, unless it's for a good reason.\n. Thanks for the shout out and all your work creating Dashing and making it the simple, yet powerful tool it is.\nDashing was the first Ruby project I took a real interest in and got involved with -- because I love data, Ruby and visualizations. The simplicity and readability of the source really showed me how elegant Ruby can be. It was immediately evident that this was a tool made with love by developers for developers.\nI'm happy to have been a part of the journey and I'm sure that Dashing will still enlighten a few as to the elegance of Ruby.\n. @micke2k I don't have enough time to spare for that sort of effort at the moment -- maybe in the future (unless someone beats me to it!)\n. Yay! Thanks. Happy to get more folks involved in Smashing.\nThe fork is mentioned at the top of the site, in yellow.\n\nOn Jan 20, 2017, at 12:13 AM, Alex Schwartz notifications@github.com wrote:\nGreat to hear that \"Dashing\" is lives on as \"Smashing\".\nI wonder, could this be told on the dashing.io website?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n.

My intent in commenting was to re-spark discussion around this. There are other issues that may be resolved by moving to Puma, so I think this is good even without providing jruby compatibility.\nBut the gem isn't going to be renamed... People are going to type gem install dashing :+1: \n. IMHO, this should read:\nDashing comes with a few re-usable widgets, which can be used as indicated above\n. Yeah, I am going through all the old PRs and trying to triage it a bit for the maintainer(s).\n. Also, I wasn't implying you had to be the one to make the updates -- just that these are the updates I recommend. Thanks!\n. If number has non-numeric digits, this function will assume it is a float.\nFor example: @parseValue(\"15px\") should return 15, but would return the float 15.0 instead.\nNot sure if this is a big deal, but it would be confusing if it happened and you weren't aware of this.

Each request gets a thread in the thread pool until Puma hits the max and multiplexes the threads. The loop is basically just \"keep the SSE request open until marked as terminated\".\nThe connection is marked as terminated in send_event when there is an exception caught when trying to send to a dead connection. send_even is triggered from Rufus -- which is multithreaded in Puma.\n. Yes, it signifies the out resource which we are injecting events into inside send_event.\n. I don't think so.

    "Fuzzwah": "As a newb who has spent a fair chunk of the last few days trying to get dashing up and running I concur massively.\n. Looking at the source of the samples page I noticed that there was reference to these two files (in layout.erb)\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/assets/application.js\"></script>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/assets/application.css\">\nI found that application.css actually lives in /assets/stylesheets/ but can only see /assets/javascripts/application.coffee and no application.js file.\nRefreshing the page I can see that at least the stylesheet is now applying (since there's no logic going on its ugly, but its not just grey now).\nAs I mentioned I'm a ruby newb, but I've gathered that a .coffee file can be compiled into a js file. I found an online compiler and attempted to convert both the application.coffee and dashing.gridster.coffee files into js's but this didn't work. Looking at them I can see that this conversion has missed out the require calls.\nTrying to get my head around how dashing works with out a working example is kind of rough :(\n. I figured that maybe using an online coffee script compiler wasn't the best idea, so I've downloaded and installed node.js and npm install'd coffee-script. I then tried compiling the .coffee files myself but that had the same exact output.\n. I gave up trying to get this working on windows.\n. I was using chrome and firefox. I could not get anything to display on the page when trying to host dashing on windows.\n. Yes. I've since given up trying to get dashing hosted on a windows box (and have no run into new issues viewing the dashes remotely from a windows box when hosted on linux).\nI can tell you this hasn't made me fall in love with ruby :(\n. I have been digging through other similar issue threads. I attempted to use coffee-script-source 1.4.0 as mentioned in https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/issues/79 but it didn't make any difference.\nI've also noticed that the sample install which is linked to seems to be doing the exact same thing I'm witnessing on my own fresh install. It has the layout, but no data.\nhttp://dashingdemo.herokuapp.com/sample\nI've tested both the demo page and my own fresh dashboard install using the lastest versions of Chrome and Firefox. Same issue everywhere.\nLittle help please? I no longer think this is just some rails newb issue I'm running into, but a larger issue with Dashing.\n. I've installed ubuntu desktop into a VM and run through the set up again. It all works when I'm running the brower on the local vm, but not when I try and view the page from another machine.\nI take it from the fact that the heroku demo exists at all, that at some stage it was expected that viewing a dashboard from a remote machine was meant to work. Is it that this \"feature\" has been broken somewhere along the lines?\n. I found a branch which mentioned remote views, but after installing it I'm still seeing the same thing.\nhttps://github.com/zsalzbank/dashing/tree/remote-views\n. I can successfully get to the site I'm working on (I use virtualbox and have NAT'd port 3030 through form the host OS to the guest). When I view the site locally from within the VM it works fine, /sample updates with its random numbers. But when I view from the host OS /sample has the layout, but no data.\nYour lab is exhibiting the exact same issue as I'm seeing.\n\n. Same thing is happening to the http://dashingdemo.herokuapp.com/sample page.\n. Unfortunately my current test bed isn't externally available over the web.\nAre you saying that http://dashingdemo.herokuapp.com/sample is working fine for you on Win8 + Firefox? Because it isn't for me (Win8 + Firefox 20.0.1). I have no plugs for Firefox installed (I normally use Chrome).\n\nI now have dashing running on the Ubuntu 12.04 LTS server again and can successfully view dashboards from the Ubuntu 13.04 desktop VM using Firefox (so it isn't an outbound firewall issue). However when I view it from Win8 with either Firefox or Chrome I don't see any data. I can confirm that the same lack of data updates happens if I disable the windows firewall.\n.

Just for completion and for anyone stubbing upon this at a later date, I wanted to add some more information I found.\nThe above works but it only compiles the assets at run time which means that although every subsequent visitor will have less to download, the first will have to wait for the execution of the compilation.\nTo get around this issue I created a Rake task to be run before deployment instead of at run time.\nRakefile\n``` Ruby\nrequire 'bundler'\nBundler.require\nnamespace :assets do\n  root = File.realdirpath('.')\n  sprockets = Sinatra::Application.settings.sprockets\n  outpath_prefix = File.join(root,'public',Sinatra::Application.settings.assets_prefix)\ndesc 'Compile assets'\n  task :precompile => [:clean, :compile_js, :compile_css] do\n    puts '*** Sucessfuly Precompiled'\n  end\ndesc 'Clean assets folder'\n  task :clean do\n    puts ' Cleaning compiled assets'\n    if File.exist?(File.join(outpath_prefix, 'javascripts/application.min.js'))\n      FileUtils.rm File.join(outpath_prefix, 'javascripts/application.min.js')\n      puts '* JS Removed'\n    end\n    if File.exist?(File.join(outpath_prefix, 'stylesheets/application.min.css'))\n      FileUtils.rm File.join(outpath_prefix, 'stylesheets/application.min.css')\n      puts '* CSS Removed'\n    end\n    puts ' Successfully cleaned assets'\n  end\ndesc 'Precompile JS assets for production'\n  task :compile_js do\n    puts ' Compiling js assets'\n    sprockets = Sinatra::Application.settings.sprockets\n    sprockets.js_compressor = Uglifier.new(:mangle => false)\n    asset = sprockets['application.js']\n    outpath = File.join(outpath_prefix, 'javascripts')\n    outfile = Pathname.new(outpath).join('application.min.js')\n    asset.write_to(outfile)\n    puts \" Successfully compiled js assets\"\n  end\ndesc 'Precompile CSS assets for production'\n  task :compile_css do\n    puts ' Compiling css assets'\n    sprockets.css_compressor = :scss\n    asset = sprockets['application.css']\n    outpath = File.join(outpath_prefix, 'stylesheets')\n    outfile = Pathname.new(outpath).join('application.min.css')\n    asset.write_to(outfile)\n    puts \" Successfully compiled css assets\"\n  end\nend\n```\nYou also have to remove the compilation from config.ru and add a map \"public\" so the assets can be served (For Heroku - explained later).\nconfig.ru\n``` ruby\nrequire 'dashing'\nrequire 'uglifier'\nuse Rack::Deflater\nmap \"/public\" do\n  run Rack::Directory.new(\"./public\")\nend\nmap Sinatra::Application.assets_prefix do\n  run Sinatra::Application.sprockets\nend\nrun Sinatra::Application\n```\nAlso remember to change the linking of your assets\nlayout.erb\n``` HTML+ERB\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Savill - Dashboard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      <%= yield %>\n    \n\n\n```\nHere is an example output:\n``` bash\n$ time rake assets:precompile --trace\n Invoke assets:precompile (first_time)\n Invoke assets:clean (first_time)\n Execute assets:clean\n Cleaning compiled assets\n* JS Removed\n* CSS Removed\n Successfully cleaned assets\n Invoke assets:compile_js (first_time)\n Execute assets:compile_js\n Compiling js assets\n Successfully compiled js assets\n Invoke assets:compile_css (first_time)\n Execute assets:compile_css\n Compiling css assets\n Successfully compiled css assets\n Execute assets:precompile\n*** Sucessfuly Precompiled\nreal    0m24.944s\nuser    0m0.015s\nsys     0m0.015s\n```\nAn added benefit to this is that due to the Rake Task name \"assets:precompile\" when you push your repo through to Heroku, it will automatically compile the assets.  This means you can keep you repository clean.  Your assets must be served from public/assets to trigger this rake task.\nGit push output\nbash\n-----> Running: rake assets:precompile\n(in /tmp/build_zcb9s9xpsi6z)\n*** Cleaning compiled assets\n*** Successfully cleaned assets\n*** Compiling js assets\n*** Successfully compiled js assets\n*** Compiling css assets\n*** Successfully compiled css assets\n*** Sucessfuly Precompiled\nAsset precompilation completed (32.78s)\nAs a final tip in compressing your assets, you can remove unused widgets from your source repository so that they do not get joined into the js/css file.  \nHope this saves any developers a few hours and any users a few seconds.\n.

There's a few ways to approach this but both I've suggested require getting your hands dirty with some basic Ruby and Coffeescript code. What I've written below also assumes you have some basic knowledge of how dashing jobs and widgets work.\n\n\nApproach 1\nThe simplest off the top of my head would be to get the server to send the current time to the clock widget every second.\n1. Create a job that takes the server current time and pushes it every second to the clients (using send_event)\n2. Change the clock widget to handle, format and render the datetime received from the server instead of the time taken from the local machine (the onData event might help here)\nNote that this is a very simplistic model and doesn't factor in latency from the server to the client so potentially could be a second or two out. Also if the server crashes time will appear to stop and this approach in general is pretty chatty.\nApproach 2\nMore advanced but I think is a better implementation: change the widget the make a request to the server when it loads to determine the offset of the local laptop time and the server time (also factoring in the time the request took).\n1. Modify the dashboard's sinatra app to expose a GET method that returns the current server time.\n2. Change the clock widget on the ready event to make a request to the server to receive the server time, persist the offset in the widget and then re-use the existing method of getting the time (that comes out of the box) but apply the persisted offset\nWith this model you could potentially make a web request to another 3rd party service that provides the current time instead of the dashing server. Also it might be good to schedule a request (using setInterval) to recalculate the offset to events where your operating system decides to resync the time with the time servers.\n. ",

Thanks for outlining the solution! https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki/Using-New-Relic-with-Dashing\n. Hello Sam, its hard to say (there are many ways to acomplish parsing that asp page => data => dashing)\nIt mostly depends on your ruby/coding skills, have you tried to find a compatible widget here?: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki/Additional-Widgets\nI often will start with their work, and built on it. \nThe pseudo-code would be (very basic)\n-pull data from conn1.aspx\n-parse columns and headers to generate an ordered list of data\n-push data to widget, the data is pushed to the widget with the same data-id\nDepending on how the data is generated the first 2 steps may be a bit different. For example perhaps the data comes from a csv or other data source, and this could just be used to push data to a widget . . .it depends on your resources :) Hope this helps!\n. Exactly, I think the best approach would be to create the connection to MongoDB with a separate app and send events to your dashboard using the API but you could also write a job similar to: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki/How-to:-send-mysql-data-to-your-widgets\n. Are you able to run other ruby or rails apps? What command are you running when you get an error?\n. Hmm, odd. What browser are you seeing this with? Since its working elsewhere, and for others, I would say this is not related to Dashing but more about the installation on the windows side or the browser accessing the server.\n. Hi @tithar our focus with gather issues is intended to look into problems with the code in Dashing and not troubleshoot installations. \nI can for sure ping a few more ideas over to solve this on your end possibly, but it doesn't seem to be an issue with the Dashing framework. \nI am thinking there is a problem with your specific installation on the Windows side. Have you been able to run other rails apps successfully? For example how are you managing gems? This may be one of the issues, and testing if another app works will point to the system libraries or your Dashing files as the next avenue to test.\nThe Dashing gem is only providing some basic framework which is used by (previously installed) libraries on your system to create the web server, render the templates, run the jobs etc.\nOnce you verify you have Ruby and Rails setup correctly this might help with some background info as they were able to resolve this by adjusting the file names in the installation: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/issues/324 \n. Hi Michael,\nIt sounds as if perhaps the widget and job are not aligned, they need to be using the same name to get the data so perhaps something has shifted when you installed the gist, or perhaps the gist requires more setup to actually send data.\nRunning the script specifically will return that error. SCHEDULER is initialized by the Dashing framework as a constant of Rufus scheduler to run jobs. Running just the job wouldn't include that as is done on line 4 and 11 here: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/blob/master/lib/dashing/app.rb#L11\nPerhaps adding those lines to your scriptname.rb might get it running to show what the issue is? Likely they are running fine and just not sending to a valid dashboard data-id\n. ",

    "poalcospe": "Worked for me as well thanks :+1: . Thanks for your quick reply :) \nI had a look at the issue #735 , and I tried to be as complient as possible with the environment used to resolve this issue. So first, I have downgraded 'roo' from 2.7 to 2.1 for being able tu run gem 'roo', '~> 2.1.0' in my Gemfile. Then I've modified the sample.rb below: \n``` ruby\nrequire 'roo'\nrequire 'roo-xls'\nSCHEDULER.every '2s', :first_in => 0 do |job|\nfile_path = \"#{Dir.pwd}/spreadsheet.xls\"\ndef fetch_spreadsheet_data(path)\n  s = Roo::Excel.new(path)\n  send_event('valuation',   { current: s.cell(1, 2) })\nend\nmodule Handler\n  def file_modified\n    fetch_spreadsheet_data(path)\n  end\nend\n```\nI don't know which one of both modification resolved this, but anyway, I don't have any exception running 'dashing start' now. \nHowever, nothing is displayed in my dashboard. I have the following code in my sampletv.erb:\n<li data-row=\"1\" data-col=\"7\" data-sizex=\"1\" data-sizey=\"1\">\n      <div data-id=\"valuation\" data-view=\"Number\" data-title=\"Current Valuation\" data-prefix=\"$\"></div>\n</li>\nAm I doing something wrong with this part ? . No it's not the only widget displayed on my dashoard. Here is my complete sampletv.erb:\n```html\n\n$(function() {\n  // These settings override the defaults set in application.coffee. You can do this on a per dashboard basis.\n   Dashing.gridsterLayout('[{\"col\":2,\"row\":1,\"size_x\":1,\"size_y\":1},{\"col\":1,\"row\":1,\"size_x\":0,\"size_y\":0},{\"col\":3,\"row\":1,\"size_x\":1,\"size_y\":1},{\"col\":4,\"row\":1,\"size_x\":1,\"size_y\":1},{\"col\":1,\"row\":2,\"size_x\":1,\"size_y\":1},{\"col\":2,\"row\":2,\"size_x\":2,\"size_y\":1},{\"col\":4,\"row\":2,\"size_x\":1,\"size_y\":1}]')\n  Dashing.widget_base_dimensions = [370, 340]\n  Dashing.numColumns = 5\n});\n\n<% content_for :title do %>1080p dashboard<% end %>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n```\nI am running dashing; by the way, what is smashing exactly compare to dashing ?. Ok, I know why it didn't display any value. I've forgotten one line in the .rb file. Now it's \"almost\" good. \nI can display values but only with line under 9. For exemple, s.cell(8,2,s.sheets[1]) will work but s.cell(9,2,s.sheets[1]) won't. The table has 11 lines, so basically I can display values for lines between 1 and 8, but not between 9 and 11. \nDo you knwo if there is any limitation regarding this ?. Looking for the same tooltip. Any solution found ?. ",

I got it working with these values:\nDashing.widget_base_dimensions = [290, 270]\n  Dashing.numColumns = 5\nThe problem now is only the \"meter\" widget don't get the correct size (height) and overlaps with the other widgets in the same column. \"List\", \"Text\" and \"Number\" have the correct size and fit well. Is there a way to fix this?\n\nI don't know Ruby, I'm using bash+curl and python to send data to the widgets.\nThank you.\n. setting data-width to 100 reduces the size of the circle but not of the widget itself:\n\n. Thank you for the answers.\n@derwin12 where do you exactly put the .widget-list sintax inside the erb file? It works for me if I set it in the /widgets/list/list.scss file but not in the .erb itself.\nIn my opinion it would be a better choice to set the font size per-list instead of per-widget type. In my dashboard some lists have many items other just a few so different font sizes would fit.\nI tried to put this above the  in the erb file but it doesn't work:\n.widget-list {\nli { \n  margin-bottom: 5px;\n  font-size: 4px; \n}\nI'm sorry if my questions look too basic but I quite new to this sintax.\nThank you @davefp for the kind support.\n.

    "pablo808": "Thanks. I am not familiar on how to activate a duplicated widget.  I made a copy of the widget directory from list to listK. \nIn the .erb file I added:\n<li data-row=\"1\" data-col=\"1\" data-sizex=\"2\" data-sizey=\"2\">\n     <div data-id=\"status\" data-view=\"ListK\" data-unordered=\"true\" data-title=\"Status\" data-moreinfo=\"Status Report\"></div>\n  </li>\nThis is a great project and thanks for the support.\n.

See a similar request was posted https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/issues/11 although not for this specific masonry library but rather a responsive dashboard. Another reason I would like to see something like isoptope or a similar masonry layout used is when a widget is hidden/filtered the dashboard layout is dynamic. If you hide a widget with css in gridster,you have an empty spot in the dashboard where the widget use to be. I would like to show/hide widgets sometimes based on their status.\n.

    "kaltinril": "Is this still an issue?  Was it ever resolved?  Can we remove this from the gem file configuration?\n. The inherit design appears to be, to change the data-sizex and data-sizey values in the dashboard.erb file for the specific items you want to change.\n. As long as you want it after every single line (Including the last line) its pretty simple.\nin your dashboard directory, edit list.html:\n- /dashboard/widgets/list/list.html\nAdd the  just before the List Item ending \n. One approach is to dynamically build up the yourdashboard.erb file (located in the dashboards directory) by adding new LI and DIV elements.  You could do this many ways, but one way would be from a yourdashboard.rb file (located in the jobs directory).\nThen in the layout.erb file (Located in the dashboards directory),  you could add in a refresh HTML code to have it refresh the HTML so that new widgets added will show up without requiring a user to hit F5 on their keyboard to refresh the page to see the new widget.  This is a fairly low tech way, there are probably better alternatives, but if no one else replies at least you have 1 option.\nCode to add to Layout.erb in the  section:\n<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"60\" />\n. Not sure what you mean @tylermauthe .  I did exactly as I stated and I've written code that dynamically builds up the dashboard based on comma delimited text files that are parsed.  Each one is assumed to be a widget, and the type and contents are inside the file.  This works great for us.\nI'm not sure what you mean by Persistence layer?\n. Ah gotcha thanks @tylermauthe , that makes sense.  I must have missed that part of the original request :)\nWe wanted a way to be able to \"fire and forget\", and not require development of the dashboard whenever we wanted a new widget to be displayed.\nSo we wrote code to dynamically build up the erb file, based on the contents of files in a directory.  (I will have to look into HAML/ERB).  The files can be dropped by anything (manually, via automation tools external to dashing, etc.  This means that dashing has no fingers or permissions into databases, applications, processes etc.\nOur automation tool generates files everytime specific automations run.  The file contains the details for the widget, along with the data.\nThe rb file parses the files and creates the .erb file.\nAgain, this is just what worked well for us so we could setup Dashing, and never touch it again.\n. Stick your code into a .rb file in the jobs directory and call send_event passing the value to the object.\nsend_event('uniqueDataIdName', {text:$revision})\nNOTE: You will need to bounce your DASHING (thin) server so that the new .rb code runs.\nuniqueDataIdName has to match the value set in the .erb file that contains the data-id/widget instance, so the Div row.\nExample code for adding the text widget.\n<li data-row=\"1\" data-col=\"1\" data-sizex=\"1\" data-sizey=\"1\">\n      <div data-id=\"uniqueDataIdName\" data-view=\"Text\" data-title=\"Git Version\" data-text=\"0\" data-moreinfo=\"anything you want to say\"></div>\n    </li>\n. .rb files are running (usually) all the time in the scheduler (rufus-scheduler), and wouldn't be looking to accept input as a pass in.\nOne way would be to perhaps write to a data or intermediate file to \"pass\" the value.  You could setup your .rb file to check that file for parameter changes, then do its thing that way.\n. Thank you for the suggestion Kevster.\nNot that easy:\nI wish it was that easy.I already tried multiple different ways.  I am asking here for an official Ruby, Dashing, or Thin server methodology for running the process as a service, so a user is not required to remain logged in.  This seems like a core part of a dashboard tool, to be always running.\nWhy won't a straight SC command work?\nYeah, I can ADD any command I want to the Windows Services with that:\n- sc create fakeService binPath= \"anyrandomtext\"\nHowever, that doesn't mean you can start the service once you've created it.  All sorts of errors come up. if you try to run dashing start, or create a batch file and run that.  Or call cmd.exe and then dashing or your batch file.  None of them work because they are not designed to interact with the windows services.\nIf you give me an exact command that you know works, I will gladly use it.\nWhat I've tried:\n\nsc create testService binPath= \"dashing start\"\nsc create testService2 binPath= \"start.bat\nsc create testService3 binPath= \"cmd.exe /C start.bat\"\nsc create testService4 binPath= \"cmd.exe /C ruby.exe dashing start\"\nsc create testService4 binPath= \"cmd.exe /C ruby.exe dashing.rb start\"    (After renaming dashing to add .rb to the file)\n\nAlternatives:\nThe only alternative is to install and run something like NSSM (Non-Sucking Service Manager), or a batch to exe converter.  Which I would prefer not to have to do.\n. Ah, alright, thank you, I'll play with the routes and see if I can get it to do all subfolders, recursively.\n. I tried adding the suggestion to the config.ru and editing the app.rb file, but all it seems to do is add a folder path to the URL, and screw up the data so the data is no longer showing for the widgets.\nI do not know anything about sinatra, and Ruby is still pretty foreign to me as well.\nThe page used to be served like this:   site:3030/simple\nNow the page is served like this:  site:3030/dashboards/simple/simple\nSeems like it just added folders to the URL, but thats it.\nAlso, it destroyed the Data.\n. Sorry I edited dashing.rb apparently.  However, trying app.rb (Which is in a different gem sub folder for ruby), doesn't seem to work either.\nThere are 2 folders:\nc:\\ruby193\\lib\\ruby\\gems\\1.9.1\\gems\\dashing-1.3.4\\lib\\dashing\\app.rb\nc:\\ruby193\\lib\\ruby\\gems\\1.9.1\\gems\\dashing-1.3.1\\lib\\dashing.rb\n. I tried y our code Floppy and can get it most of the way working.   However, it says \"Drats!....\" inside each widget.  Indicating that even though it is correctly parsing the subdirectories, its somehow not correctly rendering the widgets.\n. ",

It's keeping everything nice and separated, and uses gulp and browserify to compile all the resources into something that can be uploaded to a webserver. \nIt's available here:\nhttps://github.com/Iperity/Dashing-browser\n. I'm not saying that this solution will work for everybody, but we have chosen to solve a similar problem as following:\n- Real-time data  is published on an XMPP api through pubsub. (running ejabberd)\n- The XMPP api is also exposed through BOSH (so it can be accessed from browsers.)\n- We are using a browser-only version of Dashing. (I've actually just put the source up on Github. ) This also uses browser-side jobs for data gathering.\n- These in-browser dashing jobs connect to the XMPP api using the Strophe.js library. They only subscribe to the pubsub-nodes that are relevant to them.\nAdvantages:\n- This moves the problem of scalable data-distribution to XMPP. XMPP has been designed with scalable data-distribution in mind.\n- We avoid some headaches with having Dashing / Batman deal with different data for different users on the server-side. Instead, we use an existing client-side javascript framework to deal with authorisation and authentication. The jobs only need to know with what authentication data to subscribe to which nodes.\n- Coming from a situation where the XMPP-infrastructure was already in place, it saves us from having to deploy and maintain another piece of infrastructure (the dashing server). The current solution can run from any webserver serving static files to clients. \n. ",

We ended up integrating the Express app with dashing js  and using the existing primus library for both.\nIt was pretty straight forward. The clients connect to specific channels for each widget. As an example for the 'welcome'  text widget:\n\nprimus = Primus.connect()\nwelcome = primus.channel('welcome')\nwelcome.on \"data\", (event) ->\n   Dashing.widgets.welcome[0].receiveData event\n\nand the jobs on the server just need to use primus instead of batman:\n\nwelcome.write({text: data });\n\n.

This thread solved the data reloading on a refresh.\nHowever, I also have code that changes the background color, color works on initial load but not after a manual refresh. Once the scheduler picks up the job x mins later the color is back.\nthanks.\n. I found this thread & it solved the color problem\nhttps://github.com/Shopify/dashing/issues/423\n. sorry for the massive delay in replying.  Thank you so much for your help, I was able to get this completed as a result.\n. Thanks for the help.\nYes, I tried the Klimato widget and it does work but it is rather large for my purposes.  I'm at least glad I wasn't missing anything simple with the weather widget. I'll split it in to 3 for my purposes.\nthanks again.\n. Thank you for your help. I've got it working!\n. this just fixed it for me! thanks.\n. Oh for goodness sake as soon as I posted this I figured it out....my widget background was defaulted to black. I added a background-color tag to my .erb file to change the colour and I'm all set.\n. can you try using http://www.cnn.com in your curl command.  If that works I think you are running in to a limitation with iframe, it does not play well with https:// \nAlso make your widget bigger if you want it full screen-ish\nli data-row=\"1\" data-col=\"1\" data-sizex=\"5\" data-sizey=\"5\"\n. Crickets? :-)\n. Playaround with the following in your .erb\ndata-sizex=\"1\" data-sizey=\"1\"\nIncreasing the values will make that particular widget larger.\n. I'm not following.\nin your dashboard.erb file have the one widget that you want full screen and scale up the data-sizex and data-sizey values.\nIs this not what you want?\n. how about control +  in the browser to scale it up a bit so it fits?\n. I worked around this by using the excel 'round' command\nhttp://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/round-function-HP010062455.aspx\n. Thanks for your info.\nI'd fuddled about a little with a similar idea previously (so mediocre minds think a like ;-) Alas on paper it looks like it might work but the best variation of this method I found only managed to add the text 'agentsurvey' to the widget.\nI'll revisit when time permits as it seems like this should be possible, if not a feature request. I'll post back if I ever resolve it.\n. I fuddled about last week trying to update to font-awesome 4.xxx. I only succeeded in breaking 3.xxx ;-)\nWatching with interest.....\n. I'll give it a bash today....urm, where is it exactly? :-)\n. Thank you, installed and working perfectly.  I really appreciate your effort.\n. Not sure if this is it but those 2 widgets are occupying the same spot on the dashboard.\n. I found the root of my problem.  I had updated Font-Awesome, 'icon-arrow-up' needed to be changed to 'fa fa-arrow-up'\n@tylermauthe thank you for your help.\n. I have resolved my own issue.  Sloppy coding in the .rb file.\nI was opening the the excel file for every send event (and there are many).\nBad:\nSCHEDULER.every '25s', :first_in => 0 do |joC|\ns = Roo::Excel.new(\"/home/administrator/manchvegas/xls/newcases.xls\")\nsend_event('csatmonth', {current: s.cell('H',19)})\ns = Roo::Excel.new(\"/home/administrator/manchvegas/xls/newcases.xls\")\nsend_event('csatyear', {current: s.cell('I',19)})\nGood:\nSCHEDULER.every '25s', :first_in => 0 do |joC|\nfile_path = \"#{Dir.pwd}/xls/newcases.xls\"\ndef fetch_spreadsheet_data(path)\n  s = Roo::Excel.new(path)\nsend_event('csatmonth', {current: s.cell('H',13)})\nsend_event('csatyear', {current: s.cell('I',19)})\n. thanks @tylermauthe I will check that out.\n. Hi, I'm sorry I can't help here but I am interested to know which widget you are using to display a spreadsheet.\nthanks\n. @sash85 thanks! Please post a link here.\n:-)\n. Not sure about embedding the actual javascript but have you looked at the news widget as an alternative?\nhttps://gist.github.com/toddq/5422482\n. It's that time again. Thanks for making the update...where can I grab the files from :)?\n. you look to be trying to run two instances of dashing on the same port (3030)\ntry this for the 2nd command. \ndashing start -p 3031\n. take a look in your widgets html file, you probably have something set there restricting the value.\ntry this line in place of your value\n<h2 class=\"value\" data-bind=\"current | prepend prefix | append suffix\"></h2>\n. did you see this?\nhttps://github.com/Shopify/dashing/issues/271. I have this working...can you post your sample.rb & Gemfile please.\nWhat version of excel is the file created in & what is its file extension xls,xlsx, xlsm etc?\n. I'll assume that an xls file created in LibreOffice is 100% compatible with this solution, I use this method with Excel created files.\nAdditionally I'm assuming that you have read/write permissions to the location of your xls file.\nMake a backup of your smashing folder. \nNow replace the contents of your Sample.rb with the following:\nCopy from below this line\nrequire 'roo'\nrequire 'roo-xls'\nSCHEDULER.every '2s', :first_in => 0 do |job|\nfile_path = \"#{Dir.pwd}/THIS_IS_THE_PATH_LOCATION_TO_THE_XLS_FILE/YOUR_FILENAME.xls\"\ns = Roo::Excel.new(path)\nsend_event('valuation', { current: s.cell ('B',49) })\nend\nmodule Handler\ndef file_modified\nfetch_spreadsheet_data(path)\nend\nend\nto above this line\nAdd the next 2 lines to your Gem file\ngem 'roo', '~> 2.1.0'\ngem 'roo-xls'\nAt the command line run (without the quotes) \"bundle\"\nCheck for errors...if you have any post them back to this thread. Otherwise, start your dashboard.....fingers crossed.\n. you're getting close...\nI'm not on a system I can test this but I think there is a formatting problem, aka something got muddled with the copy and paste.  Replace send_event('valuation', { current: s.cell ('B',49) })\nwith \nsend_event('valuation', { current: s.cell ('B',49) })\nYeah I know it looks exactly the same but humor me..... I'll take a closer look tomorrow and post back.... sorry for the delay. Try this line in your .rb file instead of the line that is there.  I had eyeballed my own job file with multiple cells in one 'send_event', needed to tidy that up.\nsend_event('valuation', {current: s.cell('B',49)}). yes exactly.\nin what directory is your excel file?  Wherever that is you need to replace what I have written in CAPITAL letters with it.\ne.g.\n/home/howardsternisbatman/myfile.xls\n. if you are asking me is that path as you have written it is correct for you, the answer is no.  I'm sensing you are not familiar with Linux's file/folder structure.  You need to read up on it since where you are stuck now has nothing to do with Smashing.\nThis might help\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/117435/htg-explains-the-linux-directory-structure-explained/\nYou're close, solve the file path and you should be all good.. I have my xls located in\n/home/howardsternisbatman/mydashboard/xls/myfile.xls\nAs long as the file is somewhere within the dashboard file structure I don't see why this wouldn't work.. Take a look at this thread https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/issues/735 I suspect the sample.rb and instructions you followed are a little out of date.. Before we go any further, is that all you have in the sampletv.erb?  Do you have any other widgets showing aka the sample.erb dashboard contains the following\n`<% content_for(:title) { \"My super sweet dashboard\" } %>\n\n\n\n\n\n<li data-row=\"1\" data-col=\"1\" data-sizex=\"1\" data-sizey=\"1\">\n  <div data-id=\"valuation\" data-view=\"Number\" data-title=\"Current Valuation\" data-prefix=\"$\"></div>\n</li>\n\n\n`\nLastly are you running dashing or smashing?\nthanks. Good to hear that you are past the initial problem.  See my previous post with links to Smashing & Dashing, you'll find out what that is all about.\nAs for your new problem, that's beyond the scope of this thread and most likely smashing.  Have a read of the roo documentation http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/roo/2.5.1  Personally I haven't accessed a spreadsheet table in this manner only individual cells. I've used the hotmeter widget and got this this close to what you are looking to doing. Maybe take a look at that widget and lift what you need.\n\n. can you share your code?. ",

You need to handle those cases.\nFor example, in my meter widget I was getting the value from a file. And sometimes the value would be empty and I would get the above error because I was doing value.to_i\nI changed my code to do this instead and it fixed those errors.\nif value.nil?\n  # assign default\n  value = -1\nend\noutput = value.to_i\n. Found a solution myself. Closing it.\n. Scratch that, I found a even better solution. \nThis is what I did:\nCreate .js files that create your graphs. See the rickshaw link above to get an idea. The .js and supporting rickshaw .js files need to be physically in 'public' folder of dashing or create a soft link in 'public' folder.\nCreate the erb file in 'dashboards' folder. Call you script and css's in the erb, just like you do in html. Now, to embed graphs as widgets call your .js from within \n<li>\n</li>\nI will try to post an example sometime. \n. ",

Lastly, I created a new file called Procfile in my Dashing app's root folder:\nweb: bundle exec passenger start -p $PORT --spawn-method conservative\nThat's it - with that complete, I pushed the new code to Heroku and saw the app run immediately.\nReference: http://blog.crowdint.com/2013/11/07/improving-the-performance-of-a-heroku-app-with-passenger.html\n.

Hey, just wanted to give an update here in case you're still having issues. It seems that the single heroku dyno was just very slow at processing and sending events. So, if it loaded, it would take a few minutes. I ended up switching to running passenger instead of thin and it works great now! just add 'passenger' to the Gemfile and something along the lines of:\nweb: bundle exec passenger start -p $PORT --spawn-method conservative\nin your Procfile\n.

    "varunsrin": "+1 for this issue, I haven't found a workaround yet\n. @tylermauthe I think being able to define the axes optionally is good - it adds a bit of flexibility that enables a lot of use cases. \nFor example, we want to display a graph of visitors to site over time, but its a little annoying that the y-axes won't just display the hours but insists on being 1, 2, 3 ... 24. \n. Actually, this is happening on a paid instance with two dynos. \nThe other aspect to the problem is that the timeouts seem completely unrelated to the reboots - ive seen timeouts happen for a few hours before a reboot kicks in, so I think they may be two separate issues now. \nWhat I noticed that's interesting is that Heroku Metrics don't work claiming that two or more dynos are needed to run Metrics, even though the dyno page says there are two 1x dynos running and is billing us $34/month for it. \nThis is my first Sinatra deployment on Heroku, is there anything specific that needs to be configured to get the dashing server to utilize both dynos?\n. Further investigation:\n- Disabling GitHub authentication had no impact\n- The rufus 503's were a red herring, that was a separate issue that I fixed\n- Installed New Relic, but all transactions in New Relic average 300 ms, with the highest being 2k ms. Nothing in New Relic indicates the cause of the H12 errors - in fact, I can't even see any request queueing that takes that long. \nBut I'm still seeing frequent H12 timeout events in the heroku logs that return a 503 with a 30,000 ms wait time. This happens whenever I have any dashboard open.\nI'm assuming that the request is being passed on to my server and Sinatra+Thin are not sending a response back to Heroku routers in < 30s.  \nI'm a little surprised that these long running events are not showing up in New Relic - I'm not very familiar with Sinatra, but I'm going to keep looking into this.... \n. So here's what I've seen so far: \n- I've been using Cedar (have seen some H15 errors occasionally, which are cedar specific) \n- Heartbeat event has not helped\n- Scaling dynos from 1 -> 2 has not helped at all \n- Adding rack-timeout (15s) didn't trigger any timeout exceptions on the dynos\nI think the request is getting lost somewhere between the heroku router and the dyno, because otherwise I'd expect rack-timeout to be raising exceptions. \nI don't fully understand the client-server pattern for how events work in dashing, going to dig into that more today.... perhaps there's something in there that I'm missing. \nI'm copying a few lines over from the latest logs to give you an idea of frequency \n10:50:11.365 2015-01-23 18:50:10.928346+00:00 app web.1 - - 23.4.18.10/b-34-5-68-10.hdf1.ca.comcast.net - - [23/Jan/2015 18:50:10] \"GET /events HTTP/1.1\" 200 - 46.9910\n\u00bb 10:50:14.581 2015-01-23 18:50:14.256238+00:00 app web.1 - - source=rack-timeout id=c7a15979-77a8-40ee-b2e8-8f784b1b36c8 wait=4ms timeout=15000ms state=ready at=info\n\u00bb 10:51:01.180 2015-01-23 18:51:00.839525+00:00 heroku router - - at=error code=H12 desc=\"Request timeout\" method=GET path=\"/events\" host=foo.bar.com request_id=c7a15979-77a8-40ee-b2e8-8f784b1b36c8 fwd=\"23.4.18.10/b-34-5-68-10.hdf1.ca.comcast.net\" dyno=web.1 connect=1ms service=46582ms status=503 bytes=1387 CriticalHigh Response Time\n\u00bb 10:51:01.265 2015-01-23 18:51:00.838959+00:00 app web.1 - - 23.4.18.10/b-34-5-68-10.hdf1.ca.comcast.net - - [23/Jan/2015 18:51:00] \"GET /events HTTP/1.1\" 200 - 46.5814\n\u00bb 10:51:04.382 2015-01-23 18:51:04.074732+00:00 app web.1 - - source=rack-timeout id=ca31ccf4-626a-4f88-bddd-318172b5baad wait=7ms timeout=15000ms state=ready at=info\n\u00bb 10:51:51.235 2015-01-23 18:51:50.847724+00:00 app web.1 - - 23.4.18.10/b-34-5-68-10.hdf1.ca.comcast.net - - [23/Jan/2015 18:51:50] \"GET /events HTTP/1.1\" 200 - 46.7719\n\u00bb 10:51:51.452 2015-01-23 18:51:50.842524+00:00 heroku router - - at=error code=H12 desc=\"Request timeout\" method=GET path=\"/events\" host=foo.bar.com request_id=ca31ccf4-626a-4f88-bddd-318172b5baad fwd=\"23.4.18.10/b-34-5-68-10.hdf1.ca.comcast.net\" dyno=web.1 connect=3ms service=46769ms status=503 bytes=1387 CriticalHigh Response Time\n\u00bb 10:51:54.393 2015-01-23 18:51:54.085162+00:00 app web.1 - - source=rack-timeout id=c848edc5-086c-4fab-a8f5-527a33d64ca3 wait=9ms timeout=15000ms state=ready at=info\n\u00bb 10:52:41.777 2015-01-23 18:52:41.457082+00:00 app web.1 - - 23.4.18.10/b-34-5-68-10.hdf1.ca.comcast.net - - [23/Jan/2015 18:52:41] \"GET /events HTTP/1.1\" 200 - 47.3707\n.

We use a combination of the aforementioned gist and PR #306 (purely to keep things organized).\nPretty straightforward:\ndashboards\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 layout.slim\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 department1\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 dash1.slim\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 dash2.slim\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 department1.slim\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 department2\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 dash1.slim\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 dash2.slim\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 department2.slim\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 company.slim\ndepartment1.slim, department2.slim, [...departmentN.slim] and company.slim are all aggregating dashboards. For example (company.slim):\n``` slim\nscript type=\"text/javascript\"\n  |\u00a0Dashing.on('ready', function() {\n  |   Dashing.cycleDashboards({timeInSeconds: 60});\n  | });\n== Slim::Template.new('dashboards/department1/dash1.slim').render\n== Slim::Template.new('dashboards/department1/dash2.slim').render\n== Slim::Template.new('dashboards/department2/dash1.slim').render\n== Slim::Template.new('dashboards/department2/dash2.slim').render\n```\nWe can trigger individual dashboards (e.g. /department1/dash1) as well as aggregating ones (e.g. /department1). At this point you could add per-request control (e.g. /company?dashboards=department1/dash2,department2/dash1) via a parameter like so:\n```\nscript type=\"text/javascript\"\n  |\u00a0Dashing.on('ready', function() {\n  |   Dashing.cycleDashboards({timeInSeconds: 60});\n  | });\n\n(params[\"dashboards\"] || \"\").split(\",\").each do |dashboard|\n  == Slim::Template.new(\"dashboards/#{dashboard.gsub(/(../)+/, '')}.slim\").render\n```\n\nNote: better escaping of dashboard is necessary. Example is purposely simplistic for brevity.\n. ",

See here.\nSwitching to websockets should overcome the issue.\n.

It's usually shifted up compared to the others, and the next list item is usually on top of it.  If I change the layout by dragging the widgets around, get them where I want them, and then save the layout (by updating the dashboard layout), it ignores the new layout.  I've tried creating a new dashboard using just the example dashboard, and the issue doesn't appear.  Could it be an issue with a job that's changing something?\n. I wondered if it was the Progress Bars widget (that's usually the first list item element in my layout), but if I remove that widget from the layout, it just puts whatever the next list item is in the same spot, not lined up where it should be.\nI tried creating a new dashboard entirely, and looking at the samples that come with it, and they seem fine.  I've diffed the files between the two and don't see anything out of the ordinary.\nHere's another screen shot of the issue:\n\nYou can see that, in this case, there are literally 6 widgets stacked on top of each other.  Two of them are not aligned correctly.  You can see that the big one (a 2x2) and one 1x1 widget are shifted towards the top of the page a bit and not in an actual gridster grid.  If I move them, they will snap in to the grid.  Furthermore, I have the Dashing.gridsterLayout function at the top of my layout, and it's completely ignoring that.\n. Here's one of the .erb files I have.  I've scrubbed it a bit.  I guess I didn't know it was a font issue, but I suppose that could be the case.  I'll do a bit of tweaking and see if I can fix it.\n```\n<% content_for :title do %>Some interesting site<% end %>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n``\n. I tweaked some of the font sizes, but that didn't seem to work.  The first widget in the list is always incorrectly aligned, unless I drag it in to the grid.\n. I did more digging, and found that if I switched the data-row and data-col properties in theelements (i.e. data-col first and data-row second) it works and the layout is correct every time the page is reloaded.  I have no idea why the ordering of those would make a difference, but it seems like it does.  Even in the sample dashboards, which have always worked for me, they are set up as row first, column second.\n. And I just realized that there's a typo in my .erb files.  The first twoelements have their first property nameddata_rownotdata-row`.  An UNDERSCORE not a DASH.\n. ",

    "headius": "I don't see why dashing wouldn't work in JRuby, but the gem depends on thin as its server :-( If it just used puma, dashing could probably work out of the box.\n. Relates to #417, obviously :-)\n. I now have a JRuby Dashboard running with this modified version of Dashing, released as dashing-jruby: http://jruby-dashboard.herokuapp.com/sample\nSure would be nice to make it standard dashing :-D\n. @kevster Ahh \"dashing start\" must be trying to start thin directly. Will check.\n. Ahh yes, dashing start/stop require that the server be able to daemonize, which can't be done through usual Ruby mechanisms on JRuby. I'm looking at doing something with nohup instead.\n. I've pushed an additional change that removes \"stop\" and makes \"start\" use puma. Because there's no daemonizing on JRuby, start just launches the server and waits for it. I did not rig up something with nohup since it wouldn't work on e.g. Windows (not sure if that's a concern, since I don't think thin/em were reliable on Windows).\nI'm pushing dashing-jruby 1.3.4.1 with this change.\n. I didn't do anything special. The https://github.com/jruby/jruby-dashboard repository is everything.\n. Sorry that I missed the replies in November...busy time for JRuby.\nI've commented on the source comments you provided and I'm looking into ways to spawn puma rather than starting it as a blocking child process. I think the best option will be to use nohup and puma's management interface to spawn and manage the subprocess, but I don't know what the equivalent would be on Windows. I'm also not sure how important Windows support is, since it appears there hasn't been a Windows release of EventMachine since 2013.\n. Right that is where I am at now. Demonization is complicated with JRuby because we can't fork, but the nohup approach plus state file should work well.\n. The puma change runs the server directly rather than spinning up a background process. Stopping the server means Ctrl-C.\nThank you for the input...I figured this would be a change that needed discussion. I will look into the equivalent background-process behavior for Puma.\n. I was not really sure about this :-\\ It appears to monkey-patch Thin to close all open connections during shutdown. I don't think there needs to be an equivalent for Puma, because it already manages those connections and has a graceful shutdown path. Perhaps Thin would refuse to shut down unless all connections were closed?\n. @cefigueiredo I opened this PR as a good faith attempt to work with you to make Dashing work on JRuby. I assumed the PR will evolve as we discuss its changes and find the best way to replace Thin with Puma. If you prefer to only receive fully-formed PRs before discussing them, I will try to do that in the future.\n. ",

What was the solution?\nSomeHuman\n. Did you ever find a solution to this? \n. How about having your Powershell code post to your dashboard using Curl for windows? Alternatively, I believe there are methods in Powershell to use HTTP (such as: Invoke-WebRequest).\nUnless I'm missing the gist of your question, gather the data you want using Powershell, then post the result to the dashboard using HTTP. If you need to do this periodically, run the Powershell script via a scheduled task. I do something similar using VBScript.\nIt may also be possible to run your Powershell script from Ruby using System or Exec commands and pass the data via a file dump. Ruby calls a batch file, which runs a Powershell script and dumps data to a temp file, Ruby then reads the temp file data and posts to the dashboard. Have not done this myself but seems possible.\nSomeHuman\n. After many trials and errors, I run Dashing as a windows service using NSSM (Non-Sucking Service Manager which is fantastic and is freely available on the web) and have really have had no problems.\nMake sure you use either the 32 or 64 bit version of NSSM as appropriate. The settings I use for NSSM to run Dashing are: (obviously yours would be different)\nPath: C:\\RailsInstaller\\Ruby2.0.0\\bin\\ruby.exe\nStartup directory: C:\\MyDashboard\nArguments:  C:\\RailsInstaller\\Ruby2.0.0\\bin\\thin start -p 3030\nHope this helps...\nSomeHuman\n.

Doing a merge from my branch shouldn't affect anything other than the fontawesome stuff though - git is pretty good at asking you about any conflicts (if any) and letting you resolve them.\n. Typical! I just tested it though:\n$ git checkout master\n$ git branch test-merge\n$ git checkout test-merge\nHere I made a change to application.coffee (just added a line for debugging in). Then merge from my 'remote' branch (my remote is labelled origin):\n$ git merge origin/fontawesome-4.3.0\nUpdating f4b121e..763d950\nFast-forward\n templates/project/assets/fonts/FontAwesome.otf           |  Bin 0 -> 93888 bytes\n templates/project/assets/fonts/fontawesome-webfont.eot   |  Bin 37405 -> 60767 bytes\n templates/project/assets/fonts/fontawesome-webfont.svg   |  240 ++++-\n templates/project/assets/fonts/fontawesome-webfont.ttf   |  Bin 79076 -> 122092 bytes\n templates/project/assets/fonts/fontawesome-webfont.woff  |  Bin 43572 -> 71508 bytes\n templates/project/assets/fonts/fontawesome-webfont.woff2 |  Bin 0 -> 56780 bytes\n templates/project/assets/stylesheets/font-awesome.css    | 1704 ++++++++++++++++++-------------\n templates/project/dashboards/sampletv.erb                |    8 +-\n templates/project/widgets/number/number.coffee           |    2 +-\n 9 files changed, 1221 insertions(+), 733 deletions(-)\n create mode 100644 templates/project/assets/fonts/FontAwesome.otf\n create mode 100644 templates/project/assets/fonts/fontawesome-webfont.woff2\nSo anything unrelated is definitely not broken by git (as expected).\nHope this helps for next time! :smiley: \n.

Just override it in the html of your dashboard with a style=\"background-color: #ffffff\" attribute. There is an example of this on one of the sample dashboards.\n. See comments on #514, but I have made the same changes as before just with the new FA package:\nI have replaced the font files and fontawesome css file (with a minor update for the paths to the fonts).\nI have updated the few places that the old icon- fontawesome class names were used with the new fa- format (and the changed icon names as appropriate).\nPlease let me know if I've missed anything, but this should mean the base install of Dashing works fine - 3rd party widgets may need updating to use the new FontAwesome fa class names - this should be a simple find-and-replace.\n.

    "mattrayner": "I don't want to step on the toes of the Shopify guys here, but I feel like this may be out of scope for the Dashing project?\n\nDashing is a Sinatra based framework that lets you build beautiful dashboards.\n\nI feel like the reporting functions you are after don't really belong inside of Dashing?\n. We're running 4 separate dashboards off of one server with 4 different raspberry pi's displaying each dashboard with no problems.\nWe're running the dashing server in a VM hosted on a private cluster we have but I've ran it on a digital ocean box before with no problems?\nAre you doing anything non-standard as far as the dashboard or widgets is concerned?\n. @tylermauthe I'm using Chromium on Raspbian for each pi\n. This is kind of a side note, and probably not all that helpful... But does it work in ERB? As in is it to do with it being a HAML dashboard as opposed to just ERB?\nI don't know if this would help, but I'd find the answer interesting :P\n. I don't know about the roadmap for Dashing, or about #354 in particular, but if you're using HAML for stylistic reasons and switching to ERB fixes your problem - maybe ERB is the way to go?\n. Touc\u00e8, I watched a keynote from the Dashing guys earlier and they clearly stated that HAML should work\nCan you include your HAML for me to look at?\n. I've had a look at your haml and added an extra DIV element to the last LI tag\nWorking HAML Example\nThe HAML in this gist is working for me - can you test it and let me know?\n. This may be a stupid question, but you have included HAML in your Gemfile?\nAlso, have you tried re-installing dashing & re-creating a project?\n. Why don't you just make a second dashboard?\nWe're running a single Dashing instance on a similar box running 4 separate dashboards\nI.e. they live at:\ndashboards.server.com/dashboard1\ndashboards.server.com/dashboard2\ndashboards.server.com/dashboard3\ndashboards.server.com/dashboard4\nWe then have 4 separate dashboard .erb files and the associated jobs etc\n. Running two instances of dashing in daemon mode with different ports should work for you then.\nIf you set your updates at a decent rate and don't expect too much load on the server then I can't see a problem with your setup. From my testing Dashing seems to be pretty light.\nYou could use some thing like this:\nbash\n$ cd $FIRST_DASHING_PATH && bundle exec dashing start -d -p 3030 -P $FIRST_DASHING_PATH/tmp/pids/dashing.pid\n$ cd $SECOND_DASHING_PATH && bundle exec dashing start -d -p 3031 -P $SECOND_DASHING_PATH/tmp/pids/dashing.pid\nYou could then use NGINX to alias separate domains to the different ports i.e.\ndashboard1.example.com\ndashboard2.example.com\nUsing the above setup you can manage each of the dashing instances separately by killing and starting based on PIDs\nI hope this helps?\n.

I used to use Graphite + Dashing in another company (see http://thomasvm.github.io/blog/2012/11/19/bling-dashboards-using-graphite-and-dashing/).\nNow I'm in a new company, with Dashing.JS (moving to Dashing + Ruby soon, TL;DR problems with operating systems), and plan to use InfluxDB + Dashing.\nIn case I can't find any ready-to-use integration, I'd probably look at the one for Graphite, and adapt it to InfluxDB :)\n. Happy to contribute and keep using the fork (that's Dashing-io/dashing right?).\n. @webmaster128 there are some people already involved, talking in GitHub, working on issues, but you are correct none has committed yet (I think).\nThere is already one pull request that I think would be useful, but not sure about security (https://github.com/Dashing-io/dashing/pull/7). I don't want to start committing things without a consensus from the newly formed team and the rest of the community - and I believe others feel the same way.\nDifferent from other projects, where a fork started with some of the previous committers, this fork has been created as the committers stopped working on the code base. So it is expected that there may be a hiatus until the members of the newly created group get to know each other.\nWe are slowly getting to know each other, and talking about the issues we have, and how to fix. You can contribute there if you'd like :smiley: \n. I am probably not the best to answer your questions, but I believe they are valid concerns, and will leave my own opinion here :-)\n\nI am just wondering what the plans for the fork are.\n\nI believe the main goal is to keep the project being maintained, rather than seeing it simply stop the development.\n\nWho the maintainers are, what your plans are.\n\nI was invited to the organisation, but haven't contributed much yet. I have been using Dashing for the last three years I think. Used the NodeJS version too, which is not being maintained any more. My plan is simple; try to help as much as I can (specially given I can use some hours at $work, as they have almost 10 dashboards now, used by different departments).\n\nIs it a one-man show or a team?\n\nThat will probably, and hopefully, a team. But again, it is rather in the beginning of the fork, and as I said before, we are getting to know each other. Expecting that the whole team will start working, as fast and effective as the previous team, is probably asking too much right now. \n\nShould the organization remain Dashing-io when you don't get the domain dashing.io.\n\nFor the time being, shopify is kindly maintaining the domain. I believe we are almost reaching the consensus to use GitHub pages instead. Then options would be find a way to maintain the domain name ourselves (under a group of users, foundation, company, etc), or start redirecting dashing.io to the GitHub page (HTTP 301), inform users, update links and give enough time for people to get used to the new domain.\n\nIs it necessary to give the product a new name to get a new gem entry?\n\nGood question. If you could file an issue we could perhaps discuss it there, as I think we could end up digressing from the question in this issue :smiley: \n. ",

    "mapledyne": "I think you may have to do some of this by hand. If you get the widget itself from inside a job (if that's where you're running this from), you could:\nwidget = Sinatra::Application.settings.history(\"my_widget\")\nThen get the data itself, delete what you want from there, then use a send_event() to replace the data with the updated list.\nIf I had a better example of what you were wanting to do, I could write up a better example, but hopefully that gets you towards a possible solution.\n. Found the answer to my problem and thought I'd post here if anyone else is curious.\nThis variable:\n  widgets = Sinatra::Application.settings.history\nhas all the widget info (at least the info I was looking for). Looping through that:\n  widgets.each do |key, value|\n   ...\n  end\nlet's you run through all the widgets and do any evaluations desired on them.\n. Coffeescript is Javascript compliant, so you can use the Math.round() function there, though if you want to keep a decimal place you may have to do something silly like Math.round(n*10)/10. \n. We put something like this at the top of our erb template on dashboards we want different sizes. We don't use these on mobile, but the concept should be the same.\nIn addition, we found that some widgets (maxmeter for instance) have minimum sizes they expect. We had to derive from them and make smaller version of the widgets so they looked good in the smaller boxes.\n```\n\n$(function() {\n  // These settings override the defaults set in application.coffee. You can do this on a per dashboard basis.</p>\n<p>Dashing.widget_base_dimensions = [200, 250]\n  Dashing.widget_margins = [5, 5]\n  Dashing.numColumns = 6\n  });\n\n```\n. I agree with @pushmatrix on the scope of Dashing - it handles one-screen layouts quite well. Making it responsive definitely is a bit of a stray away from its core competency. There are lots of things I'd love to see improved in Dashing (but don't get me wrong - it's a fantastic tool), but making it responsive wouldn't help us in the slightest, and we have thousands of widgets and hundreds of dashboards.\n. Yes. I wrote a simple example job that can do just that here:\nhttp://www.mapledyne.com/ideas/2015/6/30/delete-a-dashing-dashboard-widget\nYou basically just want to manipulate the Sinatra::Application.settings.history variable, but the code in that link should get you most of the way to where you want to be.\nOr skip the post and go right to the gist file:\nhttps://gist.github.com/mapledyne/6fb671c17c3f865309f3#file-delete-widget-rb\n. Forcing a refresh may be a hack, as what I do there (I'd agree on both counts, frankly), but what I describe above doesn't refresh the whole stack - in our situation, we only delete the widgets we're wanting deleted. We dynamically create dashboards that look to see what widgets exist to decide what to display. Having certain widget deleted, then, change the look of the dashboards as appropriate.\nIf there was an API call or similar to delete widgets individually, I'd love to hear it. Until then, manually removing them from the history variable has been very successful for us. \nIn other words: do you have a non-hack solution to the problem of removing a widget? I'd love to learn.\n. We use it for dynamic dashboards lots, quite successfully, and I didn't find it to be a lot of work. It actually turned out to be much less than I expected. A job symlinks the appropriate dashboards to a template erb file (essentially one for every environment/set of VMs). This erb then looks up its filename which due to the symlink is the id of the environment. It looks up what VMs belong to that VM, then creates a row for each VM - in each row are all widgets with the appropriate VM id. \nThis way we can create new environments, and dashing doesn't need to know about them (other than the job creating the new symlink automatically), and the template doesn't even need to know what widgets are present for a given VM, so it can report information that's only appropriate to itself.\nWe then deploy with puppet a script to each VM that in turn updates the widgets for the given VM.\nUltimately, QA builds a new set of VMs and within minutes there's a living dashboard for all of the systems in there, all without our intervention.\nHundreds of dashboards and thousands of widgets, and it works fantastically. Sure there's a hack here and there, but as we discover better ways, we can implement them pretty easily - all of those widgets and dashboards are ultimately a result of only three files, all reasonably small in size for the work they do for us.\n.

I will integrate it. \nI think we should be able to solve the daemonizing issue mentioned in the comments to #427, maybe not for java but at least for MRI. Heroku have good setup instructions for puma (https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-rails-applications-with-the-puma-web-server) that might help too.\n. I integrated most of the work previously done to support puma. I also used pumactl for supporting daemon mode (-d) for backwards compatibility. There's still one small open point regarding the location of puma's pidfile (needed in daemon mode by pumactl to stop the server). Otherwise I think this would be ready. Can @tylermauthe or @pushmatrix have a look at this? \nNote that I also opened a separate PR (#683) for fixing the travis config.\n. Thanks for taking a look at this. \nRegarding windows support for forking: it's effectively not working, even on JRuby. The puma README has some info on this under https://github.com/puma/puma#platform-constraints. \nI also had a look at how rails configures the puma server, now that it's their default and it seems they generate a puma.rb config file under /config (it gets picked up automatically then). This might be a better long term solution as everything (port, pidfile, # threads) can then be configured in the file. \nI will also update the wiki with information on puma when this PR gets merged.\nYou'll be able to close PRs #609 and #427 when you merge this one as it supercedes them.\n. I missed the SSE related errors when I tested, sorry for that. Then it seems we are blocked by missing sinatra support here. :-(\nRegarding the default port, I will change it so it uses the same as before (9292 is the default puma port). I think the best way would be to use a config/puma.rb file that would be autodetected (as rails does now). Not sure if that can be made backwards compatible with the old -d command line option but I'll try...\n. Cool. \nI merged your PR (in my repo). I will update mine to setup puma similarly to rails, using the config/puma.rb configuration file as this will make server start / stop and general configuration easier. I'll check how to make it backwards compatible with the -d option but otherwise this should be quite easy. \nI'll try to do more testing of the whole too.\n. This memory usage problem looks strange. Make sure you use ruby 2.3.0, as there seem to be unverified memory problems with puma on older (2.2) rubies?\nI cleaned up the configuration to use the standard config/puma.rb config file, including handling of the -d arg to daemonize...\nI can also reproduce the SSE errors in the browser using a newly generated project and your latest commits. I see the same behavior, errors in the js console but application working fine.\n. It looks like JRuby actually checks synchronization on array access, cool. \nI think if you use a Mutex (JRuby supports them) for reading/writing to the client_events you should be good. \n. @tylermauthe Thanks a lot for taking the time to fix the threading issue. I'll squash my commits to make the history cleaner. This is looking really good now...\n. @tylermauthe I squashed all my commits together and left yours as they were. \n. I added a pull request for this: https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/pull/677\nI am not sure how to get travis to use jruby: their doc do not talk about the newer jruby 9.x series (2.x compatibility).\n. @tylermauthe, @pushmatrix This is a pretty simple one, can we get this merged?\n.

For (1) you can send the corresponding data by the server's background job on a schedule.
