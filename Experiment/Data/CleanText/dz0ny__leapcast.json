It must be the same address as your device(where you intend to run leapcast).\n. yep it starts chrome browser\n. When youtube app starts you should see something like \n/opt/google/chrome/chrome --app=\"https://www.youtube.com/tv?pairingCode=2f22b370-fafa-baba-b9bb-ba66cbe104fe&v=Ej8x2p11NBM&t=0\" --user-agent=\"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) CrKey/30.0.1573.2 Safari/537.36\"\nThe url you are lookig for is https://www.youtube.com/tv?pairingCode=2f22b370-3e28-4c6c-b9bb-ba66cbe104fe&v=Ej8x2p11NBM&t=0 and not http://192.168.7.130:8008/apps/YouTube/run which is part of DIAL protocol. \n. Yep STOMP service in not implemented yet. You don't need that, you can just use youtube app and it will work.\n. See #13 also your are pointing to wrong application. \n. @AaronOgle it would be great if you could post xml file of actual device chromecast device located at http://ip_of_chromecast_device/ssdp/device-desc.xml\n. Hi, still no luck, Can you provide http://ip_of_chromecast_device/apps/GoogleMusic before you start remote activity an after. Thx\n. how about when it's started, it should contain connectionSvcURL?\n. No GoogleMusic should be totally different. Netflix doesn't use any feature of the cast framework (RAMP protocol)\n. OK from what I understand connectionSvcURL is websocket proxy (RAMP). I got RAMP working, but 2nd screen device still doesn't connect to WS url (http://192.168.1.211:8008/connection/GoogleMusic) instead I see constat GET requets to http://192.168.1.211:8008/apps.\nWhen GoogleMusic is running please post data from:\nhttp://192.168.1.211:8008/apps\nhttp://192.168.1.211:8008/connection/GoogleMusic\nthx\n. yep. If you are up to it Wireshark capture of TIcTacToe would also help me a lot. I know I'm pushing it :), otherwise i will pause development for a little bit.\n. @AaronOgle thx, I thinx you copy pasted something wrong\n```\n{\"channel\":0}HTTP/1.1 200 OK\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, OPTIONS\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: https://www.google.com\nContent-Type: application/json\nContent-Length: 61\n{\"URL\":\"ws://192.168.1.211:8008/session?28\",\"pingInterval\":5}\n```\nMakes no sense to me\n. @AaronOgle oh I get it. Late hour I guess :)\n. It was fuckin header utf-8 and cast library not recognising it properly. \n. Yep, websocket part is not finished yet.\n. Thats how DIAL protocol excepts that apps work. However you can manipulate code however you wish :) For example if you run with --kiosk --incognito chrome will start in full screen if you change user agent to TV you will get different interface, etc\n. C:\\Users\\DieBagger\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe is not the way how you write paths in windows to python program. It should be \"C:/Users/DieBagger/AppData/Local/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe\" or \"C://Users//DieBagger//AppData//Local//Google//Chrome//Application//chrome.exe\". Python recognises \\ as escape character and this messes the parsing. Again this is not related to app and windows in not supported at all.\n. :) Np\n. @onionhammer Not true, windows support both ways (historically is because DOS 2.0 used / for end of line). ONLY Start->Run requires paths separated with \\ and most users don't bother to know. Now you know :)\n. Fixed with https://github.com/dz0ny/leapcast/commit/0f20858ce52723d722ca8a6fc4ca4ae4b6c9becb\n. Issues are not for install problems! Install twisted and tornado module and it should work, however windows is not a priority.\n. This is by design, until app is stable it should be only used by developers(you should at least look at code and be able to understand what modules you need). About instructions you are right.\n. fixed with 4402e6006a76c045b1c87a983285010a600c905c\n. Allready fixed in pypi branch https://github.com/dz0ny/leapcast/blob/create-package/leapcast/main.py#L38\n. Please add Windows and python version?\n. Hm, cygwin must be doing something to WIn32 APi here. I'am in process of removing twisted and rewriting ssdp part, hopefully this will also fix you problem \n. looks good, thx\n. See https://github.com/dz0ny/leapcast/issues/13 \n. Make sure that you are on the same lan, restart android app(there is a bug in some versions of cyanogen mod). Boot to live usb linux distribution and try there.\n. Googlecast app is only used for initial setup of device(connecting to wlan, etc), no need for it here. Proper multichannel (more than one device) is being done in https://github.com/dz0ny/leapcast/tree/actor_pattern branch.\n. :) Well you are right, you are mixing two different things. You can just run directly from command prompt, you are instead running python in interactive mode, loading module and treating it's like shell. \n1. Install python\n2. Instal setuptools\n3. pip install https://github.com/dz0ny/leapcast/archive/master.zip\n4. open powershell or cmd and enter leapcast --name Chromecast --chrome \"C:/Program Files (x86)/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe\"\n. Try Youtube or Google Music app, it should work. Browser is run when you actually connect to lepacast with remote\n. Yes, example is here https://github.com/DSteve595/leapcast/blob/master/leapcast/apps/steven.py. Currently you are limited to just one channel also if you limit search or you implemented your own protocol in your app, you must add specific protocol to service definition.\nclass MySoundcloudAPP(LEAP):\n    url = \"http://www.gstatic.com/eureka/sample/tictactoe/tictactoe.html\"\n    supported_protocols = ['com.dz0ny.soundcloud.remote','ramp']\n. No, just example :) Btw I use your app while commuting (mainly because of offline mode). Will you use ramp (https://github.com/dz0ny/leapcast/wiki/RAMP-protocol) or will you develop your own protocol?\n. I would suggest RAMP https://developers.google.com/cast/reference/android/javadoc/reference/com/google/cast/MediaProtocolMessageStream. My idea is to port entire thing to XBMC, and for that case RAMP makes it much easier.\n. Cool, I will be very happy tester :)\n. Can you elaborate?\n. Looking through log i noticed you are using ramp(do you really?) see example above if you don't use ramp. The timeout thing might be just windows related stuff (tornado the underlying web server is not meant to be run under windows), try increasing leapcast process affinity. \n. Can you post log wit leapcast -d \n. @cucko from RAMP/Leapcast perspective, everything looks ok. Remember receiver is not aware of any user specific session, you must handle over all credentials needed for particular url. In case of Soundcloud that means client_key and user Oauth key(for some private streams). If you used chromium you must also install chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra package.\norg.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NameHasNoOwner is chrome reporting that it isn't run on chromeos\n. Chromecast API has changed significantly. \nIn order to get it working again we need to:\n- Implement MDNS discovery (DIAL has be deprecated)\n- Implement encryption of packets (mayor pain, because android API and web now check for certificate issuer)\n- RAMP protocol has been extended and most of the old methods are no longer used (ping is the only one remaining)\n. @MrHofa You are informed right, in both counts. :)\n. Sry guys, currently I'am busy with other projects. As soon I find free time i will update Leapcast to new Chromecast API.\n. try twisted from main repo sudo apt-get install python-twisted-web python2.7-dev\n. @grrratt where did you get leapcast-script.py ?\n. https://github.com/dz0ny/leapcast/wiki/RAMP-protocol :)\n. leapcast is just proxy between apps, it could be related to proxy implementation. But to actually debug it i need to create app to really test stuff :)\n. see https://github.com/dz0ny/leapcast/issues/13#issuecomment-21783993\n. @Schibum see  https://github.com/dz0ny/leapcast/issues/8#issuecomment-21690861\n. Can you confirm that running minissdpd after leapcast works? On supported platforms SO_REUSEPORT should allow multiple listening daemons on same port.\nsocket.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEPORT, 1)\n. Why do you need this program? I could make ssdp service optional for users who prefer setting ssdp discovery for themselves. \n. Any browser with websockets(v13), webrtc(data channels), advanced video and audio support and user-agent which contains crKey should work, minus the css quirks :).\n. 1. 2. and 3. you are right. 4. User agent for chrome device is needed because screen api is using it for distinguishing normal chrome browser from  ChromeCast like. There are also hints for cloud mode(remote control of device in different network or isolated one), where webrtc would presumably be used because of its p2p mode.\n. Did you test any of the apps, because in receiver I has fixed declaration to port 8008. Receiver won't work if you change port see https://www.gstatic.com/eureka/js/chromekey_receiver.js\n. Just tested with Google Music and it doesn't work. There are two websocket connections to port 8008 one is channel creation second one is for ChromeCast control (volume, setup). If either of them is disconnected or unavailable app won't work. The only url you can control is channel url (also websocket).\n. which distribution? On rpi the main problem is unoptimized chromium binary.\n. Press win+r and enter this C:\\\\PROGRA~1\\\\Google\\\\Chrome\\\\Application\\\\chrome.exe then click run/ok. What happens?\n. \nWorks fine for me, try updating your installation.\n. Essentially leapcast(or ChromeCast) can be considered as software router. Mobile app(for example youtube) issues command to play, no parsing of any kind is done in router itself. It's pretty genius idea to put everything in the app and browser, this way you can iterate/change session protocol (RAMP,CV, ...), without updating ChromeCast.\nSee https://github.com/dz0ny/leapcast/blob/master/leapcast/services/websocket.py#L173 if you meant passing and parsing was typo.\nYou may also wan't to look at https://github.com/dz0ny/leapcast/wiki/RAMP-protocol\n. Both, the chrome browser and the app :)\n. 1) During POST (create app) or via serviceURL if app is allready running\n2) remotes(list) corresponds to receivers(list) (this represents one channel)\n3) yes, if no data is transmitted in 3 seconds channel is destroyed by both app and browser\n. Depends on chrome/chromium. leapcast is merely a proxy(described in simplest terms).\n. Have a look at http://pythonhosted.org/distribute/setuptools.html#development-mode\n. It's not related to leapcast but chromium project. \n. How would you render video to chrome browser? Currently leapcast is just websocket proxy between mobile app and chrome browser...\n. Install Google Chrome (chromium is fine too) and override path to browser.\n. Chromecast app is only used for first time setup on real device. This has no use in emulated one :)\n. Cool :)\n. @neumino Why are remotes, receivers and control_channel lists in leapcast/services/websocket.py?\nBecause connection to remote (app) drops, same goes for browser app. Apps also have more than one websocket channels (ramp, rb). New apps have at least three connections (control, ramp, rb). App developers could also add their own channels (somewhat advertised in devel docs).\n. @feczo you have Chrome running in background, close it then run Leapcast. (lepcast starts chrome with UA modified )\n. Selenium is a bit of overkill, wire protocol and page.navigate command should suffice https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/protocol/tot/page\n. Hi,\nwhat about custom json that user can specify at startup. In the same structure as https://clients3.google.com/cast/chromecast/device/config ?\n. @maheshprabhu Just tested Redbull app and it works. You might want to Open Chrome debug console and look for errors with app itself. \n. Thx :)\n. mac and win https://github.com/sabnzbd/sabnzbd/blob/master/sabnzbd/init.py#L770\nlinux https://github.com/ianmartin/Deluge-PreventSuspend-plugin/blob/deluge-1.2.x/preventsuspend/core.py\n. @vapier  https://travis-ci.org/dz0ny/leapcast/builds/16788197#L82 \n. The problem is with two session you are starting(your profile) and Chromecast profile. Close Chrome completely (even background task) then start Leapcast. It should work normally...\n. Raspbian? Try updating packages. Then post chromium version and python version.\n. Yea it won't work on rpi :) \n. Native Chromium audio for RPI is not even implemented, maybe with pulseaudio. Video won't work defiantly. \n. start-leapcast.vbs? I'am not the author and that file is not the part of the project. You might want to contact original author of that script.\n1. I think that graphic drives have ability to set which app is on which screen. Windows itself controls where window would show according to this http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/ae22fbac-bbf5-43bc-a9fc-7d44b68ea00a/default-screen-for-opening-new-windows-and-default-screen-for-certain-apps?forum=w7itproui\n. This looks like Chrome/OSX error, try Chromium.\n. This app is already included. You can add your own apps via -apps flag and valid json file. Format of file must resemble https://clients3.google.com/cast/chromecast/device/config\n. Netflix is not support because, they use custom app(Chromecast only handles discovery).\n. @aaronogle https://github.com/dz0ny/leapcast/blob/master/README.md#chromecast-api-v2 :)\n. @quantenschaum https://github.com/dz0ny/leapcast/issues/29#issuecomment-37288608\n.

Casting as is it rolling right now(announced at Google IO) is not supported. Because Google decide to encrypt data protocol, as they have all right to. \n\nUpdated https://github.com/dz0ny/leapcast/commit/2348fea2fc4d38a02e19e609f53d1d930b88a899 to reflect some info.\n. They dropped old Chrome Cast api, see http://www.androidpolice.com/2014/06/30/google-play-music-updated-to-v5-6-with-tweaked-navigation-menu-android-tv-support-now-limited-to-5-smartphones-and-more-apk-download/. \n. Not supported, see https://github.com/dz0ny/leapcast#chromecast-api-v2-develop-branch\n. See https://github.com/dz0ny/leapcast#chromecast-api-v2-develop-branch\n. On port 8009 is CastChannelService(https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/extensions/browser/api/cast_channel/cast_channel.proto&q=cast%20channel&sq=package:chromium&l=1) which is basically WebsocketServer that is used to start receiver apps. They use protobuf rather than JSON (https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/extensions/browser/api/cast_channel/cast_channel.proto&q=cast_channel.proto&sq=package:chromium&type=cs)\nYou may find more info studiying https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/chromecast/&ct=rc&cd=2&q=cast&sq=package:chromium (stub).\nAnd for {port,address} reuse, leapcast already does that if user runs linux kernel 3.11+.\n. https://github.com/dz0ny/leapcast#chromecast-api-v2-develop-branch\n. @Phaeilo thx for your PR, this project is now archived.\n. @simon-weber thx for this, but project is now archived.\n. true thx :)\n. For that we need captured traffic between such device(that only supports audio) and client. Last time I checked that traffic was encrypted with one-time PKI, so not much hope here :)\n. They use headless chrome (something like phantomjs) for audio only device. About the request header, that can be done with chrome extension https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/modheader/idgpnmonknjnojddfkpgkljpfnnfcklj and others...\n. Only the clients can be created, as soon you want to create server you need to create your own authority for entire chromecast stack and even then you won't be able to use all apps (just those that use same drm) also the casting device would need to be rooted. They only way currently is to start from scratch and create new open source / open implementation of casting protocol. But that would not be compatible with current v5/6 of casting protocol.\n. Officially dead :)\n. Removed from pypi\n. I believe this still works https://github.com/aykevl/plaincast :) In theory you could use old YT protocol which used DIAL protocol to make it compatible with Kodi. Parts of this projects can be used for that but you would have to emulate browser in python, the above mentioned plancast does this.. ",

Nah, port forwarding won't do anything.\nTry resetting your network adapter. (disable/enable through Windows).\n. You should be good to go now. Check YouTube or Play Music.\n. I've been getting Cast to work in my app too, and keep in mind, some of the issues you'll run into are with leapcast, not the app. I know this because the same issues happen sometimes with Play Music and YouTube. For now, leapcast's perfect for making sure your app can start a connection with a ChromeCast and pass data, but it gets unstable when you try to do more, so don't pull your hair out just yet.\n.

It will trip it up sometimes though, say, after 15 seconds of not doing anything, pressing play/pause on the app won't do anything on leapcast. At that point, it'll either give up (clicking a track says \"unable to play this track) or it'll reconnect itself silently, depending on how the celestial bodies are aligned.\nThere's another issue I was having a lot yesterday too, but it's way too sporadic to pinpoint.\nNote: I don't mean to diminish what you've done with this project, I think it's beyond fantastic and I wouldn't have been able to even start testing the SDK without it. I'd just like to see it get more stable and closer to the real product!\n. I'm not 100% clear on what RAMP is, but if it's for managing playback, volume, and seek of videos, then yes.\nAnd if it's a Windows issue, maybe it's finally time I switch my dev environment to Linux :P\n.

I don't know how to get chrome to do this, so I tweaked the argument building code in leap_factory.py to try to get it to support launching vlc instead of chrome (vlc complains and stops when it gets arguments it doesn't understand). It's crude and only works for the first video, but I was able to play a youtube smoothly.

On linux, chrome tends to need the \"--ignore-gpu-blacklist\" flag to use hardware video acceleration.\nEven if this is set in the \"chrome://flags\" page for the user that runs leapcast, it won't persist since leapcast launches chrome/chromium using a temporary user data dir, which sets up a new profile with no flags set.\nI'm not familiar with how to do GitHub stuff at the moment, but modifying the command line used to launch chrome/chromium in leap_factory.py to include \"--ignore-gpu-blacklist\" enables full frame rate playback for me. The same goes for pointing leapcast at the already configured user data dir too, although then the window doesn't open fullscreen.\nThe first few seconds of a video are displayed at low quality with a temporary user data dir, which doesn't happen if I launch the browser using the usual user data dir, so I'm not sure if either is really a full solution.\n.

Also make sure you're synced to at least revision 3838e6aaeb4dfb19ce8b2925de5908adb537acd8, as it has a fix for fullscreen not passing the appurl.\n. Yes, I see it too.  I haven't looked to see why.  YouTube seems to work correctly though.  (Music uses the websocket channel, YouTube doesn't - I don't know if this has anything to do with the 'play next item on playlist once song is over' functionality being broken)\n.

Chrome is still at the core and the js libraries for the receivers should still be accessible, so leapcast will probably still work once the new discovery mechanism is figured out and coded in.\n. Looks like Google killed the DIAL discovery mechanism in the final SDK too. No broadcast is going to 239.255.255.250 any longer DIAL discovery. I had to resort to packet sniffing after I updated the leap.py code to deal with the new \"enabled_app_ids\" way of getting their information.
