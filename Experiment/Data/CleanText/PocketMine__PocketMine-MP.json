No, that would be unusable. Nota everyone uses your prigram\n. Check fopen modes, there are one that allows to skip to the end of the file at opening\n.

Fixed 8f6ed22158649e5ee72669f4bb0fdc2b95d432d5\n. It's programmed to be undestroyable. I'll remove that in a near future\n. Latest dev has his\n. \u00ac\u00ac\nIt was undestroyable server-side, but the client displayed it broken.\n. Fixed ;)\n. Chest, furnace opening is not implemented yet :(\nAlso, you can only die due to PvP or dropping to the void, because nothing more has been implemented.\nI recommend you playing in Creative Mode until the Beta stage is released (usable Survival mode!)\n. Check issue #49 \n. These files are re-included, that's the error. Check those folders (at update) if there are repeated files (like TreeObject (1).php or so)\nThanks!\n. Redownload the new Windows Installer, that should fix this\n. server.ph is now \"PocketMine-MP.php\". And because now it uses threads (in the latest development version) no input.php or console.in is needed. \n. So now it's simplier to use it \u00ac\u00ac. For the latest stable version, the input.php is under src/common/input.php and console.in under logs/console.in. But for the latest Development version, nothing of this is needed.\nJust run php PocketMine-MP.php. \n. Yeah, I also noticed it. It's a weird bug, and the only thing that I've discovered is that this seems a problem releated to the server.tick event. This can cause a event duplication, or in the worst case, an infinite loop.\nThanks!\n. @sekjun9878 Maybe you can mod the App...\nlet's wait for Mojang :D\n. There are lots of things to get to the Beta stage (Full Survival Update)\nThis is one of these!\n. Then we'll have to implement \"arrows and eggs/snowballs\"\n. Mojang said something about logging in using Minecraft (non-premium) accounts. That way, you can also have skins.\nLet's wait 0.5.1\nIf no account login is implemented... Well, you can make a plugin :D\n. It's already in the TODO list ;)\nhttps://github.com/shoghicp/PocketMine-MP/wiki/To-Do\n. This feature has been added to the latest Development release\n. Thanks!\nFixed by b150d4e00169b984bae8d64e1703d3e9c9b61cad\nAlso, the Chest bug has been fixed by 82f2a0f2f871fa8ebad6eca59674d4ddb16e46d5\n. Ouch. Couldn't test that last fix. I changed that part of the code :s \n. I set that property on items, because gravity isn't implemented yet on the server. Because of that, items would fall client-side, but not server-side. So I update their position every 20 ticks\n. Closing, added to list\n. Fixed by db9625b52fe173563fc322faa428ce6b981ceee9\n. Water source block is ID 9, not 8. You should use ID 9 to place water\n. Inventory and TileEntities (like chests) are being implemented to the Server, so no Furnace/Chest inventories for now :(\nLeft this open to close it when this is implemented\n. The normal generator is in development. You'll be able to set the generator in the generator entry on server.properties (check the wiki for more info) when it's done\n. Questions: https://github.com/shoghicp/PocketMine-MP/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions\nAlso search port forwading on Google\nThe normal generator will not work for now\n. This feature has been added to the Alpha_1.3 To Do list\n. Normal maps are included in the latest dev., in a temporal way.\n. You've to open ports/forward ports on your router. Search for \"open ports router\" on Google\n. Sure!\nAdding more events for multiple things :D\n. Add like a BanAPI that handles the whitelist.txt, ipban and normal bans.\nThat was the think I was thinking about :D\n. The BanAPI will be a standalone file, that command in the console was a temp. one ;)\n. \"This bug seems to be in the collision detection part of the program and should be fixed\"\nThere aren't any collision detection in the program. In creative this is not an issue, but in survival the block gets placed and you keep the block.\nDoing it ;)\n. This issue will be fixed when update block re-detection is done ;)\n. Keep in mind that it's an Alpha. Lots of micro-implementations will have to be done until all the features from minecraft are implemented\n. This is now checked on the latest dev release, but currently only for torches\n. You've to edit the code. That was a test for the sign packet data sending. In the 0.5.1 it'll be included\n. 0.5.1 = Minecraft PE 0.5.1 (Minecraft Release)\n. I've been adding more API events in these latest commits. So this pull request cannot be directly merged.\nI'll add it by hand\n. Fixed!\n. Always use the latest Development version testing bugs ;)\nI use to commit silent updates with bugfixes\n. Fixed by 6102efc80932ab272640941d4518a0d19f7afbaf\n. dhandle() creates a copy of the variable, so the data doesn't get modified in the calling context. Also, you can pass it arrays directly\n. I'll left that out. You'll see it only when connecting\n. Yeah, a big link :D\n. @leeforkenbrock The Alpha_1.4 will be the latest big release on the Alpha stage. It will include full survival (including mobs), but I'm sure that there will be things to fix (and tune). That will be the first Beta stage.\nThe Alpha_1.4 will be released after MCPE 0.9 is released, supporting all its features (though it might not support the same amount of world biomes). Check #1288 for the current public To-Do list (though I have a bigger one in my wall)\n. Also describes events and the data these events carry\n. That's strange xD\nChange the method name to send()\n. Not again\nI've added an option to convert these... But don't work right\n. \"More API events\" refer to events like player.join, and a new type of events that get triggered when an event is cancelled\n. :D\nFixed another memory leak. This one was a slow one. It was caused due to unfreed event responses (deprecated and obsolete). Event responses where removed in b74c089ce71273a2509dd9d6c2bbcd627be9fca0\nThat commit also fixed the event duplication bug\n. Testing alpha!!!\n. Alpha_1.0.6!! https://github.com/shoghicp/PocketMine-MP/tree/Alpha_1.0.6\n. This is an old weir bug. Sometimes plugins doesn't get loaded event the init() method is called, and if you add another instruction inside the function, this is solved (could be an Internal PHP Bug)\nChecking this\n. I'm using edge functions of PHP ;)\n. At the time you do a pull request, it can't be automatically merged :(\nSo I've to include it myself\n. Closed by 13f4f3285fb129e1d416f39ed6da8b5a07eabca2\n. I'll update it with the config format class :D\n. When 0.6.0 comes out\n. Don't request plugins here. You should do that on MC forums\n. Use the installer provided (re-install). That will install PHP inside the folder. Also, check for a \"php.cmd\" file inside that folder. If it not exists, create a new one:\n```\n@echo off\nbin\\php\\php.exe %*\nexit\n```\nhttps://github.com/shoghicp/PocketMine-MP/wiki/Setting-up-a-Server#wiki-update\n. Fixed by 3813ef73ea2b382f9aa8168b453d298f886f6a5f\n. If you can, please run a session of your server with debug=3 (enable this on the server.properties) and sneak ingame. Then, send me the \"packets.log\" file (will be about 70MB)\n. Yeah, send it there. [Not received yet]. If you want, you can also send it to shoghicp@gmail.com\n. Hmm.. We don't have anything in the mailing list\n. Didn't found any releated packet in the log. You should run it longer and sneak several times. (and wait a while before closing the server).\nAlso, it could be that it's only a Client-side feature\n. I'll close the issue. If it's implemented in the main version, I'll add it \n. We'll need to investigate further. It seems that multiplayer PE servers can handle sneaking\n. @MinecraftAddict131 Ok, thanks!\n. @pkthunderbolt Try setting up a local server (the in-game option in MCPE) and try Sneaking. If it works, a packet is used to notify sneaking.\n. hmm... Then I'll close this again\n. First I need a way to get that the player is sneaking ;)\n. @MinecraftAddict131 MCPE protocol data container packet that contains more reliable ordered packets\n. @ARMmaster17 I would like to get some Wireshark Dumps of that, also you can use tcpdump\n. Add a description to your server.properties\n. Follow the \"How to Update\" in the Wiki ;)\nhttps://github.com/shoghicp/PocketMine-MP/wiki/Setting-up-a-Server#wiki-update\n. @sekjun9878 Try to reproduce it. Maybe there is a nasty bug around\n. Closed by #65\n. It seems that is caused when the server crashes during saving (due to a memory issue).\nTo solve this problem, run the server with more than 128MB of assigned memory.\n. I can't fix that. It's PHP own issue :s\n. Yeah, the PHP binary crashed before executing anything \n. Try installing these two:\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8328\n (if the avobe doesnt works) http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5582\n. Yes, no code is executed. Tested it with Lunick\n. Please read the FAQ, this is explained there. Also, on Windows PocketMine tries to port-forward using UPnP if you enable the \"upnp-forwarding\" property\n. Please update your server again deleting the \"src\" folder.\nFollow this: https://github.com/shoghicp/PocketMine-MP/wiki/Setting-up-a-Server#wiki-update\n. Mojang must implement it before we do. We aren't modifying the client-side.\nAs with maps, check the FAQ on the Wiki\n.  It seems that more than a few are having this issue.\nCheck the links at the bottom of issue #67\n. Are you using Windows 8?\n. Try the new installer available in pocketmine.org\n. Thanks for reporting that here. I'll try to reproduce it, and then, fix it\n. Couldn't reproduce. Works right for me. Make sure you're using the last dev version or the latest stable one\n. https://github.com/brandon15811/Minecraft-PE-Proxy\n. You've to drop world FILES (chunks.dat, level.dat and entities.dat) directly into the \"worlds\" folder\n. That's a lag issue. Just wait for the server to load all the chunks (in both sides)\nThe entity should move right again\n. Player jerking should be fixed now, try the latest Dev release\n. You can download the source code directly from the main page ;)\n@sekjun9878 also, it would be great to include your updater into that installer\n. That's the way Minecraft load new chunks.\nNot an issue (ok, yes, but I can do nothing)\n. http://www.pocketmine.org/plugins.html\n. @ksy4362 \nI'll be released today, be patient\n. It was already on #78 \n. Fixed by 44dc1b13e3a7f3153adf655ec1e81f0cc13c7567\n. Fixed ;)\nhttp://www.pocketmine.org/\n. Fixed ;)\nhttp://www.pocketmine.org/\n. Also, thanks for all these issues. \n. You can join #mcpedevs on irc.freenode.net if you want\nWebChat\n. Then, do the plugin yourself.\n. Try removing the Curl building and changing the path from \"--with-curl\" PHP option.\nThen, try building it again\n. Did it work?\n. I mean removing the option to the parameter with-curl\n. Thanks, I'll be adding that to the Mac compilation\n. @sekjun9878 Try it, but you'll need curl on your computer (also the dev versions)\n. Added the fix to the dev.release\n. Have you used the automatic installer?\n. Make a plugin for that\n. Yeah, but you have to pay for the certificate\n. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/252226/signing-a-windows-exe-file\n. You can install into your own computer a self-signed certificate... But that itself is a weird hack.\n. I've added Fall Damage in 38a1f82456741fd11c45276ab3323f099cb0b44b , but it uses the Y instead of the speed (more reliable).\n. Maybe in a future ;)\n. Added to the ToDo list\nhttps://github.com/shoghicp/PocketMine-MP/wiki/To-Do\n. Post here the install.log generated ;)\n. Thanks for reporting the issue!\n. Why should we change bash to zsh?\n. Thanks!\n. Describe better your issue the next time ;)\nI'll commit a fix in about 2 hours, as soon as I get home\n. Thanks for reporting! The issue has been fixed\n. Please read the FAQ, it's explained there.\nhttps://github.com/shoghicp/PocketMine-MP/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions\nAlso, Map Importing is being to be re-done\n. the name of your imported map\n. @ChaosRuin That should be done using plugins, attaching to the player.join event and changing the gamemode of the player to the one you want\n. So things can be checked like crafting, but that is a Mojang issue :(\nSo no one could add things and cheat in the server\n. @michal16 Check the plugin list https://github.com/shoghicp/PocketMine-MP/wiki/Temporal-Plugin-Links\nThat should be done as a plugin, and other people will do that.\n. @williamtdr You can disable by returning true to the events \"player.block.break.spawn\" and \"player.block.place.spawn\"\n. @williamtdr Check the server.properties page, the spawn-protection has been added to change protection radius (use the latest dev)\n. @williamtdr Block the player.drop event, so players cannot drop Items\n. @DefSoftSol Thanks!\nUnfortunately, burning items in the Furnace will be implemented after Multiworlds, because there are lots of changes to do. Implementing Furnaces right now would mean that I will have to rewrite it later. Also, Mojang blocks the server from enforcing the inventory :( (that will be fixed with the 0.7.0).\nThe priority list right now is:\n\nReported bugs\nPMF Map Type\nMultiworlds\nFurnaces\nBlock update rewrite\nScheduled block updates (growing)\nBlock placement check on block update\nPortals\nBed usage\nAnti-noclip\nMultiple painting sizes\n. @PEPlayer Open a issue with specific details when that happens, so I can narrow the code to look around\n. @michal16 check the server.properties page on the Wiki\n. @michal16 16 is the limit imposed by Minecraft PC, right?\n. @zhuowei Once I've a correct entity trajectory algorithm\n. @ewlkkf It is scheduled for the 2 of June ;)\n. @michal16 Portals simple functionality where implemented in the TP command, but expect them for travelling into the Nether for Alpha_1.4\n. Liquid flow will be added in the next release\n. It's already on the Alpha_1.3 #98 list\n. Other people are doing plugins, but Here we're developing PocketMine itself. \nSo you could try requesting that on MinecraftForums, there are people that does great plugins ;)\n. The glowstone bug has been just fixed ;)\ndb8e00ca4c7b4ce61ab8813374624f9a354a0f94\n. The water bug could be a client-side issue, due to bad block updating.\n\nBecause we're currently rewriting the entire update system, this could be fixed iin the future\n. Check #105 \n. If you check the FAQ, the directory for worlds is \"worlds/\"\nhttps://github.com/shoghicp/PocketMine-MP/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions\nAlso, drop the files itself, not the map folder. that way it'll work\n. An online plugin repository is being created ;)\nThe TrustPlayer plugin has been updated by the minepocket.com server. Also, have you tried contacting the original author on MC forums?\n. That is not my plugin. Please don't open new issues releated to new plugins, update plugins...\nAs I said on #108 #107 \nhttp://www.minecraftforum.net/forum/229-mcpe-mapping-and-modding/\n. That is not my plugin. As I said in #108 \nhttp://www.minecraftforum.net/forum/229-mcpe-mapping-and-modding/\n. We do not create plugins for PocketMine-MP, other people create plugins.\nYou should check& submit your suggestion here: http://www.minecraftforum.net/forum/229-mcpe-mapping-and-modding/\n. Also, try rebooting your mobile device or trying with another one. Sometimes, the device will refuse to see the server (only seen on iOS)\n. Do you have patched your Minecraft App with the IP or have you used the proxy?\nAlso, if you want, you can drop here your IP (so we can test it)\n. The port is 19132, no?\nThe port range for Minecraft PE servers is from 19132 to 19135. Check if your port is in that range.\n. Ok, I mean the port of the server itself\n. I'm doing a service scan to that server, looking for Minecraft PE server open ports\n. So, it seems that no server is running there. \nWhat does it says in the PocketMine server console?\n. Exactly as it says, an unknown packet for the Alpha_1.1\nThe Alpha_1.2 recognizes this packet, is the SendInventoryPacket (client-> server)\n. That would be more a Plugin than a vanilla feature ;)\n. It's explained on the Setting up a Server page, PocketMine itself contains a compile_php.sh script for compiling automatically PHP from source (you'll have to install MacPorts first, as the tutorial says)\n. I did not said any directory because you can install it anywhere ;)\nAnd yes, multiple Mac users have said it works\n. Those blocks of land aren't real, is a client-side issue. The map is being sent. You can import a map from MCPE and it won't be that \"buggy\".\nBesides, as the title says, it's in the Alpha spage, and lots of things are incomplete\n. Have you moved/copied the files to the \"worlds/\" folder? Only the files (\"*.dat\"), not the entire folder.\n. :D \nSolved!\n. That commit should fix that.\nThanks for reporting it!\n.

I'll try to get a VM image.\n. @krakjoe Lunick tested on his computer, that doesn't have Visual Studio 2012. The PocketMine installer contains the Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2012 bundled.\n. @krakjoe It's the same for me... If I was the one with that issue, I could have tested lots of things. Besides, unloading pthreads from the extension list causes the script to run, but since it forcefully needs pthreads, exits with a dependency error (expected behaviour).\n. @krakjoe I've tried it in all the Windows 8 machines that I've found for the same reason, and I couldn't reproduce it.\n. Hook into the player.join event, then check its info and change the gamemode property of the player. That'll set the correct gamemode to them\n. Change your username to another different than \"Steve\" or \"Stevie\"\n. Usernames must be longer that 1 character and shorter than 17. Only a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and _ characters are valid.\n. Maybe you've a whitelist. The last update made usernames case-insensitive, so now all the usernames on a whitelist must be in lower-case.\nDoes this solve your problem?\n. Closed due to #139 \n. You've to use the Linux Automatic Installer, get it at http://www.pocketmine.net/\nIf you've done this, please upload somewhere the \"install.log\" file and link it here.\n. We would need the install.log to check that, could be another issue\n. Thanks for reporting! Please use the latest Development release, it'll have the bug fixed\n. There are plugins that do that, check the MC Forums.\nNot vanilla-like features should be included in plugins\nhttp://www.minecraftforum.net/forum/232-mcpe-mods-tools/\n. Please check the latest Dev Release, it should have that fixed. Also, you can edit the whitelist so player have their username in lower case, because now it's checked in lowercase\n. As I've just wrote on the FAQ:\nDo not worry. That is the fake map generated by the client, but the server is sending the correct map.\nYou can import custom maps from MCPE, or download them from the MC Forums Please refer to the FAQ so you know how to import maps.\n. I'm sure you haven't done it right. You've to put all the .dat files into the root of worlds/, not into a folder. Then, the server will import it. After that, change the level on the server.properties\n. Import a map. Check the FAQ on the Wiki\n. Check #98 \nOnce these are supported, it'll be usable through plugins\n. Please upload anywhere the \"install.log\" and paste the link here\n. Try again with the latest development!\n. Yes, that is the problem here. Just stop the other instance.\n. Warning: socket_bind(): unable to bind address [98]: Address already in use in /home/will/Desktop/PocketMine-MPServer/src/network/UDPSocket.php on line 44\n. Don't change the server-ip. Leave it as \"0.0.0.0\"\nYou've to change the server-port\n. \"upward from work\", what do you mean?\n. Should behave better with this new Stable. Please report\n. It'll be fixed in Alpha_1.2.2 (will be released today).\nUse the GhostSignCleaner plugin as a temporal fix\n. Fixed!\n. Duplicated by #149 and #128 \n. Request one on the forums, and check again the FAQ. It works, trust me. You've to put the dat files on the ROOT of \"worlds/\"... then edit the server.properties\n. It's already on the TODO list for the next release ( #98 ), and it will behave similarly as you've said.\n. The player jerks or the player has lag (so it moves after a few seconds?)\n. ????\n. You can do that here: http://www.minecraftforum.net/forum/232-mcpe-mods-tools/\n. Try disabling the firewall first, it should work. If it works, then add the Firewall rule.

No, commits aren't deleted. The reason was that Github was taking a DDoS attack, and some fileservers didn't respond.\nI've manually downloaded the file URL, and it works now.\nThanks for reporting!\n.

That bug has been already fixed on it\n. you've to chmod 0755 the start.sh file\n. then, as the server says, upload somewhere the crash log and link it here...\n. If the client crash, it's due to the huge amount of new map data. Try closing other applications on the client.\nAlso, is the device iOS or Android? and which model?\n.

Hi @liberodark \nCurrently, as a open-source project, we won't be doing exclusive partnerships. I think that the creation of new host sites shouldn't be limited.\nBut, well, we can add these host sites in a Wiki page, with the note saying that no affiliation exists with PocketMine.\nWith that, host sites can get free advertising, without limiting the creation of new ones.\n. PocketMine will continue to be open-source. So, thanks for the offer.\nOnce we've finished the Alpha_1.3 release, I'll set up a page with \"Community Sites\", and in the hosting category, we'll add yours, for free.\nThanks for looking onto us\n.

Now you've to use the level property stored in a Position object (that Player, Entity, TileEntity, Block classes has as its parent), and call its getBlock(Vector3 $pos) or setBlock(Vector3 $pos, Block $block). Now you're forced to use objects as parameters\n. What version of PocketMine-MP are you using?\n. We changed the way we spawned blocks, expect it completely fixed on the 1.4 release\n. After #254 , items have evolved and can fall if they want. That is a true AI. Choosing by themselves if they want to stay there or not.\nPD: I'll fix this tomorrow\n. So, what kind of blocks? Is the item on the border of the block?\n. The crash is due to the spawn protection. Clients crash when the sign is removed.\n. That is not the issue. PocketMine follows the format to send Chunk Data, so the format that uses the server to store that is not responsible for that\n. @mrpi64 As @Brandon15811 says, Minecraft Pi is not compatible with Survival Mode. You must run the server on Creative mode or set that player to Creative mode (editing the player configuration on players/)\n. There is no option, because no normal generator is implemented yet. You can import worlds from MCPE while we implement that, though.\n. This is fixed. Run it with the latest dev. release\n. Thanks for reporting!\n. That enables the inventory checking via the server. It works perfectly in Creative mode (blocking hacked-in blocks), but in survival mode, it also blocks crafting (Mojang issue).\nSo that option exists if you want to activate it on survival mode, in creative mode it is always activated.\n.

That is why PHP doesn't have XML, so I don't have to compile it.\n. Fixed by 8e8002c479b989c2a25c498466c2c3f3ed1c63bb\n. We don't fix other people plugins. COntact the original author\n. I changed something that failed in the binary, a one-byte edit. I'm not going to recode the plugin\n. Once random updates are added, leaves will dissapear.\n. Thanks for reporting!\n. Yes, you can load a plugin as a Plugin itself ...\n. It is on the Alpha_1.3 To do list #98 \n. Can't see the image. Please, as the server says, upload the crash log\n. Closing for not enough information\n. If you paste the error I can do something...\n. Oh, don't worry. That is not an important error. It refers to the Web API\n. THis has been fixed like 2 months ago. Please use the latest dev. release when testing for bugs.\n. Yes, it is known, the client crashes when placing a sign where it can't be placed. So the server reverts the change and the client crashes\n. Thanks for reporting!\n. At least, please read the #182 To Do list. That is added there ;)\n. That bug is fixed on the alpha 1.3 :(\nYou may have to wait for the plugin dev. to update their plugins\n. Maybe you're using outdated plugins. Haven't you read the \"It may crash or corrupt the server warning?\n. Yes you are. Check the image you've added to the issue\n. Since in Minecraft PE creative players can't get drops... Maybe we should disable that, though PC Minecraft drops paintings in Creative mode\n. Ok, so creative players will be able to take dropped items (but not use them, items will be removed from the map)\n. Thanks for reporting, it seems that there are some special cases for Trapdoor placement\n. Testing it\n. Please check if it's fixed\n. :)\n. Please use a public screenshot. Also, that is caused due to a plugin, so it is not releated to PocketMine. COntact the original plugin author\n. Please send the crash log, or I'll continue to ignore your bug reports. As I said, THE IMAGE LINK THAT YOU PASTE THERE IS PRIVATE, and no useful info related from plugins is there.\n. So... what command are you trying to run? [If the command is related to any plugin, including my plugins, you should have posted that in the Issues page on the Plugin repo]\n. Are you using signconsole? That plugin is not updated yet. There is a BIG RED WARNING at the start of the server saying that\n. Thanks for reporting!\n. You've to implement the Plugin interface. that is __construct(), init() and __destruct(). Check the example plugin for the correct parameters\n. The server doesn't send lightning data - That is calculated in the client side. I can't do anything\n. you're accessing the $data array. That array doesn't contain that. In fact, player.vome contains a Player object, as $data[\"player\"]\n. Because the TPS get lower than 15 sometimes. That is when the server says that\n. That is already in the Alpha_1.4 todo list.\n. This is a duplicate of #274 \n. Now PocketMine-MP includes an algorithm to calculate the correct time offset.\n. Changed that so now only flowable blocks can be placed that way.\n. You should get bunch of errors during server start. Look at that, plugins are outdated\n. Try the new one and report ;)\nYou can do ./INSTALLER_SCRIPT.sh -du to update directly to the latest dev. version without re-compiling\n. Vanilla PocketMine-MP doesn't have this issue. Could be caused due to installed plugins\n. Fixed by be83eaf521f09e75babe888354a40bb36ca56bae\n. That was announced, PocketMine now uses PHP 5.5, that doesn't support Windows XP. You can install manually an old version of PocketMine and then copy over the new version of PocketMine\n. Torches have this issue fixed, but they have lag of half a second before the block itself disappears\n. @Coccy If an user spams the repository or abuses it, it'll be blocked from the entire PocketMine org. repositories.\n. Did this work?\n. please add \"debug=3\" in your server.properties and test again\n. I've changed the pthreads release, please test this again compiling PHP\n. Related to #317 \n. Fixed with 3d3383bea73dd45b2a9f767fc0536789303a9266\n. tell me\n. Mojang related, check https://mojang.atlassian.net/browse/MCPE\n. that can be done using plugins ;). Also, beds (in the future)\n. This is due to an outdated plugin. By the way, I'm releasing updates very fast, I'm fixing lots of bugs that appear\n. there are commands available right now ;) \"/help\"\n. @MinecraftAddict131  It works\n. @zhuowei that should be added in the future. I'll add it to the list, but it is not a priority\n. That is a Mojang issue. cake is already on the to do list\n. @electricurrent Creative or Survival?\n. @electricurrent iOS?\n. Then this issue should be fixed with 0.7.1, as @Zhoroaan said.\nThis is a duplicate of #282 \n. @williamtdr I need the exact conditions:\n- Complete inventory, with the count and position of each block (including variations of blocks)\n- Where are you crafting (inventory, workbench, stonecutter)\n- Kick message\n. Thanks for reporting the bug!\n. Are you on the latest dev. release? This bug was fixed in some update\n. Try again with the latest release\n. Try re-compiling PHP\n. Duplicated issue, please don't reopen new ones with the same topic\n. The dev. release supports 0.7.1\n. directly. use the dev. release\n. It loads. Use the ZIP button in the repo.\n. Please update your server correctly. Follow the Setting up a Server page\n. Don't give yourself AIR. THis is not a PocketMine issue\n. Once all block and items are implemented, we can check that\n. We're looking into this. It is a memory leak caused by unknown reasons\n. Liquids don't flow right now.\n. @PEPlayer that has been already added\n. No, it is not. We have had that issue since the start. Anyway, pocketmine can run without it, but you won't get syntax coloring.\n. Changes are saved automatically. You don't have to use the /save-all command, it is only used when the /save-off is active\n. It has been delayed until the release of the stable Alpha_1.3.1\n. Please update your server properly\nhttps://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/wiki/Setting-up-a-Server#wiki-update\n. @gabsx23 If there are paintings in the world you are being teleported back, you will crash. It is a Mojang bug, documented on #1098 \nThe bug was reported in Mojira MCPE-6790, and Johan was contacted about it.\n. or you can /op yourself\n. Thanks for reporting!\n. This is added to the todo list.\n. You should \"return false\" to end it. \"return true\" only stops the handler chain\n. yeah, because that is the check. you return false to indicate that the user can't run that command. You return true to say that the command has been already executed.\n. You've to use the setBlock with a Vector3, then a Block object.\nLevel::setBlock(Vector3, Block)\n. Related log:\nhttp://pastebin.com/Ebtigvth\n. More logs:\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/download/xtbxcrmm17wsxxh/console_log.zip\n. Please give feedback\n. @1ron-pon3 I've a fix that I haven't released yet. It should have been released just after this one.... but for an unknown reasin it hasn't. I'll try again in a few hours\n. PocketMine-MP Contribution Gidelines\nI'll only do plugins when I've the time and idea to do so. I expect that the majority of my plugins will be surpassed in the future.\n. Use PHP_5.4.15_ARM_Raspbian_hard.tar\nAlso, run the latest stable.\n. You can hook in the same events as cmdWhitelist does, then act before it.\n. Just a test of an infinite loop in the IRC xD\n. Duplicate of #391 \n. Use 0.0.0.0 as your server-ip. That is described on the server.properties page\n. Thanks for reporting!\n. A timeout of 1 minute was added to arrows. I've improved it so they get called automatically\n. This is a Client Crash. Please don't give yourself Air\n. Please check the Guidelines befure creating an Issue. We don't give support for third-party plugins. Please contact the original author\n. This is a Mojang issue. We can't do anything here, even Mojang does this for Realms\n. Your level is corrupted, it could have been due to the crash. Could you paste the crash dump here?\n. Try with the newest release. The crash dump is saved on the root folder as Error_Dump[...].log\n. Please paste the list of plugins you are using, and some related info that could help on this.\n. One of your plugins may be incompatible with PocketMine. please contact the original author\n. This will be added in the future.\n. Please close your server correctly using \"stop\" on the console\n. Why did he ban you? That should be a kick\n. Ok.\nwilliamtdr, please post all code snippets into an external page. As Intyre said, it is really annoying and spams the channel. I though I said that before ;).\nAnyways, this repository is only for posting PocketMine-MP issues.\nYou have a warning for doing that, please be kind and use pastie.org, pastebin.com or the hackpad.com that you use.\n. @Syriamanal for harassing the team, you have been permanently banned from IRC, the forums, and my mind. Any further replies will be ignored. You made an account again, it will be banned.\n. Use the PocketMine-MP installer\n. Yeah, it is a typo. I'll change it on the next commit\n. This is a Mojang Issue. I'll open an issue in their tracker now\n. MCPE-4556\nPacket Dump\n@Zhoroaan should check this\n. Fixed on Mojira. Will be fixed on the MCPE 0.7.4 release\n. This is a Windows issue. I can't do anything about this. Translation will only work for ASCII chars (in console)\n. Use `CFLAGS=\"-mx32\"\n. Try with the latest dev with CFLAGS=\"-mx32 -O1\" ./src/compile/build.sh\n. zlib compilation is simple, but fails sometimes like that. I'll test more tomorrow\n. @twkrol I added pre-compiled binaries, and a few patches for 64-bit compilation. Try running the installer script provided on the homepage\n. Fixed\n. We have updated the compile script to be able to work on Mac now\n. We are going to add multilanguage support in the future, but first, we have to sort some Windows console problems\n. We have fixed this on the latest release\n. you can use raw setBlock()\n. @msape-dev1307 We are developing an external library for RakNet stuff (MCPE is written on top of RakNet). it will support multiple threads + more advanced features\n. As I said, it is weird, we have to rewrite the schedule methods so everything can work right.\n. Please pack the logs and any crash log too, with the player data.\n. Are you logging it through the new PocketMine Realms login? You have to log in through there so your account cannot be spoofed. It is a security measure\n. Falling into an pool with only one block of block in Minecraft won't block the fall damage, only two or more\n. Fixed on PocketMine-MP Alpha_1.3.5\n. Try the new installer, and report if it works\n. Could you run inside the pocketmine folder bin\\php\\php -m and show the output?\n. Could you replace the entire bin folder with this?\nhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/pocketmine/files/builds/PHP_5.4.19_x86_Windows.zip\nIt is an older release, but if that one works, we can start from there\n. Have you tried them?\n. @DarkN3ss61 But you need specific binaries for PHP, due to the requirement of a Thread-Safe PHP + pthreads\n. SimpleAuth prevents that, but if Mojang gives us a nice player checking API we will add that to PocketMine-MP itself\n. This will be fixed on the Apha_1.3.7 release ;)\n. I added a random offset to dropped items. That should fix this a bit, but it will be fully fixed in the 1.4 release\n. We have fixed this. Once Alpha_1.3.6 is out, you'll be able to import it. Two chunks are lost, though. It is MCEdit fault\n. This is a feature that is being worked on. Do not expect stable commits right now\n. We had a few issues with the main site ;). Download them on github\n. We have already fixed that in the dev. release, we will release a new stable today with more fixes\n. This is a case of dowloading plugins incorrectly. Thanks @M1dgard \n. That will be hopefully fixed on the 0.7.4 release. Some users have downgraded to the 0.7.2 so they don't timeout\n. It is a MCPE issue, we can't do anything to fix that right now\n. It is a Plugin issue. Please contact the original author\n. MCPE puts the spawn inside the terrain sometimes. MCEdit fixes that. We have implemented the Level::getSafeSpawn() on the Alpha_1.3.7 that fixes this, and it will be released with MCPE 0.7.4 \n. Fixed on the next version\n. MCPE bug, it is resolved on the 0.7.4 version\n. Please refer to the Spawn With Items plugin for help\n. Update your server\n. It has been fixed on the latest dev. ;)\n. We have compiled new pre-compiled Mac binaries with cURL bundled, so that won't be a problem in the future. Keep an eye on Twitter, we will announce that there.\n. Have you tried the command CFLAGS=-mx32 ./src/build/compile.sh?\n. Install it using the installer provided on the homepage\n. Please check that you don't have any incompatible plugins\n. Oh, that is a way of PocketMine to save bandwidth. It may not be required anymore because that was a limit imposed in the \"old days\" when we didn't had enough information about the network protocol. Removing that on the Alpha_1.3.9 (will be released today)\n. It has been fixed in the same release. We messed up a lot of things in this one :(\n. Players are only allowed if their username is from 3 to 16 long, and contains only A-Z a-z 0-9 and _\nThat is the way Mojang usernames are\n. Duplicate of several issues. Will be fixed on the 1.4 release\n. Please update your PocketMine-MP version. This has been fixed in the latest stable release\n. This is due to the item physics working incorrectly. I said multiple times that this will be fixed int he 1.4 release\n. You'll need to compile PHP with libedit support, but it is broken right now.\n. Yes, libedit/readline handles that. At least I've tested the history ;)\nOn the compile.sh script there is an entry for libedit, but it fails a lot\n. Forgot an \"else\". It tried to start the server again with PHP on $PATH\n. Are you connecting via 3G?\n. Hta is weird. Could you issue sudo PLAYERNAME status on the console? Tell me hat is shown on the client\n. Do sudo PLAYERNAME ping now\n. I think that is due to the old packet recovery algorithm. We are rewriting that code because it caused lots of issues, mainly lag. It should be fixed completly in 1.4.\nTry using Wireshark or the MCPE Proxy to view the packets sent/received.\n. The 1.4 release is a complete rewrite, so we can't get a release date. Not today ;)\nOn the player lag, we send entity position updates if the entity has moved each 2 ticks for players(0.1 seconds), and each 0.5 seconds for other Entities.\nPlease check that you are using the latest stable release (or test with the dev.), and be sure to remove the src folder before updating to solve any problem related to file overwriting.\n. Try doing CFLAGS=\"-mx32\" ./src/build/compile.sh. It needs time to build PHP with its dependencies from source code.\n. Try installing it using the instaler, then updating to the latest dev removing the src folder and overwriting everything.\nAlso, those are the MC format codes (for future things) that should have been removed before sending it to the console\n. I knew about this issue only a few days ago. I'll try to sort it.\n. This happens when there are multiple worlds ;)\n. This is fixed in 1.4 (players are handled like other entities, not globally like before)\n. If it is a plugin don't report it here. Plugins should be fixed by the plugin developers itself.\n. @kvwang98 And that causes items to disappear. That was how it was done before, and then users complained about blocks getting sucked by the floor. Remember, all of these solutions ARE NOT PROPER SOLUTIONS. Only implementing proper physics is the correct solution\n. @kvwang98 No, it uses less CPU than this method.\n. @kvwang98 less\n. Steps:\n1. Download the  Vista+ installer. Unzip it on the directory.\n2. Remove the bin/php folder\n3. Replace the bin/php folder with a newly downloaded PHP binary (re-download it).\n. Expect a proper fix soon.\n. Rcon doesn't work on Minecraft PC too in some Android apps too ;).\nIt doesn't work due to your webhost blocking sockets/UDP. Try checking it using http://dinnerbone.com/minecraft/tools/status/\n. @sekjun9878 They are parsed, so they can be removed.\nI've implemented a straightforward way to do that on the latest dev. Just do ./start.sh --disable-ansi\n. @sekjun9878 They are parsed, so they can be removed.\nI've implemented a straightforward way to do that on the latest dev. Just do ./start.sh --disable-ansi\n.

This includes entities. Please refer from creating these issues, I'll close all of them. \n. @d-chord We are implementing proper physics on the Alpha_1.4, but the actual work is being done on the Core-Rewrite branch (warning: crashy!)\n. @d-chord Well, it is in the course of being rewritten, we will merge it back to master once it is done\n. @lesander It was fixed on the beta, but broken again on a later build. I'm aware of this issue\n. @erichexter You can jump directly on the IRC, #pocketmine or #mcpedevs @ freenode. We have a mailing list only for releases and commit notifications.\nI'm currently rewriting everything on the Core-Rewrite branch\n. @G33kDude could you specify more information, and fill a bug report on Mojira?\nLink the created issue back here so we can track it too.\n.

Please update the translation in Crowdin\nWe use that tool to manage the translations, so you can update them, or vote the best ones.\n. Try joining a server using Play -> Edit -> External ;D\n. If you want to update the translation, you have to do it on translate.pocketmine.net\n. Please update the translation in Crowdin\nWe use that tool to manage the translations, so you can update them, or vote the best ones.\n. As I said on #1087:\nPlease update the translation in Crowdin\nWe use that tool to manage the translations, so you can update them, or vote the best ones.\n. That requires access to a translation service. Most of them are not free and require an API key, for example, Google Translate.\nThis won't be implemented in PocketMine-MP, though anyone can create a plugin for that\n. let's implement this after world generation and mobs have been implemented ;)\n. hmm, I'll check if paintings are despawned properly on level change\n. Seems like even after the packet has been sent, they are still not removed from the client memory, only removed visually.\n. Filled a bug report on Mojira MCPE-6790 @jbernhardsson\n. Thanks ;)\nThose coding sessions in the night...\n. Does this happen on PocketMine-MP servers or in vanilla MCPE servers?\n. Weird, I couldn't reproduce it. Could you give me more details?\n(Like plugins installed, the item dropped, your coords., everything you can think of)\n. Oh, I tried at the bottom of the map, on the center. I'll try now but on the edge.\n. I've confirmed it, thanks for reporting it. We will commit a fix soon.\n. Reopened and closed again. Like when you open a door again, say something, and slam it again\n. Just add an alias ;)\n. That is caused by a plugin, try removing each plugin sequentially to identify it\n. oops, forgot to add that when adding multiworld support. thanks!\n. Stop giving OP to all players\n. @JWhy what you said is not true. I do the dev on a server with generated worlds, and player files. Nothing there appears on the commits ;)\nI put the only files needed to be ignored. I removed long ago all the things that are left by other programs, so just configure your program to not leave things in there, instead of trying to change this\n. I've updated that page, it was really outdated\nhttps://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#wiki-how-do-i-connect-to-the-server\n. An user can enter if:\n- The player is OP\n- The player is on the whitelist\n- A plugin returns false on api.ban.whitelist.check\n. We have updated the required min. pthreads version from 0.0.45 to the 0.1.0 version. Linux users can use the included compiler script to generate the new PHP build, while windows users can download this and replace the existing files on the PHP binaries extensions.\n. We have updated the required min. pthreads version from 0.0.45 to the 0.1.0 version. Linux users can use the included compiler script to generate the new PHP build, while windows users can download this and replace the existing files on the PHP binaries extensions.\n. @iksaku only if you update manually ;)\n. yep, the one that I just put there is better. you can do\ncurl -sL http://cdn.pocketmine.net/installer.sh | bash -s - -v master to update to the master version directly\n. This is caused due to the tool closing the socket\n. Please fix it on the Crowdin Project for PocketMine\nWe get all the strings from there\n. use the latest dev. to compile PHP\n. curl -skL https://raw.github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/master/src/build/installer.sh | bash -s - -v master\n. curl -skL https://raw.github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/master/src/build/installer.sh | bash -s - -v master\n. There is not enough information.\n. Only OPs ;)\n. See #1144\n. Fixed by 9cc624b74e5cdfa4749fdda10213070fc576b603\n. See #1143\n. because that is player.block.activate\n. Seems like a YAML error, send the yaml files here\n. The inventory is saved for each player. You can disable inventory dropping via plugins, or disable PvP completly\n. http://sourceforge.net/projects/pocketmine/files/builds/PHP_5.5.8_x86_Windows.zip/download\n. @iksaku is this on the latest dev.?\n. @iksaku Did you see any fix?\n. @tnpxxsheepdog that is a known isue when you do not stop the server correctly. It must always be stopped using \"stop\"\n. Try doing wget -q -O - http://cdn.pocketmine.net/installer.sh | bash -s - -v master to use the latest dev. version\n. @WilfulTravesty The date error is being tracked on #1152\nI'll close this issue as this bug seems to have been fixed on the latest dev.\n. Xdebug\n. The latest dev. release supports /spawnpoint [player | w:world] [x] [y] [z] now, use /spawnpoint w:world x y z to change it\n. No, it was removed. use the Config class, it now uses the PHP Yaml extension\n. oh, right, that is the outdated part. I'll fix that\n. How did this happen? What plugins are you using?\n. It is intended, everything else (phpize, opcache, mysqli) will be added once I compile it again. Crosscompiling causes a few issues with the extensions.\nThe binary alone is ok to run PocketMine-MP, everything else is optional ;)\n. ah, true. The path is incomplete, but it doesn't matter as the php binary has default values. Thanks for reporting it, though \n. I'll push changes soon, I'm still working on better Android PHP binaries\n. Tell me if this fix works. I also added the ability to get all the matching players\n. If you use the master, you don't have to move the binary ;)\n. In the Raspberry Pi tab you have wget -q -O - http://cdn.pocketmine.net/installer.sh | bash -s - -v master\nThat installs the master\n. Have you tested this on the latest dev. version?\n. @chesmith don't mind @Rexo52, he likes to get a comment on every Issue, and not really helping.\nThanks for reporting this ;)\n. @chesmith You can get the new PHP binaries on https://sourceforge.net/projects/pocketmine/files/builds/PHP_5.5.8_x86_Windows.zip\n. upload the install.log script somewhere and link it here\n. Uh, right xD\n. You can't get the original MAC address\n. We will redesign the Entity system in a few days ;)\n. please explain the bug\n. It is a feature because this is not implemented in PocketMine\n. Use the installer provided on the homepage, and replace Alpha_1.3.11 with master\n. Could you post the server.properties file here?\n. Is there a message shown on the console when the player joins?\n. oh, and try to use the latest dev. version\n. Download http://sourceforge.net/projects/pocketmine/files/builds/PHP_5.5.8_x86_Windows.zip and replace the bin/ folder with those ones.\n. The Faster-Network branch merge fixed this\n. it works on an iPhone 4\ntry running ./bin/php5/bin/php -v\n. run ./bin/php5/bin/php PocketMine-MP.php on that directory\n. We will add a Cydia repo for easy installation soon\n. this is due to a plugin, try removing them one by one to find the one that causes this\n. You are sending invalid yaw or pitch to the entities\n. This command can be called using three different ways:\n/gamemode 1, affects the corrent player\n/gamemode player 1 and /gamemode 1 player. Are the last two ones handled OK?\n. Is this a pull request that fixes another pull request?\n. Well, you could have put a better description.\nBut this will do xD\n. We changed the way we name things. Check the \"Code Names\" page on the Wiki\n. This happens due to the change of an extension, a few worlds might be affected. Could you upload the tiles.yml file?\n. Use WorldEditor ;)\n. yes\n. We are not adding these events yet, the Entity structure is being rewritten.\nExpect major work on this in a 4-7 days, after I implement them.\n. it was a bug in the code before, so all the old tiles (that were \"corrupted\")  had to be removed\n. this won't happen in 1.4 ;)\n. Use the installer to install the Visual C++ libraries\n. set spawn-protection to -1\n. it is limited my the minecraft protocol. you can set the spawnpoint for players in decimal, but the client will move the compass using integers\n. @Rexo52 limit your OPs\n. @Rexo52 don't OP everyone\n. It is an error message, type SEVERE\n. The damage is counted from zero. Zero = new, 1 = one use\n. oops, thanks!\n. This is not the place to ask this\n. translate.pocketmine.net\n. are you running it on Android or iOS? you need a powerful device to run it properly\n. The old tiles.yml was corrupted\n. Update again, fixed ;)\nWe are testing things in the master, things can break.\n. @PEMapModder this is not the place to ask. The ban expires on 2014-02-22, do not try to bypass it because that means direct permanent ban.\n. Send the sign data using Tile object -> spawn()\nYou are not sending any data, please refer from using raw packets when possible\n. Mobs are still not implemented. They will be added in the next update\n. It might be caused by a plugin, but this fixes it too ;)\n. @kenlauescuadro Update to the latest stable release, and try again\n. Level object->setTime() allows you the set the time directly.\n. no, that is not how vanilla Minecraft works\n. This is already being worked on the Entities branch. Do not duplicate Issues, this has been reported a bunch of times (and they are still open). Please use the search before posting a new one\n. Are you using the pre-compiled binary?\n. OS Version?\n. @iksaku As I asked, can you tell me the OS version?\n. @mnminer @iskaku @iksaku @miro5879 Please try installing PocketMine-MP, I've updated the binaries\n. @iksaku Have you done it using the wget -q -O - http://cdn.pocketmine.net/installer.sh | bash -s - -v Alpha_1.3.12 command?\n. @iksaku I've added a check to the installer, now it will compile PHP when it fails. Also, please post the output of uname -a here so I can generate a build for it too.\n. Install the OpenSSL libraries on your system (depends on the OS)\nDo wget -q -O - http://cdn.pocketmine.net/installer.sh | bash -s - -v master\nIf it works, use wget -q -O - http://cdn.pocketmine.net/installer.sh | bash -s - -uv Alpha_1.3.12\n. Try those commands without installing OpenSSL, it might be there already\n. @iksaku I've updated the binaries again, this time with built-in OpenSSL. Tell me if they work\n. \\o/\n. This might be lag, or that you have a plugin that blocks PvP (and blocks destroying entities)\n. This is a duplicate of #1233 \nWe are tracking this problem there\n. Duplicate of #1233 \n. Is there a plugin installed that sets blocks too fast? That could cause this bug.\n. @kvwang98 Well, that explains the error\n. Well, the Alpha_1.4dev doesn't use this scheme, so this is invalid for the current Entity branch\n. no, because you used an invalid world (maybe you updated to 1.4, and 1.3.x won't support the new upgraded maps\n. Well, pthreads still has issues. Updating to 0.1.0 forcefully for everyone opens more options, but you can't share arrays and object arrays are to properly removed, so it causes a huge memory leak. I might move world generation to other threads, since that can be done easily, but other things must wait.\n. You did not install PHP using one of the installers provided on the homepage\n. We are fixing this right now. In a few minutes new binaries will be uploaded, and the installer updated. I'll comment here once it is done\n. @iburritto Try doing curl -sL http://cdn.pocketmine.net/installer.sh | bash -s - -v Alpha_1.3.12 now\n. Can you do uname -a on the Terminal and post the result here?\n. What is the output of the installer?\n. In Minecraft (and normal Mojang accounts) it is 16\n. In Minecraft (and normal Mojang accounts) it is 16\n. http://translate.pocketmine.net/\nFix it there, not here.\n. is the same error as on #1245 ?\n. I'll open that issue again\n. This development release is highly unstable, uses a new map format. Reset the map and try with a new one\n. @UltimateMcraft It is a known bug for the app, the next release has it fixed. While then, you can uninstall the app and install it again, or remove the src folder so it can be installed properly again from the Version Manager\n. update to the latest last dev. It is really inestable, I already said that\n. http://www.pocketmine.net/\n. This has been already fixed on the dev. version 4352fce82ddb1ee92ee042b0e3d12c19c43ee34f\n. Well, PHP 64-bit for Windows is not forcefully needed to run. The 32 version runs fine, and as PHP.net says: \"The x64 builds of PHP for Windows should be considered experimental, and do not yet provide 64-bit integer or large file support.\"\nhttp://marc.info/?l=php-internals&m=137002754604365&w=2\n. It is already for Windows\n. Already fixed, update\n. @PEMapModder retport to @MCMrARM\n. @PEMapModder yes, read the description. It was released in collaboration with MrARM\n. @PEMapModder well, I provide things, and he codes the most part. All the bugs that I get for the app are tested, and if they exist, they get sent to MrARM :)\n. @xxBlueEndersxx We are aware of this bug, and we have already fixed it, but we can't update the app right now.\nYou can do two things:\n- Go to /storage/sdcard0/PocketMine/ and delete the src/ folder, then download a new version\n- Uninstall the app and install it again\n. Please ask the plugin author\n. https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/blob/master/LICENSE\n. @nlmunro They are being implemented in the Alpha_1.4dev, after the Entity rewrite has been done. They weren't added because people would complain more if they were in and not being able to place minecarts, so we just left them out.\n. @PEMapModder no. You can leave the rails on a map ported. Not place them\n. the cause of the crash is due to PHP itself, not PocketMine-MP. A warning or less error does not cause a crash, it is only the last error message.\nCould you upload the full crash log?\n. User[/IP:port] logged out due to server stop is a placeholder for the real details, right?\nAre you using the pre-compiled binaries? If you do, are them the latest?\nIf they are, this seems like an error in the binary, so you can try doing a custom PHP build for your system, running ./src/build/compile.sh\n. @PEMapModder on PHP, float is equal to double.\nThis will be fixed in the future\n. This crash was due to unknown causes. The E_WARNING error is just the last packet that got in\n. Thanks for finding it! I can't test it right now, but it should work as intended now. Can you confirm it?\nA few programs worked correctly with the actual implementation, but others failed, so it was weird :S\n. @NoahDev why do you want to merge the changes that are not ready yet?\n. it's a warning - the server starts correctly\n. You have to use return true or return false to stop its execution. return only continues.\n. @NoahDev why would we want to have this, if you can modify it directly?\n. Also, do the pull request correctly\n. LICENSE is needed\nREADME.md is needed\nCONTRIBUTING.md is needed\nOther files are hidden\n. @PEMapModder exactly that. You will be able to bundle all kind of things on plugins\n. @must-lleibl They are able to read minds, and change the world.\n. @zhuowei Well, I've already rewrote all of this. Now I've to finish writing everything so I can test that again\n. @PEMapModder Read about namespaces, organization, error handling. They are pretty basic things\n. @PEMapModder There were, also, the problem with big plugins and their class importing.\n. @linuxboytoo They already have their own classes. We would like to expand the classes to cover all the items, but at least, you can check the item type with getID()\n. This is being closed, and some of the remaining tasks will be moved to a new 1.5 list.\n. You need to load the world before teleporting to it. Also, this is not the place for SimpleWorlds support\n. The long click is weird... I'll have to check this even more\n. I'll have to check this since it changed in 1.4 :)\n. Well, I know, but I left it there because you have to get them from somewhere :P \nIt will be different with infinite worlds ;)\n. ...\njust use $data->sendChat() without modifying it. you are calling an object, right? Why do you even modify it? \nRemember that THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO ASK FOR PLUGIN SUPPORT\n. @PEMapModder @ijoshuahd he has been blocked from the PocketMine organization, I had to contact the Github team, So stop the discussion.\n. Where are the blocks? And constants? It will give an error when crafting.\n. I think they are a different block - I'll check later. Also, commit everything on the same branch (and pull request)\n. Invalid, they are different blocks\n. They are just proxy methods. Leave them alone ;)\n. Have you tried using the installer provided on the homepage? It ships with pre-compiled binaries.\n. Can you try doing OPENSSL_TARGET=\"linux-x86_64\" CFLAGS=\"-m64\" march=x86-64 mtune=none ./src/build/compile.sh linux openssl from that folder?\n. @Jemrada Did the command before work?\nTry doing bin/php5/bin/php -v\n. Try CFLAGS=\"-m64\" march=x86-64 mtune=none ./src/build/compile.sh. If it doesn't work, try CFLAGS=\"-mx32\" march=i686 mtune=none ./src/build/compile.sh\n. @Jemrada Well, save the -m64 binaries and run wget -q -O - http://cdn.pocketmine.net/installer.sh | bash -s - -uv Alpha_1.3.12. This will replace the code but not the binaries\n. :D \nWe will try to support special cases like this in the future. From the logs, the uname -a was Linux server.sabrada.com 2.6.32-71.29.1.el6.x86_64 #1 SMP Mon Jun 27 19:49:27 BST 2011 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux, right? Could you leave here the output of cat /proc/cpuinfo for future reference?\n. SimpleAuth doesn't lag the server (on the latest release). Update all your plugins\n. @PEMapModder You can download them without even being logged in. It is meant to be completly public\n. It is not in another thread. We are thinking to have them in another thread for the Alpha_1.4, but it is not in the stable. Besides, the dev. version doesn't have this problem anymore.\n. because of server ticks\n. Check for bad plugins\n. @TheChriscraftMC Try removing each one\n. Thanks for the trace! You can safely ignore the message ;)\nThis code doesn't exist on the Alpha_1.4 anymore\n. Fixed in Core-Rewrite a few days ago\n. @wrewolf Warning! Major rewrite going there. Most of the things are disabled, or broken\n. wait\n. it will be on the 1.4 release. Now new things for Windows, optimizations are only for Linux / MacOS.\nStop spamming issues\n. Install a PocketMine-MP version from the Version Manager window.\nThis is not the place to ask for PocketMine-MP for Android support\n. Do you have enable-advanced-cache to on?\n. You have to stop the server using \"stop\", also check if \"auto-save\" is enabled on the server.properties\n. Are you OP on the server? If you place blocks in the spawn area and the spawn protection is enabled (by default), you won't be able to place them. Be sure to OP your player using op playerName\n. This is an error of MinecraftPE, sometimes chunks are marked as \"dead\" and they are not allowed to receive new chunks\n. @PEMapModder Are you joking? sending 32768 blocks (491520 bytes!, 0.5MB!) means athat amount of packets. Also, when I mean marked as \"dead\", they can accept block updates at first, but they will even refuse them after that\n. remove server-ip=108.196.205.65 from your server.properties\n. We won't provide updates to the Alpha_1.3.12 API anymore. The Alpha_1.4 has an easy way to do this already\n. Use the official PocketMine-MP for Android app\n. I'll add an Interface. as specified in the 1.4 to do list, this is not the place to add new things. \n. You can't send individual hotbar slots, because the client doesn't send the place they are stored to. This is a MCPE thing.\n. Try using an older build from http://sourceforge.net/projects/pocketmine/files/builds/\n. It must be loaded for it to be converted\n. Always use \"stop\" to restart/stop your server. Closing it using the \"X\" will cause items to be lost\n. Blame Entity::environmentUpdate()\n. This is from 1.3.12, 1.4 has different code\n. Do not EVER modify the server-ip for normal purposes.\n. NO, we do it like normal Minecraft\n. @PEMapModder haha ;)\nDo you even know that all the work is done on other branches?\nIt's on the #1288 \nI'm closing this since it is being used like a forum by some participants. It will be added properly in 1.4, since the block update (used in liquid movement) was bugged in <= 1.3.12\n. https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions\n. @jcliving You have to add the identifiers in BlockAPI.php\n. Oh, anything that is committed in your repo will be added here.\n. @jcliving Just push the remaining changes to your fork, they will be added here automatically.\n. This has been included into the pocketmine core today\n. OP = operator, administrator of the server.\n. Do a pull request on the original pull request.\n. Use the Alpha_1.3.12, not the Alpha_1.3.10\n. Use the latest stable\n. Always stop the server using \"stop\" or \"/stop\". That is what caused the corruption. Try using the level.pmf file available on https://sourceforge.net/projects/pocketmine/files/ to try to recover chunks, you will get a crapton of warnings and notices\n. @PEMapModder It recovers using that file, it has all the indexes to 0x00FF, meaning that chunks will be stacked, and non-existent ones updated. If the map has big air spaces below the map, they will be shifted down\n. Contact the plugin author\n. Stop opening new spam issues.\n. Already reported, duplicate\n. Already reported and fixed\n. Not valid in current development context\n. Stop spamming issues\n. Check Core-Rewrite before opening issues, you are only contributing to the question spam. This is not a place for questions\n. There was more bugs behind that code D:\nI've added a fix to those bugs too, I'll push them after I finish my current work\n. @kvwang98 I start coding the framework :)\nYou can check the firsts commits of PocketMine-MP\n. Only commit the changes needed, not extra things. Also, SEVERE must be SEVERE, not SERVER\n. @kvwang98 Create a single branch for each feature, as the Contribution Guidelines say. If you don't follow them, contributions will be refused\n. no, it has been already fixed. Wait for it to be pushed (I've a long backlog)\n. @kvwang98 Did you even check the Core-Rewrite one?\nStop using the issue tracker as a forum\n. Do not report things on Core-Rewrite. It is internal code and it will crash. Only report things on the master branch\n. Not enough details available, invalid issue\n. Stop spamming issues\n. This command needs debug.commands=on on the server.properties\n. Since physics have not been added yet, entities are not spawned. Also, they won't require you to send raw packets\n. change the port to 19133, or close MCPE\n. Use a single feature branch for the changes, this doesn't follow the contribution guidelines. Also, you included other changes not described\n. I'm building new PHP binaries on jenkins, I'll report back once everything is ready. I think this is caused by PHP crashing, so the last error saved is a \"false error\"\n. Do wget -q -O - http://get.pocketmine.net/ | bash -s - -v Alpha_1.3.12\nit will update the PHP binaries PocketMine-MP uses to the new ones, tell me if the crashes stop\n. Well, this is strange. It crashes without a reason...\nHas the network went down while the server was up? could be related to a socket error\n. Is it shutting down when started normally via the terminal?\n. Well, readline failed to compile before, so there is no history or \"clean\" text pointer.\nTry starting the server with bash -i location_of_pocketmine/start.sh (on the autorun)\n. What is the absolute path where PocketMine-MP is?\nI'll get back with a script to start PocketMine-MP as a daemon service, so it runs on the background at system start.\n. Create this file on the PocketMine-MP directory and name it daemon.sh (I've posted it to https://gist.github.com/shoghicp/10000415 too for future reference)\nOn the Terminal, run chmod +x /home/user/daemon.sh\nNow, replace your command on \"Startup Applications\" to bash /home/user/daemon.sh start\nIf you want to stop/restart/start the server manually, you just have to run /home/user/daemon.sh ACTION_HERE on the Terminal\nTell me if this works! That is an interesting project you got there :)\nThe daemon.sh file:\n```\n!/bin/sh\nPOCKETMINE_PATH=\"/home/user\"\nSTART_OPTS=\"--start --background --make-pidfile --pidfile '$POCKETMINE_PATH/pocketmine.pid' --exec /bin/bash '$POCKETMINE_PATH/start.sh'\"\nSTOP_OPTS=\"--stop --pidfile $POCKETMINE_PATH/pocketmine.pid\"\ntest -x $DAEMON || exit 0\nset -e\ncase \"$1\" in\n    start)\n        echo -n \"Starting PocketMine-MP: \"\n        start-stop-daemon $START_OPTS > /dev/null\n        echo \"ok.\"\n        ;;\n    stop)\n        echo -n \"Stopping PocketMine-MP: \"\n        start-stop-daemon $STOP_OPTS\n        echo \"ok.\"\n        rm -f /var/run/pocketmine.pid\n        ;;\n    restart|force-reload)\n        echo -n \"Restarting PocketMine-MP: \"\n        start-stop-daemon $STOP_OPTS\n        sleep 1\n        start-stop-daemon $START_OPTS > /dev/null\n        echo \"ok.\"\n        ;;\n    *)\n        N=/etc/init.d/$NAME\n        echo \"Usage: $N {start|stop|restart|force-reload}\" >&2\n        exit 1\n        ;;\nesac\nexit 0\n```\n. @dossjb No, he is running that at user login, I think. Also, you can run daemons being non-root\n. I've updated the file on https://gist.github.com/shoghicp/10000415 with a possible fix.\nCheck if it starts automatically (when user logs in), or try to start manually.\n. Well, seems like something is wrong with the permissions. Last thing to try, set this as the startup command: nohup /home/user/start.sh &\n. You can always use screen to run commands in the background and attach to them later so you can stop them nicely, but if this last command works, there is no need to do that\n. First do sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install screen to install the console utility screen.\nThen, update the start command (or start it yourself) to screen -S pocketmine -d -m /home/user/start.sh\nThis will create a screen session called pocketmine in the background. You can attach to it anytime using screen -r pocketmine, and deattach from it using Ctrl + A + D\n. @cscottsy Good to know! I'll close this issue now.\nIf they report bugs about no mobs (animals / monsters) or items not dropping, tell them that it is going to be fixed (or added) in the next PocketMine-MP version. Also, look up the Plugin Repository, you can get fun minigames or account protection for the server.\n. Update PocketMine-MP for Android\n. 1.4 is not ready for testing, most of the things are commented out of the code\n. change your spawnpoint using /spawnpoint x y z\n. Seems like the file length check doesn't work correctly on MacOS, so the installer just continues instead of getting the source fallback\n. And players?\nAll commands in console won't use /.\n. New translations have to be sent to http://translate.pocketmine.net/\n. make it?\n. Ignore that error. It's safe to do so\n. This is already on Core-Rewrite, and new builds get generated from there\n. Invalid issue. This is not a forum\n. @sekjun9878 Don't do that. You have just broke merging the Core-Rewrite branch.\n. This issue is related to using a plugin, not to the file system.\n. could you upload the old (backup) and actual world files?\n. Try using one of the older binaries available for Raspberry Pi on sourceforge\n. This error is caused by a plugin by not using properly the Position object (using it as a string)\n. This has been already implemented in the core by #1789 \n. @wrewolf The new binaries are only for the Core-Rewrite branch. Old binaries that work with 1.3.12 are currently on the installer\n. No, you have to use Core-Rewrite & the Core-Rewrite code. Otherwise it won't work\n. This won't even do anything.\n. We will work on this for the Alpha_1.4\n. We are parsing the YAML format correctly. This patch breaks multi-line strings\n. Fixed using CFLAGS=-m32 march=i686 mtune=generic ./src/build/compile.sh\n. Get a better connection\n. This is not a forum. If I ever see anyone else using this as a forum, I'll issue a warning to them on the forums. \n. They will be supported on the stable release of pocketmine-mp 1.4\n. Well, they didn't attack it. It's just a bad username.\nSince Alpha_1.4 doesn't have a SQLite3 db (and uses a different model for kicking players) This is closed\n. Don't report plugins in here. THis is a plugin issue\n. are you sure it has the whitelist enabled?\n. hmm, they should have been kicked automatically. I think the whitelist is not set up correctly\n. Find the php.ini file inside bin/php5/bin, and remove the lines that say something about opcache\n. This is an issue with the application, not pocketmine itself. Try downloading 1.3.12 again\n. \"settings tab\"\nI think you are using an external hosting provider.\n. you mean, the player list on the client? that is limited by the client itself, use /list to view the actual list\n. No, you are wrong. The main menu screen is the client handled list, and players in other worlds won't be listed there. /list is the true server list.\n. teleporting between worlds for other users won't work correctly, players will be invisible for the ones that were in other levels.\nAll players are kicked of the server after 10-20 seconds without packets being received. What you are telling is impossible, and remember, this is not a forum. Several users get an email notification each time a new comment is posted.\n. Please test that the original file works correctly before even opening a pull request.\nAs you can see on https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/blob/Core-Rewrite/src/pocketmine/plugin/PluginLogger.php#L33 everything works correctly, including spaces and prefixes.\n. Please open a bug report on https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-Android\n. No. Already said that Windows has pthreads bugs that can't be fixed by me\n. You don't need that. Just treat it like a normal array, it was designed to support that\n. yep, did you test doing, for example. $configObject[$key] = $value?\n. besides, this Config object might get changed in the future before releasing the Alpha_1.4 (thus the final API version)\n. Have you tried running the script on ./src/build/compile.sh?\n. This doesn't happen anymore in the current build\n. Please use the same interface as in https://github.com/Bukkit/Bukkit/blob/master/src/main/java/org/bukkit/event/entity/EntityTeleportEvent.java\n. Yaw and pitch is not handled in teleportation. That's is handled later, on move\n. Don't do this anymore, or we'll block you from the repository\n. http://translate.pocketmine.net/\n. Try again on the 0.0.0 branch :)\n. use the 1.3.12 version instead of the development version. And remember, this is not the place to report bugs in the app\n. https://github.com/Bukkit/mc-dev/blob/master/net/minecraft/server/EntityMushroomCow.java\nclass EntityMushroomCow extends EntityCow {\nso it would be class MushroomCow extends Cow{\n. Also, update the changes on #1485 \n. This is a 1.3.12 issue, not a 1.4 issue\n. You have to use DevTools and place it under a folder\n. Download the latest phar from jenkins.pocketmine.net\n. Use the latest phar provided on jenkins.pocketmine.net\n. Try using the 32-bit version, the 64-bit version is buggy\n. Use the 32-bit version\n. Increase the memory limit, it might be that. Without further info I don't know what else can happen\n. Fixed, get the latest build\n. 1.3.12 plugins are not compatible with 1.4\n. Because they use the new API. Old plugins won't work, also, you have to use the plugin as a phar\n. have you tried selecting a block in the hotbar? like stone or cobblestone. Also, remember that new blocks are not yet implemented\n. That's weird. they get sent to different workers. Are you sure you are submitting them via the scheduleAsyncTask() (or similar) method?\n. Async tasks are submitted. All the work must be done inside onRun(). I've just tested it and the call happens on a different thread than the main thread\n. (You can get the current thread id with \\Thread::getCurrentThreadId())\n. That loop is executing continously, and can block an entire core so other threads might not be able to execute.\nTry getting the thread ID on call and when onRun() is called\n. I've modified the title to Busy AsyncTask will block the main thread.\nRight now, I think it's a pthreads issue. I'll research more into this. I've also found that the world generation thread causes this same issue.\n. After researching a bit more, I've two examples.\nThis won't lock the main thread: https://gist.github.com/shoghicp/0e5f29baa21a486b52a4\nThis will: https://gist.github.com/shoghicp/439261277ddb76d5fab2\n. Please use translate.pocketmine.net\n. Check if you have a firewall enabled\n. The Alpha_1.4 is for 0.9.0. You are using 0.8.1\n. Please stop spamming. You will be revoked access to the organization repositories. 1.3 uses 0.8.1, and use the latest MCPE and PocketMine build\n. Not 1.4\n. Explosions need a rewrite, but I guess this will do for now :P\n. We do not support plugins on the issue tracker. Please report this to the original author\n. Use a PC, mobile devices have issues with networking\n. Please do not report features not implemented in PocketMine-MP Alpha_1.4 as bugs.\n. Please do not report features not implemented in PocketMine-MP Alpha_1.4 as bugs.\n. Please do not report features not implemented in PocketMine-MP Alpha_1.4 as bugs.\n. This has been already tested and fixed in RakLib, I couldn't reproduce this issue even with 60% packet loss and fake duplication\n. This is not a PocketMine-MP issue, this has to do how MCPE renders things and MC: PC using other data values, somehow.\n. Please do not report old bugs\n. Use 0.9.0 on an Android device :)\n. Please do not report features not implemented in PocketMine-MP Alpha_1.4 as bugs. As of now, upgrade of PMF maps has not been implemented.\n. Check your firewall, it should show up in your local game list.\n. This won't work, it seems like you didn't test it. All blocks need special classes and addition into several lists.\n. It seems like you were trying to get the position, as the error only points to there\n. Remember to not to use it before the player has spawned\n. There are no finite worlds. The glitch is caused by Minecraft: PE by being in unloaded chunks, not by the server\n. @williamtdr well, that can cause weird behavior since the client doesn't react nicely to commands in that state.\n. @williamtdr no, that only affects non-infinite worlds. I may add a way to select to use them in the future\n. @williamtdr I've done extra testing, and seems like PocketMine-MP has sent those chunks but Minecraft: PE has not rendered them yet. Placing a block in those chunks makes them render faster.\nI placed a check for when players are going to enter not loaded chunks, but players entering a received loaded chunk that has not been rendered by their client cannot be detected.\n. @williamtdr Please read what I said. Those chunks are already loaded (sent by the server), but the client has not rendered them. \n. What kind of thread? If you start your own threads on a plugin, the plugin must close them and wait for them to join. Otherwise, threads are cleaned up correctly in PocketMine-MP (even if it takes a while to close). At the end there is a kill(php pid) instruction that kills everything in the current process.\n. @williamtdr What is the CPU usage while it hangs?\n. This feature has not been implemented yet (Same as crash dumps). They will get implemented back again once all the crash detection is added back again.\n. @williamtdr That's other issue, don't open it as I was already researching spawning out of the boundaries. Also, it seems like you are using an old build.\n. Please do not create a new issue when the old one was still not fixed, just comment in the old one. This only sends more notifications to all the people subscribed to this project. Fixed in the latest commit via web editor\n. Rails are not yet implemented, so he can't place it. As I told before, do not open issues for non-implemented features in 1.4.\n. You are using old binaries, check the forum post about 1.4 for the development binaries.\n. Try using the 32-bit version :)\n. @Huntereb The 64-bit version of PHP on WIndows is buggy.\nAt the end of the program, PHP kills itself\n. This happened to me, but didn't see any packets in the network that pointed to a server source. It seems like the client itself teleported randomly\n. The client itself is causing these issues...\n. @dutok The Minecraft: PE team is working to fix this bug and other multiplayer issues.\n. It's a limitation of the protocol, to be fixed in 0.9.1 (hopefully) by @jbernhardsson\n. It's a limitation to have server-side inventory without the client telling the server the slot it is selecting\n. Please do your research before opening pull requests. That string is the same as Minecraft\n. http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Commands\nFind it there and read the description.\n. Close your older server\n. This is not a forum. Please refer from posting questions here and use the official forums, Help section\n. Superseded by #1555\n. You have to reinstall the binaries using the installer or disable opcache\n. Try doing Ctrl + C after a few seconds of it being in that state\n. Update the binaries, check the forum\n. This is due to a plugin. We don't support plugins in our issue tracker\n. @JeffMelton yeah, found that. The problems of doing manual changes :)\nIt's working again. For the record, if there are problems with the PHP compilation / builds / install script, open an issue on https://github.com/PocketMine/php-build-scripts instead of here\n. It seems like you are trying to load a pre-1.4 plugin in a 1.4 server or the reverse. Pre-1.4 and 1.4 plugins are incompatible\n. @williamtdr @Huntereb The void teleport bug happens on both vanilla and PocketMine, as I confirmed letting a client moving over a flat world for hours. It crashed with the same teleport bug as in PocketMine\n. Did the server crash or only the generation thread?\nIt depends where so I can fix the correct garbage collector\n. @sekjun9878 There is FIRE and LAVA, then FIRE tick that is shared by both\n. Try installing g++ before trying to install PocketMine-MP\n. server.properties should be left like the Minecraft one. You should use pocketmine.yml (getProperty()) for these kind of options.\nThis should be integrated as a plugin, since having this on a project is not right:\nphp\n$cmdline = $this->server->getConfigString(\"external-generation-cmd\", \"hhvm -v Eval.Jit=true\");\nexec($cmdline . \" \" . \\pocketmine\\PATH . \"src/pocketmine/level/generator/ExternalGeneratorEntryPoint.php \" . $addr .\n\" > /tmp/pmexternal 2>&1 &\");\nAlso, the CPU bug might be caused due to sockets not being locked correctly while they are reading data, so they loop without bounds until they get the data to continue. That is the behavior that has to be fixed (I'll distribute a test phar later).\nIf you want to do this as a plugin, experiment to see if you can override the generator thread, maybe with some Reflection magic.\n. @zhuowei Nah, there were faster. But come to the IRC to further discuss this and try to fix these issues in the core :)\n. @tnpxxsheepdog Check the server.properties for the hardcore setting\n. This is due to RakLib slowing ticks as no packets are sent, so the timeout check is never done. This is a RakLib bug, and it'll be fixed in the RakLib repository\n. @3do2 no, it's just a bug caused by not ticking properly\n. What is the view-distance on the server.properties?\nAlso, try using a newer phar like http://jenkins.pocketmine.net/job/PocketMine-MP/239/\n. I can't reproduce this on the latest build\n. Seems like that was a server that is on multiple lists\n. The installer will manually compile PHP for the current machine if the binaries don't work. Be sure to install g++ (and the packages detailed on the homepage)\n. The new installer includes custom CentOS PHP binaries now :)\n. Have you tried installing g++?\n. With the package manager CentOS has\n. I've also added extra CentOS binaries so you won't have to compile binaries each time\n. Use the 32-bit installer\n. Remember this is not a forum. As we can't fix this, I'm closing the issue\n. This is a known issue on MCPE that we can't fix.\n. there is a phar for 1.3.12 :)\n. This has been already reported lots of times, and it's a client-side MCPE bug. We can't do nothing directly to fix this.\n. Update your binaries\n. Is this happening on 0.9.0 and 1.4? I found this issue before, but I couldn't find a cause. Later I fixed the orientation of chunks, so I though this would have been fixed.\n. You can die of anything :P\n. Players have their own spawnpoint, the world spawn only changes it for new players\n. This fixes it for new players, by not setting the Spawn coords in the NBT\n. remove the old player data. it was from an old spawn that caused the death\n. We are aware of this issue, and it happens when more players are already on the server. The first player will join correctly.\n. @sebagius7110 You are wrong.\n@hhggzz Can you try installing http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29 ?\n. As @PEMapModder said, we had to follow some rules so commands could work properly. We decided to follow the Minecraft: PC rules (that MCPE Realms use, too), that are 3-16 characters being A-Z a-z 0-9 and _\nAlso, Minecraft: PC uses TCP, but MCPE uses UDP. UDP doesn't send any notification of force-disconnect (like TCP does).\n. This is a Mojang issue. Please don't post bugs on the client here\n. An example output: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7e39cbc9f7bf34b4ed89\nAfter being parsed: http://aikar.co/timings.php?url=a95be1b8ae7a40f92c9f59fbec6c97ff\n. @3do2 As you can see, this is a pull request. It has not been merged into master yet.\nCheck the initial description for a build with the timings command\n. Next time you open a non-related issue here, you are getting blocked from this repository. People get emails about all the actions done here.\n. This has been added to the latest build\n48bc919a338d4e3605b110b3cd6dfca2ad495a22\n. This is not a 0.9 server\n. Are you using the latest development build?\n. The latest one is build 271 that fixes these issues\n. The idea behind that number is caching log writes, also, this is not the issue of the big CPU usage on player join\n. @PonyPC That's the idea, not to write until a sector is available (4kb).\nUse a wrapper around the console output to get the newest data without timestamps\n. For support request please refer to the forum.\nYou can do this with screen, or calling it using the PHP binary directly\n. I can't reproduce this issue on the latest build, so I think this issue has been fixed after all the work on chunk loading :)\n. It's an implementation of the PC command.\n. Try doing save-all before stopping\n. This bug is happening again, randomly. The causes are different than on the original report\n. As I said, it happens randomly.\n. @tnpxxsheepdog No, never happened to me. I know it happens, since lots of people reported it on different environments\n. @tnpxxsheepdog Tested from start? They might have vanished on the old build. Also, try with the latest build, there were extra changes\n. @tnpxxsheepdog Chests are the same as signs :)\n. @HmHmmHm This is not a forum. You are risking getting your account blocked on this repository for spamming.\n. As said, the \"RFC\" tag is still too weird. Having it as \"Contribution\" focus in what a PR is. The C: part is still strange, but I'll accept it.\nHaving the labels \"Invalid\" and \"Won't fix\" are useful when closing and archiving issues, as explained on https://gist.github.com/shoghicp/8374669946a38bfecfc3\n. :)\n. We increased doTick() in the latest build. You can decrease the max kimit on the pocketmine.yml.\nPlease do not report lacking features to the bug tracker, only report bugs on implemented features.\n. /status must be disabled by default\n. This will be added to the installer wizard so people can find the option easily\n. This is a Mojang client-side issue\n. Some blocks cannot be placed in creative mode, it's a known issue\n. Can you test again with the latest development build?\n. This is a duplicated issue\n. Duplicated issue\n. @tnpxxsheepdog Exactly :)\n. This has been fixed by b3c3f896a3ebafbd53748a71c91a750ed2645f3b\nJust replace any light-emitting block and other nearby blocks will be updated automatically.\n. No, you can cancel it or leave it as is. Modify the dropped item when it's dropped, not on pickup\n. Mobs will be available in the final stable release, but they are not in the current stage.\n. This is a lighting bug, duplicate of #1683 \n. This issue is duplicated\n. Plugins should not be able to use the console command sender directly. If they want to send commands (BAD way to do things), they'll have to create their own CommandSender (extending it with information about the plugin).\n. Are you using the latest development build? I think this bug was fixed in a recent commit\n. This will be fixed in the next minutes with a new commit\n. This seems to be a RakLib issue, that causes packets to be queued one after another. chat should be sent as a direct packet, but other packets are sent in a queue. This could be fixed using different channels, RakNet supports this and MCPE uses it. Implementing it into RakLib could be useful :)\n. Could you test 0246648 (latest development build) and give feedback?\n. Thanks for the feedback! I'll wait for more people, since this issue can happen on both directions.\n. For now the beta4 will have the partial patch, I'll focus on the TPS issue on the beta5\n. Could you test this again on the latest development build?\nPlease do not spawn items/arrows when testing, so we have clean results\n. @Huntereb yeah, or breaking blocks. That is another issue, so for testing it would be better not mixing multiple issues in one report.\n. @tnpxxsheepdog could you test this too?\n. @tnpxxsheepdog As I said, chunk ticking was enabled again. you can disable it using pocketmine.yml (does anyone read the release notes on github?)\n. Events are called from the place attacked/healed, not from the heal() method. attack() does the same.\n. yes, but they'll have to set the event to what they want, you've to pass an event there\n. Have you tried updating the binaries? The new PHP builds don't use OpenSSL (libssl) anymore\n. Please do not duplicate issues\n. Update to the latest version\n. Run the \"version\" command, there you'll see the correct version you are running.\n. Well, the thing is that we should change the other events to use the private properties and call the parent constructors\n. \u00ac\u00ac\n. This will be rewritten on the upcoming creation of better world generators.\n. This broke a few systems\n. This is only a client-side issue, it doesn't happen in the server itself\n. It is not intended to be cancelled, \n. Please read the original API before doing these changes. This breaks compatibility completely.\nhttps://github.com/Bukkit/CraftBukkit/blob/master/src/main/java/org/bukkit/craftbukkit/CraftServer.java#L507\n. You have to use Server->matchPlayer() for that, it returns a Player[]\n. This has been already fixed\n. @sekjun9878 That is not the cause of this issue, as that bug was only the cause that we implemented all the thread communication with IPC sockets instead of the direct Thread interface\n. Closing this as this is an issue with the setup, since loading more chunks = more memory used.\n. This is a Minecraft: PE bug, and we can do nothing to fix it.\n. As said on #1784, we can do nothing to fix this, as it is a client-side issue\n. Since Minecraft: PC does not save grass colors as Minecraft: PE does, they must be generated by the server. This has not been added yet to PocketMine, and chosen colors will be buggy.\n. @roroB20 It'll be done later after all biomes are implemented. Since MCPE only accepts colors, it needs calculations, and it'll look bad in the end too.\n. retest this please\n. Could you instead replace the __toString() method from Entity?\n. Jenkins, retest this please\n. As said, this is a Mojang issue, the only solution is kicking the player (that is already done when they crash). This way is also compatible with other clients that do not crash, like web clients or BigBrother clients\n. I want to implement the selectors again as Minecraft uses them, including the advanced entity selectors / NBT fields\n. Well, I can confirm this is much faster and decreases CPU usage a lot for MC: PE clients than Anvil ;)\nStill I might move compression to a different thread, since it causes TPS drop doing it on the main thread.\n. @Guillaume351 never use non-promoted builds as they can contain invalid code or break things. You are using a build that is part of this branch.\n. @Guillaume351 never use non-promoted builds as they can contain invalid code or break things.

Please use the official app we provide on pocketmine.net\n. Does this happen with specific devices, or with all of them? Also, if you can send the world, it would be really useful, pointing the bad zone where players crash.\n. Since the map was generated by Minecraft: PC, there are unknown blocks in the terrain that cause Minecraft: PE to crash. You'll have to remove these using MCEdit or other editor\n. This is a duplicate of #1920 \n. Yes, but not always. Sometimes it just uses CPU without lowering the TPS\n. This is a duplicated issue of #1913 \n. These IDs are invalid. Minecraft: PE uses a different way to identify buckets, the damage value.\nPlease research how things are done in each platform before contributing code.\n. Noo the logo header D:\n. @Ryougaserver The issue with light population is known. It's tracked on #1683 \n. Please do not duplicate issues, use the search before reporting new. #1703 \n. This has been already reported lots of times, we are aware of this issue\n. I'm not able to reproduce this issue.\n. Stop spamming with duplicated issues of your same issue.\n. This is a duplicate of #1683\n. This is a duplicated issue\n. Please submit the report to the Crash Archive.\n. Please do not report duplicated issues\n. Could you submit the full crash to crash.pocketmine.net and comment the report URL here?\n. Please try placing other blocks in both gamemodes\n. This seems to be related with the player not moving the reference chunk to the one he moved.\n. Could you test this on the new build? Since we did changes on how bounding boxes work, it might have been fixed.\n. Could you test again? There were lots of changes related to bounding boxes.\n. I'm not able to reproduce this issue anymore. If you can, please specify the blocks that you can place and the ones that you can't, and the steps you did to reproduce it (including teleporting, changing levels, everything)\n. What build are you using?\n. Did you try disconnecting and joining again?\n. block light is not sent back to the client after sending the chunk the first time, it is a limitation of the Minecraft: PE protocol (and Minecraft PC). It only changes the internal value. Also, there is no light population yet, so all the values are 15. Once light population is added, they'll have the correct values\n. This is a duplicated issue #1816 \n. Do not use this repository for spam. Remember that you have been already banned from our channels for the same reason.\n. @ijoshuahd This is not a forum. Please comment as less as possible\n. Do not spam the issue tracker, use the search function to find duplicated issues\n. I'm not able to reproduce this issue\n. Hmm, I can't reproduce this issue on a normal world. Are you using an Anvil or McRegion world?\n. @DaveJukes So, was it fixed? This issue could be caused by a combination of other two, so it's hard to debug.\n. I'm not able to reproduce the vanishing signs/chests. I'm closing this issue since the original issue is not discussed anymore\n. 21:57:04 [EMERGENCY] Please submit the \"/home/dev/CrashDump_Tue_Aug_26-21.57.04-BST_2014.log\" file to the Bug Reporting page. Give as much info as you can.\n^ Please do that and provide the link :)\n. Yeah, he opened that issue, and I changed the error to an exception so it provides extra information :)\n. Those two errors can be ignored. Also, this issue is a duplicate of #1862\n. I'll close this since there is a new issue that includes more data. Please refer to #2077 in the future\n. Could you test the latest development build?\n. I can't find that reason anywhere in the source code. I think your issue could be caused by a plugin\n. Please provide a link to the crash report instead of pasting other information here, following the Contribution Guidelines\n. I'm not able to reproduce this issue.\n. The installer has its own repository where you can report bugs. It's PocketMine/php-build-scripts\n. Please do not open duplicated issues #1989 \n. This is not a support forum.\nhttp://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Server.properties\n. Please read the Contribution Guidelines and follow them when creating an issue.\n. Did you test being on the furnace for a while? Sometimes it has a inventory update issue and it does not update the window, but still does things on the background.\nPlease read the Contribution Guidelines and follow them when creating an issue.\n. Please do not submit features not implemented. They will implemented in future beta builds, and doesn't help the developers. It only contributes to delay fixing important issues on the tracker.\nAlso, do not report duplicated issues. You can use the search function to find your issue on the tracker easily.\n.

If you find a way to fix this on runtime without using system tools, please tell me. There is code to guess the timezone, but it can't be done by PHP itself - it calls the host tools, and the output depends on the local formatting.\n. no, I mean, without having those lines there. \n. hmm, that seems like a solution for windows - linux has it easier, since date has a timezone offset parameter\n. Yeah, I changed how the server moves players so all movements are checked, so players won't be able to do noclip ;)\nThis needs proper bounding boxes on all the blocks, otherwise they'll glitch on them :)\n. Fixed in 7a10f91\n. @3do2 Test the latest dev. build, I did not commit the correct changes :)\nIt'll still \"glitch\" on blocks with incorrect bounding boxes, like stairs, doors, and a few more that need it changed. Though this is a protection against client-side hacks ;)\n. This was added to PocketMine-Soft since it's an advanced use case https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-Soft/blob/master/PocketMine-MP-Patches/0010-Added-RakLib-port-checking-option.patch\n. This is a non-implemented feature. It'll be resolved once each item has its own class (as blocks do)\n. Please do not open duplicated issues, as the Contribution Guidelines say. There is a function called search that can be used to find already created issues.\n1750\n. Already fixed on build 510, please use the latest development build when testing as the PocketMine-MP Contribution Guidelines say.\n. The \"moved too quickly\" message is displayed when players are off by 100 blocks in a single tick... so that is a bad sign ;D\nAlso, note where the players glitch - bounding boxes might be wrong there.\n. Could someone confirm that this issue has been fixed?\n. @tnpxxsheepdog Yeah, ladders and waters don't reduce fall damage, but that's another issue\n. It does work, but you might have found a client-side desync issue. Remember that you MUST follow the PocketMine-MP Contribution Guidelines or your issue will be invalid and closed.\n. EntityDamageByEntityEvent is now a subset of EntityDamageEvent, you will get both types of events since they use the same handler, as bukkit does. You can sue instanceof to differentiate between them\n. When reporting crashes, please use the Crash Archive\n. Please read the Contribution Guidelines and use the search feature to find duplicated issues. This is a duplicate of #2031 \n. This does not help, please follow the Contribution Guidelines and provide further info. You might also want to test on the latest build from jenkins, using the bow as the first item\n. Sometimes it updates... sometimes it does not. That's as far as I know D:\n. Please do not open duplicate issues. Use the search function, because duplicating issues only slows down how fast we can fix them.\n. Read the PocketMine-MP Contribution Guidelines or your issues will be closed.\n. Read the PocketMine-MP Contribution Guidelines or your issues will be closed. Opening further issues will cause a ban of your account on the PocketMine repositories.\n. I can't reproduce this issue, did you test with the latest development release?\n. No, the latest build was 523, done before the issue was opened :)\n. Could someone confirm that issue is fixed?\n. I couldn't reproduce this issue. Besides, ServerScheduler->cancelTask() is not called by any PocketMine code, so I guess it's caused by a plugin.\n08:36:26 [INFO] Done (1.615s)!

I can move over slabs or carpets correctly in survival mode. Did you test on the latest development release? Older builds had this issue, but it was fixed.\n. Is the world generated before they log in?\n. This is caused by the client itself, but I guess I could force the order of the first 56 chunks so the player spawns. It was also requested to Mojang to allow setting a lower number as the spawn limit, but we had no luck :(\n. A part of the world must be loaded each time a player is in the world. More players there won't increase the usage, but if they move away, they'll have to load new areas\n. @tnpxxsheepdog Once it starts to unload things, Ctrl+C won't be handled anymore (it depends on ticks). It doesn't mean that it has stopped completely, only that it can't stop two times in a row ;)\n. Could you test again using the new build?\n. I'll mark this as fixed for now. If it shows up again, please open a new issue and place this as a related issue\n. @iksaku They are, the server gets them via the data value and not via the ID, MCPE does it on a different way. \n@seria2 Use the docs to check for player interaction events. This is not a forum nor a support service, only open issues about bugs on the server\n. Fixed on 9980a07\n. Please follow the Contribution Guidelines\n. This is an issue present on the client, not PocketMine.\n. You can't switch the gamemode while in-game without having issues. Please test without changing your gamemode.\n. I can't reproduce this issue, are you using the latest development build?\n. PocketMine doesn't show anything. Your client does.\n. Is there any error message that shows up when the player is disconnected? And what is the quit message shown on the console?\n. No, armor is just a skin layer and there is no code to check that. It's just an item moved from one slot to another.\n. @LouisBHirst That seems like an app crash, thanks for the crash report but it's something Mojang has to handle. We might be sending invalid data, but the client is getting disconnected due to the crash\n. Latest beta doesn't have it. Do you mean the latest build?\nIt only happens when the transaction is refused. That's a completely different bug that has been already reported and affects other things\n. This is a plugin error as the \"already logged in\" message does not exist in PocketMine-MP.\nI think SimpleAuth is the issue, you are getting kicked because your original player has not been removed (it'll timeout later)\n. This is a Mojang issue. And I think this is already duplicated\n. Instead of images, could you paste the server.log? The last lines, where all the crash information is dumped, are important.\n. This issue is duplicated. Please read the Contribution Guidelines and be sure to use the search feature to find other issues related to the one you want to report.\n. Do you have settings.advanced-cache enabled?\n. Set it to false for now :)\nGoing to bed now\n. Will items that exist in the hotbar work after joining?\n. You can't set a value of null. In fact, this is a way to add decoration without adding extra data.\nThis is the expected behavior on Minecraft PC (check http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Superflat#Presets)\n. Follow the Contribution Guidelines, and do not duplicate issues. A feature called \"Search\" exists so we don't get split feedback on the same issue.\n. This has been fixed on bb34e067547a619b43a6e139e31d98a3602d3d17\n. Follow the Contribution Guidelines, and use the search feature before reporting issues to decrease the amount of duplicated reports that slow the development.\n. If you report a crash, use the Crash Archive, do not upload it to a different place.\nI saw some crashes related to carpets, but I couldn't reproduce the issue. Do you have a large part covered with carpets?\n. Try disabling xdebug on the php.ini file (just add a ; in front of it)\n. Please test this with the new binaries\n. @brunocraft Try stacking them up ;)\n. Doors have their bounding box code implemented, but some cases might not be right.\n. If you are using SimpleAuth, it's caused due to permission recalculation. This will be fixed once beta7 is released. Could you test without using plugins?\nOf course, using the new system, TPS won't drop until the system is past its 100% usage.\n. @tnpxxsheepdog That is not lag, it's just a zone with invalid chunks.\nI think this issue has been fixed, since it was SimpleAuth fault and the new update improves that\n. From the number of reports we got, this is a real issue, but I'm not able to reproduce it directly.\n. @brunocraft That would be a chunk saving issue\n. It seems that your terminal doesn't support ANSI escape codes. You can use the CLI parameter --disable-ansi. That will disable ANSI escape codes, including colors and title change.\nRemember that this is an issue tracker. If you want to ask questions or get further support, you can use the forums\n. The day is emulated on the client side, and PocketMine sends the server side time each 6-8 seconds\n. Could you confirm this is not happening?\n. Do not open duplicated issues\n. This might be caused when garbage collection is called, could you test it?\n. @tnpxxsheepdog No, that is not the cause\n. Moved too quickly means moving more than 100 blocks in a single tick (0.05 seconds). I'm closing this since I could not reproduce it anymore with current builds\n. Please do not open issues for non-implemented features. Check the releases page for a list of some important non-implemented features\n. @williamtdr The server does not recognize the format (nor has a way to detect this specific one) so new files are created on top of it.\n. This is due to your device getting out of memory. Please do not report third-party issues on this tracker\n. You can safely ignore that. Also, this won't work with the current MCPE version, blame @Intyre for not building new iOS binaries :)\n. Invalid or duplicated issues will be closed and locked.

This could be a permission issue, are you using plugins that modify permissions?\n. @jose-vm Checked the code, all messages sent by a player are broadcasted. If a player receives the message and you aren't using plugins, others should see the same message\n. Duplicated issues will be closed and locked.

If you want to discuss this RFC, please use the #pocketmine channel for long discussions, to keep the comment notifications low\n. Not voting, but read the PSR-2\n\nCode MUST use 4 spaces for indenting, not tabs.\n. Duplicate of #2093 \n. Remember that these are basic RFC and Voting guidelines. Further RFCs will be issued after this is merged to extend them.\n. You are not supposed to go through other players in MCPE :)\n. This seems to be caused by a plugin. Follow the Contribution Guidelines or your issues will be closed and locked\n. All of those bugs you are reporting are only one, being that inventory is client-side only and not fully server-side, that being a Mojang thing\n. This could have been fixed on the latest build. if you find specific items that you can craft, specify them, the crafting recipe might be wrong.\n. @MobileCrafter Yeah, but those cases are caused by the server getting the player on sync. again. It would be interesting to detect them, but I could not reproduce them anymore. As this is not a crafting bug anymore, only a generic transaction desync, I'm closing the issue\n. Are you able to reproduce this anymore? It seems that it was a PocketMine-Soft specific bug\n. Please do not open issues related to the installer script on this repository. The correct place to do so is https://github.com/PocketMine/php-build-scripts/\n. This is not a security issue. It just allows people to automatically find servers.\n\nIf all korean servers are affected, check your plugins. Since you have custom language added, people could have added a backdoor. Do not report third-party issues here, nor modified servers\n. The time matches what the client expects, so the sun won't jump around or lag behind. Time in Minecraft: PE is 2.5 times faster than PC\n. Please do not open issues related to non-implemented features. Read the Contribution Guidelines that are shown to you when reporting an issue. Continuing to do this may cause ignoring your future issues.\n. Follow the Contribution Guidelines that are shown to you when creating a new issue.\n. This issue breaks several Contribution Guidelines\n. Please do not open issues related to non-promoted builds.\n. PocketMine-MP doesn't use this anymore, and this function was kept there for backwards compatibility. I guess nobody is using this, so it could be removed.\n. @lesander They can implement it themselves\n. @lesander They don't need to modify anything. Just implement the same function in their plugins\n. @lesander If you run it as root. You can always recreate it on a different place. If someone is able to call it from somewhere, it's the least of your problems since they'll be able to directly call other code\n. By the same reasoning, you could call http://php.net/manual/en/function.posix-kill.php or exec.\n. I'm not able to test this right now. Did you test joining with two different players with different gamemode at the same time?\nAlso, does it happen on Adventure mode too?\n. This is related to a plugin. Please do not report issues that are caused by plugins on this tracker.\nPocketMine-MP always specifies a reason when closing/kicking players, this is a plugin that forgot to set them and just called Player->close();\n. The idea of having a separated class that implements Listener is so you don't have this issue. SimpleAuth moved all the Event handling to a different class, for example.\nIf you don't want to have them handle it, register them as protected or private methods, or move them to their specific listener (best solution)\n. We don't encourage laziness.\n. It is not items, it's all entities. Player ticking takes less resources to tick, about 15% less time than other resources. Still, everything takes less time than it did in 1.3.x\n. This is a client issue, not related to PocketMine-MP\n. fae330d499e705aac902e3750b089d7744acf1e0 has been removed, and added as a patch to PocketMine-Soft.\n. This is the intended behavior.\n. Changed all of the classes to abstract except the \"Generic\" class that is used as a fallback.\n. The algorithm used on this pull request is invalid and won't match the behavior on normal Minecraft games.\n. No, it is set via Block::setDamage(), but that is only for internal working. You can do Level->setBlock($this, $this) if you want, to have less code, and it'll be kept that way.\n. I don't understand. What do you mean with \"cirrus\"? Some kind of block that a mod adds, like clouds?\n. Long pressing actions have not been implemented, and this has been already reported. Please do not report invalid issues.\n. Please provide timings reports for your server when that is happening.\n. This is not an issue with items. If you see the TPS value below 20, you'll have all kind of issues. Try using PocketMine-Soft (soft channel)\n. @PEMapModder No, it's just another call. If plugins don't handle them right, it'll slow down the server due to the plugins, but this will be highlighted on the Timings report\n. # Invalid Votes will be removed\n. YES. This feature allows moving people to new versions that contain new features, but won't break their plugins. It reduces the amount of invalid reports we get from older builds, since some people forget to update them. As some people might not want this, it should be disabled by default\n. @Falkirks There is no problem with the current system, some people want it and others do not. For the later, we also added the \"Disable by default\" vote option that you see in the Voting section.\n. @Falkirks That's not the reason this was opened. It's just my personal opinion, since there are people that are still complaining that the first beta we released doesn't work with current plugins.\nWhy I haven't put this here to a vote before?\n\nIt involves stuff that could be critical, code being automatically downloaded into your computer.\n\nThis is an awesome feature, but I voted no to default exactly fir the above reason.\n. @dutok Yeah, this is just a preliminary vote. The actual implementation will be done later, might not even be added to 1.4\n. @lesander You can already disable version checking from pocketmine.yml\n. @ProjectInfinity I don't know if you are voting for it to be default on or off, could you specify it?\n. As some people said, this could be asked on the configuration wizard, the user can choose there too :)\n. @KnownUnown We could also sign the beta/stable releases and check them using a cert shipped on the old phar itself\n. @PEMapModder The option will be placed on pocketmine.yml, not on server.properties\n. @PEMapModder It can't be hidden from there, as properties are documented there.\nIt'll be part of the auto-updater node. Update checking will be enabled by default (as it is right now), download + install will be a different option there.\n. @tnpxxsheepdog As said, it'll use the existing Update Checker to get the download links, that uses the channel\n. @tnpxxsheepdog Please edit your old comment to include that information :)\n. @MCMrARM The voting period has been already been closed\n. Votes were counted long time ago, a new RFC with the implementation details will be opened in the future.\n. This is not an issue, arrows have the same parameters as MCPE and Minecraft: PC.\nMaybe you are confusing the arrow force with gravity? This is currently constant.\n. Please read the Contribution Guidelines before opening an issue.\n. This is a duplicate of #2118 \n. This is a known issue, but cannot be fixed easily since the client doesn't send the hotbar data. Also, please do not duplicate issues :)\n. This is an exact duplicate of #2165. Please read the Contribution Guidelines and follow them when creating new issues.\n. Please do not open duplicated issues.\n. This has been already fixed\n. I'm not able to reproduce this issue. Be sure that there are no entities around that place and the spawn protection is off.\n. @PEMapModder This is already done, when writing it back to disk. It's just a runtime thing. Tile entities were saved but Entities were not, just because they were replaced.\n. No, this is a workaround that will be removed once Minecraft: PE has this issue fixed. Lines that contain unknown characters won't be wrapped.\nThis is an issue tracker, not a forum. You opened several support questions here, don't do that again.\n. Chests have proper bounding boxes set on the server, so this shouldn't be happening. Maybe the bounding box is different on Minecraft: PE\n. Players itself are closing the connection, this is not a PocketMine issue.\n. This is due to using a world that contains blocks unknown to the client.\nPlease read the Contribution Guidelines and search the repository for similar issues, as this one was duplicated.\n. You can also try lowering the chunk sending speed, or MCPE will crash due to chunks being sent too fast\n. Please do not open bugs from non-promoted builds\n. It's being worked on :)\nPlease do not open duplicated issues, #2118 is already there\n. Please do not open duplicated issues\n. They will only despawn if players are near. Also, chunk-ticking > per-tick must be higher than 0, defaults at 80 (between different settings needed)\n. This is detailed on the homepage, please don't open non-issues here.\nAlso, the installer repository is https://github.com/PocketMine/php-build-scripts\n. I'm not able to reproduce this issue anymore.\n. @PEMapModder No, this will cause a major slowdown on all event handling. This only has a meaning on registration, not on execution.\n. This has been already fixed.\n. \"Title says it all\" is not a valid description.\n. This is due to the client not sending notifications for chunks, so the server doesn't know if they have been received. Since 0.9 clients don't send any kind of notification when they spawn, detecting correctly that is a bit hard.\n. Not exactly... It could be easier, but the server can guess things.\n. @HostingItAll build 707 should have that issue if you are experiencing it on the newest builds.\nhttps://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/compare/Alpha_1.4dev-707...master\n. This could have been fixed on the latest build. It was an issue when the server has a connection that drops packets or is really busy.\n. That's an hilarious bug. Thanks for pointing it out\n. Players can have more than that item on the inventory. This works correctly, and it tells you if it fails or not via the return parameter. Not checking this is your fault.\nAlso, I don't know if you want to use Inventory->remove() or Inventory->removeItem()... but that is also your problem, and this is not a support forum.\n. This is not a support forum. Please read the documentation http://pocketmine.rtfd.org/\n. This is due to the game getting out of memory. This was tested with flat worlds with no entities at all.\nSince the algorithm was changed in new builds to be faster, old devices may crash. You can try lowering the chunk sending speed and range.\n@LukeDarling And no, it's not related to any issue.\n. This seems to be caused by a third-party plugin, so this issue is invalid.\n. Do not report duplicated issues\n. This is not the place to do so. Please do it on translate.pocketmine.net\n. STOP creating issues about MCPE crashing due too many items, as it is not PocketMine fault. Items will despawn after 5 minutes.\n. The $this->namedtag[\"TileID\"] = $this->blockId; line is wrong. You've to create the full NBT tag there. Or remove it\n. This is a permission issue. We don't support third-party plugins here.\n. This is not correct. That property is old and not used on Minecraft servers anymore, so the current code is correct.\nBefore doing anything, please research what are you doing\nhttp://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Server.properties\n. This only happens when the server is being stopped / reloaded, and only if RCON couldn't be started. Please check your logs and fix the issue that shows up in them.\n. The error should show up on start or after a reload\n. Please don't open duplicated issues, we are already aware of this issue. However, due to the Minecraft: PE protocol the hotbar cannot be synchronized correctly with the client.\n. This issue is invalid due to three different things:\n- Use the Crash Archive to post crash reports\n- Not enough description of the issue\n- You are using an old build, new builds already have this fixed\n. I think that having all the aliases on a single parameter is better than having them as extra parameters, right?\nWhat are the good parts of doing it this way?\n. This has been already fixed on a newer build\n. Fixed, it was a build being tested. Please do not use non-promoted builds from Jenkins, otherwise you'll get all kind of bugged stuff or incompatible with the current MCPE\n. You might want to use a flat world generator :)\n. Please do not open duplicated issues\n. This adds extra code that won't be merged, so this pull request is invalid.\n. It already does. It supports Anvil / McRegion worlds. If it creates a new level.dat, that means it's the user fault. Don't request support here, and be sure that the region folder only has .mcr files (McRegion, old format) or .mca (Anvil, now used on PC, but slow. Convert it to McRegion)\n. Remember that the way items are indexed was changed, and this way is faster now. I'm also unable to reproduce the crash issue, try with the latest build and report the crash.\n. https://github.com/Bukkit/Bukkit/blob/master/src/main/java/org/bukkit/command/defaults/TellCommand.java#L15\n. Crash Reports must be uploaded into the Crash Archive\n. Read @shoghicp on Twitter :)\n. The Event is called properly\nhttps://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/blob/master/src/pocketmine/Player.php#L2231\nThis seems to be the plugin (or other plugin) fault.\n. Then it's just that tile entities (including signs) are broken, it'll be fixed in the next beta build\n. Please test if 545f68382ca9cff0e73c4619fa58c7ff62356faa fixed this\n. This issue has not been reproduced, being tested on a new server on both survival and creative modes.\n. It's all tile entities, it'll be fixed in the next beta build :)\n. There are several transformations during Jenkins builds.\nFirst, commonly used methods and calls are inlined, like binary R/W or some static Level functions. Replacing them on the main source could make things a bit unreadable, so it is done using the C preprocessor.\nAfter that, another step takes place. The source code is inspected for commonly used base constants, and they get the \\ prefix. This removes namespace fetches on constants like false, true, null. Then, the same is done to PHP functions.\nYou can view the transformations and apply them yourself on https://github.com/PocketMine/PreProcessor\n. Use the builds provided by jenkins, or update your submodules\n. I thought I already merged this, seems like I did not.\n. This is not a bug. TPS load of over 100% = not enough resources to do it on a single tick, so you'll see the TPS dropping below 20. Try setting the world generator to FLAT (level-type on server.properties), and generating a new world.\n. The client needs an update of the tile\n. You can try disabling chunk ticking :)\n. @sekjun9878 I have a corrupted file that I'll analyze later\n. This is a client-issue that cannot be fixed. After a gamemode change, clients must leave the server and join again. Everything is handled fine on PocketMine, but the client doesn't support this.\nAlso, do not duplicate existing issues\n. This is not an issue of PocketMine-MP itself, please do not open these kind of support questions here\n. @ramijames Try using screen\n. @Exxarion Steadfast is still pocketmine, just with some parts of the new protocol backported.\nThis is not a forum. For discussion about PocketMine (and Steadfast!) you can join over the IRC channel\n. Disable advanced caching.\n. This has been already corrected, please do not report invalid issues.\n. Do not use development releases of SimpleAuth\n. Those bad coords are sent by MCPE itself\n. This has been already fixed\n. This issue is invalid:\n- Crash reports must be uploaded to the Crash Archive and linked here\n- You are not using the latest recommended build (although it is not released, I said that it is the next one over Twitter)\n- This has been already fixed\n. Please read the list of unimplemented features\n. Update your version :)\n. This is an issue with transactions, known but partly a client-side issue (protocol limitations)\n. Test using 6d09754\n. Please update to build 840, it has been already fixed\n. We cannot create our own binaries on Windows, so they run way slower there. Windows also has issues with low-speed disk reading.\nAnd as you said, PocketMine will run faster on Linux, even if it's on a virtual machine inside Windows\n. This is not a bug, but a feature. Seems that your console client doesn't support ANSI Escape Codes (colors, and other interesting stuff). Start it with --disable-ansi\n. This issue is invalid. Please follow the Contribution Guidelines and provide the crash log properly\n. the last line, [INFO] Preparing level \"Survival\" might point to worlds getting loaded again while being still online, something that shouldn't happen and that is caused by a plugin.\n. The cache is cleaned up after a few ticks. You can also use getBlockId and getBlockData, but if you are going to do bulk reading getBlock is a REALLY BAD idea. Get the chunk, then read from there.\n. This issue was invalid. Please follow the Contribution Guidelines\n. Test using 6d09754\n. This issue is invalid, as it has to do with a misconfiguration of the server.\nPlease disable xdebug and try to populate the light again. This will cause massive lag for a few seconds while everything is updated to correct values.\n. It seems like you are using a development build, please only report beta build issues.\n. The traffic amount depends on the server title. It's part of the RakNet protocol, the server listing.\nBe aware that this issue has been opened on the wrong place, as it is part of RakLib (that implements the RakNet protocol in PHP, but being less picky).\nYou can also trigger this on a vanilla server using a different packet. Sending 01000000000000000000ffff00fefefefefdfdfdfd12345678 (25 bytes) will cause a reply of 35 + serverName bytes (from either the vanilla or PocketMine server). This is part of RakNet, disabling this would cause local servers to not to be found. You can report this issue on their repository. This is just one of the possible ways of triggering a bigger reply from RakNet, and not the worst. Using proper packets, it can be as high as sending 100 bytes and getting a few MB back.\n. @ns827 Yeah, that's another issue, I'll just use what is being used on the main thread to convert errors to exceptions. That way invalid packets will be dropped from the queue.\n. The $start parameter does that, right?\n. From the page where you downloaded it:\nWarning! This version is OBSOLETE. Please use the beta or development builds instead.\n. You can use old binaries from the sourceforge archive.\nThis issue is invalid. You are opening an issue on a bug tracker, not a support forum. For support and questions, please use the forums.\n. This is not a support forum. Please read the docs\n. @iVertx Anvil support is not the default format, convert your world from Anvil to McRegion to reduce issues later\n. Creative mode items need to be selected twice sometimes. I do not know the nature of this issue currently.\nThat bad Chunk might be a wrongly converted part of the world that got regenerated on server load\n. It seems like your server can't generate normal worlds without lagging, please use FLAT worlds\n. This is an issue with your operating system and not with PocketMine\n. You've to load the worlds before switching between them. Check on pocketmine.yml the worlds: part\n. I just tested this and it cannot be reproduced. I used iron ingots to craft a chestplate, then put it on my armor slot. I quit and logged in back again, and it was correctly placed there.\n. This issue cannot be reproduced. Just tested crafting planks with spruce wood, then a crafting a workbench using spruce planks. Everything worked ;D\n. This was already fixed by #2379 \n. I've reverted your original pull request because you were wrong.\nhttps://github.com/Bukkit/Bukkit/blob/master/src/main/java/org/bukkit/command/defaults/DeopCommand.java#L22\n. These are all the related crash related to this one:\nhttp://crash.pocketmine.net/search/report/289003\nAs shown there, it's only happening on a special configuration. Did you try a different kernel / distribution?\n. It seems like it's an OS + binaries issue.\nPlease run:\n- wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PocketMine/php-build-scripts/master/compile.sh on the PocketMine directory\n- ./compile.sh -t linux64 -c -f x86_64\nThat should compile and replace the local PHP binaries (not the system ones) with ones generated on your system. You may need to install perl, gcc, g++, make, automake, libtool, autoconf and m4 before running the script\n. It seems that some users reported issues with PHP 5.6.3\nTry running PHP_VERSION=\"5.6.2\" ./compile.sh -t linux64 -c -f x86_64\n. Well, one last thing. Open ./bin/php5/bin/php.ini with an editor and add ; in front of the zend_extension=opcache.so line, and try starting it again.\n. Did you experience this issue with old PocketMine-MP releases?\nI'm getting ready a special compile script and some test cases to try to pinpoint the issue, although I guess it's a combination of PHP + pthreads + OS here. I'll try to boot up a VM and reproduce the issue too, if that's possible it'll be easier for me to test things and fix it :)\n. @PEMapModder Use a PHP 5.6.2 build if on Windows\n. Try using PHP 5.6.2 binaries instead of PHP 5.6.3 (you can get them on the sourceforge project)\n. @PEMapModder yep\n. Still water is just an internal name, it won't stay still. It just means it won't get further scheduled updates\n. This issue is invalid. Please read the releases page.\n. Seems like you have another server open.\n. You might want to use McRegion worlds instead of Anvil worlds for better performance\n. You are using an outdated version.\n. It seems like you are using a really old version, please update your build :)\n. - git pull https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP.git master\n- git checkout origin/master\n- git submodule update --init --recursive\nRemember that running PocketMine from source code is slower than using the Phar. The Phar has optimizations applied when built.\n. It seems like you are kicking the player between some special calls, could you point out on which event?\n. This is dead code, which needs porting to work on PM.\n. Please do a timings report, (start it when you detect those issues), and post the link back in here.\n. This seems like a world generation issue, and it has been fixed\n. Remember that Config->get(\"a.node.here\") won't work for nested properties, you've to use getNested() and setNested(). I'll implement this on a different patch\n. It seems like you have debug mode enabled. Please do not report issues that only whos with debug mode enabled, as this is the expected behavior.\n. It seems like you are building inside the spawn protection radius. Please disable it or op yourself\n. It seems like you are using an older build, as this was already fixed. If you can't upgrade to a newer build, one workaround is setting the player health back to 20 if he has died on PlayerLoginEvent.\n. PocketMine Soft has been updated to a later version.\n. Well, the website asks you to navigate to the folder where you want to install PocketMine. Breaking the current behavior will cause issues when upgrading from old versions, or different builds.\nWhat could be done is adding a confirmation if the current folder is not empty and doesn't have the .phar in there.\nAlso, the repository for the installer script is https://github.com/PocketMine/php-build-scripts\n. As I said to you in #322, you'll be blocked from the PocketMine org. repositories if you spam or abuse it.\n. Plugin developers can debug this adding a try -> catch block in their events or commands.\nCatching exceptions and ignoring them will cause instability, the current handling enforces plugin developers to fix bugs in their code.\nAs far as I know, this is how it worked on Bukkit/Craftbukkit/Spigot\n. @PEMapModder If people really want this, I would prefer something that allows handling exceptions from all kinds on a single plugin, like:\n- ExceptionEvent\n  - CommandExceptionEvent\n  - EventExceptionEvent\n  - TaskExceptionEvent\nEach one of these has the causing object, and several different info. This allows a plugin to exist and handle reporting / logging of exceptions by itself, so other plugins don't have to handle that. At the same time, plugins can log their own errors using this method.\nRemember that this is not a way to just ignore normal errors. Doing that counts a s a bad practice and might not be allowed on the repository\n. This is being closed due to not being implemented.\n. This is not a PocketMine-MP issue. Please check your working directory, because Android will block most of the things.\n. This has been fixed in new builds, please replace all your light blocks so they populate light data.\n. Please check if you have g++, and upload the install.log somewhere. Do that on the proper compile script repository, as this issue is invalid\n. Please check if this has been fixed on the latest dev build\n. Thanks for the report! LevelDB support is currently experimental, so there will be lots of issues to fix :)\nCould you upload the original world you used? I'll be able to check internal data that way.\n. The plant issue has been fixed. The chest issue was not a real issue, please check the bottom of the chests. I've improved the code a bit, but Double chests are quite buggy right now.\nPlease use the latest development build and import your world again.\nAbout the spawn issue, pocketmine handles player spawnpoints different. It won't import them from the level file\n. Please upload your crash reports on the Crash Archive and link the Crash report back in here :)\n. That is a weird error, seems like some kind of chunk with a few thousand tile entities (chests, signs, etc) that couldn't generate normally.\n. Duplicate of #2424 and #2361. Please do not open duplicated issues and follow the Contribution Guidelines in the future.\n. This is a duplicate of #2423\n. @PEMapModder He has been already reported to the Github staff, it's possibly Syriamanal on a different account after his old one got blocked from Github\n. Please set your server on debug mode and provide further information, as this bug cannot be reproduced and the error message is not really useful.\n. You haven't provided enough information, please specify your build number, exact operating system, and configuration.\nThis seems to be running on a really old build. If you haven't tested the latest development build, please do so, as reporting bugs that do not exist anymore is not a good thing :)\n. Read in Twitter that PocketMine now supports LevelDB worlds, only on Linux and after upgrading the PHP binaries.\n. This is not a support forum, please check your server console and ask questions on the forums.\n. It seems like your device can't handle world generation, please try generating a FLAT world\n. This seems to be caused by players attacking the server. Please provide a network packet log using PacketLogger.\n. This seems like an error when copying the files to the server.\nRemember that this is not a support forum\n. Try the latest build (just released today) and tell us if it works correctly. This is an issue of PHP, and not directly of PocketMine. If it still does not work, upgrade the PocketMine-MP.phar manually on the old version and use that installation - it'll use old binaries.\nAs this issue has been duplicated several times and it is not PM's fault, I'm closing it\n. You might want to try to use the latest development build, it should run fine for you.\nI found some commits on the PHP source code that could cause the issue, and added a workaround for it. Please test and give feedback :)\n. Yes. As of my reasons stated above, this is a good change with no side effects to implement.\n. @InusualZ which system do you want to replace? This just changes the version name, not how we release builds. The existing stable/beta/development channel are not changed.\n. @InusualZ that's what the development build is.\nIf you want to compare Minecraft releases and PocketMine releases, it would be this way:\n- Development build: snapshot\n- Beta build: pre-release\n- Stable build: normal release\n. @PEMapModder Yep, if the \"stage\" continued to be in, I would like to have it AFTER the version number.\n. The vote has been closed, and this pull request is being merged.\n. As the log says sorry, unimplemented: non-static data member initializers\nLevelDB uses C++11 features, so you need a newer compiler (gcc and g++ 4.7 / 4.8)\nI might add LevelDB as a flag on the installer.\nYou can run \"sudo do-release-upgrade\" and upgrade ubuntu to 14.04 or 14.10, then upgrade gcc.\nWe are trying to get LevelDB in more distributions, old systems and operating systems, but there are some issues that we have to address.\nI'll leave this issue open as future reference, but remember that this is not PocketMine-MP fault.\nIf you have future issues with the installer/compiler script, please report them in the correct repository\n. This is an outdated version.\n. This issue is invalid. Please follow the Contribution Guidelines in the future.\n. The old prefix is not needed, both MINECON and Demo works. If it defaults to MINECON in vanilla, I should tell @Zhoroaan\n. @ns827 This is not the place to do so. These links are listed on several parts of the README and source code:\nhttp://wiki.unrealadmin.org/UT3_query_protocol\nhttps://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_RCON_Protocol\n. Please set up reminders in your agenda instead of the repository, as all issues must follow the Contribution Guidelines.\n. They are unloading in my local copy with the defaults. We are already aware of this issue, and there are lots of duplicated reports.\n. @xxFlare It's also happening on #855. Anyways, you can download old versions manually\n. You are using an outdated version. Please use the beta or development builds\n. This is a MCPE issue. As tile entities cannot be unloaded, they stay until unloaded by the client or you join again\n. This is an issue with your configuration, please use the forum for support. You might also want to upgrade and check that your external IP did not change.\n. It seems like Cloudflare blocks some hosts from using the API\n. @supersonic023 @jjg That is not needed, you can use the -i flag to ignore the certificate validity. You can also update the certificake package on each distribution.\n. This is just an issue tracker. Please do not create future tickets of this kind.\nPocketMine-Soft adds extra options. Like pocketmine.yml, editing that file without knowing what each option does MIGHT break your server, at least partially. In the case of pocketmine-soft.yml, changing any of the default settings WILL break things. No movement checks checks? Players will have wrong ground values that breaks all kind of physics and damage checks. Different block collision values? Entities will go past through blocks. These settings are there for advanced users. If your server doesn't let you choose a .phar, switch to another one. I recommend an VPS (or dedicated server, if you can afford it) where you can run whatever you want, with no limitations at all and cheaper.\n. PocketMine-Soft includes an option to disable movement reverting. Be aware that player damage or block placing will be affected by this change, and that players will be able to cheat around the entire server.\n. This issue is invalid. You can change the chunk loading speed in the pocketmine.yml file.\nIn my test setup, the server sends 600 chunks in less than a second. You might have issues with a slow disk, or using a different world format.\nPlease refer from creating this kind of issues in the future, as all issues opened here must follow the Contribution Guidelines\n. This is not the correct repository for these kind of issues, and this is a problem with your node.\nTry using the -i flag\n. This might have been fixed by the latest commit.\n. This has been already \"fixed\" (it was a PHP issue)\n. This seems like a network and device issue, as other features load. Sometimes removing the chunk cache and closing Minecraft: PE properly fixes this issue.\n. This is not the place to report pocketmine-soft issues, and it seems like you are using an old Soft build\n. This is due to the world being generated. Please use a powerful device, as this is not a PocketMine issue\n. You must upgrade your server, as the version string changed. It seems like you are using a development version, beta is not affected.\n. Duplicate of #2475 \n. This is already fixed, disabling the updater is not recommended as you won't receive the notification of new updates in case of an important update (security, etc.) as it happened a few times in the past.\n. This might have been fixed by the latest commit.\n. Hmm, we are updating the process and scripts used to download PM builds, starting with the development builds. Try downloading the beta build\n. @port13 Are you downloading for MacOS or Linux? Try using wget as the homepage tells you to do.\nIf the build is invalid, the compiler will try to get you a working binary on your same system.\n. This is not an issue, that message will show when players go inside blocks when going around. As MCPE sends invalid positions, this happens. Testing with PC clients doesn't cause this issue.\n. Please do not open duplicated issues.\n. It also seems like you are running a weird version with strange content, as the Sandstone file doesn't have that amount of lines :)\n. Is this the memory showing up on the process list or in the console?\nIf it's the process list, this is not a PM issue but a PHP one, since multiple threads can use different amounts of memory.\n. Yes, this is a threading issue. Try to run the server without plugins, they might have done something wrong in their threading usage.\n. @PonyPC That's a completely different issue, please do not report multiple issues in the same ticket. Alsi, it's duplicated\n. No, it shouldn't crash that much. This last issue was unexpected, should be ok now. Also, this will only affect servers on a restart loop, that is an user issue.\n. It seems like you don' have permissions on that folder AND you did not read the release notes, as Windows doesn't support LevelDB worlds.\n. Hmm, is it happening on the latest development build?\n. This is not a PocketMine-MP issue. Please refer from posting this kind of issues in the future.\n. Double chests are buggy, this is a known issue.\n. This is a new security measure that protects against several types of world corruption. Before, finding one of these chunks caused the server to crash. Now it detects them.\n. Please convert your PC worlds to McRegion using external tools. You'll get greater performance than using Anvil directly.\n. Blame @Intyre!\n. Is this happening on the latest development build?\n. Yes, world generation uses memory. Check your pocketmine.yml for some dangerous settings.\n. @ns827 The world is saved compressed, while it's handled and loaded in RAM uncompressed. Try lowering the amount of sent chunks per client.\n. This can be caused due to bad network issues, too. Try using the latest development build.\n. @redmanjbj This is due to a save corruption, using the latest build might fix this issue\n. 4b73dbd and efe75f2 might fix this issue, they are available on the latest development build.\n. It seems like you did not set up your server correctly. This is not a support forum, please do not report these kind of issues in the future.\n. I can select all kind of fences and saplings correctly, are you sure that got tested correctly?\nPlease follow the Contribution Guidelines. This includes posting features listed in the \"Not implemented or known issues\" section on each release\n. This is a protocol issue. As the client doesn't send the hotbar slot they are using, the server has to guess and sending the inventory again (to maintain synchronization) shows the real order the server is using.\nThis is the protocol fault, not PocketMine\n. This has been fixed in 0.11. Doing this in another language and implementing cheat protection would have the same issue :)\n. You'll have to wait a bit, 0.11 is not yet released :)\n. How old were those builds?\n. Ah, I thought you mean that it did not lag before. Sorry, but it has lagged all the time, and it has only improved. World generation is costly.\nPlease read the pocketmine.yml and tune your chunk generation settings, you might also want to try the threaded generator (that might leak memory).\n. You can view the list of changes in https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/compare/Alpha_1.4dev-900...master#files_bucket\nBe aware that testing under my environment allows generating them normally.\n. @MobileCrafter I have the same issue, and I can only work around it. The main issue is noise generation. I speed up chunk generation 80% in the latest stable, but it still takes more than a few ticks per chunk.\n. It takes time due to the server generating new world. Anvil worlds can contain unknown PC blocks, which crashes MCPE\n. This issue is invalid. Please follow the Contribution Guidelines.\n. It does work. This is a client-side glitch\n. It seems like you are using new binaries on a system with no base support for them. Please do not report PHP bugs in this reposiotory,\n. It seems like this might be a plugin issue, could you try removing all of them?\n. This seems like a loop that is not ending. We did get reports of this before, the cause being on a plugin that created Async Tasks not properly.\nYou can fork PM and add a bunch of debug outputs. Also, enabling debug level 2 on pocketmine.yml will give extra information.\nI don't know which part could be causing this so I cannot give you a custom build.\n. Async Task != Scheduled task (Plugin Task)\n. Async tasks might cause issues too, due to the serialization used.\n. @3do2 If your server hangs up again, try running this script:\nhttps://gist.github.com/shoghicp/2b93ac93664561c0e9e4#file-analysishangup-sh\n(analysisHangUp.sh)\nBe sure to have only one PocketMine server running at that moment (the blocked one), it'll get all kinds of useful info from the existing process without stopping it. Be aware that you need strace installed and it'll ask you for root.\n.

Please see this article\nSeems like FUTEX_WAIT was broken in the Linux kernel.\n\nThe impact of this kernel bug is very simple: user processes can deadlock and hang in seemingly impossible situations. A futex wait call (and anything using a futex wait) can stay blocked forever, even though it had been properly woken up by someone.\n\nIf you had this problem, try updating to 3.18 or newer kernel. You can also check if your maintainer has backported the fix to older versions.\n. PocketMine 1.5 will be released with MCPE 0.11\n. The list of things left for release has been updated.\n. ## Please use the proper repository for installation issues\nIt seems like the installer did not finis successfully, did you install the packages required for the fallback compilation?\n. Please read and follow http://pocketmine.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\n. This issue is invalid. Please use the Crash Archive to report crashes.\n. This is due to PHP, and the experimental pthreads extension. As some threads (specifically, console reading) gets blocked, things go wrong at the end.\n. This is not the proper way to implement them. Please read the Contribution Guidelines.\n. There is no \"duplication\" protection.\nThere is a Transaction checking, so players must interact correctly with inventories as otherwise the server will refuse the transaction and rollback it.\nIf there is a bug, the server will create those items, so players can then use them.\nNote that currently this issue is invalid. Please add extra information as this cannot be reproduced right now.\n. @iJoshuaHD We fixed the documented way to trigger the bug. If you can correctly document another way to duplicate items, please open a new issue.\n. This is a Mojang issue. Please follow the Contribution Guidelines and do not report invalid issues.\n. This issue is invalid. Please follow the Contribution Guidelines and upload crash reports to the Crash Archive\n. It seems like you are using a Soft build. Keep in mind that is not supported on this issue tracker.\n. Duplicate of #2531 \n. >:)\nThis happens due to the client not liking Transaction rollbacks\n. This is a plugin issue, as I told you before on the IRC channel. Plugins schedule things that break ticking.\nAlso, it seems like you are using Soft.

Please do not comment on old issues. This has been fixed on the newest version.\n. This should have been fixed by 9173f930ca0c4ff6570ac10f8f0eb6876e42265e already\n. This has been already fixed\n. You have to use the provided binaries, or build your own using the installer\n. On top of them? there is a special case for fences, might need to add one for walls.\n. This might not be needed soon.\n. Text wrapping has been added see this tweet. Aligning fonts will break on different devices and places, and should not be done automatically.\n. Seems like the newest RPi uses a different arch, it won't be auto detected. Please submit this report to the php-build-scripts repo, and the gcc version you have\n. Mobs won't be partially implemented. This was done for Zombies and Villagers, and it was a bad idea.\n. Seems like you don't understand what you are reporting. Glowstone blocks are one full block. That is the default bounding box, that they have.\n. Trees grow on the client side. This is a client bug :P\n. This should have been fixed for the next release of Minecraft\n. This error is just something PHP causes :(\n\n@unerds Please test the latest dev, it has fixes for that\n. Seems like you did not set up your server properly. Please read the documentation.\n. I can't reproduce this issue.\n. Player->sendMessage(implode(\"\\n\", [\"Hi\", \"Hello Again!!\", \"You're Back!! Yay!\"]));\nRemember that Player extends CommandSender. That's where sendMessage() gets defined, and modifying that would break all the message handling.\n. Your world seems corrupt, or the format is not supported on your platform\n.

You can do it manually via https://www.pocketmine.net/keys.html or download the development release\n. This might have been fixed by #2771\nPlease comment here if not fixed\n. Please follow the Contribution Guidelines and the code format requirements or this pull request will be closed.\n. Could you follow the Contribution Guidelines? Specifically the code formatting, so it follows the project's formatting\n. Could you send me your world files, and list of plugins you are using?\n. @Kadin15 you are subscribed to email notifications on GitHub. https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/issues/2745\n. @iVertx Seems that your issue is related to the plugins you have installed. I could not reproduce this with your world data.\nAlso, the high number of regions is due to the plugins. This same issue got reported and was caused by plugins not being developed properly.\n. Please stop your server correctly. Seems like they were not saved.\n. You already have methods to get parts in the inventory objects.\n. Seems like this was a problem due to entities duplicating in levelDB worlds. I pushed a patch a day ago that can fix this.\n. This is not a forum. Please follow the Contribution Guidelines or you may be blocked from this organization.\n. Is this still happening on the latest 1.5 build?\n. I'll review this in more detail once I get good internet at home, roaming sucks!\n. I've fixed several issues with your submission that did not follow the Contribution Guidelines. Following them is enforced.\n. The labels are applied by the moderators/contributors here, depending on the type of the submission.\n. Thanks for the fix!\n. @matcracker That depends if I have enough time :(\nGetting a release out has to be done after work, and sometimes it takes pretty long :P\n. Nice!\nI'm going to review all of the pending pull requests today, so this might make it into 1.4.1 :)\n. I've reverted this, please open a new pull request when everything is fixed :)\n. Seems like it saved the file as json\n. Can you finish this for 1.5 integration?\n. @PEMapModder there were some changes, including potions (they don't do damage as well)\n. I thought I had already fixed this... Still, you'll have an issue if that chunk contains something, it'll get duplicated over the world. The real solution would be calling the empty chunk method on the format, but you can't do that on another thread. I guess I'll move that to Chunk for 1.5\n. This might not work if that chunk is unloaded and the owner is running the generator on the main thread. The chunk should be cloned as soon as it is received.\n. I had already applied this patch to other branch and tested there, it should not affect things.\n. This does not apply to the version on the repository\n. oh. Well, now we only need to fix the thin vertical blocks like iron bars or glass panes, they are wrong. Also fences.\nI'll check this tomorrow, I can't test right now!\n. This does not fix the issue. Helps with detecting a problem, but without proper offset checks it's not useful. I've been experimenting with some other settings, but it'll be for 1.5\n. @vvzar The fix is correct, but doesn't fix all the things. It's only the first part :)\n. That's because you did not remove all .mca files before loading the world. Please remove them before loading a MCRegion file\n. Nice, I like this. Except that in_array() is O(n), making this O(n^2) at least. If you use the index as the key (as PocketMine does everywhere else) it'll be O(n)\n. Please do not open duplicated issues. This happens when clients go below Y = 0 and it's a client-side bug. In the future, use the search field at the top of this page to find duplicates.\n. @PEMapModder Plugins MUST NOT execute something after being disabled. This class will be removed as soon as the core dependency is removed.\n. @sekjun9878 I might create a different CallbackTask for plugins in the future, where you have to specify the plugin as a parameter. Having tasks by plugins not deleted can cause memory leaks, chunks not unloading, and duplicated players in memory that fire its own updates.\nAny plugin that executes code after being disabled won't be accepted in the repository, as specified by the guidelines and enforced by the core\n. It's using a callable and not a closure. It'll be done in a different way after changing it for plugin usage\n. Yep, I've to work more on 1.5 but I'm waiting for some last protocol changes - working on three branches with different protocols is a bit messy D:\n. 0.11 sends block breaking orders in a different way, that might cause this\n. This is what is being worked on the branch new-blocks for a few weeks already\n. Meh, I though I pushed this days ago. Seems like not!\n. Colors are wrong on a few biomes. It is this way to debug them, will be fixed before a beta build is released\n. It works. please check the API and parameters.\n. This is a client-side bug\n. Nice!\nIt's not ready for Crowdin yet, but I'll upload it there soon :)\n. You can now translate it on http://translate.pocketmine.net/translate/pocketmine/21/en-ko\nI've uploaded the already existing translations.\n. @64FF00 You can also help everyone at http://translate.pocketmine.net/translate/pocketmine/21/en-ko and vote the best ones (there are already a few ones!)\n. Seems like you disabled compression.\n. You can blame pthreads for that, some resources are not freed correctly on shutdown.\n. Thanks! I've implemented it in a different way.\n. You can send Floating text using FloatingTextParticle, or NPCs using the Human class. Doing things manually with packets will break with each MCPE update (protocol is not versioned in the API)\n.\nYou can check what PocketMine does if you read its source code.\n. Could you enable debug level 2 on pocketmine.yml to see if you get extra information?\n. Yep, I'm working on this :)\n. You have to use the TaskHandler to cancel the task.\n. No, you don't want that.\n. Fixed the error itself!\n. Generic reason means that a plugin has called that.\n. Please update to the latest dev build :)\n. This is a bug of MCPE that will be fixed in the next beta build.\n. Colored chat is blocked in pocketmine and must be enabled by plugins / being OP.\n. Please do not report client-side issues \n. No, it's not. You are completely wrong. Wait patiently for build 3 and see :)\n. @PEMapModder no, MCPE did not replace the language parameters correctly.\n. This breaks all the compatibility layers we implemented, please don't do this.\n. This is not compatible with PocketMine 1.5, touches unwanted files, does not follow the Contribution Guidelines, does unwanted actions, implements obsolete methods and doesn't have proper AI (not even targeted, it's random)\n. Please do this on translate.pocketmine.net, besides, this is not the repository for this issue.\n. This is not a support forum. Seems like you did not configure your server properly\n. The effect is called swiftness here :)\n. I'm not able to reproduce this issue.\nAre you sure you are on the latest pocketmine development build? Otherwise this issue breaks the Contribution Guidelines.\n. Seems like the server hit the memory limit (or another priority needed memory) and got killed.\n. This might be a problem with a permissions plugin.\n. @alejandroliu You have to call Tile->close(), that'll do everything for you.\n. This might have been fixed by f133154919e8fe340972e4beb12b2ba7b6d478fe\n. Do you have networking.async-compression set to true? If so, disable it and try again, because that'll be part of the issue.\n. I'm not able to reproduce this anymore.\n. The amount of memory reported by PocketMine 1.5 is different than the amount of reported by 1.4.\n1.4 only reported the current thread PHP space memory, while 1.5 reports the allocated memory for the entire process (and all threads), including RAM and virtual memory.\n. You will be removed from being able to contribute to this repository if you keep opening spam issues and not following the Contribution Guidelines.\n. @sekjun9878 please revert this change. Breaks backwards compatibility and needs other stuff, but I'm away now\n. Please follow the Contribution Guidelines.\n. Seems like you have a plugin issue. Please do not report plugin issues here and follow the Contribution Guidelines\n. Is this still happening on the latest build?\n. Shouldn't happen anymore\n. Seems like you are canceling the PlayerInteractEvent that will fire it :)\n. This still does unwanted side effects and does not follow the code format (see Contribution Guidelines).\nAnyway, if an AI is implemented into PocketMine, it'll be a generic one that can be used for other entities and goals, not everything inside the same class.\n. This has been already fixed.\n. Seems like you have some strange issue with text replacement, but it works the same as on Linux. Did you use the normal start.cmd script instead of manually launching it?\n. Seems like you are not using the latest development build. Please follow the Contribution Guidelines when reporting issues.\n. Fixed by 529f9b148bd6bcda2085376f5d60cfc2664334fd\n. This has been already fixed\n. Seems like you are abusing callback tasks and they take a lot of time. Please check your plugins as they are lagging your server. Remember that we don't support plugins here.\n. @Falkirks That would happen even with only include. It's due to the classes being incomplete that it fails, not require\n. This does not fix anything. If you follow the code execution, the spawn action has been already executed. Also, you are trying to spawn the player to itself, which won't work and if the checks were not there (for people that don't have any idea about how this works) you would have crashed all the players that join the server.\n. @alejandroliu I still have to implement it to be able to use lamdas\n. @sekjun9878 Things like adding ticks is just trying to not to follow proper OOP conventions and just have it on simple callbacks (that need to be public). There is also no confirmation of the object being part of the Plugin.\nThis was a helper class that was created to move from 1.3 core to 1.4, and finally it's done that way. Users had a warning in the header, it'll be removed once we push to API 2.0 (it'll remove all deprecated calls or events, which doesn't meat that plugins won't be compatible)\n. @sekjun9878 I know. Just my opinion (and I left more on the IRC)\n. Seems like there is a chunk not loaded for you internally, and the server waits for it.\n. convert world is not yet implemented, and doesn't change the format of existing worlds. seems like a random occurrence.\n. Is this still happening on the latest promoted 1.5 build?\n. Seems like you have a corrupted installation. Please upgrade to the latest one.\n. Seems like you are not using the latest version.\n. @Striker209MPE You can only get the tile entities on loaded chunks\n. Seems like you are using an unsupported distribution of PocketMine, we don't support them here. Please review the Contribution Guidelines or you may have the permissions on this repository revoked.\n. Stop opening issues for old versions of PocketMine.\n. I'm not able to reproduce this on the latest version \n. @MagicDroidX you can't change the generator of a level using that.\n. You can only have the same slot placed on the same spot twice, it's not duplication. Also, seems like you are not using the latest version. latest version has fixes for this.\n. Duplicated issue\n. Please follow the Contribution Guidelines. If you continue to open spam-alike issues you may be blocked from this organization.\n. This is a problem with your plugin. If you continue opening issues that break the Contribution Guidelines, you may be blocked from this organization.\n. You are using an outdated version.\n. That's an interesting race condition!\n. You are not using the latest version. Please don't comment on closed commits.\n. No, it's not. Latest version has that method on a different line\n. Stop commenting on this issue and inform yourself on the commits pushed to this repository. You are NOT in the latest version.\n. Please do not open duplicate invalid issues.\n. This issue is invalid. Please follow he Contribution Guidelines when reporting issues for PocketMine.\nYou can join the Japanese section on the official forums. There is no official wiki or other sites besides the forums.\n. Stop opening duplicate invalid issues related to plugins.\n. MCPE can make players desynchronize after using setNameTag() after PlayerLoginEvent (aka, PlayerJoinEvent or any other event)\n. Yes, this is 100% intended as it fixes the light on old worlds. If you let the worlds save they'll receive the new light\n. Are you using LevelDB as the level format?\n. Seems like it's a problem with LevelDB when stopping/saving. I'll try to reproduce it on my installation.\n. @HmHmmHm we are trying to find a solution to the issue, not workaround it.\n. This is a leveldb error triggered when there is not enough memory to allocate.\nWe can't do anything on our side.\n. If the death message is shown, PlayerDeathEvent is called. #2999 is just a client-side death (my guess in 0.10 and void)\n. php\n$p = $event->getPlayer();\n$p->teleport($p->getLevel()->getSafeSpawn());\nWHY would you even want to get the level object, then the name, then lookup (using an O(n)) method then use the same object to teleport?\n. LevelDB is not supported on systems that are not Linux due to the binding author decision.\n. @tbremer19 You can convert it using other tools to Anvil/McRegion, preferably McRegion. Both will be loaded by PocketMine. You can also run a virtual machine or switch to linux, where PocketMine will run way faster.\n. DO NOT OPEN DUPLICATE ISSUES. Please read the Contribution Guidelines and search the repository and open issues for similar ones before creating an open one.\n. Did you even check the repository?\n. This is a fault of a plugin, setting the gamemode on an unexpected place\n. This is not needed as old clients won't accept this packet while not being logged in, it'll be ignored.\n. invisible bedrock is an invalid block in PocketMine\n. If you keep opening duplicated invalid issues (see #3025) you may be blocked from this organization.\n. Don't use Anvil for worlds, the are slow and will fill your async queues, stopping world loading.\n. This is outdated.\n. You may be in a network with high packet loss rate or filled the tasks.\nAlso, you are not using the latest version.\n. Server. It doesn't matter on the server, but the client may be dropping packets. Just by using wireless networks it's around 15%, and worse over mobile data.\n. Can you drop an item in the area and see if this happens?\nThere was an issue with duplicated entities on some chunks, but it was fixed.\nAlso, I only see a few of them. The duplication that I know of created a few thousand from a single one.\n. Ehh...\nNo. This does not fix the issue and is a really bad hack.\n. You might not be unloading worlds properly. Don't use Level->unload();\n. Also, if you are still getting chunks there are other issues with that level.\n. > bash: line 194: PocketMine-MP.phar: Permission denied\nDo you have permissions to write in the current directory?\nAlso, this is not the repository to open this issue.\n. Fixed by 0c6d8b9\n. If you keep opening invalid and duplicated issues, you may be blocked from this organization.\n. This is not a proper issue. Please follow the contribution guidelines.\nSeems like light is being calculated on chunks and they are not being saved.\n. I'm not able to reproduce this. Is this still happening? Remember to use the latest build available when testing for bugs.\n. I'm not able to reproduce this issue\n. You may have edited this and added a tab, read the error message\n. You seem to be using outdated PHP binaries.\n. Duplicate issue\n. Can not reproduce\n. We know, but we don't have the same items as in vanilla MCPE. Plugins can add their own items if they want.\n. Constants are never removed, they are left for different makings. I'll check the other stuff later\n. This crash is caused by a plugin that does not define a proper API version.\n@sekjun9878 please don't tag invalid/plugin issues with valid tags, makes finding issues later harder.\n. @sekjun9878 it's just a crash by a plugin, not fault of PocketMine. The report itself shows that\n. This is caused by an MCPE issue, as the string is sent partially translated with the proper parameters but corrupts it instead.\nPlease don't open client-side issues here.\n. This might happen if you have auto save off or there is an issue saving files (or players are closed several times incorrectly)\n. You put invalid settings in your PocketMine.yml\nPlease don't report this kind of issue\n. No, plugins should do this before. Also, they usage of binary operators does that automatically. If any, this is fault of the caller. You can see that in PM any vector that might be a float is converted before calling it\n. That happens because the client predicts interactions. Some of them are bugs and some others expected behavior, this one seems a bug of the client\n. Could you report this on bugs.mojang.com?\n. Hmm, why is that called before the construct?\nAlso, nice having your own crash archive :)\n. This can be done with logrotate, if you restart the server daily or run it on a cronjob.\n. @sekjun9878 as I said, this can be done using logrotate. Let's follow what the official MC PC server does by default on both .exe and .jar versions.\n. This should be compatible with Position::fromObject().\nYou can put yaw and pitch at the end (after Level)\n. The server tries to save everything when crashing, but sometimes this is not possible (example, crash while saving!)\nBe sure to have auto-save on, otherwise it won't be saved anyways\n. setMotion() is not dependent on direction. Seems like you don't know how to handle negative positions on your plugin, which causes it to set the wrong motion.\nIf any, there was a problem with downwards motion.\n. This is just an implementation detail. MCPE changed how it spawns so you can't teleport it there. If you can handle an event and set the destination on the event itself, that works better than manually teleporting players, as PocketMine also expects a change there and prepares for it.\n. I'm not able to reproduce this on the latest promoted development build. Are you using that one?\nRemember that using non-promoted builds is not supported and counts as an invalid issue.\nPlease remember to follow the contribution guidelines in the future.\n. Please don't open duplicate issues related to the client.\n. This is not the place to open this issue.\n. Is this still happening on the latest development build?\n. The server calculates bounding boxes a few ticks after the player moves, which can cause this.\n. Please don't open random pull request without code contribution or you may be blocked from this organization.\n. Your problem, not PocketMine\n. Cannot open temporary file for decompressing phar archive\nPlease read your error messages as this fills precious time from us.\n. Is that percentage the one over all the cores or per single core?\n. @peepzandmeepz Using async won't off-load calculations that are done normally on the main thread, so if no world is being generated it won't be used. 22% * 4 is 88%, more likely for 100% (but still strange)\nRemember that you are running of a development version and lots of changes can happen all the time.\n. @peepzandmeepz it also means that one of them is using 88%. Please open an process manager that lets you see it per core to see the percentage directly (for example, htop)\n. We know about that issue but I'm not able to reproduce that locally :(\n. @peepzandmeepz \nSet settings.profile-report-trigger to 15 and settings.enable-profiling to true on pocketmine.yml\nAfter the CPU thing happens and tps lowers, execute the timings paste command and submit the resulting links here (the timings.aikar one)\n. Can you check this issue again?\n. @peepzandmeepz That is chunk loading, sometimes it can be quite slow when accessing the disk. On SSDs it should behave better, also needs to send them over the network. Try enabling the chunk cache if you have a mostly static world or limited to a small area.\n. MCPE does not calculate grass colors, so it needs that information.\nBiome colors are not populated on old worlds yet, as not all biomes have been implemented yet.\n. yes, biomes have grass colors. there is already an issue about this, but as everything, needs time for fixing it\n. Do not load the same world on the same object.\n. Seems like you are not using the latest development build - timings are different now. Please reopen a new issue if entity ticking is still the source of all your lag.\nAlso, in the future, provide a direct link to the timings.aikar system - it's uploaded to paste.ubuntu.com with a direct view into that tool.\n. 1.4.1 is a production release, 1.5 is still in development.\n. MCPE gets updated, and with it it has network protocol changes. That means that new versions of the game won't be able to connect to old versions of PocketMine\n. Do NOT open duplicate issues.\n. Can't reproduce, user fault.\n. You are not following the Contribution Guidelines.\nYour issues will be closed without more warnings.\n. You can't unload the default level\n. Tested this in the latest build, was able to craft a door.\nDon't open new invalid issues.\n. You are on a REALLY old build. Please stop complaining about old issues or you may be blocked from this organization\n. - You are unloading a level twice\n- Level->unload() should never be called directly.\n. Do you have a plugin that teleports or does something on PlayerDeathEvent? that could be the source of your problems.\n. It would be nice to get a stacktrace or the full error message, as we can't guess what happens.\n. did you remember to enable debug level 2 on pocketmine.yml? This is a given when debugging an error.\n. I'm not able to reproduce this on the latest development build.\n^.^\n. @peepzandmeepz Why do you need to attach a log when this has been fixed?\n. @PEMapModder because that is dependent on the plugin being a phar, and that is only true in 1/3 of the possible plugin formats right now :)\n. @alejandroliu PharFileInfo is just an SplFileInfo with the same issues as the original object - you can't get the full data directly. That's why that was not chosen.\n. This was not decided to be merged. I've force-pushed master back.\n. On PC they did not know, they tried to generate them but on custom worlds everything was messed up.\nOn PocketMine worlds (or ported from Anvil) PM knows the biome that gets placed there.\n. Because it's case-insensitive.\n. We don't support PM Soft here\n. Your world is corrupted\n. I'm not able to reproduce this\n. You are using an outdated version of PocketMine \n. It's a client-side issue. If allow-flight is disabled, they player will be pushed to the ground automatically\n. Could you provide further details on the installer repository?\n. We should not keep opening and closing file resources all the time, and the server (depending on the logger implementation that CAN be replaced by plugins) can do this or not, or print partial lines.\nThe only safe to do this is to stop, rotate, and start\n. Check that the version of PocketMine and MCPE match, as this is the current issue users are having.\n. @64FF00 Entity AI was moved back from 1.5 due to time constraints, but after 0.12 I don't expect a lot of releases after a few months. It might not make it into 1.6.0, but maybe 1.6.1 or as a branch (as network-api, for example, it was intended for 1.5 but it's going to be pushed here to speed 1.5 release)\n. @PEMapModder static on MCPE, but dynamic in PM, so you'll be able to add any number of dimensions on levels (defaults to only Nether)\n. This is a client-side issue.\n. That might not be a valid value or it might not be translated, check the docs for more details\n. Can you drop some timings?\nAlso, have you checked your settings to see if the memory limit has been hit? You might want to increase that when having extra threads, garbage collection can eat up the tps when not configured\n. They read from disk and set permissions on Join, and permission calculation is slow. But that is a single-tick issue, not something that continues\n. People joining is one of the things that lag the most.\nCould you also try to enable debug commands and run /gc? That might free some things after a lot of people join (the command takes a bit of time)\n. Did you remember to add the proper indentation (spaces) on the YAML file?\n. @alejandroliu Yes, and that confused me as well :S\n. You might want to implement this on Player->switchLevel() instead of teleport\n. Also, mark this code with //TODO HACK as I'll be looking for those later between version upgrades.\n. @alejandroliu $oldLevel->getTiles() will send more data than needed, as that will get all from the entire world. What you want is to do that on unloadChunk() (so it's not implemented in two places) so you can get the Chunk tiles directly.\n. Can you squash this into a single commit so we don't have all the tries? Then force-push into your branch.\n. This is a limit on MCPE and not PM, and it works like this on PC\n. Thanks for reporting this!\nI've extended your pull request with some extra blocks that were missing as well, like mossy stone bricks and cracked stone bricks.\n. @markkrueg Just clone the repository, those things get added as a build step over jenkins.pocketmine.net\nIt inlines several used methods and/or creates different files per platform integer size for improveed performance.\n. Nothing got changed, and I can't reproduce this on my local server.\nTry downloading a new build.\n. You are using a 0.10 server. I guess you want a 0.11 one\n. That is not the problem of the memory usage. Those files are not loaded (they are stubs) except when a plugin uses them (and that's the problem).\nAll of the PM code compiled to opcodes is around 1.6MB on my 64-bit system, and that's what resides in memory.\nNot using autoloader would mean having an include for every file needed, which would negate the use of our existing namespace and use statement usage AND not reduce memory usage (the same files would be included!)\nI don't see the point of this issue, nor any benefits from it (only disadvantages!) so I'm closing it.\n. Auto loader only allows to load classes when they are needed, instead of all at the same time. Try running on Linux.\nAlso, it seems like you are using the Windows 64-bit version, which is broken.\n. @china-richway2 You should not handle the .phar as an archive of only PHP files, it can include extra data, resources, and duplicate files. For example, PHP files are triplicated with different conversions for platform dependent code, so loading all of them will fail.\nWhat is happening here is that the thread is crashing AND creates a new one, which leaks a lot of memory.\nTry doing this on the main thread instead of having an async task to see your problem.\n. Can you change the target of this fix to the new-blocks branch instead of master?\nAll the fixes are being done there.\n. Closing this as the other PR has been created\n. Then don't open the PR\n. This will happen in other places as well (rivers, a few biomes that go underwater)\nThis is not the way to fix it, as parts of the biome generation are not yet implemented, including underwater populators (with sand, gravel and dirt)\n. Also this makes the build fail, this pull request is broken\n. I still don't understand why you want all the tools in creative, even when they don't give extra benefit (except swords). This was a debug thing on MCPE that got by error into a build then it was left there\n. The local ip is not used for anything except some non-critical info in the install wizard\n. Anvil worlds are really slow due to real time conversion, use LevelDB worlds or McRegion\n. PC McRegion worlds have no information on their biome saved on disk, so you can't regenerate the grass color\n. \"Probably\" did you even test this?\n. Instead of fixing it on the call, this could be fixed on the parsing itself. That would be truly compatible with plugins, and would be dynamic if the color changes in the future.\n. Could you give more details?\nAlso, you are using the wrong php binaries\n. Please don't open duplicated invalid issues\n. You seem like you are not using the latest builds provided.\nAlso, remember to set the soft limits on pocketmine.yml to something below the RAM you want to use, otherwise it won't free resources when needed.\n. Are you sure you want to lower the limit to that ridiculous small value with a lot of players and worlds?\nThis will only cause issues as it'll try to force-clean memory in a lot of places and cause extra lag.\nMisconfiguration of the server is not a valid reason to open an issue.\n. Please don't open invalid issues not related to the PocketMine core here.\n. This is not a PocketMine crash.\n. D: there are extra tabs and spaces around the file\nBeside that, seems ok, although only chests and signs need this. You can check if they are instances of Spawnable so it doesn't send extra data that is not needed.\n. This issue is invalid.\nFollow the Contribution Guidelines properly.\n. I don't see the bug, could you explain?\nIf there is anything wrong with your output, download the minecraft server jar and run it on nogui mode and check it. It should be the same.\n. You are not using the latest build\n. This might happen after players get kicked and plugins still have references to them. This is a plugin issue, not PocketMine\n. \u00ac\u00ac\nWhy those two lines and not everything else?\nAlso, no\n. This is due to you not allocating enough async workers for this task - it's done asynchronously.\nAnvil worlds are not the default format, only MCRegion and LevelDB are supported fully.\n. At least 2, and if a task gets locked there (some plugins do this) it may slow down the execution of the other tasks\n. You've to configure your server properly.\nTry disabling chunk ticking on your pocketmine.yml\n. @HmHmmHm if that does not happen, players will leak memory. This is a problem with plugins saving references to players and calling them later\n. It does not fix the crash, it just leaks memory for you. Plugins are checking permissions AFTER the player has been closed, which is bad (and another memory leak!)\n. Fire ticking is not implemented, this is not a bug.\n. Easier parsing, but you broke the existing parsing.\nThis was done to copy the format used in PC and other plugins (so existing code would be compatible with it), this now breaks compatibility with them completely.\n. Anyway, this does not make parsing \"easier\", it's the same, just an extra character.\n/^([^:]+): ([^\\.]+)\\.$/ with dot\n/^([^:]+): (.+)$/ without dot\nthen remove the special chars and you have everything split by key and value\n. You don't need to get the IP address of an user to ban him. Just do /ban-ip \nAlso, this can be bundled as a plugin directly. A lot of the commands you posted here are implementation-dependent (example, inspecting inventory may not work on all platforms).\nThe commands shipped by default are there for basic administration and using the basic Minecraft features. Coord is not useful, as you can teleport to a player and you would not want to do that except if the player itself wants to see it (at that point this is not a server and just a single player world that runs on a different system).\nIf you add /motd, people will want to modify all the settings everywhere, this is not possible.\n. Also, 1.5 is due to release in a few days. Please don't add stuff that is not needed or critical into that milestone.\n. @RandomAltThing You are completely wrong. Please stop using your alternate account after you were blocked from this repository.\n. Yes, that's why particles are op only. If you are op, you can also stop the server\n. The feature is not the command, that's just ridiculous. The feature is that things can make particles, for example, critical arrows or block breaks\n. @jazzwhistle Users that use commands to create instant particles somewhere should think of using a plugin that creates particles on tap of a block, or things like that.\nIf you have OP, you can do anything on the server. It's a design feature and you are not an user anymore, you are an administrator. With that level of access, you can shut down the server, global ban the server, kick everyone, crash it in with several debug commands that warn you of that, or anything.\nIt seems that you don't even know what a feature is. The feature is not the command, that is just used to debug the feature, particles (development, see what they look like). You are providing a lot of particles, which if sent instantly to the client will crash it. I think if you use something that way it can't be called a feature anymore, don't you think? If you decide to crash players as a feature, just don't let them play and that's easier :)\n. This issue is invalid, check the Contribution Guidelines\n. This is being changed in new-blocks\n. This is an issue on your client, if you rejoin you'll see the tree correctly\n. This is due to a server misconfiguration caused by the user.\n. This will be solved with potions later.\n. You seem to not know how networks and binding to interfaces work. \n. You commented that this did not fix your issue on IRC, right?\n. I read this again, but you can only set the level at login / pre login via configuration. Setting it on Join is a really bad idea as players already got half of the other world sent to them.\nEven if this worked, you are causing lots of issues in clients on other parts of the code, change the level before the player starts doing things.\n. This is invalid, check the new-blocks branch\n. This is not a place to ask questions. Please follow the Contribution Guidelines.\nCheck the MCPE Servers panel done in Minecon for more info >:D\n. Please don't open duplicated issues\n. This is already implemented in the correct branch.\nAlso you should learn about if statements and conditional data\n. This is MCPE, not PocketMine\n. The memory management in PocketMine servers has changed.\nAlso, more threading features are used which are not bound (and can't be bound) to the main memory limit.\nThis is an issue on pthreads, as it's a separate execution context. You can trigger memory collections on other threads on the pocketmine.yml file\n. You are using the wrong character, please use the Unicode one.\n. Can you remove the meta property as well? Then amend your last commit and force-push to your branch to update this.\n. That property does not exist anymore on the packet\n. Actually it's clientId instead of clientID on remove packet. I'll just push something else, as we already have two pull requests that don't fix it completely.\n. Don't open issues for 1.6.\n. There is no call to decode on LevelDB, which means you are not using it.\nAlso, I'm not the one that maintains the extension, only the PHP code. I'm not the one you've to ask to add Windows support.\n. This is a glitch of the client, not PocketMine. @sekjun9878 please don't tag issues not related to PocketMine\n. If people are on creative mode, they will be able to build. There is no limitation on that.\nCheck that they are not inside the spawn radius. Also, if you OP someone, they'll have permissions and spawn area does not apply to them anymore.\n. Please don't open issues for non-master branches.\n. This is warned on startup, you have to set it up over pocketmine.yml. That config is deprecated\n. This is a client-side issue\n. Oh no, a warning would be worse. Please request this to be fixed on the plugins themselves, not here (as a player that has been disconnected is on an invalid state, doing stuff with it can crash OR leave the server in an unusable state (even corrupt everything).\nThe decision to leave it like that was made from the start.\n. They were kept like that for a reason - scripts are only intended to be fast ways to interact with the core and experiment, not create full plugins. Also adding special cases for arrays does not seem like a good option :(\nAlso this does not handle keys!\n. Can you generalize this patch so it supports any tag with array and key support?\nOtherwise adding special cases is not nice.\n. Well, you could have force-pushed to your old branch and the pull request gets updated :P\n. This was an old parameter that was not removed waiting for the API change... But I guess it's ok to do it now\n. Why was this merged? Entity is there because some entities might want to know the entity. If any, it should be able to be set to null (make it nullable with = null), not change the signature.\nThis also breaks compatibility with existing classes that extend this method.\n@sekjun9878 Please revert this now\n. Plugins can override that. PHP does have strict checking for signatures with class checks, which happens in this case, please do read the manual.\nI'm reverting it.\n. The idea of knockBack is that it can only be applied by entities - not using it right now on PM code doesn't mean that is not going to be used in the future, and plugins might like to know the Entity pushing them.\nFor example, look at the MC Java code for knockback: https://github.com/Bukkit/mc-dev/blob/master/net/minecraft/server/EntityLiving.java#L713-L729\nEntity is not used there but it's used by other entities. As we have not implemented AI or other stuff for other entities, of course you won't see it implemented elsewhere right now.\n. To properly fix this, we need a format system and a \"compiler\" to colors that does not depend on putting format codes everywhere.\nThat is already planned, and will fix all of these issues and allow other colors that are not white\n. ## This place is only for PocketMine-MP bug tracking, not install scripts or website support\nSeems like a problem with your DNS. You can also download the script manually and upload it to your server\n. This is not the place to open this kind of issues.\n\nRemember that the bleeding channel is not supported and is offered for users that don't want a development setup.\n. This is not a forum\n. Non-implemented stubs or blocks are not allowed. What is the point of them?\n. This is a problem caused by different code (there is a check for this already!) but the php7 branch should have this fixed because of types.\n. This is useful for the IPlayer interface, when you get an IPlayer that can be an OfflinePlayer or a Player\n. No, as listed in e137ac4c56b161b6e48a715f3176a084681b29b5 this version is not supported, and binaries are a work in progress.\n. Bleeding builds are not supported.\n.

Bleeding builds are not supported\n. Can you make everything a single commit?\n. Bleeding builds are not supported\n. If that doesn't exist the item is invalid and should be removed,\nalso your commit changed formatting.\n. This is already fixed in php7 branch\n. Good work, I'll review this tomorrow.\n. Let's not make stones (or other items) know about recipes :)\nIt's ok to have a way to do that on the recipe manager, but you can have blocks without recipes (it's a separated system)\n. The player itself will see the other entity (spectator) and it'll be blocked client-side\n. If crafting is done with transactions, you can block the transaction itself. Still, we should generalize this later with an interface, because maybe it won't be a player in the future (automation mods?)\n. This is a client-side issue not related to PocketMine\n. This is in my local branch already, more stuff tomorrow!\n. Remember that bleeding builds are not supported, and they include workarounds for client-side bugs that degrade other features\n. Don't reopen closed issues.\n. This is a place to report bugs, not non-implemented features. Check the code, we have comments there.\n. Yep, this is already on my local changes. those will get pushed today!\n. The signature is wrong in this case :(\n. Does this also support #3525 ?\n. Why would the provider return a string in this case? What provider are you using?\n. Yes, it fixes the issue by ignoring the original problem, a provider returning a string when THAT should return an integer. It should have a int at the start and no need to cast it.\nTry to find that and submit a PR for that issue!\n. Can you commit a patch? You can edit that file on your branch using the GitHub web interface, it'll show up here.\n. @PEMapModder Just use a normal PluginTask. I'm not so sure about doing this, as it involves callbacks which... might confuse stack traces.\n. I think you forgot something here: substr($content,-1), wouldn't that be substr($content,-1) === \"]\" (or $content{strlen($content) - 1} === \"]\")?\nAlso please use === instead of == in the first condition.\n.

Well according to that article, you can? I can't fix the problem because I have no access to the web hosting you have. So its entirely up to you. \n. So we need to make more people download this program. That seems to be the\nonly fix..\n. Have you looked at the FAQ? \n. Dear Philip Rader\n\nThank you for your contribution to PocketMine-MP. We will review the changes made and will be in contact with you shortly. \nBest Regards\nMichael Yoo\n. I think, you can clean up the code by using for and - 3 to the velocity? \nAlso, I will leave this for Shoghi to check since everybody has different styles of coding.\n. Shoghi always has a better ideas than I do so you might want to consider waiting for him but, have you tried deleting that user's player data?\n. Mostly Protocol To-Dos.. My weakness... Better work on documentation and API then....\n. @ksy4362 Is this a clean install or with plugins? Is this the latest stable(1.2) or the dev? Please post more information and create a separate issue page. Thanks!\n. @ksy4362 The bug has been fixed. Thanks!\n. Defaultgamemode command is finished.\n. Have a look at the Setting Up The Server guide.\nIf you need further information email me at sekjun9878@gmail.com or email our Discussion Email List(Preferred).\n. There is nothing much we can do about that apart from waiting for devs to update their plugins. If you are not developing a plugin, I suggest you use the stable version until the new version comes out. Just out of curiosity, can you please define what 'High Memory Usage' is? Try bumping the server memory limit and see if it helps your problem. \n. Have you tried loading the stable server with 31 players? The high usage might just be world data and more players probably won't effect it. Also, running the server for a long time can result in increasing memory usage(like memory leaks). So see if your server is subject to any of these problems. I will be awaiting your reply. \nBest Regards. \n. 1. The memory leak is an already fixed problem, fixed in 1.2\n2. The updating of plugins to suit the new versions of PocketMine is very largely dependant of the plugin developers. Unless you can modify the code to suit your needs personally or ask people who can program personally, there is next to nothing we can do as a Team. \n3. 1.2 is being released on the 5th of March. \nWhat is this plugin that you are having problems with?\n. Check your firewall settings to check if pocketmine isn't blocked. \n. Then why did you post it on our issues forum? \n. Just realised that if the user name is same the location is the same. Nevermind  this post. \n. That is because chests are not implemented yet. \n. Hi\nI have read your issue but I am unable to reply with a solution since I do not own a mac. Please be patient until we come up with a solution. \nBest Regards. \n. Remember: There always is the Google if you get stuck.\n. How long did it take to compile? \n. Is this from the latest 1.2 stable?\nAlso, I believe adding BurningFurnaceBlock type should fix it(Although I don't see why shoghi would make that decision.)\n. You're lucky. I need to test a solution and I am having trouble even installing PocketMine.\n. Need testing on this problem. Fix may have been comitted but has not been tested. Needs testing to see if my fix works.\n. Could you please re download and test again since I don't have access to my test machine right now? Thanks.\n. @ksy4362 Download new dev and test again?\n.

Although I understand 80% of it now. PHP is not a problem for me. Its the protocol side of things that gets me all the time.\n. Issue appears to have been solved. Issue closed.\n. Duplicate of #235 . Closed. Issue already solved.\n. I am not exactly sure what the problem could be there. Do you have any stack traces or plugins installed? Its kinda hard to tell how the problem could be caused with literally next-to-no information.\n. Duplicate of #232 . Please post your issues on #232 . Issue closed.\n. Looks like the php has not been installed properly. Could you please post the INSTALL.LOG here so we can have a look at why this has not been installed properly?\n. @Ereu please post your Install.log\n. --NAME CHANGED TO SUIT THE QUESTION--\n. @wrewolf the Installer should call the compile script directly during install. If anything failed, that means it failed at the compiler level. Unless the OP is using a developer version of PocketMine.\n. Problem is fixed with the updated stable release. Still 1.2.2.\n. What does 'Freeze all column high and down spawn point' mean?\n. Looks like php is not compling properly. I will look into it.\n. Run this: 'sudo apt-get install wget'\n. Can you upload the whole install.log on pastebin?\ninstall.log \uc804\uccb4\ub97c pastebin \uc5d0 \uc62c\ub824\uc11c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc138\uc694.(\ub9c1\ud06c\ub85c)\n. Is this version stable or development???\n. Found the issue. We are fixing it.\n. Yes. The problem is fixed in the latest development release.\n. The problem is now fixed in the stable release. Please try again.\n. The compiler takes a while. Try waiting.\n. No. All changes must be done by your client. The server does not change anything on the client except the map. PocketMine just emulates a MCPE server hosted by your MCPE app by analysing and emulating its protocols.\n. All changes are made in the server. For example, to make wood blocks water, we simply receive that a player has placed a wood block down. Now, here is the trick. Because every single message goes through the server, we can change anything we want. Instead of telling other clients that someone has placed a wood block, we can tell people that it was a water block.\n. But we cannot change things that don't go through the server such as, texture files, client-side mods, graphical settings etc.\n. 1. Whether the client DISPLAYS the nametag is client side, but the name on the nametag is decided by the server.\n2. Its okay. I am probably the hardest person to offend you will find on the internet :D\n. Could you please explain to me what creative inventory enforcement is? I didn't program that module and I have no idea what it is.\n. I see what it is. Every item, movement, chat, action you do on the client is sent to the server. If the server detects that you have gained an inappropriate material, then it sends the message to delete the item off the inventory.\n. Well listen carefully:\n1. The client's mod allows you to send the server a message allowing you to place items not in the creative inventory\n2. The server intercepts this message and either ignores it or tells the client to delete the item.\n3. The client must and will delete the item as that(delete the item) part of MCPE is HARDCODED into the app itself, irrelevant of the so file.\nImagine the same situation on a Computer version of Minecraft. Even if you mod the client, you can't play with that mod on on a vanila server.\nThis is how I think it works. And it probably is. There may be some errors there especially the 'Hardcoded' bit but I had to make it easy to explain.\n. Ask here. Its okay if I am attending the issue already.\n. The metadata. The metadata is like the level below the block ID. It contains the state of the redstone signals, state and direction of doors, text on sign etc. If block IDs are directories, then metadata is a subdirectory. And then there are those files that contain data.\n. And you are free to ask ANY question you want to ask. I am always here. Please don't be hesitant. You are not bothering me in any way.\n. If you mean With a plugin, then yes. Not sure about IN a plugin though. As plugins don't contain metadata.\n. @MinecraftAddict131 Join our IRC channel to chat with the developers and modders. \n.

Try to post it on pastebin see if it allows it. Can you maybe try again? This problem has been fixed (unless shoghicp put the wrong Pthreads version)\n. No idea about this error. Wait for shoghicp.

I am more like a helper :P. What can you do tho with a 14-15 year knowledge compared to a nearly 20's\n. Probably busy with his programming competition. He is top 20 of the 4000 who entered! And last year he was one of the top 3s.\n. Alright. I will notify you when anything related to this is found. \n. Sorry for the delayed response. All of us are very busy right now with all of our time consumed by school work.\n. Turning 15 in 3 months so.. Quite close to 15\n. I should be the one saying welcome :D. Thanks tho. \n.

This got fixed ages ago.... Are you using the latest dev? or the stable release?\n. Its not a respectable thing to modify other's plugin and release it unless you have direct permission from the author. Ask Omattyao to fix the problem. Or do it yourself for private use only.\n. Issue closed. Not a problem of PocketMine-MP.\n. lol its always the Raspberry Pi with the problems!\n. Translate is:\nTo load API, I need the following function in the ServerAPI\n$this->loadAPI(\"sign\", \"SignAPI\"); // The signAPI I am currently making\nThere should be a function that loads API automatically when put in(????)\nIf there are any other ways of loading plugins please tell me.\n. Shoudn't there be a safeguard to delete the sign only after the client has finished writing on it?\n. By the way, I am so sorry you couldn't get the information off our\ndocumentation.

Hi Chandroid97,\nTechnically, you could install PocketMine on a shared hosting because as long as dependencies are installed, PocketMine will install and run without root access.\nPlease note that running PocketMine on a shared hosting server will get your account terminated within a very short period. PocketMine is a game server program that consumes a lot of resources, and is not suitable for running on a shared environment.\nBest Regards.\n. ($target instanceof Entity) and ($this->entity instanceof Entity) and $this->entity->distance($target) should fix the problem but I cannot push code right now.\n. Any plugins?\n. Hi Raketemensch,\nI'll look into it. Thanks for reporting!\nBest Regards.\n. Does this problem still exist?\n. Please try using CFLAG=\"-m64\" ./<INSTALLER_NAME>.sh\n. Try CFLAG=\"-mx32\" ./<INSTALLER_NAME>.sh.\n. Issue Closed.\n. Hi PocketCreeper8,\nThe problem is caused by entering a port number in the server-ip section of the properties file. 'server-ip' should be 0.0.0.0, which is a wildcard IP address.\nBest Regards.\n. Hi must-lleibl,\nIf your server is on realms, you cannot join it from the realms screen, instead you have to use Direct IP Patching to join your server. I did not design Realms so I don't know why that restriction is in place.\nBest Regards.\n. Hi Chandroid97,\nThat part of the code is in PlayerAPI.php, near player.death. If you need further help modifying PocketMine to suit your needs, let us know.\nBest Regards.\n. Hi NATSOFT,\nLooks like you are using a plugin that is not support with the current version of PocketMine, try removing your plugins one at a time and see if one of the was causing the problem.\nBest Regards.\n. :O 2 lines!\n. Hi liberodark,\nI'm so sorry for the delayed response to your developer, I have been very busy lately. I have sent him an email regarding the resources needed to get him started.\nBest Regards.\n. Hi NATSOFT,\nIf you can, it will be a very good idea to put some filters on your server to prevent those attacks. Please look on Google for further information.\nAlso, to other developers, instead of displaying Unknown Packet on console, it may be a good idea just to ignore it.\nBest Regards.\n. Hi professorsheep,\nIs this problem on a LAN network? Have you set your firewall rules to allow PocketMine?\nBest Regards.\n. Hi Captainzee,\nCurrently land protection is out of scope of PocketMine. We offer a extensive API that allows third party developers to use PHP to code plugins. Please look through Minecraft Forums and look for your plugin there.\nBest Regards.\n. But then why not just whitelist the server? :D\n. Hello, DJBarnard.\nI'm not quite sure what you are talking about. Are you talking about PocketMine Realms? Or PocketMine Servers? Or something else?\nBest Regards\n. That's weird. I don't handle realms so you might need to wait until @shoghicp comes by.\n. Sorry for the delay, there have been some issues inside the PocketMine team and everyone is very distracted right now.\n. I'm working on a new website to allow adding of public servers. Issue closed. Duplicate.\n. Issue closed. That is on the to-do list and will be added in the near future when entity physics is complete.\n. It is a typo on the our side. Sorry for that! Issue Closed.\n. Could you try re-downloading the plugin? Looks like your copy is corrupt.\n. What PHP file are you copying?\n. Yes, but can I see the content of that file? Use pastebin.com.\n. Can you make sure your file permissions are set correctly?\n. Then it is something wrong with your installation. Can you make sure the owner of the file and folder/parent folders is correct?\n. First, running PocketMine as root is highly discouraged as on a very rare occasion PM is breached, the hacker will be able to gain full access to your server.\nSecondly, I'm not quite sure why that error is happening. Can you try a fresh install of PM?\n.

Again, this problem is due to how PM is written and PHP. Should be removed after the 1.4 rewrite (hopefully) :D\n. That's actually what I was thinking, as it will improve multi-core usage. I gotta remind shoghicp to add me back to Github again :(\n. Thank you Captain Obvious!\n. This is because PocketMine does not have horizontal physics yet. When this gets added in 1.4, arrows, item drops etc will be fixed.\n. Solution provided by @M1dgard. Issue Closed.\n. Please reset the DNS settings in your Wi-Fi and everything should work fine again.\n. Yes. Which should be released in a few hours now.\n. Yes. But it will be the official realms you will have to pay to get servers.\n. Does this problem still persist? If yes, please reopen this issue or create a new one.\n. Try restarting the whole computer. That should fix the issue.\n. #800 \n. #800 \n. Thanks! We will look into the issue.\n. That would be... You should be using an ORM such as a Doctrine to do that. Not PocketMine API.\n. Seems to be a world error. This happens quite frequently. Simply load another map until the level system is stablised.\n. Restart your computer. It means there is a trace of PocketMine left open which is locking the port from being used by anything else.\n. Thanks. We will make the changes accordingly.\n. We will add it soon enough, but right now all the members are really busy.\nThanks for your interest in PocketMine though and we will try to implement liquid flowing as soon as possible.\n. Duplicate Issue Closed.\n. Hello,\nThis is not a PocketMine problem. Please seek help in our forums.\nThanks.\n. Not a PocketMine issue. Closed.\n. Hi,\nWe plan to have a proper documentation when we get to beta, but right now our main developer is very busy with exams. We are also rewriting PocketMine in the next version so it would be pointless creating a documentation that would go legacy in a few weeks.\nThanks for your suggestion though. That is one of the things we will work on for sure!\n. You need to tell that to the plugin developer. Not us :)\n. Hmm, have you tried recompiling PHP?\n. Google is your friend :)\n.

You are using an outdated version of PocketMine. Please update it.\n. Please restart your computer. That means that the port is already in use by another program(usually a stray instance of PocketMine)\n. You have to separately get the php binary file, and the pocketmine file. Installer does not support XP since it is over a decade old. You can find more information on our documentation page.\n. It is already added to the todo list. Duplicate issue.\n. Reinstalling PocketMine should fix this issue. If it doesn't, please re-open this issue.\n. Looks like a client issue. Please visit the Mojang issue tracker to report client issues.\n. Hmm, we will try to look into it, but without much info about when it happens, we can't give any ETAs. Issue closed.\n. The new 0.7.6 includes no protocol changes therefore compatible with PocketMine 1.3.9.\n. Can we please see the dump file?\n. Is the max players setting set correctly?\n. Thanks!\n. If you are behind a router, the IP needs to be the internal IP of the network, and 127.0.0.1 if you are running it behind a reverse proxy.\n. Is it possible to make another pull request but WITHOUT any multi language stuff? (hard coded strings).\n. There is no \"automatic-crash-inducer\" implemented in PocketMine if that is what you mean. Like 99leonchang said, it could just simply be their connection.\nThis will probably be fixed with general stability rewrite in 1.4.\n. Please submit the \"Error_Dump_Fri_Nov_22-07.33.19-AZOT_2013.log\" file.\n. Merged. Thanks!\n. You can already set custom data values.\nWe will be looking to improve the API for performance and more standardised format, and we will add new events in the process of that.\n. @kvwang98 Voil\u00e0! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both victim and villian by the vicissitudes of Fate. This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished. However, this valorous visitation of a by-gone vexation, stands vivified and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition. The only verdict is vengence; a vendetta, held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous. Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose, so let me simply add that it's my very good honour to meet you and you may call me sekjun.\n. @kvwang98 The whole point of this PermissionsAPI is that events can be blocked without having to use the incomplete event and return false system. Plugins will still handle all the permissions. This API simply offers a simpler way for plugins to implement that, by doing $player->permissions[] = new EventRestriction('player.flying');. I am all against intruding plugin developers' territory, which is why I am making this API as abstract as possible.\nSorry for the confusion.\n. Sorry, but the flat generator doesn't need mineshafts.\n. The problem is probably originating from one of your plugins. PocketMine\ndoesn't have the system to detect which plugin it comes from yet, so you\nwill have to find it by trial and error.\nIf the problem persists, keep us updated.\nKind Regards.\n\nUsing Opera's mail client: http://www.opera.com/mail/\n. Seems like a reoccurring problem. We will have a look into it.\n\nOn Sun, 01 Dec 2013 05:06:39 +1030, must-lleibl notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nsigns is vanishing when you resterting the server in 0.8.0 build 4.

You can use git if you have the PHP binary.\n. @shoghicp The checking key is turned to case insensitive, but the actual Config is still in case-sensitive format. exists() notices the case difference and returns false. Fixed that now.\n. Looked at the code, but I can't find any references to potatoes. It could be a MCPE issue or @shoghicp Have a look at this.\n. spawn- options only allow spawning of mobs with spawn eggs. PocketMine does not yet support automatic spawning of mobs.\n.

I'll leave this to @shoghicp since this alters PM internals.\n. Do you have any other instances of PocketMine running?\n. That is a plugin issue.

Please re-open this issue if this is persistent.\n. This happens sometimes with 1.3. It is fixed with 1.4.\n. You could make a plugin that attaches to all commands(e.g. \"command.console\") and then echo the command to console.log. And when the server ends, you could check console.log for the last executed command logged by the plugin.\n. This feature will be omitted for now, as mixing an object with functions with ArrayAccess probably reduces code legibility. Maybe in a future revision.\n. Thanks!\n. The title has been edited to lower case. I will look into this issue.\n. This issue has been fixed with 9644088b5d7d980b7ef2a15f45e49b771c167ffd.\n. This is a bug already reported, which 1.4 should fix.\n. @shoghicp Did you update the RPi compile script to 5.5.9+?\n. Closed as this seems like a duplicate.\n. Just putting it here so other people also have an idea of what we're doing. I suggest we do this for all new features :)\n. This will be in Beta 2 as you can see in the milestone. You can visit crashdump-automatic-report branch to see the progress.\n. Re-assigned to @shoghicp as he already has a working prototype.\n. Please recompile PHP to the latest version, that should fix the issue. (PHP 5.5.9+, which is default with the latest compiler)\n. This is not a general support forum. For help on setting up PocketMine-MP please visit http://forums.pocketmine.net/\n. Please refer to this issue for future discussions. https://github.com/shoghicp/BigBrother/issues/5\n. I'm going to try to reproduce the problem. Looks like if the directory contains whitespaces or periods the issue may occur.\n. Thanks @spencersteiner. This issue is now marked as Confirmed/Reproduced.\n. I have debugged PocketMine-MP, and this issue is happening because \\Phar::isValidPharFilename is not accepting filenames such as C:\\Users\\Michael Yoo\\Documents\\Development\\Projects\\PocketMine\\Builds\\#228\\PocketMine-MP . 14 test environment mc 090\\plugins\\DevTools_v1.8.0-4c37f602.phar. As reported, if the . between PocketMine-MP and 14 is removed, everything works as expected.\n. I have just confirmed this issue to only happen on Windows machines. On Ubuntu 14.04 x64, this issue does not occur.\n. Turns out that Phar::isValidPharFilename is very unreliable. Some test results can be seen here: https://gist.github.com/sekjun9878/ac7f65124b0892da043e. There is no obvious pattern for the function to fail, and files get loaded successfully even without passing the check (I have tested it - removed the check and plugins got loaded fine.) Therefore, I have removed that check and the plugin loader should still fail WITH an error message(this bug didn't even show an error message!) if the path is not valid.\n. I don't think this is needed, and plugin developers should create their own Explosion object?\n. This issue is now marked as Confirmed/Reproduced.\n. This is a known issue as recognised on the pre-release draft, and PocketMine does not support LevelDB world format yet.\n. 1.3 is not maintained anymore, and we have moved our full focus on to the release of 1.4 for 0.9.0 support. Please ask around our forums for general support on 1.3.\nThe issue seems to be related to one of your plugins, or another program using a same address and port.\n. This happens because our master source doesn't include RakLib as it is hosted on a separate repository for management purposes. Please use our .phar instead.\n. For general support, please visit our forum. This is only for bugs, not support requests.\n. Please visit our forum for general support.\n. Thanks! Shouldn't there also be a LAVA_TICK event?\n. @Humerus has confirmed that this function is not documented on the PHP Documentation, but still exists (The degree of my facepalm cannot be written in words).\n. Could you please provide more details as to how to reproduce the issue? If we can't reproduce it, we can't debug it.\n. I'm pretty sure that is the intended effect of cancelling the PlayerPreLoginEvent. What exactly is the bug?\nAlso, please continue discussion of the \"two player loading screen freeze\" bug in #1636.\n. Your server is running out of memory trying to load the world. Increase the memory limit and you should be good to go.\n. Looks more like a router latency / Wi-Fi interference than a bug in PocketMine to me. Anyways, unless you have steps to help us reproduce this problem this is a support request and should go to our forums.\n. XP :(\n. The issue is happening because of https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/blob/master/src/pocketmine/command/defaults/SpawnpointCommand.php#L69-L71. The console does not have a coordinate value, therefore the $x, $y and $z values are not set. We will release a fix soon.\n. Could you please re-test with dc4bb54?\n. Attaching Mojang tag as this may be related to Mojang's client and attaching Reproduced tag as many people are reporting this issue.\n. Attaching Mojang tag as this may be related to Mojang's client.\n. Is there an official guide somewhere recommending to run PM as root? It is discouraged to run any user land service as root. Make sure your permissions are correct.\n. The map sending problem is a known bug and requires Mojang to fix their client. Closing this issue.\n. Hello Tander101,\nThe latest 1.3 release Amai Beetroot was a final release for 1.3, meaning there is to be no revisions to the 1.3 source code. (That means at this point we cannot fix the bugs in 1.3.)\nWe are going full gear with stabilising 1.4 and getting it ready for a stable release, and when that is done 1.3 will be deprecated. This bug should not exist in Zekkou Cake and later revisions.\nPlease try our 1.4 beta build.\n. Please refer to this issue on the PocketMine-Android repository.\nhttps://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-Android/issues/8\n. Ugh, I meant to create a milestone...\n. Please continue discussion on the BigBrother repository. https://github.com/shoghicp/BigBrother/issues/9\n. Closing this issue as it is not a bug.\n. https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\nI believe this is a duplicate and has already been temporarily fixed.\n. https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. Possibly related to #1592?\n. Ugh, happened again... I swear I clicked on the New Milestone button :/\n. Must be? Why is that?\nEDIT: It's not like /status contains confidential information\n. This bug will be solved by adding an option to enable /status in the installer script, but will be disabled by default to conform to MC default commands. \n. Too slow :P\n. Quoting @shoghicp:\nthat's pocketmine setting all the light to 15\n(no light population yet)\n. Please include more detail.\nLook at our contribution guidelines before posting a bug report.\n. A Windows memory leak bug has been fixed as can ben seen in this tweet: https://twitter.com/shoghicp/status/508918945228013568. Please check the status of this bug again and reopen if the issue persists.\n. Yeah well, this was last reported Jul 27. Could've been helpful if you provided some comment.\n. This issue does not happen in the latest build #588. I have tried both 'ko' and 'zh' and \"Enter\" and all of them return the correct language response. This issue is now closed as it is invalid.\n. @PEMapModder Is that your PC System Banner? You could reproduce this on Windows?\n. So this issue is not specific to Linux...\n. After testing, I've found this bug to exist only in the .phar distribution formats. I've tested the latest git clone, along with build #828 (phar), and the issue only happens on the phar version. This is on the same system, Windows 8.1.\n. The issue here is that PHP's glob() does not work with streams. Inside a phar, it will try to glob inside a phar:// - which will fail silently since glob doesn't support phars. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8203188/unexpected-problems-with-php-phar. \n. Editing title to better suit issue.\nOriginal: Blocks placed will be invisivle after loging back in\n. Doesn't look like this has been reproduced yet. Closing issue. Please reopen if you come across this again.\n. No. I find it easier to work with tabs rather than spaces. Quote StackExchange: \"IDE default FTW - just press the tab key and see what happens\" and \"having to constantly hit left left left left to go over one indentation\"\n. Update: Reason for change and relevant discussion: https://botbot.me/freenode/pocketmine/2014-09-20/?msg=22014352&page=2\n. Oh, and the offending commit was meant to be to a different branch but @shoghicp accidentally pushed it to master :P\n. @Humerus Please make sure that you use either Yes or No to signify your vote, unless you explicitly don't want yours to be counted.\n. Just a note, please do not turn this RFC into a flame thread. All we need are Yes and No votes and 7 days and this will be settled democratically :) Discussion can be done on IRC #pocketmine.\nAlso, @shoghicp and @Humerus your votes are currently not counted. Please fix unless you explicitly want otherwise.\nAnd, an announcement on the fourms and twitter may be appropriate to let plugin developers know. We want this to be as democratic as possible.\n. Also, I would like to note that after this RFC has been passed, a gitattribute should be set to force indentation type similar to newlines.\n. As of 28 September 2014 0932 hours, this RFC closed. The voting period has ended with a resolution of NO.\n. The new label should be \"PR: RFC\" and not \"PR: Request for Comments\" because of the limitation in our labelling standard: Note: For future reference, labels must not be longer than 15 letters.. This is because if the label goes longer than 15 letters, it gets truncated on GitHub web view :)\nEDIT: Hmm.. PR: Contribution doesn't seem to but it's still very close to the truncation limit. (So maybe it is 16 including spaces?)\n. I have this as a basic guideline. Note that it's still a WIP. https://gist.github.com/sekjun9878/6a0d2406b0c13fda9a63\n. You know what, this isn't necessary. The current dynamic / flexible way is good enough. Reopen this when this becomes necessary.\n. Tested on my local Windows 8.1 Pro machine, works fine. It correctly reverts to IP-based when data is not available, and falls back to UTC correctly.\n. Note: This change introduces:\nReliable Windows native timezone detection\nReliable Linux/Mac native timezone detection\nIf the above native detections fail, PocketMine reverts to IP Geolocation based timezone detection.\nIf the IP Geolocation based detection also fails, PocketMine uses UTC and displays a warning message.\n. Could this be related to fae330d499e705aac902e3750b089d7744acf1e0? Can you try testing the same thing with this commit applied?\n. Alrighty then\n. Title title didn't highlight the issue, so I'll move it here. This PR will solve #2002.\n. Actually, the Fertilisable should be changed to a trait and plants should extend Plant. I'll make a commit soon with the changes.\n. @shoghicp There's no question in your RFC (What's the Yes and Nos in response to?) :P I'm going to clarify the original RFC.\nThe question is: Should PocketMine-MP contain the feature to auto update itself?\nNote that this implementation of the feature will not make it the default. You must provide your own opinion as to whether or not auto-update should be turned on by default.\nSo, an example response should be:\nYes, however it should be disabled by default(or enabled by default)\nor\nNo, (default value can be omitted as the feature will not be implemented)\n. No. A proper argument.\nWe can't keep coding all these disabled-by-default \"features\" into PocketMine-MP. We need to draw the line between what should be the main software and what should be plugins.\nThe achievement notification for one, should have been done inside a plugin.\nRemember, you can edit your votes ;)\n. @HmHmmHm You should see the other one.\n. ... You can't be serious right now.\n. If you have time, that would be great. Is the y coordinate outputted on the response message the coordinate you want?\n. @MobileCrafter If you were on Windows, #2287 was the issue that caused the problem. It has been fixed (just a few hours ago). I'll promote the new build as Development soon.\n. Can you maybe rebase your commits into one commit?\n. Good catch!\n. Note: This will break backwards compatibility?\n. @PEMapModder Thanks for pointing that out\n. Could you detail and clarify your issue a bit?\n. Ah I see. I'll modify the title to: Abruptly disconnected client results in corrupted player file\n. @TruDan Would you be able to post here the an example of such corrupted player file?\n. @shoghicp Alright, that's great then. I'll assign you on the issue.\n. Wut\n. SteadFast and PocketMine are two different projects, branching off at the same 1.3 codebase but one is re-written from complete scratch and the other is modified to work with newer protocols. Because they are two different codebases, they are not compatible and cannot be merged.\n. uname -a: Linux WebServer 2.6.32-29-pve\nProxmox VE!\nAnyway you're running out of 4GB (!) and you're trying to allocate another 1GB(!!!). Are you trying to load an extremely huge world or something? Or is this a PocketMine memory leak?\n. You're running out of memory, both RAM and swap. The kernel has killed the process to reclaim the memory... Unless you have a lot more memory than 1GB?\n. Firstly, this is not a support forum, and the above is not a bug. Secondly, I'm guessing that the WARNING message is the problem here? If so, you can get the packaged version of PocketMine-MP at pocketmine.net. If the problem still persists, please reopen this ticket.\n. The two types are DEFAULT and FLAT (from memory). You can add more generators, and you can specify them there. Closing as this is a question.\n. There is no way for us to be more secure than we already are, in terms of preventing ban evasion. An IP ban is the strictest type of ban a server program can do, and if that doesn't work, you'll have to use a plugin to enhance security.\n. Your server is running out of memory due to chunks loading. Allocate a bit more than 256MB.\n. No problem!\n. Um, do you have a link to the crash dump as reported by our automatic crash reporting system?\n. That is my thought as well. In fact, @N0de13 Try your server with spawn-protection set to 1 or 0 and see if this issue still persists. If it does, then please re-open this issue.\n. This looks good @shoghicp\n. I guess the cause is obvious. Most likely not a PM issue but it could be PM failing to clean up properly in some situations.\nWhat programs are you running in the background? Any file intensive software?\nWhat is the output of ulimit -n?\nAlso can you post your crash dump here? Or alternatively, the crash ID.\n. I don't like the sound of globally catching Exceptions... @PEMapModder Care to explain the difference on workflow between the current code base and your fork?\n. YES. The Alpha tag was redundant for a long time now with PM getting survival support a long, long time ago.\n\nI personally think that the semantic versioning system should be replaced by a build system, like @InusualZ said. There is already a semver for the Plugin API, which allows for a PocketMine (not API) versioning change like this to be feasible, without major disruption.\nFor example,\n- Stable for 0.10.2\n- Stable for 0.10.2 Patch 1\n- Beta 2 for 0.11\n- Beta 1 for 1.2 Patch 4\n- Development Build #1024 (Builds that are promoted from Masters that are stable enough for plugin development)\n- Master Builds (tracks master, with the version being the hash of the latest commit)\nInstead of a versioning system that is not relevant with current Minecraft versions, I believe that the versions should be relative to the MCPE builds such as a Stable and Beta version for each MCPE version, and the Dev and Commit builds that just track master.\nHowever I digress. This is a topic for another discussion. I write this so I don't forget :)\n. We do not support PocketDock here. Please re-open this issue if your issue is isolated to PocketMine.\n. To phrase that easier, you can either forward the requests directly to us using our IRC channel, or code it yourself and make a pull request.\n. Now the real question is: When will 1.5 be released? xD\n. Hmm.. interesting. If the player is dead then you should kick the player otherwise he could just respawn? Or is the respawn blocked somewhere\n. Issue seems solved. Closing.\n. What do you mean by \"doesn't work achievement\"? Is this a crash or a game play issue?\n. Please remove the extra newlines before this can be considered for merge to master.\n. Closed as this is not a pull request.\n. Duplicate of #2532.\n. You can download the latest version of PocketMine from pocketmine.net. For further questions please visit our IRC channel or our forum.\n. System load and CPU time utilisation are different metrics. Closing issue as invalid. Please reopen if issue persists.\n. Sounds like a RakNet issue. Please report this issue here https://github.com/PocketMine/RakLib/issues. \nEdit: With detailed player data!\n. Sounds like a duplicate of #2532. Please reopen if there are significant differences. If not, please continue discussion on #2532.\n. Duplicate of #2768 as that issue is more broad in scope. Please continue discussion there.\n. How about putting all the Error Events under pocketmine\\events\\plugin\\error instead of just on pocketmine\\events\\plugins with everything else?\n. Please see #2786.\n. Okay, so the type problem is happening because the whole Config class is an (implicit through magic methods) ArrayAccess. When the Config file is reloaded, the reload script unset's the $this->type. After reload, the load script tries to assign a value to $this->type. Apparently, unsetting a defined class variable in an ArrayAccess causes it to get deleted from the class's method list, making the assignment inside load() get put into the $this->config instead through the Config ArrayAccess magic methods.\n. Please see https://botbot.me/freenode/pocketmine/2015-03-21/?msg=34701880&page=1 for an interesting story of how this bug was introduced. An unfortunate combination of unset() and = true and ArrayAccess.\n. :) No problem! This should be fixed when my PR gets merged.\n. Ahaha good find!\n. Please file this bug report at https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-Soft\n. Could you please clarify how this is a problem? By convention the folder name should be the same as the level name.\n. @PEMapModder can you rebase your commits so that you are not editing the PocketMine-MP header snippet? The current diff is adding and removing spaces on the header.\n. Duplicate of #2585.\n. @shoghicp Please confirm that this change will not affect any other parts of PocketMine and let me know\n. Hello, I have test this patch however this patch only seems to affect the first (the lowest) block of sand, and not anything above it.\n. Haha yes :)\n. Upon retesting, it works as expected. Whoops!\n. Please ask questions in either our forum or our IRC channel.\n. Do you like, spend all day going through PM source or something\n. Ha :) CallbackTask is an internal class, and shouldn't be used by plugins. All tasks by plugins should extend pocketmine\\scheduler\\PluginTask. If you want to use closures, you will need to make a subclass of PluginTask - something like this which is what I'm using:\n``` php\n<?php\nnamespace CakePowered\\Agent;\nuse pocketmine\\plugin\\Plugin;\nuse pocketmine\\scheduler\\PluginTask;\nuse pocketmine\\utils\\PluginException;\n/\n * Class PluginCallbackTask\n * @package CakePowered\\Agent\n */\nclass PluginCallbackTask extends PluginTask\n{\n    / @var callable $callable */\n    private $callable;\n/** @var array $args */\nprivate $args;\n\n/**\n * @param Plugin $owner\n * @param callable $callable\n * @param array $args\n */\npublic function __construct(Plugin $owner, callable $callable, array $args = []){\n    parent::__construct($owner);\n\n    $this->callable = $callable;\n    $this->args = $args;\n}\n\npublic function onRun($currentTick)\n{\n    if(call_user_func_array($this->callable, $this->args) === false)\n    {\n        //TODO: Detailed error message\n        throw new PluginException(\"Could not run PluginCallbackTask\");\n    }\n}\n\n}\n```\nEdit: Maybe not being able to use Closures internally is problematic?\n. Hmm alright, will fix it.\n. @shoghicp I think that CallbackTask should be able to accept Closures for future internal ephemeral PM tasks - and that its a broken feature.\nIf it isn't going to be fixed, there should at least be a check on CallbackTask __construct to see that the callable is not a Closure.\n. @shoghicp I'm not trying to say anything about plugins staying loaded after it disables... I'm simply saying \"Callback\"Task doesn't accept Closure callbacks so it should either be fixed or parameter checked beforehand so we don't get that ambiguous error message.\n. Okay then, whatever you see fit. I assume you already have changes in mind for 1.5.\n. Duplicate of #2842, please refer all future replies to #2842 instead. Thanks!\n. Duplicate of #2842. Please refer all future replies to #2842 instead. Or, reopen this issue if this issue only happens to the wooden pickaxe. Thanks!\n. The /kill command also clears your hotbar, so this is the desired behaviour. Please reopen this issue if you believe otherwise. Thanks!\n. Merged with 388f5c2c91219120dedc8d91b0afa79d1a30fe13. Thank you!\n. @shoghicp The BC can be fixed by https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/compare/master...sekjun9878:fix-flowers-bc which adds stub classes, and the additional stuff can be added with further commits :)\n. It seems that when the armour disappears, it always also drops the item slotted in the last slot of the hotbar. Not sure if this is an MCPE issue.\n. There isn't enough information for us to reproduce this problem. Please post the exact steps that we can use to reproduce this issue, and then reopen if this is still an issue. Thanks!\n. To be honest I don't think the Task should be injected at all. That should be controlled by the main plugin. Plugins can use use() and $this if they want access to the original scope anyway.\n. IMHO I would say make it as simple as possible and remove both ticks and the Task object. CallbackTask is there for simplicity. It's not there to be a full replacement of creating your own Task.\n. Would you be able to run rebase on the commits so they are one? So the commit history doesn't get 6 new commits. Also, @shoghicp ready for your confirmation then merge\n. @shoghicp if you actually look at the code the ticks have been removed and the owner is now quite clear since it extends PluginTask. This isn't the original CallbackTask anymore.\n. This is solved by anonymous classes in PHP 7.\n. Merged with adc5aa11ac26ae0668368f05dc01e19aae605b33. Thank you for the PR!\n. One issue for one issue submission please. The second one has been removed. Please create a separate ticket for that issue. This issue will now focus on the bedrock issue only.\n. The first pastebin is a duplicate of #2576. The last pastebin appears to be caused by SimpleAuth, please file an issue there. \n. Looks like this issue happens on Windows systems, where xdebug is enabled by default therefore xdebug's default max_nesting_level of 100 is imposed. As a temporary workaround, in the bin/php/php.ini file, you can follow this guide to increase the nesting level to something really high to avoid this issue. This issue is present on both the current stable, beta, and latest Jenkins Windows PHP binaries. We'll look into fixing it and close this issue once it has been resolved with the latest binary.\nThanks for reporting this issue!\n. Fixed with https://github.com/PocketMine/php-build-scripts/commit/633ea39e746acedc40e7e6465e3e5ebfb5c18f2d.\n. Standing on the side of the cactus does damage, however.\n. @shoghicp Didn't notice the missing version.\n. Hello, please refer to #3061 for your second issue, as duplicate issues in one issue are not allowed. Thanks!\n. Ah of course :/ ty\n. I agree, under normal circumstances this should be done with logrotate. However, it wouldn't hurt to have at least basic logrotating functionality built into pocketmine (which can be disabled in preference to other tools).\n. @shoghicp Want me to implement this?\n. Any other comments or opinions before this issue is closed for wontfix?\n. The current implementation is not a problem. The if statement conveys intentions better and better looking code is subjective. Closing ticket as this is a non-issue.\n. I agree that a simple solution is more concise and accessible than trying to tie this into an object.\n. Doesn't look like this will cause any problems and it's BC compatible, so I'm merging this. \n. Why?\n. Hello @AndreyNazarchuk, please continue discussion on our IRC channel if you want further discussion. This issue is a limitation of the MCPE client, and the PocketMine software in general follows what MCPE / MCPC / Bukkit does as convention. Which means there is nothing we can do to fix this issue. There may be a plugin to resolve this issue, however. Locking discussion as issue is not a bug.\n. Hello @china-richway2, the autoloader model is a very widely used concept in the PHP community and has been proven to be reliable. It is a limitation of PHP that classes are not unloadable, and not using an autoloader won't fix that problem.\nSounds like you have a problem with your Windows build, or with your own plugin. \nWhat you need to do:\nCould you please post me the build number / commit hash of the PocketMine version you are using, and the full code of the plugin you are using to perform this test and I'll debug this issue on Windows 8 x64 for you, and see if this really is an issue.\n. After further review, it's not PocketMine's problem. It's simply that you're trying to load an invalid class file and you're mistaking it for a memory full error. the segmentation fault error message is used for all PHP runtime errors, not just memory full errors.\nThose files you're trying to include are not meant to be included, and they are Work In Progress. Don't try to load all files next time :)\n. 1. What's the point of inheritance if you're just going to redeclare methods in child classes?\n2. Looks like you need an IDE to do some static code analysis because there are some code errors.\n3. Squash your commits! We don't want 30 commits for each file creation messing up our commit history!\nAnd I think @shoghicp probably has his own implementation in mind and boilerplate codes like this one don't really add any valuable features to PM. But thanks for contributing to the project!\n. In #3172, you posted the crash dump filename, without any of the contents in it... We can't really help you if you don't post the crash log. Also, please refer to our forums to confirm that this is a bug and not a misconfiguration on your phone(?) before making a bug report.\n. I fail to see how this is a bug. Does Vanila MCPE have a restriction on spawn locations like this one?\nBut this could also be implemented as a PocketMine.yml option\n. Yeah, those lines are there to separate between business logic and return value, but that double newline is weird.\n. Are you serious right now, this is starting to feel like Microsoft on their backward compatibility motto.. (oh wait! :P)\nExamples that this format is used in PC and will result in serious stuff braking?\n. sigh Why would you even make a commit with MBs with dots appended and Kb/s without a dot appended? This is a fix, not \"breaking backwards compatibility\"... I don't understand how an issue as critical as an unnecessary dot being appended taking up 4 extra bytes doesn't come across as an issue that requires IMMEDIATE fixing?!\nIt literally BURNS my eyes every time I run the status command, and I weep at the lack of uniformity between the lines how can you not see this as a problem it needs to be FIXED NOW!!!111\n. Whoops, I seem to have dropped this -> /s\n. @shoghicp Any update on this? It makes sense to drop the period.\n. Jesus, no need to be so defensive... How about 1.6 then? Thanks for your \"consideration\" regarding this matter.\n. Let me test this and see if this is an issue.\n. Well I couldn't determine what behaviour iron doors should take because it hasn't been implemented in MCPE client yet, so I'm going to assume that it should behave the same as a wooden door thus the current behaviour.\nBut of course, you can use a plugin to modify that behaviour if you wanted to.\n. ^ It is called inheritance.\n. Merging between branches of the PocketMine-MP Repository should only be handled by PocketMine Git Team Members. Closing Pull Request.\n. Thanks :)\n. Thank you @PEMapModder \n. Please see the PluginBase class at https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/blob/master/src/pocketmine/plugin/PluginBase.php.\n. From experience, this issue is not reproducible. Please let us know your server specs, test this on a performant server, and reopen if issue persists. Thanks!\n. Could it have been a network issue? Can anyone else confirm this bug on the latest dev build?\n. Sample code please? Possible link to #3346.\n. Sounds good. This won't break backwards compatibility because private and protected methods can't be called anyway.\n. Could you give me an example of what this is supposed to fix? #3330 doesn't give any examples and I don't deal with PM enough to know what problems this causes.\n. Just to clarify, this is a purely syntactic sugar change. This is estimated to break some plugins that incorrectly utilise some inherited Events, but that is an incorrect usage and not covered by the BC guarantee. \nThis check makes sure that there are no type hint errors by making it impossible to subscribe to Events that are a child of another event, but don't have its own $handlerList. \n@PEMapModder Add a nice little message and I'll merge this right away\n. Are you sure? Sample code?\n. @SkygridRex Please do not make meaningless posts or you may be permanently banned from our issue tracker.\n. @shoghicp No use reminding me of that, because I wouldn't know that this isn't a PocketMine bug.\n. Looks like an issue with the Windows 10 console? You can load the server with --disable-ansi to mitigate the issue meanwhile.\nActually why is colour displayed in Minecraft colour codes? \n. Paste it into start.cmd where the other \"--blah-bla\" are\n. Gotya, I'll look for changes\n. I've never had this bug on my Windows 8.1 system so I naturally thought it was a Windows 10 issue\n. Might be related to this: https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/commit/7cf5df7e4627dc31d4c042429a82e8604fc6bf0d\nBecause Build 907 was before that\n. Yeah, @shoghicp is moving Jenkins off my to be decommissioned server so some problems are to be expected\n. @sithsiri There must be something wrong with your setup. There's nothing that might break terminal display between builds 1257 and 1258.\n. Can you try downloading a fresh packaged version of PocketMine latest dev build inside a new folder, and see if that displays colour?\n. Well, whatever the problem was, it's not our problem anymore :P\nPlease refer to our forums for additional help.\n. Duplicate of #3357\n. Twitter redirect: http://paste.ubuntu.com/12028937/\n. It could be that they're inside the spawn protection when they join, and by the time you change gamemode they're outside the protection zone? Please test this and let us know.\n. Merging between branches of the PocketMine-MP Repository should only be handled by PocketMine Git Team Members. Closing Pull Request.\n. 1. Why is the Raklib submodule commit being changed?\n2. Please commit this in the Pull Request you already have.\nClosing issue as duplicate.\n. This is not a bug, there are people that do use this debug mode.\n. The change is unintuitive - surely there's a simpler solution. It could be something to do with the hardness setting and that is a single line change.\n. While you do make some good points, overusing inheritance is a common beginner mistake that makes code vulnerable to the \"fragile base class\" anti-pattern.\nThat's not the sole reason I rejected this (this change is needless) but I just wanted to let you know that inheritance is not always the right tool to use.\n. @willowmaster66 FYI that Inheritance in code should be based on something solid and specifically designed to be inherited from, not because it relates to real life.\nAlso, less layers of inheritance is a good thing. The less the better. After a few layers it just becomes a monstrosity of \"I don't know what part of the inheritance-chain this goes in\"\nI don't know if you already know this or not, but just wanted to rant :D\n. Sounds good. PHP doesn't check user-defined function parameters strictly so this should be BC compatible.\n. @SkygridRex Not really... Usually I just see some new PR on my GitHub feed, and respond to them so.. I'll look at the others when I have the chance.\n. And how does this help exactly?\n. @shoghicp There's no class that overrides the knockback function so I don't see what you mean by where \"some entities want to know the entity\" - the parameter isn't being used anywhere. \nFurthermore, PHP doesn't have strict parameter checking - child classes override not overload so there should be no BC breaks (as in, if child classes defined another knockback function with the previous signature, everything would work as expected).\nIf you're talking about this violating the substitution principle, that can be fixed with a few more argument checks.\nRight now, those two are completely unused so I thought it would be a good idea to remove them. After all, nobody likes to see a func(null, 0, $x, $y).\n. lol what\n. @64FF00 That doesn't follow the coding standards, and not using brackets is a code smell. Also, a shorthand if would work better in that case.\n. fsck. Sorry about the mailbox spam.\n@ZenaGamingsky While I'm sure you're genuinly eager to contribute to the PocketMine project, the patches you've provided us are unusuable. I've marked all of your PR requests invalid and closed. Please refrain from making PR requests in the future. Thanks for your consideration!\n. In if(in_array($player1,$this->red and $player2,$this->red)){\n$this->red and $player2 is a boolean expression, which is causing your bug.\nYou need to learn PHP to write plugins, because hacking snippets up is not going to make the expected behaviour. It's not English!\n. 'is a software for hosting'\n. May I ask why you need to append additional variables to the end? I feel that it makes things complicated for no real need.\n. This is not a valid PHPDoc comment. L194\n. Personally I wouldn't put two array brackets like that - it's not obvious that the array is supposed to be a list.\n. For example, this code should be indented.\n. Note: This really is BC compatible because of the func_get_args below. The warning message should be removed, however. Rather put a comment on the BC part saying why that exists there for future maintainers.\n. ",

I am also experiencing this, both in the stable and in the master branch. It seems to happen when a level is already loaded: if I use the SimpleWorlds plug-in to autoload a level when the server starts, the client will crash the first time the player is teleported to it.\nThis is very annoying since I have made a portal plug-in (the user is teleported if he enters the trigger zone), which is now useless.\nSome additional info:\nI'm using the server on Ubuntu 12.04 and the client on non-jailbroken iOS.\nI have tested this with\n- PM 1.3.3 + MCPE 0.7.2 alpha\n- PM 1.3.3 + MCPE 0.7.3 alpha\n- PM 1.3.4dev + MCPE 0.7.3 alpha\nand the issue exists on all three combinations. I also tried downgrading to PM 1.3.2, but then Minecraft wouldn't list the server; no idea why.\nBTW, only the client crashes, the server continues to run fine without giving any notice, which of course makes it harder to find out the cause of this problem.\n. maybe update to latest dev. and close the issue if this helped\n. I'm also seeing this issue still in 1.3.9 .. not always but a lot of the time.  Just now using a hoe to turn up some grass, I get one swipe and the hotbar is cleared, items are still in the inventory though, have to reload the hotbar.  One more swipe and it's cleared again.\n. this seems to happen with a lot of things but it is most likely a Mojang issue so try a) reporting to Mojang b) update to pocketmine dev. close the issue if this helped\n.

Uhhh choose who they like better of course but mobAI isn't in pocketmine yet so don't worry about it\n. reinstall apt-get install automake autoconf make gcc gcc-multilib libtool m4 perl bzip2\nif you failure install, i no know :D\nP.S - you are using VPS server?\n. but still it is a bug so if you use dev. world edit probably won't support it then what will you do\n. so this needs to be fixed out of world edit\n. @DarkIllusion96 what version of windows 7 is it that may help (8.0/8.1) (home premium, or ultimate)\n. @shoghicp @williamtdr \n. well try the new 1.3.12 dev. it might fix it\n. You wanna steal my idea? \n. version: 0.8.0 build3\n. yeah that's it download the latest dev. to fix more issues to do that just add the files to your pocketmine-MP server\n. the player object have a variable with the loaded level\n. @InusualZ No, I want to get all levels loaded. \n. Your friend dont have the same Minecraft Pocket Edition Version\n. When i use /say on a vanilla server, it shows [SERVER] instead of [$sender] \n. Why dont you just reinstall Linux on a VM and try run it on there?. well it's probably gonna be in 1.3.12 due to it being called minecart\n. so close the issue I guess\n. see this guide: https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/wiki/Setting-up-a-Server#wiki-linux\nI have installed PocketMine with it. I'm on Linux Mint 64 bit\n. Linux Mint 15, but i see the error.\n. I don't have any plugins yet and even the server name and IP changes go away\n. I saved it and PocketMine MP 1.3.10 I will try falkirks\n. I am not the best coder how would I do that exactly falkirks\n. wait just did it now it's responding this issue is now closed\n. why did you close this is it fixed?\n. version 0.8.0\n. lots of people keep duplicating this issue it is planned to be fixed in a future update\n. @pemapmodder Are you using the 1.4 dev.? \n. and no I have no plugins\n. what do you mean port forward\n. @DarkIllusion96 what do you mean port forward\n. oh wait now I know so this can close\n. yeah but still what if you don't have a chest\n. that too plus what if you don't have flint and steel\n. okay thx @99leonchang \n. no one really gives any care about this. so useless. ...\n. dev and I don't get it your Iphone/android has issues\n. maybe being idle too long\n. well there was pocketmine realms not mp\n. but pocket mine has plugins\n. but wait you only have an Ipod/Iphone/Ipad dude get a PC\n. then why do you need pocketmine on iOS\n. the what\n. so\n. wait your pc minecraft or pocketmine\n. then dude get help from mojang not here and I know it's not a forum\n. and I'm not a kid\n. okay now that is childish\n. I am 18\n. looks like a plugin error try deleting all worlds and plugin if that doesn't work re-install pocketmine\n. you are also using dev. most plugins don't work in dev. versions\n. do you have the plugin permission plus\n. yes exactly\n. is this a bug\n. but is it confirmed or not\n. okay thx every one\n. it started again so annoyed\n. @shoghicp can you please find the code soon\n. Check your server status.\n. port forward maybe\n. or being idle too long\n. because most of this code comes from minecraft so the server would crash due to that bug probably being in the code of pocketmine too\n. yeah same here just tried it so try re-installing pocketmine\n. or a chest\n. SimpelAuth Plugin error.\nYou can delete simpleauth.php or redownload simpleauth.\n. this I think is going to be fixed in 1.3.12 due to it being named Minecart so you can close this\n. try deleting all plugin if that doesn't work redownload pocket mine and update it to the dev version\n. I get that and I have latest version\n. dev version\n. also don't step on chests fences or walls that triggers it\n. or try the dev. maybe it's fixed there\n. I doesn't happen all the time\n. close the issue then\n. no it has to do with the physics and physics will be in 1.4 or beta\n. Yeah #1001 I think came before it\n. @bigjakk You are just wasting your hardware, just use a 8GB RAM server is enough. \n. You need to save the world before of closing it or just use the stop command\n. and I think it was fixed in the latest update\n. yeah I get that too and it's an official plugin\n. I get that too\n. did you allow it passed your fire wall\n. port forward maybe\n. that made no sense to me I am not a coder\n. which part\n. okay thx\n. Maybe, DroidPocketMine can read the world\n. is it LAN or Pocketmine-MP\n. so talk to Mojang we are only here for server problems\n. also I got another one [ERROR] A level 2 error happened: \"socket_bind(): unable to bind address [10048]: Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted.\n\" in \"C:\\Users\\Riysu\\Desktop\\PocketMine-MP (0.8.1)\\src\\network\\UDPSocket.php\" at line 35\n. and thx you last suggestion worked\n. hmm maybe try some different coding\n. it worked\n. okay thx\n. that looks like a plugin issue take out all your plugins delete your world and try again\n. also some api's don't work with citron plugins so maybe change you api \n. I think this is planned for a future update\n. There aren't even any mobs to hurt.\n. Okay he might have been playing tnt spleef with water underneath so he didn't destroy his world but it destroyed it or maybe he was trolling people\nFrom Riys\n\nOn Mar 28, 2014, at 1:10 AM, PEMapModder notifications@github.com wrote:\n@LukeDarling Why yes then? ;D\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n.

I think the error is here: \n(PocketMine-MP / src / pocketmine / wizard / Installer.php)\n(Line 46-54)\nPHP\ndo{\n    echo \"[?] Language (en): \";\n    $lang = strtolower($this->getInput(\"en\"));\n    if(!isset(InstallerLang::$languages[$lang])){\n        echo \"[!] Couldn't find the language\\n\";\n        $lang = false;\n    }\n}while($lang == false);\n$this->lang = new InstallerLang($lang);\nAnd here: \n(Line 212-216)\n``` PHP\nprivate function getInput($default = \"\"){\n    $input = trim(fgets(STDIN));\nreturn $input === \"\" ? $default : $input;\n\n}\n```\nEdit: I think trim(); or fgets(); made a mistake...\n. @PEMapModder Yes...\n. nvm... this only happens if your view is in third person. I guess this is an mcpe bug.\n. @shoghicp pls include the 3rd person pvp bug wherein if you are in the 3rd person view and you hit other player few times, client crashes. thank you!!\n. Actually, PHP 5.5.0 or higher version is required to run latest builds.\n. @sebagius7110 Are you using Windows btw?\n. \"When the user is connected,\nthe progress bar will not move\"\nI have the this Problem too\nbut its happend with the default World Gerator of Pocketmine\nBuild #496\n. its my plugin he is using and it is faulty atm. please close this issue @shoghicp \n. ASR? @tnpxxsheepdog \n. You can lock this thread btw.\n. the solution for me was to install the beta version then install the dev version again. i dont know why but it works xD\n. @HmHmmHm I think this is related with PocketMine-Android...\n. @shoghicp @HmHmmHm I think I should also take a look at that issue...\n. @shoghicp @HmHmmHm Getting timezone information from windows registry? Hmm...\n. @shoghicp What about allowing the installer to set default timezone?\n. no more break block glitch in parkour? awesome!\n. Build 509 crashes without any reason when players gets connected. ill submit a crash report\n. the pocketmine.net gave me the build509 instead of the new one. i didnt know that. sorry\n. to keep off players from glitching like in the PC servers :) finally, no more parkour glitch cheat.\n. it havent implemented yet.\n. its the memory of the device getting eaten up causing the app to crash. its mcpe devs fault for not patching it since day one xD\n. yea same issue.\n. Same happends when you walk on slabs\n. So if i collect a block, my inventory will got updated and all items will be show.\nHope this helps\n. the problem is not with ASR as ive retested. \n. same problem when the server is swarmed with many players.\n. @seria2 Isn't it $event->setCancelled(true) instead of  $event->setCanceled(true)?\n. @iksaku :D\n. Tested on my Root Server 500 mb Up\n. Its mostly happen when i switch my gamemode before\n. Tested it without switching my gamemode: But It happends again.\n. Yes.Im using Build #544\n. Hmm so i have a Sign, if a player tap on it he will get teleported to a another world and sometimes it works and he wont fell out the world. But if it worked for the first player, it wont work for the second one. And if the first or the seconds player fell out the world  he should have to reconnect or he will fell out the world (after respawning) \n. @tnpxxsheepdog mind sharing your server specs? you also need to know if your Server health is ok not only the PocketMine server.\n. I know about SSH, but the thing is doesn't the server terminate or something once you logout or X it out? Or are you talking about the program screen?\n. Ok thanks.\n. i reproduce this bug aswell. \n. yea \ud83d\udc4d\n. NO because the tabs usually doesnt change the code space if you are going to add // before the tab and its quite cleaner to look into it. i have been using spaces before and i quite agree its so messy to work with. if only PocketMine coding style likes to non-OOP which i guess doesnt xD\n. the freeze wont stop unless the one you went through moves. its quite buggy when you are in a crowded place where everyone stays at one place (spawn area) and its hard to get out when a lot is AFK at spawn.\n. finally ^_^\n. (url)\n. Can reproduce it\n. YES because its sooooooo very tiring to login to console, stop the server, place the new PocketMine-MP.phar everytime i want to update. with this, the server will just update itself without my presence, more hassle free :) and by default, it would be a No because if you dont like the future updates or it might break your server for various of reasons.\n. i agree with @dutok \n. Yes, this would make things easier on server owner's parts, such as me. I always make sure everything is up to date, but sometimes I can't keep up with the updates. This may be the case for others.\nI believe it should probably be disabled by default because there could be some beginning server owners where it would auto-update and then corrupt because they don't know how to update the binaries for example.\nMaybe if people don't like how it is implemented in the future (if it does get implimented), maybe there should be a separate public link (For Example: http://get.pocketmine.net/latest/pocketmine.phar) for people that want to make the automation process better with a custom script. Maybe another download to the version list so the custom script can't do the backwards-incompatible API change updates as explained in the first post.\n. Reproduced: 21:20:28 [INFO] Sulfatezz[/_.._::*] logged out due to Kicked by adm\nin. Reason: Flying is not enabled on this server\n. Same here. I guess it occurs when MCPE crashes immediately after connecting(NOT JOINING) to server.\n. @jython234 But this error message is unusal, just printing 'could not receive packet'. We don't have to know which client has crashed.\n- I've known this bug before...\n. so this would be a problem with the client? if so, tag this with the Mojang :P \n. its not device specific because I've tested on several devices, the same issue occurs. \n. i think build 728 is for 0.10.0 builds. if you want the builds for 0.9.5, check PocketMine.net as it shows the latest beta and dev build version.\n. Sorry.this issue close\n. there are no errors besides this. it just shows the error i posted above. so how would i suppose to fix this? i dont have any plugins thst uses RCON or whatsoever.\n. wow a quick fix xD\n. i confirm this fixed on latest commit :) finally. a more better stable dev build!!\n. @Georggi its fixed in my end. my server no longer crash. Plus use the latest build instead.\n. I get this on 791\n. And this Tile is invincible\n. Thanks\n. you have to restart your server once you have set your world spawn in order to take effect.\n. @shoghicp Thanks a lot :D\n. it spams my console with this:\n\n. yes\nbut you cal create limit world\n. @PEMapModder does this fix this? https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/issues/2335\n. @shoghicp Then you could fix the error message handling when receiving invalid packets. It messes console output and wastes disk resources to write console log.\n. @ns827 @shoghicp :+1: :D\n. Yes. I've tested it with both anvil and mcedit worlds. Does not work.\n. And more... Overall times, the PocketMine starts lots of chunks generations on where already have something made, my builds aways is destroyed because unneed chunks generations... I already tried to disable default PM generator but nope, it keep destroying my builds on PC ported maps.\n. I'll try, thanks\n. converted to McRegion, but nope, see there what's happening:\nhttp://javatech.mywapblog.com/files/screenshot-2014-12-21-16.png\n(Sorry for bad resolution, is a bug on my blog...)\nYou can see the chunk bug, and another one, my stone sword is selected but not appear in hand, the last two slots have this bug, but I dont know if this is PM problem, I think no...\n. This always happens with another maps also, and with both, Anvil and McRegion, I believe yes,  it is corrupted chunks... but it happens only few reboots later, it makes no sense for me... :/\n. i reproduce this bug aswell.\n. Just set server-ip blank and it will bind to 0.0.0.0:19132 automatically\n. Oh, I just saw that @MobileCrafter has already reported this issue. My fault. :(\n. Okay. Thanks! :)\n. I fixed DefaultCommands to go with the DeopCommand fix, and I also changed OpCommand\n. @PEMapModder Yay :D\n. we need this D:\n. @iksaku :+1: \n. me too. my TPS dropped from 10-15TPS to 1-5TPS.\n. i use PocketMine Soft. i reverted to older builds to fix the issue\n. @PEMapModder No one can beat me at all. I AM THE MOST USELESS SELF-TAUGHT PROGRAMMARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR\n. It seems like someone is sending invalid query packet, starting with 0xfefd.\n. @PEMapModder There's no @ in https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/blob/master/src/pocketmine/network/query/QueryHandler.php#L92 nor https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/blob/master/src/pocketmine/utils/Binary.php#L328.\n. @shoghicp I removed server.properties and pocketmine.yml than reconfigured the server, but server is still printing a message when getting a 0xfefd01 or 0xfefd09 packet.\n. I checked only createve mode.\nI want to you fix!\n. I can't place all blocks\n. Yes.Of course\n. i used developmentbuild 888 ,but seem bug....\n. Yes.of course.\n. cant place blocks and load \n. it doesnt fix the issue\n. on compile.sh: heres what ive noticed also, at the LevelDB part, it just ends up in compiling then the script dies:\n[LevelDB] downloading 3f7ad20ac551754bdc70c4e9929eff6b427a11ff... checking... compiling...root@vps:/root/mylittleponies\n. you should not change \"M\". for example, the default is 256M, it is not 256MB or 1GB. if you want to allocate 1GB, it should be 1024M and so forth ...\n. @shoghicp I see, so that's the reason why all my stuff in double chests were gone...\n. @HmHmmHm @UltimateMcraft @PEMapModder Just give it up, he's just a moron.\n. @Coccy  -.-\n. 15:09:00 [CRITICAL] Could not tick level world: Trying to get property of non\n-object\n15:09:00 [NOTICE] InvalidStateException: \"Trying to get property of non-object\"\n(E_NOTICE) in \"/src/pocketmine/Player\" at line 1095\n15:09:00 [DEBUG] #0 /src/pocketmine/Server(1938): pocketmine\\Server->tickProcess\nor()\n15:09:00 [DEBUG] #1 /src/pocketmine/Server(1663): pocketmine\\Server->start()\n15:09:00 [DEBUG] #2 /src/pocketmine/PocketMine(440): pocketmine\\Server->__constr\nuct(pocketmine\\CompatibleClassLoader object, pocketmine\\utils\\MainLogger object,\n string C:\\pocketmine\\, string C: \\pocketmine\\, string C:\\pocketmine\\\nplugins)\n. No**. You should replace this system with snapshot.

Could you make documentation for query and RCON?\nI self-studied how QueryHandler works but I couldn't get statistics with returned token...\n. @shoghicp Ah, I didn't think query and RCON is from existing protocol, just thinking they are new protocol by PocketMine. Sorry.\n. walking glitch can be fixed by using PocketMine-MP_Soft. download it and replace the old phar with the soft phar. run the server, let it generate pocketmine-soft.yml and edit it find check-movement, set true to false.\n. From personal experience (with PE and PC), this tends to be due to the server \"lagging\".\n. @shoghicp this is the bug i meant what i said on irc D: no need to duplicate issue :)\n. Did you check clients' network speed?\n. @shoghicp I didn't touch any configuration file for server. But do you think consuming 60MB of memory with loading a 1300KB sized level isn't a problem?\n. @PEMapModder https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/commit/c8b5c023cd066c20465b94627f10d8612f375150\n. I think that there is no stable version of 1.4. there is beta build\n. i get this bug too.\n. Sorry for bad english :)\n. it would be nicely to know what kind of level type did you use? mcregion, mca, or leveldb?\n. so what would be the solution @shoghicp \n. @3do2 i have made a temporary solution to this issue. https://github.com/iJoshuaHD/ASR-Screen-Listener its not that accurate but helps. this is useful until a solution for this matter is settled.\n. @Alcatraz-Du blame your plugins installed thats not present in the pocketmine plugin repo.\n. 13 players without freezing is reasonable -,- try hosting 30 or more and lets see what happens with more plugins\n. it happens from time to time. well idk why this happens.\n. ic. i hope there would be item duplication protection in the future soon! a new feature in the anti cheating protection. im closing this issue.\n. im reopening the issue. i just figured out what the bug is.\nPlayers duplicate items using chest and some timings. for instance, i do some automation server restarts and i broadcast messages when the server will have its next reboot hence here comes the born of the glitch. Lets assume the server has ASR installed and the server will restart for the next 30 seconds. players would put their items in chest and wait for the 10 secs countdown to start. when it starts, they would grab their items in chest and wait for the server to stop. When the server starts, the item they removed in the chest was still present in the chest even though its been removed.\ni did some tests with and without auto restarts. i put my item in a chest, removed it. restart the server and the item is still there even though i have removed it. now i have a duplicated item.\n. I tested that glitch running pocketmine server, it doesnt work like the single player.\n. bravo @mightysun99 :) \n. the bug still exist ...\n. Yup. Only client disconnect. Not being kicked\n. fixed the bug after reinstalling pocketmine php binaries. weird bug for me ...\n. :'(\n. :'(\n. I can confirm this.

Yes i tested it with the latest Build and it happends random.\n. But the player just light lit a fire and the fire disappeared, without a long click\n. But the player's spawnpoint is under the gruond. This is impossible because using /tp or /spawn can;t change the player's spawnpoint...\n. v0.8.1? O_o\n. I have the same issue:\n\n\nI did everything possible to solve this problem but nope... (Forget convert from Anvil to mcregion an vice-versa, this bug isn't related to it)\nMan, it will simply destroy your map completelly like my map... And my map have other major bug like these = massive tree generations... I got tree walls in every grass block in my server, basically i can't build anything more in my map, because every, every and EVERY time i need to rebuild overlaped chunks and cut off trees... Really a dedly error in pocketmine\n. Captured this morning:\n\n\n\n(--')\n. Hm, how this plugin works? It auto restore chunks after detect corruptions? Or i need to type commands to restore? Thx\n. :+1: \n. What did you do? did u edit something?\n. Nope, it's a bug... I got this trees only in some ramdom maps, when i restore a previous un-bugged map backup i got trees in another one... I simply don't understand what this happens... But i found a temporally solution =  i replaced grass blocks with green wools... (--')\n. Here you go\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/e7zhdumb7d1wgjt/Maps%20and%20Plugin%20list.zip?dl=0\n(I'll remove this link soon)\nInside this zip you got my world files and plugin list.\nI can't send for you my most recent World file, because it's on my VPS, and i can't download anything from there yet, \nBut this worlds can show you how is the bug.\nOne more thing, my most recent world have more than 12,000 mcr files with 4kb, i think PocketMine is generating McRegion files for every new chunk generated...\n\nIs that normal?\nThanks.\n. Hum, i'll investigate if really is my plugins that is generating huge ammount of files, but about trees, i already tested without plugins and got the same error... Go to position 78 68 155 on world PCBR, is the same positition where i take the first screenshot. \nIn this place you can see massive trees, try to cut off some trees and go far, when you return, the trees will be reborn...\n. Hm............ i really want a plugin like that!! can u tekll me this bug i want it for my server andf if its a plugi n tell em which one i wanna have it!\n. It's not a plugin, i confirmed that myself, the massive trees happens without any plugin on folder... I reproduced this issue on my old map by restarting and restarting the server few times, I got huge ammont of trees in just one region of map, probally a issue of the map itself, but on flat worlds it happens in every place, so, pocketmine issue, i think... And for huge ammount of files, I don't found the root of problem, i found that really is a plugin problem, i confirmed that, but when the plugin starts to generate this huge ammount of files, the pocketmine still doing the same thing after remove all plugins... Now my world folder have 16511 files and still increasing this number... But i don't know what is the bugged plugin\nAnd lucario, please improve your grammar, english is not my native language, so, is a little bit hard to understand what you're trying to say XD\n. The plugin that causes the huge ammount of mcr files problem is EssentialsPE... I tested all my plugins one per time to see what is the bugged one, and i confirmed without any trouble that is EssentialsPE the plugin that cause this worlds issues..  @iksaku see that\n. Actually. You think you know it? SORRY BUD! It is actually EssentialsPE fault. There is a little bit of coding in it that has massive tree generations, and something is apparently messing with it. \n. @PEMapModder i think he has the Console freezing bug too.\n. Go to your pocketmine folder and tweak your server.properties and pocketmine.yml, on server properties, increase the memory limit... In pocketmine.yml tweak this lines:\n[CODE]\n #Amount of chunks sent to players per tick\n per-tick: 2\n #Compression level used when sending chunks. Higher = more CPU, less bandwidth usage\n compression-level: 1\n #Amount of chunks sent around each player\n max-chunks: 56\nchunk-ticking:\n #Max amount of chunks processed each tick\n per-tick: 50\n #Radius of chunks around a player to tick\n tick-radius: 2\n[/CODE]\nThis is my pocketmine.yml, my computer with only 4 gb of ram is running the server with 120 slots very well with this cfg, but if you increase so much like this\n[CODE]\nAmount of chunks sent to players per tick\nper-tick: 16\n[/CODE]\nit will make your server slow down and stops from loading chunks with less than 10 players...\n. I meant 32% of cpu power not ram\n. I know, For example, increasing this value:\nMax amount of chunks processed each tick\nper-tick: 50\nTo 256, 512, whatever, will use more cpu power, this is the main option for use more power from cpu... Anyway you need to tweak your pocketmine.yml...\n. What distribuition you're using?\n. finally! now i dont have to hardcode this into my plugin :D \n. woot woot! \\o/\n. no, its not. i have tested it with and without plugins.\n. Happens even in latest stable build.\nUsing 1.4.1-980 for MCPE 0.10.5 alpha\n. :+1: Keep up the great work @HmHmmHm! Really love it <3\n. @shoghicp I wish I could, but I have midterms in a few weeks :'(\n. This is not the place to ask that question.\n. invisibility bug exists when a player1 came from a chunk that player2 isnt loaded.\n. the bug still exists.\n. mine is set to false.\n. ikr! im getting this aswell but the maximum was only 950MB for 15 players online D:\n. @PEMapModder yep. i think its with worlds. so far this only happens with PM1.5.\n. lime? Hehe\n. ok, thank you\n. ok, thank you\n. You will be removed from being able to contribute to this repository if you keep opening spam issues and not following the Contribution Guidelines. - @shoghicp \n. @64FF00 No, it doesn't!\n. This issue is invalid. Please follow the Contribution Guidelines (https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) when reporting issues for PocketMine. \n. @sarman2271 @Adrian101010 That's it. No more PurePerms releases for API v1.11.0. Waiting for the plugin update approval.\n. This may be something to do with minecraft itself. It does that to me sometimes in singleplayer.\n. Can you get out?\n. that is a plugins fault not the new build fault\n. Ok, Sorry :(\n. nop, im talking about normal biomes... not colors...\nHow I said, it also happens on not coverted mcregion worlds...\ncomplementing...\non old mcpe 0.11 pocketmine builds that bug doesnt happens...\nunfortunatelly i dont know in how build that started to happens... bug if you want, i send these worlds folder for you... i think is better see with your eyes what is the issue\n. ok, I understand... thanks for your time and keep your good work!\n. hah! here's my two cents! same issue!! :O \n. @shoghicp try adding a capital letter in your name :P\n. Yeah, its randomly happening! sometimes when my server restart, (because of memory leaks, cpu usage, annoying lag) my spawn protection doesnt work, and not only the default one, plugins that protect areas also stops working, maybe a API function related to protect blocks, wont load properly at startup?\n. I figured that now every thing related to protect blocks from being grieffed by players isn`t working for me...\nthis happened before, but a reboot fixed that, now, i had to shutdown my network for try to solve this...\nwell, my hub server have a longer default spawn protection (10000 blocks for be exactly, yep, there is no need for that, but...) and i use iProtector for a extra security, but it also isn`t working...\nI removed the default pocketmine.yml and server.properties for test without lucky, downgraded pocketmine to build 1223 with no result, removed some plugins such pureperms and another plugins that maybe be related to it, nope... and finally removed the whole plugin folder and the issue still there.\nthats soo strange, started to happens from nowere and i cant revert this o.o maybe there is a pocketmine bug... ill try to do a clean reinstall of pocketmine and test if this will happen again after some time.\n. Looks really awesome. Gonna be looking forward to entity AI.\n. WOW!!!\n. @shoguicp I can confirm that this is a pocketmine bug.\nsome levels, when you try to unload it, wait for that and then load again, when a player try to teleport to this reloaded world it will crash the server with the infamous getChunk() on null\n(on my tests every level that have the spawn coordinates on the same or nearby coordinates of the default level)\nI can't figure out what's causing that, if is a unclosed entity, if the loadLevel() are not loading anything so getChunk() fails, or if this is a player load issue...\nThat's not a level issue because I've tested with pocketmine-generated levels and I also got the crash, and getLevel() are returning true...\nso, I think this need to be checked :/\ncheers\n. try deleting the map and generate a new map again\n. Oops... Sorry, The last one is a mistake.\n. It is already been reported. (#3229)\n. It is already been reported. (#3229)\n. Duplicated issue\n. a better explaination\nThe PocketMine (or mcpe) coordinates is a bit \"displaced\" in relation with the blocks in the world, like this:\n\nthis way, the players can stand above four blocks at same time, but for pocketmine the player will be  above one block.\nthat affect directly minigames that need to know player's exact location for doing things like removing player's ground...\n. oh, so this is not a pm issue, and is not a issue...\nbut it's hard for a recently joined plugin developer to 'discover' these small things by himself...\nanyway I think we need to take 0.5 instead of add, atleast this way my project worked better\nbut pocketmine still needs a way to calculate player's coordinates based on the percentage of the player's body above certain block... \n. shovels also have this bug when breaking snow blocks, the block breaks instantly but reappear again, \nand Haste effect and anything supposed to instantly break blocks in survival mode aren't working, exept handling an event and setting the block to air, but when you do it, the blocks only update for the player that breaked it, only happens in multi-world..\n. @PEMapModder Mmmmmmmmm\n. You dont need delete {name}.dat you most reload your server\n. @thebigsmileXD i think your code realy doesn't for the people have a skin based in steve\n. Ok AI wasn't implemented (do you know what is AI?) AI allows all mobs the posibility to move so you are saw the mob in  (for example) x he is in  z\n. Hey you can solve this closing and reopening your mcpe client\n. Im thinking your issue dont have solution talk about it to shogui\n. Do you break or touch the pumpkin?\n. Try use pocketmine 1.6 (The big Fail) you cant craft anymore xD \nDownload\nhttps://transfer.sh/1fzA3N/pocketmine-mp-1.6dev.phar\nPS: dont use Creative doesnt work xD\n. @sekjun9878 Ok no problem!\nNo hard feelings?\n. @sekjun9878 i forgot \nCan fix Amor.PHP? \n. @iksaku Pienso que hay que hacerle un pocketmine especifico para desactivar el evento de crafteo\n. I went here using /tp xD\n. Do /tp 100000 100 100000\n. You could just make a commit....\n. Its not an issue with the php verision. I had this error for a while\n. Search in pocketmine forum the ASR plugin.\nThis plugin can help you because pocketmine always crash (i dont know why pocketmine is unnestable after 2-3 hours) with this plugin you can reload the server to get some memory for pocketmine and say bye to memory leak\n.

OMG!!! update to PM 1.5 :v\n. You can fix it diwnloading this plugin\nhttps://github.com/SaiCoDev/TruFix\n. Are you using pocketmine soft or develoment build?\nAnd what is DOOM?\n. Update to PM 1.5 and close your issue\n. Pocketmine have some issue codes, it's not complete some blocks and items don't have code\n. Look this #3370 and close your issue\n. Do in the console \"op (yourplayername)\"\nPS: close your issue\n@PEMapModder help the people \n. @PeMapModder i want to help people it's my problem\n. You are trying to connect with ip 0.0.0.0 and this an invalid ip \nYou most to find your own ip of your server for example 192.168.0.26\n. @TahaTheHacker port forwarding its not needed he most to find your own private ip not public ip\n. Increase the memory to pocketmine\n. Are you using linux?\n. If you want try with other linux version. yay\n. To increase the memory size edit the file \"pocketmine.yml\" and look this #3370\n. Also happens on 1.6 when the player eat a golden apple...\nWell, probally that will be solved when 1.6 got official support, \ud83d\udc4c\nbut \u2191 that is a big problem :/ we don't want that the player click on the \"Main Menu\" and never more come back to the server, lol\n. Are you changed some code?\n. shogui said's don't report issues from PocketMine 1.6 it's under-develoment\n. Like\n. Increase the memory size\n. Remove all plugins by DarkGod\n. Are you using windows?\n. Pocketmine API has been changed those tutorials doesn't work\n. But, can you add chunckcache too?\n. Delete line 55 \n. @willowmaster66 for me this change it's ok\nDuplicate code it's a bad practice because can be make conflict\nBecause of this i don't give stars to pocketmine\nWhat it's the problem with a simpler solution?\n. Bahhh! Bad change\n. I see preference for some users (like a PeMapModder)\n. This is a issue tracker not a forum close your issue\n. read this #3403\n. Im not using linux please ask to a linux user\n. are you using pocketmine-mp or droidpocketmine?\n. i think the download link it's down\n. i don't know when the download link will be back and the pocketmine team first work on a develoment build and later work on pocketmine-soft, so, you need to wait a long time\n. Are you using the same values of RedstoneOre.php?\n. You can change this on php.ini\n. can you give me the config files of pocketmine.yml?\n. You have a problem with the memory\nRead this #3370\n. @PEMapModder hello my torment\n. after 24 hours, i have over 500+ crash dump files regarding this.\n. If you have colour in your name it will this error.. I've summarized #3495\n. Lol!

Yes\n. @shoghicp I think that this was solved with the implement of 'Faster-Network' branch\n. this is a pocketmine bug, it will be fixed soon... I guess\n. Hm... do you have a good internet? I think this occurs because your internet connection is slow\n. This occurs because your internet is slow or because you are far to your internet router\n. ok... first you need to know this: when you change your gamemode, you will need to reconnect to your server. This is not a bug, this is a requirement because you can change your gamemode like PC\n. but /spawnpoint and /spawn point are for changing the spawn for the issuer only, like when you sleep on a bed\n. Animals and monsters can't spawn automatically at this time, but you can spawn animals on creative mode, but they will be freeze, you can kill them and get their drops :D\n. :/ I don't know what do you try to say, but if your server is intended to be on creative only... you will need to edit server.properties and change defaultgamemode=0 to defaultgamemode=1\n. I guess that this is a lag problem, because I had this problem when I'm far from my internet router ( it causes lag for me :P )\n. Lag...\n. I think that this happens because you have \"Hardcore\" mode enabled in server.properties\n. @sscoolqaz You're welcome ;)\n. if it's the first time that you install visual c++.. it will be tooooooooo slow :P\n. Minecarts aren't implemented yet, so Devs block Rails use :P\nAbout paintings... they work very well for me\n. You need to port forward, if you host your server on your phone... you will need to port forward on every Wi-Fi that you connect, but if you host it on a Home-PC it will be easier, just port forward your house's wifi and let the server on\n.

I believe that is a client <-> server bug, sometimes (when starting to walk) the client teleport to a random location (I see different chunks appearing :P) and the player location still being the same for the server, so it can be related to the chunk sending error that @shoghicp previously reported to Mojang, and by the server side... still in development, so it can also have a bug handling player's location, health, motion, etc :P\n. @Huntereb Yes, it also have many bugs with local multiplayer :P\n. it's a client problem, it may receive the chunks but don't show them :/\n. You need to update your start.sh file too, please go here for instructions:\nhttp://forums.pocketmine.net/threads/pocketmine-mp-alpha_1-4dev-is-available-for-testing.3660/\n.

Can you confirm it without using any plugins?\n. @macwinlol Mobs aren't implemented yet :P but the flower thing is weird :S\n. If you aren't op, you can't modify the spawn location and you can't make you op right in-game, you need to op yourself in the console first\n. True xD but it can be useful... well maybe :P\n. we don't know, maybe someone plan to do a Humans vs DroppedItems game :/\n. @jython234 Hey! that was my idea! xD JK :P\n. Lag maybe? (If you're using BigBrother Plugin remember that it doesn't have inventory implemented)\n. 500 GB of space doesn't mean that it will be fast, to reduce the lag you need to set a higher value for the RAM, not the disk space\n. That's the problem, I don't know of any machine that can handle 500 GB of RAM, one thing is the disk space and another one, the RAM (Random Access Memory)\n. tnpxxsheepdog no, that's not the problem...\n. 0.9.2 broke multiplayer... it's more buggy that in previous 0.9.x versions, even betas :P\n. @Huntereb not only me, ask on IRC, some players already updated to 0.9.2 and they also say that everything is worse :/\n. blame Mojang xD\n. for me just when I join :P\n. yes, but some plugins update health and other get updated when a player is healed/attacked, this can help to make everything easier...\n.

Because the android app fetch all the github releases and post them there, but it's not compatible yet :/\n. We need to wait until it gets a stable official release on PC, then the PocketMine app will be updated on Google Play and Cydia ;)\n. you can't install PocketMine 1.4 on android yet\n. Thanks @Darunia18 xD\n. You can't install PocketMine 1.4 in Android yet, it's not supported yet (even if it's shown in Version Control)\n. There are some installers for PC, use them\nHere they're just scroll down to the bottom of the post \n. Try tapping the place where the chest should be to make it appear...\n. This problem occurs by the server, they spawn the entity 2 blocks under the real position, and when the client get out of those blocks, other players still see them 2 blocks under :P\n. Yup, it's solved, now let's wait until someone close this issue :/\n. Known issue... Blame the server :P\n. This also happen on Windows, so it's a PocketMine bug... This happen when someone try to join a newly generated \"FLAT\" world (has default world) He can't even join :P\nEDIT: This also happend with \"DEFAULT\" world generation, Here's the log\n. That's the problem, any world generator will return those errors :P\n-----Mensaje original-----\nDe: tnpxxsheepdog\nEnviado: 29/07/2014 05:59 p.m.\nPara: PocketMine/PocketMine-MP\nCC: Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez\nAsunto: Re: [PocketMine-MP] Error with Pocketmine-MP dev #372 (#1802)\nUse flat world generation until the default can be fixed \n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. @santiboub Do you remove any entities in the world?

No, for any PocketMine-MP 1.4 beta build (Beta 2+) you need to use Minecraft PE 0.9.4+ (but 0.9.5 is recommended) and if you don't portforward you should use it on the same LAN\n.

It just stop working for some seconds (20-40) and then return a Segmentation Fault... But without errors :/\n. Maybe it's caused by plugins?\n. Hmmm strange... well I don't have any plugins that modifies Level information automatically :/\nAnyways, I don't have more info right now :P \nBTW: is a newly generated world\n. @shoghicp Maybe BigBrother?

No. I support @Falkirks, there's no need to change everything, tabs are easier to use and edit xD\n. @ProjectInfinity yes,  if you don't know them, try using google :smile_cat: \n. I think this is not needed\n. Yes. I think it will be useful for people that want to have everything up-to-date, however you should include the disable-auto-update property (by default false)\nI support the idea to prevent the non-backwards compatible API upgrade, that will help the owner not to break the server automatically... but I think that a property for it may be included too.\nEDIT: I think that it will be also great if you advice to update the PHP binaries before updating :P\n. I also agree to implement the question on the Setup wizard, also (I think you already think it) to update using the preferred channel option on pocketmine.yml \n. It works perfectly for me :/\n. :open_mouth: :+1: \n. :+1: :3\n. This is better than making everyone to repeat specia code block on all the functions\n. YES \nBecause of behaviour, it is better to place a short name, and not to lace all kind of names that could be attached\n.  Keep in mind that LevelDB support is experimental and is only available to Linux distributions, but you will need to compile again all the binaries\n. Lagg...\n. @Pro1000 Don't paste the whole crash dump xD use Pastebin instead\n@KiddRock It's not about plugins, it appears to be an error coming directly from PocketMine\n. It's recommended to use MCRegion worlds, Anvil are kinda buggy xD\n. Maybe it's because of internet...\n. I confirm this bug... The server doesn't recalculate the permission nodes correctly\n. :+1:\n. Reinstall PocketMine, PHP and/or their dependencies\n. https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. No, there aren't any timeframes nor ETAs \n. Right now, Pocketmine as a simple world generator, it generates the same wolrd always, so Seeds are not supported, neither biomes.\n. @crazyravenspeep Sorry? Please un subscribe from Github, you're the only one that can stop your problems, no one subscribed your email here.\n. EssentialsPE isn't related to this issue, it doesn't have any working piece of code that generate trees, the command that generate trees is not enabled and doesn't even work, so is not EssentialsPE's fault :P\n. Yes, I should know it because I'm the developer of EssentialsPE xD anyways, the \"tree generation\" code just available when you execute the \"tree or bigtree\" commands... That are not available in anyways... Even if you edit the code and get to enable the commands, they just still don't work xD \n. Hahahaha\n. Well I don't really understand the way that levels are loaded, but what if I'm trying to get them in the \"default world\"? \n. Okey ^_^ thanks! :'D\n. TaskHandler? Could you explain that?\n. :+1:\n. D:\n. Could you be more explicit about the situation please?\n. If you use plugins then there's nothing we can do here, please directly contact the developer(s) of the plugin you use.\n. Could you post your \"server.properties\" file somewhere like in \"Pastebin\" and provide the link?\n. Doesn't matter, please provide a copy of it, so we can define what part maybe wrong\n. This issue is realted to a plugin, nothing to do with PocketMine.\nPlease close this issue and contact the plugin developer.\n. Just wanted to be sure :P I believe @shoghicp can report and fix it anyways xD \n. NBT for items! Finnally :'D This will open the doors for custom items (in some way) >:)\n. @matcracker But what if @mightysun99  properly arranged all the items? This isn't duplicated at all :P\n@shoghicp I believe people will like to have all the singleplayer creative tools in Multiplayer too ;)\n. Where do you suggest to place it? \n. May I ask what's the purpose of all this events without real Vehicles implementation?\n. Well then, just make sure to properly code everything ;) you have some basic PHP mistakes on your code :S Please use and IDE and always check for possible errors :P\n. @Gamecrafter Then don't try to make plugins please... You don't know a lot too :S Or just let him try out if @shoghicp don't closes this :P\n@Addison118 Please read the PocketMine API carefully... You're overriding functions like isCancelled()and setCancelled() on events, they're already set, to implement them just write implements Cancellable in the class declaration line\n. You shouldn't override them, because the other ones has some protection code, and yours not :$\n. Don't spam issues, if your issue was clsed is because it's Invalid and the problem may be only on your side, due to bad server configuration or something else like a plugin you have\n. You're using an outdated version of EssentialsPE, I recommend you to update and check if the problem persists\n. Pfff, player skin can be changed each time you join a server, no need to delete the \"{name}.dat\" file\n. @sithsiri Then don't fire useless solutions\n. There's only one way to cancel tasks... But you may be using an incorrect one:\n- _Incorrect_:\nphp\n$task = new Task(); // This will change depending on your task class, but I will just use it as a reference\n$this->getServer()->getScheduler()->scheduleRepeatingTask($task, 10); // Again, just example...\n// MOAR Code\n$task->cancel();\n*Correct:\nphp\n$task = new Task();\n$this->getServer()->getScheduler()->scheduleRepeatingTask($task, 10); // Again, just example... Your \"Task\" class will change this text...\n// MOAR Code\n$this->getServer()->getScheduler()->cancelTask($task->getTaskId());\n\nBut why is this!?!?!?!?!?!\nDue to the class stored by the $task variable... In the first example, the \"incorrect\" one... You're storing a type of Task() class, while in the second one we are using the \nDue to the class being used to cancel the task... the incorrect way is to use the type of Task or TaskHandler, you must use the ServerScheduler because is the manager for all the tasks\n. I have checked the code for this event and it seems to be fine... Are you sure you're using $e->setCancelled(true);?\n. @Creeperface01 The default value for the method setCancelled is FALSE so be sure to always write down TRUE ;)\n. @SkygridRex Primero que nada... Hay que hablar ingl\u00e9s ;) Segundo... Ya esta hecho, solo que por alguna raz\u00f3n, no esta funcionando para @Creeperface01 \n. http://Jenkins.pocketmine.net\n. @TahaTheHacker This doesn't have anything to do with EssentialsPE, you don't even know if @GilbertMC uses it\n. If you feel that this problem comes from a plugin, contact the plugin maker directly, don't bother people that can't help your with your \"personal issue\"\n. Besides \"master\" branch, is not encourage to use PMMP code, it's just \"experimental\" so don't complain about it\n. Be sure that your code uses:\nphp\n/** @var Player $player */\n$player->getUniqueId();\nAlso, some old PMMP1.6 builds where having some odd compilation error that didn't let the UUID to be set at player generation... Please use the latest one\n. @202831820 He's asking for Comand Line properties, like when starting the server using ./start.sh in Linux.\nI know there are some properties already implemented, like --disable-ansi and --no-wizard, but not for your request\n. Also, a mobile phone doesn't have enough power to keep a server, I strongly recommend you to rent either a Dedicated Server or a Virtual Private Server (VPS)\n. You need to \"re-install\" PocketMine, I will suggest you to make a backup of your players, plugins and worlds folders before the new installation ;)\n. Then there's a problem with the compilation problem for your machine, try manually installing the binaries (Use google to get them)\n. For linux machines, you should compile the PHP binaries for your own VPS with some kind of apt-get command, Pocketmine is designed to use either user pre-installed or self-compiled binaries, it shouldn't be a big deal...\nBTW: Keep in mind that you need to have PHP 5.6 for Pocketmine to work... Either it will refuse the binaries and return an error like: Couldn't find a working PHP binary, please use the installer :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: \n. Why should you need to limit players' hotbar? They're free to use whichever UI style they want! (Depending on their client screen size...)\n. Wow! Thanks @PEMapModder! Now going to get some more investigation with Wireshark :3 Hopefully committing soon :D\n. @AryToNeX @PEMapModder They also work to me (for now), I'm in iOS ;)\n. @AryToNeX There could be something wrong either in client's or server's side...\n. Can you tell us which steps are needed to reproduce the error you're reporting?\n. Well, the current code changed doesn't makes sense, instead I would suggest to change the \"Reason parsing\" inside the kick() function, so it is more dynamic and can be adapted to the /ban command\n. @Intyre That's it ;) Thanks :3\n. I'm not aware of that, as I don't use windows xD \n. Seems that anyways it worked (Client side)... So this may be useless...\n. BTW @TigerHix: Use Integers instead of Floats next time. #GeneralKnowledge ;D\n. @Falkirks :+1: \n. You can pretty easily get all \"World folders\", just do a scandir() within $this->getServer()->getDataPath() . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . \"worlds\"\n. @thebigsmileXD Not really, while you ask for a \"level\" it should be ready-for-use, if you need to load them beforehand then add them to the list of 'worlds-to-be-loaded', instead use a plugin to load them at startup\n. Ping @PEMapModder @Intyre ... Should I update this to PHP7?\n. I'm now updating this pull to PHP7... Should I open a new pull or you just \"open\" this one again to get the new commits?\n. Hmm... You made it before I pushed all my local work :$\n. Rebased a little fix... Now Travis should approve this pull\n. @robske110 Harming? I don't think so... \n. This is not a forum, argue in Twitter... And I'm pointing out that this is not harming, I do not have interest in updating any other code... \n. FloatingTextParticle is kinda hacky with the client, but somehow got fixed with 0.15... Your only solution is to mess with invisible entity types\n. Multiple connections for the same Player? That could be harmful...\n. Swift is pretty easy to manage\nMono is the unix compiler for .NET projects, I don't think you will need it for iOS apps\n. PocketMine is not dead, but not as alive as it was before... It's just Idle... Intyre is providing Protocol Updates, which are essential for other PocketMine forks.\n. count($pk->records) > 0\n. I think you forgot a $ at the beginning of this line :3\n. ",

You just sent a notification email to 138 watchers of this repository for no reason.\n. @Coccy @UltimateMcraft this is not a forum. This issue ought to be locked as soon as possible.\nAlso this is an issue that was reported before the core rewrite. Whoever reported it, this should be closed. If the same problem exists, it is something wrong with new code, so it is a completely new issue and the bug tracking should not remain here.\n@Coccy yes Shoghi made PocketMine and he should fix it himself, and there is nothing wrong with him creating an issue here because this is a page that lists all bugs including the bugs found by the main developers. And please do stop the discussion about whether this is right or wrong; whatever different values we have, this is not the place to argue, to discuss, to use as a forum, or whatever. Read the contributing guidelines and follow them.\n. @shoghicp What happens if another entity spawns with the same EID of the painting, or a painting spawns with a despawned/disappeared/removed entity's EID?

Why mojang-related?\n. @DarkN3ss61 Why is it echo on?\n. @Rexo52 It is being worked at branch Core-Rewrite\n. Sorry I meant #786 not #768\n. It is because there is no command called /money?\n. just type \"op myname\" and then the enter button.\n. Is your name at ops.txt?\n. Add to the issue, duplications of bodies (entities of players) also occur randomly. And it was when there were only like 5 players when it occurred.\nEven more strange is clients don't crash for duplications of entities like the multi world painting bug.\n. Can Entity::spawn() help?\n. @UltimateMcraft this not only occurs for laggy people. And a server would render someone as AFK and invincible?\n. @UltimateMcraft and this is a PocketMine bug. The ping kick is not a proper solution for it. (Just like killing yourself is not the way to escape falling to death)\n. @UltimateMcraft look at the date of the post\n. 7 months ago\n. About breaking from above, according to @kvwang98, there are no physics for entities in PocketMine-MP, and items actuslly don't fall. However, at the client side, since dropped items should fall to ground in vanilla MCPE, the client's screen shows as if the dropped item has fallen.\nThis also explains why dropped items unpickable would fly into mid-air in players' screen.\nAs for chopping wood top, it is believed that players would travel through the destroyed block itself to collect the item.\n@shoghicp A temporary fix to this issue is to just set an entity's position always like Level::getSafeSpawn().\n. Then if it sucks under the floor just teleport it one block upper. That is the exact solution if there are no physics. (Yes I remember to say this)\n. @yudhiwidyatama there is a full rewrite on the physics c \n. Maybe like tnt cannons\nAlthough we know there is no such physics yet in PocketMine. \n. @Rexo52 you can farm whether farmland fertile or not in mcpc. The only difference is the speed.\n. Slabs not crafting is be because of packet loss: the packets crafting things are lost in the UDP connection.\nRails and minecarts don't craft because it is refused. \n. What are animals supposed to do when two players are holding the food?\n. @laptopdude90 yes very active at the Core-Rewrite branch.\n. Then the problem goes to whether WorldEditor can support //replace 9:* 0\nP.S. It should be 9 not 8.\n. @Matthew7758 it is because you have a 5000 ms ping. It is rejected the moment it goes to the server, the monetary and rails.\n. Having 999 issues is an issue?\n. @Rexo52 But there is no current issues open about this. At least it should not be closed.\n. Yes\n. Height is not the cause but is a solution.\n. @lesander the original issue is about the old API bug, and the thing you currently are talking about is kind of an unimplemented beta build feature.\n. @thetech101 when entities are implemented (or already fixed)\n. If you put the signature in a size-limited frame it is OK.\n. In fact it is LevelAPI::getAll()\n. Just disable the kick-flying option. It is obvious it is hard to solve.\nIf you want to solve it write your own code, the PocketMine team is busy on other things.\n. You mean the spaces? ...\n. Ok I'll change it to an issue.\n. I will close this pull request and change it to an issue.\n. Ain't this duplicated issue?\n. @wrewolf talk about this at #786(not #1001)\nAnd about breaking from above, according to @kvwang98, there are no physics for entities in PocketMine-MP.

Then why do you ignite it underwater?\n. Since currently you can't hurt mobs by TNT.\n. @LukeDarling Why yes then? ;D\n. This is not a bug. This is a feature. Mojang decided that before your device can download the chunks, your screen should show how it is when the seed was generated. And while downloading chunks your device also receive information about other players breaking blocks.\n. I think there is another reason other than paintings.\nI deleted entities.yml and it still crashes.\n. What is changed in the commit? \"opened a door again, say something, and slam it again\"\n.

So?\n. @shoghicp I meant, the pickaxe is supposed to be half-broken in any stackholder before I joined the game, but there is a bug somewhere that instead tells the client the pickaxe is new.\n. There are two bugs in this issue.\n. You don't need admin to update PocketMine, but you need admin to install PHP and some other binaries.\n. Read the FAQ\n. Wiki of this repo\n. OK I am not sure if this is the correct place to write but I am sure it is an issue.\n. Then where?\n. Takes six seconds to show destroyed blocks on your device? That is an MCPE problem then? Although I never came to this problem.\nUse the /ping command and see the ping (in ms). It should be around 3000\n. For problem 5 it is normal. Things don't disappear. Instead, the disappeared things should not be loaded. This problem is Mojang-related.\nProblem 6: give more info, as @tnpxxsheepdog said.\nProblem 3: poor internet connection.\n. So this issue is either duplicates or Mojang-related or non-issue. Can close.\n. The major problem is, this reports no bugs. So this issue should be closed.\n. Hey ask this on the PocketMine forums\n. According to ifw(I forgot who), \"never\".\n. Install Visual Basic C++ first\n. Why this echo off?\n. Open the door and then close it.\n. @Wakombaun #938 \n. @Wakombaun don't duplicate issues\n. It passes the Travis CI this time\n. The change is at the player command. When a player does \"/time set 0\" and the raw time is 19250, the time is instead set to 19200. To set it to 0 directly, the player has to do \"/time set 0 raw\".\n. I know this is not the place to argue, but is it that you must stick to vanilla?\nOK. Or for an alternative, you can make /time set 0  set 19250 to 0 and /time set day 19250 to 19200. This is how PocketInvEditor works.\nYes I understand that this should be done by a plugin although no one would bother to (at least). Never mind then.\n. Then how do you explain about looking down solves problem?\n. @shoghicp This issue is about how to fix the bug not reporting a bug.\n. The IP is 192.192.192?\n. You can just find the code that makes this at src/Player.php and delete it\n. @kvwang98 Won't this make plugins out-of-synchronization? And crack the events?\n. But I think it is possible that WorldEditor uses a synchronized thread.\n. Give more information about your OS\n. Reinstall properly\n. @Rexo52 or the desktop version view\n. Shouldn't u ask this on forums?\n. If u dnt want to kick players flying, enable allow-flying.h\n. BTW the strange thing is I never get warnings from using walk faster mod even I am using home network.\n. Just search in the source code \"moved too quickly\" and replace that line (by \"line\", I mean a part of a code seperated by two semicolons ;). \n. It is not called beta. The releases are alpha and pre-releases are development versions.\n. What OS are you using?\n. I think he didn't start the server.\nBTW another bug report idk if this is reported just maybe I didn't notice (I am watching this repository and read every issue since (but not because) the android version was uploaded);\nThe console ScrollView only scrolls down by one line every time console message is echoed; when it says starting plugins (with no plugins) and I wait curiously why it was such a long wait, I found that the done message was already shown just the scroll didn't scroll down enough.\n. @shoghicp just wondering the app was released by PocketMine team.\n. I did but collaboration does not mean total work. Nvm just don't understand. Well it is sensible to believe MrARM worked on the Android part though.\n. Duplication\n. Two possibilities:\n1. Don't put ur IP address in if u had.\n2. Change a port.\n. Look at the wiki.\n. It is buggy if you host and play on the same device.\n. And remember to port it forward.\n. And keep the ports at 19132-19135\n. Do you mean contributing code?\n. There is a thing called pull request\n. You can fork it to your repo and create pull request when you have tested it.\nAnd this is not the place to ask this.\n. @shoghicp however You can place rails from a map ported from mcpe\n. Read the wiki\n. @rexo52 don't force people to buy an android. My cousin has little opportunity to touch his home computer and he plays minecraft with his phone most of the time.\n. So there are two errors in this dump?\n. @Rexo52 Read what he says:\n@blakesayswhat initially said,\n\nFresh install, no plugins installed. \n. You forgot ,\n. And therefore fails Travis Cl build\n. Because there is armor. And health are auto-rounded to ceiling.\n. Is this bug present in vanilla SMP? If it is, I believe @PocketMine is not going to fix it.\n. I think a more suitable title of this issue should be \"Players health should be saved as double\".\n. Is it present means is it there\n. @jose-vm it is contained inside another issue, so this one is no longer needed.\n. No I mean console.command is literally supposed to be triggered when the command is run. However when we do /help all command handlers are called. If a plugin adds a handler of it, it cannot identify what it is called for.\n\nFor example,\n``` php\na plugin\npublic function init(){\n    ServerAPI::request()->addHandler(\"console.command\", array($this, \"event\"));\n}\npublic function event($data, $event){ # suppose always $event === \"console.command\"\n    if($data[\"execute\"] === true)\n        console(\"The command \".$data[\"cmd\"].\" has been run.\");\n}\n```\nIf we don't check $data[\"execute\"], when the command /help is issued, the console will spam with all commands.\nAnd as far as I know, adding $data[\"execute\"] or something like that in the source code is the only way to sort out events caused by issuing the command /help without checking the stack trace of calling the function in a hard method.\n. Are you not merging because it is me who create the pull request?\n. Why does this kind of spam come so frequently these days...\n. What is meant by more powerful PHP plugins?\n. @shoghicp LOL. But exactly does that mean plugins will be powerful enough to make it no need to modify src code anyways?\n. But can they still be in PHP?\nucfirst(strtolower(AND WHY DID YOU DELETE THE BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY FOR PLUGIN API))?\n. @Rexo52 like packages in Java. To prevent the error of plugins Redeclaring Class with same class names.\n. The point of using namespaces and using try catch finally?\n. @shoghicp I know. I am asking about the point of spending so much time to do this. There are no duplicating classes here.\n. @shoghicp zwhat we want is the ability to  fully subclass an item, so please remove the final tokens.\n. Why is ConsoleAPI in italic?\n. How can I update the extensions for Alpha_1.4?\n. @kenlauescuadro he is recoding them\n. @wantedkillers the entities are just all empty... No idea when he'll start.\n. @ThejenaROMtester that error occurs only when the TPS is lower than 12\n. Inventory per-world per-player?\n@Muedsa jails should be added via plugins\n. @Mr3Superfake Search the issues. There is a new closed issue on this.\nIt is almost the newest issue. The issue has the answer with it. (jenkins.pocketmine.net)\nThis is not a forum.\n. Check my edited last post.\n. Do /swl  first\n. Does the world name contain spaces?\n. SimpleWorlds/config.yml\n. @LukeDarling ?\n. Merge #1292 #1293\n. y u not merge?\n. From such a simple mistake we can see that @TrilogiForce is not the kind of people who understand what he is doing, so it is hard to believe he made those plugins all himself.\n. So @TrilogiForce is having ban points that won't expire because he is posting stolen content?\n. Moreover, the question he is asking is too newbie, he even doesn't know what $issuer and $data and $target means.\n. @ijoshuahd how I learned the for loop, is by copying Treebl's example loop and even till today everyone uses that example. Therefore copying a small part of code DOES give you skills.\n. What I understand is @TrilogiForce copies code. Therefore I just quitted @QuantumWorks\n. @TrilogiForce stop threatening real or otherwise\n. edit on your own fork not the pocketmine official fork (which creates branch \"patch-1\" on your branch)\nIf you had made it on two branches of yours, create pull request from your fork to another branch of your fork. Then merge it.\n. The main point is the id is not yet present in MCPE.\n. Well true there is golden apple.\n. Is this the latest dev?\nCuz there is no reference variable in line 41 in MinecraftInterface.php as I see.\n. Yeah in bb80854 the commit name is wrong\n. But that doesn't matter.\n. This should be done through a plugin...\n. @Syriamanal I don't see much difference between yours and @LukeDarling 's version.\n. This is not the solution, but using @99leonchang's banners to show your server status may help with fixing your problem.\n. Or try doing /ping (or my plugin InfoEssentials command /getping) to check if the internet connection is too poor.\n. @Rexo52 Why does SimpleAuth lag the server so much? As I had read it doesn't occupy any large loops, a lot of data nio or io.\n. @shoghicp If I download plugins from forums with incognito mode (therefore logged out) is this kind of rules violation bypass ban?\n. OK but can you explain why the clients can still receive it when I do /say you might be disconnected, while they are kicked for timeout?\n. @shoghicp Can you explain further?\n. I believe it is Redstone Plus crashing\n. @TheChriscraftMC look at the error dump. Pocket Guard is not a loaded plugin here.\n. To see whether others can connect to your server, connect to another network (other than the one your server is using) and try it.\nAnd IPs starting from 192.168.x.x are internal IPs. Port it forward in your router (look on internet to see how to do it) and find your external IP.\n. Crash caused by Plugin. Report to the developer.\n(well this is obvious since you have the observation)\n. Wow so many plugins...\n. no. what is it?\n. Well that would really be important if I make a world_regenerating minigame server like Skyblock...\n. How do I use enable-advanced-cache?

OK I figured out the reason and I don't think this will happen in the new rewrite.\n. auto-save does not save every time you place a block. It is something scheduled like, every minute.\nTry placing some blocks and flying around in MCPE and then suddenly FORCE CLOSE it. Then you will find the things you did in the last minute not saved.\n. Does it save if you log out and than login again without stopping the server\n. An extension description: Sometimes when switching from world to world, with very good connection and long waiting, the chunks still remain loading the old world's.\n. But this can be fixed by setting each block manuelly.\nAlthough it will lag the server.\n. Due to tnt? Is this a kind of joke? @chaboysabro\n. CommandEcho?\nCommands issued on console in PocketMine is not same as that executed in the command terminal.\n. Is it possible to get all registered commands then? The $cmds field in ConsoleAPI is private and idk why you can read private strings (like Player::$username) but not private arrays.\n. Presently, the only legal way to get all commands from a plugin, as I can think of, is to use\nphp\n$cmds=array();\n$help=array();\n$savedpage=0;\nfor($i=1; true; $i++){\n    $ret=ServerAPI::request()->api->console->defaultCommands(\"help\", array(\"$i\"), \"console\");\n    $front = explode(\" of \", $ret)[0];\n    $front = explode(\" page \", $front);\n    $front = $front [count($front) - 1];\n    if((int)$front==$savedPage)break;\n    $savedPage=(int)$front;\n    foreach(explode(\"\\n\", $ret) as $line){\n        if($line{0}!=\"/\") continue;\n        $cmds[] = strstr(\" \", substr($line, 1), true);\n        $help[] = substr(strstr(\" \", $line), 1);\n    }\n}\nAnd then use console.command to check the permissions\n. I said \"presently\"\n. it is Lifeboat Infinity you should directly reported to @williamtdr whatever reason it is\n. The difference is at Item::useOn(Entity)\n. I want to declare a subclass of Item that is not among these IDs, but, can do actions to tapped entities without adding another handler.\n. @shoghicp If you want to close this without merging, please explain.\nYou wanted to allow more powerful plugins, but you are making unnecessary restrictions (final)?\n. This is not \"adding new things\"... Just removed a limitation...\n. @shoghicp It is a new thing. It didn't happen before.\n. You change the world name in server.properties to that world name.\nOr use simpleworlds. Then use /swl \n. Paintings.\n. #375 #1098 #1156\n. Confirmed. In @Connor4898's server I also fall to death even I land in water pillar \n. Is your computer connected to the WiFi?\nAnd if you add an external server, your IP would be more stable.\n. Can you connect if you use the same Wi-Fi and use the blue button?\n. Oh and no commits >10 days...\n. @shoghicp Oh sorry about that\n. You should NOT put the IP\n. Did u forget the class name (for BlockAPI::get())?\n. This should be closed now that the code above is not matching the framework anyway.\n. Plugin list?\nOp?\nSpawn area?\n. @babyaries Look at the wiki: \nhttps://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/wiki\n. Especially this:\nhttps://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#i-cant-place-blocks\n. This is related to a plugin. Report the bug to the plugin developer (Falk I think) on the forums\n. Sorry wrong place\n. I know I just forgot to change the base branch\n. Don't put your IP\n. Because the IP ois only put in case you are connecting through multiple IP addresses.\n. Yes. In fact the server doesn't really need you to input the IP.\n. 0.0.0.0\n. What version is this?\n. You mean stable version?\nPlease give as much information as possible.\n. Are you even uploading the correct error dump? Why the spaces between file path separators...\n. Protocol in 0.7.6 and 0.8.1 are different. 0.7.6 cannot connect to 1.3.10+ servers properly.\n. If you use external IP make sure u port it forward.\nAs it says, this version is for 0.7.6.\n. @shoghicp why are so many people using 1.3.10 these days?\n. I think it automatically recovers chunks from a dummy file.\n. @Rexo52 because there are done people like you who expect every commit on GitHub to be well tested, they have to do a full coding before releasing.\n. Someone changed it?\n. Hey don't spam issues\n. Why isn't this closed?\n. Please stop spamming issues\n. @Intyre This is a falling sand bug. Like a RemoveEntityPacket not sent or something like that.\n. Issues caused by plugin should not be reported here.\n. Close it then?\n. Since u know it is similar issue and see it on the TODO list you should not reproduce the issue.\n. @kvwang98 I think you should have thought about that long time ago...\n. Is it like this in MCPC?\nI think it is just an animation. This can be easily done by a plugin.\nAnyway I think in MCPC although an animation shows something falling from the sky, whatever happens the player must receive it and no one can rob it.\nSo this is only a matter of animation effect.\n. @dossjb Sounds like this would be fixed soon. I tried it in a pull request yesterday.\n. @dossjb Except that @shoghicp rejected it, saying:\n\nbecause entities are not yet added.\n. Look at #1377 \n. @dossjb wait for the update. They may add it after adding full entities and physics. \n. @kvwang98 Use multiple branches\n. @kvwang98 it says the restriction will be lifted in 1.4 and 1.4 is not yet released.\n. ?\n. Server overloaded means the TPS is lower than 12 ticks.\n. Unknown reason means it is rejected by a plugin (or at least rejected by the event player.connect).\n. @williamtdr Why don't you directly push onto master branch?\n. RCON passwords are generated randomly.\n. Did you press enter\n. Sorry wrong place\n. Sorry I was creating a branch basing on a non-original-repo-synced branch without noticing.\n. I shall delete my repo and refork now.\n. Because you need to port it forward and release the public IP.\n. http://forums.pocketmine.net/threads/port-forwarding-guide.1294/\n. Occasionally I spawn in void in LDX's server too.\n. @shoghicp This is not related to spawnpoint. Spawn is not changed. When I say \"spawn\", I refer to the event player.spawn not player.respawn, where /spawnpoint configurates the latter. I am referring to that when I login into the server, I spawn directly in the void (not chunk problems), but when I respawn for the first time, I spawn in the void, but for the second time, I respawn at the LAST LOCATION when I logged out (not the server spawnpoint).\n. Is there an error before this? It should generate an E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR. \n. Can you find the error message at the end of console.log?\n. @shoghicp Every person new to this kind of console, especially those who had used IRC (and similar things), would tend to begin with a \"/\" at his first experience.\n. yaml_parse, preg_replace, file_get_contents, PluginAPI::readYAML, the first three ones, none of them calls to each other...\n.

No. The error is caused caused by THAT map.\n. no I don't know\n. Wow how many plugins...\n. But if the plugin uses it as a string, how is it related to the level?\n. Port forward is for external users connecting to a specific device inside your local network (Wi-Fi), so no need for porting forward if you only use it locally. And for most others (only few don't), portinh forward is required for an external network to connect inside.\n. Extra information: to get your internal (more precise than private) IP address, you can usually find them at the wireless settings (where you configure your Wi-Fi) of your device. For android, open Settings->WHATEVER-IT-IS-ON-YOUR-DEVICE->Wi-Fi. Click your current connected one and there you can view your internal IP. For Windows (before Windows 8), click the wireless thing at the right bottom corner of your screen, and then right click the current connected Wi-Fi. Choose Status and then find and click the button Details. Use the IPv4 address.\n. @PluginsAreMyFavorite Uninstall some outdated plugins, although PluginsAreYourFavorite\n\nP.S.

FolderPluginLoader there?\n. @MUedsa Sorry for offending but can you shut up? You keep writing the same message and all the 104 watchers of this repo receive a notification and an email because of the same question, thrice.\n. Look at the wiki.\n. CLI stops working for me too but only when the server crashes.\n. Mine crashes when it starts up.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not using this as a forum.\n. Interesting. So the threads will block the thread if their references are overwritten?\n.

There is an event called EntityMoveEvent. It is not good to call an extra event for player in particular.\nMost things have an event for them if it is added in PocketMine and exist in Bukkit.\n. I believe this is intended behavior. It allows easier reading of debug messages.\n. @pocketfartRS can you use the edit button instead of making the 111 watchers of this repository receive a notification and email for your edit? This is not a forum.\n. Maybe improve your internet connection?\n. In fact, you can just simply delete your world.\nYou can use it before?\n. Please don't spam. People will help you when they see it and when they can.\n. @dutok \"we\"?\nBack to the topic, contact your host. \n. This is not a forum...\n. You have wrong installation of PocketMine-MP. config.php is a file in the source.\n. Maybe you should report this bug at the bigbrother repo instead of here?\nThis looks like an enderdragon anyway.\n. Folder name? Are you using DevTools FolderPluginLoader?\n. Plugins in folders cannot be loaded by PocketMine-MP without DevTools.\n. What folder did you rename?\n. And this affected? So strange... Does it apply to all plugins?\nP.S. DevTools seems not to load folder plugins with a period . inside the folder name.\n. How will you solve it? Can you solve it by this?\nphp\n\\Phar::isValidPharFilename(\"/\".substr($filename, strlen($this->server->getPluginsPath()));\n. Explosions are going to be rewritten soon, and this two functions don't seem to be used by the API. Then, plugins won't work with this thing maybe.\n. @Striker209MPE subclass the explosion class and redeclare the $what could be possible.\nAlso, according to @shoghicp, explosions are going to be rewritten. Since your pull request only helps plugins, by the time you finish your plugin, the explosion may already be rewritten (or maybe not).\n. Another server is using that port. Maybe you didn't close it.\n. Someone else is using that port maybe.\nOr just choose another port. Also, this is your problem, and this is an issue checker not a help forum.\n. @MildNinja fastest method to fix it: reboot your router\nAnother method is, check every device at your router if it is using that port\n. Download the phar, not the source.\n. @StevenSPM obviously he has his own host. He hosts the lifeboat network and he is a collaborator of this project, and he won't report bugs of hosting sites.\nThe issue didn't happen until a few hours passed? Anything happened that caused it, or accumulated? (Chernobyl blew up because the researchers there wanted to test something and then boom)\n. > This is not a general help forum.\n. @yizizawezome it is your own problem to be unable to start a server when everyone else can. Also, if it is the android app's problem, report at the android app issues page.\n. @yizizawezome You won't get help by spamming issues. Moreover, GitHub is not the place to ask for help.\n. @sekjun9878 \n| Steve's status \\ Damage source | Fire | Lava |\n| :-- | :-: | :-: |\n| inside | FIRE | LAVA |\n| outside | FIRE_TICK | FIRE_TICK |\nThis is what I think it is.\n. Do not use CallbackTask for plugins. They will not work with /reload and plugin disabling.\n. @3do2 that is PocketMine core so it is OK because it is not a plugin. Since you are in a plugin, you must subclass the PluginTask thing. Also, do not ask for help here.\n. @3do2 check with time() every few ticks.\n. @jython234 @3do2 of course there are ping pong packets to make sure the player is still connected? The point is just to shorten the timeout?\n. Chunks won't unload?\nP.S. @shoghicp this is one of the rare circumstances when you would reopen an issue :P\n. Use the new installer.\n. Android app bugs should not be reported here.\n. It is because your client downloaded in correct chunks, in which there isn't a stone block there at all.\n. @MobileCrafter @sebagius7110 It is client side. The client has not yet received the chunk/update-block packet about that stone block, so it shows stone. But if the player touches that block, PocketMine-MP will realize that the client doesn't know that and send a UpdateBlockPacket to ensure the client knows that since you can't tap a block in air.\n. lesander: void damage is still fatal.\n. This is not a forum. Please don't spam our dashboards by putting many comments. You can use the \"Edit\" button. Also, the \"Cloes issue\" button is below the comment box.\n. - The name rules are according to the account rules in MCPC. Spaces would make it hard to mention the player in commands.\n- $, %, & and | do not affect, but if the server operators are unable to type that character (due to their keyboard doesn't have it), it will cause a problem.\n- Isn't it already like this? The server won't know whether the player has disconnected unless the user properly closed the client.\n(You can't label issues in other repos)\n. Reinstall PocketMine-MP. This is not the place to ask for help. (I am sorry, but my whole notification page is of your comments)\n. There are many repeated issues about teleporting bugs...\n. Did you run /spawnpoint luca28pet 128 128 128?\n. And why are you making an issue if you know how to?\n. This is not a help forum... It isn't even a bug...\n. @lesander https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n\nThe following:\nI've a question\n\nFor questions, please refer to the #pocketmine or #mcpedevs IRC channel on Freenode. There is a WebIRC if you want.\nYou can ask directly to @PocketMine in Twitter, but don't expect an inmediate reply.\n. @lesander Maybe not on other repos, but please follow the Contributing Guidelines for each repository. When you create an issue, it asked you to read the contributing guidelines first. And this is obviously a question. \n. Update PocketMine-MP. This is not the place to ask for help. Look at the contributing guidelines.\n. Mojang issue\n. @jython234 this is not a forum for support that's why\n@Mooncoder it uses a PHP script that runs alone. You don't need to run PocketMine-MP to create a phar file. You just need to have a PHP script. Look at ConsoleScript.php for more information.\n. Add android issues at android app repo?\n. Perhaps it is packet loss.\n. @maxwinlol read about what is implemented and what isn't (I nearly wrote \"what is extended\" xD) before trying to report bugs. Also, create issue for each bug you believe to be independent.\n. https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/blob/master/src/pocketmine/entity/Entity.php#L263\n\n\nAs seen, attack() is an abstract function in the patent class that must be inherited. Please test before contributing.\n. Yes but they won't work. It is an unimplemented feature of PocketMine-MP. Please close the issue.\n. Is that a logstream problem instead of an internet problem?\n. I think it is a console logStream problem.\n. https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/blob/master/src/pocketmine/item/Item.php#L481\nhttps://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/blob/master/src/pocketmine/item/Item.php#L37\nMaybe you did something wrong?\nInteger should work too\n. @Yosshi999 yep, and it's 1 there.\n. No. It is not related to the source.\nThe ID of stone is 1 not 0.\n. Because they aren't supposed to. .php plugins are no longer supported. Please contact the plugin developer to update it. Please look at the contributing guidelines before submitting an issue.\n. @iaidan if you write plugins and know what a phar file is, you should notice that the PocketMine plugin API has changed and old plugins are no longer compatible.\n. And do you think this only applies to that single file?\nAlso, constants are inherited to subclasses. There is another fix to that issue maybe.\n. I mean, the block constants are inherited to every subclass, so using parent and self are the same. Moreover, an error message (undefined constant \\pocketmine\\block\\Stone::STONE) would show up if this is the case.\n. Sorry I didn't notice the whole issue is about the redeclared constant Stone::STONE as another type of stone.\nThen maybe you should use Block::STONE instead of parent::STONE to make it more specific?\n. This is not a way to request for updates.\n. Use the latest development version.\n. @iksaku it is not the same. E.g. Wheat seeds !== the growing crops\n@swagking47 it is an inherited function at the superclass BlockEvent.php\n. @iksaku it won't. For placing a stone block, $event->getItem() returns an object equal to new \\pocketmine\\item\\Block(new \\pocketmine\\block\\Stone, while $event->getBlock() returns an object equal to new \\pocketmine\\block\\Stone. Also, if you only have getItem(), you can't get the position because $event->getItem()->getBlock() will have the vectors of 0,0,0, while $event->getBlock() will have the real vectors where the item is placed at.\nAlso, getBlock() is returned at the superclass. Learn more about PHP objects if you don't understand.\n. Which version are you using? Phar plugins and PHP/PMF plugins cannot work together.\n. 1.1.0 won't work with PMF plugins and PHP plugins. Only PHAR plugins are supported. As the contributing guidelines, plugins being not updated should not be reported here but to their developers.\nFor SimpleAuth, did it say memory exhausted?\n. Why?\n. This is a bug tracker not a help forum. The latest development builds should support it.\n. This is bug in MCPE. PocketMine-MP has nothing to do with this. Test in vanilla servers to check if an issue exists before reporting it here. This is not the bug tracker of MCPE.\n. Only making it implement the cancellable interface doesn't make the event actually cancellable.\n. @williamtdr It won't throw an error. It just doesn't work as intended (nothing happens).\n. @williamtdr https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/blob/master/src/pocketmine/event/Event.php#L66\n. oops\n. new Item::FIRE throws an error.\n. new Fire() would never be identical to anything else anyways.\n. I remember @shoghicp doesn't like pulls with so many commits.\n. @MalekAlrwily Delete and refork the repo and only commit exactly what you want. Last time @shoghicp refused to merge my pull until I created a new pull without those commits (by reforking). Maybe he doesn't like me having several commits just for a single feature, although it is a feature.\n. @MalekAlrwily And it is exactly that @PocketMine Team's then representitive, @shoghicp, pointed out that pull requests should not have any extra comments because they will result in inaccurate contribution statistics.\n. This is not a forum.\n. This is not a help channel. Also, the simplicity of titles should be maximized and description should be put in the description box. Please review the contribution guidelines before creating an issue.\n. How many commits and pull requests are we making for this...\n. @williamtdr I think your commit 2066e92 broke any possible auto-merge for this.\n. It is an MCPE render bug. No idea if PocketMine-MP can fix this, but I tend to believe not.\n. Well, this is what it was like when you used SQLite3.\n. @Mooncoder this is not a forum.\n. \"there can not set multiple items\"?\n. @FUGAMARU what do you mean\n\nset items\nevent\n\n?\n. Use jenkins.pocketmine.net and make a proper title.\n. It is not yet released, and updating this doesn't make it suddenly support 0.9.5 because it needs to be updated along with the possible new protocol version.\n. It should be new \\pocketmine\\item\\Block(new Air())\n. @swagking47 indeed this slows down the server by several nanoseconds, but it is better coding practice to increase readability.\nOr is it that you just want to have more contributions to the repo?\n. I thought there was already such pull request.\n. @Huntereb usually this kind of issue, if you have enough memory to load levels, is caused by an infinite recursive loop.\nI just don't understand why every plugin makes a disable message, like SpawnWithItems say it is disabling when console already says it is disabling above.\n. This is not the place to discuss about plugin disable messages.\nBack to topic, if you increase the allocated memory by two (multiply by two) and load only one small world, that issue should only be caused by an infinite loop like\nphp\nfunction runMe(){\n    runMe();\nbecause of a mistake.\nP.S. Disabling xPermMgr is a warning?\n. I reproduced this issue. I created a world with Bukkit and with chunks at x=1000 y=1000. When I try to teleport to 1000,128,1000 using the /tp command, the memory exhausted when running at NBT.php#L77. Not sure if this is caused by the same reason, but @Huntereb's issue happened at the writeCompressed() function while mine happened at the get() function.\n. This is the console log with bug reproduced with this plugin script.\nPlease also note the protocol issue in the console log.\n. There is a world border plugin of you want. If you want to teleport to 1.5 million blocks away, try that with PocketInvEditor by @zhuowei in single player. It is an MCPE bug and we cannot fix it using a server.\n. Use the search box. There are already other issues reporting this issue, and it seems to have been fixed already.\n. It may be caused by a bad connection. If you don't suffocate, it is because you are not in a block, but your connection is slow so your chunks aren't sent yet.\n. I think it is resolved now.\n. Replaced by #1837.\n. @Andy15 Yes that is exactly what they are doing.\n. @swagking47 this pull request is pointless because\n1. It won't increase comprehensibility.\n2. Op should not be ucfirst'end.\n. What is wrong with the 18 GB of data?\n. Stop duplicating please...\n. @907SnowMan This is not a forum. Don't use the issue tracker as a forum.\n. Don't report android version issues here.\n. @huntereb @Yosshi999 Wood, saplings, planks, whatever, all with damage fields specific.\n. @zsnowy use the beta version. It says \"starting Minecraft pe server\" for which version every launch. And this issue tracker tracks bugs on the development version, not to help you because you are using the wrong version .\n. Translate at http://translate.pocketmine.net not here.\n. Translate at http://translate.pocketmine.net\n. You mean, combine the commits?\nSorry I don't know about Git rebase.\n. @Falkirks What do you want me to do?\n. Sorry I didn't use one for this.\n. Read the contributing guidelines before creating an issue.\n. Fall through ground or teleport from above-ground into underground? The former would be a rendering issue and th second could be a server-side issue.\n. @migwell a bug report doesn't need to include the obvious reason for how it annoys you. Just wait :)\n@Humerus I'm wondering if it is that a player is teleported to, like, the following example:\ny = 100: air\ny = 99: grass\ny = 98: stone\nPlayer position: 98.xxx\nCan you see if it is right?\nIf yes, this confirms @Intyre's (or maybe it is @shoghicp's) hypothesis that player teleports should have the y field as the eye position, not the foot position, which is Tue conventional one because if so, in the example, a packet is sent to teleport the player to y = 100, but PocketMine thinks 100 is the foot position (which will be the player normally standing still on the grass), while the client thinks it is the eye position, thus making the player foot position at y = 98.xxx, and client-side-ly falls to 98_ creating an effect of following through blocks.\n. Create a new pull request?\n. Then it shouldn't be named \"kick message\"?\n. I'm pretty sure that that function isn't only used for network protocol. For example, some data savings need it too.\n. Since it has an issue with multiple platforms, I think it is safer not to add it, just to remind developers of the potential that this does not work.\n. It is an error caused by tile destruction.\nI believe it is safe to ignore this bug.\n. Then include the method in your own plugin not here ;)\n. Don't ask for  individual support here. Since every one else connect, it is your own problem. This is an issue tracker, not a support channel. Use the forums or IRC for that.\n. @lesander yes, but he knows not now.\n. @iksaku we all know that. Such comment is unnecessary.\n. This is not a place for  individual support. Use the forums or IRC for that.\n. It doesn't occur for me. Are you using the latest version? What OS? Maybe it has some threads not stopped.\n. @DaveJukes we all looked at it. On fact, 127 people received an email and a notification on GitHub about it. This is not a forum, so we don't reply just to reply. And please don't comment just to comment, because we will see this issue when we are finding the next bugs to fix (when we the developers/contributors have time and want to find something to fix) in the issue list. In the meantime, please wait patiently. No one ever ignores an open issue.\n. Perhaps you should search in the closed issues too, because this can be a Mojang issue.\n. Someone should remove the please submit thing because it is now auto reported \n. Don't report bugs about 1.3.12 please.\n. Check your connection.\n. @iksaku configure your workspace. You changed the tabs to spaces.\n. Oops xD\n. 1. Please use English.\n2. Please write a descriptive title.\n3. Please check if the issue is already reported before submitting. (Glowstone light issue is reported already)\n. Please make a descriptive title. This is an issue tracker, not a forum. Read the contribution guidelines before creating an issue.\n. @zymk9 edit the description.\n. @tnpxxsheepdog he should expect a bug fix not help.\n. Looks like the really relavent code is at the __construct constructor of InstallerLang.\n. System banner: Windows NT 15INCH-PC 6.1 build 7601 (Windows 7 Business Edition Service Pack 1) i586\nReproducible\n. Yes. I reproduced it again.\n\nhttps://www.filepicker.io/api/file/PpzTrS7mQtqjyB0YOUn6\n. @iJoshuaHD this is an issue not a thread. This is an issue tracker not a forum ;)\n. It is because your network is slow. The crafting is handled at the main thread as the network thread, so crafting doesn't make the server slow. You can blame packet loss though, but anyway it is your slow network.\n. If you don't know if it is implemented, check the release descriptions. And stop creating issues for unimplemented features please!\n. This is not a forum. Please don't use this as a forum.\n. Cobweb is not supposed to prevent drop damage even in vanilla.\n. This is an already known issue.\n. It is because entity physics aren't fully implemented yet.\n. It is because mobs don't have AI yet. Check the release descriptions before creating an issue!\n. Yes, we saw a lot reports of this crash on the crash archive already. http://crash.pocketmine.net/search/report/31723\n. It seems to be the error that listener of subclass listens to the superclass\n. This issue is duplicated.\n. What if it is false? Just looks very strange.\n. @tnpxxsheepdog I suppose it is a plugin, although it sounds like a PocketMine issue.\n. This is an unimplemented feature, and this should not be reported as an issue because we know it already. And this is not a feature request platform. Thank you for reading the contribution guidelines.\n. Because this is an invalid issue. This warning is generated by PocketMine, and it is because the way you installed PocketMine has a problem. As for how to solve this issue, this is not a support channel. Please read the contributing guidelines before submitting an issue.\n. No.\n- Reasons for agreeing\n  1. This change makes people who don't have the tab key on their keyboards convenient to edit the code.\n  2. This change avoids the issue of GitHub indenting 8 characters while most editors indenting 4 characters for a tab, which causes visual effects to the code.\n  3. This change avoids the issue when replacing all spaces with tabs that the header comment of the PocketMine-MP word's spaces changed into tabs, akin to the effects of 2.\n- Reasons for objection\n  1. This change is non-constructive to the project. This has made the file size larger, and this in fact causes inconvenience to people in these ways, although effect quite negligible:\n     1. It takes a longer download/decompress time.\n     2. It takes a longer time for editors to read/save files.\n     3. It slows down the PHP code parser in runtime, and with the usage of auto loader, this significantly affects runtime. The effect is still quite negligible, but as a project with certain quality, the code should use as little memory and as runtime-efficient as possible as long as it doesn't affect the gameplay/performance.\n  2. Only very intelligent IDEs or editors, like the GitHub online code editor, can support this kind of indention with no difference in editing (e.g. only press left or backspace once to work with an indent, instead of four times, as @sekjun9878 suggested). To most developers, this plainly caused inconvenience.\n  3. Developers have to change their settings, which would be inconvenient for people who have to dig out the settings out of their editors/IDEs.\n\nComparing the two points, I believe that the objection reasons win the agreeing reasons:\n1. People's own fault of having no tab key. This issue mostly happens for people on mobile. In this case, I suggest them to copy \\n\\t\\t\\t into their clipboard and paste this every newline. This actually is my way of coding with tab indents on mobile. In fact, on some devices, copying&pasting is even faster than typing spaces, which easily results in counting the number of spaces wrongly.\n2. Use spaces in the middle of lines, but keep tabs in the beginning of lines. Basically, this is how it is currently, as is the PhpStorm default editor settings, which many developeres use.\n3. The developer's own fault of putting spaces, which is the reason to have to replace the spaces. Why change the whole project's code just for this?\n. @ProjectInfinity and you guess everyone has money to buy PHPStorm to use for more than a month? And look at my other reasons.\n@shoghicp write your comment?\n. @ProjectInfinity\n1. It does to me. It isn't very significant, but it makes editors load slightly slower. Yes you are right it is not much a sensible reason, but it is one, just a weak one.\n2. We are just talking about the PocketMine syntax. Plugins are never affected. We are talking about inconvenience to the PocketMine contributors, not to plugin developers, so we don't need PhpStorm to convert it because @shoghicp did that for us. We are talking about the inconvenience on contribution.\n3. Developers have to adapt what? We are talking about contributors, not plugin developers.\n. @Falkirks yes, but both spaces and tabs are proper syntax and formatting accepted generally around the world, even though people have different opinions on using which one of them. At least, the rules stated that to ease plugin reviewers' reading, and both tabs and spaces function that. So far the only advantage I can see about reading is with disagreement with tab size, and this doesn't affect plugin reviewers.\nAlso, the point about the disagreement of tab size does not affect in this case because:\n1. The tab size can be adjusted just like tabs can be adjusted to spaces.\n2. We are only indenting at the start of line! How on earth does that affect?\n@sekjun9878 OK\n. @lesander #2116 is a separate PR (maybe an RFC too) not related to this.\n. Doesn't this issue already exist?\n. Read the contributing guidelines before submitting an issue. This error is caused by a plugin.\n. Please close the issue.\n. Is it that the non-op player doesn't have permission to build in that area? What about placing other blocks?\n. The best solution to this is:\nphp\npublic function internalPublicFunction(SomeEventSubclass $event, $pocketmineDontRegisterMe = null){\n}\nBut the @nonhandler tag doesn't seem to do any damage while it is most convenient to (especially lazy) developers.\n. This, still, does almost no harm to the server except one more RegExp check when enabling a plugin. I don't see a reason not merging this, since commands in plugin.yml is encouraging laziness in the first place \n. It is.\n. read the guidelines before creating an issue. This is not a support or Q&A forum/channel/page. Read the contributing guidelines, please.\n. This is duplicated.\n. Can you provide anything except the encrypted memory dump?\n. Same with Item::setCount() and Item::setDamage()\n. 1. This is not the place to solve your problem. It is to report bugs.\n2. For diamond issue, check if it still exists after the player disconnects and reconnects.\n3. One issue for one bug.\n4. Please read the contributing guidelines before creating an issue.\n. Would this large amount of events show down the server? As I see, the events seem to be triggered very frequently.\n. Please read all of the two points before adding to statistics:\n- For adding this feature, I vote YES.\n- For enabling by default, I vote NO, but with an addition that it should be done as an advanced property (hidden when generated), not as a general option like port and server name and motd blah.\nI agree that the software should contain auto-updating feature. However, I do not think that it is urgent or in a high priority. Currently the development is going slow. I don't think this part would take a lot of time, but personally I think that the team should implement this later. Yet, in the long term, I vote yes.\nI vote disabling by default, reasons same with @Falkirks in this issue.\nI request that it be advanced property because people may not know what danger it may cause (and enable it once they see it without understanding the potential dangers/disadvantages). If it is shown directly, it is almost same as default yes because auto-update sounds so harmless. We need to ensure informed choice.\n. @shoghicp so still, can it be hidden by default?\n. @alejandroxin93 that is C++, not PHP... -_-\" :facepunch: \n. @Emberous please stop closing it.\n. This is expected, and we cannot improve it due to Mojang issues.\n. Exactly because it isn't a forum, it is a read and valid issue because nobody commented or closed this issue. If there is a comment, most likely there is something you did wrong.\n. Maybe this can be a patch in PocketMine-Soft?\n. Item::get() does not work for all IDs. Why not directly $item = $event->getItem()?\n. Duplicated issues. Search issues before creating.\n. On the bug report page, it says to search for duplications before creating.\n. This may be a plugin problem, or it may be a duplication of other issues.\n. Most likely you did it wrongly\n. Oops.\n. You are mixing the old binaries and new code together.\n. You are providing no data. Also, occasionally players can't join. Please read the contributing guidelines before creating an issue.\n. This is not a support channel.\n. The issue is duplicated.\n. The issue already exist . Read the contributing guidelines before creating an issue.\n. Yes. Report issues only on development builds. Issues on older builds most likely have already been fixed in development builds.\n. It should be part of the unimplemented entity physics.\n. Please go here for translation.\n. Closed.\n. It has too many commits.\n. @Falkirks ease of typing maybe\n@sekjun9878 why would it? It wouldn't. Functions in PHP are case-insensitive, or every plugin will break because of @shoghicp using __HALT_COMPILER() instead of __halt_compiler() in DevTools and ConsoleScript.\n. PocketMine doesn't read blocks. It sends blocks to the client as-is. It is the client that doesn't read the blocks maybe?\nWhat do you mean \"read block\"?\n. @jose-vm that has nothing to do with PocketMine. As I said, PocketMine sends blocks as-is from the chunk files, and do not do any translation or interpretation of IDs except changing from Anvil format (if true) to MCPE FullChunkDataPacket format.\n. :+1:\nBTW @PocketMine you should make it show $e->getMessage() too.\n. What version are you using?\n. This is an issue tracker not a question tracker. Do not ask questions here. It's written in the contributing guidelines.\n. This is not a forum. Asking questions here will not be answered, and these issues will be closed and locked as they violate the contributing guidelines.\n. Moreover, it is in the wrong direction :P\n.  (tried to allocate 131072 bytes) note the number.\n. @ijoshuahd no. In fact, this doesn't change how PocketMine works.\n$level->getBlock() reads the block ID and damage from the level provider (you can understand as from read the files) and creates/clones a new Block object to represent the numbers. To make the server faster/use less memory by not reading again, PocketMine now saves the created objects in a cache array and use them later instead.\nHowever, when we read bulks of blocks from the level, we may only need the ID and damage values once, but if PocketMine saves the objects every time, these unnecessary objects will not be collected by the Garbage Collector, and eventually the server will run out of memory.\nOne may argue that bulk reading can be done by fetching from the level provider directly, but providing an API function is never bad.\nThis only adds an if(!$variable) check every normal call and is backwards-compatible. It in fact does not make the server slower in any observable degree, and it is not any of the intensively called code like network tick functions or so (it should not be, or server will always run out of memory). It does no harm to merge this pull request.\n. This is an invalid issue. Error to bind is because possibly another server is running on that port or your own networking problems, and this is not a place to ask questions.\n. Issue duplicated.\n. PocketMine doesn't have a password system. Is that even your own server? PocketMine doesn't force users to use SimpleAuth.\n. Use the beta. The stable version is obsolete as said in the installer download page.\n. This issue is duplicated.\nAnd apple refund? Did you pay for PocketMine?\n. Your own server run out of memory.\n. Translate at http://translate.pocketmine.net not here.\n. Delete the server-ip line. Please close the issue.\n. What plugins do you have in your server?\n. Then close it. :)\n. @WhiteWolfOwner for the last time, this is not a support channel or a forum. If you continue to use this issue tracker like a forum or ask for individual help here, you may be blocked from PocketMine GitHub.\n. I reproduced this issue. I started the server and left it alone (no players joined at all) for two minutes, then it stops responding to commands. Load is still jumping between 0%, 0.4%, etc. The only plugin used is this build of xEcon.\nI can't find the original issue to comment at.\n. Is this issue totally PHP's issue?\n. @llj070 do that with a plugin.\n. This is a duplicated issue and should be closed.\n. @adraozkal what commit are you using?\n.  Using PocketMine-Soft?\n. Maybe you can return $default directly rather than defining an addition $return.\n. I'm self-taught too. But since $default isn't accepted with reference, it won't lead to other bugs.\n. @TruDan you don't need to merge newest commits from master because they will be merged when the pull request is accepted. You are just making more commits in the history because a merge commit will be made anyway (unless they mergee it from command line).\n@64FF00 OK, you are the most useless self-taught programmar and I will be the msot useless self-taught programmer :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: \n. Didn't @ do its job?\n. Oh, they removed it...\n. This is duplication of #2365.\n. Your server is running out of memory.\n. This is not a place to help you fix your own errors. Possibly your server doesn't have enough memory to use.\n. Please read the contribution guidelines before submitting an issue.\n. From my recent experience in writing plugins, it occurred to me that it is easier to handle exceptions like this rather than doing a try-catch block for every event handler, especially when a plugin has many handlers like this. Moreover, like what I mentioned in the PR description, I added this feature mainly to do things like filing crash reports. This is when exceptions are not expected.\n. You may also want to merge branch PEMapModder:onError-consume-function instead. It changes the method of consuming an error from returning false to calling PluginError::consume().\n. Your plugins are having errors. Read the contributing guidelines; this page is not for plugin support. Contact the developers of the plugin instead.\nBut most likely, in this case, you are installing the plugins wrongly. Our help forum may help you.\nEdit: contact your web hosting provider if you didn't install the plugins yourself.\n. This is not a support forum.\n. Your server does not have enough memory. This is not a bug\n. Duplication of #2383, #2386 and #2389 (this issue isn't #2392 :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:)\n. @shoghicp go.\n. Do players timeout?\n. ## I am not a vote. Don't count me.\nMCPE also has betas of alpha. Although it is officially called a snapshot, or a \"build\", it is unofficially called betas of MCPE. Seems nobody cares if it is alpha. Maybe when it comes to beta they will just call it the beta of the beta. Since alpha and beta, as version names, are large things that won't change in a long period, there shouldn't be much clash between the two usages.\n. You mean you see the blocks but they are permeable in your client so you fell, or it suddenly teleports you to the bottom?\n. > Perhaps a server is already running on that port?\nClose other instances of PocketMine, and close all MCPE clients connecting to your network (or at least don't let them open any worlds, or turn off local multiplayer). This is your own issue. If you need further support, go to the forums.\n. Submit the crash dump or provide appropriate steps to reproduce it.\n. You are using an obsolete version. Download a beta or development build.\n. this is a duplicated issue. Please submit issues with reference to the contributing guidelines in the future.\n. What about the data above that line?\n. Your server doesn't have enough memory. It is your own problem of not allocating enough memory, not a bug.\n. There may be some packet loss or network issues that make your server's position is unsynchronized with your client. PocketMine detects it and reverts it so that the client is back at the position where the server thinks it is.\nYou can prevent this reverting by using PocketMine-Soft, although it may have unexpected consequences.\nThis is not a server bug and this issue should be closed.\n. \\1. is reported already.\n. also @MegaSamNinja the syntax is wrong, the last .\n. @Alcatraz-Du do not report duplicated issues. And closed issues mean they are either invalid or fixed. \n. Chunks are not supposed to be loaded if nobody is using them...\n. Increase your memory limit. This is not a PocketMine issue.\nAbout console being stuck, there is a duplicated issue. Use the latest build.\n. But can the players still join? If they can, it is not a memory issue. Search for the issues before creating one (about deafconsole).\n. It is /ban-ip\nUse /help for help.\n. Yes I saw it.\n. It is a system-dependent problem. This may be a bit help. This is not a support forum for plugins or individual issues. This is not related to EssentialsPE either.\n. @Falkirks isn't this issue about droppable glass/glass pane, which was fixed by @Intyre in a recent commit? Did you reference the wrong issue?\n. @shoghicp :+1: \n. Try reinstalling using the provided installer.\n. What is the cause exactly? \"Client disconnect\"?\n. 1. Please follow the format as specified in the contributing guidelines.\n2. You disallowed reasons with multiple words.\n3. This should be done via a plugin.\n. No, you should kick the player.\nhttps://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/blob/master/src/pocketmine/Player.php#L2024-2027\nFrom the above link, we can see that PocketMine does not seem to detect if a player is banned when he dies.\n. https://github.com/LDX-MCPE/PocketMine-MP/pull/1\n. This is not the place to ask for help. If you need help, please visit the forums.\nPlease follow the contributing guidelines for this repository next time.\n. @WhiteWolfOwner did you do /save-on?\n. And the comment is irrelevant.\nIf it isn't your server, don't report. It may be the other server doing that on purpose. And this issue is about light population. Your comment is irrelevant.\n. It is a client-side issue. PocketMine doesn't control how the player eats. (Use absence of network latency as proof)\n. Any stack trace or crash report on archive?\n. But right now?\nAnd what about the getLength() function? It is not possible to get the length from a plugin without using reflections or copying the numbers; and copying them doesn't seem to be a good idea, because this should be done by an API instead.\n. Why are there so many empty lines before the EOF? To get contribution lines?\nAnd right now this is useless unless you use it somewhere.\n. Good. Minecraft is now more realistic. :)\n. This is not a help forum. Please use our forums for that purpose.\n. Technically they aren't called \"hackers\". They are just people who use mods.\n. Full Chunk?\n.

You mean simply your console commands are ignored?\n. An error occurred with one of the plugins. We don't support plugins here.\n. He said \"can't login to the server\", which means it's a plugin causing infinite loops. It is most likely caused by a plugin.\n. This is not a support forum. Please go to the help forum if you want to get help or if you want to find someone to help. Support should not be provided here.\n. Or should the events start from ExceptionEvent and not be limited to plugin-related exceptions?\n. This pull request appears to be too obsolete.\n. We do not provide support for plugins (the /home command) here. Please read creating an issue.\nAs for rejoining at main spawn, you have a problem with your plugins. Please use our Help Forum for support.\n. Maybe using (int) is better than using floor().\n. @Falkirks \nX => floor\nY => round\nZ => floor\n```\nG G G\n   X\nG G G\nG G G\n```\nSuppose bottom left corner is x.0,z.0, X would be placed outside if we use round().\nFor the Y, it is in case the block fell a bit more than the ground, then it would get sucked into the ground. Assuming that the block won't fall more than 0.5 block in a tick, rounding Y is more suitable.\n. Actually, PocketMine needs better implementation for armor. Right now armor protection is constant, rather than proportional to the damage value.\n. Duplicated issue.\n. This applies to most damage tyeps other than normal PvP. This has been confirmed and is being fixed.\n. -that's because of lag\n-that's MCPE bug\n-are you using hardcore? are you sure they are \"banned\"?\n-we do not support plugins here. /home is a plugin command and not supported by PocketMine officially.\nPlease submit issues one by one.

Please read the contributing guidelines before creating an issue. We do not support plugins here, nor do we provide individual support in an issue tracker.\n. This is not a support channel. Please read the contribution guidelines before creating an issue, and follow them. We will not provide support on GitHub. Read the guidelines if you want to know where to get help from.\n. The guidelines are hyperlinked in the comment above. Please do not comment on this issue anymore, as we do not provide support here.\n. In the line commented, PocketMine attempts to convert them to string. This is not possible in my test with PHP 5.6.4.\n. CallbackTask can still be considered as part of API, because there may be some schedules that a plugin wants to run even after being disabled. For example, a plugin that wants to do something after an event is executed - and if cancelled, after being cancelled properly - in the current API, needs to run that one tick later; and even if the plugin is disabled, that thing still needs to be run. (For example, setting block drops needs to use that method, although this example is only because of the API being incompleted, but there are still other examples) This is when it is necessary to use a non-PluginTask schedule.\nBy the way, you should allow these Task classes to implement a getName() method for TaskHandler::getTaskName().\n. This is not a support forum. Please read the contributing guidelines before creating an issue.\n. Do you mean it doesn't always touch and be absorbed by the victim?\n. This is a duplication of #2172. Please search for similar issues before creating an issue.\n. This is not a help forum. Do not create help request here in the future. If you can't join a server, it is most likely your own problem not a bug since obviously other people can.\n. Please read the Contribution Guidelines before creating an issue. Plugins are not supported on this bug tracker. And this is not where support is provided; this is a bug tracker, not a support channel.\n. You are using an internal IP.\nRead the docs if you are confused with using PocketMine.\nUse our forums if you need help.\nRead the contributing guidelines before creating an issue.\n. This issue is duplication of #2828 #2815 #2798 #2795 #2782. And you have already submitted the issue #2798 for exactly the same thing 14 days ago. Please do not submit duplicated issues. Read the contributing guidelines before creating an issue.\n. Does this issue happen if you add a plugin that calls PlayerInteractEvent->setInstaBreak(true)?\n. It appears that the issue originates from the server lag. PocketMine assumes that player packets are sent to the server immediately, or at least, with the same latency. In that case, the server can measure the time the player used to break the block, and hence defend against an insta block-breaking mod. Nevertheless, it seems that lag makes this feature a bug.\n. They have invalid parameters set for stone blocks. It is already, or soon (like in one or two days) fixed.\n. Use translate.pocketmine.net\n. This is not a place to ask questions. And please go to http://translate.pocketmine.net to translate.\n. Is your task scheduled?\n. Then please create another issue with a script plugin to reproduce this bug.\n. Duplicated issue.\n. Rebase the 10 commits into one.\n. This is not handled by PocketMine.\n. @LDX-MCPE you don't need to edit start.sh to enable the loop. You can start the server with ./start.sh -l, where the -l option would set DO_LOOP to \"on\".\n. and the fact is numbers with colors in chat have a problem rather than the server sending wrongly? (I guess)\n. @Nicholas20006 this is not a support channel. Please read the contribution guidelines before creating an issue. This is a bug tracker not a question tracker.\n. @WhiteWolfOwner this is a bug tracker, not a forum. Don't go anywhere posting replies like on a forum. Read this.\n. Are you sure they are invisible or are they somewhere else? Possible duplicate of the clone issue.\n. Use spawnToAll or spawnTo instead. showPlayer won't spawn if the server thinks the player is already visible.\nAlso your method doesn't work with multi-world.\n. Does that happen without any plugins at all?\n. This still happens on my clone that uses the latest commit on the master branch with only start.sh slightly modified to pull the latest commit every restart. The world works well before.\n. Isn't this fixed in the latest development build?\n. Worlds generated in 1.4 cannot be loaded with 1.5 because worlds from other builds are broken. Generate a new map instead.\n. But the \"You died\" screen appears? If that is the case, PocketMine has nothing to do with that.\n. Please use the latest stable/beta/development version...\n. It is PocketMine 1.4 (development version 1.5) now! PocketMine 1.3 is no longer supported.\n. Invalid but open?\n. This is a bug tracker not a support channel. Please read the contribution guidelines before creating an issue.\n. Wow! That's rare. :+1:\n(Using a fast system reduces the chance of having this)\n. Possible reasons:\n- you didn't register the listener\n- the player shows death screen but server doesn't think it dies. Client-side issue, won't fix.\n. Crashing is most likely an MCPE client-side issue.\nAlso, one issue for one issue, please.\n. The title should be corrected to villagers instead of citizens.\n. This seems to be a client-side issue.\n. What version?\n. The argument list was created according to that of the constructor.\nClosed due to missing use statement of Vector3\n. Suppose you should use setRespawnPosition instead?\n. The NPC interface is about NPC entities, e.g. Villagers.\nThis is not a place for asking these questions, and this is an invalid pull request.\nPlease read the contribution guidelines before creating an issue.\n. Yes you can join. At least, other people can. So if you can't, it is your own problem.\n. @shoghicp Then why not PharFileInfo? Its functions are quite interesting as well.\n. Write your own class :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: \n. @RandomAltThing this is not a help forum.\n. The dimensions will be dynamic, or fixed to overworld and nether?\n. This is not a forum. Secret only means that it is not pushed to a public repo branch yet. Probably because they aren't stable yet.\n. @alejandroliu :+1:\n. There is no hate involved.\nThis is an MCPE issue, and it is not related to PocketMine.\n. @shoghicp since most of the community doesn't seem to hate it, I think you'd better keep it.\n. Obsolete pull request, code is now already present.\n. It is part of the API.\n. This is not a place to ask questions. Please read the contribution guidelines before creating an issue.\n. Where should it be if it isn't master?\n. @Addison118 it appears that your knowledge on object-oriented programming as in PHP 5 is very inadequate. Please note that PocketMine-MP, since Zekkou Cake, from internal framework to external API, is very object-oriented. It seems like you don't even understand inheritance.\nAlso, most of the events that you created are already covered by existing events such as EntityDamageEvent.\nAbout only declaring events, it appears that you are only creating events whenever they come to your mind. Without the real code being written, creating the events before writing the real code only makes coding more difficult, because events are usually closely related to how the code is written. For example, you won't realize that you do not want to let plugins cancel some specific events until you are actually making it. Furthermore, PocketMine API is in some ways based on/modelling the Bukkit API.\nOn the other hand, please carefully review the contribution guidelines before creating a pull request.\n@iksaku @Addison118 @Gamecrafter please note that GitHub is not a forum. If you are going on flame wars, find a real battlefield. GitHub is too cool to withstand flame.\n. 1. If you know well about object oriented PHP, you wouldn't override your own inherited functions.\n2. VehicleDamageEvent is a duplicate of EntityDamageEvent.\n. Could you please put the crash dump between two ``` lines? It makes it much easier to read. (Edit it)\nIt seems like a block below a carpet is broken, and the carpet updates to break, and somehow it caused the block below it (Block(571)) to break again?\n. The startup time? Related to the installer?\n. Since #3323 is closed, I suppose this can be closed as well.\n. It is a client-side message. That probably means your client's time is out of sync with the server.\n. Please use English here.\n. @RandomAltThing all that you mentioned should be done with plug-ins.  Except /gamerule,which is in the TODO list already. \n. Cannot reproduce the part about /banlist.\n. This is an issue that belongs to PocketMine-Language rather than PocketMine-MP.\n. PocketMine is coded to simulate behaviour by MCPE vanilla servers. If you would like to see an additional feature, please make a plugin.\n. Use a plugin. \n. Please enable debug (change 1 to 2) in pocketmine.yml. Next time it happens, post the stack trace here with more information.\n. Fixed in cfca0a8\n. @SimHotMinerYT @RandomAltThing Please read the contributing guidelines thoroughly  before creating an issue or commenting on it. \n. @SimHotMinerYT please read the contributing guidelines. You are submitting duplicated issues,  and you should create one issue per issue. \n. Permission node a.b.c.d must be the child of permission node a.b.c.  It is a standard. \n. :+1:\n. Make pull requests? \n. The problem is, this isn't his pull request at all. He only tries to merge things from a branch to another branch while he didn't make the commits. This should be closed.\n. Do you have chunk-ticking enabled in pocketmine.yml?\n. @Chiwaii we don't support plugins here.\n. Add 0.5 to x and z. This is how MCPE handles it.\n. It is for the convenience in code. Say, if a player is standing at 3.*, 4.*, 5.*, we can directly tell that he is standing in the block at 3, 4, 5.\n. This issue is duplicated.\n. Also, if this PR is going to be merged, please review the more-armor branch on my fork. It is based on this damager-multiplier branch.\n. This elaborates the point of multipliers:\nPlugins usually try to modify the damage dealt in the MODIFIER_BASE section directly, especially when multiplying. They rarely consider about other modifiers. This update gives convenience to plugins, as well as greater compatibility among different plugins.\nAlso, I have a question. Why are modifiers limited to several types?\n. You are using a bugged plugin, misusing a plugin or didn't op yourself. This is not a support channel. PocketMine is running correctly for the rest of the servers so this isn't a PocketMine issue. Please read the contribution guidelines before creating an issue.\n. Read:\n\nTHIS CRASH WAS CAUSED BY A PLUGIN\n\nPlease read the contribution guidelines before creating an issue. We do not support plugins here.\n. This issue is duplicated.\n.

If we put viruses here in purpose, we shall never tell you we do.\n. What? if(is_null($this))?\n. @mwvent if it is null, there isn't an object at all. If it isn't an object, you won't have the chance to call from its context.\nAlso, we are fixing the issue at the @LegendOfMCPE team.\n. @shoghicp I just looked at the code a bit, and realized that the hasPermission method and relevant methods come from the Permissible interface. However, it appears that if you hold a Permissible object (or more practically, a CommandSender object), you are unable to check whether the object is still permissible (permission operations can still be operated upon it), unless you explicitly check !($permissible instanceof Player) or $permissible->isOnline(), which does not seem to be the best thing that can appear in code. I am suggesting that if you are doing this, you'd better also add a function like isOnline or isAvailable at the Permissible interface.\nI am working on a plugin that allows command senders to instantiate a new CommandSender, whose permissions inherit the ones from the parent command sender. The implementation is something like this:\n``` php\nclass CommandControlledUser implements CommandSender{\n    /* @var CommandSender /\n    private $parent; // I really want to use WeakRef for this :(\npublic function isPermissionSet($name){\n    return $this->parent->isPermissionSet($name);\n}\npublic function hasPermission($name){\n    return $this->parent->hasPermission($name);\n}\npublic function addAttachment(Plugin $plugin, $name = null, $value = null){\n    return $this->parent->addAttachment($plugin, $name, $value);\n}\npublic function removeAttachment(PermissionAttachment $attachment){\n    $this->parent->removeAttachment($attachment);\n}\npublic function recalculatePermissions(){\n    $this->parent->recalculatePermissions();\n}\npublic function getEffectivePermissions(){\n    return $this->parent->getEffectivePermissions();\n}\npublic function isOp(){\n    return $this->parent->isOp();\n}\npublic function setOp($value){\n    $this->parent->setOp($value);\n}\n\n}\n```\nI had thought of making $this->parent a WeakRef, but I had heard that this extension is not supported in future releases. I had also thought of garbage-collecting these command-controlled users upon player disconnection, but what about non-player command senders? For example, if someone makes an IRC bridge (that starts up an IRC server, not client), he may create a class IRCComamndSender implements CommandSender, and when the IRC command sender executes a command that creates a CommandControlledUser for them, I don't think it is possible to know about the disconnection of the IRC command sender, and when someone attempts to do something upon this obsolete command-controlled user from the IRC command sender, such as from a scheduled task, there is no way to check whether the IRC user is still permissible.\n\nOf course, other problems arise from a similar situation too. For instance, the command-controlled user will not be collected, and eventually results in memory leak. This is an issue with the CommandSender API itself.\n. PluginDescription would automatically cast it to an array. \n. Please read the contributing guidelines before creating an issue.

This is not a forum. This is not a place to help people.\n. This is a plugin issue. If you want to know which plugin caused it, please find a crash dump that has more backtrace.\n. This issue is caused by plugins assuming the player is still online while the player is already offline, hence the permission base being deleted by PocketMine.\n. @SeangJemmy that has nothing to do with memory at all...\n. It is apparently a server side issue. If the server does something that is not expected but it is possible to do otherwise, it is a server side issue. Even changes in the protocol should be regarded as server side issues.\n. Should have been resolved in #3978 \n. addItem is supposed to send the item. It isn't proper to fix the bug without fixing the API function addItem itself.\n. You have to chown it.\nIt isn't PocketMine issue anyway.\n. I don't see any reason this pull request fixed anything \n. @legoboy0215 please note that this is not a forum.\n@willowmaster66 but that doesn't seem necessary. You could just change the hardness of the block.\n. @SkygridRex please note that this is an issue tracker, not a forum.\n. Removes redundant parameters? It would be really pointless to keep telling developers to find an entity object (although it can be self) just for piling up the parameter count.\n. @shoghicp any changes with the signature still would break BC. Even a null default or a type hint change would.\n. This is an issue with the download server, not with the PocketMine software itself.\n. This is not a forum or support channel. Please use the forums or the IRC channel if you wish to get support.\n. The plugin attempts to change the player's gamemode during/after the player quits the server.\n. @flash586 please read the contribution guidelines before creating an issue. This place is not for asking questions.\n. This is an issue tracker. Using plugins does not help with solving the issue on PocketMine.\n. @Creeperface01 I think the event is called in heal(). https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/blob/f7ec1de0fd643b9543461eaf3a4e2d3c49b5dcd7/src/pocketmine/entity/Entity.php#L598\nPlease read the contribution guidelines before creating a pull request.\n\n\nCreate a single branch for that pull request\n. @SkygridRex please note that this is not a help forum.\n. This is not the proper way to fix the issue.\n. :+1:\nI wonder why it didn't crash before.\n. Please note that this is not a forum.\n. This is not a forum. Please stop commenting on an invalid issue. \n. @MagicDroidX the Player object is constructed when a connection is registered, even before the username is sent.\n. Trailing spaces should just be removed :cry: many IDEs do that automatically\n. @astersx this is not a forum. And this issue not being closed means that it is being investigated at.\n. @TahaTheHacker this is a bug tracker for tracking PocketMine bugs, not for providing support. Using a plugin doesn't fix a bug in PocketMine itself.\n. This is not a forum. Please do not create issues for help, and please do not comment like this is a forum. You are sending notifications to 200 watchers of this forum, where most of them only watched to see real issues and commits, not to see help requests and people trying to help. \n. Why does this cause an issue? __destruct is only called when there are completely no (strong) references to the object. And putting an empty method there doesn't seem to help. Can you explain more?\n. Nobody is using Plugin::getLogger() as a static method... We are just referring to that method, not using that code directly...\n. @LDX-MCPE it happened in 1.3 because the Plugin interface did indeed have a __destruct method.\n. Please read the contribution guidelines: open one issue for each bug.\nSome of the things listed above are unimplemented features, which should not be reported here.\nSome of them are already reported.\n. The only exceptional case I can imagine is a root key ending with a backslash, which is very unreasonable (much more unreasonable than having keys with periods)\n. @thebigsmileXD how to reproduce this issue? Is this caused by kicking a player during firing an EntityDamageByEntityEvent?\n\n\nAnd the crash dump shows that there are 55 plugins used.\n.

This is caused by plugins kicking players in EntityDamageByEntityEvent. Therefore, I label this as an API issue, since it makes it impossible for plugins to kick players in the event.\n. @thebigsmileXD that is not possible. If inventory is null, that means either the player has not logged in or the player has left. This may (or more likely may not due to prior checks before handling the packet) be used to attack the server. I can't think of any other cases that this is possible that a client sends an INTERACT_PACKET when he is offline?\nPlease make sure that you reproduced that exact error with vanilla PocketMine.\n. @thebigsmileXD I don't understand why the inventory field would suddenly become null. The only write access to it that can null it is the close() method. But if the player is closed, he must not have a packet received. In conclusion, the only possible place that the inventory is nulled is when a plugin closed the player.\nNow, before trying to insist that this issue exists on vanilla, why not actually try to reproduce it on vanilla again? Otherwise, as a non-reproducible and unreasonable issue, not even concrete evidence that it exists, we have no reason to believe that it wasn't you got the crash without realizing that you actually had plugins in that server.\n. This is still an existent issue on the API perspective. We are working on a solution to let EntityDamageEvent handlers and other event handlers to kick the player gracefully without scheduling a kick task, without removing the = null; line, and without checking if null every single time.\n. @Intyre I believe that making a Wiki page for that is more effective.\n. I dumped the detected IDs using this script.\nhttps://gist.github.com/PEMapModder/30858989dacc97d6b942\nThe output can be found in the gist as well.\n. I have written a script to generate classes for each unnamed item. You can find the base64 of the zip created here. https://gist.github.com/PEMapModder/30858989dacc97d6b942/#file-gen-zip-base64\n. Fix in #3546\n. The event is called in Entity->attack. You don't need to explicitly call it, or it will fire twice.\n. If you don't know the cause of the issue, then you are only silencing the bug with the possibility of leaving the bug there causing more trouble in the future, where it will become even harder to resolve the issue as there will be no errors.\n. So is this a confirmed issue, and is the source of the issue (PocketMine or MCPE) located?\n. Can no longer be reproduced\n. Didn't notice I'm duplicating the IDs.\n. @willowmaster66 the Minecart is not a block. It is an entity. But when you have crafted a Minecart in your inventory, it is an Item.\n. @willowmaster66 yes, but a minecart item is only used as an Item in this class. For the minecart entity, it should be implemented in another class just like arrow.\n. :+1: \nBut can you indent the code a bit better please?\n. You are using an outdated version of PocketMine. Please only report issues in the development build.\n. I believe this is a client issue, nothing to do with PocketMine.\nAlso, clients are expected to have noclip enabled in spectator mode.\n. Cannot be reproduced\n. This issue is caused by adding an extra space behind the command.\nI reproduced this even just with one player:\n\"/tp pemapmodder pemapmodder \"\nNote the space before the closing \"\nFixed in ffa835d\n. @CaptainKenji17 then comment on the old issue.\n. Please provide steps to reproduce this issue?\n. If this is merge, it is likely that a conflict would occur when mcpe-0.12 is merged into master or the other way round. Also, you are not the author of this commit.\nSo instead, you should create a pull request to merge MagicDroidx:patch-3 into mcpe-0.12 or master into mcpe-0.12, instead of creating a new commit.\n. @MagicDroidX this is not a forum. This issue has definitely nothing to do with 32/64-bit specific things.\n. The class exists here just to let the item be shown in chat with the proper item name instead of Unknown.\n. There is an mcpe-0.12 branch for more 0.12 (and before) items. Please pull request there instead.\n. Please style the code properly. Read the contribution guidelines for instructions.\n. Please do everything in the same commit.\nIn case you need help to checkout a non-master branch on your local repository:\nbash\ngit remote add base https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP.git\ngit fetch base\ngit checkout remotes/base/mcpe-0.12\ngit checkout -b mcpe-0.12-patch-1\n. Please stop making duplicated pull requests.\n. @skygridrex this is not a forum. Please stop commenting things irrelevant or not constructive to fixing the issue on PocketMine itself.\n. Please do not add debug messages into the commits\n. Should not be in this branch.\n. This is indeed an issue PocketMine can try to prevent, but, https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/blob/master/src/pocketmine/Player.php#L1683 already closes the player, why would a plugin close the player in the first place?\n. @thebigsmileXD Player.php runs $this->close() if PlayerPreLoginEvent or PlayerLoginEvent is cancelled. As for PlayerJoinEvent, it is not cancellable at all.\n5baa87e9febc7312406e8ca263af292136c01ad4 doesn't make $this->inventory null. The issue now is that $this->inventory is null.\n. THe problem in #3609 is that Player->inventory is null. The code here doesn't seem to fix the issue.\n. This is an issue tracker, not a place to ask for help. If you need help, please use the forums or the IRC channel. Read https://GitHub.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#creating-an-issue\n. @SkygridRex please read my issue content. I said disk memory, which means that the whole system has no spare space, you cannot create another file, blah blah blah. Not RAM.\n. The item names can be found at Item.php (case-insensitive, e.g. diamond_sword). Keep in mind that in PocketMine commands, <parameter> usually means that a value with no spaces is expected.\nAlso, please check the usage of /give. There is no x.\nTherefore, the command should be /give mcstar777 diamond_sword 1. Throwing errors about incorrect usage is expected PocketMine behaviour, and this issue is invalid.\n. Branch mcpe-0.12?\n. Well, idk, but it appears that there isn't hunger until 0.12...\n. Please read the contribution guidelines before creating an issue - plugins are not supported here.\nAnwyay, try using the development build.\n. MCPE 0.12 support is being developed on another branch. Please do not open invalid issues.\n. The inherited events are not supposed to be declared with. Plugins should declare handlers with the event class with the $handlerList.\n. @Tee7even you should declare a handler for EntityDamageEvent. You can use it like this:\nphp\npublic function eventDamage(EntityDamageEvent $event){\n    if($event instanceof EntityDamageByEntityEvent){\n        // etc.\n    }\n}\nA developer who creates a handler for EntityDamageEvent expects to listen to all kinds of entity damages, including those from and not from another entity.\nIt is exactly the same theory that you wouldn't expect to have a plugin that handles Event and listen to all kinds of events.\n. EntityDamageByEntityEvent isn't supposed to be used by listeners directly.\n. @Tee7even it didn't work before. If you try to register an EntityDamageByEntityEvent listener, it did not generate a warning, but when an EntityDamageEvent occurs, it will still be passed to the listener and result in an E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR (not sure about the exception name) because of incompatible parameter types.\n. If it is an Arrow it wouldn't be a DroppedItem. This is not how you check whether an arrow is shot.\n. @willowmaster66 line 1299/1289?\n. According to the behaviour in MCPE, picking up arrows doesn't seem to have anything in common with picking up items except the entity despawning and the inventory change.\nWhy should MCPE apply TakeItemPacket to ArrowEntity? ArrowEntity isn't an item.\n. @Intyre players always get 0 for their own entity ID. 0 is a special entity ID, meaning \"self\".\nTakeItemEntityPacket is not supposed to be used with arrows in the first case. You made a mistake thinking a man is a woman, then you want him to wear a dress because you thought so? (OK, no sexual discrimination)\n. I believe that this PR just acts like a mechanism where you step on another entity and that entity dies/despawns. I don't see what's wrong to addn an item to an inventory of how despawning an entity can crash clients of cause other issues.\n. This is already implemented for both pocketmine.yml and server.properties.\n. @SkygridRex from the look of the code, I don't think anything could probably go wrong with that. But for your information, yes, a loose one.\n. @willowmaster66 what is this?\nphp\n                if(count($t) < 2){\n                    continue;\n                }\n. It doesn't actually affect a lot in terms of performance since it is only used in startup code (for core). But still, cleaner code is always better.\n. API_VERSION is not related to MCPE versions.\n. @SkygridRex @DRedDogPE this is not a forum.\n. Blocks like rails are not added because they are not supported yet.\nAlso, please, rebase your commits into one.\n. @SkygridRex he is not using this as a forum. He pointed out a possible improvement in the API. \n. The problem is that PocketMine ignores the action ID of the interact packet, so clicks and long clicks are considered as the same action of hitting.\n. This is actually possible with DataPacketReceiveEvent.\nNevertheless, it seems that PocketMine just forgot to check the action type.\n. I am unable to reproduce this issue in the php7-0.14 branch.\n. It is merged into the master branch anyway.\n. @thebigsmileXD but this issue is no longer reproducible, right? That may mean a change related to MCPE version, or a change at other parts of PocketMine core, or other things. As long as it is no longer reproducible, it doesn't really matter :P\n. Are you sure that the exactly same error occurs in the latest PocketMine version?\n. Fixed in #3956 \n. Cannot reproduce. Please comment here if issue persists.\n. @ArKh4n this place is for reporting issues, not for providing alternative solutions that do not correctly fix the issue.\n. @UltimateMcraft could you provide screenshots to explain the issue?\n. @TheDiamondYT1  this has been implemented.\n. I have reproduced this only with flint and steel.\n. @thebigsmileXD PocketMine does not use block states.\nBlock states are only used in the Minecraft game engine. According to Minecraft wiki:\n\n14w11a    Added block states. Only used in the game engine, not saved in world files or used in commands yet.\n\nActually, it seems like fire blocks are no longer ticked in PocketMine as of the current version?\n. @thebigsmileXD block states are an internal mechanism in Minecraft introduced in Minecraft 1.8. As far as I know, it doesn't exist in MCPE at all.\nBut indeed, PocketMine needs a way to properly handle fire ticking. But this shall not be done with block states.\nPerhaps with block damage? idk.\nFor further discussion, please talk on the IRC channel instead of using GitHub conversations to avoid sending notifications to watchers of this repo and spamming their dashboards.\n. @thebigsmileXD nope. Just too lazy to separate them into two commits as I already wrote the changes and they're in the same file, making it less easy to separate the changes :stuck_out_tongue: but anyway, there are two issues being fixed in this commit.\n. > Note: same content as what I wrote in #3721\nAfter PlayerPreLoginEvent is called here:\nIf the event is cancelled\n\nPocketMine will internally kick the player.\nPocketMine will stop handling the packet.\n\nIf the event is not cancelled\n\nPocketMine will not stop handling the packet\nPocketMine continues handling the login checks, until PocketMine attempts to subscribe the player to chat permissions, which involves a hasPermission call.\n\nUnlike what some would have guessed, it is not true that the permissible base is not initialized when the player is not logged in. Actually, Player->perm is one of the earliest fields initialized in the constructor, but is nulled when the player leaves, probably trying to prevent memory leak.\nThis pull request apparently prevents this error of hasPermission() on null from happening, but it is wrong anyway for PocketMine to attempt to run too much code (lines 1688-1847) pointlessly.\nActually, the state of events being dispatched is an awkward moment for well-documented APIs. For instance, when PlayerPreLoginEvent is being handled, does the player logging in get included in Server->getOnlinePlayers()? It sounds like the player is pre login, i.e. not logged in, so the player should not be considered as \"online\", but as a matter of fact, Server->addPlayer was triggered by RakLibInterface::openSession right after the construction of a Player object, and it is really awkward - as PlayerPreLoginEvent and getOnlinePlayers are loosely related, it is not reasonable to include such specific information about each other in their documentation.\nHere we have a similar case. It is perfectly reasonable to call kick on a player object anywhere, and it isn't too reasonable for PocketMine (but possible) to check if player has been closed after calling the events. It is neither the developer's nor PocketMine's obvious mistake, but it is preventable by explicitly checking it after calling an event.\n. This is an issue tracker nnot a forum. If you need help, please use the IRC channel or the forums.\n. Please stop...\n\n. Please specify the teleport() in which class next time.\n(I just looked: Entity::teleport() returns bool, it is correct. But the implementation in Player::teleport() doesn't.)\n. Fixed in c1a484ee5cb8705f03e5021a64fe824796dfee14. No idea why it didn't auto close this issue.\n. Wrong base?\n. For whoever trying to resolve this issue:\nThe error comes from this call:\n``` php\npocketmine\\level\\format\\mcregion\\Chunk->getBlockId(7, -1, 1);\npublic function pocketmine\\level\\format\\mcregion\\Chunk::getBlockId($x, $y, $z){\n    return ord($this->blocks{($x << 11) | ($z << 7) | $y});\n}\n```\nApparently -1 << 7 will fill the most significant bit, hence resulting in a -1 output.\nAn anterior call is from https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/blob/mcpe-0.12/src/pocketmine/level/Level.php#L2668 :\nphp\n$y = (int) min(126, $v->y);\n$wasAir = ($chunk->getBlockId($x, $y - 1, $z) === 0);\nSo a possible fix is to validate $y, so this is a possible change:\nphp\n$y = (int) min(126, $v->y);\n$wasAir = $y <= 0 or $chunk->getBlockId($x, $y - 1, $z) === 0;\n. Duplicate of #3686\n. The hotbar size depends on the GUI size. 9 is the maximum size possible (you can see taht in win10)\n. Also, the NBT structure follows the MCPC format, which is obviously 9 slots.\nAnd what are the problems that arise from it having 9 slots?\n. @thebigsmileXD what's wrong with having an item in your hotbar but you can't see it? As long as you aren't holding it is not a problem. You are always able to move items from other hotbar slots or not in hotbar slots into your current hotbar slot using MCPE GUI.\nBTW, if you adjust your D-Pad size you will have more or less slots.\n. This is a client issue. It is impossible for PocketMine to know what the client hotbar size is, so of course we would take the maximum possible value.\n. I had 5-7 slots since the update that let you adjust D-Pad size... Just try to adjust it yourself..\n. This is not 0.13 support.\n. This is not a forum.\n. I'm working on it\n. Fixed.\n. @iJoshuaHD I was unable to reproduce any container-related bugs. However, there were bugs with trapdoors, which I believe to be from original PocketMine.\n. I didn't notice any 0.13-related bugs with this version.\n. @AryToNeX according to my tests, this branch fixes skins. (I use Android)\n. Closed in the light of 2ea81710ad31d28dd934e7831a2419c8e70f77bd\n. Please stop spamming. You are annoying.\n. Please show full steps to reproduce this bug.\n. @aodzip the PocketMine Team is developing for 0.13, just that the commits aren't seen publicly because of instability.\n. Why did you try to merge my branch...\n. Not confirmed existent or nonexistent yet.\n. You should add both in the same commit and submit in a single pull request. Please read the contribution guidelines - one pull request per feature; one branch per feature.\n. I'm thinking about Level::scheduleUpdate($pos, 0)\n. ref: #3756\n. Resolved in #3783 \n. @GODLIKE5 does making PocketMine into a phar affect developing hunger at all?\n. @GODLIKE5 \n1. This is not a forum.\n2. Implementing hunger from a plugin is different from that in PocketMine itself.\n3. Actually, I'm implementing it now.\n. @GODLIKE5 this is not a forum.\n. Closed by #3758 \n. simple solution by echo \"extension=yaml.so\\nextension=pthreads.so\" >> /path/to/php.ini?\n. @thebigsmileXD sorry, blame my PhpStorm auto reformat :P\nI'll force-push a commit to fix it\nBut I'm unable to fix the issue where trailing spaces are deleted. Anyone would point it to me?\n. @thebigsmileXD I use autoformat on my own code, because I type $a=$b.$c; rather than $a = $b . $c; when I code, and then autoformat it to add the spaces. more efficient coding this way.\n. @SkygridRex see LegendOfMCPE/PocketMine-MP#2 - our understanding of redstone mechanics in Minecraft is that there are different levels of power as well as different types of charges.\n. Closed for incorrect base. Will open another PR on master when the branch looks a bit nicer.\n. Please read the contribution guidelines before creating an issue.\n. The port is already in use. Close the old server.\n. It appears that you are using an old server version. When the server starts, does it say server software for 0.11?\n. Fixed in #3723\n. It appears that ifconfig is not found if you are not running with root.\n. Fixed in e2f7d65\n. Use https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-SPL/tree/d59c0f673455f02b2620853f3fa6290d63ffd960 instead of the HEAD of PocketMine-SPL in that submodule.\n. Cannot be reproduced\n. @0929hitoshi are you sure? From what I see, this would send the number of days instead of the time in a day.\n. Tested?\n. @PocketKiller that's totally irrelevant.\n. As this pull request is not supported with sufficient elaboration, this is being closed.\n. Resolved in d5f3c19\n. @thebigsmileXD because we can't reproduce it on our side. Something is wrong with your config?\n. This would break backwards compatibility for plugins that do this too. Although it is not recommended, it indeed is not specified in docs that it is internal.\nI guess there should be another solution\n. And you expect us to hack into your computer to find out what is inside that file, since you aren't uploading it?\n. Also merged PocketMine:master into this PR.\nI would appreciate if anyone would help test this branch with a plugin that uses AsyncTask, to confirm that it works.\n. http://pastebin.com/gDHWj0Gb\nThis happened when I am testing with this branch. Not sure if it is caused by the changes in this PR yet.\nEdit: confirmed that the same configuration and maps cannot be reproduced on the master branch.\n. Confirmed that this works?\nI'm thinking of a condition where the update got scheduled for another reason...\n. The head tree is contaminated with irrelevant commits. Please open a pull request on a clean branch without irrelevant commits.\n. Wtf...\n. Just to ensure that you are reporting from the latest version.\n. Should have been resolved in #3978 \n. Please make this comment on the forums. This is not related to the code, which is what this issue tracker is for.\n. What? Version 1.3.1? \n. @Jorti1 PocketMine newest updates are development builds, not bleeding builds.\n. http://www.pocketmine.net/api/?channel=development\n\n\"alternate_download_url\": \"http://cdn.pocketmine.net/api/update-development.phar\"\n. @robske110 that has nothing to do with Jenkins...\n. Duplicate of #3749 \n. This is not a help forum. Please use the forums or the IRC channel for support.\n. Duplicate of #3173\n. Close the issue.\n. I think this pull request is duplicated.\n. But the item is not spawned in PlayerDropItemEvent. How could you get the entity? \nLet's say, what do you want the entity for? If the event is eventually cancelled, anything done on the entity would be meaningless and probably even cause bugs.\n. I'd just like to remind you that Item::getThrower() is supposed to return a string.\n. Replace download_url in the output of wget -O - get.pocketmine.net with alternate_download_url; it should work.\n. The issue is duplicated.\n. @thebigsmileXD then why you no PR it?\n. Should have been resolved in #3978\n. You should add a method instead of replacing the current one. The current one is here for IDEs to note that this method only returns a Player object. Although its declaration is redundant and backwards compatibility doesn't get affected by this pull request, you should keep it. (And it doesn't cause any more lag either)\n. The old one could be absent without implementation at all. It isn't deprecated.\n\nYou might need this in PHP 7 as overriding methods (can or cannot) change the return type signature.\n. Please remove the irrelevant commits in the branch.\n. 1. It appears that these are from ImagicalMine.\n2. One commit per feature, not one commit per file. And one pull request for everything. Please. Stop spamming.\n. Rebase your commits. It is unreasonable to merge 9 commits into the repo just for one feature.\n. I meant to combine your commits into one.\nOtherwise,the commit history will become very messy.\n. Look at https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/pull/3851/commits - this has 9 commits, including the one you made yourself that aren't related to this pull request. Any users interested in PocketMine's history may be confused by these unrelated commits.\n. You created your blockticking from a branch uneven from PocketMine master.\n. Try this:\ngit\ngit remote add base https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP.git\ngit checkout base/master\ngit checkout -b my-clean-master\n. Do you mean to open the source of the API within www.pocketmine.net?\n. This issue is invalid. It is not related to PocketMine itself. The issue tracker is for PocketMine-MP, not pocketmine.net\n. This issue is related to pocketmine.net SSL certificate, not PocketMine-MP itself. Stop submitting duplicated issues.\n(And http://www.pocketmine.net still works)\n. @thebigsmileXD @jingz2007 it seems that flower pots are not relevant to this issue. Please don't use the issue tracker as a forum.\nAs for the changes mentioned, it is more appropriate if you create the pull request first so that it can be reviewed directly.\n. Duplicate.\n. This is caused by a plugin, although it is unsure which plugin caused it.\nPlease read the contribution guidelines - do not submit issues caused by plugins.\n. Set the date.timezone property in php.ini, as the message says.\nAlso, please don't tag your issues with things like URGENT, as mentioned in the contribution guidelines.\nThis issue may spam the console, but it doesn't crash the server.\n. If it is, it is caused by something else. This warning related to timezone settings does not freeze or crash you.\n. If the level isn't loaded, the server has no knowledge that that level exists.\ngetLevels() returns Level[] -> there must be a Level object for that.\nIf the level isn't loaded, how come there is a Level object for it? That is the definition of \"loaded\". The server has nothing in memory about that at all if it is not loaded.\n. Autoloading worlds in the folder isn't an official functionality of PocketMine \n. Loading  every world in the folder is not a PocketMine functionality and had never been one, as I said. \nAlso, there has never been limitation that a level must be in the worlds folder. Crazy idea this is, one may load a level from a mongo database if a plugin adds that.\n. @thebigsmileXD can you elaborate more on the issue?\nFor discussion, let's go to a chat channel like IRC or Gitter.\n. @legoboy0215 are you sure it returns null rather than an empty array?\nJust like it is unreasonable to load all worlds in the worlds/ folder when nobody asked to load it, it is unreasonable to load all chunks in a world when nobody is using it.\n@thebigsmileXD I still don't understand how this happens to be a PocketMine issue rather than a plugin issue, when PocketMine is not in charge of loading all worlds in the folder, as a matter of fact. \nIf your call to getLevels() doesn't work, might it just be that your plugin is loaded before the plugin that loads the worlds after 0.11?\n. But the loading order might be changed...\nAnd please go to IRC for discussion.\n. MCPE maps are not supported on Android. They are only supported on Linux platforms (that do not include Android)\n. This is not a support channel. Please read the contribution guidelines.\n. All basic PHP syntax is supported by PocketMine. If it doesn't work for you, you are doing something wrong.\nPlease note that this is an issue tracker, not a help channel.\n. Actually, is there more than one bug? One issue per bug, please.\n. I suspect the issue related to array unpacking has been fixed by cfca0a8726418efb6990d9ba7da2c4397e8609b7. Please notify if the issue can still be reproduced.\n. Please comment to reopen if this issue can still be reproduced.\n. @Samueljh1 are you sure that \"Invalid garbage Chunk given to Entity\" is related to that PR?\n. @Samueljh1 so if you think that the issue persists, please provide the steps to reproduce the issue.\n. Cannot be reproduced.\n. never mind, just tested passing null works.\n. @Samueljh1 if one pull request is dependent on another, you must make them in the same pull request.\n. As this pull request alone is not meaningful, this is being closed.\n. This pull request requires the dependency of another pull request, hence the pull request head branch should be based on the other pull request so as to make this pull request valid.\n. Please base this on #3882. This pull request is invalid until it can independently function correctly. \n. Please read the contribution guidelines before creating an issue. Plugins are not supported here.\n. For some reason I forgot why, this pull request is contaminated with irrelevant changes such as changes to SetTimePacket. Closing. Redstone needs a better algorithm.\n. Probably fixed by #3978. Cannot reproduce.\n. Closing since a lot of blocks in this pull request already exist. For blocks that don't exist yet, either synchronize this pull request or make another pull request that does not have any conflicts with the current codebase.\n. Do you mean any ports higher than 32767?\n. This issue should be reported in RakLib.\nPocketMine/RakLib#16\n. I am experiencing deja vu reading this. Is this duplicated?\n. I think it is more meaningful to directly create the pull request than creating an issue to ask if the pull request can be created.\n. Please indent code with tabs.\n. Don't worry, I fixed it in the merge commit.\n. This issue is caused by the SimpleAuth plugin. Please do not submit plugin related issues here.\n. @OnlyZeNo this issue is entirely caused by SimpleAuth, and by uninstalling SimpleAuth properly it can be resolved.\nPlease read the contribution guidelines before creating an issue or commenting on an issue.\n. > 31.01 22:24:00 [Server] Server thread/WARNING RuntimeException: \"Illegal offset type in unset\" (E_WARNING) in \"/SimpleAuth_v1.7.1.phar/src/SimpleAuth/task/ShowMessageTask\" at line 46\nExplain how there would even be a message about SimpleAuth if you removed it properly? There is definitely nothing about SimpleAuth in PocketMine source.\nPlease confirm that you have completely restarted the server and SimpleAuth is nowhere to be found inside your server directory.\n. @OnlyZeNo when you execute /plugins, is SimpleAuth there?\n. There is another server on the same port. Please read the message. This is not a PocketMine issue. To get support, please refer to the contribution guidelines.\n. @Samueljh1 a command sender is not necessarily a player. For example, I would store the sender name \"CONSOLE\", but I cannot get the command sender instance back if I don't hold an object reference to it.\n. @Samueljh1 who told you that the command sender is either a player or console (or RCON, if you are arguing)? It can be any class, including classes that implement CommandSender, from plugins.\nIt can of course be done by hardcoding to detect player or console, but then the plugin won't know what to do if there is a third (OK, fourth) type of command sender. The meaning of an interface is that everyone can make a class that implements it and pass an instance of class to a function that expects an instance of that interface.\n. Should have been resolved in #3978\n. Please read the contribution guidelines thoroughly before creating a pull request.\n. Closed due to code style not conforming the principles specified in contributing guidelines.\n. :-1:\n$item is the item used to break the block. It is there for subclasses to use, such as for stone blocks to check if they are broken by pickaxes.\nIf this PR is merged, you will get a new pickaxe every time you break a block.\nPlease test your code before sending a pull request, unless you are very sure.\n. I have the same question, but since this is already implemented, in order to maintain backwards compatibility, this should be kept the same.\nBut whatever, the change in your pull request only adds bugs and doesn't fix any.\nCould you show an example (critical message) of the bug you are trying to fix?\n. Yes. For the while, this should be closed as it is outdated. You may create another pull request or request this one to be reopened when this is ready.\n. Does this fix the issue of returning string? (And are you sure that it really does?) According to php.net, if strict typing is enabled, a TypeError would be thrown if the return value is not an int.\n. @robske110 as long as it is fixable, it is not a client-side issue. It is PocketMine's responsibility to follow client changes, not the client's.\n. @CreeperLewisCF please do not comment unless what you say helps solving the issue. If you cannot point out the exact difference between PocketMine and genisys that brought the fix, it is meaningless to mention about it. Please comment with the exact commit that fixed it.\n. What performance problems does this cause?\n. @onebone I was referring to @64FF00's comment\n\nthis workaround makes it slower to send chunks to players\n. Merged to master.\n. @64FF00 have you tried a var_dump on it to confirm that the tag is indeed returning a string representation of a number?\n. I think this is OK to merge.\n. Please do not open duplicated issues. This is not a chat channel for you to notify other people. This issue is meaningless. If you are trying to get people's attention on it, people who are interested would already have been watching that repository.\n. A proxy system cannot be created from PocketMine itself. It is unreasonable to create a branch or submodule for that in this repository.\n. @Muqsit pull requests will be reviewed when it is the right time. Please do not rush the developers.\n. it appears that this is copied from ClearSky?\nhttps://github.com/ClearSkyTeam/ClearSky/blob/master/src/pocketmine/block/RedstoneBlock.php\n. Your pull request will disallow plugins from cancelling the kick event.\n. @Pub4Game why did you use close() rather than kick()?\n. I'm unable to reproduce the issue you reported.\n\n\n. @Pub4Game fix what? Did you not see my image? This issue cannot be reproduced using the latest master build.\nI have also tested with one player:\n\nThis shows that the server full mechanism is working correctly.\n. @Pub4Game without plugins? And are you using official PocketMine?\nThen how do you explain what I got from the image above?\n. @Pub4Game I am unable to reproduce that issue using the latest development build.\n. Sorry, clicked the wrong button\n. Please follow the contribution guidelines.\n- Do not submit duplicated issues\n- Please submit issues with descriptive titles.\n. Plug PocketMine is not an official app by the @PocketMine Team. Please do not create issues related to PocketMine.\n. This is not a support channel. Please read the contribution guidelines before creating an issue. You can find how to get help there.\nAnd Plug PocketMine (if that is what you mean) is not a software owned by PocketMine officially. Please do not ask us about that.\nAlso, PocketMine has nothing to do with Minecraft PC accounts.\n. @dongjoon-hyun it would be nice if you have added description though.\n. Please follow the contribution guidelines:\n\nNo merge commits are allowed\n. Looks more appropriate to be in pocketmine.yml.\n. We probably need to update .travis.yml before merging this.\n. I guess this is OK.\n. Called by projectile hitting a block.\n. Because the base branch is deleted.\n. Please dump the contents of the string returned.\n. intval or casting to int isn't the correct fix to the issue. It seems that the seed returns a non-numeric value. intval can only convert a numeric string into its parsed literal int. If the string is encoded some other way, like, an empty string, a binary string, etc., intval cannot help. Therefore, we first need to find out what is in the problem string.\n. Use var_dump()?\n. So, we need to find out at which place did it get casted to string. For example, did the ShortTag::getValue() return a string? If it did, we have to find out why from there.\n. What level format are you using?\n. This is not possible. Make sure you are using the latest commit. The return type has already been removed.\n. Yes, we are aware of the issue. To retain the long value in 32-bit PHP, we decided to allow strings to be returned, as that is what PocketMine internally considers as a number too.\n. master branch. It is already updated. Issue settled.\n. Same as #3535: the underlying level provider should have returned an int. If it didn't, it should be fixed at the level provider.\nIt appears that the underlying provider didn't even return a string that is numeric. :-1:\n. It appears you are using the PHP 5 version but running PHP 7.\n. Please read the contribution guidelines before creating an issue; please don't use the issue tracker to ask questions.\nThe PocketMine repo uses submodules for RakLib and SPL. The Download ZIP button only downloads PocketMine core source code without downloading the libraries (the submodules). You have to git clone recursively to do that.\n. Do not use the issue tracker as a support hotline m\n. Please provide full steps to reproduce the issue.\n. Please stop duplicating the same pull request.\n. Please follow the contribution guidelines. Please do not use the issue tracker as a Q&A platform.\n. Oh, I thought this was fixed. :fearful: \n\nDelete the lines directly, rather than commenting them out.\n. @PocketKiller please do it on another branch.\n. I can't seem to reproduce #3537 as of 0.14\n. Please use the latest development build.\n. Player blocking is caused by PocketMine internal exceptions, which may not be related to packets at all. They only mean that a non-plugin error occurred while handling a packet.\nThis issue is too vague, and covers a lot of already-reported and shall-be-reported issues. Please, set debug.level to 2 in pocketmine.yml to see what exceptions these are, and report them accordingly.\n. Why did you chmod the file to 755?\n. Replaced by  ccb60ff\n. Already fixed in eb00dee\n. I have also found out that it doesn't have a problem if I do echo stop | php PocketMine-MP.phar. It stops gracefully without getting stuck.\n. Appears to be an issue with fgets\n. I suspect that when joining the CommandReader thread, it waits for the next fgets() to complete before checking whether the thread should be stopped.\nI was just wondering, why can't you directly kill the thread, terminate it or whatever? The commands entered at server stop won't be executed anyway.\n. Please don't use this as a forum. If you do not have anything that contributes to the issue, please do not post comments like \"Reply soon\", \"Mess\", etc.\n. Please provide steps to reproduce this issue.\n. Was piston really added?\n. If you added the items, shouldn't you add the blocks too?\nAlso, please rebase your commits into one.\n. @deathcraft1 try to use GitHub support next time, rather than asking here.\nhttps://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/subscription\n. This issue is invalid until you add proper elaboration instead of \"this seems quite imporatnt\".\n. Please do not copy code from other modifications of PocketMine, incompletely, and then make them your own pull requests that do not function independently. You will be blocked if you continue to do so.\n. Class pocketmine\\entity\\Boat doesn't even exist. Did you copy code?\n. This is a SimpleAuth issue, not a PocketMine issue.\n. You are using an outdated version with PHP 7.\n. Please read the contribution guidelines before creating an issue. For questions, please visit the IRC channel as stated in the contribution guidelines.\n. You have a corrupted clone.\n. The plugin is threading incorrectly.\nThis is either a plugin issue, or maybe a pthreads issue (unlikely). But I can conclude that this is not caused by PocketMine itself.\n. translate.PocketMine.net?\nIf you want to add a language, discuss it on IRC instead of through pull requests - we need to add them in the website as well.\n. Incorrect installation. Please visit forums or IRC channel for support.\n. You should be casting $randRange to int in all usages. Better do it in assignment. \n. Please show the stack trace.\n. I can't find any backtrace in your issue description. If you can't find one, set debug.level to 2 in pocketmine.yml. \nThis issue will be reopened when you provide a truly reproducible issue report.\nOtherwise, this isn't an issue because you shouldn't be passing floats to the function at all. You should instead point out the backtrace that led to that call.\nUnless you tell me you passed float to blockHash yourself? then your own problem.\n. @Samueljh1 you still fail to provide a full stack trace. From the error message, you apparently did something in the PlayerInteractEvent handler that indirectly led to this error.\nAnd error message \u2260 backtrace \n. Well, there is a purpose. But in that case, I think calling isFood() is better for that purpose.\nIf you really think that a separate class is necessary, you should probably add other functions to it to make it have the purpose of an abstract class.\nThis can be reopened if you push other commits that improve it. But possible duplicate of #3978?\n. Please do not report plugin issues here.\n. Please read the contribution guidelines before creating an issue. Please do not use the issue tracker to request for help. Please only report issues here.\n. This pull request itself alone is not constructive enough.\n. First we have to find out why $pos->x would be a non-integer. The problem should be fixed from the source.\n. @DELOS-phardev plugin developers should not have passed a floating point vector to getBlock() in the first place, right?\n. Now? This is not a real issue, but adds convenience to developers.\n. @robske110 negative numbers have nothing to do with int/float.\n. @robske110 it does. (int) floor(-0.5) results in -1, which is correct.\n. From PHP.net:\n\nReturns the next lowest integer value (as float) by rounding down value if necessary.\n\nWe want to round down -1.5 to -2, not -1. And that's what floor() does.\nshell\n$ php -r 'var_dump(floor(-1.5), (int) floor(-1.5));'\nfloat(-2)\nint(-2)\nand this is the correct behaviour. We want to round down, not to round to the integer closer to 0.\n. This is not a PocketMine issue. This is a ClearSky issue.\n. Duplicates #3978.\n. @jingz2007 we don't need your confirmation that the issue exists. If the issue is not closed, this means it is pending for being reproduced and debugged. Your claim that it is reproduced does not help us debugging it.\n. @fdfdffdf read.\n\n@PEMapModder closed this in dd22e49 3 hours ago\n\nWhich means, the commit dd22e49 has fixed this issue.\n. This issue is caused by invalid installation, where the multibyte extension is missing. This is not an issue related to PocketMine-MP itself, but to users or the installer.\n. There are too many possible causes to this issue, which might even include plugin causes. Closing, since this issue is not a reproducible issue. As for general memory leak, such issue already exists.\n. Wrong installation of server. (Seems like the app has problems installing? Not our fault) The issue tracker is not for support. Please read the contribution guidelines before creating an issue.\n. I think using Item::fromString()->getBlock() is still a better approach, because names like BED should resolve into a bed block rather than null/air. Some items have $this->block set without being a BlockItem.\n. This is not a PocketMine issue. This is related to an installation mistake, which is not an issue. Please refer to the contribution guidelines before creating an issue. You can find ways to get support properly there.\n. It is your own problem installing the server. This is not an issue. Please stop duplicating.\n. @fdfdffdf you can choose to or not to use the issue template. The template is only for reference; if it is not applicable for your issue, you can choose not to use it. Please don't spam comments (three comments in two minutes, and two of them have the same meaning; and you should use the edit button. This is not a forum. Nor a chat platform.\n@djoveryde It seems that you are configuring multicraft wrongly. This is not the place to ask for help. Please refer to the contribution guidelines.\n. Please do not duplicate issues.\n. @djoveryde I did not tell you to redo the issue using a template. It was someone else who is not even a contributor to the PocketMine repo. Please refer to my comment in #4064.\n. @fdfdffdf please stop using the issue tracker as a forum or chatroom, or you may be blocked.\n. Please don't use the issue tracker to ask question. For questions, please visit our IRC channel or use other methods mentioned in the contribution guidelines.\n. Shall be replaced by a better implementation.\n. @thebigsmileXD I don't know who did or what happened, but please, if you want to talk about things that are not related to the issue itself, please use our forums or the IRC channel. The issue tracker is not a forum.\n. Set debug.level to 2 in pocketmine.yml to show more information.\nAlso, it appears that your installation is incomplete (lang files missing).\n. It seems to be an installation problem. Please request support with reference to the contribution guidelines, and don't ask for help here.\n. Incorrect installation of PcoketMine.\nOr is it even PocketMine?\nThis is not a PocketMine issue. What you need is support, not bug fixing. Please read the contribution guidelines for details.\n. Is this duplicate of #4078?\n. Then please edit the title to make #4078 and #4079 be more descriptive so that we can know that they are two issues.\n. Please don't open issues for unimplemented features.\n. Also, PocketMine does not have an AttributeProvider class. And declaring the constant WALKING_AND_SPRINTING wouldn't magically add exhaustion to walking and sprinting. Please, do not open invalid issues, especially when you have copied some code without actually understanding them, and more especially, claiming that the hunger bar will 100% working and more cooler, and even more especially, having wrong grammar: either \"more cool\" or \"cooler\".\n. Which PocketMine-MP build are you using? Are you sure this isn't fixed in the latest build as of 8a0c2b7c4af4f9bbe0aabd18ee82319ce86d0b50?\n. Cannot be reproduced. Most likely you are using a plugin like TapToDo and misconfigured it. If you need help, please use the methods mentioned in the contribution guidelines.\n. Please elaborate the issue. For example, how to reproduce? What's the result?\n. @thedeibo I may have a .php file in the plugins folder, but I don't want PocketMine to attempt to load it as a script plugin.\n. Rebased the commits.\n. There is not a PocketMine version called 1.8\n. Then this is not PocketMine.\nhttps://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/blob/master/src/pocketmine/PocketMine.php#L75\nPocketMine has never had an API version called 1.14.0 either.\n. I cannot reproduce the suggested issue.\n. This is a plugin issue.\n. Are you sure you are using the latest version? What is the version you are using?\n. This is not the latest development version. You can get the build for the latest development build at http://pmt.mcpe.me\n. http://pmt.MCPE.me/pmb/dl/master.phar\nOnly 0.14.0 is supported. And please use PHP 7.\nPlease don't use the issue tracker for asking questions. Read the contribution guidelines.\n. This has been fixed a long time ago.\n. Are you sure you are using the latest development version?\n. Please don't use the issue tracker as a forum. If you need any conversation that are not about a valid issue, please do it somewhere else.\n. Please read the contribution guidelines - DK not add tags to the title; close invalid issues as soon as possible.\n. Allocate more memory to your server. Please, read the error message before creating an issue.\n. Explain the reason behind retaining CURRENT_PROTOCOL. Also, unexpected behaviour if something is not included in ACCEPTED_PROTOCOLS but supported in CURRENT_PROTOCOL. There should be an assertion. And possibly incorrect behaviour when a client joins with an outdated version or too-updated version in the future.\nFurthermore, if there is a protocol version bump, there are usually protocol changes. Make sure you updated them.\nAnd your changes on the MCPE version is invalid.\nIt appears that your changes come from another source without acknowledgement.\n. @robske110 no merge commit is only true when there are no commits on the master branch since the pull request head branch was diverged.\nAnd, there are protocol changes in the new MCPE version. You shouldn't say that you support the new versions without actually supporting the changes.\n. There are other protocol changes apart from the protocol version bump.\n. So your decision is, it segfaults on 64GB RAM or doesn't segfault on 64GB RAM?\n. \"Dedicated machine\" and \"Virtual machine\" do not really have any difference. It seems that it is just a random PHP installation problem rather than a systems-specific issue. Try reinstalling PHP on your virtual machine, using installer scripts provided by PocketMine.\n. Try running the server with gdb bin/php7/bin/php r PocketMine-MP.phar. This will show more details about the segfault.\n. Although apparently hopeless, the Jenkins server is still considered as \"momentarily down\" and \"will be up very soon\", which do not require labelling as down \n. What about the last true parameter? It is not necessary now.\n. But there are only 4 parameters in the new API.\n. Also, $update should be true?\n. Shan't this be \"plugin reason\"?\n. Should I = 0 for damage too?\n. Get the Server object from $player?\n. Suppose you should use [] instead?\n. Ugh I forgot to delete $source->isCancelled()\n. is that another commit?\n. Why Flowers not Flower? This is not a pure enum.\n. Do you see Wool being called as Wools? :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: \n. According to my test, this is faster.\nphp\n$c = $this->callable;\n$c(...$this->args);\nAlso, consider pushing current ticks into the end of the args? Like\nphp\n$c = $this->callable;\n$args = $this->args;\n$args[] = $currentTick;\n$c(...$args);\n. Why no type? And Player[]|null instead?\n. string|null\nRefer to other parts of PocketMine code.\n. Why not simply replace this line into return [[Item::COBBLESTONE, $this->meta, 1]];?\n. @Yosshi999 from what I see in your code implementation, there is no difference.\n. What?\n. Why __?\n. Maybe just private static function forceArray()?\n. This isn't correct anyway. You will convert $this->inventory->getHotbarSlotIndex(0) into a boolean if you do it like this.\n. It was correct.\n$offset is in unit of seconds. $parsed[\"hours\"] is in hours, and here we multiply it by 3600 seconds per hour, making the output $parsed[\"hours\"] * 3600 seconds. If it is / 3600, it becomes $parsed[\"hours\"] / 3600 hours squared per second.\n. :+1:\n.  $sender->sendMessage() instead >.<\n. Unnecessary import. Same namespace.\n. It appears that PocketMine discourages the use of singletons.\n. You should actually put these in their classes, just like how gravity and drag is overridden in those classes.\n. Maybe you should really move command feedback away from the API methods.\n. What if plugins want to add their own mobs?\n. Don't include debug messages in your pull requests.\n. Mind reading the contribution guidelines on PocketMine code style.\n. Are you aware there is a Location class?\n. No, just don't stage things about submodules, OK?\n. For contributing guidelines: read CONTRIBUTING.md in the repo. You also see a link to it when creating a pull request.\n. I'm afraid it's quite hard to revert the submodule changes at this stage (how did you even do it!). Initially, you should clone the repo with the --recursive flag, or execute git submodule update --init --recursive after cloning.\nAt this stage,  https://xkcd.com/1597/ seems to be the easiest method xD\n. Why not simply let users use an array to write down what blocks to not tick?\nyaml\ndisable-block-ticking: [2, 6, 59, 81]\n. You can also do\n``` yaml\ndisable-block-ticking:\ngrass\n\n2\n\nblah\n\n6\n```\n\nNevertheless, users should read documentation if they want.\n. Implementation using clone might work better.\n. PhpStorm auto reformat. Isn't a big issue.\n. The constant Level::REDSTONE_UPDATE_PLACE does not exist.\n. Please follow the PocketMine code style.\n. Yes.\n. Formatting >.<\nBut doesn't matter. I'll fix these when I merge them (if I do).\n. What the...\n. :-1:\n. What's the point of this?\n. Then what's the point of setCount() to its original value? This is as good as doing nothing.\n. https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/blob/master/src/pocketmine/item/Item.php#L1038\nNow, do you think that simply running $this->count = $this->count; has a point at all?\n.

Does that mean server textures are possible as well?\n. @williamtdr lol, You stalking my conversations.\n. @williamtdr because you follow me. ;)\n. Thanks. :)\n. I have the same problem. When I type on a sign, sometimes the text is deleted when I restart server.\n. @sekjun9878 I'd join, but I am still struggling with php.\n. @sekjun9878 I just started Learning php. About a year ago, I was given a hp pavilion dv500 with a burnt out motherboard (later found out that it was bios issues). I took it apart and replaced the motherboard with one I found online for $10. I got tired of windows XP, so I got Ubuntu 12.04. That started my software frenzy. Before that, I just did hardware stuff like replacing processors and upgrading fans. \n. How is the Nametag and creative inventory forced?\n. Isn't nametag client only?\n. I'm not trying to contradict you, I'm just trying to see how everything works. Sorry if I am coming off rude.\n. Then how about the creative inventory enforcement?\n. And Thanks. :D Don't want to overstep my boundaries.\n. There is a mod that allows you to swap out items in the creative inventory. The default version of the mod is replacing ores with iron door, water, lava, and flint and steel. There is a setting on the server.properties file that sends the creative inventory back to the default, even if you have the mod installed.\n. Ahh.\n. How does it delete it, though? That is part of the .so file...\n. Ok. Thanks :)\n. I have another question, but it is kind of off topic. Should I start a new issue, or can I ask here?\n. What controls the positions of doors and trapdoors?\n. Can you edit the metadata in a plug-in?\n. Thanks. :D I am a knowledge-hungry child. \n. I'm trying to make it so that you can emulate redstone. There is a sign next to an iron door, and if you tap on the sign, then the door changes position. also, whats the url?\n. Can you change Nametags by reciving the packet, editing it, then proccessing it? \n. How would you change the metadata?\n. Nevermind. I have it.\n. Will this also work for 0.7.1? It is out now.\n. The fire animation also does not appear when the player catches fire.\n. Nevermind. Didnt see the \"things to do in 1.3.1\" :)\n. By terminal, he means command prompt (if you are windows)\n. https://www.digitalocean.com/ check out this...$5 a month, solid state, 512mb ram, 1000 gb bandwidth, 20 gb storage- Would be excellent for a single instance of pocketmine running :)\n. 600 MHz processor- not good. Also, its a VPS, meaning your ram is not guaranteed. Also, 10gb bandwith- meaning you will be over your limit in about an hour (if your server is very popular). Then, you pay for additional bandwidth- the $5 on is a very good deal, and has good feedback.\n. I would go with ubuntu 12.10 if your feeling risky, but 12.04 for less problems.\n. I have never actually heard of virsoning... Its probably Linux based, but Ubuntu will probably give you what you want, with the easier interface.You may have to rent a domain to do a server... just use a cheap .info site.\n. I would recommend weebly... http://www.weebly.com/ You make the website free, but it has a .weebly.com domain. you can buy your own... The hosting is free, though.\n. Its drag and drop, but you have the option of html as well.\n. To host a server with weebly, nearly impossible. weebly doesn't allow you to runs scripts, and the site is hosted with a minimal spec machine, meaning the processor would not work. I would keep away from the whole vps scene altogether. They are not as reliable, better for file sharing. Even if you did find a good deal on a vps, the other ssd hosting is better.\n. Vps is one very big computer that divides its resources to make many, smaller machines. A ssd server is just a single solid state drive connected to the internet that uses the processors you pay for. \n. Yes, pocketmine can be hosted on an ssd... service??? i have no idea :P\n. 3am here... Good luck!\n. I woudn't recommend it It is much more expensive after one month.\n. I'm not sure if its the same, but on android, you have to delete the world... I have never had to uninstall minecraft (for that reason anyway).\n. Um... you are not allowed to post code on the channel (via +Intyre)\nxD\n. Use the installer provided on the main page- http://www.pocketmine.net/ then upgrade as this says ( if you would like) - https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/wiki/Setting-up-a-Server\n. Either the server is whitelisted, or the server is full... To see if it is full, logout of your account, and log back in. Then join PocketRealms.\n. Can you provide any specifics?\n. What do you mean?\n. They should work together.\n. :DDDDDDD\n. Um @shoghicp im sill having this problem... will it be fixed in the next update?\n. Please explain further.\n. This is a client issue, I believe. I have never had this problem.\n. This is completely compatible with 0.7.6. What is the problem you are having? Will it not see the server on local wifi? does it say \"outdated server\"? Any info would help.\n. ",

I got the same error in windows 7 on a pentium 3 (it sounded like a good idea).... But I think the issue might be either your processor doesn't support a certain multitasking function or your RAM is insufficient. Both were true on mine. It could be the wrong architecture, check the PHP build for what architecture it was built for.\n. How would the portal using the nether reactor work? Would that be a feature in the server? Or am I missing something in the pocket edition?\n. It seems to do this with torches sometimes\n. When I enabled it, all the clients froze throughout the session and eventually all the clients crashed and the terminal windows wouldn't let me type in anything.\n. This could be related to my issue #387\n. Are you sure you aren't in the protected spawn zone? It happened to me. The default is a 16 block radius. You can change this by editing server.properties and restarting the server.\n. ?\n. Are you saying that there is some kind of inventory cleaner that \"dumps\" the active inventory every ~15 minutes?\n. It seems like there is a mismatch between the DOS header and the actual file system. So like shophicp said, it's corrupted. Not sure if you can delete it because that might cause further damage\n. Size, not system. Sorry about that.\n. This never happens to me (I'm always the first to join), but it happens to every subsequent player to join after me.\n. You can back it up before you reinstall using iexplorer\n. Could you please post your log file contents?\n. This happened to me in the previous release too.\n. You would have to port over PHP first\n. \n",

Some common reasons are:\n- Your username is longer than 16 characters or contains characters other than underscores (bad username)\n- Your connection to the server is poor (timeout)\n- You are not whitelisted on the server (username not found in whitelist)\n- You are banned from the server (player is banned)\nYou can find these reasons by looking in the messages at the bottom of the server console when your device is attempting to connect.\n. Fixed via object check. Download the latest development build.\n. This can be caused by lag from your device to the server.\n. I am assuming that the problem is resolved, as the OP has not responded.\n. This happens when the client's connection to the server is poor.\n. The map is corrupted, or the player's connection to the server is poor, causing the chunks not to load.\n. The readme is valid, make a seperate pull request for it. The gamemode change is not valid, players don't necessarily want to know when other player's gamemodes are changed. In Minecraft PC, these changes are not announced.\n. Yes, it's a mojang rendering issue. Happens sometimes on desktop edition too. As for he ghost signs, that was fixed many versions ago. Please update your PocketMine version.\n. Your connection to the server is poor.\n. I fixed this in the latest development build. I'm still not sure what's causing it, but I added an object check so the server won't crash.\n. I recommend Linode as hosting, I use them for all LifeBoat servers, and they are great.\nTheGamerzParadize notifications@github.com wrote:\nI am trying to create a 24/7 server.

Yes, the 'Resource temporarily unavailable' is a definite bug, I've seen it happen on my own servers as well.\n. Running PocketMine on a web hosting will likely violate thier terms of service. Use a VPS hosting company, such as Linode (www.linode.com) to host a PocketMine server.\n. Also, you can use the --disable-pdo options in /src/build/compile.sh to get it to compile on a VPS.\n. Set your IP to your external IP, then join your server through PocketMine Realms.\n. Also try obtaining the latest version of the plugins you are using and confirm they are using the latest PocketMine API version (9 at the time of this comment).\n. It is difficult to determine what's being asked here. This is not an issue with PocketMine, and decisions like this should be made by communicating directly with the developer in question.\n. Network security issue, outside the scope of this issue forum. Please use Google or ask on a security forum (e.g. security.stackexchange.com).\n. This is an issue related to your patching of PocketMine Realms, specific to your installation. Please make sure you follow the instructions at realms.pocketmine.net precisely, and that you have an active internet connection.\n. The best way to get your server added is by asking in the #mcpedevs chat room on freenode.\n. Mob AI hasn't been implemented yet, which is why they aren't there.\n. 1.

Your friends need to connect using PocketMine Realms (realms.pocketmine.net), and you need to configure your server for PocketMine Realms. see the information on that page.\n. Example value?\n. It's over 9000!\n. There is multi-language support for PocketMine Realms, but not for PocketMine itself.\n. Looks like you've resolved the problem.\n. Look in the console for your server, it will tell you why you can't connect.

You should check your device's connection to the computer the server is running on. Make sure your network connection is adequate for gameplay (don't try to play over a 2G connection or a with a poor WiFi signal).\n. Fixed in latest development build.\n. Your entities.dat file is corrupted, PocketMine cannot read the health data for the entities in the world. Obtain the world again, or delete the entities.dat and import the world. You will, however, lose all signs and chests as a result. So, the bes thing to do would be to confirm the world works in MCPE, than transfer it (without compressing it as an intermediary step), directly into the worlds folder.\n. If it's in creative, simply delete the entities.dat. Because mobs don't spawn in creative, unless the signs and chests are critical, you can safely delete the file.\n. Clarifying: You start the server  and it works fine (for what length of time?), and then the console stops responding to input. What platform are you using?\n. Does the number of TPS decrease or get below 20 consistently during the time the server is up? What about the RAM usage?\n. I'll add a pull request for it, just one moment.\n. Fixed in the latest PocketMine Development Build.\n. To run a command, open the in-game chat by using the button in the upper right-hand corner of the screen, then open the keyboard by tapping the picture of the keyboard. Type \"/\", followed by the command you want to run, or type \"/help\" for a list of commands. You have permission to run the command you want to run. To gain all permissions, run \"op playername\" in the console.\n. /tp Mastermatthew001 w:wild (you need the w: prefix when referring to worlds).\n. Not related to PocketMine. Talk to RobertClarke.\n. Duplicate.\n. Your computer is locking up because it can't handle running the server. Close other applications or get access to a faster computer if possible. If you can't, disable most plugins.\n. This happens when the world is corrupted. I'm sorry, hopefully you have a backup somewhere. The pocketmine format has the tendency to corrupt a world if the server is not shut down properly.\n. There are multiple ways to fix this, but I would suggest changing gamemode=1 in the server's properties file, and then deleting the player in question's YML configuration file.\n. Yes, this happens in some environments. Please download my compiled PHP here: http://www.cboos.com/php\n. You have a plugin making an incompatible call to the TimeAPI, please contact the plugin developer and ask for an update.\n. Woo, Linode! You need a compiled version of PHP, you can download mine here: http://www.cboos.com/php.\n. Also can be used with /tell.\n. You can change your timezone in your php.ini configuration file, or using the setTime function: http://php.net/manual/en/datetime.settime.php\n. You have an impropely installed, configured, or corrupted version of Pocketmine. Please reinstall from the repository.\n. Yes, put this in the 'plugin request' section of the Pocketmine Forums.\n. Exactly, I'd also like the MySQL in the repository, but we can't include anything. You can compile your own version of PHP with the extention installed.\n. You have an invalid version of  PHP installed or compiled. Please run the installer again, or download my compiled version of PHP at www.cboos.com/php.\n. This is not a discussion forum, this is a place where the Pocketmine Team can track down bugs. Please use another method of communication, such as the Pocketmine Forum, for discussions.\n. Please read the guidelines for contributing to this repository before creating an issue.\n. You have an invalid plugin in your plugins directory, or a file ending in .php or .pmf that is not a plugin. \n. That is not that much bandwidth in the scheme of things, when the uncompressed map downloads were still in place, PM was using twice that. Any bandwidth issues are because of MCPE protocol, and not PocketMine's fault.\n. In my humble opinion, we should remove all of the strategic comments from the PM source. They clutter things up, and standard text editors like Notepad++ with a solution explorer work fine. Hey, I do a fair amount of my development in Vi. I think we should remove any comments like that so others don't have to trip over it. Or perhaps put it on a separate branch.\n. Clarification plox.\n. Not necessarily. It sometimes works properly, but if you hit too close to the edge it seems not to work.\n. Configuration-specific issue on the user's end.\n. Not really a bug. The server doesn't drop the item at the player's feet because Pocketmine isn't very good at entity phsyics yet, and would make it so the player wouldn't get the item some of the time, and it would be stuck on the ground (at least that's my understanding). You're welcome to make a plugin to do this (/giveasitem perhaps), and this may be changed in Alpha 1.4 when the entity physics are better. But in the meantime, it makes sense to leave it as it is.\n. One of the plugins you are using has a memory leak, probably somewhere in the YAML reading portion of it. Talk to the plugin developer. Your server is crashing because it's running out of memory.\n. @shoghicp Check your objects! ;)\n. Best I can think of is your PocketMine install might be corrupted. Have you tried re-downloading it?\n. @shoghicp Then do you have any proposed solution to fix it?\n. Then a workaround is still needed on the server side or people will complain.\n. @shoghicp Can invisible bedrock still be used?\n. @shoghicp Alright. So in the meantime, all my worlds won't be infinite, so I'll have to tell my plugin to teleport them back from the edge if they get too close?\n. @shoghicp Great, thanks.\n. @shoghicp Issue not resolved, still happening on latest pocketmine version, switched to creative before reconnecting.\n. No, not started via plugin. And I gave it at least a minute.\n. @shoghicp I'll check next time it locks up.\n. @shoghicp 0.7%.\n. The player also glitches into the void after walking around in a world like this.\n. @shoghicp Apologies, since the old one was solved via a commit and closed, I assumed that the issue was taken to have been resolved and this was at a different line.\n. Still happening, as per #1743. Although it is a client issue, keeping the issue open prevents duplicates from being created, especially when the issue has not been resolved.\n. Actually, both of you are wrong. It should be \"Ouch. That looks like it hurt.\" for proper english.\n. Incorrect. I'm using a port forwarded vanilla server and don't have any of these problems.\n. I did save-all then stopped, after the signs had been placed for a while. Seemed to stay fine.\n. Duplicate of #1722.\n. This is a user configuration issue, not a bug or problem with Pocketmine itself. For support in the future, please use search engines or ask our IRC channel: #pocketmine on irc.freenode.net. This issues forum is for bugs with Pocketmine, not to troubleshoot user problems. Thanks!\n. That is lag, when the server dropped the item it found your client already there, so it added it to your inventory because you were within range of the item.\n. There are many memory leaks in Pocketmine at the moment, meaning the memory usage of the server will slowly increase over time if certain conditions are met. Until these issues are fixed, the only solution is to edit the allocated memory in the server.properties configuration file to a higher value.\n. Please do not duplicate existing open issues.\n. The developer of this app MrARM, has not yet released a fully compatible version of PHP compatible with Pocketmine for Android devices. Please ask for status updates and information from him, and not the Pocketmine team. Thanks!\n. Pocketmine does not support leveldb (0.9.0) format yet, this is on the to-do list and will probably one of the next features implemented. You were right to go about the process as you did, and will be ready as soon as Pocketmine supports importing these worlds.\n. Client issue, probably not Pocketmine related. If it is, the user has not provided sufficent information to resolve the problem. Issue closed.\n. Cannot reproduce, seems to be a user configuration error.\n.

This commit doesn't actually do anything - this would make the server throw an error if implemented when the event is fired. It needs more than just that to be properly cancellable, and as the code provided does not work, I'm closing the pull request. Please see other Pocketmine source code files for examples on how to implement this functionality properly.\n. @PEMapModder Not so sure, if it's an instance of Cancellable but without the proper methods I can't se that working out well.\n. @phylaxis @Yosshi999 No, that won't help. The latest build was to fix a documentation issue, not gameplay issues. If you had the bug in the last build, it will persist in this one. That said, we need some more information to help you with your problem. What gamemode is your player in? Was the world & files you're using generated using an old Pocketmine build, or imported from PC? What generator are you using, and what special properties have you changed in the server's configuration files? The more test results and information you can provide, the faster we can solve your problem.\n. @phylaxis Alright. Well, the current version of Pocketmine is, unfortunately, only stable on superflat worlds. This can be toggled on by changing 'level-type' to FLAT and re-generating the world. Hopefully the terrain generator will become stable enough in the future to allow for normal worlds to work at a reasonable stability. The reason this is happening is because the server is lagging, as the generator does not work properly. If you try to place/break blocks in a superflat world, it should work. Best regards!\n.

Depending on what platform you're using (Windows, Mac OS X, Android, or Linux) there are various options available for recovering deleted files. Google is your friend, there are many programs that can help you with this.\nIn the future, please do not use our issue system as a way of fixing user-caused problems with server management.

You're welcome, sorry for breaking it :D Trying to fix breaking a block not extinguishing fire.\n. @swagking47 I wish, running out of time! D:\n. @Huntereb Alright. I'll take a look.\n. Alright, please download, install, and try it now! I don't have my IDE with me today, so I can't check what I'm doing. It might take a few tries to get this right, sorry!\n. @Huntereb Derp! Fixed.\n. It probably hasn't built yet, can you try it again?\n. Doh! I'll look again.\n. New commit, try #301 when it's done. Going to sleep, I'll check this again in the morning.\n. @Falkirks I don't think that will work, as I was comparing it to Item::Fire before. I'll get the commit, one second.\n. @Falkirks See: https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/commit/14d86339fc3936d15e3bc501be41d7f763a34fb4\n. @Huntereb Yeah, I told @Falkirks that wouldn't work. Reverting.\n. This is a problem with your client, please see: http://stackoverflow.com/a/11866962/1048586\n. Not valid. When closing the server, the close() function is called, which auto-saves the level if the feature is enabled. https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/blob/master/src/pocketmine/level/Level.php#L254\n. @Tschrock Already tried that, look at the commit logs ;)\n. @onebone Pretty sure last time I tried this it caused the server not to start. I'll pull up the commit logs.\n. @Falkirks You could have just brought that one up before :D\n. Github seems to be having trouble merging this branch, stuck on \"checking it\". Any ideas?\n. \n. @PEMapModder I can't revert the revert. It said it couldn't be merged outright before, I so I reverted the commit, and now it's broken. @Tschrock, I'm going to re-type in your change manually at this point, it's the best I can do. Github's broken somehow, see the above image. Sorry for all the trouble :P\n. Duplicate of #1538.\n. Duplicate with some additional information, should be added as a comment to #1674.\n.

We don't want to update this until 0.9.5 is out on iOS devices. Also, incrementing the protocol version does not fix any inconsistencies that have arrived as a result of the latest version, e.g. the ability to denote to the client that the server is full.\n. Please provide more information about your server environment before making an issue.\n. :+1: \n. Reproduced, definitely an issue. Does not happen on steadfast, so the server's sending invalid information to the client.\n. See the second photo here for the stack trace: https://twitter.com/WilliamTDR/status/516223791907610624/photo/1\n. Still happens on latest beta. Same stack trace.\n. No, the transaction is not being refused. Players are crafting the armor from iron blocks, everything checks out here.\n. @shoghicp Then is there any way to import a world to 1.4? It seems to me that it's not even reading from the disk, trying to generate new terrain each time the server starts even with auto-save on.\n. No. Tabs take up less space than the equivalent amount of spaces as far as code space is concerned. It would make a horrible commit as well, messing up the last commit for every single file. Tabs are nicer to work with, and although you can play with IDE settings and install plugins like hungry backspace until you can emulate how tabs work, why not just use tabs?\n. PMF worlds from old versions of PocketMine aren't supported in this version. If needed, you can use simpleworlds to export the world and mcedit to make it into a readable format for 1.4.\n. PocketMine sucks at stopping and has to be force killed a lot already, if this makes it worse, I'm not in favor.\n. tries to kill init\n. Yes. This is a useful feature, however, I think it should be enabled by default because the people who don't spend the time to go over the configuration files would probably be the same ones not updating still and reporting issues. The update system as it exists is intrusive and isn't really useful. Telling me in the console is the whole \"this computer is broken, please go fix it\" thing. Which doesn't make sense for the user when it's an easy problem for it so solve. Thus, I am in favor of an auto-update system, and enabled by default.\n. ",

My username works on another PocketMine-MP server..... Just not mine.... \n. Actually let me try with my MCPE username all lowercase\n. Thank you fixed :) \n. This is probably most likely because you already have pocketmine mp running in another terminal. Close that terminal and try again. \n. Huh when all terminals were closed.....

The lag is probably your problem, get a better computer ;) Also, you could just disable free crafting and all that cheat stuff all together in the server.properties. Although it will disable crafting. Flying anticheat is already built in. \n. Gary, PocketMine does not work that way. What Mojang does not add (in this case skin support), will not work.

Haven't really tried resetting the entire server though? I'll try it out later and let you know if it fixes it.\n. Whatever that means... I just hope to have it fixed soon.\n. Sounds like you two are good friends... Haha I wish the best of luck in finding a fix!\n. Any progress? My server is almost always outside of my network, and it's nearly impossible to play with it not loading chunks like this. I even upgraded servers, and added more RAM to try and fix this problem, still no luck. Could it be cause I'm limited to 500MB Upload? The normal MC Server I'm running doesn't seem to have a problem with it though?\n. Awesome. Just glad to know it's being worked on!\n. What you get for buying Android. Is there an update out? I wouldn't know where to look, sorry!\n. Updated to the latest dev build. After waiting about 5 minutes to actually join the game, I did with big corruption outside of the network, still.\n. Works great over WiFI inside of the network however. Does it matter what speed of internet I have when outside? I was using an AT&T 3G Stick to test, and AT&T 3G here isn't that amazing. \n. I hope so, I only have 500k upload (all that DSL allows) but the normal MC Server works fine. Best of luck finding a fix!\n. Hooray! Is there a new update?\n. Will do. Again, thank you!\n. I see, I'll try that. Thank you!\n. Nope. It was already set to 1, so I tried setting it to 0 and back and it's still doing it.\n. Linux Server, version 12.\n. Nope, that doesn't work. It's still doing it. \n. I ended up having to go into the config files and disabling it manually. So essentially it's fixed, it just took a lot longer\n. I believe it was under src/config.php and dependencies.php that I was able to disable it. That command @shoghicp gave me didn't work, and didn't seem to exist. \n. After updating to 1.3, it's back. I somehow got rid of it with 1.2, but not able to do it with this one...\n. \n. How do you tell?\nAustin, From my iPod Touch 5th Generation 64GB Yellow\n. I updated to the latest dev build, and now I can't see the server from my iPad?\n. I've been wanting new worlds for my server as well. Is there any sort of MultiVerse for PE yet?\n. Didn't see it... Thanks\n. Torches used to to the same thing. I actually preferred it, as I could then place it on top of Fences, but now I can't...\n. @shoghicp Creative. @williamtdr I don't think so, cause when I play offline it doesn't do it. I noticed it only crashes when I type the instant I place the sing down, if I wait a few seconds it works fine. \n. iPad 3 32GB Verizon LTE. That's the model name. \n. Stable 1.3.2 is out, still a temporal respiratory?\n. So, when do they expect to fix it?\n. You also can't place torches on Fence Posts. Both I find to be very annoying... -.-\n. No more flat grass? Or change the name?\n. I wish... The time on my server is correct, I checked. (It's a rack server running Linux by the way. I'm offended you think I'm just using a laptop. ;))\n. On Linux, it's a little easier with Screen over SSH, but it would be nice to just say /laston (Or something) then the name and have it give you the last time and IP it was on.\n. Everything works, until I import a world. Doing /lag gave me these results: \"ping 0ms, packet loss 0%, 0KB/s.\" But, if I type anything into the clients keyboard, the server doesn't respond. Even chat doesn't go through. \n. Could all this be caused by importing a world from my iPad? Everything always works fine till I do that...\n. ",

If anyone can provide me RDP access to a machine where it occurs for half a day I can almost certainly fix it. I have tried virtual machines, and a crappy laptop.

First you can try setting allow-flight to on in server.properties if that doesnt work you might just have a slow computer\n. Wow that's pretty close!\n. It's a development server it is setup a little bit different and is unstable @lukanibal\n. Yah lol that's what I did. Try installing the stable version and running it then copy over the files of the dev version. Overwriting all files\n. No problem\n. Please use a translator\n. Yea that's a bug people sometimes are invincible and sometimes their even invisible\n. No it's a bug only @shoghicp can fix it exept if someone sends a pull request but not many people are that smart to know how to fix it\n. Yes I will send him a link to this\n. Actually he's probably getting emails right now of this conversation so he'll respond when he can probably we don't even need to send anything\n. what do you mean by \"uncrafting\"?\n. I think someone just sent a pull request a little while ago for build 8 it's probably not in the latest version yet\n. It's probably the factions plugin\n. No you need to be a better plugin dev than me to fix it\n. Your not supposed to use symbolic links. Pocketmine needs the raw code straight from the source\n. It seems like droid pocketmine doesn't support the version of pocketmine you have\n. Kinda I ment that droid pocketmine might not support the version of pocketmine you have on it. It's the safest to use your computer for your server and a lot faster\n. Maybye a plugin is changing it? Or can your server only be able to hold 20 players\n. are you saving it? what PocketMine MP are you using?\n. It's a problem with the economy's plugin. Please contact the owner and give him this error code\n. The owner said to remove EconomyShopPlus until he fixes that bug\n. The latest stable version of PocketMine is made for 7.6 but you can use the Development version which is made for mcpe 0.8.0\n. @brotherphil did you install it correctly?\n. Do you have android? I heard there was a bug in MCPE multiplayer in android\n. I would suggest finding someone who has MCPE on IOS and have them test your server to make sure it works\n. The adding new servers and in game chat?\n. No problem and that guess would be correct\n. @brotherphil unzip 1.3.11 somewhere else and delete the src folder in 1.3.10 then copy/paste all files from the 1.3.11 to the 1.3.10, overwriting all files. Then run it and confirm it says PocketMine Alpha 1.3.11dev.\n. Can you copy/paste the error here? It's probably a plugin\n. Do you have a custom map?\n. Do you have a custom map?\n.

Okay, this issue has been fixed with commit 0dfaa19 (build 624).\n. This doesn't change anything to PocketMine basically, it just removes the possibility of PocketMine killing any process on my system.\n. @shoghicp Ah, okay. \n. @shoghicp Yes, but that would include changing the /src/pocketmine/PocketMine.php file if my PR gets merged. Right now, PM can kill any PID (process), by just calling the function with any PID as argument. I'd call that some kind of security flaw to be honest :/\n. @shoghicp I'm not talking about plugins. I'm talking about PM theoretically being able to kill (-9! Not just sigterm or hup) any process on a system. \n. @shoghicp I disagree, a potential security hole shouldn't be ignored just because you could also execute something else. \n. Well I guess someone's OCD striked.. :laughing: \n. Yes, however, in a way that the server won't download and install the newer version right away, but instead prompt the user that 'a newer version of PM has been found, would you like to update? [Y/n]' (or something like that). If that'd be implemented, there should be a setting to disable automatic update checks, because there're always gonna be users that don't want automatic things. :) \n. ",

assigned to your server by your router.\nyou need the ip assigned to your router by your isp.\nif you simply google ip address it will show you your external ip... and that's the one you'll give out to players.\ncheck portforward.com for info regarding exposing your server to the internet... every router is different, but you basically want to forward the port that your server is running on via your routers configuration dialogue.\nserver port is in server.properties\nrouter configuration is usually accessed by using a web browser and accessing 192.168.0.1 from a computer on that local network.\ndetails will be available at portforward.com however.\n. world edit can remove JUST the water if you'd like as well.\nbut you have to run the //replace command several times over the area:\neach time using a different META value on ID 8 (and 9 i think)\nbasically i start with //replace 8 0 (replace water with air)\nthen: //replace 8:1 0 (again water with air)\nthen: //replace 8:2 0\nthen: //replace 8:3 0\nand so on up to i think 9:9\neach meta value on ID 8 represents a different stage of flowing water.\nread more about  this here: http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1521248-what-is-the-difference-between-water-block-8-and-9-solved/\nthis can help you save a build that has been water griefed from a straight up //cut.\n. i know this isn't an optimal solution, but when you need to clear your inventory and delete it completely - place a chest, fill it up, stand back and break it, the burn the items with flint/steel.\ndone.\nnot ideal, but it is a reasonable workaround.\n. ...not cool.\nyou have no right to \"get piss\"\nthis program is free. the people who work on it don't get paid to work on it.\njust accept the limitations of it, and know that this feature will be added eventually.\n. https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/issues/1001\n. this issue has been reported already - please try to look around before submitting so you don't end up duplicating issues.\nhttps://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/issues/804\n. that's a plugin issue.\ni get them frequently on older more developed worlds.\nthe only workaround i've found is to disable some plugins (take them out of the folder) - one by one, and try to boot up after each.\notherwise, starting a fresh world will fix it 100% - just be sure to clear out plugin data that is map specific.\n. not a bug.... hasn't been implemented yet.\n. it's a plugin issue (obviously)\nthe unfortunate reality is that you'll probably have to either completely reset the saved data for a plugin, or remove it.\nhere is one method you can use to help you figure out which plugin is causing the issue...\nin server.properties add a line: debug=3\nnow when you start your server, the console will list handlers from each plugin as they load.\nwhichever plugin was loaded immediately prior to that error message will need to either have it's save data cleared, or removed completely.\n...try that anyway - but backup the save data.\n. in server.properties - add this on a new line:\ndebug=3\nyou'll notice in that the console is now outputting more information about plugin handler assignments.\nwhichever plugin handler is the last to load before the  crash - remove it and try again.\nrepeat this process until it runs.\n. what message does the console return?\n kicked: No Reason..?\nif they're banned, the console would return the message: username logged out: Banned.\n. ah yeah, i get those on player timeouts.\nplayer will be logged in.\nthen they will appear to login again.\nthen it'll say \"player kicked - already logged in\"\nthen it'll say \"player logged out due to timeout\"\nbut ultimately they'll still be logged in.\n. this is not a bug - rails haven't been implemented yet.\n. jrcon on droid.\nMinecraft RCON Tool by R3B0RN on windows.\nboth work.\nalso, rather than just saying \"I've tried different programs\" tell us which ones, so we would know right off the bat if it's a configuration issue.\nalso, this strikes me as more appropriate question for the forums (http://http://forums.pocketmine.net/) - not so much a github type issue\n. uhh... in server.properties, does this line exist?\nenable-rcon=true\n. did you forward your port with TCP protocol?\n. maybe try changing the port and again ensure that it's properly forwarded\n. k well, i'd suggest posting on the forum.\n. excellent. that'll work perfectly well, without any extra configurations required.\n. @LilCrispy2o9 ...he's making the report so that the developers have a reference for it.\nthat's the point of having this on github.\n. @tnpxxsheepdog - yeah dude should save the lynch mob for the next guy who shows up asking for minecarts, ffs.\n. players on my server have reported this as well...\n. looks like it adds some physics for projectiles (item drops, in particular?) not sure of the whole scope of it.\n. confirmed.\ndev956\n. there is another issue i think is linked to this one, apologies in advance for this hopefully not too lengthy elaboration:\ni had a stone pickaxe that was glitching as described here.\ni made a crafting table, but could not place it... it would just reappear in my inventory.\ni just gave up on it for a while, and went on using my pick, it would break and come back...\ni then tried to dump these items into a chest, and they would revert to my inv repeatedly... after multiple attempts they both remained in the chest - i crafted a new table and i was then able to place it.\nseems like there is some kind of inventory corruption when crafting items...\nalso, i recall when crafting the glitched tables, that the quantity of planks in my inv didn't seem to change (may be mistaken on that, as i wasn't paying really close attention) so maybe there are issues with updating inventories - items lost and items gained sort of thing....?\nhope that helps.\n. i've seen some builds on my server doing this.  overwrites stone blocks on users' builds.\n. my server.log is also not populating - there is a workaround:\n./start.sh 2>&1 | tee -a server.log\n. also possibly worth noting, this doesn't seem to effect players in creative mode, so it may be related to the -no flight- check - \nit seems as though jumping up stairs and such really helps to minimize the effect which would otherwise just rubberband until you get off the half block.\n. this issue is 10x worse now on build 965.\ncan't even get on a slab.\n. yes, on top - they just disappear...\ni'll keep polling my peeps for bugs - more to come ;)\nwe all really appreciate it shoghi!  drop by any time\n. i'm not sure if this is related, but we've had quite a lot of chunk errors where an entire chunk, and exactly a chunk will reset to default terrain overwriting player builds completely.\nhere is one pretty clear example.\nhttp://redd.it/2wj1na\nthey seemed to have started around the time this error message first popped up - shortly after anyway... \n. encountered this several times as well.\n. confirmed this one - it happens when using /tp and /spawn...\nat first, it seemed to relate to slow chunk loading,  but there are instances where you spawn into an unloaded chunk, and still stay at the proper y dimension until the chunk fully loads.\n. i mean, that when players spawn into an unloaded chunk, they sometimes fall a few blocks until the chunk loads, at which point, they're suffocating in blocks.\n.

And this: A separate one: [ERROR] A level 2 error happened: \"Invalid argument supplied for foreach()\" in \"/root/src/Player.php\" at line 223\n. Run the compiler with \"-d\" on the tail \n. You need to recompile with the \"-d\" after the Linux installer. So run \"PocketMine-MP_Installer_Alpha_1.3.11.sh -d\"\n. Run the exe... Come on it's not that hard just think. Same as the stable version pretty much. Install it. \n. This happens as well. A new time zone integration was added. They are most likely working on it. It is dev after all. \n. REFRENCE THIS THREAD: http://forums.pocketmine.net/threads/when-my-server-restarts-it-deletes-signs.2019/#post-22679 \nIt explains some plugin issues that may be worth looking into to see why PM is not wanting to work with them. \n. I don't know why you are being a bit hostile. I love the dev team and believe it or not, these posts help them keep track and know what is happening. I didn't come in here and say \"FIX THIS NOW PLEASEEE\" did I? I don't understand your post to be honest. \n. @unerds Thank you! People are being a bunch of sallies, but oh well you can't feed the trolls.\n. @LilCrispy2o9 I have think skin, no worries.\n. @shoghicp That is how I always do it. It happens only on a few stops so not a big deal. \n. name = world and then the x y z are the cords?\n. I need to set the spawn for al players, the default spawn.\n@pemapmodder The change was reverted. No idea why...\n. It is not a windows only error. You people really need to learn how to search before posting errors. Put a \"-d\" after the installer.sh line\n. Yes you are and because of your rudeness, find help elsewhere. \n. Here are my plugins: http://puu.sh/6J5mI.png\n. you need to compile PHP\n. Download the linux installer on the home page and run it with \"-d\" at the end of it. So ./PMINSTALLER.SH -D is what you need. \n. What the...\n. Could you paste this on hastebin.com please\nYes hastebin not pastebin\n. I don't like to download logs. Paste it to hastebin.com please \n. Remove the server IP address from server.properties. Does the server crash often with this?\n. How many people are on the server when you get that message?\n. Yes you for sure need to run this as admin... \n. Without providing plugins and specs on the system, how are we supposed to help you?\n. UPDATE: Restoring the old src did not work, got the same error. Re compiling the entire thing, then going to restore only players and plugins folder.\n. @iksaku It happens every second and spams the console with EVERY player online.\n. @iksaku No it is not that. That was my first thought though!\n. @Rexo52 This really shouldn't have anything to do with plugins. \n. @Rexo52 I think updating to the latest DEV would help. I wanted to report this error because it seems to be lingering even though it has been reported before. It may be fixed, who knows. Thanks for the suggestions... \n. So crashes will be automatically sent to the developers using an API? Has this been implemented as of now or will this be beta 2?\n. @sekjun9878 Thanks bud!\n. Shoghicp confirmed that this was an issue with Mojang and not PocketMine\n. I have left a few instances running for a few hours and have not had any crashes. I will leave them on longer this time and see what happens. Very curious to see this.\n. @sekjun9878 To the best of my memory it involved kicking a player and it would say (player) logged out due to banned even though it was a kick. Then why you tried to log back on as that player, it would crash the server. It may have already been fixed somewhere along the way. \n. Was not able to re-create the bug. For now I think it is gone. \n. Yes the freezing has already been reported. Remember we are in early stages here. Baby steps!\n. They aren't on here but I can confirm that Shoghi knows about these because I told him myself and am sure a few more people have. \n. Has @shoghicp commented on this as a PM bug or Mojang bug? Haven't seen any word on it yet. \n. Oh those are always bad news :(\n. Yeah there is a ton of weird death stuff going on when players leave the server. Hopefully the second beta can fix this!\n. Here is this, just happened to me with an anvil world\nFatal error: Call to a member function setSection() on a non-object in phar:///bcpre/beta/PocketMine-MP.phar/src/pocketmine/level/format/anvil/Anvil.php on line 202\n. Thanks for working on this so fast!!! The IP and port are the exact same, we are trying our hardest so we can get the server up and running asap.\n. Are you using texture packs or mods? Or just plain vanilla? \n. Can you please explain a bit more? IOS? Android? \n. Is it ONLY stone? I didn't test it with anything.\n. Ok. I will have to test this out more but at least we can confirm that it is not just me. \n. So is that Mojang side or PM side?\n. Yeah the relog isn't going to solve anything. It needs to be fixed by the developers for it to work\n. @shoghicp It is still happening with 0.9.1 and the latest PHAR (a few hours ago).\n. Is this a feature that was meant to be?\n. This is happening a lot and including me. You're simply just going to have to wait\n. Yeah not to worry. Devs are working round the clock. Keep reporting MAJOR bugs (not minor ones).\n. Anymore explanation on what timings is? Sorry, noob question! \n. Yes those sound a lot like Mojang bugs but could also require some tweaks from the PocketMine team \n. Water has not been fully implemented at this time. Physics are still being worked on for many items. \n. Your TPS is at 0 so you are most likely running out of memory. For now run vanilla and no plugins. How can this be reproduced? \n. I am on 0.9.1  Mojang completely rushed the bug fix update. They needed to wait at least a few days to collect all the bugs before submitting 0.9.1   Are they going to do a 0.9.2? The developers haven't acknowledged any bugs. Somewhat dormant. We are getting there though :/\nThe random TP bug is major and has seized to be fixed. \n. @iksaku Not necessarily. A fresh world could still have the same problem. Anyway the issue is fixed with the latest build.\n. Make sure you are the super user and PM has access to the php directory. \nAlso there are still some bugs with the world generation. Beta 2 of PM will be out soon, give it some time.\n. I have been running PM as root since December 2013 and no issues. Then again I have a very strong firewall, fail2ban and other security implements. \n. I can see that.\n. This was the case for me. @shoghicp I believe said something about texture or a chunk loading issue but I have already shown him this. \nWas the world modified with MCedit?\nWhat build are you using? \n. Ok yeah Anvil worlds are having some trouble as far as I am concerned. Gonna have to wait for a fix. As far as I am aware, if you don't try to walk to the edge the server will not crash. I think the reason there is an error is the fact that it's trying to generate chunks. \n. Use the latest builds.\n. This isn't an issue or a bug. At this time the console doesn't have the ability to /kill and there is no word if it will be back in the future or not. \n. Let's calm down here... It's called a bug. The team is working on squashing the bugs and this is a known issue. \n. AlwaysSpawn\nBigBrother\nPacketLogger\nSimpleAuth\n. Could not be replicated. \n. I believe that is what I did before the first /stop but let me test this out.\n. Confirmed: No longer an issue, signs work correctly. \n. Perhaps this is not closed?\n. Will test fix within a few hours. Thanks \n. @shoghicp Signs still disappearing. Placed 15+ signs, no server restart and many of them disappeared. \n. @williamtdr They are disappearing even when the server is online. \n. So you were able to reproduce it?\n. @shoghicp Ok gotcha. I have been doing some tests on when and where the signs disappear. I have every reason to believe it is a chunk-related issues because some chunks can hold signs without disappearing. Mostly it is signs that we replace over and over again that keep disappearing. A fun fact- When on big brother, you can see multiple signs in the same area with o wording on them. Strange. \n. Here is our test. The intial corner is at 0,GROUND,0 And each chunk test is 16 blocks for a total of 2 chunks, give or take 1 or 2 blocks. \nIMAGES:\nhttp://imgur.com/xIrS0Cs\nhttp://imgur.com/FwqF2fa\nhttp://imgur.com/wX2J8OU\nhttp://imgur.com/NzwehQ9\nhttp://imgur.com/bKVp7b0\nhttp://imgur.com/J2QhYfA\nhttp://imgur.com/iV13P2z\nhttp://imgur.com/e1OmmWU\nSave all was performed after creating the platform. Signs and chests were placed and sign were placed on blocks in various ways. Some signs have no text, others have 1 to 5 letters or numbers. \nWe are wathcing the platform in real time. \nExcuse typos and grammar, had to make this on my tablet.\n. This time out game signs stayed in tact, but the shop ones disappeared. Same area, same positions. \nBuild 611\n. @shoghicp I will test now\n. @shoghicp Signs definitely seem more stable now. I havent tested chests yer,t. I ask you give me at least 1 more day before we close this, just in case. Still  doing some testing.\n. @shoghicp Ok so we can assume they are fixed as well. I just laid a fresh batch of signs down on the server, I will report if they disappear within 12-24 hours \n. @shoghicp Hmmmm. It appears that the signs have disappeared again. I thought it was working correctly only to find them invisible this morning. Something definitely made them stay longer this time. \n. @SuperMarcus The issue still persists BUT was improved a bit. The bottom line is the original issue is still happening. \n. Set your allocated memory limit to a higher option in server.properties\n. #1592 has a different file that is causing the error (the NBT php one). In general it is a memory exhaust error for both. \n. Enable status in pocketmine.yml\n.  #Enables /status\n commands: false\nSet this to\n#Enables /status\n commands: true\n. Yeah I was curious as well. But at least it can be enabled in the settings. \n. U-TURN!!!\n. Because this is not a default MC command, it will not be enabled by default. \n. No I was too slow...\n. Would love this\n. Do they bump to slot 1 if they are placed in say slot 2 or 3 on the hotbar?\n. This could be a possible Mojang issue? I am running creative servers right now because survival is a bit more buggy. I am thinking Mojang but I know sometimes even creative blocks go blank. \n. Biomes are not implemented yet. Read this Beta release note: https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/releases/Alpha_1.4dev-277\n. Did you enable spawn protection? Also due to the low TPS, a known issue with linux, block place events may not be received by the server. \n. Mojang or PM bug?\n*Just curious\n. Looks like a PM bug since it has been put into the Beta 3 milestone. \n. Is this related to the light bug where you need to break a torch or piece of glowstone upon joining a server? \n. @shoghicp Trying to tell new players that they need to break a block to fix it temporarily is hard when they don't listen lol. \n. Please review these guidelines before opening an issue here: https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/blob/f2d5daffc02ed4ef9a7ddc03ce6fbc465e7c418b/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. Set your allocated memory in server.properties to a higher value. \n. @iksaku The error is that the set memory size is out, and the server crashes. Unless this can be set in php.ini, that seems to be the solution. \n. Are you on Linux?\n. Yes I can confirm that 0.9.2 is buggier when it comes to multiplayer...\n. They are going to have to fix multiplayer. 0.9.4 is already being worked on. \n. I can CONFIRM that the TPS drops to 1-6 TPS after about 8 players join. Console actions don't seem to be too laggy and when I go in game, it seems to be at 15+ TPS when on console it is showing a very low number.\n. @shoghicp Thank you! \n@Huntereb Client crashing has been up from what I can tell but nothing too out of control. \n. @shoghicp Sorry for the late reply, the TPS still seems to be low in console. \nHere is an example: Console TPS will say 2.8  The actual TPS in game would probably be around 14.5  There is some lag but definitely not to where it is at 2.8 TPS\nI have notcied the lag has become a tad bit worse before the beta5. Now that B5 is here, give me some time to test\n. @shoghicp The TPS drop was increasing right up to Beta5. So far Beta5 has made the TPS rise a bit more, still need some time to test. Chunk ticking is even enabled on my servers, so far so good, no noticeable lag!!! Yes, I read the release notes, I stalk them :)\n. Please look at issues before opening more, this issue has been reported many times. \n. @Andy15 Update to the latest MCPE edition \n. @Andy15 You aren't understanding what updating this means. Learn and observe before posting\n. Does the server unload correctly during the crash or does it freeze up to where you have to restart? \n. This is not the correct place for help with plugins. That either needs to go on the simpleauth repo OR the forums.\n. Yeah that cam be the only explainable reason is internet. \n. Use a flat world until this can be fixed. This is a known issue.\n.

This is not the android repo for PocketMine, please do not post android related problems here. \n. What build are you on?\n. Revert to Beta 3 or test out the LATEST builds. Build 413 was buggy for me as far as player profiles. \n. @shoghicp I am using build 422 \n. @shoghicp So this will eventually be fixed? I can lower entities in Pocketmine.yml I think. I will check it out, thanks \n. Do a /timings on   and show us those results. \n. It is a known issue and marked to be addressed by the dev team in beta 5, There is no need to keep assuring us it is there. \n. Use the latest dev build, also you may have other programs running in the background. If you are serious about running servers, linux + a VPS is your best option in most cases. \n.

Thanks!\n. @shoghicp From what I can tell, it is fixed. I had a few of my staff and even I walked in survival and could not re-produce it. However one staff member did say they died on a ladder from \"fell to death\" \n. This error is presented in the middle of the server kicking everyone but keeping them logged in [ERROR] An E_WARNING error happened: \"Illegal offset type in isset or empty\" in \"/src/pocketmine/scheduler/ServerScheduler\" at line 122\n. @shoghicp I will test this as soon as I can. Thanks for pushing a possible fix! \n. Update, as of now this SEEMS to be fixed but I have not had enough time to test. I am still monitoring for this. \n. I saw the issue again today when viewing console. I had the ASR plugin from @ijoshuahd and I took that out so we will see if that fixes anything. Thanks\n. Ok so at least we have confirmed that \n. @shoghicp I can 100% confirm that the issue is NOT fixed. The player count stacks up to 65/65 and doesn't log the players out. \n. @shoghicp Here is the error I get on console when this happens. [ERROR] An E_WARNING error happened: \"Illegal offset type in isset or empty\" in \"/src/pocketmine/scheduler/ServerScheduler\" at line 122\n. It also says that they are online when they really are still stuck in the loading menu. \n. Removing the player profile file manually seems to let users be able to log back in. I will monitor the issue and see if it comes back after a fresh profile. \n. What do you mean by that? They spawn in chunks that the server has already generated. I assume it is getting stuck when the generated chunks are loaded. Perhaps a plugin like alwaysspawn can fix this?\n. That sounds to be the problem. It's hard to develop software when the other party refuses to add some patches that help out. At first I thought this problem was a plugin but it is not and as I said, not even a restart can get players back in. \n. @shoghicp Ok so I relaized that the buidling terrain bug happens when you are far out from spawn. My admins were building a dropper way out in the world and used a waep to get to it. If you log out from that location,  that is where you get the building terrain bug. I even reproduced it myself. I will try to get the exact cords of the locarion if you would like. \n. Cannot re-produce this issue only in 1 specific warp location on the server. Closed \n. I suggest using an auto restart plugin that can regularly stop and restart the server. This doesnt always help but can still fix a lot of issues. \n. This is happening every time now. It used to happen only a few times. Now every time I do /stop, it happens. \n. A note: CTRL+C does not stop the proccess, it is frozen completely\n. I use htop :) \n. On build 576, the server cannot unload the world even after 10 minutes of being on. I tried to use a short stroke restart method (restarting the server every 10 minutes) and that worked only a few times. Still trying to test a few things out. Will report further incidents here. \n. Will test this soon. @shoghicp the reason this is so vital is networks like ours like ti Auto restart the nodes. Thanks for the commit!\n. @shoghicp Unfortunately, server is still caught on Unloading world. CTRL+C does not kill the proccess, which confirms that it is truly frozen.\n. I waited for about a minute. So I need to wait a bit longer? \n. Yes, give me a few hours. Will report results. Thanks!\n. Just installed build 585, will test level unloading in a few hours after the server has been full for a while. \n. @shoghicp In my first test, the world unloaded properly. That was with around 25 people online. Let me test is a few more times. Seems to be working at the moment! Thanks!\n. Attempt number 2 at 21 players online was a success. World IS unloading and the server is stopping as it should!\n. Increase  \"output_buffering\" in php.ini \n. The best thing to do is restart it manually every three hours or so. It will not get stuck if you do small intervals. \n. This was caused by a plugin, please do not report this here. This needs to be sent to the developer of the plugin \"CreativeWorld\"\n. I had this issue when warping across the map, from x 128 to like 6000. I found out it was my connection. Where are you hosting PM from?\n. Not all PC blocks are supported and even if it is slabs, their data may be different than pocketmine. Unsupported blocks will show up as white wool. \n. Does armor require bounding code like regular blocks do? That may be the Moved Wrongly message although that is now a regular thing in console. \n. Gotcha. I am really working hard on learning how PM works. Been browsing a lot of code, very cool. But anyway I will let you know if I come across any armor issues as well. So far, nothing. Players have been using armor without error. \n. Here is an image of this, notice how my name is still logged in. https://i.imgur.com/FSlaQV4.png\n. Thank you. \n. @HmHmmHm Perhaps use another paste website as that one seems to have errors with a few characters. Also I doubt you need to past the entire log, just the section when the crash happened. \n. It is set to true, so yes. (In pocketmine.yml)\n. Alright. Thank you, goodnight :) \n. This fixed it! Sweet dreams! \n. Will test in a few hours.\n. This is not an issue with PocketMine as you are modifying the source code, I assume.\nThis would better be posted on the PM forums.\n. Sorry about that, how do we reference crash reports that are in the archive? I don't see a link to the report right after the server crashes. \nIt's funny you say that because an admin was just on our survival server and I joined. There were about 17-20 carpet tiles floating in the air around an active build area. Not sure if they were placed by someone or not. It was somewhat random. They were stacked. I will find more information right now!\n. Found the report! The list feature is now working, wasn't up last time I checked. http://crash.pocketmine.net/view/38043\n. With build 580, I have not seen this crash for a while. I will tell a build team to hop on and test. \n. @shoghicp I am not able to reproduce this bug. Haven't seen this crash since I first reported it.\n. Perhaps bounding block code has not been added to doors yet?\n. Yeah I read the documentation in the latest SA re;lease that stated it will cause lag. I have server on auto restart every 20 minutes, it has been helping :)\nGive me a day or two to get some results together without using plugins! Thanks Shoghi, you are truly an amazing developer and person. Keep going! \n. Our creative server uses SA for authentication but has less plugins than survival. It hangs just a bit but the \"moved wrongly\" spam is not present in that console since it is creative and NOT survival. \n. @shoghicp Ok server lag is almost unbearable now. Players are now having the issue where they login and the player recognizes that they are logging in but the screen gets stuck at loading server/ building terrain. I can't auto restart the server anymore because of the unloading world getting stuck. \n. Ok I will update! \n. Hmmm, still trying to confirm this. Maybe it was a temporary bug? I will test after work. \n. Most of our building that is not saving is at spawn. Our main build area is 6000 blocks away from spawn and that seems to save data correctly. Like I said, I will keep my eye on this :) \n. When many people are on the server 30-40, the data does not seem to get saved. Warps and commands do, not the physical blocks. \n. Hmm, same thing with the advanced cache bug we found, if you tap the area, the blocks will come back. \n. That would require a plugin to log break and place actions. A database (sql) is your best bet\n. @shoghicp Signs are especially bad at this. We have had a major influx of players in the past 2 days so our server is always at 85-100% load as expected therefore I cannot test things the way I would like to. I cannot place signs anymore without them disappearing. Perhaps doing /save-all AFTER placing a new signs can fix this temporarily? \nAlso, is there any documentation available for Advanced Cache?\n. Use SSH (Putty for windows) and SSH into the server and use a screen to keep the server online after you disconnect. If you need help for that, go to forums.pocketmine.net/forums \n. Please use the search function to see if your issue has already been reported. Do not make duplicate issues, it clogs up the bug tracker. \nReference #1750\n. Please do us a favor and close it :) The PocketMine devs don't forget bugs :) \n. This issue has since \"stopped\" in the latest builds however it may still need a look into. I have a feeling most of this was caused by server lag. With all the optimization love PM has gotten, this issue is rare. I will report back if we come across it and how to re-produce it.\n. @shoghicp Only in rare circumstances am I able to produce it. However, we still get requests for player profile resets because they are in a death loop. I will go ahead and close this.\n. I am not too familiar with Soft however, does it incorporate the \"Allow flight\" setting in server.properties?\n. Reference #1920 \n. @shoghicp Ah I see. I still have yet to study that part of the code. Thanks for the heads up.\n. Windows XP is no longer supported as it does not use PHP 5.6.0\nPlease use the search function before submitting an issue. \n. For us, trying to run a PC world did not work out well.\n. The client could not load the world correctly. Perhaps this is a Mojang bug, not PM \n. Then use a PM world for now :)  Remember, this is beta, not stable! \n. Yes\n. Are you spawning in the block itself? What version of PM are you running? \n. Using build 586, I am having no problems with chat. @jose-vm if you are using permissions, make sure the group has the broadcast permission.\n. @jose-vm Because PM uses threading and such, the console will have 20 TPS but in game, there can still be chat lag. Different actions run on different threads. One thread could be getting hammered with requests, the other could be 100% fine.\n. No. It is much easier to use tabs than spaces. Whether small code, or big code. Since no reason has been given, I concur that this IS NOT a necessary change. \n. LOL Shoghi! \nI have noticed this on our survival node's spawn.

We only had one incident where on PM dev build was IFFY but other than that, the builds seem stable enough to update. \nHow will the updates be handled if many commits are released at once? Will the channel (Beta, Dev, Stable) be an option for us to choose which updates we want?\nNO for the Auto-update by default. Same reasons as pretty much everyone else! \n. @shoghicp Ok that is what I thought, thank you.\n. I forogt to add my NO for making it default. Same reasons as everyone else. Thanks \n. @shoghicp Roger that! \n. Either the client is not loading (stuck on generating world) OR the client freezes as soon as they get on the server and are able to join. We think it may be device specific but many ARE experiencing this issue on BCN. We will be doing some tests to try and replicate it in the most efficient way as to better help the developer team solve it! \n. Also a note, players report the freezing happens when they warp or go back to spawn (press the spawn button on the death menu). \n. ",

    "brundizzle": "..or shoudl it be:  Paintings don't drop WHEN their support block is removed\n;)\n. Same issue here.  I have a large area covered with carpets. \nif it helps: here's the report: http://crash.pocketmine.net/view/38061\n. Just had another one: http://crash.pocketmine.net/view/38070\nSome background on the area where it happens:\n1)  I have \"floating carpets\"  ... created in an earlier version of the server by putting a carpet on a block (any block) and then removing the block again...  the carpet would stay.  I created a complete roof using that method...  now when I remove a carpet the servers crashes.\n2) though this is reported as another bug somewhere else..  I have \"invisible fire\"  in that area. (https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/issues/1663)\n3) probably not related: when placing a new door, it only shows the bottom half of the door \nall the above in creative mode\nshould there be any other info I could provide, let me know.\ncheers\n. update:\nI found out that when I place blocks under the floating carpets again.. en then delete the blocks, the server doesn't crash.   \nAt least this way I can get rid of the flying carpets (though I really like them).\nissue #2 and #3 (half door amd invisable fire) remains though..   I am running deb build 559, so I won't report it as a bug until 1.4 becomes stable. \n. I am afraid I can't test this...  it happened when I used \"flying carpets\"  .. the possibility of placing \"flying carpets\" seemed to be a bug in an earlier version that got corrected so I can't build a surface with it and then test it.\n. Having this problem as well, also in previous builds.  Seems to concentrate on certain areas of the map. At first I thought it had to do with the (wifi) connection to the machine I was running the server on. I installed it on another machine (both linux boxes) that has good connection.. problem remained.   (I was hoping a bad connection was causing it) \n. spawnig @ 128, 68, 128  and having a persistent spot of non saving blocks @\n-14, 68, 185\n. @shoghicp if it helps i could send the world files and the coords where the problem occurs. \ncheers\n. @tnpxxsheepdog..   how do I \"tap the area\"? \n. is there anyeay I can set the server to a low level log?   I am thinking along the lines of\"\n added block 123 @ x,  y, z\"\nor\n removed block @ x, y, z\n. for what it\"s worth:  i thought it might be caused by some syncing issue..  i. e.  placing blocks is shown on the client,  but for some reason doesn't get to the server (maybe because of being (too)  busy.. \nhowever,  just checked with another use..  i can see him placing blocks..  so that means the place action does get communicated to the server and the server forwards the action to my client.\nhowever.. it does nosave the information,  so after a reconnect  the stuff is gone again. \nis there such a tool as \"world consistency checker?\" \n.

This is because you haven't installed php\nThe windows installer from the stable release install this automaticaly\nbut if you want to use the developer version follow this steps:\n1. Download the windows installer\n2. Install it\n3. Start it ones\n4. Download dev release\n5. Copy the bin folder and php.bat file from the folder created by the installer to the dev release\n6. enjoy\n. Your stuff will not be gone , it will just clear your hotbar but you keep your items.\nThis is a Mojang issue so pocketmine can't do anything about it.\n. Just use the windows installer from http://www.pocketmine.net/\nIt will install it automatically\n. This is the same error as our issue https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/issues/463\nSometimes it can't find the function distance :(\n. Install using the installer http://www.pocketmine.net/\n. 1. You propebly set your gamemode to adventure. or mining at the spawn\n2. The chunks thing is kinda normal when you have lag\n3. Mobs aren't supported yet,  you could spawn them,  but they won't move\n. https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/archive/master.zip\n. Have you installed the pocketmine-realms plugin?\nBecause it gives you always that warning : \"[NOTICE] Check if you have port-forwarded your server correctly, if not, external players won't be able to play.\"\nBut just ignore that message\n. https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/wiki/Setting-up-a-Server\n. > Who'll make an Apple dev account only for install PocketMine?\n\nThere should be a form to install the server without doing that.

I bet it's because of you or your device\n. You can buy a realms server but... I dissuade that.\nYou could better host a PocketMine server on your pc and install the realms plugin\nso you can control it from your ipod\n.

Wait a minute to load the world, the client generaded a fake world but the server is sending the correct chunks\n. Does anybody understand his slang?\n.

Use the PocketMine-realms plugin : https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-Realms\n. https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-Realms/blob/master/README.md\n. You can use rcon for that.\nTheir are a couple good webbased rcon scripts that you can run on your website.\nCheck the server.properties , you can enable rcon their and set a password\nor if you've a android phone you can use JRCON https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jca2323.jRCON&hl=nl\n. 1. You've to write a plugin for that, or search for some like https://github.com/wrewolf/Minecraft-MP-plugins/blob/master/Portal.php\n2.

I sometimes see the text of the sign but the sign is missing, but I think that mojangs problem, and when I relog the issue is gone\n. Same as our issue : #467 \nI hope this bug get fixed soon\n. You've to use your public ip not you local one\ngo to http://whatismyipaddress.com/ to see your public ip\n. You need to install a terminal like this one : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jackpal.androidterm&hl=nl\nand change the permissions of the php folder by typing \"chmod 0755 bin/php\" in the terminal.\nThen typ \"bin/php PocketMine-MP.php\" in the terminal to start the server.\nI hope you understand now\n. #467 \n. These error's happen on many places\n. What plugins do you use?\n. What's wrong with http://mcpestats.com/ ?\nAnd for more servers then 4 on one IP use the plugin https://github.com/PocketMine/MultiServer\n. Or adventure mode :D\n. > Minecraft PE does suppose unicode char now , why dont't developer adding other languang support in pocketmine?\n\nI try to modify the source and translate some of them into chinese and it does work!\nSorry for the strange English X(\n\nBecause he doesn't speak chinese =P\n.

No, I like PDO more for making databases then direct sqlite3.\nPDO makes it also easier for plugin makers to let the user decide to use sqlite3, mysql, ...\nI made a plugin that uses PDO but I need to make a extension installer for it.\nIt would be easier if the pocketmine installer would install this php extension automaticly\n. > Somehow, adding support for PDO breaks compilation on several systems.

Does it stop or does it freeze?\nCompiling php takes a long time\n. One solution: buy a better smartphone\n. This is an error caused by one of your plugins.\nTest your plugins individually and give us the code of the non working plugin\n. you can use $this->api->level->get($name) to see if the level is loaded\n.

Yeah thats why I never complained XD I wish lbsg servers would also spawned sheep and chicken so you can get fresh meat and they dont move!!! but whatevs close this topic before we get in trouble, shogicp should add the option for the op to set true if they want armor to drop upon deathy or false, way better that way!!!\n. Yeah, really annoying especially when I farm..\n. Why hasn't anyone marked it in the feature list?\n. Omfg stop complaining about this XD even armor resets when you logout and the good thing is that you never lose armor even when you die! these are just a few of the many bugs we gotta keep on the hush hush so williamtdr doesn't find out and fixes them, because in LBSG these come in quite handy!!!\nList of handy bugs.\n1. When you log out life, item and armor damage reset.\n2. When you die your armor stays on.\n3. Flint and steal works great even in pvp off servers to stop greifers!!!\n4. Flint and steal, lava, and water work in spawn protected areas, good for greifing or spawn kills I guess....\nRemember hush...\n. nicely put jdog but have a theory of my own, in MCPE vers. 0.7.3 remember how you would get the wrong amount number of items shown in the crafting table UI and when you had like 1 iron it said you had like 87 or so? Well maybe that is the problem, the client thinks it has 87 when it really has 1 and the server knows it has 1 so when the client crafts a diamond helmet out of 1 diamond the server freaks out and goes like \"nuh uh!\" and resets your hot-bar, well inventory for that case, maybe that is what is happening or at least what happened to some people with glitchy old versions of android (Android tends to be more glitchy due to skins, god I hate droid skins!!!) but yes that was back in 7.3 so I highly doubt it...\n. thare are alot more epic bug XD good for lbsg too.\n. Ok, go to your server.properties file in the pocketmine folder Pocketmine-PM=>server.properties and open it with notepad if you have windows, if you have mac I'm pretty sure you should use textedit and then down whare it says \"server-port\" delete every thing after the = sign but don't delete the stuff on the other lines, and then place a random 5-digit number where the text that you deleted was at, and save the document, now you may need to reconfigure your portforword settings on your router to match the port you gave the server, but besides that evrything shoud be fine, your welcome!!!\n. OMG thank you!!!\n. Spencer animals in pocketmine servers cause ALOT of lag and the movement AI for them has not been added to PM, but hopefully in the future they will add that option to allow animals to move!!! Lag is also the reason water doesn't flow, but in a old PM vers. I remember that it did...\n. have you port-forworded correctly? maybe that is your issue, also what do you mean by the second part about lifeboat survival games?\n. Look if your computer is connected DIRECTLY to the modem, then you don't need to portforword, you just need to find your IP and get the port that you assigned the server in the server.properties file, the video you were watching is not misleading but it doesn't present enough information, if you want the server to go public like lbsg then you must Portforword (Through your wifi router configurations) or if your are connected directly to the modem then just find your ip give it out with the port you assigned the server to.\nIf you did not portforword and you want a private server then turn it on, the server and connect it to a wifi network and then get your phone or tablet and connect it to the same wifi and then run minecraft pe and go to play, the server should appear amongst the play menu...\nYour friend,\nGAMESTER\n. well maybe it is your computers time, because the server comes and gets the time variable the computer supplies, kinda like javascript, so just change the time of your laptop and tell me if it works :D-b\n. Can you be more specific?\n. Hmm, well does it say that on the console? shogi should look into this.... man this is high priority, give me the specs of your computer/droid.\n. well you can always try the console's text interface but it takes a long time to scroll up that for if the user logged in a couple weeks prior to the search, actually this should be added to pocketmine, a list of all the users that ever joined when did they join and when did they leave, maybe as a text file.... but no there is no way to do what your are trying to do except by checking he console.\n. hmm,,, this could also be accomplished using a plugin that reads the players folder on stuff, so request this plugin....\n. what do you mean?\n. Oh #stupidity\n. 1. Yes you can drop items they just don't get pushed away in front of your entity (you) like offline due to pocketmine not having z dimensional (Up and down) path engine or something, this is the same reason arrows don't work, also animals but that is something else...\n2. The late pickup is because your computer is not fast enough to process all the servers physics and such at once that is why late pickup happens or as it is called lag, but a good tip is mining the block above the one that your are trying to pickup, that usually helps, and the reset of your hot bar is due to the server sending new inventory information back to your device, I know I hate that too but that is MCPEs fault not pocktmine...\n. do you mean a database IN the server, or like the connection of a database?\n.

Typically you see a list of local games as well as any games being broadcast by other IOS devices on in the local broadcast domain (i.e., subnet).\nI'm not sure what I would portforward.  As I understand it portforwarding allows a NAT device to take packets arriving on the public interface that match a specific signature (typically a protocol/port pair) and forwards them to a predetermined IP address on the private subnet.  In my case there is no router or NAT device involved.

Instead of breaking it just continues to execute code on a player and that makes the server crash.\n. ## Contributing Code\n- Use the Pull Request system, your request will be checked and discussed.\n- Create a single branch for that pull request\n- Code using the syntax as in PocketMine-MP.

    "gotheike": "I added the fix in a fork and suggested a pull request...\nBoth times i missed a semicolon (this codecopy as well as the real commit-refixed)\nClosing this issue as the pull request is better...\n. I missed a semicolon on the first line:\n $delay = 1;\nSorry, retyped it as i have the repository on my winbox and running the server on ubuntu..\n. Ok, nice... GitHub automatically adds the additional fix to the pull request...\n. This fix ONLY fixes the high CPU load on an idle system. \nThat is: no users online or all idle. as soon as users logon and start doing actions the delay will become reset and responds 'as usual'. If your system is dimensioned with minimal resources, this will not(!) allow more users to logon. This as it only increments the time the system pauses when it is idle, allowing other processed to do things.\nWhat someone with a high-load system could test is to reduce the value incremented with ($delay+=1000;) and set it to a lower value (like 100 or 50); This should allow a longer period in which the system expects a follow-up message. At the moment after about 1 second there will be a 25 ms delay (1/40th second) before any message will be processed. Setting it to for example 100 will keep the system responding a tiny bit faster during for example 10 seconds (with more CPU-load to be expected...) As the system had nothing to do for the past 1000 ms i don't think a user will notice the additional 25ms...\nThis is what i referred to that tweaking the values should be tested, but i found those to be quite OK!\n. The timed items should not be an issue and burts packets is solved by the resetting of the delay as soon as the first packet gets handled. So it should be a full win, possibly needing some thinkering with the values.\nI am happy that my server (a vm) now does not eat a full vcpu for the loop, leaving more resources for the other vm's.\n. Having the same...\nWhat i noticed is that when you break a block and it still is on the same level it is pickable, but sometime blocks can not be picked up when it has fallen down because there is no block below.

There is almost noone around here who can code apps. Especially for iOS it's a pain in the ass (Swift = brainfuck).\nAnd secoundly, if you want to just have the terminal from your pc on your device use RCON/PocketDockConsole. Rcon apps can be found\n. And this is a place for issues and btw this project is dead\n. @extremeheat Already pointed out RCON is being usable.\nto that swift thingy: I was aware that iOS supports Objective-C but Mono sounds new\n. Such descriptive issue\n. phar:/// seems weird\nI think ios is too stupid for opening phar\n. Well the client wouldn't be able to render these skins in the old version\n. maybe it was planned to violate 'em?\n. Use the latest version of pocketmine\n.

And mojang is desperate to do so i think, we're a real issue for REALMS. (Well as i think about this maybe there are some humans at mojang, because they did not (yet) remove the external server feature).\n. Good explanation @richardpickett . And this repo is really dead, Intyre himself has pointed that out (not publicly though).\nI do not know if shoghicp plans to do ANYTHING. If I would be him and I created a project which has got the attention of over 1000 (probably 10000) I would NEVER throw it away. I may come to a point were i can't contribute to it anymore. But I would give the keys to it to someone who i trust and let him continue is. We're locked out of this Project.\n\n[And giving Intyre the admin permission are a few clicks done in 1 minute. He could add @dktapps or other ppl that are actually good in coding and maintaining a project and we'd have an active project. An attempt to continue the original PM is currently made here: https://github.com/iTXTech/PocketMine-MP I recommend anyone who wants the clean codebase of PM, but at least protocol updates and fixes i recommend using that.]\n. The biggest design flaw is even starting to design a game server on PHP.\n. that's not even good english.\nShould we contact Github about this real spam?\n.

Go here and compare the pages. https://account.pocketmine.net/m/login\n. If not, open a browser and go to https://account.mojang.com/m?app=mcpe and see what it looks like.\n. Sure.\n. Please join http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=pocketmine&uio=d4 for support setting up a server.\n. Remove all plugins and restart the server. The server should work. Then add each plugin one by one to see which plugin is causing the problem.\n. Remove all plugins you have installed. Once removed the server should work. Then add plugins one by one to figure out which plugin causes the lockup.\n. The only way you could do it would be if you are jailbroken. If that is the case and you have enough knowledge to use ssh, you may be able to install it. Other than that, it is not possible.\n. This is a known issue. #552 \n. This isn't an issue with the server software. Server stops and restarts are directly dependent on the owner of that server. Please contact the owner of the server for support with the problem.\n. Due to the fact that Mojang disables the ability to connect through 3g/4g it doesn't seem likely. (Talking solely for iOS devices) There are some methods that could make this possible though. If you were jailbroken, there are some ways that you could make it work. You would need to install some 3rd party applications in order to make it possible. Things like 3g unrestrictor mimic a wifi connection on the device even if you are connected to 3g/4g. You would need to make some modifications to the devices /etc/hosts file to make it funnel traffic between the custom realms service. Keep in mind that the connection will be extremely laggy and unreliable. Though this method requires a jailbreak, a third party application on the app store for iOS devices called Multiplayer PE has PocketMine realms hooked with the application. It allows playing on servers, and creating servers on a mobile connection. Please keep in mind this application and 3G unrestrictor are both not free.\n. Please don't post for help with things that do not have anything to do with the server software. If you need help, please join http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=pocketmine&uio=d4 and ask for help there.\n. It would be a bit more helpful if you could provide OS information.\n. Those are color codes. It could be that the mintty (the terminal emulator) didn't initialize properly.\n. Hoster issue. I recommend sending that to your server administrator because there is already an instance running on that ip and port combination\n. Not a PocketMine problem. Please contact Mojang with the issue.\n. Word wrap would help the problem, but it would not solve the problem. It is still a Mojang issue, an they need to fix it.\n. Compile php with the openssl extension.\n. There are compiled versions of PHP available with both mysql and openssl. The truth is, unneeded extensions could slow the speed of PHP. Best to keep it with the essentials and if its needed, the user can install it.\n. Seems like the world isn't saving properly. Try running save-all then stop the server.\n. This cannot be done due to the way MCPE sends inventory packets. Ultimately, you will crash after a gamemode change if you do not get disconnected.\n. Odd. What version of OSX are you using?\n. Hmm, making sure the log stream doesn't get too big is also pretty important.\n. You can use DevTools to make it so you only have to make a folder with your plugin structure. The plugin would then be loaded without having to make a phar.\n. But you're closing the connection. The user will not be able to join.\n. Yes\nIn reality, spaces are the standard. For instance, when using a tab on my system, the margins may be entirely different from a tab on another system, but spaces are a standard size. Also, the IDE (as with any text editor) has the ability to change the tabs to spaces and allow you not to have to \"scroll through the spaces\" it would just jump to the next time it finds a character. Many programming languages use spaces as the standard (because you are able to correctly measure them), adding to the reason for which spaces should be used.\n. LGTM\n. You have to load the chunks prior to running that function or it will not work properly.\n. Chunks aren't loaded by default start, if a user joins and is in that vicinity when you execute that code, you should get tiles. Take a look at using load chunk also\n. The switch statement is unnecessary in this situation.\n. ",

I deleted everything in the folder and backed up custom files like plugins, then installed clean and re-applied my custom files. The laggy player movements are still obviously there, and very noticible, but I feel it is better than it was before...\nI've been using dev builds because some of the features (like TNT working, and flint in creative) was too good to pass up. By the way, if you're completely re-coding Pocketmine, why are you still working on these tiny things?\nAlso, if you want an example of the player movements, here's my server IP.

I don't think that's the case though, as I don't have any plugins that effect players specifically. It happens randomly, and the player just freezes at where it starts occuring. Then I cannot teleport to them, or teleport them to me. The body that freezes still uses the animations that the invisible player has though.\n. You already have a program bound to the port 19132. Stop that program, or change the port Pocketmine uses in the server properties file.\n. /me @all @all @all spams the chat with a giant line of player names. I'm not exactly sure what the command itself does, but I have removed it from my API.\n. Oh, so it's a worthless command. Thanks for clearing that up! :+1: \n. Yup, works now. Why's this occurring?\nEDIT: Also, completely different issue: Whenever I try to stop the server with the \"Stop\" command, it just throws \"bin\\php\\php.exe: Exit 1\" instead of closing out of the window. What do I need to make it know how to close the window?\n. But Pocketmine doesn't detect this as flying?\n. Any progress on this? Still happens on the latest build. Makes gameplay impossible.\n. Still doing it on 0.9.0 Build 10. Sorry for the constant updates, but this seems like a drastic issue.\n. 0.9.0 \"Final\" still has this issue.\n. @williamtdr That's what makes me question the \"It's Mojang's Fault\" theory.\n@iksaku Yeah, I was just playing on a local server, and had it port-forwarded to a so few of my friends over the internet could play, and my game regularly crashed every 10-15 minutes.\n. This happens to Armor as well. As soon as you craft most \"tools\", they just disappear like the server doesn't like them.\n. @PEMapModder It's a programmed server issue, everyone on my server complains about it.\n. @tnpxxsheepdog This would be Windows.\n. @Gonbe34 Nah, PM was using about 5-10% of my CPU when this was happening.\n. I just don't understand why it only affected clients. I was able to use the console itself to send commands, and they went through as normal (No lag). It's as if the clients are refusing to send information to the server. Like they're holding onto the information for a random amount of time, and then releasing it.\nThat would mean it's a MCPE issue, though. Hopefully that means it will be fixed when we're able to test 0.9.2 on PocketMine.\n. @iksaku Really? Did you test it on a local MCPE server or a PocketMine server?\n. @iksaku I'm on it right now, I just haven't really tested it. I think I will right now. :P\n. Is it bad that I can't even join games? My client(s) is just stuck at \"Locating server\" completely frozen (The little spinny icon to the right doesn't even move). On the server I'm just suspended in mid-air.\nThis is on iOS and Android, so I guess multiplayer is just screwed for everyone.\n. Another thing to mention is that players constantly get disconnected due to \"timeout\" (That might be SimpleAuth, though, not quite sure). Remember that this is not a CPU or network issue on my end.\n. This seems to be a SimpleAuth issue. Disabling \"forceSingleSession\" in the SimpleAuth configs makes this stop.\n. @Gonbe34 Yeah, it usually occurs when more than 5 players are on.\n. It's kinda been toned down with recent updates, but it still occurs occasionally.\nRemember that sending commands from the server itself to the client aren't laggy, but client commands sent to the server are laggy.\n. @Gonbe34 Same exact processor I use.\n. @PEMapModder Well it's not an internet problem I don't think, as I'm still able to send commands to clients immediately. It's just commands sent to the server from the client that are laggy.\n. Still happening. Is anyone else having this issue, or is it just me?\n. Yeah, that sounds like the best explanation to describe what's occurring. A command \"queue\" is made.\n. Today's updates have definitely fixed the chat being an issue (No more lag in that field), but like you said, anything else is still sent in a queue.\n. Got about 10 people on all at the same time with no issues, so it seems fixed. Thanks for the help!\n. @tnpxxsheepdog I haven't noticed any lag anymore, maybe a few stutters here and there, but nothing major. Just a lot of client crashing.\n...A LOT of crashing.\n. @shoghicp Awesome, it's way better than nothing. Thanks a bunch!\n. I don't think players can craft arrows yet, so that shouldn't be an issue. But, by spawning, do you mean players dropping them?\n. I'll just disable PVP for this test. That'll keep item drops at a minimum.\n. @shoghicp I don't see any real lag. In fact, it seems smoother than last time.\nMaybe that's just because players aren't bobbing up and down out of the ground anymore.\n. @shoghicp I re-enabled PVP (Therefore more player item drops) and players seem to move at a very low tick rate. It kinda looks like how it did back when Simpleauth reading the massive text file would cause the server to lock up all the time.\n. It doesn't unload, it just loops at all these errors shown above. That's why I reported it.\n. Pretty regularly. Just now checked if it did last night, and it did.\n. It could be a 32-bit only issue, too. I really wish 64-bit PHP worked in Windows.\n. I could try running it in compatability with Windows 7 for a little bit, then.\n. It already was, so I took it out of compatibility to see if that'll help.\nBy the way, that error runs until the entire program runs out of memory:\n\n. I could make a new world I suppose. Maybe it's just a specific issue with this one...\nBy the way, is it possible to import maps from MCPE itself, and still generate the world like it would on these devices? I hate the 3 default worlds PocketMine makes, and changing the seed doesn't seem to make any difference. I remember in pre-0.9.x worlds that the seed was just something sent to the client to make loading times better, but is this still the case in PM 1.4?\n. Seems to stop happening when you set the render distance lower.\n. I can confirm that this happens on every new world that is generated. I was trying to start a new world, but couldn't because I kept falling out of the world.\n. https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/issues/1538\n. Thank you!\n. @williamtdr Don't want to start a new issue just in case this is related to the same thing, but something else is now occurring (At a seemingly less active rate).\n\n. @williamtdr It's not an issue at all, I'm just happy that PocketMine is getting better, one step at a time.\n...However, the most recent commit doesn't look to have helped that much.\n\n. @williamtdr Same thing still happens! xD\n\n. Build # 300, right? Still does it. :/\n. Yup, fixed now! Thanks a bunch!\nAlso, the lag appears to be gone... Now my server is actually playable. :O\n. @williamtdr It's back on # 302...\n. https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/issues/1722\n. @swagking47 BALLS DEEP.\nDepth doesn't matter, but I did test it on water that is a good 10 blocks in depth. So, yes?\n. @PEMapModder You mean like what I previously reported in #1722? That isn't what occured in this case, at least from my viewpoint.\nAnd yes, the disable messages are just log filler. :P\n. @dutok The disable messages? Nah. Though, I haven't noticed it happening recently... Perhaphs it was fixed on one of the latest builds. Hell, I'm noticing a lot more buttery-smoothness on today's builds.\n. It doesn't really crash anymore, it just runs until it essentially freezes. After that, no one can join, and players that were on it while it froze appear to stay on there forever. I gotta go in and manually restart it, it won't just run on it's own. :(\n. @shoghicp Didn't realize there was a specific type. Where do I check?\n. @shoghicp It's whatever the default is, how about that?\n. Same thing happens to me constantly on the latest dev build. Happens once or twice every 15-20 minutes. Same errors listed above.\n. I can confirm that players are appearing to fall through the ground on my server, too.\n. @Mooncoder Latest dev build.\n@jhedlund It is not.\n. @PEMapModder More than likely a client render issue. As the user falls down, the game quickly pushes them back up to their actual position. Almost as if the game isn't registering players as being on the ground.\n. Can report that this is still happening.\n. @shoghicp It's somewhat fixed. Players still jerk under the ground in a really fast \"Up and down\" motion while walking, but when they're standing still they aren't stuck under the ground.\n. Yeah, I can confirm this as well. You can stop it from occurring as often by lowering the view distance.\n. Is there any current work around to this? It's happening incredibly frequently, I can't keep the server running but for about an hour before the entire thing just locks up and becomes unusable.\n. @shoghicp Happens with my iPhone and my Android Tablet.\nThis map was generated from Minecraft PC version 1.2. Going through the front entrance, and walking up to the Diamond/Gold house would cause my game to crash very regularly when building it. I was switching from survival to creative before going to it, though. Other than that, it's random. You just gotta walk around the world a little bit until it happens. I will say that it seems to crash a lot more around the spawn, though...\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/37472031/Files/MISC/Multiplayer.zip\n. @Shoghicp That's odd, it works fine usually. How do I know which blocks to remove?\n. @shoghicp The same characteristics occur with that issue, too? As in, the intense lag and such?\n. Cool, thanks for the info.\n. @shoghicp I thought so, sorry about all of the spam reports. I just wanna help the cause as much as possible.\n. Ha, that was fast.\n. Now it's working, how odd. It showed in my inventory that I had two, but when I tried to place them, they would not place, and would disappear from my hotbar. Almost like the game was saving fake items to my player file.\nAnyway, this doesn't seem to be an issue anymore. Thanks for the help!\n. I am able to craft armor fine on the latest dev build, and I've seen others using it as well.\n. Can confirm this as well.

    "TacticalCactupi": "Mkay, here's what I got: MCPE wasn't MEANT to handle a ton of players, let alone list them. Lag may also factor into this. Perhaps, if you have one, a permissions plugin is making the names unreadable, maybe due to prefixes, suffixes, etc.\n. Agreed with previous comments, but I think it is lag related. First off, it isn't about how much RAM you HAVE, but how much is DESIGNATED in the properties. I'd suggest 1.5 GB, but since I have 4 I set mine to 3.

This is for Pocketmine not for anything else!\n. Its only a bug\nI only give an issue..\n. I think thats because you have a very slowly wifi...\nBuy a new wifi or change your provider or you have a very slowly internet cable to your home\n. Ok then i can not help you :/\n. Strange...\n. Ahhhh\nAt this moment you updated php\n. No its still not working\n. Its php v5.5.9 \n. Still not working..\nHm..\nI think because im a noob\n. I saw it ^^\nCool!\n. Wenn du probleme meldest sollten die beschrieben sein und auf englisch! ;)\n. I agree\n. @pemapmodder\nBut it is a bug..\n. No, this is not presenting in  vanilla smp.\nAnd also im from switzerland, i dont understand all from english.. sorry\n. @lukedareling\nI know!\nBut it vanilla smp tall grass dont drop this...\nSo its cooler when its same like vanilla ;)\n. Haha \nSweet kid :D\n. @shoghicp and why this doesnt happend on realms?\n. But remember: they create only obsidian when the lava is a source block.\n. Pick up and placing werent added 3 days ago.\nNow they are added.\n. @BlinkSun @PEMapModder Sorry, ok I see.\nThanks\nI close the issue.\n. Yea.\nJust random fell out the world :(\nHad that too.\n. Yea.\nWhen you click on a stone it breaks/ disappears.\nBut only stone.\n. Hm..\nNot with gravel sand or dirt.\nYes, ONLY stone.\n. Chunk lag?\nIt happens every time.\n. Yes. :)\n. Yes ln 0.9.0 and 1.4\n. I had this stuck in generating world when I  wanted to join a 0.8.1 world from my brothers ipod in 0.9.0.\nIn local multiplayer.\nMaybe mcpebug.\n. As I said I mean local multiplayer.\nThere was the same issue!\n. @SurvivalHive Read the comments before you comment.\n. @KexyBiscuit MCPE dont crash.\nSo it doesnt ran out of memory\n. Is this fixed  in 0.10?\nLets test it! \\o/\nEDIT:\nJust crashing.\n. @iksaku not everytime.\n. @iksaku I made /give ;)\n. @iksaku I tried many things.\nThis happens on added and not added items...\n. Duplicate from #1908 \n. Cobweb is supposed to prevent drop damage when you fall on it. (MLG Cobweb)\n. Could someone ban KexyBiscuit?\n. Some of the things that you mentioned are non implemented feautures.\nThey are not getting fixed sooon.\nAlso betas are always buggy.\nThats why there called betas.\n. It seems the inventory doesnt update when you do /give\nSame hapens to me.\n. Tested on build 522.\nI also made a video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz22FAmwwMY\nThe build was the latest when I opened this issue.\n. Well..\nThese bugs doent appear in old builds.\n(I think)\nAnd a question...\nDo you give these MCPE client bugs to Mojang or are just mark them? \n. I testet it.\nIt doesnt happen so often anymore that it resets your inventory.\nBut it still does.\nbtw: I think the most crafting recipes are right.\n. Will this be fixed by Mojang in 0.10? D:\n. Thanks for fixing :)\n. This must be a bug..\nAlso noticed that sometimes.\n. Is this bug fixed in 0.10?\nEDIT:\nOk its not fixed.\n. Did you look in your inventory if there are the sticks and bonemeal?\nAnd the error with the sapling is (I think) because there is no bounding box added to it.\nMaybe.\nAlso please make for every bug an issue not multible bugs and only one issue.\n. This issue is duplicated by #2186 .\n. Oh I just read it false!\nThis is my fault.\nsorry.\n-Closed\n. I test this in 4-5 hours.\nIm not at home now.\nEDIT:\nVideo is uploading.\n. So I testet 10 mins long...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltw6D_v4KQE\nIt isnt because of the command.\nIt is because there is only one layer block.\nThen you just fall out the world again and again and again..\n. So I tested again on 0.10.0 with build 834\nWeird.\nSo I joined and I just fell out the world.\nBUT after some tries I dont fall anymore through!\nWeird...\nJust look at it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hgtT9Q-0ys\n. I found out that you are at the spawn for a pair of frames then it teleports you down.\n. Ok testet on another world.\nI didnt fall out the world.\nBut then I just dig blocks under the spawn away(so that it is 1 block thick).\nThen I fell through.\nThen I made it 2 blocks thick an it works normaly again.\n(BTW: Sorry for spamming comments)\n. I dont mean commands.\nIf you walk to any coordinate  in your world and you do /save-all or not or you restart your server or not, it just spawns you on the worldspawn  on next join.\n. Nope^^\n. Submit the crash log file.\n. what build are you using?\n. I have a slow pc here in the office.\nWhen I start pocketmine here it takes 20-30 seconds to start the process.\n. Duplicated by #2186.\n. Why didnt you tell this the mcpe devs?\n. Update to the newest build.\n. You cant fix that.\nThats normal.\nIts just a warning.\nPlease close.\n. Duplicated by #1683\n. @Emberous  This is because your network is slow. Had that issue also on 1.3 ;)\nJust the wlan or your bandwith is the problem.\n. @ibc-burst  Already reported #2186 \n. Oh Thank you guys! :+1: \n. Duplicated:\n2304\n. Do you have a good router/internet?\nDid you delete the player data?\n. Strange now its working o.0\n. This is because some items are not implemented yet.\nWhich items can you not place?\n. Did you check spawnprotection?\n. Are you OP?\n. Slow internet?\n. This must be your internet.\n. I also can reproduce it.\n. I cannot reproduce it on the newest build^^\n. So first I testet with the newest build\nThen I just downgraded more and more...\nAs I said still happened between 870-890.\nI dont now the exact build that was the lowest.\n. Ok there is definetly a bug. I testet more.\nOn beta 16 it just generated normally and was super fast.\nThen I took beta 17 and it was just massivley lagging like on the newest build and beta.\nSo I updatet beta 16 with several builds. Also build 900 was just generating fast.\nOffcourse I deleted the world  an player data on every change.\nOffcourse theres a bug^^\n. Yeah I know that with the changes. But thanks.\nI have windows 7 64bit.\nWhen more people having this problem would you look into it?\nI will make a video when I have time.\nThen you will understand what I mean exactly.\n. Ohhhh ok.\n. I have this bug too on the SG4 Map.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_muecCluc\n(Attention:Music is loud on the video)\n. I have one.\nI can give you the files tommorow :)\nAnd from me too a big thanks too @iksaku\nWorld loads so much faster in mcregion!\n. On which build are you?\n. Do you use Pocketmine generated worlds or Anvil worlds?\nAnvil worlds are buggy and use much performance.\n. We(Sulfatezz & me) already use MCRegion and it happens on all worlds.\n. http://www.mediafire.com/download/13g2zdwq6ram09u/Converter.zip\nLook at the bat file for more info.\n. I have this error tooo.\n. Thats the server ;)\n. Also it sometimes happen on full blocks when you move along.\nMaybe because of the grass, I dont know.\n. Intyre cant you ban this kiddy?\n. You know that you are getting really big problems dont you?\n. get a life bro\n. Dont you know that Github can IP ban you?\n. I think you mean the Fly Protection that causes that.\n. PC Servers also sometimes have problems with this. Fire logic in Minecraft...\nThis was already an issue on 1.3 and talked with shoghicp about that.\nYou just have to do a short click on the fire and it will dissappear.\nIf you do a long click on the fire, it will be invisible.\nDamn fire logic>.>\n. No windows is fixed.\n. Okay for me it is fixed on Windows 7 64Bit.\nStrange.\nEDIT:\nhttps://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/commit/2ea8835b12ce7a3dbb4829dd76605cd211306555\nYou have to be at least on build 1078, then it should be fixed.\n. :point_right: https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/issues/2904\n. Can reproduce\n. Same\n. For me there is no real \"error\".\nIt just says \"[CRITICAL] Could not tick level \"world\": Division by zero\" when I tp me in another level.\n. If you used MCEdit the Blank issue was MCEdit, I think.\n. Maybe 0.14.1 fixed the issue\n. ",

    "JDog1701": "i agree ^^^^^ it is an awesome bug. not all issues and bugs end with a bad thing, and this bug is useful because it may take alot of mining to make the armor and to not have it go to waste is quite cool\n. well isnt that a good thing?? lol\n. i too have the same issue, and i think i know why we have it. If your crafting things or placing/breaking things too fast the server etc hasn't loaded the full changes so instead of lagging it just simply reforms into what it was previously. i would place things too fast and it would disappear, but i then tried again slowly and in the end i got the job done. pocket-mine may need to update with the solvent to this bug because as an admin on survivalcraft people come with complaints that relate to what you are saying. i hope this helps you guys understand :D \n. i think that the ladder bug is awesome, it tricks people into thinking they can get into your house but the ladder blocks the entrance, it also helps you reach your things that are afloat but still looks like its afloat. this of course happens when you look at the side that doesn't show the ladder. This bug is probably the only bug that people actually like :)\n. ",

You won't be hacked if you open just the one port and run your server on it, though.\n. @SkygridRex Huh? Confused...\n. I think this crash is caused by the same thing that caused #3309. Proof:\n[104] ........{ //Not yet generated / corrupted, \n[108] MainLogger::getLogger()->error(\"Corrupted chunk header detected\");\n. @vvzar Does it crash on start or when someone joins?\nAnd what build?\n. So this really doesn't have anything to do with PocketMine, does it? Increase your server partition size.\n. About the plugins, probably not. (idk for sure though, not a plugin dev) Try writing a text file and saving it to the server partition. If it will not let you do it, it is just the out of space thing.\n. This also works with ladders.\n. On a hunch... try posting your server.properties file\n. How much ram are you allocating, @TahaTheHacker ?\n. All builds? What device are you running MCPE on?\n. This is probably lag.\n. Okay. I don't go mining on my server, so I wouldn't know...\n. It works fine for me... in survival...\nHaven't tested in creative. It actually shouldn't work in creative, because that's the way the creative inv. in MCPE is set up.\n. How do you get there using tp, @SkygridRex?\nOh right @JoahDave, try one of the two below:\n- (easiest) Delete your player file in PocketMine and restart\n- (better) Get another player. If the other player gets normal terrain, do /tp [you] [otherPlayer]\n. @SkygridRex That didn't take me to the far lands... (that actually took me to a coast off of a forest)\n/kill took me back.\n. Okay. Is it just the build, then? Looks like you tried something that is not in the Jenkins server? I have no idea how to compile from Github...\n. @PEMapModder dev 1258. It's shown in the attached picture.\n. How do I load the server like that? Do I paste --disable-ansi into server.properties?\nNote that I was running the Insider preview for a long time, and this never happened until now.\n. \nThe above is dev 907.\nSo it isn't Windows 10.\nI'll do that.\n. --disable-ansi works. It just removes color. Not a big problem, but it makes it hard to disinguish warnings from server thread.\n. Does this happen on other versions of Windows (and Linux/OS X) running dev 1258? Like Windows 8.1 and 7?\n. Ok. By the way, Jenkins is saying that Build Executor 1 and 3 are dead. No idea for sure what that means, but the log says that \"java.io.IOException: No space left on device\".\n. Dev 957 also has color. Will check dev 1257.\n. Okay! I tested with and without my plugins on dev 1257 and I still had color! It has to be a change from 1257 and 1258!\nHow accomplished I feel. Dunno why. :)\n. K hold on...\nwait, what do you mean fresh packaged? Do you mean run the installer and dump in 1258?\nGonna go ahead and do that.\n. Oops, sorry about the trouble.\nWait, what setting did that?\nAll of the same plugins in a new folder still gives me color...\n. ",

It takes at least two\narguments yet they don't seem to be used at all. Modifying the installer\nto run compile.sh with \"mac curl\" expressly solved all my issues.\nConsidering Macs are unicies without a package manager (ugh), I think it\nactually makes a lot of sense to grab the new dependencies with every\nnew version of the server. Homebrew/MacPorts are close, but they're not\nwell integrated, which makes them kind of useless when it comes to\nkeeping things updated. That being said, I would argue for expressly\ncompiling everything every time for Macs.\n. or maybe if only windows could use linux tools, then it could use the\nlinux installer.\n.

Neither of you are plugin developers, clearly. Even DevTools (an offical plugin) is giving the same error dump regarding sendChat(). And @player wouldn't work for sendChat because it's not an object. (That's not the problem, anyway.)\n. Ok, I guess I'll actually join the server to test my plugins from now on. :P XD But, @shoghicp, DevTools gave me an error dump and crashed the server when I tried typing \"pmfplugin RandomItem\" into the console.\n. @UltimateMcraft, why not?? ;D\n. He can't, he's banned.\n. What error?\n. This isn't a bug. :P\n. *LukeDarling\nAnd vanilla DOESN'T drop carrots and potatoes.\n. I get my carrots and potatoes from RandomItem. XD\n. Coming soon...\n. I don't know how to do that. XD\n. Saplings, however, are still ID 6.\n. That's not even what we're talking about. :-1: \n. If I tried, Humerus would delete it and call it \"Too simple\".\n. This was MY addition, and it was disapproved. >:(\n. I know it's not AdminArmor. ;) Probably the redstone plugin.\n. Use 1.0.3, it works perfect.\n. Maybe you should report it to Mojang?\n. http://oi62.tinypic.com/rck3lx.jpg\n. I did do my research first.\n. I'm just quoting it out of vanilla Minecraft 1.7.9. (I fixed the grammar in Bukkit, too.)\nEdit: They have strict rules right before a Minecraft release. https://github.com/Bukkit/Bukkit/pull/1079\n. I'll remove them in their next updates.\n. This feature hasn't been added yet. Please be patient. :)\n. Yes You can't type tabs on mobile devices, and spaces are easier to type, anyway.\n. The crashes are still happening after updating to the latest dev build. I've recorded some timings now. https://gist.github.com/8a99ba259065bedbb424\n. @shoghicp, this issue is not fixed... Are you going to reopen it, or should I make a new issue?\n. YES. This would be a great idea, as I do exactly what you said in your vote. It reduces the amount of invalid reports we get from older builds, since some people forget to update them. However, it should be disabled by default. I could see some crazy stuff going on if it was enabled by default.\n. @DovahDoVolom, as specified earlier, it will use the channel set for the update checker that is already in PocketMine.\n. I was having the same problem, but @HostingItAll somehow fixed it for me, but apparently not everyone.\n. I believe this is an issue with MCPE itself. I remember in one of the 0.10.0 beta changelogs, it says that items now flow in water.\n. Ok, I wasn't quite sure.\n. I have partial OCD, and it drives me insane every time I start my test server.\n. @WhiteWolfOwner, this is not being caused by a plugin. If you don't know what you're talking about, don't talk about it.\n. Yes. I am one of the people who can't stand Product version 0.3.0007.21 Beta 5.3.09.4 Alpha 4.3 Beta 2.0005.7\n. I wondered about that. That's why I said:\n\nI'm not sure if I should kick the player or not.\n. These are client-side bugs. They exist even in local worlds.\n. Center is spelled center, not \"centre\".\n. Actually, this isn't really a problem. Apparently, when you update PocketMine, it overwrites the start.sh file, disabling DO_LOOP again. ASR was restarting it once an hour, but because DO_LOOP got disabled, it just shut the server down.\n. This isn't a client-side issue... The problem is somewhere in PocketMine's new TranslationContainer. I've tried tracing the problem, but the network of files gets so complicated that I can't find where the variables get inserted.\n. @shoghicp, you made it seem like build 3 would have commands without PocketMine. It is, however, fixed on servers.\n. Please report this bug in the iProtector issues area. An admin will close this issue soon. https://github.com/LDX-MCPE/iProtector\n. I can confirm this bug. They turn invisible after they die, and they don't reappear until either you or the invisible player quit and re-join.\n. I have discovered a new cause. Players turn invisible when their name tags are changed. I have tested this thoroughly.\n. :+1:\n. Would you quit opening these?? Us watchers are tired of seeing you reopen the exact same pull request that doesn't even work, and then deleting and restoring the branch ten times.\n. Your world is corrupt. Try deleting it and letting PocketMine generate a new one.\n. This is not a bug. You should use the var_dump method to print objects.\n. This is a SimpleAuth bug. Please do not report plugin-caused issues on the PocketMine-MP repository.\n. This is a duplicate issue.\n. This is a duplicate issue. Please read the contribution guidelines before opening issues.\n. This crash was caused by EssentialsPE, not PocketMine. Do not report plugin problems in the PocketMine repository. Please read the contribution guidelines before opening issues.\n. Please read the Contribution Guidelines before opening issues.\n. This is not the repository for the PocketMine-MP for Android app. Please read the Contribution Guidelines before opening issues.\n. This is not a PocketMine bug, but an MC:PE bug. Please read the PocketMine Contribution Guidelines before opening issues.\n. These items are not yet implemented in PocketMine. Please read the Contribution Guidelines before opening issues.\n. @sekjun9878 You do know that this is a bug with MC:PE build 13, not PocketMine, right?\n. \n. This is happening with my server, too. I have disabled all plugins, but it still happened.\n. Would having DO_LOOP enabled, then stopping the server and spamming CTRL-C cause this issue?\n. Which issue is this a duplicate of? I have this problem to the extreme, even with 20 TPS.\n. This is a client-side issue. I discovered it while experimenting with Ghost Hack.\n. A plugin? It doesn't really matter. Even in vanilla MC:PE, touching an iron door doesn't open it.\n. @KyleTheHack3r It is a bug, regardless. You can't open iron doors in local MC:PE worlds, you can't open iron doors in MC:PC worlds, you can't open iron doors in vanilla MC:PC servers, and you can't open iron doors in Bukkit servers.\n. ```\n[23:53:03] [Server thread/INFO]: Loading HIDDEN v1.0b\n\nFatal error: Class pocketmine\\plugin\\PluginLogger contains 1 abstract method and must therefore be declared abstract or implement the remaining methods (Logger::logException) in phar:///root/HIDDEN/PocketMine-MP.phar/src/pocketmine/plugin/PluginLogger.php on line 27\n[23:53:03] [Server thread/EMERGENCY]: An unrecoverable error has occurred and the server has crashed.

    "falkirks": "Yes, but the symlinks are created by default and without a proper error or fix many people will report bugs with plugins which actually work fine. You could simply add an if(is_link($file)){ ... }\n. Have you tried starting with the properties as parameters (eg: ./start.sh --server-name=blah), these of course won't persist but we can see if that works,\n. That is an issue with my plugin Tap to Do, it's probably because you ran the central command via the console. If this isn't the case please comment on the Tap to Do thread on the PocketMine forums.\n. I get the same issue, the installer is compiling it into a .phar\n. Rename it to PocketMine-MP.phar\n. Yeah, I am using scheduleAsyncTask().\n. I will test it on my end.\n. When this is executed I can't connect to the server and commands won't work properly:\nphp\nnamespace ExampleThread;\nuse pocketmine\\scheduler\\AsyncTask;\nclass ExampleTask extends AsyncTask{\n    public function onRun(){\n        $t = strtotime(\"now\");\n        while (strtotime(\"now\")-$t <= 20) {\n        }\n    }\n}\nI am scheduling it with:\nphp\n$this->getServer()->getScheduler()->scheduleAsyncTask(new ExampleTask());\n. They are different. \n. I will get to fixing that.\n. Are you sure you couldn't just send a data packet and then just wait for the ACK to come back?\n. Phar is like a zip or tar archive except with multiple compression modes, a signature and a manifest. http://php.net/manual/en/phar.fileformat.php\n. You can use a PluginInterface to load .php plugins. I wrote something that seems to work somewhat (https://github.com/Falkirks/SnippetLoader).\n. As of Alpha 1.4 only .phar files are supported by default. Older plugins will need to be updated.\n. But it won't be working correctly as it is currently comparing an ID to the object. When it should be comparing ID to ID.\n. But you were trying to setBlock an ID and not a Block object.\n. @williamtdr should this be consistent with https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/blob/master/src/pocketmine/level/Level.php#L889\n. Shouldn't you combine these commits with a rebase? That is usually preferred.\n. @PEMapModder I am pretty sure it's too late now. You can run git rebase on a repository and flatten many commits into one, most organizations like if you do this in pull requests.\n. It works fine for me, what error do you get?\n. I created a crash report for you on the Crash Archive. http://crash.pocketmine.net/view/20952\n. No. I see no reason why we need to change our community standard. Making a change like this will provide an unneeded annoyance for contributors and plugin developers. The change will fail to propagate through all PocketMine related projects which will make our once unified coding standard which we enjoyed using a mess of old and new code. Tabs are also friendlier to work with as you can change the indent width to suit your needs and they are harder to make formatting errors with. It does increase the file size though which is always lovely :)\n. @PEMapModder I would like to point out that the PocketMine code syntax is used by many plugin developers and while it is not enforced the plugin submission rules state:\n\nPlugins must be coded with proper syntax and formatting.\n. @PEMapModder That rule is ambiguous but it likely is pointing the accepted syntax for the PocketMine project. Regardless of this, I have seen many plugins using the PocketMine style to the extent that this change would cause a disruption amongst plugin developers.\n. No. When I download PocketMine-MP, I am downloading the binary for that version, I am not downloading every future release. I want to be assured a single version and not attacked by an auto-updater that modifies the software which I have chosen to use. I also think it is just a general waste of resources.\n. @shoghicp \nIt reduces the amount of invalid reports we get from older builds, since some people forget to update them.\n\nI think the current update notification system is annoying enough so users won't \"forget\" to update. No need to add further complication.\n. @shoghicp I see no reason to expose such issues when the current system works fine. \n. @LukeDarling PocketMine would have to implement it, it doesn't matter what the client does.\n. Are you registering the listener properly?\n. Why isn't it getOperators() the name of the the field is operators?\n. Your PHP build (specifically pthreads) is too new, can't help you beyond that as the version is no longer supported.\n. http://crash.pocketmine.net/view/291089\n. Yes. The way things are now might be confusing but it is correct. The builds of Alpha 1.4 are beta builds of an alpha version. However, users have already been using shortened version names due to the long time using the \"Alpha\" prefix. I think it would make support easier and reduce user confusion to shorten the version string, although it would remove possibly useful information.\n. On Yosemite I got a date related error (wasn't the same one though) when I included -r with it removed it appears to work fine. I reproduced the exact error  on my Raspberry Pi yesterday, I switched from wget to curl and it seemed to work, I got an error with the gpg stuff though.\n. > When a falling sand meet water, it becomes an item(It should stay in the water as a real sand not an item\n. Awkward :disappointed: \n. I got this error too, don't think it was caused by the high place thing though.\n. http://crash.pocketmine.net/view/955376\n. http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ocelot it's confusing\n. I can't reproduce this. \n. http://translate.pocketmine.net/\n. \"Center\" is US and \"Centre\" is outside US. I have only seen \"Center\" used in programming.\n. @FatalDeath also when you remove the new lines it would be optimal if you squash the commits, that way there isn't a commit on master that is just removing line breaks :smile: \n. @ns827 Doesn't the windows shell close out?\n. @PEMapModder If RakLib is blocking legitmate packets, this is a bug.\n. This is not a support forum and this is not a bug. The config file for mcg76_BasicPerms is invalid.\n. :+1: \n. There is also a round method in Vector3.\n. :+1: \n. What is the problem? Closures aren't strings but they are callable.\n.  When will this be fixed? It's very annoying.\n. This is a plugin related issue and doesn't belong in this issue tracker. Please read the contributing guide before creating issues.\n. :-1: Please see http://wiki.bukkit.org/CraftBukkit_Commands. This is backwards incompatible change which isn't compliant with the default Minecraft behaviour.\n. @RagnarokkGaming The issue tracker is a list of bugs. This list is entirely redundant and doesn't make anyones' life easier. I appreciate what your trying to do, but the PocketMine development process is fairly optimized and you shouldn't go around messing with what we do here. There is a CONTRIBUTING.md document which outlines how to report bugs, please follow this document.\n. Also if you want to debug use the debug method builtin to PocketMine, not echo.\n. These branches have internal dependencies, there is no clear merging order. They would need to be rebased onto one branch before merging. But even if that happened, it wouldn't be merged because it is untested garbage that you have thrown together from code which belongs to @ImagicalCorp. These modifications to PocketMine by @ImagicalCorp violate the LGPL (see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html#SEC3 2-b) on the PocketMine project, so I doubt anyone is going to merge them into this project. As @PEMapModder said, you are being spammy and on behalf the 861 people who got notifications from these PRs, I ask you to stop it.\n. @samalero See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/691476/are-singleline-if-statements-or-if-statements-without-braces-bad-practice. When working with large projects which are maintained and consumed by many people, it is usually better to include braces.\n. Reactions are much preferred to users creating comments, with things like :+1: or other emojis. It reduces clutter and clearly indicates what users are supporting.\n. See #4093. I have a weak objection to this PR, as the .github folder is a GitHub feature and CONTRIBUTING.md is used across many services (not just GitHub) in the root directory, however we do use GitHub and the document talks mainly about GitHub.\n. Why isn't a block update needed?\n. Wow, weird that there is five here.\n. @matcracker a Flower is a single flower that occupies a single block.\n@PEMapModder Wool could be plural, so who knows.\n. Looks like __toString, but isn't magical, so a bit of a misnomer.\n\nPHP reserves all function names starting with  as magical. It is recommended that you do not use function names with  in PHP unless you want some documented magic functionality.\n. \n",

You can pickup if you go beside where the dropped item came from.\"\n. Is there perhaps a server process already running? Or perhaps the server-ip or server-port field in server.properties has an invalid entry?\nYou could try not specifying an IP or a different port, in server.properties, and see if that will allow the server to start.\n. I would have to agree with MineMobileCrafter in that there is a connection problem between the machine you are using to play the game and your router.\nI have definitely seen this behaviour before and it was when the WiFi (local) network was in higher demand than normal.\nAlso, network speed does not equate to network stability.

    "d-chord": "It's definitely because the server isn't correctly updating the y-coordinate (elevation) for the dropped upper blocks for the tree.  I added some debugging statements in the server code to track this down but I haven't figure out a fix yet.  A workaround that worked for me is to do the following:\n- Cut down the tree, letting all the blocks drop.\n- You will pickup the bottom three blocks.\n- Stack up dirt (or cobblestone, whatever) where the trunk was -- I stand there, look down and jump while placing the dirt directly below.  After you get high enough into the tree, you will pick up the blocks even though they were displayed on the ground.\nI'm running this version:\n21:40:53 [INFO] This server is running PocketMine-MP version Alpha_1.4dev \"\u7d76\u597d(Zekkou)\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad(Cake)\" (MCPE: v0.8.1 alpha) (API 13)\nI don't think this is lag related because I'm playing on my own LAN with one user.  I'm going to keep debugging to see if I can figure out a way to solve this.  BTW, it also happens to me when digging straight down.  I will end up with a pile of blocks floating at the bottom.

You forgot the | bash at the end of the CURL. \n. Something is running on port 19132. Perhaps another server?\n. I personally think this feature would be a good improvement. For example, the vanilla MCPC server logs to the file latest.log. When it becomes a new day, that log is compressed and renamed to log-[date].log.gz and a new latest.log is created. This would improve the endless time of searching through this 5 MB large log file for one particular line that you knew happened on a particular day.\n.

I'll grab the dev version this weekend and give it a shot.\n. If you're asking me why I couldn't \"just get it now\", as in right after Shoghi asked, well that'd be because I have a more than full time job as Associate Director of an application development department of a mid-sized company, I'm a single dad with two kids who have very full schedules, and on Wednesday nights I go drinking and playing board games with friends to get the heck away from the glow of an LCD screen for a while.  So, the only time I can really delve into this stuff to do meaningful testing, tweaking, and/or provide feedback on the same is on the weekends... and then only maybe.  If you mean right now, this moment, on Friday night, then re-read what I just wrote and translate that into the level of exhaustion I feel at the end of a very full week, and consider that rather than doing a poor job and wasting this dev team's time with potentially inaccurate feedback, I'd prefer to just give it a shot tomorrow or Sunday when I can give it appropriate time and energy.  Does that explain, or did I misinterpret your question? :)\n. Tried to install and test the dev version, but I can't get past a YAML error.

Wondering if putting in a PR for these would be good.\n. Looking at PocketMine-MP / src / material / item / [tool|generic] /   I don't see them. Am I missing something?    \nSpecifically ChestShop attempts to grab the name of an item based on ID and it appears to be depending on those classes in material to get the name of an item.  Is ChestShop addressing the names wrong possibly? Can I get the name of item 279 for example with the current source? \nLooking further it appears that you can get the ID by name (constants) but I'm not seeing a way to reliably get name from ID.\n. I'm not specifically looking to subclass although that would be cool. The only case I am looking for is the ability to get the name of an item from the ID which I think the only way would be via the classes ATM.\n.

    "dossjb": "I first noticed this while using a plugin.  I messaged the plugin creator about it and they told me they use the /give server command.  It makes sense to fix it here though and not in plugins that use it.  As for MCPC, I do believe that it spawns the item at the players location for pickup also.  It is not just an animation thing because if your inventory is full it will stay their until you make a spot in your inventory for it.\n. Another issue fixing this would resolve is like items will stack better.  The way it is now if you have 15 wool in an inventory slot and are given five more, you now have two separate slots used in your inventory with wool.  If an item was to spawn at your location the normal pickup subroutine would be used to stack like items.\n. Awesome! Thanks for the update.\n. @PEMapModder  Alright that's fine, is there an alternative to adding items into the inventory?  Maybe better stacking or a broadcast message saying the target player has a full inventory?\n.

Hello, adding something to this report... who knows, it might help :)\nIn trying to do some \"world rescue\" I today found the option that I could use simpleworlds to export my world and then import into MCEdit. I hoped that either the simpleworlds export or the MCEdit import would get rid of the error that apperantly is present in my map.\nSo I made a new installation of pocketmine and made sure the simpleworlds plugin was loaded. I then copied my broken world into a folder called w2 and started up the server. (the complete log is copied below so you can exactly see what I did)\nSince I never worked with simpleworlds I had to find the right commands but I finaly managed to load the w2 world and export it. I then desided to load the normal world again. No idea why I actualy did that since this instance was only created to export the corrupted world but I did...\nand then I had the \"line 89\" error again.....\nTo me that appears a little strange. I had just loaded the normal world again (this was created on starting up the server so completely default) In the log you can see that the error appears 33 seconds after loading the clean world. I would not have been suprised if the error would happen while unloading w2 for instance...\nAfter this happened I selected all text in the log and pressed CTRL-C wich ofcourse closed my server window so I can not start from there again (I did not use stop so it will very likely be corrupted again).\nNo idea if this is of any help, just reporting it since I found it a little strange.\nAs for the results, the export with simpleworlds created a 20MB file (about 10 times bigger than the pocketmine world). I then import into MCEdit where MCEdit did not report any errors but unfortynatly, there does not appear to be anything that can be saved in that world so it appears that trick did not work for me so far.\ngreetings\n------------- server output --------------\n11:53:33 [INFO] Starting Minecraft PE server version v0.8.1 alpha\n11:53:33 [INFO] Loading properties...\n11:53:33 [INFO] Starting Minecraft PE server on *:19135\n11:53:33 [INFO] This server is running PocketMine-MP version Alpha_1.3.12 \"??(Amai)??????(Beetroot)\" (MCPE: v0.8.1 alpha) (API 12)\n11:53:33 [INFO] PocketMine-MP is distributed under the LGPL License\n11:53:33 [INFO] Preparing level \"world\"\n11:53:33 [INFO] Loading plugin \"SimpleWorlds\" 0.3.1 by PocketMine Team\n11:53:33 [INFO] Starting GS4 status listener\n11:53:33 [INFO] Setting query port to 19135\n11:53:33 [INFO] Query running on 0.0.0.0:19135\n11:53:33 [INFO] Default game type: CREATIVE\n11:53:33 [INFO] Starting plugins...\n11:53:33 [SimpleWorlds] Loading levels...\n11:53:33 [INFO] Done (3.187s)!

But i still have the issue. I can't explain the loop, and i suppose there is a bug in the core. But ok, let's search an explanation on the forum thread, and go back here if you have no explanation too.\n. I notice this issue too.\n. Yes for me it's fixed but i have another issue. I have one death message, and i really die each time i leave the game (for no reason) :(\n. It happens only in certain situation. More often the afk kick is sent by the server after a few seconds but in this case the afk kick is never sent. I have to send a manual kick from the console to kick the player. Do i need to create a plugin to kick the player automatically if he does'nt move during 1 minute ?\n. yes but until the Raklib bug is fixed, i could be a solution to add an afk plugin, to clean those dead connections ?\n. yeah i'm sure too, i don't know if a packet is sent to the client when the api cancel the PlayerPreLoginEvent or when the player is kicked by pocketmine (i think a packet is sent), but this packet is probably ignored by the client during the \"loading / generating world\" process. So the client is still waiting for \"world packet\" to build the world while the server won't send anythink more to this client. Client stay waiting.\nI think it's a client bug because the client may not be stuck as this.\nBut pehaps the server can send another packet which can be properly evaluated by the client and cause a client connexion reset or abord the world g\u00e9n\u00e9ration ?\n. The bug is happening frequetly when using simpleauth.\nAfter a crash of the client, the server take a while to kick the player.\nThe player try to join again, SimpleAuth kick him in the PlayerPreLoginEvent because this plauyer is seen \"already online\"\nAnd client client is stuck \"Generating World / Locating Server\"\n. I suggest 2 fixes =>\n1) Kick player at server side faster (clean \"zombie connexions\" => is it possible to poll or ping the clients every 10 seconds for example (200 ticks), and if no reply, kick the player.\n2) Send the right packet to break the \"generation world or locating server\" process clientside => However, don't know if that packet exists.\nI can't even try to do that fixes myself because i don\"t know enought about the pocketmine core code... pehaps one day^^\n. 1: in the protocol, is there any packet that is intended to cause a response by the client ? Also, is the client supposed to send packet regularly to the player to tell him he is still alive ?\nI just see that Shoghi add a fix relative to that in the last build. I don't know if that cover this issue.\n. Xp is no more supported by microsoft :(\nA lot of software doesnt work anymore on this OS. You should update the OS ;-)\n. command timings gives me : 13:20:10 [INFO] Unknown command.

Did you notice that the server get stuck when thoses functions were called ?\n. @shoghicp none of my plugins delete files while the server is running :/\n. @xxFlare same for me\n@iJoshuaHD i've tried all binaries, bug is still there\n. @shoghicp told me today it can be a php binary issue.\nI've recomplied php for 5.6.5 (last php build) on debian.\nMy server is running, i'm waiting...\nShoghicp, told me to test 5.6.1 too because, this issue can comes from a bug in the last php build... if someone can test... \n. @wrewolf  goto https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/issues/2532\n. Is it like this : #2532\n. I^have the same issue, 10 times per day, every days since a while :/\n. @YourturnGaming Add AlwaysSpawn Plugin to your server. That will reset player spawn position at respawn. And the bug won't happened again.\n. I've remove a $player->setGamemode(0) just before the kick into my plugin and the bug disapered.\n(The server is creative mode wich is not coherent)\n. This fix tries to fix the same issue (worlds are probably not properly saved at server stop). I've called the quit() method of the thread class. Kill method doesnt exist anymore. I don't move the microSleep because I don't really know why it's there ? Or if it's better outside the loop.\n. ",

Now that the 1.4 update is released, are you trying to find a way to use informations from anvil format to send an equivalent to MCPE client ?\n. There is a strange thing happen since v1.5 is that grass is black on Anvil and other imported MCRegion worlds !\n. I'll try it !\n. Yes, unfortunately it happened on build #919 too :/ !\n. No there is only .mcr files in region folder and I've testing it many times and I always get the same problem :/\nPlease reopen this issue !\n. @shoghicp I've found the origin of the problem: for my PocketMine servers I've renamed all my folders with an \"[Pocket]\" indication before the server name (example: \"[Pocket] My server1\") and a [PC] indication for bukkit servers...\nSo it seems that when the server folder name contains \"[\" \"]\" characters the server creates automatically some .mca files into the region folder even if files into this folder are in MCRegion format !\nDid you know why PocketMine do this ??\n. Use grass color pattern to calibrate biomes's color:\nhttp://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/minecraft.gamepedia.com/8/87/Grasscolor.png\n. Yep ! Confirmed on #1\u200b23\u200b8 build !\n.

    "dutok": "It seems like this occurs client-side but not server-side AT ALL. I don't think the server even acknowledges this extreme movement. PocketMine shoots me back to my original spot when I disconnect and reconnect.\n. Make sure you renamed it to PocketMine-MP.phar? Also, please be more specific and maybe give us the exact error.\n. This is obviously your host's fault and we can do nothing.\n. @PEMapModder ??? We can't provide support for hosting, because it is their fault. I thought that was clear. I mean 'we' as people who have enough knowledge to help.\n. It does actually stop the server but the CLI stays open.\n. Do you have any plugins installed?\n. I get a death loop when I move around too much. I think this is MCPE not Pocketmine.\n. Yeah, I think this is just a MCPE glitch. It will hopefully be fixed in 0.9 final release.\n. That example doesn't really prove it to be Pocketmine's fault. I have experienced the glitch on every alpha build.\n. Yes, it does - this isn't a support channel.\n. It helps you solve lag and usage issues. http://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/timings/\nVery useful!\n. Pocketmine 1.4 doesn't support mobs or spawners yet. Also, this isn't instantmcpe.\n. Are you on the latest build?\n. Why did you reference that issue?\n. 0.9.3 fixes this issue and it's only available for Android. iOS and other providers should be getting it soon.\n. What build are you using?\n. This didn't happen to me using 0.9.0 alpha and 1.4 dev because I was using -many- chests and many server restarts, so maybe this broke during beta or in a recent version of MCPE.\n. Why did you close it?\n. My plugin has a double disable message in this screenshot, haha. I didn't realize that before it was released, but oh well.\nI think the onDisable function should be used for alerting the user to closing database connections and maybe if information isn't saved yet.\nAnyways, on topic - does this have anything to do with the memory issue?\n. Why would you need to go 1.5 million blocks out?\n. Stop making pointless pull requests..\n. From Spigot 1.7.10:\n\n. And, I think, Shogi tries to keep the messages as close to Bukkit as possible.\n. Yeah, this happens to me too. Most of the time I have to kill the process to get it to stop because it freezes on unloading world. \n. You need to use a recent PocketMine build since your current build is too old to accept 0.9.5 clients.\n. http://jenkins.pocketmine.net/job/PocketMine-MP/lastStableBuild/ has the latest stable PocketMine build, which would support MCPE v0.9.5. \nLike @PEMapModder said, this isn't a place to receive support. You can find help on the PocketMine Forums.\n. Just start them on different ports or get multiple IP addresses (I'm not sure if that's possible on Windows). Different ports is probably your best option.\nBut... This isn't a support forum. This is where you report bugs with PocketMine. You can receive more help and less hostility here: http://forums.pocketmine.net/\n. This patch fixes RCON?\n.

Thank you very much, @milo1000 :)\n. PocketMine won't and can't fix bugs right when you need them. They are volunteers, not your slaves. Complaining about it won't speed up the process. \n. @ProjectInfinity Yep. I'm not even voting on this because I have no idea how it would affect anything.\n. Yes, I think it would be an awesome feature to have auto-updating and very useful to server owners, but... It needs to be disabled by default. Most people would hate seeing their plugins break when the server decides to automatically update itself.\nAlso, I think this should be very low priority - there are things more necessary than this.\n. @sekjun9878 Auto-updating is a feature usually handled by the software itself rather than 3rd party plugins. Maybe we should draw the line after the auto-updating! \n. ",

Also the mob spawning eggs do not work (and I know in previous versions of pocketmine couldn't move the animals) but the new and old animals/mobs do not spawn at all.\n. Also you can't craft armour, you can only craft helmets (I only tested diamond)\n. This problem is slightly annoying but funny XD it took me a little bit of time to work out how to stop falling out of the world. But it's strange every time it's by the spawn point\n. @PEMapModder sorry what are dups?\n. @shoghicp hi, I am pretty sure I am using beta build #277 but it might be the development build #287. How can I check which version it is? And I also can't connect to my server anymore on my iPad now I've just updated the game to version 0.9.2\n. @ZizzyZizzy I don't think the server is able to do this yet, but I could b wrong, I know the 0.8.1 worlds use a different generation method that 0.9.0\n. I have that problem, but if you delete the world, and then restart the server and wait about 2 mins then join then this does not happen\n. @iksaku i don't this this is a problem anymore, but the double chests now turn into 2 single chests\n\n. Chests are still vanishing, but I think it's only single chests, when I tap the screen the chests stay invisible, if I hold down on the chest (to break it) it does break but does not go back into my inventory\n\n. Most of the time I have to kill the process too, as when I type stop the server freezes, and if I travel too far on the map, the server uses up too much ram then quits, even when I've allocated it 2GB of RAM, and don't travel too far, it eats up all the RAM\n. @santiboub I have same problem on dev 399 - I know pocketmine does not work on android, so it could be something with the compatibility with ARM processors maybe? (Model B) (I used my iPad also). The server says username logged in... But the minecraft app jus freezes\n. @raporpe sorry, it's dev 395\n. ",

It took me about 30 minutes of re-generating world after world until one was generated with a correct spawn point that did not cause players to fall through the world.\nI noted in another issue that if you wait for a few minutes after starting a fresh server, you have a better chance of spawning correctly. This may be related to the \"world being generated in the background\" message shown in the console.\nI also noticed some inconsistency with the regions that were generated. Here are the regions for one world that did not work correctly when spawning:\nr.0.0.mca  r.0.-1.mca  r.-1.0.mca  r.-1.-1.mca  r.3.3.mca\nThis is what was generated for one that worked correctly:\nr.0.0.mca  r.0.-1.mca  r.-1.0.mca  r.-1.-1.mca  r.3.2.mca  r.3.3.mca  r.4.4.mca\nWalking around the world normally will reveal unrendered chunks with invisible edges in square shapes (chunk borders), with no obvious rhyme or reason as to their placement.\n.

I believe it happens when you have other directories than /bin, /players, /plugins, /world in you server directory?\n. I believe it's because of minecraft pe's inventory is not fully on server side yet?\n. Well, maybe it was because of php on windows was 5.6.2 not 5.6.3, with last it seems to load chunks faster, but if someone is flying very fast towards unloaded chunks TPS still falls low, but it goes back to normal fast.(Actually found another issue with chat while doing this).\n. @shoghicp , Vladik46 is swearing on russian...\n. @shoghicp It's not caused by a plugin, it happens even without plugins...\n.

    "jhedlund": "The fix for #1842 seems to have solved this as well, though the player does now appear to be slightly hovering over the ground, but at least no longer spawning inside blocks (or in the case of a flat world, I was spawning into the ground and then falling out of the world every time)\n. This is probably the same as issue #1787 \n. ",
    "alejandroliu": "So is this now available with v1.5. \n. Is this issue still open?  The latest update should have fixed some of these.\n. Does this still happen with 1.4.1?\n. The issue is that Server.php in line 1,143, it is creating a new $generator instance which is then used to call the selected LevelProvider::generate in line 1,156.  The signature for LevelProvider::generate is:\n* Generate the needed files in the path given\n *\n * @param string  $path\n * @param string  $name\n * @param int     $seed\n * @param string  $generator\n * @param array[] $options\n */\npublic static function generate($path, $name, $seed, $generator, array $options = []);\nSo $generator shouldn't be a class instance but a string.  Indeed McRegion::generate does:\n\"generatorName\" => new String(\"generatorName\", Generator::getGeneratorName($generator))\nWhich uses Generator::getGeneratorName which takes a string containing a full class name.\n. Sorry for not following the contribution Guidelines.\nI will try to be more descriptive the next time.  If you are referring to the \"PR: Bug Fix\" label not being applied, I don't seem to have access to that.\nFollowing this article the referred to options are not available to me.\n. I believe this fixes #2741.   The pictures show very elaborate builds which most likely spill to multiple sectors.\n. Please label PR:BugFix\n. To recreate this issue:\n- Create a flat world.\n- Place stuff at Chunk 0,0 (teleport to 8, 64, 8).\n- Re-start server.\n- The stuff at Chunk 0,0 is gone.\n. This can be closed, as the fix in \"Clone initial chunk in Flat.php #2788\" has been merged.\n. Yes, using \"empty chunk\" would be the right solution.\nLet me take another go at it...\n. OK, second try.\nI added code to delay the generation of the template chunk by parsePreset until we actually need to generate a block.\nThe idea is that when generateBlock is called, $chunkX and $chunkZ should always point to an empty Chunk.  We then parse presets and generate the template block from this $chunkX,$chunkZ (instead of the chunk at 0,0).  Then we start cloning this chunk as needed.\nThe side effect is that the Generator start-up time is quicker.  And we only generate the template block when we need to start generating blocks.  So, for large worlds where a large part of the playing area is already generated, then you may never need to create the template block.\n. I added a \"clone\" so that the ownership of the chunk template is always the Flat generator.\nI though that the situation that you describe doesn't happen because while parsePreset would read a new chunk from the level provider, and it is returned to generateChunk, generateChunk would then \"clone\" that chunk and return that to the level provider (thus replacing the original read chunk by parsePreset).\nEssentially, this is doing what the \"unpatched\" Flat generator was doing but instead of hard coding the initial chunk to (0,0) it is getting that chunk from generateChunk.\n. This should be fixed in the current dev versions.\n. Is this for Normal or for Flat worlds?\n. I have tested this.  The error happens on 1.4.1 but not on the current dev version.  It has to do with the proportional armor patch that was applied to 1.4.1 but was then reverted in dev.\nIt has to do with adding armor components to the damage modifier event and then the getFinalDamage function expecting Int's instead of PlayerInventory objects.\n. Do you have spawn protection?  And does it happen in the spawn area?\nDoes it happen only to stone blocks?\n. Hi,\nAdded the suggestions by PEMapModder.  Also, tested with some lambda's and these also work.  I can use \"function ($args) use ($something) ... \" as the callable and works and keeps the right variables.  I am not sure how I could test it on a different thread, but my guess is that using lambda's for a callaback on a different thread will not work.\nI also tested creating a couple of stack traces to see how it would look like.  In my opinion stack-traces still work, but I am enclosing a couple of example for your review:\nTrace 1 - Closure\n2015-04-28 08:14:01 [CRITICAL] Could not execute task pocketmine\\scheduler\\PluginCallbackTask: Undefined variable: z\n2015-04-28 08:14:01 [NOTICE] UndefinedVariableException: \"Undefined variable: z\" (E_NOTICE) in \"/home/alex/PocketMine-MP/plugins/pocketmine-plugins/GrabBag/src/aliuly/grabbag/CmdAfterAt\" at line 79\n2015-04-28 08:14:01 [DEBUG] #0 /home/alex/PocketMine-MP/src/PocketMine-MP_v1.5/src/pocketmine/scheduler/PluginCallbackTask(61): aliuly\\grabbag\\CmdAfterAt->aliuly\\grabbag\\{closure}(integer 1, pocketmine\\scheduler\\PluginCallbackTask object, integer 118)\n2015-04-28 08:14:01 [DEBUG] #1 /home/alex/PocketMine-MP/src/PocketMine-MP_v1.5/src/pocketmine/scheduler/TaskHandler(150): pocketmine\\scheduler\\PluginCallbackTask->onRun(integer 118)\n2015-04-28 08:14:01 [DEBUG] #2 /home/alex/PocketMine-MP/src/PocketMine-MP_v1.5/src/pocketmine/scheduler/ServerScheduler(247): pocketmine\\scheduler\\TaskHandler->run(integer 118)\n2015-04-28 08:14:01 [DEBUG] #3 /home/alex/PocketMine-MP/src/PocketMine-MP_v1.5/src/pocketmine/Server(2392): pocketmine\\scheduler\\ServerScheduler->mainThreadHeartbeat(integer 118)\n2015-04-28 08:14:01 [DEBUG] #4 /home/alex/PocketMine-MP/src/PocketMine-MP_v1.5/src/pocketmine/Server(2188): pocketmine\\Server->tick()\n2015-04-28 08:14:01 [DEBUG] #5 /home/alex/PocketMine-MP/src/PocketMine-MP_v1.5/src/pocketmine/Server(2070): pocketmine\\Server->tickProcessor()\n2015-04-28 08:14:01 [DEBUG] #6 /home/alex/PocketMine-MP/src/PocketMine-MP_v1.5/src/pocketmine/Server(1748): pocketmine\\Server->start()\n2015-04-28 08:14:01 [DEBUG] #7 /home/alex/PocketMine-MP/src/PocketMine-MP_v1.5/src/pocketmine/PocketMine(462): pocketmine\\Server->__construct(pocketmine\\CompatibleClassLoader object, pocketmine\\utils\\MainLogger object, string /home/alex/PocketMine-MP/PocketMine-MP_v1.5/, string /home/alex/PocketMine-MP/PocketMine-MP_v1.5/, string /home/alex/PocketMine-MP/PocketMine-MP_v1.5/plugins/)\nTrace 2 - Member function\n2015-04-28 08:05:20 [CRITICAL] Could not execute task pocketmine\\scheduler\\PluginCallbackTask: Undefined variable: x\n2015-04-28 08:05:20 [NOTICE] UndefinedVariableException: \"Undefined variable: x\" (E_NOTICE) in \"/home/alex/PocketMine-MP/plugins/pocketmine-plugins/GrabBag/src/aliuly/grabbag/CmdAfterAt\" at line 61\n2015-04-28 08:05:20 [DEBUG] #0 /home/alex/PocketMine-MP/src/PocketMine-MP_v1.5/src/pocketmine/scheduler/PluginCallbackTask(61): aliuly\\grabbag\\CmdAfterAt->runCommand(string say one, pocketmine\\scheduler\\PluginCallbackTask object, integer 139)\n2015-04-28 08:05:20 [DEBUG] #1 /home/alex/PocketMine-MP/src/PocketMine-MP_v1.5/src/pocketmine/scheduler/TaskHandler(150): pocketmine\\scheduler\\PluginCallbackTask->onRun(integer 139)\n2015-04-28 08:05:20 [DEBUG] #2 /home/alex/PocketMine-MP/src/PocketMine-MP_v1.5/src/pocketmine/scheduler/ServerScheduler(247): pocketmine\\scheduler\\TaskHandler->run(integer 139)\n2015-04-28 08:05:20 [DEBUG] #3 /home/alex/PocketMine-MP/src/PocketMine-MP_v1.5/src/pocketmine/Server(2392): pocketmine\\scheduler\\ServerScheduler->mainThreadHeartbeat(integer 139)\n2015-04-28 08:05:20 [DEBUG] #4 /home/alex/PocketMine-MP/src/PocketMine-MP_v1.5/src/pocketmine/Server(2188): pocketmine\\Server->tick()\n2015-04-28 08:05:20 [DEBUG] #5 /home/alex/PocketMine-MP/src/PocketMine-MP_v1.5/src/pocketmine/Server(2070): pocketmine\\Server->tickProcessor()\n2015-04-28 08:05:20 [DEBUG] #6 /home/alex/PocketMine-MP/src/PocketMine-MP_v1.5/src/pocketmine/Server(1748): pocketmine\\Server->start()\n2015-04-28 08:05:20 [DEBUG] #7 /home/alex/PocketMine-MP/src/PocketMine-MP_v1.5/src/pocketmine/PocketMine(462): pocketmine\\Server->__construct(pocketmine\\CompatibleClassLoader object, pocketmine\\utils\\MainLogger object, string /home/alex/PocketMine-MP/PocketMine-MP_v1.5/, string /home/alex/PocketMine-MP/PocketMine-MP_v1.5/, string /home/alex/PocketMine-MP/PocketMine-MP_v1.5/plugins/)\n2015-04-28 08:07:01 [INFO] Scheduled for Tue, 28 Apr 2015 08:07:02 +0100\n. If you are talking about the:\n$this->args[] = $this\nThat is to be compatible with the current CallbackTask functionality.   Adding the ticks was suggested by @PEMapModder .\n. I tend to agree, I frequently use CallbackTask and never seen the need to access the CallbackTask object itself.  I was just trying to keep the semantics the same.\nShould that be removed then, but keep the ticks counter?\n. I did a rebase, so it is just one commit now.\n. So, can it be merged?  I think I am not the only developer who would use this class.\n. Done\n. Mcpe 0.11\nUsing the latest git commit.\nSeeing that it was summarily closed I assume is a client issue. \n. So does that mean that you won't be merging this?\n. @shoghicp, So in the meantime, can you merge this?\nThe other option to the @PEMapModder suggestion would be that the PluginLoader provides a factory to create the appropriate xxxFileInfo object.  So the PharLoader would return PharFileObject, the Folder loader would return SplFileInfo.  Any other loaders can return whatever is necessary.  The PHP snipped loader shouldn't throw and error as it wouldn't make sense for it.\n. I think just implementing the proposing getResourceContents from this PullRequest would take care of most use cases by most plugin developers.\n. Actually for me the properties do not seem to be working.  All my settings in pocketmine.yml seem to be ignored.\nSeems to be an issue with the propertyCache in Server::getProperty it retrieves values from the property member field but it should be using config.\nIn that sense the Server part of the API around property and config is a bit confusing.  getProperty retrieves from config whereas getConfig retrieves from properties.\nThe problem is right here Server.php\n. OK, but I am doing it as a different pull-request... that would be less commits (and easier for me than doing a rebase).\n. @shoghicp , is there anything else you need before this Pull Request can be merged?\n. Will take a look at unloadChunk.\nFrom what examining the code, $oldLevel()->getTiles() only sends the tiles that are loaded in memory.  Since chunks are dynamically loaded/unloaded, it should only send active tiles (which shouldn't be that many).\n. Oh, yes, the unloadChunk bit is much better... I will be updating this pull request.\n@shoghicp, as usual you are right.\n. Created a new PR #3197 .  This one is a single commit.\n. OK, now it is in a single commit. \n. Ugh... Normally I use emacs (yes, I am an old guy), and today was trying Atom.\nLet me test the spawnable stuff...\n. This is a duplicate to #2842 \n. While scripts are only intended to be fast ways to interact with the core and experiment, sometimes is useful to control the order of plugins through depend and softdepend.\n. BTW, this patch is not trying to handle all cases (i.e commands and permissions).  It simply addresses the plugin metadata elements that are just lists (no keys) and usually are simply casted to array.\nNormally in plugin.yml these fields are entered as:\nkey: [ value,values]\n. Also, if we wanted to handle keys, I think I can re-implement it so that tags are extracted and converted to YAML and then the YAML parser is called.   But I do think that would be over the top.\n. As \"special cases\" go, this one targets the special cases already being defined in \"PluginDescription\".  Anyway, perhaps, the \"special case handling\" should be moved to PluginDescription (if you prefer).\nEither way, I included two additional Pull request that are more generic.   One only implements arrays, and the other one implements array and key support.  You obviously only need to pick one from these three pull requests.\n. Yes, that probably would be much better.\n. Same happens to me... When the player dies with setHealth, they can not respawn.  Actually, the player is dead on the client, but the server still shows the player as alive.  If then use /kill to kill the player, they are able to respawn.\nI am not sure if this is a client or a server bug.\n. What is your evidence that it is a server side bug?\n. When you do this, can you confirm that the player is in the right location?\nI am experiencing a glitch when you teleport a player to a near by location, the position on the server gets updated, but the position on the client is not.  So then if you try to hit the player, the client sends the wrong position to the server, so then the attack fails.\n. Checks failed because they use PHP5 whereas this branch is supposed to use PHP7\n. It is enough to check that it is a non-zero value.\n. Yes, didn't know what to name the function.  Can anybody suggest a better name?\nIt is meant to make sure that arrays are arrays (or that strings are converted to arrays).\n. ",

Will converting to Anvil help?\n. worlds are corrupted by earlier version of pm, still not fixed. How can I fix it manually?\nWhen I load empty map on newest builds all looks normal (grass blocks are green) but when I load corrupted - all blocks are black.\n. 1256\nThis happened when no more free space left on server partition.. as a result world chunks and player.dat are partially saved. When player join the game and try to move this error occured\n. Really? May be need to add check of all file  saving ability or file is corrupted before loading or saving it globally? Or just add exception for preventing crashes. Does plugins save files by using PM functions?\n. I confirm this thing!\nI suppose this happens when we using Backspace button to erase string and write again.\n. I do not use any launcher - clean client 0.11.1\n. > > This issue is caused by plugins assuming the player is still online while the player is already offline\n\n\nCan You add exception for this event? So people will know whatthe plugin  exactly makes server error. and exception may prevent server crash.\n. Yes, of course. I using many plugins on my servers. and this error happens only on one of servers. I think this is happens when player logging in, there is setting force-gamemode=off in server.properties and some plugin changes player inventory while he is in creative mode.\nbut not sure\n. This is most truth able answer.\n...This maybe a bug when a player left your server, causing it to think the player is still on the server...\n. But in this case, where is PlayerQuitEvent  ?\n. Thank You!\n. I think the problem is server crashes. No need any changes but need handle exception to prevent crash. That`s it. Most of all this is plugins problems. And the target is show this error not crash whole server.\n. build PR 346\n. Try to explane it to children. they are using tp only as they want :) Build 1263. Pm1.5dev.

We have to change our indentation!\". Download a trial of PhpStorm, and take a look at this: http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/webhelp/changing-indentation.html\nChanging indentation can be done within a couple of minutes.\n. @PEMapModder You don't need more than the trial to convert the indentation. Then you can continue like normal, just ensure that you use spaces over tabs. As for your other reasons, they're bogus.\nFor your 1st objection, it just doesn't make ANY significant difference in a project of PocketMine's size.\nYour 2nd objection, CTRL+LEFT/RIGHT does pretty much what you are talking about in MOST IDEs. I even tested NotePad++ and it does it.\nFor your 3rd, so what? Developers have to adapt all the time anyway, and using tabs is bad practice. Might as well kill bad habits before they're imprinted into your mind.\n. I'm baffled at all the uninformed comments regarding tabs here. Is there that many people here not using a IDE, or taking the time to see if their chosen editor works like expected using spaces instead of tabs? \nThere are no significant advantages to using tabs. It's not easier or cleaner. \n. @iksaku hit me up with why you think tabs are better then. \n. There ought to be a selected group of individuals that @shoghicp trusts can provide useful, informed and relevant opinions on this matter as opposed to opening it up and advertising it to everyone and their mother whom may not have the proper experience in understanding what this actually means.\n. Yes. \nHowever the truth is that automatic updating is something a power user will turn off, and this feature is very much geared towards newbies. \nBy having it disabled by default you will end up just like things are today. Newbies will not enter the configuration to change the property and power users will just turn it off immediately (if on).\n. @shoghicp It's hard to say. As a power user I hate auto-updates, but as a developer I love it and unfortunately we're going to see this feature unused if not on by default. So if I have to choose, I suppose I would say enabled as default.\n. Yes for reasons you have already mentioned.\n. ",

Found out this crash only happens when a player logs off the server in one of these newly generated chunks.\n. Nope,  on PC\n. Caused by plugin, no longer got this error once I removed it.\n. I'm having the same issue, but only with double chests. I don't seem to have a problem with just a single chest.\n. I've been having this issue from 855 to the most recent builds\n. I'm using PocketMine-MP, I'll check if reverting to an older version helps.\n. I may be having the same problem with my server. However, I think it is caused by the high CPU usage whenever a player joins or attempts to join the server.\nAnd by \"I can't move\", do you mean that your player gets hung up and keeps on glitching on the previous block?\n. The worlds were all fully generated with Pocketmine.\n. I believe that your problem exists in your server configuration file considering it's saying your IP address on boot is this..\n[Server] 00:15:41 [INFO] Starting Minecraft PE server on 0.0.0.0:19132\nAnd therefor, causes this..\n[Server] 00:15:47 [ERROR] RuntimeException: \"RakLib Thread crashed [raklib\\server\\UDPServerSocket]: socket_bind(): unable to bind address [98]: Address in use\" (E_ERROR) in \"/src/raklib/server/UDPServerSocket\" at line 32\nIts saying the address is in use as 0.0.0.0 isn't your server IP. I would try looking in your config file for any IP with that and removing it from the config file.\n. The damage from snowballs I'm talking about is when a player through one and it hits another players. \n. I'm using async auto so all cores (so 4 cores). The Linux percentages I was mentioning were from an overall statistic (so all 4 combined). I've also tried setting it specific to one core but the problem still occurrs.\n. Correction: By setting it to a specific core, I'm mentioning changing the async in PocketMine*\n. The 22% accounts for the stats of all 4 cores. So meaning each one is only using roughly 6%. \n. Sorry if my English isn't great, typing on mobile is not fun. Also, thanks for the info on async. \n. I see what you mean now. There is one core that has a higher percentage compared to the rest. Still odd on how low the cpu usage is compared to the older builds(via Linux \"top\"). Just found it odd how little it was allocating for the server. \n. Is there anything I can do to give to help you get information on this? \n. I can provide logs, reports, give you access to the server, ect if requested. :) \n. I'll get back to you shortly with the reports. \n. Hi there! Sorry I didn't get back to you, was swamped.\nI did a few timings reports it's a bit hard to catch when the CPU is allocating weird.\nhttp://timings.aikar.co/?url=11566662 <<< This one seems to have higher CPU usages.\nhttp://timings.aikar.co/?url=11566682 \nhttp://timings.aikar.co/?url=11566708\nhttp://timings.aikar.co/?url=11566711\nI noticed that one of the plugins had a high CPU usage also. But I believe that only contributes some of the high CPU usage.\nHope this helps! If you need more/different reports, I will be happy to provide.\n. Seems to allocate CPU a lot better with the newer updates and a semi tweaked pocketmine.yml  \nIt still seems to be allocating a low amount for when players join the server. It seems to affect it majorly when multiple users join with-in a short amount of time. The lag/cpu allocation issue is only affected when players log onto the server successfully, haven't had a problem with cpu when players join and get kicked (white-list, full server, ect).\n. So I'm assuming that world size has a factor with that. They are running on SSDs. However overall, seems like Pocketmine is allocating CPU more efficiently in the newer builds. :D Thanks! \n. Tested this on a few of my servers, was not able to craft a wooden door. \nI would confirm this also. \n. If you are unable to reproduce locally, I can provide server logs.\n. I shall attach a log! :D One sec\n. Didn't see the new comments xD My bad.. Thanks!\n. @shoghicp Having the same issue with underscores :(\nOn the latest build :)\n.

Just because it is implemented within the app, doesn't mean it is implemented in PocketMine. :)\nRemember that. \n. No. It simply is a idea to see if PocketMine will or will not implement it. \nYou see, some people think, doing that is cheating, which I can sort of agree. So, Its up to the Pull Requesters and PocketMine staff to decide.\n. I guess you could say that. But I am no representative of PocketMine, I am just making my own point.\n. I have a way to temporary fix this issue (It may also work for Third Party Versions of PocketMine too.)\nAll you need to do, is delete ALL player date from the /players directory/folder. \nIf anyone wants to confirm this, you are welcome to\n. Hmm. Im connected via xbox live, and that works for me. The thing that triggered the server to work for me was deleting player data. :/ \n.

A new level.dat file was created, but sadly the issue was not resolved. I even tried copying the level.dat file from my new working version, but the same things happens. I looked at the properties of the new level.dat file and noticed that the modified date is today, 23Jun16 but the created date is 13Jun16, if that helps and maybe confuses.\n. In the back on my mind, I thought it may be a type of block confilct issue. The nice thing would be to work out what the block type or types are, just in case I can remove them from the world in case it won't be fixed in 15.1. That's if it is a feasible thing to try and do.\n. That's sad to hear. v0.15.1 hasn't been released in Australia yet. I'm sot sure who develops Pocketmine-MP or how to get them to hear about this issue, assuming they don't know about it. I wonder if Shoghicp knows about it all assuming he still works for Mojang.\n. Hi Driesboy, would you mind giving me a bit more detail. As much as you can please.\n. Driesboy, obviously to me you are a guru at all this. I am just a dad who has set up a server since around 2013 and have tried to keep it all working. (apart from the v0.8.1 to v0.9.0 issue) You mentioned to use \"world edit and remove it\", and \"clear lagg to remove the unknown mobs or entities\". Here's what I assume and I hope you can correct me as well as help me please. I use PHP7.\n1) \"World Edit\" is a plugin. If that is right, can you send me a link. I guess I have to reload V0.14.3 to use it. If that is correct, what am I looking to remove, what commands to use or is there a one off command to remove all blocks/entities to make the world eventually work.\n2) \"Clear Lagg\" is a plugin and all the same questions as per above.\nIf this is all too hard to try and explain, let me know as well. I'd love to help my kids and their friends out, but if I can't, then that's life. Feel free to download the world that is attached in this thread to see if you can see my issues. Again, only do that if you are bored and would like to give it a go for me/. \n. Hi everyone. I basically gave up as I could see no light at the end of any tunnel. But, while I have been patiently looking for the latest .PHAR file (protocol 82) for V0.15.6 off the Bintray web site, which is not there as it's latest is still for protocol 81. I did yet another global search and came across the link  (https://forums.pocketmine.net/threads/version-issues.18015/) . In this link, go and get the .PHAR file from (https://www.dropbox.com/s/tbq12l954xm27z8/PocketMine-MP 0.15.6 or 0.15.4.phar?dl=0) . This .PHAR file works for V0.15.6, protocol 82. It also seems to solve my issue and have loaded my original world with all my kids and their friends buildings etc. and it does not crash. Please, those of you who had and still have the same issue, give it a try and let us all know.\n. Hi RocoWayne, as I mentioned in my last comment, I found a .PHAR file made by iTX Technology LLC that now works for me and doesn't have any of the issues I was having when I opened up this forum link. It even works with V0.15.7. We use iOS devices and our sever is on a Win10 PC. Go to the links I've previously mentioned to download the .PHAR file. or, when I run the server, it says to get the latest source code from https://github.com/iTXTech/Genisys . It's a solution for us.\n. ",

The error above says that something is already bound to that port on your server.

You can try to find the process and kill it. start by typing (assuming you are on linux):\n\nnetstat -pant|grep \":19132\"\nThat will show you the process that is listening on that port.

After testing further, it looks like the jack-o-lantern is changing back to a pumpkin. I am trying to tell if it is changing when I place it in the action bar, or when I place it.\nEDIT I tested some more and it appears that as soon as I craft them they change back to pumpkins. If I am in the crafting table, it shows the resources are used up, but if I close out and back I can craft the pumpkins back into jack-o-lanterns again. I tested with /give and I can give myself jack-o-lanterns and have confirmed that when done this way they do emit light.\nI am going to test on another client and see if the issue is actually with crafting pumpkins on the server or if it is my client.\n. I just re-tested on a different device (tablet vs my phone). I was able to duplicate it for the third time.\nPlant a row of saplings 1 block away from each other, then do the same thing one row over:\n|X_X_X_X_X_X_X|\n|- - - - - - - - - - - - -|\n|X_X_X_X_X_X_X|\nX=sapling, - = empty dirt.\nRun through it but not in a completely straight line (not sure why this matters, just makes it happen more often). I kinda zig-zag through so that I am going from one row to another. I start taking damage.\nWhile I was typing this I had my 2 daughters try it and both of them took damage just by running through it at an angle. \nThe server has been restarted twice this I first noticed this and we are in a completely different area than when I first noticed it. Also it is on a large flat plain with no other blocks that could cause this such as stairs or half-blocks.\nWhen I first noticed this, Shoghi stated that this was a known issue that he had resolved in the latest dev, but I am running on 954 (the latest dev that is available on the site at the moment) and it is still occurring. He asked for this issue to be opened so he could look into it again.\n. Verified this with any half blocks.\n. Verified.\n. I have duplicated this many times on 956. This should only be allowed with blocks that you can walk through, such as fences, torches, saplings, crops, etc. Instead, it works with any blocks, such as stone, which can cause you to take damage or even die.\nYou can place blocks both at your foot level and your head level.\n. This is not a support forum. It is an issue tracker, which if you had read, you would know that double chests are bugged.\n. I was not able to place torches on the sides or the top of them (like I can with a fence). I thought this was by design, but now that I think about it, it should be allowed as it is with wood fences. \n. ",

    "Kanonen": "Seeing this in build 1257. When the stone pickaxe gets to zero durability, it seems to instantly respawn in my inventory. Often, it will also 'appear' twice in the inventory - not a true duplicate, but two inventory UI slots that link to the same item.\nI can then use the resurrected took for another break or two, and then it does it again.\nWouldn't have to do with some issue where the durability value is going below zero, and wrapping around or being rounded up or something, would it?\n. Think I found the bug. StonePickaxe.php is setting the item to iron tier, so the max durability is wrong. So the client side sees the item as reaching max durability, but the server does not.\nhttp://jenkins.pocketmine.net/job/PocketMine-MP-doc/doxygen/d2/dbc/_stone_pickaxe_8php_source.html\nEdit: Looks like this was fixed in this commit: https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/commit/a88da88b9b18750aa2e593af059fb0969fb9088c\n. Confirmed that this is fixed in the newest development build (1258)\n. Running build 1257. This issues doesn't seem to just be unique to any kind of tool or target. Have experienced it with stone shovel and sand, stone axe and leaves, stone shovel and dirt, iron shovel and sand, wooden/stone pickaxe and stone.\nNote: Just tested iron shovel vs. stone shovel on dirt and sand: \n- Iron shovel almost always needed two \"breaks\" to break sand and dirt\n  - Stone shovel was actually much better, only rarely needing two breaks\n. @PEMapModder I see there is a setInstaBreak() for BlockBreakEvent - is that the function you had in mind? i called that w/'true' on BlockBreakEvent and, in my preliminary testing with the tools/targets that were most problematic, the \"multiple breaks\" issue is no longer occurring. \nDoes that help? \n. I am also experiencing this in build 1257. It's as if the server is out of sync with what the client - the client sees the block as placed, but the server doesn't register the block being placed until after the client's \"jump\" animation is complete.\n. FYI, my debug statements are saying that the wooden pickaxe is \"air\". Here's the debug for selecting the wooden pickaxe:\nItem: Air | IsPickaxe Value:\ncompared to when i selected the stone pickaxe (note the incorrect isPickaxe value, also a bug)\nItem: Stone Pickaxe | IsPickaxe Value: 4\n. I just crafted another, and this time the debug statement is correct, and I AM able to mine stone. It looks like the bug might be at the point the wooden pickaxe is crafted.\nItem: Wooden Pickaxe | IsPickaxe Value: 1\n. ",

Actually, I think it was my fault because I accidentally didnt close the one ran when my raspi starts up so it crashed. Now that I restarted it works fine and I can join it from 0.14.1 MCPE.\n. @Subtleoliver I used water because in survival, you have to refill the bucket each time and water gives you 64 blocks to use.\n. Here is a phar http://pmt.mcpe.me/pmb/dl/pr:4115.phar Its from a closed pull request but it works. They denied the pull request because they said it didnt make all the changes for 0.14.1 BUT ATLEAST IT ALLOWED IT TO BE SUPPORTED.\n. Just realised that is old link. You have to compile it yourself. https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/pull/4115 is the pull request. Ill upload a phar when I get a chance.\n. @skywalker-z Here it is: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0wvRQEqnhujN1k4eTBBbFhHWmc/view?usp=sharing Be sure to rename it to PocketMine-MP.phar before usingit.\nAlso the water bucket is missing in creative in it.\n. When I figure out how to compile PocketMine from the source into a phar I will put together a bunch of pullrequests and and make a phar with all the features I can fix in it. Ive found fix for the creative water bucket and for some other issues, and made them into one resp, but dont know how to compile a phar,.\n. Hm, ive not used windows but it may be an issue because it has \"/\" in the phar instead of . Though I dont think so since its supposed to be the same phar no mater which system. Do you have PHP7 installed or PHP5?\nUpdate: I looked it up and it may have to do with uploading it to google drive because it seems some sites mess up phars when theyre uploaded (The signature) and the signature seems to be the issue if it syas it cant verify.\n. @skywalker-z I can try to email it to you if you would like. Its a exact copy of the PHAR my raspi is running.\n. I got it from this link on a pull request. The request was closed because there were \"more changes\" than what was in it, but working mostly is better than not working at all. Im not sure why it is smaller. I wish I knew how to generate the phars, but I dont sadly. Also, almost all the phars are different sizes and stuff. It just depends on what the compiler decided to put in them, like different new blocks and stuff. Could be a number of things, but make a COMPLETE copy of your pocketmine folder before ever changing anything like a phar.\nhttps://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/pull/4115\nhttp://pmt.mcpe.me/pmb/dl/pr:4115.phar\nJust saw you said it didnt work on attatchment, hmm. Ill try to recompile it if i can find a guide on how to make a phar.\n. Thats cool. IDK you could run it without a phar. And I doubt it will be official any time soon sadly. \n. @TheEpicCooldeal Just wonderin ,can I just replace the pocketmine phar with genisys phar and it will work?\n. @robeske110 thanks, ill try it now\n. @robske110, Thanks so much, this is great. @skywalker-z you should try genisys phar also. It has mobs and evrerything, even redstone!\n. Yeah, when pocket mine works Illstop looking for a working alternative, until then, nah\ud83d\ude0c\n. Thanks a lot! Also, do you know how to compile pocketmine into a phar. I wanted to make a phar with several pull requests in it because without many of them its not very functional. @PrimusLV \n. Do /plugins to see if it is even loaded\n. ",

This is certainly a death trap when the HELL generator is used (spawning in a lava lake is definitely not okay!). This has long since been fixed on PMMP's PocketMine-MP. (Hardness bug, it also existed with several other blocks including netherrack.). I believe this is due to the lack of distinction between still and flowing liquids.

It is weird to get item drops when I am the only one on and am in creative mode. However, that is just a weird, random, event I noticed and may or may not have anything to do codewise with this issue.\n. It appears that other small 5 megabyte worlds can cause the crashes too. It just takes longer to develop the problem, but once developed, it happens every time the world is loaded. That is apparent in some of the worlds located in my public world folder located at https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7pkAMl3n7uhQjFXMHRTeGxDMjQ&usp=sharing\n. No, I could only access them from my computer as I had it as a single server setup. I am sorry that I don't remember much, it has been so long since I have played pocket edition as I now use Spigot and play PC edition.\n. I have had issues with random plugins doing that to me such as MineReset and EssentialsPE. Deleting the config of the problem plugins can help when the server is reloaded.\nTo figure out the problem plugin(s), using process of elimination can help find it in which I would stick 10 plugins in at a time and  reload the server to see if it still works or breaks. Since it could be more than one, keep trying until all groups have been added then chunk the groups to smaller bits. It's just what I sometimes have to do. Hope it helps you.\n. Yes, I mean if your problem is truly caused by a plugin, it could be caused by the plugin's config. It doesn't happen instantly, but it can randomly break. When I viewed the problem plugin's config when I had the problem under Notepad++, it looked the same as a functional plugin, but one worked and one didn't. So it could be something with hexadecimal values such as an accidental enter key from the plugin or a missing tab or something weird and random like that. My solution is really only a quick fix, but it can be used by someone who has the time to investigate to actually solve the problem with this bug.\n. ",

Also, in my oppinion it should be saved into a variable. public $hotbarSize = 9||6;\n. hmm.. But still. Maybe thats the problems that slots that DONT EVEN EXIST in the GUI are selected. Cant find a picture right now..\n. That is now what i mean. You know the selection box around the item you currently use? Somethimes this box gliched out and selects a slot that doesn't exist right to the the three dots where you open the inventory.\nhttps://forums.pocketmine.net/attachments/image-jpg.9255/\nthey can be 1 up to 3 offset\n. In 0.11 its 6.\n. I think it always happens if you change gamemode and then select any block that was in your survival inventory before.\n. Hasnt this been fixed for ages?\n. Lol.. due to BlockUpdate when broken\n.

It called getLevelByName which in turn calls getLevels.  Everything worked fine until approximately the 3xx builds when SimplePortals started crashing the server.\nSomeone called JamJam raised an issue at https://github.com/Falkirks/SimplePortals/issues/5.  I've done some digging and added more detail.  It looks like SimplePortals fails because it can't build the portal store, because it can't get the level information.\nSimplePortals has been static since November but obviously IM is in flux.\nI think bigsmile is right, there's something up with getLevels.

Thank you Thomas for the confirmation. I might have found the contributor to memory exhaustion. I used GrabBag's \"entities\" command and discovered several hundred entities, especially mobs, squid, and villagers. After running \"/entities nuke all\" the memory appears to be remaining much lower. I wonder if you or others can confirm the same. If so, we can have the PocketMine team look into these entities that may be leaking memory. I'm sure if its not fixed in 1.5 that it will be problematic in 1.6. PM 1.4 was much more stable; hopefully we can help the PM team get a stable 1.6.\n. Thank you Thomas. I wonder if the MPCE 0.12 branch is for PM 1.6? But you're right. I don't see a PM 1.5, although it really won't matter once MPCE 0.12 is out. My users will upgrade their clients and then be unable to play on PM 1.5 due to incompatibility. It will force the upgrade to PM 1.6. Let's see!\n. ",

Oh, just realized that it has been fixed in the latest development version...\n. Well, on my computer a single PHP file compiles around 3-4MB on my computer. The Windows Task Manager says that PHP is using 91708K of memory at first, and when 189 classes were loaded, PHP says 'segmentation fault' which is probably due to memory limit exceeded. That's 432580K for 189 classes, and each class takes around 2288K of memory. I don't know why 'All of the PM code compiled to opcodes is around 1.6MB on my 64-bit system.'.\nThe point of the issue is that relying too much on autoloader can cause unknown issues which WILL happen at some time. This should be the exact cause when server owners find their servers 'leaking memory' and 'memory usage does not reduce even when no player is online'. Although autoloader optimizes the speed, we should make sure that our server works without an autoloader.\n. I tested it on both Windows 64-bit and Windows 32-bit VM. Both of them exceeds the memory limit quickly.\nAuto loader does not unload classes, so eventually all classes that may possibly be used will be loaded.\nMy PHP binary is the version included in the official stable version.\n. @sekjun9878\nYeah it does not have to be a memory full error, but it is true that it takes a lot of memory while loading :)\nHere is the code: (Sorry I'm too lazy to put it into a new Git repo):\n/src/Bugfix/Bugfix.php\n``` php\n    namespace Bugfix;\nuse pocketmine\\plugin\\PluginBase;\nuse pocketmine\\event\\Listener;\n\nclass Bugfix extends PluginBase implements Listener{\n    public function onEnable(){\n        $this->getServer()->getScheduler()->scheduleAsyncTask(new AsyncLoader($this));\n    }\n}\n\n```\n/src/Buggix/AsyncLoader.php\n``` php\n    namespace Bugfix;\nclass AsyncLoader extends \\pocketmine\\scheduler\\AsyncTask{\n    private $owner;\n    public function __construct($owner){\n        $this->owner = $owner;\n    }\n    public function onRun(){\n        $filePath = str_replace(\"\\\\\", \"/\", \\pocketmine\\PATH);\n        $classes = [];\n        $this->owner->getServer()->getLogger()->info(\"Finding\");\n        foreach(new \\RecursiveIteratorIterator(new \\RecursiveDirectoryIterator($filePath)) as $file){\n            $path = ltrim(str_replace([\"\\\\\", $filePath], [\"/\", \"\"], $file), \"/\");\n            if($path{0} === \".\" or strpos($path, \"/.\") !== false){\n                continue;\n            }\n            if(substr($path, 0, 4) === \"src/\" and substr($path, strlen($path) - 4, 4) === \".php\"){\n                $classname = substr(str_replace(\"/\", \"\\\\\", $path), 4, strlen($path) - 8);\n                if(substr($classname, strlen($classname) - 7, 7) !== \"__32bit\" and substr($classname, strlen($classname) - 7, 7) !== \"__64bit\")\n                    if(!class_exists($classname, false)){\n                        $classes[$classname] = $file;\n                    }\n            }\n        }\n        $this->owner->getServer()->getLogger()->info(\"Loading\");\n        $loaded = 0;\n        foreach($classes as $classname => $file){\n            //$this->owner->getServer()->getLogger()->info(\"[$loaded] Loading \" . $classname . \" from $file: testing\");\n            if(!class_exists($classname, false)){\n                $loaded++;\n                $this->owner->getServer()->getLogger()->info(\"[$loaded] Loading \" . $classname . \" from $file\");\n                //require_once($file);\n                class_exists($classname, true);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\nAnd delete any PHP files that makes an error. The memory usage increased very quickly on my VM and my host machine..\nForgot the exact build number, but I downloaded the latest development version yesterday, and the plugin seems to work across versions.\n. @shoghicp\nYeah I excluded all non-PHP files.\nphp\n                if(substr($path, 0, 4) === \"src/\" and substr($path, strlen($path) - 4, 4) === \".php\"){\n                    $classname = substr(str_replace(\"/\", \"\\\\\", $path), 4, strlen($path) - 8);\n                    if(substr($classname, strlen($classname) - 7, 7) !== \"__32bit\" and substr($classname, strlen($classname) - 7, 7) !== \"__64bit\")\n                        if(!class_exists($classname, false)){\n                            $classes[$classname] = $file;\n                        }\n                }\nI tried to run it on the main thread but PHP died even faster (after loading 35 classes). I tried deleting the last class it loaded, but it will only load 35 classes, not one single more. The AsyncLoader one loaded 190 classes, but not one single more. The main thread one died so fast that I cannot see the memory usage. No exceptions, no warnings, no debug messages, just segmentation fault.\n. ",

Well...I dont know much but Plugin is an interface and it doesn't have a static method getLogger. It is a syntax error, i think :D\n. you should ask for help in pocketmine forum but not here.PocketMine 1.6 is still not stable,you should understand or just not use it.\n. Ok. But that might cause error.\n. according to the interface, it returns an int not an array :/\n. But this is a part of API I think, and can reach this error.\n. @PEMapModder Yea. You're right.\n. One should read the crash dump before open an issue.\n. read the log plz\n. i said read the log plz not give me the log plz \n. Obviously, the port is already in use.\nSo you should find out which process is using the port and close it.Then it should be able to open the server. Or you can just change the port in server.properties.\n. test again without any plugin, this might happen because some plugin log the string which getLeaveMessage return\n. STOP opening issue about crash, this is not a forum, you can report it in forum, not here.\n. Try delete all 32bit and 64bit php files.\n. Unpack the phar and delete files and pack it again or just run unpackaged software.\n. @PEMapModder :)\n. XD\n. Never. But this class must implement this method. It doesnt crash just because it is not used yet.\n. :+1: \n. @PEMapModder so in short, i wonder if this PR fixes the crash currently without other issues?\n. ",

This is a issue tracker....... facepalm\n. http://forums.pocketmine.net/forums\nHERE is the forums. Now, again this is an issue tracker with PM.\n. I think he is. This maybe a bug when a player left your server, causing it to think the player is still on the server. Not your fault :)\n. Check the src? Or did you test it?\n. Read the error.\ntxt\nAddress already in use\nMeans that there is another server on your PC with the same port. Stop every PM instance and then launch a new one.\n. :Type stop command --\n. Also, getTiles on a world returns null if a player did not join the world.\n. It is null... Sorry, IRC does work for me ATM.\n. Ok. And @xpyctum, that property is _protected\n. I did?\n. :+1: \n. I researched a bit, seems like the LightPopulated tag does not exist. How do I fix that?!\n. You don't. It just happens, I believe. Probably when player throws a snowball, but with code, not the real snowball.\n. Please add speed attributes\n. Yesss... So only walk exhaustion left?\n. Walking exhaustion needs to be added :P\n. Yes, but mine stops after about a minute.\n. What a mistake... Glad someone noticed it soon enough.\n. XD Plugins can add em.\n. Oh, ok. I just though in the future, you could just add more functions like getRestoredSaturation. But I saw your commits. It seems to include that, so thanks :)\n. @NoBakaCookies4U Why do they call it Plug Pocketmine? It has nothing to do with pocketmine. IT'S an APP\n. @KairusDarkSeeker What @jojoe77777 said is true. They _HEAVILY _ modified it.\n. I believe this happened because shog tried replacing all NBT tags from Double to DoubleTag, but he forgot to revert this.\n. Yah. I actually made a program so it actually fixes all of that.\n. Don't use plug pocketmine.\n. WTF...\n. I got a solution for you. Go to school and learn how to READ. \n\n. ",

Ok, I see where you are going semantically. I'll try to write a plugin that gives users a \"command\" to use this \"feature\" without crashing PM.\n\nThat said, and without wishing to irk you further, as a developer myself I consider any command that can be passed parameters by end users to systematically crashes a system a \"bug\".\n.

Check the ops.txt file permissions?\n. I'm having the same problem. I run 10 MCPE servers using Multicraft - everything works fine on 7 of the servers I updated to use PHP7 PM builds, but 3 of them will not allow any connections (despite starting and seemingly running correctly), however the same servers when configured to use PHP5 work perfectly.\nI'm running CentOS7 CLI on a dedicated server, and have tried reconfiguring and disabling firewalld to no avail. If I change the port of a broken server to that of a working server everything runs perfectly... so I've been trying to figure out how the switch to use PHP7 causes connections on these ports to fail. I've run netstat etc to see if anything is interfering, but everything looks identical whether they are running PHP5 or PHP7.\nThe only pattern I can see is that those that don't work are the three highest ports:\nPorts that allow connections on PHP5 and PHP7: 19132, 19133, 17171, 20000, 25252, 11111, 12321, 23456\nPorts working with PHP5 but not working with PHP7: 33333, 55555, 41414\n. I've been testing that, and it doesn't fix the problem\n. If this was closed because I was running it in Multicraft... the same error happens on a clean PM install\n[myuser@myserver PM]# ./start.sh\n[16:32:01] [Server thread/INFO]: Loading pocketmine.yml...\nFatal error: Can't use method return value in write context in phar:///home/minecraft/PM/PocketMine-MP.phar/src/pocketmine/utils/Config.php on line 332\n. Ok... To reproduce download the latest .phar from http://pmt.mcpe.me/pmb/... install, run, crash.\nThe bug in in config.php, IMHO\n. Fair enough, I'll try source now. Thanks\n. Indeed, it seems that most of the similar chunk loading problems were fixed when support was added for the REQUEST_CHUNK_RADIUS_PACKET, so maybe someone missed something related to teleport()?\n. I'm on the latest build and it's been running for 1 day and 17 hours, still running fine, and still taking console commands. Sure you don't have a plugin that's causing a problem?\n. I checked that, some players thought it was lagging less, but I don't think it helped.\nUPDATE: deleting worlds on local servers fixed the problem, but I didn't have this issue on remote servers. I don't have the join/disconnect problem with the official update, only leashes, and weak client updates which are indeed already fixed on the main PM fork/spoon.\n.

Thank you, SkygridRex, that looks like good advice! I'm gonna play around with the config (pocketmine.yml) first, like this:\nGlobal soft memory limit in megabytes. Set to 0 to disable\nThis will trigger low-memory-triggers and fire an event to free memory when the usage goes over this global-limit: 1\nMain thread soft memory limit in megabytes. Set to 0 to disable\nThis will trigger low-memory-triggers and fire an event to free memory when the usage goes over this main-limit: 1\nMain thread hard memory limit in megabytes. Set to 0 to disable\nThis will stop the server when the limit is surpassed\nmain-hard-limit: 2048\nMaybe this will get the memory management shoghicp implemeted to work and prevent the Server from chrashing...? Otherwise I'll use the ASR Plugin.\nThanks again!\n. Thanks a lot! My memory settings were ridiculously low, since I mixed up MB with GB!\n. Initialy I thougt all settings were in GB, so I wrote:\nglobal-limit: 1\nfor instance, believing this meant 1 GB...\nBut for this case it should have been\nglobal-limit: 1024\nDon't worry, I changed the configuration now very similar to the configuration example you gave. And the server is still up and running after 12+ hours!\n:-)\nThanks again!\n. Mezzo Mezzo. Server is available through the Internet (VServer), but only used by me and a couple of kids. Therefore no heavy traffic and only a handful logins each day...\nThanks, again for your help, Diego, but I think I can get along at the moment.\nAnd me and the kids just can't wait to get MCPE 0.12 into our hands...\n;-)\n. It looks to me as if the configuration mechanism described above is sort of a workaround to deal with some kind of memory issue (in the version history one sees that they did a lot about memory management in MCPE V1.5). Even though the workaround works for me my concern is that the server might accidently set free some memory which is actually in use and, hence, corrupt the world. Therefore I followed the advice to install the ASR plugin and restart the server like every 2 hours to prevent any crashes!\n. No problems so far...I think it depends on the configuration. My impression is, that the memory leak eats up apprx 150 MB per hour. So if you are running the server with only 256 MB allocated memory you should restart every hour...\n. Hi Scott,\nI don't think that the memory problem with Version 1.5 has been solved for real, but since there are workarounds to deal with the situation (see thread above, esp. regarding usage of ASR Plugin) and developers are already working on 1.6 I closed this issue.\nRegards\nThomas\n. That is valuable new Information, Scott. I could reopen the ticket to ensure the team gets informed. Problem is, that I wouldn't find time to give them any Feedback, if needed. Would you take care of this ticket then and answer any questions? Otherwise you could open a new issue with the newly found Information!\n\nAm 24.08.2015 um 05:31 schrieb Scott notifications@github.com:\nThank you Thomas for the confirmation. I might have found the contributor to memory exhaustion. I used GrabBag's \"entities\" command and discovered several hundred entities, especially mobs, squid, and villagers. After running \"/entities nuke all\" the memory appears to be remaining much lower. I wonder if you or others can confirm the same. If so, we can have the PocketMine team look into these entities that may be leaking memory. I'm sure if its not fixed in 1.5 that it will be problematic in 1.6. PM 1.4 was much more stable; hopefully we can help the PM team get a stable 1.6.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. I did a little research at GitHub and twitter (@pocketmine) and I wonder, if anyone in the team would be interested in fixing the V1.5 issues at all. In the GitHubs' pocketmine repository there doesn't seem to be any V1.5 branch anymore (which is probably the cause for not having a stable V1.5 version, yet). And already on 07/14/2015 it got announced at twitter \"@PocketMine: PocketMine 1.6 will support Windows 10, Android, iOS and Windows Phone players on the same server! Also in the future Java players as well\". Sounds to me, that MCPE 1.6 won't have a common code base with V1.5, but will be a completly new piece of software...hence reopening this issue is probably helpless!\n. Interesting! Do you know if it's possible to convert an existing MCRegion world into the anvil format with MCPE? Regards\n. Thank you very much for your support, @SkygridRex and @mattbisme. Both of you have a point: If the memory leak depends on the data format used this is important information for the community esp. since many users most likely treasure their \"old worlds\" (like me and my son). And arguing that the issue is a big topic in the forums without offering the slightest hint where and what to look for doesn't meet the users needs. Nevertheless @legoboy0215 hint that this is a basically a bug tracking tool, not a forum, is kind of right, too. \n\nI'm sorry if I caused any anger with my comments and if so I apology. Maybe we can meet everybodys needs by \nA) providing a link to some related Information in the forums in order to complete this issue\nB) opening another issue in order to track @mattbisme observations?\nRegards\nThomas \n. Looks exactly like the crash I reported yesterday (#3370). The Server starts with a relativly low memory consumption (about 30MB), but memory usage increases till all allocated memory is gone (in my case it was 1024 MB).\nI'm running on Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS\n. ",
    "mattbisme": "I still seem to run into this issue daily. I have tried the suggestions in this ticket, but they only seem to prolong an inevitable crash. Memory never seems to clear itself at all, even after everyone has logged out of the server. \n. The ASR plugin advises against setting the timer anything beyond one hour. Have you found it to be an issue?\n. I recognize that with 1.6 on the way, this issue may or may not be relevant anymore, but in case that it is: I recently switched the my server over to Anvil worlds only. It has been running great since I abandoned the old MCRegion worlds. \nNow, these new worlds do not have as many of the entities that @mcprostar205 mentioned, but I thought it worth mentioning. Memory usage is extremely low for me now. I no longer need to run ASR!\n. While I recognize that a question like that could cause a ticket to spiral off-topic, I do think @ThomasMatthis is asking something helpful. A map converter would be quite useful when determining whether or not the map format is related to the memory leak. \nThat said, I have invested many hours in trying to convert existing MCRegion worlds to Anvil worlds. Nothing I have found (even Mojang's own tool) has been helpful. I even asked about it in Pocketmine IRC channel where user @Intyre mentioned he might try to create a conversion tool (after his surprise that the Mojang took did not work). In the end, I used the WorldEdit plugin to copy over parts at a time. \nIf performance is format related, then conversion of an existing, problematic, MCRegion map would be very helpful. \n. ",

This will only be a \"problem\" if it is not a forced cache clear.\n. It is not random. I changed the extend from Solid to the Redstone class. The same functions are already in the Redstone class.\n. I don't agree with your point of view. What I did is called Object Oriented Programming. If OOP had been used in the first place it would not have led to this bug. It is only unintuitive if you are not familiar with OOP. I will make a new pull request to only fix the hardness so this bug is fixed, but please let shoghicp review this pull request because I think he will understand. He has made some many good OOP decisions.\n. I don't know the work of PEMapModder or if he understands OOP nor do I want to say someone is stupid. I'm a software engineer for 8 years now and even I haven't grasped all the aspects of OOP. It is not easy to do it right. You need to be able to think abstract at a high level. Even I fail at this many times. I just want to contribute not set any bad blood. I have the best intentions and apologize if I have offended anyone. \n. I agree that at first that seems the logical thing to do, but if you compare the RestoneOre.php with the GlowingRedstoneOre.php code you see a lot of the code is exactly the same. And that is bad programming practice. Duplicate code means it's bug prone.Some day someone decides to make it harder to mine the redstone and changes the RedstoneOre.php accordingly, but (as happend here) does not know about the GlowingRedstoneOre.php You will have the same problem again. By extending the GlowingRedstoneOre class with the RedstoneOre class you automatically get all the code from the RedstoneOre. You simply only add extra functionality or override the functionality you think is different. As with the OnUpdate function. The hardness has to be the same so you can remove it here. \nThink of it like this. You have a class Person with properties Eyecolor and Haircolor. It also has a function onDanger. If onDanger is called the automatic reaction of the person is to run away which is the function RunAway. Then you decide to implement a Villager class and a Hero class, because they act differently on a dangerous situation. So you create a Villager class and a Hero class that extend the Person class. You get the haircolor and eyecolor for free so don't have to write those again. Then for the Hero class you override the onDanger function, because the hero will fight and not run away. So you create the onDanger function in the hero class that overrides the behaviour of the person class. This time it calls a newly created function Fight. When the fighting does not go well the Hero could eventually call the RunAway fucntion so he will not be killed.\nIf I had not created a Person class but directly the Hero and Villager class I could have forgotten about implementing the haircolor or eyecolor and there would not have been a default behaviour.\nPlease if you need me to explain this even better just ask. I'm happy to try to make this understandable for everyone which is quit a challenge for me (and something I can learn from :) ). I could make a code example if you want me to.\n. @sekjun9878 I love patterns and anti-patterns. I'll look it up. Good to know there are people running this project that actually do know what they are doing.\n@SkygridRex At first I thought too, but I didn't know about the anti-pattern. Have to check it out first.\n. Keep on ranting. :) I have read the fragile base class anti pattern and it's actually quite logical.\n. I thought I did. Now you make me doubt. Do you think not?\n. I checked it again. These are the same values as RedstoneOre.php\n. I also fixed the fact that the RedstoneOre starts out as GlowingRedstoneOre. It will now become GlowingRedstoneOre after hitting it for the first time.\n. Are you using plugins? \n. This might be more than just that. I think it's a multi threaded problem. When the players are queried for some action,  midway another thread calls the close action. This can be prevented by for instance a critical section (semaphore in php), but I don't know the full implications of doing this. It would prevent the error, but it might introduce blocking issues or delaying issues. \n. Looks like this pull request is not purely the EntityRegainHealthEvent fix.\n. @SkygridRex: I think he has a lot on his mind with php7. Just be patient and let him finish it. This code won't run away. :-) \n. I have been thinking about moving the recipes to the class where the result of the recipe is of the type of the class. You can call a function like Stone::getRecipes() which will return all the recipes for Stone. That might be cleaner for the CraftingManger class.\nWhat do you think?\n. It does override the destructor in the base class. \n. Most of these items are because they are new in 0.12 or they are used in not yet implemented features like rail and powered rail (and carts). Quartz and nether fence have been built in with the stone cutter pull request I made. \n. I'm not sure a minecart is an item. Maybe a tile or a block. \n. @PEMapModder: A minecart is also an item in the inventory, but it is more. It is a moving \"chest\". It contains players. So it can not be purely an item as you have done in this case. \n. My bad. I'll look into it tonight. \n. @translateRussian: only Nether brick fence or all fences? \n. @SkygridRex: Sometimes I do extreme changes, but I try to keep them to a minimum...\n. It is fixed in my pull request. It needs to be tested if it works correctly. \n. At first I thought it was a type of fence. But after checking the minecraft wiki I noticed it is a seperate object. I forgot to change that piece of code accordingly.\n. What command is used to kick the user? How can we reproduce this? \n. Did the server crash because this function didn't exist or what? Can you tell us why you made this pull request? Please at a better description. \n. Please don't add things that are not yet implemented. For example the rails and powered rails don't work. There is also no AI for the mobs so these should not be added either. \n. Please try to create one big pull request instead of  multiple that address the same issue. \n. I believe Intyre fixed this in a commit to the 0.12 blocks and items branch. It has more code.\n. This has already been fixed with another pull request. \n. 3560\n. It has already been fixed with another pull request. Who does check the null value. \n. 3451 That's how it should be fixed. \nMy fix was about every time you connect,  the first item on the hotbar is incorrect. It holds the first item in the inventory. \n. Please! I'm begging you. Stop helping... Because it's not working. \n. Can you explain why this solves the problem?\n. Have you tested this? Because it looks to me as if the arrow will never disappear, because the broadcast has been deleted. The clients don't know the arrow has been added to the inventory.\n. @PEMapModder Kill eventually calls despawn which sends updates to the players. So that makes them disappear.\n@HmHmmHm Fixing client crash is fine by me, but I'm just trying to understand if this is the correct way to go. Seems to me that removing this code might have side effects. If not I'm fine with it.\n. @HmHmmHm If I take all the money from your bank account you are not hurt, but try to buy some food with no money. I'm trying to get clear if there are some side effects to deleting this code which has been added not so very long ago. Don't have a revision number right now. It has to do with players having ID 0. Or eid 0.\n. I have checked it. If you leave the first 4 lines and comment out the rest, it doesn't crash. If I comment out all lines and the $this->inventory and $entity->kill line, the arrow does not get picked up. If I enable only the kill line then it gets kicked up. Intyre then joined my server and confirmed that he saw the arrow getting picked up. So removing all the lines as done by this pull request has no side effects as far as I can see.\n. @HmHmmHm It is a metaphor... And if you don't tell me how you tested if there are any side effects how can I know you tested it right? Or tested at all. \nMaking a pull request is not as easy as just fixing the code (I had the same experience the first time I created a pull request). You also have to describe what you fixed/implemented and why. \n. There is a possibility that $t[1] will fail. In the old code it wouldn't. I think you have to check if index 1 exists.\n. @PEMapModder I have overlooked that. It can not go wrong then. :)\n. @SkygridRex If everyone would think like that nothing would improve. Saving some cpu cycles doesn't seem like a lot, but it does in the big picture I think. \n. I think you can make phar files with the dev tools I think. \n. This is a plug-in error not a pocketmine error. Please report it with the plug-in maker. \n. ",

Due to the fact pocketmine is dead. Genisys is more advanced and flexible. Also, 0.15.4 has protocol changes is that new skin pack are added.\n. @Survingo Well, it's a fact for me. Since you said \"Everyone has his side ;)\"\n. Also, pocketmine has missing features such as Mob AI. Many plugins will soon make this to provide player's satisfaction. Not only that, Many servers now switched into many third-party server hosting. LEET too.\n. Yup. I recommend you to use fork for a while. Pocketmine is recruiting new members for while\n. Guys, for any reason. @robske110 is just not advertising. There are other forks in there that are updated in all mcpe versions. @archie426 No, the staffs are not inactive. They left the project. Making PM died. You are right, people can just ask to other persons. But what if they gave you a malicious code injected to the modified PM? You can't trust anyone on the internet. Trust on people who gives true work.\n\nAs you see on the forums, the one staff on PM announce that they are recruiting new people. Which means the old staffs left. Your wrong. Please read before making any reasons.\n@shoghicp promised us he will still work on PM. But as @Intyre said, \"I have no contact with @shoghicp with many months\" So, we don't know when he will come back.\n. @robske10 wow.. your right...

The build failed as it looked like I was trying to delete several things:\nsrc/pocketmine/lang/locale\nsrc/raklib\nsrc/spl\nThe problem was that when I created the clone using the fork, it didn't copy over these other directories since it looks like there is a symbolic link to other projects.  Someone else recommended I use git clone --recursive.  Problem with that is that I need to issue a pull request so I assume (maybe wrongly) that I need my own repo on GitHub.  And with GitHub I don't have command line access to do the git clone --recursive.  I can do that from my mac, but then I can't issue a pull request (at least I don't know how to).  So I did do a clone of the pocketmine branch to my mac, and then copied the files over to the local repo pointing to my github repo, and then committed the files and the build was happy.  But it looks like it thinks I changed some files that I didn't.\nWhat is the overall process for creating a clone of the repo and doing a pull request in such a way that it also has the folders which are sym links to other projects?\n. So I am happy to start over (third time hopefully is the charm)!  But what I don't know how to do is clone the repo with --recursive and then due a pull request.   If I just issue  git clone --recursive https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP from my mac - then how do I issue a pull request from my mac?\nI thought I had to clone the repo to another githib repo.  But when doing that I don't have any command line access, just what the the web interface provides, which appears to be the fork command.  If I can directly clone, and then issue a pull request somehow from my mac to the https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP repo, thats cool with me.  I am just not sure how to do that.\nThanks in advance for your help!\n. Removed.\n.

This PR might address issue #3875 TNT Issues.\n. My bad! I did rush into conclusions.\nNow if you are kind enough to follow on with this issue, I've done my homework.\n\nI've checked all the calls to Item::get() which happen after a getDrops() and the only one using the token ... is in the Explosion::explodeB() method. There's a potential risk here, since the call to Item::get(...$drop) never checks if $drop is a populated unpackable array or at least contains the first argument (valid id). \nIf this is the source of the critical messages, a simple check before the call would solve it:\nif (!empty($drop))\n    $this->level->dropItem($block->add(0.5, 0.5, 0.5), Item::get(...$drop));\nOther methods in the code calling Item::get() will use a different notation, such as in BlockBreakEvent.php line 47:\n```\n        $drops = $player->isSurvival() ? $block->getDrops($item) : [];\n        foreach($drops as $i){\n            $this->blockDrops[] = Item::get($i[0], $i[1], $i[2]); \n```\nAlso, depending on the class, getDrops() is sometimes written to return an array of tuples ($id, $meta, $count), other times it's written to return an array of actual Item objects, such as in the BlockBreakEvent.php above.\nOn the other hand, a call to getDrops() is often followed by a call to dropItem(), which requires an actual Item object as argument. So when getDrops() returns a list ($id, $meta, $count), there's a need to instantiate an Item object using the static method Item::get() before calling dropItem().\nWouldn't it be easier and more fault-proof if all getDrops() in the code always returned an array of actual Item objects to begin with? \n. It's exactly the second issue reported in issue #3875 by @Samueljh1\n. ",

    "extremeheat": "A potential fix would be to keep track of items that are being picked up, and using them to figure out the ingredients used to craft the result.\nI'm not sure if this is exactly a bug with the Windows 10 Edition or just a byproduct of crafting working differently than in PE.\nEdit: To clarify a bit here: the client sends a CONTAINER_SET_SLOT_PACKET update packet whenever it picks an item up. We can take note of what items the client picks up and store them until they're dropped/moved to some other slot/etc. If something is crafted, it's possible to check what items were last being picked up and safely assume that they were used as crafting ingredients.\n. @GlitchPlayer: I can't reproduce this on PocketMine with an Android client, I think you might be talking about a fork. The official PM repo doesn't accept 0.14.1 clients right now either.\n. @TheDeibo I'm aware that Windows 10 Edition clients get these issues.\n\nSince 0.14.1 release, not only Win10 devices are experiencing but android devices too. When you get an dropped item, it immediately drops the equipped items.\n\nIs what I am referring to.\n. @thebigsmileXD Could we not just ignore DropItemPacket if the item being dropped is an air block? \nThe current code seems to just drop whatever item is currently held in the hotbar which doesn't quite work with Windows 10 Edition anyways because you can drop items directly from inventories.\n. Some things worth mentioning on Windows 10 Edition that aren't accounted for currently in PocketMine:\n- Items can be picked up and held for long duration of time, this causes issues with the current transaction-based mechanism for dealing with inventory changes. Example: https://zippy.gfycat.com/TautEminentAnt.webm\n- Items can be dropped straight from the inventory and the crafting slots in individual quantities (@thebigsmileXD's commit fixes this, but does not know for certain what slot is being dropped or the amount)\nNone of these are \"bugs\" with the client (except for the unrelated crafting issue.)\nHere are couple proof-of-concept patches that I made if anyone wants to test them out which fix most of the issues shown in #4079 and #4028 (should be applied consecutively):\nhttps://gist.github.com/extremeheat/f1e9e0b8ca884727e6a3abfc7bfdc5a3\nPhar: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwGlUbiwcjh0R19Jc2R4elNFd00/view\nSome things to note:\n- The server will kick on client <-> server desynchronization primarily to make testing easier (instead of just re-sending the inventory and acting like nothing happened)\n- I haven't looked at creative mode much yet, so some things may not work properly although most things should\n- Spamming dropped items, or picking up items too fast cause the client to become desynchronized\n- Switching hotbar slots too fast can cause desynchronization (already an issue with PocketMine)\nThe desynchronization issues are pretty nasty too, as the client continuously spams the server with packets.\nEdit: forgot to add a file to the crafting commit, fixed and updated the phar.\n. @ianbinder Sure thing, updated the file here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwGlUbiwcjh0R19Jc2R4elNFd00/view\n. @lklarose The kicks are normal if they happen randomly, normally the server would just resend the inventory. If you consistently get kicked then it's probably a bug. The hotbar switching issues are a known issue in PocketMine. I do have a solution to it, however (may make an updated phar with the patches soon).\n@macka601 mobs aren't implemented in PocketMine at all rights now :) \n. In that case the plugin in question is probably not registering the commands properly. Should not be an issue with PocketMine, talk to the plugin developers.\n. You can't simply just change some strings and expect for things to work. This PR will not allow 0.14.1 clients to join -- you need to change the protocol version for that (and if you were, you should probably be implementing the protocol changes, if any).\nFurthermore, before you commit a PR you aught to have a bit of familiarity with the project that you're contributing to... let alone follow the contributing guidelines.\nThere is no good reason to add messages like \"join with x client version\" to the server log, it is unnecessary information.\n. This still does not resolve any of the issues I stated...\nYou still have the unneeded console messages, changes to irrelevant things, and a whole bunch of poorly named commits which should be squashed.\nHave you looked into the protocol changes either before you updated the protocol version? Your PR looks just like #4115 which was closed for not accounting for protocol changes.\n. ... test out PRs locally before you submit them publicly to a repo. You don't need 3 PRs for the same exact thing -- if you were rejected once, why would you abruptly make another PR? Have you implemented the 0.14.1 protocol changes? I don't see that (and if you don't know what changed, you should not be making updating the protocol version).\nSquash your commits (I've said this twice), implement the protocol changes and stop getting ahead of yourself. It's not just a matter of changing some files, and saying \"I'm done.\"\nI'd go as far to say that you are _abusing _ the PR system, if that isn't clear to you.\n. Client built-in server also seems to use \"0.14.1\" when broadcasting but we may want to stick to \"0.14.1.0\" for consistency's sake. Either way I don't think this matters really.\n. This is nice, maybe people will start implementing protocol changes instead of just changing versions ;)\nA bit of UI changes in the client too, from my first looks.\n. Do you not realize that by making useless issues that have nothing to do with the actual repository you are only adding on to said issue? Use a fork if you must (this is FOSS nature) but don't come back here and derail the source project. That goes against the whole premise of open source software collaboration.\nWhy don't you discuss these issues with PocketMine in an appropriate place instead of on GitHub issues?\n0.14.1 made changes to the protocol, and nobody (as far as I can tell) has actually bothered to implement those changes (even if those changes might be minor). I'm seeing the default reaction of \"new PE update; update the server protocol version\" which is quite sad.\n. Talk to the plugin developers, this is not an issue with PocketMine. PocketMine additionally does not support 0.14.1 clients at the moment.\n. Squash the commits, you have two with the same changes. Also, does this not conflict with #4133?\n. I've also seen this issue. It's not just limited to inventory swapping, but picking up items and dropping them.\nThe client and server get stuck into a nearly endless argument that results in packet spam from both directions.\nSimple solution that I've seen is to just acknowledge the change and not echo the packet back unless it's not a legal action.\n. Yeah, MiNET doesn't seem to echo the packet back to the client so it fits in with my findings :p\nAnyways this may be an issue with slot mapping  differences in the Windows 10 Edition. But the easiest way at least in my opinion is to just not echo the packet back.. that way we can avoid potential side effects in PE. \n. Duplicate of #3173.\n@robske110 that's not much of a solution rather a hack to just \"make it work\"...\nThe generator code as a whole needs to be updated. \n. @robske110 does that commit actually fix generating dirt in seas? It seems to just block dirt from growing into grass unless I'm mistaken. I'm assuming that it just so happens to fix grass under seas (since you linked that commit) but this is something that should generally be handled in the generator.\n. Ah, I see.\n. @NoBakaCookies4U read the other messages. @robske110 already brung up the cause of issue\n.

There are many other places that tell you how to do that.\n. What's the point of creating this useless event?\n. Where is it called?\n. You said that the \"event is called when the hunger from the player changes\". I'm asking where in the code this event is called.\n.

This is somewhat already possible with the use of RCON.

Either way, this is irrelevant.\n. Ah, yes -- it's just Xamarin.\n. Based on your PR, there's been absolutely no protocol changes, am I right?\n. Which is? Shouldn't your PR address the change then?\n. @jojoe77777 custom skins can already be used, so I don't really see what you're referring to here. Unless massive things changed with the skin rendering model, or how skins are transmitted, there would be no protocol-related changes, in this regard.\n. ",

First off, I advise you to use the pocketmine forums for help, the pocketmine github page is more for tracking bugs instead of help requests.\nNow, for the actual help:\n(edit: 0.14.2 is available to be downloaded on bintray )\nWhen you are able to get the correct .phar file update for 0.14.2, here is what you have to do:\nDownload and replace the PocketMine-MP.phar file with the new one. (remember to rename it to PocketMine-MP.phar !)\nThen, update the PHP binaries to PHP7. they can be found here.\nOpen the downloaded file as an archive (using 7zip or winrar) and extract the new PHP files and replace the old php files.\nps: if you have any error after updating the phar and php files and then starting the server (something like \"bin\\php\\php.exe exit 127 missing file (OR) missing directory (OR something like that)\", Open up bin>php>php.exe and google the error, you are most likely missing some .dll file. DO NOT DIRECTLY DOWNLOAD A .DLL FILE, You have to use some installer to properly fix this missing .dll problem (most likely some microsoft distributable).\n. Please use the official pocketmine forums for help. The github issue tracker is for issues for pocketmine itself, not a help center.\n. I can back up the furnace issue. The lag with adding items into the furnace is occasional, and the crash happens when you try to access a furnace after rejoining the game. The only way to fix this is to break the furnace and place it back down.\nPocketmine-MP: last three versions I worked with (0.12.0, 0.12.1, 0.12.2)\nServer hosted on Windows 10, 8GB ram, i7\nClient: iOS (edit: iPhone)\n.

Thanks @extremeheat and all who are trying to solve this problem. I tried the latest Phar from the link extremeheat provided with v0.1.4.2 Windows 10 Edition. The problems of items dropping are mostly resolved. I used the crafting table and it worked:) I then mined some cobble and returned to the crafting table to make a cobble pickaxe. The game kicked me because I \"attempted to place more of an item than I have\". It seems to duplicate items occasionally when moving them around in inventory slots. I logged back in and returned to the crafting table and had the affect like juggling inventory slots shown on the video at this link: \nhttp://plays.tv/video/572a19dca39dc4ab98/-minecraft-juggling-inventory-in-minecraftwindows10edition-multiplayer-pocketminemp-server\n.

This is because the installed stable 1.4.1 PocketMine-MP.phar file is for one version of php (5.6.10) and the startup.sh (I assume the windows one as well) installed is geared for another version of php (7.0.?), to the point if php 7 is installed it will use that and if not found tells the user to install it \"Couldn't find a working PHP 7 binary, please use the installer.\".  Now sure it might work for some new users, but trying to find the answer took more effort that it should because of the answers given, or a basic shut down / failure to acknowledge the issue, hopefully this helps people that follow me.\nThe solution hinted at to install development version but that kind of defeats the point of the stable version.  Alternatively you can use the -p to inform startup.sh (guess other OSes will have the same switch else you need to force the right version of php) to use php 5.6.10.

    "richardpickett": "A couple months ago I thought I'd setup a minecraft server for my daughter\nand I to build on. I went with PocketMine, looked like it had the most\nfeatures, wide range of plugins, etc.\nhttps://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/graphs/contributors\nThis page bothered me a little, but I took the time to download and set it\nup anyway. Another problem was the main instructions from the pocketmine\nwebsite didn't give you a working server. I had to keep searching around\nfor different install instructions before I got it to work. That means just\nto use the product the user has to figure it out - the product owner\ndoesn't care that much if you can use it or not.\nAnyway, back to why that github page bothered me - that first graph shows a\nlot of initial work and then it tapers off to just about nothing. The \"a\nlot of initial work\" is normal, that's when you're first building something\nout and you've got that fever to get something done. But the \"tapers off to\njust about nothing\" is definitely not normal, that's a sign of a dead\nproject.\nEspecially when you think about something as critical as the current issue\ndiscussed on this thread - a simple change to allow a higher protocol\nnumber be accepted on the server. This simple change can't get addressed in\n2 weeks, and the only workarounds presented are pulling the change needed\nfrom somewhere else.\n-> That means the owner of the product really just doesn't care if you can\nuse it or not. <-\nAs great as pocketmine may have been, that statement sums up it's current\nstate.\nIt seems that although Shoghi didn't intend for his job change to affect\nPM, it actually has. His last greatest contribution seems to be the move to\nphp7, which was certainly a great feat, but I can't find anything\nsignificant after that upgrade. And he rarely, if ever, logs into his own\nproduct's forum. That doesn't sound like a lot of commitment. I'm not\nputting him down - I'm just observing. Maybe he's had something else in\nlife come up that we don't know. Got married, got sick (hope not). But\nwhatever the reason is, the product owner hasn't been able to dedicate his\ntime.\nFor PM to survive, it would take a couple devs who catch the fever and make\nregular contributions to it. At a minimum I'd expect to see someone at\nleast fix \"logged out due to Outdated server\" within a day, two at the most.\nI'm not going to advertise for Genisys, but since it was one of the other\nplatforms brought up, I figure I should post it's \"work history\":\nhttps://github.com/iTXTech/Genisys/graphs/contributors\nYou can see it's still quite active. And the other one mentioned was\nclearsky:\nhttps://github.com/ClearSkyTeam/ClearSky/graphs/contributors\nNot as much as Genisys, but it's still being actively developed.\nI'll probably move off of PM, this obviously isn't working. Not sure which\none I'll move too - that's why I can safely say I'm not advertising\nanything.\nThanks, be blessed,\nRichard W.

I'm just pointing out it's no longer supported and no\none should have any expectation of future support from this product.\nAnd this goes for the other forks as well. They do not do it for a prophet.\nYou should make sure you understand the project clearly before you jump\ninto things. I made that mistake once.

I didn't even talk\nin these terms.\nSorry if i sound rude.\nYou don't sound rude. You sound ignorant. I write \"Aaaaaaaa\" and you argue\n\"But Richard, 'Bbbbbbbbbb' is so wrong....\"\nPay attention.\n(archie426)\nRichard, if ur going to complain why dont you make commits?\nWhere is the complaint? I only point out PM is no longer supported.\nAlso, I said earlier the outdated server issue can be fixed by editing the\n.phar.\nSo easy that the Product Owner can't do it. That means he doesn't care if\nit's supported any more. That's all I'm saying.\nYou obviously do not know how hard it is to code.\nYou obviously know nothing about me.\nPocketmine (and its forks) are not for profit.\n(sigh) \"profit\" again. I didn't say anything about profit...\nThey do not want just the money.\nor money.\nThey just want to make a great server software that people will use and\ncontribute to.\nIt may be true that they \"want\" to. But what we want to do and what we do\nare two different things. As you can see. What has been accomplished is a\ngreat (or was a great) server software that people can contribute to. The\n\"will use\" part has faded already.\nSo your right-wing view of a company does not apply to pocketmine (and it s\nforks)\nWhat you really mean is your interpretation of what I've said into some\nright-wing statement about companies and profit doesn't apply to PocketMine.\nEverything I've actually said before running it through your interpretation\nlayer is perfectly true. PM isn't being supported any more. Unless some\ndevs pick it up and run with it it's going to stay dead.\nThe next thing that will drop off will be the downloads. Then finally the\nusers.\nOf course there will always be that small group of users that will keep\nediting phar files and telling others how to do the same, so they can all\ncontinue to use something that has no new features while other similar\nproducts continue to improve and implement new features all around them.\nThanks, be blessed,\nRichard W.
