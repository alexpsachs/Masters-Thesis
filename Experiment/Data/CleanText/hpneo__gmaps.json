    "hpneo": "Tienes raz\u00f3n, esas 2 funciones no dependen de un mapa para funcionar. Las cambi\u00e9 a est\u00e1ticas y se pueden usar como mencionas:\nhttp://hpneo.github.com/gmaps/examples/geolocation.html\nhttp://hpneo.github.com/gmaps/examples/geocoding.html\n. Tienes raz\u00f3n en lo que mencionas, sin embargo, el objetivo de pasarle un par\u00e1metro a la funci\u00f3n del evento es poder manejar el marcador dentro de gmaps (dentro de map.addMarker puedes definir los eventos que tendr\u00e1 el marcador y ah\u00ed  this hace referencia al mapa).\nVoy a revisar el c\u00f3digo que mencionas, lo primero que se me ocurre es validar que exista el argumento, o usar google.maps.event.trigger(map.markers[0], 'click', {}).\n. (Reci\u00e9n contesto XD) Tienes raz\u00f3n, corregido.\n. Me gusta la idea de los tests, es uno de los temas que faltan implementar a la biblioteca. Creo que podemos coordinar una tarde/noche para revisarlo.\n. Me gusta -\n. u_u\n. BTW, acabo de ver que en la documentaci\u00f3n de Static Maps han agregado un par\u00e1metro scale (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/#scale_values) para mapas en alta resoluci\u00f3n (tipo pantallas retina). Lo agrego al rato, creo.\n. Hi, gmaps.js has MIT license.\n. #exito\n. Hi, I think you're using Google Maps API version 2, which gmaps.js doesn't support. Also, the gmaps' constructor is \"GMaps\", not \"GMap\".\n. Hi, you can customize marker icons in \"addMarker\" method using the \"icon\" option (you can use all the options of google.maps.MarkerOptions: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#MarkerOptions)\n. Not yet, but I have plans to add marker clustering as soon as I can. Although, you can use a marker clustering library with gmaps.js. You only need access to the map markers, using the \"markers\" property of your GMaps instance.\n. Check the last version (0.2.19) :)\n. Hi, I tried the demos in Firefox 12.0 in Windows 7 and Ubuntu and work well. Could you please give me more information?\nThanks.\n. I've posted a response in Issue #18: https://github.com/HPNeo/gmaps/issues/18#issuecomment-6082504\nIt would be great to expand the library using other map providers.\n. I'm going to study the Open Layers API and others map services to see if it's possible to implement wrappers for these services.\nNevertheless, I've thought of requesting a permission from Google.\n. Hi, I've added this method in the last release. Thanks for the feedback.\n. I added two new methods: fitBounds and fitZoom. The first one fits the zoom according to a collection of LatLng objects, and fitZoom fits the zoom according all markers in the map.\n. Hi. This is a feature that I will be adding in next releases.\n. Hi. I added this feature in the last version. You can check an example here: https://github.com/HPNeo/gmaps/blob/master/examples/overlay_map_types.html#L14\n. I uploaded an example to see the code in action: http://hpneo.github.com/gmaps/examples/overlay_map_types.html\n. Now you can use all native methods directly from GMaps object.\n. Hi, you can use \"map\" attribute to access the native google.maps.Map object.\n. Sure:\n``` javascript\nvar map = new GMaps({\n  lat: -12.033,\n  lng: -77.11,\n  div: '#map'\n});\n//yourcode\nmap.map.setMapTypeId('satellite');\n``\n. Hi, I added support to GeoJSON in drawPolygon and uploaded an example: http://hpneo.github.com/gmaps/examples/geojson_polygon.html\n. gmaps.js is non-framework dependent since 0.2 version.\n. Hi, you can usemarker.click(marker)to trigger the marker's click event.\n. That's the right way, it shouldn't throw any error. I'm gonna check this bug.\n. You can usemap.removeMarkers()to remove all markers.\n. You can use all google.maps.MapOptions parameters in GMaps constructor. In this case you can usescrollwheel: false. Hi, you can use thewaypoints` option (read more here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#DirectionsRequest and here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#DirectionsWaypoint)\n. Not yet, but the format would be:\nmap.getRoutes({\n...,\n  waypoints: [{\n    location: new google.maps.LatLng(lat_number, lng_number),\n    stopover: false\n  },{\n    location: new google.maps.LatLng(another_lat_number, another_lng_number),\n    stopover: false\n  }]\n});\n. Please post a fiddle (http://jsfiddle.net/) with your code.\n. Hi, you can use getRoutes method this way:\njavascript\nmap.getRoutes({\n  origin: [origin.lat(), origin.lng()],\n  destination: [destination.lat(), destination.lng()],\n  travelMode: 'driving',\n  callback: function(e){\n    routes = e;\n    alert(routes[0].legs[0].distance.value);\n  }\n});\n. Could you please show a screenshot of this?\n. Upload the screenshot in any image service (i.e.: http://imgur.com/) and post the direct link here.\n. Try using refresh method.\n. Hi, check this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Lk4gx/13/\nIn this case, you need to trigger the resize event of Map object every time you build it. GMaps has a method called refresh that triggers the resize event, but you need to call it when your map is loaded.\n. You're using wrong the setCenter method. You must pass latitude and longitude separately:\njavascript\nvar map;      \n$('#myModal').on('show', function () {\n    map = new GMaps({\n        div: '#map_canvas',\n        lat: 32.048820,\n        lng: 118.797733,\n        width: 'auto',\n        height: '300px',\n        idle: function(){\n            map.refresh();\n        },\n        resize: function(){\n            var center = map.getCenter();\n            map.setCenter(center.lat(), center.lng());\n        }\n  });\n});\n. Hi, try with this instead. I'll check this issue.\n. nop\n. Fixed in 0.2.6 version\n. For now:\njavascript\nmarker  = map.addMarker({...});\nmarker.setMap(null);\n. It would be possible to adapt your pull request with the new version?\n. Please post some screenshots.\n. Upload the screenshot in any image service (i.e.: http://imgur.com/) and post the direct link here.\nAlso, check this example: http://jsfiddle.net/Lk4gx/13/\n. Try this: https://github.com/HPNeo/gmaps/issues/53\n. Yes, in addMarker method add icon: \"https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/images/beachflag.png\".\n. Sorry about that. The last commit had a bug and now it's fixed. Thanks for the alert.\n. I don't see the advantage of this feature instead using icon property of addMarker method. I think icon is more flexible.\n. I didn't implement removeRoute, but you can do something like:\n``` javascript\nvar drawnRoute;\nmap.drawRoute({\n  ...,\n  callback: function() {\n    drawnRoute = map.polylines[map.polylines.length - 1];\n  }\n});\n```\nAnd remove it with:\njavascript\nmap.removePolyline(drawnRoute);\n. Use mapType: 'hybrid' in the constructor or map.map.setMapTypeId('hybrid')\n. Yes, map.removeMarkers()\n. I think the marker animation should be available on more than just one event (i.e.: 'drop' when is created and 'bounce' after is dropped).\n. I think the animation should be detached from the marker constructor. I really don't see the difference between:\njavascript\nmap.addMarker({\n  dropAnimation: 'drop',\n  animation: {\n    style: 'bounce',\n    event: 'click'\n  }\n});\nand\njavascript\nmap.addMarker({\n  animation: 'drop',\n  click: function(marker){\n    marker.setAnimation('bounce');\n  }\n});\nAlso, in the last example I can add any other event, like:\njavascript\nmap.addMarker({\n  animation: 'drop',\n  click: function(marker){\n    marker.setAnimation('bounce');\n  },\n  mouseout: function(marker){\n    marker.setAnimation('drop');\n  }\n});\nBut, your feature makes me think in a new object which can manage complex animations using Projections (i.e.: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10178789/reverse-animation-for-google-map-marker-removal).\nWhat do you think?\n. This feature isn't approved yet\n. Because a google.maps.Map object is attached to a one container: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#Map\n. Please, post your code.\nEDIT: Check if you set streetViewControl option in the constructor. By default is true.\n. Hi, it's fixed now.\nEDIT: You can pass any native option from google.maps.Map constructor in the GMaps constructor.\n. Hi, I can't see the link. You can use the drawCircle method (https://github.com/HPNeo/gmaps/blob/master/gmaps.js#L554). I'm working on the documentation.\n. Well, you can use getRoutes as reference. and you could use the service this way:\n``` javascript\nvar locations = [];\nmap.getElevations({\n  locations: locations,\n  callback: function(results, status){\n    console.log(results);\n  }\n})\n```\nThanks for the contribution!\n. You can use createControl and getRoutes.\n. You can see it in the examples: http://hpneo.github.com/gmaps/examples/routes_advanced.html and http://hpneo.github.com/gmaps/examples/travel_route.html (click in the map to get an origin and destination)\n. Could you please add an example file?\n. I need an example file in the commit (like /examples/static.html, /examples/static_markers.html and /examples/static_polylines.html) to merge this pull request.\n. Hi, I'm using your configuration and it works here:\njavascript\n  map = new GMaps({\n        div: '#map',\n        lat: -12.043333,\n        lng: -77.028333,\n        height: '100px',\n        zoomControl : true,\n        zoomControlOptions: {\n            style: google.maps.ZoomControlStyle.SMALL,\n            position: google.maps.ControlPosition.TOP_LEFT\n        },\n        scrollwheel: false,\n        panControl: false,\n        mapTypeControl: false,\n        scaleControl: false,\n        streetViewControl: true,\n        mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP\n      });\n\nFor the infoWindow bug, check if you have defined a box-sizing property defined for div tag in your CSS.\n. Use initial value in box-sizing\n. Hi, use map: map.map to access the native google.maps.Map object.\n. Not yet. But, you can try any marker clustering library using markers property to access all the markers created in the map.\n. I added a markerClusterer option in the GMaps constructor, so you can use this way:\njavascript\n  map = new GMaps({\n    div: '#map',\n    lat: -12.043333,\n    lng: -77.028333,\n    markerClusterer: function(map) {\n      return new MarkerClusterer(map);\n    }\n  });\nWhen you add a marker, the marker clusterer will update automatically the map's viewport.\nNOTE: You need to import the marker clusterer library.\n. Hi, the cluster icons are defined in the MarkerClusterer constructor, as you can see in the source code of this example: http://google-maps-utility-library-v3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/markerclusterer/examples/advanced_example.html\nThe addMarker defined in a custom library doesn't create the cluster icons, just adds the marker in its internal array of markers, which it will use to calculate the clusterers.\n. Just replace the default instance with MarkerClusterer(map, [], options).\nBy default, MarkerClusterer set its markers array with [], so it should be the same.\n. Hi, could you please add an example file (like /examples/static.html, /examples/static_markers.html, /examples/static_polylines.html, /examples/elevation_locations.html and /examples/elevation_routes.html)?\n. Hi, this is great, could you please create a pull request with this code? You must fork the repository, pull the files, add this code in the file gmaps.js, push your changes and create the pull request.\n. Hi, you can use the zIndex option in addMarker\n. Hi, the only parameter for infoWindow is content, where you can put any HTML you need. You can create custom \"infoWindows\" with Overlays (using drawOverlay)\n. Yes, you're right. Check the Google Maps API reference page for more information. I will update the documentation with the infoWindow events.\n. Use icon option in addMarker. Also, check this: https://developers.google.com/chart/image/docs/gallery/dynamic_icons#pins\n. Please post your code.\n. Check this fiddle. I use your code and it seems to work fine http://jsfiddle.net/HPNeo/N7Vvv/\n. I can't replicate the bug. This error is caused because gmaps can't find the container div of the map, and it hasn't thrown in the link above.\n. Use icon: \"path/to/image.gif\" in the addMarker method\n. Set mapType: 'satellite' option in the GMaps constructor.\n. Sure, I need to update the documentation someday soon...\n. How about enable/disable these layers? Maybe with addLayer/removeLayer.\n. Also, could you please add the documentation in the gh-pages branch (documentation.html file)?\n. Please, exclude the Fusion Tables and KML layers. Google Maps API allows to add many FT and KML layers, unlike Bicycling, Traffic, Transit and others.\n. Could you please add an example file?\n. I can't see the search method in https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#PlacesService.\nAlso, I think you must create the TextSearchRequest and PlaceSearchRequest objects in addLayer and pass the options to them, since the goal of gmaps is passing only the necessary attributes in its methods.\n. Yes, I just noticed it. Excuse the delay. I'm gonna merge this pull request, but I'd like to know if you can detail a little more the addLayer method in the documentation. For each case, I'd like to see which are the options available.\n. I think you should add the optional parameters in addLayer, like nearbySearch and textSearch.\n. Hi, options.options is an optional parameter, used by getCurrentPosition (like accuracy, timeout, etc.). So, if options.options isn't defined, getCurrentPosition uses its default values.\nFor more information: http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html\n. Sorry for the delay, GitHub didn't notify me when you pushed these changes. Great work!\n. Could you please add code and screenshot?\n. Hi, did you solve it?\n. Hi, Stamen Maps now has a custom MapType for Google Maps, so you could use this way:\n``` javascript\n  gmaps = new GMaps({\n    lat: 37.7,\n    lng: -122.4,\n    mapTypeControlOptions: {\n      mapTypeIds: [\"toner\", \"watercolor\"]\n    }\n  });\ngmaps.map.mapTypes.set(\"toner\", new google.maps.StamenMapType(\"toner\"));\n  //or\n  //gmaps.map.mapTypes.set(\"watercolor\", new google.maps.StamenMapType(\"watercolor\"));\n```\n. Hi, which browser did you use?\nEDIT: Also, please post your code.\n. Hi, please post your code.\n. Hi, I fixed this bug.\n. You're right. I fixed this bug and tested it in markers.html\n. Please, post your code in http://jsfiddle.net/ to see what's going on. I can't reproduce these bugs.\n. I see you're doing this:\n``` javascript\nvar user = map.createMarker({\n    lat:position.coords.latitude,\n    lng:position.coords.longitude,\n    //icon:\"/interface-elements/user.png\",\n    title: 'User Location',\n    details:{\n        name:'userLocation'\n    },\n    infoWindow: {\n        content: 'This is you'\n    }\n});    \nmap.addMarker(user);\n```\nYou should use:\njavascript\nuser.setMap(map.map);\naddMarker uses internally the createMarker method, so that's would be the reason why is showing 2 infoWindows when you click the marker.\n. Instead.\nI updated the library to support native google.maps.Marker objects in addMarker, so you can still add markers created with createMarker (which makes sense, though).\n. There was a bug in the last version. Fixed.\n. Hi, you can toggle map controls using the setOptions method.\n. Done in the last version.\n. Hi, the last version does.\n. If oms is your GMaps object, try with map: oms.map\n. Hi, I updated the library with the removeMarker method.\n. Hi, I just added the icons option a couple of days ago.\n. Hi, I fixed this bug.\n. Yes. The goal of gmaps is provide a simplified interface for Google Maps API, so you can extend functionalities like that the way you prefer.\n. Hi, yes, you can set the content of an overlay as HTML.\n. Hi, please set layer in floatPane.\n. Sure ;)\n. HI, I tried your code in a fiddle and it's working OK http://jsfiddle.net/HPNeo/XmNjL/. Please post more information about your bug.\n. I added removePolygon and removePolyline methods, which works exactly like removeMarker. I'm gonna close this issue because I don't see any link with code replicating the bug(s) you mention.\nIf you want to discuss about a new features or bugs, please create a new issue. It will help to organize the requests.\n. Hi, the next weekend I will start to code some new features, including this.\n. The last version has support for Street View Panoramas. Check the tests for usage example.\n. Please post your code in a fiddle (http://jsfiddle.net/)\n. Maybe is your CSS. Check for global styles (like div or *)\n. Hi, the overlay width depends of your CSS.\n. I haven't, maybe you can use min-width or something like that.\n. Please, post a fiddle with your code.\n. You're trying to bind a click event to a <a> element which has not been created yet. Use $(document).on('click', '.teste', function(){}) instead\n. ;)\n. Please post your code in http://jsfiddle.net/\n. I think it's related to: https://github.com/HPNeo/gmaps/issues/34\n. Hi, you can use drawOverlay to create custom infoWindows, though there's not an example of this. You can use this example as an approach http://hpneo.github.com/gmaps/examples/overlays.html\n. You can draw/remove an overlay inside the marker events, which is basically the way that infoWindows work. Maybe I will post some examples this weekend.\n. Hi, I couldn't do anything this weekend, I'm pretty busy right now.\n. Hi, There are two methods removePolygon and removePolygons which delete a selected polygon, or the whole collection. About handling event listeners (add and remove), it's planned to next versions.\n. HI, use fitLatLngBounds instead fitBounds. fitZoom only works if you have markers added in your map.\n. Hi, I (re) added this feature. Apparently, it was deleted at some point. Check the example in https://github.com/HPNeo/gmaps/blob/master/examples/context_menu.html for reference.\n. You're welcome!\n. Hi. Use getCenter().lat() and getCenter().lng()\n. It seems fine to me. Maybe you can set the initial coordinates in $('#jform_latitude') and $('#jform_longitude').\n. The test suite has been merged to the master branch, so any new big feature must have at least a test. Any suggestion is allowed.\n. Hi, check this issue https://github.com/HPNeo/gmaps/issues/44\n. Hi, the style attribute isn't supported in GMaps constructor. Try with:\njavascript\nmap = new GMaps({\n  div: '#map',\n  lat: '<?php echo $this->item->map[\"latitude\"]; ?>',\n  lng: '<?php echo $this->item->map[\"longitude\"]; ?>',\n  zoom: <?php echo $this->item->map['zoom']; ?>,\n  height: '300px',\n  width: '100%'\n});\nHave you define a CSS rule for #map with width and height?\n. Use map.refresh() in the shown event of Bootstrap Tabs.\n. Hi, thanks for the submission! I added a tag for the last version, which is 0.2.30. I will add tags for each upcoming versions.\nThanks for the suggestion.\n. Hi. gmaps has GMaps.geocode, which returns, in a callback, an array of google.maps.GeocoderResult objects. You can read the reference of this object specification or check an example using gmaps.\nIn the callback you can fill your inputs with the first result of geocode. Also, you can use jQuery UI Autocomplete with external source, just like this:\n``` javascript\n  $(input).autocomplete({\n    source: function(request, response) {\n      GMaps.geocode({\n        address: request.term,\n        callback: function(result, status) {\n          if (status == 'OK') {\n            mapped_results = $.map(result, function(geocoder_result) {\n              return {\n                label: place.formatted_address,\n                value: place.formatted_address,\n                object: geocoder_result\n              };\n            });\n          }\n          else {\n            mapped_results = []\n          }\n          response(mapped_results);\n        }\n      });\n    },\n    select: function(event, ui) {\n      $(input).val(ui.item.value);\n  location = ui.item.object.geometry.location;\n  fill_inputs_with_location(location);\n}\n\n});\n``\n. I can't understand you very well. The callback option ingeocodewill fire when the request has been completed, and  you can use theresultsargument inside the callback to iterate over the results that Google returns.\n. Hi, it appears to be a bug in IE when calculating the dimensions of the map container. I will check that.\n. Yes, if you want to force the width and height of the map container, just setwidthandheight. Merged, thanks!\n. Hi, just changemaptomap.map`:\njavascript\ngoogle.maps.event.addListener(map.map, 'bounds_changed', removeMarkers);\n. Yes, just pass an array of markers in removeMarkers\n. No, sorry. Google Places is beyond the scope of gmaps.\n. I'm working on more examples on the weekend. If you have more suggestions for examples please post them here.\n. I've recreated the Angular UI example, with jQuery and gmaps.js: http://hpneo.github.com/gmaps/examples/interacting.html\nI will post more examples later or tomorrow.\n. Hi, I added the code in the example page.\n. I've done another example using data from Foursquare: http://hpneo.github.com/gmaps/examples/json.html\nThe example uses CoffeeMaker\n. In the last version of gmaps.js, I've added support for events:\njavascript\nGmaps.on(event_name, object, handler);\nYou can check the specs for Events to learn more about using events in gmaps.js\nmap is a GMaps object property which references to the native google.maps.Map object.\n. That's right. gmaps.js is not a jQuery plugin. It's a library for working with Google Maps in an easy way, using a syntax similar to jQuery (mostly because jQuery is the most used JavaScript library). It borrows some terms from jQuery (like on) because thanks of jQuery, these terms have become de facto standards.\nIn the examples I use jQuery because simplifies me a lot the work I have to do for selecting or binding events to DOM elements.\n. No. Gmaps.js is framework agnostic since 0.2 version\n. Sorry about that. I'm noob in git tags and I didn't know that \"0.3\" were an invalid version number.\nI've updated gmaps.js to the 0.3.1 version, and added the respectively git tag too.\n. Hi, do you have any general CSS rule using box-sizing? Also, you can check this issue: https://github.com/HPNeo/gmaps/issues/44 for more information.\n. Hi, you can check this example: http://hpneo.github.com/gmaps/examples/fusion_tables.html. loadFromFusionTables returns a google.maps.FusionTablesLayer object, which has a setOptions method, where you can set a query (read more here https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#FusionTablesLayer)\n. Hi, I've added a fix to this bug, thanks for notice.\nAbout your code, I think you must add the Fusion Tables layer once and then change the query in changeSelection\n. Hi, use the draggable option in addMarker\n. Check  #44 \n. Fixed.\n. I will check this issue this weekend.\n. Fixed in v0.4.5\n. Hi, you can store a marker in a variable and update its position with setPosition method (from google.maps.Marker)\n. For now, the context menu is available for one map.\n. Yes, maybe later or tomorrow I will update this feature.\n. Hi, i added the support for context menu in multiple maps: @9c1a4a94a5afe5ca88532eb1a9071feab9cdd81e\n. Hi, e is an array of google.maps.DirectionsRoute\n. As far as I know, is just the style.\n. Fixed in @01cc98166ddaff26acf0fafc70e2c8e6535729fb\n. Hi, this is fixed now in v0.4.3\n. Yes, you should iterate through your list of addresses this way:\njavascript\nfor (var i = 0; i < addresses.length; i++) {\n  var address = addresses[i];\n  GMaps.geocode({\n    address: address,\n    callback: function(results, status) {\n      if (status == 'OK') {\n        var latlng = results[0].geometry.location;\n        map.addMarker({\n          lat: latlng.lat(),\n          lng: latlng.lng()\n        });\n      }\n    }\n  });\n}\n. Fixed in 0.4.4\n. Hi, I can't reproduce this bug in the markers example page. Could you please post the error message? In that page I'm using the latest version of Google Maps API (3.13)\n. Hi, I don't understand your issue. In the documentation about Geocoding there's no example like the one you posted above.\nIn gmaps you can use geocoding with the same options as defined in google.maps.GeocoderRequest.\n. I think you can use the region option, or append the city code + country code at the end of the address:\nstadium, NY, US\n. HI, could you please post your code in jsfiddle? I've checked the method in http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/ and http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/markers.html and it works fine.\n. Good idea. I will check this for the next version.\n. Hi. Thanks for this! I have one requirement for merge this pull request: Could you please re-add the jasmine test file? I would like to check the tests without using Grunt.\n. Done!\n. Of course. Any contribution is welcomed.\n. You only need to create the polygon once and update the path with setPath.\n. Please check map.markers in your Chrome console after you added a marker manually. It should return an array with 1 marker.\nAre you using Twitter Bootstrap or any other CSS framework? Check this link: https://github.com/HPNeo/gmaps/issues/44\n. Hi, could you please post your code in a fiddle in jsfiddle.net?\n. Hi, the marker is added correctly. Zoom out to see it.\n. Hi, could you please post your code in a fiddle in jsfiddle.net? I don't use Twitter Bootstrap.\n. That's great! In A small guide about contributing you can see some style directives.\nThanks for contributing :+1: \n. Hi, could you please post your code in a fiddle in jsfiddle.net? It works fine here: http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/map_types.html (try typing in the Chrome console: map.map.setMapTypeId('cloudmade'); or map.map.setMapTypeId('osm');)\n. Hi, I've checked three items of the list that could improve the code quality:\ncurly - This option requires you to always put curly braces around blocks in loops and conditionals. JavaScript allows you to omit curly braces when the block consists of only one statement\neqeqeq - This options prohibits the use of == and != in favor of === and !==.\nnewcap - This option requires you to capitalize names of constructor functions. Capitalizing functions that are intended to be used with new operator is just a convention that helps programmers to visually distinguish constructor functions from other types of functions to help spot mistakes when using this.\ncurly and newcap are already used, but eqeqeq isn't.\n. Perfect.\n. Hi, sorry for the delay. I agree with you about the naming conventions. In the future I will standarize it in some way. I think gmaps currently supports the strict mode. indent definitely is a must (unless it requires an enormous effort) and shadow should be false IMHO.\nI will check your repository as soon as I get some free time.\n. I don't see this bug in http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/new_style.html\n. Oh, okay. You should change the default map style instead of creating a new styled map type, using map.setOptions({styles: new_styles}), where new_styles should be the value in map.map.mapTypes.map_style.styles\n. Hola, en el fiddle que pones no veo c\u00f3mo se puede reproducir el error. Anteriormente he visto implementaciones de mapas dentro de ventanas modales y no ha pasado esto. Si es posible que puedas dar m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n y un fiddle actualizado para resolver tu pregunta ser\u00eda mejor.\n. El fiddle sigue sin mostrar un mapa dentro de una ventana de di\u00e1logo. Si tienes un ejemplo ya implementado puedes poner el enlace.\n. Prueba ejecutando el m\u00e9todo refresh(). En teor\u00eda deber\u00eda cambiar de tama\u00f1o autom\u00e1ticamente pero en este caso no parece funcionar.\n. You can map all the coordinates of your route and use fitLatLngBounds. Each coordinate must be a google.maps.LatLng object\n. Hi, I've just tried your code and doesn't work.\n. Hi, could you post a fiddle with an example?\n. I think you need to use getRoutes. Check the code of this example: http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/travel_route.html or read the documentation: http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/documentation.html#GMaps-getRoutes\n. I don't understand your question. I assume Clusterer is a custom class?\n. This is not a question about gmaps. You probably need to check some examples about event listening in MarkerClusterer.\n. Yes, gmaps is a library that goes above the Google Maps API library, and provides accessors for native Google Maps objects such map, polygons and markers, so you can use google.maps.event.addListener.\n. I'm not sure if this feature should be in gmaps. Maybe I'll write an extension and store it in https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps.extensions.\n. Hi, I'm checking your code and I think it might fail in some cases. I will post some comments in your code, but first you need to apply your changes in lib/gmaps.markers.js since gmaps.js is a generated file.\n. Hi, you can attach a mouseover event to the map and change the icon property of any marker. Check http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/map_events.html for events and https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#Marker for markers.\nAny marker added to a map can be accessed with the markers property.\n. When you create a map using gmaps, you must do this way:\nvar map = new GMaps({\n  lat: latitude,\n  lng: longitude,\n  el: '#map-container'\n});\nThen, you can use map to add markers, and use map.map to access the Google Maps Map object.\n. You need to use getRoutes. Check the code of this example: http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/travel_route.html or read the documentation: http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/documentation.html#GMaps-getRoutes\n. Hi, thanks for contributing! could you please revert the changes in gmaps.js? This file is generated.\nAlso, it could be great if you create a new example file using this feature.\n. Hi, it's a great idea but I think there are other dependency managers that use this repo and remove gmaps.js will cause extra issues.\n. This bug has been fixed in the last version\n. I don't think it's possible, do you have any example?\n. You can use jQuery UI Autocomplete with Google Places service. I'm not sure if I should add this feature in gmaps or maybe in the extensions repo.\n. Hi, check the geolocation example: http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/geolocation.html. In success you can add a marker using position.coords.latitude and position.coords.longitude\n. Thanks!\n. Hi, check if you have an element with id map_canvas and if your initialize function is called after the DOM is ready.\n. I'm not sure but I think the source of the bug is here:\nhtml\n<div id=\"map-canvas\" class=\"glow\"><div/>\nIt should be\nhtml\n<div id=\"map-canvas\" class=\"glow\"></div>\n. Hi, you can use GMaps.geolocate and add a marker if the geolocation succeed.\n. Sorry for being out for so long. I fixed the bug in the tests so I will check this PR and merge if all is ok.\n. Fixed.\n. Hi, use removePolygon or removePolygons\n. Hi, I fixed this spec.\n. Hi, you have to define the width and height of #map\n. Hi, could you please post some code? I just tried jQuery 1.10.2 with GMaps 0.4.9 and works fine.\n. Hi, could you please post your code in jsfiddle? It works fine here: http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/markers.html\n. You can filter markers using https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps.extensions (check gmaps.markerFilter.js).\nAlso, GMaps supports Marker Clusterer (check examples/marker_clusterer.html in this repo). You will need to manually update the Clusterer to showing/hidding markers.\n. Hi, I'm sorry for not responding this issue before. I closed a lot of issues this weekend because they didn't have a reply in months (or in this case, in years), which I'm really really sorry.\nIf you still have this problem let me know so I can reopen it.. Added the info in the README, I don't know why I've seen this before :disappointed: \n. Please, post a fiddle with your code.\n. Please remove the protocol in gmaps.static.js.\n. You can remove markers with removeMarkers method, passing an array of google.maps.Marker objects.\n. Hi @albertojm, is markers_data an array of plain objects or an array of google.maps.Marker objects? It needs to be the latter one.\n. Disculpa, no veo la meta de este pull request.\n. I've run a quick test and it seems to be a bug when GMaps tries to calculate the container dimensions, due the doctype. You must set the width and height in pixels:\njavascript\nvar map = new GMaps({\n  div: \"#map\",\n  lat: -12.043333,\n  lng: -77.028333,\n  width: '400px',\n  height: '300px',\n});\n. Thanks for noticing this. It's fixed no in 0.4.19\n. Use refresh() method. Maybe your map container (defined with div or el property in the GMaps constructor) changes its dimensions after the map is initialized.\n. Please, post a fiddle with your code.\n. Hi, use refresh()\n. You need to use the refresh method after showing the modal, since the Google Maps map will be created before the modal is shown. When a HTML element is hidden (as your modal), the browser can't know its dimensions, so Google Maps. With map.refresh(), Google Maps redraws the map using the current dimensions of its container, which is visible now.\n. Please check this link: http://stackoverflow.com/a/7510891\n. Please check if you have global styles for imgand div.\n. Hi, please check this link: http://stackoverflow.com/a/18146563\n. Hi, have you tried: \njavascript\nvar map = new GMaps({\n  scrollwheel: false\n});\n. Is not the same as doing?:\njavascript\nmap.addMarker({\n  lat: -12.042,\n  lng: -77.028333,\n  title: 'Marker with InfoWindow',\n  infoWindow: {\n    content: '<p>HTML Content</p>'\n  },\n  mouseover: function(e) {\n    this.infoWindow.open(this.map, this);\n  }\n});\n. Please, put your changes in the file that corresponds. gmaps.js is built using the files stored in lib folder. You can create a new file if you like.\n. Please post a fiddle with your code if you still have this problem.\n. Thanks!\n. I added the repo URL in https://github.com/HPNeo/gmaps/wiki/Tips\n. Yes, please check http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/overlays.html and http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/documentation.html#GMaps-drawOverlay\n. Hi, thanks for noticing this bug. It's fixed now.\n. Thanks for noting it, it's fixed now.\n. options.scrollwheel is already accepted in the GMaps constructor, there's no need to define it explicitly. Also, GMaps.staticMapURL doesn't need a scrollwheel option since it generates an image.\n. Hi, you can set the API Key in the Google Maps API url (<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=true\"></script>)\n. I'm not sure if there's a way to fix that in Firefox, but for now add disableDoubleClickZoom: true in your map options.\n. Use the refresh method after the map container is visible.\n. Hi, apparently this feature is only available in Mobile API (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/map#indoor_maps), but if Google releases for the Web API I will add it in GMaps as soon as possible.\n. Hi, you need to refresh the map after showing the <div> container: http://jsfiddle.net/bDNbA/2/. Also, you don't need to create the map every time you want to show it.\n. Hi, according the Google Maps API v3 documentation, if you want an overlay to receive DOM events, it must been created in the overlayMouseTarget pane. By default, overlays are created in the overlayLayer pane. Check this link for more information: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#MapPanes\n. Please, post a fiddle with your code.\n. Hi, you need to set the waypoints this way: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/directions-waypoints?hl=es\n. Sorry for the delay, but you need to apply your changes in lib.\n. Please, post your fix in lib/gmaps.overlays.js. gmaps.js is a built file.\n. Hi, use thePoly.coordinatesinstead thePoly.\n. You can use fitZoom method for your first question. Maybe you can create a pull request implementing the fitBound improvement.\n. Hi, thanks! I've updated the documentation.\n. Hi, it's an interesting approach, maybe you can create a pull request implementing that.\n. Hi, I've had the same issue, and basically it's because there are some tests that require use of Google services (like routing) and it might be take a longer time than defined (3500 milliseconds in test/spec/RouteSpec.js).\n. Hi, check: https://github.com/HPNeo/gmaps/blob/master/examples/styled_maps.html\n. Hi, I'm so sorry for not seeing this post before. You can show an InfoWindow using this code:\n``` javascript\nvar infoWindow = new google.maps.InfoWindow({\n  content: 'you clicked a polyline'\n});\nmap.drawPolyline({\n  path: path,\n  strokeColor: '#131540',\n  strokeOpacity: 0.6,\n  strokeWeight: 6,\n  click: function(clickEvent) {\n    var position = clickEvent.latLng;\ninfoWindow.setPosition(position);\ninfoWindow.open(map.map);\n\n}\n});\n```\n. Hi, did you tried this:\njavascript\nmap = new GMaps({\n  div: '#map',\n  lat: -12.043333,\n  lng: -77.028333,\n  markerClusterer: function(map) {\n    return new MarkerClusterer(map, [], {\n      gridSize: 100\n    });\n  }\n});\nThat code works for me (I'm using http://google-maps-utility-library-v3.googlecode.com/svn/tags/markerclusterer/1.0/src/markerclusterer.js)\nThe markerClusterer option must be a function that returns a MarkerClusterer, so you can do:\n``` javascript\nmap = new GMaps({\n  div: '#map',\n  lat: -12.043333,\n  lng: -77.028333,\n  markerClusterer: function(map) {\n    var markerClusterer = new MarkerClusterer(map, [], {\n      gridSize: 100\n    });\n// according stackoverflow\nmarkerClusterer.onClickZoom = function() {\n  return multiChoice(markerCluster);\n};\nreturn markerClusterer;\n\n}\n});\n```\nAlso, the GMaps map has a property named markerClusterer, so you can use the marker cluster later.\n. Hi, I fixed that in the last version of gmaps :)\n. Hi, this event is triggered manually. Check the reference: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#Map\n. You need to set initial latitude and longitude.\n. Thanks!\n. Hi, you can use the GMaps.geocode method, using the address option.\n. @conor909 yes, sorry about that. I'm working on a better documentation.\n. I can't see the bug here. Did you tried to remove the jQuery reference in your HTML code?\n. Hi, this is the code for gmaps 0.4.15:\n``` javascript\nGMaps.prototype.removeMarker = function(marker) {\n  for (var i = 0; i < this.markers.length; i++) {\n    if (this.markers[i] === marker) {\n      this.markers[i].setMap(null);\n      this.markers.splice(i, 1);\n  if(this.markerClusterer) {\n    this.markerClusterer.removeMarker(marker);\n  }\n\n  GMaps.fire('marker_removed', marker, this);\n\n  break;\n}\n\n}\nreturn marker;\n};\n``\n. Could you post a fiddle with your code? I don't see the bug intoggleLayer`.\n. I found the bug. You need to replace:\njavascript\nfunction toggleLayer(layer, map) {\n  layer.setMap(layer.getMap() ? null : map);\n}\nwith\njavascript\nfunction toggleLayer(layer, map) {\n  layer.setMap(layer.getMap() ? null : map.map);\n}\nmap is a GMaps instance, map.map is the google.maps.Map object, and setLayer needs a google.maps.Map instance.\n. Hi, try this: https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps/issues/330#issuecomment-47184441\n. Could you please post your code here?\n. Hi, the line 22 is throw 'Google Maps API is required. Please register the following JavaScript library http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=true.'. \u00bfIt is true for you?\n. Did you enable the INTERNET permission in your Android project?\n. Please post a fiddle with your code. I tried with a custom code and works fine.\n. You can try map.refresh()\n. I don't know your code, but you need to call the refresh method of your GMaps instance after the tab has changed.\n. You need to use refresh() in tabcontent.js. Just after the tab is selected.\n. Sorry for the delay. The callback now passes a new array containing the requested routes only.\n. Hi,\nGMaps.geocode uses Google Geocoding API, so the results returned by this method are provided as is. Maybe you need to use another service more accurated.\n. What version are you using? check in the last build (0.4.16): https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps/blob/master/gmaps.js#L668\n. Hi, you need to use removePolyline, passing a polyline object as parameter. You can access the map's polylines with map.polylines property.\n. Hi, I've re-created one of those examples here: http://codepicnic.com/bites/map-types.\nAs you can see, it doesn't use jQuery.\n. As far as I know, you only need to add the protocol (like http: or https:) to the URLs.\n. Hi, check this: https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps/issues/46\n. Hi, you only can set the max-width for infoWindows: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#InfoWindowOptions\nIf you need a custom InfoWindow you may use overlays: http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/overlays.html\n. Hi, please try replacing latlong['B'] with latlong.lat() and latlong['k'] with latlong.lng().\n. Yes. You must use lat and lng methods, not k or D.\n. Hi, you can pass the HTML element instead a string selector:\njavascript\n$(\".google_map\").each(function(index, element) {\n  var map = new GMaps({\n    el: element\n  });\n  // ...\n}\n. What if I have more than one map in one page?\n. Uhm, ok. But, please, put your method in gmaps.core.js. gmaps.js is just a bundle.\n. Hi, check this demo: https://codepicnic.com/consoles/gmaps-js-overlappingmarkerspiderfier\n. @calvinmetcalf is the owner of the NPM package. I'm not sure if I can submit updates too.\n. https://www.npmjs.com/~hpneo\n. Thanks!\n. The current version now is 0.4.17, and I will publish new versions in NPM. Also, I would like to know what you think about this: https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps/issues/404\n. I've revert your pull request because your change breaks GMaps.prototype.createPanorama. If you think this approach is better or very different to the current implementation, please create another method.\n. I think you need to create another method, like GMaps.prototype.createPanoramaByLocation and pass callbacks for success / error, like in GMaps.prototype.getRoutes.\n. Hi, could you provide me the link from the Maps API page?\n. Hi, I added this feature in the 0.4.22 version. Check a demo here: https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps/blob/master/examples/render_directions.html\nSorry for the delay :disappointed: \n. Please move this function to gmaps.core.js. gmaps.js is just a autogenerated bundle.\n. I've moved 9 modules to NPM so far:\n- https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps.core (https://www.npmjs.com/package/gmaps.core)\n- https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps.controls (https://www.npmjs.com/package/gmaps.controls)\n- https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps.events (https://www.npmjs.com/package/gmaps.events)\n- https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps.geofences (https://www.npmjs.com/package/gmaps.geofences)\n- https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps.geometry (https://www.npmjs.com/package/gmaps.geometry)\n- https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps.layers (https://www.npmjs.com/package/gmaps.layers)\n- https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps.map_types (https://www.npmjs.com/package/gmaps.map_types)\n- https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps.markers (https://www.npmjs.com/package/gmaps.markers)\n- https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps.overlays (https://www.npmjs.com/package/gmaps.overlays)\nWhen I finish to move all the modules I will remove the lib from this repo and create bundles with all of these modules.\n. I'm so sorry, I've been really busy with my daytime job I'm not sure if I can make it.\nThere is already a bunch of gmaps modules on NPM but they're behind the gmaps master branch, so besides of finishing the split now I have to update the already created packages, and it's a lot of work I can't do right now.\nI hope I can make some time for this but I can't assure you.. Please move your code to gmaps.core.js. gmaps.js is a generated file.\n. Could you please post a demo with your code? Or the error log from the Dev Tools (or Firebug)\n. I pushed a new version that might fix this bug. Please tell me if it works.\n. Cool, thanks for the bug report\n. You can track the click event of the markers (check this example: http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/markers.html). You need to read about the Google Analytics JS API.\nAbout mailto links, you could be same as the markers, but adding an id attribute to the mailto link and using jQuery to capture the click event for that id.\n. I'm not sure what you mean. Right now you can attach an infoWindow to a marker using the infoWindow option in addMarker(), but only accepts the google.maps.InfoWindow properties.\n. You need to update manually the content of the InfoWindow in the click event (or any other place). I think you can use e.infoWindow.setContent(\"your new content\").\n. You're welcome!\n. You can use the tilesloaded event.\n. Hi, can you please move your changes from gmaps.js to gmaps.core.js? gmaps.js is just a file generated on each new version.\n. Right, sorry about that.\n. Please post your code. I didn't tried the Places library but I did load other libraries (like geometry), so it should work fine.\n. I found the bug. When you use PlacesService you need to pass the google.maps.Map instance (map.map), not the GMaps instance (map): https://codepicnic.com/bites/gmaps-js-issue-414\n. Check this example: http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/custom_controls.html\n. You can create a infoWindow for each one of your markers, and store that data in the details property of addMarker:\njavascript\nmap.addMarker({\n  lat: latitude,\n  lng: longitude,\n  details: {\n    imagePath: point.imagePath,\n    title: point.title,\n    description: point.description\n  },\n  infoWindow: {\n    content: '<h2>' + point.title + '</h2><p>' + point.description + '</p>'\n  }\n})\n. Duplicated of #418\n. Fixed in #422\n. I'm not familiar with the drawing tools but you can check if a marker is inside or outside using the method checkGeofence(latitude, longitude, polygon_circle_or_rectangle). It returns true if the point is inside, and false if not.\nYou can check for alerts using position_changed event in markers. For now, you need to do this for every marker in your map.\n. I didn't maintain that repo. I will update it in the next days, maybe the next week. So sorry, I'm really busy right now :disappointed: \n. Thank you @kevin-brown! You saved the day one more time :smiley: \n. Right, thanks @kevin-brown :)\n. Fixed, thanks @kevin-brown !\n. I don't understand what you're trying to do, but I think changing the strokeWeight or strokeOpacity to 0 should work.\n. Thanks! And sorry for the delay!\n. Thanks @amenadiel for this amazing explanation.\n. Currently there's no way to filter markers in gmaps. You can use this code: https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps.extensions/blob/master/lib/gmaps.markerFilter.js (in alpha) to extend GMaps and use it this way:\nmap.markerFilter(function() {\n  return this.category_id === 7;\n});\n. Check this example: http://jsfiddle.net/9ym3htwq/\n. You're welcome, I'm gonna add this issue to the Tips page.\n. Apparently, the weather layer was deprecated a month ago: http://googlegeodevelopers.blogspot.com/2014/06/sunsetting-javascript-api-weather-panoramio.html\n. Honestly I can't remember why I put that code, but I've never heard complains about it. When you create a map, you need to set a width and height to that map container (located in this.el). You can do it using CSS (as you can see in the \"examples\" folder), or you can set it in the GMapsconstructor.\nCan you post more info about your issue, like how you create a map or the container's CSS?\n. I will run tests in some browsers and check if those lines are unnecessary.\n. It seems to be \"impossible\" according this comment:\n\nHi to all,\nHave just had a comment from Google via a Maps-For-Work request for this feature:\n\"I am sorry to tell you that given the current backend, there is no plan to implement this feature.\"\nI guess we'll have to wait for them to update the backend then...\n\nHowever, you can do several requests, according this post in SO\n. Hi, I'm working on a modularized version of gmaps (check #404), so I will put this feature in gmaps.routes. Thanks for the feedback!\n. Hi, can you post your code in jsfiddle?\n. For now I can't be done the way you want, but you can wrap your content and add a class or id and use it to append events (using jQuery or plain DOM).\n. I just saw there's a click callback in drawOverlay, I've updated your fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/qdcmrnta/1/\n. Yes, you can use it like this: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/layer-heatmap, and change this line:\nheatmap.setMap(map);\nwith:\nheatmap.setMap(map.map);\nWhen map is a GMaps instance.\n. I guess you can draw polygons and attach click events to them, so when you click on a polygon, an info window shows.\n. I don't understand your question. You mean, when you click on a park or a building? You can use the Google Places API to get those data.\n. I don't think it's possible in Google Maps itself. Check these posts in Stack Overflow:\n- How to get a click event when a user clicks a (business) place on the map\n- Disable click behavior of POI markers in Google Maps v3.6\n. You can save the position (options.lat and options.lng) in the overlay object and then filter the map.overlays property to find the overlay that matches the requested position, and use removeOverlay to remove it. I'm always open to contributions, as long as you don't break backwards compatibility.\n. Have you tried to listen to the Polygon events and check if the editable property is true?\n. GMaps is exposed as global variable (window.GMaps), but I don't have a demo using RequireJS so I don't know if the file gmaps.js works fine. If you provide me one I can debug it.\n. I can't help you without see a demo of the bug. Has your map been created without throwing errors? Do your map's div contain other divs (check the screenshot)? Did the map's div have width and height?\n\n. Fixed in the 0.4.20 version\n. Can you post the entire code? The map initialization and the use of fitZoom.\n. I don't find any error in your code, maybe try putting that fitZoom inside a setTimeout with 0.\n. I can't reproduce the bug, please post a demo (you can use jsFiddle, codepen or any other web to do that).\n. Please put your code in jsfiddle or CodePen, but it might be what @sillassoares says.\n. To remove a circle you need to call removePolygon, passing the circle created with drawCircle.\n. Cool! I didn't know that. I'm closing this now.\n. I've tried in http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/ with 150, 150, and the map doesn't render any location. It seems to be a bug from Google Maps, since I've replicated the bug using Google Maps API:\njs\n// mapa.map.map is the reference to the original Google Maps Map object:\nmapa.map.map.panTo(new google.maps.LatLng(150, 150));\nOr check here: http://www.findlatitudeandlongitude.com/?lat=150&lon=150&zoom=7&map_type=G_NORMAL_MAP#.Vk6sR98veRt\n. I always use the latest version (without ?v=xxx). Maybe you need to use an earlier version?\n. Please post your code in jsfiddle.net, codepen or similars\n. I don't know if I understand correctly, but that set of coordinates can be your origin and destination. Also, you can use that coordinates as waypoints (you must use the waypoints property in travelRoute).\n. Thanks!\n. @hongz1 is right, this warning is solved by adding the Google Maps library in the proper way. I will update the GitHub Page to remove the sensor parameter from the demos.\n. Hi, it's related to remove custom controls:  https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps/blob/0.4.13/lib/gmaps.controls.js#L53 (like this: http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/custom_controls.html)\n. You can use GMaps.on:\njs\nGMaps.on('click', marker, function() {\n  $('#myModal').modal('show');\n});\n. For the moment there isn't a function to watch location. GMaps.geolocate uses navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition, so you can replace it with navigator.geolocation.watchPosition and use almost the same code.\n. It should work with el or div, and #map must have a width and height. Please post a demo with your code (you can use jsfiddle.net).\n. Try this:\n``` js\nvar filtered = map.markerFilter(function() { return this === 3; });\nfor (var index = 0; index < filtered.length; index++) {\n  filtered[index].setVisible(false);\n}\n``\n. Please post a demo with your code.\n. I've found the bug, inmarkerFilterI useddetailinstead ofdetails`. It's fixed now: https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps.extensions/blob/master/lib/gmaps.markerFilter.js\nAlso, compare this with $num using two equals, because $num is a number, and details is a string.\nCheck this demo: https://jsfiddle.net/Lbc99v16/\n. \u00bfTe sigue sin funcionar?\n. S\u00ed, lo pondr\u00e9 en el repo de gmaps.extensions. Gracias a ti por ayudarme a descubrir este bug.\n. Creo que podr\u00edas usar lodash para manejar colecciones. Ahora mismo no se me ocurre otra forma.\n. Hi, you can do the same, but changing infoWindow.open(map) to infoWindow.open(map.map)\n. Have you tried to move that code to the line 152, just after the GMaps constructor? I prefer to maintain the checking code because some people think GMaps already loads Google Maps API.\n. Sorry, I meant the code you are changing in the pull request. Instead of removing the checking and warning in gmaps.core.js, move to the linea 152 in the same file. That way, when someone tries to create a map, it will check if Google Maps is already loaded.\n. Thanks for the PR! It's merged now.\n. I checked the app and saw this in the Marker 14:\n\nApparently there are few markers overlapping others. I this case, the marker #14 and marker #22 (I also checked in the markers #6 and #20, occurring the same).\n. You can change the zIndex property.\n. Use marker.setZIndex(number). Is a different z-index from CSS, but the logic is the same.\n. Hi, thanks for your words! Maybe this weekend I will take a look to the documentation.\n. Hi, I found two bugs in your code:\nYou are using #map selector:\njs\n$(document).ready(function(){\n  map = new GMaps({\n    div: '#map',\n    lat: -12.043333,\n    lng: -77.028333\n  });\n});\nWhen you have a #map_canvas element:\nhtml\n<div id=\"map_canvas\"></div>\nAlso, you need to set a height for #map_canvas (that's mandatory for GMaps and Google Maps too). Check the jQuery UI documentation to see how to set a height in that element.\n. Not now, but any contribution is welcome :)\n. Have you tried with activate? The map needs to know the exact dimensions of its container before using refresh().\n. @olegmedvedev yes, that's exactly what I meant. map.refresh should be called after the accordion is activated, no before. Thanks!\n. Hi, sorry for the long delay. I'm intrigued with this bug, because the removeMarker function you commented isn't from gmaps but from the cluster, so it doesn't perform recursive calls. But clearly was a bad choice to call markerClusterer.removeMarker every time a marker is removed. I will change the markerClusterer.removeMarker to markerClusterer.clearMarkers and put it outside the for loop.\nThanks for your help!\n. It depends what kind of geofence do you have. It works when fence is an instance of google.maps.Polygon or google.maps.Circle. It doesn't work with google.maps.Rectangle but you can use this polyfill:\njavascript\ngoogle.maps.Rectangle.prototype.containsLatLng = function(latLng) {\n  return this.getBounds().contains(latLng);\n};\n. You can use the map.checkGeofence(lat, lng, fence) method. It will return true if the coordinate is inside the geofence, and false otherwise.\n. If you want a full customization you must use Overlays (http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/overlays.html).\n. That is an error for Cordova. Check your app's permissions.\n. You can use map.panBy(x_pixels, y_pixels).\n. Apparently is a new warning from Google Maps, but creating a Google Maps API Key is simple and free: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key\n. I think you can override the map styles and hide the Point of Interests and/or transit stations with StyledMapType. Check this demo: https://codepicnic.com/consoles/styled-maps \n. @kaydwithers it works now? anyway, the code is the following:\n``` javascript\nvar map = new GMaps({\nel: \"#map\",\nlat: 41.895465,\nlng: 12.482324,\nzoom: 15, \nzoomControl : true,\nzoomControlOpt: {\n  style : \"SMALL\",\n  position: \"TOP_LEFT\"\n},\npanControl : true,\nstreetViewControl : false,\nmapTypeControl: false,\noverviewMapControl: false\n});\nvar styles = [\n  {\n    stylers: [\n      { hue: \"#00ffe6\" },\n      { saturation: -20 }\n    ]\n  }, {\n      featureType: \"road\",\n      elementType: \"geometry\",\n      stylers: [\n          { lightness: 100 },\n          { visibility: \"simplified\" }\n    ]\n  }, {\n      featureType: \"road\",\n      elementType: \"labels\",\n      stylers: [\n          { visibility: \"off\" }\n    ]\n  }\n];\nmap.addStyle({\n  styledMapName:\"Styled Map\",\n  styles: styles,\n  mapTypeId: \"map_style\"\n});\nmap.setStyle(\"map_style\");\n``\n. I see, the only workaround available is turning off the POIs (and transit stations). I'm closing this for now, since is a Google Maps \"bug\".\n. Thanks! I added your tip in the [wiki](https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps/wiki/Tips)\n. Not sure, but it can be a bug in the site's css.\n. You can use [renderRoute`](https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps/blob/master/lib/gmaps.routes.js#L115):\njavascript\nmap.renderRoute({\n  origin: [myOriginLat, myOriginLng],\n  destination: [myDestinationLat, myDestinationLng],\n}, {}); // empty object is DirectionsRenderer's options.\nIt uses the same options as getRoutes.\n. Thanks, I'm working in a new documentation section, hopefully I'll finish this month.\n. Hi, sorry for the late reply. You can add an infowindow to each marker (or use a single infowindow and change its content if the infowindow will be shown once in the map at the same time). And use this code:\n``` javascript\nvar map = new GMaps(/.../);\nvar marker = map.addMarker(/.../);\nmarker.infoWindow.open(map.map, marker);\n``\n. It's probably a issue with Google Geocoding Service. Nothing I can do from here.\n. I think is a browser _issue_, nothing I can do from this side \ud83d\ude1e \n. Google moved their code to GitHub: https://github.com/googlemaps/js-marker-clusterer.\nI'll update the site with the new link, thanks!\n. I guess you can manipulate the styles for theelproperty in the object returned bymap.drawOverlay(...)(or located inmap.overlays)\n. If it's a polygon you try to draw, use theuseGeoJSONproperty. GMaps doesn't support geoJSON formatting (which is [longitude, latitude] instead [latitude, longitude]) right now.\n. Not really. You must create your own labels with [drawOverlay](http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/overlays.html).\n. Cool, thanks! I'll add on the next version.\n. Hi, check this example: https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps/blob/master/examples/styled_maps.html\n. Hi, I think you're asking about geocoding? Check [this example](https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps/blob/master/examples/geocoding.html) and just changeaddressfor any of the parameters [passed here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#GeocoderRequest)\n. Could you provide me a demo to debug? I tried in the [homepage's map](http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/) and didn't see any change.setZoomcalls the nativesetZoommethod from thegoogle.maps.Mapinstance.\n. Hi, usesetRadius()`:\njavascript\nvar circle = map.drawCircle(...);\ncircle.setRadius(x);\n. I checked and seems to be an issue with the Node version and the grunt-contrib-jasmine package. I fixed bug after bug related to mismatched versions and it seems to work fine now (0.4.25).. Tienes raz\u00f3n, esas 2 funciones no dependen de un mapa para funcionar. Las cambi\u00e9 a est\u00e1ticas y se pueden usar como mencionas:\nhttp://hpneo.github.com/gmaps/examples/geolocation.html\nhttp://hpneo.github.com/gmaps/examples/geocoding.html\n. Tienes raz\u00f3n en lo que mencionas, sin embargo, el objetivo de pasarle un par\u00e1metro a la funci\u00f3n del evento es poder manejar el marcador dentro de gmaps (dentro de map.addMarker puedes definir los eventos que tendr\u00e1 el marcador y ah\u00ed  this hace referencia al mapa).\nVoy a revisar el c\u00f3digo que mencionas, lo primero que se me ocurre es validar que exista el argumento, o usar google.maps.event.trigger(map.markers[0], 'click', {}).\n. (Reci\u00e9n contesto XD) Tienes raz\u00f3n, corregido.\n. Me gusta la idea de los tests, es uno de los temas que faltan implementar a la biblioteca. Creo que podemos coordinar una tarde/noche para revisarlo.\n. Me gusta -\n. u_u\n. BTW, acabo de ver que en la documentaci\u00f3n de Static Maps han agregado un par\u00e1metro scale (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/#scale_values) para mapas en alta resoluci\u00f3n (tipo pantallas retina). Lo agrego al rato, creo.\n. Hi, gmaps.js has MIT license.\n. #exito\n. Hi, I think you're using Google Maps API version 2, which gmaps.js doesn't support. Also, the gmaps' constructor is \"GMaps\", not \"GMap\".\n. Hi, you can customize marker icons in \"addMarker\" method using the \"icon\" option (you can use all the options of google.maps.MarkerOptions: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#MarkerOptions)\n. Not yet, but I have plans to add marker clustering as soon as I can. Although, you can use a marker clustering library with gmaps.js. You only need access to the map markers, using the \"markers\" property of your GMaps instance.\n. Check the last version (0.2.19) :)\n. Hi, I tried the demos in Firefox 12.0 in Windows 7 and Ubuntu and work well. Could you please give me more information?\nThanks.\n. I've posted a response in Issue #18: https://github.com/HPNeo/gmaps/issues/18#issuecomment-6082504\nIt would be great to expand the library using other map providers.\n. I'm going to study the Open Layers API and others map services to see if it's possible to implement wrappers for these services.\nNevertheless, I've thought of requesting a permission from Google.\n. Hi, I've added this method in the last release. Thanks for the feedback.\n. I added two new methods: fitBounds and fitZoom. The first one fits the zoom according to a collection of LatLng objects, and fitZoom fits the zoom according all markers in the map.\n. Hi. This is a feature that I will be adding in next releases.\n. Hi. I added this feature in the last version. You can check an example here: https://github.com/HPNeo/gmaps/blob/master/examples/overlay_map_types.html#L14\n. I uploaded an example to see the code in action: http://hpneo.github.com/gmaps/examples/overlay_map_types.html\n. Now you can use all native methods directly from GMaps object.\n. Hi, you can use \"map\" attribute to access the native google.maps.Map object.\n. Sure:\n``` javascript\nvar map = new GMaps({\n  lat: -12.033,\n  lng: -77.11,\n  div: '#map'\n});\n//yourcode\nmap.map.setMapTypeId('satellite');\n``\n. Hi, I added support to GeoJSON in drawPolygon and uploaded an example: http://hpneo.github.com/gmaps/examples/geojson_polygon.html\n. gmaps.js is non-framework dependent since 0.2 version.\n. Hi, you can usemarker.click(marker)to trigger the marker's click event.\n. That's the right way, it shouldn't throw any error. I'm gonna check this bug.\n. You can usemap.removeMarkers()to remove all markers.\n. You can use all google.maps.MapOptions parameters in GMaps constructor. In this case you can usescrollwheel: false. Hi, you can use thewaypoints` option (read more here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#DirectionsRequest and here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#DirectionsWaypoint)\n. Not yet, but the format would be:\nmap.getRoutes({\n...,\n  waypoints: [{\n    location: new google.maps.LatLng(lat_number, lng_number),\n    stopover: false\n  },{\n    location: new google.maps.LatLng(another_lat_number, another_lng_number),\n    stopover: false\n  }]\n});\n. Please post a fiddle (http://jsfiddle.net/) with your code.\n. Hi, you can use getRoutes method this way:\njavascript\nmap.getRoutes({\n  origin: [origin.lat(), origin.lng()],\n  destination: [destination.lat(), destination.lng()],\n  travelMode: 'driving',\n  callback: function(e){\n    routes = e;\n    alert(routes[0].legs[0].distance.value);\n  }\n});\n. Could you please show a screenshot of this?\n. Upload the screenshot in any image service (i.e.: http://imgur.com/) and post the direct link here.\n. Try using refresh method.\n. Hi, check this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Lk4gx/13/\nIn this case, you need to trigger the resize event of Map object every time you build it. GMaps has a method called refresh that triggers the resize event, but you need to call it when your map is loaded.\n. You're using wrong the setCenter method. You must pass latitude and longitude separately:\njavascript\nvar map;      \n$('#myModal').on('show', function () {\n    map = new GMaps({\n        div: '#map_canvas',\n        lat: 32.048820,\n        lng: 118.797733,\n        width: 'auto',\n        height: '300px',\n        idle: function(){\n            map.refresh();\n        },\n        resize: function(){\n            var center = map.getCenter();\n            map.setCenter(center.lat(), center.lng());\n        }\n  });\n});\n. Hi, try with this instead. I'll check this issue.\n. nop\n. Fixed in 0.2.6 version\n. For now:\njavascript\nmarker  = map.addMarker({...});\nmarker.setMap(null);\n. It would be possible to adapt your pull request with the new version?\n. Please post some screenshots.\n. Upload the screenshot in any image service (i.e.: http://imgur.com/) and post the direct link here.\nAlso, check this example: http://jsfiddle.net/Lk4gx/13/\n. Try this: https://github.com/HPNeo/gmaps/issues/53\n. Yes, in addMarker method add icon: \"https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/images/beachflag.png\".\n. Sorry about that. The last commit had a bug and now it's fixed. Thanks for the alert.\n. I don't see the advantage of this feature instead using icon property of addMarker method. I think icon is more flexible.\n. I didn't implement removeRoute, but you can do something like:\n``` javascript\nvar drawnRoute;\nmap.drawRoute({\n  ...,\n  callback: function() {\n    drawnRoute = map.polylines[map.polylines.length - 1];\n  }\n});\n```\nAnd remove it with:\njavascript\nmap.removePolyline(drawnRoute);\n. Use mapType: 'hybrid' in the constructor or map.map.setMapTypeId('hybrid')\n. Yes, map.removeMarkers()\n. I think the marker animation should be available on more than just one event (i.e.: 'drop' when is created and 'bounce' after is dropped).\n. I think the animation should be detached from the marker constructor. I really don't see the difference between:\njavascript\nmap.addMarker({\n  dropAnimation: 'drop',\n  animation: {\n    style: 'bounce',\n    event: 'click'\n  }\n});\nand\njavascript\nmap.addMarker({\n  animation: 'drop',\n  click: function(marker){\n    marker.setAnimation('bounce');\n  }\n});\nAlso, in the last example I can add any other event, like:\njavascript\nmap.addMarker({\n  animation: 'drop',\n  click: function(marker){\n    marker.setAnimation('bounce');\n  },\n  mouseout: function(marker){\n    marker.setAnimation('drop');\n  }\n});\nBut, your feature makes me think in a new object which can manage complex animations using Projections (i.e.: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10178789/reverse-animation-for-google-map-marker-removal).\nWhat do you think?\n. This feature isn't approved yet\n. Because a google.maps.Map object is attached to a one container: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#Map\n. Please, post your code.\nEDIT: Check if you set streetViewControl option in the constructor. By default is true.\n. Hi, it's fixed now.\nEDIT: You can pass any native option from google.maps.Map constructor in the GMaps constructor.\n. Hi, I can't see the link. You can use the drawCircle method (https://github.com/HPNeo/gmaps/blob/master/gmaps.js#L554). I'm working on the documentation.\n. Well, you can use getRoutes as reference. and you could use the service this way:\n``` javascript\nvar locations = [];\nmap.getElevations({\n  locations: locations,\n  callback: function(results, status){\n    console.log(results);\n  }\n})\n```\nThanks for the contribution!\n. You can use createControl and getRoutes.\n. You can see it in the examples: http://hpneo.github.com/gmaps/examples/routes_advanced.html and http://hpneo.github.com/gmaps/examples/travel_route.html (click in the map to get an origin and destination)\n. Could you please add an example file?\n. I need an example file in the commit (like /examples/static.html, /examples/static_markers.html and /examples/static_polylines.html) to merge this pull request.\n. Hi, I'm using your configuration and it works here:\njavascript\n  map = new GMaps({\n        div: '#map',\n        lat: -12.043333,\n        lng: -77.028333,\n        height: '100px',\n        zoomControl : true,\n        zoomControlOptions: {\n            style: google.maps.ZoomControlStyle.SMALL,\n            position: google.maps.ControlPosition.TOP_LEFT\n        },\n        scrollwheel: false,\n        panControl: false,\n        mapTypeControl: false,\n        scaleControl: false,\n        streetViewControl: true,\n        mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP\n      });\n\nFor the infoWindow bug, check if you have defined a box-sizing property defined for div tag in your CSS.\n. Use initial value in box-sizing\n. Hi, use map: map.map to access the native google.maps.Map object.\n. Not yet. But, you can try any marker clustering library using markers property to access all the markers created in the map.\n. I added a markerClusterer option in the GMaps constructor, so you can use this way:\njavascript\n  map = new GMaps({\n    div: '#map',\n    lat: -12.043333,\n    lng: -77.028333,\n    markerClusterer: function(map) {\n      return new MarkerClusterer(map);\n    }\n  });\nWhen you add a marker, the marker clusterer will update automatically the map's viewport.\nNOTE: You need to import the marker clusterer library.\n. Hi, the cluster icons are defined in the MarkerClusterer constructor, as you can see in the source code of this example: http://google-maps-utility-library-v3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/markerclusterer/examples/advanced_example.html\nThe addMarker defined in a custom library doesn't create the cluster icons, just adds the marker in its internal array of markers, which it will use to calculate the clusterers.\n. Just replace the default instance with MarkerClusterer(map, [], options).\nBy default, MarkerClusterer set its markers array with [], so it should be the same.\n. Hi, could you please add an example file (like /examples/static.html, /examples/static_markers.html, /examples/static_polylines.html, /examples/elevation_locations.html and /examples/elevation_routes.html)?\n. Hi, this is great, could you please create a pull request with this code? You must fork the repository, pull the files, add this code in the file gmaps.js, push your changes and create the pull request.\n. Hi, you can use the zIndex option in addMarker\n. Hi, the only parameter for infoWindow is content, where you can put any HTML you need. You can create custom \"infoWindows\" with Overlays (using drawOverlay)\n. Yes, you're right. Check the Google Maps API reference page for more information. I will update the documentation with the infoWindow events.\n. Use icon option in addMarker. Also, check this: https://developers.google.com/chart/image/docs/gallery/dynamic_icons#pins\n. Please post your code.\n. Check this fiddle. I use your code and it seems to work fine http://jsfiddle.net/HPNeo/N7Vvv/\n. I can't replicate the bug. This error is caused because gmaps can't find the container div of the map, and it hasn't thrown in the link above.\n. Use icon: \"path/to/image.gif\" in the addMarker method\n. Set mapType: 'satellite' option in the GMaps constructor.\n. Sure, I need to update the documentation someday soon...\n. How about enable/disable these layers? Maybe with addLayer/removeLayer.\n. Also, could you please add the documentation in the gh-pages branch (documentation.html file)?\n. Please, exclude the Fusion Tables and KML layers. Google Maps API allows to add many FT and KML layers, unlike Bicycling, Traffic, Transit and others.\n. Could you please add an example file?\n. I can't see the search method in https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#PlacesService.\nAlso, I think you must create the TextSearchRequest and PlaceSearchRequest objects in addLayer and pass the options to them, since the goal of gmaps is passing only the necessary attributes in its methods.\n. Yes, I just noticed it. Excuse the delay. I'm gonna merge this pull request, but I'd like to know if you can detail a little more the addLayer method in the documentation. For each case, I'd like to see which are the options available.\n. I think you should add the optional parameters in addLayer, like nearbySearch and textSearch.\n. Hi, options.options is an optional parameter, used by getCurrentPosition (like accuracy, timeout, etc.). So, if options.options isn't defined, getCurrentPosition uses its default values.\nFor more information: http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html\n. Sorry for the delay, GitHub didn't notify me when you pushed these changes. Great work!\n. Could you please add code and screenshot?\n. Hi, did you solve it?\n. Hi, Stamen Maps now has a custom MapType for Google Maps, so you could use this way:\n``` javascript\n  gmaps = new GMaps({\n    lat: 37.7,\n    lng: -122.4,\n    mapTypeControlOptions: {\n      mapTypeIds: [\"toner\", \"watercolor\"]\n    }\n  });\ngmaps.map.mapTypes.set(\"toner\", new google.maps.StamenMapType(\"toner\"));\n  //or\n  //gmaps.map.mapTypes.set(\"watercolor\", new google.maps.StamenMapType(\"watercolor\"));\n```\n. Hi, which browser did you use?\nEDIT: Also, please post your code.\n. Hi, please post your code.\n. Hi, I fixed this bug.\n. You're right. I fixed this bug and tested it in markers.html\n. Please, post your code in http://jsfiddle.net/ to see what's going on. I can't reproduce these bugs.\n. I see you're doing this:\n``` javascript\nvar user = map.createMarker({\n    lat:position.coords.latitude,\n    lng:position.coords.longitude,\n    //icon:\"/interface-elements/user.png\",\n    title: 'User Location',\n    details:{\n        name:'userLocation'\n    },\n    infoWindow: {\n        content: 'This is you'\n    }\n});    \nmap.addMarker(user);\n```\nYou should use:\njavascript\nuser.setMap(map.map);\naddMarker uses internally the createMarker method, so that's would be the reason why is showing 2 infoWindows when you click the marker.\n. Instead.\nI updated the library to support native google.maps.Marker objects in addMarker, so you can still add markers created with createMarker (which makes sense, though).\n. There was a bug in the last version. Fixed.\n. Hi, you can toggle map controls using the setOptions method.\n. Done in the last version.\n. Hi, the last version does.\n. If oms is your GMaps object, try with map: oms.map\n. Hi, I updated the library with the removeMarker method.\n. Hi, I just added the icons option a couple of days ago.\n. Hi, I fixed this bug.\n. Yes. The goal of gmaps is provide a simplified interface for Google Maps API, so you can extend functionalities like that the way you prefer.\n. Hi, yes, you can set the content of an overlay as HTML.\n. Hi, please set layer in floatPane.\n. Sure ;)\n. HI, I tried your code in a fiddle and it's working OK http://jsfiddle.net/HPNeo/XmNjL/. Please post more information about your bug.\n. I added removePolygon and removePolyline methods, which works exactly like removeMarker. I'm gonna close this issue because I don't see any link with code replicating the bug(s) you mention.\nIf you want to discuss about a new features or bugs, please create a new issue. It will help to organize the requests.\n. Hi, the next weekend I will start to code some new features, including this.\n. The last version has support for Street View Panoramas. Check the tests for usage example.\n. Please post your code in a fiddle (http://jsfiddle.net/)\n. Maybe is your CSS. Check for global styles (like div or *)\n. Hi, the overlay width depends of your CSS.\n. I haven't, maybe you can use min-width or something like that.\n. Please, post a fiddle with your code.\n. You're trying to bind a click event to a <a> element which has not been created yet. Use $(document).on('click', '.teste', function(){}) instead\n. ;)\n. Please post your code in http://jsfiddle.net/\n. I think it's related to: https://github.com/HPNeo/gmaps/issues/34\n. Hi, you can use drawOverlay to create custom infoWindows, though there's not an example of this. You can use this example as an approach http://hpneo.github.com/gmaps/examples/overlays.html\n. You can draw/remove an overlay inside the marker events, which is basically the way that infoWindows work. Maybe I will post some examples this weekend.\n. Hi, I couldn't do anything this weekend, I'm pretty busy right now.\n. Hi, There are two methods removePolygon and removePolygons which delete a selected polygon, or the whole collection. About handling event listeners (add and remove), it's planned to next versions.\n. HI, use fitLatLngBounds instead fitBounds. fitZoom only works if you have markers added in your map.\n. Hi, I (re) added this feature. Apparently, it was deleted at some point. Check the example in https://github.com/HPNeo/gmaps/blob/master/examples/context_menu.html for reference.\n. You're welcome!\n. Hi. Use getCenter().lat() and getCenter().lng()\n. It seems fine to me. Maybe you can set the initial coordinates in $('#jform_latitude') and $('#jform_longitude').\n. The test suite has been merged to the master branch, so any new big feature must have at least a test. Any suggestion is allowed.\n. Hi, check this issue https://github.com/HPNeo/gmaps/issues/44\n. Hi, the style attribute isn't supported in GMaps constructor. Try with:\njavascript\nmap = new GMaps({\n  div: '#map',\n  lat: '<?php echo $this->item->map[\"latitude\"]; ?>',\n  lng: '<?php echo $this->item->map[\"longitude\"]; ?>',\n  zoom: <?php echo $this->item->map['zoom']; ?>,\n  height: '300px',\n  width: '100%'\n});\nHave you define a CSS rule for #map with width and height?\n. Use map.refresh() in the shown event of Bootstrap Tabs.\n. Hi, thanks for the submission! I added a tag for the last version, which is 0.2.30. I will add tags for each upcoming versions.\nThanks for the suggestion.\n. Hi. gmaps has GMaps.geocode, which returns, in a callback, an array of google.maps.GeocoderResult objects. You can read the reference of this object specification or check an example using gmaps.\nIn the callback you can fill your inputs with the first result of geocode. Also, you can use jQuery UI Autocomplete with external source, just like this:\n``` javascript\n  $(input).autocomplete({\n    source: function(request, response) {\n      GMaps.geocode({\n        address: request.term,\n        callback: function(result, status) {\n          if (status == 'OK') {\n            mapped_results = $.map(result, function(geocoder_result) {\n              return {\n                label: place.formatted_address,\n                value: place.formatted_address,\n                object: geocoder_result\n              };\n            });\n          }\n          else {\n            mapped_results = []\n          }\n          response(mapped_results);\n        }\n      });\n    },\n    select: function(event, ui) {\n      $(input).val(ui.item.value);\n  location = ui.item.object.geometry.location;\n  fill_inputs_with_location(location);\n}\n\n});\n``\n. I can't understand you very well. The callback option ingeocodewill fire when the request has been completed, and  you can use theresultsargument inside the callback to iterate over the results that Google returns.\n. Hi, it appears to be a bug in IE when calculating the dimensions of the map container. I will check that.\n. Yes, if you want to force the width and height of the map container, just setwidthandheight. Merged, thanks!\n. Hi, just changemaptomap.map`:\njavascript\ngoogle.maps.event.addListener(map.map, 'bounds_changed', removeMarkers);\n. Yes, just pass an array of markers in removeMarkers\n. No, sorry. Google Places is beyond the scope of gmaps.\n. I'm working on more examples on the weekend. If you have more suggestions for examples please post them here.\n. I've recreated the Angular UI example, with jQuery and gmaps.js: http://hpneo.github.com/gmaps/examples/interacting.html\nI will post more examples later or tomorrow.\n. Hi, I added the code in the example page.\n. I've done another example using data from Foursquare: http://hpneo.github.com/gmaps/examples/json.html\nThe example uses CoffeeMaker\n. In the last version of gmaps.js, I've added support for events:\njavascript\nGmaps.on(event_name, object, handler);\nYou can check the specs for Events to learn more about using events in gmaps.js\nmap is a GMaps object property which references to the native google.maps.Map object.\n. That's right. gmaps.js is not a jQuery plugin. It's a library for working with Google Maps in an easy way, using a syntax similar to jQuery (mostly because jQuery is the most used JavaScript library). It borrows some terms from jQuery (like on) because thanks of jQuery, these terms have become de facto standards.\nIn the examples I use jQuery because simplifies me a lot the work I have to do for selecting or binding events to DOM elements.\n. No. Gmaps.js is framework agnostic since 0.2 version\n. Sorry about that. I'm noob in git tags and I didn't know that \"0.3\" were an invalid version number.\nI've updated gmaps.js to the 0.3.1 version, and added the respectively git tag too.\n. Hi, do you have any general CSS rule using box-sizing? Also, you can check this issue: https://github.com/HPNeo/gmaps/issues/44 for more information.\n. Hi, you can check this example: http://hpneo.github.com/gmaps/examples/fusion_tables.html. loadFromFusionTables returns a google.maps.FusionTablesLayer object, which has a setOptions method, where you can set a query (read more here https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#FusionTablesLayer)\n. Hi, I've added a fix to this bug, thanks for notice.\nAbout your code, I think you must add the Fusion Tables layer once and then change the query in changeSelection\n. Hi, use the draggable option in addMarker\n. Check  #44 \n. Fixed.\n. I will check this issue this weekend.\n. Fixed in v0.4.5\n. Hi, you can store a marker in a variable and update its position with setPosition method (from google.maps.Marker)\n. For now, the context menu is available for one map.\n. Yes, maybe later or tomorrow I will update this feature.\n. Hi, i added the support for context menu in multiple maps: @9c1a4a94a5afe5ca88532eb1a9071feab9cdd81e\n. Hi, e is an array of google.maps.DirectionsRoute\n. As far as I know, is just the style.\n. Fixed in @01cc98166ddaff26acf0fafc70e2c8e6535729fb\n. Hi, this is fixed now in v0.4.3\n. Yes, you should iterate through your list of addresses this way:\njavascript\nfor (var i = 0; i < addresses.length; i++) {\n  var address = addresses[i];\n  GMaps.geocode({\n    address: address,\n    callback: function(results, status) {\n      if (status == 'OK') {\n        var latlng = results[0].geometry.location;\n        map.addMarker({\n          lat: latlng.lat(),\n          lng: latlng.lng()\n        });\n      }\n    }\n  });\n}\n. Fixed in 0.4.4\n. Hi, I can't reproduce this bug in the markers example page. Could you please post the error message? In that page I'm using the latest version of Google Maps API (3.13)\n. Hi, I don't understand your issue. In the documentation about Geocoding there's no example like the one you posted above.\nIn gmaps you can use geocoding with the same options as defined in google.maps.GeocoderRequest.\n. I think you can use the region option, or append the city code + country code at the end of the address:\nstadium, NY, US\n. HI, could you please post your code in jsfiddle? I've checked the method in http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/ and http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/markers.html and it works fine.\n. Good idea. I will check this for the next version.\n. Hi. Thanks for this! I have one requirement for merge this pull request: Could you please re-add the jasmine test file? I would like to check the tests without using Grunt.\n. Done!\n. Of course. Any contribution is welcomed.\n. You only need to create the polygon once and update the path with setPath.\n. Please check map.markers in your Chrome console after you added a marker manually. It should return an array with 1 marker.\nAre you using Twitter Bootstrap or any other CSS framework? Check this link: https://github.com/HPNeo/gmaps/issues/44\n. Hi, could you please post your code in a fiddle in jsfiddle.net?\n. Hi, the marker is added correctly. Zoom out to see it.\n. Hi, could you please post your code in a fiddle in jsfiddle.net? I don't use Twitter Bootstrap.\n. That's great! In A small guide about contributing you can see some style directives.\nThanks for contributing :+1: \n. Hi, could you please post your code in a fiddle in jsfiddle.net? It works fine here: http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/map_types.html (try typing in the Chrome console: map.map.setMapTypeId('cloudmade'); or map.map.setMapTypeId('osm');)\n. Hi, I've checked three items of the list that could improve the code quality:\ncurly - This option requires you to always put curly braces around blocks in loops and conditionals. JavaScript allows you to omit curly braces when the block consists of only one statement\neqeqeq - This options prohibits the use of == and != in favor of === and !==.\nnewcap - This option requires you to capitalize names of constructor functions. Capitalizing functions that are intended to be used with new operator is just a convention that helps programmers to visually distinguish constructor functions from other types of functions to help spot mistakes when using this.\ncurly and newcap are already used, but eqeqeq isn't.\n. Perfect.\n. Hi, sorry for the delay. I agree with you about the naming conventions. In the future I will standarize it in some way. I think gmaps currently supports the strict mode. indent definitely is a must (unless it requires an enormous effort) and shadow should be false IMHO.\nI will check your repository as soon as I get some free time.\n. I don't see this bug in http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/new_style.html\n. Oh, okay. You should change the default map style instead of creating a new styled map type, using map.setOptions({styles: new_styles}), where new_styles should be the value in map.map.mapTypes.map_style.styles\n. Hola, en el fiddle que pones no veo c\u00f3mo se puede reproducir el error. Anteriormente he visto implementaciones de mapas dentro de ventanas modales y no ha pasado esto. Si es posible que puedas dar m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n y un fiddle actualizado para resolver tu pregunta ser\u00eda mejor.\n. El fiddle sigue sin mostrar un mapa dentro de una ventana de di\u00e1logo. Si tienes un ejemplo ya implementado puedes poner el enlace.\n. Prueba ejecutando el m\u00e9todo refresh(). En teor\u00eda deber\u00eda cambiar de tama\u00f1o autom\u00e1ticamente pero en este caso no parece funcionar.\n. You can map all the coordinates of your route and use fitLatLngBounds. Each coordinate must be a google.maps.LatLng object\n. Hi, I've just tried your code and doesn't work.\n. Hi, could you post a fiddle with an example?\n. I think you need to use getRoutes. Check the code of this example: http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/travel_route.html or read the documentation: http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/documentation.html#GMaps-getRoutes\n. I don't understand your question. I assume Clusterer is a custom class?\n. This is not a question about gmaps. You probably need to check some examples about event listening in MarkerClusterer.\n. Yes, gmaps is a library that goes above the Google Maps API library, and provides accessors for native Google Maps objects such map, polygons and markers, so you can use google.maps.event.addListener.\n. I'm not sure if this feature should be in gmaps. Maybe I'll write an extension and store it in https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps.extensions.\n. Hi, I'm checking your code and I think it might fail in some cases. I will post some comments in your code, but first you need to apply your changes in lib/gmaps.markers.js since gmaps.js is a generated file.\n. Hi, you can attach a mouseover event to the map and change the icon property of any marker. Check http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/map_events.html for events and https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#Marker for markers.\nAny marker added to a map can be accessed with the markers property.\n. When you create a map using gmaps, you must do this way:\nvar map = new GMaps({\n  lat: latitude,\n  lng: longitude,\n  el: '#map-container'\n});\nThen, you can use map to add markers, and use map.map to access the Google Maps Map object.\n. You need to use getRoutes. Check the code of this example: http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/travel_route.html or read the documentation: http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/documentation.html#GMaps-getRoutes\n. Hi, thanks for contributing! could you please revert the changes in gmaps.js? This file is generated.\nAlso, it could be great if you create a new example file using this feature.\n. Hi, it's a great idea but I think there are other dependency managers that use this repo and remove gmaps.js will cause extra issues.\n. This bug has been fixed in the last version\n. I don't think it's possible, do you have any example?\n. You can use jQuery UI Autocomplete with Google Places service. I'm not sure if I should add this feature in gmaps or maybe in the extensions repo.\n. Hi, check the geolocation example: http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/geolocation.html. In success you can add a marker using position.coords.latitude and position.coords.longitude\n. Thanks!\n. Hi, check if you have an element with id map_canvas and if your initialize function is called after the DOM is ready.\n. I'm not sure but I think the source of the bug is here:\nhtml\n<div id=\"map-canvas\" class=\"glow\"><div/>\nIt should be\nhtml\n<div id=\"map-canvas\" class=\"glow\"></div>\n. Hi, you can use GMaps.geolocate and add a marker if the geolocation succeed.\n. Sorry for being out for so long. I fixed the bug in the tests so I will check this PR and merge if all is ok.\n. Fixed.\n. Hi, use removePolygon or removePolygons\n. Hi, I fixed this spec.\n. Hi, you have to define the width and height of #map\n. Hi, could you please post some code? I just tried jQuery 1.10.2 with GMaps 0.4.9 and works fine.\n. Hi, could you please post your code in jsfiddle? It works fine here: http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/markers.html\n. You can filter markers using https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps.extensions (check gmaps.markerFilter.js).\nAlso, GMaps supports Marker Clusterer (check examples/marker_clusterer.html in this repo). You will need to manually update the Clusterer to showing/hidding markers.\n. Hi, I'm sorry for not responding this issue before. I closed a lot of issues this weekend because they didn't have a reply in months (or in this case, in years), which I'm really really sorry.\nIf you still have this problem let me know so I can reopen it.. Added the info in the README, I don't know why I've seen this before :disappointed: \n. Please, post a fiddle with your code.\n. Please remove the protocol in gmaps.static.js.\n. You can remove markers with removeMarkers method, passing an array of google.maps.Marker objects.\n. Hi @albertojm, is markers_data an array of plain objects or an array of google.maps.Marker objects? It needs to be the latter one.\n. Disculpa, no veo la meta de este pull request.\n. I've run a quick test and it seems to be a bug when GMaps tries to calculate the container dimensions, due the doctype. You must set the width and height in pixels:\njavascript\nvar map = new GMaps({\n  div: \"#map\",\n  lat: -12.043333,\n  lng: -77.028333,\n  width: '400px',\n  height: '300px',\n});\n. Thanks for noticing this. It's fixed no in 0.4.19\n. Use refresh() method. Maybe your map container (defined with div or el property in the GMaps constructor) changes its dimensions after the map is initialized.\n. Please, post a fiddle with your code.\n. Hi, use refresh()\n. You need to use the refresh method after showing the modal, since the Google Maps map will be created before the modal is shown. When a HTML element is hidden (as your modal), the browser can't know its dimensions, so Google Maps. With map.refresh(), Google Maps redraws the map using the current dimensions of its container, which is visible now.\n. Please check this link: http://stackoverflow.com/a/7510891\n. Please check if you have global styles for imgand div.\n. Hi, please check this link: http://stackoverflow.com/a/18146563\n. Hi, have you tried: \njavascript\nvar map = new GMaps({\n  scrollwheel: false\n});\n. Is not the same as doing?:\njavascript\nmap.addMarker({\n  lat: -12.042,\n  lng: -77.028333,\n  title: 'Marker with InfoWindow',\n  infoWindow: {\n    content: '<p>HTML Content</p>'\n  },\n  mouseover: function(e) {\n    this.infoWindow.open(this.map, this);\n  }\n});\n. Please, put your changes in the file that corresponds. gmaps.js is built using the files stored in lib folder. You can create a new file if you like.\n. Please post a fiddle with your code if you still have this problem.\n. Thanks!\n. I added the repo URL in https://github.com/HPNeo/gmaps/wiki/Tips\n. Yes, please check http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/overlays.html and http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/documentation.html#GMaps-drawOverlay\n. Hi, thanks for noticing this bug. It's fixed now.\n. Thanks for noting it, it's fixed now.\n. options.scrollwheel is already accepted in the GMaps constructor, there's no need to define it explicitly. Also, GMaps.staticMapURL doesn't need a scrollwheel option since it generates an image.\n. Hi, you can set the API Key in the Google Maps API url (<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=true\"></script>)\n. I'm not sure if there's a way to fix that in Firefox, but for now add disableDoubleClickZoom: true in your map options.\n. Use the refresh method after the map container is visible.\n. Hi, apparently this feature is only available in Mobile API (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/map#indoor_maps), but if Google releases for the Web API I will add it in GMaps as soon as possible.\n. Hi, you need to refresh the map after showing the <div> container: http://jsfiddle.net/bDNbA/2/. Also, you don't need to create the map every time you want to show it.\n. Hi, according the Google Maps API v3 documentation, if you want an overlay to receive DOM events, it must been created in the overlayMouseTarget pane. By default, overlays are created in the overlayLayer pane. Check this link for more information: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#MapPanes\n. Please, post a fiddle with your code.\n. Hi, you need to set the waypoints this way: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/directions-waypoints?hl=es\n. Sorry for the delay, but you need to apply your changes in lib.\n. Please, post your fix in lib/gmaps.overlays.js. gmaps.js is a built file.\n. Hi, use thePoly.coordinatesinstead thePoly.\n. You can use fitZoom method for your first question. Maybe you can create a pull request implementing the fitBound improvement.\n. Hi, thanks! I've updated the documentation.\n. Hi, it's an interesting approach, maybe you can create a pull request implementing that.\n. Hi, I've had the same issue, and basically it's because there are some tests that require use of Google services (like routing) and it might be take a longer time than defined (3500 milliseconds in test/spec/RouteSpec.js).\n. Hi, check: https://github.com/HPNeo/gmaps/blob/master/examples/styled_maps.html\n. Hi, I'm so sorry for not seeing this post before. You can show an InfoWindow using this code:\n``` javascript\nvar infoWindow = new google.maps.InfoWindow({\n  content: 'you clicked a polyline'\n});\nmap.drawPolyline({\n  path: path,\n  strokeColor: '#131540',\n  strokeOpacity: 0.6,\n  strokeWeight: 6,\n  click: function(clickEvent) {\n    var position = clickEvent.latLng;\ninfoWindow.setPosition(position);\ninfoWindow.open(map.map);\n\n}\n});\n```\n. Hi, did you tried this:\njavascript\nmap = new GMaps({\n  div: '#map',\n  lat: -12.043333,\n  lng: -77.028333,\n  markerClusterer: function(map) {\n    return new MarkerClusterer(map, [], {\n      gridSize: 100\n    });\n  }\n});\nThat code works for me (I'm using http://google-maps-utility-library-v3.googlecode.com/svn/tags/markerclusterer/1.0/src/markerclusterer.js)\nThe markerClusterer option must be a function that returns a MarkerClusterer, so you can do:\n``` javascript\nmap = new GMaps({\n  div: '#map',\n  lat: -12.043333,\n  lng: -77.028333,\n  markerClusterer: function(map) {\n    var markerClusterer = new MarkerClusterer(map, [], {\n      gridSize: 100\n    });\n// according stackoverflow\nmarkerClusterer.onClickZoom = function() {\n  return multiChoice(markerCluster);\n};\nreturn markerClusterer;\n\n}\n});\n```\nAlso, the GMaps map has a property named markerClusterer, so you can use the marker cluster later.\n. Hi, I fixed that in the last version of gmaps :)\n. Hi, this event is triggered manually. Check the reference: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#Map\n. You need to set initial latitude and longitude.\n. Thanks!\n. Hi, you can use the GMaps.geocode method, using the address option.\n. @conor909 yes, sorry about that. I'm working on a better documentation.\n. I can't see the bug here. Did you tried to remove the jQuery reference in your HTML code?\n. Hi, this is the code for gmaps 0.4.15:\n``` javascript\nGMaps.prototype.removeMarker = function(marker) {\n  for (var i = 0; i < this.markers.length; i++) {\n    if (this.markers[i] === marker) {\n      this.markers[i].setMap(null);\n      this.markers.splice(i, 1);\n  if(this.markerClusterer) {\n    this.markerClusterer.removeMarker(marker);\n  }\n\n  GMaps.fire('marker_removed', marker, this);\n\n  break;\n}\n\n}\nreturn marker;\n};\n``\n. Could you post a fiddle with your code? I don't see the bug intoggleLayer`.\n. I found the bug. You need to replace:\njavascript\nfunction toggleLayer(layer, map) {\n  layer.setMap(layer.getMap() ? null : map);\n}\nwith\njavascript\nfunction toggleLayer(layer, map) {\n  layer.setMap(layer.getMap() ? null : map.map);\n}\nmap is a GMaps instance, map.map is the google.maps.Map object, and setLayer needs a google.maps.Map instance.\n. Hi, try this: https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps/issues/330#issuecomment-47184441\n. Could you please post your code here?\n. Hi, the line 22 is throw 'Google Maps API is required. Please register the following JavaScript library http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=true.'. \u00bfIt is true for you?\n. Did you enable the INTERNET permission in your Android project?\n. Please post a fiddle with your code. I tried with a custom code and works fine.\n. You can try map.refresh()\n. I don't know your code, but you need to call the refresh method of your GMaps instance after the tab has changed.\n. You need to use refresh() in tabcontent.js. Just after the tab is selected.\n. Sorry for the delay. The callback now passes a new array containing the requested routes only.\n. Hi,\nGMaps.geocode uses Google Geocoding API, so the results returned by this method are provided as is. Maybe you need to use another service more accurated.\n. What version are you using? check in the last build (0.4.16): https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps/blob/master/gmaps.js#L668\n. Hi, you need to use removePolyline, passing a polyline object as parameter. You can access the map's polylines with map.polylines property.\n. Hi, I've re-created one of those examples here: http://codepicnic.com/bites/map-types.\nAs you can see, it doesn't use jQuery.\n. As far as I know, you only need to add the protocol (like http: or https:) to the URLs.\n. Hi, check this: https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps/issues/46\n. Hi, you only can set the max-width for infoWindows: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#InfoWindowOptions\nIf you need a custom InfoWindow you may use overlays: http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/overlays.html\n. Hi, please try replacing latlong['B'] with latlong.lat() and latlong['k'] with latlong.lng().\n. Yes. You must use lat and lng methods, not k or D.\n. Hi, you can pass the HTML element instead a string selector:\njavascript\n$(\".google_map\").each(function(index, element) {\n  var map = new GMaps({\n    el: element\n  });\n  // ...\n}\n. What if I have more than one map in one page?\n. Uhm, ok. But, please, put your method in gmaps.core.js. gmaps.js is just a bundle.\n. Hi, check this demo: https://codepicnic.com/consoles/gmaps-js-overlappingmarkerspiderfier\n. @calvinmetcalf is the owner of the NPM package. I'm not sure if I can submit updates too.\n. https://www.npmjs.com/~hpneo\n. Thanks!\n. The current version now is 0.4.17, and I will publish new versions in NPM. Also, I would like to know what you think about this: https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps/issues/404\n. I've revert your pull request because your change breaks GMaps.prototype.createPanorama. If you think this approach is better or very different to the current implementation, please create another method.\n. I think you need to create another method, like GMaps.prototype.createPanoramaByLocation and pass callbacks for success / error, like in GMaps.prototype.getRoutes.\n. Hi, could you provide me the link from the Maps API page?\n. Hi, I added this feature in the 0.4.22 version. Check a demo here: https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps/blob/master/examples/render_directions.html\nSorry for the delay :disappointed: \n. Please move this function to gmaps.core.js. gmaps.js is just a autogenerated bundle.\n. I've moved 9 modules to NPM so far:\n- https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps.core (https://www.npmjs.com/package/gmaps.core)\n- https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps.controls (https://www.npmjs.com/package/gmaps.controls)\n- https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps.events (https://www.npmjs.com/package/gmaps.events)\n- https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps.geofences (https://www.npmjs.com/package/gmaps.geofences)\n- https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps.geometry (https://www.npmjs.com/package/gmaps.geometry)\n- https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps.layers (https://www.npmjs.com/package/gmaps.layers)\n- https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps.map_types (https://www.npmjs.com/package/gmaps.map_types)\n- https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps.markers (https://www.npmjs.com/package/gmaps.markers)\n- https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps.overlays (https://www.npmjs.com/package/gmaps.overlays)\nWhen I finish to move all the modules I will remove the lib from this repo and create bundles with all of these modules.\n. I'm so sorry, I've been really busy with my daytime job I'm not sure if I can make it.\nThere is already a bunch of gmaps modules on NPM but they're behind the gmaps master branch, so besides of finishing the split now I have to update the already created packages, and it's a lot of work I can't do right now.\nI hope I can make some time for this but I can't assure you.. Please move your code to gmaps.core.js. gmaps.js is a generated file.\n. Could you please post a demo with your code? Or the error log from the Dev Tools (or Firebug)\n. I pushed a new version that might fix this bug. Please tell me if it works.\n. Cool, thanks for the bug report\n. You can track the click event of the markers (check this example: http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/markers.html). You need to read about the Google Analytics JS API.\nAbout mailto links, you could be same as the markers, but adding an id attribute to the mailto link and using jQuery to capture the click event for that id.\n. I'm not sure what you mean. Right now you can attach an infoWindow to a marker using the infoWindow option in addMarker(), but only accepts the google.maps.InfoWindow properties.\n. You need to update manually the content of the InfoWindow in the click event (or any other place). I think you can use e.infoWindow.setContent(\"your new content\").\n. You're welcome!\n. You can use the tilesloaded event.\n. Hi, can you please move your changes from gmaps.js to gmaps.core.js? gmaps.js is just a file generated on each new version.\n. Right, sorry about that.\n. Please post your code. I didn't tried the Places library but I did load other libraries (like geometry), so it should work fine.\n. I found the bug. When you use PlacesService you need to pass the google.maps.Map instance (map.map), not the GMaps instance (map): https://codepicnic.com/bites/gmaps-js-issue-414\n. Check this example: http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/custom_controls.html\n. You can create a infoWindow for each one of your markers, and store that data in the details property of addMarker:\njavascript\nmap.addMarker({\n  lat: latitude,\n  lng: longitude,\n  details: {\n    imagePath: point.imagePath,\n    title: point.title,\n    description: point.description\n  },\n  infoWindow: {\n    content: '<h2>' + point.title + '</h2><p>' + point.description + '</p>'\n  }\n})\n. Duplicated of #418\n. Fixed in #422\n. I'm not familiar with the drawing tools but you can check if a marker is inside or outside using the method checkGeofence(latitude, longitude, polygon_circle_or_rectangle). It returns true if the point is inside, and false if not.\nYou can check for alerts using position_changed event in markers. For now, you need to do this for every marker in your map.\n. I didn't maintain that repo. I will update it in the next days, maybe the next week. So sorry, I'm really busy right now :disappointed: \n. Thank you @kevin-brown! You saved the day one more time :smiley: \n. Right, thanks @kevin-brown :)\n. Fixed, thanks @kevin-brown !\n. I don't understand what you're trying to do, but I think changing the strokeWeight or strokeOpacity to 0 should work.\n. Thanks! And sorry for the delay!\n. Thanks @amenadiel for this amazing explanation.\n. Currently there's no way to filter markers in gmaps. You can use this code: https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps.extensions/blob/master/lib/gmaps.markerFilter.js (in alpha) to extend GMaps and use it this way:\nmap.markerFilter(function() {\n  return this.category_id === 7;\n});\n. Check this example: http://jsfiddle.net/9ym3htwq/\n. You're welcome, I'm gonna add this issue to the Tips page.\n. Apparently, the weather layer was deprecated a month ago: http://googlegeodevelopers.blogspot.com/2014/06/sunsetting-javascript-api-weather-panoramio.html\n. Honestly I can't remember why I put that code, but I've never heard complains about it. When you create a map, you need to set a width and height to that map container (located in this.el). You can do it using CSS (as you can see in the \"examples\" folder), or you can set it in the GMapsconstructor.\nCan you post more info about your issue, like how you create a map or the container's CSS?\n. I will run tests in some browsers and check if those lines are unnecessary.\n. It seems to be \"impossible\" according this comment:\n\nHi to all,\nHave just had a comment from Google via a Maps-For-Work request for this feature:\n\"I am sorry to tell you that given the current backend, there is no plan to implement this feature.\"\nI guess we'll have to wait for them to update the backend then...\n\nHowever, you can do several requests, according this post in SO\n. Hi, I'm working on a modularized version of gmaps (check #404), so I will put this feature in gmaps.routes. Thanks for the feedback!\n. Hi, can you post your code in jsfiddle?\n. For now I can't be done the way you want, but you can wrap your content and add a class or id and use it to append events (using jQuery or plain DOM).\n. I just saw there's a click callback in drawOverlay, I've updated your fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/qdcmrnta/1/\n. Yes, you can use it like this: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/layer-heatmap, and change this line:\nheatmap.setMap(map);\nwith:\nheatmap.setMap(map.map);\nWhen map is a GMaps instance.\n. I guess you can draw polygons and attach click events to them, so when you click on a polygon, an info window shows.\n. I don't understand your question. You mean, when you click on a park or a building? You can use the Google Places API to get those data.\n. I don't think it's possible in Google Maps itself. Check these posts in Stack Overflow:\n- How to get a click event when a user clicks a (business) place on the map\n- Disable click behavior of POI markers in Google Maps v3.6\n. You can save the position (options.lat and options.lng) in the overlay object and then filter the map.overlays property to find the overlay that matches the requested position, and use removeOverlay to remove it. I'm always open to contributions, as long as you don't break backwards compatibility.\n. Have you tried to listen to the Polygon events and check if the editable property is true?\n. GMaps is exposed as global variable (window.GMaps), but I don't have a demo using RequireJS so I don't know if the file gmaps.js works fine. If you provide me one I can debug it.\n. I can't help you without see a demo of the bug. Has your map been created without throwing errors? Do your map's div contain other divs (check the screenshot)? Did the map's div have width and height?\n\n. Fixed in the 0.4.20 version\n. Can you post the entire code? The map initialization and the use of fitZoom.\n. I don't find any error in your code, maybe try putting that fitZoom inside a setTimeout with 0.\n. I can't reproduce the bug, please post a demo (you can use jsFiddle, codepen or any other web to do that).\n. Please put your code in jsfiddle or CodePen, but it might be what @sillassoares says.\n. To remove a circle you need to call removePolygon, passing the circle created with drawCircle.\n. Cool! I didn't know that. I'm closing this now.\n. I've tried in http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/ with 150, 150, and the map doesn't render any location. It seems to be a bug from Google Maps, since I've replicated the bug using Google Maps API:\njs\n// mapa.map.map is the reference to the original Google Maps Map object:\nmapa.map.map.panTo(new google.maps.LatLng(150, 150));\nOr check here: http://www.findlatitudeandlongitude.com/?lat=150&lon=150&zoom=7&map_type=G_NORMAL_MAP#.Vk6sR98veRt\n. I always use the latest version (without ?v=xxx). Maybe you need to use an earlier version?\n. Please post your code in jsfiddle.net, codepen or similars\n. I don't know if I understand correctly, but that set of coordinates can be your origin and destination. Also, you can use that coordinates as waypoints (you must use the waypoints property in travelRoute).\n. Thanks!\n. @hongz1 is right, this warning is solved by adding the Google Maps library in the proper way. I will update the GitHub Page to remove the sensor parameter from the demos.\n. Hi, it's related to remove custom controls:  https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps/blob/0.4.13/lib/gmaps.controls.js#L53 (like this: http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/custom_controls.html)\n. You can use GMaps.on:\njs\nGMaps.on('click', marker, function() {\n  $('#myModal').modal('show');\n});\n. For the moment there isn't a function to watch location. GMaps.geolocate uses navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition, so you can replace it with navigator.geolocation.watchPosition and use almost the same code.\n. It should work with el or div, and #map must have a width and height. Please post a demo with your code (you can use jsfiddle.net).\n. Try this:\n``` js\nvar filtered = map.markerFilter(function() { return this === 3; });\nfor (var index = 0; index < filtered.length; index++) {\n  filtered[index].setVisible(false);\n}\n``\n. Please post a demo with your code.\n. I've found the bug, inmarkerFilterI useddetailinstead ofdetails`. It's fixed now: https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps.extensions/blob/master/lib/gmaps.markerFilter.js\nAlso, compare this with $num using two equals, because $num is a number, and details is a string.\nCheck this demo: https://jsfiddle.net/Lbc99v16/\n. \u00bfTe sigue sin funcionar?\n. S\u00ed, lo pondr\u00e9 en el repo de gmaps.extensions. Gracias a ti por ayudarme a descubrir este bug.\n. Creo que podr\u00edas usar lodash para manejar colecciones. Ahora mismo no se me ocurre otra forma.\n. Hi, you can do the same, but changing infoWindow.open(map) to infoWindow.open(map.map)\n. Have you tried to move that code to the line 152, just after the GMaps constructor? I prefer to maintain the checking code because some people think GMaps already loads Google Maps API.\n. Sorry, I meant the code you are changing in the pull request. Instead of removing the checking and warning in gmaps.core.js, move to the linea 152 in the same file. That way, when someone tries to create a map, it will check if Google Maps is already loaded.\n. Thanks for the PR! It's merged now.\n. I checked the app and saw this in the Marker 14:\n\nApparently there are few markers overlapping others. I this case, the marker #14 and marker #22 (I also checked in the markers #6 and #20, occurring the same).\n. You can change the zIndex property.\n. Use marker.setZIndex(number). Is a different z-index from CSS, but the logic is the same.\n. Hi, thanks for your words! Maybe this weekend I will take a look to the documentation.\n. Hi, I found two bugs in your code:\nYou are using #map selector:\njs\n$(document).ready(function(){\n  map = new GMaps({\n    div: '#map',\n    lat: -12.043333,\n    lng: -77.028333\n  });\n});\nWhen you have a #map_canvas element:\nhtml\n<div id=\"map_canvas\"></div>\nAlso, you need to set a height for #map_canvas (that's mandatory for GMaps and Google Maps too). Check the jQuery UI documentation to see how to set a height in that element.\n. Not now, but any contribution is welcome :)\n. Have you tried with activate? The map needs to know the exact dimensions of its container before using refresh().\n. @olegmedvedev yes, that's exactly what I meant. map.refresh should be called after the accordion is activated, no before. Thanks!\n. Hi, sorry for the long delay. I'm intrigued with this bug, because the removeMarker function you commented isn't from gmaps but from the cluster, so it doesn't perform recursive calls. But clearly was a bad choice to call markerClusterer.removeMarker every time a marker is removed. I will change the markerClusterer.removeMarker to markerClusterer.clearMarkers and put it outside the for loop.\nThanks for your help!\n. It depends what kind of geofence do you have. It works when fence is an instance of google.maps.Polygon or google.maps.Circle. It doesn't work with google.maps.Rectangle but you can use this polyfill:\njavascript\ngoogle.maps.Rectangle.prototype.containsLatLng = function(latLng) {\n  return this.getBounds().contains(latLng);\n};\n. You can use the map.checkGeofence(lat, lng, fence) method. It will return true if the coordinate is inside the geofence, and false otherwise.\n. If you want a full customization you must use Overlays (http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/overlays.html).\n. That is an error for Cordova. Check your app's permissions.\n. You can use map.panBy(x_pixels, y_pixels).\n. Apparently is a new warning from Google Maps, but creating a Google Maps API Key is simple and free: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key\n. I think you can override the map styles and hide the Point of Interests and/or transit stations with StyledMapType. Check this demo: https://codepicnic.com/consoles/styled-maps \n. @kaydwithers it works now? anyway, the code is the following:\n``` javascript\nvar map = new GMaps({\nel: \"#map\",\nlat: 41.895465,\nlng: 12.482324,\nzoom: 15, \nzoomControl : true,\nzoomControlOpt: {\n  style : \"SMALL\",\n  position: \"TOP_LEFT\"\n},\npanControl : true,\nstreetViewControl : false,\nmapTypeControl: false,\noverviewMapControl: false\n});\nvar styles = [\n  {\n    stylers: [\n      { hue: \"#00ffe6\" },\n      { saturation: -20 }\n    ]\n  }, {\n      featureType: \"road\",\n      elementType: \"geometry\",\n      stylers: [\n          { lightness: 100 },\n          { visibility: \"simplified\" }\n    ]\n  }, {\n      featureType: \"road\",\n      elementType: \"labels\",\n      stylers: [\n          { visibility: \"off\" }\n    ]\n  }\n];\nmap.addStyle({\n  styledMapName:\"Styled Map\",\n  styles: styles,\n  mapTypeId: \"map_style\"\n});\nmap.setStyle(\"map_style\");\n``\n. I see, the only workaround available is turning off the POIs (and transit stations). I'm closing this for now, since is a Google Maps \"bug\".\n. Thanks! I added your tip in the [wiki](https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps/wiki/Tips)\n. Not sure, but it can be a bug in the site's css.\n. You can use [renderRoute`](https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps/blob/master/lib/gmaps.routes.js#L115):\njavascript\nmap.renderRoute({\n  origin: [myOriginLat, myOriginLng],\n  destination: [myDestinationLat, myDestinationLng],\n}, {}); // empty object is DirectionsRenderer's options.\nIt uses the same options as getRoutes.\n. Thanks, I'm working in a new documentation section, hopefully I'll finish this month.\n. Hi, sorry for the late reply. You can add an infowindow to each marker (or use a single infowindow and change its content if the infowindow will be shown once in the map at the same time). And use this code:\n``` javascript\nvar map = new GMaps(/.../);\nvar marker = map.addMarker(/.../);\nmarker.infoWindow.open(map.map, marker);\n``\n. It's probably a issue with Google Geocoding Service. Nothing I can do from here.\n. I think is a browser _issue_, nothing I can do from this side \ud83d\ude1e \n. Google moved their code to GitHub: https://github.com/googlemaps/js-marker-clusterer.\nI'll update the site with the new link, thanks!\n. I guess you can manipulate the styles for theelproperty in the object returned bymap.drawOverlay(...)(or located inmap.overlays)\n. If it's a polygon you try to draw, use theuseGeoJSONproperty. GMaps doesn't support geoJSON formatting (which is [longitude, latitude] instead [latitude, longitude]) right now.\n. Not really. You must create your own labels with [drawOverlay](http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/overlays.html).\n. Cool, thanks! I'll add on the next version.\n. Hi, check this example: https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps/blob/master/examples/styled_maps.html\n. Hi, I think you're asking about geocoding? Check [this example](https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps/blob/master/examples/geocoding.html) and just changeaddressfor any of the parameters [passed here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#GeocoderRequest)\n. Could you provide me a demo to debug? I tried in the [homepage's map](http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/) and didn't see any change.setZoomcalls the nativesetZoommethod from thegoogle.maps.Mapinstance.\n. Hi, usesetRadius()`:\njavascript\nvar circle = map.drawCircle(...);\ncircle.setRadius(x);\n. I checked and seems to be an issue with the Node version and the grunt-contrib-jasmine package. I fixed bug after bug related to mismatched versions and it seems to work fine now (0.4.25).. ",

I personally don't like Prototype that much, but we'll look into if it'd be possible to make GmapsJs more abstract and non-framework dependent. \n.

But could certainly look to it. \n. I think we can look at something like that. We had to built some time ago a maps app using limited resources and found that reusing the map and doing a cluster of the markers was the thing that reduced the memory the most. \n. There are a list of tips here that handle this situation: https://github.com/HPNeo/gmaps/wiki/Tips\n. You could add une using some of the custom controls: \njavascript\n    map.addControl({\n      position: 'top_right',\n      text: 'Print',\n      style: {\n        margin: '5px',\n        padding: '1px 6px',\n        border: 'solid 1px #717B87',\n        background: '#fff'\n      },\n      events: {\n        click: function(){\n          window.print(); // Be aware some browsers would have another ways to launch this\n        }\n      }\n    });\n. I'm not sure you can accomplish this with plain JS. I'd probably add some button that creates a StaticMapURL and open as a new window where the user can print it.

I'm closing this for now since there have been a couple of fixes around here, but feel free to reopen it if it's still wrong.\n. Hi Vinicius. \nIt's actually simple, you can pass any regular Google Map options to the constructor:\njavascript\n    var map = new GMaps({\n        div: '#map',\n        lat: -12.043333,\n        lng: -77.028333,\n        disableDefaultUI: true\n    });\u200b\nThat being said, there was a bug with that particular option which is now fixed. Thanks for letting us know.\n. I think we could consider implementing this one. Would help if working on a Single Page Application and such. \n. If you've written that function, would you mind adding it through a pull request? I think it's a valid concern and would be neat to see how people would use it. \n. I believe this is more of a functionality question. Let's see what @HPNeo has to say about this. \n. Is this issue still going on? I'll close it for now but if it's still there, don't hesitate in reopening. It'd help us tons to add a fiddle for testing purposes :) \n. Hi Mattias,\nMaybe is the way you are loading the Google Maps JS? Take a look at this and see if that kind of change is doable: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11863709/google-maps-api-disabled-on-domain\n. Nice catch. AKA: Working as intended? :-1: \n. Hi Onza,\nWe've recently started playing around with AngularJS and will look into adding some information about it. Probably as a directive of some sort.\n. You could take a look at the code used here and adding:\njavascript\nmarker.infoWindow.open()\nto the code that centers the map.\n. You can actually use external cluster libs. Take a look at: https://github.com/HPNeo/gmaps/issues/92\n. This looks interesting. Would you mind adding a test for it? \n. You should take a look at both this examples: \nhttp://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/geocoding.html\nhttp://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/routes_advanced.html\nThe first one will show you how to use Google's geocoding capabilities and the second one how to draw a line for each step of the route. You should use that \"step\" function to provide the updated position for the car in your example. \n. :+1:\n. +100 al Pull request por el cleanup. Opensource FTW.\n.

Will update the documentation.\n. @jails The feature for now is still pending till the related pull request is finished/updated. \n. Pull requests are welcomed :)\n. Is this is still an issue? I'm closing this for now since there have been a couple of fixes around here, but feel free to reopen it if it's still wrong.\n. Hi Vinicius. \nIt's actually simple, you can pass any regular Google Map options to the constructor:\njavascript\n    var map = new GMaps({\n        div: '#map',\n        lat: -12.043333,\n        lng: -77.028333,\n        disableDefaultUI: true\n    });\u200b\nThat being said, there was a bug with that particular option which is now fixed. Thanks for letting us know.\n. I think we could consider implementing this one. Would help if working on a Single Page Application and such. \n. If you've written that function, would you mind adding it through a pull request? I think it's a valid concern and would be neat to see how people would use it. \n. I believe this is more of a functionality question. Let's see what @HPNeo has to say about this. \n. Is this issue still going on? I'll close it for now but if it's still there, don't hesitate in reopening. It'd help us tons to add a fiddle for testing purposes :) \n. Hi Mattias,\nMaybe is the way you are loading the Google Maps JS? Take a look at this and see if that kind of change is doable: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11863709/google-maps-api-disabled-on-domain\n. Nice catch. AKA: Working as intended? :-1: \n. Hi Onza,\nWe've recently started playing around with AngularJS and will look into adding some information about it. Probably as a directive of some sort.\n. You could take a look at the code used here and adding:\njavascript\nmarker.infoWindow.open()\nto the code that centers the map.\n. You can actually use external cluster libs. Take a look at: https://github.com/HPNeo/gmaps/issues/92\n. This looks interesting. Would you mind adding a test for it? \n. You should take a look at both this examples: \nhttp://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/geocoding.html\nhttp://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/examples/routes_advanced.html\nThe first one will show you how to use Google's geocoding capabilities and the second one how to draw a line for each step of the route. You should use that \"step\" function to provide the updated position for the car in your example. \n. :+1:\n. ",

It should be near the root of your document (like ).\n. You might have GPS turned off or Geolocation disabled elsewhere on the device. If you're sure everything is enabled, then the assisted GPS feature in the phone may have issues. Have you confirmed if it works accurately using the Google Maps app?\n. ",

    "WickyNilliams": "No problems, there we go :) \nI tried to get grunt to keep the one it generates, so you won't have the problem of keeping the test configuration via grunt and this file in sync. That worked (the grunt jasmine task has an option for this) but it insists on using its own copy of jasmine which it puts in a different directory. I didn't want to add more files without discussing it so just did the minimum change possible for now.\n. Awesome, cheers mate. \nNow that's landed, I've got a few more ideas if you don't mind me contributing? (if you're wondering, this library helped me immensely a little while ago and I'd like to pay back where I can)\n. Oh sweet, I'll see which of those can be translated into jshint configuration. That'll be a pull request for a different day though :)\n. Sweet. I'll get on it with these options.\nI'm also going to add in camelcase if you don't object? It's covered in the coding standards. \n. I've been pushing on with this this evening. Most of the items above have been quite easily achievable, but a few have been more troublesome. Here's the configuration I've been working with so far\n``` json\n{\n\"camelcase\" : false,\n  \"curly\" : true,\n  \"eqeqeq\" : true,\n  \"newcap\" : true,\n\"shadow\" : true,\n  \"sub\" : true,\n  \"loopfunc\" : true,\n  \"boss\" : true\n}\n```\nYou'll notice that I'm not using camelcase, indent or strict as they all had greater reach than I envisaged, and I wanted to check with your before pushing on with them. \ncamelcase extends its reach to variable names as well as functions. The variable names all seem to be in snake_case and I didn't want to just change them. What are you thoughts on this?\nindent seems is very strict about indentation and would require a fair bit of reformatting. I'm happy to do this, but again just wanted to check with you first.\nstrict would require that we put \"use strict\" directives in every function, or refactor the code a little so that everything is in a self-executing function (the \"use strict\" statements cascades to inner functions).\nThe last four options (relaxing options) I had to add to get compliance without going above and beyond what we initially discussed. Most of them are pretty sane, but some things would require a more intimate knowledge of the codebase to know if they're safe to change. e.g. excluding boss in the above config would have jshint complain about using assignments in cases where comparisons are expected - which makes sense. But there's at least one example of that in the codebase, and I didn't know if it was safe to change or if it relied on some truthy-ness of JS. It'd be great if you could clone my branch jshint-compliance, disable each in turn and see what you think.\nCheers\n. Did you get anywhere with this? I could make a PR for what I have so far and we just chip away at the rest\n. No problems, there we go :) \nI tried to get grunt to keep the one it generates, so you won't have the problem of keeping the test configuration via grunt and this file in sync. That worked (the grunt jasmine task has an option for this) but it insists on using its own copy of jasmine which it puts in a different directory. I didn't want to add more files without discussing it so just did the minimum change possible for now.\n. Awesome, cheers mate. \nNow that's landed, I've got a few more ideas if you don't mind me contributing? (if you're wondering, this library helped me immensely a little while ago and I'd like to pay back where I can)\n. Oh sweet, I'll see which of those can be translated into jshint configuration. That'll be a pull request for a different day though :)\n. Sweet. I'll get on it with these options.\nI'm also going to add in camelcase if you don't object? It's covered in the coding standards. \n. I've been pushing on with this this evening. Most of the items above have been quite easily achievable, but a few have been more troublesome. Here's the configuration I've been working with so far\n``` json\n{\n\"camelcase\" : false,\n  \"curly\" : true,\n  \"eqeqeq\" : true,\n  \"newcap\" : true,\n\"shadow\" : true,\n  \"sub\" : true,\n  \"loopfunc\" : true,\n  \"boss\" : true\n}\n```\nYou'll notice that I'm not using camelcase, indent or strict as they all had greater reach than I envisaged, and I wanted to check with your before pushing on with them. \ncamelcase extends its reach to variable names as well as functions. The variable names all seem to be in snake_case and I didn't want to just change them. What are you thoughts on this?\nindent seems is very strict about indentation and would require a fair bit of reformatting.

I have amended your code to become this:\n``` javascript\n$(document).ready(function() {\n  map = new GMaps({\n    div: '#fullmap',\n    height: '300px',\n    lat: 40.71448,\n    lng: -74.0059,\n    zoom: 13,\n    disableDefaultUI: false,\n  });\nmap.addMarker({\n    lat: 40.71448,\n    lng: -74.0059,\n    size: 'small',\n    infoWindow: {\n      content: 'content text'\n    }\n  });\nmap.addStyle({\n    styledMapName: \"Hide Places\",\n    styles: [{\n      \"featureType\": \"poi\",\n      \"elementType\": \"labels\",\n      \"stylers\": [{\n        \"visibility\": \"off\"\n      }]\n    }],\n    mapTypeId: \"hide_places\"\n  });\nmap.addStyle({\n    styledMapName: \"Show Places\",\n    styles: [{\n      \"featureType\": \"poi\",\n      \"elementType\": \"labels\",\n      \"stylers\": [{\n        \"visibility\": \"on\"\n      }]\n    }],\n    mapTypeId: \"show_places\"\n  });\n$(document).on('click', '#showPlaces', function(event) {\n    event.preventDefault();\n    map.setStyle(\"show_places\");\n  });\n$(document).on('click', '#hidePlaces', function(event) {\n    event.preventDefault();\n    map.setStyle(\"hide_places\");\n  });\n});\n```\n.

    "amenadiel": "@batzidi you shouldn't try to access map center's properties ( lat and lng ) directly. The key keeps changing and probably 'k' and 'B' doesn't mean anything at this point.

You can cache the loader script for a few minutes if you care to build a proxy, but it won't work for long. Endpoints keep changing, and parts of the internal requests you make to google carry data that is unique for your session.\nWhat's wrong with using google's provided url? \n. I agree in that using\ninstance.parameter = options.parameter || true;\nis wrong, because if you explicitly set options.parameter to false, instance.parameter will still be true.\nHowever, it doesn't sound like a great idea to declare valueOrDefault as a global variable. You could as well declare valueOrDefault inside GMaps constructor.\n. The example you linked is manually instancing markers and infowindows. In gmaps, as @Bin4ry1337 said, adding a marker is a method of the map instance, and adding an infowindow is just an option when doing so.\nIf you declare \njs\n    map.addMarker({\n        lat: 63.998847,\n        lng: 11.486882,\n        title: 'Test',\n        infoWindow:\n        {\n            content: 'Hello World'\n        }\n    });\nIt implicitly instances a marker, which is appended to map.markers, and which implicitly contains an infowindow instance, which is referenced on its infoWindow property.\nTherefore, calling\njs\nvar markerInstance = map.markers[0];\nmarkerInstance.infoWindow.open(map, markerInstance);\nwill open the infowindow.\nTo attach a click listener to the DOM element you can use google maps domListener, jQuery listeners or attach onclick events like in your example.\n.
