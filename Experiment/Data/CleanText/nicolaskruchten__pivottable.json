    "nicolaskruchten": "Hmm, this is unfortunate! I can't replicate on Firefox/OSX, which is all I have access to here. It's been tested on OSX Chrome/Firefox/Safari and works well. It works best in Chrome performance-wise.\nAny help you could provide regarding why it's not working in FF/Win and how to fix it would be welcome :)\n. OK, this is very helpful, thank you! I'll try to find a fix on the weekend :)\n. I've just seen this on FF on OSX 10.6\n. I've just removed the call to disableSelection() and this fixed things on FF/OSX... Would love confirmation that it works on FF/Win and Opera, if you have a chance, as I have no access to a Windows machine at the moment. Thanks!\n. Great feedback, thanks! I've implemented this change.\n. Interesting. I hadn't thought about that. I'll look into what it takes to fix it :)\nThanks for the feedback!\n. Fixed by eranation's pull-request :)\n. This looks awesome, thanks!\n. Sorry, I forgot to respond to your \"Plans\" comment: I think it's in line with issue number 5? https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/issues/5\n. I'm glad you like it!\nI'd love to hear your thoughts about how to tackle #5... Perhaps split the pivot() method into two calls, something like renderPivot(pivotData()) where pivotData() would return an object that could be queried for row/col headers and the data for each cell, so that people could implement their own renderPivot() methods? \nPlease do send me a pull request for any fixes to help things compile under the latest CS version :)\n. Hmmm I notice that double-clicking on variables to exclude certain values via checkboxes no longer works after this pull request... I may have to revert the 'own' parts of it to get this feature working again :(\n. OK I've fixed a few issues, including the compilation. You can't use 'own' in a 'for-in' loop, and I didn't notice but your pull request changed the meaning of line 455 (in the original, 457 in your version) so that the double-click popup didn't work, so I fixed that too :)\n. Agreed, this is a much better approach. I'll think about how to do it but I would also happily accept any pull requests along these lines or some pseudo-code or something like that :)\n. OK.  I could split the pivot(...) function into two calls, something like renderPivot(pivotData(...)) where pivotData() would return an object that could be queried for row/col headers and the data for each cell, so that people could implement their own renderPivot() methods? Would this meet your needs? \n. The data model is now separate from the DOM construction, although I'm not sure if it's actually possible to do what you were hoping to with AngularJS.\n. Hi Oscar. I'm not doing any work on this issue at the moment, and I've never worked with AngularJS so I have no idea what's involved here. \n. OK, I'm busy for the next couple of weeks but I'll take a look in late August :)\n. To be honest, I don't think I have any time or bandwidth to work on this feature, but I would happily accept related pull-requests.\n. Aggregators are now documented here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Aggregators\n. Thanks!\n. Done and done!\n. OK, I've got a first cut at this running here: http://nicolaskruchten.github.io/pivottable/examples/gchart.html \nChartJS is pretty but doesn't support legends out of the box so it's a poor fit for this use-case. Flot and Flotr2 are nice, and a set of renderers could probably be built for those, based on the gcharts_renderer.\n. http://stackoverflow.com/a/12213072/112871\n. no need\n. Basically what is needed here is to have the pivotUI() call return some object which can then be queried and possibly mutated (in order to implement #14). The challenge is that given that this is a jQuery plugin, in order for chaining to function, the pivotUI() call must return this.\nI could leverage jQuery's data() system to attach a function to this which would return a queryable/mutable pivotUI object which subscribes to change events or something like that.\nA similar approach could be used with the underlying pivot() call to expose the pivotData object, which would then be available from the pivotUI object.\n. The data is now stored in the jquery data field 'pivotUIOptions'\n. Thanks for this feedback! You're absolutely right that this would be a great enhancement, and I think I know how to go about doing it... Basically the pivotUI would store its state in some 'data' fields, which could then be queried out (as per #13) and then it would use those values as default options if none were provided in the actual function call (which would always be able to override).\nI'll see if I can get that done soon :)\n. This is now resolved, and works as you have requested!\n. Thanks for reporting this. I can replicate it easily and will try to fix it today.\n. repaired in 3628e4a\n. This can now be done by implementing a custom renderer, which outputs whatever HTML is desired :)\n. Documentation for writing a custom renderer is here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Renderers\n. Hi there,\nYou seem to be fixing the Javascript version of the file rather than the Coffeescript version of the file... Actually the Javascript version is generated by compiling the Coffeescript, so changes have to be made to the pivot.coffee file. If you can describe the changes you've made which work for both numbers and strings, I would happily accept the change :)\nThanks,\nNicolas\n. Hi again, I've just pushed a fix that will sort strings, numbers and strings containing numbers (i.e. dates) in a much more natural way, please let me know if this works for you :)\n. Yes, this will not work, as XMLHttpRequests cannot work against local files. The example has to be served from an actual web server, rather than run using file > open. The demo runs well for me in Chrome when hosted by Github: http://nicolaskruchten.github.io/pivottable/mps_prepop.html\n. Hmm then it looks like Firefox implements different rules with respect to XMLHttpRequests on file:/// -type URLs :)\n. Ah yes, this will definitely be a problem! Your solution is a good one and I'll try to implement/test it soon, unless you want to send me a pull request :)\n. I've implemented the solution you suggested and it works quite well, thank you! In fact, this fix works well with my natural sort fix in the same commit, which enables you to use dash-delimited dates as values, even if there is no zero-padding :)\n. Agreed. The short answer is that, as shown in the images in the readme (duplicated below), you need to drag a value to be summarized by the numerical aggregators underneath the dropdown. count() takes no arguments, but sum(x) does, so you need to tell it what to sum (or average)\n\n\n. Yeah, the documentation around aggregators needs work, which is captured in Issue #6 ... I have a plan, but haven't gotten around to it just yet. I'm on vacation this week so maybe I'll find the time after this weekend music festival :)\n. Renderers are now documented: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Renderers\n. Hi Rafael,\nThanks for the feedback! This isn't currently supported but it's a good idea. It would require subtotal support first, which I see you've already logged issue #26 for.\nThe right way to do this, assuming that subtotal support exists in the PivotData object, would be to modify the default table renderer.\n. All right, I think we can finally consider this issue resolved! The official answer in the FAQ is now \"use Subtotal.js\" :)\n. This isn't supported at the moment, no, but it's a good idea. It would enable expanding/collapsing (#25).\nThe right way to implement this would be to first modify the PivotData structure to contain subtotal information encoded somehow, and then to modify the default table renderer.\n. I don't believe anyone is working on this at the moment.\nMy recommendation is that you start by making the minimal possible changes to the PivotData class to support subtotal aggregation. I would be happy to accept this as a pull request.\nOnce that's done, you can develop a new Renderer based on the Table Renderer which displays subtotals. I would be happy to accept that as a separate renderer in its own file, but probably not as an extensive set of modifications to the built-in Table Renderer.\nHope this makes sense, let me know if I can provide any pointers!\n. I'm not actively working on this feature, no.\n. @nagarajanchinnasamy thanks for this contribution!\nMy feedback is as follows:\n1. I don't wish to add subtotals to the main Table renderer, so I would ask that any PR you submit contains a new renderer in a new file.\n2. I understand that enabling subtotals requires some changes to the PivotData class, so these are the changes that are of greatest interest to me. I will need to take some time to carefully read through the changes you made. I notice that you've modified the most performance-sensitive part of the PivotData class (this bit with the \"tight loop\" comment) so this will require a bit of performance-testing on very large datasets as well.\n. @nagarajanchinnasamy I've put some thought into how we can modify this library to allow your fine work to be compatible. My proposal is that we accept a new parameter which would allow the developer to override the PivotData class altogether, instead of just the processData function, so that someone could actually choose to store the data differently as well as process it differently. If I made this change, would you consider modifying your code to follow?\n. All right, I think we can finally consider this issue resolved! The official answer in the FAQ is now \"use Subtotal.js\" :)\n. Thanks for the feedback!\nI've update the documentation here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Aggregators to explicity note that the built-in aggregators are available at $.pivotUtilities.aggregators.\nIf you want to use pivot() with intSum over an attribute called \"x\" then you could pass the result of $.pivotUtilities.aggregators.intSum([\"x\"]) as the aggregator key to the options parameter.\n. I've not tested PivotTable.js quite to that size of data set... How many records/attributes does your data set have?\n. Great, thanks for the followup!\n. There isn't right now but that's a good idea!\nI assume you mean sum() or average() right?\n. This is really cool, thanks for sharing! I'll take a closer look in the coming days to see how this could be incorporated into the core or if we can add it to this repo as a plugin or something :)\n. Closing as duplicate of #73 ... Still working on a way to incorporate this into the library.\n. @unk1911 I'm not actively working on this, no.\nJust to clarify your ask: you want to apply one operation (i.e. sum) to multiple fields? How would you envision this working when the operation actually already operates on multiple fields (i.e. Sum over Sum) ?\n. @unk1911 I'm not really that familiar with stephanvd's code, and the core library has evolved a little bit since he wrote it, so I'm afraid I'm not in a good position to help you debug any incompatibility between them.\nAs to your question about integrating this into the core, given that as it says in the Gist it doesn't have multifield support, I'm afraid I won't be able to.\n. Hi @unk1911 \nthanks for your messages and work. I haven't forgotten about this but I haven't been able to look into the bug report you've posted. If/when I can fix the opts.vals thing, your aggregators should be compatible, although I'm hesitant to add the aggregators/renderers themselves to the library as I'm not sure I'm willing to keep maintaining them if the library changes, so perhaps I could list your repo in a page on the wiki of related projects/extensions or something?\n. @unk1911 unfortunately I don't think I can make this change in the core library for a few reasons:\n1) the vals = opts.vals is set within the initialRender block for a reason: we only want to override the user's selection the first time the pivot table is rendered\n2) I don't want to start hardcoding references to specific aggregator names in the core library\nUnfortunately, we'll just have to live with your fork...\n. @drtzack the reason nothing has changed is that this feature request is fundamentally contrary to the architecture of this library. If you need this feature, you need a different library, there's no sense in complaining.\n. @desienjelina please do not comment on old, closed issues like this.. That seems like it would be rather difficult to do as the pivotUI() call actually runs through the data to create the filter menus that pop up on double-click (looks for unique values in low-cardinality attributes)... Sorry!\n. That's quite strange... Can you post a few rows of your input please, so I can test this? It works OK here: http://nicolaskruchten.github.io/pivottable/examples/mps_prepop.html\n. Hmm OK I understand. I think this is just a performance issue in your use-case, so I'll close the issue, as the API does function as documented :)\n. This is a great idea. I see two ways of doing it, both of which leverage the jQuery data() system. \nOne option would be for the Table renderer to attach to each td element a filtering function, which you could use to iterate over the data-set to figure out which records match the cell. This may use less memory but be slower.\nAnother option would be the same idea except that we would attach an array of records to each td. This may use more memory but be faster.\nIn either case, you could attach a click handler which could access the matching records and display them however made sense. What do you think?\n. Hi,\n1) I don't really know much about Sharepoint so I won't really be able to help you with that, sorry...\n2) There is no real connection to a CSV file to refresh... The input formats are documented here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Input-Formats\n. Pull request #141 (which won't be merged) shows how someone patched this library for this purpose\n. I'm looking at merging #557 or something like it.. functionality for this is now in master!. Yes, definitely a big bug, and thanks very much for the fix! I'll admit I hadn't tried running multiple pivot tables on the same page before ;)\n. Thanks very much!\n. I've definitely used PivotTable.js with up to 200k rows of input data, and it does slow down at that point, but certainly it's quite snappy in the 25k-50k rows of input. The time it takes to generate a table varies with the number of records and with the size of the table (i.e. the cardinality of the attributes you use as rows and columns): if you are making a table that is more than around 200x200 things will definitely start to take a while.\nThe issue in #29 was with actually loading the data up into memory before passing it into the pivotUI() call, I believe, and was fixed by batching the data across the wire. PivotTable.js doesn't support incrementally inputting data, as that wouldn't help much with performance under the current architecture.\nWhat does your data look like and what sort of table are you trying to generate?\n. That's very strange, I can't replicate this behaviour on my end: it's working fine right now with 25k of data in my browser. \nWhat OS/browser versions are you running? \nIf you look in the javascript debug console are you seeing any helpful output or error messages?\nIs your data proprietary or can you send me a to-scale sample of what you're running into problems with?\n. Hi again,\nOK, so I've generated a random file to test with, it's here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/05yifl75chcws5y/bigdata.csv\nIt's 20k lines of 26 columns of random letters: each attribute has a cardinality of 26. If I browse to the example which uses in-browser CSV parsing here http://nicolaskruchten.github.io/pivottable/examples/local.html I'm able to load it up and make some fairly large 26x26 tables and charts very quickly and 26x26x26 tables and charts  in around 1.5 seconds. Admittedly when I make tables that have two attributes in the columns and two in the rows (i.e. 26x26x26x26 cells) things slow down a LOT but it does eventually render a table.\nAre you seeing different behaviour on your end? Does your data have much higher cardinality than 25 or so? How many cells are you expecting to see in the final table which is not generating correctly?\n. Just following up... Did you get a chance to try with my sample data?\n. Hi again,\nOK, I've regenerated the CSV file, it's at the same URL as before but now it's 7.5MB instead of 1MB and it's 50k lines instead of 20k lines. Still works well on my end... You too?\nMy third question wasn't about how many cells were generating correctly, I get that you're seeing 0 :) My question was more: if you saw what you were expecting, how many cells would that have?\nLet me know, I'd love to help find a solution!\nCheers,\nNicolas\n. Hmm OK, in that case I'm sort of stumped. \nIs the sample data file comparable to yours in terms of size now (number of rows, number of attributes, cardinality of attributes, total size in megabytes)?\n. So the attribute values aren't parsed unless some aggregator requires parsing. The default aggregator is count which doesn't parse so I doubt that's the issue. And right now I have 5 letters per attribute, just to make things bigger. \nPerhaps it's just a JSON parsing thing but I've worked with larger JSON objects in the past. I'll try to regenerate my data in JSON and we'll see what's what :)\nIs the code you're using similar to the code in one of the examples or is there a lot of other stuff going on as well?\n. OK. Have you ruled out the possibility that the browser is choking on parsing the incoming JSON? I.e. if you put an alert(mps.length) right before the pivotUI() call, does it work?\n. Hi, is there any update on this issue?\n. Hi again,\nThanks for getting back to me! It seems from your tests with the alert() calls that the problem is indeed happening outside the pivot library itself, in the data parsing/preparation step...\nIf the issue is a problem strictly with JSON parsing (rather than simply manipulating a very large array in memory), then perhaps you could try the same solution as the one that worked for issue #29 which was to do multiple requests to the server for smaller chunks of JSON-formatted data, which are then parsed separately and merged before passing them to the pivot table. You could also switch to a simpler JSON format: right now you seem to be using the array-of-objects format (based on one of your much-earlier answers) but the JSON would be far far smaller if you used the array-of-arrays format. (Examples here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Input-Formats)\nHere my answers to your other questions:\n- The \"why is it good?\" statements are based on the types of datasets which I've provided to you above.\n- I have not put any thought into something which interacts with a server in any particular way as I want to keep this library strictly client-side.\n- In terms of aggregated values, they are computed during the rendering phase, depending on which aggregation type is selected.\n. Since we've narrowed the issue down to JSON parsing, let's leave cardinality issues aside for the moment...\nMy chunking suggestion, and the solution to issue #29, is not to load the data into the pivot table piecemeal, but rather to parse it piecemeal, merge it and to load it in one go. Compare the following pseudocode:\n\nvar input = JSON.parse(string_that_is_too_big) // this takes way too long\n//now call x.pivot(input...)\n\nwith this:\n\n// step 1: parse\nvar input_chunk1 = JSON.parse(chunk1_string); // chunk1_string is small enough to work\nvar input_chunk2 = JSON.parse(chunk2_string); // chunk2_string is small enough to work\n//step 2: merge\nvar input = [].concat(input_chunk1, input_chunk2);\n//now call x.pivot(input...)\n\nDoes this make sense?\n. OK, lots going on here!\n1) clearly there are JSON-parsing issues at play here, which is a little outside of PivotTable-related support unfortunately\n2) 1.7M or even 300k rows is going to be a lot for a browser to handle, so I would recommend sending either a subset or a pre-aggregated set of rows from the server. This is generally the approach I take: do as much processing server-side as I can.\n3) I've no idea what you've changed in your environment that would be breaking IE, sorry :)\n. I would be very interested in seeing a 500-row input which will cause this to hang! Can you share it please?\n. Ah OK if you actually try to build a 10M-cell table, yeah, rendering will be a problem. But the initial parse of the data and default render (i.e. one cell containing the counts) will work etc.\n. Certainly one could write a new Renderer which uses a different strategy than DOM operations to build a table. That said, I'm not sure how useful it is to be able to render tables that big and sparse, from a UI point of view, so I have not put any effort into solving this problem... :)\n. Sorry for the long delay in answering here.... You could stop DOM operations in the TableRenderer based on the number of rows/cols.\n. @yolnda please don't comment on old, closed issues. Please create a new issue with a clearer description of your question.\n. Hi there,\nThere is no way to override the names, unfortunately: the system just uses the field labels from the input data. The best thing to do in your case would be to change the labels in the input data.\nCheers,\nNicolas\n. Switched to $.isArray instead of Array.isArray\n. There is currently no such option but how about this: if there is only one aggregator, then we clearly don't need a dropdown so we could just make it straight text or something like that, and if you don't want to see anything there you can use a space or empty string as an aggregator name?\n. @fastcatch please see my comments in #78 ... I still think my solution is a feasible one :)\n. Upon further thought, I don't think that replacing the dropdown with text is a good idea even if there is only one aggregator. Post-processing the output with CSS or jQuery (as you've done here) is probably your best bet.\n. Here you go: http://nicolaskruchten.github.io/pivottable/examples/simple_ui_from_table.html\nAre you using thead->th as you say above or thead->tr->th as in the documentation?\n. Are you using pivot() or pivotUI()? If it's the latter, then you might not need to write a new aggregator, you can just use the built-in sum and drag the appropriate attribute under the dropdown to sum over it.\n. Ok so the issue is on this line: var SumOverSum = $.pivotUtilities.aggregators.SumOverSum... The function in $.pivotUtilities.aggregators is sumOverSum rather than SumOverSum :)\n. Cool table BTW :)\n. Nice on, thanks :)\n. Hi,\nI don't think that there's a way to do that with the current architecture unfortunately...\nSorry,\nNick\n. duplicate of #49 \n. This has been implemented in this commit: 4832221d5dc849cee0c751be2eae612fe194ecd5\n. For example, choose \"countAsFractionOfTotal\" or \"countAsFractionOfRow\" or something like that in this example: http://nicolaskruchten.github.io/pivottable/examples/mps_prepop.html\n. They do work, but you'll need to drag one attribute under the dropdown for sum and average (i.e. sum of what? average of what?) and two for sumOverSum (sum of what over sum of what?) See the \"gender imbalance\" part of the UI tutorial: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/UI-Tutorial\n. Is this working for you now?\n. Okey dokes :)\n. Unfortunately this is not possible right now...\nIn general, it's not clear how one would do this and maintain the grouping in the table headers: if you have data grouped by, say, day then hour in the row headers, how would you sort by hourly total? Sort the hours within the days? Or resort the whole table and break the rowspans?\n. I see what you're saying, however this is a pretty major change to the current behaviour, and might be quite difficult to implement...\n. Closing as duplicate of #33\n. this functionality is now in master as of 87c2e3da58b60c672bee8fe612a8b63a3a217c47. This isn't currently possible and it would be fairly difficult to make it possible unfortunately.\n(Closed as duplicate of #41)\n. duplicate of #49 \n. Implemented in 4832221d5dc849cee0c751be2eae612fe194ecd5\n. For example, choose \"countAsFractionOfTotal\" or \"countAsFractionOfRow\" or something like that in this example: http://nicolaskruchten.github.io/pivottable/examples/mps_prepop.html\n. I think you've figured it out! Just create a new 'issue' for each question and request, like you've done with the other two :)\n. Yes, it would be useful, but it's not possible to simultaneously do this and respect the group/subgroup nesting in the row/column headers...\n(Duplicate of #44)\n. @joankent you can't do this at the moment: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#sorting-in-built-in-table-renderer\n. I'm closing this issue, as the FAQ addresses it fairly well.. Agreed, this would be useful, but would be pretty difficult under the current architecture :(\n. In general, if you want to implement this percentage feature, as well as sorting by value, subtotalling etc, I would recommend that you implement a new renderer, rather than modify the core PivotTable.js code. Please let me know if you'd like some direction on this...\nThis wiki page explains renderers briefly: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Renderers and you can see some example renderers here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/blob/master/gchart_renderers.coffee\n. I figured out an elegant way to do this, and it's been implemented in this commit: 4832221d5dc849cee0c751be2eae612fe194ecd5\n. For example, choose \"countAsFractionOfTotal\" or \"countAsFractionOfRow\" or something like that in this example: http://nicolaskruchten.github.io/pivottable/examples/mps_prepop.html\n. Sure. Let's do this discussion in the comments to issue #49 please :)\n. % of row and column has been implemented here: 4832221d5dc849cee0c751be2eae612fe194ecd5\n. I'm not sure I understand what you mean... Can you provide an example description of this?\n. OK, I understand. Unfortunately this is not possible...\n. This is pretty much what #49 depends upon, and is quite difficult to do, which is why #49 is difficult to address :(\n. OK, after some further thought, I've implemented this, and the percentage aggregators which people have been asking for. Check this commit for more info: 4832221d\n. Thanks for this Andr\u00e9s! Can you explain to me how to reproduce this bug? Does it happen with any of the examples here? http://nicolaskruchten.github.io/pivottable/examples/\n. Please see my answer to the same question in issue #42 \n. This is pretty neat, thanks! I unfortunately cannot accept this pull request as-is because it doesn't implement the changes in CoffeeScript but I will see what I can do about porting the concept into the CoffeeScript version :)\nThanks again!\n. Equivalent functionality has hit master in 87c2e3da58b60c672bee8fe612a8b63a3a217c47. Hi,\nDoes this wiki page answer your question? https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Input-Formats\nCheers,\nNicolas\n. The sorting function being used implements a form of 'natural sort' so if you give it integers it will sort \"1\" before \"10\" as expected. Try it and see! :)\n. Unfortunately that's not possible at the moment. The best bet is to prepend your integer to your string: ['2 b', '1 c', '3 a']  or something like that. This is what I do for attributes like Month, I format them as \"01 - January\", \"02 - Feburary\" etc.\n. Hi there! Unfortunately there is no built-in feature for this at the moment... Sorry!\n. No problem! I don't really have any pointers... It'll be easier for me to merge your changes in if you do it in CoffeeScript but if you prefer JavaScript I can port them by hand as well.\n. Are people wanting to export the input data or the resulting pivot table?\n. +1 to @fastcatch \nI should add that the simplest way to \"export\" to Excel is simple copy-paste. If you select the whole table and copy it, you can then paste it into Excel and it keeps almost all of the formatting intact.\n. Issue was auto-closed by Github, which was a bit premature, but  f636484 does implement, finally, reliable export functionality! You can see it in action here: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/mps_export.html\n. This is a client-side only library, so the backend technology (i.e. PHP) does not really come into play... Does the export_renderers functionality meet your needs? If not, what more would you need?\n. Yes, with the export_renderers... have you tried to see if this can meet your needs?\n. Thanks @LukeBrumfield !\n. I'm marking this as closed, given that the FAQ addresses it quite well: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#exporting-renderer-output-to-excel-or-images. HI there,\nI'm not sure I fully understand your question but I don't think what you're trying to do is possible with the current system. That said, if what you want is a static table, you can use the pivot() function instead of the pivotUI() function and create your own simpler UI around it...\nn\n. Cool. What are you calling the \"second dropdown menu\"? The aggregators? The contents of that dropdown are the aggregators parameter dictionary.\n. This is possible via CSS:\n.pvtTotalLabel {display: none; }\n.pvtTotal {display: none; }\n.pvtGrandTotal {display: none; }\n. You can now pass in localeStrings parameters to pivotUI(), pivot() and the default Table and Google Chart renderers to override all user-visible text.\n. This issue is now addressed via a new locale parameter to the pivotUI() function so no more need for the l10nwrapper... See the Localization wiki page for details.\n. Unfortunately this isn't something I think most people will want, so I don't think I will add it into the Renderer, but you should be able to use CSS to get this effect without the div element....\n. I've just added a CSS class to the td to make this easier for you and others :)\n. OK, fair enough. I played with adding the div into a few different places but this either breaks the heatmap or google chart rendering... Your best bet would be to inject the div yourself via jQuery at this point.\n. I tried and unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any way of doing this... All rendering stops while the pivot table is computing (the 'drop' event doesn't even finish until the rendering is complete), so spinners never have a chance to appear.\n. Seems like a solution to me!\n. There is no built-in support for this but you could probably use jQuery to move the elements around and fire the drag/drop events.\n. You would have to put Gender in the column area rather than the row area for this to work. Note that Google Charts behaves very weirdly (i.e. gives incorrect numbers!) when you give it tabular data (i.e. attributes in both the column and row area) and try to display a pie chart. This is why I haven't made a pie-chart option in the dropdown. Ideally one would want multiple pie-charts to appear but this is not possible with Google Charts.\n. Pie charts are now built in to the Plotly renderers :)\n. Interesting idea, I'd like to see the pull request. That said, I'm not a big fan of reordering drag'n'drop lists: when I drop something somewhere I expect it to stay there, not jump to its alphabetical position, personally...y\n. Fixed in the latest version :)\n. Hi there,\nYou will have to write your own Augmenter component for this, which will define what value goes into each cell, including the 'total' cells. The documentation is here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Aggregators\nIf this is what you've been trying, please let me know how I can help interpret the documentation :)\nCheers,\nNicolas\n. Hi,\nI added some features recently which make this possible but I haven't documented them yet. I will do so on the Aggregators wiki page and post here when I'm done ;)\nn\n. Actually I had documented this already on the wiki. Your inner function gets called with three parameters: data, rowKey and colKey. Your can also use the rowKey and colKey parameters to determine if you are in a total cell (null for rowKey means you are in a column total cell, null for colKey means you are in a row total cell, and null for both means you are in the grand total cell).\n. Done.\n. Thanks for the bug report! I've fixed this in the general case: the characters used in the attribute names are no longer used in IDs :)\n. Thanks for this feedback! That said, I kind of feel like both of these features are a bit out of scope for this library...\n1) can be implemented by storing the options in a JSON object and calling the pivot function again with stored layouts... This can be implemented outside this library using existing features.\n2) is much easier to do by using the operating system's \"print to PDF\" function, as Google Charts provides no way to export and the various hacks which exist are pretty brittle\n. I'm not sure I understand the question... Can you clarify please?\n. I see what you're suggesting here but I think that this would be a very big change to the existing system. Perhaps it would be worth creating a new wrapper that uses the same PivotData/aggregator backend for this sort of thing.\n. Similar to #30 \n. Great idea! https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Used-By\n. Thanks for this pull-request! Unfortunately, the getWeek function appears a bit buggy to me... For example, dates around January 1, 2015 give strange results:\nWith dowOffset=1, I get:\n- Mon 2014-12-29 -> \"52\"\n- Tue 2014-12-30 -> \"01\"\n- Wed 2014-12-31 -> \"01\"\n- Thu 2015-01-01 -> \"01\"\n- Fri 2014-01-02 -> \"01\"\n- Sat 2014-01-03 -> \"01\"\n- Sun 2014-01-04 -> \"01\"\nWith dowOffset=0 I get\n- Mon 2014-12-29 -> \"53\"\n- Tue 2014-12-30 -> \"53\"\n- Wed 2014-12-31 -> \"53\"\n- Thu 2015-01-01 -> \"53\"\n- Fri 2014-01-02 -> \"00\"\n- Sat 2014-01-03 -> \"00\"\n- Sun 2014-01-04 -> \"00\"\nAccording to ISO-3601 the correct result should be \"01\" for all of these dates, so this function is not ISO-3601-compliant with either setting of dowOffset. That said, there are other ways than ISO-3601 to compute the week-of-year number (see the bottom of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date) but I'm not sure which of these is being implemented in this function. \nUltimately, I didn't want to choose one of these many options for this library, nor did I want to include support for all of them, so that's why this feature doesn't already exist, even though it seems like it should. I figured I would leave it to users to implement whichever function they wanted. I suspect this is why there isn't already such a function on the Date object also ;)\n. You can use any string (including spaces and capitals) as the key to the aggregators array, so this doesn't require any change as far as I can tell. I've added a new example page here where you can see \"proper labels\" :) http://nicolaskruchten.github.io/pivottable/examples/mps_agg.html\n. Done! https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Used-By\nSuper-happy to see this in use :) \n. Sorry about that... fixed!\n. \nadding image :)\n. Thanks for this pull-request! \nThe vertical display I like a lot, although I think it would look better if the Renderer dropdown was above the unused attributes and level with the top of the pivot table, rather than floating above the pivot table. Also, the attributes are vertically centered within the column when the pivot table gets very tall, which is strange.\nThat said, as I mentioned in the Issue, I'm not a fan of the auto-sorting of the unused attributes, even as an option, so I don't think I want to pull that into the master branch...\n. I polled some users of the UI here at the office and actually the alpha sort makes sense to them, so it's growing on me and I think I would actually accept it, if it was able to make use of the natSort function that's currently in the PivotData class (and would need to be moved out). Sorry for the flip-flop :)\n. Merged, thanks very much  :)\n. Hi Peter,\nYes, it's possible. When you call pivotUI() you may pass in the renderers and aggregators parameters, which are objects whose values are the Renderers/Aggregators and whose keys are their names (see the Parameters). If you don't specify these parameters you get the defaults. You can see an example where I've overridden the default Aggregators here: http://nicolaskruchten.github.io/pivottable/examples/mps_agg.html and the approach for Renderers is the same.\nYou can access the default Renderers and Aggregators under $.pivotUtilities if you want to pass them in under different names.\nHTH,\nNick\n. Excellent! Thanks for the examples @fastcatch \n. @alpertandogan please create a new issues rather than commenting on something that was a closed 4 years ago :). This is a very good point, thanks for bringing it up!\nI would favour the adding of a CSS class like \"pvtFilteredAttribute\" to the li elements which have any value deselected, and for the default styling on that class (i.e. in the examples directory) to be italicized. That seems like the minimal/elegant solution to me :)\n. Thanks for the ccontribution!\nRegarding the callback, it seems like a good idea, feel free to fire off another pull-request (though please take a look at my comment in #83 regarding compiling examples/pivot.js before sending the PR :)\n. I just pushed this change. The callback parameter is called onRefresh\n. Thanks very much!\nSmall request: in future pull-requests, could you please update the file examples/pivot.js to reflect the changes to pivot.coffee, just to keep the repo coherent and to save me a little bit of work?\n. @fastcatch is right: the screenshot on my blog is from an older version of this library. I switched from radio buttons to a dropdown for renderer selection when I started adding lots of renderers :)\nTo answer your question, the same approach that @fastcatch suggested in #84 should work for you: when your radio button changes, you will need to call pivotUI() again on each table with the correct renderer selected. If you want to prevent your users from changing the renderer, you can hide the dropdown via CSS.\n. Great, glad this works for you :)\n. That's what I was going to suggest :)\n. Interesting... Can you show me some example code for your second point so I can understand what you're trying to do and help think about a good solution?\n. Have you tried just creating a decorator/adpater for the existing aggregators? i.e. a function that you pass an aggregator to, and it behaves exactly like that aggregator except that it swaps out the format function for your own?\n. See the fractionOf aggregator for an example of how to 'wrap' an aggregator.\n. Another approach would be to clone/modify the heatmap() function which crawls table cells and applies background colours to the cells based on the values. It would be very simple to colour the cells based on the value alone (the heatmap() code does some more work to divide through by the percentage etc)\n. I see what you're trying to do, but unfortunately this will not be possible: the entire dataset must be scanned for every re-render. How much data are you trying to put through here, in megabytes and in number of records?\n. Yeah, sorry... You may have some luck in transmitting the data in CSV format to the browser and having the browser decode it into JS objects, similar to http://nicolaskruchten.github.io/pivottable/examples/local.html\n. What you say about browsers is interesting... I've found bigger performance issues in Firefox than in Chrome, personally, and I've happily loaded more than 50 megs of data without an issue. (Edit, sorry, I misread my benchmark: this should read 50k records)\n. How many records are in your 230Mb? And how many attributes per record? Also please note my edit in my last comment above: I don't think I've tried loading 50-meg CSVs, it was 50k-record CSVs I was working with.\nYou may also find the discussion in issue #36 to be enlightening.\n. Hi there,\nI'm glad you like this component! Yes, the aggregators are a bit challenging to localize at the moment. The names of the aggregators are just dictionary keys which are very easy to change, but the label of the aggregator (which shows up only in the Google Chart renderer) is inaccessible right now. You would basically need to make a copy of the aggregator with a localized label. Is this what you're talking about?\nI would be happy to see a pull request that makes this easier, if there was a way to do it that doesn't duplicate a ton of code or change the external interfaces too much. What sort of approach were you thinking of?\n. @flamoedo the date formatting can be done using the existing dateFormat deriver function in $.pivotUtilities with the following format string: \"%d/%m/%y\" and I will try to add support later tonight for specifying the decimal and thousands separators.\n. Hi both @diego-vieira and @flamoedo,\nIf you look in the source at the l10nwrapper you'll see that you can now create wrapped, localized versions of existing aggregators by passing in your own number formatter and labelling function. This is tedious, but should be a general solution. I've also exposed the simple numberFormat function in $.pivotUtilities which supports thousands and decimal separators.\n. OK. I'll close this issue for now, and wait to see your eventual pull-request :)\n. @widdi I believe this is a bug. The l10nWrapper is actually an ugly hack and I think I have a way of fixing it but it may take a few days... Sorry!\n. This issue is now addressed via a new locale parameter to the pivotUI() function so no more need for the l10nwrapper... See the Localization wiki page for details.\n. @widdi yes the l10nwrapper has been removed but the pivot() call is fairly easy to localize: just pass in an aggregator with whatever formatting function you want. The Aggregators wiki page has a section at the bottom explaining how to do this. Please let me know if you need a specific example.\n. OK, so the issue with your code above is that $.pivotUtilities.numberFormat(thousandsSep=\".\", decimalSep=\",\") doesn't actually pass those options to numberFormat. That works in Python but not in Javascript :)\nYou need to pass object as an argument: $.pivotUtilities.numberFormat({thousandsSep: \".\", decimalSep: \",\"}) (this changed recently, as part of these localization changes)\n. You are, of course, correct. Apparently I've been doing more Python than Javascript these days! Thanks for letting me know, I've corrected the documentation. Sorry to have led you astray ;)\n. For pivotUI() you will need to use something like var sumAggregator = sum(floatFormat); instead of var sumAggregator = sum(floatFormat)(['tip']) (in keeping with the example you linked).\nSee details here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Aggregators#built-in-aggregators-and-aggregator-templates\n. If you mean in the UI, you will need to drag the column you want to aggregate underneath the aggregator dropdown, see this entry in the FAQ: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#nothing-showing-up-with-sum-or-average-in-the-demo\nIf you mean in code, then you will need to pass in the column name to the aggregator generator before invoking pivot()\nHTH!\n. You're welcome.\n. I'm not sure I understand the main issue, but @fastcatch is there a problem with naming an attribute 'Value' ? How can I reproduce this issue?\n. P.S. anytime you see the \"an error occurred\" message you should check the Javascript console in your browser, as the stack trace will be visible there :)\n. That's awesome! I've just added you to the Used-By page :) \nWe use Aha at Datacratic but I can't see this view when I log in... Is it in an upcoming release?\n. Hi!\n1) is probably possible via CSS\n2) ~~is not possible at all~~ is now possible, see http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/montreal_2014.html for example\n3) I'm not sure what you're asking about specifically... Can you give me some more details please?\n. The getRowKeys() and getColKeys() method on the PivotData class indeed return the row/col keys for the data being rendered, as arrays. For example in your screenshot above, the first row key would be represented as [\"Borough\",\"1\",\"Bronx\"]. You can't get the unique values for the attributes for your whole dataset this way, however, only for the data being rendered.\nI agree that sparklines are pretty cool, and the way to do it would be to write a custom Aggregator component, which shouldn't be too difficult.\n. To replace the 'totals' column with a sparkline, my recommendation would be to write a bit of Javascript which would execute after the Table Renderer has rendered (i.e. run it from the onRefresh() callback) which would use http://omnipotent.net/jquery.sparkline/ to create a sparkline from the data which would be extracted from the table.\n. Sure, I'd be curious to see what it looks like! Are you able to use one of the example datasets I already have in the repo, perhaps the Montreal weather data?\n. Thanks for the bug report! I'll try to find a way to replicate this bug myself, but that might not be super-easy as I don't have access to a windows machine :(\n. I'm downloading a VM image from http://www.modern.ie/ so I should be able to test this myself.\n. Thanks for the update! I've added the DOCTYPE to all the examples, so they should all work now. Please let me know if this is not the case.\n. I've confirmed that all of the examples work now, including the one which was broken in your initial bug report.\nAs I've mentioned in #97 however, none of the examples will work in \"compatibility view\".\n. @jagb-nvl please create a new issue rather than commenting on an old, closed one... thanks!. Thanks for the bug report! Which version of IE does this happen on?\n. I was able to test the example pages on IE10 and IE11 without issue...\n. Might be related to #96 ...\n. OK, thanks. In #96 the problem was due to a missing DOCTYPE... Which example file are you trying to load above which is giving you issues, so I can try to replicate? Have you modified it at all?\n. I was able to replicate the problem in IE9: it happens when IE9 runs in \"compatibility view\", which is toggled on and off by a little 'broken page' icon in the address bar. If you turn this off, things will run fine.\nWith respect to the error you see in d3, I'm sorry but I'm not sure I can help you, as this is an external library... That said, many people use d3 without any problems so I'm not sure what is going on there.\n. \n. Sorry, I don't understand your last question... Have you tried this library on IE8? Are you encountering problems?\n. OK, so just so I'm sure I'm understanding the situation you're seeing:\n- IE9, no compatibility view: works\n- IE9, compatibility view: doesn't work\n- IE8: doesn't work in either mode\nIs this right?\nIn IE8, I'm seeing some of the examples working with no compatibility and some not working, and I'm looking into why.\n. No worries :)\nBut you can confirm that everything works in IE9 when \"compatibility view\" is off?\n. OK, so it looks like for the moment, this library is not particularly compatible with IE8. I'll close this issue and create a new one for IE8 compatibility.\n. The filter parameter in pivot() wasn't a very good idea to begin with, but you're right, to maximize interchangeability between that function and pivotUI() I should really add this parameter.\n. Done! See updated documentation \n. See also this issue: #97 \n. I'm not actively working on it, but I'm happy to accept pull requests!\n. This is now partly solved: in my tests on IE8 the tables render correctly, but the popup menus with the checkboxes cause problems... Clicking on any checkbox causes IE to crash (at least in the virtual machine I'm using)\nAny feedback or help would be greatly appreciated in solving this bug :)\n. Let's carry on the discussion in the pull-request :)\n. Thanks for this pull request!\nI agree with the overall goal of replacing IDs with classes but I think this PR goes a bit too far... I would rather just use hardcoded classes like pvt* rather than make them configurable. This system already has too many configuration options in my opinion and I'm really resisting adding any more.\nAlso, for functional PRs like this, please do not include as much reformatting of whitespace, as it makes the PR harder to read :)\n. OK, cool.\nShould we then close this current pull-request and you can send another one with just the id -> class changes, without the whitespace changes and without the configurable classes?\n. I'll do some thorough testing tomorrow night, I haven't forgotten about this PR :)\n. I tested and merged your changes in commit 1e323170f6e, but the way I did it is preventing GitHub from automatically recognizing this fact, so I'm manually closing this pull request.\nThanks very much :)\n. Thanks for jumping in @fastcatch and @cihadturhan !\nIs there still a question left to answer here or should we close the issue?\n. See example here: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/onrefresh.html\n. Indeed, I don't believe that the filtered values are available anywhere except internally, sorry. Scraping them out of the generated DOM is probably workable, but only so long as the generated DOM doesn't change, which is unlikely, but a possibility nonetheless.\n. Yep, what you're looking for makes perfect sense, it's just not supported right now...\nI'd be happy to accept a pull-request for this. What would be required would be to accept in the options to pivotUI() a list of values to exclude per attribute, and for this to be prepopulated, and stored in pivotUIOptions on refresh, just like the rest of the options to pivotUI().\n. Pull-request #107 addresses this, and the Parameters documentation has been updated. The key to pass into pivotUI() and read out of the data is exclusions.\n. Thanks! See comments inline\n. Hi there! Can you give us a bit more detail on what this issue is about? Are you seeing something wrong or are you asking how you can accomplish a given result?\n. Ah, ok, this is much clearer!\nThere is no built-in way to do what you are looking for, but the Aggregator system is designed specifically to make it possible to do this sort of thing. You'd basically want to copy and modify the built-in listUnique Aggregator. \n. Hi there,\nThe value function is what returns the result, and the push function is how the data gets into the aggregator. The format function is a way of formatting the output of the value function.\nTo answer your question, you will need to use the value function to return both what is in the cells and in the total cells, and you will need to look at the rowKey and colKey arguments to the aggregator generator to determine if you are in a normal cell or a row/col/grand total cell.\nHTH,\nNicolas\n. Hi there!\nAre you able to send me a pull request for this?\nThanks!\n. Here are some instructions, in case you haven't done this before :) \nhttps://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests\n. Hi there!\nIndeed, I hadn't seen this: that pull requests appears to be from nicolaskruchten:master into your branch, which is why I was never notified. What I would need would be the opposite: a pull request from the tip of your branch to nicolaskruchte:master please :)\nThanks,\nNicolas\n. Thanks for the PR. I will close this issue and we can continue the discussion within the PR!\n. PivotTable.js uses a natural sort function, so if you want to sort by date you will need to use a date format like ISO-8061 which looks like this: 2013-12-28.\nTo format a number of seconds as hours, you will likely need a custom Aggregator whose formatting function does what you are looking for.\n. My aim was to build a very simple system where you just feed it the data and any application-specific logic could be injected in via aggregators or renderers as applicable. For the majority of use cases I've seen there is no real need to explicitly indicate the type of the input columns.\nAs to improvements, I'm still adding to this system every once in a while but it's fairly stable and feature-complete at the moment. What sorts of improvements are you looking for?\n. Hehe, ok. For sorting and multiple aggregators you can see the FAQ and for the others, the Renderer injection pattern should be sufficient to provide whatever you're missing :)\n. Thank you for this pull request, I will study it carefully!\nPlease note that it cannot be merged as-is due to conflicts... Can you please merge nicolaskruchten:master into your branch and resolve all the conflicts, so that I can see what the actual changes are?\nAlso, please revert the changes to examples/pivot.css unless they are core to your changes :)\n. OK, I've found some time to take a hard look at this pull request, thanks for the patience!\nUnfortunately, I think that this is a big set of changes to the overall usage pattern of this library, which makes the interactions a fair bit more complex, and I don't think that I would be willing to pull it in at this point. \nI've been thinking a lot about how to handle this concept of multiple aggregators and I think that modifying pivotUI() and PivotData is not the way to go. I think that a new, reportUI() interface is needed, which makes use of an array of unmodified PivotData instances, rather than modifying PivotData to handle arrays of aggregators. Basically I would rather add new, cleaner code to handle this type of case, rather than heavily patch the existing code and interactions.\n. Thanks for this!\n. It will not be possible to build such a table with this library unfortunately. The types of tables you would be able to build would have, say, the values of the Vendor attribute down the side like you do here, but then the values of, say, the CNT_CLIENT attribute across the top, and a single aggregated value in each cell. \nWhat you are looking for would involve having multiple aggragators, which is an often-request feature.\n. I doubt that #30 will be implemented particularly soon, to be honest.\nRegarding the performance question, it depends on the nature of the data, how you're loading it and your hardware, but I would say up to a few tens of thousands of rows is safe, and a hundred thousand is close to the limit. Your mileage may very.\n. no worries, glad you found what you needed in the end!\n. Thanks for chipping in, @bluechips23 and @ricardoaponte ! Indeed the parameter you're looking for is aggregatorName as per the documentation\n. No, unfortunately.\n. Thanks very much!\n. It's a bit complex but you should be able to use the provided l10nWrapper to wrap the aggregators and insert your own formatting function. You can generate a formatting function using the provided numberFormat generator which lets you specify the separators.\n. Unfortunately not at the moment, but I'll see what I can do to fill that gap eventually...\n. Hello Damiaan,\nNone of the built-in aggregators can return dates or boolean values so I'm not sure what you mean... Can you give me an example of what you're trying to do?\nThanks,\nNicolas\n. I see what you mean... The highlighted text actually comes from your source data and so you will need to modify your source data to contain the desired format before inputting it into PivotTable.js.\n. I've just updated the Aggregators documentation to make it clearer how you can control the output format: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Aggregators#built-in-aggregators-and-aggregator-templates\n. Hi there,\nWhich \"update\" are you referring to?\n. OK, can you give us some more information about which version works for you? I.e. which Git hash?\n. Can you provide the contents of the Javascript console? The detailed errors\nare usually logged there...\nOn Thu, Jan 16, 2014 at 10:22 PM, flamoedo notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nThe date of the file that works fine is 11/28/2013, and the one that issue\nthe error is 01/05/2014.\nI don't have the Git hashes because I only download zipped files.\nHope it helps.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/issues/119#issuecomment-32577200\n.\n. Also, could you tell me what OS/Browser/Version you're seeing this error in? Are the examples in the example page working for you?\n. OK, well, thanks for letting me know, but without substantially more detail, I won't be able to help you figure out if you're using it wrong or if there is a bug... \n. Sum simply adds up the value of the field for a given cell. Sum as Fraction of Total takes that sum and divides it through by the sum of all cells. Sum as Fraction of Row/Col does the same thing but uses the Row/Col sum as the divisor. So no, it's not really the same thing as a weighted average :)\n\nFor example, if you have days as columns, and categories as rows, and you're summing something like dollars spent, then sum will show you how much money you spent on each day in each category, whereas sum as fraction of total will show you the percentage of the money that was spent on each day in each category.\nIf you want to do the weighted average of a ratio, then sumOverSum is probably what you want.\nhth,\nNicolas\n. I'm a bit confused about what you are trying to build here: you're trying to compute an average of expenses weighted by... the number of expenses per year? Can you give me an example of the type of data you have and the type of output you are looking for? Or is the example you've given above the final output you're aiming for? If so, I'm a bit confused about what these numbers are for :)\n. OK, so if all you need is the weighted average (and not all the intermediate steps!) then you can use the provided sumOverSum operator, with the parameters (Total Days to Pay, Number of Invoices). What that will compute is sum(Total Days to Pay) / sum(Number of Invoices) which is mathematically exactly the same as the weighted average you're looking for: (500+9000+600+21000+7000)/(200+20+10+500+150) = 43.3\n. Excellent, thanks very much for this, I'll add you to the used-by page :)\n. Have you tried setting cols to Gender and rows to State? Are you working with the drag'n'drop UI generated by pivotUI() or the static pivot() call?\n. You can input your pre-aggregated data into this system, for sure. The only outcome of this is that the 'count' aggregator is less useful, and you'll probably want to use 'sum(frequency)' to show total counts. Computing average quantities does become harder, as you would need some sort of weighted-average aggregator.\n. Hmm... What browser are you using? Do the pivotUI() example pages work for\nyou?\nOn Fri, Jan 24, 2014 at 5:54 AM, andy194 notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHi,\nI'm just reviewing this lib with a view to using it.

OK. I'm not familiar with the MVC framework you are using but the first exception you're hitting suggests to me that jQueryUI isn't being loaded correctly...\n. No worries, glad it's all working :)\n. @PagnaKong please don't ask for help on closed issue threads... If you're having a problem, please create a new issue and I'll see if I can help you. I will need more than just the generic error message, though!\n. Unfortunately this is more or less just a reality of data analysis in the browser... There is a tradeoff between data size and application responsiveness.\n. Can you please provide a test case for a 1000-row dataset which causes slowdowns?\n. So the pivottable does process the whole dataset in order to evaluate the filters. If post-filtering there were only 1k rows left, it makes sense that the pivot-table rendering was quick :) How big was the initial dataset?\n. Yep, just drag the 'Amount Requested' label directly under the 'count' dropdown (in the same box) and choose 'sum' instead of 'count' :)\n. See this image in the tutorial\n. Exclusions are passed from pivotUI to pivot using the filter parameter... Does this answer your question?\n. Hi Ricardo,\n\nThis library is a client-side library, so server-side execution is very much out of scope unfortunately. If you really want to run this code server-side, I suppose you could rig something up using NodeJS or something like that :)\nCheers,\nNicolas\n. Not a bad idea. If you want to build this and send me a pull request I'll happily consider merging it in :)\n. Pull request #144 generously implements this feature :)\n. You can customize which aggregators are shown using the aggregators parameter, and you can even specialize your own, as shown in this example: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/mps_agg.html\nThere is no way of 'inverting the polarity' on the heatmap without editing the code directly unfortunately, but that edit shouldn't be too too hard :)\n. Pull Requests are most welcome :)\n. Thanks @gabegorelick . I'll probably end up creating a little build script that compiles/minifies to a lib directory or somesuch and include that in the package instead. Stand by :)\n. Thanks for the contribution. I registered the package with bower after slightly re-organizing the files in the repo.\nI don't actually use Bower myself so I've no idea if this is packaged up in a useful way, though, so any feedback would be much appreciated.\n. Thanks for the tip, fixed in d179b11 :)\n. The drag'n'drop system being used here is the one from jQueryUI, so you'd have to check their documentation to find the event name you're looking for.\n. Hmmm, not sure I see a common use-case here, but if other people find this useful, I would consider it :)\n. OK. I would happily look at a pull request for this if you can implement it in CoffeeScript: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Contribution-Guidelines\n. If you hide the total column, then nothing will show up if you don't specify columns AND rows.\n. Probably the easiest way to hide totals is to use this CSS:\n.pvtTotal, .pvtTotalLabel, .pvtGrandTotal { display: none;}\n. It's an aesthetic choice. You can always swap in your own number formatter if you want to see the zero :)\n. I've just updated the Aggregators documentation to make it clearer how you can control the output format: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Aggregators#built-in-aggregators-and-aggregator-templates\n. Updating an old issue: this aesthetic choice has been reversed, and zeros are always displayed now when there is data in the cell (i.e. 'count' will never show zero because there is nothing to count).. See also #355 for some other contributed code.. Thanks for the contribution! I'll study it and see what I can upstream into the coffeescript version :)\n. Agreed. Your PR #144 and my last commit 10e952a together resolve this issue pretty well I'd say :)\nThanks!\n. If you hide the total column, then nothing will show up if you don't specify columns AND rows.\n. Adding this CSS to your stylesheet should do the trick\n.pvtTotal, .pvtTotalLabel, .pvtGrandTotal { display: none;}\n. This looks excellent, thank you very much! \nI will merge it now and then make a small tweak: the \"filter results\" string should go into the configuration as a default, so it can be overridden for people who want to localize into another language than english.\n. Thanks for the feedback! unfortunately, the label is a function, and will only return something reasonable once the attributes to be aggregated over are specified. For example, label for the sum aggregator is \"Sum of X\" where X is the attribute being summed. The problem is that X is not known at the time this dropdown is being generated, so calling this function here doesn't make sense.\nIf the problem that you're trying to solve is that you'd like different labels for the aggregators, this is pretty easy with the system as it is: just pass in a new dictionary of aggregators with different keys :)\n. Yep, but you'll have to create a 'derived column' like I did for the Age Bin attribute in the example here: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/mps.html (view source to see how it's done)\n. I'm having trouble replicating what you're seeing... What OS/browser combo is that?\nDoes setting the checkContainer width to 100% instead of 280px resolve the issue?\n. OK, lmk please, and I'll try to fix things up!\n. OK, thanks very much, I've pushed the change with width: 100%\n. Oh, and regarding the 'close' button, I like the idea but I'm torn about the semantics: does closing imply \"ok\" or does it imply \"undo the changes I just made and close the window\" ?\n. Right. The challenge is that in order to implement this, I must implement some 'undo' functionality which resets the checkboxes to the way they were before you opened the filter box, which is a bit more involved than just CSS, but I'll see what I can do. Can you submit a new issue with the 'close button' idea?\n. How about I remove all CSS classes which clash with Bootstrap's (i.e. table etc), and then users of the PivotTable can use jQuery to add in all Bootstrap classes programatically as desired?\n. I think what I will do is remove all classnames that don't start with pvt and if anyone wants to add their own styling they can add some decoration calls after rendering like $(\".pvtTable\").addClass(\"x\"). That's fully generic and doesn't require a bunch of additional explicit code just for this.\n. OK, I've just removed all CSS classes that don't start with 'pvt' so there should be no conflict with various CSS frameworks now. If you want to use their classes, you'll have to add them post-render using jQuery.\nFurthermore, over the past few commits almost all inline CSS has been stripped out and replaced with classes, so it should be possible to swap in your own CSS classes instead of the built-in ones.\n. Thanks!\nTo answer your question, no, addClass() isn't live, so every time the table is re-rendered you'll have to reapply the classes. The pivotUI() function takes an ~~onRender~~onRefresh callback that fires whenever a new table is rendered so you can put all your addClass() calls in there and your classes should be reapplied after every render.\n. Sorry, the callback is called onRefresh not onRender\n. Mostly I do server-side filtering/aggregating of data before sending the results to the client for display with this library. The easiest/most efficient way to do this is using the query facility of whatever back-end data store you are using for your data: SQL/relational or NoSQL.\nOne thing to note is that this PivotTable.js library is meant to be a server-agnostic client-side library, and I'm not very likely to accept pull requests which depend on a specific server-side implementation :)\n. Yep, I understand. Unfortunately, I expect that this would be very difficult to do with this library, as it depends on jQuery which operates on a DOM. Essentially, you would have to have something fairly close to a 'headless' browser running on your server to execute the PivotTable.js code, after which point you could serialize the output to HTML and send it to the client. There are various NodeJS-based ways to do this server-side stuff but I have no particular recommendations on which way to go.\nNote also that it's not clear how the client-side drag'n'drop interactions of the current PivotTable.js code would interact with this server-side component...\n. I appreciate what you want to do, even if I don't appreciate my project being called \"useless\", but having looked closely at this question in the past there is no such well-defined point in the code today and I believe that the changes required to get there are too invasive for me to want to tackle at the moment...\nThe nature of the problem is that the input data is processed twice: once in pivotUI() to scan for the metadata and once in pivot() to do the aggregations. One could imagine wrapping the data in some sort of wrapper which provided the metadata and aggregations either by scanning through an in memory object or by querying a server but this is a big change from the current API.\n\nOn Dec 1, 2016, at 08:30, Martijn van der Lee notifications@github.com wrote:\nI really like this project, but without server integration, it's pretty much useless for any practical applications I can think of.

Most people get by just fine by grabbing a largish dataset from a server (e.g. 10k rows, often the summary of a much larger, say 10M-row, dataset) and loading it into the PivotTable once and then letting the client handle the last stage of aggregation. This is performant up to around 100k rows.\nOn Dec 1, 2016, at 11:14, Nicolas Kruchten nicolas@kruchten.com wrote:\nI appreciate what you want to do, even if I don't appreciate my project being called \"useless\", but having looked closely at this question in the past there is no such well-defined point in the code today and I believe that the changes required to get there are too invasive for me to want to tackle at the moment...\nThe nature of the problem is that the input data is processed twice: once in pivotUI() to scan for the metadata and once in pivot() to do the aggregations.

In my experience, pivoting usually happens on a much-lower-cardinality dataset than the raw, due to aggregation rather than filtering. Are you able to pre-aggregate your millions of rows a bit before passing them to the pivot table?\n\n\nFor example, the original use-case for this library was analyzing millions of events across weeks of time, but we only loaded a fact table which contained a few categorical dimensions, and the hour in which the even occurred. There are only about 4000 hours in 6 months, so with a few low-cardinality dimensions, and assuming that not every permutation of the dimensions occurs in every hour, you can get pretty far with 100k rows! YMMV of course.. This issue is fairly well addressed in the FAQ so I'm closing it: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#server-side-integration. @nirvana-msu the problem is actually a bit more complicated because in order to build the UI itself we need access to the data, specifically we need to know about all the columns and all the possible values for the columns.. You should be able to just load that straight in, but you will be limited in terms of the tables you can generate. What sorts of output are you looking to generate?\n. There is no built-in way to do this, but you could write a new Renderer based on the built-in Table Renderer with that functionality.\n. Unfortunately this is not possible, no.\n. see #236 \n. There is now a mechanism to override the natural sort either on a per-attribute basis or globally. See documentation for the sorters parameter and the example which shows how to sort month names without leading numbers.\n. 2.5 years later... I finally got around to implementing a proper 'cancel' button on the filter box :). Thanks for this! \nIt's a fair number of changes all at once and I'm working on the CSS class names right now so I don't think I will be able to merge this in as-is, but I'll see what I can cherry-pick out of it to merge in by hand.\n. Hi again,\nI've just pushed the last set of CSS-related changes I was contemplating (in response to #149) but they might be hard to merge into your branch... Let me know if you manage to and then I'll take another look at merging this PR into master!\nCheers,\nNicolas\n. Duplicate of #48 and #44...\nI'm not sure how you would want sorting by column to work, given that there are rowspans which will get in the way...\n. For example, how would you sort this table?\n\n. To be clear, there are two types of sorting: sorting by header, which is pretty easy, even in the presence of row-spanned headers, and sorting by the actual values, which is much more challenging, and in fact it's not clear what sorting scheme is desired.\nWhat type of sorting are you wanting?\n. Yes, there is an example here:\nhttp://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/gchart.html\nOn Wed, Apr 2, 2014 at 4:45 AM, veica notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nDoes anybody has example with google charting Pivot Table?\nI have experience in Excel, but now I have to switch to Google Chart and\nI'm having very difficult time producing the same result.\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/issues/157\n.\n.

Hmm, I wrote a reply but Github seems to have eaten it :(\n\nThanks for the kind words about this project!\nI agree that a scatterplot might be a good addition to this library but I'm not clear on how to construct a pivot table whose output is compatible with the input to Google Charts.

Thanks for your comments, both!\nI'll see what I can do about implementing support for scatter/bubble charts with Google charts along the lines above, which make a fair bit of sense.\nYour thoughts about a more generalized visualization system are interesting, and I've also thought about how to extend this library in that direction, but I think I would likely create a new project to do this rather than making such big modifications to a system whose primary virtue is its simplicity :)\nRegarding drill-through, there is already an issue open for this here #33 \nRegarding HighCharts, @bluechips23 would you be willing to contribute your renderer plugins to this project under an MIT license?\n. I ended up building a Scatter Chart in both the Google Chart and C3 renderers. Feel free to check it out here: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/rcsvs.html\n. See this Frequently-Asked Question: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#multiple-aggregators-in-the-ui-and-renderers\n. The license at the bottom of the Readme is the MIT license, as taken from here: http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT :)\n. (i've just updated the Readme to make this clearer)\n. This isn't possible right now but it should be fairly easy to modify the gchart_renderers.coffee file to support it :)\n. Yep, there is an onRefresh callback you can pass in to pivotUI() which gets called with the config object as an argument every time the table is updated. Additionally, the config object is added as a data attribute called pivotUIOptions to the element you called pivotUI() on.\n. See example here: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/onrefresh.html\n. I didn't add these in due to the lack of symmetry between column and row headers: thead would only include column headers.\n. I'm sorry, but your question is not clear enough for me to answer. Can you provide more details?\n. There is another aggregator called intSum which truncates the decimal points.\n. Hi, sorry for the very late response, this issue slipped through the cracks for me...\nDo you still have this issue? If so, did you try to copy the example CSS as well as Javascript?\n. Ok, do you see the 'ok' button at the bottom? That's the only way to close that dialog...\n\nOn Jun 24, 2014, at 10:08, ga0430 notifications@github.com wrote:\nSorry, I was new to Pivot table and the grid display is still not working for me. After selecting the filter (down arrow), popup window with field values opens up, but I do not see any close button. Please advise. Thanks\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. That is quite strange. Are you able to see the buttons on this example page? http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/mps.html\n. This library always sorts using a natural-sort function, so if you want dates sorted chronologically you will have to format them in something like ISO8601 (i.e. YYYY-MM-DD).\n. Also: when I have a column for months, for example, I use a format like \"01-Jan\", \"02-Feb\" to get the sorting to come out right.\n. It isn't possible to avoid aggregation, unfortunately, but you can write an aggregator which implements your logic (concatenating strings or just choosing one to display or something like that). Check out the code for the listUnique aggregator for inspiration :)\n. Check out the hiddenAttributes parameter here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Parameters#pivotuiinput-options-overwrite\n. This is a pretty big deal. I'll see what I can do about making this 1.7-compatible while keeping it compatible with older versions.\n\nThanks for the heads-up\n. This should be fixed in master now :)\n. This issue is now addressed via a new locale parameter to the pivotUI() function so no more need for the l10nwrapper... See the Localization wiki page for details.\n. The onRefresh parameter to pivotUI gets called for every refresh and the argument to that function contains all you needs: renderer etc. \n. Hi there,\nI'm confused about what part of the code you're looking at... The onRefresh parameter is called back not with subopts but with pivotUIOptions which indeed does contain aggregatorName and rendererName... See line 706 of pivot.coffee here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/blob/master/pivot.coffee#L706\n. See example here: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/onrefresh.html\n. In order to do this you will need to write your own aggregator: See the Aggregators wiki page for details.\n. I've just updated the Aggregators documentation to make it clearer how you can control the output format: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Aggregators#built-in-aggregators-and-aggregator-templates\n. a) there is the onRefresh function you can pass it as a parameter\nb) the Renderers system is the only hook into per-cell rendering at this time...\n. Glad to know the onRefresh system meets your needs! I'm not sure what in the current Renderer system falls short of what you need, so I'm open to patches but I'd like to understand your use-case a bit more first...\n. I think I mistyped when answering your question about per-cell rendering... The way to do this is not to implement your own Renderer but rather to implement your own Aggregator with the appropriate format function.\n. I've just updated the Aggregators documentation to make it clearer how you can control the output format: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Aggregators#built-in-aggregators-and-aggregator-templates\n. Thanks for the bug report, and you're welcome :)\n. Neat, thanks!\n. Fixed in 1ff839d32c4a72\n. Thanks for sharing! I've added you to the Used-by wiki page :)\n. OK, what have you tried which isn't working?\n. You'll have to look at the documentation for the jQuery CSV library to see if toArray actually does what is being implied here (i.e. that it will fetch that path). I believe that you are trying to parse the string \"mps.csv\" as CSV formatted-data, which it clearly isn't, and that you will have to actually retrieve the contents of that file as a string to pass into toArray but I encourage you to verify this yourself :)\n. I've added an example of this for you here: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/mps_csv.html\n. Hi Ashwin,\nHave you upgraded to the very latest version? It will automatically switch to listing the fields on the right-hand side vertically if there are too many of them horizontally, and you can also force this behaviour.\nRight now there is no way to constrain the width of the UI or table, although this is something we could look into or I would be willing to accept a pull-request for :)\nCheers,\nNicolas\n. Thanks for your kind words :)\nI don't have a donation account myself but I would encourage you to make a donation to Doctors Without Borders or the Electronic Frontier Foundation instead if you're into this sort of thing!\n. Thanks for the suggestion! The heatmap function is actually fairly simple so you might be able to make a copy of it and tweak it a bit, or if you'd like to send a pull-request with a configurable version I'd be happy to take a look :)\n. Thanks for this! I'm getting married soon so I won't have a ton of time to look at this until September, but I just wanted to let you know I'm grateful and I'm not ignoring you :)\n. Sorry this dropped off my radar... This is indeed a good idea. I'll see about getting a version of it ported in :)\n. Related to #236 \n. I ended up solving this problem in the opposite way: the output is displayed just like the input but you can selectively override the sorting.\nThere is now a mechanism to override the natural sort either on a per-attribute basis or globally. See documentation for the sorters parameter and the example which shows how to sort month names without leading numbers.\n. Thanks for this! I'm getting married soon so I won't have a ton of time to look at this until September, but I just wanted to let you know I'm grateful and I'm not ignoring you :)\n. In response to your first point, thanks for letting me know that IE8 uses innerText instead of textContent. However, using jQuery in this part of the code causes major performance problems, which is why I unrolled it all into direct DOM calls, so we need to find another solution... Perhaps a small function which tests for innerText vs textContent?\nYour second point is well-taken, and we'll have to do a full scrub to find all the places I did this (I think there are probably more than the ones you've fixed here)...\n. OK cool, I was looking for something simple like that. I removed the last lingering reference to innerText to fix #196 so I think the only place this hack would be needed would be in the TableRenderer where we currently use textContent.\nI don't really have ready access to an IE8 instance at the moment so I can't try out the modifications myself... Are you in a position to try this hack and the other fixes for jQuery element creation with IE8?\n. My proposal for a comprehensive fix is here, and I welcome your feedback: #257\n. Issues addressed in #257 \n. Thanks for this! I'm getting married soon so I won't have a ton of time to look at this until September, but I just wanted to let you know I'm grateful and I'm not ignoring you :)\n. Sorry I've left this hanging for so long... After some thought, I don't want to split up this library into little pieces, and the PivotData object can be used to do similar things as-is, so I think I'll leave things as they are.. Thanks for this! I'm getting married soon so I won't have a ton of time to look at this until September, but I just wanted to let you know I'm grateful and I'm not ignoring you :)\n. Thanks again for the contribution, but commit f6364840b78 is my preferred way of implementing exporting: via an optional Renderer component which directly accesses the underlying PivotData object rather than by patching the core and parsing the output of another Renderer.\n. @LaurensRietveld thanks for the feedback!\n- I should probably add the totals columns back in, you're right that it's inconsistent\n- yes, it's intentional as it simplifies importing into many tools which expect a single row of headers... having multiple rows of headers makes things complicated in a layout like TSV which doesn't have intuitive support for multi-row/multi-column cells. I tried various options that didn't do this but I always ended up with either a blank row or a blank column in the layout and it wasn't very satisfying\nI'm very open to suggestions as to alternative ways of doing this, though!\n. Thanks for this contribution! I have very serious reservations about including this feature, as I mentioned in issue #66 because depending on the shape of the input you give, the pie chart output ends up being very wrong (i.e. Google Charts does a sum in an unintuitive way...). I would love some thoughts about how to support this in a safe/non-misleading way.\n. I'm sorry, I don't understand your question... Can you please give me some more details, and perhaps an example?\n. This system doesn't have any particular print functionality, so you will have to print using your browser's printing system, and you can use CSS to create a print-friendly stylesheet.\n. I believe you're looking for the exclusions parameter to pivotUI(), would let you hide all but red/white/blue. (unfortunately this is a negative parameter rather than a positive one: you will have to list everything to exclude, rather than listing everything to include)\n. There is no support for C3 at the moment, but it shouldn't be too hard to use the gchart_renderers file as a starting point to add support :)\n. See also FAQ answer here: Supporting Charting Library X\n. Partial support implemented here: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/c3.html\n. C3 charts are now fully supported.\n. Thanks! This behaviour appears to vary from OSX to Windows, unfortunately :(\n. @hajovonta are you on Windows?\n. Oh, just because the behaviour appears to be different on OSX... It doesn't pick up the merged cells the same way.\n. I've implemented a new Renderer aimed at making copy-pasting to Excel more reliable: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/mps_export.html\n. Unfortunately the derivers will not be helpful for you here. Your best bet would be to prefix your month names with numbers, like [\"01-Jan\", \"02-Feb\", ...] etc\n. There is now a mechanism to override the natural sort either on a per-attribute basis or globally. See documentation for the sorters parameter and the example which shows how to sort month names without leading numbers.\n. Fixed! Thanks for the bug report!\n. You might be able to get partway to a solution via CSS but at the moment there is no way to freeze headers...\n. The onRefresh callback is called after every UI change and contains the exclusions values which you are looking for...\n. Yes, by passing in the exclusions parameter to pivotUI()\n. I'm glad this system is useful!\nUnfortunately you cannot get the 'selected' attribute values, only the 'excluded' ones, and yes, you will have to re-render the whole table if you want to modify the excluded values 'from the outside'.\n. Glad you made it work :)\n. See example here: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/onrefresh.html\n. The relevant parameter is 'vals' and it takes an array of strings.\n\nOn Aug 17, 2014, at 20:28, Jason Southwell notifications@github.com wrote:\nIf I want the pivot to render initially with Sum over Sum on FieldB over FieldC, how would that look in the options passed in to PivotUI?\nI believe aggregatorName would be set to \"Sum over Sum\" but can't seem to find how to set the fields that apply to that aggregate.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. No one is working on this that I know of, but ChartJS is indeed quite pretty :)\n. See also FAQ answer here: Supporting Charting Library X\n. The official way to do localization doesn't require modification of pivot.js and is documented here: Localization :)\n. Can I see your br localization file? I'm a bit confused...\n. OK, I see what you mean :)\n\nCan we close this issue or are there remaining questions to be answered?\n. I think your solution is great :)\n. @Ahmetgnczl please do not post unrelated comments to closed issues :)\nI'll respond to you in the other issue you created #874 . Unfortunately this is definitely a browser issue, and in fact many non-browser systems (R, SciPy, Excel) will also choke or slow down a lot manipulating a million-plus row dataset :(\n. Instead of printing the data URI on the command line, can you try doing something like window.location=chart_div.innerHTML to actually render the PNG?\n. This is a neat solution, but I think it's a bit out of scope for this library, so if you need this as a feature in your app, I would recommend that you add it in externally to the PivotTable.js output, as I'm not sure where it would go within the current setup...\n. I see you've already closed this PR but just FYI I feel that the fact that one only needs to load a very small number of JS files to use this library is a big asset so I would need to be convinced of the benefits of this approach before merging such a PR in :)\n. Ah ok I see. GitHub's UI makes it too easy to accidentally send PRs farther upstream than intended, I've done it before as well :)\n. Unfortunately I don't think any tutorials exist for anything quite this specific. Feel free to use the internal PivotData data structure from this library as inspiration though!\n. This is also related: #272\n. @mreddimasi if you're seeing that error, it means you have not loaded the pivot.js file.\n. I'm not really well-positioned to support this AngularJS contribution, so I'll defer to the original author....\n. @OscarAgreda Thanks! Are you able to create a Gist at https://gist.github.com  with this instead of posting an attachment or screenshots of code? I think it would work better :) \n. Glad it all worked out :)\n. You just need to load c3.min.js somewhere... The C3 example has that: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/c3.html\n. Sorry, I have no idea how to deal with C3/Require/Angular integration issues, I just build the PivotTable :) Perhaps StackOverflow would be able to help you with this particular integration task.\n. Does anyone on this thread want to help me build an \"official\" Angular connector for this library? I'm getting a lot of questions about it but I'm a React guy not an Angular guy so I'd need a bit of guidance :). @anandgupta08 unfortunately I'm no longer really available to work on an Angular port... but if you want to make one I might be able to advise a bit :). The drag'n'drop functionality is provided by jQueryUI's sortable system: http://jqueryui.com/sortable/\nIt's wired up by selector here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/blob/master/pivot.coffee#L770 so to 'freeze' something you just have to exclude it from the sortable call\n. I'm finally looking at this pull-request but from what I can tell in the link you provided, this looks like it's a fix for IE7 rather than IE8... can you confirm?\n. My proposal for a comprehensive fix is here, and I welcome your feedback: #257 \n. Issues addressed in #257 \n. Yes, right now the field names are read from the first object in the array and all subsequent objects must have the same fields. Any additional fields in subsequent objects are ignored. I'm not sure what a good solution is for this, but likely the code in this range will need changes: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/blob/master/pivot.coffee#L526-L540\nCheers,\nNicolas\n. I think I'm ok with not having this functionality within this plugin, and letting people implement it outside as you have, but thanks!\n. Sorry for the late response! The best way to do this would be to use the Derived Attributes system with the built-in dateFormat deriver.\n. Issues addressed in #257 \n. This seems like a good solution to this problem, but I'm reluctant to accept the PR as it seems like a fairly uncommon problem...\n. So how about this: let's just switching to using innerHTML instead of textContent everywhere in that function, and not add an option for it. We already use innerHTML all over the place in that function, and some older IE's don't support textContent anyways so it'll allow people to use HTML where they like and remove yet another IE incompatibility :) \nThoughts?\n. I should add that in order to do this, I'll have t modify pivotUI() as well otherwise the little checkbox-dropdowns will not look good.\n. My proposal for a comprehensive fix is here, and I welcome your feedback: #257\n. Issues addressed in #257 \n. I've never seen this before... Are you able to replicate the issue on any of the example pages at http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples ?\nIf not, then the problem will be in the HTML/JS being generated on your page and I will need to see it in order to comment. Are you able to put it into a JSFiddle or something like that?\n. Hmm. Someone reported a possible fix for ASP-related problems... Maybe you can try it? https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/issues/178\n. Sorry, that link isn't super-clear: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/issues/178#issuecomment-53925871\n. I'd be happy to include a pivot.es.coffee if you can provide one :)\n. Sorry for the long delay... Thanks very much!\n. Unfortunately the link you mentioned doesn't work for me, but there was a pull request I closed related to this: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/pull/111. Is that the code you mean?\n. After further thought, I still don't like the approach in PR #111 and the code link above doesn't work, so I'm closing this issue.\n. @AbdulGool's answer is right except that recent versions of the UI don't require you to drag the vals under the dropdown: a second dropdown is generated now :)\n. There isn't a built-in way to do what you asked for in the initial issue, unfortunately, but there are various ways to bolt it on...\nYour IPython Notebook hack is neat! I recently put this little function together to solve the same problem, but with a popup:\n``` python\ndef interactive_pivottable(df):\n    import StringIO, uuid\n    from IPython.display import Javascript\n    from IPython.core.display import display\ns = StringIO.StringIO()\ndf.to_csv(s, index=False)\n\nwith open('pivottable.html', 'w') as outfile:\n    outfile.write(\n        \"\"\"\n        <style>* {font-family: Verdana}</style>\n        <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/dist/pivot.css\">\n        <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/ext/jquery-1.8.3.min.js\"></script>\n        <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/ext/jquery-ui-1.9.2.custom.min.js\"></script>\n        <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/ext/jquery.csv-0.71.min.js\"></script>\n        <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/dist/pivot.js\"></script>\n        <script>\n        $(function(){\n            $(\"#pivot\").pivotUI(\n                $.csv.toArrays( $(\"#data\").text() )\n            );\n        })\n        </script>\n        <div id=\"pivot\">Processing...</div>\n        <div id=\"data\" style=\"display: none;\">%s</div>\n        \"\"\" % s.getvalue()\n        )\n\ndisplay(Javascript(\"window.open('files/pivottable.html?%s')\"% uuid.uuid4()))\n\n``\n. A relevant example here: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/onrefresh.html\n. Please let me know if this is enough information to close this issue, as it's kind of wandered away from the original question being asked :)\n. Oh, I think I never really read the original question fully... What are you looking for beyond something likejavascript:$('#the_container_id').pivotUI(input, {params go here} )`?\n. OK :)\n. Cool! I recently created this package as well, to make this kind of thing easier: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pivottablejs (demo can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbrRrXiWBKc )\n. This is a good idea, although it might be confusing for items to appear/disappear from the filter lists.. Might be better to grey them out instead of removing them altogether.\n. I think there's a big potential for confusion there, yes.\nThe other major issue is that we essentially have to rerun through the dataset an additional time in order to implement this feature: we already process the dataset once in the renderer but in order to implement this we would have to re-run through the dataset just to regenerate the list of filters, every time one changes, which would have a major performance penalty.\n. I'm going to need a lot more context than that to be able to help you :)\n. Looks like it works fine for me on Chrome/OSX here: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/mps_csv.html\n. OK, great!\n. I actually wouldn't recommend modifying the pivot.js file: I would create a custom aggregator (based on the existing average one) in a different file and use that. This way you can upgrade pivot.js without having to merge in your changes.\n. Probably the easiest thing is to allow only one aggregator, which operates only on sales. There's an example which can help you here: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/mps_agg.html\nYou basically want to pass in an aggregators parameter like this:\njavascript\naggregators: {\n    \"Sum of Sales $\":   function() { \n        return $.pivotUtilities.aggregatorTemplates.average()([\"NAME OF COLUMN\"]) \n    }\n}\nThe aggregators dropdown will still be there, but it would only contain \"Sum of Sales $\" or something like that.\n. Check out the hiddenAttributes parameter, I believe it does exactly what you want: Parameters\njavascript\nhiddenAttributes: [\"NAME OF COLUMN\"]\n. You're welcome! Happy to help :)\n. This is as documented, see here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Parameters\nThe pivot() function takes a filter function parameter instead, and the exclusions parameter to pivotUI() is used to create such a function which it passes down to pivot()\n. The onRefresh callback essentially allows you to do this. It is called with the full JSON required to restore the table.\nSee also #220 \n. See example here: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/onrefresh.html\n. Indeed, RTL support is missing at this point. What would this entail? basically moving the row headers to the right-hand side instead of the left-hand side of the table?\n. Thanks. See also other options under #58 \n. Use the aggregator parameter.\n. Have you read the documentation here? https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Aggregators\n. You can use the built-in aggregators: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Aggregators#built-in-aggregators-and-aggregator-templates\n. @alanKhosro please create a new issue and I'd be happy to help you! Commenting on old issues like this creates unnecessary and unwelcome notifications for previous issue participants :). See the onRefresh callback parameter to pivotUI(), which fires every time the table is rendered (effectively, every time the user changes something in the UI)\n. See example here: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/onrefresh.html\n. Hi @ramasamynk \nPlease create a new issue for this question so that we may discuss in more detail.\nNicolas\n. Yes, pivot() and pivotUI() have different parameters: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Parameters\n. something like:\njavascript\nfilter: function(record){ return record[\"QT\"] > 0; }\n. Thanks! Glad you're enjoying this library :)\n. Thanks very much!\n. There is no mechanism to override the sort function at the moment, but I would accept a pull request to create a new option to override the default one.\n. There is now a mechanism to override the natural sort either on a per-attribute basis or globally. See documentation for the sorters parameter and the example which shows how to sort month names without leading numbers.\n. Updating an old issue: this aesthetic choice has been reversed, and zeros are always displayed now when there is data in the cell (i.e. 'count' will never show zero because there is nothing to count).. I have no real way of checking whether these translations are correct, but I'll trust you :) Thanks!\n. You don't need to modify the code for this, this parameter already exists! It's called onRefresh in the pivotUI() options object. You can pass in a function and that function is called back every time the UI is refreshed. Check out the parameters documentation and search for onRefresh: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Parameters#pivotuiinput-options-overwrite-locale\n. See example here: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/onrefresh.html\n. I don't think anyone is working on this, but I'd encourage you to look at the FAQ entry about scatterplots, as it applies here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#pie-charts-and-scatterplots-in-the-google-chart-renderers\nBasically, I don't believe that a pivot table is the right tool for creating scatterplots...\n. I'm not sure how I can help with this... Have you tried this PivotTable.js library standalone with the older jQuery to see if that's the issue?\nWhat's the nature of the failure? What does your console say? Can you point me to any full version of this code so I can take a look?\n. Interesting idea. How would you define the identity operator? We already have a listUnique so I guess you would want a variation on that?\n. OK, now I see what you're trying to do. Unfortunately, I think that the PivotData structure underlying this library is not appropriate for what you'd like :(\n. That definitely sounds like you'll need a custom renderer...\n. Unfortunately not. I think this library is probablt not a very good fit for what you are trying to do... Sorry :(\n. This is kind of a big ask as stated... what specifically are you having trouble understanding?\n. I don't think that reading the generated code will get you very far, as you're finding... Try reading the CoffeeScript version. It's syntactically a little bit different from Javascript but semantically identical. I think that this is the code you're looking for: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/blob/master/pivot.coffee#L275\n. You'll have to modify the code to overwrite the naturalSort function in order to achieve this.\n. Duplicate of #236\n. There is now a mechanism to override the natural sort either on a per-attribute basis or globally. See documentation for the sorters parameter and the example which shows how to sort month names without leading numbers.\n. I'm not sure what you're looking for here... A new CSS file or something?\n. After a bit of testing, the CSS provided with this library is broadly Bootstrap-compatible, so I'm closing this issue.\n. Not easily. The way this works under the hood is that it constructs a PivotData object and passes it to a renderer, but the structure of the PivotData object is not really anything like the JSON you're looking for... \n. Thanks for this very detailed bug report!\nUnfortunately, however, I don't believe this is a problem with the PivotTable.js library but rather the code in the application around it. This library's output is only the <table cellpadding=\"5\"> but not the table around it...\nCan you confirm?\n. I think I'm having a little trouble understanding the issue here. Can you post some sample code please?\nIf the hours with no data are not in the original input, there is no way for them to appear in the output. Are these hours in the input?\n. You'll need to create a custom set of aggregators with a different numberFormatter, similar to localizing to a different locale: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Localization\n. This is not going to be possible: if you have no matching rows in your input, the UI has no way of knowing what to display.\n. The purpose of the exclusions parameter is basically to populate the checkboxes in the dropdown in the UI, but what you're wanting is for those records to appear essentially nowhere in the UI. Your best bet in this case is to filter those records out before you pass them into pivotUI(). This will also have the side-effect of having everything run faster...\n. There's no option to do this, but you can hide those cells with CSS.\n. OK. Are we OK with closing this issue or did you still want me to take a look at it? If it's the latter, I'm going to need some code to work with to replicate the issue as your initial description isn't clear enough for me to replicate...\n. If you'd like me to help troubleshoot something, please do post some code and sample data that replicates the issue.\nOn the topic of 'lots of data', yes, we have looked at this issue before: #36, #90, #203 \n. Thanks for this pull request! I'm interested in merging it in but I'd like some more information about how/why it works... Can you point me to any documentation/best practices doc that describes what you're doing here please?\n. OK, I understand what's happening here, thanks for the clarification.\nWith respect to this PR, a bit of feedback:\n1. This project uses 4 spaces instead of tabs to indent, whereas this PR changes this... I would ask that you stick with the existing convention please :)\n2. I think it would be much clearer to split out the loader-function at the top into a named function like callWithJQuery = (f) -> ... or something like that, as it took me a fair bit of time to understand the logic being used there\nWith respect to your other questions, I would indeed be open to a PR that adds a minimal build system and package.json file to publish to NPM, thank you!\n. Thanks for this! I'll take a close look and try to merge this and the other PR this week. \nJust for my own education, what does it look like to use NPM for client-side libraries like this? Does the other PR make this library NPM-compatible in some way? I've got extensive experience using NPM for managing Node.js packages but none for client-side stuff...\nAlso, do we need to declare jQuery and jQueryUI as dependencies in the package.json?\n. Ah also, can we get this to bump the version in pivottable.jquery.json as well? Starting to accumulate a lot of little packaging files :)\n. This is pretty awesome, thanks very much :)\nOne thing though, gulp minor did everything except pushing the tag to Github, which I had to do manually with git push origin v1.3.0... Any way to get that to be automatic?\n. Awesome! Thanks again for all the contributions this week :)\n. Glad you like this library :)\nThere's no option to do what you're looking for, but you can hide those cells with CSS pretty easily...\n. Great!\n. The charting library in use here is the Google Charts library, so you'd have to look at the docs for that to see if you can hook up some sort of drilldown.\nIn terms of disabling double-click behaviour, you can just comment out the dblclick event handler in the gcharts_renderers file.\n. Please see this question in the FAQ: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#drilldown-in-built-in-table-renderer\n. Good point about backwards compatibility... I check the specific case of \"x < y\" and on Chrome/OSX it seems to work just fine. That might be browser-dependent, though. In any case, if anyone was trying to make a table summarizing the usage of HTML tags, this is certainly not backwards compatible. I think I'm OK with that. I'll mention it in the release notes. I don't think that many people are upgrading to the latest version very often to be honest.\nRe coding style: thanks for the tip! Someday I'll go through and standardize the style throughout and I'll likely use that :)\n. This PR also addresses #213 and mostly addresses #100 \n. Unfortunately this is not possible with this library: the shape of the data that this library generates is not compatible with Google Maps geo charts\n. yes, if you need this feature you will likely need to modify this library.\n. Hi,\nI would really appreciate it if you could create a separate issue with this question, as it is unrelated to the original topic of this current issue, and this current issue is closed.\nThanks\n. @LittleHamster please create new issues rather than commenting on old ones, as the latter generates notifications to everyone on the thread.\nTo answer your question, as I stated above the output of PivotTable.js' aggregation cannot match the inputs required by Google Charts' geo types, regardless of what your input CSV might look like.. This is not possible at the moment, unfortunately. See this FAQ entry: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#multiple-aggregators-in-the-ui-and-renderers\nDuplicate of #73 \n. @thearyoun please open a different issue rather than commenting on an unrelated one.\n. (closing as duplicate)\n. Thanks for the heads-up! Should now be fixed, sorry about the regression.\n. Just to confirm: the screenshot above is what you see when you visit http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/simple_ui.html ?\nCan you also confirm which browser and operating system you are using?\n. It seems like your AngularJS code is causing a problem here, but without a link to the full system which is displaying an error, there isn't much I can do to help you.\n. Unfortunately I won't be able to help you unless I have some sample code to work with. It sounds like your codeigniter setup is introducing problems with this library...\n. Not necessarily, but if you are not seeing problems locally and when you run it within a Codeigniter setup you are seeing problems, then something about your particular setup is causing problems. This is a client-side library, which is not capable of returning a \"500 (internal server error)\" response so the problem must lie somewhere within the rest of your code.\n. OK, so it sounds like you've hit the data size limit of your client or server. How many rows is \"many data\" where it no longer works? And when it doesn't work, are you still seeing \"500 internal server error\" problems? If so, the problem is in the PHP side of things, not in PivotTable.js\n. \"500 internal server error\" is a problem within your server for sure, and is unrelated to PivotTable.js, which runs exclusively in the browser. You will need to look at your server or application logs to find out what is the cause of these errors.\n\"google not defined\" is likely because you have not included <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://www.google.com/jsapi\"></script> in the <head> of your HTML.\n. Do you see this issue with any of the examples here http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/ ? If so, which ones and which OS are you using?\n. Also, please note that IE8 is not currently really supported: see #100 \n. This is not a bug: the values of the dropdown are meant to be the available options, not the settings of opts.vals.\n. I believe you have misunderstood this parameter, which has not changed in behaviour since the first verion. I have just updated the example here http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/mps_prepop.html to show how you can use the vals parameter. It serves not to determines which options are available in the dropdown(s) but which option(s) are selected upon render.\n. The thing is that not all aggregators operate only on numeric data. unique, for example, can operate on string data. There is an issue open already about type-hinting, which, depending upon the implementation, would address your concerns: #191 \n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. I think 1ff839d32c4a7245b5f32de6d235c49aa7a5f94e fixes this\n. Thanks! See also #208 \n. What are the parameters that you are passing into pivotUI() ?\n. OK but I'm going to need to see the actual object that gets passed in, not the code that generates it.\n. Yes, I will need to see the JSON representation of the options parameter. Attachments will not work when emailing into Github Issues, so you will have to paste it into your response.\n. Is this issue still active?\n. @maximl337 please create a new issue rather than commenting on an old one and I will try to help out :)\n. Glad you like this library!\n1) for your first concern, yes, you can load JSON data via AJAX-style calls (see example: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/mps.html)\n2) for your second concern, you can use the onRefresh parameter to capture the settings of pivotUI() for later re-renderings (see example: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/onrefresh.html)\n. Yes, you are not passing in an aggregator to pivot(). If you look at the Parameters page you will see that pivot() and pivotUI() do not take the same parameters. Specifically, pivot() does not take aggregatorName but rather aggregator which is a function, not a string. This page contains more information on Aggregators and the built-in ones and how to use them: Aggregators.\n. Your javascript is not valid... on the line which contains $.pivotUtilities.aggregators.intSum([\"properties_added\"]) you need to prepend aggregator:\n:)\n. OK. You're mixing up aggregators and aggregatorTemplates. \nHere's the line you need if you want to use the predefined english-locale \"Integer Sum\":\njavascript\naggregator: $.pivotUtilities.aggregators[\"Integer Sum\"]([\"properties_added\"])\nIf you want to be able to control formatting you can use:\njavascript\naggregator: $.pivotUtilities.aggregatorTemplates.sum()([\"Age\"])`\nwhile passing in a formatting function into the sum() call to e.g. get integers only. \nThe \"Integer Sum\" aggregator is itself defined using the sum() aggregator template.\n. No sweat. Is everything working now? The aggregator system is very flexible but pretty confusing as well, so don't feel bad.\n. OK, I'm going to re-close this issue so that you can create a new one... I'm trying to keep one issue per issue :)\nAlso, I'm afraid that I don't understand the new problem you're reporting... In the new issue, can you please try to re-explain, perhaps with a screenshot?\nthanks.\n. The problem is pretty much exactly what the error says: browsers do not let you load files not being served by HTTP using XMLHttpRequest. In order for the $.getJSON() call to work, files must be served by an HTTP server, not opened directly from disk. So if you're on Windows you need to run IIS or a local Apache or Nginx or you need to call python -m SimpleHTTPServer in the examples directory (all ways of running a local HTTP server) and then point your browser to http://localhost:/ and everything will work :)\n. OK. Can we close this issue or are there any further questions about this? :)\n. I'm not sure I fully understand your question, but perhaps this example will help? http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/onrefresh.html\nIf not, could you please try to restate your question more clearly?\n. I don't understand what you mean by \"set the session\". Please explain.\n. You would have to adapt the code here: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/onrefresh.html to capture the event that has just occured, or you could watch the drag and drop events yourself in the DOM.\n. Interesting question, I have not really considered this. I would assume that just removing the parent div contents from the DOM would cause the browser's garbage collector to dispose of everything correctly but I've not tested this.\n. I'm really having trouble understanding what you want to do here. Can you give me an example of the output you are trying to achieve?\n. OK. You cannot \"extract a csv file\" with this library, unfortunately.\n. Thanks for this PR!\nI'm not sure I follow how this date-aware sort works... Does it assume that dates are in MM/DD/YY format or something?\nThe sorting function is sufficiently contentious in this library that I think I will just make it a parameter that defaults to the current implementation, so that everyone can choose their own :)\n. Wow, that's quite the implementation, thanks for bringing it to my attention. I'm having trouble understanding how it is able to use a regex to figure out what's Date.parse()-able but it sure seems to work, although it gets confused about M/D/Y vs D/M/Y which is irritating to some people (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_format_by_country) ...\n. Yes, I thought that might be the case...\n. There is now a mechanism to override the natural sort either on a per-attribute basis or globally. See documentation for the sorters parameter and the example which shows how to sort month names without leading numbers.\n. This is a neat idea! I'm not sure if this will leak but if it works for you, awesome :)\n. Would these macros somehow pattern-match to attribute contents or would the mapping of macros to attributes be done in the initial function call? I.e. if I have two date fields T1 and T2, would I just be able to specify \"activate these macros for dates\" or would I have to specify \"activate these macros for attributes T1 and T2\" ?\n. In that case isn't it just easier to use derived attributes to begin with, without adding all this overhead to allow users to create them within the UI?\n. This is very cool, but honestly I don't think that I would accept the PR into the core of this project, as the use-case seems fairly narrow for the added complexity, especially as compared to just adding the deriver right away in source.\n. Oh I definitely understood the idea, but it seems like even with your proposal, the javascript call would have to be hardcoded to the field names to allow for these macros to apply, right?\n. OK, for the purposes of this conversation let's split up \"users\" into \"Developers\" and \"End Users\" . Developers write software which causes Javascript to be executed in the browsers of End Users, who interact with the resulting pivot table widget.\nMy understanding is that for an End User to gain access to the new UI elements you are proposing for a given attribute X, a Developer needs to hardcode the name of attribute X in the Javascript which invokes the pivot table. Please correct me if I'm wrong but I believe I asked about this earlier on in the thread and you responded in the affirmative (see the exchange about T1 and T2).\nLet's compare this to the situation today, where a Developer could just as easily use the derivers mechanism to create derived attributes up front, which the End User would have immediate access to, without having to use the popup menu and clicking on buttons. This is how I as a Developer have created UIs for my End Users: when attribute X is a date, I suppress attribute X and add derived attributes for year, month, and month-and-day.\nSo as I see it, your proposal allows me as a Developer to pass along the decision of whether or not to create derived attributes to my End User, for attributes which I still have to pre-specify in source, much as if I was creating the derived attributes myself. Unfortunately, I don't really believe that this additional freedom is worth the additional complexity in this library.\nIf I've misunderstood, please do correct me though! Your YouTube video is not accessible to me unfortunately (I get a \"this video is private\" message)\n. OK, I've watched the video and I did in fact misunderstand.\nMy question now is: how does your code determine which attributes get the new buttons if not via configuration? Is there some type-detection where the pivot table now tests attributes values to find out if they are dates?\n. Some extra thoughts on this issue, with a few years of perspective :)\n\nType hinting would really help! See #191 \nThe idea of a generic JSON-serializable deriver system is quite a good one\nThe idea of onRefresh providing a JSON-serializable config is also a good one (it could do the stripping of renderers, aggregators, sorters etc internally). Very cool, thank you!\n. @SamMousa I'm not able to commit the time to test and maintain this file, so I'm leery of merging it to master.\n. @nhhockeyplayer I think the common practice here is to contribute a third-party type definition to https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped. This is really cool, I'll definitely play with it later today :)\n\nWell done!\n. Ah, I'm sorry you had trouble with this... There's actually code for this already here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/blob/master/pivot.coffee#L156 which can be called like this to get the same output: $.pivotUtilities.derivers.dateFormat(\"Name of Attribute\", \"%m-%n\")\n. Right, I see the problem now.\n. This is rather strange... I can't reproduce this with the examples here on Chrome on OSX. What operating system are you using? Are you able to reproduce this with this URL? http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/gchart.html (adding the \"name\" as a row will give you a long table)\n. I suspect something else in the document is causing this behaviour, as I've never seen it on any size of data...\n. If you can post an example somewhere which displays this behaviour (or even provide me with some fake data that I can load into the Local CSV example) then I can help you debug it, otherwise I'm not sure what I can do to help, given that I can't reproduce it... \n. nicolas@kruchten.com\n. Are you still unable to reproduce this? If so, can I close this issue?\n. I reproduced this issue (finally) and pushed a fix :)\n. The charts were sizing based on the window size rather than the viewport size...\n. I don't think pagination is what you're looking for here but I also don't think pagination can realistically be added to this library. \n. Yep! Check out this wiki page: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Derived-Attributes\n. Can you give me a clearer example of the input data you have and the output you're looking for?\n. Thanks for the bug report! I've just pushed a fix. Note that this has to be fixed in pivot.coffee and that all that is needed is to change for to for own :)\n. In general, the pivot table sorts based on what it displays and displays the input given. If you want to sort based on one thing and display another you'll have to either override the natural sort function in the library or do some post-processing as with the solution posted above.\nI'm considering making the sorting function overridable given how often this issue comes up... See #236 \n. There is now a mechanism to override the natural sort either on a per-attribute basis or globally. See documentation for the sorters parameter and the example which shows how to sort month names without leading numbers.\n. Can you provide a bit more detail here please? I think your post got cut off...\n. You are calling pivot() as if it were pivotUI() but they accept different parameters... If you check the documentation for pivot() you will see that it does not accept aggregators/aggregatorName as parameters, but rather a single function called aggregator.\n. See new example here: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/simple_agg.html\n. Are you using pivot() or pivotUI() ?\n. See new example here: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/simple_agg.html\n. Can you give me a few more details on this please? Which tags are not closing? Which version of IE/Windows are you using?\nThanks!\n. pivot() creates a PivotData object and then calls a renderer on it. You can write your own renderer which does something else with the PivotData object if you like...\n. The object being returned is a jQuery object. This is standard practice for jQuery plugins: they return the object on which they were called. So from pivot() and pivotUI() we want to return this. But as it appens, this.append() also returns this because append() is a jQuery function. So we can return this.append() and the right thing happens.\n. What happens when you run the command? What are you expecting to have happen?\n. OK you don't need NPM for that. You can just grab the files from the dist directory here in the repo.\n. You'll have to make sure that the values in the exclusions exactly match the values of your table cells including whitespace and markup... If you're still having problems, can you post a URL where I can see the issue in action?\n. Thanks!\nIf you don't mind your user not having controls over the exclusions you can use the filter parameter (which is a function) instead to prevent certain rows from being included in the input...\n\nOn Feb 16, 2015, at 12:16, abanaik notifications@github.com wrote:\nThanks a ton! I had not included the complete markup. Resolved my issue. Although, I have another question. Currently I am getting an attribute that has some 20 values, and I need to filter that attribute with just 1 value before I load the pivot. Is there any better way to do that besides the exclusions parameter? As of now I am excluding the other 19 odd values.\nI would like to add that this is an absolutely fantastic plugin. Amazing work!\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. You'll have to call pivotUI() again if you want to change the input data. Watch out for infinite recursion!\n. Well you need to make sure you don't recurse if nothing has changed...\n. See example here http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/simple_agg.html\n. @jwhitmarsh that's what the aggregatorName property does...\n. Interesting. Any details on the Android and Chrome version? I'll need to hunt down a device to try it. I suspect it's something silly like the device doesn't support the triangle glyph or something...\n. Hmmm. Can you try to replace &#x25BE; in the pivot table code with a different triangle encoding like &#9662; or otherwise some normal character like * and see if that appears in all the browsers you need to be able to use? If so, it just means that the browsers you're using can't render the little downward triangle glyph, which is a bummer but I can probably find a workaround.\n\nAnother possible problem is the font you're using... what font is it in these pages? Can you try something like Verdana?\n. There are a few things happening here:\n1. When you use File > Save as... what you get (in Chrome, at least) is a full serialization of the DOM, so the pivot table you first see is what was saved. What then happens is that the Javascript runs and overwrites the table with the newly-rendered, non-customized table.\n2. The demos all work with $.getJSON() to load the data, which will not work if you try to load a local file (browsers do not support this kind of request for file:/// requests). This means that the first part of the above point works (the table is rendered) and the second fails (check your Javascript console, you'll see that pivotUI() is not actually called due to the failure of $.getJSON())\nIn general, then, this is going to be quite tricky to make work with just the browser's Save-as functionality and you will have to find a way to store the user settings JSON object somewhere in the DOM and get the saved file to use that if present.\n. Oh I meant the JSON settings which are passed back to you in the onRefresh callback. If you store those in the DOM somewhere and have the Javascript use those settings if present, you may be able to use Save-as after all...\n. This is great, thank you!\n. I'm not understanding here... You say \"If I try to put it on the Top or Bottom, it seems paging does not work.\" but how did you try to do this?\n. Unfortunately no, this is not possible atm, see the first question in the FAQ: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions\n. Hi there,\nWhat do you mean by \"support\" ? You can apply the bootstrap CSS file to this library and tweak as required... ?\nn\n. I've just tweaked the CSS to make it more Bootstrap-friendly.\n. This seems like a good approach if you want to simultaneously support multiple languages.\n. I don't think I can address your second point, but I've just added options to control the dimensions (you were trying to pass in height/width into the options but this was not supported!). The renderer Options are under gchart.height and gchart.width and they are functions which should return dimensions in pixels.\n. Thanks for this pull request! I'll review it shortly :)\n. Your code certainly works, but I'm not able to create a test case where the original one doesn't, including a parent element with display: relative... Can you provide a simple Fiddle or something which shows the problem please so I can better understand this change?\n. I made some changes in this area in response to #339 with this commit:  f6a9b091c9d273791a3e0f3dd505e07bb385d162\nNot sure if that solves the problem you were having...\n. Thanks for this pull request! I'll review it shortly :)\n. Note to self: very similar to #184 \n. Thanks for your response! I believe that most of what you are looking for is possible with the library as it stands, even if it is implemented in a different way than that which you suggested... Check out this example http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/montreal_2014.html and you will see that the underlying data just has full dates (very compact, normalized), and I used the derivedAttributes feature to extract month and day names, and then the sorters to fix the sort order of those for display.\n. The examples have all been tested and all work with jQuery 1.8.3 and jQueryUI 1.9.2. It's a good bet that later versions will work well, and it's kind of a crapshoot if you want to use later versions.\nVersion 3.0 of d3 I believe works, but if you want to use c3 you'll need a compatible version of d3 (which I believe is the very latest one)\n. If someone submits a renderer addition that's broadly compatible with the rest of the code, I'll gladly add it to this repo but to date no one ever has.\n. Ah yes, the Aggregator documentation doesn't cover this... You'll need to include a numInputs field :)\n. There is no way to do this, no. You may want to define a number of Aggregators with no parameters instead.\n. This is a neat addition, thank you! \n. Say you have input like [{\"a\":\"b\",\"c\":\"d\"},{\"a\":\"b\",\"c\":\"e\"}] and you only wanted to show rows which have attribute c equal to \"d\", then you could pass in function(row){return row[\"c\"] == \"d\";} as the filter parameter.\n. Super, thanks very much!\n. I'm having trouble reproducing this behaviour... What browser are you using, and are you embedding this form into a page which uses some Javascript framework which attaches a handler to all buttons or something?\n. Thanks for the contribution! I'll see about merging it in :)\n. Merged in in another PR.\n. What happens when you run this code? What does it say in the javascript console?\n. There was a bug, which I just fixed. Should work for you now.\n. See the FAQ :)  https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#supporting-charting-library-x-chartjs-highcharts-etc\n. Try the very top of pivot.css\n. That's already the default behaviour... can you give me an example where this doesn't happen?\n. That's kind of weird indeed. I'll try to dig into it a bit more when I have a sec.\n. Thanks for the bug report :)\n. This appears to go away if I upgrade jQuery and jQueryUI, so I'm tempted to call it an upstream bug...\n. OK, I've upgraded jquery and I can no longer reproduce this bug, so I'm closing the issue. Feel free to reopen if it's still around or appears on other platforms than what I tested (Chrome/Safari/Firefox on OSX)\n. Yes, you can use the val argument to pivotUI which is an array of strings. So if you wanted to show Sum A over Sum B, then aggregatorName is \"Sum over Sum\" and val is [\"A\",\"B\"]\n. Cool! Thanks :)\n. cool, thanks again for the contribution!\n. What kind of resizing are you looking for? You want the table to fit within a particular bounding rectangle? If so, how would you expect the pivottable to scale? \nRegarding the classes with no CSS definition, it's possible that those classes are there just to facilitate selection via jQuery rather than to apply CSS styles.\n. The ultimate size of the table is basically determined by the data and the text size, and the only reliable way to shrink things would be to shrink the font size. If you try to just change the external dimensions, there is nowhere for the text in the tables to go so it will not change much.\n. Like I said, the size is determined by the content: if your table has 100 rows and 100 columns, there's nothing you can do to shrink that...\n. The way to do that is to reduce the font size of the text in the cell. You can't force the font to shrink by shrinking the containing element, that's not how HTML/CSS work :)\n. It's documented :)\n. Unfortunately not. More details are in the FAQ here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#multiple-aggregators-in-the-ui-and-renderers\n. If you want an aggregator that shows sum(Number)/sum(Amount) then you can use the builtin sumOverSum aggregator: \"Calculated\": function() { return sumOverSum()([\"Number\", \"Amount\"]); }\nThere is no way to combine aggregators in the way you are trying to without building your own aggregator from scratch as listed here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Aggregators\n. This is pretty much how all pivot tables work, including Excel... For each cell, including the row/col/grand-totals, first the matching values are found, then the aggregator is applied. In your second example, the grand total is not the average of averages, it's the average of all values, just like in your first example, the grand total isn't the sum of sums, it's the sum of all values (which happens to be equal to a sum of sums).\nTo be honest, though, I'm not sure how you're generating the output in your examples: you should not be able to render empty columns like this :) \n. Actually never mind my last comment, I do see how the empty columns are generated, with 0-values.\n. If you check out this example: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/fully_loaded.html on a mobile device, it should work. All that I did there was add a reference to jQuery UI Touch Punch (http://touchpunch.furf.com/) with this line: \n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui-touch-punch/0.2.3/jquery.ui.touch-punch.min.js\"></script>\n. Try the \"count as fraction of total\" aggregator to see if that meets your needs?\n\nOn May 16, 2015, at 17:56, Mark Silverberg notifications@github.com wrote:\nScreenshot attached. Maybe it's easier to keep it in the same cell and create some custom format or rendered? I really don't know and could use some pointers.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. You can only use one aggregator at a time (FAQ: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#multiple-aggregators-in-the-ui-and-renderers) but you can always create a new aggregator which shows, say \" (%)\" or something like that, based on the \"Count as fraction of \" family of aggregators...\n. Unfortunately this is not possible... FAQ: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#multiple-aggregators-in-the-ui-and-renderers\n. Thanks for the feedback! Implemented.\n. 1. There is the \"Integer Sum\" aggregator which rounds\n2. You can customize the number formatting by creating your own aggregators with a different number formatter. One way to do this would be to create a \"locale\" file: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Localization\n. That's true, but I'm not sure what I can do about it, it seems to be a particularity of C3...\n. I don't think I would want to modify c3_renderers.coffee in that way, no, but as a workaround, you could do that within a Derived Attribute and make your graph with that... https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Derived-Attributes\n. You will not be able to do this without some fairly big modifications to gchart_renderers.coffee: there is no way to get what you want by simply passing in extra parameters.\n. Hello @manotiwa,\n\nUnfortunately, table sorting is not a feature of this library: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#sorting-in-built-in-table-renderer\n. Unfortunately there's not much I can suggest to help you, other than adding in your own dynamic sorting to the table with something like http://tablesorter.com/\n. Hi Catherine,\nThis is still not a supported feature of PivotTable.js, which rpivottable relies on, so there is basically no way to do this, I'm sorry.\nNicolas\n. The heatmap()function is here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/blob/master/pivot.coffee#L867 but I'm not sure what you mean about \"threshold\" values... The system interpolates white to red between the highest and lowest values.\n. You can now specify a custom color scale function, see the example here: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/montreal_2014.html\n. Can you provide an example of the 'nested div' structure which poses a problem? I have been unable to replicate this issue...\n. Super, thanks! I'll take a look :)\n. Thanks for this test case. I've actually just implemented your change and it looks like it works :)\n. I don't really understand what you're asking... Can you try to rephrase please? What would you like to have happen if you call pivot() without an aggregator parameter?\n. I'm having trouble understanding your request but it sounds like you want to use the pivot() function which creates a static table rather than pivotUI() which creates a dynamic one...\n. OK, well just use pivot() instead of pivotUI() then :)\n. That's not possible with this library, sorry. See: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#multi\n. You could hack the pivot() function so that it doesn't operate on this but instead operates on some other DOM element...\n. Thanks for the pull-request, but I think I'll leave it in for now. It's automatically-managed by the gulp build system anyway :)\n. Thanks for this PR! Unfortunately, I'm not sure about merging it, for a couple of reasons:\n1. pie/donut charts are a bad fit for the data model (what happens when you have attributes in both the row and column positions?)\n2. the spline/step/area options are neat, but are basically just visual tweaks on the already-supported line and area options, and I don't like adding a ton of options to an already-long dropdown menu... \n. The renderer (and aggregator) names do respect the locale parameter, if the 'language pack' file provides a renderers (and aggregators) object. See this example: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/mps_fr.html\nMore details on localization can be found here https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Localization and an example 'language pack' is here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/blob/master/pivot.fr.coffee\n. If you pass in your own set of renderers, you'll need to make sure the keys of the renderers object are in the language you want, as that is what is used in the UI.\n. Happy to help!\n. Are you using the d3 treemap visualization?\n. You mean C3 Stacked Bar Chart? I just need to know which specific thing is being used before being able to help :)\n. OK. I don't think this will be very easy, but you should refer to the Google Chart documentation to see if they allow you to inject a function as a tooltip handler, and go from there.\n. If your dataset contains year, county, day of year, sighting then you could make this chart with the aggregator = min(day of year), columns = year, rows = county.\n. Unfortunately sorting post-aggregation is not supported at the moment... The sorters system is used to set an ordering for attribute values statically, before aggregation/rendering happens.\n. I don't see this being implemented in the near-future, given the challenges involved in implementing it such that it works efficiently in most use-cases. If you absolutely need this, my recommendation would be for you to make a modified version of the gchart_renderers which implements the logic you would like to see.\n. Can you expand on \"it's not working for me\"? What are you expecting to have happen, what does happen?\n. I'm glad this tool is useful for you!\nI don't think I would implement this feature request as an option into the main library (this is the first time anyone has requested it), but there are a couple of ways you can get this behaviour.\n1. you could maintain a copy of the pivotTableRenderer() function in a separate file and use that renderer instead of the builtin one (similar to how the c3_renderers are in their own file). \n2. you could modify the builtin pivotTableRenderer() function.\nI recommend the first option, to make it easier to upgrade to newer versions of the library later.\nIn either case, you want to take the block of code in pivotTableRenderer() between the comments finally, the row for col totals, and a grand total and squirrel this away for later and move it above the comment now the actual data rows, with their row headers and totals.\n. The comments are in the pivot.coffee file, which you can modify and recompile... If that's not something you want to do, can you confirm that you're using the latest version of pivot.js (i.e. this one: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/blob/master/dist/pivot.js ?) and I can give you line numbers.\n. OK, take the current lines 875-900 inclusive (i.e. the selected block here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/blob/master/dist/pivot.js#L875-L900) and move them up to sit just below the current line 834.\nIt's a pretty simple change: you're taking the block that generates the totals row and moving it above the block that generates the main body of the table. If you want a totals row both above and below, then just copy it instead of moving it and you'll get both :)\n. Happy to help!\n. thanks! somehow at some point a whole bunch of two-character sequences got deleted from that file and I don't know how :(\n. Yes, this is problem, and I don't really have a good solution for it at the moment. \nThe challenge is that these are external charting libraries with their own number formatting system, and I'm not even sure they support localization at all. PivotTable.js just passes in numerical data and the external charting libraries take it from there and reformat it as they like...\n. OK. There's no need to modify c3_renderers.coffee or c3_renderers.js, as you can pass in these options via the rendererOptions parameter to pivot() and pivotUI() \n. OK, let me know how it goes! I think there's enough info in that other ticket to put you on the right track :)\n. I'm going to close this as a duplicate of #140 and leave a link there to here.. Hi,\nThere is no way to force a refresh on the pivot table, you can only do a full rerender by calling pivot() or pivotUI() again with new parameters...\nNicolas\n. There is no onRefresh() callback for pivot() because pivot() renders just once, synchronously and never changes thereafter, so you can just call whatever function you like right after pivot() returns and you'll get the same effect.\n. @prernadubey please open a new issue rather than commenting on a closed one...\nPlease include an explanation of what you expected to happen and what does happen as \"it's not working\" is not clear enough for me to help you.. I think this adds a bit too much complexity to the core... Also, toPrecision() would probably be a better way to implement this :)\n. It is possible, but you will have to write your own number formatter (perhaps one that wraps currencyFormat) to accomplish this.\n. Thanks for your proposal :)\nI've discussed this in the past here https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/pull/77 and concluded against including it, given the wide variety of different ways to compute the \"week number\".\n. Thanks very much! I'll merge this into master the next time I do a batch of changes :)\n. The min/max aggregators just treat everything as a number I believe so that's why they just look at the first number in your date string. You will likely have to copy and modify the min/max aggregators to become date-aware. Take a look at the code for them and let me know if you need a hand :)\n. 18 months later... The min/max operators now work on things other than just numbers, so out of the box they work with ISO-formatted dates (YYYY-MM-DD) and the sorters mechanism can be used to get it to handle arbitrarily-formatted dates.. Have you considered using pivot() instead of pivotUI()? This will generate just the table but not the UI around it.\n. Everything that works with pivotUI() should work with pivot()... Can you give me an example of charting that doesn't work with pivot() ?\n\nOn Jul 28, 2015, at 23:41, tiny-byte notifications@github.com wrote:\nI thought of that but then it was not capable of rendering charts and other advance stuff.but I did get around this problem by setting style of that parts\n.myContainer .pvtUi tr:first-child , .myContainer .pvtAxisContainer {\ndisplay: none;\n}\nbut I don't feel that's a good way to handle this.what do you think?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n.

You will have to either create a new Renderer based on the default Table one that works the way you want it to, or you will have to let the default Renderer render and then modify its HTML/CSS via Javascript calls (similar to how the Heatmap Renderers work)\n. I don't have any concrete plans to implement sorting by value, no... \n\nSee also the FAQ here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#sorting-in-built-in-table-renderer\n. Great, glad you found your way to a solution :)\n. This is a good idea in principle but the implementation is a bit strange... thetrs containing only ths (i.e. the header rows) should be in the thead element, no?\n. I'm OK with adding <thead> and <tbody> but I don't think I want DataTables-related code in the core, though. If you really want DataTables-compatible output, I would recommend that you either wrap or fork the TableRenderer\n. Yes, that's what I'm referring to. I don't really like this approach, as the rowspan/colspan is the key feature of this renderer. IMO if we want a renderer that doesn't do this, we should write a new (much simpler) one, rather than adding options to this one.\n. ok :)\n. Hi Magalie,\nI'm sorry I haven't gotten back to you more quickly. I'm afraid I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to do, so please do forward me what you've built and I'll try to help you debug it.\n. You could just add your onRefresh callback to the output of JSON.parse before passing it in to pivotUI I think\n. This doesn't make a lot of sense in the context of pivotUI() given that the chart contents are user-controllable...\n. Sorry for the long delay on this issue. You need to specify the aggregatorName parameter in pivot() to get an appropriate title.\n. The short answer is that is is not possible to display multiple aggregators at the same time, as per the FAQ...\n\nOn Aug 11, 2015, at 16:31, cesardmoro notifications@github.com wrote:\ni have a pivottable:\nWith this fields:\nLeads , Donors TMk , Donors ONL \nand i want to add other fields\nTotal Donors , DonorsTMK / Leads\ncan you help ?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n.

If you really need to add custom classes, I recommend doing it via jQuery in an onRefresh callback.\n. I'm not sure I understand what you are describing... Are you able to point me to an example?\n. I'm sorry that I never responded to this issue... Is it still current/do you still need an answer?\n. OK, I will try to learn a bit about AngularJS to make this work :)\n. Clearing history is absolutely not required! All of the examples work just fine without this: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples\nBased on your stack trace, there are other scripts from sap-ui-core.js which are likely interfering with the proper functioning of PivotTable.js...\n. Yes, the input data is only processed once per call to pivot() or pivotUI()\n. Unfortunately there is no way to do this at the moment.\n. This is basically the same as the issue you brought in #376 right? As I've said there, the issue seems to be due to other scripts you're running (like sap-ui-core.js or something like that)\nAre you able to reproduce this problem with the example at http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples ? If not, I would tend to say that the issue comes from somewhere else in your page\n. I'm unclear about how clearing browser history would apply to running an application on different machines...\n. Great! Does that resolve #376 also?\n. Super\n. Thanks for doing this! I'll get it merged shortly, once I've had time to play with it a bit.\nThe Jupyter wrapper looks awesome, but I'm having trouble installing it to see how it works... Can you provide some installation instructions? I'd love to contribute :)\n. Hehe, ok, I'll try to make it work :)\nThanks again for the contribution!\n. Hi again @joshbode,\nI've just pushed this https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/blob/master/jupyter/pivottablejs.py which is a first cut at a really simple Jupyter cell-magic to invoke this library on a Pandas data frame. Would be interested in your thoughts... It basically writes out a self-contained HTML file and then opens it up in an iframe, with a link to 'pop out' into its own window. You can also save the resulting file and re-open it later.\n. I see what you're trying to do. I think I will address this use-case with a \"bundle local\" flag which will inline all the scripts and CSS. Also: I have to repackage this as a real python module, as %install_ext is deprecated in Jupyter 4.0. I'll be creating a pivottablejs package which will be installable via pip.\n. And here we go: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pivottablejs feedback and/or pull-requests welcome there :)\n. Sorry for the breakage, @jaseczka, and thanks for the bug report. This has been fixed in Version 2.0.0\n. I'm going to need to see the calling code, as there's not enough info in the screenshot for me to help debug...\n. I'm sorry that I completely forgot to address this issue... Is this still relevant for you? If so I can dig into it a little bit, otherwise I will close the issue.\n. There is no option to hide the totals, unfortunately. More generally, there is no UI for renderer options at all.\nThe only way to do what you seek would be to hide it via CSS, which might be tricky if you're using it through R... \n. I'm glad it's a useful tool! :)\n. This is a good idea, but unfortunately I don't think it will ever be possible with this library. Essentially it boils down to a custom display for multiple aggregators, which is a frequently-requested but architecturally-incompatible change.\n. I'm not sure I follow what you're proposing...\n. OK. If this will do what you're looking for, great, but I'm not sure how much value PivotTable.js is bringing you here :)\n. If you reshaped your input to look like this...\nsample, replicate, measure_name, measure2\nA, 1, 0.5, measure1\nA, 2, 0.6, measure1\nA, 3, 0.4, measure1\nB, 1, 0.2, measure1\nB, 2, 0.3, measure1\nB, 3, 0.1, measure1\nA, 1, 0.4, measure2\nA, 2, 0.3, measure2\nA, 3, 0.5, measure2\nB, 1, 0.31, measure2\nB, 2, 0.32, measure2\nB, 3, 0.33, measure2\n... and you added a standard deviation Aggregator, then you could load the input once and generate just two tables: one for average and one for standard deviation. This would scale better to large numbers of replicates.\n. There is no easy way, you'd have to hack something together...\n. Unfortunately, this library and Crossfilter solve different problems in incompatible ways... The main Crossfilter page sums it up pretty well: \nSince most interactions only involve a single dimension, and then only small adjustments are made to the filter values, incremental filtering and reducing is significantly faster than starting from scratch. Crossfilter uses sorted indexes (and a few bit-twiddling hacks) to make this possible, dramatically increasing the perfor\u00admance of live histograms and top-K lists.\nPivotTable.js actually recomputes and rerenders the output on every change in the UI, because most changes (other than those involving the dropdown menu for filtering) require it: changing aggregators, columns, rows, values, etc.\nThe best way to use Crossfilter with PivotTable.js would be to build a renderer which uses Crossfilter.\n. Seems like you're on your way! If you have any problems or requests for PivotTable.js, feel free to create individual Github issues for them.\n. Try the vals parameter set to [\"Age\"].\n. OK :)\n. Thank you for your pull request! This change has been integrated into the latest release.\n. I don't understand the question... Where/why would you like a second totals column?\n. There is no such feature, and it would be quite involved to build. Your best bet is to just rerender the pivot table by calling pivotUI() again.\n. OK, you'll have to use the overwrite parameter set to true to get what you're looking for, as per https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Parameters#pivotuiinput-options-overwrite-locale\n. Right at the very end, before the \");\" you need to put \", true\".\n\nOn Oct 13, 2015, at 17:23, sourabhtiwari notifications@github.com wrote:\nTHANKS FOR QUICK REPLY BUT I AM NOT GETTING IT PROPERLY..HERE IS WHAT I HAVE CODED FOR NOW\n$(\"#output\").pivotUI(data, {\n\"hiddenAttributes\" : [\"DEAL VERSION DETAIL ID\",\"CURRENCY NAME1\",\"DEAL QUALITY NAME1\"],\n\"renderers\": renderers,\n\"cols\": [\"\"], \"rows\": [\"\"],\n\"aggregatorName\": \"Sum\",\n\"autoSortUnusedAttrs\" : true,\n\"menuLimit\" :5,\n\"unusedAttrsVertical\" :true,\n\"rendererName\": \"Table\",\n\"unusedAttrsVertical\": true,\nonRefresh: function(config) {\nvar config_copy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(config));\n// console.log(config_copy);\n//delete some values which are functions\nvar mypivot_exclusions;\nmypivot_exclusions = config[\"exclusions\"];\n// console.log(mypivot_exclusions);\ndelete config_copy[\"aggregators\"];\ndelete config_copy[\"hiddenAttributes\"];\ndelete config_copy[\"renderers\"];\ndelete config_copy[\"cols\"];\ndelete config_copy[\"rows\"];\ndelete config_copy[\"derivedAttributes\"]\n// console.log(config_copy);\n//delete some bulky default values\ndelete config_copy[\"rendererOptions\"];\ndelete config_copy[\"localeStrings\"];\nvar abc = JSON.stringify(config_copy, undefined, 2);\nconsole.log(config);\n$(\"#config_json\").val(abc);\n}\n});\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. There's no straightforward way to do that, you'll have to regenerate the table again, resubmitting the configuration minus the filter exclusions/inclusions.\n. It's definitely possible but a little bit beyond the kind of support I have the time to provide for this library. Perhaps someone at StackOverflow.com will have some more time to help you out?\n. This is not possible, unfortunately: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#multi\n. That said, if you have a field called \"type\" which contains one of sales/expenses/profit then you could make such a graph, with a single aggregator.\n. Hi Luke,\n\nCan you explain a bit more what you're trying to do? I don't understand what you mean by \"dynamically changing decimal places\" :)\n. OK, I understand. In that case, you can create a set of aggregators which use a custom number formatting function which renders differently based on the value of your dropdown.\n. Great :)\n. There's probably a reasonable way to do this. You're wanting to derive the row/col values in something like an onClick handler?\n. Sorry for the long delay in answering: this would be fairly challenging without hacking the gcharts_renderers code.\n. Thanks!\n. There is no way to do this without re-rendering everything, unfortunately.\n. This is not possible, unfortunately.\n. I would need an example of this to see what the problem is, as by default this is the behaviour: the pivot table itself is not using absolute positioning, so it should just flow with the page. For example, see http://nicolas.kruchten.com/mtl311/ where there is a pivot table with a footer below it, and no matter what you do to the pivot table, the footer is never overlapped.\n. Can you provide a link to an example of the problem so I can dig into it?\n. @fmfcs could you post a hint as to what the CSS-related issue was?\n. Awesome!\n. I don't really understand what you're looking for here...\n. Unfortunately, I can't really provide support for forks of this library, so you'll have to ask @astechdev for help if their version is broken... If you really require interactive sorting for this library, you may have some luck with the extension here: http://www.nrecosite.com/pivot_table_aspnet.aspx\n. I agree there is a potential for malice here, but the scope of the security problem can be controlled by controlling the input to this library, and I'm not sure that just reverting this feature is the right thing to do here...\n. This feature was not primarily added for i18n, but rather for people who wanted to put arbitrary HTML in attribute names, so as to include images or HTML entities. See the example here http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/simple_ui_from_table.html and the SO question here  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26002789/pivottable-display-html-in-table and PR #257 for more details.\nWhat would you consider \"sufficient documentation\" to leave things as-is?\n. At this point, 1.4.0 was released 6 months ago, so even if this change should have been considered a 'breaking change' which would trigger a 2.0.0 release under semver at that point, I don't really think it makes sense to do that now. If anything, I feel that reverting to text-only now would be a breaking change which would trigger such a version bump.\nWhat is the nature of the security problem you see here? You're trying to protect against a situation where if app Q allows a user X to input data which is then somehow rendered by PivotTable.js on user Y's machine, then X can execute arbitrary malicious Javascript in Y's Q session?\n. Ah, I just saw the linked issue https://github.com/EverythingMe/redash/pull/637 above. I will think on this for another day, and do some tests of your PR. I think that it might indeed make sense to revert some code here, and then bump to 2.0.0 because it's a breaking change with the latest version.\n. Additional note, for context: textContent is not supported by IE8, so this PR will break IE8 compatibility as it stands...\n. We can't use jQuery inside the table renderer as it really kills the performance, so we'd need to replace all innerHtml with some kind of switch where for IE<9 it uses innerText otherwise textContent.\nI'm still weighing the implications of removing the ability for Aggregators to return HTML...\n. I'm wondering if we might not leave the html() calls as they are but add a new flag which would replace < with &lt; and > with &gt; in the input array or something like that.\n. I'm fairly certain that no XSS is possible without angle-brackets so we don't need to go much farther than that... No real need to escape quotes and slashes.\n. Let's try to keep the tone less than condescending please :)\n\nOn Nov 13, 2015, at 14:17, Todd Wolfson notifications@github.com wrote:\nOne of the most frequent mistakes in security is assuming vulnerabilities don't exist because we can't think of them. Here's an example XSS game to disprove your assumptions:\nhttps://xss-game.appspot.com/\nAside from that, not escaping an ampersand will lead to issues since < would render as < (<) when someone might intend to render `< (&lt;).\nSo please, don't assume anything and use trusted/known solutions.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. OK.\n\nAll things considered, even though it makes me sad to cut features that people specifically asked for and appreciated when they were added, I will likely merge some version of this PR tomorrow, after more testing, and call that Version 2.0.0, as it drops the HTML-input-feature/HTML-aggregator-output/XSS-vector and also drops IE8 support.\n. I've just released Version 2.0.0 which contains a fix for the issue you have identified, although I didn't go so far as to prevent HTML entities in the localization files.\nIf you strongly feel that accepting HTML in the localization files is a security concern, let's discuss.\n. I'm not sure what you mean about XSS column names? With v2.0.0 the column names are not output as HTML either, only the renderer and aggregator names, which come from the locale files (presumably) rather than a database...?\nIn any case, thanks for flagging this issue and bearing with me until the fix was merged :)\n. I tried with the locales as text and unicode instead of entities and couldn't get it to render well in my test environment (with involves running python -m SimpleHTTPServer in the main directory), even with a <meta charset=\"utf-8\" /> tag etc. I'm not sure why, as in principle it should work. I also didn't want to break too many things for other users if I didn't have to.\n. Ahh, that explains it. Sometimes the answer really is straightforward :)\nThanks!\nI'll give it some more thought and possibly kick out another version with Unicode locales as opposed to HTML locales.\n. You should use the pivot() function instead of pivotUI() to display just the renderer area without the drag'n'drop UI.\n. It's true they don't have the same parameters, but they're not that different. You'll have to build a bit of adapter code.\n. There is currently no way to do what you're looking for, sorry. I guess the way to do this would be to add two new fields to control which attributes can show up where in the UI, and then have hiddenAttributes override those for backwards-compatibility. Something like hiddenAttributesFromAggregators and hiddenAttributesFromDragDrop (although those names are very long)\n. Yes, if you want to send me a pull-request that implements the code to add these two options, I would be happy to work with you to integrate it, and then we could get that upstreamed into rPivotTable :)\n. Fixed with v2.15.0 !. There is no way to trigger a refresh. Instead of using jQuery to change the UI and then trying to trigger a refresh, just rerender the whole table with whichever options you need.\n. This is not possible at all, unfortunately.\n. Thanks for flagging that!\nThis is essentially a temporary state until both arguments are selected: if you then put \"Age\" in the first dropdown and \"Gender Imbalance\" in the second dropdown you'll see that rendering is back to normal. I'm not sure what C3 is doing there but it seems like a fairly minor issue.\n. Thank you for this pull request! I've been rather busy and I have a bunch of stuff queued up for review on this project so I haven't had the chance to integrate it yet, but I promise I will get to it :)\n. @sluc23 yeah, I've done a bad job with this PR... I've been hesitating to merge it because it's a feature that isn't requested all that often and I hesitate to keep adding options to this API.... I'm still pondering this change, please bear with me :). OK, I've just committed 824db49 which includes the changes from this PR.\nApologies again for taking so obscenely long to finalize this! I kept on thinking there was some fancier way to deal with this need (e.g. #191) but in the end this is simple and works well for many cases.. Why do you say that the \"correct\" syntax is jquery-ui? I can't find any kind of official statement to that effect, and jqueryui seems to work fine for most people...\n. Fixed in Version 2.0.0 by removing this (technically-optional) dependency altogether :)\n. Thanks for reporting this. I'll take a look this weekend as I am preparing\nanother PivotTable.js release.\nNicolas\nOn Wed, Nov 18, 2015 at 10:29 PM, Enzo notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nUsers have reported problems with the Pt locale (C3 and D3 renderers text\nis not translated).\nI've noticed that the code for the Pt locale is still referring to \"old\"\nnames like Line Chart C3 : is it possible that this is the cause for the\nfailed translation?\nThis is the code for the Pt locale:\nif (d3r) {\n  $.pivotUtilities.locales.pt.d3_renderers = {\n    \"Mapa de \u00c1rvore\": d3r[\"Treemap\"]\n  };\n}\nif (c3r) {\n  $.pivotUtilities.locales.pt.c3_renderers = {\n    \"Gr&aacute;fico de Linhas\": c3r[\"Line Chart C3\"],\n    \"Gr&aacute;fico de Barras\": c3r[\"Bar Chart C3\"]\n  };\n}\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/issues/410.\n.

Here's the blog post: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/content/2015/11/r-montreal/\nI've also made it possible for Python users to have access to this library, inspired by your R integration: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/content/2015/09/jupyter_pivottablejs/\n. It is not a consideration, unfortunately, see the related FAQ question\n. This is very cool, thanks for submitting it!\n. They are working, it's just that your sorter is looking for an attr called month and yours is called date, based on your screenshot :)\n. Agreed, but given that someone would have to build their own locale file to use this new negAccountingFormat option, I'm inclined to leave it out and let people add that logic into their locale file themselves...\n. Thanks for the PR, but I ended up fixing this bug another way!\n. I've ported the DA locale file into coffeescript, thanks! :)\n. Agreed that this would be neat, but it's quite difficult to implement in a cross-browser way.\n. The way you call pivot() and pivotUI() is fairly different... If you look at the documentation here https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Parameters you will see that pivot() does not take a renderers parameter which is a dictionary, you will need to pick a single renderer and pass it in as the renderer parameter.\n. I'm not sure what your question is... Can you describe what you are getting and what you are hoping to get?\n. I'm sorry, the image did not come through, and I still don't understand your question. There is a numberFormat() function within $.pivotUtilities but without more context I will not be able to help you use it...\n. OK so first you have a parsing problem right? You have numbers coming in as strings with spaces for thousands-separators/commas for decimal-separators and you want them to be parsed into numbers and then displayed with commas as thousands-separators/dots as decimal-separators?\n. This would be neat but the changes required to this library to support such an API would be way too big, so I don't think I will ever do this. The big problem is that this library is synchronous right now but it would need to be rearchitected to be asynchronous to work within the browser's HTTP request model.\n. As per the FAQ, there is no support for multiple measures. https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions\n. You cannot dynamically change anything programatically, you can just re-render the full output. With respect to sorting, you can control the sort order of rows and columns with the sorters parameter, but note that this sorts by row/column header value, not by cell value.\n. You can constraint the container's width with CSS but ultimately, it's very hard to constrain table widths: the contents can only be squeezed so much.\n. Your best bet will be to put some Javascript into the onRefresh callback for sure. In terms of finding the right cells, there might not be enough information in the class attributes to easily find what you need but maybe I can help you figure it out... For which cells do you want buttons?\n. I'm afraid I don't really understand what you are trying to do... Can you give me a concrete example of the input you have and the output you'd like to see?\n. You only need to pass either exclusions or inclusions or both, but inclusionsInfo is part of the onRefresh output for legacy compatibility reasons.\n. Glad you like this library, and sorry I didn't reply to this sooner!\nThere is no way to change the colour of the bars in the Table Barchart renderer at the moment without modifying the code, although the header and column colours should be easy to change in pivot.css on lines 10 and 55.\n. They can be: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/onrefresh.html\n. It's not clear to me how data structured via the pivot UI would map onto the input fields of the timeline chart... Could you clarify?\n. Thanks for the patch!\n. I'm confused... You want the count to appear in the UI or you want programmatic access to it?\n. So you want to build an aggregator which displays a special value when it is aggregating fewer than 5 values? Your aggregator will have to keep a count of how many times its push method has been called, and use that number as a switch for its value function.\nSomething like:\njavascript\nvar count = function(data, rowKey, colKey) {\n  return {\n    count: 0,\n    push: function(record) { this.count++; },\n    value: function() { return this.count < 5 ? \"fewer than 5!\" : this.count; },\n    format: function(x) { return x; },\n };\n};\n. Hmm ok then I don't understand what you are looking for. Could you post some sample data and the sample output you seek so I can better answer your question?\n\nOn Feb 12, 2016, at 03:13, Emil Moe notifications@github.com wrote:\nI'm not sure. This leaves out data if the value in the cell is less than 5.\nI want to not display anything, but only if the complete set is based on less than 5 observations. I think it's the Totals / Totals count that is in my concern only, right?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Both renderers and aggregators get access to an instance of the PivotData class, which on its own is not aware of how many data points went into it. You could build a special aggregator which would do this counting, and query its grand total value from the renderer to prevent table display if the count is less than 5. Is that what you mean?\n. This fomula basically computes the 80% confidence interval upper and lower bound according to the Wilson formula for a given number of trials and successes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval#Wilson_score_interval\n. The short answer is that there is no way to do any of that without either changing the builtin heatmap Renderer, or making a copy of it that behaves the way you would like it to.\n\nIf you wanted to submit a pull-request that added some options to the builtin heatmap renderer (via the rendererOptions mechanism) I would happily consider merging it in :)\n. You can now specify a custom color scale function, see the example here: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/montreal_2014.html\n. @yordanivanov92 please create new issues rather than commenting on old, closed ones :)\nTo answer your question: you can override all styles using CSS.. Yep, you can make pretty much any kind of scale you want. Here's the documentation: https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-reference/blob/master/Quantitative-Scales.md. (also: please do not comment on closed issues, rather open a new one, so as to minimize the notifications sent to uninterested parties :). Thanks very much!\n. If you need a particular format of output, you may be better off copying/modifying the actual Table Renderer code instead of reprocessing its output...\n. Hi there,\nGlad you like this library!\n1. This is not possible at the moment\n2. Yes, with the hiddenAttributes parameter\n3. Yes of course, in the wiki: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Parameters\n. Thanks!\n. Hi Thomas, \nSorry I never answered this! It doesn't seem like C3.js supports this so it's likely not possible.\nNicolas\n. This library is a client-side library only, without functionality specific to any given server-side technology like PHP... I'm not really set up to help you with PHP examples, sorry.\n.

Unfortunately this is not supported, see https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#sorting-in-built-in-table-renderer\n. It looks like D3 isn't loading correctly.\n. I'm sorry, but I'm not familiar at all with Apex or the PLSQL environment you're working in, so I won't be able to be of assistance...\n. This is not a supported feature.\n. Thanks for the PR, and apologies for the delay in responding. I've just pushed a simpler fix for this issue :)\n. You can only do this in CSS.\n. @amit509 as per the Contribution Guidelines:\n\nPlease do not add a comment to an existing issue to ask an unrelated question, especially if it's already closed. Instead, create a new issue instead and reference the older one.\n\nThat said, there has already been some discussion of Angular in issue #208 which might be of help to you.... This is by design: these two functions have different behaviours and different parameters.\n. There's nothing built-in for that, but you can easily wrap pivot() just like pivotUI() does, with a simpler interface like a single dropdown for aggregators :)\n. Indeed the way to do this is via the data, rowKey, colKey parameters, which you need to capture in a closure.\nThe only built-in aggregator which uses this is the fractionOf aggregator and it's a bit of a mind-bender because it wraps other aggregators.\nThe key to making this work is not to have data, rowKey, colKey as parameters to the value function, so that the body of the value function access the objects in the closure.\n. I don't follow... There is one aggregator for each cell in the table, so they never get updated.\n. Oh, and value is only called once per aggregator.\n. Yes, for the Grand Total aggregator, but not for the other ones. \n. Can you post an example of what you're trying so I can copy it and edit it? \n. OK. Well here's an example of it working ... just look in the console: https://jsfiddle.net/nicolaskruchten/spd346y8/9/\n. There is no particularly easy way other than editing the heatmap function at the bottom of pivot.coffee\n. (which is not written in c3/d3, but rather jQuery)\n. You can now specify a custom color scale function, see the example here: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/montreal_2014.html\n. This is not possible, no.\n. This is by design: these two functions have different behaviours and different parameters.\n. The way you've implemented it is pretty much the way I would do it :)\n. Your input is malformed, and so the behaviour is undefined: every object in the array must have the same keys...\n. Thanks for the feedback!\n. For the input given, are you expecting the c attribute to be included in the output, such that we treat the input as having the union of the attribute of all record? Or are you expecting that the attributes be only the ones present in the first record?\n. The current state of things is that point 2 can be emulated by ensuring that the first row has entries for all desired columns or by using the function input method instead of passing in an array of heterogeneous objects. I'll think about the changes required for point 1.\n. I have a PR open #600 which I believe addresses this issue... Could you take a look and let me know if it meets your needs?. OK, merged and released, I'm closing out this issue :). Thanks very much for this!\n. This is not a supported feature at this time, sorry.\n. Please see this FAQ entry.\n. This is by design: pivot() and pivotUI() accept different parameters. Please check the documentation.\n. Yes but if you read closely they do different things.\n\nOn Mar 15, 2016, at 07:07, Jitesh Vassa notifications@github.com wrote:\nI had a quick look at the docs here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Parameters\nBoth Pivot and PivotUI appear to accept \"aggregatorName\".\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/issues/456#issuecomment-196767411\n.

Not out of the box, but you could write a custom renderer if you like. See https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#supporting-charting-library-x-chartjs-highcharts-etc\n. I think at this point you're pushing this library a bit past its design goals :)\n. OK, I will take a look to see if I can merge the two processors. I don't like the idea of forcing the developer to override the processor for a specific renderer.\n\nWhat's the performance difference between the two processors in your experience so far?\n. Sorry, I should have made my previous comment here instead... My proposal is that instead of allowing the overriding of the \"processor\" we allow the overriding of the entire PivotData class, which allows for more flexibility in implementing different \"processors\" and less coupling. Thoughts?\n. Yes, any replacement would need to have very similar external behaviour... I suppose this would mean I would have to document this class' interface a bit more :)\nIn you case, however, you would just subclass the PivotData class and override the one method so it's fairly easy/low-risk!\n\nOn Jun 22, 2016, at 09:56, Nagarajan Chinnasamy notifications@github.com wrote:\n@nicolaskruchten Thanks for your response.

OK, I've pushed a branch called configurable_pivotdata which contains the changes (in commit eeec720a17fd7). There is a new parameter called dataClass for both pivot() and pivotUI().\n\nPlease let me know if you can work with this and I'll merge into master, otherwise we'll iterate :)\n. Whoops, sorry about the triangle character breakage... I'll revert that change!\n. dataClass change has been merged to master.\n. This is definitely possible. You pass in whatever state you like and every time the onRefresh callback is called, it's called with the latest state. You can then save that state and pass it back into another call.\nCan you describe in more detail what you say is \"not working\" ?\n. If you look at the example here http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/onrefresh.html you'll see that the onRefresh function needs to be passed in as part of the params (i.e. what you have called the state object) and not as a third argument to pivotUI().\n. You're going to have to add the onRefresh callback to the state before passing it in.\n. What is it exactly you are trying to do? Where are you wanting to save the state?\n\nOn Mar 24, 2016, at 02:56, ramesh notifications@github.com wrote:\nI called the on refresh as second parameter as you mentioned in earlier comments passing the state to it.

Where is the state saved and how are you wanting to \"capture\" the state?\n\nThe way pivotUI() works is that it initializes itself with the parameters you pass in, and if you pass in an onRefresh function in the parameters, then every time there is a change, PivotTable.js will call that function, with the current state as input.\n. OK, then you need to do something like this:\n1. get your state object from storage\n2. define a function which takes a state object and saves it\n3. add that function to your state object under the key onRefresh\n4. call pivotUI() with your state object\n. For reference, here is an example with saving/restoring to cookies: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/save_restore.html\n. Data tables don't deal well with rowspans and colspans, so no, it is not supported.\n\nOn Mar 21, 2016, at 08:03, krishnathumma notifications@github.com wrote:\nHi Nicols,\nIs it possible to use Datatables into pivottables?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n.

Performance on a dataset like this should be good up to around 100k rows.\nWhat does your output table look like? i.e. what attributes are you putting in rows and columns?\nRegarding paging, there is no such feature in any builtin PivotTable.js renderer.\n. That looks reasonable. How many different combinations of [ 'ProductName', 'Description', 'Qty', 'TotalSales', 'SalesResp' ] are there? If you have dozens of customers and hundreds of combinations of those columns, performance will suffer greatly as you are trying to render a giant table.\n. There's not a lot you can do to render giant tables faster. You mentioned paging earlier, and that might be your best bet: you could implement your own renderer which supports paging.\n. @srgcrafty I'm not sure what you're trying to do here but can you please open a new issue which describes it and I can try to help you?\n. Please see this FAQ entry.\n. Thanks very much for this!\n. Apologies for the delay.\nI have no real suggestion for you unfortunately... The table renderer outputs text, not HTML, so there is no way to make it display links. The only thing I can think of would be for you to write some jQuery code that would execute after every refresh (i.e. in the onRefresh callback) which would edit the DOM of the output of the table renderer to add the links back in.\n. @deecay I don't think I want to go down that road again, no, it opens up too much complexity, and is only applicable to the table renderers and not the charts. I really think that just post-processing the table is the best option here.\n. If all you want to do is add row-level color striping you can do this with plain CSS, no need for a new renderer.\n. I think that's a fine way to do it :) I don't want to add too many options and bells and whistles to the renderers.\n\nOn Apr 16, 2016, at 11:17, Tho Vo notifications@github.com wrote:\n@nicolaskruchten : I think it should be a renderer, as the user will not always want to display the stripping rows, add it just as an option to let the user can choose how to display.\nI manually did add the renderer by jQuery but I thought it is not a good and manly way to add a renderer .\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n.

Glad you like the library :)\n\nYou can't have the same key (e.g. filter) twice in the same object, so the second one always overwrites the first in your case, explaining the behaviour you're seeing.\nTo do what you want you'll have to do something like:\nfilter: function(row) { return row[\"Example Row\"] != \"Excluded Row\" and row[\"Year\"] == \"2016\"; }\n. This library doesn't touch the input data, so if your field is called a in the input JSON, it will be displayed as a always and never localized.\nI don't understand your second comment about locale-agnosticism, you'll have to provide me with an example of the problem you're encountering...\n. I don't think I agree regarding localizing data labels, I think this is a layering violation. PivotTable.js exists to display data, and labels are part of the data. If you really need to mutate the data, you can use the derivedAttributes and hiddenAttributes parameters to create copies and hide the originals on the fly, or you can preprocess the data before feeding it into PivotTable.js. If space is a consideration, you can use the compact array-of-arrays input format rather than the verbose array-of-objects format. The array-of-arrays format conveniently has all the labels in the first array, making it easy to translate the labels before calling PivotTable.js if that's what you want to do.\nRegarding aggregator/deriver names and pivot() I think your approach is basically the way I would recommend doing this.\n. I appreciate your offer of a pull request, but I don't think this is a feature which I am inclined to add to PivotTable.js at this time. It seems fairly specific to your use-case at the moment, and I'm resisting the addition of new parameters wherever possible.\n. It may well be that you're not alone in wanting this feature, but in the 450 reported issues over the past 3 years you're the first to ask for it :) We'll see.\nRegarding your last question: a better approach might be for your system to generate its own locale information on the fly based on a central registry where you maintain bidirectional mapping of names to entities like aggregators. You probably want to do that anyway to guarantee that you have consistent coverage of locale information for all of the entities you want to support: I accept PRs for language packs but not everyone translates every label and it's hard for me to do QA in languages I don't speak.\nIn general, I understand what you're trying to do but my take is that you're trying to push this library a bit beyond the scope of what it was designed for, so you're bumping up against the limits of the architecture. The existing localization setup was basically designed for simple 'one-time' localized displays of minimally-transformed data rather than to enable the generation of configurations in one locale which would then be stored and re-applied possibly in a different locale, while also translating labels within the input data.\nAt this point I consider this library to be fairly mature and stable, so while it may be possible to evolve the architecture to meet your needs, I'm reluctant to rock the boat very much in a way which would require me to re-work documentation, examples etc.\n. I shall continue to consider it. From my perspective, this is actually a very small number of forks compared to the thousands of clones and downloads per month that I can observe.\n. @PhantomYdn it occurs to me that the extension point you seek actually already exists! \nUnder the hood, pivot() calls a Renderer and passes in a PivotData object. If you define a generic \"chaining\" Renderer which accepts the PivotData object, wraps it with your renaming functionality, and passes it along to whichever underlying Renderer you want to use, I believe this would meet your requirements. The underlying Renderer would call, say, getRowKeys() on the wrapped PivotData object, which would run the correspondance between your desired set of display labels and the underlying, 'compact' labels.\nWrapping a Renderer is pretty easy, it's analogous to the way the Heatmap Renderer is set up: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/blob/master/pivot.coffee#L154\n. Unfortunately not, no.\n. Not with any built-in feature of this library...\n. (to be fair, I never said it's \"not a valid use case\", I said it was an uncommon one :)\n. Here's a cheap way to do it without adding a new parameter: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/mps_rename.html. Hi there,\nUnfortunately, this is not possible. The data is displayed based on a naive natural sort algorithm which is unaware that \"2016-5-9\" is a date, it just knows that it's a string which sorts before the \"2016-6-2\" string. If you represent dates in anything other than YMD order, the data will be plotted out of order, and there is no way to change the display after sorting/displaying.\nSorry,\nNicolas\n. ok!\n. Relative paths should just work wherever absolute paths do... Can you point me to an example of what you're doing that doesn't work?\n\nOn May 25, 2016, at 06:52, rockymenezes notifications@github.com wrote:\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n.

CoffeeScript is fully compatible with Javascript, and if you're more comfortable with Javascript you could modify the compiled CoffeeScript output...

You can now specify a custom color scale function, see the example here: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/montreal_2014.html\n. You can't do this without unpivoting/melting your data to look like this:\n\nCategory    Field       Value    \nA           Value1        2          \nA           Value1        3          \nB           Value1        5          \nB           Value1        6          \nB           Value1        7          \nA           Value2        1\nA           Value2        0\nB           Value2        7\nB           Value2        2\nB           Value2        1\n.

Thanks for the feedback! This is an oft-requested feature but it really is a big change and I'm not planning on implementing it any time soon :)\n. This example will show you want you need: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/mps_prepop.html\nNote the aggregatorName and vals parameters. You can get their definitions here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Parameters\n. The filter box is not meant to be linked to the aggregator i.e. it is not meant to show a 'total'. Indeed it is meant to always just show the number of records in the input which have the given value of the given attribute.\n. Here are some examples of where this is used: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/blob/master/pivot.coffee#L145\n. OK so the issue is that you're mixing up the call semantics of pivot() and pivotUI()... The vals parameter is used by pivotUI() but not pivot().\nThe following will work (note that I removed vals and called the aggregator with a field to compute over):\n``` javascript\nvar sum = $.pivotUtilities.aggregatorTemplates.sum;\nvar numberFormat = $.pivotUtilities.numberFormat;\nvar usFmtPct = numberFormat({ digitsAfterDecimal:1, scaler: 100, suffix: \"%\" })\nvar fractionOfRowSum = $.pivotUtilities.aggregatorTemplates.fractionOf(sum(), 'row', usFmtPct)\n$(\"#output\").pivot(\n  $.pivotUtilities.tipsData, {\n    rows: [\"sex\", \"smoker\"],\n    cols: [\"day\", \"time\"],\n    aggregator: fractionOfRowSum([\"tip\"])\n  });\n```\n.

Happy to help!\n. Thanks for all your hard work on this! I'm glad to see that the small change to the core makes it possible to use your code without needing a full fork.\nWould you consider just hosting this add-on yourself in a separate repo (i.e. without a full copy/fork of the core code), and handling the maintenance for it, instead of me merging it into the core? You could create an NPM module for it which depends on this one etc. I would certainly link to your repo from the FAQ and direct people to it who seek subtotal support. My concern is that I suspect that there will be many feature requests for this renderer (configuring row vs column subtotals, configuring per-level subtotals, collapsible columns, top vs bottom position of the subtotals etc) and I don't think I have the time or energy to respond to all such changes.\nPlease let me know :)\n. OK, I've just made the changes on master, so I'm closing this PR and deleting the branch. I'll do a release shortly :)\n. I'm not sure how to fix this, actually. If we don't specify the chart width/height, then there are rendering bugs in some browsers which cause the charts to not appear until the window is resized...\n. I don't think anyone is actually working on this issue :). Just to be clear: this library's output is basically not responsive at the moment.. I find that most third-party plugins that rely on thead/tbody don't really deal well with multi-row/colspaned column headers, not to mention the fact that they usually ignore the row headers altogether :) \nI'll take a look at just supporting these directly in the table renderer.\n. Oh, I see that your PR does exactly this. I'll test it and merge it this week if I don't see any problems :)\nthanks!\n. merged!\n. OK, doesn't seem to have any layout or CSS impact.\n.

Does it work if you just remove the , suffix: \"%\" part?\n. Yes, this is a limitation of the C3js integration, and I don't know of a good workaround. Basically C3 just receives the underlying number (i.e. 0.52) and displays it directly. To fix this you may need to pass additional options to the C3 renderer.\n. You're right that inclusions is the right parameter... The following should be what you need: \njson\n\"inclusions\": {\n    \"assessment_yr\": [\"2016\"], \n    \"assessment_wk_no\": [\"22\",\"23\",\"24\",\"25\"]\n}\n. Happy to help!\n.

PR #600 should address this.. PR #600 was merged :). Please see this FAQ entry.\n. For these types of modifications, you will need to look at the C3.js documentation and pass those parameters directly into the c3 renderer as in this example: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/scatter.html (in the example only width and height are passed in to C3).\n. My recommendation would be to decorate the table output using jQuery and the onRefresh callback.\n. Great!\n. Check out the onRefresh parameter.\n. Documentation here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Parameters\nExample here: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/onrefresh.html\n. It should be fired, so long as the callback is always in the config being set programatically... You can't just set it once.. Unfortunately sub-objects are not supported. You can get the output format you're looking for with a flat input with fields Type, Level and Date by setting cols to [\"Type\", \"Level\"] and rows to [\"Date\"].\nHope this helps!\nNick\n.

You could do this in an onRefresh call or by wrapping the TableRenderer.\n. Can you please elaborate on this?\n.

What versions of what operating system and browser are you using?\n. I'm going to need to see a video to understand the issue, yes :) thanks!\n. OK, I understand now, thanks for the video!\nCan you confirm that this happens for you on the following example page? http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/mps.html \nIf not, then the problem is in the styling that you are using...\n. First, could you please tell me if you can reproduce the issue with the example page? :)\n. Hmmm. What do you mean about the example being \"lite\"? I'm afraid I don't follow...\nAlso, I believe that the issue is with the actual path that your mouse takes: if you drag straight across, always keeping your mouse within the droppable area, this never happens on the example page (at least for me on Chrome/OSX) but if you drag your mouse out of the droppable area and back in, or wave the mouse around to the left of the droppable area but not in it, then indeed, the element will not be dropped in the left-most position. When you bring the mouse back into the droppable area near the left edge, then the dashed rectangle appears and you can drop in the left-most position.\nFor your original video, I believe that the green element is 'blocking' the droppable area and thus preventing this behaviour.\n. I'm afraid I cannot replicate your behaviour even with very large files. I'm not sure what you mean by \"back-end load\" ... This library does not interact with a server back-end and no processing happens during drag'n'drop (which is handled by the underlying jQuery library anyway).. Try the autoSortUnusedAttrs parameter :)\nhttps://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Parameters\n. I need to see your code, not just screenshots of your IDE :)\nAlso, please note that you need to actually pass in the c3 renderers to the pivotUI() call, not just load them. See this example: https://jsfiddle.net/nicolaskruchten/gq6w05j8/\n. Sorry I'm just getting to this now... How should we handle ths that span multiple columns/rows? scope=\"colgroup\" and scope=\"rowgroup\" ?\n. When you say it is \"not working\" what do you mean? What happens?\n. Thanks for the JSFiddle, that makes things easier!\nInstead of:\njavascript\nrkTest= JSON.stringify(config_copy, undefined, 2);\n$(\"#output\").text(JSON.stringify(config_copy, undefined, 2));\n$(\"#output3\").pivotUI(JsonData, rkTest.replace('\"Table\"','\"Bar Chart\"'));\nyou should use:\njavascript\n$(\"#output\").text(JSON.stringify(config_copy, undefined, 2));\nconfig_copy[\"aggregatorName\"] = config_copy[\"aggregatorName\"].replace('Table','Bar Chart')\n$(\"#output3\").pivotUI(JsonData, config_copy,  true);\nNote the differences:\n1. You were passing in a string as the second parameter, but this parameter expects an object\n2. To 'remote control' a pivot table like this you need to set the third parameter (overwrite) to true\n. So you want to hide the bottom-most row: the header cell, the column totals and the grand total?\n.

Sorry for the long delay in responding... The issue here is that your x axis is textual, rather than numeric, so C3 is just doing the obvious thing and showing all the labels.

This is not supported at the moment, sorry.\n. Glad you like it!\nThis data is kind of an intermediary dataset which is hard to access but by wrapping the PivotData object you might be able to intercept it...

Can you provide some code or a JSFiddle or something? Are you working on something similar to this example? http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/save_restore.html\n. The problem is that the second time you call it, you are not including the onRefresh function as part of the config... You will need to store the output of JSON.parse() in a variable, and add the onRefresh parameter to it before calling pivotUI() again. In fact you will need to do this for every function contained in the serialized config, as functions cannot be serialized/deserialized to/from JSON strings.\n. great!\n. Yes, you'll have to store the output of JSON.parse into a variable, then set the sorters key of that object...\n. Here's an example which might help you: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/text_config.html. This is not part of the supported data model, no.\n. In order to control the display of numbers without altering the core library, you would need to create a custom language-pack/locale file: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Localization\n. Have you tried the 'unusedAttrsVertical' parameter set to true?\n\nOn Sep 17, 2016, at 03:11, Emil Moe notifications@github.com wrote:\nNo solutions to this?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n. ok!\n. Only rows and columns with data are shown, however by default the value 0 is not displayed, so in some cases you can end up with all-empty rows or columns. You can control this via a custom locale, with your own number formatting.\n. Updating an old issue: this aesthetic choice has been reversed, and zeros are always displayed now when there is data in the cell (i.e. 'count' will never show zero because there is nothing to count).. This is a feature, not a bug. If there are many attributes, the unused attributes are laid out to the left instead of top. Check out the unusedAttrsVertical parameter to control this behaviour.\n. In the code above, you are passing data as the first argument, config as the second argument, and config again as the third argument... The third argument is meant to be a boolean, so this is not going to work... https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Parameters\n\nI'm unclear about what specifically you're trying to do here, so I'm not sure what more constructive advice I can give :)\n. Sounds like you need to merge the objects before passing them into pivotUI(), yes. Be careful with the deep/copy behaviour of $.extend() though... read the docs to make sure you know what you're doing, as I've been very surprised in the past by what gets mutated by that function!\n. Here is an example which shows this in action: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/text_config.html. Hmmm I'm not sure about this.

If I understand correctly what you're trying to do, the answer is unfortunately that this is not supported... You can only apply aggregators to fixed input attributes, and then generate columns based on other attribute values. See also this FAQ entry: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#multi\n. This is a very cool idea, thank you! I will take a close look to see if/how to integrate into the core pivot.coffee file :)\n. OK, so after some thought, I integrated something very similar to this into master, but it's a lot simpler and it uses the built-in sorters system so it can handle user-configurable date formats and any other kind of comparator people want to throw in there. Thanks for the idea, though, this was entirely based on this suggestion :). Thanks for the PR!\n\nI'm finally able to take a look at this and I like the approach. I'll try to merge it or something like it over the holidays :)\n. OK, I've merged 87c2e3da58b60c672bee8fe612a8b63a3a217c47 which is based on this PR... thanks for the nudge :). The virtual DOM would not be able to do much with this library, and you would have to force a re-render. You may want to use http://orbjs.net/ instead.\n. Update: I have successfully used this library with React :). It's pretty trivial:\n1. your render method renders a <div id=\"output\">\n2. somewhere else in your component's lifecycle hooks, like in your componentDidUpdate method, you call $(\"#output\").pivotUI( ... ). You need jquery-ui as well :). @nadim it is a bit of a hack, but it's pretty justified in this case because every time you change anything in the input, the whole table gets thrown away and redrawn, so I doubt that React's virtual DOM adds any value here. \nI've thought about rewriting this library in React but I just haven't had/likely won't have the time to manage what would effectively be a fork, and in any case I've been moving away from React towards Mithril in my own projects :). @kurtzace thanks for sharing!\nI should note that I've recently been hired to create an official React-only (no jQuery) port of this library, and the work is underway here: https://github.com/plotly/react-pivottable\nI expect a working release sometime in October, as I'm only working on this 1 day/week at the moment.. If anyone wants to give feedback on the React port, I would greatly appreciate it! It's available here https://react-pivottable.js.org/ :). It's very close to being released, maybe a week!. Unfortunately, number formatting is basically a feature of the locale and probably will remain so... Part of the problem is that the number of digits is what is used to create different aggregators like \"sum\" and \"integer sum\", so one can't just have a global tuning knob for \"number of digits\".\nIdea: if we had a \"scientific\" locale where the number formatter basically returned a fixed-precision output in scientific notation, would that address part of your \"on the fly\" concern?\n. Specifically: we could use the Javascript toPrecision(n) function as a number formatter...\njavascript\nfor(var i=0; i> -15; i--) console.log( (12345*Math.pow(10,i)).toPrecision(4) )\nreturns\n1.235e+4\n1235\n123.5\n12.35\n1.235\n0.1235\n0.01235\n0.001234\n0.0001234\n0.00001235\n0.000001234\n1.234e-7\n1.234e-8\n1.235e-9\n1.234e-10\n. @ckatsulis there is no easy way today to control this from rpivotTable, no, unfortunately.. Yes, the JS source in rpivotTable could be modified but then you would sort of be on your own running a forked version, not able to get CRAN updates etc... . Probably the best thing to do would be for rpivotTable (and the corresponding Jupyter system which I maintain) to use a number formatter with configurable significant digits.. Well, I'm not the maintainer of rpivotTable, so there isn't much I can do to help your specific situation, sorry... I haven't seen this issue be reported on the Python side yet, so it's not really much of a priority just now on that end for me either.. @holstius if you want to have fixed-precision display from within R then it's going to be pretty involved:\n\nYou'll need to create a number-formatting function using toPrecision()\nYou'll need to create a locale file that uses that number-formatting function\nYou'll need to create a version of rpivotTable which uses this locale file\nYou'll need to send a pull-request to the rpivotTable repo to get these changes merged into the official version (optional)\n\nI'm sorry that this is so complex and that I don't have more time to devote to it :(. This is not supported at the moment nor is it really in my plans... You're best off decorating the default output with some jQuery in the onRefresh callback.\n. Ok.

If you're passing in an array-of-arrays then this type of renaming is trivial: just overwrite the header array.\nIn terms of modifying the library itself, I'm increasingly resistant to adding new parameters to an already-long list, especially for situations where preprocessing the data before passing it in is fairly trivial...\n. I'm assuming that the issue you raised in #575 is related to this one...\nCheck out the new example at http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/mps_rename.html for an efficient way to rename things on the fly using a function to map over your input rather than a raw array.. See also #492. I'm going to close this as a duplicate of #492 ... please feel free to follow up with any comments there :). It would be difficult to make this optional, given that this line is output by the CoffeeScript compiler.... Oh I know, and I had to change from the latter form to the former for correctness reasons. You're telling me that this change causes performance issues, but unfortunately correctness trumps performance.\nCan you tell me more about your use-case? I'm not sure I understand the upstream code you're using which needs to define properties on a prototype etc. Is this on the input dataset? This library basically assumes that the input is set of 'plain' objects, likely the result of JSON.parse or something like that. You're doing something different I take it?. OK, but passing in an object with a fullname() method as input to this library doesn't make a lot of sense... It doesn't call methods on objects, it reads fields.. WRT correctness, you can see in issue #288 that you mentioned that without this own-prop check, in certain cases it would throw exceptions.. Ok. Basically the short answer is that getters are not supported by this library at this time :)\n\nOn Dec 14, 2016, at 12:14, Sam notifications@github.com wrote:\nFullname as a letter I meant https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get#Defining_a_getter_on_new_objects_in_object_initializers\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n.

Check out the sorters parameter: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Parameters\n\nThere's an example here: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/montreal_2014.html\nYou might actually even be able to use it to sort dates formatted the way you originally had them, if you want, come to think of it, without formatting them in ISO.. You can do it with the sorters functionality without enumerating all the dates by passing an appropriate comparison function. Here's some documentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort. Here's a new version of an old example, which now includes two ways of sorting things: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/mps_agg.html. There is no renderer instance or API, actually, the renderer is just a function, as you know :)\nThere is, however, the rendererOptions parameter, which a renderer could use to communicate with the outside world: the renderer could call a callback function in the options which would allow it to pass back a communication object.. Well, the whole library is built with functional principles in mind: everything is a function and the only state being stored is in the DOM, so I would not be in favour of changing things just for renderers and not for, say, aggregators, etc.. I must admit I have not tested this code with D3 version 4, so I'm not sure what the incompatibilities are... I'm not even sure how well C3 works with D3 version 4 actually.. D3 v4+ is now supported by C3 v0.5+ so you should use that combination if you need a more recent version of D3. Please note that most of my efforts are going into Plotly support rather than C3 support at this point :). This library doesn't deal very well with \"ragged\" input like this where individual rows don't have the same keys or are missing keys. I'll take a look to see how hard it is to make it work but I'm skeptical that it will be easy.. OK, I have a PR open #600 which should address this, if you want to test it out.. There's no way to do quite what you seek, but maybe a custom aggregator would go part-way?\nhttp://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/mps_agg.html. Yes, right now the TSV option is the best we've got: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#exporting-renderer-output-to-excel-or-images. My feeling is that the architecture of this library is incompatible with a server-side integration along these lines... See #150. This issue is fairly well addressed in the FAQ so I'm closing it. https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#server-side-integration. Hmm, yeah, it seems like one of the jQuery functions is having trouble running on such a large DOM. I'll have to play with it to see if I can work around it but it seems like you've bumped up against a limit of this type of in-browser approach.. Well I suspect the issue is not with the number of rows in the input, it's with the number of rows, columns and cells of the output table. I've successfully used the Heatmap renderer with 100k-row input. But if you have a fully diagonal table with a 9k-row input, then your table will have 9k^2=81M cells ;). My hypothesis is that there is this kind of threshold, yes, but I haven't been able to test that just yet. . I'm having no issues with the heatmap renderer with 475 rows and 156 columns (=74,100 cells) but to be honest this size of table is not really meaningfully usable in my opinion given the amount of scrolling required to get it all in view.\nI am able to replicate your issue with a large number of cells, but there's not much I can suggest other than that this library (and perhaps a browser in general) is not suitable for this sort of task...\n. Well to be clear, this library can aggregate large data sets, but browsers in general are not suitable for displaying large datasets. For example, this system will snappily generate counts for low-cardinality dimensions or tables with hundreds of cells on a underlying dataset with 50,000 rows with 10 attributes. The browser will not easily generate a 50,000-row table with 10 columns.. check out the onRefresh callback parameter. \ndocumentation: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Parameters\nexample: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/onrefresh.html\n. If you call pivotUI() without setting overwrite=true OR if your first call to pivotUI() is with a saved config, then you will need to make sure your saved config contains all the keys you want to configure including aggregators and renderers. You can do this explicitly as in the code above, or you can merge your saved config with a default config of your choice.. I've just added a new example which might help you, @Humano2 ... http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/text_config.html\nIn the future, please don't comment on closed issues if you want help, just create a new issue :). This library doesn't deal very well with \"ragged\" input like this where individual rows don't have the same keys or are missing keys. I'll take a look to see how hard it is to make it work but I'm skeptical that it will be easy.. I believe that PR #600 should address this if you want to test it out.. I'm not sure I understand your question... can you clarify please?. I don't know what \"pivotmf.js\" is... this is not part of this library.. Ah, OK. I'm afraid I can't help you with that, it's sort of an unofficial patch that I don't spend any time maintaining.... Thanks for this PR! I will think about if it makes sense to add a new option for this functionality.. This seems like a bit of a power-user feature to me and I'm not sure how many people would use it, so I'm leaning towards not merging this PR at this point.\nThere is also another, less intrusive extension that was proposed in #556 which I am thinking about. It may make sense to accept a 'text-filter function' as a parameter and then regex or this other proposal could work instead of an API or UI parameter.\nCan you give me a few examples of when a regex option adds a ton of value? Would a fuzzy search work just as well or do you actually need the full power of regex?. I.e. we could replace the current version with this type of logic: https://github.com/bevacqua/fuzzysearch. OK, so I've merged into master some code which will treat the \"filter\" string as a regex if it's prefixed by ~, and does > and < comparisons as well, so I'll close this PR, as the desired functionality is in master now.. You can localize pivot() by passing in localeStrings with the options object. This is also possible with pivotUI() but the extra locale parameter to that function is a shortcut.. You're right that this is not very clear. I'll think about the implications of adding the locale parameter to pivot(). OK @glebfox I think the recent commits to master should fix both of these issues: you can now specify locale for both pivot() and pivotUI() and the options and locale strings are more sensibly merged together, so you should not need to pass localeStrings through rendererOptions if you are using the top-level locale parameter.\nIf you have a second, can you confirm this on your end and I'll do a proper release and update the documentation?. Super! I've just released the change as version 2.6.0 and updated the documentation. Thanks for the bug report :). There is no built-in functionality which will be helpful for this, no, sorry!. Not really, what you're looking for is pretty far out of scope for this library.... I have found it tricky to build the CSS for that. If you have any pointers on a lightweight technique to use (the CSS itself, not a Javascript library that does this) I might be interested in looking at it. The problem is that we would have to fix the table dimensions up front in order to trigger this behaviour.. It looks like the NReco extension to this library does this: https://www.nrecosite.com/pivot_table_aspnet.aspx. What you want to do is created a \"derived attribute\" like \"Gender Imbalance\" in this example: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/mps.html. Basically something like:\njavascript\n\"derivedAttributes\": { \n    \"Precipitation\": function(row){return row[\"Total Rain (mm)\"] + row[\"Total Snow (cm)\"];} \n}\n. No, there isn't such a feature, sorry!\n\nOn Dec 7, 2016, at 17:40, ridonkz notifications@github.com wrote:\nIs there an in-built function to search for keywords which will return the specific rows in pivottable.\nDoes the filter option work for this option?

I think that PR #600 addresses this in a more coherent way in the CoffeeScript version, with some tests etc. I would love some input as to whether or not this would meet your needs.. I'm closing this PR, as I ended up merging #600, which has the same effect.. Thanks for the heads-up, all fixed!. Thanks for the PR!. All done! https://packagist.org/packages/nicolaskruchten/pivottable. The issue is not with the raw number of rows, but with the cardinality of the columns: the number of unique values, because the browser has to add a large number of nodes to the DOM. For example in your data, it's very snappy to make a table with Age and Account, but slows down if you add any of the fields that you filled with hex hashes.. I was only able to replicate your crashing scenario when I tried to put one of the high-cardinality attributes in the rows area and one in the columns area but this makes sense... The resulting table would have 25 million cells in it, and the browser cannot draw this. Is that what you're trying to do?. This is not really a reasonable thing to do... Think about it: a 5000x5000 table is not something a human can read. If each cell was 1 pixel by 1 pixel, you would need a grid of 3x5 HDTVs to display this many pixels!. @gargulamen yes, dist/pivot.js was updated in this PR. Are you grabbing the right version of the file? This hasn't hit the master branch or been released as an NPM package or anything yet.... Well we have to show all the values for all attributes, including the null ones, otherwise filtering will not work, but if you're seeing \"null (0)\" that's a bug that I need to work out :). I fxed the \"null (0)\" issue, and I'm seeing the problem with filtering nulls now. I'll fix that and push again in a bit. Thanks for the feedback on this :). OK, null-filtering is fixed. @gargulamen can you let me know what you think?. All data will appear by default including where attribute values are null, but you can control this via the filter UI or the 'exclusions' parameter. Note that both of these apply to entire records! If you exclude all records with any null value you risk excluding all sorts of data from your output.\nOn Dec 28, 2016, at 08:59, dcvidigal notifications@github.com wrote:\nHi, First of all congrats for the awesome component \ud83d\ude04\nI saw some issues about the null keys on json and so on, and I saw that this fix works great, but I have a question.\nDoes this fix clean up the null rows/colls?

It kind of sounds like you want to build your own Renderer based on DataTables... If you did this you would not use the onRefresh callback but rather your Renderer would be called directly with a PivotData object that you could interrogate to display data in any format you want.. The first argument to the Renderer is a PivotData object which has a forEachMatchingRecord(criteria, callback) function. If you wanted to, say, log all filtered data to the console, you could have a renderer that looks something like this, with empty criteria:\n\n```javascript\nvar testRenderer = function(data){\n  data.forEachMatchingRecord({}, function(record){ console.log(record); })\n}\n```.

(also, thanks for the kudos :) . Unfortunately not. Please see this FAQ entry.. @MaySahu unfortunately this is not possible.. Thanks!. Yep! Check out the documentation for Aggregators: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Aggregators. Yes, aggregators are used to compute row, column, and grand totals as well. The aggregator is called with the rowKey and colKey. When the rowKey is [] the returned value is the column total etc. What you will need is an aggregator that behaves differently when one or both of rowKey or colKey is [].. Sorry, I should read my own documentation :) ... You're in a total cell when rowKey or colKey is null, not []!. Can you show me what you tried?. Ah, sorry about that! I'll have to fix the documentation and learn to use my instincts more :). Sorry for the long delay in responding! I can't think of an easy way to get what you want, unless you use custom aggregators with specific formatting functions.... super!. You would have to add to the gchart_renderers.coffee and d3_renderers.coffee files.... Looks like you're not importing the library correctly.... I'd be interested in a PR that does this efficiently, as I haven't figured out a good way to do it :). @uwekoenig you can already set the limit with menuLimit...?.

Yeah, this is a problem with the natural sort function, as the dash is read as a dash and not a minus.. OK, PR #652 should address this. I'll likely merge it tomorrow (and then look at your PR :) . Should be resolved in v2.9.0. Sorry I let this issue fall through the cracks... Do you still require assistance with this?. No, you will have to handle this outside the pivot table widget.... In answer to your Question 1... PivotTable.js is a Javascript library that runs in the browser so it knows nothing about tables and joins etc. If you have tables in a database that you want to join and display using this library, you will need to make the output of the join query available to a browser in a format like CSV or JSON via some server-side technology.\n\nIn answer to your Question 2: PivotTable.js is a display library only, so there is no mechanism for anyone to enter data into it, nor any mechanism for it to transmit data anywhere, it just takes input and displays it.. I'm not sure what a \"google database\" is... Can you explain?\nIn general, the answer is that you need to convert your data from whatever format it lives in to one of the supported formats you listed.. Yeah, you will have to convert from this cols/rows object into one of the supported input formats yourself, before being able to use this type of data with this library.. First, an aside: from your screenshots, you're not using the latest version of this library, which now includes a \"cancel\" button.\nThat being said, what do you think should be the behaviour of the popup being closed in the background and why? Should it cancel and leave the selection unchanged? Or should it apply the selection? I've never found a satisfactory answer to this, which is why I've stayed with the current behaviour.. Thanks for the fix!. Interesting.\n\nshould be pretty easy to host this centrally\nthis will likely not work on an entirely client-side basis, as this library starts to crawl around 100k rows, however in most cases you can pre-aggregate your millions of rows on the server and ship a smaller result to the client\nyou can definitely have multiple tables per page but they will not share the memory representation of the dataset: a copy will be made for each table.\nthis is supported via Aggregators: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Aggregators. Try setting the overwrite parameter to true: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Parameters#pivotuiinput-options-overwrite-locale. Great!. You can use the onRefresh parameter to define a function which is called every time the user interacts with the pivot UI. See the example here: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/onrefresh.html. No, this mechanism is unrelated to exporting.. You can pass in the chart size using rendererOptions like in the example here: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/scatter.html. The inclusions/exclusions mechanism is basically a whitelist/blacklist system to set/clear the checkboxes in the UI on an enumerated, per-value basis, there is no way to pass in a function there. The filter mechanism is more blunt: you can pass in a function but the data is fully hidden from the UI altogether.\n\nYour best bet would be to dynamically-generate a list of inclusions.. Please see this FAQ answer: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#subtotals. You're best off hiding the dropdowns in CSS.. You should be able to overwrite the settings using the overwrite parameter, yes.. Can you... elaborate?. Yes, pivot() and pivotUI() accept different parameters, please check the documentation: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Parameters. There's no built-in way to do this, but a small modification on the count aggregator should be easy. I'll think a bit about what the default should be... . Check out this example for how to listen to configuration changes and force configuration changes: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/save_restore.html. You'll need to create a locale with a number formatter that displays 0.. Displaying 0 is now the default :). values is not a valid parameter... did you mean vals ?. See the answer to #650 \n. Very strange. can you post a more complete example that I can play with?. Indeed, this renderer only makes sense in the context of positive values..... OK, great, looking forward to it!. Thanks for the PR! I'll take a look when I have some time, yes :). Fixed with v2.15.0!. OK, I've just merged in the changes from this PR to master, with darkred instead of red. Thanks for the PR and apologies for taking so looong to merge it :). You'll have to set the override parameter to true.. I'm going to need a bit more context here or an input sample or a JS Fiddle or something... There is not enough info here for me to help you :). Just like in the example, you add a key to your options object like this:\noptions[\"rendererOptions\"] = { table: { clickCallback: function(..){..} } }. Great!. Unfortunately no. In fact there is no support for sorting in general :). Min and Max will accept strings, and you can use the \"List unique values\" aggregator to show more than one string value.. Sorry, Min and Max will not accept strings, but First and Last will.. @Bsidey you need to use \"Table\" and the rendererName and \"List Unique Values\" as the aggregatorName.. Oh, I see, you're using pivot() and not pivotUI(). Please note that these two functions take different arguments! In this case you should not pass in vals, aggregatorName, or rendererName but just use aggregator: $.pivotUtilities.aggregatorTemplates.listUnique()([\"clname\"]).\nThe following code does work, I just tested it:\n```javascript\nvar mps = [{\"avail_date\":\"2017-03-13\",\"avail_time\":\"10:00:00\",\"avail\":1,\"appointmentid\":1,\"managebac_id\":10239301,\"pname\":\"Florence\",\"clname\":\"Mona Lot\",\"clid\":52}]\n$(\"#output\").pivot(mps, {\n  rows: [\"avail_date\",\"avail_time\"], cols: [\"pname\"],\n  aggregator: $.pivotUtilities.aggregatorTemplates.listUnique()([\"clname\"]),\n  rendererOptions: {\n    table: {\n      clickCallback: function(e, value, filters, pivotData){\n        var appId = [];\n        pivotData.forEachMatchingRecord(filters,\n                                        function(record){ appId.push(record.appointmentid, record.avail); });\n        alert(appId.join(\"\\n\"));\n      }\n    }\n  }\n});\n``\n. Happy to help!. Interesting. How does this deal with very large output? My understanding was that data URIs had an upper limit on length?. That's right, but it's not that hard to convert from one to the other: just look up the aggregator in the list of aggregators by name, and the same for renderers :). Great!. @frankernesto87 please do not comment on old, closed issues... rather create new ones.. Try theoverwrite` parameter: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Parameters#pivotuiinput-options-overwrite-locale. Great!. Thanks for this! \nI have considered this approach in the past and have always found it a bit too brittle... Relying on whether or not Date.parse returns NaN for the first value of a series seems dangerous to me, especially since any number will parse as a date. In addition, Date.parse has odd behaviour for various commonly-used formats: for example new Date(Date.parse(\"10-10-19\")) returns \"Thu Oct 10 2019 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (EDT)\" whereas new Date(Date.parse(\"2010-10-19\")) returns \"Mon Oct 18 2010 20:00:00 GMT-0400 (EDT)\".\nI wonder if a more flexible approach wouldn't be to accept a function to do this detection, so that developers could \"choose their poison\", so to speak, if they know they are passing in dates in MM/DD/YY or YYYY-MM-DD format etc.. Regarding the idea of cumulative sums, you may want to check out issue #140 :). (oh, and as a PS: pasting multi-line blocks of code in Github is usually done surrounded by triple-backticks, to preserve formatting. You can optionally add a language as I did above :). I'm not really clear on what you're trying to do here... can you provide a bit more detail please?. Unfortunately, it is not possible to use 2 aggregators at the same time like this: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#multi. The solution above works right? If so, then something like the following is an equivalent pure-CSS variant on the recommendation in the FAQ.\n```css\noutput-hidden select, #output-hidden .rowTotal, #output-hidden .colTotal, #output-hidden .pvtGrandTotal, #output-hidden .pvtTotalLabel {display: none}\n```. Glad you like the library!\nUnfortunately there are no features built-in for this kind of conditional formatting. To get this kind of thing you would have to copy and modify the heatmap function more extensively than just playing with the options (which only allow you to modify the colour scale, not change the colour logic).\nAt a high level, what the heatmap function does is it iterates through the table cells using jQuery and adds formatting based on the relative values of the cells. What you're looking for is actually simpler, as it's cell-by-cell. \nThe basic code you need is something like this, if you're writing the pivot table to a div with id output... you just find all the td tags with class .pvtVal and then change their format based on their contents:\njavascript\n$(\"#output\").find(\".pvtVal\").each(\n    function(){ \n        if($(this).data(\"value\") > 10) { \n            $(this).css(\"background-color\", \"red\"); \n        } \n    }\n)\n. This isn't possible, no. What sort of logic are you doing in an aggregator that would be conditional on inclusion/exclusion? Those parameters basically control which records are passed into the aggregator.... Interesting! Can you show me an example so I can better understand the order of operations to see if I can find a way to get you those values? I'm still not clear how they are to be used... . Not yet, I'm sorry.. No update. I'm afraid that this type of data manipulation is out of scope for PivotTable.js.. This seems like a good idea on the surface, but the way PivotTable.js is architected, the data manipulation is heavily enmeshed with the UX, so if this was desired, I would recommend forking or creating a new project.. The only other option I would envision would be to write a custom version of PivotData and passing it in via the dataClass parameter but this would need to do a fair amount of gymnastics internally to meet the existing API. You'd need to provide a custom set of aggregator generators to signal to the data class which operation you want, then you'd have to build a tree of aggregator-like functions that wouldn't accumulate the result of the operations but look them up in another library's data model. I suspect that it's doable but I'm not sure that the ends would justify the means... The existing PivotData class is already fairly efficient: it does just one pass through the data and computes a group-by.. This is a pretty good idea! I would happily accept a Pull Request for it :). I'm not sure I understand what you're asking here... Can you elaborate please?. This is much clearer, thanks!\nFor question 1: you can use the menuLimit option to show more items in the filter dropdowns, but this will slow down performance of the initial render.\nFor question 2: there is no feature for this but it can be emulated like this: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/mps_rename.html. Sorry to reply so late... Are you still seeking assistance with this issue?. There is no way to force this as a default, but of course you can use the normal exclusions mechanism as shown above. I'm not sure what kinds of problems were encountered there.. Sorry to get back to you so late... Are you still seeking assistance with this?. You'll have to define a custom Aggregator for that.... I'm having trouble understanding what you're looking for, but I think you want to customize the chart tooltip?\nIf that's right, you will have to pass through some C3js directives to the renderer. \nHere is how C3js allows you to customize tooltips: http://c3js.org/samples/tooltip_format.html\nHere is an example that shows how to pass parameters through to C3js: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/scatter.html\n. I'm sorry, I don't understand what you mean by \"step by parameter an entire row of the table\" ... Can you clarify please?. I don't think you will be able to have conditional formatting on your tooltips in this way, sorry :(. Update: the C3 charts now use the aggregator's number formatters, which doesn't give you exactly what you wanted but goes partway.. This is a good idea but I don't have time to implement it at the moment. You may be able to accomplish this by modifying c3_renderers.coffee but I'm afraid I can't help you with this in the next little while.... I'm not really sure what you're asking for here... can you elaborate please?. Ah I understand now.\nThe idea behind the attribute bubbles is that there is always one per attribute in the dataset. I'm not in favour of changing the current behaviour, as would make the UI more confusing if things kept appearing and disappearing. If a user were to see a preconfigured pivot table and then they changed the filters, new attribute bubbles would seemingly-arbitrarily appear.... there is no supported parameter for this, but you can get the same effect by hiding the UI elements with CSS.. If you check the documentation for pivot() you will see that it does not accept the same parameters as pivotUI()... specifically, it does not accept exclusions or inclusions but rather just a filter function parameter. Under the hood, pivotUI() uses the exclusions to build a filter function, you can see the code here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/blob/master/pivot.coffee#L979\nPS: just to be clear, noting that something is \"very critical\" for you comes across as quite demanding on my time, which I provide freely to support this library, and doesn't really serve to accelerate my responses.... @PixelatedFigure please create a new issue describing your problem and I'll try to help.. I'm having trouble understanding what you're looking for here... can you elaborate please?. OK, I understand. This is not possible, no... Here is the FAQ entry: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#multi. I have considered all of these cases in the past and settled on the current behaviour to give the user explicit control over whether they want to apply or cancel whatever modifications they might have made to the filter while it was open. The original behaviour was to auto-close-and-apply when you clicked outside of it, and it caused usability problems.. You're coming on a bit strong here with \"we must totally reconsider\" etc :)\nI've been maintaining this library and receiving input for a few years now and it's been working fine for the majority of folks so I'm frankly not all that inclined to make major changes.... Let me see if I can try to rephrase: if the dropdown auto-closes, there has to be a default action, either apply or cancel. Neither of those is a non-surprising default, in that there are always some users who will expect auto-apply and some who will not. The choice I have made, which I remain comfortable with, is to not choose a default action and force the user to explicitly apply or cancel via the provided buttons. . See for example this feedback: #154 against the idea of auto-apply on close.\nThat said, there has also been echoes of your current feedback re multiple dropdowns open at the same time: #622. I've implemented some different behaviour in the sibling library https://react-pivottable.js.org/ ... instantaneous application of checkboxes, no cancellation, and 'tear away' functionality to place the dropdowns wherever you like. What do people think of these features? Which ones would be worth back-porting to this library?. Thanks for this PR!\nI'm not sure that this is something I want to bake into the library itself, because some of the aggregators like listUnique can output lots of text which will need to be wrapped.... There is no support for pagination, no, sorry!. I'm afraid I don't understand what you're trying to do here, can you clarify please?. You can generate this ratio using the \"Sum over Sum\" aggregator and passing in Actual and Target as the arguments, but you cannot create a table which simultaneously shows Target, Actual and Ratio, you can just show the Ratio.. Yes, sorry for the delay :) And thanks for the PR!. No, this is a read-only reporting component.. I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to do here... This library doesn't convert from one JSON representation to another.. Implementing multiple aggregators is a major UI challenge and I don't have the time at the moment to envision when it could be done. Basically, multiple aggregators are not on the roadmap for this project.. Yes, you will have to change pretty much every part of the system to\naccommodate this feature :)\nOn Wed, Apr 12, 2017 at 08:19 Saumya Jain notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nCould you guide me whether my thinking is right or not?

Thanks for this, and sorry it took so long to get it merged in :). Unfortunately this is a C3 bug :(. Update: this is not a C3 bug . Sorry, hit close too early! meant to add \"... and will be fixed shortly!\". This is now fixed, and I recommend that rpivotTable be updated ASAP with the new code... sorry for the bug!. Yes, unfortunately C3js doesn't support D3 version 4 at the moment: https://github.com/c3js/c3/issues/1648\n\nThe only workaround would be to use a different charting plugin like the Google Charts one.. @paulovieira interesting, I hadn't heard about billboard.js. If the API is similar enough, perhaps just loading it as the c3 object would work?\nI'm slowly moving to supporting plotly.js as the preferred charting renderer for this library (given that I'm a Plotly employee now!) so I don't have a lot of time/incentive to devote to C3/Billboard/etc.. the uiTable variable is just a jQuery object referencing the table DOM node, so you can access a copy of it any time via jQuery with the proper selector.... For example, if you're adding the pivot UI to a div with id output then the following jQuery call will get you a reference to what you're looking for: $(\"#output table.pvtUi\"). Did you load the Danish localization file?. For example, if you view the source of this example: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/mps_fr.html you will see the line\nhtml \n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"../dist/pivot.fr.js\"></script>. This library is not really a Javascript replacement for Pandas... It does not return any values, it writes them to the DOM.. It sounds like you're asking about using multiple aggregators in the same table, which is not supported, unfortunately: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#multi. 1. Glad you like it!\n2. This library happily handles up to around 100k rows of input. Beyond that you will need to feed it either pre-aggregated data or pre-filtered data, as you say from an API that does this server-side, usually by interacting with a database.. Well, what you want to do is going to be very difficult if not impossible\ndue to the synchronous/asynchronous mismatch between the PivotTable library\nand the way HTTP calls work in the browser, unfortunately.

Yes of course, you can pass in the default aggregators using $.extend:\n\njavascript\naggregators: $.extend($.pivotUtilities.aggregators, {\"custom agg\": <whatever> })\n\nYes, you can preserve the higher order behaviour by 'peeling off' a layer of functions:\n\n```javascript\n// your example\n\"Custom Agg\": function() { return sumOverSum(intFormat)([\"world\", \"hello\"]); }\n//peeling off a layer\n\"Custom Agg\": sumOverSum(intFormat) \n```. Glad that this worked for you, sorry for the typo, I'll fix it :). There is no built-in functionality for this: the pivot table displays the data it is given, so if you want to show zeros, the data will need to contain zeros :). did you still want help with this?. Interesting ideas! there is no way to do this at present in as general a way as you're asking for, but a workaround would be for you to define a custom aggregator which fixes the attributes used as the values, and then includes a type-appropriate formatting function..

Ah, you're using this from Jupyter... The best place for issues with the Jupyter integration is that module's repository (https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/jupyter_pivottablejs) as the current repository is for the underlying Javascript library. Note that this is Javascript library, so Java has nothing to do with it :)\n\nIn terms of resolving your problem, I wasn't able to see the screenshot: can you please visit https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/issues/703 and paste it in a comment?. Any update here?. Neither of these is a supported feature, no.. There's no built-in way to do this, but a little bit of jQuery work should do the trick here.... Glad you like the tool!\nBoth of your suggestions are good, but I'll be frank and say that I'm unlikely to implement either of them... the first one is the most-requested feature but would require a major rethink of the architecture and UX, and the second one is a more power-user-oriented feature with big UX challenges (basically providing reasonable error messages for users who typo when inputting expressions).. It only relies on sortable :). There's no built-in alternative to something like jquery-ui's sortable and I'm unlikely to remove this dependency in the near future, as it's been part of this library from the beginning :). Unfortunately, I don't think this will be possible directly, as nothing in the system works cross-attribute like this: every attribute is treated separately.\nThe only thing I can recommend is to concatenate your type and severity fields with a dash or something, and use a sorter, such that debit-high is less than credit-low etc. There is no built-in way to do this, no, but of course you may hack the existing renderers or create new ones :). Shouldn't be that hard... there's a documentation page in the wiki and you\ncan look at the source for the existing ones for inspiration :)\nOn Thu, May 11, 2017 at 12:30 svpace notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nMy thoughts exactly :) I will try to look it on the weekend.

I don't believe that this has anything to do with $.extend ... If another library adds functions to Array.prototype then iterating over arrays will access these functions. The Coffeescript for own construct is meant to avoid this issue, and pivot.coffee does make use of this construct so I'm not sure why this issue crops up. My bigger issue is that this library relies on for own all over the place so I can't just add one or two special-purpose checks and assume that this is fixed.. For context, here is the for own call that generates the colAttrs line mentioned above: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/blob/master/src/pivot.coffee#L488 but there are many others.\n\n. Done! thanks :). You can use the pivot() function instead of pivotUI(). There is no API for this, but you can just use the CSS classes that are there to do it.... A couple of things:\n1. It seems like you're using jupyter_pivottablejs which is not hosted in this repo but rather https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/jupyter_pivottablejs so that would be the place to report issues, not here\n2. Can you give me more details about your setup? I'm not familiar with Spyder, and jupyter_pivottablejs has only been tested in standard Jupyter. Does Spyder have a Jupyter component to it? jupyter_pivottablejs is specifically designed to work with Jupyter, not Spyder.. There's no option to control that so you'll have to fork or modify the\ndefault renderer.\nOn Tue, May 16, 2017 at 09:33 riyaz1989 notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHi Nicolas,\nFirst of all thanks for providing great stuff.\n-\nI am using pivot.js and pivotUI() for showing table.\n   -\nCurrently showing my rows in merged form in table, I don't want to\n   show it in meged form, All rows will show seprately.

There's no programmatic way to access the output of the pivot table... There is the TSV exporter, however: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/mps_export.html. You can control number formatting by creating your own locale file. Number formatting is specified via a function so you can roll your own adaptive version if you like :). En fait je parle fran\u00e7ais aussi :) Je ne comprends pas trop ton issue par contre... peux-tu me donner plus d\u00e9tails stp? Ou mieux, peux-tu me le montrer sur JSFiddle ou CodePen ou autre outil du genre?. I haven't found a good workaround, no :(. This has now been fixed.. The current behaviour is explained by the fact that a string in the format \"hh:mm:ss\" is not a number, so is not summable, averagable, etc. \"list unique values\" will concatenate all unique values of the field with a comma as a divider, which is why you're seeing the output you're seeing.\n\nIn order to get the behaviour you're looking for you will either have to convert your input to numbers, and use the built-in aggregator templates with a custom number formatter, or you can roll your own aggregators which will parse \"hh:mm:ss\" to a number first if you really need to leave your input as-is.. Here is the documentation for localization, which is basically what you want to do with number formatting: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Localization ... it contains a link to the aggregator/templates documentation: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Aggregators\nYou can avoid using a button by using the onRefresh callback, which is called after every refresh.. In general, one doesn't encounter this problem all that often, because most fields are either used in the rows/columns OR as the input to an aggregator, but rarely both. There is no way to remap things within the library so if you really need to do what you're trying to do, you will likely need to to your input add a second copy of your numerical data columns containing the strings you're looking for. The derivedAttributes parameter might be of use here :). The correct order is:\n\njQuery\n(Optional for pivot_ui to work) jQuery-UI\npivot.js\n(Optional for D3/C3 renderers) D3\n(Optional for C3 renderers) C3\nany optional renderers\n\nYou can see it working in any of the examples such as this one: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/mps.html\n. You'll have to upgrade to the newest version of this library for this to work :). I've updated the JSFiddles in the examples page to use version 2.13.0 of this library, which allows the order from sorters to get pass through to C3.. Just use the rowOrder and colOrder parameters. Documentation is here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Parameters. Have you tried passing in a custom sorter ?.

Hmm, I'm sorry but I don't understand... Can you elaborate please?. Hmmm there is a problem with the math here then: even if one person can say they like both apples and bananas and video games, you don't have 133% of people liking video games :). OK, well you'll have to build a custom aggregator that implements something like count(x)/countUnique(y) or something like that... You can probably use the Sum over Sum one as a starting point.. There is no built-in way to do this but you may be able to pass extra directives to C3 via rendererOptions.... Here you can see the size object being passed to C3 via rendererOptions: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/scatter.html. A couple of points of feedback:\n\n\nThe name sorting is confusing with the existing sorters\nThere is already an option autoSortUnusedAttrs that can sort unused attributes. Ah, sorry, I misunderstood your intent here. You are concerned about the sort order of attributes in the aggregator dropdowns, right?\n\nI think it makes sense to actually just always use naturalSort for these, rather than make it optional. In fact, now that I think about it, it probably makes sense that the initial display order of the unused attributes is also natural-sorted. autoSortUnusedAttrs resorts them on drop, which is a different thing entirely.. There is no built-in way to do this, no, but I should mention that any change in the UI (dropdown selection, drag/drop) causes a full re-render. The only thing that doesn't is if you close a filter menu without changing anything or if you drop something to the same location it was on.... I see from your profile that you're working on a React-based pivot library... If you're doing benchmarks to compare against PivotTable.js I'd love to see them, I've been pondering a React port myself :). Cool, looking forward to seeing what you come up with!\nMy guess is that React will not be faster for large tables because the majority of operations require a full redraw. PivotTable.js uses raw DOM operations in its TableRenderer whereas React will also have the overhead of the virtual DOM but none of the benefits because it's a full redraw not a small diff.. Ah, interesting.\nMy broader feeling is that huge tables are generally not a good way to look at datasets anyway, so I've never been that concerned about making them very fast ;). FYI the React port is almost done, in case you want to take a look and/or give feedback :) https://react-pivottable.js.org/. @turnerniles nothing firm  or committed to or written down at the moment, no, why do you ask? Are you looking for a specific feature, or looking for a way to contribute or...?\nBy way of a slightly longer answer... PivotTable.js has basically been a spare-time project for the past five years for me, but I built react-pivottable while working for Plotly, so I'm more likely to add features and do new development on react-pivottable, while maintaining and back-porting features to PivotTable.js as appropriate. I'm likely to add Plotly renderers to PivotTable.js fairly soon, for example ;)\nOn the react-pivottable side, I'm hoping to achieve feature-parity with PivotTable.js soon (still missing area charts, localization, a few other bits and pieces) and a couple of new chart-types and interaction features. After that it'll basically be a question of what kinds of features get requested most. Plotly also does sponsored development, so react-pivottable may end up accumulating some features/get integrated into various places that way.\n. Hi Jeremy,\nThis documentation page outlines all the ways to get data into the library: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Input-Formats\nHope it helps!\nNicolas. I'm afraid I'm not familiar enough with ExtJS to be able to provide any more specific advice, I'm sorry :). This is not supported, no. The checkboxes are user-controlled and are all treated independently, despite any underlying data dependencies.. This will be fairly tricky to do I expect, but beyond that I have no real\nsuggestions, sorry...\nOn Wed, Jun 14, 2017 at 02:43 anishdavy notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nOh!!

Check out the documentation for the overwrite parameter here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Parameters#pivotuiinput-options-overwrite-locale (note: it's not part of the config, it's a separate parameter to pivotUI(). It's not hard, but I'm pretty sure there was a reason why I didn't do this at the outset. I'll need to dig into it to remember why not :). @01 that seems about right!. In your second screenshot there are 2 issues:\n1. c3 and d3 are commented out so they are not loaded\n2. the load order matters, it has to be: d3, then c3, then the renderers.. Probably the easiest thing for you to do would be to render in an invisible element using pivot() rather than pivotUI() and grabbing the output from there.... Its definitely possible to do with pivot() but the call semantics are slightly different.. Oh nothing here is mobile-optimized or responsive in terms of layout... the\nonly mobile-related thing in the examples is the inclusion of a library to\nhandle touch interaction.\nOn Wed, Jun 28, 2017 at 01:11 Mark Traynor notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nWhen I view the example optimized for mobile devices, it does not work.

Do the examples from https://pivottable.js.org/ load in IE11 for you?. I've tested this in IE11/Win7 with no issues.... If it runs well on the site then the issue must be in the way you're serving the files locally.... Glad you're liking this library!\n\nTo solve your issue, set the third parameter of pivotUI() (the overwrite parameter) to true as shown here: https://pivottable.js.org/examples/save_restore.html. It would be easier for you to just write a renderer, which is the intended way to access that information for display :). If you look here: https://pivottable.js.org/examples/onrefresh.html you will see the inclusions are being passed to the onRefresh callback.... (Except in the case of everything being included.). If it works it works :). This issue probably belongs in the issue tracker in the repo for the Python pivottablejs module, no? https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/jupyter_pivottablejs\nI created an Azure Notebooks account to help you debug this but was unable to install the module... how do you do it?. @AykutBurak sorry for the late reply... Did you load the fr locale file?. Yes, just pass in a function to aggregator ... If you look at the parameters, pivot() take different arguments from pivotUI(). https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Parameters. 1. No, all columns must be computed with the same aggregator\n2. Yes, you can easily create custom aggregators: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Aggregators. Unfortunately while JSON is a fine way to get data into this library, it expects either array-of-(non-nested!)-objects or array-of-array as a format. Basically a table of records with named scalar attributes.. I've updated the Input Formats documentation: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Input-Formats. @andtov can you tell me a bit about how you would expect this to work? I'm not clear on how this library would be useful on nested data... would you expect it to flatten out all objects and generate attribute names like a.b ?. OK. Are you able to just flatten the nested JSON before handing it off to the library? Does that meet your needs?. This is not possible, no... It used to be but because other projects are integrating this library with potentially unsafe input, for security reasons I rolled that feature back.. See #401 for the full details.. You should be able to just back out the changes from PR #401 to get what you want, yes.. There is no way to disable sorting, no, because the output needs to be deterministic and there is no obvious way to preserve the input order within the various transformations that occur. You can provide your own sorting functions on a global or per-attribute basis, though, so you can control the order beyond just up or down. Check out the sorters parameter.. can you give me an example of the JSON you're passing into the pivotUI() call?. the problem is that you're passing empty objects for aggregators and renderers so the default ones aren't loaded. You either need to not pass in those parameters or pass in an object of functions.. Yes, the default aggregators are available at $.pivotUtilities.aggregators.. there was no image uploaded... I should add that issues with Subtotal.js should be address to that repo, not here: https://github.com/nagarajanchinnasamy/pivottable-subtotal-renderer. awesome! glad you're all sorted out :). those already work in the filter :). I'm not sure I'm understanding, can you give a few more details please?. Thanks for this PR, and apologies for taking so long to respond!\nI'm weighing the complexity of merging this PR and maintaining the documentation etc, as compared to recommending that developers do something similar to the Heatmap and Barchart renderers, which basically walk the output of the Table Renderer and tweak the DOM.. Interesting. Tell me more about the \"hints\" you were using?\nRegarding documentation, I should really get around to making a page about\nrendererOptions :)\nN\nOn Thu, Sep 21, 2017 at 20:48 svpace notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI've struggled with this decision myself.

Neither is exporting other than with the export renderer: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#exporting-renderer-output-to-excel-or-images. Like I said, there is no built-in way to export to Excel or CSV, sorry :). 1. See here: https://pivottable.js.org/examples/save_restore.html\n2. I don't understand what you're asking.. I'm sorry but I cannot understand what you're asking for :(. OK, but as I told you above:\n\n\nFreezing columns and rows is not a feature of this library.\nExporting to Excel is not a feature of this library.\n\nIf you need to accomplish the goals above, you will have to write your own code for this, and I suggest you seek help on StackOverflow.. It should be pretty easy to add some click handles using jQuery after rendering is done. You can do this in the onRefresh callback.. Hmmm that would be difficult. I should see about just making the headers clickable using the same mechanism as the cells. I don't have a lot of time to commit right now but I'll try to get to it. I would also accept a pull request that does this :). Unfortunately, this is an issue in the underlying charting library, which is out of my hands... Sorry.. This was actually not a bug in the underlying library but rather one in this library, and which has been fixed :). See this commit: 854d821b1727b0b85f65d709fd7d0ab610a4cc06. Specifically line 73 of the change to src/c3_renderers.coffee. c3_renderers.min.js is the compiled output of c3_renderers.coffee.\nIn any case, just upgrade to the latest version and you're good  to go..  I recommend you just upgrade all the files to the latest version, including pivot.min.js etc. I can't provide any help if you just patch certain files and don't use the full versioned release of this library :). If you take the code you initially gave me and use it in this fiddle you should see what you're looking for:\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/nicolaskruchten/gq6w05j8/. You're going to need to give me some more details here... what does your data look like? what kind of chart do you want? Are there any examples at https://pivottable.js.org/ which look like what you want?. I don't understand, I'm sorry. Can you give me some concrete examples, like the actual data or some screenshots of the chart?. OK, now I see. The bad news is that there's no built-in way to do this, you're going to have to do a lot of parsing and transforming of this object to be able to feed it to PivotTable.js.. The charting library is http://c3js.org/ if that's what you mean.... You can't disable the triangles, no.. You can see the configuration object here: https://pivottable.js.org/examples/onrefresh.html ... try some checking/unchecking some boxes and you'll see.\nThe full documentation is here and it's very straightforward: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Parameters#pivotuiinput-options-overwrite-locale. There's no way to do this at the moment, no, unfortunately. Issue #191 would be a great way to do it but I haven't found a reasonable implementation yet :). I've just merged the changes from #408 and added the hiddenFromAggregators and hiddenFromDragDrop parameters, which may be of use here.. The renderer name is not 'Export' but 'TSV Export' ... . Hmmm. Unfortunately you'll have to give me a JSFiddle or something as this isn't enough to go on, sorry :). Glad you like this library! \nThe onRefresh callback will provide the entire configuration, including the aggregator name. See for example: https://pivottable.js.org/examples/onrefresh.html. @sujeetsks please do not add unrelated comments to pre-existing issues, but rather create new issues.\nTo answer your question, \"mps.json\" and $.pivotUtilities.tipsData are both sample datasets used for the examples. You need to replace these with your own data, in a compatible format, following the documentation here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Input-Formats.

When you say \"does not render\" what do you mean? Does it show an error or...? Please note that the dataset you're passing in is the demo \"tips\" dataset: $.pivotUtilities.tipsData, and it's only available if you load that specific JS file.. Most likely you have loaded some other library which adds functions to the Array prototype, which is not well-supported by this library unfortunately.. Are you using the latest version of the pivottablejs Python module? It should support this feature now.. You'll have to upgrade to version 0.8.0 of the pivottablejs module to get this functionality.. If you're installing using conda then unfortunately you're not using the official version of this project, but rather this one: https://github.com/ContinuumIO/pivottablejs and the maintainer is not being very cooperative with me :(. This example shows you how to reset/overwrite the config: https://pivottable.js.org/examples/save_restore.html\n\nYou need to set the overwrite parameter to true.. Unfortunately, neither of those use-cases are supported, sorry! You can copy and modify the Table Heatmap renderer to get conditional formatting if you like but I don't really see how you could get a custom grand total at this time.. This is not currently supported by this library, so you'll have to use jQuery to add events to the table to handle these clicks.. You can probably use the clickCallback mechanism to do something similar to this by reading the filter object: https://pivottable.js.org/examples/mps_prepop.html. Unfortunately that isn't possible with this library using any built-in\nfunctionality.

I'm sorry but I don't have time, sorry :(. It looks like you're not actually importing the PivotTable.js code. You'll need to do that right after the jQuery import, because it adds code to the $ object.. small note: please don't close/reopen/close/reopen issues like this... if you have another question, please create another issue :). I think you're right that multiple-choice data is going to be hard to use with this library, unfortunately.. That is really ugly output! It seems to be C3-specific, given that we do not override the C3 number formatting for scatter charts. A workaround for you until I can fix this would be to pass in some custom number formatting function to C3 via the rendererOptions similar to this example: https://pivottable.js.org/examples/scatter.html. OK, this is the third time you've posted the same question and I'm answering it in #746 so let's close this one.. The onRefresh callback is called after every render, including the first one. Does that answer your question, or am I misunderstanding?. I'm not sure what you mean by \"the html code of the data table is still loading\" ... can you provide some kind of example of what you're seeing?. This system is completely synchronous, so the PivotTable calls for a render, and when the render is done, it calls onRefresh.\n\n\nThe renderer is called here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/blob/master/src/pivot.coffee#L990\na few lines later, the onRefresh callback is called: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/blob/master/src/pivot.coffee#L1013\n\ntry passing in something like onRefresh: function(){ alert('done'); } in the parameters. The alert should appear immediately after the table appears.. Well that's certainly surprising. Could it be an actual DOM-rendering delay but the DOM has been constructed? I.e. if you query the DOM from the onRefresh callback is the table present but just the browser hasn't drawn all the pixels yet?\n. OK, so yeah, the fact that the table doesn't actually appear on the screen shouldn't prevent you from executing further code to modify it etc from within onRefresh. There's a lag to actually draw the pixels but there's not much we can do about browser performance.... Happy to help!\nRegarding the localization to spanish: if you specify a renderers object or an aggregators object, this overrides the locale file, so you'll need to provide your own keys in spanish for those objects.. Glad to know your issues are resolved!\nI'm always happy to hear about how people are able to use this library, so feel free to let me know, yes! In the meantime I'll close this issue. Please create new issues as you hit new problems/have new questions :). I'm not sure why those lines aren't working, but the issue doesn't seem related to PivotTable.js code... \nI should also note that you can just add styles to the existing classes, you don't need to add classes to elements necessarily.. Glad you like it!. To do this you will need to define a custom locale with the number formatter you want: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Localization. You'll probably have to import jQuery as $:\njavascript\nvar $ = require(\"jquery\");. I believe that for jQuery to work in node, you need a DOM package as well, see the bottom of https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery ... did you install this also?. OK. The error comes from $.extend() not being available... if you just require jquery and try to access that function, is it there? If not, that's the problem you need to solve, but I'm not sure how to do it.\nThe sample code you have above doesn't match what jQuery's NPM page says to do, which is:\n```javascript\nrequire(\"jsdom\").env(\"\", function(err, window) {\n    if (err) {\n        console.error(err);\n        return;\n    }\nvar $ = require(\"jquery\")(window);\n\n});\n``. It seems like the jQuery object that you'rerequireing isn't the same jQuery object that's available in the browser, as it's lacking.extend()and.fn` (which is the second error you're seeing) but I'm not sure why... PivotTable.js is primarily designed to work in a browser environment so I don't have a lot of experience with using jQuery in node like this unfortunately, and so I don't have a lot to suggest. A cursory Google suggests that many people are running into jQuery-on-Node issues, without any obvious solutions.. I suspect the issue is less with the input size (which is large-ish but not prohibitive) and more with the output size... based on the screenshot, you are trying to create multiple rows per transaction, and then date-based columns, which leads to a giant table with millions of cells. This is poorly supported by browsers in general.\n. There's no way to render only part of the output, no. You can use the new hiddenFromDragDrop parameter to prevent users from using extremely-high-cardinality attributes in the table though.. @VitaliyMF I have no problem with people mentioning alternatives :). Any dataset attributes not in rows or cols or hiddenAttributes is automatically placed in the unused area, you don't need to do anything special.. Aye, that is ugly/unfortunate. C3js is trying to put in half-tickmarks (i.e 1.5, 2, 2.5) but the integer-only number-formatter that the Count aggregator passes in doesn't show the half-tickmarks. There might be some option we can pass in to C3 for this case. I'll look into it. Thanks for pointing this out!. There is no way to do this at the moment, although there is an open pull request which I may merge that does this: #408 . I've just merged the changes from PR #408 so you can now use hiddenFromDragDrop to accomplish what you're looking for, or hiddenFromAggregators for the opposite.. Great. Please close this issue if you don't need any further help.\nOn Sun, Sep 24, 2017 at 07:57 hkbeer notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nYes this is great.

I can't think of a way to do this: this library displays output for all input, regardless of value.. You can use a custom sorting function with the sorters parameter.. You can provide a standard javascript comparison function... you can just wrap the builtin default like this: \n\njavascript\nfunction(a,b){ \n    return $.pivotUtilities.naturalSort( (\"\"+a).toLowerCase(), (\"\"+b).toLowerCase() ); \n}\n. \"\"+a is a hack to get a stringified version of a so I can call .toLowerCase() on it safely.\nIf you read the parameter documentation here you will see that sorters needs to be a function which returns a sorting function, so one way to use the example I gave you above is like this:\njavascript\n$(\"#whatever\").pivotUI(data, {\n    sorters: function(){ \n        return function(a,b){  \n            return $.pivotUtilities.naturalSort( (\"\"+a).toLowerCase(), (\"\"+b).toLowerCase() ); \n        }; \n    }\n});. Ah, right, my simple suggestion here will not work. You'll have to find or write your own sorter function here. I don't have time to help you with this specific thing, sorry. Here is some documentation on how to write such a function: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort. This example will show you the full input object for all keys for any configuration you like, so you can get a sense of what's what: https://pivottable.js.org/examples/onrefresh.html. You don't have to use both inclusions and exclusions. If you want to just have a whitelist of checked items, just use inclusions.. To exclude a value called value from an attribute called attribute use the follow configuration fragment: \njavascript\n...\n\"exclusions\": {\"attribute\": [\"value\"] } \n.... Excluding all is rarely a good idea... to do this you would use inclusions\nwith an empty array, meaning \"include nothing\".\nOn Sun, Sep 24, 2017 at 23:52 hkbeer notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nThanks.

Thanks\n```\nIf you want to continue requesting so much assistance with this library, I would ask that you please be a better Github Issues citizen and try to keep to \"one issue, one question\".\nThanks.. This is probably the wrong way to go. You can just use the builtin \"Sum over Sum\" aggregator in the UI for this, no need to write a deriver.. The issue is that in his case, if he takes the average of your derived column, he will not get what he wants. He wants (a+b)/(c+d) but what he will get is ((a/c)+(b/d))/2.. Yes, just choose something other than \"count\" in the second dropdown. For example \"sum\" and then choose NUM_TXNS in the second dropdown that appears. :).

You still need to code an application-specific thing yourself :). Yep! The reason this isn't automated is just because there are so many possible formats of inputs and outputs that people might need that I wasn't able to build a robust feature-set around it. If you don't mind pulling in another library you can also use Moment.js to build derived attributes which might have some fancier parsing/formatting options.. I don't understand what you're trying to do, can you try to clarify please?.

You can pass in whichever aggregators you like with the aggregators parameter.\n\nIn general, might I recommend that you familiarize yourself with the contents of this wiki page? https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Parameters ... many of the questions you are asking here are answered there.. The way this works is that there is a default value for aggregators which contains a bunch of stuff. It's available at $.pivotUtilities.aggregators. If you want a subset of those, then pass in the desired subset as the aggregators parameter, and it will use your subset instead of the defaults.\nThe other option is that you could create a locale file.. $.pivotUtilities.aggregators is an object where the keys are the default\naggregator names and the values are the corresponding aggregator functions.\nYou can inspect it just like any other object with something like\nconsole.log($.pivotutilities.aggregators) or you can read the source code\nin either original .coffee form or compiled .js form.\nOn Mon, Sep 25, 2017 at 19:17 hkbeer notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nThanks.

Thanks for the input, but I'm really not inclined to add keyboard shortcuts to this library at this time.. You can pass options through to Google Charts via rendererOptions but I'm not sure if they have an API for trendlines.... Cool, glad it turned out to be easy :). This type of jQuery-selector-specific question is best suited for StackOverflow or something like this, as it's not really PivotTable.js-specific.. There is no support for this in the library but you may be able to get it done with CSS or another Javascript library.. I can't replicate this problem...

I'm not sure what you're asking here. The sample code you have in the issue description should work fine except that you're missing a ] after Germany... { \"Country\": sortAs([\"US\",\"UK,\"Germany\"])} \n\nYou can store that array in a variable and pass it in trivially:\nvar x = [\"US\",\"UK,\"Germany\"];\n...{ \"Country\": sortAs(x)}.... That is annoying indeed! A simple fix is to set the CSS of table cells to not wrap text, something like .pvtVal {  white-space: nowrap; } .... happy to help!.

Thanks for this! Sorry for the delay in merging :). A couple of responses:\n\n\nYou're welcome to create a renderer that meets your needs and then we can discuss the idea of integrating it or a generalized version into the main library when I get a sense of what it might look like. I don't have any time to devote to building one myself, and I don't think I would want to modify the default TableRenderer at this time.\nDoes DataTables support multilevel row headers as well as column headers? If not, then special handling will be required for when the renderer encounters multiple row attributes. In the past I have found data-grid-type components to be a poor fit for a PivotTable.js renderer because they are very column-oriented whereas the pivot table is symmetric in its treatment of rows and columns.. Are you able to run the examples at https://pivottable.js.org/ on those\nbrowsers?

The click callback is passed a value arguement which seems like what you need, no?. Have you tried using the value variable in the callback?. I'm sorry but I don't understand what you're trying to do... Could you try explaining it differently please?. OK, I see the issue but I have no idea what is going on in the rest of your app etc so I don't know how to help you, because I can't reproduce this issue here outside of your context.. It seems like you're just using the wrong keys from the $.pivotUtilities.aggregators object, no? The definition of this object is here and the keys are case-sensitive: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/blob/master/src/pivot.coffee#L155. Yes because in the second case you're not summing anything. You have two options:\n\n\nTo sum attribute use: \"my aggregator\": function() { return tpl.sum(usFmt)(['attribute']) }\nTo display menu of attributes to sum use: \"my aggregator\": tpl.sum(usFmt)\n\nThere is detailed documentation here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Aggregators.

Yes, you can write a normal sorting function without using sortAs\nOn Fri, Oct 27, 2017 at 03:23 hkbeer notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nMy data layout is now as follows\nCountry, Product, Dates, Amount\nIt is fine Country and Product are sorted in ascending order first and\nthen I wish the Dates field to appear in descending order.

Great!. It would be really helpful if you could pull this together in JSFiddle or CodePen or something so I can see the issue for myself... :). Also, I assume this is Chrome on Windows that is giving you trouble? Can you tell me which version please?. The problem seems to be in your comparator: you parseaas \"DD/MM/YYYY\" but you parsebas \"YYYY\\MM\\DD\".. I should add that you should not useisBeforebut ratherdiff` to compare the two dates. If you want to reverse the order then just add a minus sign in front of the diff..

Well, not 100% your fault: I should find ways to make this documentation easier to find :). Are you loading C3 before the pivottable code?. C3 is a third-party charting library and so is required but not included in this repo. See http://c3js.org for more details.\nIt can be loaded from CDNJS as c3.min.js, yes, but it must be loaded after the pivot.min.js and c3_renderers.min.js files.\nPivotTable.js is a client-side system so is agnostic to server-side technologies: it can be used with JSP, Spring, whatever.. Thanks for the bug report! This should be fixed in version 2.16.1, which I just published :). There's definitely no built-in feature for this, so your best bet is to render it to an invisible element (i.e. one with display: none;), extract its HTML somehow and then remove it from the DOM.. This is not something I'm working on, but you're welcome to fork and modify the Table Renderer to suit your needs :). https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/blob/master/src/pivot.coffee#L444\nI'm not going to lie, though, this seems like a very complex/challenging change to make, and not something which I would incorporate into the main library if you succeed.... What do you mean by \"it doesn't work\"? After executing that code, does $(\"#MyTable\") not return the element?. This was changed in PivotTable.js version 2.14.0 but rpivotTable still uses version 2.11.0 so unfortunately there's not much more I can do and you'll have to file an issue in that repo :). @Bill-VA it's actually best if you don't \"piggyback\" on other issues but rather create new ones please, as right now the issue creator will get notifications for our conversation, which they may not care about :)\nAs noted above, though, the latest version of PivotTable.js displays zeros as zeros except in the corner-case of the count operator, which never displays 0. It's a bit awkward but that's how it is.\nNumber-formatting is in your control via the localization mechanism: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Localization\nRe JS-Fiddle I agree it would be nicer but I don't have the time to maintain a bunch of external resources like this, it's much easier to search and replace a set of example files in my repo when I need to change them :) .

There is no mechanism specifically to constrain the number of attributes in the drop area, no, but I'm considering adding a confirm warning if someone tries to render a table with more than a million cells or something like that, for this reason. Would that help?. You can modify pivot.js to make it do pretty much anything you like, but I don't have any time to help you implement this particular change, unfortunately, I'm sorry.... Thanks for the PR, it'll be released shortly!. Thanks for this PR! It'll be in the next release :). This would not be particularly easy unfortunately... Plotly does support the rendering of error-bars, but the architecture of the pivot table means that when using the built-in 'mean' aggregator, by the time the data gets to the rendering layer (i.e. Plotly), only the averages remain, not any side-information about the distribution.\n\nIn order to do this, or anything like it, one would need to (1) create a custom aggregator which returned multiple values (which is not something aggregators are really designed to do, but OK, there are potential hacks available) and then (2) have a custom Plotly-based renderer which unpacked those values and rendered error bars. Unfortunately, this renderer wouldn't work well with other aggregators and this aggregator wouldn't work well with other renderers, so it would kind of be a specific set of coupled hacks for this one use-case.. Glad you like it!\nA couple of things:\n1) If this is related to the Python module, please file issues in the corresponding repo, which is https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/jupyter_pivottablejs\n2) If I understand correctly you're trying to make a plot wider? There is no generic \"width\" parameter here but for charts you can pass some options to the underlying C3 renderer with something like rendererOptions = {\"c3\": {\"size\": {\"width\": <pixels>}}} . Super!. I'm going to need some more context to help you out... Can you post a link to your page or a copy of your code or something please?. It's an interesting approach for sure, nice work!\nMy main feedback is around the lack of generality: this supports hardcoded multi_X(a, b) where X is Sum or Average etc, so it doesn't allow for Sum(a) and Average(b) and newAggregator(c) side by side, say. My feeling is that this second use-case is more common, and that users will find this limitation difficult to deal with.\nOn a second note, it's not clear how to support multiple aggregators within the chart renderers, which breaks the symmetry of the library a bit.\nIf we're able to resolve these issues I would happily consider integration into the main library but over the past couple of years of thinking about it I haven't found a solution for these issues that I'm happy with yet.. I'm not currently working on this, and the UX for properly supporting it seems to me to be very complex so I am not expecting this to be supported in the medium term either.. Check out the onRefresh parameter here https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Parameters#pivotuiinput-options-overwrite-locale. You can set the height/width of the chart using rendererOptions as in this example https://pivottable.js.org/examples/scatter.html but there is no built-in way to make things responsive. You can probably force a rerender of the size you like on resize, though.. Yes, you can use the inclusions and exclusions parameters.. Thanks for the bug report! I'm not sure when this stopped working but I'll try to get it fixed soon!. Oh, I didn't dig into that older issue as much as I should have :(\nThis is actually really easy to fix, I don't even need a polyfill, I'll just remove the calls to startsWith.. Let's leave this open until I've released a fix, though, please :). Fix released in version 2.19.0 :). This is not a feature of this library, but can likely be implemented with https://github.com/sheetjs. So I can understand, you want to make the column/row headers clickable? Or to do something like this example https://pivottable.js.org/examples/mps_prepop.html ?. In the example above, the filters argument contains the column headers.. I don't think this is a feature I would like to add to the main library, but you can copy and modify the TableRenderer to do this without too much effort I would guess.. The problem here is that your Jornadas input is not supported: each value must be a string or number or boolean, not an object or an array.. Good! I'm happy to have been able to help!\nOn Tue, Jan 9, 2018 at 14:04 Deyzab notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nClosed #855 https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/issues/855.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/issues/855#event-1416290384,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAMbAwX7fCJGd1jBNOSfA5DkXzAU-hW2ks5tI7gqgaJpZM4RX_dm\n.\n.

Try it and let me know! I have no idea what it will take to get this to work :). In general, pivot() and pivotUI() do not accept the same parameters so there is some adjustment to do: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Parameters. In general, pivot() and pivotUI() do not accept the same parameters so there is some adjustment to do: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Parameters\n\n. The core library doesn't depend on D3 but the C3 renderers do. C3 itself isn't D3v4 compatible though: https://github.com/c3js/c3/issues/1648. All C3-related configuration happens via the rendererOptions object which is passed through and merged into the C3 configuration, like this example with width/height: https://pivottable.js.org/examples/scatter.html \n. You'll need to load jQuery before the other scripts for things to register correctly.. Are you seeing the same error on a page like this one? https://pivottable.js.org/examples/simple_ui.html\nWhich operating system and browser are you using?. OK, so I recommend that you try copy-pasting code from that working example into your setup line by line until you find what's different.. There is nothing built-in for cumulative sums, but others have built custom aggregators for it, see #140 . There's no built-in function for this at the moment, unfortunately, so you'll have to wrap the TableRenderer (like the heatmap renderer does) or post-process it with jQuery.. @benharrell because the contents of the cells is the output of an aggregator.... Strange. Can you provide me with some details about your browser and operating system so that I might be able to replicate the problem locally?. Hello Karel,\nWell done in creating this renderer! A few notes:\n\nThis library is written in CoffeeScript, from which pivot.js is generated, so there is no way for me to upstream your changes to pivot.js: they would need to be translated to CoffeeScript and added to pivot.coffee\nThis is a neat renderer but I don't think it's of general enough interest to merge into the library at this time. In fact something rather similar can likely be accomplished by passing a custom color-scale to the existing heatmap renderer as in this example: https://pivottable.js.org/examples/montreal_2014.html\nIf you wish, you can likely easily move your new code to a separate file and include that file alongside the unmodified PivotTable.js library and use the two together. c3_renderers.js or export_renderers.js might be a good place for you to start looking at how that might be done :). Can you provide a bit more detail about what you mean by \"add a new column name or update an existing one\"? I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to do.... Sorry for the long delay here... What do you mean \"the table is not updating\" ? I'm having trouble picturing 1) what is happening and 2) what you're hoping will happen.... I'm sorry, I don't understand the question I can help answer here.... Hi, sorry it's taken so long to respond! I have no problem with you or anyone building such an extension :). Thanks you for this PR! Unfortunately I cannot accept JS-only contributions, as per the contribution guide.... Unfortunately there's nothing built-in for that, no.. There seems to be a bug in your function: you refer to a.include instead of a.includes (note the missing 's'!). Duplicate of #708 ... I don't have a fix for this yet.. Yes, if you override the renderers you get the ones you're overriding with, rather than the ones from the locale file. The fr locale file is indeed missing some renderers, as are most locale files. My general recommendation is that you tweak the locale file to your liking :). I was not planning on adding pie chart support (or accepting a PR for it) in the near future, as using multiple pie charts is generally not a very effective visualization technique, and plotly.js' support for multiple pie charts is not quite at the level I would like it to be in terms of labels etc. Of course, that doesn't stop anyone from creating and using such a renderer in their own applications! :). Thanks @ebellumat !\n\nI would ask that if this does not end up being merged into the main library, that you not fork this library in total, but rather create a new 'plugin' library with just this renderer, much like https://github.com/nagarajanchinnasamy/subtotal :). Pie charts are now built in :)\n. Thanks very much, this will be in the next release!. Can you post the code that you're using? The example you linked to does work so the problem must be in the delta between it and your code :). OK, and what is it that this is meant to do?. OK... Unfortunately I'm not able to see what's wrong here, you'll have to build a smaller version of the code that clearly reproduces the problem if you want me to help you debug it :). You can group dates by year and/or month with the dateFormat deriver (e.g. https://pivottable.js.org/examples/montreal_2014.html) and you can get expand/collapse behaviour using the Subtotal.js plugin: https://github.com/nagarajanchinnasamy/subtotal. This should all be possible in principle, but the only way to know is to try!\n. That's because your onRefresh function isn't bound to this, so this.createQuery isn't defined.. You'll need to create your callback function with a name, then bind it to the this object, then pass it in as the onRefresh parameter. Here's a bit of documentation about binding: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind. Basically you'll have to do onRefresh: this.refreshData.bind(this). Thanks for this PR! I don't think this is of general enough interest that I would want to merge it into the main library, but it can probably serve as a guide for the occasional person who wants to do it :). Your PR did give me a good idea though: I could add a flag to pivotUI() called hideUI or something which when false would call .hide() on these elements. Then your button could live outside the UI and just refresh it. It would allow everyone to use pivotUI() almost like pivot()\nSo... thanks! :). I assume you're using https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/jupyter_pivottablejs here? If so, in future, please submit questions there rather than here so I can keep things straight :)\nTo answer your question, unfortunately there is no way to arbitrarily change the locale information (which controls number formatting) through the Python layer.. No worries. Glad you have a workaround, and sorry it's not more flexible!. Yes, pivot() and pivotUI() do slightly different things and have slightly different input parameters: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Parameters. I'm not that interested in changing the existing behaviour of pivot(), no...\nI've looked at creating a new function, something like pivotNoUI() or adding a hideUI parameter to pivotUI() but neither seemed particularly easy to do. I'd happily accept a PR for it though!. @jneilliii the issue is that pivotUI stores its state in the DOM, so we can't just not render those elements.\nThe latest release (v2.21.0) papers over this by adding showUI parameter that can be set to false to hide the UI. It literally hides the UI: the DOM elements are created but then made invisible via CSS ;). The documentation has been updated in various place, so I'm closing this issue.. Posting screenshots of code makes it almost impossible to help you. Can you post a minimal repo or something so that someone can try to execute the code you're wanting help with?. If your needs are met yes we can close this issue. Note that there is a long discussion of Angular integration here: #208 . Unfortunately this is not possible at the moment.\nOn Sun, Mar 18, 2018 at 06:38 giko45 notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHi,\nHow can i add rows/column headers/labels for which there is no values in\nde dataset?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/issues/885, or mute the\nthread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAMbAy8ZNm-33dZMlAdVwMi6Rjvz6Cc9ks5tfjk_gaJpZM4SvJWt\n.\n. A locale defines a set of default, overrideable aggregators, renderers and various strings, so when you declare a locale and don't specify your own renderers/aggregators, you get the ones from the locale. On the other hand, if you override the locale's renderers/aggregators, you get whatever you overrode with. This is in fact documented, but I welcome and suggestions about how to make it clearer:\nThe net effect of this is that the default aggregators, renderers and locale-strings are in the en locale, although they remain overridable.\n\nand\n\nThe older, more flexible, more involved way to localize is to pass in your own values to the renderers, aggregators and localeStrings parameters on every call to pivotUI().\n\nThe ru locale that was contributed to this library by someone else only contains the default table renderers, not the C3 ones, so you'll have to either pass in your own renderers object with the names you want to use OR extend the ru locale to include them. I'll happily accept a PR with the new ru locale if you want to share. I can't do it myself as I don't speak anything other than en, fr and CoffeeScript ;) I can basically only republish the locales that other people submit.. There is no built-in feature for this, but others have found various ways of doing it: see #58, #851, #187 .... This example shows how to control the colour scale in a heatmap https://pivottable.js.org/examples/montreal_2014.html and yes, you can style the cells however you like with td.pvtVal and any applicable CSS including width, height, font-size etc.... If this question is with respect to rpivotTable, it should probably go in the relevant repo which is here: https://github.com/smartinsightsfromdata/rpivotTable\nTo answer your question: you can't get any data out of the rpivotTable component, it's just a display component :). No, because I haven't had the time or energy to write a Javascript-back-to-R bridge :) \nPlease pursue this discussion here https://github.com/smartinsightsfromdata/rpivotTable if you're still interested.. You'll have to see if there are any C3 options you can pass in via rendererOpts similar to the way this example does: https://pivottable.js.org/examples/scatter.html. I've updated the documentation for C3 rendererOptions which should make it a bit clearer:  https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Optional-Extra-Renderers#c3-rendereroptions.

Try adding: rendererOptions: { gchart: {width: 800, height: 600} } to the parameters.. If you add the options I recommended to this example, it works just fine https://pivottable.js.org/examples/gchart.html ... I'm not sure what else to recommend. . I notice that the rendererName you're using is Line which isn't a built-in renderer... could that be your issue?. I've modified the example to prove this works... https://pivottable.js.org/examples/gchart.html now contains this directive and the charts are correctly loaded as 800x600 for me on Chrome/macOS.\n\n\nDo you not see the same thing?\nIf not, what environment are you using?. @LittleHamster please don't hijack others' issues with related questions, as it makes it difficult for me to answer the original question :)\n\n@gmisterk I'm sorry, I don't have the time to copy-paste this fragment into a working setup. Can you please use JSFiddle or CodePen to provide an example that doesn't work that I can execute in my browser right away?. This example doesn't really show any gcharts at all: it doesn't even load the renderers. Are you able to provide a working example of the problem that follows the documentation here https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Optional-Extra-Renderers#google-charts-demo ?. I don't mind trying to help you out here but this second Fiddle you've sent me has nothing to do with PivotTable.js ... . @t1eap is right that the menuLimit parameter controls the number of items in the filter box, but note that 2280 items may lead to slow/unusable behaviour.\nRegarding division from MB to GB, you will likely have to create your own Renderer with number formatting that handles scaling: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Renderers. What's happening here is that the first row of your CSV is being used as headers, so the system is interpreting \"0009-Prod-Xen6_Bronze\" as the name of the attribute and is placing it in the header of the table.. This means that you haven't loaded the C3js files... documentation here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Optional-Extra-Renderers#c3-charts-demo. You'll have to provide me with an example I can run myself like a CodePen or something or a link to your system because I can't really see how this could be happening :). Unfortunately it's not possible to format or aggregate certain rows/columns/cells differently from others. . In principle this library should be compatible with VueJS, but there are no specific features or bindings for it at the moment. . @ebellumat out of curiosity, what level of compatibility with PivotTable.js / react-pivottable are you aiming for with your Vue port? Right now the jQuery and React versions can share aggregators and sorters basically, which is nice, but not much else. Are you aiming for this as well or... ?. Thanks for the compliment, I\u2019m glad you like it!. I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to do here... There are no guarantees as to the order in which the records are passed to aggregators, which is why it will look like name gets assigned randomly. If you want to \"aggregate by\" pat.name then you will likely want to create a deriver that extracts the name, and then use the name as a row or column header.. I'm still not clear on what you're trying to do... For the data above, what output would you want to see in the table, for what values of rows and cols?. OK, but I'm not clear on the visual output you're looking for, which is what I'd need to understand in order to advise you on how to implement it.. OK, so in that case you'll not need a custom aggregator, you'll need a deriver which just extracts the prefix from the name. Or you could have the upstream data source do this. You can then place the prefix attribute in the rows or columns area and use the Count aggregator.. Great, I'm glad it worked out!. Thanks for this PR, sorry to have not responded earlier... Can I ask what the motivation here is? You want filters on shorter lists than 5? Or you want to hide filters on longer lists? What number are you using?. Yes I understand what you're trying to do, I'm not sure why though... Why would you need filtering on lists that are shorter than 5? Why would you want to disable filtering on more items than 5? Without understanding some clear use-cases, I will not be inclined to merge this PR.... Sure but you have to remember that every single configuration option has to be documented (by me) in the wiki and I have to answer questions about it in the future and keep track of it in upgrades etc. It's not zero-cost to expose internal details :) . I've never seriously considered TypeScript, no. The successor to this library is https://react-pivottable.js.org/ which was already ported to ES6, and I'm not sure I want to go back to having a compilation toolchain :). I'm sorry, but this isn't enough information for me to help :) Can you provide a bit more context or a link to an example of the problem?. The issue is that your first row has 2018-02-29 which is not a valid date as 2018 isn't a leap year, so it's being interpreted as if it was March 1 :)\njavascript\nnew Date(\"2018-02-28\").getUTCMonth(); // 1 = feb\nnew Date(\"2018-02-29\").getUTCMonth(); // 2 = mar. I just saw that the docs were wrong and just fixed them: these are the fourth and fifth parameters, not third and fourth parameters. \nIn terms of an example, here's a simple one:\njavascript\nvar df = $.pivotUtilities.derivers.dateFormat(\"x\", \"%n\", true, [\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\",\"e\",\"f\",\"g\",\"h\",\"i\",\"j\",\"k\",\"l\"]);\ndf({x: \"2010-01-01\"}); // returns \"a\" because that's the 'localized' version of January\nIf you use a sorter you'll have to use the localized names, as sorting operates after deriving.. It's definitely possible. Renderers are just specified in the renderers object, so you can add whatever mix you want in there, so long as they have their own unique names.. Unfortunately this isn't something I can help you with, it's more of a Github issue than a PivotTable issue :) \nhere's the Github documentation for cloning: https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/.

What you're describing here isn't really a pivot table, or at least it's not possible to generate this output given the data you have. Your data would need to be of a structure like:\n\n[\n{year: 2016, rows: 'project cost', value: 1234},\n{year: 2016, rows: 'sponsorship', value: 7890},\netc\n]. Sorry I didn't get back to you on this, I was on vacation. There's no real support for structured values like arrays or objects unfortunately: attribute values are treated as scalars so you'll need to convert them to strings.. Probably the best starting point I could give you would be this one which attaches a click callback to every cell which allows you to grab the original records from the underlying data based on the cell parameters: https://pivottable.js.org/examples/mps_prepop.html. Yes, it's a limitation of the current system that everything is treated as a string. Would be nice to someday get a chance to tackle #191 . What parameters have you tried? It seems to me that rows=[name, product], columns=[measure type], vals=[measure value], aggregator=sum would work?. Ah, this library is designed as a rendering library, not an array-to-array transformation system.. Unfortunately this is not possible at the moment or likely to be supported in the near future as this library is not aware of attribute types in the input. One way forward would be #191 but I don't have the time to implement this :). @LittleHamster you're creating and closing a lot of issues here, which is generating a lot of email for me... could I ask that you try to reduce this just a bit please? Perhaps do a bit more research before opening an issue?. Unfortunately there's not much I can say about what Google Charts' editor does to the chart, you'll have to look for help from them... Once PivotTable.js hands over control to their code it's out of my hands :). I don't know why it's happening, no... Also, just to set expectations: I probably will not be looking into this too too much, as I moved from primarily supporting Google Charts to favouring C3js and now as a Plotly employee that's where I'm putting most of my energy.. 1. You'll have to create a custom aggregator with the number formatting you want\n2. You'll have to use the sorters functionality, demo here: https://pivottable.js.org/examples/montreal_2014.html\n3. You'll have to switch to using the Plotly renderers: https://pivottable.js.org/examples/plotly.html. There is nothing built-in, no. Some of the reasoning for this is explained here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/pull/77\nBasically there are too many ways to define \"week number\" to support in a library like this. You can create a deriver based on Moment.js or something if you need a specific definition of \"week number\" :). I'm sorry, I can't follow what you're describing with these screenshots... can you provide a CodePen or JSFiddle that shows the problem?. OK!. Glad you like it! This is something you'll have to do by overriding the CSS.. I'm not sure I follow... can you give me an example of what you tried and why it didn't work?. What browser are you using? In Chrome on the examples site (e.g. https://pivottable.js.org/examples/rcsvs.html) for me right now on the examples the attributes in the left area are always all at the top...\n\n. \ud83d\udc4d . I assume this is using the C3 renderers?. This isn't possible out of the box, no, although the NReco PivotTable plugin adds this functionality.. This example shows how click callbacks work: https://pivottable.js.org/examples/mps_prepop.html. Did you figure out how to do this or...?. I generally answer issues in batches every 10 days or so if they're not urgent... What you're describing is fairly out of scope for this library so you'll have to patch it, sorry :). You could create your own locale file with the specific translations you like :). That's... interesting :) Can you provide a URL to a running example of this so I can poke at it a bit?. There is no way to do this with the built-in renderers for security reasons, so writing your own renderer is the only option :)\nSee #401 . Something like #748 ?. The PR is open but I haven't decided to merge it yet. I'm not sure how much I want to support/document/answer questions about such a feature :). Can you please provide more details?. Unfortunately this is not straightforward, as in many cases the label spans multiple rows.. Yes, this is by design, as most spreadsheet importers seem to handle US formats like this. Is this not the case with you?. Thanks! Closing as a duplicate of #708. A couple of comments:\n\nWhat is a \"block of values\" ? :)\nAs per the contributing guide, I generally recommend creating an issue to discuss a feature before submitting a PR, and I only accept PRs that target the CoffeeScript source files, not the Javascript compiled files.. I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t understand your proposal... can you clarify please?\n\nOn Sat, May 26, 2018 at 04:17 adun01 notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHello!\nI want to add the ability to position the \"filter block\" inside the table\nor add the ability to calculate the position yourself.\n[image: 1]\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12925484/40574103-709da7de-60d5-11e8-89db-50a45d698ec4.jpg\nThe screenshot shows how the \"filter block\" is outside the table\nWhat do you think of it?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/issues/941, or mute the\nthread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAMbA7llu2uNLLfJTOhdbXlnbAVdvPgEks5t2Q99gaJpZM4UO1Ha\n.\n.

Those both sound like issues that can be addressed via CSS to me :). There is no built-in support for loading icons, and I don't have time to build your CSS for you, sorry :). If you're asking about multiple aggregators then the answer is no unfortunately. Yes, you cannot serialize functions, so you'll need to re-add the onRefresh function to the saved config before passing it back in.. Pull requests are welcome :)\n\nYou can also create a locale file that formats numbers using another mechanism than the built-in numberFormat function, such as http://numeraljs.com/. There's no built-in support for that at the moment.. This library supports versions of jQuery from 1.8.3 on upwards, so you're welcome to use whatever version you're comfortable with. If you find cases where this library is incompatible with a more recent/secure version of jQuery, please file a specific issue for that case :). They're the same... for whatever reason I had called it inclusionsInfo originally and then changed it to inclusions but left the old one in for backwards compatibility: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/blob/master/src/pivot.coffee#L1004. As per the FAQ, this is not supported. https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#multi\nPlease note that it is neither necessary nor appreciated to send me direct email in addition to creating Github Issues :). I understand, but as I've mentioned, this is not a supported feature of this library, and likely will not ever be.. I'm not clear on what you're trying to do here, can you clarify? In general this component builds itself out of a <table> element and so it will not be possible to \"split\" the pieces in any meaningful way.. Ah I see. This is pushing this library pretty far compared to its intended usage so I'm afraid I can't really help you much.... You'll need to give me a reproducible example... it's not at all clear what the error is or in what circumstances it appears.. Can you provide a stack trace from your console?. This isn't really what this library is meant for, but you could take all the attributes and put them in the cols area and get something like that.. Sorry, I meant rows area:\n\n. One thing to note is that this library is not type-aware: it treats everything as strings. So if you're including 2017-6 it's normal that 2017-06 shows up in exclusions :). No need to apologize, it\u2019s an understandable thing to do and an easy one to miss!. You'll have to provide the actual calling code for me to help you debug.. If I understand your question correctly, yes.. No, that would be the way to do it. I'm not supporting HTML rendering in cells any more, so if you need it, you'll need to fork the table renderer.. It's quite unlikely at this point that I'll split anything out of pivot.coffee or break up this module into multiple modules, just in terms of backwards compatibility... That said, if you're not calling pivot() or pivotUI() then you don't need to provide anything browser-related, just jQuery. You can use the PivotData class on its own if you like :)\n. You'll need to load the export renderers separately: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Optional-Extra-Renderers#exporting-to-tsv-demo. If the aggregator used was sum then yes, you could get the data for that line from the column totals. I don't think this is a common-enough use-case that I'd want to make it a supported option of the charting renderers that ship with this library, so i would recommend forking the Plotly renderer if this is a requirement for you.. It might be easier to post a link to the complete file so I can read it in-context :). Sorry I haven't gotten back to you yet, it's been a hectic month... Your solution seems reasonable to me. Are you encountering any issues with it?. I'm assuming this issue refers to https://github.com/smartinsightsfromdata/rpivotTable rather than this repo, which contains the underlying Javascript library.\nI'm not aware of any way of getting Rstudio to do this, no... . No processing is done on the column headers at all in this library: if you need them localized you'll have to localize them yourself before input.\nAlso: please note that the fact that noting that something is \"urgent\" for you comes across as quite demanding... I've created this library in my spare time and am donating my time to answer your questions so please don't pass your stress along to me.. Ah yes, I see the problem if you want to use numbers as both cell headers and computations. I'm afraid I don't have a good answer for this, as number formatting is a property of aggregators, which are not used in generating the table headers. You may need to post-process the table using jQuery.. Great!. The dropdown list is controlled via the aggregators object, which is overrideable and localizable (https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Localization).  The aggregatorName parameter is a key in the aggregators object. So you should just build a new aggregators object that suits your needs and pass that in :). first/last are computed using the sorters parameter, so they are done on a string basis using naturalSort by default. min/max are done by casting to numbers first.\nI'm sorry the documentation is not up to your expectations but the code for this entire library is less than 1k lines and is actually quite readable in this case: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/blob/master/src/pivot.coffee#L67. At first glance it looks like hello is a string, if it's the output of JSON.stringify, and that's not an accepted input format.\n. I'm not sure what you're asking here... what's a \"default renderer option\" in this context?. I'm sorry but what you're asking isn't clear to me here... could you provide some more context and a bit of code please? Maybe some sample data?. I'm afraid I don't follow here... What do you mean by \"take\"? The code above will display a table... are you wanting to display a different table? What output are you looking for?. Which aggregator are you using? If you're using \"count unique\" this would make sense.. Or \"max\", say. The totals is not the sum if you're using count-unique, it's the unique count across the rows or columns.. If you need different behaviour, you can write a custom aggregator: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Aggregators. What are you using as a local web server?. The output of JSON.stringify is a string, which is not the correct input format: you need to pass in the actual object or array. Basically just skip the stringify :). This is a limitation in C3 charts... I recommend using the Plotly renderers instead :). In what context/to avoid what problem?. Do you have a minimal example I can see anywhere? https://pivottable.js.org/examples/mps.html doesn't have this problem... are you using a different version of jquery or something?. It's definitely possible, just render them into two different divs. If you're having issues, please provide a replicable test case using something like CodePen and I'll take a look :). It seems like you might not be formatting the input the way the component is expecting it... Here are the supported input types (which you should note don't support nested inputs :) https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Input-Formats. Thanks!. Actually @dmclark you're working well within the design philosophy, which is essentially to provide a flexible framework with a bunch of built-ins, and the ability to more-or-less-easily write your own aggregators or renderers to accomplish whatever the built-ins cannot.\nTo answer the original question, then: if the built-in functionality of \"one aggregator that applies the same way to both total and non-total cells\" doesn't meet your needs, you will have to implement either your own aggregator that treats totals differently, or your own renderer that processes data differently and displays it the way you like. It's likely not for the faint of heart and those who don't want to read the original source of the built-ins but it's not an insurmountable hurdle either :). Thanks for the feedback! I've considered this but have always decided against it in the interest of keeping things clean... I've even regretted the sorting arrows I had to put in recently as they don't render reliably the same way on all browsers.\nI could be convinced otherwise if you were able to suggest a layout where such a button would be unobtrusive and unambiguous about its functionality, though :)\nI must say that the extra few drag/drop operations to accomplish this in the absence of a button have never felt totally outrageous, so it doesn't feel like a major shortcoming to not have it.. I'm confused about what kind of chart you need... can you post a screenshot? \nAlso, I'm not sure what you mean when you say \"cases where you like to look at data with dates on the index and labels on the column, but when plotting in a plotly line chart the dates need to be on the index to render correctly\" ... this sounds like a bug that could/should be fixed, either here or in plotly.js :). Ok! I believe that dates will render fine on either axis in a Plotly chart actually. If that\u2019s not the case please do let me know!. I see what you mean, thanks for clarifying!\nI would say that I'm not sure I agree with you that it's much more common to look at tables of dates in this orientation... Certainly I don't and most of my financially-oriented colleagues don't, but I see the reasoning for it.\nTo me, this doesn't seem like a sufficiently strong reason to add a transposition button, or a new rendererer which would break the pattern of \"y as rows, x as columns\" which provides a nice intuitive mapping for charts. This 'row-wise' chart would be deeply counterintuitive to use except in the specific case of switching to it from such a table. \nThat said, if you want to use such a renderer in your application, it should be quite easy for you to do: just fork and modify the Plotly renderers :). Thanks! Just curious... do you speak all three of these languages? :). Thanks!. It sort of sounds like you should be using the showUI parameter of pivotUI(), no?. This comes up every once in a while but I\u2019m not really interested in taking\nthis library in this direction... PivotTable.js is, always has been and\nalways will be a client-side library only :)\nOn Mon, Aug 13, 2018 at 06:06 Erasmo Bellumat notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nIn some cases, the number of rows uses all memory available on Chrome,\nmaking him freezes, especially when the dataset have more than 100.000\nrows.

OK, so I don't think I'll want to incorporate this into this library. I'm pretty conservative about breaking changes at this point :). There's no built-in way to do this unfortunately. If you need to do this, you may have to fork/extend the TSV Export Renderer or add a button to your app outside the pivot table that does this by targeting the textarea via CSS selectors.. You'll need to do a bit more research as to the definition of this in Javascript... Inside the click callback function, this doesn't refer to your class, it refers to the function itself.. This is how it's supported within plotly.js: https://plot.ly/javascript/responsive-fluid-layout/. At the moment, the plotly renderers are not responsive, even though plotly.js has recently started supporting some new options for this kind of thing. At some point I'll have to try to see if they can be supported here as well.\n. This is very neat, thank you! Unfortunately I'm just headed out on vacation so I will likely not have time to review it for another 10 days or so but I should be able to merge it thereafter.\n\nMy main comment right now is that we need some way of identifying the donuts, some kind of title or something.

First of all, thanks again for the impetus here to finally get a multi-pie implementation done. That said, here are a few notes here on why I think I'll make a slightly different implementation than the one in this PR:\n\n\nI will use the scalegroup feature of plotly.js pie charts such that pies are scaled with respect to each other, so that they are a clear analogy to stacked bar charts\nAs a result I will not want to use the hole parameter to turn them into donuts, as in that case they areas are no longer adequately comparable\nSimilarly to the way the other plotly_renderer renderers work, I'll disable the text on the actual pie slices: the text isn't displayed on bars in bar charts right now so it shouldn't be displayed on pie charts either.\nI would like some slightly smarter handling of large numbers of pies: 10 pies should render in rows of 4/4/2, for example, and 20 pies should be 5/5/5/5 and so on. I'm not sure what the exact algorithm should be but I'll play with it a bit.\nThis is a minor thing, but important to me: the CoffeeScript style in this PR is quite different from the style in the rest of the file, which would likely cause maintenance problems later.\n. Thanks for your input @Blake-Eryx ! Unfortunately I don't think I'll be able to do this in the built-in renderers in the short run, partly for the datavis related reasons laid out above, and also because laying out donut chart titles in the middle of the donut is not a built-in feature of plotly.js. In general this would be a tough problem to solve because the 'hole' in a donut chart is often quite small compared the amount of text a label can contain, and automatically wrapping text in SVG charts is a bit challenge.. I stand corrected! Somehow I missed that even though I did check out that\nPR.\n\nI\u2019m still on the fence about donuts for inclusion in the core pivot table.\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019d include both pies and donuts, and I prefer pies to\ndonuts.

Thanks again for the prompting with this PR! I've got #1041 in development and it will do everything this PR does except for the hole to make pies into donuts.. I have this list already and I'm happy to keep adding to it: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Used-By. Are you loading this file straight from disk or via a local server? i.e. does the URL bar start with http or file?\n\nAlso, using the same Chrome browser that's causing you issues, does this example load correctly? https://pivottable.js.org/examples/gchart.html. This isn't going to be feasible without writing a fair bit of custom Javascript to hack the TableRenderer.... The TableRenderer only renders output rows/columns for attribute values contained in the data... If you have no data for February, there's no way to generate a row or column for it.. Different browsers have different sort behaviours, and in this case you're sorting on the total, and the rows you've highlighted have the same total, so both of these sorts are valid, even though I take your point that one looks better than the other.... Grouping of cells is working properly in this case, because grouping is of adjacent cells with the same key. In this case the browser's sorting algorithm happens to not be placing certain cells adjacent to one another. To really solve this, you would need to include all the cell labels in the sorting algorithm as a \"tie breaker\" for when the actual value is the same, but this isn't something I can picture pushing into the core of the library unfortunately.. There's no easy way to do this, and I should add that if there were, the output would actually likely be bigger/slower to parse than your initial 40MB CSV, because it would contain all of that data in a rather uncompressed/verbose format, plus a bunch of other data besides.... There's no built-in functionality for this, but you may be able to create a custom renderer that combines two existing ones: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Renderers.

That seems... very strange. If you look at this example https://pivottable.js.org/examples/simple_ui_from_table.html you'll see that although the pivot table has rendered, the input table is still there and you can still access it from the console etc.... Is #tbl_time contained within #out originally by any chance? pivotUI() will completely overwrite the contents of the element it's called on.... OK, that's your problem right there. You'd be better off putting your data table in a hidden div, or just using an array or object or something if you don't ever need to render it.. Unfortunately I don't think this will be possible, as the pivot table assumes it has full control over what goes into the chart data....

You can use the sorters parameter to provide your own comparator to override the default sorting, which is alphabetical.. Check out the \u201cunusedAttrsVertical\u201d parameter.. There's no functionality for this at the moment, but there are many other plugins and CSS tricks you can use to achieve this effect.. If you can provide me with sample code that replicates this I'd gladly take a look at it but I suspect you're misunderstanding the functioning of the aggregators in this library. If you're using \"average\" then the total row will display the average of all the records in each column, not all the cells in each column. Quite often these differ quite a bit.\n\nBy way of example, if you have a year's worth of daily data arranged in monthly rows aggregated by average, then each cell will show the daily average for the given month, and the total will be the daily average for the year, which might be different from the average of monthly averages.. Right, I would need to have access to some sample data that shows the behaviour as well :) Can you put together a CodePen or JSFiddle or something please?\nBefore you do that though, does my explanation of the intended behaviour make sense? It's not expected that the \"total\" average shows the average of the displayed cells.. Here's a JSFiddle of PivotTable.js operating on the data above, and giving the same output as Excel: \nhttps://jsfiddle.net/nicolaskruchten/3u5qga8j/\nIf you're seeing different output, I suspect you've got different data being fed to your pivot table, with a ninth row of data in there somewhere :). Glad you sorted out the problem :). This functionality was removed, as it caused serious potential security problems. Sorry! See #401 for the full conversation.. In fact, I actually bumped the version number from 1.x to 2.x because this was a breaking change: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/releases/tag/v2.0.0. Thanks!. You need to put the rendererOptions inside a plotly key: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Optional-Extra-Renderers#plotly-rendereroptions. Thanks!. From what I can tell, null should in fact be rendered in white, or rather, uncolored.\nHere's an example of a 'stoplight' style color function which uses scale.threshold instead of scale.linear and renders null uncolored: https://jsfiddle.net/nicolaskruchten/46fma2g3/.

Thanks! Fixed in  4aa381, will be in the next release :). Hi, happy Thanksgiving to you too!\n\nTo answer your question, there is no way to force any data to be shown which is not in the table/underlying data. This means that if you want to have a Q1 point appear, you'll need some Q1 data in the original data and for that to appear as a zero in the table as well.. Followup: often this will mean having 'dummy data' for the various labels you want to force to appear, like Q1, and then instead of using \"count\" as an aggregator (which would result in 1 for the dummy data!), sum over some count field, which is set to 0 for the dummy entries.. > Could the col array be created before in/exclusions ar aplied?\nI'm not sure what you mean here.... Hmm, that is an interesting idea, although I would implement it slightly differently: post- rather than pre-filtering. This problem of 'missing' keys is only indirectly linked to the filters: if you have a single \"color=blue\" row where \"shape=triangle\", then even if \"blue\" is included/not-excluded, this key right now doesn't appear in the output if \"triangle\" is excluded. I could imagine a flag that prevented this.. This isn't actually an app, it's a library that you can use to build apps.... Unfortunately I\u2019m not able to provide much individual help beyond the\ndocumentation and examples that are already available...\nOn Wed, Oct 10, 2018 at 03:27 MeriemBH notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHello Nicolas,\nCan you please explain how to use this library?\nthanks\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/issues/1023#issuecomment-428466797,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAMbA08aH9S4yBkvXb_FiUvnXw3jHPlvks5ujaFOgaJpZM4XTwxR\n.\n.

If you don't specify a width/height for the charts via rendererOptions then on each render, the width and height are computed based on the viewport (the logic is here). .

Yes, this is an oversight. I'll add support for this in the coming days.. This is now possible via the plotlyConfig renderer option: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Optional-Extra-Renderers#plotly-rendereroptions. At the moment, the plotly renderers are not responsive, even though plotly.js has recently started supporting some new options for this kind of thing. At some point I'll have to try to see if they can be supported here as well.. No modification is required, you should be able to just pass in the plotlyConfig renderer options with responsive set to true.... See the docs here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Optional-Extra-Renderers#plotly-rendereroptions. Can you provide a runnable example like a CodePen or JSFiddle so that I can more easily help you?. Try the hiddenFromAggregators parameter :).

There's not much I can do to help you if you can't show me what the problem is :) \n\nIf you can't reproduce it in a CodePen then it's likely due to something outside of PivotTable.js... . Probably your best bet would be to provide a template attribute to plotly.js via the rendererOptions. Here is the documentation for templates: https://plot.ly/javascript/layout-template/. Ah, unfortunately I'm mistaken, and there is no way to override the current behaviour of the hoverinfo because the renderer itself overrides it. Perhaps that's something it shouldn't do. I'll think about it for the next release.. Yup, this is pretty clear, but unfortunately there's no functionality for that, and I can't think of a workaround other than post-processing the table in the onRefresh callback to drop the rows you want to drop.\nSee also #1044 which seems really similar :). @saad55555 please don\u2019t post off-topic request for people to address you other concerns. You have already raised your issue in the rPivottable repo and stackoverflow, and this issue is not the place to bring it up again.. @Saad55555 I do understand, but I'd still like you to comply with this repo's documented support guidelines and not try to hijack existing issues. If you want to open another issue that's fine. That said, the appropriate repo for your concern is the rPivottable repo, and you already have an issue open there. If no one is responding then either they are busy or there is no clear way to accomplish what you are trying to do.. It's a pretty tricky problem for sure. Now that I think about it, perhaps a more straightforward solution would be to provide your own dataClass which would be a fork of PivotData that just doesn't return those keys to the renderer, that way those rows are never in the output in the first place?. I\u2019m not sure I understand your question, sorry, can you rephrase?. @Saad55555 I've already asked you not to hijack this thread with your unrelated requests. If you persist, you will find yourself blocked from this repo.. Yes, this is better-explained, thanks! You can write in french btw, I live in Qu\u00e9bec ;)\nSo right now this library supports input-level filtering based on the attribute values, but not output-level filtering based on aggregator-computed-values, and I don't think I can imagine a nice general-purpose UI for that second use-case at the moment, so I'm not that worried about not having a way to do it, personally.. Unfortunately there's no functionality for that, and I can't think of a workaround other than post-processing the table in the onRefresh callback to drop the rows you want to drop.. \nSee also #1043 which seems really similar :). There's no feature for this right now. It's been requested before in issue #492 so I'm closing this as a duplicate.. This is very interesting, thank you! Nice work!\nI don't love the idea of maintaining two functions like this, but I do like the idea of getting away from <table> tags so perhaps instead of making this pivotUI2 we could just make this a breaking change by bumping the version number of PivotTable.js to 3.0 and make this the primary pivotUI function. I'll give it some serious thought in the days to come.. As a different approach to supporting both functions, could we imagine this implemented as a series of if statements controlled by a new parameter, rather than duplicating quite so much code?. I think I'd call the option tag, defaulting to table but also accepting div, rather than responsiveLayout, as the latter makes a bit of a promise about responsiveness that I'd rather not commit to ;)\nIf you feel like implementing this, it would definitely be something I'd consider merging in quite quickly, and I might even port it to react-pivottable as it seems like a solid addition!. Thanks! I'll take a look soon :)\nThe coffeescript equivalent of (a ? b : c) is (if a then b else c): https://coffeescript.org/#try:(if%20a%20then%20b%20else%20c). Lines 958 and 959 have to do with vertical vs horizontal layout of unused attributes. By default, the renderer controls are in the first td of the first tr and the unused attributes in the second td. In 'vertical' mode, they are in the first column instead of the first row.. Nice! I wonder if it wouldn\u2019t be easier to read to define near the top a few variables like tableTag, rowTag and cellTag which would be either table/tr/td or div/div/div and then just use those inside the $() instead of ternaries?. Ah, sorry about this. The whole gulp thing is pretty old and creaky at this point and could stand to be replaced by a much leaner and easier pipeline. I can't even get it to work on my machine without downgrading node to v6 with nvm :(. Hmm what failure do you see in the tests? I actually just realized that I see nothing in the tests page, which is a problem in and of itself!\nPS: you're welcome, and I'm glad you're finding this tool useful! The React version is quite fun to play with also but I'm maintaining both simultaneously, and there are a bunch of things like subtotals and localization which aren't supported by the React version (yet) as you say.. This isn\u2019t implemented yet, but in principle shouldn\u2019t be too hard if you\nwant to take a stab at it! :)\nOn Sat, Nov 10, 2018 at 04:03 DaveSimmons1234 notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nHi there,\nCan I click on a plot.ly bar graph and have it return an array of records\ne.g. like:\npivotData.forEachMatchingRecord(filters, function(record){\nint_ids.push(record.int_id); });\nWithin a clickCallback like method?\nThis would be super useful.\nThanks a lot for your help.\nD.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/issues/1048, or mute the\nthread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAMbA6zlijDOAnXEVacZlTVVpJOrdi_rks5utpZWgaJpZM4YX5o4\n.\n.

I see. There's no feature for this right now, no, but if you click on the little filter triangles, there you will see the count of unique values. You can also use the \"count unique\" aggregator instead of \"count\".\n\n. The existing click callback gets the original event as the first argument, so the button-identification issue should be pretty straightforward. I'd be open to a PR which controlled which event the click callback is called on: single/double/whatever :). Thanks for the pull request! I think this might be a little too simple, however... It doesn't take into account any quoting rules or commas within fields. The reason I had initially implemented TSV only was to sidestep these issues, as tabs are very rarely present within data values :). I think that's the best approach, yes. I'm unlikely to accept any invasive changes like this into the main library :). There's no good way to use this pivot table (or any other pivot table actually) to view this kind of data unfortunately.. That's ... troubling. are you sure you're using 'count unique' in both cases? Can you provide a working example in CodePen that shows this behaviour?. Ah I see. So pivot() doesn't look at aggregatorName. In this case you're using the default Count aggregator with pivot(): https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Parameters\nIf you want to use the same signature as pivotUI() but without the UI, you should probably use the awkward showUI: false setting of pivotUI() ;). Unfortunately this is not supported... See the FAQ entry here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#multi. I've never played with Shadow DOM so I have no idea about any limitations... If you're hitting issues then I guess there are issues ;). This is not possible at the moment unfortunately... See FAQ here https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#multi. Looks like it's working...?\n\n. Ah no, my mistake, your comment was clear, I just read it too fast :). Now that I've had a bit more sleep, I have good news for both this issue and #1067 : you can likely do what you want by defining a custom aggregator with a number format, in which case the C3 renderer will honour that. This is how the Sum as fraction of total aggregator gets its formatting to look nice.. Hmm. I don't really see what difference that would make, to be honest :) . There's no easy way to do this unfortunately, that I can think of.. See my comments in #1066 . That likely won't meet your needs for the max but the formatting will be nice. The license is here, and is pretty self-explanatory: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/blob/master/LICENSE.md ... it's the MIT license and lets you do pretty much whatever you want so long as you don't remove my copyright notice or try to sue me for any reason.\nWith respect to embedding into an HTML page, every page of the documentation here does exactly that: https://pivottable.js.org/ and this section of the readme is pretty clear: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable#how-do-i-load-the-code. It is in principle possible to use this with angular but I haven\u2019t done it and am not maintaining any supported documentation for it.. See #208 for various conversations about this. Can you elaborate a bit please?. If you look at the contents of your JSON file, they don't match the call signature of pivotUI() so you'll need to munge the data a bit :). Neat idea!\nYou could start by trying to make a special aggregator that works a bit like the builtin listUniques in terms of the output of its format function (which is what is displayed in the table) but returns a different value i.e. not an array.\nThe reason this might work is that the heatmap renderers reads the value to colour by not from the textual contents of the cell but from a data attribute added to the <td> tag by the underlying table renderer before calling the format function.\nSet here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/blob/master/src/pivot.coffee#L556\nRead here: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/blob/master/src/pivot.coffee#L1068\n. Indeed you cannot reuse anything, you must call pivotUI again. If you want to have the output stay as it was, you\u2019ll need to capture it first with the onRefresh callback and feed it back into the second call. There's no option for those at the moment, and I don't think it's a common enough need that I would want to expand the API to enable this at the moment.... There's no feature for this, but you can likely hide it via CSS. Why is the menu rendering in the middle though, is this some extra CSS you have that's messing with things?. Can you provide a CodePen or JSFiddle or equivalent that shows the problem please?. This library only charts data in the dataset provided, so that \"Count\" column is in the actual data. You can suppress it either by deselecting that key in the filter menu, or by filtering it out of the data with the filter option or upstream :). (replying to your comment that I got via email but doesn't appear here on Github for some reason... was it deleted?)\nThe data is there but clearly there's a labelling issue as it's being wrongly labelled \"count\". That's a bug which I'll have to fix. thanks for raising it!\n. You can go one of two ways: you can wrap the TableRenderer in your own function, like the way the built-in Heatmap renderers work, or you can post-process the table using the onRefresh callback.. Unfortunately you\u2019ll have to either write the jquery function or make a copy of the table renderer and modify it as I don\u2019t think this is a feature I\u2019m interested in baking into the core of this library.... Yes: all data is processed client side with no external calls.\nOn Mon, Feb 11, 2019 at 11:27 goerd notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHey,\nit is more a question than a real issue. :-) I have received for a\nresearch project highly sensitive medical data.

Hi there! \n\nIt's definitely in my plans to wrap the sibling project to this one, react-pivottable, so as to make it accessible from Dash, but I haven't found the time recently and likely won't in the coming weeks.\nThat said, it's actually pretty easy to do: the process is well-documented here https://dash.plot.ly/plugins\nMy plan has been to add a PivotTable Dash component to our dash-extra-components library here https://github.com/plotly/dash-extra-components so if you felt like doing it and submitting it as a PR, someone from our Dash team might be able to give you a hand, and it would likely be maintained by us moving forward :)\nGood luck with your earth-shattering! Please leave us enough to live on :P\nNick. looks like one of Plotly\u2019s superstar interns got motivated to do this :)\nhttps://community.plot.ly/t/show-and-tell-dash-pivottable/20112. What is \u201creport generation\u201d in this context?. Ah i see. No, there is feature for interrupting this process.. Thanks for letting me know! Clearly I've been remiss at actually running these tests, as this one didn't get updated for new behaviour introduced over a year ago in https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/commit/2467d69953a442a11ab708447499792f74c601a7 :) They're running clean again now: https://pivottable.js.org/tests/\n. Thanks for this PR!\nA few questions:\n\nHow is this different from Subtotal.js?\nDoes this have any applicability other than for a table-like renderer, i.e. graphs?. OK, thanks for those answers. I'm hesitant to merge these changes into the main library as that means I will have to maintain them for the next few years, so I'll need to think about it a bit.\n\nOne other possibility... It looks like the changes you've made are in PivotData and the TableRenderer which is good, because both of those are injectable into PivotTable.js via parameters (dataClass and aggregator) without me merging this in, so you could do something similar to Subtotal.js and host your own repo with just those two components and the documentation for using them instead of the defaults if you like.... This is basically how things started with Subtotal.js btw, after I added the dataClass parameter specifically for this use-case ;)\nSee: https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/pull/506. This library is not designed to display 5k x 5k tables... That's 25 million cells. As I said in a previous issue (#599), if each cell was 1px by 1px, you would need a grid of 3 by 5 HDTVs to render it, and I just don't think that this kind of thing gives a reasonable user experience, so I'm not interested in supporting this use-case.. I'm sorry, but that is not a feature of this library at this time.. I have no experience with any of the approaches you mention... they may or may not work, and the only way to know is for you to try :) . This should be pvtVals no?\n. I would prefer that this be an object like {\"attr1\": [\"value1\", \"value2\", \"value3\",...], ... } rather than an array\n. Shouldn't this be opts.exclusions ?\nAlso: this code doesn't seem to store the user-selected values for the exclusions at all...?\n. I'm not sure I understand what this modification aims to do...\n. The API for pivot() assumes that the aggregator is given by the aggregator parameter, not looked up in an aggregators list, so this is a major API change, which I am not really in favour of.\n. Thanks for this. I will try to find time to port it into Coffeescript for inclusion.\n. so in this function we don't use jQuery, for performance reasons, as there can be many cells.. not sure about this signature... What are we trying to enable within the callback? Mostly I think people want to be able to extract the matching records, but providing the data in this way doesn't seem like the easiest way to enable that.. OK, actually with a new method on PivotData this could be really good.. ",

Now, cloning the key array before sending it to create aggregator.\n```\ncallWithJQuery = (pivotModule) ->\nif typeof exports is \"object\" and typeof module is \"object\" # CommonJS\n    pivotModule require(\"jquery\")\nelse if typeof define is \"function\" and define.amd # AMD\n    define [\"jquery\"], pivotModule\nPlain browser env\nelse\n    pivotModule jQuery\ncallWithJQuery ($) ->\nsubtotalProcessor = (opts) ->\n    colAttrs = opts.cols\n    rowAttrs = opts.rows\nprocessKey = (record, totals, keys, attrs, f) ->\n    key = []\n    addKey = false\n    for attr in attrs\n        key.push record[attr] ? \"null\" \n        flatKey = key.join(String.fromCharCode(0))\n        if not totals[flatKey]\n            totals[flatKey] = f(key.slice())\n            addKey = true\n        totals[flatKey].push record\n    if addKey\n        keys.push key\n    return key\n\n(pivotData, record) -> #this code is called in a tight loop\n    tree = pivotData.tree\n    rowKeys = pivotData.rowKeys\n    colKeys = pivotData.colKeys\n    rowTotals = pivotData.rowTotals\n    colTotals = pivotData.colTotals\n    allTotal = pivotData.allTotal\n    aggregator = pivotData.aggregator\n\n    allTotal.push record\n    rowKey = processKey record, rowTotals, rowKeys, rowAttrs, (key) =>\n            return aggregator(this, key, [])\n    colKey = processKey record, colTotals, colKeys, colAttrs, (key) =>\n            return aggregator(this, [], key)\n    m = rowKey.length-1\n    n = colKey.length-1            \n    if m < 0 or n < 0\n        return\n    for i in [0..m]\n        fRowKey = rowKey.slice(0, i+1)\n        flatRowKey = fRowKey.join(String.fromCharCode(0))\n        if not @tree[flatRowKey]\n            tree[flatRowKey] = {}\n        for j in [0..n]\n            fColKey = colKey.slice(0, j+1)\n            flatColKey = fColKey.join(String.fromCharCode(0))\n            if not tree[flatRowKey][flatColKey]\n                tree[flatRowKey][flatColKey] = aggregator(this, fRowKey, fColKey)\n            tree[flatRowKey][flatColKey].push record\n\n$.pivotUtilities.subtotal_processor = (opts) -> subtotalProcessor(opts)\n``\n. @nicolaskruchten Looks like subtotal processor takes minimum double the time of default processor. if I compare mps.html (pivotUI() with derived attributes) andsubtotal.html` with\nrows: [\"Gender\", \"Province\", \"Party\"],\n            cols: [\"Age Bin\"],\nOn my system with Chrome browser:\nDefault processor most of the times took: 4 milliseconds and TableRenderer most of the times  took: 12 milliseconds.\nSubtotal processor most of the times took: 8 milliseconds and SubtotalRenderer most of the time took: 16 milliseconds\nOne point I would like to mention is that, for a given dataset, as the row attributes and column attributes increase, time taken by renderer influences the user experience more than the time taken by processor. For e.g., in mps.html (default processor and renderer), with:\nrows: [\"Party\", \"Age\", \"Gender Imbalance\"],\n    cols: [\"Province\", \"Gender\", \"Age Bin\", \"Name\"]\nDefault Processor took: 7 milliseconds and TableRenderer took: 610 milliseconds\nSubtotal Processor took: 22 milliseconds and SubtotalRenderer took: 1200 milliseconds\nHence, we need to concentrate on making the processor prepare a data model that's performance friendly for the renderers!!!\nAlso, I noticed that calls to getAggregator consume almost 1/3rd of the total rendering time!!!\nHowever, the ultimate time killer is the html DOM elements creation about which we cant do much  unless we change the renderer.\nUpdate:\nAfter further analysis, I understand, processing time depends on volume of data and rendering time depends on number of cells (td or th) that need to be created. Large volume of data can result into less number of cells - based on unique/non-unique values. Keeping number of cells less is good for user experience. But, doing analysis from a large volume of data can be a necessity. So, one can't assume that rendering time is always more than processing time.\n. @nicolaskruchten , fine with merging the processors. However, I suggest to keep the processor option. This helps in trying out any new experimental/custom processing logic without touching the existing built-in processor. We can ensure that there is always only one processor in-built while retaining the ability to configure a custom processor if the developer wishes.\n. @nicolaskruchten Thanks for your response. Ability to override entire PivotData class is a good idea.... Agree... That will give more flexibility... just wondering whether overriding-PivotData will be expected to adhere to a minimal, agreed upon interface contract!!!???\n. @nicolaskruchten, I think the ability to replace gives more flexibility than inheritance... Also one can write a new-PivotData in JavaScript and replace the default one! That will bring in more contribution from JavaScript-only developers too...\nas you said, replacement opens up the possibility of writing different kinds of PivotData... Will wait for the replacement option :-)\n. @nicolaskruchten, as u had suggested, I've created SubtotalPivotData class that extends PivotData. Overridden ProcessRecord function. Introduced a link in index.html to the example subtotal.html.\nSubmitted PR #506. Please review and let me know of your feedback. \nAlso, the special character used for displaying triangleLink does not seem to appear correctly on my browser (chrome). Screenshot:\n\n. @thovo you can also check subtotal_renderers.coffee at Subtotals Branch for an example of adding a new renderer. It offers sub-totals and collapse-and-expand features.\n. @thovo issues #403 and #408 may be of use here...\n. @thovo also check hiddenAttributes option explained in Parameters Documentation\n.

Yes... also subtotal-renderer did not need any major re-work on this side.. It was a breeze :+1: \nI understand your points clearly... particularly from handling-the-maintenance point of view. I will host it in a separate repo just with subtotal-renderer code and create an NPM module.with dependency. \nWill wait for the dataClass parameter to be introduced into trunk.\nThanks for linking from FAQ :-)\n.

Hope you don't mind.\nThanks again to all of you for your feedback and support :+1: \n. I am not ashamed to confess that am an author of a renderer without even realizing that renderer is a function and not an instance!! Its you who should be blamed for it.... to have made things so simple for us.... Thanks :)\nWhy is renderer a function that just returns a DOM? Instead, can we make it an instance of a class with some standard contractual-APIs that can be invoked to render --- as in MVC pattern? Sorry if I have asked a lame question again!!! . Thanks. Am learning :). I will keep this in mind when making any changes/enhancements to subtotal.js renderer.. I think you need to choose where the pivoting needs to happen!.\nIf it happens on server side, it will help reducing the amount of data to be transferred to client... But then you wouldn't need a pivot table ui on the client side (pls correct me if i am wrong)\nOn the othethand, if you want the user to have entire data and perform pivoting on it, then data volume to be transferred to client may go up!!!!\nGood point to discuss about.... Waiting to learn from this discussion :). @chapt0011  yes you can bring in data in smaller chunks. But the pivot result on the client will be based on the data so far loaded on the client. And, the performance will be based on the client machine configuration!!!\n@nicolaskruchten it would be nice if you can point us to references of such architectures that would address such requirements. Thanks :). A roundabout way is to use dataTableToCsv() and convert CSV to JavaScript array using d3 or other libraries.. How about allowing 2nd popup to be opened only if the first one is closed or cancelled?. ",

    "cihadturhan": "It's been 4 months. Any progress on this? Because I need to use this in a project. If anyone started yet, I'll give it a try.\n. @nicolaskruchten I'll start then. I'll try to make it like igniteui pivotgrid does. However, the problem is I don't know coffeescript. (even changing id to classes was pain for me :) \n@rafaels86 could do somehow send me PHP code for a start point for me?\n. I can't use this code properly. Could you paste your code on viper-7 and click \"paste\" button then give me the link of result page?\n. Well, I said I wanted to but I've been so busy with the projects at work. It looks like I can't start for now or a couple of weeks.\n. @santoshdhanshetti I tried but had to stop as I'm busy with some other projects. \n. tl;dr A live demo\nHi, \nSeems like everyone is willing to see an excel export implementation :) I'm sure there are people know how to export to xls better than me. Anyway, I'll propose the steps below.\n- Build an XML tree. Why? - Because if you create an xml, it's easy to convert it ~~xml~~ xls. Xls file is a base64 encoded xml file actually.  How? - Every browser is a xml parser already because they parse HTML, a kind of XML. Here is the snippet to create a simple excel-like XML file using jquery:\n``` javascript\n//create root of xml\n$root = $('');\n//create a workbook\n$workbook = $('').attr({\n    \"xmlns:ss\":\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:spreadsheet\", \n    \"xmlns:x\" :\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:excel\",\n    \"xmlns:o\" :\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\"\n});\n/\n Add other elements here\n*/\n//add workbook to root\n$root.append($workbook);\n//retrieve full xml string\nalert($root.wrap($('')).parent().html())\n```\n- Now convert it base64 format and append required headers Why? - As I said above, xls file is a base64 encoded xml string. How? -Simple: Using web toolkit's small script will suffice. Just one line:\njavascript\nxlsObject = 'data:application/vnd.ms-excel;base64,' + Base64.encode(testXML);\n- Just say document to download it.Why? - To download. How? - like this:\njavascript\ndocument.location = xlsObject\nPrettified xml file and result\nEdit: typo corrected\n. Note that this is not a cross-browser solution. Most probably it won't work on ie :( \n. Try jsfiddle example I provided above and see if it works on ie10+\n. Related to issue 101\n. I thought making class names configurable is better because people may want to style them according to classes. For example, if someone wants to use this into bootstrap he can simply change the class to \"active\" or \"warning\" like this. Yet if we think that in terms of simplicity, you're right. It will add clutter and make people confused. Actually, I changed this according to my needs because I have our own css framework so I can easily changed class names and it suited like charm.\nFor reformatting issue, let me explain why it happened. I use Netbeans and a coffeescript plugin. It has own autoformat shortcut and I use it often. After commit I realized you use 4 spaces and I use 2 spaces for indentation. After I realized, I changed almost all by hand and that's why there are so many PRs.\nIf you want, I can pull a clean request. \n. Ok :) Should I correct the mistake above or will you do?\n. Try $selector.data(\"pivotUIOptions\").rows for rows and  $selector.data(\"pivotUIOptions\").cols for columns.\n. Link is broken :(\n. As I see you are using a custom build of jQuery UI. Maybe you didn't add sortable when you were building. So, did you check the file, does it include sortable?\n. related to https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/issues/138\n.

    "hajovonta": "Any progress? \n. I also encountered this issue. But I think it may worth the effort to investigate. Sometimes I can reproduce it with less than 1000 rows if there is not enough memory in the machine. I'd say it's fine; but I've noticed that the pivot rendering is pretty fast, only the drag&drop operation gets super-slow. When I push the mouse button, one of the cores go 100%, I have to wait for refreshing the dragged label with pushed button, then drag it where I want to, then wait for refreshing some seconds, then drop it. The table gets rendered in a second. Is there some costly loop in the drag&drop?\n. I'll try to (currently I have only proprietary datasets at hand), but as I mentioned, you will need to reproduce the conditions also (memory shortage). I don't know if it's feasible.\nI accomplished this by loading a large dataset into the memory, then have the pivottable work with a filtered subset. The subset was approx. 950 rows.\n. It was around 3m cells. In another issue I already indicated my problem of being unable to filter in certain cases - when there are too many values to display. I worked my way around this problem by having a filtering inputbox for each of the fields by which I can filter the dataset easily, then give the filtered dataset to the pivot. This way I can filter any way I like. But there are slowdowns sometimes, and I have yet to figure out when and why this occurs. Also, this is a \"stretch assignment\" to my application, I don't think that there will be such large datasets to display in practice.\nFor the filtering problem, I have an idea, maybe you can use it sometimes: why not include a regex filter capability on the filter popup? This way the user could filter even when the displaying of the individual values is not possible.\n. How do you add the extra space?\n. Thanks, I'm interested in your solution. I will try to test and think about enhancing.\n. This works very well for me. I copied several pivots into an Excel and all looked good.\n. Yes, why? \n. Thanks for your answer. I'm not very good in jQuery, and don't know how to properly reference the pivottable object's parameters after it was generated. After messing around I realized I'd rather need the \"exclusions\" parameter, and the idea is to read the contents of it.\n. Sorry for the confusion. I think you pretty much got what I was trying to say: there exists a parameter named \"exclusions\" (https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Parameters), with which one can specify default filters. It is different from \"filters\" in the sense that \"filters\" cannot be \"added back\" by the user after the pivot has been rendered.\nI'd like to display these \"exclusions\" on a separate div, maybe when a user clicks a button, but even better, automatically (but I guess it's not a scope for this question). Also, it would be nice to also display the values that aren't \"excluded\" - the complementer set of the above.\nCan I set additional \"exclusions\" or \"filters\" after the pivot has been rendered?\n. Just a little addition to better understand why I'm trying to accomplish this: when working with larger datasets, some columns are unfilterable in the pivot, because there are \"too many to display\" (the count is bigger than 200 which is default). This can't be easily solved by lifting the upper threshold for the displayable count, because the count is not known before displaying the pivot table (and would also make the pivottable rendering slower). My idea is to have a filterable table above or below the pivot, and when a user types a filter there, it would add to the pivottable filters as \"exclusions\" or \"filters\".\n. Yes, you are right, I need those that are deselected (in addition, it would be a plus to have those that are selected).\n. Can I also set them programmatically?\n. Yes that's working fine :) but after rendering, how can it be done? Do I have to re-render the pivot table? How do I do that (I tried to call the rendering function again, but the pivottable just disappeared)?\nAlso, can I get the items that are selected in the filter dropdowns (instead of those that are excluded)?\n. And I take the opportunity to express my gratitude for this great piece of software!\nThe onRefresh callback is just pretty much what I needed!\n. In case anyone is interested in the solution:\nIn the .pivotUI call, I put this line:\n\nonRefresh: mycallback,\n\nthen I have this function:\n\nfunction mycallback(myparams) {\n  var mypivot_exclusions;\n  mypivot_exclusions = myparams[\"exclusions\"];\n  ...\n}\n\nThanks a lot for the help.\n.

I can achieve this with a customized multi-aggregator.   The resultant GUI ends up looking perfect:\nsid         nov dec tot\ncp          10  13  115\nmm          18  20  200\nTOTALS  28  33  315\nI can also easily redefine the code to display \"group_name\" instead of the \"sid\" on the y-axis and that works perfectly as well:\n$(\"#output\").pivotUI(data, {\n    rows: [\"group_name\"],\n    vals: [\"nov\",\"dec\",\"tot\"],\n     $.pivotUtilities.gchart_renderers),\n    aggregators: custom_aggregators,\n    renderers: custom_renderers,\n    hiddenAttributes: [\"id\",\"nov\",\"dec\",\"tot\",\"sid\"]\n});\nOutput GUI:\ngroup_name  nov dec tot\nC                   22  28  253\nI                    6  5   62\nTOTALS         28   33  315\nSo as you can see, everything is working perfectly with the custom_aggregator.\nThe issues I'm encountering is if I try to use any of the GUI features now, for example if filter display group_name=\"C\",   it breaks the GUI and I see a blank screen... I also can no longer drag/drop columns, any time I try to perform any of the functions the GUI breaks/shows a blank screen...\n. @nicolaskruchten \nNicolas,\nI figured out the root cause of the problem.   It may be a bug the code.  If we look at pivot.coffee starting at line #729:\nif initialRender\n    vals = opts.vals\n    i = 0\n    @find(\".pvtVals select.pvtAttrDropdown\").each ->\n    $(this).val vals[i]\n    i++\n    initialRender = false\nYou are only setting vals=opts.vals if this is the first time the module is invoked.  That works fine but if the user then makes a change, perhaps filters on a field, or performs a drag/drop, what happens when the code gets invoked a second time, is the \"vals\" stays empty, and this is the reason the custom render was being passed an empty pivotData.valAttrs.  That would causes the GUI to break/not display any data.\nThe fix was pretty straight-forward:  place \"vals=opts.vals\" outside the if block:\nvals = opts.vals\nif initialRender\n    i = 0\n    @find(\".pvtVals select.pvtAttrDropdown\").each ->\n    $(this).val vals[i]\n    i++\n    initialRender = false\nOnce I recompiled the .js with the above change to pivot.coffee, I was able to get the multi-field aggregator functionality working perfectly.  \nLet me know if you would like me to commit a new version of pivot.coffee,  with @stephanvd's multi-field aggregator/renderer built-in.  I can also post the test/example that I used, which shows this functionality in action...\nCheers,\n-mike\n. Hi @kumar31rajesh,\nI have published my modified version of pivottable with the custom multi-field aggregator at:  \nhttps://github.com/unk1911/pivottable-multi-field-aggregator/tree/master\nIt's based on a relatively fresh version of pivottable.\nThe example file is located in ./examples/mf_agg.html\nNote that the changes I made are in pivot.coffee,  so it should compile into pivot.js.     I was hoping @nicolaskruchten would somehow integrate it with his version some day :)   \nNote that the custom aggregator is called MFSum and the custom renderer is called MFTable.\nCheers,\n-mike\n. @nicolaskruchten \nNicolas,\nSounds good about linking.   The crux of the update, when it comes to the core pivot.coffee library is essentially just a minor tweak on line #880 which involves setting the \"vals=opts.vals\" outside of the if initialRender block, as can be seen here:   \nhttps://github.com/unk1911/pivottable-multi-field-aggregator/blob/master/pivot.coffee\nvals = opts.vals if opts.aggregatorName? and opts.aggregatorName is \"MFSum\"\n            if initialRender\n                i = 0\n                @find(\".pvtVals select.pvtAttrDropdown\").each ->\n                    $(this).val vals[i]\n                    i++\n                initialRender = false\nCheers,\n-m\n.

Unless you were to sort your data set and use a searching algorithm (binary search is probably the only feasible algorithm if ID's are used), i doubt there would be any convenience or performance increases in using the indexes(Id's is the way you would probably use it) as opposed to the records themselves\n. I received an error using this code, the console logs a string \"[object Object]\" in the case where there is one record, however using 'd[0]' returns only '[' as .data('records') is only returning a string as \"[object Object]\" instead of an array of objects.\nI solved this in the pivot.js file by adding a toJsonString function.

This function uses an aggregator as parameter to retrieve records and convert to JSON style string of objects\nso in the code where you set: td.setAttribute(\"data-records\", aggregator.records);\nI instead just call this function to return the JSON string and all works great!\ntd.setAttribute(\"data-records\", toJsonString(aggregator));\nHope this helps anyone that encountered an issue like mine\n. very interesting topic, I think I will look into this as well, although I'm not too familiar with Node.js. From a current standpoint, I'd assume this would not be too hard to overcome using the MVC pattern\nCreating  a VM(viewModel) that sends the data to a partial view( which accesses the pivot.js file), then have the partial view called on drag'n drop(maybe even row and column header update). Obviously in this case, using .pivotUI, the table would need to be recreated every time a field is dragged over, unless there is a way to only update the dataset that is used and not recreate the table?\nThis, of course, assumes that the data requested is related to the fields being filtered or fields that need to be shown. The partial view need only represent the requested data, also the data for the VM is then queried server side.\nPlease let me know if anyone has looked into this, and if a request for a pull request was made, maybe to have a few of these necessary PivotTable properties accessible via get/set methods\n. I apologise, I kept saying \"create a new pivot table based on data\" for the functions purpose. That was wrong, I meant \"query the data and return the data in table form based on certain selected fields(ie, from pivot colKeys)\n. found my answer, or something like it :)\nhttps://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/pull/141\n. You could simply re-order the aggregators within the Pivot.js file.\neg.\naggregators = {\n    intSum: aggregatorTemplates.sum(0),\n    sum: aggregatorTemplates.sum(2),\n    average: aggregatorTemplates.average(2)\n};\naggregators = {\n    average: aggregatorTemplates.average(2),\n    intSum: aggregatorTemplates.sum(0),\n    sum: aggregatorTemplates.sum(2)\n};\n. Im not really sure what it is you are asking, but in Nicholas' absense, I hope I can point you in the right direction. \n\"Also, I want to bind something to the event when the user changes filters (and this function would run and do something with the filters).\" - I assume you are referring to an event tied to the draggable filters. I would start off with a jquery function fired on update for all '$(\"span.pvtAttr\")'.\nThe values in these filters are also already sent from the pivot.js to your html page. So they can be accessed via '$(this).data(\"filter\")'. With these identifiers you will just need to write up some logic that would select all deselected elements and then some code would build a table to do display them\n. I'm sorry I don't quite understand what you meant by needing an exclusions parameter, can you explain?\nSo... Assuming this \"exclusions\" parameter refers to fields that have NOT been selected and instead, filtered OUT of what is displayed on the pivot Table. Do you want to display all records that fall under these deselected filters on a seperate 'div' from the pivot table?\nAlso, instead of \"object's parameters\" rather refer to them as draggable filters, just to avoid such confusion\n. Ah I see, firstly, you would definitely need to update the pivot.js so that you can have function that would 'get' the values from the \"exclusions\" parameter(Obviously after the table is rendered as this value is set during the pivotUI method). Having played around with the pivot tool to a certain extent. I can confirm that if you are planning on changing these  \"exclusions\", the table will need to be rebuilt to compensate.\nThere may be a way to workaround this, but I haven't played around much with exclusions, I think you may be working with the wrong parameter. So just to confirm, what you are intending on displaying, on a separate div, is the values that are deselected from the draggable filters? As this is what the \"exclusions\" parameter actually represents\n. Hi,\nRegarding, specifying aggregators, I would see 2 methods of approaching this.\n1. As a temporary solution, commenting out or removing the unwanted aggregators under aggregators, in the pivot.js file will work.\n2. As a more permanent solution, you could duplicate a few of the aggregators that would be \"most common\" and have switch - case statements that would select which group of aggregators to show in the dropdown, based on something the user clicks before the pivot table is rendered(maybe something like \"Basic\" and \"Advanced\"). Obviously in this case, the pivotUI method's parameters would need to be changed to accept the value representing which aggregator group to use, based on the option the user clicked. This approach involves some extra client-side javascript and quite abit more in the pivot.js file.\nI haven't looked into this myself, but I hope this logic points you in the right direction.\n. Raaffaaeell, I would highly recommend diving into the pivot.js file, explore, edit, enjoy. Then ctrl+Z spam when you hit problems :)\nJokes aside, it will really give you a grip on what's happening on the inside and increase your confidence in adding additional functionality to the pivot tool\nSent via my BlackBerry from Vodacom - let your email find you!\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: raaffaaeell notifications@github.com\nDate: Fri, 22 Aug 2014 09:52:45 \nTo: nicolaskruchten/pivottablepivottable@noreply.github.com\nReply-To: nicolaskruchten/pivottable reply@reply.github.com\nCc: AbdulGoolabdulg@live.com\nSubject: Re: [pivottable] How to specify only some aggregators and Translation\n Issue (#202)\nAbdulGool, I came to the same conclusions to that problem of specifying only some problems, minutes before the reply haha.

It should be alot easier to meet your requirement than taking the javascript route. Creating multiple views with each pivot config(Link). The only difference in the views being \"rows\", \"cols\" and \"vals\" values.\nThe only need for the JS approach you may want to take, would be to rebuild the pivot table on the same view. \nIf you really want to use the JS approach. I would suggest building an Object of arrays with all required keys, it would then be simple to just create/amend that object with the specific values for its keys based on whichever button/link is clicked. Then render the pivot table.\nHope this helps.\n. This logic will need to be written in the pivot.js file. Within the 'average' aggregator definition, you could write your code that would only average non zero fields/ values.\nMaybe an example could help with more assistance\n. ",

Hi Nicholas,\n\nI was able to test this dataset this morning, and although it loaded smoothly, I do not think this can be considered a valid test-case since you're changing multiple variables: content and datasize. Your data takes up less than a quarter of the space than mine, so I would assume this would have an impact on how the pivot table is able to load the data into memory pre-rendering.\nI'm not really sure what you're asking: \"Are you seeing different behaviour on your end? Does your data have much higher cardinality than 25 or so? How many cells are you expecting to see in the final table which is not generating correctly?\"\n1) No, I see that same behavior on my end, with your data, just not with mine.\n2) I don't know the data that well, but I would have to think the cardinality is pretty low.\n3) Well since the final table is never even visible, I would say 100% of the cells are not generating correctly...\n. It still works for me too, despite sometimes giving a javascript error when the table gets too big.\nI'm not sure how to answer that. When I am able to load the pivot table I'm not using any default parameters, the pivot table is instantiated with no columns or rows set, so I guess I expect to see 0?\n. Sure, it has more rows than I've been able to load so far, it has more columns than I'm trying to use, I think my cardinality must be lower and it's smaller in megabytes. The only differences I can see are content (you have a single letter per record... obviously this is easier for the javascript to parse) and formatting (json vs csv)\n. The configuration of the pivot table is pretty basic:\ngoogle.load(\"visualization\", \"1\", {packages:[\"corechart\", \"charteditor\"]});\n$(function()\n{\n    var derivers = $.pivotUtilities.derivers;\n    var renderers = $.extend($.pivotUtilities.renderers, $.pivotUtilities.gchart_renderers);\n$.getJSON(\"mpsAssum.php\", function(mps) \n{\n    $(\"#output\").pivotUI(mps, \n    {\n        renderers: renderers,\n        cols: [\"Product Name\"], \n        rows: [\"Dossier\"],\n        rendererName: \"Table\"\n    });\n});\n. Sorry Nicolas, we've had to focus on other areas of development so we are\nlimiting the data. I may revisit a larger data set later and will certainly\nupdate you on anything I discover.\nThanks for developing such a great plugin.\nOn Oct 5, 2013 9:55 AM, \"Nicolas Kruchten\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHi, is there any update on this issue?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/issues/36#issuecomment-25748919\n.\n. Hi Nicolas,\n\nWe're taking another pass at getting the PivotTable to accommodate our data volume rather than restricting the input.\nI was wondering if you could provide a copy of the dataset used to support the following \"Why is it good?\" statement: \"works acceptably fast in Chrome on commodity hardware up to around a hundred thousand records, depending on the cardinality of the attributes.\"?\nAs I began re-testing this I started where you advised, including an alert before the pivotUI call. In lower-volume sets (~<20,000) the alert loads in a timely fashion, however, when increasing the number of rows towards 50,000, I never get an alert (or do after many, many minutes of seeing a blank page).\nI believe this confirms your initial suspicion, that the browser is choking when it tries to parse my JSON, right?\nIf so, I'm not sure how to proceed. I guess I can accept the fact that I just can't load that many records due to the complexity of my data in the JSON, however, that would be a shame.\nA colleague suggested that this problem may be alleviated, at least in part, by moving some of the data processing (especially the aggregation functions) to PHP rather than Javascript. This will require many more AJAX calls when the user changes chart type, plotted columns, etc., but I think the performance increase would justify the development time. Did you ever consider or put any time into creating a version that supports some level of server-side processing?\nDo aggregated values get calculated when the PivotTable is initialized or when that particular aggregation type is selected? \n. Wow thanks for the fast reply.\nThanks for the suggestion on JSON data formatting, I am going to try converting my datasource from array of objects to array of arrays later today to see if that affects performance at all. However, as to your suggestion of chunking the JSON, I will quote my original post: \"But I'm not really sure how to do this. I can't find anything in the documentation that lets data be loaded in piecemeal, after the initial instantiation of the table. Is this possible?\" Your reply seemed to indicate that there was no way to load data to the PivotTable in segments, so I did not continue thinking about this. Can you provide any pointers as to how the author of https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/issues/29 was able to modify the plugin's core to allow for this?\nI revisited the cardinality discussion from prior posts and researched the actual meaning a little bit more. Unfortunately I think our data has an unlimited level of cardinality, if such a thing is possible? I don't believe any two values in our set are the same. And if they are, it is purely coincidence as they are very precise: eg. have many decimal points.\n. Yes, that makes a lot of sense, thanks for the walkthrough. I'm going to try this out later tonight. Do you recommend I try this before changing from array of objects to array of arrays?\nI'm going to include some more info I uncovered from my testing:\n1k       149kb 2.2s 2.748s\n10k    1.4MB 2.5s 5.828s\n15k    2.1MB 3.3s 8.193s\n15.1k 2.1MB 2.8s 8.452s\n15.2k 2.1MB 2.6s 7.586s\n15.5k 2.2MB 2.5s -----\n17.5k 2.4MB 2.6s -----\n20k    2.8MB 2.8s -----\n25k    3.5MB 3.0s -----\n50k    6.9MB 3.8s -----\nWhere values correspond to number of rows, size of JSON response, time to retrieve JSON from server and time to render PivotTable after $(document).ready() - Using ---- to indicate that the PivotTable never became visible.\nAs you can see, as before in my OP, some sort of threshold is being reached after 15.2k records. This led me to think that there was some kind of data problem, so I changed somethings and found:\n20k    2.8MB 2.7s 9.547s -- every column (replacing \" and ' in value and column)\n50k    6.9MB 3.8s 29.25s -- every column (replacing \" and ' in value and column)\n55.5k 7.6MB 3.93s 34.551s  -- every column (replacing \" and ' in value and column)\n60k 8.2MB 4.44s  -- every column (replacing \" and ' in value and column) - ERRORS  Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded\n70k 9.6MB 4.49s  -- every column (replacing \" and ' in value and column) - ERRORS  Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded\n80k 11.0MB 7.12s  -- every column (replacing \" and ' in value and column) - ERRORS  Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded\n100k 13.7MB 5.88s  -- every column (replacing \" and ' in value and column) - ERRORS  Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded\nm\nc.querySelectorAll.m\nf.fn.extend.find\n(anonymous function)\n(anonymous function)\n$.fn.pivotUI\n(anonymous function)\no\np.fireWith\nw\nd\nAs you can see, when I use str_replace in PHP to remove quotes from the values, before feeding the JSON to the PivotTable, I am able to load far more records (up to 55.5k) however the table takes upwards of thirty seconds to render (after jquery.ready). Is there anything I can do to optimize this time?\nAnd I've just been informed that our prior target of being able to handle 300,000 rows is not still accurate. We now have 1.7 million records and that is potentially the tip of the iceberg. Do you think there's a chance if I'm chunking, using arrays of arrays and doing a lot of the math on the server side that it could potentially handle this much data?\n. Another issue we're having is that the PivotTable is not rendering within IE7 or 8. \nI mean, I see the skeleton of a table which only says \"Total.\" No configuration options or data is visible.\nHave you encountered this at all? I know from browsing to the demo that the PivotTable is supported, and just that the Google Charts portion is excluded, but I'm not sure what could be different between your demo page and my test environment that's breaking IE7/8. Any insights?\n. ",
    "gibito": "Hi @nicolaskruchten \nAfter extensive testing, cardinality is definitely the culprit here. You can have 1,000,000 rows with recurrent items and all is fine. When you have even only 500 rows and each row has a different item, then we hang and crash the browser. Could you show us the points where we can insert defensive coding preventing this? Thanks.\n. Simply construct an array like:\n[\n        {color: \"color1\", shape: \"shape1\", owner: \"owner1\", ....},\n....\n        {color: \"color500\", shape: \"shape500\", owner: \"owner500\", ....}\n ]\nThis does not allow any grouping and table buildup/DOM nodes become the bottlenecks.\n. Yes, parsing is no the issue. HTML table build up and rendering are.\nHave you considered using alternative to HTML table that use virtual rendering of the viewport? (e.g., Slickgrid)\nOr any other architectural strategy you can recommend to prevent the browser from hanging?\n. Fully agree that it is not useful. It is important to prevent user from hanging the browser by mistake (e.g., automatic projections of rows in a spreadsheet). I am talking about defensive coding.\nIt would be great if you could point us to a place in the code where we can stop DOM operations in case of high cardinality. Thanks.\n. ",

However as of now it would contain the name of the aggregator (that of the property) which clearly cannot be blank.\nI am happy to tick this one off as well as soon as we get the second issue cleared.  See my suggestion in issue #78.\n. Guys, this is a holy grail: \"everybody\" wants to export to Excel from JS and there seems to be no universally applicable solution.  IMHO this feature should not be built into this (or any) pivottable component: it generates a proper HTML table that can be exported (as Excel, PDF, etc) via other plugins (if there's any :)).\n. nicolaskruchten, I have coded this but I cannot open a separate pull request (noob?) and I don't want to put any more into the one I already submitted.  Once that one is closed I open one for this; or merge into that one if you like.\n. One more thing: IMHO unused attributes should always be in alphabetical order (otherwise it's more difficult to find should there be many of them).  FWIW it's also been implemented in my fork (unused_columns_vertical branch).\n. Pull request sent.\n. Point taken. I removed the code even from my branch (and moved it over to my project -- obviously once the bug got fixed).\n. OK, as of now we have no sort and nice vertical alignments.  I'll look into the sort stuff a bit later\n. Sorting flopped back and now uses your algorithm for sorting.\nI extracted the natSort method from PivotTable.  This is one way to do it; perhaps there is a better one: let me know if you like it or how to go about it differently.\n. This is the way in coffeescript:\n$(\"#output\").pivotUI pivotData,\n  aggregators:\n    Count: $.pivotUtilities.aggregators.count\n    Sum: $.pivotUtilities.aggregators.sum\n    Average: $.pivotUtilities.aggregators.average\n  renderers:\n    Table: $.pivotUtilities.renderers[\"Table\"]\n    \"Table Barchart\": $.pivotUtilities.renderers[\"Table Barchart\"]\nand in JS:\n$('#output').pivotUI(\n  pivotData,\n  {\n    aggregators: {\n        \"Count\": $.pivotUtilities.aggregators.count\n      , \"Sum\": $.pivotUtilities.aggregators.sum\n      , \"Average\": $.pivotUtilities.aggregators.average\n    }\n    , renderers: {\n        \"Table\": $.pivotUtilities.renderers['Table']\n      , \"Table Barchart\": $.pivotUtilities.renderers['Table Barchart']\n    }\n  }\n);\n. I was slow :)\n. It is OK, I'll do it (along with minor bugfixes in filters) soon.\nOne thing though: I may want to do something once the filtering is finished.  To that end some sort of event/callback mechanism would be most useful.  (E.g now we have a requirement to show selected/total elements for filters.  I positively do not think that it should be part of the component in general but I need to know when to update the data.  And I have the gut feeling that a notification would be very useful in general as well.)  So at this point I suggest an event/callback should be  introduced on completion of the refresh.  I believe it's not excessive: fairly simple to implement and use, and would satisfy a wide range of similar needs.\n. Sure, I'll recompile it next time.  I may not be as quick with this PR, though, for I have some other things to tend to...\n. Cool!\n. It is possible in this direction: since you're setting up both, use the same options(*) as defaults when initializing the pivotUI version.  (That is: first remove the non-UI then place the UI version into the same place when the 'Customize' button is clicked.)  Please note, however, that it's a lot harder to it the other way (\"freeze\" the UI version) because then the params are dynamic and not as easy to fetch.\n(*) more precisely: ones that result in the same output, aggregators sould return different values for pivot and pivotUI.\n. Well, IMHO it's not exactly the same.  You want to set the renderers for multiple pivots at the same time, the pic in Nicolas's website shows a different (I guess older) version of the component in which the renderer was rendered (:)) as radio buttons not as a dropdown.\nCurrently the radio button version is not supported in the code directly though a somewhat quirky workaround looks possible: hide the \"#renderer\" selectors, and change their values via JS driven by your own radio buttons.  I haven't tried but it should work.\n. On answering #85 I realized that I can force-refresh the chart via programmatically firing the \"change\" event on either the renderer or the aggregator selectors.  I haven't tried this; if it indeed works (and it should) it is a workaround and not that bad either...\n. The goal is to keep all aggregators but mark up numbers as red when below zero and green when above zero. That's what I did: https://gist.github.com/fastcatch/1c8e3c3efd36d902c7f0\nPlease, note that the only significant change is in numberFormat. (customAggregators is added to pivotUtilities to make them easily available.)\nWhat I'm getting at is that I found no easy way to replace/override formatting while keeping the aggregators (which work well and I get them predefined) less this one.  Maybe there's one and I overthink it again... :)\n. Thanks, Nicolas.  The best place for simple color coding is indeed rendering.  It did not occur to me but that's where it belongs.  Wrapping the aggregators looks like an option, too.\nUnfortunately, though, my case have got more complex so I have to roll my own aggregators anyway.  (It may lead somewhere useful though.  I have to add up currency values but they may be in different currencies (e.g. one cell is in USDs and an adjacent ell is in EURs).  I obviously do not want to add apples to oranges so I have had to keep them separate while summing up.  This is somewhat similar to having multiple value attributes -- I'll look into its more general applicability later.)\n. Couple ideas FWIW -- they may or may not be applicable to your situation:\n- In some cases I also have too-large-to-my-liking data sets (around 10MBs JSON).  I have been thinking of creating a mechanism whereby the data is aggregated on the server and this component is a front-end only.  It's like sending the params for aggregation via AJAX, receive the response, re-build the pivot from little data.  When you have a lot of data it may be even faster (though it's a hunch only, I haven't tested). It may work reasonably well provided that your aggregation mechanism is supported by well optimized engines (such as summing up values in a properly indexed relational database).  (Alas, you can even take this step further: an OLAP DB's bread and butter is to slice-and-dice through much data.  And they usually have decent pivot components.)\n- There is a completely different way, though: writing your own aggregators that are capable of incremental processing.  I haven't tried this but many aggregation operations lend themselves to incremental algorithms, such as count or sum.  Whatever already processed can be stored separately or fetched back from the pivot table; it can then be combined with the chunk received when re-building the pivot for the combined data set. It may not be very simple but I have the gut feeling that it is doable.  (Be warned: I haven't tried.  And of course there may be aggregations which are hard or impossible to do without the whole data set.)\n. So I understand that you want one of your attributes to be the value in the cells and your data structure is such that there is exactly one value for each dimension tuple (for the combination of all other attributes).\nIf that's the case try the sum function as aggregator (quick&dirty but should work) or roll your own (see Aggregators section in the wiki pages).\n$(output).pivot({\n  [... data ...],\n  {\n     rows: [...],\n     cols: [...],\n     aggregator: $.pivotUtilities.aggregators.sum(yourValueVariableName)\n  }\n});\n. It works for me :):\n$('#output').pivot(\n[\n  {'Gebiete': '3356000', 'Geschlecht':'M', 'alter': '10-14', 'v': 44369.5},\n  {'Gebiete': '3356000', 'Geschlecht':'M', 'alter': '15-19', 'v': 42542.5},\n  {'Gebiete': '3356000', 'Geschlecht':'W', 'alter': '10-14', 'v': 41190.0},\n  {'Gebiete': '3356000', 'Geschlecht':'W', 'alter': '15-19', 'v': 39540.0},\n  {'Gebiete': '3357000', 'Geschlecht':'M', 'alter': '10-14', 'v': 68997},\n  {'Gebiete': '3357000', 'Geschlecht':'M', 'alter': '15-19', 'v': 68759.5},\n  {'Gebiete': '3357000', 'Geschlecht':'W', 'alter': '10-14', 'v': 64194.5},\n  {'Gebiete': '3357000', 'Geschlecht':'W', 'alter': '15-19', 'v': 63747.5}\n],\n{\n  cols: [\"alter\"],\n  rows: [\"Gebiete\", \"Geschlecht\"],\n  aggregator: $.pivotUtilities.aggregators.sum('v')\n}\n);\nproduces this:\n\nIf you're not happy with 3 decimals, your best bet (as of now) is to write your own aggregator.  (It's not that difficult, read the wiki.)\nP.S.: Do not call your value 'Value'; there seems to be an issue with that.\n. No, in fact not.  It has tricked me again (umpteenth time...): one is not supposed to do this:\naggregator: $.pivotUtilities.aggregators.sum('Value')\nbecause it will most likely fail (and if not then it will do something one does not expect).  The correct invocation is:\naggregator: $.pivotUtilities.aggregators.sum(['Value'])\n(At a given point the first form gets translated in a way that references 'V' as the attribute to sum over ...  I guess this is not intentional and may be fixed through type checking the [attr] param in standard aggregators and aggregator templates.  What do you think?)\n. All axes are jQuery UI Sortables that fire a receive event when an attribute is moved around.  You can subscribe to these events (see the example at the link above).\n. Try this (it works for me:)):\n$(function() {\n            $(document).on(\"sortreceive\", '.pvtAxisContainer', function( event, ui ) { alert(\"ok\");} );\n        });\nReason: pivotUI must be initialized so that the selector gets inserted into the DOM, so you have to bind 'live'.\n. Please note that the rows and cols arrays (that you passed in) do not ever get refreshed.  You can collect the current setup via jQuery selectors only.  I advise you study the refresh function (either in the original CoffeeScript version or in the JS version in the examples directory).\n. AFAIK filtering info is not included in the data set.  FWIW here's a way to extract excluded items:\nvar exclusions = jQuery.map( $('#output').find('input.pvtFilter').not(':checked'), function(item){ return $(item).data(\"filter\"); } );\n. Consider #107 instead of this one.\n. Use 'sum' as the aggregator; like this:\n$('#output').pivotUI(\n   data,\n   {\n       cols: ['Gender'],\n       rows: ['State'],\n       vals: ['Population'],\n       aggregatorName: 'sum'\n   }\n)\nor\n$('#output').pivot(\n    data, \n    {\n        rows: [\"State\"],\n        cols: [\"Gender\"],\n        aggregator: $.pivotUtilities.aggregators.sum(['Population'])\n    }\n)\nAlso please note that your JSON is malformed (there are missing commas) and populations should be a numbers (not strings).\nPS: please note the '[...]' around the argument to $.pivotUtilities.aggregators.sum() - I keep forgetting it all the time.\n. OK, I'll send another PR.\n. It works as per my tests.  If the new PR I'm to send does not work, let me know.\n. ",

Instead of editing the pivottable.js file (using CDN), I just did this:  $('.pvtTable').attr('id', 'testTable');\nTo remove the totals columns and bottom row, I did this:\n$('#testTable thead tr:first').find('th:last').remove();\n$('#testTable tr').find('td:last').remove();\n$('#testTable').find('tr:last').remove();\n    . You can use the css above to hide the total column and row, or you can add a bit of extra code to actually remove them.  Using the onRefresh callback, just add an ID attribute to the pivot table (used for this purpose and later for export), and then remove the offending column and row.\n$(\"#output\").pivotUI(\n      $.pivotUtilities.myData, {\n        rows: [\"row1\", \"row2\", \"row3\", \"row4\",],\n        cols: [\"col1\", \"col2\"],\n        vals: [\"values\"],\n        aggregatorName: \"List Unique Values\",\n        rendererName: \"Table\",\n        onRefresh: function() {     \n            $('table .pvtTable').attr('id', 'mytable'); \n            $('#mytable thead tr:first').find('th:last').remove();\n            $('#mytable tr').find('td:last').remove();\n            $('#mytable').find('tr:last').remove();             \n           }  \n});\nTo export to Excel, I experimented with several options and none seemed to work in all browsers or were able to handle the thousands of lines in my pivot tables.  I finally found one a couple days ago called SheetJS.  It even maintains most of the table formatting (colspans, etc.).  After including the necessary js files:\n<!-- SheetJS js-xlsx library -->\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//unpkg.com/xlsx/dist/xlsx.full.min.js\"></script>\n<!-- FileSaver.js is the library of choice for Chrome -->\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//rawgit.com/eligrey/Blob.js/master/Blob.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//rawgit.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/master/FileSaver.js\"></script>\nThen a bit of code:\n```\nfunction exportData(fn) { \n    return export_table_to_excel('mytable', 'xlsx', fn); \n}   \nfunction s2ab(s) {\n    if(typeof ArrayBuffer !== 'undefined') {\n        var buf = new ArrayBuffer(s.length);\n        var view = new Uint8Array(buf);\n        for (var i=0; i!=s.length; ++i) view[i] = s.charCodeAt(i) & 0xFF;\n        return buf;\n    } else {\n        var buf = new Array(s.length);\n        for (var i=0; i!=s.length; ++i) buf[i] = s.charCodeAt(i) & 0xFF;\n        return buf;\n    }\n}\nfunction export_table_to_excel(id, type, fn) {\nvar wb = XLSX.utils.table_to_book(document.getElementById(id), {sheet:\"Sheet JS\"});\nvar wbout = XLSX.write(wb, {bookType:type, bookSST:true, type: 'binary'});\nvar fname = fn || 'myFileName.' + type;\ntry {\n    saveAs(new Blob([s2ab(wbout)],{type:\"application/octet-stream\"}), fname);\n} catch(e) { if(typeof console != 'undefined') console.log(e, wbout); }\nreturn wbout;\n}\n``\nThen just trigger it with aexportData();` function call.\n. I'd like to piggyback on this request, but for the \"normal\" PivotTable.js.\nMy values will either be numbers with 2 decimal places, zeros with 2 decimal places (0.00), and null.  I'd like the zeros and other numbers to be displayed and formatted with 2 decimals places, and have the nulls appear as blank.  I'm pretty new to pivottables.js (since yesterday), so any examples would be very helpful.  \nBTW, it would be awesome if all your examples where in jsfiddle.. ok, thanks.. I know I can hide the totals column and row, but it sure would be nice if it was never created.  Any chance of making that an option?  The reason this is causing a problem for me now is when I use the NReco plugin to sort the columns, the plugin is changing the size of the table when it sorts to accommodate the totals and then I hide them with CSS and it leaves me with an unattractive table.. I honestly don't know enough about Git to do that.  Every time I click on New Pull Request, it asks me to compare changes - I have no changes or code to offer, just a feature request.  . Update?. That's cool, however it doesn't seem to work with PivotUI.  I can edit the .js file to disable totals, which for me is probably ok, but maybe it should work for both methods.\ndefaults = {\n    table: {\n      clickCallback: null,\n      rowTotals: false,\n      colTotals: false\n    },\n    localeStrings: {\n      totals: \"Totals\"\n    }\n  };. thanks for clarifying.

I adjusted the JQueryUI menu control to allow for user driven filtering (I am using jQuery.grep to handle the filtering because the pivot table is on an ASPX site and the server was having issues with the pivot filter functionality).

The date of the file that works fine is 11/28/2013, and the one that issue the error is 01/05/2014.\nI don't have the Git hashes because I only download zipped files.\nHope it helps.\n. The browser where the error appears was Chrome, I didn't test it in any other.\nThe examples works, but they don't change or reload the datasouce, as my application does. The error only appears after the datasource is reloaded, on the first time it works fine.\n. ",

    "widdi": "Hi\nfirst of all: thank you for your wonderful pivottables.\nYesterday I tried to localize numbers to the german notation (thousands separator \".\" and decimal separator \",\"). I used the wrapper to give my own numberFormat function to the aggregator just as you explained above: \nvar aggregators = $.pivotUtilities.aggregators;\nvar newFloatFormatter = $.pivotUtilities.numberFormat(2, 1, \".\", \",\");\naggregators.sum = $.pivotUtilities.aggregatorTemplates.l10nWrapper(\n    aggregators.sum,\n    newFloatFormatter,\n    function(label) { return \"sum of \" + label }\n);\nThis worked as expected. Although I had a pretty hard time to understand that  $.pivotUtilities.numberFormat does not return an actual format, but a number formatter function... Maybe I was blind, but I'm sure it would have helped, if the numberFormat method had a more descriptive name of what it actually does (perhaps numberFormatFunctionGenerator or something like that). \nOk, but now for my question:\nI would like to re-format all my aggregators. For every \"regular number aggregator\" it works as I wrote above with no problems. But when I try to overwrite a \"fraction of aggregator\" (such as sumAsFractionOfTotal) as follows\nvar aggregators = $.pivotUtilities.aggregators;\nvar newFloatFormatter = $.pivotUtilities.numberFormat(2, 1, \".\", \",\");\naggregators.sumAsFractionOfTotal = $.pivotUtilities.aggregatorTemplates.l10nWrapper(\n    $.pivotUtilities.aggregatorTemplates.fractionOf(aggregators.sum),\n    newFloatFormatter,\n    function(label) { return \"sumAsFractionOfTotal of \" + label }\n);\nI get the follwing javascipterror in my console: \n\"PivotData</PivotData.prototype.getAggregator@http://localhost:7070/static/js/all.js?autogz=1;v=8:49954\n__bind/<@http://localhost:7070/static/js/all.js?autogz=1;v=8:49380\naggregatorTemplates.fractionOf/</</<.value@http://localhost:7070/static/js/all.js?autogz=1;v=8:49571\naggregatorTemplates.fractionOf/</</<.value@http://localhost:7070/static/js/all.js?autogz=1;v=8:49571\n(last line is repeated very often, so it looks like an endless loop...)\nand the pivottable says \"An error occurred rendering the PivotTable results\".\nI would have expected that fractionOf returns a regular aggregator that can be modified by the l10nWrapper as any other aggregator... Can you tell me what I'm doing wrong? Or is it a bug?\nThank you,\nwiddi\n. Thanks for trying. But hey, no pressure. No reason to be sorry!\n.

Hello Nicolas,\n\nThank you for replying. I have tried to apply various table sorters to the table with class pvtTable, it does work for single tables, but as you pointed out it does not work when there are rowspans in more complicated scenarios. I read the wiki and it said that I would have to create my own Rendered, but the problem is I do not know how to start and I was wondering if somebody else had worked with it before. \nAll of my clients' users are asking for this and when I tell them it can't be done, they suddenly express a lot of disappointment because they have sorting on every other tool they use. So all the hype about being able to visualize the data in this pivot is dimmed by the lack of column sorting. At first I thought it was a one client incident, but the complaints kept coming from other clients too. I know it is my fault for not detecting this before giving my clients access to this tool, but I already did and I wish I could give them an answer.

Alright, so my attempts to calculate the weighted average, weighted value or just the weight has sucked so far.\nIn summary, my question is, how do I get total count within the pivot.js so I can use it for computing other values within my own defined aggregators?\nMore details about my whole issue here and why I need the total count (sorry, it's too long):\nI could be completely wrong in my understanding about weighted average and weighted values, but as far as I understand, the weighted value of a category depends on two things: a) sum of a category and the weight of that category.\nTo proceed, we first need to determine how to calculate weight of a category. The weight of a category can be given by the number of times that particular category appears, divided by, the total number of count. If you pick \"count\" as an aggregator, the weight of each value is given by the individual count values/the value obtained in the \"pvtGrandLabelTotal\" cell.\nOnce the weight is determined, weighted value of that category will be total sum of that category multiplied by its weight.\nHere's an example that illustrates the steps that I am trying to explain above:\nConsider this dataset:\n| Year | Expense |\n| --- | --- |\n| 2011 | 100 |\n| 2012 | 200 |\n| 2013 | 300 |\n| 2014 | 500 |\n| 2011 | 100 |\n| 2011 | 100 |\n| 2011 | 100 |\n| 2011 | 100 |\n| 2011 | 100 |\n| 2011 | 100 |\n| 2011 | 100 |\n| 2011 | 100 |\n| 2011 | 100 |\n| 2012 | 200 |\n| 2012 | 200 |\n| 2012 | 200 |\n| 2012 | 200 |\n| 2012 | 200 |\n| 2012 | 200 |\n| 2013 | 300 |\n| 2013 | 300 |\n| 2013 | 300 |\n| 2013 | 300 |\n| 2013 | 300 |\n| 2014 | 500 |\n| 2014 | 500 |\n| 2014 | 500 |\n| 2014 | 500 |\nThis dataset, when loaded into this pivottable, will look like this for count (when \"year\" is in row):\n| Year | Count of Expense |\n| --- | --- |\n| 2011 | 10 |\n| 2012 | 7 |\n| 2013 | 6 |\n| 2014 | 5 |\n| Totals | 28 |\nSo weight for each year will be, if we have a \"weight functionality\" (we want to calculate this):\n| Year | Weight |\n| --- | --- |\n| 2011 | 10/28 = 0.357  (this is why I need that \"total count\") |\n| 2012 | 7/28  = 0.250 |\n| 2013 | 6/28  = 0.214 |\n| 2014 | 5/28  = 0.178 |\nThe sum of \"Expense\" based on \"year\" will look like this (\"year\" in row, \"Expense\" in vals and aggregator=\"sum\"):\n| Year | Total |\n| --- | --- |\n| 2011 | 1000 |\n| 2012 | 1400 |\n| 2013 | 1800 |\n| 2014 | 2500 |\nSo, the weighted value will be (above sum * weight):\n| Year | Weighted Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| 2011 | 1000 * 0.357 = 357.142 |\n| 2012 | 1400 * 0.25   = 350.000 |\n| 2013 | 1800 * 0.214 =   385.714 |\n| 2014 | 2500 * 0.178 = 446.428 |\nTo calculate this, I tried to write my aggregator to calculate the weights and then the weighted value.

I took a stab at coding this and this is what I came up so far:\nin \"aggregators\":\njavascript\nweight: function() {\n      return function() {\n        return {\n          count: 0,\n          myWeight: 0,\n          push: function() {\n            return this.count++;      \n          },\n          value: function() {\n            myWeight = this.count/myTotal;  //(this is why I need to calculate the \"total count\" as                     \n                                                                            //specified in my question above.)\n                        return myWeight;\n          },\n          format: numberFormat(3),\n          label: \"Weight\"\n        };\n      };\n    },\nI have this:\naggregators.testWeight = aggregatorTemplates.weightOf(aggregators.weight, aggregators.sum);\nAnd then, I have this (similar to \"fractionOf\"):\njavascript\nweightOf: function(wrapped, wrapped2, type) {\n      if (type == null) {\n        type = \"total\";\n      }\n      return function() {\n        var x;\n        x = 1 <= arguments.length ? __slice.call(arguments, 0) : [];\n        return function(data, rowKey, colKey) {\n          return {\n            selector: {\n              total: [[], []],\n              row: [rowKey, []],\n              col: [[], colKey]\n            }[type],\n            inner: wrapped.apply(null, x)(data, rowKey, colKey),\n        mySum: wrapped2.apply(null, x)(data, rowKey, colKey),\n            push: function(record) {\n           this.mySum.push(record);\n              return this.inner.push(record);\n            },\n            format: function(v) {\n              return numberFormat(2)(v);\n            },\n            label: wrapped.apply(null, x)(data, rowKey, colKey).label + type,\n            value: function() {\n              return this.inner.value() * this.mySum.value();  // <-- this is the weighted value that I want\n            }\n          };\n        };\n      };\n    },\n. Yeah, please ignore the above rambling. I was confused myself and I realize that my calculations for \"weighted average\" may also be wrong above.\nBut I believe I finally solved the whole issue this time.\nConsider this data set below:\n| Departments | Number of Invoices | Sum of Days to Pay | Average Days To Pay |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent | 20 | 500 | 25.00 |\n| Legal | 200 | 9000 | 45.00 |\n| Technology | 10 | 600 | 60.00 |\n| Sales | 500 | 21000 | 42.00 |\n| Business | 150 | 7000 | 46.67 |\n| ~~~~~~ | ~~~~ | Average of Average Days to pay | 43.73 |\nAll I needed to calculate is 1) weight and 2) weighted days to pay and 3) weighted average\n1) Weight can be calculated by dividing the individual number of invoices by total number of invoices (e.g. 20/(20 + 200 + 10 + 500 + 150) = 0.02).\n2) Weighted Days to Pay = Average Days to Pay * Weight from Step 1.\n3) Weighted Average = Sum of all Weighted Days to Pay\nSo, the final output would look somewhat like this with the above 3 data:\n| Departments | Number of Invoices | Total Days to Pay | Average Days To Pay | Weight | Weighted Days To Pay |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent | 20 | 500 | 25.00 | 0.02 | 0.568 |\n| Legal | 200 | 9000 | 45.00 | 0.23 | 10.227 |\n| Technology | 10 | 600 | 60.00 | 0.01 | 0.681 |\n| Sales | 500 | 21000 | 42.00 | 0.57 | 23.863 |\n| Business | 150 | 7000 | 46.67 | 0.17 | 7.954 |\n| ~~~ | ~~~~ | ~~~~ | ~~~~ | Weighted Average | 43.3 |\nSo, if you notice, the Weighted Average = 43.3 is slightly different from Average of Average days to Pay = 43.73. The significance of that can be interpreted in different ways.\nFor example, someone may say, that the Technology vendors have only 10 invoices, but they take the highest average of 60 days to pay which is worse than everyone. But their number of invoices (10) is pretty much insignificant to the total number of invoices (880), so their weight is very low and they are not making a huge impact to the Weighted Average of days to pay.\nI actually was able to write an aggregator for this. It was very similar to \"FractionOf\". Below is my code. Let me know if this makes sense or if you think that I should be doing something different:\njavascript\nweightedValues: function(wrapped, wrapped2, type) {\n      if (type == null) {\n        type = \"total\";\n      }\n      return function() {\n        var x;\n        x = 1 <= arguments.length ? __slice.call(arguments, 0) : [];\n        return function(data, rowKey, colKey) {\n          return {\n            selector: {\n              total: [[], []],\n              row: [rowKey, []],\n              col: [[], colKey]\n            }[type],\n            returnValue: {\n                weight: wrapped.apply(null, x)(data, rowKey, colKey),\n                myAverage: wrapped2.apply(null, x)(data, rowKey, colKey)\n            },\n            push: function(record) {\n              this.returnValue.weight.push(record);\n              this.returnValue.myAverage.push(record);\n              return this.returnValue;\n            },\n            format: function(v) {\n              return numberFormat(2)(v);\n            },\n            label: wrapped.apply(null, x)(data, rowKey, colKey).label + \" % of \" + type,\n            value: function() {\n                var myWeight = this.returnValue.weight.value() / data.getAggregator.apply(data, this.selector).returnValue.weight.value();\n                var weightedAvg = this.returnValue.myAverage.value() * myWeight;\n                return weightedAvg;\n            }\n          };\n        };\n      };\n    },\n. Thanks for the clarification.\n. For 1), I think you are talking about 'vals : []'.\nIn short, here are the 5 options you can add:\nrows: ['row1', 'row2', ... 'row n']\ncols: ['col 1', 'col 2', ... 'col n']\nvals: ['val 1', 'val 2' ... 'val n']\naggregatorName: 'String' (e.g. sum, average, etc)\nrendererName: 'String' (e.g. table, area chart, etc)\nFor 2), I believe the drill down effect is automatically created as you add additional rows and columns. I mean, yes, it would be nice to have a \"+\" and \"-\" sign, but then add/removing rows and columns through drag and drop is so easy that the drill down feature doesn't add a huge value. But then, that's just my opinion.\n. This is excellent! Thank you so much for the feature.\n. I will definitely share anything that I find. I am new to node.js, but I am currently exploring all options to do this server side and node.js is on top of my list. \nAssuming if node.js is the answer, it would pave the path to do additional computations such as something like linear regressions or correlation analysis between the variables. Why not.\n. I personally liked the original settings where you could tap outside the filter box and the box would go away. I thought it was intuitive and easy to use. \nIf you, however, have to have that OK button, and if you are thinking of a close button I would suggest a simple X button on upper right side of the filter pop up panel. On mouse over the X button, you can show the label \"Cancel\". Simple and intuitive. \n. Sorting is something I was asked to implement as well. But to be honest, the client is not necessarily always right. Like Nicolas pointed out, implementing sorting on a multilayer table like that is just not practical. \nOne thing you can do (something I also did) was to import the same data set in another page as a standard table which has sorting enabled. Look up Data Tables plugin. I personalized the heck out of that plugin to give all sorts of random functionality that I was requested but couldn't be practically implemented by pivot table.\n. I think a lot of the questions asked here can be solved by a few little tweaks and some minor customized enhancements.\n1) About the charts, one primary reason I chose not to use Google Charts is because I can't control them 100%. That's why I wrote my own HighCharts module. Enclosed is a sample here on how I am using HighCharts instead of Google charts. Using HighCharts, you can easily draw Scatterplots (or any of the mainstream charts) without tweaking much on pivot.js (except the part where you have to draw the HighChart instead of the Google charts).\n```\nfunction getChart(chartType, dataArray, metaData) {\nswitch(chartType) {\n    case \"bar\":\n        return getBarChart(dataArray, metaData);\n        break;\n\n    case \"column\":\n        return getColumnChart(dataArray, metaData);\n        break;\n\n    case \"stackedcolumn\":\n        return getStackedColumnChart(dataArray, metaData);\n        break;\n\n    case \"line\":\n        return getLineChart(dataArray, metaData);\n        break;\n\n    case \"area\":\n        return getAreaChart(dataArray, metaData);\n        break;\n}\n\n}\nfunction getBarChart(dataArray, metaData) {\n    var chartTitle = metaData[0];\n    var xAxisTitle = metaData[1];\n    var yAxisTitle = metaData[2];\nvar myOptions = {\n    chart: {\n        renderTo: 'container',\n        type: 'bar'\n    },\n    title: {\n        text: chartTitle\n    },\n    xAxis: {\n        categories: []\n    },\n    yAxis: {\n        title: {\n            text: yAxisTitle\n        }\n    },\n    plotOptions: {\n        series: {\n            shadow: true\n        }\n    },\n    series:[]\n};\n\nvar headers = new Array();\n\nheaders = dataArray[0];\n\nconsole.log(\"GetCharts: dataArray.length: \" + dataArray.length);\n\nfor(var i = 1; i < headers.length; i++) {\n    myOptions.xAxis.categories.push(headers[i]);\n}\n\nfor(var i = 1; i < dataArray.length; i++) {\n    var currentArray = new Array();\n    currentArray = dataArray[i];\n    var categoryName = currentArray[0];\n    var categoryData = new Array();\n    //console.log(\"CategoryName: \" + categoryName + \" for data: \" + dataArray[i]);\n    for(var j = 1; j < currentArray.length; j++) {\n        categoryData.push(currentArray[j]);\n        //console.log(\"Category Data: \" + currentArray[j]);\n    }\n\n    myOptions.series.push({'name': categoryName, 'data': categoryData});\n}\n\n//console.log(\"Bar Chart Options: \" + JSON.stringify(myOptions));\n\nreturn myOptions;\n\n}\n```\nThe following is the change you would need to make inside the gcharts_renders.js file instead of using the google charts:\n```\n          var chartContainerDiv = $(\"\");\n      $('body').append(chartContainerDiv);\n          var chartContainer = document.getElementById('container');\n       \\\\I have no idea why I had to use an empty \n      \\\\element to add the charts to it, but this the only way I could draw the charts. Without this empty        \n      \\\\element, my charts wouldn't draw. If you come up with a better solution to draw the highcharts,\n      \\\\let me know.\n      var emptyElement = $(\"<span>&nbsp;</span>\");\n\n      $('body').append(emptyElement);\n      result = $(\"<div class='resultClass'>\");\n  var metaData = new Array();\n  metaData[0] = title;\n  metaData[1] = groupByTitle;\n  metaData[2] = vAxisTitle;\n\n  var chartResults = getChart(chartType, dataArray, metaData);\n  //console.log(\"Chart Results in jChartRenders: \" + JSON.stringify(chartResults));\n  var chart = new Highcharts.Chart(chartResults);\n  emptyElement.append(chartContainer);\n  result.append(emptyElement);\n\n  return result;\n\n```\n2) I had the same exact requirement about implementing hyperlinks within the data type. This is more of a specialized tweak. The following code snippets are the changes I did in the pivot.js to implement that:\nif(colKey[j].indexOf(\"http\") > -1) {\n            urlTxt = $('<a/>', {\n                        name: 'link',\n                        href: colKey[j],\n                        text: colKey[j],\n                        target: '_blank'\n                    });     \n            th = $(\"<th class='pvtColLabel'>\").attr(\"colspan\", x);\n            th.append(urlTxt);\nYou also need to do the same for the row keys as well:\nif (x !== -1) {\n          if(txt.indexOf(\"http\") > -1) {\n            urlTxt = $('<a/>', {\n                        name: 'link',\n                        href: txt,\n                        text: txt,\n                        target: '_blank'\n                    });\n            th = $(\"<td class='pvtRowLabel'>\").attr(\"rowspan\", x);\n            th.append(urlTxt);\n          } else {\n            th = $(\"<td class='pvtRowLabel'>\").text(txt).attr(\"rowspan\", x);\n          }\n          if (parseInt(j) === rowAttrs.length - 1 && colAttrs.length !== 0) {\n            th.attr(\"colspan\", 2);\n          }\n          tr.append(th);    \n        }\nNote: The code in the most recent release of pivot.js may have changed as I haven't updated it since last few releases.\nHope this helps.\n.

Hi Nicolas,\n\nHere's the link to my HighCharts plugin - getCharts.js\nI did not write the plugin as a .coffee file, but hopefully it can be used as a standalone javascript plugin file.\nIf HighCharts plugin is used instead of Google charts, then the following piece of code needs to be added (replacing the Google Charts code) in gchart_renders.js file:\n```\nvar chartContainerDiv = $(\"\");\n      $('body').append(chartContainerDiv);\n      var chartContainer = document.getElementById('container');\n      var emptyElement = $(\"\u00a0\");\n      $('body').append(emptyElement);\n      result = $(\"\");\n      var metaData = new Array();\n      metaData[0] = title;\n      metaData[1] = groupByTitle;\n      metaData[2] = vAxisTitle;\n  var chartResults = getChart(chartType, dataArray, metaData);\n  var chart = new Highcharts.Chart(chartResults);\n  emptyElement.append(chartContainer);\n  result.append(emptyElement);\n\n  return result;\n\n```\nIf there are any additional issues or questions, please let me know.\n. raaflaaeell, \nNote - you will need to add highcharts js libraries as well into your header. After that, \nReplace this code in gchart_renders.js file below:\ndataTable = google.visualization.arrayToDataTable(dataArray);\n      result = $(\"<div style='width: 100%; height: 100%;'>\");\n      wrapper = new google.visualization.ChartWrapper({\n        dataTable: dataTable,\n        chartType: chartType,\n        options: options\n      });\n      wrapper.draw(result[0]);\n      result.bind(\"dblclick\", function() {\n        var editor;\n        editor = new google.visualization.ChartEditor();\n        google.visualization.events.addListener(editor, 'ok', function() {\n          return editor.getChartWrapper().draw(result[0]);\n        });\n        return editor.openDialog(wrapper);\n      });\n      return result;\nwith this code:\n```\nvar chartContainerDiv = $(\"\");\n      $('body').append(chartContainerDiv);\n      var chartContainer = document.getElementById('container');\n      var emptyElement = $(\"\u00a0\");\n      $('body').append(emptyElement);\n      result = $(\"\");\n      var metaData = new Array();\n      metaData[0] = title;\n      metaData[1] = groupByTitle;\n      metaData[2] = vAxisTitle;\n  var chartResults = getChart(chartType, dataArray, metaData);\n  var chart = new Highcharts.Chart(chartResults);\n  emptyElement.append(chartContainer);\n  result.append(emptyElement);\n\n  return result;\n\n```\nAlso, in the same gChart_renders.js file, replace this code below:\n```\n$.pivotUtilities.gchart_renderers = {\n    \"Line Chart\": makeGoogleChart(\"LineChart\"),\n    \"Bar Chart\": makeGoogleChart(\"ColumnChart\"),\n    \"Stacked Bar Chart\": makeGoogleChart(\"ColumnChart\", {\n      isStacked: true\n    }),\n    \"Area Chart\": makeGoogleChart(\"AreaChart\", {\n      isStacked: true\n    })\n  };\n```\nwith this code here:\n$.pivotUtilities.gchart_renderers = {\n    \"Column Chart\": makeGoogleChart(\"column\"),\n    \"Stacked Column Chart\": makeGoogleChart(\"stackedcolumn\"),\n    \"Bar Chart\": makeGoogleChart(\"bar\"),\n    \"Line Chart\": makeGoogleChart(\"line\"),\n    \"Area Chart\": makeGoogleChart(\"area\", {\n      isStacked: true\n    }),\n    \"Pie Chart\": makeGoogleChart(\"pie\"),\n    \"Scatter Plot\" : makeGoogleChart(\"scatter\"),\n    \"Bubble Chart\" : makeGoogleChart(\"bubbles\")\n  };\n.

Hi, I'm using jquery ui 1.8.24 which does include sortable.  This is loaded before the custom.js.\n. I've downloaded v1.9.2 and checked to see if there was a double load, sortable issue is fixed now.

I don't think you need to do this via node.js and Phantom.js, The server could return a pre processed pivotData json object. Containing the calculated tree and totals properties. The aggregator objects attached to the pivotData object would just contain calculated values.  This light weight pivotData object containing only answers could then be seamlessly passed to one of the renderers.  On the server side the values in the pivotData object could calculated using sql or python pandas groupby statements or even other big data tools. You would need to rewrite all the aggregators in whatever server side model you where using. \n. On a similar vein I have been able to set a save table state based on a user session. The basic idea is to save the state of the table by doing a ajax call on the onRefresh event. The state is loaded by doing a call to the database. There of course need to be checks if the database returns anything etc, plus some cleaning of arguments. This should help :).  \n```\n   // Using simple html table input\n    var input = $(\"#input\");\n    var aggregators = $.pivotUtilities.aggregators;\n    var aggTemplates = $.pivotUtilities.aggregatorTemplates;\n   //empty default config\n    var pivot_arg = { }\n    var prev_config\n    //Call to get saved data \n    $.ajax({\n                type: \"POST\",\n                url: API_url + '/loadState',\n                async: false,\n            }).done(function(data) {\n                try {\n                var config_data = $.parseJSON(data);\n                if ((config_data.cols.length) > 0 && (config_data.rows.length) >0)\n                {\n                    prev_config = config_data\n\n                }\n                else\n                {\n                   prev_config = pivot_arg;\n\n                }\n                //Some cleaning\n                delete prev_config.derivedAttributes;\n                delete prev_config.aggregators;\n                delete prev_config.renderers;\n                 console.log('loaded state');\n\n\n            }\n            catch(err) {\n                console.log(\"Error Loading State\");\n                prev_config=pivot_arg;\n            }\n});\n\n//Add renderers\n    prev_config.renderers= $.extend(\n                        $.pivotUtilities.renderers,\n                        $.pivotUtilities.gchart_renderers,\n                        $.pivotUtilities.d3_renderers\n                        )\n//Onrefresh saves state\nprev_config.onRefresh=function (oData){\n             $.ajax({\n            type: \"POST\",\n            url: API_url + '/saveState',\n            data: JSON.stringify(oData, null, '\\t'),\n            contentType: 'application/json;charset=UTF-8',\n        }).done(function(data2){\n                 console.log('StateSaved')\n\n        })}\n\n//Call actual table\nvar $output = $(\"#output\")\nvar $pivotTable=$output.pivotUI(input\n        ,prev_config\n);\n\n```\n.

Maybe it's because bootstrap makes it so for label class. So maybe just like other elements with a distinct pvtX class name, adding a pvtSomething class would allow easier CSS overriding?\ntable class actually doesn't appear to have any problems, my previous attempt wasn't necessary at all for it. But for styling purpose alone, I agree that removing anything that might come across their (or just jQueryUI alone) common names is the best long term solution. So essentially have very distinct pvtX type of class names for functionality manipulation, and allow users to use jQuery to add classes at will, or have comprehensive doc on what class names are intended for custom styling. Or even further, something like this where it says \"tooltipClassname  Specifies a CSS class name to apply to tooltips to override the default built-in style.\"\nThank you!\n. :+1: looking forward to the change\n. @rkralston sorry I must admit that I haven't used this library for a long time.

The result from the in memory datatable is then saved into a TSV file and passed to D3 to create the visualization...We can do the same thing with this library.  The datatable does have a limit; however in asp.net you can create SQL Server tables on the fly, where you can append the data from the TSV file and then group and sum vales, dump the summarized view into a new TSV file for the pivotTable.

Well, yes, one would need to define all available columns during initialization. And then it should loop through the fields and ask for the domain (all possible values) for each field. The server-side implementation would then pull those distinct values from wherever it stores the data, and return to UI.. ",
    "nascif": "Hi Nicolas,\nYes, I think that would be the most natural format. The challenge might be to convert this arrangement to two columns, which seems to be what Google Charts expects for a scatter. Could you use the chart type as a hint to change the mapping? I understand it might be trick given how you made an abstract interface between the pivottable and its renderers - which is really cool, btw.\nAs for the aggregator, scatters don't really use them for display (position or size). Two options come to mind:\n1) Use them for color - say you are displaying stores by their coordinates (though of course a geo map would be better, just go with it for the sake of the example), the aggregated value could indicate the total sales of that particular store (a single color scale varying on saturation would be ideal). For aggregators that return categorical values (like listUnique, I believe) you could use the color to differentiate among them (say McDonald's orange vs Wendy's red).\n2) Switch to bubble plot if there is an aggregator. Or always use the bubble plot, and treat the lack of aggregation (count) as a special case where all markers have the same size.\nCheers,\n\u00a0 Nascif\nOn Saturday, April 26, 2014 11:51 AM, Nicolas Kruchten notifications@github.com wrote:\nHmm, I wrote a reply but Github seems to have eaten it :(\nThanks for the kind words about this project!\nI agree that a scatterplot might be a good addition to this library but I'm not clear on how to construct a pivot table whose output is compatible with the input to Google Charts.

What would the aggregator signify?\nLooking forward to your thoughts,\nNicolas\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Thanks for the detailed example. I have a better understanding of the issue now - there is a transformation that always takes place, assuming the aggregation associated with a pivot table, and the renderer is called after that. That means there is a limitation on which visualizations can be used - even if the number of options is quite high.\nWould it be feasible to have a flag to turn this behavior off, to allow for non-aggregated visualizations? Or to capture this behavior in a base AggregatedDataRenderer class, that extends a more generic DataRenderer? This would allow the use of the really cool infrastructure you put together to select variables to display other types of visualizations, that have to do aggregations their own way (or not at all).\nWe already talked by scatter plots and bubble plots. Another example:\u00a0imagine that I want to compare distributions. Histograms and boxplots are ideal for that, but they require a completely different type of aggregation.\nI noticed that you already thought about it and added support for binning through calculated columns. Problem with that is that they are only available at configuration time, so an end user can't bin on something that the programmer didn't make available. But it is nice that you can then turn around and use them in a group-by, very useful.\u00a0\nAnother example is showing relationships, like a network diagram, chord diagram or sankey. The treemap and the pivottable can show trees, but generic graphs are a different animal. :-) D3 has awesome examples of these.\nIf you decouple the aggregation from the variable selection and move it closer to the visualization itself, you would be moving in the direction of a generic data visualization framework.\nCheers, and thanks for your prompt reply,\n\u00a0 Nascif\nPS: Different topic: I would like to display values of a particular category as links, so that a user can click on them and launch an appropriate web page based on that value. This is a natural flow, I believe; you use the pivotable as a kind of data exploratory tool, and eventually you find something - a user name, a defect identifier, a city - that requires further investigation outside of the tool. I looked at the derived attributes feature and it seems to be the way to go - but could I use them to generate HTML fragments? I tried a similar path (pre-processing the values so that pivottable got a column of value) but the framework converted them to regular 'value' strings. Makes sense - you want to make sure that dirty data won't compromise your rendering - but what if I want to do it on purpose?\nThe idea is not only that I can see the aggregated values, but click on them to \"drill down\" to the detailed level behind them.\nOn Saturday, April 26, 2014 11:51 AM, Nicolas Kruchten notifications@github.com wrote:\nHmm, I wrote a reply but Github seems to have eaten it :(\nThanks for the kind words about this project!\nI agree that a scatterplot might be a good addition to this library but I'm not clear on how to construct a pivot table whose output is compatible with the input to Google Charts.

Will look forward for the new features!\nRegarding the drill-through (and having not read the issue yet) one idea is to create a variable value renderer, along the lines of the aggregated item. It could introduce a new column, or perhaps simply decorate an existing one. The configuration would take a variable name and a function that takes a value of that variable and returns an appropriate URL based on that value. \nAt rendering time (thinking of tables here) that decorator would be called along the lines described by Sudip. \nThanks,\n  Nascif\n(sent from my phone)\n\nOn Apr 26, 2014, at 2:16 PM, Sudipan Mishra notifications@github.com wrote:\nI would be happy to! \nThanks, \nSudip\nSent from my iPhone.

Looks awesome, that item 2 would be nice.\n. Hello deadserious,\nI'm not sure if someone is working on this kind of renderer. You could check https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/issues/160 for some insights. \nI did not went through the code of the highcharts plugin, but both google charts/highcharts code for the renderer could be a very good starting point for you.\nI'll take a look in the weekend to see if I can help, but I can't guarantee that I'll can write it, I'm pretty new to this project.\nCheers, hope it helps\n. Sorry for the lack of update, but I still couldn't look into it properly :( (and I won't have time until next weekend haha) I tried some tricks but it works a bit different from the charts \"supported\" (gcharts and highcharts), needs a careful look into it.\nCheers\n. AbdulGool, I came to the same conclusions to that problem of specifying only some problems aggregators, minutes before the reply haha. But thanks for the reply.\nI'm still trying to resolve that problem with the translations, I'm really thinking about modifying the pivot.js file (sadly) until someone come up with the solution.\nCheers \n. That sounds interesting haha.\nWhen I said modify the code, I was thinking about the names of the aggregators, not really more than this hehe. But I'm indeed looking through the code to see if I'm doing something wrong or it really is not supposed to work this way.\nCheers, thanks \nEdit: Wow, after debugging the whole thing I came to a solution but I don't know if it's how it's supposed to work. First I'll explain why it happens\nIn the function pivotUI, it set a defaults variable with all the defaul options, there, I get my aggreggators translated right at line 874 renderers: locales[locale].renderers. In my example, I send some renderers as parameters to the param inputOpts. These will get the default names of the redenrers, thus in english.\nAt line 895 we have the following code: opts = $.extend(defaults, inputOpts); This is where  the defaults renderers (portuguese in my case) are overwrited by the renderers in inputOpts.\nNow, my solution. \nAs I saw that locales[locale].renderers gets the renderer in the language you choose, I tried something similar to get them to send as params.\nvar renderers = $.extend($.pivotUtilities.locales[\"br\"].renderers, $.pivotUtilities.pivotUtilities.locales[\"br\"].gchart_renderers);\nAgain, I don't know if this is how it's supposed to work, but it worked for me. I'ld like to leave this open to hear a word from Nicolas.\nI hope this helps others to translate the plugin hehe. \nCheers, thanks for all the help.\n. Hey Nicolas, thanks for the reply. I didn't modify the code of pivot.js, nor did say to modify it. I was just explaining how I came to the conclusion, maybe I was wrong, I'm no expert in javascript haha.\nThe only thing that I did different from the example of the wiki was how I created the vars \"aggregators\" and \"renderers\"\nvar renderers = $.extend($.pivotUtilities.locales[\"br\"].renderers,\n                $.pivotUtilities.gchart_renderers,\n                custom_renderers);\n        var aggregators = $.extend(custom_aggregators,\n                $.pivotUtilities.locales[\"br\"].aggregators);\nand then\n$(\"#output\").pivotUI(\n                    tabelaPivot,\n                    {\n                        aggregators : aggregators,\n                        renderers : renderers,\n                        rendererName : \"Tabela Multifatos\",\n                        aggregatorName : \"Somar V\u00e1rios\",\n                        vals: [\"PERCENTUAL_POPULACAO\",\"PERCENTUAL_CLASSIFICACAO\"]\n                    }, \n                    false, \n                    \"br\"\n                );\nWithout specifying the languages in the first sample, it does not translate :(\n. Nicolas, I don't have the br file now, but I was testing with your fr file and it didn't work.\nThis is the sample that I tried. The only thing that is different from your example file, is that I specified the renderers there (because I wanted the gcharts_renderer too)\n```\n                    $(\"#output\").pivotUI(data, {\n                        renderers: $.extend(\n                            $.pivotUtilities.renderers, \n                            $.pivotUtilities.gchart_renderers\n                        ),\n                    }, false, \"fr\"\n                );\n\n```\nSee it ?\n.

Well, I got it to work after few tests.\nI used an id \"gChart\" for the div that you'll contain the chart, see below:\nresult = $(\"< div id='gChart' style='width: 100%; height: 100%;'>\");\nThen, after creating the wrapper (line 84) I wrote this piece of code.\n```\n  //adds the listener for the wrapper, event \"ready\"\n  google.visualization.events.addListener(wrapper, 'ready', onReady);\n//this is the function that will run when the wrapper is ready\n  function onReady() {\n        chart_div = $(\"#gChart\");\n        chart_div.innerHTML = '';\n        console.log(chart_div.innerHTML);\n  }\n```\nFor now it's printing on the console the url to get the image, something like the example from google:\ndata:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAZAAAADICAYAAADGFbfiA...\nI think that this could be used to create a button/link to print the chart generated.\nThoughts ?\nCheers\nEdit: Just noticed that the code of the result variable was not visible, fixed it hehe\n. Hi Nicolas, sorry for the late reply\nI just used console log as an example. I don't know how it works exactly, but after the graph is rendered, the innerHTML of the div is just a bunch of code, not that uri anymore.\nMaybe a button could be created to print that png, a link, I don't know.\nThey used this as example, as a link to a printable version.\ndocument.getElementById('png').outerHTML = ' < a href=\"' + chart.getImageURI() + '\">Printable version';\nAnd then we would need a div as follows\n< div id='png'>\nAnother thing I don't really know, where I'ld put the button/link to print it, maybe you have some great ideas to do this.\nCheers\n. Well, I made a custom link to the printable version, if anyone is interested, here's how I did it.\nThe file is the gcharts_renderer.js. Here's the code for it.\nAfter line 83, I created this varieable\nresultPrint = $(\"< div id='printGraph '>\");\nThen, after line 88:\n```\n  //adds the listener to execute the function when the graph is ready\n  google.visualization.events.addListener(wrapper, 'ready', onReady);\n//the actual code for the onReady function\n  function onReady() {\n        resultPrint[0].innerHTML = 'Print Graph';\n        result.append(resultPrint[0].innerHTML);\n  }\n```\nOutput looks like this\n\nDo you think that would be cool to have this feature  for anyone, Nicolas ? \nCheers\nEdit: I edited the post because the previous solution wasn't working if you selected a chart, then a table, and a chart again. Updated with a similar solution, the output is the same and apparently it works great haha.\n. One could merge&minify before release, no ? But then, you'ld need to see whats better to maintain.\n.

    "LaurensRietveld": "@nicolaskruchten : not really sure this is the best place for the bug report, but I noticed two strange issues:\n- The totals column disappears in this example: http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/mps_export.html\n- when adding another row variable, the column headers are concatenated. Is this intentional?\n. Sorry about the delay!\nI think there is no -proper- way of doing this, and what table layout to use mostly depends on a persons taste. I have two main requirements:\n1. it should resemble the regular table layout as much as possible\n2. the csv should support the use in easily applying postprocessing in e.g. excel\nSo for (1) I'd opt for including the row-headers instead of concatenating these with the cell values. And for (2), I'd simply duplicate a row span value into the corresponding cells.\nBut again, this is just my personal preference, and I'm not claiming this to be -the- best approach ;)\nIt's not the prettiest solution, but I doubt there is any...\nps. Something more related to the UI part of this issue: if you share my preference for requirement (1), then it might be better to make this agnostic to the underlying data object, and generate the exported csv on the actual html table. This would make it easier to keep the CSV as consistent as possible with the regular table renderer(s). \n. My 2 cents: I'm using this in a library where the pivottable input might be URIs (see yasr.yasgui.org). I'd like to display these are href's, instead of plain text. Not sure whether this is a common use case, but  it's at least 1 more ;)\n. A document on modular javascript is here (a big read): http://addyosmani.com/writing-modular-js/ \nTo go to the situation related to this PR, then ctrl-f to 'myextension.js'.\nWhat happens is: the complete function definition of a file, is passed as paramter ('mod') to the anonymous function at the top of the file.\n- If the user has e.g. require.js loaded, then the jquery dependency is loaded via a require statement, and passed to mod.\n- If the user uses an amd module, mod is passed as callback to a define statement.\n- And if the user uses a plain environment, the global jQuery variable is passed to the mod function\nThis code is very similar to how e.g. jquery-ui (see https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/sortable.js) or codemirror (see http://codemirror.net/addon/fold/brace-fold.js)\n. And, slightly to this: are you open for a pull request where I create a package.json file, create a gulp build file to up the version to automatically up the version (in the bower file, package file, and as git tag), and publish the  library to npm?\nThis way, I can use the node package manager to include your library. And, as a bonus, we can register this library to cdnjs.com (which uses an autoupdate mechanism to update the cdn whenever a new version appears on npm)\nps. when adding gulp, it would be trivial to also add a build step which compiles the coffee files to the dist dir. might make your life a bit easier\n. @nicolaskruchten : I've fixed the indentation, and prettified the loader function a bit\n. Ah, forgot about that file, added it to the version.js gulp script.\nAn example of using NPM for client-side libraries is http://github.com/YASGUI/YASR. Here, I load all dependencies via npm, and write my library using lots of require statements. When I parse the main fail (src/entry.js) with browserify, then it bundles everything (including dependencies) in one. Advantages: it keeps the namespace clean, just a single request (contrary to e.g. require.js), and ease of use. \nIf you'd go about doing the same (would be nice to have a single js pivottable js file), then you would indeed need to declare jQuery and jQueryUI as dependencies in the npm file. Now this is not really needed\nps, In my case, the dependencies accumulate to a considerable size. Therefore I actually build 2 versions: a bundled one, including all dependencies, and a undbundled one (where the user has to provide the dependencies) \n. Excellent that it's on NPM! I've created a pull request (\nhttps://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/pull/4088) for CDNjs to include pivottable\nin their CDN as well (see cdnjs.com). This CDN witl auto-update whenever\nyou publish a new version to NPM\nAbout the push not working: I forgot to set a flag for the git push command\n(in gulp/version.js), to make sure tags are automatically pushed as well.\nTo fix, change this:\n\ngit.push('origin', 'master', function (err) {\n    if (err) throw err;\n  });\n\ninto\n\ngit.push('origin', 'master', {args: '--tags'}, function (err) {\n    if (err) throw err;\n  });\n\nOn Wed, Dec 10, 2014 at 10:24 PM, Nicolas Kruchten <notifications@github.com\n\nwrote:\nThis is pretty awesome, thanks very much :)\nOne thing though, gulp minor did everything except pushing the tag to\nGithub, which I had to do manually with git push origin v1.3.0... Any way\nto get that to be automatic?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/pull/254#issuecomment-66526592\n.\n. fyi: it's now available on CDNjs. Their search engine / API often takes a while to update, so it won't show up there. But it's available here: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/pivottable. \n. I'm in favor of using this feature, but it I guess this might cause some backwards compatibility issues right? (e.g. someone using 'x < y' as column name).\n\nps. a minor coding style nitpick/personal preference: I'd change  $(\"<table>\").attr(\"cellpadding\", 5) to $(\"<table>\", {cellpadding: 5}) (this is particularly useful with many attributes)\n.

The addition of the DOW in the default representation is particularly annoying.\nMaybe it would make sense to detect homogeneous types for a given attribute and do some of this automatically.\n. ",
    "eMaringolo": "+1 This would be perfect.\n. Another option is to make these properties specific to each attribute instead of the \"data type\".\nEach attribute would have (or not) its own \"options\" object.\nEj: define if the attribute is sumarizable, orderable (min, max), countable (can be counted, counted as different), categorizable (common/distinct values), etc.\nAnd then each aggregate function can check against this \"options object\"\nE.g. You can't sum or average two dates, but you can get MIN/MAX values for those, and also if there is a common date.\nIf wanted or needed, or just for simplicity, the datatype can be used as a convenience way of specifying a whole set of options. So Date and String are orderable and categorizable, but not sumarizable. Then the aggregate functions can check against them.\nAlso, the introduction of this \"attribute options object\" can be used the to determine whether an attribute can be used as row, column, none or both.\nRegards.\nDISCLAIMER: I just found out about PivotTable.js. But in the past I implemented similar pivot/aggregation table (not in JS), and used the above proposed solution with no shortcomings during several years. Including support for automatic attribute \"subgrouping\" (date/weeks/month, range, etc.)\n. I just sent you a pull request :)\n. ",
    "ilyaguy": "Yet another idea: derived attributes will return not only attribute label (string) but return array/object:\njavascript\n{\n  label:  \"Label of attribute\", \n  type:   \"number/string/date\", \n  format: \"int/money/percent/string/date\" \n}\nAnd aggregator/renderer will use these values to process data.. In my own aggregator I implemented format selector based on additional array.\nvar fTypes = {\n   \"Registrations\": \"#\",\n   \"Confirmations\":\"#\",\n   \"Revenue\": \"$\",\n   \"Revenue per Registration\": \"%\"\n}\nI've pass the chosen value (\"#\", \"$\", \"%\",..) through getFormat function.\nfunction getFormat(short) {\n        if (short == '%') {\n            return $.pivotUtilities.numberFormat({ digitsAfterDecimal: 2, scaler: 100, suffix: \"%\" });\n        }\n        if (short == '$') {\n            return $.pivotUtilities.numberFormat({prefix:'$'});\n        }\n        if (short == '#') {\n            return $.pivotUtilities.numberFormat({digitsAfterDecimal: 0});\n        }\n        return $.pivotUtilities.numberFormat();\n    }\nAnd in the pivot table I've got pretty formatted data.. I'm working now on the same issue.\nMy idea is to load data by portions (may be 20k rows), then init pivotUI with this array.\nSo, it means that pivottable will not reload all data every for each drag-n-drop move..

I didn't spot any cribs to hand at the time, but just realised now how flexible the input parameters to the table are ...;-)\n. The problem with greying out is if there is a very long list?\nThere is a mechanic similar to the one I suggest in OpenRefine, for example where you run separate facet filters on several columns - (facets show unique vals in a column). If you filter the data set by selecting rows based on particular facet values (eg in col 1 facet, select to only show rows with vals A and B) then the facet values shown in the other facets reflect the state of the current filtered table, not all the values from a column in the unfiltered table.\nA usability arises in that you may forget what filters you have applied, but you hint at this by italicising column names when a filter is in place.\n. Identity would simply pass all the melted or pivoted data without the application of any aggregation/groupby operators to the data?\nSo for a simple example, a user might display a dataset in either a wide form or a long form.\nWhat I'm trying to imagine is a visual editor that supports the equivalent of something like the pandas operators pivot and melt operations.\n.

    "horner": "A selectable sorting algorithm sounds nice.  Maybe even over-rideable and reversable.\nIt first uses a regexp to find ISO8601, RFC1123, .toString(), .toUTCString(), .toLocaleDateString(), etc date formats which should work in the majority of date sorting use-cases.  It has to do this because \nDate.parse() seems to be too smart allowing for implementation specific extensions.\nFrom: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse\n\nThe ECMAScript specification states: If the String does not conform to the standard format the function may fall back to any implementation\u2013specific heuristics or implementation\u2013specific parsing algorithm. Unrecognizable strings or dates containing illegal element values in ISO formatted strings shall cause Date.parse() to return NaN.\n\nYou can take a look at an overview of the algorithm here: http://www.overset.com/2008/09/01/javascript-natural-sort-algorithm-with-unicode-support/\nMy cursory testing on Chrome, Safari, and IE have worked consistently with the existing sort from http://stackoverflow.com/a/4373421/112871.\n. Yeah, I could enhance it to respect the locale i18n setting in opt to prefer M/D/Y or D/M/Y.\n. I am going to make a change to the pull request.  More extensive testing shows that the performance of this natural sort is significantly slower than the original one. The additional regex is significant.  More to come soon.\n. Ok, I figured out a solution by adding a thisOrig to the pviotUI function.\n\n    $.fn.pivotUI = (input, inputOpts, overwrite = false, locale=\"en\") ->\n        ....\n        thisOrig = this\n\nAnd then change the button callback to:\n\n   btns.append $(\"\", {type:\"button\"}).html(opts.localeStrings.yearOnly).bind \"click\", ->\n       opts.derivedAttributesMacros[c+' Year'] = $.pivotUtilities.derivers.dateFormat(c, \"%y\")\n       thisOrig.pivotUI(input,opts)\n\nIt seems to work, but I don't know if this is leaking memory in a bad way.\n. I am preparing a pull request, but before I do I wanted to make sure that the on-the-fly derivers could be persisted in the opts object for use without the UI.  Initially, I just added the functions to the opts.derivedAttributes, but the functions cannot be serialized to JSON and used later.  I changed my code it to make a new opts.derivedAttributesMacros that has a format:\n\n \"derivedAttributesMacros\": {\n    \"Create Date Day\": {\n      \"format\": \"%m-%d-%y\",\n      \"src\": \"Create Date\"\n    },\n    \"Create Date Month\": {\n      \"format\": \"%m\",\n      \"src\": \"Create Date\"\n    }\n}\n \nThen in the constructor, the code create the actually entries in derivedAttributes with the deriver functions.  I plan on making other on-the-fly derivers formats other than % based date ones.\nI am not married to the name derivedAttributesMacros.  In fact, I don't like the length for the title, but I could not think of a better one. \nDo you have a preference?  Also do you like the approach of creating another object or should we combine them into a single object with both functions and format specifiers?\n. I thing making them for each attribute (T1,T2) manually because I don't think the usual use case requires that every date be derived in all possible ways.  For example someone may want T1 (which could be a date/time) to be derived to just day (dropping time) and T2 to be by month, so rather than derive all the dates with with a single formula, I think it is better to be explicit about it, hence the \"src\" value.  \nSo:\n\n \"derivedAttributesMacros\": {\n    \"T1 Day\": {\n      \"format\": \"%m-%d-%y\",\n      \"source\": \"T1\"\n    },\n    \"T2 Month\": {\n      \"format\": \"%m\",\n      \"source\": \"T2\"\n    }\n}\n\n. The problem is persisting the opts with the functions since they cannot be serialized in JSON.\nI have a modification of http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/onrefresh.html that allows the opt object to be named and shared among several users using the same page by storing it server side.  Its very cool because it behaves like a shared filter in a google spreadsheet where one user can update the view and all users using the same named opt see the changes. \nI don't know of another way to securely share the opt between browsers using javascript.  By making a serializable derived attribute spec, it can be shared and persisted for use later.\n. Check out https://github.com/horner/pivottable/commit/71a6d7ecc57a413af5ba189c19e93989fc381859?diff=unified.  \nIt has the on-the-fly derivers.  Let me know what you think.  I can prepare a pull request if you like.\n. ok, maybe I am not explaining the use case well enough.  Without this change a end-user with data containing date columns must know javascript to analyze the results using different groupings.  \nWorse yet, a programmer would be wasteful to build a deriver for every date for every combination. For example one person may want to see dates by month, while another user may want to see data compiled by quarter.  It seems wasteful to compute both and all the time.  This gets especially worse if you have more than one date too.\nAlso, I have been leaning towards fixing the natural sort speed issue by instead allowing an on-the-fly deriver that reverses dates from MM/DD/YYYY to YYYY/MM/DD and then leaving the simpler natural sort take over.  There could also be a on-the-fly deriver to change DD/MM/YYYY to YYYY/MM/DD which would solve the problem of i18n. \nThe idea would be to declare in the opt structure that a column is a date and then pivotUI/pivot could know to re-arrage the column to work with the natural sort.  The only drawback to this approach is that I think end-users prefer to see MM/YYYY over YYYY/MM in the final column headings.\nAnyway, I hope that explains the idea better. If you have not checked it out, I can setup a jsFiddle with this code so you can see how intuitive it is to use.  Also, to see how important having these macros would be without having to resort to javascript.\n. No, there would be no need to hardcode javascript to make use of the on-the-fly deriver macros. I made a quick video demo so you could see it in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaltyHAH6gs\nTake a look.  I think it is important to note that I don't think end-users would manipulate JSON, but that a JSON object should be sharable (without javascript) to allow the pivotUI to show derived columns.\nFurthermore, I think the code that is in the \"onrefresh\" demo that removes \"bulky default values\" and \"deletes functions\" should be standardized into the pivotUI.  For example we should consider making the onRefresh function return a sanitized config, or at least provide a function in PivotUI to sanitize the object for storage and retrieval.\nLet me know what you think.\n. Whoops.  Sorry about the video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaltyHAH6gs).  I just made it public.  Also, you can play with my changes here: http://horner.github.io/pivottable/examples/onrefresh.html \nAfter playing, you might get a better idea.\n. oh, yeah... right now I detect if there is a date in the column by looking at the first value in the column (see: https://github.com/horner/pivottable/blob/dev/pivot.coffee#L634) , but that could be explicit (via another option) too.\n. Oh yeah, and honestly there are really two issues here:\n1) On-the-fly derivers for dates\n2) Storing the config for later use.  As the comment in the example onrefresh (http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/onrefresh.html) is really not possible: \"Instead of showing the configuration in a textarea, one could store the configuration in a cookie or implement a 'save configuration' feature.\"  Especially if the config has script in it.\n1) could could/should be resolved by specifying that a column is in a specific date format: MM/DD or DD/MM or other.  Or could be detected with a preference based on i18n knowledge.  This approach would also solve the natural sort problem too.  For example, if the column is known to be a date, the natural sort for that data could be biased to date, whereas the cheaper comparison could be used in all other cases.\n2) needs to be fixed with the macro approach... tho as I stated earlier, I am not happy with calling them a macro. ;-(\n. ",
    "PeteW": "If I am understanding this the derived attribute macro is to providing pivottablejs the intelligence to understand the data types and provide custom filters. If so then for situations like jupyter pivottable where I cannot/prefer not to code the filter types this would certainly empower the user to perform more powerful ad-hoc analytics.. ",
    "SamMousa": "Any reason why this has not been added yet @nicolaskruchten ?\nDoes it need additional work?\n. Yes I know, my point is that this is inefficient since it'll have to call the function for each data point instead of just for rendering the labels.\nIt'll increase memory usage and cpu usage. Wouldn't it be better to have some optional callbacks that are only called when rendering labels / values?\n. The current implementation calls the function for derived attributes a lot; this means that for a dataset of ~1000 records I see ~33.000 calls after doing ~5 drags / drop operations. \nThis probably is because pivotUI calls pivot with new settings each time, and each time the derivedAttributes are recalculated.\n. Not totally unacceptable, I'm exploring it as one solution. As well as the\nderived attribhtes option.\nCurrently the pivotData object does some caching and it calls the derived\nattributes once for each record. This is a greedy approach; this could be\nchanged to be lazy combined with memoization.\nSecond pivotUI should pass the data in a way that does not require the\nderived attributes to be reloaded. (Looking at the source the only option\nused in the PivotData constructor are the derived attributes and filter\nkeys).\nIn conclusion I'm trying to move to a good solution but prefer to spend my\ntime coding on something useful like extending this library vs coding a\nworkaround :)\nOn Nov 8, 2016 5:54 PM, \"Nicolas Kruchten\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nAgreed that it's inefficient in terms of method calls.

Interesting; currently I'm passing in an array of object (which is my source data). The data is dynamically filtered (before it enters pivot table).\nI could of course also add these extra columns as getters on the objects and hide the base attributes in pivottables.\n. I'll look into that; still doing it that way will require creating new objects which is avoidable.\n\nI'll study the source, to see if that would work for my case.. For reference, I have an array of around 25000 objects with ~ 50 properties. If I add 50 properties defineProperties` on the prototype it takes ~1 msec.

As you can see in the example in the link i shared above, it is done for a very sinple chart with hard coded data. I am lost in the code when I try to implement it here. Plus, Chartwrapper is not used in the example in the link.\nHere is a JSfiddle of what I am trying to achieve:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/asgallant/QjQNX/\nThis example uses the simple chart.draw function, while the plugin here uses chartwrapper to draw. I am unable to find where to put the addColumn as present in the example, in this plugin.\nAny help would be appreciated.\n. So far I have added the following piece of code:\nwrapper.setView({\n         columns: ([0,1,\n                        { calc: \"stringify\",\n                         sourceColumn: 1,\n                         type: \"string\",\n                         role: \"annotation\" },\n                    2,\n                    { calc: \"stringify\",\n                         sourceColumn: 2,\n                         type: \"string\",\n                         role: \"annotation\" }\n                   ])\n        });\nbefore the  wrapper.draw(result[0]); line. This gives the solution for the example file. See the image below: \n\nBut the problem is I need to know the exact number of columns for this to work. It is 2 for this chart so it is working fine, but elsewhere it might not. How can I do this dynamically?\n. ",

    "saurabhsonu": "Hi Nicolas,\nWhat I am trying to achieve is to use your pivottable.js in a responsive website. So when the website is displayed on a mobile (or the browser is sinked to mobile size), the pivot table still displays properly. For this, I was looking to adjust the table size using css for different view-port using media queries (you know it all). But this trick do not seem to work as the table size still remains the same as is displayed in standard browser size.\nFor ex-- at the top of the css file we have:\ntable.pvtTable {\n    width: 100px;\n    font-family:arial;\n    font-size: 8pt;\n    text-align: left;\n    border-collapse: collapse;\n}\nNow if I change the width to 100px or 300px or 1000px...no matter what value I provide, the table size is always the same. this exactly is my problem\nI even posted this on SA (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29802658/adding-responsiveness-to-pivottable) but it didn't fetch any answer.  I am really stuck here. Please do guide me if I am going wrong here. Your help will be highly appreciated. \n. So that means we can't even shrink the  and  size. If this is the case, I still owe you a thanks, for now I won't be looking for css fixes as earlier. But can you suggest how the size is determined by the content or is there any spot in the .js where this size can be handled. I have tried a lot to alter the js but couldn't find proper place to start for this change\n. Its clear that table size is determined by rows and cols, and for 100 rows and cols obviously the size will be large. But for small sizes, say 7 rows and 7 cols, can't we somehow reduce the table size so that it still contains 7 rows and 7 cols on a smaller scale (obviously the width of each row and col in this case will be so small that the user will have to zoom in.)\n.

Nicolas,\nOK. Thank you for sharing your overall idea on this.\n. Hi,\nIf I alter pivot.tr.js with raw Unicode character, it works. Do you want to leave it as is? Maybe change the contribution guideline and advice not to use HTML escape?\n. Understood.\n.

Please see the code in the first comment for how to get the filtered data.\n. I assume one can achieve that by filtering pivotData.tree of the cached object.\nI'm not sure which design is better for filtering of original array; inside or outside pivotTableRenderer.\nFor now my objective is met with current design, so I'm not going to change anything for now.\n.

    "ykil": "Thanks for the quick reply.  Here's a proposed workaround.  Could you let me know what you think?  \nThe idea is to wrap your pivot table function.  I would manually split the input flat table per replicate and call your pivot table and then use those pivot tables results to create averages and std.dev, per cell.\nI don't think these rendering libs provide error bar rendering.  I suppose I'll need to customize plots to accept error bars.\nExample.\nInput to \"Replicate Pivot Table\":\nsample, replicate, measure1, measure2\nA, 1, 0.5, 0.4\nA, 2, 0.6, 0.3\nA, 3, 0.4, 0.5\nB, 1, 0.2, 0.31\nB, 2, 0.3, 0.32\nB, 3, 0.1, 0.33\nThis is split into 3 flat files (in code):\n```\nsample, replicate, measure1, measure2\nA, 1, 0.5, 0.4\nB, 1, 0.2, 0.31\nsample, replicate, measure1, measure2\nA, 2, 0.6, 0.3\nB, 2, 0.3, 0.32\nsample, replicate, measure1, measure2\nA, 3, 0.4, 0.5\nB, 3, 0.1, 0.33\n```\nThen each of these three flat files are fed into the pivot table and the output is extracted out.  The three extracted out tables are then 'merged' into a single table with some new code to create averages and std.dev.\n. I've edited my previous comment.  Let me know if it clearer now. Thanks.\n. I think this will let me continue to use your user interface and pivot table algorithm.  I'm open to other suggestions if you have any.  Thanks.\n. Thanks for letting me know (just noticed there was a response).  I'll definitely look into this.  One question.    If I have two tables, is there a good way to pass the information to make plots with error bars (assuming we have such rendering plots  -- are there any?).\n. OK.  I'll think about it and let you know if I have additional solutions.\n. ",
    "declann": "Thank you for that Nicolas.\nTherefore, there is a place for both in one project.\nMy next problem is the realisation that my project ultimitely won't /fully/ scale under either of these tools! v(I can scale back in a big way - but I'm researching the ambitious plan before I give up!)\nI came to think about making PivotTable.js work with an OLAP backend as a potential solution on that end, and that could be a seperate feature request. But I went searching for alternatives. I came across something you wrote a while back - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5938744\n\"We routinely use this tool [PivotTable.js] to summarize datasets which are, at their most disaggregated, hundreds of millions of rows. We have a server-side process which rolls those up into hundreds of thousands of rows, which are then fed to the browser via a query interface which tends to send only a few thousand at a time, which is easily handled by this tool.\nEach step in this pipeline 'summarizes' to an extent, and the last mile is this interactive client-side tool, which would be less responsive if it were server-side.\"\nThis is nice.\nFair enough if your backend process is propietary, but to bring my project all the way I would need a substitute to fill my gap, something that works easily with Node. Cube [https://github.com/square/cube] built on MongoDB was a good starting point but no longer maintained. This might be a place for me to pick up, but not something practical for me in the near future.\nMondrian can work, but a bit on the convoluted side to integrate with Node.js, (and it's Java and does nothing for me right now when I try to run it - maybe my attitude here needs to change) http://highscalability.com/blog/2013/11/11/ask-hs-what-is-a-good-olap-database-choice-with-nodejs.html\nIt will take me a while to move on from any of this as I am still developing on a small scale. A lot of the information I've found from searching about this problem is very old. Do you know any other relevant starting point for what you have here? I'm surprised that/if nothing's come in to fill the gap left by Cube.\nPerhaps I will suck it up and go with querying a propietary cube from Node, if that's possible, and pumping results to PivotTable.js.\nDo you want me to setup a new issue to feature request operating with OLAP cubes? (which I can at least use to document my findings, when I look into this further myself)\n. ",

    "twolfson": "I think there might be a misunderstanding. To my knowledge, the feature (i18n) is not being reverted by this change. It's only securing that which was originally secure and became insecure.\njs\n{color: \"S\u00e9lectionner tout\", shape: \"circle\"},\n\nIf the larger scope was to allow HTML content for headings, then I would suggest an opt-in flag to add support for that. Most templating languages will escape content by default and then have a feature (e.g. {{{ for handlebars, != for Jade) that allows for outputting unescaped content.\nIn any event, \"switching from outputting text to HTML\" was released as a minor version, meaning it should be backwards compatible and equally secure. If we want to make HTML the default for input, then let's sufficiently document that and make it a major release (since it's not backwards compatible as it introduces XSS for people who were expecting escaped content).\n. Ah, that clarifies things. The git blame lead to me to believe it was exclusively for i18n\nhttps://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/blame/30f9b0187c0875344471893930afeb486418120e/pivot.coffee#L489\nAs mentioned, I would consider \"sufficient documentation\" being something overwhelming apparent to developers. I suggest doing:\n- Move back 1.x to being text-only for backwards compatibility and assumed security consistency\n- Release 2.0.0 for HTML support\n- Add a large heading on the README indicating the breaking change\n  - Here's an example: https://github.com/npm/redsess/tree/v1.0.0#breaking-changes-in-100\n  - Here's another example: https://github.com/Ensighten/grunt-spritesmith/tree/5.2.0#breaking-changes-in-300\n. That can be supported by using innerText for IE8 (or jQuery which does the right thing for both).\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533899%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\nThis PR was using textContent since those were in the initial versions:\nhttps://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/commit/8b11f193911b90f89f467a602280403c034445e6#diff-3ee584b4d3dc284183244de71c687ba4L687\nLet me know if you want me to update the logic to support IE8.\n. As mentioned earlier, one option would be to set up an opt-in flag (e.g. via an option) to tell PivotTable to render as HTML. A few possible setups for this would be:\n- Define a \"text\" renderer function and a \"html\" renderer function. Tell users to pass in \"html\" renderer if they want HTML support (otherwise, default to \"text\")\n- Add another parameter to the render functions (e.g. options) which we can detect options.useHtml from\n  - We would probably want to avoid a global flag since that would affect all scenarios whereas users might want a one-off table to use text and another to use HTML\n. That works too. We will probably want to use a list of entities from another repo to make sure we cover all cases (e.g. someone terminates an element's attribute via quotes or a slash):\nhttps://github.com/janl/mustache.js/blob/v2.2.0/mustache.js#L60-L67\n. One of the most frequent mistakes in security is assuming vulnerabilities don't exist because we can't think of them. Here's an example XSS game to disprove your assumptions:\nhttps://xss-game.appspot.com/\nAside from that, not escaping an ampersand will lead to issues since &lt; would render as < (&lt;) when someone might intend to render `&lt; (&amp;lt;).\nSo please, don't assume anything and use trusted/known solutions.\n. Sorry if I came off as condescending. For me, it's mostly a concern of trading one security issue for another x_x\n. I think that will work for most users.\nWe might still need to do escaping in re:dash since in schema-less databases, ignorant developers could get XSS column names but that's definitely in the edge case category.\nAs a side note, doesn't look like the docs say anything about content being text or HTML (only strings). They should prob be updated appropriately.\nThanks for your work on this.\n. Ah, sorry. I misinterpretted some code -- for some reason I assumed we were keeping HTML support for things like the triangle/circle HTML. Going to close this PR now.\nWith respect to locales, what was the reason for keeping them as HTML?\n. Ah, I see. The issue you are experiencing is Python 2.7 replies in ASCII, not UTF-8. If you switch to another hosting tool (e.g. serve), then it goes back to working. Here's a proof of concept:\nSame commit: https://github.com/underdogio/pivottable/commit/6dcc492355da2ef17369164372da97573b4d3e92\nWith python2.7 -m SimpleHTTPServer, response body has A(c) -- nothing to do with page/script itself:\n\nWith serve -p 8000, response body has e as expected -- page/script use appropriate content:\n\n.

Figured out that webjars for bower are autogenerated, so this issue is not related to pivottable themself.\nIf you encounter with this problem - just use work-around.\n. Looks related to #451. It would be great if config prepared by pivotUI can be used as is for pivot(). \n. I see. I work-arounded that by this: https://github.com/OrienteerDW/Orienteer/blob/master/orienteer-pivottable/src/main/resources/org/orienteer/pivottable/component/pivottable.tmpl.js\nI understand that you want to keep functionality wide, but from user perspective it might look strange, because pivotUI() can be used as editor for configuration which then should be used by pivot().\nExample of usage: http://demo.orienteer.org/browse/DemoPivotTable\nJust click small cogwheel on right-top side. \n. Yes. That's right. But it's pretty common for rest json just skip field.\nSo we at Orienteer will be happy if either this input can be valid or library will allow to specify explicit set of fields. And, btw, if it will allow to specify more human readable(localized for example) names for fields from json - that will be perfect!\nThanks for such brilliant library!\n. Welcome! So: are you saying that it's ok that pivot() renders a data, but pivotUI() doesn't for the same data? If data is wrong, pivot() should fail as well. From my perspective there is some issue about that just in pivotUI() code. \nAccording to source code\nit should be easy to fix. I'm not expert of Coffee, but, please, take a look:\n``` cofee\ntblCols = (k for own k of input[0])\ntblCols.push c for own c of opts.derivedAttributes when (c not in tblCols)\nfigure out the cardinality and some stats\naxisValues = {}\naxisValues[x] = {} for x in tblCols\nPivotData.forEachRecord input, opts.derivedAttributes, (record) ->\nfor own k, v of record when opts.filter(record)\n        v ?= \"null\"\n        axisValues[k][v] ?= 0  # LINE A\n        axisValues[k][v]++\n```\nError is happining at line A, because axisValues doesn't have value for key \"k\".\nProbably something like the following should be added just before LINE A\n(sorry for javascript!)\njavascript\nif(!axisValues[k]) {\n   tblCols.push(k);\n   axisValues[k] = {};\n}\n. I would expect that 'c' will be added into output.\nOriginal problem is that REST/JSON databases can omit some data if it's null. For example that's the case for OrientDB. So first row might have not all required columns.\nAnd there I see 2 options:\n1) Library will adjust automatically set of columns during going through data and finding new columns (preferred option)\n2) Or library can allow to specify set of columns which should be used (good option, but it will be nice to have it in addition to p.1)\n. Thanks! The point is that sometimes there is no way to influence to a way how data returned by some DB. So to insure that first column has everything might be problematic.\n. @nicolaskruchten , PR looks good for me!:) Thank you!. After research I figured out a reason: configuration was prepared under one locale, but then tried to be used under another. Unfortunatly library is storing names localized - so it can't find it next time.\nIs there some way to make configuration locale agnostic?\nAlso, as I can see pivot() is not recieving locale as an input parameter. Would be perfect to have it a long with pivotUI()\n. Regarding 'a' and absence of ability to localize it. I think, it's real use case - even for single language. For example JSON might be optimized for size: so all field names a short, but in UI it might be needed to have longer version of a field. According to code: it shouldn't be hard: just to allow specify function for translation from 'a' to 'My Long Property A Name' or if function is not a case just JS object with key-values for field names.\nRegarding locale agnostic. Use case is the following. I'm working on http://orienteer.org/. Project is using you brilliant library for showing pivottable. See demo: http://demo.orienteer.org/\n- pivot() is used for showing pivot: http://demo.orienteer.org/browse/DemoPivotTable\n- pivotUI() is used for configuration: try click gears on link above\nSo pivotUI() prepare configuration which than can be used by pivot()\nAnd main problem is that configuration after pivotUI() does contain localized data: aggregatorName and rendererName which if being used \"as-is\" in pivot() lead to problems.\nI have already worked out the situation by the following code: https://github.com/OrienteerDW/Orienteer/blob/master/orienteer-pivottable/src/main/resources/org/orienteer/pivottable/component/pivottable.tmpl.js\nBut that looks rather bad hack and I think it will be quite useful to have that reworked in the library themself.\n. Transforming of names by hiddenAttributes/deliveredAttributes or by preprocessing is quite huge overhead. If you don't mind, I can prepare Pull  Request which will introduce new parameter to configuration: function for field names translation. By default it will use identical transformation. Are you OK with this proposal?\nThe problem with my implementation is in fact that it fully relly on order of items in localizations. That might be broken some day. But i didn't find other way how to link together different aggregators from different locales.\n. That's sad. I'm 100% sure that I'm not alone: that should be quite common case. Lets do the following: I will create a new issue and if it will be needed for 5 people - that will be a sign:) \n. Done: issue #492.  \nJust to close this issue. What do you think about this my statement?\n\nThe problem with my implementation is in fact that it fully relly on order of items in localizations. That might be broken some day. But i didn't find other way how to link together different aggregators from different locales.\n\nDo you see any better way to translate from one language to another without relaying to order?\n. > At this point I consider this library to be fairly mature and stable, so while it may be possible to evolve the architecture to meet your needs, I'm reluctant to rock the boat very much in a way which would require me to re-work documentation, examples etc.\nI do agree with you. But problem is that with matureness there are quite limited set of extension points... And according to number of different forks here, people prefer to have their own version with exclusive feature which is needed for them. Please consider some ways to consolidate those huge number of different forks: imho some extention points in configuration might help a lot. \n. ",

This allows you to use the wrapper as component anywhere...mine is setup to allow dynamic columns, etc and handle changing of meta and data to re-render.

    "brylie": "Out of curiosity, what do you get when you console.log(this)?\n. Does the value function provide any arguments that you can catch?\n. OK, hm. I am trying to find the documentation.\n. The docs saty:\n\nAggregator functions receive 3 parameters: a PivotData object, a rowKey and a colKey\n\nCan you use the row key to access the row from the data object in the parent scope?\n. I.e. you might catch all three parameters as described, and do something like data[rowKey][colKey] from within the value function.\n. Hm, right. Seems contrary to the documentation.\n. Ah, make sure you are passing in the attribute array.\n. You also might need to pass in the data, rowKey, and colKey arguments to the return function.\n. js\nvar successRate = function(attributeArray) {\n  var attribute = attributeArray[0];\n  return function(data, rowKey, colKey) { // These arguments may be necessary\n    return {\n      sumSuccesses: 0,\n      sumTrials: 0,\n      push: function(record) {\n        if (!isNaN(parseFloat(record.successes))) {\n          this.sumSuccesses += parseFloat(record.successes);\n        }\n        if (!isNaN(parseFloat(record[denom]))) {\n          return this.sumTrials += parseFloat(record.trials);\n        }\n      },\n      value: function (data, rowKey, colKey) { // remember to handle them here too\n        return this.sumSuccesses / this.sumTrials; \n      },\n      format: function(x) { return x; },\n      numInputs: 0\n    };\n  };\n};\n.

I think the function def would look like:\n\nvar countUnique = function(attributeArray) {\n  var attribute = attributeArray[0];\n  return function(data, rowKey, colKey) {\n    return {\n      uniq: [],\n      push: function(record) {\n        var _ref;\n        if (_ref = record[attribute], __indexOf.call(this.uniq, _ref) < 0) {\n          this.uniq.push(record[attribute]);\n        }\n      },\n      value: function() { return this.uniq.length; },\n      format: function(x) { return x; },\n      numInputs: 1\n    };\n  };\n}\n\nbut as you can see the value function still doesn't get passed those vars :-(\n. Sorry I don't understand.\n. Could you show an example ?\n. Thanks !\n. Bah rowKey and colKey are empty arrays !\n. Ah it's because I'm adding them as a closure so those vars only reference the on startup...\n. Yeah :-( looks like there is no way to find anything about the current record you are on when creating an aggregator function :-(.\n. @philliproso Just tried this and I get:\nCannot read property 'getColKeys' of undefined.\n. But then they don't get updated.\n. What I mean is these values:\nrowKey, colKey\nare always empty arrays regardless of if I use a closure or not.\n. Can you show an example? I'm always getting empty array.\n. Thank you for the help. I've managed to create my calculation without needing access to the current cell so I'll just leave it as is. Maybe just close this issue now.\n. Closing.,\n. Ok thanks I see this now :-).\n. ",

You can try it online here. These extensions have fully-functional free \"community\" version that can be used in commercial projects.\n@nicolaskruchten unfortunately I cannot share fixed headers code and make it open-source because it was developed under commercial conditions. Nevertheless, I think it is better to have at least some alternative with NReco extensions than nothing.\n. @RTIG you can try new NReco extensions version which 'fixed headers' function should work fine with subtotal.js plugin (special example is provided).\nAlso, in new version fixed headers use 'position:sticky' if possible (all modern browsers support it) which gives much better user experience and true smooth scrolling.. > Unfortunately my users can do pretty much anything with the fields.\nIn this case pure js-only pivot table solution is not suitable for you... the problem of large pivot table can be solved with server-side pagination (or reasonable top-N limits for rows/columns) but you need some backend for this. \nSeveral years ago we also started with pivottable.js but found a lot of limitations related to dataset size - they come from the fact that all data and rendering are performed on the client-side. As result we created alternative solution that can be used for pivot tables generation even for big data (with ROLAP approach): PivotData microservice - this is .NET Core app + js front-end plugins..

Hi, sorry for the late answer.\nIndeed the best would be to be able to return all matching records for the selected cell, but since this isn't already in memory, it might have really bloated the footprint.

    "ajaneesh": "I sorted out this issue with a slightly different approach.  i removed $compile and created some indirection.. instead of ng-click i simply called onclick and forward request to controller using a scope handle.. \n. I'll try this .  Thanks\n. Want to hide row based on aggregated value .  Let's say I have three fields , Dept , employee name, gender.  I'll use Dept as my row and gender as my column which will give me count of males and females against each Dept\nFrom this result I want to filter down the table by some aggregated outcome.  As a HR I want to list out only Depts that have zero count of women. or any other specific value , say Depts with exactly 5 women.  And I also want to know male headcount of such Depts.  It's almost as if, I first render the pivot table and then do a second run and knock of certain rows based on what I see such that I can deal with a much smaller aggregated result that is of concern to me.\n. And I really appreciate your follow-up on this!  What you have developed is a wonderful thing.  It made my life so much easier.  Very impressed .  Thanks.\n. I have achieved this as you described. But I could not achieve this by manipulating the rendered table because in my case there are actually multiple row fields and not just one , which means they go through grouping and consequently row spanning.  My initial idea was to simply delete  s but rowspanning makes this an impossible task.  So what I've has to do is use simple jquery to get me a list of Dept ids that I don't want using a filter on tr.col0.text() === 'soemthing' and get the id to be removed using .prev().text().  I then actually make a new dataset with this is array and rerender with this new dataset. So Im not able to accomplish this without either discarding or losing required data or replicating and consuming more browser memory.  Just letting you know how I went about this.  Not complaining...\n. Sorry, smartphone keyboard is messing up things a bit but I have more to add.   My first attempt at second pass was to simply use exclusions.  That did not work somehow.  What I noticed is that, that particular field's filtering pop-up does not allow filtering and says list is too big to be displayed and I was wondering if somehow the lack of foreground filtering also blocks background filtering.  That they are somehow tied up.  Hope that was clear\n. ",

Any suggestion on how to get at the filtered data? I have hacked something together stuffing the records into PivotData.tree, but I think I am probably not doing it very efficiently.\n. ah OK, you still have the original array in scope, I wasn't storing that separately, but that will work. I was hoping to get it from the internal cache of the input of the pivotdata.\n. pivotData.tree isn't the full dataset, it is the results of the aggregation, and as an object it doesn't have a filter without copying it to an array. Not sure that the input array is publicly exposed by pivotData. This is fine though, as long as I know to keep the original around.\n. I think I mean attribute values rather than attributes.

Hello guy's,\nI'had to work on an similar issue... \nIn my case, the final user has to deal with several data set\nWhen then user logs in, for each data set he has subscribed to, i run an asynchronous ajax request\nthat stores the result of the sql query in php session.\nDuring this asynchronous request, the front end shows a progressbar ( Loaded 1 of X...).\nWhen finished, you can easily reload the full page without doing any other request on the database.\nYour pivot table should easily deal with the 200k rows that are stored in the php session. \n. @datnguyen0606 Sure, but assume data has been loaded in php session.\nRender the page on the server side does'nt meen you can't unset the session variable on the server side after it has been sent to client side.\nFirst:\nWhile loading data into php session variable\n//SQLRequest\n// $_SESSION['dataset']=SQLResult json formatted\ndisplay loading progress!\nOn loaded\nRedirect user to the following page:\n```\n<?php\nsession_start();\n//if you don't use any template engine\necho '\n[...]\n\n\n$(function(){\n        var derivers = $.pivotUtilities.derivers;\n            $(\"#output\").pivotUI('.$_SESSION['dataset'].',\n                //your pivotUI params here\n            });\n        });\n     });\n\n\n';\n//FINALLY unset the session variable which is already written!\nunset($_SESSION['dataset']);\n?>\n```. Peform pivot on the server side is not a good idea.  Anytime the final user wants to change rows or cols in the table,  he will have to reload the dataset or the pivot result. \nActually the data in pivotui is already stored on the client side.  I think you are just looking for the best way to get them as fast as possible from the server..\n1st.  you need to optimize your request !  if you are using mysql you can try to use a ramdisk...\n2nd. Use Ajax asynchronously to perform your request, you don t really need php sessions . This way you won t get any javascript timeout . ",

    "frankernesto87": "Hi again nicolas!!\nI'm facing a new problem with save and load state from pivotui , I'm saving pivot conf to DB, but when I try to restore it I'm getting this:\n \"pivot.coffee:932 Uncaught TypeError: D.aggregators[u.val(...)] is not a function\n    at pivot.coffee:932 (anonymous) @ pivot.coffee:932\". \nMy conf loads unused fields and rows , but is not able to load the data table, renderers and aggregators.

Hi Nicolas\nfinally I've managed to export to excell and very hardly way to pdf,\nanyway your help has been very usefull, now I have another question.\nIs it possible to remove sorting of pivot table??\nIt alows alphabethical and it's reverse by 'keys_a_to_z,\nvalue_a_to_z......' but I'm looking for showing the data as it comes\nfrom a certain source. I also managed to paginate the pivot , and it\nshows the data ok in each page, but my way to export excell is with\nall the data, so the pivot applies the alphabethical order and the\nresult is quite different. Any tips??\nThanks a lot,\nRegards Frank\n2017-06-15 2:57 GMT-05:00, nithishanf notifications@github.com:\n\nHi @frankernesto87 , I tried Export to excel and it is working even for\nlarge data.

You can provide your own\nsorting functions on a global or per-attribute basis, though, so you can\ncontrol the order beyond just up or down.

Thanks nicolas, now it works, but I have a new issue,\nI was trying to save config after loading my pivot via a previous config\njson, I'm using subtotals renderer .\nIf I load pivot normally, without a loaded config , subtotals works, but If\nload it by a config , I get this error (attached pic), It only happends\nwith subtotals, the rest of then are ok.\n\nThis is how I'm building my config:\nvar renderers = $.extend($.pivotUtilities.renderers,\n$.pivotUtilities.c3_renderers, $.pivotUtilities.subtotal_renderers);\nvar aggs = $.pivotUtilities.aggregators.Cuenta;\nconf_pivot = JSON.parse(conf_pivot);\nconf_pivot[\"renderers\"] = renderers;\nconf_pivot[\"aggregators\"] = aggs;\nconf_pivot.rendererOptions = {\n    rowSubtotalDisplay: {\n        disableExpandCollapse: true\n    },\n    colSubtotalDisplay: {\n        disableExpandCollapse: true\n    }\n};\nconf_pivot.onRefresh = saveState;\n$('#pivot').pivotUI(origin_data, conf_pivot, true, 'es');\nThanks a lot\n2017-08-31 11:26 GMT-05:00 Nicolas Kruchten notifications@github.com:\n\nYes, the default aggregators are available at $.pivotUtilities.aggregators\n.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/issues/746#issuecomment-326349818,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AbaHAi451dOL-z9zSD7s0S3GwstNfkkPks5sdt6mgaJpZM4Oc0-P\n.\n.

Its faster than using push functionality which you provided. \nWhat i need is:\n1. When i do the datalib crunch, i need to reduce filtered values so values are correctly calculated\nDevelopment env: Angular 2 and typescript . This is the \nGist of code\nAs you can see i don't do anything in push function. I just crunch entire data at once. And in value i just retrieve the value from already crunched data. But when filter are used i don't have any method of knowing what filter are used. I Forked a version of lib to get the exclusions from jquery.

What exactly was the usability problem?\nIf we really want to leave things how they are right now, we must totally reconsider positioning of drop-downs. They must never overlap each other, but also not the pivat table itself. So in case a first drop-down menu is opened, this would first shift the pivot table down by the high of the drop-down menu. The second opened drop-down menu would be positioned next to the first opened menu (to not overlap it), the third menu next to the second one and so on. First after closing all drop-down menus the pivot table would move back upwards by the height of a drop-down menu.. >You're coming on a bit strong here with \"we must totally reconsider\" etc :)\nYep, that's just my attempt to counterbalance the experience I had with drop-downs.\n\nit's been working fine for the majority of folks\n\nThat's good news, no doubt. But it doesn't say anything about their satisfaction with the UI :wink:.\nAnyway, I'm really interested in all the specific reasons for deliberately skipping every single feature out of those three I proposed in the initial comment. I'd like to thoroughly understand the workflows others employ to get me to the same level of knowledge (and consequently to the level of discussion) as you have. For me the current drop-downs behavior is a major drawback.. > What do people think of these features?\nI've tried it right now and they look handy, but they're not much much useful compared to making filter dialogs/windows auto-close.

Is there any way to replace the numbers with the the severity keys for viewing only (ie replace -1 => high)?. My thoughts exactly :) I will try to look it on the weekend. Any hints or warnings?. Finally had time to prepare a proper PR :) Here is my take on the second approach we discussed. Instead of rewriting the entire table renderer I've added two functions to the rendererOptions to handle cell content rendering. I've used those to solve the original and also to include icons and custom markup to the main data. I've struggled with this decision myself. I appreciate the separation of concerns of the layered renderers. But in the end, I was frequently writing encoded \"hints\" to the cells just remove and translate then to the good stuff in the next step. It felt inefficient and it was harder to reason about. Particularly when you start doing \"fancy stuff\" with aggregators and labels, using plain text to bridge the communication with the renderers was a pita.\nI believe that the concept is easy enough to explain, its basically a hook to the last mile of the table renderer and the cell renderers are just functions to map some context to an html element. As soon as I figure out how to make contributions to the wiki I could write a couple of paragraphs explaining the feature.. I believe that it would be possible to do this using a cell renderer.

And other stuff works ok, so if you can point me to the line numbers where I can simply try to debug this, I would greatly appreciate this!\n. It seems to me I found where the problem is. I will refer to the pivot.js (not the coffeescript).\nIn the $.fn.pivot definition (line 1161) you recursively extend the object:\nopts = $.extend(true, {}, localeDefaults, $.extend({}, defaults, inputOpts));\nWhich means, that all the array objects acquire the properties of their prototypes, defined in the native.forms.array.js file.\nThus, the arrays opts.cols and opts.rows contain such properties/functions as associate, contains, extend etc.\nLater on in the pivotTableRenderer function (line 985) you loop through the properties of the above mentioned objects, checking if they have or do not have the properties of their prototypes.\nfor (j in colAttrs) {\n        if (!hasProp.call(colAttrs, j)) continue;\n      ...\n      }\nAnd obviously, apart from array items, they have these properties/functions. The second line of code does not skip them.\nNow, my question is the following:\nCan you give any comments if I can simply do the following check\nif (typeof(colAttrs[j]) === 'function') continue;\nin the place, where you iterate through rows and columns attributes?\nI tried and it worked for me but only for a very simple dataset.

I would be grateful if you can post an example script. \nMeanwhile, here is my workaround - which I guess is not a professional work. \nStep 1: I wrote php to generate a json where time_spent is in Time-to-Seconds format (in other words, numbers). \nStep 2: html (note that i am hiding output initially so your script runs in background and shows only changed format after i click a button. \n<button class=\"convert\">Convert Seconds to Time</button>\n        <div id=\"output\" style=\"margin: 30px; display:none;\"></div>\nStep 3: script where I am calling my script on button click because I couldn't hook my functions after your function is executed.

    "gomedya": "Nicolas hi, Thanks for quick answer. Count as fraction of total does work, but I don't know how to handle multiple answers per question. An example sheet can be seen at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15OVjxsoPVZqWm49R-VpSMBInRDi_J03VI1CU9__PmQs/edit?usp=sharing\nThanks.\n. sure, in the mps example, one person can have one name, party, province, age, gender.. suppose there is a  \"hobby\" question and one person can give more than one answer, such as reading, swimming, etc. in the google docs example, people are asked what fruits they like and what hobbies they have, both multiple choice questions. you can see \"hobby\" answers as column headers, and \"fruit\" answers as row headers. because people can change more than one answer, results can be more than the number of people and percentages greater than 100%.. this is how my customers expect results, total of 4 answers from 3 people/subjects resulting %133. spreadsheet is correct. i don't know if this way of calculating percentages has any value in general statistics crowd, but surveys are calculated and presented this way in turkey. going back to original question, how can we have multiple answers per column/question? . ok, thanks. :). ok, thanks.

    "01": "If I am not mistaken, since total column and row is aggregated by the pivotJS library and export_renderer simply takes the the data outputs it as a TSV given data given the aggregator. Its a simple fix if you look at the export_renderer.js while its looping through rows or columns keep sum, and at end of loop push it row/column respectively. . Nicolas, I would imagine why you wouldn't do that as they are not data points and are simply aggregations of the whole. When exporting it trying to use that data for graphing/charting or even feeding it back into Pivot library would mess up the data as no way to distinguish it as a summation and not a data point. \n. Thanks, worked great. However did not work with calling just pivot.  Required calling pivotUI. Due to differences in how pivot() and pivotUI() work it does not seem calling pivot with export_renders[\"TSV Export\"] as the renderer works. . Edit: I see I tried having renderers with one render option which doesnt make sense for pivot(). And... i figured it out. Needed the function before parsing as a JSON using the config, config_copy example. I added subopts.renderer to the pivotUIOptions in pivot.js so that it was available... In case anyone was looking to accomplish same functionality.\nEdit: Or.... just use CSS..... ",

    "beny8503": "I was trying to do it right there but is like when the onRefresh executes, the html code of the data table is still loading or something. I'm saying this based on the expected funcionality of the DataTables plugin wich is suposed to take the html table and make the necesary changes. Perhaps I really don't underestand the onRefresh option. Also, I'm using the onRefresh to change the style of the pivot to bootstrap, something like NReco does.. It's not what I'm seeing it's more like what I'm not seeing. Here is the thing, I'm loading a json data into the pivot, it has about 2000 records and could be more, so far could be 30 thousand and more(it also has about 17 columns), but I'm testing with 2000. When the pivot load the first time, the area of the data table remains blank for e few seconds or maybe less, and them the table shows. The problem is that is too big for the screen in my page, so I want to make it on a smaller layout like 600px height with scroll bars, that's why I told you about DataTables jQuery plugin. So, the onRefresh callback, when exactly it gets triggered?, is there something like a state of the pivot to know when it is completely showed in the screen?. I did what you said, the result was that the alert shows before the data table (table.pvtTable). \n\nHere you can see what I'm saying\n. Mmmm, honestly I don\u00b4t know, let me do some test and I keep you posted, I'll also try a diferent aproach, but it will imply the use of a third library different from DataTables (Clusterize and Fixed-Header-Table). Here is what I did, I put this code: if ($('table.pvtTable').length)\n                    alert(\"the table exist\");\n                else\n                    alert(\"the table does'nt exist\"); in the onRefresh callback an this is what I get: \n\n. I realize that, so I'm  trying the other solution I commented earlier. I also have another problem. it's not about this subject but here it goes: I'm trying to reduce the renderers list that are shown in the renderers select and make then appear in spanish. I already include the pivot.es.js file loading after the pivot.min.js file and the result is that the renderers' list does'nt change at all and the aggregators list change to spanish without problems. Before you answer the previous question, I managed to change the elements on the renderers' list, my bad. But stil they does'nt show in spanish, also, how can I do to change the elements in the aggregators list?\nBy the way, thanks very much for your attention, I'm very satisfied with the support. Oh I see, I followed your recomendation and I succesfully populate both list in spanish with the desired elements. Are you interested on knowing about my progress in the integration of the libraries I've mentioned earlier?. ",
    "hkbeer": "Yes I found I can style it directly in pivot.css\nGreat thing you have created. Very Impressive indeed. How to mark this question as answered ?. Looking at screen shot. The most likely reason is it pulls value fields to the left column as row fields. Please draw it the other way. You may try Select Sum instead of count, and select Transaction Value. One way to solve it is to hide the value fields from the drop-area. \"What I am trying now is to connect to a report server and show data directly from servers. So the data can be very large. And user can be very playful with columns. Is there any work around to visualize data in smaller chunks?\"\nSince you have server code control, you may narrow down the data on server side before rendering or passing to PivotUi. So you may aggregate the data first using SQL etc before pulling the data into the pivotUi. This is also what I am doing now :-). Yes this is great. Thanks... making it even more perfect now.. Thanks. I noticed this. The hardship I am facing is the data keeps changing so I cannot hard code all names in the sort code. Can I do wildcard like sorters {\"A\", \"a\" etc} ?. Thanks a lot to inform this is doable. Great... So sorry, how to \"just wrap the builtin default \"\nDo you have the fuller code of where I should put this code ? \n$(\"#output\").pivotUI(parsed.data, { sorters: { function(a,b){ \n    return $.pivotUtilities.naturalSort( (\"\"+a).toLowerCase(), (\"\"+b).toLowerCase() ); \n}}\nis this correct ? and what  \"\"+a is doing ? Do I need to further customize ? Pls help with more guide. Really appreciate this.. Thanks a million on this.. I have other sorters in place before so I tried this. Those with lower case like abc still displayed at the bottom after Xmen etc. dunno why it does not work...pls help to modify... thanks\nsorters: {\n                            \"MonthName\": sortAs([\"Jan\", \"Feb\", \"Mar\", \"Apr\", \"May\",\n                                \"Jun\", \"Jul\", \"Aug\", \"Sep\", \"Oct\", \"Nov\", \"Dec\"]),\n                            \"WeekDayName\": sortAs([\"Mon\", \"Tue\", \"Wed\", \"Thu\", \"Fri\",\n                                \"Sat\", \"Sun\", \"No detail\"]),  function() {\n                                return function (a, b) {\n                                    return $.pivotUtilities.naturalSort((\"\" + a).toLowerCase(), (\"\" + b).toLowerCase());\n                                };\n                            }`. I just tried only the following still those lower cases falls to the bottom...\n$(\"#output\").pivotUI(parsed.data, {\n sorters: {\n                        function() {\n                            return function (a, b) {\n                                return $.pivotUtilities.naturalSort((\"\" + a).toLowerCase(), (\"\" + b).toLowerCase());\n\n                            };. Thanks a lot. I tried to uncheck the box and watch the code on the left. I found we have to enter in BOTH inclusives and exclusives ... but the data keeps adding A40, A41, A42 etc. meaning I have to go to modify my code and add items each time the data has new Names ?\n\nIs there way to ALWAYS Exclude all and then include fixed A17, A25 and A31 so I do not need to modify the code each time data adding new Names ? Please help.... thanks. Thanks. How to do \"Exclude .\" first so the other would go away ?. Thanks. How to exclude ALL first ? As these values keep adding new values.. I cannot hard code the code each time. What can I do ? Thanks. OK I close it first... I will test it later.\nThanks. Thank you. So how should I arrange given Country, Product and Revenue($) ?\n. So sorry. Becoz I found solution of the original one be4 any reply and then a new help need comes up.  From now on I will not change the title and will start a new one for another request. I m new to Github so dunno much of its workflow be4 now. \nThanks. I now pull 2 numeric fields to x y and it works. Thanks. Thanks a million.... really appreciate it. I am impressed you are able to achieve this far...\nI found this section in js:-\nderivers = {\n      bin: function(col, binWidth) {\n        return function(record) {\n          return record[col] - record[col] % binWidth;\n        };\nSo is it I append like this ?\n```\nderivers = { bin: function(col, binWidth) {        return function(record) {\n          return record[col] - record[col] % binWidth;\ncalculatedField: function (firstColumn, secondColumn) {\n                return function (record) {\n                    return (record[firstColumn] / record[secondColumn]) *100;\n                };        };\n```\non page script, \nvar customDeriverMap = {};\ncustomDeriverMap[calculatedFieldName] = derivers.calculatedField(Cost, Revenue);\n$(\"#output\").pivotUI( pivotFormat, { derivedAttributes: customDeriverMap },true);\nIs this correct ? I am wondering [calculatedFieldName] in my case is what ? Do I need to change it to [CostPcT] ?\nReally appreciate your contributions..Thanks. Yes Sum Over Sum works ! Previously I dunno what is that and now I know.\nThis tool rocks ! \nThanks both of you.\nPlease close this post.\n. I tried using csv and the order output without sort option is \nAb, aA, aa, ab\nHowever if use sortAs option like yours, I get the strange unexpected order as you ended up. \nI will take a look at the source code to see if I could find something.... I suspect it is those -1, 1 in source code that make the order like this. I will try to continue to study.. Great . What is your fix ? anywhere I can see it in action ?  :) \nWould that make abc come in front of BCD easier in sorting (ie ignore case)\n. the naturalSort.... it is minor at the moment, but if you could think of way to order without care of case in future pls add as an option :-)\n. In sortAs does it accept wild cat like \u201ca\u201d* etc?. I now resort on having a custom sorting table rendered and use it as SortAs parameter in run-time to solve my ordering. So I am good now. This way I can modify the sorting of my whatever wish using SQL.\nThanks :-). I think there is an option to convert dates into month, year as I am using it....\nPlease try\nderivedAttributes: {\n                                \"MonthName\": dateFormat(\"Date\", \"%n\", true),\n                                \"YearName\": dateFormat(\"Date\", \"%y\", true)\n                            }\n. yes as nicolas said we can customise. Quarter is easiler as %n is already giving us months... quarter can be derived from months so can be handled within pivot.js by adding If then.... \nFor more complex case need to goto Moment.js.. Ok I found I need to do it in renderer and map. I added several and still exploring...may need to read c3 documentation...\nSeems no bubble chart in C3 we can add ?. Sorry for unknown reason Github is not displaying < > code... I have replaced them with [ ] Pls look at #1 again... my need is immediately  after user make choice of html selection choice, it refreshes the PivotUI...\nPls help... I found a way to do it. Wrap it as a function and give it a name eg function (Something) { }\nThen Something () does the job. Thanks. So sorry pls close this post. I found I did not download the new js.\nNow it works. This tool is perfect. Thanks . I found this is due to too many unavailable fields so the box at the top does not have enough space so it smartly move to the left panel. Great tool. No issue here. Thanks\n. Thanks for the information.\n. I have read the wiki already. What I need is to REMOVE some items from it (sorry I just found I have typo in my 1st message  so my aim to remove some items was not clear in 1st message, have now amended now)...\nWhat I am doing now is to remove those items from .js file but it is not a good way since I may need them in another html/page.\nI am wondering if there could be an option/switch to \"turn on/off\" just like what\nhiddenFromAggregators & hiddenFromDragDrop do...\nie, any hiddenFromAggregator would be nice....\nThanks. Thanks. \nMy current code is\n  var aggregators = $.pivotUtilities.aggregators;\naggregatorName: \"Integer Sum\"\nHow to modify such that [Integer Sum] is the only choice in the box ?\nI tried many ways still fail. Pls help... thanks. Yes I read the js and found \"Integer Sum\": tpl.sum(usFmtInt),\nIn Wiki\naggregators | object of functions | (common aggregators)\nI just dunno how to adjust this line\nvar aggregators = $.pivotUtilities.aggregators;\nI tried var aggregators = \"sum\" \nor  var aggregators = \"tpl.sum(usFmtInt),\" etc  \nit does not work...\n. It works. Thanks. I dunno it can be used this way. I will study more.\n. I have same need on sorting based on hidden field (eg ID of something).\nYes I am hard coding sorting like the example in this link.\nBut it is not an ideal situation as the items keep adding...\nDunno if anyone comes up with a better solution to this case.... One way I can think of is to render a separate table with 2 columns, ID and display field, order by ID. then extract dispay field one by one and separated by commas, and then use in sortAs. I will try this way later. . This way works. Just in case you need it, my code is\n  var sortdata = [];\n                $('#table1 > tbody > tr > td').each(function (index, value) {\n                    sortdata.push($(value).text());\n                });\n            . Pls close the post if you have no further comments :-). OK Thanks. It would be nice if ENTER key = click \"Apply\" button\nand\npressing ESC key = click \"Cancel\" button. hello Dave\nWould you mind posting the code to use google chart ? I am using table on html as data source. Thanks. OK Thanks. OK I will try that path, thank you.\n. OK must be some other wrong with my other external js using on the same page. I will investigate further. I can code it either a string or array, depending which one is easier/would work.. thanks. Thanks. would you mind posting a sample code ?\n. Great I achieved what I want using this intermediate step, \nthanks :-)\n. Thanks, it is :-)\nI already asked on the forum and the people \nare saying need to refer to the js as behaviour is different depending on the call back.\nFor example they said window.open may not work if the flow is not a direct user click.\nI tried window.open replacing alert above and it really did not work ... so I have to come back here...\nThanks. window.location works. It is a quick fix. Better than none  :-)\nThanks. You may use SQL to make multiple colmuns into rows and columns header as new row names so this become a new field. To certain extend this has similar effect of having multiple aggregated fields. Hi sharathdaniel pls close the post if no further comments. Thanks !. Yes you can do this by adding <table> etc element into the sting and use it in alert. \nInspired by your idea, this is what I am doing now:-)\nI combine it with dialog/modal to make it looks more nice and apply bootstrap etc \n. When you say fire do you mean going to server side to get data from db ? I am not doing this as the pivot.js already getting what I need for my case as you can see the sample of Nicolas the data extracted is already very comprehensive for that cell. (not sure if it is your case). Instead I go straight to jquery dialog or js modal so I did not try html in alert but I saw in the sample code the alert is accepting things like \"\\n\" so I guess it may be able to read table tags. \n. You may go to this for complete tools you can manipulate\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_regexp.asp\nLook at Metacharacters section....\nThe following is a quick code I made for you as an illustration. You may also explore dialog (eg jquery http://jqueryui.com/dialog/) as well you may have more freedom there...\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar row1 = [\"ABC\",\"DEF\"];\nvar row2 = [\"STU\",\"XYZ\"];\nvar join1 = row1.join(\"\\t\");\nvar join2 = row2.join(\"\\t\");\nvar Joined = [join1, join2]\nvar display = Joined.join(\"\\n\");\nalert(display);\n</script>. As Nicolas said it is possible to do it ourself outside of pivot.js.\nSince this is not the issue of pivot.js pls close this post. You may refer to this:-\nhttps://pivottable.js.org/examples/mps_prepop.html. Thanks. How to simple normal sort descending order for a particular dimension ? Pls help to post simple code. Appreciate it in advance. I tried so many ways still failed myself... I am not sorting based on aggregator, only on one of the dimensions\n. It works for me, thank you so much. \nReally appreciate this.. Pls see if this works:\nsorters:{\n        \"Periodo competenza\": function(a,b){\n        return moment(a, \"DD/MM/YY\").diff(moment(b, \"DD/MM/YY\"));\n      }\n    }. Wow so you are at Plotly HQ ? Have fun... their charts are so impressive I have been using it also... yes the renderers you mention coming will definitely be a great stuff.... Hello, any advance in adding Plotly renderer ?. Wonderful. Can't wait to see that and play with it. This would definitely make the pivotTable even more perfect. It is a mission impossible made possible ^^. Thanks. Would you please kind enough to point me to which file and which section I likely need to work on. If successful I hope to share in here too. Really appreciate it.. Thanks. I am half way doing this. However I need to add ID attribute into the \n<Table Class=\"pvtTable\">\nelement in order to proceed further but I am not able to do it. Please help... thanks\nhttps://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/issues/831. I am trying to use TableDnD plug in which rely on table ID.\nI finally succeeded in adding ID to Table class=\"pvtTable\" but still the TableDnD is not taking effect... I gave up at the end. Maybe it only applies only to hard code table tag and not table rendered in runtime.\n. The default rendered Table has only Class attribute:\n<Table class=\"pvtTable\"\nwithout ID.\nI am able to add ID subsequently so I am done on it. Thanks. There may be several ways you may improve:\n(1) You may try hiddenAttributes option ? It may reduce the number of fields to 6 the max.\n(2) Ensure full aggregate of the data before feeding it to the UI (but I assume you may already have done it, but no harm to check it again\n(3) if you really want to have number of fields available far exceed 6, you may create a separate control area (eg checkbox) to have say 12 fields, but in that control area you allow only max 6 selection and that selection combo change the row and column fields of pivotUI to educate the users they can select only 6 or 3+3 the max...\nHope this helps\n.

    "kmoorejr9": "Thanks for the response - however that was one of my first attempts, with no avail. I'm not even using jQuery or Pivot in the app.js file, this is all an issue on the require.. I did - although I'm not sure I had it set up properly. I will investigate further and provide additional info.. Sorry for the delay - got distracted by other tasks.\nThe problem doesn't appear to be with bringing in jquery into the app.js file, rather when I require the pivottable code, it fails out with the initial error provided above. \nI was able to confirm this by removing the pivottable require statement and work with jquery standing alone. \nMy require statements now look like this:\nvar AWS = require('aws-sdk');\nvar fs = require('fs');\nvar unzip = require('unzip-stream');\nvar jsdom = require('jsdom').jsdom,\n$ = require('jquery');\n//var pivot = require('pivottable');\nwith this I'm able to do operations with jquery  - $(\"selector\").blah(), but when I uncomment the pivottable require statement, the error message appears.. Correct, when I tried to follow the code snippet that jQuery provided I ran into another separate problem with require(\"jsdom\").env not being a function. So I was trying to work around that with other alternatives for requiring jQuery & jsdom.\nI tested the $.extend() method with just jQuery and it gave me the same issue. I looked at that issue originally and was struggling to find a solution that applied to the NodeJS environment. \nUPDATE:\nI went into the pivot.js file and replaced $.extend({}, defaults, opts) on line 46 with Object.assign({}, defaults, opts) and got a different error down on line 1126 when you're adding \"pivot\" to the jQuery function set. \n`/home/centos/nodespace/node_modules/pivottable/dist/pivot.js:1126\n    $.fn.pivot = function(input, inputOpts, locale) {\n               ^\nTypeError: Cannot set property 'pivot' of undefined\n    at /home/centos/nodespace/node_modules/pivottable/dist/pivot.js:1126:16\n    at callWithJQuery (/home/centos/nodespace/node_modules/pivottable/dist/pivot.js:10:14)\n    at Object.

This could potentially fix the issue but I don't have a lot of jQuery experience to tell you how or why.. Understood. That's kind of where I'm stuck - I was hoping to not have to use a browser environment. \nI'll alter my solution & dig deeper into the jQuery problem. If I come up with something I will open a separate issue (hopefully with a solution this time).. ",
    "WSAyan": "What I am trying now is to connect to a report server and show data directly from servers. So the data can be very large. And user can be very playful with columns. Is there any work around to visualize data in smaller chunks? . @hkbeer \nUnfortunately my users can do pretty much anything with the fields. . Well, I've failed to convince my company to build their own data visualization solution. They have moved to PowerBI which is a huge blow for me. Thanks for your suggestion @VitaliyMF . You have to write your own deriver method. I calculated percentage of a column based on another column by adding calculatedField index in derivers = {} map in pivot.js source and  Here was my addition to pivot.js:\nderivers = {\n            calculatedField: function (firstColumn, secondColumn) {\n                return function (record) {\n                    return (record[firstColumn] / record[secondColumn]) *100;\n                };\n            }\n}\nAnd called it from the my js like this:\nvar customDeriverMap = {};\ncustomDeriverMap[calculatedFieldName] = derivers.calculatedField(firstColumn, secondColumn);\n$(\"#output\").pivotUI( pivotFormat, { derivedAttributes: customDeriverMap },true);\n. @nicolaskruchten \nI am still playing and trying to fully understand pivot.js which is really wonderful. My goal is to giving users a basic interface to calculate their own columns based on other columns by writing some basic equations. For testing purpose I tried to take two columns name as input and calculated percentage of one column over another columns and it worked nicely this way. So for my purpose is this wrong way to go? . @hkbeer \nActually I wrote var \nvar firstColumn = $(\"#firstColumn\").val();\nvar secondColumn = $(\"#secondColumn\").val();\nvar calculatedFieldName = $(\"#calculatedFieldName\").val();\ncustomDeriverMap = {};\ncustomDeriverMap[calculatedFieldName] = derivers.calculatedField(firstColumn, secondColumn);\nbecause I took the calculated column name from user. And passed in the into the map as an index. See you can hard code the column name just like the example stated. And of course you have to change the calculation part of the calculatedField(Cost,Revenue) method.\nderivedAttributes: { \"CostPcT\": derivers.calculatedField(Cost, Revenue) }. @nicolaskruchten \nYes you are right.

Worst case scenario: traverse every row and extract all keys (if rows were objects) then do it again ensuring every row has a defined value for such key.\nI'm doing this preprocessing by default to infer how many distinct values are there for a given key (0 or 1 will omit the key), infer what properties have scritly numeric values (will remove them from draggable attributes and whitelist them to aggregator properties).\nThe same could be done in your case.

Perhaps something like:\n\nActually, only on hover the name of a pie is displayed, i will make a way to display the name of the pie's, as suggested, but, with #2915 solved or #2916 solved, it would be much easier, haha.. #2925 Closed in Plotly!!.

For the above data , when aggregating with the logic from the original post, I would expect to have two groups.

    "gchamon": "Hello! Thanks for answering.\nWhile I still need to fix conflicts, the motivation was to have the complete filter features on shorter lists. The list length defaults to the previous value, which was 5 if I'm not mistaken. The idea is to give the programmer the choice to control the list length that will trigger the filters. One might need it on shorter lists, which was my case, others might not need or want them at all. It really should be up to the user.\nThanks once again. Kind regards.. In our case it was for UI consistency. Users were expecting to filter types of gases (Kyoto, non-kyoto) and so on, the same way they would filter other information, being able to use the \"clear all\" and \"select all\" commands.\nMy argument is to leave the use cases to the programmer's best judgement. All in all, all it's being done is expose a hard coded variable to the outside world, leaving the default as it was. It surely doesn't hurt and makes the plugin that tad more customizable.. there is that too.

And thus not a rendered table or heatmap, etc.  How can prevent pivot() from rendering towards these forwards and just give me a outputData back ?\nThis is my code:\nvar inputData = [\n    [\"Name\", \"Product\", \"Measure Type\", \"Measure Value\"],\n  [\"Andrew\", \"Tables\", \"Discount\", 20],\n  [\"Andrew\", \"Tables\", \"Profit\", 10],\n  [\"Andrew\", \"Tables\", \"Sales\", 2120],\n  [\"Marc\", \"Tables\", \"Discount\", 40],\n  [\"Marc\", \"Tables\", \"Profit\", 6],\n  [\"Marc\", \"Tables\", \"Sales\", 3200],\n  [\"Marc\", \"Desks\", \"Discount\", 20],\n  [\"Marc\", \"Desks\", \"Profit\", 8],\n  [\"Marc\", \"Desks\", \"Sales\", 2200]\n];\nvar utils = $.pivotUtilities;\nvar heatmap =  utils.renderers[\"Heatmap\"];\nvar sum =  utils.aggregators[\"Sum\"];\n$(\"#output\").pivot(\n  inputData, {\n    rows: [\"Name\", \"Product\"],\n    cols: [\"Measure Type\"],\n    vals: [\"Measure Value\"],\n    aggregator: sum([\"Measure Value\"]),\n    renderer: heatmap\n  });.

If someone can point me in a better direction, would apreaciate.\nThe reason is as mentioned before, that the moment the x axis is declared as timeseries, its \"date\" string data is parsed and the actual data becomes a Javascript Datetime.\nThe problem is that while the actual hovered point is now identified by a Datetime object, the original scatterData object is still structure by the original representation of the data (\"YYYY-MM-DD\" string in my case).\nThe indexation of formatter(scatterData.t[series][x][y]); fails because X have different values/types when the tooltip is being formatted.\nI managed to correct this by adding \n                        if (params.axis.x.tick.format) {\n                            x = params.axis.x.tick.format(x);\n                        }\n\nto the formatter of the tooltip before indexing the array.

Fixed my original comment. I will provide a concrete example later today.. Ok so here's an illustration of my point. In figure 1 you can see the table view where the dates are oriented along the vertical axis and the labels are oriented along the horizontal axis. This is the way I've seen most people visualize time series data in a table. However when you choose the line chart option, the default behavior is to create an individual plot series per row with the x axis being composed of the column headers, clearly not very useful. \nIn figure 2, you see the transposed table configuration that lends itself to a useful line plot (but a much less popular format for viewing the data in a table). So what I would propose is that the \"line chart\" option be renamed to \"rowwise line chart\" (or something similar) and a new option be added called \"columnwise line chart\". This one will produce a series per column and the x axis will be composed of the labels on the vertical axis. I realize that this tool is not meant to be a time series viewing tool, but it lends itself well to that, and the fact that there is already options for vertical/horizontal oriented heatmaps and bar charts makes it a very logical and (I'm guessing) easy addition.\nFigure1: https://imgur.com/a/m1iafNJ\nFigure2: https://imgur.com/a/KtNEtF0.

So all good.\nRegards,\nDan. Hi Tom,\nIt was a while a go. I made quite a few changes in the plotly_renderers.js file, stripping out what I didn't really need  - essentially it was incorporating responsive:true when creating a new plot  for me\nthis line (however this is in the current version of the file so opts.plotlyConfig was not there)\nPlotly.newPlot(result[0], [data], $.extend(layout, opts.plotly), opts.plotlyConfig);\nI altered to:\nPlotly.newPlot(result[0], data, layout, {responsive: true});\nI hope that helps in someway. \n. Hi Nicolas,\nI've done as you've said:\nrendererOptions: {\nplotlyConfig: {\nresponsive: true,\ndisplayModeBar: true\n},\nheatmap: {\ncolorScaleGenerator: function(values) {\nreturn Plotly.d3.scale.linear()\n.domain([0, 25, 100])\n.range([\"#eeeeee\",\"#85b140\", \"#445c4e\"])\n}\n},\nHowever it's not resizing when I drag the window. The other options, i.e. displayModeBar is working however. \nThanks,\nD. So after further investigation - responsive: true will not work with having the width set as given plotly_renderers.js\nlayout = {\n          title: titleText,\n          hovermode: 'closest',\n          width: window.innerWidth / 1.4,\n          height: window.innerHeight / 1.4 - 50\n        };\n. Hi Tom,\nYes it did remove the width line width: window.innerWidth / 1.4, and setting the plotlyConfig, responsive: true - worked for me.\nHowever there are 2 caveats - that I believe are unresolvable until they update plotly.\n\n\nPlotly with throw an error when you re-size the window whilst the plotly div is hidden - Error: Resize must be passed a displayed plot div element. i.e. show the plotly graph then show say the heatmap and then re-size the window the error will throw.\n\n\nIf you try and download a png of the graph/svg it will be squashed because unfortunately the download as png needs a fixed width value thus won't work on a responsive graph :-(\n\n\nI've not read/found solutions to these issues yet. \nHope that's clear.\nDan\n. :-) I have tried but a wee pointer in the right direction to get me started would be most appreciated. \nD..

Hi Nicolas,\nOnce again I'm asking for your help\nI'm trying to use the onRefresh as you suggested.

The possibility to filter values would be great.\nBut if we filter the empty values by creating a custom dataclass to avoid rendering them, we would loose the possibility to filter the values of the pivot.\nIs it explained better ? (not a fluent english speaker/writer :) ). ",
    "bseddon": "Definitely.  I implemented the alternative function separately because otherwise I'd hacking existing code but I agree that using a boolean option and a selection of conditions will reduce the duplicated code.  How about 'responsiveLayout'?\nWould you like me to implement an initial pass?. I have updated the PR to emit a  or  based layout depending upon value of a new option called 'tag' as you suggest.  The tag option can take the value of 'table' or 'div'.  It defaults to 'table' if not explicitly defined or if the value is something else.\nCouple of things.  There are two lines (958, 959) that I don't know how to exercise so I have not touched them.  With your greater knowledge maybe you can suggest a test.\nThe code to implement the change uses if..else.. clauses exclusively.  The code changes could be more compact if it were possible to use the ternary operator.  However, probably because I have no experience with CoffeeScript, if I try to use an expression like:\njavascript\n$( opts.tag == 'div' ? '<div>' : '<td>' )\nGulp generates some strange and invalid JavaScript.  I would expect this expression means that the string '' will be passed to the jQuery function if the value of opts.tag is 'div' but the generated code does something else.\nFinally, tomorrow I will update the CSS to show how the  based layout can be responsive based on \nthe width of the page being rendered and to make the table facsimile look more like the table layout.. Armed with at least some CoffeeScript knowledge I'll update the PR to use it's in-line if form of ternary.  I'll try to create a view in vertical mode so I can see this this in action. . Maybe, if it's OK I'll leave that to you.  I'm just adding an update to the CSS to handle responsiveness - the reason for suggesting the change (and making it separate) is that I need a responsive layout to the pivot table components.. I have updated the PR with two further changes.  One change is to pivot.coffee to add a 'responsive' option.  This is only applicable when the 'tag' option value is 'div'.  The effect is to add a class 'pvtUIResponsive' alongside 'pvtUi' to the main <div> element (the one that would be <table>) when the 'responsive' value is true.\nThe purpose of this change is to allow the layout to be able respond to directives added to the pivot.css file.  Before I add some comments about this, the previous directives I added have been updated so the <div> layout more closely resembles the <table> layout.  \nThe new directives added take advantage of the possible existence of the 'pvtResponsive' class.  Now when 'tag' is 'div' and 'responsive' is true and the page width is greater than 800px the layout assumes the <table> layout.  When the page width narrows to 800px or less or the display is on a hand held device such as a mobile phone, the layout automatically reconfigures to a stacked layout. The selection of 800px is arbitrary and is defined by the CSS @media directives so users can change or override the transition width or create other transition points of their own.  The choice of a stacked layout is also arbitrary but, again, a user is able to provide their own CSS to create their own preferred responsive presentation if the default one does not work for them.\nAs I write this, it occurs to me that instead of adding a 'responsive' option it may be better to add an option called something like 'customClass' so the user can provide an additional class that is added to the main <div> element.  One of the possible values for the class would be 'pvtResponsive'.  This approach will not appear to explicitly offer a 'responsive' mechanism as I know from an earlier reply you are uncomfortable with this suggestion of a promise.. Sometimes people pay complements to an author to curry favour so I want you to know my thanks for your work to create the pivot table project are heart felt.  I am creating an app that presents lots of multi-dimensional data and being able to use this project to provide users with either a fixed or interactive view of the data is fantastic.  And it is by far the most finished pivot table type tool for web pages I have been able to find.\nIn my haste I forgot that I also installed the 'natives' package (npm i natives) to workaround another crash that emits this message:\ngulp[16200]: src\\node_contextify.cc:628: Assertion `args[1]->IsString()' failed.\nThe need to explicitly install the natives package can be accommodated by adding this line to package.json:\n\"natives\": \"^1.1.6\"\nAgain, removing the 'node-modules' folder then running npm install fixes the issue.\nI saw you  wrote that you have stayed at node 6.x.  With these two changes the chain seems to work OK with node 10.x.  I see the same success results (and failure) when opening the index page in the tests folder.\nI imagine you are enjoying work with react.js now.  Alas, my use of the pivot table is in a WordPress context and adding react seems in appropriate given I don't then get any additional functionality (that I want).  I also want to use the subtotal classes which are not available in the react version (so far as I know).\n. Here's a text presentation of the page generated by ./tests/index.html when on the 'failures' tab.  I see this output after downloading the project zip and before running gulp.  I see the same output after running gulp.
