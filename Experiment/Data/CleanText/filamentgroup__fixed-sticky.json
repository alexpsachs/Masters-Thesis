    "zachleat": "Please reopen when you\u2019ve added a test case for this issue.\nThanks!\n. Thank you! I also added a fix for when bottom > 0.\n. Thanks very much for this!\nI did have to reinstate the global per https://github.com/filamentgroup/fixed-sticky#using-the-polyfill-instead-of-native and switched the JS back to using tabs (as is the FilamentGroup loosely held standard) :)\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks x2!\n. I believe this is achievable with fixed-sticky. You just need to make your sidebar table-cell and a child element inside of it sticky, right?\n. Please reopen if needed.\n. Thanks for testing!\n. Thanks!\n. Hm?\nI believe the newest Safari uses native sticky and would not apply fixedsticky-on.\nI could not duplicate your issue with Firefox. Can you jsbin it?\n. Thanks!\n. Sounds like you got yourself out of a\n\nsticky situation\nYEAHHHHHHHHHHH\n. Are you sure you want to take this approach? It seems like you\u2019re going to run into a lot of problems on mobile devices with overflow.\nRegardless, I don\u2019t think this is a use case we\u2019re likely to want to support in the core library\u2014sorry! If you\u2019d like to discuss further please feel free to do so, but I\u2019m going to close this ticket for now. Thanks!\n. Hmm, maybe I\u2019m misunderstanding your use case? Can you whip up a quick demo on jsbin or something so I can see what you\u2019re referencing?\n. Ah, so I did a bit more research on this for #16 and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be polyfilling this case.\nAs a workaround, use position: fixed for your NAVIGATION header and use the normal page scrolling for your address book (remove the overflow). I think this will save you some headache later on anyway.\nGood luck!\n. I like this. I wonder, though, if setting a width on the fixed element is necessary?\n. Thanks! (I removed the width stuff)\n. Hm, after looking at this a little closer, I\u2019m going to remove it\u2014sorry. I\u2019m concerned about the semantics of a refresh method that basically does the same thing as destroy without reinitializing.\nThe test for this was also unreliable and failing sometimes inconsistently.\nKeep in mind that you can use $('#myel').fixedsticky( 'update' ); to perform a more semantic \u201crefresh\u201d function.\n. If you\u2019re browsing demo-control.html that file doesn\u2019t use the polyfill. It is named as such in the context of a Control in a science experiment.\ndemo.html should work fine. Make sure you check the DevTools to make sure the JS is loading correctly in your environment. Please reopen if you have additional questions. Thanks!\n. Not sure what you mean here, sticky elements are constrained to their parent containers by default. The plugin operates with that in mind.\n. See also #13.\nUnfortunately, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be supporting this use case. We tend to avoid element-overflow whenever possible for the widest support on touch screens (and easiest true-to-native scrolling).\nSorry! Feel free to fork and I\u2019d be happy to include a link in the README.\n. Hm, this seems to only apply when top and bottom are both set on the same element.\nI created a test case for this: http://filamentgroup.github.io/fixed-sticky/demos/demo-top-and-bottom.html\nIt seems the behavior is the same in both Firefox and Chrome. Is this something you\u2019d like to see fixed? Not sure if it\u2019s a real world use case or not.\n. Closing this. As of right now, Firefox and Chrome are reporting bottom: auto for the initial value. If overridden (as shown in the test case above), Firefox and Chrome both report the correct value, 0px.\n. Oh, huh.\nThe dot notation is for namespaced events. http://api.jquery.com/event.namespace/\nI checked in a fix that doesn\u2019t use trigger, can you retest (and reopen if needed)?\nThanks!\n. What browsers? I am having trouble reproducing this.\n. A ha, nevermind. I understand now\u2014the sticky element has to start at the top!\n. Fixed by 72749f1ffc42e8d2d5c8f7eb436e7acdccea163a\n. $( \"#myElement\" ).fixedsticky( \"update\" ) inside a resize handler should do it. Please reopen if that didn\u2019t answer your question!\n. This seems specialized enough that it will require an example. Please reopen this issue with an attached test case (or codepen, jsbin, etc). Thank you!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks @jshawl! @johnstrawserjr please reopen with a test case if this is still an issue.\n. Ah, sure! v0.1.4 should be available now.\n. Not really, no, other than we\u2019d have to add a bit more CSS to reset top, bottom, left, and right values. I\u2019d be in favor of changing this!\n. Thanks!\n. Yeah, this is a known issue, currently listed as Make sticky smoother on transition between sticky/static for container based as a TODO on the readme. I like your idea! I\u2019ll have a look.\n. Alright, this should be working in the issue-28 branch. Have a look, I\u2019ll leave it here for a bit and think over the weight/benefit of the feature.\n. That is a good question. My hunch is that 90% of the use cases will be vertical and not horizontal, but I\u2019ll leave this open and if people want this they can leave a comment. Or if someone wants to code this themselves, feel free and we\u2019ll look at merging in, I don\u2019t think the impact will be huge.\n. Yes, I\u2019d be open to adding AMD support here! It wasn\u2019t baked in from the beginning, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.\n. I feel like this will get fixed upstream, a la http://developer.telerik.com/featured/scroll-event-change-ios-8-big-deal/ I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll solve this in our plugin. Alternatively, native sticky support will also solve this.\n. You\u2019re right. This assignment needs to be made before you make any calls to $.fn.fixedsticky. I added some clarity to the readme.\n. I started to merge this to have a look but some of the tests are failing. Can you patch that up?\n. Really sorry this never made it in.

Could not reproduce on Chrome 39 on Yosemite at http://filamentgroup.github.io/fixed-sticky/demos/demo.html. Please reopen if you have more details about your environment.\n. Yeah, this took me awhile to learn back when I first started working on this polyfill.\nSticky elements are only sticky inside their parent. Instead of height: 2000px on .main use it on header.\n. I hear you, sir! I\u2019m really glad you posted your frustrations here\u2014I\u2019ve made some changes to the documentation\u2014especially around the heavy restriction of sticky elements staying inside their parent containers. Will you take a look and let me know if that\u2019s more clear? Would love your help on improving it.\nAs for container padding, this is currently highlighted on Issue #35.\n. They will be, after #35! Thank you!\n. \n. \n. When the polyfill behavior is used, the fixedsticky-on class means the sticky behavior is currently active on the element.\nLet me know if you have additional questions!\n. Oh! Sorry\u2014I misunderstood. Do you have an example of the style you\u2019re trying to add?\nSeems like the workaround here (use the polyfill everywhere) might be acceptable for now, since so few native implementations exist (and in fact, native support is diminishing).\n. We consider overflow to be somewhat of an anti-pattern, given spotty mobile support. Therefore, we probably won\u2019t add this\u2014sorry!\nThe readme does currently say: \u201cThis plugin does not support overflow on parent elements.\u201d\n. Really sorry this never made it in.
