Cakebread, it looks like you are running the sample app engine application (\"Hello world\") instead of Stashboard. After downloading and unzipping the Stashboard source, make sure you \"Add existing\" application instead of creating a new one in the SDK. If you are still having problems, can you explain how you are installing Stashboard in a bit more detail?\n. @pburkholder The 405 is a different error, but may suffer from the same underlying problem. There are two APIs that stashboard provides. A read-only public API and a read/write API for account owners. The reason there are two APIs is that App Engine only let's you set authentication levels in the app.yaml. \nTo be absolutely sure that you access the API over SSL and are authenticated, you need to use the admin API\nFor further reference, please take a look at the REST API docs. https://stashboard.readthedocs.org/en/latest/restapi.html\n.

This link will always be unique.\nThe pubDate needs to be in RFC882 format. Use the wsgiref.handlers.format_date_time function on the datetime objects\n. Also the correct content type for rss feeds is application/rss+xml Source\n. Yeah, I would ok with hardcoding it for now\n. If the message has an & in it, I believe your current code will break. Instead of creating the XML document using a template, it's probably a better idea to use ElementTree.\n. @VMDX Can we actually keep twitter and RSS in separate pull requests?

Small nitpik, but the question marks aren't needed for the checkboxes. \nOn a larger scale, I think we should kick off a task on the task queue to tweet the status. This handles retries on errors and other situations. It also means we don't have to wait for the Twitter API to return a response.\n. Can you please pull in master? I'd love to get travis to run the tests for this branch before we merge\n. Good catch, I didn't notice that, they've been removed\n. @sijis Thanks for the updates.\n. Thanks for the code.

Wow, this is awesome. :+1: \nA couple of things we need to do before we can merge this in. Can you change settings.py back to the original settings? Next, we should have some tests around the XMPP endpoints. More importantly, there isn't any documentation on how to actually use the XMPP endpoint.\n. @jamezpolley Thanks for fixing the settings, but we still need documentation + tests.

Thanks for clarifying that as the definitive RSS 2.0 spec, will do. Thanks also for the tip on wsgiref.handlers.format_date_time.\n. A little bit concerned about the hardcoded 'api/v1/services/', but there doesn't seem to be a defined place for the current version of the API in the source, aside from valid_version, but that's a verification, not a definition.\n. I'm doing some reading on RSS 2.0 and trying to find if HTML entities (i.e., apostrophes as &#39;) are allowed. The templating engine converts things like & to &amp; as shown in this reference, but for the ISO-8859-1 symbols and characters, we get gibberish like \u00c2\u00a5\u00c2\u00a8\u00c5\u201c\u00e2\u02c6\u2018\u00c2\u00b4\u00c3.\nI'll give ElementTree construction a try, but man, so much less fun than writing a template... :(\n. RSS special characters are now all numbered entities, now that we are using xml.etree.ElementTree to generate the XML.\nFor example, \u00a5\u00a8\u0153\u2211\u00b4\u00e6 turns into <description>&#165;&#168;&#339;&#8721;&#180;&#230;</description>.\n.
