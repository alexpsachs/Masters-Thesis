    "overheadhunter": "Thx\n. Yes correct. I do need the constant IV (must not necessarily be zero though), as I don't have a efficient place to store a individual IV without introducing a lot more metadata files, which is obviously bad for concurrent I/O. But we can change away from CBC.\n. Seems like the NSA used security breaches in certain protocols, but can't break the cipher itself.\nhttps://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/12/new_documents_o.html\nBut I need further information on this serious topic.\n. I did some research now. As I myself am not able to classify a cipher as secure or broken, I have to trust the real experts. And as long as AES is still recommended, I will stick with AES due to its maturity in common software libraries.\nFor a number of security reasons, I do not dare to implement any cryptographic algorithm myself. Thus sticking with well tested libraries (and ciphers) is our best bet to make Cryptomator as secure as possible.\nStill (not only) the NSA is a severe threat to our privacy and thus this issue shall be reopened by anyone, who has hints of AES being broken.\n. Its the MIT license. I will update the website soon. Thanks for reporting\n. Added license to website. Not very prominent, but people interested in the license will find it.\n. The actual license file is attached to this project. The name might be ambiguous, the terms in the license file are not. If I call it FooBar license, the terms wouldn't be less valid.\nFrom my point of view, this is identical to the X license: https://github.com/totalvoidness/cryptomator/blob/master/LICENSES/MIT-License.txt\nIf you insist, I will write MIT/X Consortium license on the website. But changing all source code headers is overkill.\n. Hi, I have difficulties reproducing this issue (also using 10.10 here). Can you provide further details? Does pasting via right click -> context menu work?\n. Should be a snapshot build of Version 0.4.0, as its the only version ever downloaded since I announced Cryptomator. You can verify this by pressing cmd+i in Finder.\nI just downloaded the version myself and still I'm able to cmd+v text into password fields. I will ask some other Mac users to test this.\n. As serveral other (non-github) users weren't  able to reproduce this either, I'll close it at first. If someone finds a way to reproduce it, please reopen.\n. When googleing for \"Dvorak Java\" there are a lot of known issues. Does the mapping work as excpected, when not using modifier keys?\n. And what about normal characters when using Dvorak without modifiers (cmd, alt, ...)? E.g. when typing in the password?\nIf it only affects shortcuts, this might help: http://stackoverflow.com/a/31119280/4014509\n. > But I don't want to use the 3rd party software.\nUnderstandable ;-) but as this is a Java bug, that doesn't even seem to be resolved in Java 9, we have to live with the current situation. As soon as there is an upstream fix available, we will rebuild Cryptomator. Thank you very much for your investigations!\n. Update: Fix will probably be backported to Java 8u72, see Bugreport JDK-8132775. Might need a patched info.plist.\n. Just tested on 8u74, bug still exists...\n. Seems to be fixed in 8u92 (release notes, JDK-8041900).\nTo be tested...\n. I am unable to test this. When forcing integrated graphics via gfxCardStatus, the application runs just fine, but otherwise it still uses the dedicated GPU.\nBut according to this article my Mid 2010 MacBook Pro just doesn't support this feature the way it is needed:\n\nNote: The NSSupportsAutomaticGraphicsSwitching key only works on the dual-GPU MacBook Pros that were shipped Early 2011 and after.\n\nSo there is still a chance this issue is fixed for newer machines. We need somebody with a dual-gpu macbook 2011+...\n. Closed by upstream fix and entry in info.plist\n. devices older than early 2011 will not be supported.\n. Thanks for reporting. The behaviour described by MuscleRumble might be something, other JavaFX applications are affected by too.. So this might be an upstream bug.\n. Hi, yes I did some refactoring already. But nothing compile-clean yet.\n. Might still be interesting ;) Maybe you want to show the relevant parts in a Gist?\n. Seems to be a difference in the HTTP requests:\n- mac: OPTIONS /045dccee-2cf6-4729-a741-52e7d1ac772d/\n- win: OPTIONS /045dccee-2cf6-4729-a741-52e7d1ac772d\nThis takes effect in AbstractLocatorFactory.createResourceLocator(String, String)\nI guess we need to override this method in DavLocatorFactory in order to make it more tolerant to these kind of differences. I will investigate this, thanks for reporting.\n. > ensure that a \"good\" password is chosen\nThis might be a thing to open a separate issue for. Some testers requested a strength-o-meter anyway.\n. Support for multiple users is no longer considered a useful feature. For good reasons.\nWith Cryptomator it is possible to create as many vaults as you like. For example:\n- One private vault\n- One shared with your friends\n- One shared with your colleagues\nBy sharing the passphrase the user is aware of the fact, that a secret is shared and thus hopefully uses a secure line.\nIf instead Cryptomator supports creation of multiple users with individual passwords, one might make the false assumption, that sending the credentials of an additional user don't need the same amount of protection. But here is the truth:\n- Once shared, sharing can not be undone. Revoking keys would only be effective if all contents get completely re-encrypted. This is a worst-case scenario in a multi-user, cloud-based environment.\n- Whoever had access to a vault in the past, might has made a unencrypted backup, he could share anyway. Revocation and re-encryption doesn't even prevent this.\nBy removing this feature from the todo list, we not only decrease complexity (which in the context of it security is worth more than the average user might believe). We also increase the users privacy awareness, when he creates a shared vault.\nThis topic has been discussed on gitter and we agreed on closing this issue.\n. Closing this, as it would interfer with \"force unmount\" mechanisms.\n. I would consider this a duplicate of #20. As your description adds a little more detail to it, I'll leave it open to you do decide whether to mark this or #20 as a duplicate in favour of the other.\n. ~~Feel free to add a cross reference from #20 to #25 though~~\nEdit: GitHub already noticed ;)\n. Deferred to later version. Upstream bug in JDK. See Comment of shemnon\n. Apparently fixed in JDK 8u45\n. @Tillerino Don't ammend. Make a normal additional commit, it will be added to the pull request automatically.\n. Nice work! But renaming directories to *.cryptomator isn't done yet, or did I miss something?\n. Didn't think about users, who encrypt their whole Dropbox. I just had folders inside Dropbox in mind. Maybe a user shouldn't be able to choose existing folders but rather choose a location, where to save a new vault.\n. Agree, renaming and windows file extensions are separate tasks.\n. Build still fails SingleInstanceManager.java:[34,36] package org.mockito.internal.util.io\nIs Mockito missing in dependencies?\n. Thanks for your great contribution :-)\n. > Actually, I think it might be better if the name was an argument to begin with. It should come down from the UI.\nHaha just wrote that :smile: \nGo for it\n. Maybe its even a good idea to move it completely to the UI module. The servlet will then just check it against a pattern (I'd prefer StringUtils.containsOnly(...) over regex) and throws an IllegalArgumentException in case of invalid chars.\n. What exactly does this fix?\n. But how can we be sure, its an Apple/Oracle bug? Is it possible, that we initialized FX from an invalid state?\nWhat exactly do you mean by \"immediately calling the ope file handler\"?\n. > Are you able to replicate the bug?\nIf I understood you correctly these would be steps to reproduce the bug on OS X:\n- Make sure, Cryptomator isn't running\n- Create new folder foo.cryptomator, which then gets converted into a bundle\n- Open bundle with Cryptomator, e.g. by double clicking it\nWhat happens:\nCryptomator opens, having the new vault \"foo\" selected.\nObviously I cannot perform whitebox tests, as opening bundles only works with debugger-detached .app builds. Thus I can not tell you what is happening with any threads. But Cryptomator seems to work as expected.\nEdit: I'm using embedded JRE 1.8u31 on Yosemite\n. > The problem is when you plain open the application and then select a folder from the list in the application.\nOk, got it.\nWhat is wrong there?? I don't get it. Are there different ways of bootstrapping Java FX applications? I'll look some more into this later. If I don't find anything either, I'll merge this pull request.\n. The HEAD version should force this extension during creation. From your other bug report I assume, you're using some Linux distribution. I haven't tested the save dialog on Linux yet.\nIf on some OS the dialog isn't capable of enforcing certain file extensions, we must indeed ensure this manually.\n. Ok thanks for reporting. Seems to be a Linux issue. On OS X and Win the extension is enforced by the save file dialog.\n. What distribution do you work with? On Debian-based OS the .deb file will install Cryptomator to the applications menu. A rpm installer is on my TODO-list.\n. I don't know all the possibilities of .deb installers yet, but I assume its possible to create a symlink in /usr/local/bin. However I hope you understand, that this has a low priority, if the application menu link works.\n. The ppa version installs cryptomator.sh into the PATH. That should resolve this issue.\n. Thanks for taking your time to report this, I totally didn't think about 32 bit :worried: \nI'll try to provide 32 bit builds as soon as possible. The problem: To do so, I would probably need a 32 bit OS myself.\nFor now you can download the latest .jar file and install Java 8 from Oracle yourself. Please note, that you would also need to install the Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files in order to use keys of 256 bit length. Here is a howto blog post. Otherwise Cryptomator can only use 128 bit keys.\n. Update: I don't need a 32 bit OS. At least in Windows I should be able to build using the 32bit JVM. So hopefully I can upload 32 bit builds in the next two days. Right now I don't have time for Cryptomator.\n. - A 32 bit installer for Windows is now available on https://cryptomator.org/\n- .deb will follow, as soon as I get the build running on Launchpad.\n- 32 bit OS X builds are impossible, as no 32 bit Java 8 VM is available from Oracle.\n. @MrSimmo If we implement this (will not make it in the next minor version though), it'll be available on all OS. A common secure storage for the password will be a problem, but we'll try to be creative ;)\n. @gwegner News is: We have a concrete plan how it can be implemented in a true cross-plattform manner without storing any credentials.\n. @gwegner I can not tell you any specific date. We'll probably solve #88 in the next release, so we have fix WebDAV URLs, that the OS can store. When this is done, we can start solving this issue for release 0.12.0. But as long as nobody sponsors full-time-development it is not possible to plan a date. We're not a company, Cryptomator is a spare time project\n. First we need to find a cross-platform way to securely store the key locally (preferably in the systems keychain).\n. This will probablybe the next big feature, however we are currently working on a few bugfixes.\n. Here is a small update: We have just successfully integrated Cryptomator with the Mac OS X Keychain and will immediately continue with Windows. If we're able to save the password on those two platforms, we will start implementing auto unlock.\nOf course we want it to work on Linux as well, but haven't found a homogeneous keychain API for all the different distributions yet. So this might take another release or so. If anyone wants to help to integrate e.g. Gnome Keyring, feel free to contact us via Gitter, all you need to do is implement a three-method interface with standard Java or JNI means.\n. @RiseT I have no idea :D I was going to use the \"MY\" certificate store, but MS doesn't tell anything about its location on disk (docs).\n. @tengwar those are just the interfaces, the actual magic happens here, so we still need JNI. Working directly against the Gnome Keyring API should be rather simple, though.\n. Kind of works. We need some delay between multiple auto unlocks to prevent Finder/Explorer hickups, though.. Created a second issue for starting Cryptomator during system start: #501.\nThis is currently not done automatically, but can easily be worked around as a user can register applications to start automatically by hand.. Thanks for reporting, this might explain #40. Can #40 be closed in favour of this issue?\n. fixed in commit d19ffc327b6741f8c0e81287c56a26fa3fb82d7b\n. Still seems to fail sometimes. Will need to create an automatic retry-loop on windows.\n. Windows doesn't behave very deterministic when it comes to networking. I think I have to increase the retry limit... Thanks for reporting\n. yes I'm aware of that specific issue (linked in some other closed bug), however we can't deactivate proxy autodiscovery by default, because that would interfere with the user's network availability.

Currently no backport seems to be planned, i.e. we need to switch to Java 9 in order to fix this. This will probably not happen before Q4 2017.. > Any news on this?\n\nWe do have successfully built Cryptomator with JDK 9. I can upload a beta .jar version, but you'll need to install Java 9 yourself, as we can not provide exe/deb/rpm installers just yet.. @bullet64 temporary download link for the .jar file.. I consider this issue closed for Windows (with Java 9).. removed the wrong label, sorry for that.. @matmaxgeds @DougBeney seems like we need more details on what desktop environments, ui settings, etc you're using... Maybe it's time to open a new issue adressing the issue for the specific setup that causes the problem.. In principal this will be possible ;-) UI is decoupled from crypto and webdav implementation.\nBut I guess you have to be patient, as I don't want to start a second frontend before the interfaces to the core functionality are final.\n. Good news, everyone! \ud83c\udf89 \nI have just successfully integrated two of our externalized libraries, CryptoFS, which is a NIO filesystem implementation that does all the crypto stuff, and webdav-nio-adapter which surprisingly provides WebDAV access to any NIO path.\nWill publish these experiments within the next few days on GitHub. I decided an appropriate name for this new project might be cryptomator-cli \ud83d\ude09 \nStay tuned!\n. This issue was moved to cryptomator/cli#1\n. Hi!\nThe AES part itself is stricy sequential, but:\nCryptomator uses an embedded Jetty server to serve the WebDAV requests. This is - by nature - capable of parallel requests. One possible kind of requests uses the HTTP Range header field to get only a small part of a big file, e.g. when fast forwarding in a huge video file.\nDue to the usage of AES-CTR it is possible to get pseudo-random access to any part of the file, as the IV for any encrypted 128 bit block can be calculated deterministically.\nThis allows parallel access to multiple parts of a file, as long as no simultaneous write access happens.\nDon't hesitate to write back with any particular questions.\nRegards from Cologne/Germany\nSebastian\n\nAm 10.03.2015 um 06:27 schrieb darshakamodi notifications@github.com:\nHello, I am just going to this project looks promising as I am doing research for AES.\nAre you using Java8 parallelism for SMP ?\nIf you could give me some details, I can make small contribution by wiki..\nPl contact me darshakamodi@gmail.com\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Closing, as this is inactive for a while now.\n. Which version of Cryptomator are you using? There have been some issues with the MAC calculation, that I just resolved, but didn't publish yet.\n. Can you copy that archive once again onto the virtual drive, just to make sure no write errors occured during the first attempt.\nWould you be available for further analysis via IM some day at +/- 8pm GMT+1?\n. Great, would you mind joining Gitter?\n. Might be related to Windows' download size limit as described in this knowledge base article (to be verified).\n\nNot sure to what extend this can be solved by Cryptomator. Maybe the registry value can be increased during installation... Otherwise it's time to create a FAQ section :smile: \n. File transfer limit increased to maximum value, windows can handle (4GiB) in commit d19ffc327b6741f8c0e81287c56a26fa3fb82d7b\n. Nice idea. Should be easy, as Cryptomator only writes one single configuration file (containing the items of the vault list). This should be a separate download though to keep the app-internal configuration simple.\n. As we're depending on .net runtime libraries (see #26) in the native build (known issue in JavaFX), we have to wait for an upstream fix. Deferring portable mode to a later version.\n. @jaorueta in a portable setup we can not rely on a JVM being installed. Anyway as we \"bring our own JVM\" it is still possible to start Cryptomator from a external drive, we just haven't tested it yet.\n. @MuscleRumble: Depends on #267\n. We don't need the registry stuff done by the installer. It just increases the file size limit of the Windows WebDAV client. Neither do we depend on the reg changes done at runtime. Both are just attempts to make Windows suck less.\n. Hi @spbriggs, great work! What might be interesting is the possibility to pass arguments like the settings path or the log file path to the jar file. Using a .bat script to start up the Java program you should be able to further customize Cryptomator's behavior.\n. Might be valuable if we wish to distinguish installation types: InnoSetup Documentation. > New version 1.4.0. jar is compiled with Java class file version 53.0, jPortable suports class file versions up to 52.0 :( so workaround won't work with unless Java 10 is installed locally. Any solution for this ?\nWe can not move back to Java 8. This is technically outdated and we're already using new language features. I am sure, that Portable Apps will support OpenJDK 11 in the near future (after all Java 11 is a LTS version).\nHowever, we don't support Java 11 yet. \ud83d\ude41 We will move to it as soon as possible, though.\nUntil then, please understand, that Cryptomator 1.4.0 doesn't provide any real benefit to portable installation, since this release is all about FUSE and Dokany. Neither of which can be used without installing kernel modules, which would defy the purpose of Portable Apps.\nSo if you want to use a portable edition, please keep using 1.3.x for now. Its vaults are 100% compatible to 1.4.0.. Good news, it is working. Will have to rewrite some stuff about when to hide and when to quit, though.\n. How about once per application start?\n. Will have to check, if OS X allows some kind of feedback from within notifications.\n. yup but that doesn't mean there is a proper Applescript API to register listeners ;)\n. Related to #663 . agree, double clicking is the way I expect to open the window\n. @jncharon this is such a small issue, I think we can directly merge onto master\n. Hey, thank you for reporting! We might need to do an trial-and-error approach here, as I'm not sure, if there is a way to determine, which URL scheme is supported.\n. Great, I would have done the same thing! If you like, you can add your name to the contributors list in the copyright statement, before I merge this.\n. Oh and next time: plz comment on the issue, when you start working on it, so others know about it ;)\n. No, just keep on committing. As long, as this PR is open, changes will be added to this existing PR.\n. Thank you very much for reporting this. This is a very strange bug, as there is no relationship between Cryptomator and any kind of system-specific authentication mechanism.\nCan you please look into the logfile (%appdata%/Cryptomator/cryptomator.log) again? While Cryptomator is running, there should at least be a debug line like this:\n2015-05-31 10:11:47,359 INFO  [WebDavServer:66] Cryptomator is running on port 51142\nAnd immediately after pressing \"unlock\":\n2015-05-31 10:11:52,194 DEBUG [WebDavServer:109] C:\\foo\\bar.cryptomator available on http://localhost:51142/34a23ff6-0585-4781-ac4b-232a21793113/bar\nYou can transform this to an UNC path (note the added DavWWWRoot) and paste it into the Windows Explorer address bar:\n\\\\localhost@51142\\DavWWWRoot\\34a23ff6-0585-4781-ac4b-232a21793113\\bar\nPlease try, if you are able to connect to the webdav drive (\"open the vault\") manually.\nJust for the purpose of getting some better understanding of what happens, it will also help to see, what happens, if you connect to a non-existing path (on the same port):\n\\\\localhost@51142\\DavWWWRoot\\does-not-exist\n. According to this it seems like windows is (at least in your business environment) unable to resolve 0--1.ipv6-literal.net, which is an UNC-compatible alias for localhost. Is your Win7 fully patched?\n. Just to be sure: Does Cryptomator claim to have unlocked the vault, or does it stay in locked state showing the password-screen? If the latter is the case (and I know, this sounds silly) can you retry unlocking a few times? Windows can be a little bit bitchy depending on network settings. If mounting is successful in at least one out of lets say five attempts, we know its not an entirely malformed UNC path or something similar.\n. Yes, you can verify your proxy autodiscovery is disabled (this caused similar bugs in the past - but should not affect us anymore).\nAlso you could create a second vault (using a name without underscores or special chars) and try that one. I don't believe that underscores are evil, as it worked on Win8, but its worth a try.\n. There is an option in internet settings to disable proxies for localhost completely (doesn't make much sense anyway, right?) Maybe you can try this one, before changing the script.\nGlad, we found the reason together :smile: \n. Not sure either. Probably your wpad script contains a rule for \"localhost\" but not for this strange ipv6-literal. Maybe I can change the mount attempt to use ipv6-literal (which bypasses DNS lookups) and fall back to localhost (which is more well-known).\nWould you be interested in testing unreleased builds? We can discuss further options via Gitter.\n. Added this to our todo list for the next release ;)\n. > Is it possible to find the bottleneck here that causes the relatively low encryption speed?\nOne bottleneck is for sure the generation of secure random numbers. This has to be done once per file, thus big files are faster.\nThe next possibility is I/O. And I don't mean disk/ssd access, but network access. Windows treats connections to localhost the same way as to any other host, thus AV software may intercept every byte.\nMultithreaded encryption is not possible with our stream-oriented, on-the-fly approach. However 50MiB write and 100MiB read throughput shouldn't be any problem. So there still be some other bottlenecks, we might be able to eliminate ;-)\n. Ok parallelization may be possible on a very fine-grained level, which isn't very efficient. Currently we support multiple parallel encryption/decryption processes of different files. This way each thread gets a huge task (maybe not well balanced though).\nWhat I didn't think about yet: I don't know, if Windows can handle multiple simultaneous read/write requests on a WebDAV drive. We might have to test this using alternative software (like Cyberduck or WinSCP) on the same host.\n. I do believe, there is space for improvements, but spawning independent encryption tasks over multiple in-memory chunks is very different from encrypting a byte-stream received via http.\nIf (and we don't now this) the bottleneck is really the plain AES computation, the next scheme will allow improvements, as the MAC is calculated on a chunk basis. But currently we're still working on race conditions during partial decryption.\n. > everything except very obvious and simple optimization should be delayed until the scheme is final\nack\n. We're currently experimenting with multithreaded encryption on a separate branch (see commit aac9ead633844deac5c0502f338f894d21d2ecb4), that we want to merge into the next release.\nSo far we're yielding 85% CPU load, as long as the HTTP PUT request is giving us a fast enough input stream, so the crypto workers don't have to wait for new plaintext bytes.\nTo make sure, the WebDAV client isn't causing any bottlenecks, but on the other hand the test isn't too much a laboratory test, I start up Cryptomator normally, unmount the drive by hand and send a file via plain http using cURL:\ncurl -X PUT --data-binary @/path/to/big.file http://localhost:50475/1ca04793-cfe6-4148-af2d-3f06f8c38657/vault/big.file\nSending a 2 GiB file with takes about 8 seconds on a quad 3.2 GHz system, yielding about 250MiB/s encryption speed. This includes about 1.5 seconds synchronization overhead. Garbage collection activity is about 0.2% of total CPU time.\nThe speedup on my system is a little over 3x and the efficiency 80%. Further improvements can be done by finetuning the mac + crypting (mac takes longer than crypt) itself and minimizing the thread idle time.\n. @asteppke Which test is hanging? Is your Windows installed in a VM? Random number generation might be slow in VMs.\n. > small file performance is unchanged, i.e. in the vicinity of 0.3MiB/s\nJust to make sure it isn't the Windows WebDAV bug again: Can you confirm, that web proxy autodiscovery is disabled?\n\nRunning org.cryptomator.crypto.aes256.Aes256CryptorTest\n\nRegarding the unit test, I'm currently clueless. Can you disable one test after another in the class in question to narrow down the reason?\n. > Illegal key size\nYou don't have the JCE unlimited strength policy files installed, do you? Link to download page\nStill probably a bug in the test, as it should run with both 128 and 256 bit keys.\n. We could try changing the random number provider. Just for test purposes. Not for a release version. I assume, that the encryption initialization process, which needs some secure random numbers, is pretty slow compared to the actual encryption. If my assumption is true, unsafe PRNGs should be a lot faster, thus the overhead (especially seen for small files) vanishes.\n@asteppke Would you be willing to test such a unsafe version?\n. @asteppke I tried a few things myself. Slow PRNGs are not the cause of this issue. I added a 40 MB folder full of tiny source code files. Each individual file took just 1-4 ms (see \"PUT TIME\"s in the log file). But according to the time stamps those files have all been written sequentially with a significant gap in between.\nSo in further tests we have to check why there are no parallel writes.\n. These files are not created by cryptomator but are related with Windows' WebDAV client. But maybe there is a way to trigger Windows to clean up those files after unmounting the drive.\n. Great! Thank you very much for your feedback :+1: \n. I don't know either of the two applications, so without testing this particular setup I can only guess: Cryptomator locks some files and not all file systems support locking. Your NetDrive errors may be related to this behaviour, we are aware of similar errors on SMB mounts. We're currently working on making locking optional but I can not promise, that this will solve this issue.\nRegarding ExpanDrive: File modifications between write and read are severe problems and we're currently making authentication even stricter. We will have to identify the cause of these modifications. Is it really ExpanDrive? Or Amazon?\nWe have to test the combination of NetDrive/Cryptomator and ExpanDrive/Cryptomator respectively. Please understand, that we have to finish the crypto core changes of version 0.8, before we can begin analyzing application-specific bugs.\nIn the meantime testing the sync behaviour of both 3rd party applications could bring some light into the dark:\n- Create vault with some files on your normal hard drive and lock it\n- Move vault onto ExpanDrive/NetDrive (Are files sync'ed atomically? Are caches involved?)\n- On different PC: Move vault from ExpanDrive/NetDrive to local hard drive and unlock it\nThanks for your comprehensive bug report\n. Could you try the combination of NetDrive and Cryptomator once again with the new version 0.8.0? File locks are now optional.\n. > I just tried and Cryptomator doesn't actually seem to work at all. I click to run it and nothing happens. I see nothing in the process list either (for cryptomator.exe or Java). Any ideas?\nCaused by -Xmx1024m flag on 32 bit machines. Seems to be too much. Fixed in 0.8.1.\nBut we're still dealing with a lot of MAC warnings, when writing to the drives provided by NetDrive and ExpanDrive. For the record:  @quinxy and me have been discussing this issue via email and believe, that concurrent read access during non-atomic writes might cause these warnings.\n. Removed milestone, as atm there is nothing we can do to make Cryptomator work with NetDrive.\n- Vault creation impossible: Creating a directory with a name taken from a previously shown \"save file\" dialog is impossible (root cause is a Windows I/O error on the drive, not a Java exception)\n- Creating vaults externally and moving them onto the NetDrive drive works, but the decrypted filesystem is slow as hell.\n. Cryptomator issues an xdg-open command with the WebDAV address. The operating system then decides, which programm is capable of handling that request based on the url scheme. On Linux both dav and webdav are tried (see issue #57).\nCan you try to invoke both commands via terminal and see which one triggers chrome?\n- xdg-open \"dav://someDavAddress\"\n- xdg-open \"webdav://someDavAddress\"\n. Closing due to inactivity\n. Hi and thanks for taking your time to open this issue.\nThe \"no permanent version storage\" warning can be safely ignored. OS X shows this whenever an app that supports versioning writes a file to a volume that does not (which is every volume not formatted with HFS+). You should get the same warning, when saving to a flash drive.\nHowever the read-only thing is a serious problem, that I haven't experienced yet. Could you try to find out  a little more about file ownership and permissions in the mounted drive? E.g. by opening terminal, typing ls -la followed by a whitespace and dragging the volume into its window.\n. Looks pretty normal to me. Well the execution bits should not be set, but this is a different issue. At least everything has write permissions. Can you reproduce the read-only behaviour with every single program (including textedit) or is it just word?\n. Ok changed title. I will ask @MuscleRumble to test that, I think he has Office and OS X.\n. @xelra Only known workaround is to copy the file from the virtual drive to your desktop, edit it, copy it back onto the drive.\n@markuskreusch have you tested using Office documents on Dokany yet? Did it work properly?\n. mat178 confirms this. Hi and thanks for your report!\n\nif Symmetric Encryption Algorithm is not changed, It seems  to don't need re-encrypt the files.\n\nWe are still using AES, but not just the cipher itself influences the format of the encrypted files. We introduces a new encryption scheme to provide better security, which makes it necessary to re-encrypt all files.\nThe need to re-encrypt stuff is not something, we're proud of. But security is more important then convenience. We hope this is the last scheme change, but should the need arise due to a security flaw, we will have to change it again.\n\nprovide the data migration tool\n\nYes, should it be needed to change the scheme again after release 1.0, we will definitely provide some tool to automatically migrate vaults :wink: \n. Closing this for now, as not currently needed. In case data migration is necessary for a 1.x release, we'll reopen this.\n. Thank you for reporting this error. Is there an error message in %appdata%/Cryptomator/cryptomator.log?\n. Looks like this is related to an \"extremely useful\" configuration value in the registry limiting the maximum file size supported in WebDAV. This value is a 32 bit integer allowing a maximum file size of 4GiB. See Microsoft support forums for more details.\nI don't know, if this is fixed in newer Windows versions... As a workaround in the next Cryptomator version we could provide access to the WebDAV URL, so one can use alternate clients, such as Cyberduck.\n. Closing this issue in favour of #73, as it is impossible to resolve. Hoping for a windows bugfix anyway.\n. @gwarah: Currently you would have to use some kind of pattern to find the latest url-like match in the logfile. Something like http://localhost:[PORT]/[PATH] will be printed to it. The lofile's location is probably ~/.Cryptomator/cryptomator.log.\n. @gwarah nice! If you like, you can follow issue #88 to get notified, as soon as it is possible to specify the port and path manually, so a mount script can rely on both arguments to be constant.\n. :+1: still davfs2 needs sudo privileges, that's why we can't mount automatically. But with this bug fixed (as well as #88) it should be easy to use a custom script.\nOnce we have an FAQ section on our website, would you mind to provide your script as a Gist, so we can refer to it? Might be helpful for other users who want to mount vaults using davfs2.\n. Shouldn't be a problem. Will try to add this for the next release.\n. Do you mean re-open the Explorer window of an already unlocked vault?\n. Ok, added to our roadmap ;-)\nI will adjust this issue's title, if you don't mind.\n. Hi,\nthe log on Ubuntu is stored under ~/.Cryptomator/cryptomator.log.\nIs it always the same file, that takes that long? Anything special about it?\nThank you for helping to analyze this!\n. @strowger Thanks for testing this with the window closed. This is a strong indicator, that UI rendering causes the high load.\nWe'll need to optimize the UI, maybe this can help.\n. @tompatulpan @strowger What GPU do you have in your system? According to this page, hardware acceleration for UI rendering is only supported on Nvidia cards, which means we should cache as many controls as possible (which means we need a little more memory for bitmaps).\n. @tompatulpan maybe related to #174? \n. In general .exe files will execute - at least on the current HEAD (0.9.0-SNAPSHOT). Still some specific applications might not run from inside WebDAV drives due to missing features like ACLs or symlinks.\nBut in these cases I'd speak of application-specific issues.\n. > Do you change the FS name when using Dokany? I've found this issue where they say you have to use NTFS as: dokan-dev/dokany#678\nInteresting! @infeo not sure if simply setting this to ntfs or fat is legitimate, though.. > it would not be very difficult changing the filesystem being case insensitive.\nYes it would. Because the encypted file names are case sensitive:\nfoo.txt -> QWERTY==\nFoo.txt -> ASDFGH==\nfOo.txt -> ZXCVBN==\n...\nIf foo.txt exists and the user tries to open foo.TXT, a case-insensitive file system will do so successfully. A case-sensitive file system will report an error. In order to be case-insensitive, we have to check the existence of all permutations of the filename. This is not possible (in polynomial time).. Good news, everyone! We've released version 1.4.0-beta2, which introduces Dokany support. You now have the choice between Dokany and WebDAV based virtual hard drives.\nPlease retest this issue with Dokany enabled.. @emuio Does your Macbook have a dedicated graphics card? If not, things might get rendered on the CPU, that usually would have been the GPU's work. And the UI rendering is known to cause #15, which might be related to your problem.\nDoes the CPU usage drop, if you close the Cryptomator window (without quitting the application)?\n. Ok then I'll close this issue as not reproducable for now. Feel free to reopen, whenever you experience this behaviour again! :wink: \n. @gstkenpo Well the 4 GiB limit is related to the target file system, of course. This is something the user is used to from unencrypted volumes, too. WebDAV doesn't have this limit (I've tried it with 8 GiB files). This isn't high priority, as Cryptomator doesn't cause the problem but rather propagates it from the physical file system to the virtual one.\n. @gstkenpo please describe your setup, I probably didn't understand you correctly. You have a FAT32 drive on your NAS, which is mounted via (what protocol?) on your Mac and your vault resides inside this mounted drive? From your other issue I understand that the \"error code 36\" problem was caused by some ._ files. How does this relate to the NAS problem?\n. This is indeed a severe issue, however this needs to be reported to Microsoft. Cryptomator doesn't limit the file size, but the WebDAV client under Windows has a 4GiB limit. Windows knows this, but doesn't warn the user. This is a problem.\nWe could do something like if windows and file size > 4GiB then fail, however this would even prevent 3rd party WebDAV clients, that DO support large files... Another option would be to add a servlet filter, that fails with error 413 when the user agent is Microsoft-WebDAV-MiniRedir and the file size is too large for Windows to handle correctly. However this doesn't work with chunked requests...\n. Depends on #207. Good news, everyone! We've released version 1.4.0-beta2, which introduces Dokany support. You now have the choice between Dokany and WebDAV based virtual hard drives.\nPlease retest this issue with Dokany enabled.. @devarni beta2 is still single threaded and has a lot of debugging code. performance is a non-goal of this release. so please stick with the original issue for now. Thanks for reporting this. I personally haven't tested Cryptomator on Win 10 yet. Would you be willing to test a build with some advanced logging enabled?\n. Great! Please join Gitter, so we can discuss details.\n. @FollowTheWizard Depending on what \"slow as hell\" means, we have to distinguish:\n- really slow as hell: this is a known bug in Windows, luckily with a known fix: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2445570\n- just slow when copying thousands of small files, but fast with big files: Windows copys files sequentially, each file taking several milliseconds. Currently no known fix to make Windows add files in parallel. See also #66.\n. > -0.00006 MiB/s\nYes that's what I consider \"slow as hell\", too ;) Should be at least 50MiB/s even on a low-end PC. If you like, we can discuss some further tests via Gitter.\n. For the record: We encounter some Error 0x80070021 errors. Might be a problem with file locks.\n. We just got a report from one of our users on Windows 10, who experiences a lot of temporary files inside his vault. Seems like there is a problem on Windows 10 with the atomic renaming of tmp files to their final encrypted file names, as I've implemented it in 6b073c1499161cd8c0432c41a3f32f3986081fc0\n. Thanks for your input. For some well-known file types (that are known to be deflatable) this might be a good idea. :+1:\nHowever we have to find some compression algorithm that still allows partial decryption (for random access).\n. Closing this, as we don't know any reliable technical solution to get notified of the unmount event. Feel free to comment if you have suggestions.. @chrfickinger Yes, that's the idea\n. Enables #40 \n. Sorry, but we will not start to implement operating system functionality in an application program. Once we would do this, the next user demands hand writing recognition.\nIf there is a bug with the password field, it's worth reporting. In this case please specify whether non-password text fields are working properly and if the \"second char\" is some specific char.\nOtherwise you will have to wait for Apple or Oracle to fix this.\n. Seems like there are several problems related to Pinyin IMEs, see also https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8088695\n. Hey @ajay340,\nnothing to fix here, as this is fairly easy to solve: Just configure your VPN to exclude localhost from being tunneled. If that doesn't help, IVPN (don't know this software) might not consider 0--1.ipv6-literal.net as localhost. In that case, whitelist this too.\n. Closing as this issue hasn't been active for some time and is unsolvable without reconfiguring VPN.\n. Not known yet, thank for reporting! I'll update to 10.11.1 this afternoon and test this.\n. Can't confirm this either.\n@blogabe Can you please run /Applications/Cryptomator.app/Contents/MacOS/Cryptomator via Terminal and check, if there is any specific error?\n. @blogabe No you don't need to install Java. Can you attach the report (drag n drop in here)?\n. Only known bug of this kind, I can find is JDK-8134471.\nAre you using a virtual machine?\n. According to this Oracle doesn't support VMs (yet?).\nI can try building with a newer version (8u65 or 8u66), but I wouldn't expect too much of this attempt. If this doesn't help we have to wait for your VM vendor (VMWare?) or Oracle to fix this (as the logfile reports a bug outside the JVM in native graphics rendering).\nIf you are interested in giving it a try with the up-to-date JDK, please join Gitter, then I can send you a non-release download link in a private message.\n. @blogabe can't see you in gitter, can you drop a message in the general channel?\n. We have to wait for a fix by 3rd party. Nothing we can do atm.\n. Can you please add the logfile (remove any sensitive file paths first)?\n. nothing unusual here, except for Cryptomator being suprised to find the volume already unmounted, when it expects it to still be mounted (last two lines)... We will test copying between drives ourselves a little more in detail.\n. I was able to reproduce this with the current version by adding 2k small files to two different vaults and copying them between both directories.\nEventually the target drive was ejected for no reason while I was running a directory copy from source to target and overwriting already existing resources in target.\nHowever the last request before the unmount happened was quite normal and without any exceptions. This looks like a Finder bug to me. As the last request on the unmounted drive finished normally, no data is lost, but some according to a recursive diff, two files are now missing in the target directory, because they have been DELETEd but not yet PUT (Finder makes several requests when overwriting files).\nHowever I was able to lock the vault, was the unmount command is now idempotent in its effect.\n. @tuphamnguyen Thank you :+1: \n. Hi,\nWhile this would technically be possible, it would cause a lot of inconveniences during sync, especially on mobile devices.\nI will keep this feature request open for now, but can't say when we're going to tackle this. I hope you understand that.\nBtw the file doesn't contain pw hashes of any kind. We use scrypt for key derivation from the passphrase and then keywrap to decrypt the stored information inside the masterkey file. For the user it means there is no sensitive data at all in this file, as long as the nsa isn't able to break scrypt efficiently (if you google for our talk at froscon, I did the calculation on what it means regarding the absurd amount of power consumtion).\n. @DanielGilbert: These aren't hashes ;) see prev post by @0xdf. We use AES Key Wrap\n. @DJSarus fair point, might be something for 1.2\n. Depends on CryptoFS issue 7.. Thanks for taking the time to report this issue. When the \"source not available\" message appears, do you copy files from within a vault to another directory or from a completely \"normal\" source like your Desktop or Documents folder?\nI do not have any Vista machine for testing this, so I hope that this problem can be reproduced on Win7/8.\nRegarding the UI freeze: Does it unfreeze, if you wait for 2 minutes or is it strictly dependent on the Explorer window? Please answer this question on #100, which I just opened to track this issue independently.\n. We have already had a similar problem. Would you mind testing with an adjusted application, which has advanced logging of the communication between Explorer and Cryptomator?\n. @ScousaJay I'll have to adjust the logging and build a new windows version. Will probably do so on sunday. Can you join Gitter or email us, so I can PN you with this non-public build?\n. Other than Win7+, no DELETE request is made between both PUT requests. Thus the second PUT request seems to fail, as the file already exists. The following requests should allow reproduction of this issue in a test case:\n``` Text\nPROPFIND //localhost:49563/95c6b7e3-c78c-4d34-89cb-b00b885f90c3/Vault/test file2.txt\nContent-Length: 0\nDepth: 0\ntranslate: f\nUser-Agent: Microsoft-WebDAV-MiniRedir/6.0.6002\nHost: localhost:49563\nConnection: keep-alive\n404 null\nDate: Mon, 09 Nov 2015 16:25:51 GMT\nCache-Control: must-revalidate,no-cache,no-store\nContent-Type: text/html;charset=iso-8859-1\nContent-Length: 379\n\u2014\nPUT //localhost:49563/95c6b7e3-c78c-4d34-89cb-b00b885f90c3/Vault/test file2.txt\ntranslate: f\nUser-Agent: Microsoft-WebDAV-MiniRedir/6.0.6002\nHost: localhost:49563\nContent-Length: 0\nConnection: keep-alive\n201 null\nDate: Mon, 09 Nov 2015 16:25:51 GMT\n\u2014\nLOCK //localhost:49563/95c6b7e3-c78c-4d34-89cb-b00b885f90c3/Vault/test file2.txt\ntranslate: f\nTimeout: Second-3600\nContent-Type: text/xml; charset=\"utf-8\"\nUser-Agent: Microsoft-WebDAV-MiniRedir/6.0.6002\nHost: localhost:49563\nContent-Length: 207\nConnection: keep-alive\nCache-Control: no-cache\nPragma: no-cache\n200 null\nDate: Mon, 09 Nov 2015 16:25:51 GMT\nLock-Token: \nContent-Type: text/xml;charset=utf-8\nContent-Length: 418\n\u2014\nHEAD //localhost:49563/95c6b7e3-c78c-4d34-89cb-b00b885f90c3/Vault/test file2.txt\nUser-Agent: Microsoft-WebDAV-MiniRedir/6.0.6002\nHost: localhost:49563\nConnection: keep-alive\n200 null\nDate: Mon, 09 Nov 2015 16:25:51 GMT\nLast-Modified: Mon, 09 Nov 2015 16:25:51 GMT\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\nContent-Length: 0\n\u2014\nPUT //localhost:49563/95c6b7e3-c78c-4d34-89cb-b00b885f90c3/Vault/test file2.txt\nIf: ()\ntranslate: f\nUser-Agent: Microsoft-WebDAV-MiniRedir/6.0.6002\nHost: localhost:49563\nContent-Length: 228\nConnection: keep-alive\n500 null\nDate: Mon, 09 Nov 2015 16:25:51 GMT\nConnection: close\nCache-Control: must-revalidate,no-cache,no-store\nContent-Type: text/html;charset=iso-8859-1\nContent-Length: 742\nCaused by: java.nio.file.AccessDeniedException: C:\\Some\\Path\\Vault.cryptomator\\d\\GW\\X7XKCFU62OWQKOOD7GLJ3ESP26BDW5C7XZQKUUIJ3BEGLNDBSQ====\\7985466836918395474.tmp -> C:\\Some\\Path\\Vault.cryptomator\\d\\GW\\X7XKCFU62OWQKOOD7GLJ3ESP26BDW5C7XZQKUUIJ3BEGLNDBSQ====\\Q7NFWTM7F6OXFJU2QOJHJF7WYWXTH2AGFCYS3SI=.file\n    at sun.nio.fs.WindowsException.translateToIOException(WindowsException.java:83) ~[?:1.8.0_66]\n    at sun.nio.fs.WindowsException.rethrowAsIOException(WindowsException.java:97) ~[?:1.8.0_66]\n    at sun.nio.fs.WindowsFileCopy.move(WindowsFileCopy.java:301) ~[?:1.8.0_66]\n    at sun.nio.fs.WindowsFileSystemProvider.move(WindowsFileSystemProvider.java:287) ~[?:1.8.0_66]\n    at java.nio.file.Files.move(Files.java:1395) ~[?:1.8.0_66]\n    at org.cryptomator.webdav.jackrabbit.EncryptedDir.addMemberFile(EncryptedDir.java:183) ~[core-0.11.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:?]\n```\n.

Needs retesting with current HEAD\n. @ScousaJay We just merged a huge refactoring branch into master. Would you mind to test, if this error is now fixed? I could send you a private download link of a yet unstable version with a buggy UI but greatly improved I/O.\n. Seems to be resolved\n. Not currently planned, but in general this is possible to implement in a later release or fork. Currently it would break interoperability with the mobile app. Thus we have to defer this for now.\n. Closing this in favour of #336.. That is already possible. Essentially this is, what the iOS app is doing. Everything needed to decrypt a file is stored in the file itself and the masterkey. The only problem is, as you already pointed out, to identify files -> #101\n. @StaunenderLaie For decryption only masterkey + the file are needed. However there are two obstacles:\n1. You'd need to identify the ciphertext file. Currently there is no such tool to determine a ciphertext path from a plaintext one, so the only option is to move/rename the file in question and watch the encrypted dir for changes.\n2. You will have to re-create the basic vault structure including all directories, that lead to the path of the file in question. This is a tough one, as filenames are bound to their corresponding directory ids cryptographically and the file can not be moved around arbitrarily.\nOnce done, one is able to decrypt that single file without needing all the rest. I know this is a lot of work but in theory it is technically possible, if needed.\nConcerning data rescue: Due to the used cipher mode it is possible to deactivate integrity checks and force-decrypt corrupted data. Depending on the location of a damaged byte there are four possible outcomes:\n- If the file header (first 88 bytes) is damaged, there is a 54% chance of a total file loss.\n- If the chunk nonce is damaged (16 bytes per 32KiB, i.e. 0,04% chance) all 32KiB of the given region is lost\n- If the chunk payload is damaged, only the affected byte will be broken (e.g. a text \"hello\" would become \"hallo\")\n- If the chunk MAC is damaged (32 bytes per 32KiB), everything is fine\nIn case of such broken files Cryptomator shows a warning dialog and asks whether to force-decrypt. This should however be used with care, as file contents could have been manipulated by attackers.\n\nThis being said it is however possible to write a small utility, that discards the file name and only decrypts file contents. This would work with said masterkey + file + passphrase and doesn't rely on an intact directory structure. Maybe I can write a small command line program for this.\n. @sergeevabc You're right, my first understanding was that the question was more of a theoretical one and referred to the encryption scheme. The software doesn't have such a feature, though.\nWe will not add a \"mode\" to Cryptomator to decrypt single files, but development of a separate program instructing the user to provide required files in order to decrypt the contents of a given cleartext path is feasible.\nReopening this until there is such a program or at least a new GitHub project for it.\n. The same would happen, if you tried to copy the directory to an online WebDAV server.\nWebDAV supports only a specific set of properties on files, see here. While other WebDAV clients just copy files, Microsoft chose to ask the user, whenever a file has a property (such as specific permissions) that are not supported on the destination file system (no matter if WebDAV or any other file system like FAT).\nSo this is just the way Windows handles things. Even if some non-NTFS file system would support every single property, MS could add a new NTFS feature and the dialog would appear again.\nSo nothing we can do about it :cry: \n. Didn't know, there is a convenience method, thanks!\n. I understand the point, but we will not currently change this for multiple reasons:\n- Unless AES is broken, this will not add any security\n- But it does add additional complexity to the system, which is something, every security mechanism wants to avoid, as it adds additional attack surface\n- Reviewed and approved concepts have to be re-reviewed\n- Performance implications (well at least we could benchmark two encryption layers - sometimes later)\nThis doesn't mean we will not consider it in the future, but currently let's stick with the assumption of AES not being broken.\n. Thanks, definitely worth investigating, but primary goal is to secure data in the cloud. When local machines are compromised, there are a lot of other attack scenarios, that are way easier to access private files ;)\n. We're also considering digest auth as a replacement of entering the password in the GUI, as this allows people to restore mounted drives during system startup with the passwords saved in the OS's native keychain. (See #40)\nBut there is a risk, if people save credentials accidentially in untrusted environments. Thus it isn't that easy as it sounds from a purely technical perspective. We have to think as the user as being part of the system, if we don't want him/her to become the weakness.\n. Should be solved with #318.\n. Might help: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10121991/javafx-application-icon\n. Didn't know Chocolatey. Does it manage updates? We just recently added the possibility to start Cryptomator with -Dcryptomator.updatesManagedExternally=true flag to suppress its own check-for-update behaviour. If this is needed, we'll add a new Maven target.\nWe're using the InnoSetup Installer, see here for its command line options.\n. @RiseT We're using Bintray as our Downloads provider. I'm not sure if this is possible there. However it shouldn't be any problem to provide a 302 redirect on our own domain.\n. For the record:\nhttps://chocolatey.org/packages/cryptomator/. Can you make sure, web proxy autodiscovery is disabled? See MS support article. This might be applicable even though it doesn't say anything about Windows Server 2008.\n. No worries, this may still be useful for other Windows Server users ;-) I didn't know about Desktop Experience. However I can't explain why it is needed, as the list of components seems unrelated to anything we use in Cryptomator...\n. I can not reproduce this issue. Replacing the existing 2000 files is about the same speed as adding nonexisting files. Is your vault located on a remote network drive?\n. Nothing special in the logfile. the hundreds of Unexpected end of stream are during read. shouldn't affect write performance.\nCan you please test, if the speed is normal, if you don't see the files? I.e. replace the whole directory containing 2000 files while not looking at its contents?\n. So far I assume, that the maximum connection limit is reached, as Finder wants to read all files synchronously. Finder has a strange bug, that connections are not closed normally and than dangling around idle. I'll try to play around with a shorter timeout.\n. I'm pretty sure Finder wants to read all files simultaneously, thus blocking other requests. We need to play around with number of connection kept alive and worker threads and timeouts.\n. Still slow using Finder. webdavfs_agent causes very high cpu load, I can see thousands of PROPFIND requests on the folder containing the 2k files. Maybe caching directory contents can help.\nAs all file contents are correct and this is \"just\" an optimization issue, I'd set the milestone to 1.x\n. I'll see, if I can publish it to a jitpack maven repo tomorrow\n. See https://github.com/cryptomator/siv-mode\nAPI slightly changed, you have to create an instance of the class now (as it supports not only AES), but this instance is thread-safe, so one single instance should be sufficient. Keys are still passed per encrypt/decrypt call.\n. Hi,\nfirst problems (nothing happening) might be solvable by disableing Webproxy Autodiscovery, as explained under slow virtual drive. Try if this solves the issue.\nthe second problem (switching between vaults while one is currently unlocking) is a definitely bug in Cryptomator. Thank you for reporting!\nPlease report, if the webproxy autodiscovery thing helped (and if not, which Windows version you're using exactly and if something might block the loopback server).\n. Can you post the contents of %appdata%/Cryptomator/Cryptomator.log? Make sure to remove any file paths you don't want to post publicly here.\n. Can you please open the command line interpreter (Windows+R, then type cmd) and enter net or reg and check, if you get the same error (for the non-german folks seeing this issue: \"Der Befehl ... ist entweder falsch geschrieben oder konnte nicht gefunden werden\" translates to \"command not found\")?\nEdit: please also post the output of echo %PATH%\n. Are you using an administrator account?\n. This is already on the default path of a clean Windows installation, so in the vast majority this is not necessary and thus no such installation instruction needed. I have not the slightest idea why you experienced this special case :unamused: \nAnyway glad it works now!\n. Fair point, but at least we should show some kind of success notification.\n. Fixed in 32e81796.. @ScousaJay Just tested with LibreOffice 5.x, which works on our unstable branch with largely refactored I/O. If you'd like to retest this, I could provide instructions on how to do so.\n. Note that the JCE Unlimited Strength Policy is needed - we need to update our Readme.md, as this is mandatory by now. File encryption keys are always 256 bit in size.\n. jre/lib/security should be correct. Note that this folder may exist standalone as well as inside a jdk directory sometimes.\nHave you made sure, maven is using the right JAVA_HOME?\n. Never tested it on Fedora. What WebDAV client is this?\n. Can you recompile the application after adding a line to ui/src/main/resources/log4j2.xml as follows:\n<Loggers>\n        <!-- ... -->\n        <Logger name=\"org.jetty.server.Server\" level=\"DEBUG\" />\n(around line 27)\nAfterwards you should be able to see detailed HTTP requests in the logfile\n. Regarding Amazon S3: This is an important difference, we have to find out what exactly is different on network drives. This issue might be related: #68.\n. As you use Fedora and we don't provide any .rpm build yet, I assume you launch it using java -jar? In this case it should be located in the same place as the jar file (at least if this place is writable).\nYou can also use java -jar Cryptomator.jar -DlogPath=/var/log/cryptomator.log to set the log path manually.\n. > Nevertheless it would be great if cryptomator would report a error message if the strong JCE is not installed in the used JRE.\nagreed\n. I'll close this due to inactivity and open a new report for the \"report nonexisting JCE files\" issue: #147.\n. @gstkenpo Just for better understanding: Was the source volume a FAT32 formatted disk? Did you remove the ._ files from the source volume or from the encrypted drive?\n. What was your data source? You indicated you were using a NAS in #82. We need further information about your setup to reproduce it.\n. Ok then we misunderstood that. We'll try to reproduce this with two SC cards.\n. @DeleteIT Very interesting, there is already an unicode based encoding reducing the byte/char ratio. While this allows us to use a simpler directory structure, it doesn't prevent the attack described above. Anyway thanks for the link!\n. @DeleteIT Don't worry, still an interesting hint ;)\n. As #128 is fixed, it is no longer possible to move files from one directory to another.\n. Apparently Windows isn't able to connect to the webdav resource on localhost. Can you try mounting manually during the \"spinning period\"? What Cryptomator attempts to invoke in order to provide the drive is:\nNET USE * http://0--1.ipv6-literal.net:50563/DavWWWRoot/some/vault/path /persistent:no\nThis strange 0--1.ipv6-literal.net is just an alias for localhost. But as Windows thinks it is a good idea to search for a proxy for \"localhost\" and doesn't cache the fact that it doesn't need a proxy, we are using the IPv6 literal instead.\nPS: Note that the port and path of the given address changes upon restarts. Look into the logfile to find the correct address.\n. Is there any program blocking the connection? Does it work with different WebDAV clients like Cyberduck?\n. @arana-krypteia Thanks for the update. I assume there is some possibility to add server ports to a whitelist in ZoneAlarm? If so, you could configure such a port for the necessary loopback connections, as soon as #88 is resolved and Cryptomator runs on a user-defined port (currently the operating systems assigns a free port number).\nAnyway I'll close this issue now.\n. Seems to be same reason as in ticket #210. Marking as duplicate.. @arana-krypteia Could you retest Cryptomator 1.2.3 with ZoneAlarm (previously) installed? If it works, we can remove ZoneAlarm from our list of incompatible products.. The masterkey file is itself an encrypted file and not more or less sensitive than any other file in the vault. Even if an attacker has the masterkey, he needs to bruteforce it. Bruteforcing a scrypt-derived key is a pretty hard job. See page 14 of the scrypt whitepaper if you're interested in what it means in terms of time and money. And we haven't talked about the astronomically high energy consumption yet.\nSo to answer your question: Yes, the password is the weakest and only link, everything else is derived. However as long as it isn't \"123456\" there is no real security benefit in storing the key elsewhere.\n. PS: We're using the \"scrypt (64 ms)\" configuration\n. Does it work with other WebDAV shares? Might be something we can not change without moving away from WebDAV towards a different filesystem solution.\n. We're currently refactoring huge parts of the I/O system, which will allow us further file system frontends in addition to WebDAV. So even if Spotlight indexing is \"just not possible\" for WebDAV drives, we'll leave this issue open, as it might be resolvable in the future.\n. @boboG thanks for the hint. Alternative fuse-based frontends are already planned ;)\n. @boboG :+1: will contact Rian, as soon as all the chaos of our launch has settled a bit ;)\n. > So is it possible to either make this the default location or allow to manually set mount location?\nWe can not automatically create a mount point inside /Volumes, as only root has write permissions here. You can of course add a directory manually and declare yourself its owner (as explained in this comment).\nYou can then use it as a custom mount point at the bottom of the advanced unlock screen. For some reason such subdirectories under /Volumes get deleted automatically after unmounting them.. Didn't find a workaround for this.. > This issue seems to be solved: osxfuse/sshfs#27 (comment)\nThat looks promising. I just tried it, but got blocked by a check in one of our dependencies. To allow mounting to /Volumes, we need to wait for SerCeMan/jnr-fuse#73.. @markuskreusch I think you misunderstood the problem. We DO unmount drives before exiting. But we CAN NOT unmount drives, if there are still processes accessing files on these drives. Thus unmount is canceled to prevent data damages. I consider this correct behaviour, but this bug is more about a \"force unmount\" option.\n. Probably yes, as it loads an isolated JVM. @markuskreusch can you confirm this?\n. tmp files no longer exist in the layered-io branch\n. just merged layered-io to master, tmp files are gone now.\n. Hey rfjakob, thanks for reporting. This will be solved by #119. We plan to pass the path (in our case the unique directory id) as \"additional data\" to SIV encryption, which will then have an impact on the IV.\nThe new encryption scheme is planned asap but we need to finish our current refactoring in the layered-io branch\n. Nice work, just three remarks: Cryptomator itself is solely MIT-licensed, the other license files are redistributed to comply with licenses of embedded libraries.Command line version is already planned, but it will still take a while (see #43) until we can start developing it. In the final release we will no longer use a random IV for content encryption but rather a per-key-unique 128 bit counter.\nPS: And I think that the lower and upper bound for the encrypted size of a 1MB file should be 1,047,656 - 1,134,479\n. Ok, you're right. Let's do the math ;)\nMin: 0 byte padding:\n// 1MB / 32kiB = 30 full blocks and 16,960 leftover bytes\n30 * (32768 + 32) // full 32kiB blocks + mac\n+ 16,960 + 32 // last block + mac\n+ 104 // header\n= 1,001,096 bytes\nMax: 100,000 byte padding:\n// 1,1MB / 32kiB = 33 full blocks and 18,656 leftover bytes\n33 * (32768 + 32) // full 32kiB blocks + mac\n+ 18,656 + 32 // last block + mac\n+ 104 // header\n= 1,101,192 bytes\n. Yes, confirmed. Makes no sense that 1,100,000 bytes end up smaller than 1,100,000 :laughing: \n. Can you confirm the behaviour described by strowger in issue #76?\n. @rfjakob Yes, thought of that too, but the load is the same with a completely disabled graph.\njava\nencryptedBytes.getData().add(new Data<Number, Number>(step, smoothedEncMb));\nif (encryptedBytes.getData().size() > IO_SAMPLING_STEPS) {\n    encryptedBytes.getData().remove(0);\n}\nI'm pretty sure the CPU usage is caused by software UI rendering... Need more time for further investigation :D\n. > I'd be happy to test if it's the chart (or other tests), but I don't know how to do that on Windows.\n@hudcap We'll build a new 1.3.0 RC within the next days, maybe I find time to add a checkbox in the settings to disable sampling.. Closing due to inactivity. This problems was probably related to high consumption of random numbers, which has been discussed in a few other issues as well.\n. A tooltip should show up, when you hover your cursor over one of the list items.\nBut additionally we could add an \"open vault location\" option to the context menu. How about that?\n. Yes, there certainly is room for improvement when it comes to \"hints\", how to delete or change pw. But honestly I don't agree that filling up the unlock panel with additional controls is the way to go. For new users to learn intuitively, only the controls really needed to perform certain tasks should be shown.\nTasks that are performed only from time to time should stay hidden. But that doesn't mean a context menu is the best way. If you have any suggestions on how to provide these \"rare functions\" without cluttering the UI, we'd be happy to see them.\n. @markuskreusch How about a two-line item in the vault list? First line is the vault name, second line (smaller font) the location? I'd still keep the tooltip, as the path can be too long to fit inside the second line.\nThis would mean we need to create a custom list item control.\nMight be useful: Custom ListView Cells on StackOverflow\n. \n. Fixed in Commit e5d0956\n. We also need to re-implement partial read support in the WebDAV frontend (done right now in commit 57b4067)\n. what jdk vendor and version are you using?\n. do you have javafx installed? it is not yet bundled with openjdk.\n. use mvn clean install, clean is somehow essential due to generated code being cached...\n. JavaFX doesn't support building native arch packages yet. Only .deb and .rpm.\nJust execute the .jar file.\nIn the future it may be possible to manually build an distribution-specific archive from this jar file, as shown here.\n. @tallesh thanks for the hint, updated the readme file. Related to #23\n. Might be related to #70 \n. @markuskreusch have you tested this with 0.10.x or HEAD?\n. Closing in favour of #206\n. On OS X it is a registered bundle type, i.e. it appears to be a \"file\", even though its a folder. This is just a convenience thing, not a technical necessity ;-)\n. Yes, the extension is intended to guarantee seamless cross-platform syncing. As said before it is not a technical necessity in order to open a vault (as long as user doesn't mess up the structure of the directory's content), it is rather a convenience feature. If you check out the first few versions of Cryptomator, there was no vault extension.\n. Whats the point?\n. How about this: It should be possible to open a vault regardless of its name, if its structure is intact. This allows people, who know what they are doing, to rename it to whatever they want.\nHowever we will definitely keep the extension by default when creating new vaults, otherwise we get tons of questions by users, who don't understand why some vaults can be opened by doubleclicking and others don't.\n. > It should be possible to open a vault regardless of its name, if its structure is intact\nThis was a suggestion, not a description of the current state ;)\n. As said before, the extension will stay by default, otherwise opening bundles is not possible on OS X and we'd get a flood of bug reports. If you want to remove it, you'd be free to do so explicitly as soon as we check the directory structure instead of directory extensions.\n. Wrong log config may depend on how Cryptomator is built for each OS. @markuskreusch can you look into this one?\n. I just fixed this for the most recent win, osx and deb builds.\nWe might need a different solution for the uber-jar. As the uber jar can be launched directly, logging to std out only might be one way to deal with this\n. Found a fix for the uber-jar. Will implement it with the next regular release.\n Log4j issue tracker\n Workaround. Fixed in 93b2a4e. Do you mean closing the window, when unlocking a vault?\nShowing the tray notification only once or twice is already planned, but low prio\n. Original issue title was: Feature request, \"Auto close\" Cryptomator on login and not open automatically the folder. We will implement that latter part for now, thus changed the title once again.\nI don't think closing the window is very urgent. In case this pops up again, a new separate issue should do the job.\nTechnically related to issue #452. If I understand this issue correct, the vault should be mounted but not revealed. Thus it is not a duplicate of 452 but rather an additional option. @cryptomator/collaborators any thoughts?. @tobihagemann I'm currently implementing a pre-selected checkbox \"Mount after unlock\" in #452. I'd add a second dependent checkbox \"Reveal drive after mounting\" for this ticket.. Thanks for reporting, this is obviously a bug, not a feature ;)\nAnother thing to be retested on the layered-io branch.\n. @markuskreusch: Did you test after c03bdd8?\n@atodtoa: I assume you tested using some 0.10.x release? Can I send you a download link to our current HEAD? (How can I contact you?) Or can you build the software from sources yourself?\n. @atodtoa confirms this isn't reproducable any longer. Thus I will close this now and change milestone to 1.0\n. to be retested on layered-io\n. Depends on #207. Good news, everyone! We've released version 1.4.0-beta2, which introduces Dokany support. You now have the choice between Dokany and WebDAV based virtual hard drives.\nPlease retest this issue with Dokany enabled.. To be retested with latest version\n. yes, your original password is correct. Do you see a loading indicator (rotating wheel)? Can you please check the logfile (%appdata%/Cryptomator/cryptomator.log) for errors?\n. @RogerMialkowski \n\nIs it anything to do with IPv6\n\nPossibly. In the currently released version the server listens on a IPv6 port. But we changed this a few days ago.\nWould you be willing to test a snapshot release of our current stage of development? If so, please join Gitter, so I can send you a download link.\n. Solved with version 0.11.0\n. win 10 or win 8? ;)\nCan you specify what \"sometimes\" means? Is it possible that these implications correlate to the number of files inside a folder? Have you experienced any regularity?\nPlease also take a look at #66, maybe its a duplicate\n. How long is the whole path? It might just be Windows' limit of 255 chars for mapped drives.\n. @MuscleRumble don't think so, file name shortening was already present in previous versions\n. Good news is, that this is merely a display issue. You can add as much data to the vault as fits onto the \"real\" storage device.\n. Yes that should work\n. Right, I thought a \"fixes #157\" was already in the commit message. Sorry\n. ~~64 or 32 bit?~~ ok it was in the title, sry :D\n. @mmuehlen: Can you please check if you have the \"Certum CA\" root certificate installed? Instructions\n. Can you re-download the application? If the root cert is installed, the only explanation is, that the binary was damaged.\nAnd can you check the checksum of the file?\n- SHA-1: f9757c2899a4e9d42fd696ef227c757c9b9584c7\n- SHA-256: 4237ce94c9123f290cf9069a20bdcc2cc18b51eaf59e2488bba793bc353ee43d\nThis tool should do the job.\n. What exactly is the output of signtool verify /pa Cryptomator-0.11.0.exe?\n. @atodtoa Thanks for the hint! I will have a closer look at this tomorrow \ud83d\udc4d \n. @mmuehlen @atodtoa I just reuploaded version 1.0.4 to our website. It should now include both, SHA256 and SHA1 hashes (for legacy systems).\nWhile I can check the signatures, I didn't get any warning in IE/Edge. Can either of you confirm that the error is gone?\n. @atodtoa I got a new sha2 certificate. Can you recheck please?\nHowever I still have to work on the dual-signing, using sha1-cert for legacy sha1 signature and sha256 cert for the new one.\n. Thanks for your help! Closing this issue now \ud83d\ude04 \n. Commit 65550ce70f1d0f51c1f18c4fccfb925ce4e3fa5e r\u00fcckg\u00e4ngig gemacht.\n. This is a known problem, that Microsoft provided a fix for: See wiki Cache not deleted on Win 7 and Win Server 2008 R2\nRelated to #67 \n. I strongly assume this has been fixed in WebDAV-NIO-Adapter, where it has been caused by not closing DirectoryStreams. No we're using them in try-with-resource statements.. @shaiguitar Do you get this message from ls or is it part of the Cryptomator log file when you attempt to ls a dir? How many files are in this directory?. Interesting... In WebDAV there is no \"open file, read file, close file\" mechanism. It is a statless client-server protocol, i.e. a file is either not touched at all or requested and read. Since there is no response in the WebDAV protocol that can tell the client \"Too many open files in system\", there must indeed be a limitation regarding the number of parallel requests in macOS's WebDAV client implementation. I can not tell you why it then reports this error instead of just waiting until one transfer has finished and then starting the next. I assume there is little we can change about it. Did you try using FUSE?. The connection itself is not the problem, otherwise Finder wouldn't even show this dialog but abort earlier. Guest should work (as well as just any other user). The only restriction we made is, that only loopback connections are allowed.\nCan you check the logfile for errors? It is located under ~/Library/Logs/Cryptomator/\n. @gwoerheide Error -5014 is an AFP error. Fun thing is: We don't even use AFP but WebDAV. Do you have an AFP share configured on your Mac?\n@johan1754 Do you get the same error message in your logfile (~/Library/Logs/Cryptomator/cryptomator.log)?\n. interesting, there are some parsing errors in the log. @markuskreusch can you take a look at the logfile, too?\n. @gwoerheide: That is even stranger. So when not using AFP, Finder throws an AFP error when connecting to Cryptomator via a protocol, which has nothing to do with AFP? I need a break...\n. Closing this issue, as it has been solved for the OP.\n@johan1754: I created issues #179 and #180 regarding the errors in your log file. Can you please post any information in #179 about the way you installed Cryptomator? Did you download the .dmg?\n. Reopening\n. Might be solvable by explicitly telling Finder to not ask for credentials but instead using pre-defined values:\nosascript -e \"mount volume \\\"http://localhost:8080/asd\\\" as user name \\\"foo\\\" with password \\\"bar\\\"\"\n. @gwoerheide No need to replace foo and bar. Username/Password makes no sense at all. Do you have any software, which might interfere with http connections? Like proxies?\n. Can't you just exclude localhost from your proxy settings? Doesn't make much sense anyway\n. Not sure, if this works. There should be a rule in your PAC file suggesting a DIRECT connection for loopback addresses. Can you check that?\n. Sorry, I can not reproduce this. I saved your \"no proxy\" script to my Desktop and put a file://-URL in the \"automatic proxy configuration\" field. Any other configuration, I missed?\n. @gwoerheide The file that you get when entering the proxy config URL in your browser is a so called PAC-file, containing a script which determines the proxy for certain connections. In your case return \"DIRECT\"; means, that no proxy is used at all (I'm not sure, why you need the automatic proxy configuration then).\nI copied those lines to a local file and reproduced your settings but without any impact on Cryptomator.\n. So right now (with the direct conncetion) Cryptomator works just fine but when VPN is turned on, it doesn't, correct?\nNo need to send the proxy configuration, I assume it doesn't allow any direct connection whatsoever. However I am not sure, why the exclusion/blacklist/exceptions thing (\"Proxy-Einstellungen f\u00fcr diese Host und Domains nicht verwenden:\") doesn't work...\n. We're going to release a patch shortly. Former .cryptomator bundles will be migrated to normal directories, which can be synchronized on a file-per-file basis. This should speed up synchronization. However we need to wait for Apple to review the changed iOS app, so both (desktop and iOS app) are compatible.\n. See #70 and #140. Office for Mac 2016 does not seem to support WebDAV. The problem is reproducable with any other WebDAV server.\nWe don't understand why Excel even distinguishes different file systems, as I/O should be the concern of the OS, not the application. Anyway a different frontend would be needed for this (you kind of like these kind of issues, don't you? :wink:).\nBtw older Office versions work flawlessly ;)\n. yes, we are aware of that. that is why we are considering different filesystem solutions like fuse. we did a huge refactoring earlier this year to decouple vault format, encryption and file access.\n. are you on a virtual machine? It seems like you ran out of entropy\n. try installing haveged, it generates entropy out of cpu activity. however you should google if the \"quality\" of those random numbers is sufficient for cryptographic purposes.\n. @cb-studi While we confirmed the root cause of your problem, you should not use haveged in production.\nSee this crypto.stackexchange answer. The quality of the random numbers is not suitable for cryptographic applications. Thus we will not bundle it with Cryptomator.\nI'll leave this issue open until we find a different CSPRNG source.\n. @jkapelus, @rmnbhm, @cb-studi: Are you available for beta testing? If yes, please drop a message on Gitter.\n. At the moment no credentials are needed, so your stored credentials for http://localhost must come from a different application. Eventually we want to allow passphrase entry via WebDAV authentication, so automatic unlock during system startup is possible with a password stored in the Keychain.\n. Today we released our first beta of 1.4.0, which brings FUSE support to macOS and Linux.\nPlease retest this issue with FUSE enabled and report your findings in this thread.\n\nIf you experience any new issues, please report them and tell us what software version (including macOS version, involved applications, etc) you're using.\n:warning: This is a beta version! Make backups and don't use this version for production data. :warning: . - [x] file type association :wink:. Hard to tell from the logs.

Just got another report from someone using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\n. @SecTec: Yes it is possible we're re-seeding the PRNG to often.\nYes, IV must be same as blocksize (128 bit). I was suggesting of generating a 128 bit IV, setting the 65th bit to 0 and then continue counting with the 64 LSBs, effectively allowing 2^64 128 bit blocks before key/nonce pairs repeat.\n. I don't know if we're re-seeding too often. It is just an assumption, we haven't investigated yet.\nSettings 65th bit to zero, because (correct me if I'm wrong) the behaviour of counter overflows is not defined.\n. Closing this issue, because we habe moved to using cryptolib since version 1.3.0. cryptolib provides a automatically reseeding csprng.\nIf anyone has suggestions on how to improve that class, please open an issue on the cryptolib repo..

We're going to release a bugfix with release 1.0.2 shortly\n. New windows builds are now available for download on cryptomator.org :)\n. We know that these metadata files aren't necessary but may improve performance. We do not know, how users use the virtual drives. Are they unlocked just for a few minutes or during the whole desktop session? If the latter is the case one could keep \"blacklisted\" files in volatile memory. As soon as the drive is locked and unlocked again .DS_Store etc is gone (and will most likely be created again).\nThis means that the first access would be a bit slower but consecutive file system interactions (in the same session) would even be faster, as no \"real\" I/O happens.\nI think we should give this a try internally and see if we can improve performance and reduce file system clutter at the same time.\nP.S. However we should keep in mind, that .DS_Store also contains things like labels.\nP.P.S. the blacklist should be configurable in settings.json.\n. This might be solved by using the FUSE volume on Macs. These are mounted with the -onoappledouble option. At least in the current beta version.. Moved to cryptomator/cryptomator-ios\n. Moved to cryptomator/cryptomator-ios\n. @room505 should be fixed with 1.0.1. Can you retest this please?\n. I can't explain why rebooting was necessary, I'm happy it is fixed though. Closing this issue now. Thanks for testing!\n. Duplicate of #129; This seems to be caused by the UI. Still not sure what exactly causes it.\n. Cryptomator needs a local copy. This can be achieved by using third party tools, that synchronize files to/from S3 buckets. But at the moments there are no plans of integrating specific cloud service integrations.\n. I changed the title to make it clear this isn't about the number of user but merely about file locks.\n. @eschnett If you lock, change the volume name and remount: does it work again?\nI think I've already experienced this kind of crash - not Cryptomator itself is crashing but Finder seems to unmount WebDAV disks when it is overwhelmed with the number of files. If you can confirm this, the only solution is to wait for different (non-WebDAV) filesystem frontends (related to #122).\n. can you try using the ipv6 literal address (new checkbox in version 1.0.1)?\nsome windows machines have problems finding localhost. we don't understand why :disappointed: \n. @mdietrich Thanks for sharing your fix!

Yes this is indeed a security issue for untrusted Win7 and Win 2008 R2 machines, which Microsoft provides a hotfix for.\nDuplicate of #67 \n. @finley27 Have you informed MS about this? Is this a known issue?\n. @ntowl24 Just to make sure, this isn't a Windows problem: Can you use an alternate WebDAV client, such as Cyberduck, to mount the vault (address can be read from logfile (something like http://localhost:1234/vault_path) and copy files from your unencrypted drive to cyberduck?\n. @jncharon\nI would make the rating dependent upon alphabet size and length.\nAlphabet size should be something like this:\nif pw contains lower case letter: add 26\nif pw contains upper case letters: add 26\nif pw contains digits: add 10\nif pw contains non-letter-or-digit chars: add 50 (just as an average)\nNow calculate alphabet to the power of length (using BigIntegers). We should then define thresholds depending on bruteforce capabilities (what is the fastest scrypt miner?)\nHowever the algorithm doesn't rate resistance against dictionary attacks. As we can not include dictionaries for all languages we might need some algorithm to rate if a char sequence is similar to a pronounceable word. any suggestions?\n\n. Here is how Dropbox does it: https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2012/04/zxcvbn-realistic-password-strength-estimation/\nEdit: There is also a port to Java\n. @jncharon Why not. Just looked at the pom.xml, this is a standalone library so it shouldn't mess up our dependency tree.\n. @hpvd This is not a game, the user should not think of a password just to satisfy the software \ud83d\ude09 \nThe indicator is just a hint. Strength rating algorithms might be wrong about bruteforcing efforts (at least when they don't start bruteforcing themselves).\nLooking at the \"rules\" just to make a password comply often leads to worse passwords. Think of businesses forcing their employees to change a password once per month: Any hacker knows the last 6 chars are \"201604\" or smilar.\n. \nMerged contribution by @jncharon, just customized the appearance a bit :) Thank you!\n. Correction:\nRegistered ports should be in the range between 1024 and 49151.\nThe range 49152 - 65535 is used for dynamic port allocation. Nevertheless this will work, it is just not the standard.\n.

Fixed by cryptomator-win commit 8288408. Kudos to @Cycor. folder depth should be irrelevant, as encrypted folders are restructured with a max depth of 2.\n. This wouldn't be the first time, that iCloud takes absurdly long to sync everything. Not sure if we have any influence on this...\n. We have to take a look at the folder modification dates; might be a bug.\nRegarding unlock on startup, we have the existing issue #40. This is a planned feature but not yet scheduled for any specific version.\n. Since #40 is already solved, the remaining issue is about folder modification dates.\nTherefore I am closing this as a duplicate of #483.. Which cloud service do you use? Is it possible some folders are not yet fully synchronized?\nCan you please cd into the d directory inside your vault and execute the following two commands:\n- find . -name *_ | wc -l (count number of directory files)\n- find . -maxdepth 2 -mindepth 2 -type d | wc -l (count number of actual directories)\nThe number of directory files should be one less than the number of directories\n. Interesting. There is a mismatch. We will discuss how we can achieve a more fault-tolerant behaviour here.\n. Currently we rely on the WebDAV client (i.e. the system-provided mount) to make PROPPATCH requests to set the correct file times. This will change, once we switch to FUSE (Issue #252).. Will probably be fixed by FUSE support with Cryptomator 1.4.0. A first beta will be available soon.. Today we released our first beta of 1.4.0, which brings FUSE support to macOS and Linux.\nPlease retest this issue with FUSE enabled and report your findings in this thread.\n\nIf you experience any new issues, please report them and tell us what software version (including macOS version, involved applications, etc) you're using.\n:warning: This is a beta version! Make backups and don't use this version for production data. :warning: . chown is not supported, as the files always belong to the owner of the fuse process. We could add support to override this, using the -ouid= and -ogid= flags.\nFor chmod support we need to think about how to integrate it properly. For example we can not allow to remove owner read and execute permissions from directories.\nBut both are a different topic. This issue is about creation/modification/access times, only.. @dns90 can you retest this with Cryptomator 1.3.x?. Good news, everyone! We've released version 1.4.0-beta2, which introduces Dokany support. You now have the choice between Dokany and WebDAV based virtual hard drives.\nPlease retest this issue with Dokany enabled.. Hi, please make sure you have the JCE Unlimited Strength Policy files installed in your JRE.\n. @ErdnussFlipS We are aware of this possibility, but: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1179672/how-to-avoid-installing-unlimited-strength-jce-policy-files-when-deploying-an/28136100#comment40035132_22492582\n. Then we would need two separate projects, one for .jar files and one for installers with bundled JVMs. I know that reflection works here, but in the long run it is probably less painful to just stick with that stupid length restriction rules and instruct users on how to install it manually (or to use OpenJDK).\n. Well technically we just installed the unlimited strength policy files on our local machines and then used Oracle's official build tools to build an installer. We never added the files to our distribution packages ourselves, this is all done by Oracle's own and unmodified tools ;)\n. @shoon Thanks for the hint. We don't bypass jce restriction checks using reflection, though. The unlimited strength policy files have to be installed.\n. Will be solved by CryptoLib issue 3. Closed by e1f2330. Thanks, @jncharon!\n@MuscleRumble or I will check if any string length exceeds the available space in the UI this evening. If everything is fine, we'll merge this.\n. @jncharon CSS is stripped down to the elements we actually use. We want to keep it that way. If you need inspiration, take a look at the \"modena\" stylesheets, that come with JavaFX. You can change the system style sheets in MainApplication.java to test the appearance for all OSs.\n. Looks good!\nMaybe add window_icon.png to the title, as described here.\nAlso I noticed during your last PR two more things about formatting: Please use the IDE to remove unused imports and use tabs instead of spaces (I know this causes religious discussions, but we need a common standard to not flood the diff view with changes caused by autoformatting \ud83d\ude04 )\n. It is not yet merged into master, as we have been developing a few bugfixes for 1.0.4.\nWill do so probably this friday\n. @masvil I disagree. Availability is one of the key aspects of data security. This is a tool, that is used by average users, that are used to having a way to recover data.\nThe backup key must not be some sort of file that can be published by accident. It needs to be optional and it must only be shown once. If the user didn't store it securely we can't help, but at least we offered this option.\nOur goal is to offer protection from unauthorized access to data stored in the cloud. This is in no way affected by adding a recovery key, as long as this isn't any weaker than the normal password.\n. @hpvd When using a password manager, then there is no need for this feature, agreed. Thats why I want this to be an optional feature. However there are lots of people out there who still have all their passwords in their heads. And then a \"piece of paper\" might be important.\nWe can not make assumptions on how people organize their stuff. But we can at least let people choose themselves whether they want such a thing or not. For highly sensitive data they might opt out of this, but for the average user storing family pictures in a vault, availability might be more important than confidentiality.\n. Agreed, we should add some explanation of the relevance of the passphrase in the \"create\" screen with a checkbox to add an optional recovery key afterwards (it can't be done prior to creating the actual key).\n. @SecTec Printing out encoded plaintext keys is theoretically possible. This is not more or less sensitive than a recovery key: If an attacker gets hold of it, he can access the data anyway.\nHowever we have have two of them: Encryption and MAC. We'd need to export both (in total: 88 base64 chars). This is kind of inconvenient...\nEdit: But when I think about it, convenience isn't the most important thing for a recovery key :D\n. 88 = 2x 256 bit keys\n2 * 32 * 4/3 = 85,3 -> 88 chars after padding\n. @SecTec I fully understand what you say, however you must not confuse 83 bit passwords with 256 bit keys. For an attacker the overall effort is relevant and the password still needs to be pumped through a KDF while a guessed key can be checked in a few cycles. We should rather make sure the entropy is higher than the already existing password. So the \"weakening\" isn't as dramatic as you put it.\nBut I still agree that writing down the password would be the same as writing down an additional recovery key, so the user should do that.\n. @jncharon Thank you for your pull request, I look forward to merge this soon. Some of my suggestions might seem a little pedantic, but at least the code duplication needs to be resolved. I hope you understand that we're reviewing contributions pretty strictly\n. @jncharon I am not happy with our current package-by-layer layout :D This needs to be refactored some day. Anyway:\nI'd suggest you put the code into org.cryptomator.ui.util.PasswordStrengthUtil. Make it a javax.inject.Singleton and annotate the constructor with javax.inject.Inject. Afterwards add final fields to both controllers and have it injected into the constructor (Dagger will then require a rebuild using mvn clean install -DskipTests).\nThen inside the controllers do something like this:\nfinal DoubleProperty passwordStrength = new SimpleDoubleProperty(); // 0.0 - 1.0\n// ...\npublic void initialize() {\n    passwordStrength.bind(EasyBind.map(pw.textProperty(), strengthRater::rate));\n    passwordStrengthShape.widthProperty().bind(passwordStrength.multiply(2.23));\n    passwordStrengthLabel.textProperty().bind(EasyBind.map(passwordStrength, strengthRater::strengthDescription));\n    // ...\n}\n. Is the signature of getStrengthColor correct? Should be:\nColor getStrengthColor(Integer strength)\nMaybe it accepts a primitive int? Autoboxing is sometimes stupid with Lambdas..\n. @jncharon sorry, just a few more things. I begin to feel bad about finding further improvements, as I really appreciate your work :D But I think after that we're good to merge\n. @jncharon Oh misunderstanding here: I wanted you to remove the Getter/Setter for PasswordStrengthUtil.localization due to DI. The comments were supposed to be fore single lines, not for the block of code GitHub is showing in the summary. \n. Thank you, @jncharon!\n. Is this the .dmg from our website?\n. Was encoded with UTF-8, should be ISO-8859-1. Should work now.\n. @FZachlod mounting should not fail, you seem to have some other problem, maybe some software that intercepts network traffic?\nThe aforementioned PROPFIND capability is only an enhancement, as it did not prevent mounting, it merely looked stupid in the logfile.. @FZachlod you can't mount localhost:8081, but you'd rather need the full URL, which can be copied from either the UI or is written to the log file ([WebDavServer:121] Servlet available under http://localhost:8080/yQqBS3pivA8F/test). Ok this might be a bug, will put it on our regression testing list. We are currently doing a massive refactoring on the develop branch, that is why it may have a different behaviour.. This issue was moved to cryptomator/webdav-nio-adapter#11. If you google \"0x80070035\", there are various forum posts suggesting firewall software is blocking the connection. In our case we make loopback connections from localhost to localhost, which can safely be whitelisted. Please contact your AV/firewall supplier if you need help with managing firewall rules.\n. File integrity is checked using HMAC-SHA256 and damages will be reported to you. This is a just a connection problem. To make sure: Use any alternate WebDAV client of your choice, such at Cyberduck and connect anonymously to localhost:59876/scan (or whatever port is used in your next launch)\n. As long as the remote drive is made available to the system as a \"normal\" (network mapped) drive, Cryptomator should be able to interact with it. It gets the file path from the operating system and can't distinguish local from network drives. If you use MountainDuck oder just Windows Explorer shouldn't make a difference (except for performance maybe).\n. WebDAV related problems might be solved after implementing #207.. Good news, everyone! We've released version 1.4.0-beta2, which introduces Dokany support. You now have the choice between Dokany and WebDAV based virtual hard drives.\nPlease retest this issue with Dokany enabled.. You are always free to just load the executable .jar files from our releases. Also we're currently experimenting with automated builds of \"cryptomator-thin\" deb bundles, see here.\n. But in general we recommend using bundled JVMs due to the isolation against 3rd party programms. Protection against exploits using the Java browser plugin in particular \ud83d\ude09 \n. > Maybe this should go to the regular FAQ on the main website\nack. Still working on the website \ud83d\ude09 \n. Cryptomator creates a loopback connection (from localhost to localhost). Error 67 is reported when the network address (i.e. localhost) could not be found (which doesn't really make much sense).\n1. From the timestamps in the logfile I can see that this error happened instantaneously. So there was no spinning wheel visible (or merely for a fraction of a second). Can you confirm this?\n2. Do you have any proxies or proxy autodiscovery scripts configured?\n3. Can you please try using the ipv6 literal address format in the settings?\n. I don't know if this is in any way related, but you should disable the \"automatically detect settings\" checkbox anyway, as it is known to cause problems. Also it is a security problem, as anyone in your network could claim to be a proxy and listen to your traffic.\nAnyway: MS has confirmed problems with automatic proxy discovery and WebDAV and provides this support article on how to disable it.\n. nope, the registry command was successful, the following command failed:\nnet use * http://localhost:42427/vaultname\n. Error 67 seems to be related to Error 53, as described in ticket #210. Closing as duplicate.. seems like it can not be changed. if it is still possible, can you isolate this specific feature (228) to be on a separate branch (without the pw meter)? this makes it easier to define the order in which features are merged into master.\n. I think this might work, if you apply this method for your latest two commits.\n. @jncharon I just created a \"delete-confirmation\" branch.\n. @mkatsevVR wow didn't know that, thanks for sharing! Yes this belongs into a knowledge base. We're currently moving everything to the FAQ section of community.cryptomator.org. I'd appreciate it, if you could add this there (you can log in with your existing GitHub account). \ud83d\ude4c . Wondering, why some of the slashes are url-encoded (%2FBv_IuaRgTc--%2FFolderName).\n@wladiolo when mounting manually, use the full URL, i.e. sudo mount -t davfs -o gid=myuser,uid=myuser http://localhost:42427/Bv_IuaRgTc--/FolderName /home/myuser/mymountpoint.\nYou can copy the correct URL from the UI as well as from the log file.. Today we released our first beta of 1.4.0, which brings FUSE support to macOS and Linux.\nPlease retest this issue with FUSE enabled and report your findings in this thread.\n\nIf you experience any new issues, please report them and tell us what software version (including macOS version, linux kernel, display manager, desktop environment) you're using.\n:warning: This is a beta version! Make backups and don't use this version for production data. :warning: . Update: We're currently evaluating different FUSE implementations. Our progress on one of the possible implementaions can be seen in this repository.\nThis is not yet integrated with the encryption layer but so far pretty stable and looks promising.. Locking this issue, as some comments are vastly off-topic. Of course we will keep you updated about FUSE related progress! \ud83d\ude09 . Today we released our first beta of 1.4.0, which brings FUSE support to macOS and Linux.\nIf you experience any issues, please report them and tell us what software version (including macOS version, linux kernel, display manager, desktop environment) you're using.\n:warning: This is a beta version! Make backups and don't use this version for production data. :warning: . Closing this, as FUSE support is mostly implemented. Some things are still missing, but other issues like #220 should cover them.. Nevermind, had an old version from some previous tests installed :D\n. Is there any firewall etc that might interfere with loopback http connections?\n. Still the question is why the\n\nConnection terminated unexpectedly\n\nFrom the logfile we can see that there are no incoming connections.\nCan you try mounting webdav://localhost:42427/deneme manually after pressing unlock?\n. can you try telnet localhost 42427?\n. Something is blocking the connection.\n@markuskreusch any idea? hckweb already tried disabling the firewall.\nedit: wait, how many time has passed between those two lines?\n\nEscape character is '^]'.\nConnection closed by foreign host.\n. Today we released our first beta of 1.4.0, which brings FUSE support to macOS and Linux.\n\nPlease retest this issue with FUSE enabled and report your findings in this thread.\n\nIf you experience any new issues, please report them and tell us what software version (including macOS version, linux kernel, display manager, desktop environment) you're using.\n:warning: This is a beta version! Make backups and don't use this version for production data. :warning: . Closing this, as it seems to work with the macOS Sierra and has been confirmed to affect any WebDAV mount (i.e. proof of being caused upstream).\n. What license applies to the icons?\n. Is there any way to use them without re-bundling them?\n. Oh ok I see, css and images have to be in the same jar in order to make -fx-graphic: url(\"dialog-more-details.png\"); work.\n. We will stick with custom CSS, because the default (Modena) theme doesn't feel native on any system. I don't see any technical problems with rebundling, I'm just not sure about licensing issues. \n@cryptomator/collaborators any thoughts?\n. In our \"native\" bundles all libraries stay separated, so we can prove to just \"use\" them. The only exception is the \"fat jar\" in GitHub Releases, which mixes all classes together. Technically this remixing may cause issues if licenses prohibit such things.\nHowever JavaFX is licensed under the Oracle BCL. I am not sure, to what extent parts of the software can be re-packaged. Depending on the mood of lawyers repackaging might be a \"modification\" and not just a \"use\" of provided resources.\nEdit: OpenJFX is licensed under GPL terms. This means if we redistribute parts of the code (or in this case images), Cryptomator as a whole becomes GPL-licensed. But we want to stick with the MIT license, as we consider it less restrictive.\n. Can you somehow untrack .idea/* files? The accepted answer to this Stackoverflow question might help.\n. So far there is no new commit visible in this PR. The last commits I can see are the following ones:\n\n. Still need to check license of icons, will discuss this with @MuscleRumble, who has a lot of icons that we bought the license for. If necessary we will change them.\n. What exactly does the IntelliJ license need us to do? Have we used any IntelliJ material?\nCurrently we just have the contributors page on GitHub, but we plan to add some pages to the website anyway.\n. Ok I will see, if we can add a team/contributors page this week.\nHowever I see a problem with the conditions:\n\nProject must not provide commercial services or distribute any paid software versions\n\nAs you know, our iOS app is a paid app - don't know if this works...\n. @jncharon added github contributors onto our website: https://cryptomator.org/team/\nHowever we want to emphasize that in our opinion the MIT license is not compatible to the conditions of IntelliJ. As long as you publish source code under the MIT license (otherwise we would reject it) the rules of the MIT license apply.\nIf your IDE forbids creation of non-copyleft code, don't use it or don't tell me \ud83d\ude09 \n. The iOS app is not the problem, but the MIT license doesn't restrict the commercial use of the desktop app either. For example we're planning to offer payed service for the desktop app.\nPeople are considered to be contributors, as soon as they have code merged into the project (i.e. pull requests). Bug reporters are not contributors. We get this data via JSONP directly from the GitHub API. They make the rules ;)\n. Uhm... you are:\n\nAPI: https://api.github.com/repos/cryptomator/cryptomator/contributors\n. @dns90 Please have a look at issue #210. Cycor might have found a solution for this error. Please check the registry values mentioned in his comment. Closing as duplicate of #210.. The latter issue is by design, see source. However the css should be improved as the checkbox isn't recognizable as being disabled.\n. Where did you load the .deb bundle?\n. Ok, just out of curiosity: Did 1.0.3 work? Download here\n1.0.3 runs on 17.3, as there have been other people reporting different issues.\n. @vaulting, @thiagoserra\nWhat are your results of ldd /opt/Cryptomator/Cryptomator?\n. @vaulting Yeah thank you, I think everyone understood the problem. But the question remains, WHY the library is searched in the wrong path...\nThe very same binary works just fine on various other systems, including a fresh install of 17.3 performed by @markuskreusch. Also there is no match of the string \"Cryptomatorn\" in the whole git repo.\nAt the moment we have no clue, what influences the path, as the package seems ok.\nWhat about 1.0.3?\n. For the record: This is the linux launcher code:\n``` cpp\nint main(int argc, char argv[]) {\n    int result = 1;\n    setlocale(LC_ALL, \"en_US.utf8\");\n    void library = NULL;\n{\n    std::string programPath = GetProgramPath();\n    std::string libraryName = dirname((char*)programPath.c_str());\n    libraryName += \"/libpackager.so\";\n    library = dlopen(libraryName.c_str(), RTLD_LAZY);\n\n    if (library == NULL) {\n        printf(\"%s not found.\\n\", libraryName.c_str());\n    }\n}\n// [...]\n\n}\n```\nWith GetProgramPath being:\n``` cpp\nstd::string GetProgramPath() {\n    std::string result;\n    char *buffer = new char[MAX_PATH];\nif (buffer != NULL) {\n    if (readlink(\"/proc/self/exe\", buffer, MAX_PATH - 1) != -1) {\n        buffer[MAX_PATH - 1] = '\\0';\n        result = buffer;\n    }\n\n    delete[] buffer;\n}\n\nreturn result;\n\n}\n```\n. As a comparison here is an example from the readlink manpage:\n``` c\ninclude \nchar buf[1024];\nssizet_t len;\n...\nif ((len = readlink(\"/modules/pass1\", buf, sizeof(buf)-1)) != -1)\n   buf[len] = '\\0';\n```\nNote the difference: \\0-Terminator is stored at position len instead of buffer size. The array might be filled with indeterminate stuff.\n. I filed a bug report, will post the link here as soon as it's confirmed.\n. @vaulting new version 1.0.5 can be downloaded here.\nIf our aforementioned analysis is correct, it should fix this issue.\nSorry for your internet quota :D\n. @vaulting wow that's fast \ud83d\ude01 \nA faster way to verify the fix (at least be about 90% sure) might be to replace /opt/Cryptomator/Cryptomator by this file (11KB).\n. All right, thanks for testing! I will close this issue now. Please reopen, if there are still problems in 1.0.5.\n. JDK bug report:\nhttps://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8157913\nhttp://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=8157913\n. Apparently fixed in Java 9, see diff.. ## It's a bug :(\nApparently this is the first sync conflict bug reported. We just worked on this recently, see issue #98.\nHowever I think we need to reopen #98, as this is a .lng file (long file name, which needs a mapping file). It will be fixed with release 1.1.\nWorkaround :)\nPlease search for K3DF2A2LSJWNNCK3SF3JVH6OS6DAZNZC (1).lng inside of the encrypted directory. There should be exactly two matches, one with the path specified in your log file and one somewhere in your d/ directory.\nThe one inside of d/ is probably accompanied by K3DF2A2LSJWNNCK3SF3JVH6OS6DAZNZC.lng, as the filename is not produced by Cryptomator but rather due to a sync conflict.\nRemove the one with (1) from d/../.../, but make sure not to delete it - just in case you want to restore this version.\nAfterwards everything should work again.\n. Sync conflict detection (as in #98) now works with .lng files, too. Version 1.1 will be released this week.\n. The problem is: davfs requires sudo. But cryptomator runs completely in user space. Currently we're working on fuse support, which might help with a lot of WebDAV-related issues.\n. Closing this, as it is effectively solved by using FUSE.. somthing like: \"checking for updates failed \ud83d\udd04 \"\n. @MuscleRumble any thoughts on the button design?\n. just mvn clean install the main project. env.COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN is only needed when executing the profile test-coverage.\n. Ack. Filesystem I/O activity is measured anyway and doesn't influence performance.\n. Might be of interest: com.apple.eawt.AppEvent.ScreenSleepEvent.. @jellemdekker Thanks for your interest in helping us here!\nTo be honest, I no longer prefer a multi-platform solution. Instead I want to get rid of the update check within the JavaFX application and would propose the following:\n\nSparkle for Cryptomator for macOS\nAppImageUpdate for Cryptomator for Linux\nSomething else (maybe WinSparkle?) for Cryptomator for Windows. Might be a problem with URL encoding in dir listings:\n\n```\n2016-05-29 12:18:40,661 DEBUG [Server:506] REQUEST on HttpChannelOverHttp@6a5022f{r=2,c=false,a=DISPATCHED,uri=/test3/}\nPROPFIND //localhost:42427/test3/\nConnection: keep-alive\nUser-Agent: Microsoft-WebDAV-MiniRedir/6.3.9600\nDepth: 0\ntranslate: f\nContent-Length: 0\nHost: localhost:42427\n2016-05-29 12:18:40,665 DEBUG [Server:520] RESPONSE for /test3/ h=true\n207 null\nDate: Sun, 29 May 2016 10:18:40 GMT\nContent-Type: text/xml;charset=utf-8\nContent-Length: 461\n2016-05-29 12:18:40,834 DEBUG [Server:506] REQUEST on HttpChannelOverHttp@54c59c03{r=1,c=false,a=DISPATCHED,uri=/test3/http://localhost:42427/test3/Privacy%20Tools%20-%20Encryption%20against%20global%20mass%20surveillance%20%f0%9f%94%92_fichiers}\nPROPFIND //localhost:42427/test3/http://localhost:42427/test3/Privacy%20Tools%20-%20Encryption%20against%20global%20mass%20surveillance%20%f0%9f%94%92_fichiers\nConnection: keep-alive\nUser-Agent: Microsoft-WebDAV-MiniRedir/6.3.9600\nDepth: 0\ntranslate: f\nContent-Length: 0\nHost: localhost:42427\n2016-05-29 12:18:40,838 DEBUG [Server:520] RESPONSE for /test3/http://localhost:42427/test3/Privacy Tools - Encryption against global mass surveillance ?_fichiers h=true\n404 null\nDate: Sun, 29 May 2016 10:18:40 GMT\nCache-Control: must-revalidate,no-cache,no-store\nContent-Type: text/html;charset=iso-8859-1\nContent-Length: 448\n```\nNote the extra vault root url //localhost:42427/test3/http://localhost:42427/test3\n.

I think we need some rework here. Not all Linux distributions have a tray. When minimizing to a nonexisting tray, a lot of people had problems, so we decided to \"just minimize\" the window on Linux in general.\nI think it is time for a more elaborate decision whether to use a the tray or not.\n. > Heck, even creating a checkbox to \"minimize to tray\" would go a long way. Users without a tray would (should) not enable it\nSometimes one doesn't see the most obvious solutions \ud83d\ude09 \n. Letting the user choose what should happen (\"checkbox approach\") seems right. Maybe even in an os-independent manner (similar request in #346 for macOS). I'm thinking about a new dropdown in the program settings:\nWhen closing the main window...\n ... minimize to tray\n ... minimize\n* ... quit. @y8u you can restrict the amount of memory used and force more frequent garbage collection by editing C:\\Program Files\\Cryptomator\\app\\Cryptomator.cfg with any text editor and adding -Xmx512m to the JVMOptions as follows:\n[JVMOptions]\n-Dcryptomator.logPath=%appdata%/Cryptomator/cryptomator.log\n-Xmx512m\nChange 512 to whatever number you like, but I wouldn't recommend values lower than 100.\nPlease note that this is just the heap size, so you will still need approx. 200MiB, when the heap is restricted to 100MiB.\n@Iaintnocoder Same goes for fedora. Default is 1GiB, so it must not consume more than 1.2 GiB in total. Your 8GiB should be totally sufficient.\n. @y8u \n\nPlease note that this is just the heap size\n. For some reason your loopback interface is not considered a to be local. Cryptomator doesn't allow connection from remote hosts. Any proxy in place?\n. @Surroot Can you retest this with 10.12.5 Beta 3 and post your findings in issue #481? Thanks!. @TJbiz New solution proposed by Cycor in issue 210. Please check the two registry values.. Closing as duplicate of #210. Hi @Zevran! We had this issue before, please refer to #193. There is also a solution given by @mdietrich\n. Just to clarify: You're seeing both, file and folder with the same name inside the same parent directory?\n\nAre you familiar with the OS X concept of \"bundles\"? Can you be sure you didn't add a bundle to the vault?\n. On which OS did you originally create the affected file/dir?\n. We were able to reproduce the problem. The root cause is the following:\nThe ownCloud client adds a _conflict-date-time suffix to files that are in conflict. So besides abc there will be abc_conflict-123-456.\nHowever _ is a suffix used by Cryptomator to indicate directories. So instead of abc _conflict-whatever it thinks of the file being abc_ conflict-whatever.\nWe need to provide a hotfix for this issue. Until then, you can try to solve the conflict manually (assuming ownCloud has logged the conflict).\n. Directories have two components, one of them is a \"normal\" file ending on _. The actual directory is in a different location.\n. Fixed with release 1.1.1 \ud83d\ude04 \n. Oh cool, I was waiting for the official 0.7.7 release of jacoco :)\nBut your problem here is unrelated. Seems like you're using Oracle JDK without the JCE extensions. Please install those, too (See #116)\n. Closing this as duplicate of #116, as I just updated the dependency, so both issues should be resolved. Reopen, if I'm mistaken.\n. It is not jacoco-related. No installed provider supports this key and java.security.InvalidKeyException: Illegal key size are usually clear indicators, your JVM doesn't support 256 bit AES keys.\nI don't know, if the key length limits for RC5 and AES are the same, I would suggest to repeat the test for AES, as we're not using RC5 anywhere.\nPlease share information about your JVM.\n. Closing due to inactivity.\n. > I still prefer \"root-only\" files as a portable solution, or keystores.\nfull ack. the latter one is already implemented for win/osx. however automation as discussed here is probably most usable on linux machines, which don't have a common keychain api (see issue #40), so a protected file is probably the way to go.\n. This issue was moved to cryptomator/cli#2\n. @skrzepto it is located here\nHowever please note, that this is used by the JavaFX packager, we don't have full control over the files created here.\n. @skrzepto Where did you read that it is missing due to licensing issues? I think it is just missing, because nobody put it there.\n. Hmmm... If I am not mistaken OpenJFX is around since early 2014. Sad that some distributions take so much time to offer up-to-date packages. \ud83d\ude1e \n. These are two different issues: At least the one with LibreOffice is a known bug, that has been fixed with LibreOffice 5.\n. Today we released our first beta of 1.4.0, which brings FUSE support to macOS and Linux.\nPlease retest this issue with FUSE enabled and report your findings in this thread.\n\nIf you experience any new issues, please report them and tell us what software version (including macOS version, linux kernel, display manager, desktop environment) you're using.\n:warning: This is a beta version! Make backups and don't use this version for production data. :warning: . Can you try if the same error arises, when you use an alternate WebDAV client such as Cyberduck?\n. Oh sorry, I should have explained: Cryptomator uses WebDAV itself to provide the virtual hard drive. After unlocking you can copy the webdav URL (next to the \"lock\" button) and use it with 3rd party clients.\n. @RiseT Not in general, but for certain scenarios 3rd party WebDAV clients are way better than what Microsoft tried and failed to create. E.g. for files larger than 4GiB and files that contain percentage escapes.\n. Nope, leave it open. It will hopefully be resolved, when we switch from WebDAV to Dokany. I'll label it as WebDAV-related.\n. Will not happen for the main application, as the decrypted content would need to reside in memory due to the nature of transparent encryption, which is obviously not feasible for bigger vaults.\nHowever this shouldn't be a problem with a separate script-like tool, as soon as we have completely externalized the crypto part to a separate library.\n. Cryptomator is an encryption tool, not a steganography software. When hiding the key, one would still know there are a lot of encrypted files due to the high entropy. It will never be plausible if you tell the dictator of your choice, that those files are just broken jpegs. I strongly recommend to use steganography tools.\nBut if you believe the absence of the masterkey helps, please refer to issue #96.\nBy the way: Given the number of attacks that I learned against the parsers, XML encryption is probably the worst thing I know ;)\n. Sorry, I still don't understand how this is helping plausible deniability. No matter how the masterkey is stored, an attacker would still be able to see it is a cryptomator vault. Could you please elaborate?\n. If an attacker only looks at the structure and file extension of the masterkey, #96 will solve the problem. However I would still argue, that the directory layout is still a good hint, one is looking at a Cryptomator vault.\n. hi @g-monk, sadly this isn't currently an option for us, as the future of windows phone is more than unclear. See The Verge, TechCrunch, TNW, PC Mag.\nHowever we would gladly support anyone who wants to publish a Windows Phone App, e.g. by helping in  porting the crypto code.\nI hope you understand, that we can not easily commit to a platform that even big companies turn their back on. That said, we are likely to reconsider this decision, if the the situation changes.\n. Possible duplicate of #96?\n. We'll evaluate what is the best way to store the masterkey differently. Until then feel free to make as many backups of the masterkey as you want manually. I know this isn't the smoothest workflow, but should be feasible for an extra bit of security.\n. Removing this if-statement and the complete else-block might be a suitable hotfix.\n. Duplicate of cryptomator-win issue #1\n. Don't worry, we never documented anywhere that installer-specific issues are tracked on separate projects ;)\n. Duplicate of #87.\n. The error is displayed by a 3rd party application, not by Cryptomator. We can not know, if a scheme is supported without attempting to mount.\nAny ideas?\n. @anewuser: On your KDE bug report, you could add a note, that one can test WebDAV clients against http://webdavserver.com/. That site creates temporary dav resources to demo their server library. (Cause David Faure wrote, he doesn't have a WebDAV account anywhere). Has been resolved with 1.2.0\n. Nothing suspicious in the log so far. I understand this is only a short excerpt. Can you please search for PUT //localhost inside the file and post the following few lines till the end of the next RESPONSE block?\n. Ok reading the log I assume, that you're somehow mounting Amazon Cloud Drive as a network drive, am I right? Apparently that mount isn't writable. How do you access ACD?\n. @stefnats \nJust remove the entry from the vault list (it will not do any harm) and press \u2795  to reopen it from the new location.\nMaybe the text isn't the most descriptive yet \ud83d\ude04 \n. Very interesting alternative to direct Fuse/Dokany adapters. Thanks for sharing this.\nRelated to #252 and #207.\n. License is compatible: http://pismotec.com/pfm/license/\n. Library + Examples: http://pismotec.com/pfm/doc/#kit-java\n. Closing this in favour of #207.. Thanks for sharing this exploit! Concerning a possible fix: Are all operating systems able to mount http://user:pw@localhost:12345/foo? If this is the case, we could generate random credentials for each unlock attempt.\nAny thoughts on this?\n. Assuming the user uses an up-to-date browser when visiting the attacker's website, wouldn't the same origin policy stop such XHRs?\nEdit: I mean PROPFIND requests, I am aware this doesn't apply to POST requests sent by forms.\n. Ok got it. Damn flash..\n. Just to get you right: How is the XHR executed despite SOP?\n. Ok my bad. I had the impression that the SOP prohibits the requests, not the responses. A POST-filter might work, but I think that some kind of authentication is more reliable concerning similar attacks.\n. of course... \ud83d\ude1e \n. Please don't use the default hex encoding of UUIDs. We've had that in the past and users hated to see those long \"technical\" strings.\nA CSPRNG is not necessary here. Better implement a tarpit with increasing delays for invalid URIs.\n. I think we need some switch to distinguish Win10 vs. older Windows versions. See #83.\n. Today we released our first beta of 1.4.0, which brings FUSE support to macOS and Linux.\nPlease retest this issue with FUSE enabled and report your findings in this thread.\n\nIf you experience any new issues, please report them and tell us what software version (including macOS version, involved applications, etc) you're using.\n:warning: This is a beta version! Make backups and don't use this version for production data. :warning: . fair enough \ud83d\ude09 \n. @v4n is it mounted in read-only mode? The attempt to backup the masterkey fails due to missing write permissions.\n. @markuskreusch is it possible that this is related to the JVM/Linux/network drive bug?\n. This placeholder mechanism needs to be in the sync client. Currently we don't plan to implement direct cloud access for the desktop application. We like the Unix approach \"one utility for one purpose\".\nIf, however, there is anything we can do to improve reliability with such features of odrive and others, we're happy to do so.\n. Btw I am secretly working on a small CLI utility for decryption of single files. Nothing very user-friendly, rather a data recovery tool with the ability to force-decrypt manipulated files. But once I publish the code, it might be a good starting point for such a load-and-decrypt-files-individually approach.\n. > Fits to \"one tool per job) as well.\n\ud83d\udc4d \nFor the desktop application this is the way to go. Cryptomator will not include sync functionality anyway. I think @markuskreusch was referring to the fact that we didn't get access to the SDK for mobile devices.. uid option might be what you're looking for. See man page\n. WebDAV doesn't have elaborate file permissions. All files belong to the user/group mounting the filesystem. With GVFS it is the user, you're currently logged in with. With DavFS it is root and can be changed using the aforementioned flag.\nI assume, that you're running Cryptomator as root, if the mounted drive is also owned by root.\n. > I ran cryptomator from console and got\nI think we need to update the AUR release. logfile should be put into ~/.Cryptomator/.\n\nThe only strange thing I can see is that it seems to execute the gvfs-mount command twice.\n\nThat is odd. If the first one was successful, there should be no reason for a second attempt.\nAnyway a non-root process invoking gvfs should be 100% in user space. Might be a bug in Arch's gvfs.\n. Oh sorry, I could have told you, that there is also a \"normal\" path for gvfs.\nI personally can not recommend putting already encrypted resources into the vault. In the past there have been cases, where people locked up their Keepass keychain into a Cryptomator vault and used a Keepass-managed, generated passphrase for the vault, thus deadlocking the complete keychain after the next vault unmount.\n. Starting with the first OpenJDK-based release this will be included.. Not before #207 / #252 / #315  as we need to see how mounting works here and if the drive letter mechanism stays the same.\n. Since we're currently working on #207 and #252, we can now say, that implementing this feature is feasible.. What is the structure of the affected vault like? can you post a few samples of filenames inside the d directory?\nAnything in your log file after trying to access the vault?\n. Any small letters in your encrypted directory names? Could you post a sample of the structure of the d/ directory?\n. Thats ok, there should be a corresponding file with the same name inside the m/ dir\n. If you restored it and the original password is being accepts, thats ok.\n. We will not further investigate, since FUSE is around the corner.. @tobihagemann would be very convenient, but I'd prefer a cross-platform solution. As this is usually just needed during restoration of an old version a \"enter cleartext path, get a ciphertext path\" utility (as implemented in the restorer util) might be feasible at first.\n. > Allow dragging&dropping a cleartext file onto the Cryptomator UI, which reveals the ciphertext file in return\nMy thoughts exactly!. Duplicate of #80 \n. Note: WinFsp has a restrictive license, that is incompatible to the MIT license.\n. I never said it is not open, not free or not good. It is just not as permissive as needed to be used in a MIT-licensed project. In fact now that I read about the differences to the GPL I will suggest the current copyright owners of some of our libraries to switch from GPL to AGPL, too.\n. Update: we're currently experimenting with FUSE via jnr-fuse, which uses WinFsp.. Closing this in favour of #207.\nWhile WinFSP is a great project and I loved its simplicity, https://github.com/cryptomator/fuse-nio-adapter/issues/12 is a blocker for Cryptomator integration.. This is indeed a strange bug. I can not imagine what's the difference between invoking the binary via Terminal and starting the .app bundle from Spotlight/Launchpad. Are you sure, both file paths are identical? Just to make sure there are no two different Cryptomator versions with only one of them working.\nWhat happens when invoking open /Applications/Cryptomator.app?\n. No idea, why it is shutting down after a second, however this log proves that the JVM did start. Thus \"failed to launch JVM\" must be unrelated to this start.\nThere are issues when the graphics device is not supported (see #93), however the log looked different there (containing some kind of crash dump). But maybe this changed over time (Cryptomator 1.1.4 has Oracle JRE 8u102 bundled).\n. @xakraz seen this before, please check if this works for you: https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/193#issuecomment-198533922\nEdit:\n\nit needs a FLAG on the CLI to work\n\nVery strang this works, though.. We've released our first beta of 1.4.0, which brings FUSE support to macOS and Linux.\nPlease retest this issue with FUSE enabled and report your findings in this thread.\n\nIf you experience any new issues, please report them and tell us what software version (including macOS version, involved applications, etc) you're using.\n:warning: This is a beta version! Make backups and don't use this version for production data. :warning: . Yes Cryptomator is case sensitive and allows two sibling files with same name but different cases. Therefore the following behavior works as (currently) designed.\n- PROPFIND appbarfunctions.cs -> 207\n- GET AppBarFunctions.cs -> 404\nThat said, I think it is possible to optionally allow \"fuzzy matching\" read requests.\n. > How will Windows handle X:\\a.log and X:\\A.log if it is a case-insensitive OS?\nWill have to test that \ud83d\ude09  Don't know if both files appear on a WebDAV mount. Neither do I know if this would still work with Dokany (#207)...\n. Can you retest this with 1.2.2? Mounting has not changed, but there have been problems with our CSPRNG.\n. Ok thanks for the feedback. So I will close this issue now.\n. This issue was moved to cryptomator/cryptomator-win#2\n. We updated sanitizer to detect unauthentic files.\nPlease rerun the check with Sanitizer 0.3\n. yes, any UI interaction should be in the main thread. but no, this doesn't explain the stackoverflow error (imho).\n. Closing the issue for now, as the 1.2.1 fix seems to work :-)\n. This issue occurs on vaults originally created with iOS. Back then there was an error in writing the correct version MAC.\nTo solve this you might use the older Cryptomator version 1.1.4 and change its password (by right-clicking on the list entry while it is locked). You can \"change\" the password without actually changing it. Then the correct MAC will get calculated and stored for future versions that might need to prevent downgrade attacks.\n. Reopen this issue if you experience any problems ;-)\n. @Palador42 @rkrx Can you please check the solution proposed in Ticket #210 by Cycor and post the two registry values mentioned there?. @ewirch Can you send us a few encrypted file names, please? Are there files with file extensions or something similar?. This has been implemented in Cryptomator 1.3.0.. @vvoody There is now a checkmark in the unlock screen that allows you to control it.. > users expect that these file names remain unavailable\nFair point.\n@dodekeract this affects all operating systems. If you want an ad-hoc fix, you can configure the log file to be stored to /dev/null or similar.\nUsually I'd say that Cryptomator's sole purpose is to protect data which leaves the device, but as this is a fairly easy thing to fix and you're totally right about the user's expectation this should indeed get fixed with one of the next minor releases.\n. Fixed in fe86b4c. Today we released our first beta of 1.4.0, which brings FUSE support to macOS and Linux.\nPlease retest this issue with FUSE enabled and report your findings in this thread.\n\nIf you experience any new issues, please report them and tell us what software version (including macOS version, involved applications, etc) you're using.\n:warning: This is a beta version! Make backups and don't use this version for production data. :warning: . Unlike classical server-side 2FA (which only need to check one-time passwords for correctness) we need to feed such additional factors into the key derivation function. Just checking the correctness of such tokens isn't feasible, as an attacker might write a software, which simply skips this step. And adding one-time tokens into the KDF would produce different keys during each unlock.\nThat said, a persistent second factor (might be combined/related to #290) might work.\n. @Piratbyran to be clear: you tried it with ajaxbrowser?\n. @FlxVctr this is interesting. This might be an indicator, that the leak occurs during scrypt key derivation. Would you mind verifying this if I provide a simple test program that invokes scrypt a few times?\n. @FlxVctr Well the UI is JavaFX-based, which isn't really mature on all OS yet. Quite possible there is a leak there.\n. As the heap size is clearly limited (java -Xmx512m), this might be an upstream bug in Java or JavaFX for Linux.. Anyone having this issue: It would be great if you test whether this also occurs with the CLI version of Cryptomator. It is still in beta, but we assume that the leak occurs in the UI. Any verification would be of great help!. @njmckenzie I'll update the CLI version to match the new vault format now. Please watch the CLI repo to get notified.. @njmckenzie good news, thanks for sharing this. We didn\u2018t actively change anything other than the Java version.. Problem 1 (Error 53) has happened before for some users (see ticket #210). We have noe clue why some Windows installations behave this way. Thats one reason why we currently switch to Dokany (#207).\nThat said, you are the first user who confirms that the Vault is accessible via Windows Explorer but NOT via robocopy. So far Error 53 always occured while mounting the WebDAV drive.\nProblem 2+3 is very unlikely to be caused by Cryptomator. Can you please retest those using a 3rd party WebDAV drive, such as a Testfolder provided by IT Hit WebDAV Server (simply use the URL on the right of that Website and mount it on your PC)?\nProblem 4 also needs to be retested using an independent WebDAV implementation. We use different Unicode Normalization Forms on different operating systems (see issue #264). Maybe such a normalization is needed for Windows, too.\n. Ok then we need to analyze this. Funny thing is that we have no path length limit... Are there any WebDAV errors in the log file when attempting to add that file?\n. We've released version 1.4.0-beta2, which introduces Dokany support. You now have the choice between Dokany and WebDAV based virtual hard drives.\nPlease retest this issue using Dokany-based volumes. Keep in mind this is beta software, though. Make your backups. \ud83d\ude09. ~~Btw: If you migrate manually, i.e. dragging files out of the vault using 1.1.4 and dropping them into a new 1.2.0 vault, you'd most likely keep at least the creation dates (provided that Windows passes these information on to the WebDAV mount).\nAt least worth a try.~~\nJust read, that you've already proposed this :D\n. @RiseT regarding your last question: We have no idea. I guess it depends on the sync client. I personally assume, that there are several sync clients, which solely look at the name + modification date.\n. Hint: If you use the webupd8 PPA, you can simply apt-get install oracle-java8-unlimited-jce-policy\n. @fredericchamp nope the PPA version doesn't include a JVM (this is not possible due to restrictions of the PPA build servers), tobihagemann was mistaken. The ancient key length restrictions of Oracle's JDK are the reason why we depend on OpenJDK instead. Maybe there is a chance to reconfigure the PPA package in a way that the user can choose either openjdk or oracle + unlimited-jce-thing.\n. @markuskreusch \n\nShall we shedule this issue for an upcoming release?\n\nNot yet. Feel free to start working on this, but I don't want to promise new features for the next release, as we have more urgent issues (i.e. bugs) as well as the Java 9 migration.. Are you aware, that there are no asymmetric keys in Cryptomator?\n. Still don't understand what you're suggesting. Have you looked at our encryption scheme? Neither are there any EC, RSA or whatever other public key based algorithms nor do we use any non-standard mechanisms that need special libraries that aren't already provided by JCE.\n. We encrypt-then-mac, which is (using CTR mode) mathematically simpler to analyze then AEAD (however slower then e.g. GCM if benchmarked under same conditions).\nDon't know where I said that NaCl is non-standard. But ignoring all that salesman stuff I assume your point is to allow different ciphers? That is discussed in #302.\n. I assume you mean private keys. Who provides that key to Cryptomator in a way that it solves autounlock?\n. Well you found issue #40, so you should be aware that we know about OS keyrings. If you had tried Cryptomator, you might have noticed, we're already using them on Win/Mac.\nSo basically you suggest storing a key instead of a passphrase in the same exact keyring with the same level of protection. What does it solve?\n. @heinrich-ulbricht yes, you should be able to mount that URL as a WebDAV drive. Cryptomator invokes net use * \\\\localhost@12345\\DavWWWRoot\\TsaBtPCcA1Tn\\Documents /persistent:no, which you can also do via CMD.\nPROPFIND should indeed work on that resource. Are you sure that the given response belongs to that URL? If so, this is an important hint for us.\n. Seems to be same reason as in ticket #210. Closing as duplicate.. @shie-erlich take a look at this comment by Cycor. Probably some program screwed up your \"network provider order\".. > cyberduck feels like an ftp client, in the sense that files are downloaded rather than mapped. is that correct ?\nYes, but there is also a very neat app called Mountain Duck based on Cyberduck technology, which mounts volumes rather than providing an up-/download window.. @tsesis can you check your firewall settings, too? Cryptomator needs to contact https://cryptomator.org/downloads/latestVersion.json (if \"check for update\" is enabled) as well as localhost (for the loopback WebDAV connection).\n. @markuskreusch in fact you introduced the asyncTaskService. The commit message suggests, you had error handling in mind. Before that it was a plain try-catch block, which silently failed in case of network problems. No idea what side effects the async task service might have here.. Probably something on the main thread, otherwise I don't see a reason, the JVM terminates.... But if a user unchecks the box and relies on it being erased, he might have a false sense of security. Any other user on the PC could then still access the data.\n. I'd rather like to see a confirmation dialog when trying to uncheck the checkbox. That way we could keep the checkbox (more consistent than replacing it by a button) but still warn the user about the consequences and providing a chance to cancel.\n. This is a duplicate of issue #295.\n. @markuskreusch Isn't this closed by d48247b? Or are you still evaluating win/mac options?. > Unlocked: Padlock icon on the right\nSo lock means \"unlocked\"? \ud83d\ude15 \n. \n. Duplicate of #225\n. no worries\n. How did you install Cryptomator? Via PPA?\n. What's the output of java -version? The ppa should have installed the dependencies openjre and openjfx, but apparently there was a problem.\n. Cryptomator has not been tested with Java 9. Have you made sure, JavaFX (openjfx) is installed?\n. Good to know. Thanks for testing it. Closing issue.\n. Duplicate of #295\n. Cryptomator 1.2.1 has been submitted to Symantec's whitelist program, but it may take weeks to add it. Apparently AV softwares are no longer checking for actual threats but rather block anything they don't know yet, so there is nothing we can currently do about it than wait.\n. Can you please send us the upgrade log (~/.Cryptomator/upgrade.log)? Please search and replace the contained path to your vault, if you don't want us to see it.\n. With 1.5.0 we will change the icon library, therefore this needs to be retested afterwards.. Duplicate of #40 \n. We've already discussed this over here. The problem is, that the mobile apps contain API keys from the cloud storage providers and can not be fully open source. Our best effort here is the \"open core\" model with at least the crypto part being FOSS. Thus we don't qualify for F-Droid.\nHowever we might be able to release a \"WebDAV-only App\" over there in the future.\n. Don't worry! Can't hurt to have an issue in the Cryptomator main GitHub repo, too.\n. @andriyze Both packages have the same bundled Gson library. Please post the json contents of masterkey.cryptomator otherwise we can not reproduce the error.. @pwoehrer this is a different error, yours is caused by not having the JCE policy files installed. Assuming you're using Oracle JDK via webupd8, you can do so by apt-get install oracle-java8-unlimited-jce-policy.. I noticed that on one of my test systems the invokation of gvfs-mount ... failed with \"volume doesn't implement mount\", while sh -c \"gvfs-mount ...\" ran perfectly.\nApparently there is some environment variable influencing the gvfs-mount. @abstract-thinking and @podkilla do you have anything in your ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc file that might differ from a standard installation?. What if the user actually wants to unlock the vault with the pre-filled static text, though?. There are requests to the vault, so at least it seems to be mounted. It may however be possible the drive is not properly revealed.. Duplicate of #513. > PS: I've seen several Excel related problems with Cryptomator here, but not this one.\nyep, this one is new and would definitely make it into the top 10 list of strangest bugs :D. As you can see this issue is scheduled for 1.5.0, which will be a release solely focused on UI and desktop integration issues. Before we start development, we will have at least one more 1.4.x release, though.. We've released our first beta of 1.4.0, which brings FUSE support to macOS and Linux.\nPlease retest this issue with FUSE enabled and report your findings in this thread.\n\nIf you experience any new issues, please report them and tell us what software version (including macOS version, linux kernel, display manager, desktop environment) you're using.\n:warning: This is a beta version! Make backups and don't use this version for production data. :warning: . Good news, everyone! We've released version 1.4.0-beta2, which introduces Dokany support. You now have the choice between Dokany and WebDAV based virtual hard drives.\nPlease retest this issue with Dokany enabled.. requirements in spec file:\nRequires: ld-linux.so.2 libX11.so.6 libXext.so.6 libXi.so.6 libXrender.so.1 libXtst.so.6 libasound.so.2 libc.so.6 libdl.so.2 libgcc_s.so.1 libm.so.6 libpthread.so.0 libthread_db.so.1. @HeikoAdams I have no experience in creating rpm packages. The above code is from Oracle's JavaFX packager. Can you provide some documentation or even better example spec files?. I personally have not the slightest idea of how RPM dependencies work. I found, that packages like libXi exist in both, the i386 and x86_64 repo, both having the i686 architecture in their names.\nSame for the other aforementioned dependencies.\nHelp wanted by someone who works with RPM-based distributions.. > Will someone be working on this in the near future?\nNope currently I'm not aware of somebody working on it.  Do you have some experience with Gnome Keyring (which is probably most widespread)? We can invoke virtually any command line programs via Java.. @frafl thanks for providing this patch. As you suggested we will rather go for a \"real\" keychain integration than adding this patch to the code base, but your patch should be stable until we make changes to the storage path due to #710, so please keep this in mind.. > If I do not upgrade Cryptomator from the patch, to a version where you change storage, is there any reason I should not do that?\nWhile I encourage you to keep Cryptomator up-to-date, there is nothing wrong in building it from sources with the patch applied.\nOnce you move to a newer version that is no longer compatible to the patch, the worst thing that can happen is that you have to re-enter your password, so better don't forget it. :wink:. @frafl regarding the build with JDK 11, please follow #769.. > the correct place for a libsecret binding would be the native-functions repo, correct?\nyes\n\nAnother question: libsecret is by no means universal, Kubuntu 18.10 does not seem to include it by default (no dependency of plasma-desktop IIRC).\n\nThat is the problem with the different distros and the reason why we haven't implemented this feature yet.\n\nIf one adds a LinuxFunctions.so to the .jar that is linked against libsecret.so, Java could still catch the link error due to missing libsecret.so, right?\n\nI assume so, but I'm not an expert on this field. Code should be written very defensively here. The isSupported() method should take care of such preconditions.. @Richard-Payne @JohnyKay Can you retest this with the 1.4.x branch?. Might be implicitly fixed by #461, as we're now using the change passphrase implementation of CryptoLib, which writes the same version into the changed masterkey, that has been read from it beforehand.\n@tobihagemann Am I correct with my assumption? Please review.\nHowever, we should make sure that future CryptorProvider implementations do not accidentially read a legacy KeyFile, they don't understand any longer. This might be a new task for CryptoLib.. > application level checks mean more bugs and risks are exposed\nAck. We're about to revert to the original implementation, wich binds to localhost only. On our cryptofs branch it is already fixed.\nIn the past we needed the 0.0.0.0 binding for Windows, as apparently IPv6 loopback connections are allowed if the sockets binds to \"localhost\", leading to mounting errors.\nIf you know of an actual exploit, please send us an email and reopen this issue. Otherwise we consider this \"just\" an additional risk for implementation mistakes. As it is already fixed, no hotfix is required here.. > try mounting some other free webdav services available in internet \ne.g. https://webdavserver.com (will redirect you to a temporary resource, that can be mounted). Please retest this with Cryptomator 1.4.0-beta1, which brings FUSE support to macOS and Linux.\n:warning: This is a beta version! Make backups and don't use this version for production data. :warning: . @tobihagemann: The support article is not really applicable here, since on Arch the JVM is not bundled and isolated but rather a dependency to a system-wide Java installation. Thus @yogo1212's point of installing potentially vulnerable libraries, that can be used from other processes, is legitimate.. Update: Beginning with Cryptomator 1.4.0 we will distribute the Linux package as an AppImage that does not depend on external libraries. Also we will use JDK 9 and jlink to include only those packages we really rely on, i.e. no webkit.\nOh yes, and it'll have FUSE.. Not an option.\n\nThe reason is: A user has reported that the registry entry gets modified after every restart. I understand that it could be tedious to re-run the installer after every restart.\n\nI think the user has to uninstall whatever is messing up her registry and file a bug report.. What Java version are you using? no suitable method found for collect(java.util.stream.Collector<java.lang.Object,capture#1 of ?, java.util.List<java.lang.Object>>) looks like the compiler is having issues determining the type of the Collector, which is a known bug for version below (I think) 8u51.. I expect this to be fixed with out current architectural refactoring, which also affects the way settings are handled.. > Cryptomator however refuses to open it (the open button is greyed out)\nDo you mean in the \"open\" dialog when adding an existing vault to the list? You have to select the masterkey.cryptomator file, as the dialog is not capable of recognizing the directory as a vault.. Glad it worked out, still we might need to find a way to clarify what needs to be selected.. You have two problems here:\n\nIllegal key size or default parameters means your JDK is missing the JCE Unlimted Strength Policy files.\nNot a JSON Object your masterkey.cryptomator is apparently syntactically broken (please post it here - you may change the contents first). > you don't provide regular binary files like in the past\n\nDon't know what you mean by this. We have never changed the packages for Windows.. > How could we rsync stuff into Cryptomator containers without the webdav/davfs2 overhead then?\nFUSE support is scheduled for the next major version. \ud83d\ude09 . Should be a fairly easy task, once we finished the current refactoring :-). To create encrypted images of your whole disk there are more specialized programs. I would not recommend Cryptomator for this purpose.. Thanks! :). We've released our first beta of 1.4.0, which brings FUSE support to macOS and Linux.\nPlease retest this issue with FUSE enabled and report your findings in this thread.\n\nIf you experience any new issues, please report them and tell us what software version (including macOS version, linux kernel, display manager, desktop environment) you're using.\n:warning: This is a beta version! Make backups and don't use this version for production data. :warning: . @m-p-3 see #787. Closed by 8359deb. @jdphog Apparently it is, but beware of #579!. Today we released our first beta of 1.4.0, which brings FUSE support to macOS and Linux.\nPlease retest this issue with FUSE enabled and report your findings in this thread.\n\nIf you experience any new issues, please report them and tell us what software version (including macOS version, involved applications, etc) you're using.\n:warning: This is a beta version!

No more Oracle JDK updates screwing up the JCE policy files. But the key size limitations will be gone with Java 9 anyway. Nevertheless handy to have all dependencies under control.. @ksthiele we haven't investigated yet. Any system that allows us to provide one installer for multiple distributions would be great. If you have experience with one of them, feel free to post any advice.. After taking a closer look at AppImage, Snap and Flatpak, we decided to use AppImage. We will automate the build steps using a new repo: cryptomator/cryptomator-linux.. @yassir-a-p Adjusting 1.3.x to the new CI pipelines we use for the AppImage build will take us longer than releasing 1.4.0. Looking at the issues for 1.4.0 I think we\u2018re about to release within 2-3 weeks.. This is because CryptoFS considers a directory containing a vault if and only if both, the masterkey and the d directory, exist.\nSee code.\nNeeds to be changed in CryptoFS. @cryptomator/collaborators further thoughts about what we define as \"valid vault\" in the future?. We decided, we will leave it as is. Cryptomator checks for both, the masterkey file as well as the d directory. Users trying to migrate a vault without a d directory have no data to lose, so we can safely ask them to just delete and re-create the vault.. Closing this as duplicate of #72.\nWindows has a size limit of 4GiB, when using WebDAV. Workarounds are\n Using an alternative WebDAV client, see #73 \n Wait until we've aded Dokany support, see #206 . We will release 1.4.0-beta2 shortly, which will contain a preview of Dokany support.. @honeymanfr can you please retest this with 1.4.0-beta2?. > How do I enable bin can ?\nThere is no official way yet, but a guide is linked from issue #566.\n\nWhat should I choose out of WebDav, Fuse or Dokany ?\n\nOn Windows choose Dokany.. Duplicate of #622. I know this issue was there first, but there has been more activity in the other one ;-). It\u2018s on my list of issues that will receive a \u201eretest with 1.4.0-beta2\u201c comment within the next days ;-). @Strubbl Killing will not harm your files, as long as there is no write in progress. Lock the vaults before killing the app, if you want to be sure.\nStill I think we should investigate, why there is no menu. On OS X I quit the application via Cmd+Q, which is the default shortcut, that is also shown in the menu.. Retesting with HEAD required. Jetty, Jackrabbit and a lot in the WebDAV stack has changed.. Depends on WebDAV-NIO-Adapter issue 5.. We received reports, that this has been fixed with 10.12.5 Beta 3 (16F60a) (@wangkesen is that you?^^).\n@mirror1337 Can you confirm this?. We've released our first beta of 1.4.0, which brings FUSE support to macOS and Linux.\nPlease retest this issue with FUSE enabled and report your findings in this thread.\n\nIf you experience any new issues, please report them and tell us what software version (including macOS version, linux kernel, display manager, desktop environment) you're using.\n:warning: This is a beta version! Make backups and don't use this version for production data. :warning: . Good news, everyone! We've released version 1.4.0-beta2, which introduces Dokany support. You now have the choice between Dokany and WebDAV based virtual hard drives.\nPlease retest this issue with Dokany enabled.. Duplicate of #40 . @Cysign you're missing the -jar part in java sanitizer-0.11.jar check -vault C:/users/[username]/Google Drive/di. > How can files be missing as it worked prior to this?\nmaybe you have multiple JRE installations and the one used in java -jar ... is not JCE-patched.. Your new JRE is missing the JCE unlimited strength policy extensions, that are needed to use 256 bit keys. Don't know how to include them in Iced Tea. In Oracle's JRE you could have invoked apt-get install oracle-java8-unlimited-jce-policy via the webupd8 ppa.. Will add mkdir to postinst.. Oh, you're right :). Duplicate of #418!. Can you please check the registry entries as described by Cycor in this comment?. 1.3.0 chooses the IPv6 stack automatically. Have you tried disabling it in the app settings? Note that it will get restored after each restart of the application in the RC version.\n@cryptomator/collaborators It's worth noting, that we get Error 67: The network name cannot be found, not Error 53: The network path was not found. The latter one seems to have vanished.. Got another log file via support mail. User tried both, IPv4 and IPv6:\n\nLog File\n\n```\n2017-05-15 10:33:53,186 INFO  [Cryptomator:21] Starting Cryptomator 1.3.0-rc5 on Windows 7 6.1 (amd64)\n[...]\n2017-05-15 10:38:18,640 INFO  [WebDavServletController:51] WebDavServlet started: /jYAXrG9uTQid/cryptomator\n2017-05-15 10:38:18,641 INFO  [WebDavServletController:94] Mounting http://[::1]:40000/jYAXrG9uTQid/cryptomator using org.cryptomator.frontend.webdav.mount.WindowsMounter\n2017-05-15 10:38:18,872 ERROR [UnlockController:391] Unlock failed for technical reasons.\norg.cryptomator.frontend.webdav.mount.Mounter$CommandFailedException: Command failed with exit code 2.

After Cryptomator has been whitelisted, the issue was resolved. So this isn't related to 1.3.0, as it would have also affected previous versions (at least this is what I assume).. @berniecube and @aromes reported the same issue (see #503).\nWe have a modified snapshot build for Windows 64 bit ready, that allows us to log details about the requests Windows is making to Cryptomator during the connection of the WebDAV drive. If you would like to help us investigating this issue, please create a support ticket via our ticket system with the subject \"1.3.0-rc5 Error 67\".\nThank you! \ud83e\udd16 \ud83d\udc4d . @aromes reported:\n\nI have 4 vaults. I used it in 2 and it works fine. But I tried to open the two vaults left (by assigning an unused drive letter) and it failed. Now when I try to open these vault (even after restart the app), it's failing no matter I use options or not.\n\nSo while it fails most times, it does work in some cases. This is a hint we're dealing with some kind of race condition here.. We have a new RC build available, that hopefully solves this issue. You can download it here for win 64 bit and here for win 32 bit.\nIf you can confirm the fix, please let us know!. This is actually error 67. 2 is just the exit code by the net use command. But I understand the confusion \ud83d\ude09 \n```\nL'erreur syst?me 67 s'est produite.\nNom de r?seau introuvable.\n```\nThus I am closing this as a duplicate of #502. See instructions in 502, if you'd like to help analyzing this :). Apparently this is how move works. See this Stackoverflow answer.\nIf you want to \"move\" across drive boundaries, you have to copy and delete your folder.. Does your NAS support running Docker containers? That might be another option to make CLI run.\nWhile this might work and we of course allow and encourage the use of Cryptomator in any setups, we do not offer any support for it.. We should consider adding an alternative davfs-based mounter, that gets selected automatically when Cryptomator is running with root privileges. I don't like the idea of leaving user-space, though. Maybe we can invoke just the mount command using sudo? Is there any cross-distribution way to request sudo permissions from the user via GUI?. We've released our first beta of 1.4.0, which brings FUSE support to macOS and Linux.\nPlease retest this issue with FUSE enabled and report your findings in this thread.\n\nIf you experience any new issues, please report them and tell us what software version (including macOS version, involved applications, etc) you're using.\n:warning: This is a beta version! Make backups and don't use this version for production data. :warning: . Duplicate of #501.. Please retest with 1.3.0-rc8.. @An-error-occurred If I undestood you correctly, another way to report your error would be \"Office files stored in a vault don't open, when I'm offline\". If you agree, I'd like you to open a different issue, even though I'm pretty sure it's an upstream bug caused by Office.\nPS we get tons of emails, not sure which one is yours ;) But we didn't receive any log within the last 15min.. Please retest with 1.3.0-rc9.. We need to resolve WebDAV-NIO-Adapter's issue 8. If you have any idea how to detect whether a system prefers dav: or webdav: or http:, please comment on that issue! :)\nBtw I thought we were using xdg-open, however it seems like we're invoking gvfs-open (see code)... Not sure what is more common...?. > gvfs-open never accepts the syntax with the prefix \"webdav://\" for the protocol, but always and only \"dav://\".\nThats not entirely true. Apparently it passes on the URL to the file manager. This comment is very interesting.. We've released our first beta of 1.4.0, which brings FUSE support to macOS and Linux.\nPlease retest this issue with FUSE enabled and report your findings in this thread.\n\nIf you experience any new issues, please report them and tell us what software version (including macOS version, linux kernel, display manager, desktop environment) you're using.\n:warning: This is a beta version! Make backups and don't use this version for production data. :warning: . Great to hear! There is already an issue for the small window: #656.. @thewinner666 @RebelCoderRU Since webdav scheme isn't properly supported by the file managers of all Linux distros, we are unable to universally fix this for 1.3.x. \"Me too\" comments regarding 1.3.x don't help if you're unwilling to read the whole conversation: As confirmed above, this issue is resolved in 1.4.0.\nGiven the fact that no new issues have been reported for the 1.4.0 betas under Linux, we consider it stable and recommend you to use 1.4.0-beta3.. This feature is already implemented and will be released in version 1.3.0. You can get an RC build on the GitHub releases page.\nEdit by @tobihagemann: Duplicate of #143. As you've installed via the PPA, a JRE dependency should be present. Can you please make sure, the JCE unlimited strength policy is installed? If you're using Oracle Java 8 via webupd8, please also apt-get install oracle-java8-unlimited-jce-policy.. Can you check, if the masterkey.cryptomator inside your vault's storage location is syntactically correct json?. > If I can ask a favour, could you please label this issue and also issues #402 #432 #466 with os:linux\nDone.\n1.3.0 will check the presence of unlimited jce policy beforehand, so you should get a better error message.\nClosing this issue as resolved.. There is a CLI version under development, that might suit your needs. . Just updated CLI version to our newest libraries :-) Closing this issue as we can't provide further information.\nFor reports from Cryptomator users on FreeBSD please ask in a forum, they will probably not follow this issue.. Good news, everyone! We've released version 1.4.0-beta2, which introduces Dokany support. You now have the choice between Dokany and WebDAV based virtual hard drives.\nPlease retest this issue with Dokany enabled.. This is currently \"by design\" as we are evaluating Windows' behaviour with ipv6 loopback mounts during the RC phase. We will probably remove this setting, depending on the results of issue #512.. If we remove the option, it will become 100% IPv4. Don't use an RC, if you need a stable solution right now ;-). IPv6 just got removed with commit 9d2aa62.. Removed in 1.3.0-rc8.. I'd rather migrate the vault format now. It is a fairly easy migration (only affecting the masterkey file) and a clean solution. During migration we can try all existing normalization forms.\nI wonder, if NFC is the best choice here. What happens, if further composed letters are introduces with a future unicode version? NFD will most likely always stay the same. But probably this doesn't matter, as the unicode standard has thought about this:\n\nIt is crucial that Normalization Forms remain stable over time. That is, if a string that does not have any unassigned characters is normalized under one version of Unicode, it must remain normalized under all future versions of Unicode.\n\n-- http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/#Versioning. Resolved by CryptoFS 1.4.0.. Just released and signed 1.2.5, will continue doing so. Thanks for the hint :). you mean .deb and .rpm?. Oh my bad. Will need to add that, too.. Added signature for antkit.tar.gz using this key.. > You commited the private key....\n... which is encrypted using a pretty long generated password. You can't expect me to sign the artifacts during build without using any private key. :wink:. > First of all travis enables you to provide encrypted files in a SANE manner. https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encrypting-files/\nTravis file encryption doesn't use better ciphers than gpg2 itself.\n\nSecond of all env variables can leak. So providing the passphrase in that manner is barley even secure.\n\nTravis file encryption still needs a key. Why shouldn't the env var leak that is used for file decryption? \ud83e\udd14\nBtw we generated a new key pair solely for CI. It is short-lived and only capable of signing. If it did leak we would still be able to revoke it.\n\nProviding the private key in ANY forms voids it of any security. This is not how PGP works, and not how you should do signed release.\n\nThen how? Happy to hear any alternatives.\nTo my knowledge, you can not sign anything without a private key. So sadly this is how PGP works.\nKeep in mind, that after all the whole point of signing a binary release is not to prove it is build by its author but rather that it is a legitimate and unmodified build built in a transparent process from verifiable sources.\nTherefore ideally only the CI system should be in possession of the private key, not even the developer. But as long as Travis doesn't provide any means of signing artifacts, we can only do it manually.. Can you start Cryptomator via Terminal and post any logs?. @andriyze Good to know, that the PPA works in general. You are probably using Oracle Java 8 without unlimited strength policy files, see https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/402#issuecomment-264975081 for an easy solution.\nSo we need to focus on the .deb file. It is currently built on da Debian 7 machine with jdk1.8.0_112. Lets try incrementing these versions one by one. Anyone willing to test this x64 built of 1.3.0-rc7 with the latest JRE?. Apparently the same problem occurs with other applications. Seems like the new kernel handles stacks differently.\nA temporary workaround until we release an update\nPlease edit /opt/Cryptomator/app/Cryptomator.cfg and add -Xss2m to the JVMOptions, so it looks like this:\ndiff\n[JVMOptions]\n+ -Xss2m\n -Xmx512m\n -Dcryptomator.logPath=...\nIf you can confirm this workaround, we will publish a hotfix.. Hotfix release 1.2.5 is now available on our downloads page. If you have already patched your /opt/Cryptomator/app/Cryptomator.cfg, you will not need this update. No other fixes included.. @rmti haha great workaround :D Sometimes Windows is simply insane. Thanks for sharing!. Good news, everyone! We've released version 1.4.0-beta2, which introduces Dokany support. You now have the choice between Dokany and WebDAV based virtual hard drives.\nPlease retest this issue with Dokany enabled.. We need further testing on this issue. I have tried to play around with the internet security options as advised here, however without success so far. Tried to add 127.0.0.1 and file://127.0.0.1 to the whitelist. Maybe this isn't sufficient or one has to restart the machine in between?. Update: We've mitigated this problem by adding an alias for 127.0.0.1 to the hosts file and mounting the drive via net use * \\\\alias@42427\\DavWWWRoot\\asdqwe123\\vaultname.\nWill now need to update the installer to add this alias and the mounter to use it.\nEdit: We will provide an RC9 download link shortly.. Fixed with 1.3.0-rc9.. net use is invoked with /perstistent:no by the mounter.\nI'm not sure if this is actually a remembered network drive or rather some windows \"recently used\" feature showing whatever it had contact with in the past. I.e. I assume that other hosts will also show up, even if they got removed from the network.. It is no longer dual-signed with both SHA-256 and SHA-1 digests. We removed the latter, as announced in our release notes.\nAs you're using a fully patched Win 10 installations, you should be able to process SHA-256 signatures.\n```\n$ signtool verify /pa /v Cryptomator-1.3.0-x64.exe\nVerifying: Cryptomator-1.3.0-x64.exe\nSignature Index: 0 (Primary Signature)\nHash of file (sha256): 6330CCB559A959B4459F2DAD053568CC2CC9A218971968A3ED2EA53F2B4516C4\nSigning Certificate Chain:\n    Issued to: Certum Trusted Network CA\n    Issued by: Certum Trusted Network CA\n    Expires:   Mon Dec 31 14:07:37 2029\n    SHA1 hash: 07E032E020B72C3F192F0628A2593A19A70F069E\n    Issued to: Certum Code Signing CA SHA2\n    Issued by: Certum Trusted Network CA\n    Expires:   Wed Jun 09 13:30:29 2027\n    SHA1 hash: 905DE119F6A0118CFFBF8B69463EFE5BD0C1D322\n\n        Issued to: Open Source Developer, Sebastian Stenzel\n        Issued by: Certum Code Signing CA SHA2\n        Expires:   Fri Apr 27 02:00:00 2018\n        SHA1 hash: BAF9137F110811A5251BEB9BD6A929C2CC73E19C\n\nThe signature is timestamped: Sat Jul 01 15:07:39 2017\nTimestamp Verified by:\n    Issued to: UTN-USERFirst-Object\n    Issued by: UTN-USERFirst-Object\n    Expires:   Tue Jul 09 20:40:36 2019\n    SHA1 hash: E12DFB4B41D7D9C32B30514BAC1D81D8385E2D46\n    Issued to: COMODO SHA-1 Time Stamping Signer\n    Issued by: UTN-USERFirst-Object\n    Expires:   Tue Jul 09 20:40:36 2019\n    SHA1 hash: 03A5B14663EB12023091B84A6D6A68BC871DE66B\n\nSuccessfully verified: Cryptomator-1.3.0-x64.exe\nNumber of files successfully Verified: 1\nNumber of warnings: 0\nNumber of errors: 0\n``.

Who knows. Anyway problem solved \u263a\ufe0f. @Bodup that seems correct. Will need to check how to do this. This would be a task for the installer project. But as signatures aren't checked by Windows during application start anyway, it does not really add any benefit, does it?. please add further notes to cryptomator-win issue 5.. Relevant part from log: System Error 53 after invoking net use.. Does it work, when you set the port to 80 (requires Cryptomator to run with Admin privileges)?\nSee this post by koczkatamas for more details. Tam\u00e1s also opened this windows bug report that you might want to upvote.. Closing issue, as upstream bug has been solved.. Good news, everyone! We've released version 1.4.0-beta2, which introduces Dokany support. You now have the choice between Dokany and WebDAV based virtual hard drives.\nPlease retest this issue with Dokany enabled.. It's like diesel vs petrol. Two different technologies to provide a virtual hard disk drive in your Explorer. WebDAV is the technology we've been using for years. It is more mature but has its limits. Dokany promises to fix a lot of bugs but adds complexity to the system. For further discussion on the pros and cons please use our forums as we want to keep this issue focused on the command line issues.. @GeertHauwaerts your issue might be related to #774. I think, @infeo has already published a snapshot version with various Dokany fixes, but I'm not quite sure in which issue this has been adressed.. Patched in cryptomator-win commit 4f817ef.. > Adding 127.0.0.1 cryptomator-vault to the hosts file doesn't work for me. I'll test the patch if it is available for me. Could I download the pathed version anywhere?\nYou have probably added a tab or multiple whitespaces between ip and hostname. The installer looks for that exact line.\nPS: We got confirmations that fixing the hosts file manually works. But we're still clueless, what other application blocks access to it in the first place.. We wanted to updated the notification anyway. How about:\n\nUnable to write to C:...\\etc\\hosts. This file might be protected, e.g. by an anti-virus tool. To improve compatibility with Windows, we'd advise you to add this line manually:\n127.0.0.1 cryptomator-vault\nYou can edit the hosts file by starting a text editor in admin mode.\nInstallation will continue after pressing OK.. Recommending to disable AV doesn't make an installer seem very trustworthy. I'd rather explain what the installer is trying to accomplish.\nAlso there might be users having multiple malware protection applications, who disable their AV but having the hosts file still protected by some other software.\n\nIf they fail to write the file even with notepad in admin mode, the hint that their AV is interfering might help them sort out the problem without trusting an installer that could do virtually anything with no malware protection running. . > but I thought I'd mention it anyway. Maybe it\u2019s just a small fix.\nThanks! \ud83d\udcaa \nUI is mostly styled with CSS. Maybe there is something over here that we can make use of.. Will be fixed by implementing webdav-nio-adapter 0.6.3.. webdav-nio-adapter 1.0.0 has been added in f84bb47.. Fix needs to be applied in a different place, thus we're postponing this issue to the next release.. Fixed in CryptoFS Commit 8d31680, need update of CryptoFS in Cryptomator in order to close this.. What was your previous version of Cryptomator? The update from 1.2.3+ to 1.3.x doesn't touch any files but the masterkey file, so the conflict file must have either been there before or been caused by an updater from a previous vault format.. Then the conflicting file has not been created by the migration, as it doesn't migrate any files but only the masterkey. I.e. the conflict must have been there before or appeared due to delayed synchronization.. Possible solution: https://stackoverflow.com/a/21383865/4014509. We've released our first beta of 1.4.0, which brings FUSE support to macOS and Linux.\nPlease retest this issue with FUSE enabled and report your findings in this thread.\n\nIf you experience any new issues, please report them and tell us what software version (including macOS version, involved applications, etc) you're using.\n:warning: This is a beta version!

We will compile Cryptomator against JDK 9 within the next few days and upload it as an alpha version to test if this will fix it.\nUpdate: Some of our dependencies, especially Dagger, are not yet ready for Java 9. Thus it will take a little longer... \ud83d\ude22 . @sysilion I created issue #590 for jdk9 related discussion.. @seanatcesa we don't have the time to maintain a fork. We need to have it published in Maven Central, otherwise our CI builds will not work. It is not as easy as just compiling it locally with the PR merged. Maybe the --patch-module approach works for us. We have to try.. If the root cause is the same as in issue #592, a fixed CryptoFS might solve this issue. In that case there will be no need to wait for Dagger and Java 9.. We've published a patch for the OneDrive problem. Please try if that patch works for Google Drive File Stream, too. Instructions in our forum.. The backport is available for JDK 8u91 which is available since early 2016. Cryptomator 1.3.1 runs on 8u141 (regardless of what version Travis CI uses). So either the fix doesn't work or we're looking at the wrong issue.. > Any updates on whether this will be fixed soon?\nI totally understand you are eager to know when it's fixed. But I need to ask you to be appreciative for the fact that we can't tell you any specific point in time. Bugfixing isn't just \"fixing\" bugs. 99% of the work is finding the cause of a bug and understanding why it happens. The fix itself can often be fairly easy.. If anyone wants to test this with JDK 9, there is a Cryptomator jar build temporarily available here. You need to manually install JDK 9 and execute java -jar Cryptomator.1.4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar.\nIn case you're getting java.lang.IllegalStateException: Required key length not supported., you might need to patch your JDK9/conf/security/java.security file and uncomment #crypto.policy=unlimited.\n  . As soon as this release is available for all users, please let us know if this issue is resolved.. @IlCarlett81 Can you try deleting ~/AppData/Roaming/Cryptomator/ipcPort.bin?. well I think the ipc module should be able to resolve this itself ;) reopening.. > I am trying to transfer a 15 Gb file to my Google \nYou can do so using any software other than Windows Explorer, because only Windows Explorer has this 4GiB limit. By now you can even use Cyberduck to directly access the vault stored in the cloud (and it's faster in copying files than Windows Explorer, too).\n\nwhy not keep files as an actual vault sort of like Kaspersky vault\n\nBecause that can not be synchronized. If you have one single huge 100 GiB container and change add just a little PDF, everything would be uploaded again by most cloud synchronization softwares, that can not handle differential sync.\n\nare you planning on implementing the application into the iOS 11 file system\n\nThats the plan. @tobihagemann might be able to tell you more about it.. Closing as questions are answered.. > An error of type -5014 has occurred.

If this is true, we should consider that some event (enter key?) landed in Cryptomator while the window wasn't active. @tobihagemann we should play around with this and try to invoke the unmount event handler \"by accident\".. @submarine89\n\nHas any developer figured out if this is a High Sierra issue or something up with Cryptomator?\n\n@SailReal tested this with 3rd party WebDAV shares, as he reported up here. Apparently this is a High Sierra issue that happens for all WebDAV drives (maybe even other network drives like SMB, who knows...). @jomuyo Thanks for the log, this might contain an important clue!  :tada: \n\nconnection is dead\n\nIn the past the macOS WebDAV client didn't terminate connections after put requests, leaving them stale. We have added a filter in order to terminate such connections from server side.\nMaybe Apple fixed the former behavior, which never conformed to official standards anyway: Instead of either using chunked encoding or sending a content length, Apple added a X-Expected-Entity-Length header field.\nStarting with High Sierra we might need to disable this filter again. I will test this next week together with @tobihagemann.. Can't reproduce it. Having Excel running for hours and found nothing suspicious in the WebDAV logs.. @t0rv1c We received your log file. At what time did the unmount occur? In the log file I can only see a user-initiated unmount.. @t0rv1c this is also a user-initiated unmount. The following line is logged by the lock button handler, not in response to a irregular unmount:\n15:49:00.767 [AppKit Thread] TRACE o.c.u.controllers.UnlockedController - Regular unmount succeeded.. Last (pretty much unsuspicious) request before alleged unmount has been:\n```http\nPROPFIND /WUh1E7LGQtfd/Test/.localized HTTP/1.1\nAccept: /\nUser-Agent: WebDAVFS/3.0.0 (03008000) Darwin/17.0.0 (x86_64)\nConnection: keep-alive\nHost: localhost:42427\nContent-Length: 179\nDepth: 0\nContent-Type: text/xml\n404 Not Found HTTP/1.1\nDate: Mon, 13 Nov 2017 12:35:03 GMT\n```. I don't think this is a sync problem. Files appearing and disappearing during use is a normal scenario.\nBut just to be sure, could you please test with a vault located on your normal (i.e. non-synced, non-affected-by-third-party-apps) hard drive?. > Do you have any suggestions for work around?

This is a legacy setting, this warning can be ignored.\nTo fix it, remove useIpv6 from ~/.Cryptomator/settings.json.. Then the line has already been removed. Are you still getting the warning?. It is a bug in WebDAV-NIO-Adapter. Until we build a new version of it, you can add \"winDriveLetter\": \"Z\" to the ~/.Cryptomator/settings.json.. > Each time , I create new vault ,the line that I added to json file is deleted!!\nI forgot about that. Then either re-add the line or use a stable version by checking out the master branch. I already committed a bugfix in the aforementioned WebDAV-NIO-Adapter issue.. TODO: Update WebDAV-NIO-Adapter to HEAD, then this issue can be closed.. Since FUSE is around the corner, we will no further investigate this issue.. The bkup file should contain the old password as long as you don't unlock the vault. On each successful unlock, masterkey.cryptomator is copied to masterkey.cryptomator.bkup. \nCan you confirm, that you didn't unlock the vault immediately after changing the password?. Ok then I'm closing this issue. Works as designed. Thanks for paying attention, though!. Regarding slow navigation: This may be related to WebProxy Autodiscovery. For some reason Windows tries to discover a proxy for connections to localhost (which doesn't make too much sense)...\nBut the I/O error is a topic on its own...

We're releasing FUSE support with Cryptomator 1.4.0, which should solve this issue.. Closing this issue, as it is unrelated to rng-tools.. Well the iOS app can store the password using the system keychain (this is what happens when you enable Touch ID). The security stands and falls with the strength of iOS keychain, but at least it is possible to access the vault without entering a password. Using app extensions and Touch ID enabled vault it should be possible from your iPad's scanner app to store a document within that vault using the \"open in\" menu of that app.. Duplicate of #464?. Probably some left-over, not properly unmounted drive. Any suspicious item, if you type net use in cmd.exe?. Do you happen to have automatic proxy configuration scripts (pac files) enabled? Maybe that script decides, that \"cryptomator-vault\" is not a valid network destination, despite it standing in your hosts file.. Good news, everyone! We've released version 1.4.0-beta2, which introduces Dokany support. You now have the choice between Dokany and WebDAV based virtual hard drives.\nPlease retest this issue with Dokany enabled.. The cost factor can easily be changed for newly created vaults (or when changing the password for existing ones - which doesn't necessarily increase cracking time if an attacker has the old masterkey file).\nIn my opinion we can change this with the next major release. But lets make some performance tests on Android first. While the user doesn't feel a significant delay during key derivation on the iOS and desktop applications, on Android this might be relevant.. Oh sorry you can\u2018t. I meant we won\u2018t have any challenges changing it, because older implementations are already capable of reading vaults with higher n value.. Default complexity will be increased with the next regular release. :-). Needs to build and integrate CryptoLib 1.2.0. New CryptoLib version with increased cost param added to project in commit a0a8674.. > Do you have any idea of what could cause this problem?\nSince we didn't change any code related to the tray menu and it still works with older versions of Cryptomator, this might be related to specific JVM versions that we ship with the application.. Compiling with Java 9.0.4 apparently fixes the problem. So having this scheduled for 1.4.0 seems appropriate.. Related to #469, but different technology.\nWe really like to replace our current .deb/.rpm/etc deployment and follow a more modern approach that works on all distributions. So, yes this is important to us. But we don't know what package format is best suited yet.. We will use an AppImage for now. As it is our goal to reduce the number of different distribution mechanisms for the various Linux distros, we will not additionally provide Snap or Flatpak packages for now.\nWe are of course happy, if anyone wants to provide those, but our official support will be limited on AppImage.. @popey mentioned he'd like to help providing a Snap. To get started here is what you need to do to build a working application for Cryptomator 1.4.0-beta1 (requires oracle jdk 9):\n```bash\ndownload and extract sources:\ncurl -o antkit.tar.gz -L https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/download/1.4.0-beta1/antkit.tar.gz\ntar -xzf antkit.tar.gz\nbuild application directory\nant image\nreplace jvm\nrm -rf antbuild/Cryptomator/runtime\n${JAVA_HOME}/bin/jlink \\\n  --module-path ${JAVA_HOME}/jmods \\\n  --compress 1 \\\n  --no-header-files \\\n  --strip-debug \\\n  --no-man-pages \\\n  --strip-native-commands \\\n  --output antbuild/Cryptomator/runtime \\\n  --add-modules java.base,java.logging,java.xml,java.sql,java.management,java.security.sasl,java.naming,java.datatransfer,java.security.jgss,java.rmi,java.scripting,java.prefs,java.desktop,jdk.incubator.httpclient,javafx.fxml,javafx.controls,jdk.incubator.httpclient \\\n  --verbose\n```\nThe resulting antbuild/Cryptomator directory then needs to be bundled.. @x80486:\n\nWhy do you have two build approaches: that one with ant and another one with Maven (outlined in the main repo)?\n\nFirst we do a normal Maven build, which is sufficient to create a runnable .jar file. This can already be used for packages that include or depend on a JRE.\nThe ant build is a second build stage. It has its origin in the launchpad PPA build, that can only run offline (due to build server restrictions) and can not contact any Maven repository. Maven produces an ant-kit (pushed by our CI server to this public bintray repo, that includes all .jar dependencies as well as a build.xml. Instead of a \"fat jar\" it allows us to create packages with all libraries in separate jars (easier license management, before we switched to GPL).\nOn top of this ant build we have then implemented multiple third build stages for .exe, .dmg, .appimage, as well as for PPA and AUR etc.\nNote the different approaches: The AUR just packages the jar files and requires a JRE as well as OpenJFX as runtime dependencies. All other packages are fully self-contained and bundle the JRE (which is stripped down using jlink). This is also the way to go for AppImage, Snap and Flatpak, since they are intended to not interfere with dependencies used by other applications.\n\nAdditionally, does Cryptomator runs (or can run) on OpenJDK also? From version 10 onwards, I don't see any difference these days \u2013 except the Swing libs and a few trusted keys.\n\nAs you can see in the AUR repo, it runs on OpenJDK (even older versions). However with JDK 8-10 you also need to make sure OpenJFX is installed. Beginning with Java 11 this will become a Maven dependency  and we will switch to OpenJDK as our default JDK. Until then, we use Oracle JDK as it includes JavaFX (btw this is the only reason, why Cryptomator is in the Debian \"contrib\" section).. I think you're missing the JCE unlimited strength files. Check out the required dependencies.. See cryptomator-win for building an installable package out of the java program. Please note: You need to either change the used code signing certificate or remove this line.. Your downloaded file is broken, I can confirm that the 9dea8... hash is correct. Maybe some network device or AV software tampered with the file? Try downloading it from a different location.. There is of course a chance that Akamai serves a broken copy of the file in your region. If this is the case it will most likely be a temporary problem.. Why \"no luck\"? Apparently setup finished successfully... :thinking:. because of ~foo~ becomes ~foo~. I edited your comment. Still it doesn't explain much. The .deb file installs Cryptomator to /opt/Cryptomator.. Ok closing this issue now. Btw: Adding shortcut to the menu from the install logs indicates that you should also be able to find Cryptomator via your desktop menu.. We're thinking about a GUI redesign for version 1.5.0. Let's see what can be done.. Duplicate of #578. Closing this issue, as the question has been answered.\nThe sync process itself will never be a duty of Cryptomator. For any discussion about sharing the access keys, please head over to #578. \ud83d\ude42 . Duplicate of #336. > Is it even necessary that the password can only be changed while the vault is locked?\nTechnically: No, not at all.\n\nWhat was the design decision behind this back then?\n\nThere are two use cases:\n1. The user changes the password and unlocks the vault.\n2. The user changes the password and doesn't unlock the vault (immediately).\nThe latter one becomes more likely when changing password is possible while unlocked. Not using the password immediately makes it more likely to forget it. Thats all.\nIn any case it will be possible to restore the masterkey backup file, if unlock with the new password \"doesn't work\" (even though the user is 100% certain he entered the correct password^^).\n  . Our filesystem is case sensitive. Windows Explorer/CMD/etc apparently isn't.\nIf FOO exists and you type cd foo, Windows just assumes this is a valid operation, even though foo doesn't exist. A dir listing of foo then correctly displays nothing (or an error), even though FOO contains further nodes.\nIn my opinion Windows should fail fast when accessing non-existing directories. Will not fix this.\nThe other case is that both foo and FOO exist. One of the two variants might not be accessible using non-case-sensitive software. This scenario is theoretically fixable, as Cryptomator could check for other variants. However there are plenty possibilities (depending on the length of the filename) and checking existence of them all is nothing but a brute force approach.. Good news, everyone! We've released version 1.4.0-beta2, which introduces Dokany support. You now have the choice between Dokany and WebDAV based virtual hard drives.\nPlease retest this issue with Dokany enabled.. We should investigate this issue. Can you please provide one example file name that we can use to reproduce this behavior in a new vault? Then @marcjulian can try to reproduce the issue. Thanks!. Good news, everyone! We've released version 1.4.0-beta2, which introduces Dokany support. You now have the choice between Dokany and WebDAV based virtual hard drives.\nPlease retest this issue with Dokany enabled.. Files in the m directory don't get deleted by design. This has a somewhat historical rationale: In earlier versions of Cryptomator cleartext file foo/hello.txt and bar/hello.txt would result in the same ciphertext name. With the current version the ciphertext also depends on the directory and as such is pretty unique.\nThe files within the m directory contain the unshortened ciphertext and get their names by hashing their contents. This is effectively a rainbow table allowing is to map the hash to the unshortened ciphertext name. As I said this ciphertext could have existed in two different places, meaning we need to perform a very expensive full scan over the whole directory structure every time a m file is potentially no longer needed.\nToday the likelyhood of two long ciphertext names being identical is extremely low (lower than collisions of the used hash algorithms), so we could change this behavior and delete the files immediately when they're no longer needed.\nBut since they're very small and don't impact I/O performance we didn't change this yet.. > However, if you change the name to an extremely long one once the file has been placed into the vault, the name will be encrypted, but not the same way it would be by copying into the vault.\nThis is a second topic.

First of all thanks for your interest in helping to translate Cryptomator!\nThere is a nearly complete czech translation by Vojt\u011bch Dr\u00e1bek and Filip Vlas\u00e1k (I assume you are neither of those two?) on POEditor. We download the translations from there before building new releases.\nEven if I did merge your PR, it would get overwritten by the translations done on POEditor. Therefore I need to ask you to look at the translations in POEditor and amend them if necessary. Any new or changed translations will then be included in the next regular release.. Thank you very much! I've explained what \"drop bundle extension\" means in POEditor. People shouldn't see that message nowadays, though.. > It\u2019s unfortunately limited to 4gb\nthis is the limit per file.\nThe total vault size is not limited by WebDAV. But there is a different problem on Windows: Windows assumes, that the available space is equal to the space left on the C: drive, even though the vault is stored on a different drive.\nA workaround is to not copy all 65 GB at once, but in several chunks that would fit onto the C: drive.. > How do I set another drive than C?\nYou can't. It's a Windows bug. MS just doesn't want to comply with standards, as I have explained here.\nI'm closing this issue as duplicate of #80.. > The file that is being created after the maven compilation.\nThe jar file name can be controlled in the pom.xml.\nThis is a general software development related question and belongs on stackoverflow or some other Q&A portal. Please don't use GitHub issues for it. Thank you!. a) this is a duplicate of #585.\nb) this is a bug in our Linux release.. Closing this in favour of #207, since you've already mentioned it. We're now actively focusing on WebDAV alternatives.. Depends on https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptofs/issues/25. Fixed in commit 95df963 (but screwed up commit message \ud83d\ude48). See this post: https://community.cryptomator.org/t/why-is-cryptomator-written-in-java-isnt-java-insecure/37\nNote that Cryptomator does not depend on a system-wide Java installation, nor does it expose its bundled JVM.\nA rewrite in a new language will not happen in this repository, so I am closing this issue. Of course we are happy to support any 3rd party project that wants to provide a c++ version of cryptomator. A c library of our cryptographic implementation can be provided (currently it still uses some commoncrypto functions, that can be changed to openssl).. Would you mind trying out the latest snapshot with FUSE instead of WebDAV drives?\nIt's an AppImage, that you can just download, set executable bit and run (see instructions). No need to install, so no conflicts with the stable release.. > I can't find it ;)\nYou even quoted it \ud83d\ude09. Anyway since we've released a beta yesterday: Use the beta not the snapshot.. Use the .appimage beta linked under Binaries, unless you know exactly what you're doing.. Which display manager and desktop environment do you use?. X11 or Wayland?. Cryptomator 1.3.x window shows up in its normal size?. I just downloaded the Kubuntu 16.04.4 .iso and ran the live system (without installing!) inside a VM.\nNo problems here, so apparently it is not a KDE, SDDM or Kernel problem.\nMaybe it depends on the graphics driver or graphical desktop effects settings?\n\nEdit: On the second attempt I was able to reproduce it!. Seems to be a race condition, as it sometimes works. Maybe we need to set a size explicitly in MainApplication#start(...)?. ## Workaround\n@njmckenzie found a temporary workaround, until this issue is fixed:\n\nI was able to brute force it bigger by right clicking on the menubar and going to 'more actions -> Special Window Settings'. Through this I can set the size manually.\n\n\n. > Maybe I changed the Java runtime in the meantime and that's the reason. Or maybe it's been fixed in 1.3.5?\n@jhuebner79 1.3.5 didn't fix any UI bugs. What versions of Cryptomator and Java did you use before?. We need to set the size explicitly, until we find a better solution.. Can you please retest this using the latest snapshot build? Thank you!. @altae7 next attempt with hard-coded window size. Snapshot of commit 5f11e1a is available on the same page as before.. Great. Then we will use this fix for now :-). ~~What FUSE for macOS version do you use?~~ Do you have any other installed FUSE drivers? Are there suspicious log entries in your system log?. Do you remember what FUSE for macOS version you've had before? If there's an incompatibility that leads to crashes we need to blacklist it in order to prevent such crashes.. > do you know of a way to pull that out of e.g. logs somewhere?\nNope, but there are several crash related issues on the osxfuse repo. Most of them closed, so chances are good it has been fixed in the meantime. Anyways we need to observe this issue.. I recommend using the .appimage version, as it is preconfigured and contains all dependencies.\nTo set the ipcPortPath launch java -Dcryptomator.ipcPortPath=~/.cryptomator/ipcport.tmp -jar cryptomator.jar.. This seems to be a duplicate of #656. Can you post your display manager, windowing system, desktop environment, etc on that thread, please?\nClosing this as duplicate.. We mount using the -oauto_xattr flag.. Yes we can reproduce it using Excel and TextEdit.. We think we've got everything ready for beta 2. Not sure about the release date yet, because we're also trying to provide volumes on Windows via Dokany.\nSaving documents works as expected with TextEdit (1.13) and Excel (16.14.1) with our latest development snapshot.\nAnyway I consider this issue fixed. We will reopen this, if someone still experiences it with Cryptomator 1.4.0-beta2.. > What i can't figure out is the unlock failure of the first vault:\nThis is already a re-unlock attempt. Since it is thrown during ...\nat org.cryptomator.ui.model.FuseVolume.createDirIfNotExist(FuseVolume.java:73)\n    at org.cryptomator.ui.model.FuseVolume.prepare(FuseVolume.java:65)\n... we know, that access to said path is not possible because the \"device\" aka. our FUSE drive isn't accessible. Apparently a previous unmount failed, hence the left-over device.\nI experienced the same issue and helped myself by calling umount \"/Users/dkoppstein/Library/Application Support/Cryptomator/fuse_vaultq3OV1RZZResT\" via Terminal manually. This command fails, but afterwards the directory no longer shows up as a device in ls -la.. Please retest with 1.4.0-beta2. \ud83d\ude4c . @mrubioroy we need to make sure not to attempt mounting to an already-existing directory. This would prevent such issues. Related to #752. Needs to be retested with Cryptomator 1.4.0-beta2 with Dokany enabled.. Then I consider it fixed. According to @tobihagemann this is a WebDAV issue.\n\nI also tried this with a \"regular\" WebDAV server: It's not possible to rename files/folders to the same name with a different case.. > Are you sure to close this? Cryptomator behaves differently in this case than a \"regular\" WebDAV server.\n\nOur WebDAV implementation is capable of renaming (as can be verified using the litmus test). If Windows decides not even to invoke the MOVE request, I don't see any point in adjusting the implementation to a Windows bug.. Anyone finding a misbehaviour for a specific WebDAV request/response pair, feel free to reopen this issue.. Apparently @infeo implemented this. I just tried it with 1.4.0 and I can define a custom mount point in the mac version.\nPlease reopen if there are any issues.. Might be related to #660. We will need to retest with beta2.. Related to #660, as @ron-gh confirmed, this has been fixed in commit 9107d29 and will need to be retested with 1.4.0-beta2.. @Dabbott89 Thanks for your explanation. I agree to your rationale and reopened #752.. Locks are not yet implemented. I don't know GnuCash, but is there an option to disable file locking? If so, does it work then?. I opened this issue on the fuse subproject https://github.com/cryptomator/fuse-nio-adapter/issues/13.\nI need more information on what \"the lock file\" is exactly.. > If your filesystem reports it doesn't support hard links [...]\nWe do not support hard links (neither do we support symlinks), but I'm not sure if we report this via some FUSE flags... \ud83e\udd14. @michael-wenyon great it works now, but we didn't change anything related to links. So the cause must lie somewhere else. Can you retest with the setup you originally used (i.e. Gnucash 3.0.1)?\nClosing this anyway, as it doesn't seem to be reproducable any longer.. Duplicate of #753. We're not yet sure if we will continue providing Cryptomator via the PPA. Since 18.04 is LTS this decision would bind us for years. We are currently evaluating what will be the future of Ubuntu-based applications.\nUntil then, please use the .appimage of 1.4.0-beta1.. To make it clear: We could easily log into launchpad and copy the binary from 17.10 to 18.04 with a single click.\nSince Ubuntu is moving to Snap and we're moving to AppImages, we are actively not publishing the latest version to the PPA since we want to provide updates in the long term.\nWe have the following options:\n Change PPA to be merely an AppImage-installer (like ppa:webupd8team/java does it with their Oracle Java installers)\n Change PPA to be AppImage-based (simplifying the build and removing all dependencies)\n* Drop PPA completely in favour of Snap\nUntil we have decided this, we will not copy from 17.10 to 18.04 because it's LTS and we want to provide future versions.. @popey see issue #613 regarding snap. if you provide a build recipe, I'd be happy to integrate it into our Linux CI process.. @jojowork will look into writing a wrapper for the AppImage that can be distributed via ppa. If experiments go well, we will publish for Bionic via ppa again.. As a matter of fact I'm currently working on an updated PPA release. \ud83d\ude09 . I've just pushed the first experimental version of Cryptomator 1.4.0-beta2 to the PPA for Bionic. If it works, I will supersede it with 1.3.x stable and eventually with 1.4.0 stable (then also for Xenial).\nBionic users, please test if install/uninstall via PPA works.. @soehub Do your test vaults have distinct names?

Oracle JDK already includes this.. Since it's running with Oracle JDK and we strongly depend on JavaFX, I suspected that missing OpenJFX might be the cause.\nGoogling for the stack trace gives me results like this stackoverflow post, but still no helpful error description.... @altae7 regarding the \"small window\" see issue #656\nI consider this issue closed. Solution is to use Oracle JDK (or figure out whats wrong with OpenJDK + OpenJFX). Starting with Java 11 we will need to migrate to OpenJFX anyway due to JavaFX no longer being part of the JDK.. This has also been suggested over here: https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/274#issuecomment-231549846.. Duplicate of #274.

For any follow-up questions related to this issue, please comment on #579.. > I suspect this is to do with the Box Drive online-only file caching, where it creates 0kb shortcut versions of files on the local disk, and only loads them after the user has requested to open them? Is Cryptomator not compatible with this kind of \"online only\" file which needs to be downloaded/cached into the system? It appears to be looking for the data ASAP, and when it cannot immediately get that data, it does not mount the filesystem, and then fails and eventually has to be locked again.\n\nIs there a solution for this behavior? I am trying to have all my files up on the cloud on box.com, rather than keeping them locally, because hard drives are slowly dying, and I'm tired of mirroring and replacing them. But it seems I need to always have the \"m\" folder downloaded, is that right? Is that metadata which informs the filesystem about where to find the data files? The problem is box drive does not allow me to specify certain folders to be cached offline, otherwise I would specify that folder to be cached and 100% available.\n\nThe m folder is needed for navigating through directory hierarchies. The files themselves must nut be reported as 0 byte files. E.g. OneDrive on Windows works with \"Files on Demand\" feature enabled, as it reports the actual size. However, 0-byte-sized files will cause problems.\nWe can not support your use case, since Cryptomator will not be able to work properly under the given preconditions. If you'd like to use online-only files and still use client-side encryption, use Cyberduck or Mountain Duck.. Cryptomator is not a backup program. Its sole purpose is local encryption. It is not intended to solve any problems you have with your cloud storage provider.. Can you please test this with 1.4.0-beta2 and Dokany see this thread? Thanks. \ud83d\ude42 .

Same for fuse and whatever is needed for WebDAV...so it should behave exactly the same between distros \ud83e\udd1e\nWe shouldn't need to depend on a flatpak runtime that includes the JRE, since we're building a self-contained package that includes the required subset of said JRE. I think the freedesktop runtime is sufficient.\n\nOn a different subject, I'm just reusing the generated JAR file from your build. I believe that Flathub folks like to build the artifact from scratch, but I don't see the need for Java applications; once you have the generated JAR, it's only a matter of guaranteeing the compatible JRE in order to run it successfully...but let's see how that goes. That's why I was poking on the OpenJFX issue, because if that's included we wouldn't even need to provide that dependency since the (fat) JAR would have all contained.\nI don't know what's your preference on that.\n\nWe should not build everything from source. This is not the way Maven works. There are already plenty pre-compiled libraries involved anyway. Instead I'll try to split our CI build process into two stages. The first stage creates a \"directory\" containing the ELF executable as well as the stripped-down JRE and all the libraries. The second stage will then build the AppImage. You can then get the artifact from the fist stage and wrap it into a Flatpak package.. @x80486 still just experimenting, but this is what the multi-stage CI-build will produce after completing its first stage: https://dl.bintray.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/snapshot/ appdir.tar.gz contains the directory structure of the application that can then be amended to become an AppImage or Flatpak.\nIf you can provide a reproducable build instruction (i.e. a shell script) to generate a Flatpak from this directory structure, I'd be glad to add it to our build server, so the package can be generated automatically.. > Maybe I didn't get it, but I was under the impression that, if I download appdir.tar.gz, extract everything, and run ./appdir/Cryptomator/Cryptomator it should work without any other (run-time) dependency\nYep that was the plan. As I said the setup is still a bit experimental... The binary is built by a buildtool that itself is a backport of an unstable JDK early access release. \ud83d\ude48\nIt does start on my Mint 19.1 / Linux 4.15.0 VM.

I.e.\n\"--device=dri\", /* GUI rendering */\n    \"--filesystem=home\", /* access vaults stored in user's home directory */\n    \"--persist=.Cryptomator\", /* settings, logs and mount points */\n    \"--share=network\", /* check for updates, launch webdav server */\n    \"--socket=x11\" /* GUI rendering */. We don't support fuse 3 features anyway, yet. Regarding the comments: I find them helpful to understand why the permission is needed. It should be good practice to do this, otherwise what is the point of sandboxing at all? But you're right: The first goal should be to get it working at all.. Oh, I am very sorry for not having solved your problem within two hours since you reported it. Since you payed for an Android companion app, you clearly are eligible for premium support for a free tool that is provided by volunteers who spent thousands of hours of their spare time, with most of them not even affiliated with the company selling the Android app... Who do you think you are?\n\nIf you experience a bug, please attach the log file from the run in which you attempted to unlock the vault. The aforementioned log shows that you started and quit the application without even trying to access a vault.. Ok here is the problem:\n15:19:02.515 [pool-3-thread-1] INFO  o.c.f.w.s.WebDavServletController - Mounting http://localhost:42427/CztfobSARu8G/Crypt using org.cryptomator.frontend.webdav.mount.FallbackMounter\n15:19:02.518 [pool-3-thread-1] WARN  o.c.f.webdav.mount.FallbackMounter - No applicable strategy has been found for your system.

This might be related to #264: Finder is known to use NFD for filename encoding, while we use NFC internally. The directory listing might then contain the created file with a \"different\" name than what Finder used during creation. Therefore Finder thinks they are different files which might cause the loss of selection after \"refreshing\". @tobihagemann does this sound plausible?\nSolution might be to convert all file names to NFD for OSX in the fuse layer.. Depends on cryptomator/fuse-nio-adapter#27.. To be fixed by upgrading to fuse-nio-adapter 1.0.3. > [...] relies on one premise, that Colin Percival\u2018s scrypt PBKD library will stay uncrackable/flawless [...]\nWe've actually thought about cascading KDFs in some other issue for future versions. This would need a vault migration, though.\n\nI would still change the name of the \u201cprimaryMasterKey\u201d\n\nFair point, but also needs a migration. There is another option that is backwards-compatible: We can add a dummy entry to the json file like this:\njson\n{\n    \"primaryMasterKey\": \"...\",\n    \"readme\": \"this file contains encrypted keys as well as cipher configurations. read more at http://blabla. it is safe to sync this file to any public storage, provided your password isn't '123456'\",\n    \"...\": \"...\"\n}. what platform, jdk vendor and build tools are you using?. The antlib.xml path changed from java 8 to java 9+, see this change: https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/commit/4fffc638690a1ae91f33f8258cc2e8912ac35e70#diff-4ba143d1651dcc95edee4ca4ee7dd91fL3\nAssuming you're trying to build HEAD, you will need a newer JDK. See https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator#building. Welcome back :wink:\nClosing this issue in favour of https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-win/issues/9, as this needs to be fixed in the windows installer.. Can you verify the fix in 1.4.0 Beta 3?. This .dll is extracted to a tmp dir by the JNA library. See this stackoverflow post.\nApparently we can include the .dll ourselves and set jna.boot.library.path to prevent this from happening.. Slightly off-topic, but:\n\nIf a vault is open, the same click just put cryptomator into the tray.\n\nBack in the days when we implemented it this way, we thought this was cool. However, today I think this is very confusing and we should change it to:\n- \"X\" always minimizes the application\n- \"Quit\" quits it. Updated the beta package for Bionic. Older Ubuntu versions will get the final version 1.4.0.. I don\u2018t have the option to test this, but I assume it is up to the OS to handle which program should handle what file. Since WebDAV paths are http based (and the windows WebDAV clientmakes some crappy UNC path conversions \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21), I don\u2018t think this is something we have much influence on.\nCorrect me if i am mistaken, but I assume that fixing timeline support is a Dokany-only issue.. Well you have to decide what you actually want. If you want the \"timeline\" to support webdav, open an issue at microsoft. If you want Dokany to become faster, feel free to contribute to #711 (can be anything from bottleneck analysis to profiling results).\nThis issue not getting resolved just by staying open without any useful input. If you have anything to share about the timeline feature that helps adding compatibility, great. Otherwise it looks like nobody knows what to do about it.. > We both know that opening an issue at MS won't do a thing. And why would MS go at great lengths to ensure compatibilty with a third-party software?\nYes if you opened an issue \"Timeline not compatible with Cryptomator\", they would probably ignore it. But this is not what I am saying. If you instead open an issue \"Timeline not compatible with WebDAV drives\", you're reporting an incompatibility with an open standard. Since MS apparently is marketing the timeline feature as a major part of their OS, I guess they will care about it.. You can either install the dependencies (you have to figure that out yourself though, as this vastly depends on your distribution) or (and this is the preferred solution):\nDownload Cryptomator 1.4.0-beta3, which we consider stable for Linux. This is no longer a rpm package but rather an AppImage that doesn't need any installation and ships with all dependencies bundled. All you need to do is:\n1. Download the AppImage file\n2. Make it executable\n3. Run it. > What caused this and how can I stop it from happening again?\nYou tell me, then I can tell you how to stop it. \ud83d\ude09 How about looking into your system log and find the time the disconnect occured. Then please post the surrounding 20-25 lines, that might contain suspicious activity.\n\nHow did my vault disconnect overnight?\n\nSince you wrote you were able to see the \"reveal drive\" button, the vault didn't lock itself. I.e. the WebDAV server was still running. So the question is, why the WebDAV client either disconnected itself or the connection was interrupted. Neither can be answered.. Please refer to the Dagger repo if you think you found a bug in Dagger. But I assume you simple didn't run Maven yet, since Dagger generates classes during compile-time, i.e. those classes are missing before you compile.. First of all: You don't need any Java installation. Cryptomator brings the parts of Java it needs with it and doesn't depend on a system-wide JRE.\nRegarding accessibility we have a general issue #601, but I must admit that we haven't focused on this yet. Adding labels to controls should be fairly easy, though. Would you be interested in testing this and giving us advice on how the UI is best navigable with a screen reader? We can then schedule this for 1.4.1.\nAlso we're planning to to a major UI redesign with 1.5.0, this might be a good point to think about accessibility from the very beginning.. These are directories that either\n no longer exist, but due to bad synchronization software reappeared, or\n snyc is not finished yet, so the files already exist but the corresponding directories don't yet.\nIf you are sure everything is synced correctly, you can safely get rid of the mentioned files. Just make sure not to delete anything else than mentioned in the log.. Both work on High Sierra. Seems to be a regression in Mojave.. > Before 1.4.0 this returned something like:\n\n/Volumes/[cryptomatordrive]/folder/file that could directly be accessed in finder or cli\n\n@tobihagemann tested it on Mojave and can not confirm this.\nAs said before, this appears to be a Mojave regression. As long as there is no new information which helps in any way, there is nothing we can do about it since this is a decision met by the Finder (or whatever underlying I/O framework there is) developers.. Duplicate of #711. stack trace is:\njava.nio.file.DirectoryNotEmptyException: Mount point is not empty.\n    at org.cryptomator.ui.model.FuseVolume.createDirIfNotExist(FuseVolume.java:65)\n    at org.cryptomator.ui.model.FuseVolume.mount(FuseVolume.java:53)\n    at org.cryptomator.ui.model.Vault.unlock(Vault.java:109)\n    at org.cryptomator.ui.controllers.UnlockController.lambda$didClickUnlockButton$0(UnlockController.java:392)\nApparently you use either a custom mount point that is not an empty directory or the automatically assigned mount point is still containing some garbage from previous failed attempts.. @infeo Maybe we need to reopen #668?. > Showing an error, that the mount folder (display the path for convenience) is not empty should be enough.\nAck. Another thing to consider: Unless the mount point is specified by the user, we should make sure not to attempt mounting to an already-existing directory. This way we can be sure not to interfere with anything that we don't have full control of.. It works for me with the latest FUSE + CryptoFS libraries. ~~To be retested with 1.4.1~~\nEdit: To be retested as soon as we've merged the updated libraries with symlink support.. Sorry my bad. 1.4.1 doesn't contain symlink support yet.. After some testing with improved logging, we found out that the file is indeed opened in read+write+append mode:\nopening /gitfolder/.git/logs/HEAD with flags O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_APPEND, O_BINARY (33793)\nProblem is, that for Java FileChannels APPEND must not be specified together with READ:\n\nAPPEND [...] This option may not be used in conjunction with the READ or TRUNCATE_EXISTING options.\n\n(Source). > Applications shall specify exactly one of the first three values (file access modes) below in the value of oflag:\n\nO_RDONLY: Open for reading only.\nO_WRONLY: Open for writing only.\nO_RDWR: Open for reading and writing. The result is undefined if this flag is applied to a FIFO.\n\n(https://linux.die.net/man/3/open)\nI.e. O_RDONLY and O_WRONLY must not be present at the same time. Since those flags are decoded from a bitmask, where O_RDONLY has the value 0, it is always included (which is wrong if any of the other two is present).. Will be fixed by updating fuse-nio-adapter to version 1.1.1.. We might need to ask Dokany for help about bundling the installer. Some info is available on their wiki. Closing this in favour of cryptomator/cryptomator-win#12. Before being able to add symlinks to FUSE, we need to think about a way to support them in CryptoFS. This needs to be done in a way that doesn't break WebDAV.\nSo lets treat this as a feature request for symlinks.. The problem lies in writing a multi platform software. We can only support the common denominator of those systems. That doesn't mean that we can not solve it somehow. But it doesn't hurt to plan such features.\nThe FUSE file system did not reduce the feature set of WebDAV. This is what we did with 1.4.0. Now we have the opportunities to tackle new features, such as symlinks.. Depends on cryptomator/cryptofs#38 and cryptomator/fuse-nio-adapter#25. Working on it.. Also depends on cryptomator/webdav-nio-adapter-servlet#4 and cryptomator/dokany-nio-adapter#16.. @infeo Do you think this might have been solved in the meantime with Cryptomator 1.4.1?. Please retest with Cryptomator 1.4.2. Ok let's consider this fixed until proven otherwise :). What window server / display manager are you using?\n\nso I'm assuming Java 9.0+11 is bundled\n\nThat is correct. Sadly Java 10 wasn't available for the Linux build due to the mad licensing decisions of Oracle. We will switch to OpenJDK 11 on all platforms with one of the next releases.\n. This might be related to #720. If it is the same cause, there is a workaround: Starting the application with -Djdk.gtk.version=2.\nTo do this, you need to modify a configuration file inside the AppImage. This is explained by Kaiden42 in this comment: https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/369#issuecomment-421600958.\n. > I will work in such a way until the Flatpak (count me in if you need help with this one) is ready then! \nAs stated in #729, we will not provide an \"official\" Flatpak atm, so any community-driven Flatpak package is always welcome :-). 1 and 3 work as designed. If you set a custom mount point, it is expected to be an existing, empty directory.\nStill, ~ is not correctly resolved. I will therefore rename this ticket.. Have you tried installing Cryptomator from the AUR?. Upstream bugfix currently scheduled for OpenJFX 12. Since there is a backport for OpenJFX 11.0.2, this will be fixed with the next Cryptomator release.. > ...are you going to include all OpenJFX dependencies also in the (final) JAR? In the current release, 1.4.0, if JavaFX is not in the classpath the application doesn't start.\nYes, we're going to include OpenJFX as dependencies (to my knowledge this is the only correct way of including it since its been removed from the Oracle JDK).. Since there is currently no tool to create native packages (blocked by JEP 343, currently scheduled for JDK 13), we need to find an alternative to bundle the JVM (created using jlink) with the application (.jar files).\nI.e. before we solve the last part, we can not migrate to JDK 11, because we're unable to release the software.. We will eventually reschedule this issue to an earlier release. We aim to do this as soon as possible as I hate the current fragmentation of the Oracle JDK, JavaFX and the Java Packager. Ideally the build should require not more than a mvn clean install. I will do some experiments with the old pre-JDK-11 Java Packager and an up-to-date runtime image provided by jlink from OpenJDK 11.. We're already using the share plugin for the fat jar. Correct me, if I'm wrong, but I don't think it can replace the native launchers that the packager produces for the Windows and macOS.. > I forgot you are shipping \"native\" packages for Windows and macOS \ud83d\ude05\nwell... self-contained packages \ud83d\ude09 but the launcher is indeed native, therefore no java binary needs to be added by jlink. better isolation, no outdated public JRE installations with potentially flawed plugins and no version conflicts at the cost of slightly more disk space.. Just for the record: It is not possible to use JDK10's javapackager -p ${jdk11.home} as a module path. This results in:\nException: java.lang.module.FindException: Error reading module: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.jdk/Contents/Home/jmods/java.security.sasl.jmod\n\nI.e. as stated above we can not currently create self-contained packages. The best workaround would probably be to use jlink without the --strip-native-commands flag, which leaves us with a java binary and all the JVM libraries.\nNext we can start the program using a shell script. In fact this is exactly what jlink's --launcher command=module.name/MainClass does (we need to find out its equivalent for Windows launchers):\n```sh\n!/bin/sh\nJLINK_VM_OPTIONS=\nDIR=dirname $0\n$DIR/java $JLINK_VM_OPTIONS -m module.name/MainClass $@\n```\nThen we need to build the .app bundle and the windows application directory manually.. Update: Found this article referencing this email which links to backports of jpackager from future JDK versions, that can be added to JDK 11.. Done in 0257802b. Not entirely sure, if this is the right place, but there is this property Statvfs.f_namemax. Let's try this. I've created issue cryptomator/fuse-nio-adapter#23.. To avoid this, we should delete the mount point after unmounting. Unless any third party software silently recreates this directory, this should at least prevent both issues.\nEdit: Deleting might be a bad idea for custom mount points, though... @cryptomator/linux Should we add a warning in the UI when using a custom mount point?. @tobihagemann if the process (e.g. libreoffice) keeps an open file handle, unmount should have failed in the first place. Therefore I think this is not a question of file handles but rather a subsequent attempt to save a file at a given path. If the path's parent directory no longer exists, the save attempt should fail (as expected when first removing the drive).. @infeo so should this be fixed with 1.4.1?. @Starbat @asteppke Please retest with 1.4.2. For the LibreOffice issue please see #810.\nI consider this issue fixed for now.. Among the ciphertext files there should not be any hidden file. Cryptomator does not create those. They probably belong to some other system tool. During decryption Cryptomator ignores any files found inside the ciphertext directories, that it does not recognize.\nTherefore we consider it safe to disable \"sync hidden files\".. According to the stack trace the encrypted file is not accessible for Cryptomator. Please check and fix file permissions on the vault's storage location.. > Also, do you have any instructions for compiling and running Cryptomator from the IDE (in my case IntelliJ)? I'm unable to complete a Maven build, so I cannot test this code myself at the moment.\nI've committed the .idea config to the root of the project and merged this into this feature branch. Note, that you need to have Oracle JDK 9 or 10 atm, as the self-contained packages sadly don't work with OpenJDK 11 yet.. Btw for some time we've been thinking about implementing a completely new PasswordField, that is not based on TextField. One of the main reasons is, that we want it to use char[] instead of String internally, as this is much easier to purge from memory if it contains sensitive data.\nBut there are also some feature requests such as #409 that you're trying to solve or #458.. @jellemdekker why did you close this PR?. Did it work on 1.3.x?. @cooocky your issue is a duplicate of #752, where you will find a workaround. It is not related to the stack trace posted by @vanniktech.. Might be related to #804?. Hmmm...\nThe number of bytes encrypted/decrypted can be slightly higher than the bytes actually written to the underlying storage device due to caching effects but not the other way round. This clearly is implausible.\nThe figures shown in the chart are reported directly out of our encryption layer, not from the virtual drive implementation. I.e. you should get the same numbers when using WebDAV instead of Dokan. Can you confirm this theory?. > we close this issue for now and reopen it when it appears again to investigate further?\n\ud83d\udc4d. duplicate of #711. Thanks for your feedback! You might be interested to test the snapshot build in the linked issue and report any related findings there. Please retest with Cryptomator 1.4.2. > here is another \"clean\" example.

Can you find out what process is accessing said file?. > Is this reproducible?\n@cryptomator/windows seen something like this before?. Closing this issue, as it is not related to the technical product development. Feel free to discuss your opinions, but please use e.g. the forums at community.cryptomator.org and not GitHub Issues for it. :wink:. The log shows a NoSuchFileException for the following path in your  Google Drive: Dav\\d\\LL\\SF47ZOMBUU5JU7NKZNWWMDHMPU4EZX.\nPlease check if it exists (maybe you use some partial sync feature?) and if yes, if there is any permission change since the last time you used it.. Then simply restore it from Google Drive's version history.. Ok let's assume that the missing directory doesn't mean anything. Maybe some 3rd party process tried to access a cleartext path within the vault it assumed to exist, but it didn't.\nSo the question remains: Why can't you open files that are present and appear to have the correct size. Can you access the files using WebDAV?\nIf not: Is it possible the files on the vault are write-protected? There is a known bug: #725.. Are the files \"readonly\"?\n\n. Fixed in 9cc873a3..

Problem is that beginning with JDK 11, JavaFX is no longer a part of the JRE. Instead we have a new dependency: OpenJFX. While this has many advantages, this means that a fat jar would need additional 40 MiB of platform-specific libraries for Linux, macOS and Windows. The resulting fat jar would be bigger than the platform-specific installers.\nAnother problem is, that we rely on various JVM arguments (example) that can not simply be included in a fat jar but need to be passed to the java binary when running the jar.\nI don't say we can not create a jar release, but it wouldn't hurt to discuss what is the best approach to do it.. > I see that the Cryptomator-1.4.6 fat jar file is only about 23M in size\nIf you build it like that it will only run on Windows. To get a platform-independent fat jar, you need to include additional modules, as described in this SO answer.\nAs stated above we could definitely create a jar release, but we'd still need platform-specific launcher.bat, launcher.sh, ... scripts that add various runtime arguments in order to support e.g. the ability to store the passphrase on Windows.\nOr we simply document all arguments and release it \"for experts only\" without any support...\nAt the end of the day:\n\n[...] This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. [...]\n-- GPLv3\n. Oh boy, I missed \"System Error 53\". Still no definite idea what is causing it. See other issues about error 53...\n\nIf you google it, you'll find a lot of instructions (even on MS pages) that suggest you troubleshoot your network settings including any firewall rules, DNS resolution, etc... Could be virtually anything.. 1.4.6 did not change anything related to WebDAV (other than the log verbosity). The installer sets two system configurations:\n\nIt makes sure Windows' webclient is the preferred network provider (registry key  HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\NetworkProvider\\Order)\nIt adds cryptomator-vault as an alias for 127.0.0.1 to C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts\n\nIt then restarts the service via net stop webclient and net start webclient. No reboot required.\nThis behaviour did not change in 1.4.6. I.e. if you had Cryptomator 1.3.x or newer before, nothing should have changed at all in your system configuration.. Closing this, as the problem disappeared.. Maybe related to cryptomator/cryptomator-linux#9, which should be fixed but who knows...\nCan you try the following: Download cryptomator 1.4.6 as .tar.gz, unzip it and see if you get the same error when launching the Cryptomator binary.\nNext, open app/Cryptomator.cfg with an text editor and in the [JVMOptions] section add the following line:\n-Djdk.gtk.version=2\nSave the cfg file and try starting Cryptomator again. Does it change anything?. Strange, it's the exact same software.. Related to #827?. Thanks for reporting. While it makes sense (when looking at the code) that the file times are not set correctly, I don't understand why you get a \"No such file or directory\" error. Anyhow I opened an issue in the fuse library: cryptomator/fuse-nio-adapter#32.. Currently blocked by JDK-8220793.. In order to tell you if Cryptomator is doing something different, I would need to know what exactly TreeSizeFree is trying to do.

Yeah, scale in 10.10.2 (Yosemite) looks appropriate.\n. Just wanted to echo that I'm experiencing the same thing.  What's notable to me is that you show a Cryptomator folder in iCloud that has metadata that allows it to show the Cryptomator icon, which I'm assuming is generated from the desktop version of the app, yes?\nI generated my folder manually, unless I'm missing an obvious step within the desktop application to allow Cryptomator to create a parent folder for me automatically.\n\n. Nope, I accepted it, but that action didn't result in bring up the \"Photos\" library, it just took me back to my default vault screen.  Its like the hook for \"Ok\" actually has some issue bringing up the library, or can't find it. However, the second time around it works fine.  I'll see if I can do a quick video capture to detail it.\n. Last thoughts: I am unable to reproduce because even if I turn off access to \"Photos\" via the Settings panel, delete the app and reinstall I'm presented with a different screen-- shows the lock icon and reports that I've disabled access to Photos via settings.  I've tried deleting and rebooting, but that preference seems to be persistent in the container. :) I have no idea how to help you reproduce.\n. ",

I've selected \"Hide Cryptomator\" and the About dialog popped up. xD Should be fixed though.\n. FYI - this issue is closed. There is already a backup mechanism for the masterkey. Thanks!\n. @jmoral136 Yes, it has been implemented for 1.3.0 but it hasn't been officially released yet. You can try out the latest release candidate: https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.3.0-rc7\nEdit: Updated link to RC 7 even though it has known issues #510 #511.. Yeaaah, we probably were too optimistic about the release candidates. We should've called them beta versions. :wink: With RC 7, we're very near to a final release and it actually can be seen as a release candidate. :smile:\nWe want to fix all regressions before releasing a final version. I'm a little worried about Microsoft Office on Windows because we've heard some reports that it works fine with 1.2.3 but not with 1.3.0. We couldn't reproduce the issues so it's still something that we're investigating and we'd love to hear more feedback on that (just opened an issue for that, see #512).. Just received a user report that this same issue also occurs on Ubuntu (on a Retina MBP).. #26 seems to be fixed, so how about plans on moving forward with this issue?\n. Just found out that WebDAV might also cause problems, when using Cryptomator only in user space. The installer and the application modify the registry. I'm not sure if the modifications are absolutely necessary, but can we even offer a portable version?\n. But not only that, right? The installer also modifies the registry: https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-win/blob/master/package/windows/Cryptomator.iss#L41\nWith a missing installer I'm not sure if Cryptomator is usable, when these modifications aren't executed. \ud83d\ude05 Just wanted to document this in this issue to keep this in consideration for a portable version.\n. Of course!\nI have fixed CFBundleDocumentTypes by changing CFBundleTypeName to Cryptomator Vault and added LSItemContentTypes with org.cryptomator.folder. In summary: CFBundleTypeName is not the identifier (UTI), it's just a description. Source\nBut registering for an UTI is not enough, because it's not a known file type. That's why it has to be additionally defined as an exported UTI declaration. Source\n. But maybe... before this PR is being merged... we should change the UTI to org.cryptomator.vault?\n. Oh and what my motivation was to fix this: Cryptomator vaults/bundles had this org.cryptomator.folder name, which was weird, because all users could see that. A more user-friendly description like Cryptomator Vault is just more appealing. And the UTI declarations were missing completely (LSItemContentTypes should be defined and also exported UTI if it's a completely new one), so that's why.\n. Just to be sure, can you check again now, if you haven't deleted the vaults? My experience is that it sometimes takes a while. Maybe iCloud Drive is just slow right now. But if you have already waited several minutes, then this is probably a bug...\nCan you check if you can see the vault at least at https://www.icloud.com/ ?\n. The thing is: Cryptomator on iOS is not able access the \"whole\" iCloud Drive due to restrictions by Apple (it's called sandboxing). That means, if you want to use Cryptomator on both your Mac and iPhone, you would have to put your vaults in the Cryptomator directory.\nCan you see and access the Cryptomator directory in iCloud Drive on your Mac? Or is it not there?\n. For example like this:\n\n. Thanks for the pics! That definitively looks like a bug on our side. I still have no idea why the Cryptomator directory doesn't show up, but I'll look into it. Yeah, iCloud is kind of messy, but I think still pretty important nonetheless. :)\n. Actually the Cryptomator directory should be created by the iOS app (because the desktop app is not capable of that, we haven't really investigated yet if that's even possible with a Java application). But thanks for reporting.\nUnfortunately creating this folder manually wouldn't work. It's just not the same folder as the one that Cryptomator for iOS would create.\nTry this on your Mac: Open Terminal and enter:\ncd ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/iCloud\\~com\\~setolabs\\~Cryptomator/Documents\nIt would be interesting to see if this directory even exists. If yes, you can see the contents with ls and even open the readme.pdf with open readme.pdf. I'm just not sure yet why the Cryptomator directory is invisible. I'll look into it!\n. @reg007: Yes, thanks! So now I \"only\" have to figure out why that directory is invisible.\n@GeekApproach: Okay, that's weird...\n\nCould you try this? Obviously not with the Cryptomator directory because it's invisible in your case but with any other file/directory in iCloud Drive.\n. Alright! So yeah... basically, the folder is physically there, but it's invisible...\n. Thanks for the instructions! :) I think I've found the cause of why the Cryptomator directory is invisible. Should be fixed with the next update (hopefully this weekend). I'll leave this issue open until the update is released and confirmed as fixed.\n. :+1:\n. regarding a) So the notification for access permission pops up, you cancel it and then... it goes back to the \"Vaults list\"? And you would expect it to remain in the same screen? If that's the case, it really is a bug and I'll look into it! :) Otherwise could you please elaborate on this?\nregarding b) The problem here is that I'm not able to retrieve the original filename. It's technically impossible (at least to my knowledge, I was surprised as well). What I can get is the creation date/time of that photo. Or at least that's what I thought... and that should be there instead of \"(null)\". So this is also a bug, I guess I'll just use the current date/time for this \"null\" case.\nThanks for reporting!\n. Alright! I'll try to reproduce this. Should hopefully be an easy bug to fix. :)\n. Haha, hopefully I can reproduce it in the simulator! Still working on other stuff right now, but I'll get back to you, if I know more. :D\n. Unfortunately I can't reproduce it in the simulator. It's going straight into the Photos library. (Don't mind the black screen, it's only in the simulator.) And I can't test it on my devices anymore. I'll keep this issue in mind, when I have the chance to use Cryptomator on a new device! But I think it's not that critical anyway. ;)\n\nThe other issue with \"(null)\" will be fixed in the next update. Stay tuned!\n. Closing this for now, because the \"(null)\" issue has been fixed a long time ago and the other one remains irreproducible.\n. Thanks for reporting! Actually this is a known issue (see #49) and will be already solved with the next update version 0.7.0! If everything goes as planned, we will release it this weekend! :)\n. - Regarding * Add existing file to vault (vault is unlocked prior) *\nI can confirm the issue... I'll look into it!\n- Regarding * Multiple Select *\nThis is a known issue. I also want this to happen, it just adds more complexity, but I'm considering it for the next update.\n- Regarding * Save a file to Cryptomator - ie. save a numbers document straight to the vault does not function correctly *\nSaving a file to Cryptomator obviously should work. But if I understand your screenshots correctly you tried to add the file to iCloud Drive (and not Cryptomator). So if you go to \"Add a Place\" or \"More\", there is no Cryptomator?\n- Regarding * Add an existing file from iCloud to Cryptomator. ie. if I already have numbers documents saved under the numbers folder in iCloud, I can not move/copy these to the vault *\nAlright that looks very interesting. I can reproduce and confirm the issue. Also looking into this one!\n. Alright, thanks for reporting the issues! I think I know why Cryptomator is missing. It's not coming in the next update though, but probably in the update after that. This one is a little trickier. :D\n. Fixed the first two issues. Going to look into the other issues probably for the next update!\n. Took me awhile, but fixed the last two issues as well. Closing this for now. If there are any subsequent issues, just open new ones!\n. https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc985335.aspx#BKMK_Ex1\nMaybe this helps?\n. Not sure why the build is not succeeding for you, have you tried the master branch? Multithreading is part of the 0.8 release and already live. You can get the binary from cryptomator.org.\n. Hi @asteppke, thanks for your feedback and performance tests! We could still use some help testing the performance for small files. Does deactivating \"file size obfuscation\" improve the performance significantly?\nYou can do that by that changing line 15 of LengthObfuscatingInputStream.java in the crypto-aes project to:\njava\nprivate int paddingLength = 0;\nFor more convenience, I've uploaded a binary here with just that: https://cryptomator.org/downloads/Cryptomator-0.9.0-SNAPSHOT.exe\n. I've did some tests/research and unfortunately must say that there's nothing we can do here, because this issue also happens on any other WebDAV mount (other protocols are probably affected as well).\n. I'm confused. Was just twiddling around with Office 2016 documents in a Cryptomator vault. Can someone confirm that some magical update has fixed this issue?\nmacOS 10.12.3\nMicrosoft Word 15.30 (170107). Does someone still have OS X 10.11 El Capitan and Office 2016? Read somewhere this might only have been fixed with macOS 10.12 Sierra and the bug still remains with El Capitan or earlier.. Okay, and you are sure that your Office 2016 is up-to-date? If that's the case, it might've been only fixed in Sierra. We can't do anything about it when using WebDAV, because it's an upstream bug. \ud83d\ude15  Either update to Sierra or wait for the FUSE integration #252.. Thanks for reporting! We're aware of this issue, but haven't found a solution yet. The weird thing is that we can't even find any discussions on this matter.\nhttp://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/macosx-port-dev/2014-October/006740.html\nThis is the only information I've found yet. Not sure how to solve this in Java. The link you have provided contains just a custom/specific solution for making the icon look better in dark mode. It wouldn't work like that if you would want to support both light and dark mode. It's probably something that Java doesn't support yet.\nI guess we just have to keep this issue open for a while until we get more information.\n. We probably can use this:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/25207077/how-to-detect-if-os-x-is-in-dark-mode\ndefaults read -g AppleInterfaceStyle\nEither returns Dark (dark mode) or returns domain pair does not exist.\n. If you change to dark menu bar before you start Cryptomator, it should work. It's true that it doesn't work during runtime. Would be a separate issue though.. It's not a silly question at all. The answer is quite simple: There is no disadvantage.\nThe current situation is just how Cryptomator has evolved as a project. It started with WebDAV because it was the fastest and easiest way to offer a virtual drive on all operating systems. And now we're working on a FUSE/Dokany integration, which takes significantly more time to implement.. Thanks for reporting @emuio! To answer your question: Cryptomator should indeed do \"nothing\" while none of the vaults is open. I haven't encountered this issue yet, so I'm not sure what's going on here. @totalvoidness is on vacation right now, we'll look into this when he's back, maybe he has some ideas.\n. Thanks for reporting! #72 could be related. Seems like that this can't be fixed on Windows. We'll look into this regarding Mac!\n. Oh, I should've explained that. Cryptomator is using the WebDAV protocol to mount a \"virtual\" client-side drive. So the unlocked Cryptomator vault you're seeing is using WebDAV. Therefore Cryptomator is dependent on the WebDAV client implementation of the respective operating system. We decided using WebDAV, because every major operating system supports WebDAV.\nAs explained in the related issue, this could lead to a problem on Windows with files larger than 4 GB (and we still have to check this on Mac). We'll stick to WebDAV for now, because we wanted a multi-platform approach from the get-go, but this could be a subject to change in the long run.\nEdit: I have to check with @totalvoidness when he's back from vacation. We'll also check the error-case so that the vault doesn't dismount unexpectedly.\n. Could be a possibility, but splitting files could lead to synchronization issues with the cloud storage service, and therefore more likely lead to data loss. Because of that I don't think splitting is a viable option. Thanks for your suggestion though!\n. That's why we're planning to move on to FUSE #252 and Dokany #207. :grin: However, it doesn't change the fact that Microsoft messed up their WebDAV client in Windows. :wink:\nEdit: Ah, interesting. EncFSMP uses PFM, has also been mentioned in #315. But we're still more likely to implement FUSE/Dokany.\n. Not sure if you followed the whole thread, but our plan is to replace WebDAV with Dokany #207 in the future. And: We won't split files as explained in #299.. Let's say we would split a file in two or more files and they'd be eventually synchronized (uploaded one by one!). Keep in mind that we don't have any control over synchronization. Think of this edge case: Multiple people work on the same file (e.g., because you share a vault with your colleague) and now you have multiple uploads at the same time. This actually doesn't even have to be such an extreme case. Synchronization conflicts can also happen if you have multiple devices and work with synchronization clients that are doing an awful job at keeping things in sync.\nIn that way you could end up with a splitted file that has different origins. Let's say we have file.part1 and file.part2. There is a possibility(!) that file.part1 ends up in \"another version\" than file.part2. Heck, why don't we just throw in file.part1 (1) and file.part2 (1) in there, because they just popped up as synchronization conflicts! Have fun putting everything together. :joy:\nI'm exaggerating, but hopefully you get the idea why there is a small possibility that could destroy(!) your data or make it unreadable. This would be fatal and that's why we prefer atomic operations. This is only guaranteed by keeping the file \"as a whole\".\nI don't really know how Boxcryptor (do they?) or similar software are dealing with this sort of problem. Maybe they don't deal with it at all or they don't have to deal with it. Either because they think that the possibility is extremely low or because they have full control of the synchronization.\nEdit: Okay, I'd like to point out that there certainly are technically sophisticated ways to prevent these sync conflict issues I've mentioned. But they would create a conflict with the user story of #236 that we wanted to solve with #336. There's just a whole lot to think about, we can't just \"split\" files without negative effects.. Please retest with 1.4.0-beta3.. Not yet. WebDAV support is definitely planned for the iOS version, but not implemented yet.\n. We're now collecting iOS issues in a separate repository. You can find it here: https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-ios/issues/1\n. I think what @markuskreusch meant is that we've already discussed this internally. Basically the solution to this issue isn't necessarily to deactivate filename encryption, it would be better if Cryptomator could provide means to reveal the underyling encrypted file.\n@dakkusingh: Or is there any other reason why you would like to deactivate filename encryption?\nWe could (and should) open a new issue for this, but we haven't thought of a good solution on how to solve this technically.\n. Thanks @dfgdfg12, that's a fair point! \ud83d\udc4d\nWe have to think this through, because filename encryption is something that we would like to keep. On the one hand because it's the whole purpose to reveal as little data as possible. On the other hand because (as @overheadhunter mentioned) it would break our current encryption scheme. It's not something that we can \"just change\" without hassle.\nBefore we give up on filename encryption, we should think of ways to make it compelling to use, even for use cases like \"restoring older versions\" and \"restoring deleted files\". I just saw now that you've created issue #236 for that, so we should discuss this in the new issue.\nBut we'll keep this issue open, because from now on it's going to be about whether to add the feature \"disable filename encryption\" or not.\n. For everyone following or stumbling upon this thread: You can decrypt single files with Sanitizer since version 0.9 using the decryptFile command.. The link you provided states that \n\nApple\u2019s 10.6.3 update has indeed finally fixed this bug! If you installed the update and are still experiencing a Finder error, it\u2019s likely you are suffering from a different issue that is beyond the realm of this article.\n\nThat's why I'm curious why the fix with dot_clean even solved your problem. Is it correct that you store the Cryptomator vault inside a FAT32 fomatted disk (e.g. a USB stick)? Or what's your setup like? Maybe we can try to reproduce it.\n. Have you tried to use localhost instead of 0--1.ipv6-literal.net? Maybe something is wrong with that for any unexpected reason.\n. See #802 regarding custom mount flags.. Just to be clear, are you on Windows or OS X? I've looked back through the changes between 0.10.0 and 0.10.1 and there aren't (or at least shouldn't be) any changes regarding the vault mechanism. No crypto changes, no WebDAV changes. It feels to me more like a \"random\" bug, which admittedly isn't great either. Could you update to 0.10.1 again and see if this issue still persists? And if it does, could you lock/unlock the vault multiple times? Just to analyze if there is any (random) pattern.\nMy guess is that your issue isn't specific to 0.10.0 or 0.10.1, because in that regard they should behave the same way.\n. We're working on a major update at the moment. Please be advised that Cryptomator is in beta and integration issues (especially with Windows :smile:) are on our agenda. Thanks for testing and your bug report!\n. Thanks for reporting. Could you please elaborate the issue / screenshots? Does this happen to specific folders or randomly in any of your 1000+ folders? As I can see in the screenshot, your folder name seems to be extremely long. Is that the issue? Files are invisible inside folders with long names?\n. Are there any errors in the logfile at %appdata%/Cryptomator/cryptomator.log that are specific to the invisible files?\n. Hi Eike,\nthat's extremely interesting, because we've already addressed this issue in the past. As documented in https://cryptomator.org/#security (Filename Length Limiting) we're handling filenames that exceed 136 characters.\nWe've come up with this number, because \"the entire path, including the file name, must contain fewer than 255 characters.\" (Source) If I remember correctly, we chose 136, because you'll have 100 characters available for the path, before the vault path begins. \nI would like to know what the cause of your error is:\n1. Either your entire path is too long (exceeding 255 characters)\n2. Or the filename is in itself too long (exceeding something that we didn't expect)\nRegarding 1.: Could you relocate the vault to the top-level and try out if the error still occurs?\nRegarding 2.: Could you set a long filename manually (character by character) and find out what the filename length limit is?\nThanks,\nTobias\n. We've also read this particular security audit on EncFS (and other ones), that's why we came up with our own encryption scheme for Cryptomator to solve/prevent all these known issues in the first place. Our encryption scheme is publicly available on: https://cryptomator.org/#security\nP.S.: No worries, it's perfectly fine to ask here. :) Security is obviously very important to us, so thanks for providing the link!\n. You can't rebuild the master key out of nothing and if you would lose it completely, you're right that you would risk losing access to your files.\n1. After every successful unlock, Cryptomator creates a masterkey.cryptomator.bkup file. Remove the .bkup file extension and you should be good to go.\n2. Most (at least the popular ones) cloud storage services are able to recover/restore files that have been accidentally deleted. This isn't guaranteed, but at least another hopeful way.\nIf you're really worried of losing the master key, because you're for example not using Cryptomator for a cloud storage service, then you could always create a local backup of your master key. Just copy the file to do so.\n. Unfortunately this is a known issue in Office 2016 for Mac (Source). At the moment, there is nothing we can do about it. Any future releases of Cryptomator might offer alternative filesystem frontends that might solve this issue.\n. Duplicate of #70\n. Received another feature request regarding \"Option to not open File Explorer when mounting (setting per encrypted vault)\". Should I open a new and separate issue? Because in this issue two feature requests are mixed up.\n. I have the same understanding and agree with you.\nDo you already have an idea on how to solve this in the UI? Add a checkbox like \"Automatically reveal drive after unlock\" to the global settings? Yeah, label is too long, but I don't know if there is a more concise description that's also easy to understand.. Moved issue to https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-ios/issues/2\n. Hi @snufiks, we just released the new version 0.11! We made a lot of changes under-the-hood, so maybe your issue has been addressed. Could you please re-test your issue? Thanks!\n. We made some changes to how long filenames are handled. Just to be sure, could you test this again with our latest version 0.11 @mmuehlen? Thanks! :)\n. The new version has an updated encryption scheme, so you need to migrate your data manually:\n1. Copy the data out of your vault using the old Cryptomator version\n2. Put your data back into a vault created with the new version 0.11\nI hope you understand, that we don\u2019t offer any automatic migration while still in beta.\n. Sadly this is the way Windows handles WebDAV volumes. So unfortunately there is nothing that we can do about it. This issue is also discussed in #80.\n. That's the simplicity of Cryptomator. You don't have to manage keys to make it work from all your devices! :) Don't panic if I say this: The master key is stored inside the vault (.cryptomator folder). Why this is secure, see @overheadhunter's answer in #121.\n. Hey @canitb. The new version has an updated encryption scheme, so you need to migrate your data manually:\n1. Copy the data out of your vault using the old Cryptomator version\n2. Put your data back into a vault created with the new version 0.11\nI hope you understand, that we don\u2019t offer any automatic migration while still in beta.\n. Short answer: Yes. :)\n. Seems to be fixed.. Thank you for your suggestion! Yes, we're most likely to support WebDAV with the next update. I've already added an issue here: https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-ios/issues/1\nWe probably can't integrate BitTorrent Sync, because the docs says this:\n\nDoes the API support developing for mobile devices?\nNot at this time.\n. Hi @gwoerheide, I'm not sure why you're getting this dialog, but try to just login as \"Gast\". We're using WebDAV to mount a virtual drive, that's why it looks like a remote access, but in reality it's just a loopback to your own machine. Does this work?\n. Hm, it shouldn't. I'll have to ask @overheadhunter if he has any ideas on how to resolve this issue. I have some wild ideas that maybe something in the /etc/hosts isn't correctly set (not sure if you have even changed anything there), so that localhost can't be reached or something like that. We'll get back to you as soon as possible!\n. Of course, we care! There could be different edge cases in which Finder is messing up a simple localhost WebDAV connection, but this has been discussed heavily in this issue.\n\nThe switch to FUSE is still in development and should solve this and many other WebDAV-related issues (that are still edge cases, it works totally fine under \"normal\" conditions).\nSorry that it's taking some time, but we care deeply and try to solve all issues.\n. @greg75 This is actually a \"new\" issue and has a different cause, even though it's somehow related to this one.\nI also have the exact same issue you've described and I'm quite certain that this is a new problem with Sierra (macOS 10.2). I think it's an upstream-bug in Finder, even though I'm not 100% sure yet. We'll have a look at this again for our next minor version 1.3 and do some extended testing/research.\nHopefully, we can find a fix, but this is probably another issue that will be solved with the FUSE integration (#252).\nWorkaround\nKeep everything of this dialog in default and just press \"Connect\". After that the virtual drive should mount as before.. Hm, so you kept your username and left password blank? Honestly thought that this should work (at least it does on my system). Just to be sure: Maybe it's some other error? Could you please look inside the log file located at ~/Library/Logs/Cryptomator/cryptomator.log if there are any errors?. Might be fixed with webdav-nio-adapter/caa520f, needs to be tested in 1.3.0 RC 5.. Hi Steve, just a quick question, which cloud storage service are you using? -Tobias\n. Unfortunately some users are experiencing issues with iCloud Drive at the moment. Maybe this also applies to you. For your information: Even if the interaction with iCloud Drive on Cryptomator for iOS seems to be \"instant\" (e.g. you don't see any upload progress) doesn't mean that the synchronization is \"instant\". The synchronization happens in the background and there is no visual feedback in the iOS app yet. We're going to fix that with an update.\nBut can you at least open/unlock the vault (Tresor) on both iOS and OS X?\n. I believe I could reproduce the issue. Deleting a file in the iOS app doesn't seem to sync with iCloud Drive. We'll investigate this, thanks for reporting this issue!!\n. Cryptomator for iOS update (1.0.1) is on its way, it should be just a matter of hours now.\n. We're working on a fix, there is some error with GitHub Pages (where are website is normally hosted). In the meantime, please visit: http://backup.cryptomator.org/\n. Alright, website should be up and running again! We moved our site from GitHub Pages to a self-hosted server. What a mess.\n. Are you sure? Totally forgot about this, but I've also searched for this a while back and I used:\ndefaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores true\nSeems to be working for me. You have to relaunch Finder though (alt-right-click on Finder in the Dock).\n. Seems to be that there is something similar for Windows: http://superuser.com/questions/2345/how-can-i-suppress-those-annoying-thumbs-db-files-in-windows-vista-and-windows-7\n```\nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Explorer]\n\"DisableThumbsDBOnNetworkFolders\"=dword:00000001\n```\n\nIf you place that content in its own text file (e.g. with Notepad) with a .REG extension, you can double-click to import on any Windows Vista or Windows 7 machine to apply the setting. Be careful editing your registry directly.\n\nNot tested though and please do this with caution.\n. You're right, Martin (@makramakra). I've played around with it a little bit, it doesn't seem to work properly. Just thought it might've been a temporary workaround, I never said that this will be the definite solution.\nHowever, the solution might be more complex than it might look like at first glance. Spontaneously I can think of two solutions:\n1. Ignore these files completely. When the filesystem / operating system tries to create a file with a certain name or pattern, it's going to be denied.\n2. Allow these files to be created, but handle them differently by not creating physical encrypted copies on the other end.\nI don't like either one of the solutions, both could cause more unexpected problems. But I can't think of any better solution for now. As @mologie mentioned, it's technically challenging to implement this due to Cryptomator's transparent encryption.\nI'm not even sure if this problem should be solved with Cryptomator, because in my opinion it should be something handled by the operating system. I believe this issue is another disadvantage of using a network drive. Maybe this can be resolved by the operating system with a more native filesystem like FUSE, but I haven't done any research on it: #206\n. To keep the discussion going, we've received an interesting idea on Twitter: How about we keep synchronizing these files, but hiding/suppressing these files on each operating system?\nThat means e.g. hiding .DS_Store and ._* on Windows and hiding Thumbs.db on OS X/Linux.\n. We decided that it's not up to Cryptomator to decide which files to blacklist without causing unexpected side effects. We may reopen this issue in the future.. Hi Jonas, could you elaborate the issue? Do you mean when multiple users access the same document on different devices? This actually doesn't concern Cryptomator, because Cryptomator is only responsible for encryption. Synchronization is still done by the installed synchronization clients. So the behavior of accessing the same document from multiple devices remains the same as before. -Tobias\n. My guess is that Word doesn't create temporary files (preceded with ~) on network drives, but I haven't verified this. Shouldn't lock states be local? It doesn't make sense that lock states work remotely. I think Microsoft Office uses those temporary files to emulate lock states.\n. ~~I'm trying to elaborate that there is a difference between lock states on your drive (which we fully support if I'm not mistaken @overheadhunter) and the proprietary methods for locking that Microsoft Office is using through temporary files.~~ Edit: Scratch that.\nIt was a question if Word is creating temporary files on network drives, but if you can already confirm that, I'm not sure why this remote locking mechanism is not working. And that's basically what we're trying to find out. :)\n~~I know it makes sense from a user's point of view to have remote locking, but it's a proprietary feature by Microsoft and technically speaking not the job of the operating system (like locking). I don't want to exclude any other possibilities per se, but my educated guess is that it has to do something with the WebDAV virtual drive that Cryptomator is providing.~~ Edit: Scratch this, too.\nIt would be pretty easy to find out if it has to do something with WebDAV by using a \"pure\" WebDAV server. For example here: http://www.ajaxbrowser.com/\nIf the remote locking works with that, then the chances are high that this is something that we can fix. If remote locking doesn't work on a regular WebDAV drive, I don't think that there is anything that we can do.\n. Hm, I think I may be wrong, talking to @overheadhunter and @markuskreusch right now. It still would be great to see what happens with a regular WebDAV drive, but it may actually has to do with passing through lock states.\n. Thanks for your report. The error means that the iOS app doesn't find the masterkey.cryptomator file inside the vault. We don't have a solution/workaround yet, but we're working on a fix and we'll keep you updated here: https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-ios/issues/11\nSorry for any inconvenience caused by this.\n. If you need some sort of visual reference, I think I like this one:\n\nThe link isn't important for the moment, but I think it's something that we will do regardless, because we'd like to explain on our website, what the password strength indicator means. Also the labeling\n\"Password Strength: \u2026\"\nis easier on the eyes (doesn't jump around while you're typing the password).\nJust my thoughts on this topic. :) But I'm looking forward to your implementation and your ideas! :+1:\n. Thank you! I just have a minor suggestion for improvement, purely from a visual point-of-view. :)\nThe bar shouldn't be a gradient, it should be a solid color. And while the bar fills up, the color should fill from red over yellow to green. So yeah, basically it's just the color that has to be changed, everything else is perfectly fine!\nIt would be interesting to know what the \"strength rating algorithm\" is. Is it purely dependent on the password length at the moment as a proof-of-concept or is it some more complex algorithm to calculate the password's entropy?\n. In my opinion and if you think you're done, you can create a pull request! :+1: We've created a password-strength branch, in which you can create the pull request to. Fyi, we'll probably hold this feature back for version 1.1, because we're preparing a 1.0.4 patch with bug fixes first for the master branch.\n. Yeah, we still have no idea why that happens. :joy:\n. Hi Steffen, you can actually achieve this! The thing is that Cryptomator sets a new random port for the virtual drive after every restart of the app so that the location isn't always the same. However you can set a static port:\n1. Go to the settings of Cryptomator (\"gear\" button in the bottom left)\n2. Set WebDAV Port to some number ~~(it's recommended to set the port to a number between 49152 and 65535, see here)~~ (it's recommended to set the port to a number between 1024 and 49151, see here for a list of registered ports that you should avoid)\n3. Restart Cryptomator app\nAfter that the location of your virtual drive won't change anymore. -Tobias\n. We'll investigate this further, but I can't promise anything yet. It could be an upstream bug so that copying .exe files to a network drive just doesn't work in some cases on Windows. But maybe it should work and it's a bug on our end. We'll look into it!\n. No worries, we'll keep #78 closed for now, because this issue might be sufficient.\nUnfortunately, this is one of the issues that can't be fixed while using WebDAV. That's why we're going to switch to Dokany #207.. Unfortunately there is nothing that we can do about it when using WebDAV. However the good thing is that it's merely a display issue. Some users have reported that they could copy more data than the shown capacity of the virtual drive with TeraCopy, when you run into \"not enough space\" errors.\nRelated issue #80.\n. Yes, WinFsp has been suggested in #339. Congrats on the 1.0 release @billziss-gh! :+1: It looks very promising.\nWe haven't made any final decisions yet, so we'll have to see, which library works out best for Cryptomator. :). Hi @gwarah, I suppose you mean version 0.10.0, but yeah back in the beta, we didn't offer any automatic migration. You would have to do the migration manually. You can download older versions of Cryptomator here: https://cryptomator.org/downloads/#allVersions\n. Just saw that issue #71 is related. Not sure about an upgrade note on our website, because it was a beta for a reason. In the future we'll offer an automatic migration, that's why a notice wouldn't be needed either. But thanks for your suggestion! :+1:\n. This is actually pretty insane. Thank you so much @Cycor for finding this! :tada:. @markuskreusch I think this is quite a severe bug and could be easily solved by reverting the mount behavior for OS X 10.9 or below. That's why I've set the milestone to 1.0.4.\n~~Unfortunately I can't test this, because my Macs can't run a VM for OS X 10.9. That's why I hoped that @overheadhunter could take a look into this with his Mac.~~ Edit: I was wrong, it totally works on my Mac. Just misinterpreted an error message.\nIdeally we could fix the current AppleScript for mounting the WebDAV drive, but I'm okay with a classic if/else routine and just use the previous method for older OSs. ;)\n. Duplicate of #15\n. Thanks for reporting, we'll take a closer look at this again, because some time has passed by and I'm also wondering what we can do about it.\n. @flyinggrizzly Just a quick question, is your MacBook from Early 2011 or later? There could be a fix with the latest JDK and we're looking for someone who can test it.\n. Thanks for reporting! Unfortunately there is nothing that we can do about it when using WebDAV. Some users have reported that they could copy more data than the shown capacity of the virtual drive with TeraCopy instead of copying files in small batches.\nDuplicate of #80.\n. Thanks for your report! We haven't tried the combination \"Windows + iCloud Drive\" before, but we will try to confirm your issue (even though we don't have Windows 8, but Windows 10 might behave the same). It's interesting that \"iOS -> Windows\" works, but \"Windows -> iOS\" doesn't and only inside the Cryptomator folder. That's a really strange edge case and I can't say if this is something that we can even fix. It could also be a bug with iCloud Drive so that Apple has to fix it. But we'll do our own testings, we'll keep you posted!\n. Hi Steffen, we've implemented a migration with 1.0.3, which actually just removes the .cryptomator bundle extension of the vault. That's why I'm quite confused by your screenshot that ownCloud still tries to synchronize the vault with the extension. Maybe it's just a misleading error message, because oC_Dokumente.cryptomator shouldn't exist anymore and it's now called oC_Dokumente? -Tobias\n. Thanks! Is it possible that issue #15 relates to yours? We haven't found a fix yet for Macs with dual GPUs, or is it unrelated and you don't have two GPUs?\n. Can you please elaborate what the problem is? I see tools like SyncBack and SyncToy in your screenshots. Does Cryptomator at least work normally with the Windows Explorer or is it already failing there? From the screenshots and the log file I can't see how this is directly related to Cryptomator. Maybe those sync tools have issues with WebDAV/network drives?\nWe'll try to look into this as soon as we can. We're just on a really tight schedule at the moment, that's why we can't test this immediately.\n. Just tested this with a regular WebDAV drive. It seems to me that this is a behavior by Finder on OS X that it doesn't preserve the original dates. This probably can only be solved with an alternative frontend like FUSE as discussed in #206.\n. Is that so? Always thought that Windows wasn't affected by this, because Windows Explorer is doing a PROPPATCH. Could be wrong though, but yeah for Windows we'll switch to Dokany (Issue #207).. Wait what? The current situation is that WebDAV clients tend to not set the modification dates properly, which is out of Cryptomator's control. That's why we're hoping to fix this particular issue, when the FUSE/Dokany integration is finished. Of course, we'd like to support date attributes then. Hard and soft links are just something that we'll have to see in the future, but that's not what this issue is about. :smile:. Unfortunately, I don't have any recommendation. I haven't looked into backup softwares in detail yet, but I'm also a Mac guy, so I'm really the wrong one to ask for Windows advice/tools. \ud83d\ude05. Please retest with 1.4.0-beta3.. Just a thought: Maybe the \"default\" button is broken so that pressing return/enter doesn't have an effect. Try to click on the unlock button. Sounds weird, but I want to exclude this possibility. :joy:\n. Another user reported via email that it's not working with Ubuntu 16.10, when copying the password from KeePass. Weirdly enough it's possible to\n- paste the password to a text editor first,\n- copy the password from the text editor,\n- paste the password to Cryptomator.\nNot the prettiest workaround. \ud83d\ude05\n. With my suggested pattern there are (26+10)^16 == ~8 * 10^24 permutations, so that brute-force attacks are very unlikely to succeed. Theoretically it might look like a weakened security, because you could always choose a stronger password than this (e.g. with a password manager) that you won't forget.\nThe thing is that we have to consider the best possible security and(!) availability for the average user without restraining edge cases. In my opinion it's very important to give the user the option to generate a recovery code, because it's our responsibility to provide all means to reduce the possibility of data loss.\nIn my opinion the question is: Should we always generate a recovery code or is it something optional?\nAlways:\n- Pro: The average user is less likely to skip this, so that we've reached our goal to reduce the possibility of data loss.\n- Con: There is a slight chance that non-technical people are discouraged to use Cryptomator, because it feels more complex.\nOptional:\n- Pro: Won't disrupt the current workflow.\n- Con: Not sure how many, maybe some or most people will skip the generation of a recovery code, because it's human nature to do things much later that seem \"not important now\".\n. You have to store the recovery code on your own. There is no email or anything else involved.\nMaybe the question, which needs to be answered is: Why would I need a password and(!) a recovery code? Couldn't I just make sure to store the password on my own?\nWe're talking here about ideal cases, but this isn't how most people treat their passwords. In an ideal case, you wouldn't need a recovery code, because you treat your password like something that will never be forgotten (e.g. stored in a password manager or somewhere else).\nWhen we're talking about the average case (and yes, this has already happened(!) with Cryptomator users), you think of a password, maybe even a completely new one, because you don't want to use the same password over and over again. You just type it once and it'll be in your short-term memory. After a while, you'll forget it. That's the current workflow and this is something that we have to prevent, because it's already happening as I said.\nThat's why a recovery code has a different purpose. A recovery code should be long enough so that it doesn't weaken security, but also isn't something that a person has to remember (like a password... in the average case a password is used as something that can be remembered).\n. The purpose of Cryptomator is to protect the files in the cloud. When you store your recovery code locally (e.g. writing it on a piece of paper and hide it somewhere in your home), I don't see how this affects the security in a realistic way.\nCloud providers won't come to your home and search for a recovery code. But I understand your concern, that's why I'll leave this feature request open for discussion, because there could be a better solution to \"oh no, I forgot my password and my 80 GB of data are lost\" than a recovery code.\n@cryptomator/collaborators What do you guys think?\n. This won't fit the requirement of a recovery code. It shouldn't be variable in length, because then we wouldn't hit the sweet spot of \"secure + usable\".\n. Maybe I didn't understand your first suggestion, but I thought you meant to encode the user's password. We don't know the length of the password, because it's the user's choice. It just doesn't make sense to create a recovery code from that.\nYour second suggestion (encode the 256-bit key) is pretty secure, but just isn't usable. It's far too long. Let's take a hex representation (base64 isn't human-readable, it's too technical), then we're talking about 64 characters. It's just waaay out of line, far too long for a user to write down. A long recovery code increases the chance of making mistakes while writing it down, that would defeat the whole purpose of it.\nNot sure where your 88 bytes come from, but that would be even worse.\n. Alright. Nevertheless pretty insane. :joy:\n. Maybe I wasn't clear enough with this issue, but the recovery code isn't derived from anything, it will be generated completely new. My suggestion wasn't to encode anything, so it doesn't follow hex, base32, base64 or any other encoding method. It's a pattern with random-generated characters taken from a self-defined range. \nIn my opinion 16 chars is the maximum that you can expect of average users to write down (I've explained why already) while still being extremely secure against brute-force attacks.\nLet's say we still would want a variable-sized code. With that restriction in mind (max. 16 chars) this doesn't give us a lot of range. So it's... up to 16 chars. Why would we even decide to do this? What's the benefit of a variable-sized code? That's why I said it doesn't make sense.\n\"Nag the user to write down his password\" isn't an option, we don't want to annoy a user. :laughing: But we'll do some explanation as suggested earlier:\n\nAgreed, we should add some explanation of the relevance of the passphrase in the \"create\" screen with a checkbox to add an optional recovery key afterwards (it can't be done prior to creating the actual key).\n\nI respect your opinion that you don't need a recovery code, but I hope you understand that some users might find a recovery code desirable. I learned from this discussion that we're going to implement this as an optional feature, but it would be careless to just ignore the fact that some users would appreciate this.\n. @SecTec Your argument \"83 bit < 256 bit\" is invalid for passwords and the suggested recovery code. We're using the scrypt key derivation function, which hardens the password (and recovery code) against brute-force attacks. Please look at the table 1 on page 14 of the scrypt white paper to get a sense of why neither a password nor a recovery code have to be 256 bit long.\n. To keep you updated: This issue is resolved and closed for now, but we haven't actually implemented a \"password recovery\" mechanism as suggested in the first post. We've come to the conclusion to keep it simple. When the user enters a password for setting up a vault, there is a info with:\n\nIMPORTANT: There is no way to recover your data, if you forget your password.\n\nThank you all for the discussion! :+1:\n. Have you tried to disable Web Proxy Autodiscovery as described in our Wiki?\n. Thank you for your suggestion! We already have a feature request open: #43\n. Not to forget that we would have to instruct the user to install the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) manually, which isn't feasible for the average user, and would totally kill the usability of Cryptomator.\n. Have you tried to disable Web Proxy Autodisovery? As described here: https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/wiki/Windows-Problems#slow-virtual-drives\n. Have you added the .cryptomator extension back to the vault? Unfortunately with 0.10 it was mandatory that the folder had also this extension, that's why you can't add it to Cryptomator.\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. Unfortunately I can't add too much to finding a solution to this problem. I just wanted to mention that 0 is a valid port. It means that the port is automatically assigned by the operating system.\nYou could set a fixed port (and then restart Cryptomator). Maybe there are some settings in your firewalls and/or other security softwares, in which you could allow this specific port. Even though you've mentioned that you've already deactivated everything.\nI can remember way back that someone had Zone Alarm installed and deactivating it didn't help. He had to uninstall it. But I'm not sure if this is feasible for you to do, that's why it's hard to say which software or setting might make things hard for Cryptomator.\n. Just to be sure: Have you tried to disable Web Proxy Autodiscovery? As described here: https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/wiki/Windows-Problems#slow-virtual-drives\n. We're currently working on a new frontend that would solve all WebDAV-related issues: #207\nThis will increase performance significantly.\n. You're right. Maybe we \"could\" do it somehow (haven't thought this through, we probably would have to simulate this behavior, lol), but it would be a workaround and add more complexity (which is bad and that's why we haven't put a priority on this issue).\nIt's going to be very interesting, when we add the FUSE/Dokany integration. Don't know what the behavior would be like in that case, but my guess is that this issue will be resolved automatically then.\n. Thank you for your suggestion, but I believe you'd have to look for malware protection softwares that are specifically designed to detect and prevent CryptoLockers from doing any harm.\nI understand that it might be tempting to implement this kind of security feature directly in Cryptomator. However, we would like to keep Cryptomator lightweight and it's not a software for malware protection. Its only task should be transparent encryption of files.\n. Thank you for your bug report! I can confirm this issue. Interestingly this doesn't happen with Google Chrome. That's why I guess that it could be an upstream bug. But I can't say that for sure, we would have to do further tests first.\n. I've tested HTML files again with a regular WebDAV drive. Same issue here. That's why this is something that we can't solve without implementing a new frontend, as described here #252.\n. Sorry, we overlooked this bug report! We're extremely busy at the moment, but we'll have a look at this at a later point.\n. Ah okay! Alright, my suggestion is: Don't show the option at all if it's never available on an operating system. Disabling it isn't the cleanest solution.\n. Thank you for the info! However, we've recently received another bug report that \"the preferred drive letter is resetting back to 'assign automatically'\".\nWe'll take a brief look at this at some point, before closing the issue.\n. I'm more interested in the locations of the \"Checking for updates...\" label with its loading spinner and how the transition looks like into \"Update check failed.\" (btw, no \"...\" here because the process has ended and isn't a running task anymore). My guess is that the spinner is in in-between (in that empty space), am I right? Can the spinner and the retry button be on top of each other?\nTo the button itself: I don't really have a preference. It's totally fine with \"Retry\" (more localization though), but of course we could try out some icons from http://ionicons.com/ (we're already using them in Cryptomator, e.g. the gear icon in the bottom left).\n. All right then, I guess I just have to see it in action. \ud83d\ude04 But sounds good! Regarding the icon: I think the \"refresh\" icons are more suitable than the \"loop\" icons. I think we've used the iOS and Android icons of ionicons, because their strokes are thinner and looked better for our stuff.\n. Oh, I thought you meant \"empty label with an icon\". \ud83d\ude04 So without the label \"Retry\". Yeah, that's the thing about the icon. I'm not so sure without seeing the alternatives. I'd like to see how ion-android-refresh and ion-ios-refresh-empty look like. But really, these are just small details, this is a lot polishing through trial/error.\nThe functionality is more important here. I don't know if we should add an artificial \"pause\" to make the transition less abrupt. It's an interesting idea though. So that the user can at least read everything. It wouldn't even matter that much if it's technically wrong. But I'm not sure if this is too fake. \ud83d\ude06\n. Okay, you can use the feature/update-check-retry branch for your PR. Thanks!\n. Is it feasible to offer this only with inactivity? Similar to a screen saver. Not sure how this will impact performance, but activity could be measured by \"is the filesystem accessing the drive\".\n. If I'm not mistaken, this isn't really a feature request, but more like a bug report. Duplicate of #270. Nevertheless, thank you for reporting this issue!\n. This is indeed extremely unsettling. Both 4242 and 42427 are in the range of registered ports. Apart from that, Cryptomator would throw an error if the port isn't open. That's why I don't understand why a different port would solve this issue.\nWhat happens if you change the port back to 42427?\n. Thank you for your bug report @Surroot! We've received a similar bug report via email that Cryptomator is unable to mount a drive on the latest beta version of macOS 10.12.5. That's why I've created a new GitHub issue #481, because this issue isn't the same the one discussed here.. We still haven't found a solution for \"error 53\". It has been haunting us for months and we can't figure out the cause of it. Related issues #210 #262.\n. You should see two files with almost the same name, e.g.\nR2FAXATTCE6F42ZQPCMN7YJ2UPZFPN2IF2PL3EJJFU====== (this is a file)\nand\nR2FAXATTCE6F42ZQPCMN7YJ2UPZFPN2IF2PL3EJJFU======_ (this looks like a folder due to the _, but actually is a file that has been automatically renamed by our conflict resolver).\nIt's very likely that the conflict resolver introduced with 1.1 just renamed\nR2FAXATTCE6F42ZQPCMN7YJ2UPZFPN2IF2PL3EJJFU======_conflict-20160608-114842\nto\nR2FAXATTCE6F42ZQPCMN7YJ2UPZFPN2IF2PL3EJJFU======_.\nWorkaround\nWhat you can do is: Rename\nR2FAXATTCE6F42ZQPCMN7YJ2UPZFPN2IF2PL3EJJFU======_\nto\nR2FAXATTCE6F42ZQPCMN7YJ2UPZFPN2IF2PL3EJJFU====== foobar.\nIt's important to remove the _ in this case and just append any string. If you browse that directory inside the virtual drive, the conflict resolver will automatically detect this file as a conflict and perform its renaming magic.\nUnfortunately, we didn't think of this case. Thanks for reporting this bug! We'll work on an appropriate solution.\n. Cryptomator doesn't have a mechanism for revealing a ciphertext file corresponding to a cleartext file. I believe we've discussed this somewhere to be a possible feature request, but I can't find the issue on GitHub right now. So yeah, everything is encrypted and even the directory hierarchy is obfuscated, which makes it even harder. https://cryptomator.org/architecture/#nameEncryption\nHowever, there is a little \"trick\" you could do to determine the correct encrypted directory.\n1. Navigate to the folder on your virtual drive, which have the conflicted files.\n2. Do some activity there. E.g., you could rename a file, or you could drag & drop some text file with no contents to it.\n3. Look for the notifications of the ownCloud client (or go inside the ownCloud app and look for the latest activities).\nNow you know, which encrypted folder is the correct one.\n. We're still working on a solution, but it takes some time, because we will update Cryptomator's encryption scheme. And for that we're going to write an automatic migration routine. In the meantime, there is a simpler workaround for this issue (if you're using OS X or Linux):\nsh\ncd /path/to/vault\nfind . -type f -name *_ -size +87c -exec bash -c \"echo \\\"mv -v {} {}\\\" | sed -e 's/_$/-foo/g'\" \\; | bash\nEdit: After executing these commands, you can safely use Cryptomator 1.1. However, if ownCloud detects synchronization conflicts, the original problem would reoccur. The best way is to:\n1. Execute script\n2. Open Cryptomator vault with v1.1 (so that our sync conflic resolver can do its work properly this time)\n3. From now on use Cryptomator v1.0.x until we've released a new version\n. I think #40 would also go into the same direction. Automation is something that we would like to offer sooner than later. But we're working on other tasks at the moment (Android, FUSE/Dokany, iOS, etc.), that's why we haven't made much progress on the automation front.\nI understand that it might be tempting to implement this kind of feature in Cryptomator to circumvent key loggers (or similar tools). However, we want to keep Cryptomator lightweight and your suggestion seems to add some complexity. Cryptomator's security target is the protection of cloud files. If your machine is compromised, you would have more serious problems. It's better to install other tools that are specialized in detecting/removing key loggers.\n. Build files: https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/tree/develop/main/ant-kit\nBuild container: https://github.com/cryptomator/builder-containers\n. I'm really not familiar with the Linux builds, but my guess is that we're just using the \"default\" JavaFX packaging. http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/deployment/self-contained-packaging.htm\nIt looks like the installation location is indeed /opt. So if it's a best practice to have a symlink to /bin, I guess we're open for any improvements to the build script! \ud83d\ude04\n. Not feasible. This would \"kill\" synchronization and could potentially lead to unreadable files. Because of things like synchronization conflicts, this isn't that unlikely. This would also complicate restoring old versions that cloud storage services typically provide. Thanks for your suggestion though!\nEdit: For future reference I've added further explanation. Taken from #82.\nLet's say we would split a file in two or more files and they'd be eventually synchronized (uploaded one by one!). Keep in mind that we don't have any control over synchronization. Think of this edge case: Multiple people work on the same file (e.g., because you share a vault with your colleague) and now you have multiple uploads at the same time. This actually doesn't even have to be such an extreme case. Synchronization conflicts can also happen if you have multiple devices and work with synchronization clients that are doing an awful job at keeping things in sync.\nIn that way you could end up with a splitted file that has different origins. Let's say we have file.part1 and file.part2. There is a possibility(!) that file.part1 ends up in \"another version\" than file.part2. Heck, why don't we just throw in file.part1 (1) and file.part2 (1) in there, because they just popped up as synchronization conflicts! Have fun putting everything together. \ud83d\ude02\nI'm exaggerating, but hopefully you get the idea why there is a small possibility that could destroy(!) your data or make it unreadable. This would be fatal and that's why we prefer atomic operations. This is only guaranteed by keeping the file \"as a whole\".\n[...]\nI'd like to point out that there certainly are technically sophisticated ways to prevent these sync conflict issues I've mentioned. But they would create a conflict with the user story of #236 that we wanted to solve with #336. There's just a whole lot to think about, we can't just \"split\" files without negative effects.. Thanks @SecTec, you nailed it. :grin: Duplicate of #105.\n. What filename pattern do these 0 bytes files have? I can remember a case, where someone had a directory file (with v1.1.0, so at that time with a \"_\" suffix) with 0 bytes size, which was extremely critical, because it would lead to an infinite loop in the virtual drive. A directory file with 0 bytes points to the root folder and should never exist. I didn't understand why that happened.\nEdit: Oh... wait... you said in the virtual drive... I thought in the encrypted file. Nevermind.\n. It's safe to delete the files with a \"\" suffix. But really check for a \"\" suffix, not contains \"_\".\nFiles have the same Base32 pattern as always.\nFolders have the new \"0\" prefix instead of the \"_\" suffix.\n. Encrypted filenames that don't begin with \"0\" and clearly aren't files but were folders in vault version 3 cause the problem you've mentioned (same name in the virtual drive with 0 bytes size).\nHere is a shell script that cleans up those files:\nsh\ncd /path/to/vault\nfind . -type f -not -name 0* -size -88c -exec rm -i {} \\;\nThe problem is, we don't have a script for Windows at the moment. Is there any chance that you have experience with writing scripts in Windows?\nWhat the script does: It finds the files that don't have a \"0\" prefix and are less than 88 bytes in size. These files can be safely deleted.\n. There is one more case that is quite subtle. Our sync conflict resolver probably has already done this:\nBIAGOIQDRLW36ZAUUKPVA7BEB4DH5Z5WWQ======_ (1)\nrename to\nBIAGOIQDRLW36ZAUUKPVA7BEB4DH5Z5WWQ====== (2)\neven though a\n0BIAGOIQDRLW36ZAUUKPVA7BEB4DH5Z5WWQ====== (3)\nalready exists.\n(1) This looks like a sync conflict of a file, because it begins with a valid Base32 pattern and then there is any random string after that. You have to remember that our current sync conflict resolver only knows about the vault version 4 filename patterns. It doesn't know that the \"_\" suffix is from vault version 3.\n(2) This filename didn't exist in the folder yet, that's why our sync conflict resolver happily renames the file to this. And it thinks that its job is done.\n(3) This is the only file that should exist, because this is the correct directory file for our current vault version 4.\nThat's why it's not sufficient anymore to only look for encrypted filenames that have a \"_\" suffix. Because our \"dumb\" sync conflict resolver already renamed those files. That's the only reason why you're seeing files with 0 bytes size that have the same name as the folder in the decrypted WebDAV drive.\nSorry for all this mess, I guess we didn't think this through. It's quite frustrating that synchronization clients are doing such a bad job. We're currently thinking about a more user-friendly solution.\n. The filenames get decrypted on-the-fly. Usually when you're navigating through the virtual drive (which triggers directory listings). When Cryptomator is unable to decrypt the filename (because the name doesn't fit in one of the filename patterns), the sync conflict resolver gets active and does its thing.\nThat's why you have some files that still have the \"_\" suffix and some files that have been falsely renamed.\n. Fixed with release 1.1.2\nIt's not possible anymore that you have a 0 bytes file with the same name as a folder in the same directory. You'll still see a 0 bytes file in the decrypted virtual drive, when the synchronization client doesn't work properly, but at least this conflicted file doesn't have the same name anymore, so it can be safely deleted by the user.\nWe can't fully solve this issue without this compromise, because the sync conflict resolver shouldn't have knowledge of the old vault version after a successful migration. That's why the synchronization client of the cloud storage service is at fault, but at least with this hotfix the sync conflict resolver always detects conflicts as a conflict and doesn't rename it to a non-conflict filename as in version 1.1.1.\n. Interesting idea. I'll spin it a little further: How about introducing more specific versions instead of relying only on a global vault version.\nWe could do something like:\n- File's filename version\n- Directory's filename version\n- File content version\nE.g.\n- Vault version 3 supports file's filename version 1, directory's filename version 1, and file content version 1\n- Vault version 4 supports file's filename version 1, directory's filename version 2, and file content version 1\nThere are two reasons, why I'm thinking of this solution:\n1. Obviously due to this issue that sync conflicts can mix up files from multiple vault versions, even though a vault has been successfully migrated.\n2. If we're introducing new vault versions, we don't have to change EVERY single file, just the ones that are affected. E.g. if we would introduce vault version 5, we wouldn't have to rename every single file (or even read/write every single file, if we'd store the vault version inside the file content).\nI think we should discuss this in a separate issue. Maybe this whole crazy versioning isn't necessary and we still could introduce something like an \"Integrity Check\" button as you've suggested. Some kind of Troubleshooting / Clean Up / Janitor process.\nI'd like to hear some thoughts from the other @cryptomator/collaborators, before creating a new issue.\n. Unfortunately, I have no news on this. We're quite busy with other tasks, that's why I can't give you any update yet. It might become relevant, when we make changes on our encryption scheme, that's why we'll probably decide on this \"on demand\". So yes, it's still being considered, but not in the short-term.\nOur main focus are currently the Android app, cryptolib (which will be used by the Android app and at some point used by the Desktop app), cryptofs (it's all connected :D), and FUSE/Dokany integration.\n. Interesting, that could be an issue! Currently, I don't have a Windows machine. @overheadhunter or @markuskreusch can you try to reproduce this? \ud83d\ude06 I've tried it on my Mac and it was also buggy in another way (wasn't able to unlock at all). I think it's safe to say that you've actually found a bug. :grin:\n. This stands in conflict with #49. I know that it can be confusing, because Cryptomator doesn't look like a menu bar application, even though it's supposed to be one. I don't know if we can switch between \"Dock application\" and \"MenuBar application\" in run-time. Let's wait for the others to respond (probably after the weekend), but my guess is that we can't do anything about this with Java/JavaFX. Btw, I prefer the menu bar application, because Cryptomator should be \"invisible\" when it's properly set up.\n. This behavior is defined by setting the LSUIElement key/value pair inside the Info.plist: https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-osx/blob/master/package/macosx/Info.plist#L55\nMaybe this is something that would work: http://stackoverflow.com/a/7004578/1759462\nExcept that I don't know if we can call this function with Java. I really have no idea, it's probably not possible at all.\n@elsesiy: We have a white icon for OS X, when it's in dark mode. Admittedly, it doesn't work, if you switch to dark mode while Cryptomator is running, but it should work in general.\n. Hi @gcstang, you probably forgot to attach the log file. Don't forget to redact any sensitive information.\nConflicting files could exist for several reasons. E.g. working on the same files from multiple devices could lead to version conflicts in the cloud, which are detected by Cryptomator as conflicts (as introduced with our sync conflict resolver in version 1.1).\nBut we have seen cases that lead to conflicts due to our migration, which we have introduced with version 1.1.1 and been patching with version 1.1.2 and 1.1.3, so I could imagine that your conflicted files may have been caused by the migration.\nCould you elaborate on what the conflicted files look like? Are they just normal files? Or are they 0 bytes files, which were originally folders, or something weird like that?\n. Interesting, that's a new one. Could you please attach the log file?\n. Thank you! I could reproduce the issue. I don't know what the cause is, but I haven't seen anything like this before. Thank you again for your bug report! Need to discuss this with @overheadhunter and @markuskreusch, I have no clue what's happening. We'll keep you posted in this issue when we have more information.\n. Apparently, Dropbox creates ._ files on FAT32-formatted drives for the OS X resource forks (saving Dropbox-specific attributes). That's why Cryptomator's sync conflict resolver is trying to resolve this file, even though it shouldn't. After that conflict resolution, Dropbox creates another ._ file, that's why there is this \"infinite loop of conflict resolution\". We'll fix this with the next update.\n. I saw a com.dropbox.attributes in the ._ file that's why I assumed that Dropbox creates those files, but it's probably that Dropbox makes use of xattr and actually Mac/Finder creates those files. And yeah FAT32-formatted is probably wrong as well, I meant non-HFS+-formatted. Nevertheless, we know that our sync conflict resolver has to ignore the ._ files, which would fix this issue.\n. Thanks, @RiseT! You're correct that an attacker could write his own application (or modify Cryptomator) to remove the delay, if there would be one.\n@8347: Cryptomator actually has a brute-force protection. We're using scrypt (as described in our security architecture) for our key derivation function.\n\nA password-based key derivation function (password-based KDF) is generally designed to be computationally intensive, so that it takes a relatively long time to compute (say on the order of several hundred milliseconds). Legitimate users only need to perform the function once per operation (e.g., authentication), and so the time required is negligible. However, a brute-force attack would likely need to perform the operation billions of times, at which point the time requirements become significant and, ideally, prohibitive.\n\nSource: scrypt on Wikipedia\nThe white paper on scrypt is available here.\n. Might be related to #220? At least with macOS, not sure about Ubuntu. Will be hopefully fixed with FUSE #252.\n. We've recently received a report that using Cryptomator with a CloudMounter drive works fine. Is it possible that this is fixed? Would you be willing to re-test this with up-to-date versions of CloudMounter and Cryptomator, @v4n? :). Sorry, we overlooked this issue. Is this bug still present in the current version?. Okay! Thanks for re-testing. :+1:. I have a feeling that this might be related to a faulty migration. Could you please look inside the log file as @overheadhunter stated? It's located at %appdata%/Cryptomator/cryptomator.log. If you see something like Filename decryption of XXX failed: Authentication failed. or any other error, please let us know. If you're posting the log file here, make sure to redact any sensitive information (e.g. cleartext filenames and paths).\n. Hm, there are no error messages, you're right. Could you describe the structure of the vault? It should look something like this:\n.\n\u251c\u2500 d\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 BZ\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 R4VZSS5PEF7TU3PMFIMON5GJRNBDWA\n\u2502  \u2502     \u251c\u2500 0USJ7VD36K7YU2RARYJMEFTABZOGN6LUH63VRH5MADVOZ433VZ7EPSM2PLJPHTBL6\n\u2502  \u2502     \u251c\u2500 0YWVRCCROEC3ZECD2UTJR7BGYERU3LG6R7QODBGMZ7EQ3BXGY24======\n\u2502  \u2502     \u251c\u2500 ...\n\u2502  \u2502     \u251c\u2500 YWBBP7RC6FFX6ZN4YBLN4WXD6IIBTMKXHFFDQEZNYTQLNZWOGDT22EY=\n\u2502  \u2502     \u2514\u2500 ZTNHMICOWU6ZSNIR72ESLQSGDMLQYQ42XEKGOWSYYX5II===\n\u2502  \u2514\u2500 FC\n\u2502     \u2514\u2500 ZKZRLZUODUUYTYA4457CSBPZXB5A77\n\u2502        \u2514\u2500 ...\n\u251c\u2500 m\n\u2502  \u2514\u2500 ...\n\u251c\u2500 masterkey.cryptomator\n\u2514\u2500 masterkey.cryptomator.bkup\nThe directory d is the one we're interested in. Inside d should only be directories with 2 characters. And a level deeper there should be only directores with 30 characters. Further down there are finally the encrypted files and folders (encrypted folders look like files and have a preceding 0).\nCan you determine anything wrong in the structure of your vault? Maybe something like a (1) due to synchronization conflicts in Google Drive or anything like that.\n. Even though I didn't see the errors I was expecting, you could still try our repair tool for that error ( before doing nothing). How to get it and how to use it is described here: https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/333#issuecomment-243485407\n. .lng is correct and an indication for a file or folder with a long filename, as described here: https://cryptomator.org/architecture/#nameShortening\n. @bernd1026 When you ran 1.1.4 on your second computer, did you make sure that Google Drive was finished with synchronization before migrating the vault?\n. We're currently working on an integrity check: #312\nActually, we can probably send you something for a more detailed diagnosis later today. We're running out of ideas on why your vault is empty. Stay tuned!\n. Thank you for the report! As you can see, there seem to be a lot of problems. So much as it looks like that you're trying to unlock a vault with the wrong key.\nEdit: Btw, you can ignore the warnings about \"LowercasedFile\". They're wrong, the files with \".lng\" are perfectly fine.\nYou mentioned earlier about copying masterkeys, what did you mean exactly? Maybe you got the masterkeys mixed up and now you're trying to open this vault with the wrong masterkey?\nTry to restore an earlier (working) version of your masterkey:\n1. Back up your current masterkey.\n2. Go to Google Drive and locate your vault.\n3. Right-click on your masterkey and select \"Manage versions\u2026\"\n4. Check if there are any older versions of your masterkey and restore it.\nAfter that, Cryptomator might tell you to do a migration, because your old (working) masterkey is still in vault version 3 (current vault version is 4). Please don't try to unlock the vault with an old version of Cryptomator, because the contents of your vault are already migrated. Just confirm the migration and tell us if that worked.\nIt's just a speculation of mine that your masterkey is \"wrong\", but otherwise it's really hard to explain why ~80 directories (probably all directories?) are erroneous.\n. It looks like a faulty migration as @markuskreusch has mentioned, which leads to some filenames missing an equals sign. We have written a simple repair tool to fix this: http://updates.cryptomator.org/repair-vault/AppendMissingEqualsSign.zip\n1. Put both the RepairVault.exe and cygwin1.dll inside your vault (next to masterkey.cryptomator).\n2. Open command prompt (cmd).\n3. Navigate to your vault with: cd C:\\path\\to\\vault\n4. Execute the repair tool with: RepairVault.exe\nThe repair tool will do a dry run first and it's going to find the \"corrupt\" files. After the dry run has completed and you see some results, type \"execute\" to do the actual renaming.\n. @bernd1026 Wrong issue. ;) Yeah, but that's what I've thought. DIdn't see any errors in your log file, that's why I didn't think this would help. More in #331 please.\n. I'm glad it worked! Sorry for the mess, a faulty migration shouldn't have happened in the first place.\nRegarding missing and old files: You could look inside the log file again and check if there are any errors, but it's possible that the cloud software \"just\" got confused.\nBtw, the issue you've fixed now didn't touch any files. It was actually only folder names that were missing an equals sign. And also the migration didn't do anything with the files, it only renamed folders. That's why it's more likely that the cloud software didn't sync properly.\nBut if there are indeed errors in the log file of Cryptomator, let us know!\n. Just wanted to add that Finder Sync (App Extension) could be the way to achieve this on OS X.\nI just don't know what to do with an .appex file (which is the product of the app extension, if you don't embed it to an application directly) and how to integrate it in a Java application. :laughing:\n. A cross-platform solution might be: Allow dragging&dropping a cleartext file onto the Cryptomator UI, which reveals the ciphertext file in return. I don't like this as a \"final\" solution, but maybe it's enough for the beginning?. Out of curiosity, are you using a \"regular\" Mac or some sort of Hackintosh or VM? Okay, VM shouldn't work as documented in another issue, but that's a really weird issue. \ud83d\ude05\n. Oh, cool! Didn't know there was a formula for Cryptomator on Homebrew Cask! :) Hmmm... okay... shouldn't be an issue though... so not sure, what's going on here! :confused:\n. Could you please post the log messages with the error/exception? Just to be sure that your error is exactly the same. Maybe the cause isn't fonts related.. Hm okay, it seems to be the same issue. Honestly, I don't think that we can fix this, because it's an upstream bug in JavaFX, as pointed out in issue #193.\nHave you tried the rather weird workaround by adding \"any\" flag, as suggested in this thread?\nE.g., by using ./Cryptomator --help.\nIf you reset to default fonts, does Cryptomator work for you? Unfortunately, I don't know a way to tell, which fonts cause problems. \ud83d\ude15. Hey guys, we're EXTREMELY SORRY that we're responding just now. We're currently trying to reproduce the issue and checking right now if the issue can be detected (and solved) by our sanitizer.\n. Quick update: We have to update our sanitizer in order to detect the faulty file(s). We were able to reproduce this exception by adding a file with a valid Base32 name but invalid content into the data directory. Hopefully we'll have a solution for you by tomorrow!\nEdit: We ran into some trouble, we'll try and figure something out on the weekend. \ud83d\ude15\n. Oh, the output is identical. I've checked your log file again and we missed that you have a different error than OP.\nUncaught exception\norg.cryptomator.cryptolib.api.AuthenticationFailedException: Header MAC doesn't match.\nvs.\nUncaught exception\norg.cryptomator.cryptolib.api.AuthenticationFailedException: Authentication of chunk 7 failed.\nI'm actually very surprised that this could happen. I mean that's the whole point of Cryptomator's integrity checks, but still... very surprising... because this suggests that the file has been tampered with.\nOkay, we need to update the sanitizer again and also check the authenticity of the file contents.\nFyi, ERROR SizeMismatch is expected and can be ignored in your particular case. Generally it would be an unexpected error for vault version 4. But these are 0 bytes files that already have been migrated and are therefore legitimate for vault version 5.\nWARN  MissingDirectory is a little puzzling. We have to think about scenarios, in which this warning might occur. But we'll wait with an analysis, because these might be connected to the corrupted file(s) (with the unauthentic file contents).\nINFO  OrphanMFile can be ignored, because orphan metadata files won't cause any errors or problems. We could eventually implement a clean up process in Cryptomator, but that's a feature for another time.\n. We tried to reproduce your issue, because we thought that maybe there was something magic about the 244217 bytes, in which the last chunk failed to be authenticated (or actually decrypted in this case), but we weren't successful.\nCould you look at this file in your vault d/EI/N7IEZWZWH4VEGRP2HNJW3ENBX5CVMG/A5TGOLLJDCUIBBPKNKZVJQOKBAWDXWD3KB3MXWA4AHASY=== and check (by looking at the properties) what size this file exactly is? I'd expect something greater than 244217 bytes because of the former file size obfuscation. But this number may help us detect if there is indeed something magic about it. This could be an edge case, which we would have to fix, or your file really is just corrupt (for whatever reason).\n. Okay, all my attempts to reproduce the issue failed. Maybe it's some relic of older versions (even though I can't think of any) or something else I can't think of right now (except bit rotting and file manipulation in general).\nWe've updated Sanitizer once again to version 0.4 (download here) and added a deep mode, which also checks file contents for integrity.\nYou can run it by adding the --deep option. It may take longer for a 130 GB vault, so you may have to be patient.\n. Hmmm... I couldn't reproduce the issue yet. Just recently updated to Sierra. Unlocked 8 vaults and it didn't crash. I'm not convinced yet that it has something to do with our native code, even though it's one of the things that's new to version 1.2.0. Not sure how to debug this. \ud83e\udd14\n. Oh, your last crash log is actually really interesting (and different than before). It looks like a JavaFX error (upstream bug?), which is caused when we're calling SecPasswordField.swipe(). But still very strange because we're using Java 8u102 in both 1.1.4 and 1.2.0.\nUnfortunately, I can't find anything on this particular error. Even though it's a weird question: I know you did a fresh install and tried multiple systems, but is there anything about your system (hardware and/or software) that's out of the ordinary that you can think of?\n. Unfortunately, VM is a whole other story and is currently unsupported, as discussed in #93.\n. Of course! Thanks for the detailed bug report. :+1: I know you've mentioned that 1.1.4 ran with no issues, but have you actually downloaded it again and tried it out on Sierra (after all the crashes with 1.2.0)? You can download 1.1.4 at https://cryptomator.org/downloads/#allVersions.\nI just want to make sure, because if it really is a JavaFX bug, it should also crash with 1.1.4, because the same JVM is bundled. But yeah, it's almost desperate now, I'm really out of ideas. If someone else has the same issue, any help is appreciated!\n. We've received the same bug report by another user.\n@overheadhunter: I've looked into the history and this code at https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/commit/ce12af84955073597fe8639c6f19df9820c22e06#diff-d78da9078d4508c83a5c37a6d0ea49eaR304 has been added, which is causing the crash. Maybe it has to be called from the main thread, because it's currently called from an AsyncTaskService?\nJust a reminder, this is the stack trace:\nException Name: JavaNativeException\nDescription: java.lang.StackOverflowError\n    at com.sun.glass.ui.mac.MacAccessible.NSAccessibilityPostNotification(Native Method)\n    at com.sun.glass.ui.mac.MacAccessible.sendNotification(MacAccessible.java:803)\n    at javafx.scene.Node.notifyAccessibleAttributeChanged(Node.java:9604)\n    at javafx.scene.control.TextInputControl.doSelectRange(TextInputControl.java:1035)\n    at javafx.scene.control.TextInputControl.replaceText(TextInputControl.java:1209)\n    at javafx.scene.control.TextInputControl.filterAndSet(TextInputControl.java:1171)\n    at javafx.scene.control.TextInputControl.access$900(TextInputControl.java:79)\n    at javafx.scene.control.TextInputControl$TextProperty.doSet(TextInputControl.java:1410)\n    at javafx.scene.control.TextInputControl$TextProperty.set(TextInputControl.java:1323)\n    at javafx.scene.control.TextInputControl.setText(TextInputControl.java:349)\n    at javafx.scene.control.TextInputControl.clear(TextInputControl.java:1064)\n    at org.cryptomator.ui.controls.SecPasswordField.swipe(SecPasswordField.java:41)\n    at org.cryptomator.ui.controllers.UnlockController.unlock(UnlockController.java:304)\n    at org.cryptomator.ui.controllers.UnlockController.lambda$didClickUnlockButton$0(UnlockController.java:290)\n    at org.cryptomator.ui.util.AsyncTaskService.lambda$asyncTaskOf$0(AsyncTaskService.java:32)\n    at org.cryptomator.ui.util.AsyncTaskService$AsyncTaskImpl.lambda$null$6(AsyncTaskService.java:89)\n    at org.cryptomator.ui.util.AsyncTaskService.logExceptions(AsyncTaskService.java:118)\n    at org.cryptomator.ui.util.AsyncTaskService.access$100(AsyncTaskService.java:19)\n    at org.cryptomator.ui.util.AsyncTaskService$AsyncTaskImpl.lambda$run$7(AsyncTaskService.java:87)\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1142)\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:617)\n    at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)\n. @submarine89 We're about to release 1.2.1, which hopefully fixes the error you're experiencing. As we're unable to reproduce the issue, it would be great, if you could try the new version out. It's not yet available on our website, but you can download it here.\n. Received another confirmation via e-mail. Looking good! \ud83d\udc4d\n. I'm not sure if your issue @ewirch is the same as OP's. In my experience, Google Drive tends to create sync conflict files more often than other cloud storage services.\nE.g. if you have two devices that are syncing locally, you occasionally get conflicted files, even though you aren't actively working on them. The Google Drive sync app is just that bad.\nLet's say we have an unencrypted file called my document.txt, Google Drive renames it to my document (1).txt for whatever reasons. It's beyond my imagination why this would happen.\nWhen we have encrypted files it's more like H6ZNNO...FXG=== becoming H6ZNNO...FXG=== (1). That's when Cryptomator's sync conflict detection comes in. In a naive approach, we wouldn't be able to decrypt this filename due to the extra (1). But with the conflict detection, it's passed through transparently and shown as (Conflict xxxxxxxx) in cleartext so that you can decide what to do with this conflicted file.\nHope that makes it clear.\nEdit: Basically, it's no problem at all to just rename the (Conflict xxxxxxxx) file back to normal without any harm. In case you have both the original file and the conflicted file, you'll have to decide for yourself what to do with them, because they might have different contents (due to working on the same file simultaneously on different devices).. Just thought about the original issue, why ODrive doesn't work with Cryptomator. I can remember seeing @BonnChris using ODrive in a screen sharing session. ODrive creates placeholder files ending with a .cloud file extension (and .cloudf for placeholder folders).\nSame principle here: H6ZNNO...FXG=== becomes H6ZNNO...FXG===.cloud. Cryptomator's sync conflict detection thinks that this is a conflicted file and tries to resolve the conflict. Classic false positive. :joy:. All ODrive files are .cloud at first. These are just placeholder files, associated with ODrive, so that the actual file gets downloaded if you double-click on it. So yes, it only affects the desktop application. After the download is finished, the .cloud file extension will be deleted and then opened. In summary: Double-click on a .cloud file leads to download -> rename -> open.. That's actually really puzzling. We have described this error in our FAQ: https://cryptomator.freshdesk.com/solution/articles/16000022465\nNever heard of a case before that it could take weeks. If I understood you correctly, you can use Cryptomator between two(!) iOS devices? In my understanding this automatically means that it has been successfully synced with iCloud. It doesn't make any sense otherwise. I'm unable to comprehend why it's not showing up on icloud.com or on your Mac, even if it's working between two iOS devices.\nI've been investigating this issue for a very long time (unfortunately I could never reproduce it) and we've done everything according to Apple's documentation. I don't know what else we can do and I also don't believe that this is unique to Cryptomator. If you google iCloud Drive issues in general or of other apps, you'll find all sorts of articles, threads, etc.\nCan you try to delete the Cryptomator folder with the iCloud Drive app from a working iOS device? And then open up Cryptomator again, navigating to iCloud Drive so that the folder is being created again.\n. Yeah, the error is expected, because you've deleted the vault from the outside and Cryptomator is trying to access the old path. Hm okay, I'll do another round of research, but chances are slim that I'll find anything new.\nRecently we've been starting to use native functions. Maybe we can change something in our Mac app so that it supports the Cryptomator iCloud container. Will have to investigate this further, just a quick idea for now.\n. Okay, I was about to give you some more information, but thanks for trying. I'll post it here anyway for future reference. Here it goes:\nThanks for contacting Apple! We've also contacted Apple some months ago (and opened a Technical Support Incident) without any conclusion. They just told me to activate iCloud Drive Logging, even though I've stated that I'm unable to reproduce the issue.\n\nPlease collect iCloud Drive logs for iOS and OS X and attach them to your bug report.\niOS iCloud Drive Logging Instructions:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/services-account/download?path=/iOS/iOS_Logs/iCloud_Drive_Logging_Instructions.pdf\niCloud Drive Logging Profile:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/services-account/download?path=/iOS/iOS_Logs/iCloudDrive.mobileconfig\n\u2014\nOS X iCloud Drive Logging Instructions:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/services-account/download?path=/OS_X/OS_X_Logs/iCloud_Drive_Logging_Instructions.pdf\niCloud Drive Logging Profile:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/services-account/download?path=/OS_X/OS_X_Logs/iCloudDrive.mobileconfig\n\nThis is nothing I can expect from any user, because it's time-consuming and normally a developer's task. But that's how we reached a dead-end.\nWe've followed these guides to integrate iCloud Drive:\n- iCloud Fundamentals (Key-Value and Document Storage): https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/iCloudDesignGuide/Chapters/iCloudFundametals.html\n- The Role of File Coordinators and Presenters: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemProgrammingGuide/FileCoordinators/FileCoordinators.html\n- Managing the Life Cycle of a Document : https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/DataManagement/Conceptual/DocumentBasedAppPGiOS/ManageDocumentLifeCycle/ManageDocumentLifeCycle.html\nIn our opinion, everything is properly set up, for example NSUbiquitousContainerIsDocumentScopePublic is set to YES and such. We're also putting a PDF inside the iCloud container (the readme file), in order to have something to sync instantly. It's also stated here: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/qa/qa1893/_index.html\n\nTry to copy at least one file to your iCloud container if it doesn't show up as expected.\n\nIf you need more technical information on this, I can provide them without hesitation. I just don't know if it's going to lead anywhere, because this issue seems to be rare (but occurs often enough to be significant). I would be happy to fix it, if I know what the issue is, but I still believe that it's an iCloud issue.\n. All right, closing this for now. If we have any new leads, we can reopen this issue.\n. I just want to clear this out: The vast majority of our users don't have any issues and it works perfectly for iOS and(!) Mac/iCloud.com. So it's more like an anomaly that it doesn't work.\nYou can send the information to support@cryptomator.org and I'll have a look at it. Thanks!\n. Another idea, because this is really bothering me: Basically my goal is to trigger iCloud to do SOMETHING. As we've already found out, iCloud sync is technically working (because you're able to use multiple iOS devices). So the \"only\" part that is not working in some cases (for unknown reasons) is that the iCloud container \"opens up\" and being available on non-iOS devices (and even the web).\nOkay here the idea: Maybe it's not enough to have the readme.pdf and a bunch of folders (the vaults) with files inside the iCloud container. Could you try to put more files inside the Cryptomator iCloud container (in its root level) on your iOS device? E.g. take some random picture from any app and use the \"Add To iCloud Drive\" functionality.\nEdit: Basically put files inside the Cryptomator iCloud container without using Cryptomator itself. \ud83d\ude09\n. Ah I actually meant without(!) using the Cryptomator app at all. Just save the files you've tested inside the Cryptomator iCloud container. See below in the screenshot using \"Add To iCloud Drive\". I know that the files are then unencrypted in iCloud Drive. But I wanted to know if this might trigger something with iCloud. I know it's a long shot.\n\n. To anyone stumbling upon this issue just now or still having this issue: We're currently testing the upcoming Cryptomator version 1.3.0 for macOS. We made a slight change in the application so that it recognizes the Cryptomator directory in iCloud Drive. Please download Cryptomator 1.3.0 RC 3 and see if the Cryptomator directory becomes visible in iCloud Drive. We don't actually know if this really solves this issue so we're happy to hear your feedback!\nEdit: Anyone interested in the technical details: We've actually just added the same entry from the iOS app to Info.plist, see changes in cryptomator-osx/Info.plist, lines 54-65. Maybe that's already enough to trigger something in macOS. Interestingly enough, it changed the folder icon in my iCloud Drive so it did \"something\". Maybe it does more and also triggers the visibility.. Do you have the same error on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2012?\nDecryption failed for technical reasons.\norg.cryptomator.frontend.FrontendCreationFailedException: java.io.UncheckedIOException: java.nio.file.AccessDeniedException\nI'm not that familiar with rights management on Windows, but is it possible that you're logged in with a user that doesn't have the sufficient privileges to read from the folder you're trying to open?\n. All right! :+1: Glad I could help!\n. Thanks for reporting! I've actually seen that while skyping (and screen sharing) with a friend, who had a lot of applications open (multiple IDEs, VM, etc.). Not sure if this is something new to Sierra, i.e. Finder is more likely to time out. I'm not sure what we can actually do about it other than switching to the long-awaited FUSE integration #252.\n. Not an exact ETA, but hopefully by the end of this year.\n. That ETA was too optimistic. We haven't even released 1.3 yet, which will include major changes under the hood first. Most of the code has been completely rewritten and modularized (into CryptoLib, CryptoFS, and WebDAV NIO Adapter). After that, we can actually start with the FUSE integration, which is scheduled for version 1.4. I don't dare to give ETAs anymore. \ud83d\ude05. Thank you for your suggestion! My only consideration is: Does this work cross-platform? Especially on mobile devices. If it doesn't, how do we make sure that it works across all platforms? Could be related to #290.\n. I've never seen this error before. My first thought is: Is this related to \"App Transport Security (ATS)\" that Apple is introducing right now? Basically, forbidding http and enforcing https. But I'm also running Sierra and I don't have this error.\nAnd it's quite unlikely, because I can't find anything about this error. Just found a thread that smb is not working, because it doesn't work combined with the software ADmitMac, but that's about it.\nDo you have anything installed that might block internet connections? Something like a firewall or anything that could interfere with http?\n. FileVault is no problem, I'm using it as well. Could you try to mount a WebDAV drive from http://ajaxbrowser.com/? It's a handy server to test a WebDAV client.\nPress Cmd+K in Finder (or in the menu \"Go -> Connect to Server...\") and enter the URL that is generated for you at AJAX File Browser. Just proceed as a guest and you should see the test files generated by them. Or in your case you'd see the same error, that's what I'd like to find out.\nJust to make sure that it's generally an issue with http or not. After that you can also try https://ajaxbrowser.com/ (https instead of http) and try the same. Would be interesting to know if that's working.\n. Interesting. Thank you for your follow-up! Always good to have more information. :smile:\ud83d\udc4d . Would be interesting to know if this problem also occurs with an older version of Cryptomator (e.g. 1.1.4). Just to pinpoint if this really is an upstream bug or we messed something up.\n. It's the first time that we had to migrate/edit all files, because we updated our encryption scheme to vault version 5. Every file header had to be updated and the random padding had to be cut off.\nUnfortunately, the modification dates were affected by this, because we don't have any control of the synchronization clients. We could've run into unexpected behavior, if we would've changed back the modification date manually.\nHowever, your observation on the creation date sounds strange. I've got the feeling that it's another \"display error\" of the WebDAV client that comes with Windows Explorer, but I'm just speculating here. The creation dates are untouched on macOS, so it's nothing that Cryptomator deliberately changes.\nWhile I understand the issue, I'm not sure that there is anything that we can do about the modification dates. \ud83d\ude15\n. Correct! That's also how we described it on our front page:\n\nThe only thing which cannot be encrypted without breaking your cloud synchronization is the modification date of your files.\n\nEdit: Oh, and I just found an error while looking at the website. File sizes are not obfuscated anymore. \ud83d\ude05\n. This could've worked. I'm not so familiar with the little details on Windows, but on macOS this wouldn't have worked because of #220. But yes, if the WebDAV client of Windows Explorer is able to preserve the original modification dates, your suggestion would've worked.\n. Yes, you can use the JAR file, if you'd prefer that (btw, older installers are available here).\nHowever, you'd have to install Java 8 + JCE (needed for 256-bit keys). Not sure if this is something that you'd like to install on your machine. You can download these at\n- http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html\n- http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html\nInstall the JCE files following the description in the README.txt file inside the downloaded zip archive. After that you can run Cryptomator using\njava -jar Cryptomator-1.1.4.jar\n. Yeah, it's an open issue at #223 with a low priority. \ud83d\ude05\n. Yes, this is what we're trying to achieve with Dokany #207. Our goal is to replace the WebDAV frontend in the near future. I'll mark this as duplicate.\n. ~~In the Cryptomator installers/binaries we already bundle the JVM. If you'd prefer to use the system JVM,~~ you also have to install JCE for the 256-bit keys. This is only needed for Oracle JVM. OpenJDK doesn't have this restriction. You can download JCE from here.\nEdit: I guess, I have no clue about our Linux distribution. :laughing:\n. Thank you for your suggestion. Stating that \"GCM is better anyway\" is simply false and currently there is no reason for switching to GCM. And regarding your initial suggestion, @overheadhunter explained that we're only using symmetric keys.\nAllowing and offering different cipher methods may be added in the future, but is not considered at this time, because we still want to keep Cryptomator as simple as possible.\n. @aethera1 Another user reported the same issue via email and he tried deactivating his firewall without success. Could you tell me which additional firewall you're using? Maybe it's something about the specific software, maybe not, I'm just not sure what to tell him next. :wink: It's probably also for others interesting to know, which software could cause issues with Cryptomator in the default(?) or specific settings.\n. This looks related to #374. Have you tried the solution there?\n. Wait, wait. Isn't this expected behavior? Unchecking the checkbox shouldn't immediately forget the saved password. If it doesn't work after unlocking the vault (which is the confirmation that the password should be forgotten), then it's a bug.\nReason: Checking the checkbox is also not immediately remembering the password. Only happens after unlocking the vault. It's a weird behavior if I uncheck/check the checkbox and the password is \"lost\".\n. That's just the confusing thing about this particular checkbox. We can't save the password, if the user hasn't unlocked the vault. I see that unchecking the checkbox might be confusing, even though it's currently a consistent behavior (you still need the \"unlock\" confirmation as for saving the password). Making it inconsistent isn't a good idea, I wouldn't just forget the password by unchecking.\nSuggestion\n\nInitial state: Show a checkbox as before. If you check the checkbox and successfully unlock the vault, change to \"save password state\".\nSaved password state: Show a button with \"Forget saved password\". If you press the button, it'll change to \"initial state\" and show a checkbox.\n\nButtons for actions. Checkboxes for preparing an action (or a two-sided/reversible action, that's fine in some cases, too, but doesn't work here). But just don't make a one-sided action out of a checkbox. :grin:\n. Sounds better. \ud83d\udc4d\n. We postponed this to version 1.2.3, because 1.2.2 had to be released quickly due to a blocker on Linux. We currently don't have an ETA for version 1.2.3.. I like the padlock icon. :wink: We could do it equally to our mobile apps.\n- Locked: No icon\n- Unlocked: Padlock icon on the right\nEdit: Oh, and regarding your issue. I think I've experienced something similar. Also not quite sure how to reproduce it consistently.\n. Oh, haha. Of course it's an open padlock. But you should've known, it's the same as in iOS.\n. Hmmm... this issue seems to come up more and more often, I wonder why. \ud83e\udd14\nHave you tried the solution from #374?\n. Is there any information (e.g. a detailed error or exception) in the log file?\n. fixed in commit a583afe. Okay, this is really weird. There isn't any information here. If you find the time to upgrade, please check the other log file at ~/.Cryptomator/cryptomator.log. Maybe there is some error that isn't logged in upgrade.log.\n. Oh shit. I think we broke the upgrade process with 1.2.1, we're going to release a hotfix soon!\nThis is the error I'm getting:\n2016-11-12 16:08:27,090 ERROR [AsyncTaskService:127] Uncaught exception\njava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/cryptomator/siv/UnauthenticCiphertextException\n    at org.cryptomator.cryptolib.v1.CryptorImpl.<init>(CryptorImpl.java:51) ~[cryptolib-1.0.7.jar:?]\n    at org.cryptomator.cryptolib.v1.CryptorProviderImpl.createFromKeyFile(CryptorProviderImpl.java:87) ~[cryptolib-1.0.7.jar:?]\n    at org.cryptomator.cryptolib.v1.CryptorProviderImpl.createFromKeyFile(CryptorProviderImpl.java:66) ~[cryptolib-1.0.7.jar:?]\n    at org.cryptomator.cryptolib.v1.CryptorProviderImpl.createFromKeyFile(CryptorProviderImpl.java:35) ~[cryptolib-1.0.7.jar:?]\n    at org.cryptomator.ui.model.UpgradeStrategy.upgrade(UpgradeStrategy.java:49) ~[Cryptomator-1.2.1.jar:1.2.1]\n    at org.cryptomator.ui.controllers.UpgradeController.lambda$upgrade$1(UpgradeController.java:111) ~[Cryptomator-1.2.1.jar:1.2.1]\n    at org.cryptomator.ui.util.AsyncTaskService.lambda$asyncTaskOf$0(AsyncTaskService.java:32) ~[Cryptomator-1.2.1.jar:1.2.1]\n    at org.cryptomator.ui.util.AsyncTaskService$AsyncTaskImpl.lambda$null$6(AsyncTaskService.java:89) ~[Cryptomator-1.2.1.jar:1.2.1]\n    at org.cryptomator.ui.util.AsyncTaskService.logExceptions(AsyncTaskService.java:118) ~[Cryptomator-1.2.1.jar:1.2.1]\n    at org.cryptomator.ui.util.AsyncTaskService.access$100(AsyncTaskService.java:19) ~[Cryptomator-1.2.1.jar:1.2.1]\n    at org.cryptomator.ui.util.AsyncTaskService$AsyncTaskImpl.lambda$run$7(AsyncTaskService.java:87) ~[Cryptomator-1.2.1.jar:1.2.1]\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1142) ~[?:1.8.0_112]\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:617) ~[?:1.8.0_112]\n    at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745) ~[?:1.8.0_112]\nCaused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.cryptomator.siv.UnauthenticCiphertextException\n    at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:381) ~[?:1.8.0_112]\n    at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:424) ~[?:1.8.0_112]\n    at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:331) ~[?:1.8.0_112]\n    at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:357) ~[?:1.8.0_112]\n    ... 14 more\n. The error indicates that something might be wrong with the JSON parser inside CryptoLib. Have you changed something inside the masterkey.cryptomator file?\nPlease create a backup of this file first. There should also be a masterkey.cryptomator.bkup file inside your vault (it's always created after a successful unlock). Could you remove the .bkup extension and try this masterkey instead of the current one?. Oh wait, you said that newly created vaults don't work either? Could you please create a new vault and post the contents of masterkey.cryptomator here? Did we change the JSON parser from 1.2.0 to 1.2.2 @overheadhunter?. You're right. :) We'll do that with #223.. This issue was moved to cryptomator/cryptomator-ios#67. That doesn't seem plausible. The iOS app doesn't recursively look inside folders. If it's doing the directory listing for Folder3, it's only doing that and completely ignoring subfolders. Edit: Okay, for your example I should've written \"directory listing for Vault (root folder)\", but it applies to all folders. :wink:\nBtw, the SizeMismatch error isn't correct, 88 bytes is a valid size. It was (or is?) a bug of the Sanitizer.\nWhat cloud storage service are you using? Are you sure that your synchronization client is finished with synchronization? Maybe Folder3 hasn't been properly synced yet. Try to restart your sync client, maybe it got stuck somewhere.. Thanks for reporting! Duplicate of #295.. I just did some quick googling. I'm not exactly sure, what that error means and why the mounting of the WebDAV drive isn't working.\nBut in one search result it was mentioned that this error might appear if you don't have the following package installed:\nsudo apt-get install gvfs-fuse\nMaybe it's worth a try?. Okay, it was a long shot anyway. \ud83d\ude05 Will have to ask @overheadhunter or @markuskreusch if they have any ideas.. It has to be two different states then. :wink: As soon as the password field is changed while in \"saved password\" state, immediately switch to \"normal\" state and swipe password field.. Hi there! Unfortunately, that's not possible. We've decided against it very early on in the development of Cryptomator: #21 \nDoesn't mean that this is a final decision. :wink: There may be plans to add this in the future, but that's more in the \">= months\" spectrum here.. This issue was moved to cryptomator/cryptomator-win#3. We actually have GPG signatures of our apps. They can be found on Bintray.\nE.g.\nhttps://bintray.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/cryptomator-osx/1.2.3#files\nhttps://bintray.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/cryptomator-win/1.2.3#files\nI guess, we could make them more visible on our website. :wink: Added a GitHub issue: https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator.github.io/issues/16\nYou're right, I actually know that you can sign git commits. :smile: And it's even reeeaaally easy to set up using SourceTree. But don't ask me why I haven't set it up yet. \ud83d\ude05. Thank you for your suggestion! You've nailed it. I'm totally with you on this one, but it's a duplicate of #336. :grin:. Just wanted to add that this issue doesn't only include the option to start in hidden mode but also that Cryptomator can be automatically started on startup.. From what I've gathered by now (by asking people and reading feedback), GNOME Keyring is indeed a good start.. We've seen an amazing initiative by @swiesend (see: https://community.cryptomator.org/t/feature-request-automatic-login-for-linux/2970) and his library already looks very promising. Not sure if @swiesend would like to share something on the current state but if everything turns out as expected, we'd be glad to integrate his library into Cryptomator.. I can imagine what happens here. Actually, we're already using the volume identifier provided by AppleScript: MacOsXAppleScriptWebDavMounter.java#L78\nIn the past we used MacOsXShellScriptWebDavMounter.java#L71, which is still active for OS X 10.9 or below due to Finder freezes (#211).\nWe changed from shell script to AppleScript due to issue #97. Both have their own advantages and disadvantages as it seems. I don't think that we can solve this while using WebDAV as a frontend.\nAnother issue that would be fixed with FUSE (#252). \ud83d\ude05. Opened an issue at our iOS issues repository: https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-ios/issues/71\nUnfortunately, we won't be able to support sync.com!. One of the things I immediately see: You're missing JCE, which is required for using 256-bit keys with Oracle JRE. You can install it with apt-get install oracle-java8-unlimited-jce-policy. Does this fix your issue?. I'm glad it's working now! Our error handling isn't showing a user-friendly message yet. It's going to be fixed with #223. The deciding message was java.security.InvalidKeyException: Illegal key size or default parameters.. I'm not really a pro with Linux, but some users reported issues regarding mounting with davfs. You have to add -o uid=username (username is your username on your Linux system). Maybe I'm wrong and it has nothing to do with it. But it might be worth a try, if you haven't already done that?. It looks like Cryptomator is trying to upgrade the contents of .DAV folders that apparently have .dir and .pag files. Sanitizer is probably smart enough to skip them, that's why it's not finding any errors.\nI don't know the significance of the .DAV folders. Maybe they can just be deleted, but I assume these folders are all over the place. Where is the cloud storage service located and how are you connected to it? I've actually never seen this before.\nWe have to look over our upgrade routine again and ignore these folders in a future update.. Okay, I'm not sure either. We'll fix that with the next version. Unfortunately, I don't know how long it will take us to release it. Luckily, your vault hasn't been migrated yet. Well, except for one file: \\d\\32\\DSIHQSZ44OCM7LOUYZNJJV6XSJYH2G\\7EY55UHFP5XDIRMWEEERLCU5UJ77JNQPTIS2PZB4WNYBYQB3QRONKRROJJQ3UTHRMAY4PK7FKST4NSPSJHF7QJY=\nI'm not exactly sure, but MagentaCloud should have a \"restore\" function. You could try it with the MagentaCloud software, but if it doesn't have any restore function, check out their web portal. After restoring that file, your vault should be in the \"old state\". Continue using 1.1.4 until we've released an update. You can download old versions from https://cryptomator.org/downloads/#allVersions. Thank you for your feature request. I know what you mean! Duplicate of https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-ios/issues/13\nEdit: Linked wrong repo, oops.. Sorry wrong repository. I meant https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-ios/issues/13. Thank you for your feature request! Duplicate of #252 (or at least related to). Time Machine is an interesting use case, we'll keep that in mind.. But FUSE is local. Is it not?. Okay but you might be right in the sense that Time Machine needs an HFS drive. Then it's indeed not a duplicate. But it's still an issue that we can't solve, because we can't just provide an HFS drive. At least not to my knowledge.\nEdit: Just found this workaround. http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/turn-nas-windows-share-time-machine-backup/ It might work, but it's an awful idea. I don't think Cryptomator is made for using Time Machine. You might want to use other backup softwares like rsync. Even though I'm not completely sure if rsync is fully compatible with Cryptomator yet (due to WebDAV), but that's what FUSE will hopefully solve.. Another useful information on the \"mount as local\" topic: https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/wiki/Mount-options#local\n\nDon't be too tempted and think local is a magic pill that will solve all your problems. In fact, it may mess things up more than you realize.\n\nWe'll keep this in mind for our FUSE integration.. Hi there, thanks for asking! Before I just say \"it's currently not planned\" and close this issue :sweat_smile: I'd like to elaborate on these two possibilities:\n\nNo connection to cloud storage services at all\nDirect connection to cloud storage services\n\nWithout connection to the cloud\nThis one is pretty obvious and the current state of Cryptomator. Encryption and synchronization are completely decoupled. Cryptomator's only task is encryption and does it with \"cloud storage\" in mind, i.e. the encryption scheme is designed around storing files in a cloud via filesystem-level encryption (in contrast to disk encryption).\nPro: You can use Cryptomator \"anywhere\" and actually isn't restricted to a specific cloud storage. Even though it's advised to use it primarily for this case. There are certainly other tools more suitable for other types of encryption, e.g. Veracrypt for disk encryption.\nCon: You're dependent on synchronization tools by the cloud storage providers or network shares. This can feel restrictive, especially with the uprising of SSDs (just a matter of time until we're \"back to normal\" with TBs of storage), or even slow on network shares.\nAs you can see, it's a trade-off. Both sides have restrictions in their own way. Our decision making was: Most people already have synchronization clients installed and can use Cryptomator on top instantly. We're aware that this doesn't fit everyone's needs, but I guess you have to start somewhere. :wink:\nWith connection to the cloud\nThis one has some more nuances:\n\nContent is loaded on-demand via self-made file browser.\nContent is loaded on-demand via volume mounted in the operating system.\nContent is completely synced to a local folder.\n\nThere might be some more variations I'm forgetting right now. But these are the main ones in my opinion. Off-topic: Cryptomator for iOS and Android are actually implemented like number 1. :grin:\nWe haven't announced it yet on our website, but something reaaaally cool is happening at the moment. We're cooperating with the team of Cyberduck and they're going to integrate Cryptomator into Cyberduck and Mountain Duck. Soon, number 1 (Cyberduck) and 2 (Mountain Duck) will be possible. Actually, there is already a 6.0 beta version of Cyberduck, which you can try out.\nIf I take your suggestion (or headline) literally, number 3 is still \"open\". It would be a huuuge effort to accomplish this and there comes my answer: \"it's not currently planned\". :blush:. While I can't make a statement to the webkitgtk2 dependency and its significancy, I'd still like to answer your other question.\nCurrently, we don't have plans to create Cryptomator in another programming language. But we do plan to improve the frontend (i.e. virtual drive / volume mounting) by using FUSE #252 and Dokany #207 in the future.. I understand your points on Java. Even though I don't agree on the security aspect of it, see our support article. But from a \"user experience\" standpoint, it's understandable.\nIf you have questions regarding the security architecture or specific implementations, don't hesitate to ask. But let's probably keep it out of this GitHub issue. I'd suggest using Gitter or contact us via email.. Forgot about that. \u2639\ufe0f. Closing this issue, will be fixed in https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-linux/issues/6. There shouldn't be a (negative) side effect. Currently, the installer just adds the webclient value  to the ProviderOrder list if it's missing. Nothing is being deleted, so it's not a \"destructive\" operation. I would suggest to do the same here.\nI don't know why the registry entry is reset after every restart. Maybe it's not even a third-party program. Maybe it's some mechanism of Windows, resetting its registry to a snapshot after startup. Could be anything.. Ah, I thought the registry we're modifying in the application also needs admin access, but is silently omitted if the user isn't an admin. Okay, it's not that kind of magic then. Oh well, never mind. :wink:. Edit: Forgot to add links.\nOriginal post by @tobihagemann on Jan 25th at 00:30:18 CET\nHi there, thanks for asking!

These should be the ones in question that you should increase:\n\nCryptoFileSystemIntegrationTest.java#L55\nCryptoFileSystemIntegrationTest.java#L152. Regarding your last question: The WebDAV drive is not publicly available. Requests outside of localhost are rejected. Recently, there was a valid concern, because it's done on the application-level for compatibility reasons (#431). I don't think it's necessary to set up your Firewall for Cryptomator, but you can do so until we've fixed the aforementioned issue.. I was able to reproduce the issue.\n\nEntering 123^1 the first time works, but from then on something weird happens when entering ^1. It adds 3(!) characters. So I've replaced SecPasswordField with TextField to see what's going on. Apparently, when entering ^1 it appears as ^^1 in the text field.\nThe workaround is to use the space bar in-between: Enter ^, press space bar, and then enter 1. This will produce the expected ^1.\nCould be a JavaFX upstream bug?. Yes, I agree @markuskreusch. New issue for the \"reveal password\" enhancement would be great. I'm not so sure about a workaround for input controls, because there is a lot that you could do wrong. There are so many languages, special characters, and different input controls. At least I don't know what a workaround might look like.. Thank you for your bug report! :+1: It was briefly mentioned here: https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/170#issuecomment-269724519\nMy impression is that it's a Sierra bug and has nothing to do with Cryptomator per se. I'm able to reproduce the issue with \"any\" localhost WebDAV server.\nUnfortunately, I'm out of ideas on how to troubleshoot/resolve this. \u2639\ufe0f  Of course, our long-term goal is to switch to FUSE #252, but I also hoped that there would be some fix/workaround.. For anyone interested in the details: We're using AppleScript to mount the volume, see MacOsXAppleScriptWebDavMounter.java#L53.\nDue to the whole refactoring, it's now in webdav-nio-adapter/MacAppleScriptMounter.java#L35, but it's still the same script. Theoretically, we also have a shell script mounter, see webdav-nio-adapter/MacShellScriptMounter.java#L54.\nAs far as I remember, we have to use AppleScript for OS X >=10.10 because of permission issues. You can't do mkdir in /Volumes anymore.. I've let someone check if this issue still persists on macOS 10.13 High Sierra. He didn't see any duplicate folders in /Volumes. I'll wait for more feedback but hopefully this bug is going to be resolved then.. Thank you for your feature request!\n@overheadhunter Should we move this to cryptomator/cryptomator-win?. Some history to give this some context: Until now, Cryptomator only created the masterkey.cryptomator file, when creating a new vault. The encrypted root folder is automatically created, when it doesn't exist during vault unlock.\nThis is true for the current desktop release and for the current iOS version.\nThis is not true for the current Android beta and, as @overheadhunter already mentioned, for the current version of CryptoFS (thus, current 1.3.0-SNAPSHOT).\nLet's put the past aside: What is the definition of a \"valid vault\" that we would like to have across all platforms?\n\nDo we want to have the flexibility of moving the masterkey file around and still be able to use the vault?\nDo we want to \"glue\" the masterkey file to the encrypted root folder and make the vault unusable when the root folder is missing?\n\nI think it's worth to give up the \"flexibility\" (and go for option 2), because we would prevent race conditions when creating the root folder. E.g., desktop version creates a vault and you could unlock the vault simultaneously on multiple devices: Each device might try to create the same root folder and create sync conflicts.\nIn case of option 2, we should throw a human-readable error if the root folder is missing (and the masterkey file exists). Not only during vault unlock, but also during vault migration.\nWhatever we decide, we have to make sure to describe that in our security architecture and implement this in the same way across all platforms.. Thank you for your feature request!\nIf you unlock a vault, you can already close the window and Cryptomator goes into \"background mode\". It even disappears from the Dock and is only accessible via menu bar icon.\nAdding vaults to menu bar is described in #225.. This reminds me of https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/283#issuecomment-257245742. There should be a system tray icon, so that you can quit the application. But it looks like that it doesn't show up on certain Linux distributions.\nIf you lock all vaults and then close the window, Cryptomator should quit. Only if at least one vault is active, it won't quit.. Interesting. \ud83e\udd14 I thought that the close button was visible on any operating system.\n@cryptomator/collaborators I guess, we can't do much about the close button since it's most likely a JavaFX upstream bug? Reacting to common key combinations might be a solution. In my naivety, I thought that this already worked as well. Could that even be a JavaFX/i3wm specific bug?. Thank you for your bug report! I've tried this with OmniGraffle 7.2.2 and was unable to reproduce the issue. Probably a newer version of OmniGraffle fixed it. If my assumption is correct, there are only two options:\n\nWait for the FUSE integration #252, which unfortunately still may take some months.\nUpdate OmniGraffle to a newer version.\n\nIf it still doesn't work with the current version of OmniGraffle, please let me know and I'll try to reproduce the issue again.. Would be great if someone could confirm that this is a standard behavior in Windows Explorer with WebDAV network drives (e.g., with ajaxbrowser.com or webdavserver.com).\nOr even deny it, then we'll look into it.\nThis issue reminded me of #220. That's why I came to the (maybe hasty) conclusion that this might be also WebDAV-related.. Hi @endbacher. I'm not sure if I understand you correctly. Are you referring to the desktop version of Cryptomator or the mobile apps? Because you've stated that you're using Windows/Linux and have posted on the GitHub repository for the desktop version. But you're linking to a support article for the iOS version.\nIf you're referring to the desktop version, this fits into the discussion of #326. We won't integrate cloud storage services directly. In the future, you could use Cyberduck and Mountain Duck to do so.\nIf you're referring to the mobile apps, we'd have to move (or merge) this issue into the GitHub repositories for the iOS and Android apps.. I guess, you've already found https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-ios/issues/73 :smile:\nEven though this is a feature request for the iOS app, you could think of solutions that would involve the desktop version. Actually, the only solution would be optimization for the mobile app: the desktop version could also generate thumbnails. Btw, thumbnails are already generated by the filesystem browsers (Finder, Windows Explorer, etc.). It might be an optimization in theory, but it'd add a lot of complexity.\nLet's keep it simple for now and keep the thumbnail feature as an independent solution, without saving additional thumbnail files in the vault. We can always think of optimizations after that.. I'd just like to add that you can download 1.3.0 RC 3 as a binary. Here is the announcement: https://newsletter.cryptomator.org/archive/rkFGwm1yb/ryCzTHl2/BylszFiMh. Thank you for your bug report! As you can see in the error, your path or filename is too long. Apparently, the fully qualified filename (in other words, the absolute path) cannot be equal or greater than 260 characters in MagentaCLOUD.\nEven though we've considered name shortening in Cryptomator's encryption scheme, you've hit a limit anyway, because your vault is located in a very deep folder structure.\nUnfortunately, we can't make Cryptomator's name shortening \"dynamic\" and make it work magically for all edge cases, because there is no way to predict or determine the path lengths on all systems/devices. It's always an arbitrary \"best guess\" and we chose a threshold of 129 for name shortening, see cryptofs/Constants.java#L17. Currently, this is not a subject to change. We have to set this threshold to some value anyway. The goal is to prevent the creation of too many metadata files and set it reasonably small.\nSolution\nYou could move up your vault in your file hierarchy. Or shorten some directory names that precede your vault (or even shorten the vault name itself). I've looked into your log file and you have to shorten your path by 14 characters to be compatible with MagentaCLOUD's 260 character restriction and Cryptomator's name shortening threshold.. Thank you for your bug report! As you've mentioned it seems to me like an upstream bug in xdg-util. Is that something that we could fix by adding mkdir /usr/share/desktop-directories/ to our spec? Is that tolerable for Linux systems that aren't affected by this bug?. Unable to reproduce anymore. Seems to be fixed. :wink:. Could you please look inside the log file if there is a more specific error message? It is located at %appdata%/Cryptomator/cryptomator.log.\nIf there is nothing in there, have you tried to re-install Cryptomator?\nIf that doesn't help, have you tried to remove Cryptomator from autostart and then restart your computer?\nIf nothing works, do you remember what you could've changed, installed, or updated after Cryptomator was working for the last time?. I must admit that I haven't seen anything like this before. I don't believe that it's a 1.3.0-specific issue but you could try to install 1.2.3 or a more recent 1.3.0 version (1.3.0-rc5).. Glad that it works again. :+1: My assumption was that something happened to the JVM which is bundled with Cryptomator. If I recall correctly, someone else might've had a similar issue when he updated his system-wide JRE. Not sure if that makes any sense because Cryptomator's bundled JVM shouldn't be affected by any system-wide Java installation.\nWe're regularly updating the Android version. We've just released version 0.5.3 and are working on 0.6.0 right now. Is there anything specific that you're looking for?. Afaik, you can connect to a Synology NAS via WebDAV. After mounting the WebDAV drive on your system, you can create und unlock a vault with Cryptomator.\nAs @emuio pointed out, you could use Mountain Duck in the future (beginning with version 2.0) to mount a WebDAV drive that is already capable of unlocking Cryptomator vaults. You can sign up for a beta here.\nIf you don't need (or want) to mount a WebDAV drive on your system, could use Cyberduck to browse a WebDAV storage (that is already capable of unlocking Cryptomator vaults since version 6.0).\nWe're also working on a CLI version of Cryptomator (it's an early version and not ready for production use yet). But we don't know, how and if it would work on a Synology NAS. May be worth exploring in the future.. @overheadhunter I was able to reproduce this issue. Not sure if it has been reintroduced in 1.3.1 or never worked in the first place. Should I reopen this issue and set to the 1.3.2 milestone? Or should I create a new issue?. Thank you for your bug report! You're right, issues with Cyberduck should be reported at https://trac.cyberduck.io/\nI hope that's okay if I close the issue here. \ud83d\ude05. We don't have an \"official\" portable version of Cryptomator. The feature request is documented in issue #48.\nHave you seen this comment yet? https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/48#issuecomment-254763278\nA user wrote a blog post on how to build a portable version: https://www.simonpbriggs.co.uk/cryptomator-portable-usb-stick/. Sorry, I absolutely misunderstood your bug report. I suppose, this is then related to #78. Could be fixed when using Dokany #207. Unfortunately, nothing we can do while using WebDAV for providing the virtual drive.. You're absolutely correct that this isn't straightforward yet. We're looking into enhancements for future versions, e.g. #336. Theoretically, you could already achieve that with Sanitizer.\nThe easiest way would be to check https://drive.google.com/drive/recent and if you know when you've changed the particular file, you'll be able to find it quite easily.\nIf there have been many changes recently, this is indeed more challenging. Probably the safest way to go would be to use the encryptPath command of Sanitizer. Check out the requirements you would need: Java 8 + JCE.. I'm totally with you. We're able to reproduce this behavior and are currently looking into it. Thank you for your bug report! \ud83d\udc4d . Awesome! Thank you for letting us know @scowalt! \ud83d\udc4d. Just to be sure: Does the installer continue or does it abort the installation? We've already received some reports that writing into the hosts file doesn't work. But we don't know yet why this might be the case.\nWorkaround\nAdd 127.0.0.1 cryptomator-vault to the hosts file and the installer will skip the write process.. I see in your edits that you found this support article. Just updated the article because we don't even have the IPv6 setting in Cryptomator anymore.\nNot sure if it's still necessary to install Desktop Experience on Windows Server 2016 but that might be a good start. And check the \"WebDAV Redirector\" setting which should be active.. Hi @tech-mohr, thank you for your bug report! \ud83d\udc4d  Could you please attach the log file located at %appdata%/Cryptomator/cryptomator.log? Check beforehand if the log file contains anything suspicious (e.g., errors/exceptions).\nIf it worked with Cryptomator 1.2.x, there might be a chance that we could fix this regression.. Hm, the log file doesn't contain anything useful. Did you attach the screenshot? I must admit that I can't see it on GitHub.. Hi @fv0, thank you for your report! \ud83d\udc4d I admit that I've noticed this as well but I have the bad feeling that this can't be solved while using JavaFX. \ud83d\ude14 If we do find a way to solve this, I'd be glad to fix it.. Too much time has passed. I have no idea if we ever reproduced the issue or not. Unfortunately, we're unable to reproduce it.\n@KarlNapp2011 Are you still able to reproduce the issue? Does the issue still exist? If yes, what Windows version are you using and what kind of WebDAV server?. Okay, I got it. You have to reproduce the issue by doing \"Add a network location\" instead of \"Map network drive\u2026\". \ud83d\ude05 . Hi Aries, I must admit that we have no idea if Cryptomator will work with Dropbox's Project Infinite. As far as I know, it's not released yet so it's hard to try it out. :wink: I guess we just have to wait and see. If someone already has access to this feature, we'd be happy to hear how it works out with Cryptomator. :smile:. Thank you for your bug report! \ud83d\udc4d Just did some research and it looks like a known issue (found via this article).\nNot sure what we can do here. I'm also a little confused why the issue JDK-8178537 is \"closed\" on Java Bug System. Well, it says \"cannot reproduce\" but that doesn't really help. \ud83d\ude15\nThere's an interesting information there: Could you try out the 32-bit version of Cryptomator? Could be worth a try.\nWorkaround\n\nIf you have RivaTuner installed, the workaround is to close RivaTuner before launching a Java app. [Source]. Thank you for your feedback and input! :+1: I must admit that I currently don't have much time to answer this in full detail. The \"itch\" was that there was no solution for encrypting cloud storage files that is simultaneously\n\n\nopen source\nmulti-platform\neasy to use\n\nWe currently don't have a comparison of Cryptomator with other products. It's definitely a good idea and we might add this information in the future.. If I understood you correctly, that shouldn't be a problem at all. The .git folder won't interfere with Cryptomator (and vice versa).\n~~Just be aware of the size limitations of Git.~~ If you're hosting your data on GitHub, be aware of its size limitations. Maybe Git LFS helps with that. :smile:\nIf you run into any problems, feel free to re-open this issue.\nEdit: Thank you for your correction @arbox.. Unfortunately, I don't have an idea regarding the permissions issue. Could be related to Git though. If you're able to reproduce the issue, feel free to let us know. \ud83d\udc4d\nHow the directory listing is updated, is dependent on the WebDAV client. We can't influence that. Not sure what OS you're using. On Windows using Windows Explorer, you have to press F5. On macOS using Finder, you have to unfocus/focus the window. On Linux I have no idea. \ud83d\ude05. Duplicate of #42. We're still waiting for Java 9 that will fix this issue.. Hm, adding localhost and 127.0.0.1 to the exception list would've been my suggestion as well. Could you please look into the log file (located at ~/Library/Logs/Cryptomator/cryptomator.log) and check what the error message is?. The error java.net.UnknownHostException: api.cryptomator.org: nodename nor servname provided, or not known can be ignored. It's just trying to connect to https://api.cryptomator.org/updates/latestVersion.json to check for the latest version. This shouldn't influence the application.\nAs far as I can tell, mounting of the virtual drive was successful. Could you please describe what the issue exactly is? What do you mean by \"you can't access\" the drive?. All right, thanks for the info! I just want to make sure... is this what you've done?\n\nSwitch environment to your work place\nUnlock vault with Cryptomator\nVirtual drive is nowhere to be found (and this is the point of time when you've posted the log file?). After your second scenario: There is really nothing in the log file? And what do you mean by \"doesn't work\". Is there some kind of error message or is the virtual drive also \"just\" missing?\n\nI must admit that I'm almost out of ideas. \ud83d\ude05 We had a similar case a while back in issue #64. But that issue is both old and doesn't really apply here because it was somewhat Windows-specific.\nI don't know if this information is true but maybe the list in \"Bypass proxy settings for these Hosts & Domains\" is ignored when using \"Automatic Proxy Configuration\": https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/23131/is-it-possible-to-bypass-a-proxy-when-the-proxy-settings-are-set-to-auto-proxy-c\nAre you able to change the PAC file or would that not be possible? If you can, here is a sample PAC file. You could check if there is something like this in there (or add it if it's missing):\nif (isPlainHostName(host))\n{\nreturn 'DIRECT';\n}. We actually had file size obfuscation in the past and we removed it for usability reasons. Detailed explanation under \"The Downside\" of the 1.2.0 release.. Oh wow, that's a very old backup of our website when we had trouble with GitHub Pages. I guess it's time to take it down. \ud83d\ude05 See the current website: https://cryptomator.org/security/architecture/. That is correct.. Thank you for your bug report. Is there anything in the log file (located at ~/Library/Logs/Cryptomator/cryptomator.log) after you select the vault in the list?. This is quite similar to #546. It's not the same but maybe it can be fixed at the same time. The other report was on macOS but it looks like the new inter-process communication is more prone to failure regardless of the OS.. Just to be sure, could you quit Cryptomator and start it again? If it still works, then I'll mark it indeed as solved.. Thank you for the info! If you encounter this error again, feel free to reopen this issue.. There is no mount point on Android. Cryptomator for Android communicates directly with the cloud (and local) storage.\nFor further questions regarding Cryptomator for Android, please refer to the Cryptomator for Android issues repository or ask them in our new Cryptomator Community.\nThank you!. Have you installed the Desktop Experience for Windows Server?. Thank you for your bug report. I was able to reproduce the issue (even though it was artificially constructed).\nIt has to be fixed in https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptofs/issues/16, will have to see if @cryptomator/collaborators agree on this. It's probably the same bug in Android as well.\nIn my opinion, it's a regression because this should've worked fine in Cryptomator 1.2.x.\n@scetu: I'm not sure how that happened in your case specifically. Did some synchronization gone wrong or something similar? Ideally, there shouldn't be broken directory files. That's why my guess is that a messy or unfinished synchronization caused this.. I must admit that I didn't understand your issue. I understood the following:\n\nYou installed, opened up Cryptomator, created a new vault (at what destination?)\nYou unlocked the new vault\nYou created a folder called \"documents\" and put one txt file in it\nYou created a folder called \"new folder\" inside \"documents\" and put 50 files in it\n\nSooo, what's the issue here? If you navigate through the vault via the provided virtual drive, everything should be decrypted as expected. What operating system are you on? Did you look inside the log file if there's anything suspicious? More information would be great, that's why we have the issue template.. Okay, I think I understand the issue now. The stack trace from the log file helps. Just want to let you know that this has nothing to do with the equals sign. That was a rare error that happened during a vault migration in the past. And that made the filename and not(!) the file contents unreadable. In your case it's the content that is unreadable:\nThe file or directory is corrupted and unreadable.\nSome questions:\n\nRegarding the <filename> you've redacted: Does it begin with a 0 (zero)? That would be good to know because if yes, it's a hint that the directory file is somehow broken. Otherwise you should get 50 errors like that for all files. So I'm trying to figure out if the directory \"new folder\" is corrupted or all 50 files inside that.\nIs the txt file in your root folder (inside \"documents\") readable? Or is that also broken?\nWhat happens if you create another folder and also put e.g. one txt file inside it. Does it also disappear after you lock/close and then unlock the vault?. Duplicate of #418. Maybe related to #527 somehow? But yes, please elaborate @BlackRabbit22. This is what the issue template is for.. I'm not aware of a logic to check for used ports. I guess it's currently \"either the port is free or not\". You can pick a different port in the settings.. Oh man, what a bug. \ud83d\ude15 No clue, how to fix that but maybe it has to do something with these lines of code: native-functions/org_cryptomator_jni_MacApplicationUiState.m. Sorry that we didn't respond. The thing is... none of us has High Sierra and we're unable to reproduce the issue. And due to error 500, someone probably has to do some debugging. In my case, I can look into it as soon as High Sierra gets released but I don't have a machine that I can upgrade now. Need something absolutely stable for development. ;). Wait a minute. EagleFiler. We had a recent support case that EagleFiler unmounts WebDAV drives. At least, a user tested it with a \"regular\" WebDAV drive as well (e.g., from webdavserver.com or ajaxbrowser.com).\n\nCan you please quit EagleFiler and see if you can reproduce the issue?. In the support case I've mentioned, it was just a suspicion that EagleFiler could be responsible for the unexpected unmounting of the virtual drive. I told him to try out the aforementioned WebDAV servers if he could reproduce the issue. The user said:\n\nFor whatever reason, the [WebDAV] drive gets ejected while EagleFiler is running.\n\nAnd he also just started having issues after installing High Sierra. Maybe it's a just coincidence that EagleFiler (and maybe DEVONthink, I don't know) is involved on both of your systems.. Just wanted to report that I've spent some time trying to reproduce the issue. So yes, I can reproduce the issue, however I'd like to mention that our initial hunch that it's a Finder bug is probably true. I've tried the same scenario (saving an Excel file) on https://webdavserver.com (without any Cryptomator involvement) and I got the same force unmount behavior.\nThis is from the system log:\nNov 15 14:40:30 <username> KernelEventAgent[104]: tid 54485244 received event(s) VQ_NOTRESP (1)\nNov 15 14:40:30 <username> KernelEventAgent[104]: tid 54485244 type 'webdav', mounted on '/Volumes/User409d762', from 'https://webdavserver.com/User409d762/', not responding\nNov 15 14:40:30 <username> KernelEventAgent[104]: tid 54485244 found 1 filesystem(s) with problem(s)\nNov 15 14:40:30 <username> KernelEventAgent[104]: tid 54485244 received event(s) VQ_NOTRESP, VQ_DEAD (33)\nNov 15 14:40:30 <username> KernelEventAgent[104]: tid 54485244 type 'webdav', mounted on '/Volumes/User409d762', from 'https://webdavserver.com/User409d762/', dead\nNov 15 14:40:30 <username> KernelEventAgent[104]: tid 54485244 force unmount https://webdavserver.com/User409d762/ from /Volumes/User409d762\nNov 15 14:40:30 <username> KernelEventAgent[104]: tid 54485244 found 1 filesystem(s) with problem(s)\nOf course, it doesn't change that Cryptomator is affected by this bug but it's nothing that we can fix directly (besides switching to FUSE... and yes, we're working on it). We'll document this as good as possible for Apple and file a bug report.. Yes, I'm aware that it also happens when copying many files into the virtual drive. E.g., I created 1000x 1 MB files with mkfile 1m {1..1000}.dat but just saving an Excel file over and over again seems simpler to me. I think saving an Excel file has a higher chance to reproduce the issue because a single save creates hundreds of WebDAV requests, other than let's say TextEdit.. Just noticed that there are crash reports of webdavfs_agent in ~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/. If anyone else already filed a bug report, this might help. :wink:. Unfortunately, not fixed with macOS 10.13.2. I've updated my bug report to Apple but I haven't received any response yet.. Update: Apparently, my bug report was a duplicate and it has been closed. I see that as an acknowledgment by Apple that the bug exists.. Issue persists with macOS 10.13.3.. I guess we forgot to unlock this issue. \ud83d\ude04\nIf anyone can already report experiences with Mojave (and WebDAV), we'll be grateful. We'll do some tests on our own soon but it'd be good to know if Apple has fixed this.\nEither way, you can test our second beta of 1.4.0 with FUSE integration.. Seems to be resolved in Mojave. Can't say with absolute certainty since it takes quite some time to reproduce the issue (at least on my machines). I copied tens of thousands of files (about 5 GB data) into a vault and the drive didn't disappear once. Did the same test on a different machine with High Sierra and the drive disappeared twice (could've been more times if I retried it until the end).\nAlso tried the same test scenario on High Sierra with FUSE and the drive didn't disappear. I think it's safe to say that the issue is resolved. If anyone can reproduce this particular issue (disappearing drive) on High Sierra (or higher) with FUSE or Mojave with WebDAV, please let us know.\nAll tests were performed with Cryptomator 1.4.0-beta2.. Duplicate of #283. As far as I remember, there are Linux file managers that only accept dav:// and others only webdav://. In a very early version of Cryptomator, we only considered dav:// and then someone reported that we should also support webdav:// in #57. That's why, both schemes are available. But it's true that probably one option would cause an error.\nIn your case, just use dav:// and don't bother using webdav://. From a developer's perspective, the following would be ideal: A user should not have to choose between dav:// and webdav://. An algorithm should automatically try both and see what works without showing errors.. I suppose it has something to do with the new \"Files On-Demand\" feature. See: https://community.cryptomator.org/t/onedrive-windows-insider-preview/421. Looks like the error in issue #390. Cryptomator doesn't work with Java 9 yet, you have to downgrade to Java 8.. Hey everyone. Just wanted to let you know that we didn't forget this issue (I had this tab open since forever). We haven't managed to set everything up for reproducing the issue yet. At the same time, we're about to release the update 1.3.2 soon.\nCould you please try 1.3.2 after its release and let us know if you're still experiencing issues? In the meantime, could you please try out regular WebDAV drives if you're experiencing the same issues? You can use WebDAV test servers like https://webdavserver.com/ or https://ajaxbrowser.com/.. Just to be sure: Is this issue related to #607 (or #174)?. Hm, it's timing out after 5 seconds. The timeout is set here:\nMacAppleScriptMounter.java#L49\nI'm not sure if increasing the timeout would help. Or it's actually \"stuck\" in your case.\nWe had an issue in the past #511 that occurred when using \"auto unlock\" but that should've been fixed. If you look at your Finder sidebar on the left, is there a \"Shared\" category with localhost? If yes, could you eject all drives there and try again?\n. Oh sorry, the timeout is not configurable, I was just thinking out loud. We could increase the timeout for the next update but I'm not sure if that's even the cause of the issue you're experiencing.. Original issue by @JoeMurray seems to be resolved. We'll increase the timeout in the next update so that you can try the \"auto unlock\" feature again with 1.3.2.\nPlease keep the High Sierra discussion in #579. You may file a bug report to Apple as well if you'd like to help us out.. Hm, error message seems familiar. See https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/408#issuecomment-282565556. But it may be something else because I haven't seen This tool has been deprecated, use 'gio mount' instead. before.. Duplicate of #356 . I've reopened #464. I've closed it because it has been fixed in High Sierra and it probably won't ever be fixed in Sierra. But you're right that it should stay opened for discoverability. We'll close it after we've switched to FUSE (#252) and then it'll also be fixed in Sierra.\nSo yeah, duplicate of #464 :wink:. Originally, we wanted to fix this in 1.3.4. We checked what has changed between 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 and couldn't figure out what could've caused this because we didn't make any changes to the tray icon/menu. The only thing that I can think of is a different JDK 8 version. But we haven't tested this explicitly and can't confirm this hypothesis yet. We didn't want to delay 1.3.4 any further so this issue has been rescheduled to 1.4.0.. We've documented sharing here: https://community.cryptomator.org/t/how-do-i-share-files-with-others/41\n\nCan cryptomator deal with several team members performing concurrent read-write access on files in a vault?\n\nThis is basically \"the same\" as if you'd access unencrypted files concurrently. If there is a sync conflict, you're probably familiar with how most cloud storage services deal with this. They'll create a conflict file (e.g., by appending a (1) to indicate that there was a conflict) and you have to figure out which file to keep.\nThe same happens on encrypted files. Cryptomator is able to detect sync conflicts and will show you the conflicted file with a (Conflict XYZ) at the end.. I wanted to add that special characters aren't the issue. We've done some extended testing and we believe that \"long paths\" are the issue. We don't know the threshold and we don't know if this is a new issue in Windows 10 (with some update) or if it has been like that for a long time.\nWe were able to reproduce the issue with a \"regular\" WebDAV server like webdavserver.com. So it's definitely a bug in Windows Explorer's WebDAV client.\nAnother workaround would be to shorten your paths since Windows doesn't deal with them well. Ultimately, this can only be fixed by Microsoft or at the latest when we switch to another filesystem with Cryptomator 1.4.0.. I'm unable to confirm the bug. I'm also at macOS 10.13.3. The Java runtime installed at system-level shouldn't have any influence on the bundled Java runtime inside Cryptomator (which is using Java 8u152).\nI think @wello007 and @saesh are having different issues. One is failing due to a timeout (we've recently increased the timeout from 5 seconds to 30 seconds but it looks like that it doesn't matter how long the timeout actually is) and the other one is failing due to an unexpected mount result (and it looks like the result is empty).\nFor a better understanding what the MacAppleScriptMounter is doing: As the name says, Cryptomator uses AppleScript to mount the WebDAV drive. It's basically like if you'd call the following in Terminal:\nsh\n/usr/bin/osascript -e \"mount volume \\\"http://localhost:42427/<vault_id>/<vault_name>\\\"\"\nYou can use the \"Copy WebDAV URL\" function in Cryptomator for the exact URL. This command doesn't seem to do its job in @saesh's case.\nLet's say the command worked and the result of it was file Foo:. After that, Cryptomator verifies that the mounted drive exists:\nsh\n/usr/bin/osascript -e \"tell application \\\"Finder\\\" to repeat while not (\\\"Foo:\\\" exists)\" -e \"delay 0.1\" -e \"end repeat\"\nThis seems to run into a timeout in @wello007's case.\nUnfortunately, I don't know why this happens in either of your cases. Maybe you can try out these commands in Terminal yourself and see if there is any difference. There shouldn't be because that's basically what Cryptomator is doing but maybe there's more output (with other error messages).. Duplicate of #274 . Auto-lock setting is available in the settings of Cryptomator. Other than that, it's technically not possible to detect when a smartphone is locked on iOS.\nPlease post iOS issues in this repository: https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-ios. Duplicate of #636\nPlease post iOS issues in this repository: https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-ios. The motivation of captchas isn't to prevent \"spy software\" from working. Captchas are used to determine whether or not the user is human. I don't think that this has anything to do with Cryptomator.\nPlease refer to the security target documentation regarding malware: https://cryptomator.org/security/advice/#protection\n\nCryptomator cannot provide protection if the local computer is infected with malware which reads entered passwords and file contents (e.g., files in an unlocked vault).. Die Ursache von Systemfehler 53 und 67 hatten wir eigentlich fr\u00fcher schon gefunden und behoben: https://cryptomator.org/blog/2016/12/02/release-1.2.3_de.html\n\nNormalerweise behebt der Cryptomator-Installer diesen Registry-Eintrag, aber k\u00f6nntest du bitte in der Registry HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\NetworkProvider\\Order pr\u00fcfen, ob der Schl\u00fcssel ProviderOrder den Wert webclient beinhaltet? Ich kann mich auch an einen Nutzer erinnern, bei dem noch der Eintrag webclientc existierte, den er l\u00f6schen musste.\nWenn alles mit der Registry in Ordnung ist, k\u00f6nnte es noch andere Ursachen geben, die mir jetzt so direkt nicht bekannt sind. Aber gib bitte erst mal Bescheid, ob das mit der Registry so stimmt.. Andersherum, entfern bitte den Eintrag webclientcl. Der Eintrag webclient ist wichtig, sonst kann's nicht funktionieren.\nAn der Java-Version, die auf dem System installiert ist, kann's eigentlich nicht liegen, weil Cryptomator eine eigene Java-Runtime mitbringt, die unabh\u00e4ngig vom System-Java genutzt wird.. Statt einem Computer-Neustart kannst du \u00fcbrigens den sogenannten WebClient explizit neustarten. Bspw. \u00fcber services.msc oder auch in der cmd: net stop webclient und danach net start webclient.\nAber gut, wenn du das definitiv schon ausprobiert hast, den webclientcl zu l\u00f6schen und den webclient-Eintrag vorne zu belassen, dann wird die Fehlersuche etwas schwieriger. Grunds\u00e4tzlich vorweg: Falls du noch Windows-Updates offen hast, f\u00fchr sie am besten aus. Vielleicht wird der Fehler dadurch behoben.\nKurzer technischer Hintergrund: Ein Programm oder eine Einstellung in Windows verhindert in deinem Fall die Bereitstellung des virtuellen Laufwerks von Cryptomator (das technisch auf WebDAV basiert). Dabei k\u00f6nnen auch Antivirenprogramme oder Firewalls f\u00fcr das Problem verantwortlich sein.\nEine Sache m\u00f6chte ich noch vorschlagen, die seit Cryptomator 1.3.0 neu ist. Und zwar verwendet Cryptomator neuerdings einen \"eigenen\" Host-Namen (siehe Blog-Post unter \"Technical Details on Windows Mounting\"). Nachdem du den Tresor entsperrt hast (und der Fehler kommt), lass den Tresor offen und f\u00fchr folgenden Befehl in der cmd aus:\nnet use * \\\\localhost@42427\\DavWWWRoot\\ CwdXzke5SDO-/VaultCro /persistent:no\nStatt localhost nutzt Cryptomator n\u00e4mlich cryptomator-vault und ich habe bisher von einem Nutzer berichtet bekommen, dass es damit nicht klappt. Allerdings erh\u00e4lt er den Systemfehler 59, daher bin ich skeptisch, dass das bei dir die Ursache ist.\nAnsonsten kannst du dich an andere Software-Installationen, Updates o.\u00e4. erinnern zwischen dem letzten funktionierenden Zustand und jetzt?. As you've seen in Sanitizer's \"check\" report, your vault has a lot of errors. It seems like that your masterkey doesn't match your vault's contents. Is it possible that you replaced the masterkey somehow?\nHow did you transfer the vault? Simply using Windows Explorer or did you use a third-party software?. I can't figure out what happened to your vault.\n\nMaking a vault on an external drive. Yes, that should work.\nPasting some mp4 files inside the vault. Yes, that should work.\nClosing the vault and opening it again. Yes, that should work.\nCopying a vault from one disk to an external drive. Yes, that should work.\n\nSooo, what else happened? There must be more to it. Is this is a reproducible issue? Could you please create a new test vault and do the same steps again?. Did you update to the latest version of Cryptomator? We fixed that in version 1.3.2, see issue #554.. Is there anything inside the log file?. That's totally enough, I don't need the complete path, thank you.\nIs it possible that the Google Drive application (or maybe you're already using Backup and Sync from Google) gives you a dialog something along the way with \"Are you sure you'd like to remove the shared folder X and should it be deleted for all users?\".\nI'm asking because your log message says AccessDeniedException and I suspect that Google Drive might block the deletion because of that confirmation dialog.\nWhat happens if you delete the folder d\\JE\\GJEVBG7BXIZYEMRYY4WL6ANOVJIDHU manually and tried the deletion in the Cryptomator vault again?. > You're right, it's backup&sync (what stupid name...) but I didn't get any notification - even on the tray icon I cannot see any extraordinary behavior.\nHm, but is there an option to confirm the deletion of that folder in Google Drive? And after you press \"Remove\" there, does the deletion in Cryptomator work afterwards?\n\nHmmm....I don't like the thinking of deleting something manually in that encrypted folder as I don't know what I'm going to delete.\n\nYou're right, that could totally go wrong. I was quite confident it's d\\JE\\GJEVBG7BXIZYEMRYY4WL6ANOVJIDHU because that's what it says in your log file. But again, you're right... better not fiddling around in the encrypted part. :wink:\n\nIs there a Google Drive (I stay with the old name) logfile that would help you?\n\nNot sure if that's even necessary.\nThat's just how Google Drive behaves inside shared folders. In its default setting, it'll ask for confirmation to delete files/folders when they're inside a shared folder. You can change it in the preferences and set \"Removing items\" to \"Remove items everywhere\" instead of \"Ask me before removing items everywhere\". Or maybe it's not even that option, there's also a setting \"Show warning when you remove items from a shared folder\". Or it's both. :laughing:. Duplicate of #612. Yes, your assumption is correct. Duplicate of #422.. Wait but it COULD be improved!\n\nIt's not possible to rename files/folders to the same name with a different case. But Windows Explorer shows an informational message and doesn't result in inaccessible files/folders.\n\nAre you sure to close this? Cryptomator behaves differently in this case than a \"regular\" WebDAV server.. I've added a test vault for more convenience. Password is test. It contains two empty files: o\u0308.txt (NFD) and \u00fc.txt (NFC).\nIssue 665.zip. Unable to reproduce the issue with 1.4.0-beta2. @pos42 Please let us know if the issue reoccurs.. @jellemdekker I can create the assets but I'll probably commit them myself and it doesn't have to be part of this PR.. That's right. Only add the English localization. Localization for other languages is done via POEditor: https://poeditor.com/projects/view?id=52217\nAfaik, the new terms will automatically be loaded into POEditor when they're found in the develop branch.. Is this something that you can always reproduce? If yes, what are the steps in detail?\nIn other note, we're currently developing Cryptomator 1.4.0 and we might've already fixed this issue. Please retest with 1.4.0-beta2 which introduces FUSE support.\n\u26a0\ufe0f Be aware, this is beta software! Back up your data and use this version for testing only!. Oh yes, thank you for noticing it so quickly. We rebuilt it, please download the AppImage (using the same link) and try again. :smile:. I'm quite certain that I've built it with JDK 10.0.1 and it works on my machine. That's strange. Just to be sure, I reinstalled JDK 10 and rebuilt Cryptomator 1.4.0-beta2. It's now on Bintray again (direct download link). Even though you've found a workaround @PKizzle, could you retest the newly uploaded version?. I did some digging. Looks like our new build script doesn't work as expected. Uploaded a new version again (same link) using the old script. Maybe something went wrong with code signing but I'm not sure what exactly. Will have to figure it out for the next version.. All right, thank you for testing! Yes, let's leave it open and we'll close it when it's fixed. \ud83d\udc4d. @johannrichard I remember that this bug existed and totally forgot about it. But I'm unable to reproduce it anymore, maybe because of a Mojave update? I'm running 10.14 (18A389).\nFeel free to reopen if you're still experiencing the issue on the latest Mojave update.. I guess, I didn't test this properly. Bug still exists. Now tested with 10.14 (18A391).\nEdit: It may be an upstream bug.. ## Workaround\n\nOpen Cryptomator.app which brings the application in focus (even when it's in background mode).\nMenu bar icon works as expected.. Did some digging and I'm almost certain that it's an upstream bug. This is the closest error report I could find (even though no java.awt.SystemTray is involved): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52323438/assertion-failure-in-nsevent\n\nI'm seeing the exact error message in Console as soon as the popup menu disappears:\n2018-11-03 15:57:51.330 java[34147:3260031] unrecognized type is 4294967295\n2018-11-03 15:57:51.330 java[34147:3260031] *** Assertion failure in -[NSEvent _initWithCGEvent:eventRef:], /BuildRoot/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/AppKit/AppKit-1671.10.106/AppKit.subproj/NSEvent.m:1969\nI think that some JavaFX event listener is being triggered and the error causes the popup menu to disappear. But that's just a wild theory.\nContrary to the answer on Stack Overflow, I don't think that this bug has anything to do with JDK-8211137 because the app doesn't crash. However, I can actually confirm the app crashing when switching between apps while a dialog is open. But that doesn't have anything to do with this issue.\nI couldn't reproduce the issue when running this simple system tray example. That's why I think that JavaFX somehow has to be involved.. Somehow related to #768, seems to be fixed in OpenJFX 11.0.2. Scheduled for the next Cryptomator release.. Duplicate of #579 \nUnfortunately, this is a WebDAV bug in High Sierra's Finder: https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/579#issuecomment-344597354\nNot sure if this will be fixed in Mojave, we'll investigate this soon. However, we've already been working on FUSE.\nYou can try out the beta version of 1.4.0: https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.4.0-beta2\n:warning: This is a beta version! Make backups and don't use this version for production data. :warning:. Duplicate of #612. Please retest with 1.4.0-beta3.. Please retest with 1.4.0-beta3.. Duplicate of #80. The check happens here: webdav-nio-adapter/LinuxGvfsMounter.java#L26\nIt expects an exit value of 0 when executing the command which gvfs-mount xdg-open. Can you try that command after updating to gvfs 1.38.0 and let us know what the result is?. Thank you! Looks like gvfs-mount is missing. Can't find anything in the changelog that would suggest that this command has been renamed/deleted. Maybe it's a bug and they'll fix it sooner or later? \ud83e\udd14. @overheadhunter I was thinking the same thing. This issue is reproducible when solely using FUSE-NIO-Adapter and it's not reproducible when using bindfs. So yeah, it should be fixed in our FUSE layer.\nEdit: It has been mentioned here but the issue is only reproducible when a folder contains a special character. Files didn't matter.. See https://community.cryptomator.org/t/why-is-the-masterkey-stored-in-the-cloud/31. I'm preeetty sure that this is something that we've fixed in #705. Thus, marking this as duplicate of #705. We're very close to releasing a new version. If this issue still persists after that, feel free to reopen this issue.. @peterski007 All right, maybe there is much more to it. Looks like we haven't solved this particular issue after all. \ud83d\ude15 We re-opened #705. Thank you for your feedback!. Probably duplicate of #705 but leaving this open since I'm not 100% sure.. We're about to release 1.4.0-rc1 which will include the fix mentioned by @infeo. Yes, the bug is still there in 1.4.0-beta3.\nDuplicate of #705 and #742.. Still working out the release notes and other downloads than macOS but here it is (basically fresh from the oven): https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.4.0-rc1. The WebDAV-specific options were actually introduced as a workaround because of all the WebDAV-related problems in Windows Explorer, macOS Finder, etc. that could be circumvented by using alternative WebDAV clients. Since the introduction of Cryptomator's Dokany/FUSE support, we wanted to simplify Cryptomator because these workarounds aren't necessary anymore. We also chose to simplify it because it was technically challenging to keep the WebDAV-specific options while also supporting Dokany/FUSE. I'm not sure if it's feasible to re-add the options.\nTo understand your cases: Is it really \"necessary\" to use Cryptomator via a WebDAV client? Cryptomator is intended to be used via the operating system's native file system browser like Windows Explorer. Btw, if you're using Cyberduck, you don't even need Cryptomator since it's already integrated into Cyberduck itself.\nIn the meantime, if you're absolutely dependent on the now missing options, you may downgrade to 1.3.x which is 100% compatible to 1.4.x if you're only using WebDAV anyway.. Does Cryptomator crash instantly or does it take, let's say, 10 seconds? We're currently working on #711 to address the performance issues and it may or may not be related to this issue. Nevertheless, we'll try to reproduce the issue with Office but afaik we haven't reproduced this issue in the past.. Just wanted to add that we should consider Dokany here as well since custom mount points have been added to Dokany in the latest version of Cryptomator.. Related to #758. I mentioned this briefly in an unrelated issue: https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/701#issuecomment-435595831\nIt's an upstream bug in JavaFX and will be resolved in their next update: https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8211304\nAfter their release, we'll have to see when and how Cryptomator's dependencies are updated. It's currently not so trivial since the JDK 11 mess-up.. Depends on #769. Regarding the first issue: We can't prevent what other applications are doing. If LibreOffice saves at a location inside the mount point even though the vault has been locked, then that's how it is.\n@overheadhunter I would suggest adding a warning in the UI regardless of using a custom mount point or not.. Yes, you have to go to each vault, press \"More Options\" and then deselect \"Reveal Drive\".. Oh, I think I understand the issue now. Thank you for pointing out that the vault changes in the vault list. It's probably because of #79.. What you see is the encrypted content. In order to see the decrypted content (basically what your goal is), you have to add this vault to Cryptomator and unlock it.\nThe easiest way is to double-click the masterkey.cryptomator file, which will automatically add the vault to Cryptomator. Enter the password and press \"Unlock Vault\".\nAnother way would be to press the \"+\" button at the bottom left in Cryptomator and select \"Open Existing Vault\". In the file chooser dialog, select the masterkey.cryptomator file. After that, it's the same as before: Enter the password and press \"Unlock Vault\".. Hm, now I'm not so sure about the reproducibility of this issue to begin with. I've mentioned that I can't mount at C:\\Foo but I can't reproduce it anymore, not even with Cryptomator 1.4.2. I still can't mount at E:\\Foo (USB drive) though.. Duplicate of #701. Sorry, I was too hasty and thought your bug report sounded plausible enough to be a regression (because downgrading to 1.4.2 helped in your case). But I must say that I'm unable to reproduce the issue. I downloaded the latest version of Typora und created a Markdown file inside the vault that is mounted via Dokany. I don't have any issues while saving. Is this something that you can reliabily reproduce? If yes, how exactly?\nEdit: Tested on Windows 10 with a vault located at my desktop.. Thank you for your bug report. I can confirm the issue and it seems to affect more than Windows and Office 365. I can also reproduce this with TextEdit on macOS. We only made small changes to the WebDAV implementation to suppress symlinks but it probably had a wider effect. We'll look into it!. Does this issue also occur in the latest version of Cryptomator (currently, 1.4.5)?. I'm unable to reproduce the issue on my iMac with the latest version of Mojave. With Cryptomator 1.4.6, the latest log file is now called cryptomator0.log. Have you looked inside ~/Library/Logs/Cryptomator in general? There should be something.\nCould you please check if you're also having this issue with the previous version? You can download Cryptomator 1.4.5 for macOS here.. Thank you for your contribution! Translations should be done via POEditor instead of changing the localization file directly. Feel free to join the project here: https://poeditor.com/join/project/bHwbvJmx0E. Ah, maybe you can't see it because it's already 100% translated. I've unlocked \"completed\" languages, please try again.. ",

A note on implementation:\nA repeated encryption of the folder is not necessary when changing passwords. The KEK can simply be recalculated, changing the encrypted keys while keeping the actual keys.\nThis however leaves a small vulnerability if the history of the .masterkey is kept by the remote service. Since the keys did not change, they can still be derived from the old .masterkey file if the password was weak enough, and data which is added after changing the passwords may be decrypted.\nIt is questionable if changing passwords would imply to the user that the keys are being changed. Since cryptomator is supposed to be a tool for non-experts, it might be better to change the actual keys during a password change or even ensure that a \"good\" password is chosen to begin with.\n. Well of course it is. It popped into my head while I was doing something else and unfortunately I didn't bother to check.\n. Quick question: will ammending this commit mess with the pull request?\n. No, it's not and I'm not sure if it should be the default behaviour. I'm don't feel confident that renaming the Dropbox folder as soon as it's added to Cryptomator is the right way, since this requires reconfiguring the Dropbox. It would be amazing if there was an automatic reconfiguration, but without it, it seems counterproductive.\n. Well either way, I think this point is it's own issue. We can also add .masterkey.json to the Info.plist and should probably do something on Windows as well.\n. Lol, wrong IOUtil.

FXMLoader in turn returns Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader() in getDefaultClassLoader().\n. Oh the result was this:\nException in thread \"AppKit Thread\" java.lang.NullPointerException\n    at javafx.fxml.JavaFXBuilderFactory.<init>(JavaFXBuilderFactory.java:121)\n    at javafx.fxml.JavaFXBuilderFactory.<init>(JavaFXBuilderFactory.java:87)\n    at javafx.fxml.FXMLLoader.<init>(FXMLLoader.java:2054)\n    at org.cryptomator.ui.MainController.showView(MainController.java:144)\n. If you open a file with the application and the application is not yet running, OSX calls the open file handler \"after the main thread\" (not sure what this means, but after all it's magic). This is why the handler must be set in the actual java main thread. Setting it Application.init() or Application.start(...) is too late (different thread).\nI don't know what else we could be doing wrong.\nAre you able to replicate the bug?\n. Nonono, interestingly that works just fine. The problem is when you plain open the application and then select a folder from the list in the application. Should happen if opened from IDE as well.\n. I didn't notice this before because I was accidentally still using the run configuration \"MainApplication\", which also starts without an explicit main function. I only ever tested the new use case with the bundled app.\n. Can you explain the changes / what wasn't working and is working now and why?\nI wrote the original file (just copied things / trial and error) and would like to learn more about it.\n. 18 MB/s is very low. Maybe for some reason the native x86 AES instructions aren't being used. Are you using an installed version of cryptomator?\n(Some background)\nhttps://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-7184394\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/23058309/aes-ni-intrinsics-enabled-by-default\n. > Multithreaded encryption is not possible with our stream-oriented, on-the-fly approach.\nI wouldn't say that. The encryption can be parallelized easily (split the buffers), but I'd guess the MAC is a problem unless you want to implement it manually.\n. A quickly threw together a rough test: \n- 64 KB buffer size\n- 128 bit key\n- x tasks per buffer -> common ForkJoinPool (parallelism: 4), joining before next iteration\n- 100000 buffers\nWith 1 task per buffer I was able to encrypt ~255 MB/s. I've read somewhere that the 128 bit throughput is approx 40% higher, so single core performance should be around 175MB/s with 256 bit. This means that a lot of things are not going optimally in cryptomator.\nWith 2 tasks per buffer I was able to encrypt ~475 MB/s. This is almost linear improvement.\n4/8 tasks per buffer yielded ~775 MB/s. About three times as fast as a single task.\n16 tasks: 680 MB/s, 32: 660 MB/s, and so on...\nI'd call that pretty efficient.\n. > spawning independent encryption tasks over multiple in-memory chunks is very different from encrypting a byte-stream received via http.\nOnly if you want it to be :)\n\nIf (and we don't now this) the bottleneck is really the plain AES computation, the next scheme will allow improvements, as the MAC is calculated on a chunk basis. But currently we're still working on race conditions during partial decryption.\n\nI don't think it is, especially not for small files and everything except very obvious and simple optimization should be delayed until the scheme is final.\nOne additional question for OP: are you running an anti-virus software, a third-party firewall, or is your windows firewall customized?\n. Meh, I could have found that out by myself :) http://ark.intel.com/products/41316/Intel-Core-i7-860-Processor-8M-Cache-2_80-GHz\nAlright, so without AES-NI (-XX:-UseAES -XX:-UseAESIntrinsics), I'm down to ~105MB/s single core. Your CPU should be a bit slower. Let's say yours does ~75 MB/s. With AES-NI, I see 60MB/s net encryption speed, which is less than a quarter of the naked encryption speed (~255 MB/s). So if you get ~18 MB/s, that's the right ball park.\nVeracrypt is probably a lot faster because everything around the encryption is integrated more tightly. There's probably room for improvement on our end, but WebDAV has some significant limitations. Especially Windows is not very good with it.\nThe AES-NI thing doesn't explain the horrid small-file performance. Can you check if turning off your security software has some effect on that?\n. Private, yes. I think final doesn't fit the symmetry between start and stop. Maybe FXThreads could somehow share it's own ExecutorService.\n. I just refactored that - done\n. I just refactored that - done\n. See above - done\n. That would be very annoying because there's no neat way to substring.\n. This seems to be the standard way.\n. neat.\n. Definitely.

I hope this kind of test is possible on the Travis servers.\n. done\n. done\n. done\n. done\n. done\n. done\n. done\n. done\n. So should I put my name at the top of the notice and leave the list of contributors as is?\n. What should I put after the dash? This is really complicated...\n. done\n. I tried that, but it didn't work at all. I think the best course of action is to leave this method here and possibly refine it if we want to allow a broader spectrum of names.\n.

If you don't distribute your jar with a bundled JRE, you don't violate the license, so i think.\nSee http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13414474/alternative-to-findbugs-defaultannotation-for-javax-annotation-for-fields-and-me/36198568#36198568\n. Ok.\nI currently saw, you distribute the installers including a Java runtime with JCE Unlimited Strength Policy. Am I wrong or is that already an Oracle BCL violation?\n. Great :D\n. ",
    "masvil": "+1 to encrease usability.\n. @markuskreusch can you point that discussion?\n. Same like @bohni here.\n. In my experience CryptSync is unstable, unreliable, unsafe. Furthermore is not cross-platform. Cryptomator is the only open-source convenient tool to locally encrypt cloud files.\nIf you want your local files to be Cryptomator-independent there are many backup tools able to mirror them to Cryptomator's virtual volumes, e.g. Cobian Backup (open source) and SyncBack (free version available). Comodo Backup didn't seem to work in my tests.\n. All of safe encryption tools have the rule \"if you lose your password no one can help\". It's normal! Why Cryptomator should do something different? It's a local, decentralized and no server-based encryption tool, so users should accept there is no way to recover password and data.\nIf someone feel like he can \"forget the password\" then something like Viivo is a better solution. We know high level security tools are not for \"average users\" because of complexity, let's accept it.\n. I see the point is \"driving\" average users to be safe. It makes sense from an \"educational\" point of view. If so I think the explanation should be VERY plain and straight and showed every time a new vault is created. Maybe something like:\n\"We suggest to use a password manager like Keepass (just to name an open source), so you can use a good password without any risk to forget or lose it. If you don't want to do it for any reason then we strongly recommend to push here now to generate a recover key you can store in a safe place. You can use it in the future to recover your files if you forget or lose your password.\"\n. @SecTec I agree with your reasoning, but developers think like average users act in the real world, not what they should do. I still think \"average users\" will never use Cryptomator, but I am ready to change my mind.\n@MuscleRumble 's explanation is clear: \n\nWe're talking here about ideal cases, but this isn't how most people treat their passwords. In an ideal case, you wouldn't need a recovery code, because you treat your password like something that will never be forgotten (e.g. stored in a password manager or somewhere else).\nWhen we're talking about the average case (and yes, this has already happened(!) with Cryptomator users), you think of a password, maybe even a completely new one, because you don't want to use the same password over and over again. You just type it once and it'll be in your short-term memory. After a while, you'll forget it. That's the current workflow and this is something that we have to prevent, because it's already happening as I said.\nThat's why a recovery code has a different purpose. A recovery code should be long enough so that it doesn't weaken security, but also isn't something that a person has to remember (like a password... in the average case a password is used as something that can be remembered).\n. And/or an automatic check at regular interval.\n. Similar problem with Total Commander portable: if executed inside a vault it can't connect to FTP because can't find a dll.. Now I see the #78 issue describing the problem with other portable apps too. So apparently there is no way to fix/improve, right?. \n",
    "RiseT": "This feature is really important for many users. Even a not-so-secure solution would do for now imho (you could add a warning message, though), as some dev correctly pointed out that Cryptomator is about cloud encryption. If your system is compromised, your security is lost anyway.\n. Dumb question: where exactly is Windows' keychain located?\n. @markuskreusch @overheadhunter \nI've never had heard of Chocolatey before, but looked into it and I think I've become a fan.\nOne thing. While I'm surely no expert in Cocolatey and its related scripts, it seems to me that you could do one single thing in order to save a future Chocolatey (or packet managers in general) script author a lot of work.\nThere seem to be scripts that have to get managed on a continuous basis, and that's because the (changing) file name within the download URL has to get adjusted for each new version of the application.\nAnd there seem to be other scripts, authored a long time ago, that still work without any adjustments as the application's file name and thus download URL doesn't change.\nSo I guess it would help if you could provide some (additional) download URL for Cryptomator with a static file name, e. g.:\n- Cryptomator-latest-x64.exe (vs. Cryptomator-x.x.x-x64.exe)\n- Cryptomator-latest-x86.exe (vs. Cryptomator-x.x.x-x86.exe)\nJust a thought. Before doing anything, you might want to verify this with someone who does know more about Chocolatey scripts than I do, though.\n. Confirmed on Windows 7 and 10 with Cryptomator 1.1.2, 64 bit.\nJust exiting and restarting Cryptomator is sufficient for forgetting the drive letter, you don't have to reboot the system.\nSteps:\n1. Start Cryptomator\n2. Select vault\n3. Select prefered drive letter\n4. Unlock vault\n5. Lock vault\n6. Exit Cryptomator\n7. Restart Cryptomator\n8. Select vault\nResult\n- Drive letter is on \"automatic\" again\nI've never seen that drive letters are remembered btw, so this is reproducible each & every time. I wasn't even aware that they are supposed to get stored.\n. I'd like to add: \nOptional vault auto-locking when...\n- the OS's lock screen comes up\n- system switches into Sleep or Hibernate mode\n. @overheadhunter Not 100 percent sure how you mean that, but I've tried the following:\n- Clients used: Cyberduck and CarotDAV\n- Server used: WebDAV server of box.com online storage\n- Transfered the mentioned files to box.com via each of the above clients.\n- The end result is the same as with Cryptomator.\n- Only difference is that Cyberduck doesn't even ask if the file should be overwritten. CarotDAV does.\nOne unrelated curious thing I've just experienced is that Cryptomator opened one of my vaults twice at the same time, i. e. it has been displayed as 2 separate drives in Windows Explorer (until locking). After unmounting/locking the vault in Cryptomator, there's still one instance left that I can still use. I'll leave it there until I shut down the computer tonight, so if this is of any interest to you, let me know. [Edit: Dang - too late. Somehow managed to accidentally quit the Cryptomator client, now the second instance is also gone. Sorry].\n. I see, thanks.\nOk, I've used the Cyberduck client as you described with the Cryptomator WebDAV drive. The result is an exact copy of the BoxCryptor drive. No file names have been changed and thus, no files are missing.\n. Side question: Would you generally recommend rather using a 3rd party WebDAV client (vs using Windows Explorer) for copying a huge number of files, e. g. when migrating from other virtual drives? Also, when doing that, I've noticed that Cyberduck per default changes the file permissions of the files uploaded. Is this recommended?\n. @overheadhunter Thanks. So should I close the issue as Windows Explorer seems to be the culprit of the problem?\n. Duplicate of #276 \n. Thanks!\nDo you happen to know how a synching client in general decides what is the \"latest state\" when a file exists on computer A, but doesn't on computer B...? (In the case of two different versions of the same file it's obviously simple - it's the file with the newer timestamp. But a deleted and thus non-existing file has no timestamp one could compare)\n. Just noticed that inside the opened vault (i. e. in the virtual drive), for each folder there's a file of 0 bytes size with the same name as the corresponding folder.\nShould I batch-delete all files with an appended \"\" in order to fix this?\n. @tobihagemann \nLet's clarify.\n1. Within the encrypted Cryptomator (root) folder, each file with a \"0\" prefix (= new vault format) now has a duplicate file with a \"\" suffix (= old vault format). The size (and probably content) of these duplicates is identical to the originals.\n2. Within the decrypted WebDAV drive, each folder has a corresponding file with the same file name as the folder name and 0 bytes of size. I guess the reason for these is the existence of the old \"\" suffixed files in the _encrypted folder which should have been deleted (but unfortunately got restored by MegaSync).\n. I would think that just searching the encrypted folder for files whose file name's last character is a \"_\" and deleting those files would do the job. No?\n. Don't worry. I still have the contents of the original vault in a separate, unencrypted folder and I've only changed a couple of files within the vault afterwards. I can create a completely new vault and copy all that stuff into it.\nBut it would be great if you could find some solution for such cases if there is no backup available.\n. For your info:\nWhen I look into the encrypted folder, I still see file pairs like these:\n0NBGDLZYF4OKV4T4U4TBR5E4NGDCDVIU4OYSKCSB4QGNQRHA=\nNBGDLZYF4OKV4T4U4TBR5E4NGDCDVIU4OYSKCSB4QGNQRHA=_\nSo it hasn't been renamed to\nNBGDLZYF4OKV4T4U4TBR5E4NGDCDVIU4OYSKCSB4QGNQRHA=\nby the sync conflict resolver. When exactly does it do its resolving? Do I first have to access a specific folder within the virtual drive to trigger the conflict resolving of that folder?\n. In the light of file system integrity, do you think it would make sense to somehow encode the vault version in the file & folder names (or as some header within encrypted files themselves - which couldn't be done with folders, though) of the encrypted folder? This could get checked e. g. when migrating or manually by clicking some \"Integrity Check\" button in order to find out if there are files or folders that don't belong there (files/folders from old vault vault versions or other random - non-Cryptomator - files/folders). Just a quick thought - don't know if that really would make sense.\n. Sounds good to me. I fully agree with the points you've brought up.\nOne additional thing to (possibly) keep in mind:\nWhile I'm personally a big fan of file name encryption, I've seen in some issue here that there are people who would prefer being able to switch file name encryption off. But if you have no file name encryption, i. e. keep the original file names, you most likely cannot encode any additional info into the file name (some pre- or suffix to the original file name could do, though. If the resulting file name doesn't get too long, that is). But I don't know if switching off file name encryption fits into Cryptomator's concept anyway.\n. @tobihagemann Anything new on that (encoding vault version into filenames)? I'm not asking when, I'm just asking if this is considered at all.\n. Thanks for the info! I completely understand that there are more important things to do right now. The only thing I've been waiting for is a separate issue for this - that is, if it's being considered - so it won't get lost in some closed issue ;-)\n. Oops. I'm sorry.\n. PS: I think it would be a good idea to display the assigned drive letter in Cryptomator's GUI. As soon as a vault is unlocked, there's no way to see the drive letter (at least none I can find).\nThe left side of the GUI with the vault list would be the best place for it imho, as there you can see all assigned drive letters in one glance without any GUI maneuvering.\n. Would it make sense to use the assigned drive letter as suffix to the vault name?\n. I'd like to point out the idea of encoding the vault version (or the extension of this idea portrayed by @tobihagemann in the original thread) within the (encrypted) file names as discussed in the original thread https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/304#issuecomment-231538394\nThis would ensure that\n- 3rd party files/folders and\n- files from old vault versions\ncould get recognized, identified and separated (and where necessary processed).\n. A great (read: hard) test for file systems is the (eBook) database of calibre btw.\nI have yet to see an (encrypted) virtual file system that works with calibre's database. BoxCryptor Classic (EncFS) and Cryptomator (WebDAV) do not.\n. Would this really be effective? An attacker could take Cryptomator's source code, modify it so the delay is set to effectively zero, and create their own build without any delays. Or even write their own brute force engine for Cryptomator vaults without using the Cryptomator application at all. Just asking - what do I know.\nBut you might do something like this:\nhttp://keepass.info/help/base/security.html#secdictprotect\nI think True-/VeraCrypt is doing something along these lines as well.\n. There's already a pretty perfect solution (at least in my book) for this problem, but implementing it could mean heavy architectural changes. Not sure about this, though. That solution is \"placeholder files\" or \"placeholder folders\":\nhttps://www.odrive.com/features/sync\n. While I fully agree with the points you've brought up, I wasn't really suggesting using odrive instead of Cryptomator. I'm suggesting the implementation of odrive-like placeholder files & folders into Cryptomator (if somehow possible) ;-)\n. I understand. That's why I said that it probably means heavy architectural changes to Cryptomator. I had a feeling this would be difficult to implement given Cryptomator's current architecture. Might be something one could keep in mind for the longer term, as it is a pretty decent solution for that problem.\nIn the meantime, the only thing I can come up with in order to solve the original problem is creating multiple Cryptomator vaults and sync only the ones one needs on a given device.\n. @FireUponSky Mh. Hadn't thought about this, but you could be right. At least for situations where you just need access to a couple of files.\n. > In the past there have been cases, where people locked up their Keepass keychain into a Cryptomator vault and used a Keepass-managed, generated passphrase for the vault, thus deadlocking the complete keychain after the next vault unmount.\nAlmost happened to me a long time ago. Would have been a desaster.\nFor extra security, I would instead recommend using a locally (!) stored key file in addition to the passphrase for KeePass when uploading the KeePass database into a cloud.\n. @tobihagemann Nope. Cannot reproduce anymore in the current version (I was able to consistently reproduce this with v1.1.4).\nI've noticed that step (7) is unnecessary now, as \"More options\" is still expanded after (6). Perhaps the code changes that cause this fixed this issue as well.. This should be rather simple. Inno Setup seems to have an [InstallDelete] section where you can specify any files and/or folders that should get deleted prior to installation. So you could just specify  \"{app}\\app\", \"{app}\\runtime\" and some of the files in the {app} folder (see the warning within the page below).\nhttp://www.jrsoftware.org/ishelp/topic_installdeletesection.htm\n. Actually, they only warn about wildcard deleting the the {app} folder itself, not its subfolders. This prevents the potential mess if the user chose an already existing folder as the {app} folder.\nSo if you moved the remaining Cryptomator files from {app} to a subfolder of {app}, you could just delete all these subfolders of {app}. It probably would help if these subfolders had unique names in order to make it unlikely that they already exist from some 3rd party application.\nOk, this wouldn't take care of someone putting their stuff into one of these newly created subfolders after the initial installation. But I still hope there is intelligent life on earth...\nOr - even simpler - you could just use something like {app}\\Cryptomator\\..., which would normally become Cryptomator\\Cryptomator\\.... So even if someone chose \"Windows\" as {app}, you still would have your (unique) \"Cryptomator\" folder as a subfolder of \"Windows\".\n. I don't really think that message is ambiguous as it's just about making sure that synchronization has been completed. Although I wonder if that means it was best to shut down, i. e. exit the sync client completely prior to migrating (so ok, in this regard the message might be ambiguous).\nThat said, I now always do a manual backup of the vault prior to migrating. One could automate this process in the sense that Cryptomator could ask the user if they want to do a vault backup prior to migrating.\nThat backup's locatation shouldn't be in the synched folder, though, as this could lead to storage space issues in the cloud (aside from the fact that synching could last a rather long time if the vault backup is big enough).\nSo Cryptomator could ask the user _if they want to do a backup, and if yes, _where to store that backup.\n. There might be situations in which Cryptomator just isn't aware that something went wrong with the migration and/or synching of the migrated vault.\n. @sth2258 Then I don't understand the initial post. You're at first refering to the existing message regarding completed synching, but then you suggest that this message should be changed to \"ensure a backup is taken prior to executing this migration\". These are two completely different things in my mind. Could you clarify?\nEdit: As far as I understand this, that message about completed synching exists in order to prevent the sync client messing up the migration process by downloading new files (in the old vault format) while the migration process is going on.\n. So your first point is about using Cryptomator without any cloud synchronization?\nImho, encryption of cloud-sychronized data is all that Cryptomator is about. But probably you could use it without cloud synchronization as well. I'd prefer VeraCrypt (successor of TrueCrypt) for the latter case, though.\n. Where do the decrypted files in the vault get their modification & creation date from? Directly from the encrypted files, i. e. the ones stored in the cloud?\n. I understand, thanks.\nSo I guess this could have been prevented if I had copied the vault's decrypted files to some other place, deleted the vault's content, migrated the vault, and copied the files back after migrating (or just used a freshly created vault in the first place)?\n. Yes, Windows' WebDAV client preserves the original modification date.\nI've done a backup before migrating, so I have to check if I still have that and find out what files I've added afterwards. Then I could put all that in a new vault with the new format.\n. PS: You might want to add a warning regarding changed modification dates if a new Cryptomator version needs that sort of migration (when editing the files). You could suggest that the user creates a new vault in order to prevent resetting modification dates (mh, doesn't make sense on macOS, though, because of the issue you've mentioned...)\n. Yay! I still have that backup I've made before migrating to 1.2.0. But it's the encrypted vault.\nI guess I have to use 1.1.4 in order to open that vault without initiating the migration process, correct?\nIf yes, do you think I can use the jar file\nhttps://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/download/1.1.4/Cryptomator-1.1.4.jar\nfor opening that vault without uninstalling 1.2.0 first?\nThanks in advance.\n. @tobihagemann \n\nHowever, your observation on the creation date sounds strange. I've got the feeling that it's another \"display error\" of the WebDAV client that comes with Windows Explorer, but I'm just speculating here. The creation dates are untouched on macOS, so it's nothing that Cryptomator deliberately changes.\n\nI've opened the vault in the carotDAV client. Same result - the creation dates are off as well.\nWhile all modification dates are 2016-09-21, there are 2 variations for the creation dates:\n- Either the creation date is 2016-09-21 as well, but the time is a couple of hours (widely varies, never the same) after the modification date, or\n- the creation date is 2016-09-02. In this case, the time is always roughly the same, i. e. might vary a couple of seconds or even a few minutes. I have no idea where this date is coming from.\nRather strange.\nEdit: Perhaps the creation date has been set by MegaSync? I've had MegaSync closed during the migration process, so the synching could have happened a couple of hours later. Just an idea. This still doesn't explain the cases with the earlier date, 2016-09-02, though (most of these files were created years ago).\n. And I have one more - long standing - question:\nDo you happen to know if sync clients in general hash the files' contents?\nWhat happens if you replace a file with another one with exactly the same name and the same modification time & date? Will the sync client know that this is a different file?\nThanks in advance!\n. Btw - I've just run the .jar file without installing the JCE files first (as a test). Do you think it's possible to add a descriptive error message for that case? When trying to open a vault without installed JCE files, Cryptomator pretty much does nothing.\n. I've found the reason why the creation dates had changed: I've copied the vault files...\nNormal copying via Windows Explorer retains the modification date but changes the creation date (stupid me).\nFor what it's worth, Windows' own command line tool robocopy - when using the /mir switch - is able to copy or move folder & file structures while retaining both the modification and the creation date:\nhttps://www.petri.com/copy-files-preserve-timestamp\n. Imho, at least for the vaults list, symbols like e. g. an open and a closed padlock would be the best alternative. That way, the colors could stay the way they are (or additionally colored differently if so desired).\nBtw, it recently happened to me once that the vault was unlocked, but the symbol color said otherwise - it was red. I've made a screenshot, but cannot purposefully reproduce at this time, though.\n. Don't know much about these things, but accidentally stumbled across Color Oracle, if this is helpful.\n. @overheadhunter Interestingly, this does only happen with some of my Excel files.\nTrying to find a common denominator, this seems to be dependent on path length. I've moved one of these files a couple of levels up in the (vault) folder hierarchy, and there it's getting opened without any problems.\nEdit: I think with a deeper folder hierarchy, i. e. when the described symptoms hit, it cannot access the file at all. \"Recent Files\" in Excel then only displays a part of the path. When I click on this \"recent file\" (with the truncated path) in order to open it, the issue is there.\nI don't know yet if the absolute number of characters or the degree of folder nesting is the culprit, though.. @MP1902 Thanks for the info. I hadn't noticed this without Cryptomator (does just the drive letter of a vault count or the full \"\\\\localhost@...\" stuff?) \nAnd do you know if this changed with newer versions of Office?. Sure. You should remove the \"stale\" tag in that other one, though ;-). @overheadhunter Is this really a duplicate?\n375 is about the ability of unlocking vaults if the underlying, unencrypted folder has read-only permissions.\nOn the other hand, this feature request is about implementing an option into Cryptomator's GUI in order to open a vault and - voluntarily - withdraw the ability to write into that virtual drive (in order to not change anything accidentally).\nThis has nothing to do with the permissions of the underlying unencrypted folder.\nThis would be somewhat analogous to read-only mode in MS Word.. Not sure if this is good news, bad news or something in between, but rebooting the computer (vs hibernation mode) did the trick (sorry, should have tried this before). WebDAV working again. Should we close the issue?\nPS: Is it possible that a reboot after updating Cryptomator is generally necessary?\nBtw, while it didn't work, I've tried opening the vault both directly after updating Cryptomator and after going into & leaving hibernation. I guess that means that updating Cryptomator to v1.4.6 messed something up, which was fixed only by rebooting Windows.. ",

I've also opened an issue about it on the KDE bug tracker: https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=365356 . And also one for it not being added to the list of network drives: https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=365357\n. @overheadhunter While you don't find a solution, you could add a dropdown menu for users to pick Nautilus or Dolphin.\n. Feedback from David Faure on my request to support dav://:\n\n1) Supporting dav and webdav equally (without redirect) is feasible, but with some mess in kio_http's code \n(e.g. there are quite some if (m_protocol == \"webdav\" || m_protocol == \"webdavs\") around, although this could certainly be factorized)\n2) The problem is we don't really have the concept of \"aliases\" for protocols, apart from the KProtocolManager::slaveProtocol mechanism, not sure it still works (FTP handled by HTTP proxies is a rather old concept afaik, so this has probably been untested for a while). \n3) One could write a kio_dav ioslave that redirects stat(), listDir(), get() and put() to webdav (there's probably more?). \nAh, either with actual redirection, or using ForwardingSlaveBase (i.e. internal delegation). \nIn any case I don't have enough motivation (nor even a webdav account) to do this myself, but I'll be happy to review a patch;-)\n. @overheadhunter Thank you for your hard work on this. Let's hope that KDE/Qt and Gnome/GTK are going to work together to solve such incompatibilities. \n. Done.. \n",

    "markuskreusch": "Extracted the save password feature into issue #422. #422 is required to add this feature for linux.. We could at least make the window resizable. Will look into that in the future.\n. A thought regarding my previous comment: Resizing the window would not help. The ui elements (icons, borders, text, etc.) would still be small and just contain more empty space. I think we really have to wait until this is fixed in JavaFX.. A portable version can not rely on FUSE / Dokany beeing installed so after #252 and #207  we will need to allow a \"WebDAV mode\" or the user has to install dokany / fuse to allow usage of a portable version.\n. We have to evaluate performance after switching away from webdav. As long as we use WebDAV this is a bottleneck anyways.\n. The performance you report is ok regarding my experience. To rule out that WebDAV is the limiting factor here you could try a tool like Cyberduck, connect to the local Cryptomator WebDAV-Server (you can copy the URL when clicking on the arror next to \"Unlock\") to place large files in the vault. Using this approach I got peak encryption speeds of 140MiB/s with a single file of around 400 MiB.\n\n. @hudcap should have mentioned that: have an i7-4700HQ, so definitely more powerful. Details about rsync performance are described in #451 .. It seems like Windows still leaves files in this directory. A user reported that files remain there on Windows 10 (no hotfix available there). On a patched Win 7 machine the files seem to be cleaned but some really old files where still in there on my machine.\nA short test showed that manual deletion (using java) of the files in the Tfs_DAV directory works (although it is a system directory). Maybe we should delete all files in there after locking a vault or before closing Cryptomator. Side effects on running WebDAV connections need to be checked.. @overheadhunter tested office using the dokany mirror sample without problems so should be solved by #207 \n. Tested with some image files (including very large ones) on linux and didn't have problems opening them. CPU usage was a little high but this is already adressen in #129. Closing this because problems with images can not be reproduced.\n. There are several reasons that WebDAV has been choosen as protocol:\n\nWebDAV can be used on more or less any system without specific adaptions. This reduces the complexity of the overall product. This reduces the efforts for changes and maintenance, which is vital for open source products.\nWebDAV shares are mountable without a deep system integration. So using the Software without Administrative rights is possible.\n\nI understand, that the problems seem pretty bad if you wan't to use large files or have small space on drice C available. However this does not affect that many users. The usage of an external WebDAV client is possible to circumvent this limitations. We are working on an improvement (see #207 / #252) but due to the system specific nature of a direct file system integration this process takes some time.. Retested and not reproducible using the current version. Took the relevant file and encrypted / decrypted 2000 copies without any corruption.\n. This could be affected by #252 and #207 because we might no longer (be able to) mount as a \"drive\" in this case. We have to check this.\n. It seems that we can not do anything here because the problems with entering the chineese characters is a problem in the JDK.\n. @andirapandi \nI remember we already discussed the problem of identifying an encrypted file to reset it to a previous version. We discussed a solution which would allow to determine the encrypted filename of a decrypted file. Not sure if we have an issue for this yet. Will come back to you...\n. We have to evaulate the impact of #252 / #207 to this. I assume when mounting to a directory in the users home directory this should be solved.\n. In my opinion this is no longer relevant. If someone wants to setup a package he can do but I think we will not track this here in the future and will not do it.\n. Will think about this. Shouldn't be to hard.\n. @overheadhunter Please retest this issue and document required work.\n. Suggested fix\nAt the moment the filename is not added to the file header MAC. It would be possible and would solve the problem that contents from any file can be moved ot any other file within the same directory without causing authentication errors.\nAdding the filename to the MAC would cause performance and bandwidth issues on mobile devices because the full file has to be retrieved and rewritten to change the header when a file is renamed. To prevent this the authentication information, maybe the full header, can be moved to a metadata file which is placed alongside the file containing the encrypted data. This would allow mobile devices to only read and rewrite a small file instead of the full data. On the other hand that would cause problems if those files would not be synced correctly - currently only the complete file can be synced at once. If authentication data and file contents are split into two files this is no longer true. The application could (sometimes) not tell if data is unauthentic or synchronisation has not finished. Because having many authentication errors of this sort would mean that user get scared we have to think this through a little more.\n. We should unmount drives before existing cryptomator.\n. Ok then if we detect that we can not unmount drives we should:\n- Display a message to the user stating that files are currently used\n- Optional Letting him choose to force unmount (if nothing is read/written at the moment) or leave cryptomator running\n. Checked this with the new version and could not find any problems with folders that have names > 10 characters and many files inside.\n. A short analysis of the memory consumption on linux (not tested on Ubuntu but on Debian, I assume the results should be similar) shows that a Cryptomator process that has been started and unlocked a vault needs around 210MB RAM1. This value increases while decrypting / encrypting files and using vaults but may go back to this value if Cryptomator is idle for some time. The system may report more memory consumption because memory not needed anymore is not released immediately if the overall system memory is big enough.\n1 Note that this 210MB includes RAM which is shared with other processes (libraries and such stuff). This shared RAM is around 20MB on my system. Because Cryptomator comes with an included Java installation some memory which could be shared is not shared with other java processes. Due to security reasons we do not recommend this but if you really need to decrease memory consumption you could download Cryptomator as jar-file and launch it using your systems JVM. This decreased memory consumption by around 30MB on my system assuming you have other java processes running.\n. I agree it is much memory for a process which is idle. At the moment we have no options which would drastically reduce memory comsumption. If we have the chance of reducing memory consumption in the future we will think about it.\n. I have some more questions concerning your report:\n- When you say the filesystem becomes unresponsive does this apply to all operations or only to writing files into it (so saving, moving or copying files)?\n- Did cryptomator display an error message or did it just \"freeze\" and you got the only error notification from the logfile?\n- I think at least reading the file system should be possilbe without problems. Can you still read the data without problems if you start a fresh instance of cryptomator and never try to write to the vault?\n- Did you store the vault on your local drive or did you use dropbox or similar?\nThere is not much we can do if you do not have space left on your device. We may improve error reporting in this case and should provide a way to still read the data but writing will of course not be possible unless space on the device becomes available.\n. Ok I see so as mentioned before if there is not space left there is nothing we can do to sucessfully write the data. However, we should delete the temporary files if we detect an error. This will be adressed in a future version.\n. Did copying of the file complete? In general you should be able to access other files on the drive even while encryption is in progress. Due to the strange progress behaviour stating 50% from the start I guess the problem may rather be the file browser instead of cryptomator. Especially that the webdav process uses up a core seems strange. The process seems to be spawned by your file manager, should be doing IO operations and thus should not need that much CPU time.\nI will try to verify that. Just tested with a testfile (2GB of 0-Bytes) and didn't have any of the problems described. I tested on Debian and want to do it again on Linux Mint. Can you tell us which file manager you used?\n. Have seen some other gvfsd-dav related problems.\nAs a workaround you may try mounting the vault using davfs2. If you try this and it works I would be happy to hear about it.\n. @overheadhunter Which actions should we do to finish this task?\n. Closed because no response scince 3 Feb and because we could not reproduce this with the information we actually have.\n. @overheadhunter I tried to create some xlsx and docx files using Microsoft Word 2007 and did not have any problems. Are the problems releated to a specific version of Word? I also played around with the documents, renamed, moved, copied them around etc. No problems at all. Everythin just worked fine.\n. I could narrow down this issue to the way we build the Cryptomator jar file. At the moment logging will not work using the jar directly.\n. Maybe we could introduce an option for auto-close. I think some users might want this behaviour, others might not.\n. Partially implemented: Tray notification is only showed the first times when closing Cryptomator.\n. I am sorry but I could not reproduce the problem on my local machine. Did you have anything else in your setup which could be considered \"special\" or did you really just copy from a local hard disk to a cryptomator vault which also resides on your local hard disk?\n. I checked this and could reproduce the problem with a 200MB files. It seems that sometimes ls is fast and sometimes it takes really long.\nI debugged the HTTP traffic and it seems that a PROPFIND request issued against cryptomator causes the full file to be decrypted. That indeed should not happen and we will investigate further to fix this.\nlogoutput.txt\n. Retested on master branch after merge of modifications to how we access the filesystem. A get request for the file used in ls -l is issued leading to decryption and sending to client. This seems to be a problem with cygwin / the webdav implementation of windows.\nA request is not issued on every invocation of ls -l but cygwin or windows seems to cache the information for some while. When retrying after some minutes the full file is retrieved again.\n\n2016-02-26 14:35:28,790 DEBUG [Server:506] REQUEST on HttpChannelOverHttp@1393233{r=8,c=false,a=DISPATCHED,uri=/test/foo.zip}\nGET //localhost:54753/test/foo.zip\nCache-Control: no-cache\nConnection: keep-alive\nPragma: no-cache\nUser-Agent: Microsoft-WebDAV-MiniRedir/6.1.7601\ntranslate: f\nHost: localhost:54753\n2016-02-26 14:35:29,072 DEBUG [Server:520] RESPONSE for /test/foo.zip h=true\n200 null\nDate: Fri, 26 Feb 2016 13:35:28 GMT\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\nLast-Modified: Fri, 26 Feb 2016 13:30:07 GMT\nContent-Length: 14621547\n. I did some further investigation and it seems that there is nothing we can do to avoid that the additional GET request is performed. It should not be required to run ls -l but is done by windows and leads to cygwin waiting for the full file to get decrypted which obviously is slow for larger files.\n\nUsing wireshark I could identify that the problem is not limited to cryptomator and not limited to cygwin. When a properties dialog of a file on a webdav share is opened in windows explorer a GET request is performed as well.\nAt the moment this issue can not be fixed but we may implement another way to provide a file system on windows in the future. Thus this issue will stay open. As an alternative we may be able to analyze in detail how windows accesses a webdav share and find a way to prevent those additional GET requests.\n. Closing in favor of #223 \n. Actually we already have issue #88 which would provide means to set the url and path of the vault leading to a fixed mount point. We intend to fix #88 until mid of march.\nI closed this and marked as a duplicate. If #88 does not exactly describe what you mean or you have further comments please add them to #88.\n. Closed due to inactivity. If anybody who has this problem replies to this here we may reopen it.\n. If comparing Cryptomator with VeraCrypt you definitely will notice a difference in speed. Cryptomator currently uses a local WebDAV server to supply the virtual drive. This decision has been taken in the early stage to allow usage on all operating systems without having to write integrations for providing a native file system on all of them. We are planning to do this and will allow to use dokany on windows (#207).\nI believe performance problems come from WebDAV and not from the encryption itself. We can not do much to increase WebDAV performance - it depends on the OS and how it handles and caches stuff.. Oh and an additional thing you can do if you are not happy with performance:\nWhen copying large directory trees with plenty of relatively small files (around several KB) the speed is REALLY slow when using Windows Explorer. You can speed up such copy operations by using a thrid party webdav client like Cyberduck. The webdav URL can be copied from within Cryptomator right to the unlock button.. Maybe a floating point rounding problem or similar. Could be fixed by checking negative values and set to zero instead. Fixing the root cause maybe better.\n. This problem occurs sometimes when empty files are read.\n. @fridaynext Your problem regarding rsync seems to be unrelated to the issue of username/password. Could you have a look at #323 ? No ETA for fuse yet.. We should add an information dialog to Cryptomator which pops up if no more random data is available and instruct the user to install whatever package provides a secure CSPRNG source.\n. The problem with 1.0.0 is that we request more random numbers from the system than we did in 0.10.0. This seems to cause problems on some linux installations because the random number generator does not provide enough values.\nWe are currently discussing a solution (see #178). Scheduled for 1.0.1.\n. I will try to reproduce this issue on elementaryOS. If i have further questions regarding the system setup I will come back to you.\n. Suggestion\nJava tray icons are not supported very well in linux systems. Thus we might no longer use the tray icon mechanism on linux and just minimize the application instead.\n. No longer using tray icon on linux systems.\nIf you want to quit the application on linux this will only work when all vaults are locked. If vaults are unlocked Cryptomator will be minimized.\n. This seems to be related to #265 but not here. Moved the comment there.\n. In general the JVM shipped with the dmg-file or other installers should work well. Not sure why this problem occurs. Seems like the application has been launched using an external JVM but according to the OP this was not the case. Seems to affect only this one user.\n@johan1754 Do you still have problems using Cryptomator or is it working with the current version?\n. In general the JVM shipped with the dmg-file or other installers should work well. Not sure why this problem occurs. Seems like the application has been launched using an external JVM but according to the OP this was not the case. Seems to affect only this one user. Asked in #179 if there are any problems left now.\n. We may pass through the lock state to the actual files to allow network drives which sync this status as well to work as expected. Nevertheless we have to investigate if and how\n- the locks are obtained by windows / other OSes through our webdav client\n- we can not only write a lock to the underlying file system but also synchronize the lock (a webdav lock is more complex than a simple file lock and thus may require additional work to be done)\nSo at the moment it is not clear if we will and can implement the described locking mechanism.\n. When switching to another filesystem adapter as described in #207 solving this maybe easier.\n. Closed due to inactivity. If anybody who has this problem replies to this here we may reopen it.\n. Closed due to inactivity. If anybody who has this problem replies to this here we may reopen it.\n. This seems to be related to the WebDAV implementation on windows. Windows sometimes reads the full file to get attributes like file size etc. (see #145). At the moment nothing we can do but in general solvable by switching to an alternative file system integration (see #207).\n. This is a problem already reported in #164.\n. Closed in favor of #252 \n. I tried to reproduce your issue using putty.exe (a standalone exe-File known to not have other dependencies) and it worked well on my windows 7 x64 machine. Because you mentioned the behaviour is unpredictable I will try again several times later.\nIn addition I have the following questions:\nCan you tell us which files / programms cause problems for you? Maybe one which is freely available to allow us to test with that?\nIn addtion information about the windows version you used, your antivirus solution and the location of your vault (e.g. inside the dropbox folder, on a network share, on a usb stick) could be helpful.\nTo get the windows version you can launch the programm cmd and enter \"systeminfo\". The system name and version will be printed somewhere at the top.\n. I could reproduce your issue using the RSA-Tools exe-File. Interesstingly this does not happen with other exe files so seems to be something specific to the used file.\nI could identify the following (really strange) behaviour:\n- when checking the file integrity with cygwin using sha1sum the file in the vault is found and shows the same hash as the original exe-file outside the vault\n- when copying the file using ctrl + c/v or drag+drop the described problem occurs\n- after remounting the vault with another drive letter the exe file could be used as usual\n- after remounting the vault with the original drive letter (set by selecting the automatic option) serveral times the file shows another icon and launching works but not always after remounting\nThe overall behavior seems unpredictable and unstable as described already. I assume it is an upstream bug concerning windows explorer or similar because file access using the terminal works pretty well. Further investigation maybe done by debugging the webdav requests and trying other plain webdav shares.\nAs a workaround I recommend to place your exe-File into a zip-Archive and extract that to a location outside of the vault to allow access to your exe-file. I know this is not a very handy solution but all I can recommend right now.\n. Created a vault placed a single file in foo/putty.exe and tried DIR and ROBOCOPY. Worked well.\nCan you explain your problem a little more? What exactly do you place inside of the vault. How do you run the commands and what error messages / unexpected behaviour do you observe?\n. Closing in favor of #252 and #207 \n. @Feranor: yes this may solve #80 \n. @evulhotdog \nTo switch to dokany we need to reimplement the full WebDav logic to provide a Dokany (acutally DokanFuse) implementation in java. Process is ongoing but we still have work left to do.\n. @wezeku \nWe do not intend to use Dokan but Dokany. Dokan is discontinued and incomplete and has mentioned limitiations. Dokany does not have such problems. Just to be sure I tried the things you mentioned and succeeded in running an exe file and creating and commiting to a git repo.\nWhat exactly do you mean by \"JNI/CNI be used instead of a Java reimplementation\". We will definitely need to implement a dokan or fuse (see below) file system and can not just reuse our webdav implementation. What we intend to do is:\n- Implement a fuse filesystem using java\n- Use fuse-jna to link this implementation to fuse.\n- Dokany provides dokanfuse.dll which is a fuse implementation for windows. For mac and linux fuse is available anyway.\n- We currently do some prototyping to determine if using dokanfuse on windows will do.\n- Otherwise we may introduce a jna layer to link to dokan.dll directly. This will lead to two file system implementations in java: a dokan file system for windows and a fuse implementation for linux / mac.\n- Performance loss through JNA should not be a big problem because the io underneath is \"slow\" anyway. If it turns out JNA slows us down too much JNI is always an alternative (but more work to be done, thus trying JNA first).\n. Current Status\nI finished an implementation of a dokanfuse mountable drive today. Current implementation acts as a prototype but is clean enough to be used in Cryptomator if it turns out it works as expected.\nWork left to be done:\n- integrate crypto code into this\n- integrate the dokany / fuse drive into cryptomator\n- adjust windows installer to install dokany (solve some problems, e.g. when other applications use another dokany version)\n- analyse / fix some problems (e.g. BSODs somewhat related to dokany but also some performance related stuff)\nEspecially the last two points could lead to some delay or force us to link to dokany in another way (at the moment we use fuse-jna to link to dokanfuse.dll, maybe we will have to link to dokan.dll directly).\nCommits go to feature/fuse.\n. @wezeku Thanks for the link. Will look into it and check for similar problems and ways to work around them when we have a vertical prototype which allows testing this.\n. Yes that is correct. Scince version 1.0.0 we will offer some way of automatic migration as soon as changes to the storage format require this.\n. Hello Paul256,\nCan you tell us the still working version you used before?\nIn addition you may try to check/uncheck the IPv6 option in the settings dialog (reachable using the litte gear symbol). Maybe that is all you need to do.\nThis seems to be related to issue #151.\n. Closing this because this problem seems to be solved for the OP and is related to iCloud sync behaviour and not Cryptomator.\n. @Didix57 We currently do not know exactly when #207 will be ready.\nHard- and softlinks are not planned to be supported for now. If it is easy to do and some users really need this we may think about it.. Cryptomator does two things involving network connections:\n1. On application start we download http://updates.cryptomator.org/latestVersion.json to check if an update is available.\n2. Cryptomator launches a WebDav-Server (on your local computer) and connects to it when unlocking and connecting to a vault. Windows seems to not distinguish this connections from internet connections and thus shows the security alert. Cryptomator does not connect to the internet in this case. This is the reason that it also works when the permission is denied.\n. @dns90 \nDoes this only occur when using .exe-files or do you have problems with other filetypes as well? We have an issue #203 regarding drag'n'drop and copy/paste of .exe-files but the error dialog stating that the file wasn't available altough it is displayed is the same so your problem may have the same cause.\n. Ok in this case this seems to have the same cause as #203.\nThe problem here is that windows seems to handle exe files different than other files and something does not work well there. This rather seems to be a problem in windows than Cryptomator but because we had two issues concerning this during the last days I may look into this during the next week. Maybe there is something we can do to work around this.\nAt the moment I can only recommned to replace the file as you suggested or rename it (if that is possible) to delete it. Sorry for any inconvenience.\n. TODO: We could add a specific error message for this case to make clear to the user what he should do.\nWe mention \"Requires JRE 8 + JCE unlimited strength policy files\" below the jar download button but that can easyly be overlooked.\n. The log output looks like Cryptomator never tried to unlock and mount the vault. In general Cryptomator will show a hint below the unlock button when something goes wrong, nothing there?\nI could reproduce the same log output by trying to unlock a vault with a wrong password several times. In addition are you 100% sure the password is correct? Maybe there are differences due to a differing keyboard layout or maybe keyboard issues caused by the vm.\nIn addition did you check if a new vault placed on your local drive can be unlocked?\n. I guess KeePass may not privide the clipboard data in an \"acceptable\" DataFormat. Will check this.\n. Thanks for your report. We will look into this.\nI assume this is caused by the command in WindowsWebDavMounter.java:80:\n\nfinal Script proxyBypassScript = fromLines(\"reg add \\\"HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\\" /v \\\"ProxyOverride\\\" /d \\\";%DAV_HOST%;%DAV_HOST%:%DAV_PORT%\\\" /f\");\n  proxyBypassScript.addEnv(\"DAV_HOST\", uri.getHost());\n  proxyBypassScript.addEnv(\"DAV_PORT\", String.valueOf(uri.getPort()));\n  proxyBypassScript.execute();\n\nThis seems to overwrite the settings instead of adding an entry.\n. According to the log output the location has been successfully mounted (we did not get an error code from the mount command). The error message is displayed by Windows Explorer which sometimes has problems accessing webdav or other network shares.\nYou may try to:\n- temporarily disable your antivirus / firewall solution to check if it interferes with Cryptomator, if so you may reconfigure it to allow all connections from/to the virtual drives\n- go to the Cryptomator settings and check the IPv6 checkbox. This will use IPv6 for mounting which works better on some systems\nBecause the connection to the drives does not work well Windows may leave them connected when closing Cryptomator eventhough we try to remove them. You will have to manually remove them. You can do this by right-clicking \"Computer\" in Windows Explorer and selecting \"Netzlaufwerk trennen...\".\n. How did you get the /usr/run/id/gfvs/.. folder? I do not have it and cryptomator does not create it actively.\nWorkaround\nAs a test mounted the Cryptomtor vault using\nsudo mount -t davfs -o uid=username,gid=username http://localhost:port/vaultname /home/username/Cryptomator\nand rsynced a full eclipse installation (about 419MB in size, 5079 files). Had no problems but it took some time though but I assume this is caused by the webdav slowdown and overhead duo to many small files. Due to the amount of files in your folder I assume it will take some time for you to if at all working this way.\nPerformance should increase and it will work out of the box when #252 is implemented.\n. This issue is no longer active and thus closed.\nDetails about rsync and performance are described in #451.. At the moment we have no fix for this problem which adresses the root cause because we were not able to determine this for now. But #207 will prevent this problem because we will no longer need a loopback connection.\n. I think a more or less exact ETA is not possible at the moment. I documented the current status at #207.\n. A problem I see with this is that users might not expect the deleted files to reside in the recycle bin. Data stored in Cryptomator is somewhat sensitive and users could not want that non encrypted copies linger around in the trash. On the other hand if we would use an option in the settings dialog to enable that feature this would not be a problem.\nWorkaround\nA user can always move files to any location he likes by himself. So instead of deleting files a user who wants this behaviour now could just move the files. This is a workaround for now - I assume with Fuse / Dokany this will be solved.. Could reproduce the described Libre Office problems on Debian 8. Did not try reproduce the Thunderbird problems but assume problems exist there as well. Both programs seem to only get the dav:// url and can not handle these. No access to cryptomator is done in both cases. Attaching a file using evolution worked well.\nThe problems seems to be related on how the programs access the filesystem. Some seem to use some way which can read dav:// urls, others don't. This could be solvable by using a fuse frontend as described in #252\n. Checked this when mounting the vault manually into a custom folder using davfs2. Works without problems then.\nWorkaround\nInstall the package davfs2. Create a folder (e.g. in your home directory) to contian your vault and run:\nsudo mount -t davfs -o gid=<username>,uid=<username> http://localhost:<cryptomatorPort>/vaultName /home/<username>/<foldername>\nWhen asked for a User/Password just press enter. You should be able to see the cryptomator port in the file explorer. You can set a fixed port in the settings dialog in Cryptomator (requires restart of Cryptomator).\nWe could change the mount method if davfs2 is installed and make this the default.\n. Thanks four your report!\nMarking as duplicate because this has already been discussed in #40. You may look there for updates.\n. Thanks for your report. We already have filed issue #56 to show the window on left click (not double left click). If you have a specific reason to use a double click please comment there. In our option single click should be enough because it isn't used in another way yet.\n. Tested this on Windows 7 and could not find any problems there. At the moment I can not test on Windows Vista because I do not have a machine / VM with Vista available.\nDo you have a machine running at least Win7 and can you reproduce your problem there?\n. Retested with 1.2.0 and didn't have problems. If anybody can confirm this problem please report here.\n. Analayzed this and it turns out this problem maybe an upstream error in the JVM implementation. Will create a problem against the JRE and link it here.\nThe root cause of the problem is that a gvfs mounted WebDav share seems to be not writable by a Java application. This may apply to other mount scenarios too.\nTo be more specific a FileChannel or AsyncFileChannel can not be opened for writing for files located on such WebDav share. Eventhough ls -l confirms that the file / share is writable the following statements will always fail:\n- FileChannel.open(pathToFileOnGvfsMountedWebDavShare, StandardOpenOption.WRITE)\n- AsynchronousFileChannel.open(pathToFileOnGvfsMountedWebDavShare, StandardOpenOption.WRITE)\nA workaround is to mount the share using:\nmount -t davfs -o uid=username http://host:port/path /user/choosen/directory\nNote username is your username on your linux system in this case - not the username you use to login on the WebDAV server.\nUsing a WebDav share mounted using this command as location of the vault worked for me in my Debian 8 VM.\nIf you have similar problems and using Cryptomator <= 1.1.3 no error will be in the logfile. Starting with Cryptomator 1.1.4 you will get a message of the following form:\njava.nio.file.FileSystemException: /run/user/1000/gvfs/dav:host=localhost,port=46111,ssl=false,prefix=%2Ftest/test2/masterkey.cryptomator: Operation not supported\nwhich confirms you have exactly this problem.\n. Oracle confirmed the bug: http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=JDK-8162388\n. @hermann-san \nCan you try to add -o uid=username to your command? Had problems without this on my system too and want to rule that out as a reason of failure. username is your username on your linux system in this case - not the username you use to login on the WebDAV server.\nTo make it easier to find this issue we may add specific error messages to Cryptomator pointing to this issue.. Comment by @thiagoserra\n\nwhen i try run Cryptomator on Linux Mint 17.1 I get this error:\n./Cryptomator\n/opt/Cryptomator/Cryptomatorn/libpackager.so not found.\nMy JVM:\njava -version\njava version \"1.8.0_91\"\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_91-b14)\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.91-b14, mixed mode)\nbut in Cryptomator directory...\ntotal 668K\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4,0K Abr 29 20:58 app\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4,0K Abr 29 20:58 runtime\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 11K Mar 30 06:35 Cryptomator\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 230 Mar 30 06:35 Cryptomator.desktop\n-r--r--r-- 1 root root 46K Mar 30 06:35 Cryptomator.png\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 275 Mar 30 06:35 cryptomator.org-Cryptomator-MimeInfo.xml\n-r--r--r-- 1 root root 585K Mar 30 06:35 libpackager.so\n. As described by @overheadhunter this is a problem caused by the JDK javafx launcher and not Cryptomator directly. We will have to discuss how we can fix this.\n\nWorkaround\nFor now the workaround described by @vaulting can be used:\nCreate a directory \"/opt/Cryptomator/Cryptomatorn\" and copy the libpackager.so into it.\n. Will look into that and check if a quick solution is available. Nevertheless the way we mount the vault is very limited and thus it may not be possible to influence the displayed name at all.\nAs soon as #252 is implemented this will change.\n. Thank you for your report anyway.\n. Tested and confirmed the described behaviour. We can not fix this because Windows does not seem to URL encode the filenames correclty. The %20 from the filename remains unchanged in the URLs used to access the WebDAV vault. Instead it should be replaced by %2520. This is a problem in the windows WebDAV implementation.\nThis problem will be avoided by implementing  #207.\n. Closing in favour of #295 \n. This is a duplicate of #295. Thus this issue can be closed.. Just got the following message via support mail:\n\nSystem tray icon doesn't show up on KDE/Kubuntu which makes it difficult to quit the application.\nLSB Version:    core-9.20160110ubuntu0.2-amd64:core-9.20160110ubuntu0.2-noarch:printing-9.20160110ubuntu0.2-amd64:printing-9.20160110ubuntu0.2-no\narch:security-9.20160110ubuntu0.2-amd64:security-9.20160110ubuntu0.2-noarch\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS\nRelease:        16.04\nCodename:       xenial\nKDE Plasma Version: 5.6.5 \n\nI think for some users this is really anoying. A checkbox in the settings would solve it for users with this problem. In addition changed type to minor-bug due to the inability to close the application experienced by some users.\n. Hi theonlydoo,\nHow exactly did you measure the memory consumption? I am asking because when using some tools like top the value reported for a Java processes, will not reflect the actual memory the process uses, but the configured maximum memory of the JVM or other values which are to high. Details can be found in this statck overflow article.\n4GB is the maximum memory we configured so I really think the measurement done is incorrect. If cryptomator really uses so much memory feel free to reopen this ticket.\n. Ok I see, this seems to be a problem then. ;-)\nI will try to reproduce this in a VM using your setup. What exactly did you do to get this problem? Can you reproduce it using the same steps?\n. Ok... so seems to be something like a memory leak or similar when using the application for a longer time. Will come back to you when I have any results or further questions.\nIf you have problems again and can narrow down the problem please report here.\n. @theonlydoo \nTried to reproduce this but didn't have memory usage above 200 MB after running Cryptomator for 10 hours.\nCan you reproduce this? Would you be willing to make a memory sample using VisualVM if you have the problem again? This may help us identify where the memory is exactly used.\nThe memory sample does not contain any real data (so nothing about your system, password, key of your vault) but only the information about how much memory is used for which type of information. But if you want you can send the data pgp encrypted using our support address.\nIf you have further questions regarding this you may contact us at gitter. \n. The problems described here do not come from a \"real\" memory leak but are caused by high memory consumption due to the 1GB default heap size of our JVM.\nWorkaround\nTo prevent such large memory consumption a parameter can be added to Cryptomator.cfg as pointed out here.\n. @nostalgamos Hi! This seems to be issue #369 which is probably an upstream bug on linux. When limiting the memory using mentioned parameter the JVM should prevent such high memory usage. Will analyze a memory dump a user will create in #369 to see if we can do anything against this (maybe because we create more objects of some type than required) but because this seems to be an upstream bug this may not lead to usable results at all. Hopefully it will. Otherwise we may try to disable some UI features (because our assumption is, that this is somehow UI related) to track down which element causes problems on linux.. Closing this as the original problem seems to be related to pcmanfm and not Cryptomator.. @gwarah If you like you may post your results here.\n. Just got a bug report via E-Mail related to this:\nCopying a file containing a html-Encoded slash (%2F) leads to an error message because the Cryptomator WebDav server reports a conflict after a put request.\n. Workaround\nThis problem is caused by a wrong implementation of the WebDav client used by Windows Explorer. To use files containing HTML-Encoding (%..) you can use an alternative WebDav client like CyberDuck.\n. As described in #429 this also applies for the \";\" character.. @j-xella Even when doing this some really hard problems arise: For example a file where one part is synced to a newer state and others are still in old state can not be read completely by cryptomator (neither in the new nor in the old state) so when a users accesses such file he would see an error or similar that the file can not be accessed.\nIn addition cryptomator is not designed to overcome limitiations imposed by the unerlying cloud storage but is designed to encrypt the cloud storage.. I think you are right and this seems to be an issue with MegaSync and the best way to solve this would be let the MegaSync guys fix this.\nNevertheless we will think about possbile means to workaround this.\n. Don't believe it but we forgot to check for identical vault names for the mounted webdav location.\nWhen adding two vaults with the same name like C:\\Users\\markus\\test and C:\\Users\\markus\\directory\\test both end up with a WebDav url of http://localhost:42427/test. After mounting both vaults both virtual drives show the contents of the vault which was mounted first.\nShouldn't be hard to fix this, e.g. by appending a suffix to the webdav url.\n. Would make sense but we can not do that because when auto-assigned by windows we only know the drive letter after mounting.\nI am thinking of appending a counter to the mount location as soon as two vaults are added to the list. Problem with that is that the location of a specific vault could change if it is removed an readded doing this.\nAn alternative could be to not include the vault name in the webdav url at all but use a vault specific UUID or similar. Would lead to more complicated WebDav urls though but I am not sure if clean urls are really required.\n. Tobias and me discussed this an plan to solve it as follows:\n- When adding a vault to the list in cryptomator a vault specific UUID is generated\n- This UUID is stored in the settings and thus kept when restarting Cryptomator\n- The webdav url to mount a vault is now: http://localhost:42427/UUID/vaultname instead of http://localhost:42427/vaultname\nThis leads to unique urls per vault. Urls may change when removing and adding a vault but will never equal a url of another vault even an inactive or already removed vault (Which will also prevent mistakes when URLs to old vaults were stored in a third party webdav client or similar).\n. Workaround\nWhen you want to mount two vaults with an equal name you can click on \"More Options\" before unlocking and choose a custom and unique drive name.\n. First beta of an integrity check tool. Will be integrated in the main application on the long term.\nThe tool at the moment detects some known problems (upper-/lowercase problems, orphan files, missing equals signs in names) and in additon prints all unexpected files.\n@RiseT We think the idea of detecting 3rd party files/folders and files from old vault versions is good. We decided to not do this by using an encoded vault version in the filenames but we will check specific characteristics of the files to check if it is a cryptomator or 3rd party file.\nAt the moment we do for example check if directory files contain valid directory ids. Later on we may also verify the headers of encrypted files, authenticate file contents and so on.\nThe plan for the tool, once integrated in Cryptomator, is that it detects known problems (e.g. caused by migration while cloud synchronization hasn't finished)\nand allows to solve them. In additon any \"strange\" things in a vault will be reported and written to a file to allow us a deeper analysis of faulty vaults without requiring the users to execute commands in the terminal.\n. Will file a bug against openjdk anyway and report the issue id here as soon as available.\n. Our OpenJDK bug report has been rejected.\nBut I found a way to solve this using plain NIO: Before deleting, the readonly file attribute must be set to false using\nFiles.getFileAttributeView(path, DosFileAttributeView.class).setReadOnly(false);\nI'm not sure why this is only required on shared folders because the flag is set to true on all folders inside the Google Drive folder. Anyway, doing this prevents the AccessDeniedException.\n. Will fix this by doing the following:\n- Block all POST requests using a servlet Filter\n- Add a vault specific uuid (generated using a CSPRNG) to the webdav urls as planned for #308 anyway\nWe will not use username/password on the mounts because mounting using a username/password in the url does maybe not work well on all systems. Mounting a url without username/password works well.\n. @tobihagemann @overheadhunter Can anyone have a look at this and debug the webdav requests to check if the rsync command results in requests containing the correct timestamps? We should maybe check other webdav shares too.\n. @overheadhunter seems more like a concurrent file access issue or similar. JVM/Linux/Network drive bug prevented opening a Channel in WRITE mode. In this case we already have an open channel but can not truncate.\nI would suggest we try the scenario using cloud mounter. Maybe truncate is not implemented correctly there. Currently I assume this is an upstream bug.\n. Another problem regarding Amazon Cloud Drive is that we didn't (for now) get access to their SDK. So even if we would decide to sync ourselves it would not be possible to access Amazon Cloud Drive.. @dornathal If you have additional questions or got any feedback from the support forum please let us know.\n. @bernd1026 \nTook a day longer as promised but here it is: our integrity check tool in its first beta. Details on how to use it are documented in the github readme. Be aware that you need Java 8 and the JCE files as described there.\nAfter running you may attach the analysis result (*.vaultcheck.txt) here to let us have a look at it.\n. If you did migrate your vault and can now open it without errors, your files are displayed again and can be read/written everything is fine. The vault is fixed an nothing left to do.\nPossible scenarios which could have mixed up the masterkeys maybe that you accidentially did create a new vault (instead of opening the existing vault) on another computer in addition with problems during cloud sync which did not detect conflicts. Especially if the cloud synced while you renamed the masterkey to 1masterkey... this could have happend.\nWe will think about ways to make such errors detectable in the future.\n. Ok then. Fine it works now :+1: \nRegarding opening the existing vault:\nIt maybe that this is not a problem related directly to what you did. Fact is: Somehow another masterkey file with the same password replaced the original masterkey file. How this exactly happend is not certain. As mentioned may also be related to cloud sync problems or similar.\nChecked our code just to be sure. We do never overwrite masterkey files but display a  message if a vault is already initialized.\n. I think it is possible to tell the webdav frontend about ids of unmounted vaults. Will look into this.\n. @BrilleauxUK \nI think you may habe a problem which occurs occasionally after migration and maybe related to cloud synchronization or similar problems, some details are mentioned here #312.\nIf so your vault can be fixed. Could you attach your logfile to this ticket to allow us checking this? You may want to check if any sensitive information (paths / usernames) is in there. You can use our support system if you do not want to share your logfile here.\nRegarding the message complaing about a newer vault version: Yes that will disappear when you upgrade Cryptomator on your Win10 machine.\n. This problem is not actually a problem of cryptomator but a Windows issue. All webdav drives show as free space the space left on drive C.\nThis behaviour will change as soon as we implemented #207 because we do no longer use webdav then.\nThis has already been reported as #80 so closing this as duplicate.\n. Seems interesting and seems to solve some problems regarding dokany we already ran into.\nRegarding missing Java wrappers and the following statement from the author \"[...] but WinFsp needs a lot more testing.\" shows us that it might not be possible to use WinFsp in a production environment now.\nWill have a look at it anyway, thanks four your suggestion.\n. Could you send us the logfile to allow us checking if anything strange is going on on your system? Large folders may take some time but of course copying should finish. The logfile is located at %APPDATA%\\Cryptomator. Please open Cryptomator and let the copying process run until you have the problems described (slow Windows Explorer etc.). You may check the logfile for sensitive information (paths) before attaching it here or send it to us PGP encrypted.\nRegarding your own app I guess we can not help because we do not have any knowledge about it. If this app does interfere somehow with the vaults (e.g. locks files or similar) maybe this causes problems too. Did you try copying with your app not running?\n. Closed due to inactivity. If anybody who has this problem replies to this here we may reopen it.\n. We already have issue #284 where high memory usage problems and a possible solution have been discussed in detail. I suggest to try the described solution and come back to us if it does not work then.\n. I already noticed this and decided it is not a big problem because this does not affect many files. I had every version installed on my system and the overhead ist only 8 MB.\nNevertheless, we may change this in the future if it can be easily done using the installer script we currently use.\n. Ok thank you very much, didn't look into details yet.\nRegarding the warnings: Looks like this would require us to add all relevant files as a list instead of using {app}\\app etc. to prevent data loss in case of installation into an alread existing location.\nWe need a way we can automate this process because having to create a list of files to delete by hand would make the release process much more complicated. Will think about this.\n. @sth2258 \nYou are right regarding that users who do not use Cryptomator to sync with a cloud could be confused. We could display another message in this case but that is not that easy because we can not always detect if a vault is inside a directory synced with the cloud or not. So to keep the code simple and to save time we may not change the message for now.\nIn addition Cryptomator indeed is a solution for cloud storage encryption. We keep this in mind during the development process and when making decisions. Thus Cryptomator is optimized for the cloud and has some disatvantages when using it locally. Nevertheless it works fine locally I myself only do that for testing purposes.\n. @Altrec \nThis seems to be a different issue because the migration in general seems to be complete. Not sure why the headers of your files are invalid. Can you ensure that neither your cloud provider nor some of your applications messed with the encrypted files? And do the files you can not open show some sort of pattern?\nWe may be able to further assist you if you provide the sanitizer output to us. You may send it via email to our support address and PGP it if you like (key present on the page I linked).. fyi The problems described by Altrec could be solved using the newest version of our sanitizer.. @submarine89 \nThis seems to be an issue with some new native functions we use in Cryptomator 1.2.\nJust to be sure:\n-  Can you still use Cryptomator 1.1.4 without problems (by reinstalling it, creating a new vault, unlocking it etc.) or does it crash as well?\n- At which point exactly does Cryptomator crash? You said you could unlock and mount the vault. Does it crash immediately after mounting? What was the last thing you did and see regarding Cryptomator?\n- Can you attach (or send to our support address) the cryptomator logfile?\n. Thanks for the information.\nThe logfile does not contain anything helpful but that's what I expected cause this is an application crash. So I guess it really is caused by the new native code.\nScheduled this issue for the next patch. Our macOS guys are currently on vacation so they will get to analyze and fix this in october.\n. @Tchoupinax \nWe already have #182 where the problem with such files is discussed in detail.\n. When placing the vault directly inside a directory synced with the cloud no manual upload is required. But of course in this scenario we do not have a decrypted copy of the files, so if you need that there is a problem.\nCryptomator is and will be an encryption tool for cloud storage. We do currently not intend to add functionality which is more suited for a backup tool.\nIn the future we will add auto unlocking of vaults and there may follow ways to use crytomator on the command line. In addition the virtual drive will no longer be a webdav share but some more native way of providing the drive will be used.\nRegarding these changes it should be possilbe in the future to do what you want by combining cryptomator launched on startup with a third party sync/backup tool.\nI will keep this open to let others discuss.\n. Error 53 has already been reported in #210, #286 and #262 . We didn't find a fix yet but are working on #206 to solve this.\nIn addition we already have a support article regarding this issue.\nYou may look into the referenced tickets and the support article and try get it working.\nIf you are able to find the root cause of this issue (some system configuration, program or similar) please tell us. Any information is welcome because we could not reproduce this on our systems yet.\n. We are working on switching the way we provide the local drive is provided. This is documented in #207 and will solve the mentioned problem.\n. We had already another user who reported such high memory usage on Fedora.\nDetails on how to limit the memory used by the application are described in issue #284.\nStill not sure why memory consumption reaches multiple GB because in general the default limit should be around 1GB of RAM.\nIf that doesn't help, please come back to us.\n. Hi!\nJust some questions to narrow down the problem:\n- You mentioned the file was marked conflicted after you opened it. Does this really happen when opening the file or is this maybe a timing issue?\n- Can you confirm that you did not change the file? Was the file opened on Windows at the same time?\n- To narrow this down it would be helpfull to know the actual encrypted names of your files. Can you send us a recursive directory listing of the vault location? That alone may not help because Cryptmator renames conflicting files, so it will help to look into your cloud providers web interface and tell us the names of files recently deleted from the vault too.\n. To answer 3.: There is no way to do this using Cryptomator at the moment.\nMhm... ok.. strange behaviour. At the moment I think this maybe an ODrive issue because if it would be a Cryptomator issue this should happen on Windows and OSX. At least ODrive does not seem to handle files the same way on OSX / Windows.\nIf you want, you can reproduce the issue (so place a new file and wait for it to be confliciting) and send us the Cryptomator logfile afterwards. Be aware that the logfile contains cleartext paths os either replace them or send an email to support@cryptomator.org. Please reference this issue.\nWith the logfile it maybe possible to see the original name of the \"conflicting\" file and how/why it has been renamed.\n. I think we should test this with ODrive and think about a way to fix it.\nSadly this will add more complexity to the sync conflict resolver... \ud83d\ude2d\nNot sure how to handle this but as I understood you the .cloud files are not synced but only created locally? So should only affect the Desktop application?\nIn addition if the situation is as described I do not think this is an upstream bug but we indeed do not handle ODrive correctly (because it is so strange).. After discussing with tobias we came to the conclusion that it is at the moment not possible to support ODrive with reasonable effort.\nCryptomator for desktop is designed to work with a local copy of the files or at least with a network share which provides transparent access to the files. ODrive works in a different way. The .cloud files are just placeholder files which get opened by the ODrive application when clicking on them. This triggers the file download and opens the files with the default application. This process is incompatible with the way Cryptomator works.. Duplicate of #80\n. Currently we consider this an upstream bug. Because the JVM is configured with a max memory amount it should NEVER consume such amounts of memory.\nTried to reproduce this on fedora once but did not run into any problems so this may be caused by system specific configuration or programs. If anyone having this issue could create a heap dump when the program conumes MUCH MUCH memory this could maybe help us to analyze this and find a workaround. But I can not ensure that.. @DaNi--\nScince we are using Java 8 the MaxPermSize is no longer used and relevant.\nThe value for -Xss is not set explicitly but the JVM should choose a reasonable limit if no value is given. This article does not mention Java 8 though and thus this behaviour may have changed now. Do you still run into problems if you add -Xss 4M? Nevertheless I believe the problem is not the stack size - if the stack would grow so high (multiple GB) we would definetely have a infinite recursion or so and this should happen an ALL operating systems and lead to OutOfMemoryErrors there.\nAnother hint: To check the default heap size on your system which is used if you do not set -Xmx you can use java -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal -version | grep MaxHeapSize.. @bivainis \nYes you can help!\n\nCan you check and compare the java version used by Cryptomator on both systems?\nWould be nice to get a heap dump but such a dump could be large. I would suggest to watch the memory growing and create a heap dump when the memory tripled after unlocking the vault. Thus about 2/3 of the memory shown in the dump should be \"leaky\". Such dump would be around 1GB in size and we have to find a way to transfer it. In addition be aware that the memory dump may contain sensitive information processed by Cryptomator so only use testdata and remove all vaults from Cryptomator and restart it befor creating the dump.\n\nAnd thank you for the hint regarding Fedora 24/25 not sure which version I tried, will try again using Fedora 24 is I didn't so far.. Hey! Good to hear from you :)\nChecked which version of Fedora I used and I indeed tested on Fedora 24 so I really can not reproduce this.\nIf you like you can contact us at support@cryptomator.org. Will send you instructions on how to transfer the heap dump then. Mention this issue and me in your mail so your request gets assigned correctly.\nThanks for your effort!. @Grebe-M Thanks for your analysis. Will try this out. If the UI \"animations\" like the curor blinking is causing this we may not be able to fix this because we can not remove the UI from the Cryptomator UI project. In this case we will have to wait for it to be fixed in JavaFX. Anyhow, will investigate if we do something weird or if this is documented somewhere and there actually is a workaround out there.\nWorkaround\nA workaround for now would be to use Cryptomator CLI.. As mentioned in the issue description this is a bug in Mesa / X.org. Systems with Mesa >= 13.0 and X.org >= 1.18.4 should not have this problem. We can not fix this in Cryptomator.. Thx for the info - so we may have regression or another reason on Mint 18.2.. Cryptomator 1.3 does not contain dokany. We will add Dokany (or a suitable alternative) in an upcoming release.. @yoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyo \nI am not sure what this has to do with concurrent access.\nThe problem is that we always open files with rw flags, which fails when the underlying filesystem is readonly. We do this to overcome some issues in Java NIO which occur when opening a file multiple times with different flags in java.\nWe can not detect for sure if a filesystem is readonly from within Java. So we will add an option to open a vault in readonly mode. Then we will no longer need rw flags to open files and this issue should be solved.. @overheadhunter @tobihagemann \nI could implement https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptofs/issues/11. Shall we schedule this issue for an upcoming release?. Ok. Will then have a look at cryptomator/cryptofs#11 and check what happens when using a readonly nio filesystem with our WebDAV adapter. Maybe we have to do some readonly adjustments there too.. Error 67 occurs sporadically on Windows systems when using Cryptomator.\nStrange thing about this is, that the network path Windows \"can not find\" is the path to localhost, so the local system itself. In all cases when we could solve this problem it has been related to some network connection problems caused by system configuration, firewalls etc. In other cases we guess it is related to some strange upstream bug in Windows or similar. Some people suddenly got this error and for some it went away later.\nYou may try to enable IPv6 in the Cryptomator settings. Another thing you can try is to set another port in the settings (requires restart of Cryptomator). For some people that solved it.\nYou may try to uninstall software you recently installed or to reset the system configuration to an earlier state. \nOur problem fixing this problem is that we could never reproduce it on our own systems, yet.\nIf you have advanced IT knowledge: You could for example help us by creating a network dump containing the data send between Windows and Cryptomator. Another thing is checking your DNS configuration for anything strange.\n. @shie-erlich\nIf the network provider order is ok in your case this could be any other network problem. Error 67 and 53 are not very specific and in general just say that the connection to the vault could not be established for some reason which is somewhere between Cryptomator (not in Cryptomator) and Windows (which connects to Cryptomator to show the vault as drive).\nIf you need to access your data you should be able to use a third party webdav client to connect to the vault. The required webdav url can be copied from within Cryptomator when clicking on the arrow next to the \"lock\" button.\nTo get some additional hints how this problem could be fixed you could try to search \"windows webdav error 67\" or similar expression and try some of the things you find.\nYou may also enable cryptomator debug mode (settings), reproduce the problem and send us the logfile (support@cryptomator.org). Will have a look at it but the chances are that nothing that helps is in there.\n. @shie-erlich \nHow exactly the url must be formatted depends on the webdav client you use. You may consult their documentation to get details. In general the URL with http://... should work. I always used Cyberduck, there you can enter the URL directly. \nIf you can not connect to the vault - even with a third party webdav client, this really must be a network problem. In this case recheck your firewall configuration (note: Windows has a build in firewall which could also prevent the connection) and ensure that Cryptomator is allowed.. A thing you can try to ensure the network connection is possible ist:\n\nextract the Hostname and Portnumber from the url (e.g. localhost:42427)\nOpen a terminal\nenter telnet localhost 42427 (replace port accordingly)\n\nYou will now either get a connection error telling you that the connection is not possible or a black screen. Enter a there and press enter. If you see something like \nHTTP/1.1 400 No URI\nContent-Length: 0\nConnection: close\nServer: Jetty(9.3.3.v20150827)\nconnection to Cryptomator was successful.. @shie-erlich Ok if Cyberduck and the connection to Cryptomator in general works well I am out of ideas. That Cyberduck works tells us that it is not a problem with Cryptomator. As mentioned would try search the internet for solutions regarding the windows error 67 when connecting webdav shares.. @freayd \nFUSE in general allows to create symlinks but currently we do not intend to support such because the concept is handled differently on the differnt OSes and thus a vault containing symlinks would only work on a specific OS. In addition symlinks would not be a solution if you want to backup the same file in different vaults because the vault would then only contain a symlink to the file but NOT the actual data. This difference arises because the Dropbox directory is a local copy of all files in the cloud whereas the unlocked Cryptomator vault is only a view on the decrypted files which do not physically exist on the hard drive.\n40 will come in the near future, so maybe that will make it easier for you to work with Cryptomator. I think I mentioned this in some other discussion before but the idea behind Cryptomator is not to create a backup tool but only provide cloud encryption. Thus I think the possibility to synchronize files outside of a vault will not be implemented in Cryptomator but will always need an external sync tool. Of course this may change if we extend the scope of Cryptomator but at the moment this is not planned.\n. @Scrichem This definitely is a network problem so nothing we can fix from \"inside\" Cryptomator. I would suggest you check your network settings and firewall (in case you disabled a third party firewall - windows comes with an integrated firewall which may also be disabled).. @overheadhunter @tobihagemann \nIt just came to my mind that this actually should be \"fixed\" from inside Cryptomator. If the update check fails. Cryptomator should still start. Or is the above stacktrace misleading? (I wonder why a network connection problem during update check should terminate the JVM).. If I interpret this correctly I extracted the update check into an async task to make Cryptomator startup continue while the UpdateCheck is in progress.\nAfter looking into the code I believe the exception from the stacktrace is actually only logged but does not crash the JVM. The exception from the stacktrace is printed by a regular LOG statement at AsyncTaskService:127. This line is invoked from AsyncTaskService:99 for every exception that is not handled otherwise during an async task - but nothing more happens here and the exception is not rethrown.\nSo the problem \"Error invoking method. Failed to launch JVM\" must be related to something else (maybe related to missing network connection too). Will try to reproduce this later.. It depends on how you encrypt your UserAccount folder.\nIf you use some OS or similar function or encrypt using some full disk encryption utility and the folder is available as a \"regular\" folder it should work fine.\nIf you use a tool to encrypt your user account folder it depends on how exactly the tool you are using works. I would recommend you try it with dummy data or data which you can restore. If it works well you may try the setup with your real data - but no guarantees of course.\nUsing Cryptomator to encrypt your UserAccount folder will not work and is not what Cryptomator is made for.\n. Ah ok then.. in general this is possible but:\n- If you mount the \"outer\" vault and then mount the \"inner\" vault it leads to stacking of WebDav shares and this will cause a lot of overhead. It works in general (did such things for testing) but may be slow and lead to problems with Windows Explorer etc.\n- IMHO this doesn't add additional security. If someone finds a way to efficiently break the encryption it would not be relevant if you use one or two layers.\n- In addtion just applying the encryption two times must not lead to enhanced security. An example is the meet-in-the-middle attack (not 100% sure if this would apply here but it at least is an example that encrypting two times with different keys does not always increase security significantly)\nAnd regarding encryption of system folders:\n- This will cause problems because Cryptomator will not start until you log in and Windows may require data from the folder before that.\n- Tools designated to provide \"non cloud compatible\" encrypted containers may perform better and lead to enhanced security (e.g. because they may not operate on a per file basis and thus nobody can see how many files you have etc.).\n. This will be implemented for windows. On linux and mac we currently have no options of force unmounting of the share.. Definitely have to do something about this. Scheduled for an upcoming patch.\nPadlock icon sounds good in my opinion but @tobihagemann should think about this.\n. Yes this will do. The relevant part from the logfile is the following message:\nCaused by: java.nio.file.FileSystemException: /samsung/Google-Drive/GD/d/UQ/[...] -> /samsung/Google-Drive/GD/d/VM/[...]: Das Ger\u00e4t oder die Ressource ist belegt\nThis tells us than an error happens when Cryptomator tries to move the encrypted file on the real file system. Not sure why this happens but according to this unix.stackexchange question it maybe related to a process still accessing the file.\nCan you reproduce the problem and then run\nlsof +D /samsung/Google-Drive/GD/d/UQ/V776C6PUGW7VNAW3SSC5WPK3WMFAJB/\nand send us the output. This will allow to check which programs access the file. If it is Cryptomator or no program is found we may (but also may not) have a problem in our code. In this case I will try to reproduce the issue. Otherwise the programs accessing the file must maybe stopped to make it work.\n. Can you tell us which error you see exactly? Any error message could help.\nIn addition you may check the logfile (located at %APPDATA%/Cryptomator) for error messages and send them to us. If you attach the fill logfile make sure to clear out sensitive data which may be in there (see #363).\nThis maybe related to the already known problem #355.\n. Fails on Windows 7 too. Version 1.2.3 allows to unlock the vault and according to the net use output mounting works fine. Nevertheless the mounted drive is not visible in Windows Explorer. Using the command line, run as Administrator shows that on the one hand the drive actually is mounted (net use prints the location) and on the other hand can be accessed (switching to Z:\\ and running dir worked well).\nSeems to be somehow related to how shares / permissions are handled. A share mounted using \"highest privileges\" can only be seen by programs running with the same permissions. Windows explorer fails to display the drive even if run with \"highest privileges\".\nWorkaround\nMounting the drive by hand using Windows Explorer worked fine for me. Together with #143 and #452 this is the best currently possible.. It is a good idea to encrypt the stored passwords instead of storing them as plaintext.\nFact is: We already encrypt the stored passwords.\nOn OSX we use the system keychain to do that, which is also used by many other programs or tools.\nOn Windows we use CryptProtectData - a windows API which encrypts data using the windows password. Details can be found here.\nBe aware that if the local computer is compromised even encryption of the passwords does not prevent leakage of the password - e.g. by getting access to the keychain or users windows password.. Yeah you are right... did completely forget about this.\n\nHiding how many vaults you have is hard to protect. On the one hand this could for example be derived from the cryptomator configuration file size. But of course we could design a random padding to avoid this. On the other hand the vaults are always visible on the local file system. Thus hiding them in Cryptomator does not add security at all.\nI think this is really a good point. On windows this is possible at the moment and we should think about introducing a master password in this case. When using a keychain (as on OSX) I think the keychain application already handles this - but will have to discuss this with the OSX guys.\n\nIf we add such feature I think we should enable it by default and allow the user to disable it to ease the autostart feature. When a user does not give his user password away this should be fine.\nWill reopen this and narrow the scope of this issue. Thank you very much for your suggestion.. This actually is a duplicate of #40. Will consider this, after we implemented the store password functionality for the most common linux systems.. @pwoehrer Any new messages from the logfile? The message you got so far should be gone now. . @Zasch Can you please create a new vault and post the error message from the logfile afterwards? If this message is equal to pwoehrers message you will have to install the JCE policy files as well.. The virtual drive is mounted using gvfs. This mounts the drive to a system specific path. Common locations are /home/<USER>/.gvfs/<server_connection_name> or /run/user/$UID/gvfs but it could be different depending on the distribution you use. The drive should also be visible in the file browser too.\nIf you can neither find the drive in the file explorer nor in the gvfs location of your system mounting may have failed. In this case you may mount the drive yourself by copying the webdav location (Cryptomator UI -> Unlock Vault -> Klick Arrow next to Lock Button) and mount it either using your file browser or for example by using davfs2.\nIf you have other error messages in the logfile regarding a failed mount process you may open another issue for that.. Actually we do not manually issue a mount command but use gvfs to mount the WebDav share. Using gvfs we can not influence the options in the mount command. Maybe this can be configured somehow in your  gvfs configuration.\nIf you need a different setup you can copy the webdav URL (click the arrow right to the Lock button) and mount using a custom command.. Do you use an IDE or do you invoke maven directly from the command line? When invoking maven from the command line the class DaggerCryptoFileSystemTestComponent should be generated by Dagger during the maven build. If this class is missing before running maven this is ok.\nSometimes IDEs do not support generation of code that well. You may have to run maven from the command line once and then tell the IDE that the directories\n\ntarget/generated-sources/annotations and\ntarget/generated-test-sources/test-annotations\n\ncontain sourcecode.. The SizeMismatch stuff was a bug. Just released sanitizer v0.6. Running this version against the vault should no longer show the SizeMismatch ERRORs.. @DimDroll You may have a look at this blog post which contains additional hints how you maybe fix this problem. In addition you can mount the webdav drive by hand using a mount command (you need davfs2). The webdav url can be copied from within Cryptomamator (arrow icon next to the \"lock\" button).. Good hint. I think we should rework that.\n@overheadhunter Any ideas? Maybe we could just fill the password field with some static text when a stored password is loaded and keep the real password somewhere internally? Would make thinks a little more complicated though.. Yes, as I mentioned... more complicated ;)\nMaybe if we implement this logic in a custom PasswordField which allows setting a stored password this would prevent changing the controller code.. This seems to be not a problem in Cryptomator but a problem in the webdav client or some other program on your computer.\nThe warnings you see appear in the log if a process tries to speak https to an http server. Details can be found in this jetty bug report. To fix this you could do a network dump and try to find and fix whatever sends these the https requests.. Can you attach the logfile? Maybe there is some information in there, we could use. Before that you may enable DEBUG output in the settings dialog (checkbox at the bottom). Please note that you have to restart Cryptomator before changes to this setting get effective.\nAnother option for you would be to copy the webdav url (arrow symbol next to the Lock button) and try mounting that yourself (either using your file browser or by mounting with davfs2 from the command line).. @Luca1991 You may open your file explorer and look for a mounted drive. If there is none you may connect the vault by hand. To do this lookup how you can mount a webdav server on your system. You can copy the required URL from the Cryptomator UI using the arrow next to the unlock button.. @Luca1991 Regarding your Illegal character errors, this seems to be #410 .\n@scarabeaus You vault seems to be properly mounted. I assume your file explorer does just not show the gvfs drive. You could use the search engine of your choice to find solutions for this.\n@jiawanyovan You can copy the required WebDAV url from within Cryptomator by clicking on the arrow right to the lock button. You can mount the drive using davfs2. You can find details about this using a search engine.. This issue involves multiple feature requests / suggestions. I comment your ideas below. It would be great if you could open separate issues for the things remaining, if applicable not here but in the android / iOS repo.\nAsymmetric keys to share data\nCurrently you can share access if you send the password to those people. You can also use gpg to do that but of course an automated process would be easier to handle. This maybe a long term feature.\nAdditional protocols / direct remote access\nThe desktop application will remain as is for now and will not contact remote servers. Protocols like sftp/ssh/sshfs may be an option for the mobile apps but not with a high priority.\nSync through Cryptomator\nAs mentioned before the application will remain as is. Integration of synchronization into Cryptomator is currently not planned.\nIntegration of Cryptomator into other applications\nThis is not in scope of our project. If maintainers of other projects want to integrate Cryptomator they can contact us and we may assist them. This for example already happend with Cyberduck.. Obviously an upstream bug, so nothing we can do about it.\nWorkaround\nCopy the excel file to another location (e.g. C:) and open it from there.. @lhagan \nCryptomator should actually minimize to the tray when the window is closed and any vaults are unlocked.    Just checked this and currently it really unmounts all vaults and exists when closing. @overheadhunter did we change this behaviour for some reason or is this a bug?. Duplicate of #96. Will have a look at this.. Hi,\nA direct server connection of Cryptomator to the cloud is basically what the mobile apps do.  We already discussed this approach for the desktop version internally. \nIn general each cloud provider has a way to embed it locally and thus we did decide to implement it the way it is now in the early stage of development. We optimized Cryptomator to work on a local copy of your data and leave everything sync related to the cloud providers third party applications. Of course, if embedding shares via WebDAV or similar protocols, access to Cryptomators vaults is also possible but with less performance.\nI completely understand your usecase as especially for WebDAV the windows embedded connection is really slow. As it is we would need to implement each cloud provider / protocol on its own and maybe partially or completely change the architecture to respect the performance implications of direct server connections. Additional sync logic would add even more complexity and we would have to watch all supported clouds for API changes and publish updates if they change which would mean to risk that users could temporarily not access their data. So, as mentioned in #354, features which are more suited for a backup tool will not be added to Cryptomator in the near future.\nFor now, I would suggest to try the following approach:\n1. Create a vault and store it on your local computer.\n2. Use a third party sync tool to sync this encrypted directory directly with your WebDAV share.\nThis way you will basically get a more performant vault without the problems of the Windows webdav client. The only downside being you need a local copy (I have in mind that especially for REALLY big vaults this may not be an option).\nAnother thing to mention: We are planning cooperations with sync tool providers in the future so your usecase will probably be possible.. Closing this because it is not on our schedule for now. We may reconsider this in the future.. Can you reproduce this, so does this happen every time you create a new folder and rename it or was it only that single time?. From the log and the non reproducibility of this issue I assume it is a problem due to access of a created file by the synchronization client of the cloud provider just while we tried to write to it. This is can happen on rare occasion and should not cause severe problems (as described you could work with the vault after restart of Cryptomator). If this happens more often you may come back to us. Then we may have to adress this in another way than we currently do.\nRelevant part from the log \"The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.\". This seems to be a duplicate of #295 . . Had a look at your logfile and it seems that there is indeed something wrong regarding locking.\nOn trying to move the file test.txt~ to test.txt (I think this is what vim does when writing the file: writing to test.txt~ and afterwards replacing test.txt with test.txt~) an HTTP response with status 423 occured. This is a hint that the client (so davfs2) did not send the lock token obtained earlier. Not sure if this is a problem in our implementation or a problem in davfs2. May check this later.. Yes, that would be helpful to rule a general problem with WebDAV/davfs2 out. Thanks for your effort!. Thanks for this detailed analysis. Will try it out later to see which requests fail and crosscheck against the WebDAV implementation. WebDAV - although a standard - is often not implemented or used correctly. So hard to tell now if the problem is on our server library or a \"common\" misuse of WebDAV on the client side which some servers do address. In either case I hope we will be able to fix this.. @emilhuseynli In fact our server (should) support locking. But as mentioned earlier something maybe wrong there. Will add the solution mentioned by PlanteJon as workaround. Sometime later we will have a look at this to check if the locking prolbem is in Cryptomator or davfs2.. Whe saying\n\nMy vault is located on my local NAS.\nyo mean that the NAS is attached to your local network directly and you access it from your PC via your network?\n\nIn this case the drive used to store the vault would be slower than a regular drive. When opening directories with such many files this maybe indeed a problem related to:\n1. A timeout in windows explorer which leads to errors if listing the contents of a directory takes really long.\n2. The overhead introduced by using WebDAV.\n3. The overhead introduced by using encryption (this is not that big).\n4. The performance of the drive being slower than a regular drive.\nI am not sure if the timeout is configurable. If you disable thumbnails - by configuring explorer to only show a file list - it should improve things because it is no longer required to load the contents of the files. Nevertheless >4k files in a single directory lead to a short delay when doing a dirlisting even on an ssd so I guess performance will never be \"good\" if using a vault on a network drive. As mentioned in other issues the desktop version of Cryptomator was designed to work on a local copy of the data. Switching away from WebDAV will inecrease performance in such cases (#207).. @yogo1212 \nCan you give us some details about the mentioned security issues and the impact on Cryptomator security? As far as I understand webkitgtk2 it is a library which allows \"web\"-integration so rendering of html/css inside of applications. As far as I know we do not do that in Cryptomator.\nIf you have any specific details in mind like specific attacks or similar you may contact us at security@cryptomator.org. You may use PGP. Find the key here.. Should we then rethink the approach of providing os specific packages the way we do and bundle a jvm in this cases too?. Are there maybe any negative side effects of changing this registry entry? So is there any reasonable case a third party tool may actually WANT to have the registry entry in the \"WRONG\" state? Or is the \"WRONG\" value never a good value and obviously a bug in the third party program?\nJust asking to avoid that we fix that by auto changing the key und thus breaking some other software on the system regularly.. @alirezakazemi \nWhich git commit did you try to compile? The last failed build in our CI system was 8a62656, but this commit is already 6 days old and the build error was a test and not a compile problem. So I currently think that something is \"wrong\" with your environment. Which exact JDK version do you use to compile?. The JDK you are using is missing the JCE Policy files. The stacktrace shows that the timeout occured while running SCrypt, which is the function we use to derive the key from the password. The encryption tests do many key derivations and thus consume a reasonable amount of time.\nNot sure why SCrypt is running that long on your system. (But in general it is a good thing if key derivation is slow right? ;) ). When comparing the build duration from other modules it seems that your device is in general a bit slower. Thus you could maybe just increase the test timeouts.\nModule build durations from my system (i7-4700HQ, 16GB RAM, SSD) as reference:\n[INFO] Cryptomator ........................................

SUCCESS [  6.931 s]. @alirezakazemi Yes we use hardware acceleration for encryption.\nClosing this because the build problem seems to be solved in general now.. Currently we are refactoring Cryptomator and will switch from the current encryption implementation embedded in the Cryptomator main repository to implementations extracted into separate libraries, namely CryptoFS and CryptoLib. These libraries are already used for the CLI version of Cryptomator and CryptoLib is used in the app for Android and the Sanitizer.\nCryptoLib actually implements the encryption of bytes. CryptoFS uses CryptoLib to provide an encrypting Java NIO FileSystem which allows to read/write cleartext data and places encrypted data in a delegate directory (the vault location). We had a long beta phase for those libraries to be sure everything is working correctly before doing the switch.\nThings are in fact a little more complex than just decrypting and encrypting byte-streams. To allow efficient access to the files through cloud services, allowing compatibility with different file systems and cloud providers the encryption scheme requires serveral \"ways\" of encrypting data. E.g. files are split into chunks which are encrypted separately (to allow fast random-access) and the directory structure is changed during file name encryption. The way to go, if you want to customize the encryption algorithms, would be to use a modified version of CryptoLib as soon as our current refactoring is finished. The current state is pushed to the cryptofs-branch.\nThe following classes define an interface \"more or less\" like the one you suggested\n- https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptolib/blob/develop/src/main/java/org/cryptomator/cryptolib/api/FileHeaderCryptor.java\n- https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptolib/blob/develop/src/main/java/org/cryptomator/cryptolib/api/FileNameCryptor.java\n- https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptolib/blob/develop/src/main/java/org/cryptomator/cryptolib/api/FileContentCryptor.java\nCurrently we do not have a mechanism to dynamically or configuratively switch these implementations. Currently I would suggest to create a modified version of CryptoLib and build Cryptomator using that (which is possible as soon as we finished the mentioned refactoring). Does this fit your needs in general?\nIn addition I am interested in where you are not sure about Cryptomators security. If you have a specific security issue in mind you can contact us at security@cryptomator.org (PGP Key here: https://cryptomator.org/contact/).\nBecause general changes to the encryption scheme always require (potentially long running) re-encryption processes when users are updating Cryptomator - so when changing things due to personal preferences instead of security issues - a customization approach like you suggested would indeed be helpful. Will have to discuss this with the other developers.\nOne last thought: For users with non technical background the implications of using alternative crypto implementations are not comprehensible. So, for the sake of simplicity, we currently do not want to allow regular users (without technical know how) to change or configure the crypto implementation and algorithms using the UI. Related issues: #105 #302 . Currently I do not think that we will provide a plugin mechanism. The current approach of replacing CryptoLib comes close enough in our opinion. All crypto-operations are done inside of CryptoLib.\nThe things done in CryptoFS are just calls into CryptoLib and some code creating those filesystem links, intermediate directories, metadata files etc. Nothing relevant if you want to change the used crypto algorithms.\nIf you want to alter the encryption sheme as implemented in CryptoFS a plugin system would rather be pointless because such plugins would just have to implement a full nio FileSystem. This could in fact be done more easily when modified CryptoFS.\nA plugin mechanism would mean:\n- Provide a plugin API which is nearly a copy of the CryptoLib API.\n- Call plugins through that API from inside CryptoLib.\nBecause the plugin API and CryptoLib API would be nearly identical this would not really help the developer. On the other hand this would add more complexity to the system even for users who do want to just use the default implementation. Complexity is not good for security and thus we tend to avoid it.\nRegarding the statement\n\nBut I think accounting on just a key which can be braked by some one which has powerful computation power is not wise specially when all encrypted data and keys are to be stored on the cloud.\n\ni would recommend reading Colin Percivals paper on SCrypt (the key derivation function we use). Table 1 contains estimates of bruteforce hardware costs. What is missing here are the energy costs to keep the hardware running which is much higher.. Hey! Sorry that we didn't have time to look into that for now. I guess this is related to a limitation of the WebDav client - so Windows explorer. Did you try to copy the files using another webdav client like Cyberduck?\nNevertheless will try to reproduce this locally and see what I can find.. Tried this with the following test file (path length of 262 chars):\nC:\\abababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababab\\bcbcbcbcbcbcbcbcbcbcbcbcbcbcbcbcbcbcbcbcbcbcbcbcbcbcbcbcbcbcbcbcb\\TestdateiMitLangemNamenSodassDerGesamtePfad262ZeichenLangIst.txt\nInteressting fact: to create the file i could not use Windows Explorer because the filename was automatically truncated to 260 chars or so. Had to use git bash to create the file.\nI could copy the file directly to the root of the vault without problems. I could not copy the abab... directory to the vault. In this case Windows explorer complained that the overall path would be too long. But I couln't copy this directory to another location on my system either. So seems to be unrelated to WebDAV in general.\nUsing Cyberduck I was also not able to copy the file or the abab... directory into the vault. The Cryptomator log did not show any HTTP traffic so Cyberduck itself seems to have problems here.\nAll in all Windows / Windows Explorer can just not handle such \"long\" paths and thus we will not be able to fix this. Maybe #207 will help but even then problems in Windows Explorer will not be solved.\nIf you have further findings you may report them here for other users.. Thank you for the clarification. Will have a look at what happens on the Cryptomator WebDAV server when using FreeFileSync. Do not know about limitations regarding path length tough but we will see.. So checked it using FreeFileSync. I can confirm that it is possilbe to copy the files to an ordinary USB-Stick and that it does not work for the Cryptomator drive.\nAfter having a look at the logfile I could identify the following HTTP-Requests belonging to the file with the long name:\n\nPROPFIND => 404 Not found\nPUT (empty file) => 201 Created\nLOCK => 200 Ok\nPROPPATCH => 207 Multi-Status\nPROPPATCH => 207 Multi-Status\nHEAD => 200 Ok\nPUT (file with contents) => 204\nPROPPATCH => 207 Multi-Status\nUNLOCK => 204 No Content\nPROPFIND => 207 Multi-Status\nGET => 200 Ok\nPROPPATCH = 207 Multi-Status\nDELETE = 204 No Content\n\nSo the file is successfully created at first but afterwards deleted again. The server does not have problems with the path length. FreeFileSync showed an error message \"Fehlercode 206: Der Dateiname oder die Erweiterung ist zu lang. (MoveFileEx)\" which is a Windows error code and does not come from Cryptomator. So it seems that FreeFileSync does something different when writing to the Cryptomator webdav share.. Hey! No problem regarding the confusion. The whole processes is hard to understand (and debug and test ;) ) because so many programms are involved.\nIts interesting that it worked with Mountain Duck because it should be similar to Cyberduck (despite the mounting abilities). Will have a look at DirectNet Drive and update our FAQ accordingly.. You mentioned you used 0.10.0 before. This is an old beta release from 2015-10-29. During beta we did not have an automatic upgrade process of vaults from older versions. So to migrate your vault to 1.2.4 you will have to:\n\nOpen your vaults with 0.10.0 and export the data (copy data out of the vaults)\nDelte your 0.10.0 vaults\nCreate new vaults with 1.2.4 and import the data (copy data into the vaults)\n\nThis process is only required when switching from the beta. Starting from 1.0.0 we have an automatic upgrade process which migrates vaults from versions back to 1.0.0.. Regarding the distribution we never provided a portable version or a zip-file. If you got such it may have been from another source than the Cryptomator website. Regarding portable mode we have issue #48.\nOverheadhunter didn't mean a jdk specifically but did mean your java installation (if JRE/JDK does not really matter). If you use the installer the installed Java comes with bunled JCE policy files. If you use the JAR you will have to intall the JCE policy files by hand. The archive from the download page contains instructions on how to do that.\nIn general I would not recommend to still use 0.10.0 or any old version at all because those will not get (security-)fixes. If you have specific problems with the new versions you may file a bug here. Hope that installing JCE files will solve your problems for 1.2.4.. Regarding the JCE policy files it is absolutely required to install this into the JRE directory. The JCE policy files are not directly used by Cryptomator but \"tell\" the JRE to allow keys with size > 128bit.\nThe missing library should not cause problems but we should definitely include it somehow into the JAR release. Didn't have the this in mind. Without the library the store password function will not be available.\nTo make it available you can download the dll from here rename it to WinFunctions.dll and place it aside the JAR file. In addition add the parameter -Dcryptomator.keychainPath=path/of/your/choice to the Java command line.\nI think we may link to a detailed installation and setup guide for the JAR release on our downloads page.. Can you enable the debug mode (in the settings) and then restart Cryptomator and try to copy a file again. This will add additional output to the logfile which you may attach here afterwards so we can have a deeper look at the issue. You may use testdata to do that because the logfile will contain cleartext pathnames etc.. Closing this as we got no response now for some time. If you come back to us we may repoen this.. Will try this on a test system and come back to you. I currently assume the problem may be that the babylon.js sources contain many small files. With such files WebDAV is not very fast.. Tried this on debian 8.7 and ubuntu 16.04. rsync copyied with around 21MB/s (faster start, slowed down later). One interresting thing I noticed is, that copying completed before any data was encrypted. It seems all data was copyied to the davfs cache first and then send to cryptomator. Encryption speed reached 90MB/s (peak). You may check if the davfs cache on Ubuntu 17.04 is configured differently. Maybe that causes problems but in general I have no clue.\n. Will try again with these files, just to be sure. But to tell the truth, if skipping those files cause issues we may not be able to fix this but it maybe an incompatibility of rsync and webdav shares or similar stuff.\nWill have a look at the cryptomator log if I can reproduce the problem to check if anything weird happens regarding webdav requests/responses. One thing you could try to confirm this, is to use another webdav server and try rsyncing the same data to that location.. Could reproduce the problem described and got a speed of around 140kB/s. Copying does not stop but just takes very long. The Cryptomator logfile contained many requests but no errors and after waiting for some time everything was copied.\nI still assume this is caused by the huge amount of small files. Average file size inside the node_modules dir is ~6KiB. Inside this directory are tens of thounsands of files. A short test with some generated directories containing 18k 6KiB files lead to similar results. So Webdav is just really slow I assume.\nClosing this as I really do not think this is a bug but only a side effect of the webdav speed limitations and the requests produced by rsync and davfs2. I suggest to use a thrid party webdav client to transfer the files into the vault -  this in general leads to much more speed with many small files.\nLooking forward to #252 because this may improve the situation.. Could you explain a little more what exactly do you mean by specifying startup volume instead of using virtual drive?\nDo you mean #40 ? This will still use a virtual drive (Cryptomator will NOT work without this) but automatically unlock and mount it on system startup.. A ok get it now.\nCurrently the architecture will not work without a virtual drive. If you want an enrypted backup of your startup-volume I would suggest to use a setup like the following:\n\nUse Cryptomator to create a virtual drive\nUse a third party tool to backup your startup volume to the virtual drive\n\nNot sure if this exactly fits your needs but Cryptomator will not include such functionality in the near future. Thanks four your suggestion anyways.. Hello. We use gvfs to mount the virtual drive. This seems to cause problems on some systems. You can mount the drive by hand using davfs2. To do this you can copy the webdav url from the Cryptomator UI (arrow next to the unlock button) and then run\nsudo mount -t davfs $MY_URL $DIR_MOUNT -o username=${USER},rw,uid=${USER},gid=${USER},file_mode=700,dir_mode=700\n@overheadhunter Maybe we should add the possibility to directly mount using davfs? Not sure how this is possible from Java because we will have to request root permissions for that.. This means the data in the files has been modified outside of Cryptomator (e.g. through problems while copying the files, a broken HDD or a third party software changing the files).\nDo you still have the original HDD and the data? Do exist any problems there too? If the files are really destroyed somehow there is not much we can do. You can still decrypt the files if you are sure that the problems occured while copying your data but the decrypted content will be different from what you stored.\nI suggest you use the sanitizer  and run it on your vault. This will analyze the problems and provide us a complete look on what maybe wrong with the files. We had issues where two vaults were copied into another which caused that decryption of filenames failed - maybe this is a similar case.\nWhen running sanitizer use the following command:\njava -jar sanitizer-0.10.jar check -vault vaultPath -deep\nI would recommend that you connect your hardrive to your local computer for this because the deep check will read in every file in your vault. You can attach the output here (but you may want so send it in private to support@cryptomator.org). Please reference this issue if you do so. . Turns out something replaced all linux style line endings with windows style line endings which understandably breaks the encrypted files. This process is hard to reverse.. @kladderadatsch \nThanks for your report. I am really surprised about this behaviour. I will see if I can reproduce this but it may be required that you do some more work. I know you maybe can't tell us your password but if possible you could identify if a special character or character sequence does cause this behaviour. If so even a short password containing this should make problems. You may send such information to support@cryptomator.org and encrypt the message.\nCurrently I really can not think of a reason why unlocking vault1 should influence unlocking vault2. Will have to see this myself.\nOne more question: Did this problem occur on OS X and on Windows 7? Which version of OS X?\n@overheadhunter \nI do not think so, but could the be related to the password unicode normalization we already discussed?. Ok this in fact could not be a problem in our code but a bug or unexpected behaviour when entering the ^ symbol in a JavaFX text box. Maybe this applies to other deadkeys too. Will look into this.\nJust another question: If you copy your password from a text editor instead of entering it manually, does it then always work?. Ok thanks for your information. Will look into this.. Tried this on windows but didn't have any problems unlocking the vault. Entering the ^ character is a bit weird though but in general if the entered sequence matches the password it is working fine.\n@overheadhunter or @tobihagemann Could you check the behaviour on macOS?\nIn general I think this may not be a problem in Cryptomator at all but only a problem when entering deadkey characters while not seeing them. We may add a button to reveal the entered password to allow the user to be sure he entered the correct password.\n@kladderadatsch Another request: Can you try to copy-paste the password when creating and when unlocking the vault? If unlocking does still not work then this is issue with JavaFX we might have to analyze and workaround.. Ok. In this case this on the one hand is an upstream bug in the JDK.\nOn the other hand we should\n1. find a way to workaround this strange behaviour when entering deadkey characters on macOS\n2. independently of 1. we should provide means to display the entered password to allow the user to check if it is correct.\nI would recommend to handle a possible workaround in this issue, but am not sure if this is possible at all (without completely reworking the JavaFX text input controls).\nI would add a new enhancement issue for 2.\n@tobihagemann Is this ok?. Think that reworking the controls is way to complex, too. \nThought more of a workaround like changing the Java configuration or setting some parameter on the controls or similar things if this is a known JavaFX bug. Will have to find this out. \nIf there are no chances of fixing the strange input behaviour we may close this issue because we can not do anything about it (besides mentioned enhancements) and its an upstream bug.. In general a nice idea. I would favor a hint over filtering because we do not want to prevent that the password contains dead key characters (this would reduce the available passwords and so reduce the passwords security). I wrote \"hint\" instead of \"warning\" because I would really want to show this as a hint (so in blue instead of yellow) to prevent that a user fears using such characters. Added this to #458 .. Integrated the required \"fixes\" to the UI into #458. A workaround or fix in another direction does not seem to be possible so closing this in favor or #458.. Maybe we could include a \"show password\" button into this feature request and handle it as one (mentioned in #457)? We would have to think about this anyhow regarding UI layout.. I would like to include input hints to this feature request. As mentioned in #457 the user should be notified that entering deadkey characters is a little weird and he should check if the password matches what he wanted to enter.. @daylightbrightledlight \nCryptomator should already show the password strength directly below the password-input fields. Do you not see this information there?\n\n. Can you try this with another webdav share. So mount a webdav server ouf your choice using Windows Explorer and try to fossil init repo.fsl. If the problem is there too this seems to be either a fossil bug or incapatibility of fossil with Windows webdav shares.\nIf the problem does not occur when using another webdav drive please enable debug mode, reproduce the problem and attach the cryptomator logfile.. Cryptomator uses WebDav to provide the virtual drive. WebDav has means to tell the client what the remaining capacity is. I am not sure if we implemented that though. Nevertheless, because it works on other systems (not windows, due to a windows bug) I assume the operating system or dolphin does not handle the webdav share correctly. Will check if we implemented RFC 4331.\nIn the meantime you may try to mount the webdav share by hand unsing mount and davfs2. The webdav url can be copied from within Cryptomator (arrow next to the \"lock\" button).. Hope you meant Cryptomator there? \ud83d\ude09 \nThe URL will remain static as long as you do not remove the vault from the list, so it should be no problem to store and reuse it. If you are going to keep mounting using davfs2 you may also be interested in Cryptomator CLI which would allow a completely scripted setup. Be aware that CLI is still beta because some important features are missing (e.g. HTTPS support, password protected share and the possibility to not provide the password on the command line).. Checked this and we actually implement RFC 4331. Not sure if I can reproduce this at all. Can you tell me:\n\nWhich exact operating system you use\nOn what kind of partition / drive / mount is the vault located?\n\nIn addition you could try to do the following request against the WebDAV server and tell us what the result is:\nbash\ncurl -i -X PROPFIND {{{VAULT_URL}}} --upload-file - -H \"Depth: 0\" <<end\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" ?>\n<D:propfind xmlns:D=\"DAV:\">\n  <D:prop>\n    <D:quota-available-bytes/>\n    <D:quota-used-bytes/>\n  </D:prop>\n</D:propfind>\nend\nYou can copy the {{{VAULT_URL}}} from within Cryptomator by clicking on the arrow next to the \"lock\"-button. You will have to append a slash at the end of the URL to make it work.. Moved to https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptofs/issues/8. You are right - if the application in question is not meant to be run from within a WebDAV drive there is no way to improve that - unless we provide the drive using another technology (see #207).. You might want to join the discussion #326. Currently we do not consider changing the architecture of the desktop application. You may have a look at Cyberduck though, which now has Cryptomator integration and does not require a local copy.. Handling this in #451 . Moved to https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-win/issues/4. Looks promising, worth a try.\nOne thing from the AppImage description:\n* Optional(!) desktop integration with appimaged\nso users will still have to install a service using their package manager to get features like, menu icons etc. But that should not be a problem in general, but may only lead to some \"I do not want to use appimaged but like my package manager more debates\" but I think less overhead for linux builds is worth it. Anybody interessted could still provide native linux packages. In addition we will finally bundle the JRE for linux as well which is a good idea.\n. @tobihagemann Like your ideas, sounds like an approach as robust we need.. When you can open the files when copying them out of the vault I guess this is an incompatibility of the PDF program and the webdav share. Can you open said PDF files from other, third party webdav shares?. Is there something else special about those files? So anything different from the other pdf files in your vault? For example are they relatively small, or large, do the names contain accents etc.? Any pattern?. It is not required to compute checksums of the unencrypted files to detect data corruption. If the encrypted data stays as it is, the plaintext will also be equal to the state before. So in general it is enough to compute a checksum over the encrypted data.\nIndeed we already do that. We compute HMACs of the ciphertext blocks, as described here. We check those HMACs before decrypting, so if Cryptomator decrypts a file without complaining you can be sure the data is untouched.\nWhen an encrypted file is corrupted it depends on where this corruption happened. Most of the times a single bit change will cause a single bit change in the decrypted data. If the chunk nonce changes, the full chunk will be lost. If the file encryption key is changed the full file will be lost. The data which is not lost is decryptable in theory. Cryptomator does not do that (to protect against attachs which involve modifications of the ciphertext) but the sanitizer may get this feature in the future.. We currently use net use to mount the filesystem. As far as I know this is limited to using drive letters. If you know a way to mount a WebDAV share as directory we may consider this.\nIn addition I would like to refere to #207. This will allow to mount to an NTFS path. So will keep this open and we may consider it after #207 is impemented.. I get your point but would rather see this as enhancement instead of a bug report. We already did improve things a little (the message you saw was not there earlier ;) ) but we want to make it better.\nWe already discussed user dialogs for certain common errors in the team and I think this would be a good message to start with. So keeping this as enhancement.. i3wm seems to handle Windows in a different way than other window managers do. It does not provide close buttons and resisizes windows even if they are configured to not be resizable. In this way i3wm is not really comptabile with JavaFX.\nNevertheless i3wm must have a way (but I do not know it in detail) to close windows (would be a poor window manager otherwise). If this approach does not work on the Cryptomator window this seems to be a bug caused by the combination of JavaFX with i3wm. Looked into the bug database but found nothing. Can you close other Java applications using JavaFX?\nWorkaround\nClose cryptomator using kill or launch through a terminal and use Ctrl+C to exit.. To quote from the i3wm documentation:\n\nIf an application does not provide a mechanism for closing (most applications provide a menu, the escape key or a shortcut like Control+w to close), you can press $mod+Shift+q to kill a window. For applications which support the WM_DELETE protocol, this will correctly close the application (saving any modifications or doing other cleanup). If the application doesn\u2019t support the WM_DELETE protocol your X server will kill the window and the behaviour depends on the application.\n\nSo closing should be possible using i3wm. Not sure if JavaFX does implement WM_DELETE. If not, we recommend to lock all vaults before closing.. The log output reminded me of https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/410. Looks like an equal cause: somebody / something is speaking https with the http server.. Moving this issue to https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-android/issues/50. This seems to be a problem with the Windows WebDav implementation. We never tested symlinks and I guess it will not be possible to make it work without breaking the case sensitivity of the filesystem. Maybe this will be possible when #207 is implemented.\nWhen acessing the pages directory, for some reason an uppercase name is used to access it. This is wrong. The line RESPONSE for /crbXP6KASXBH/7/htdocs/PAGES h=true 404 null means, that the directory does not exists, which is correct because \"PAGES\" does not exist but \"pages\" does. Windows seems to display the directory empty in this case. I guess the Windows WebDav client does not handle symlinks correctly when the source filesystem is case insensitive and the target filesystem is case sensitive.. Cryptomator does not issue unmount commands after certain timeout so the reason why the drive is gone may lie outside of Cryptomator.\nWas the logfile you send obtained after the drive disappeared and trying remounting or after restarting the application (asking because it is reset when restarting Cryptomator)? In the latter case we will need the logfile obtained from a time after the problem occured but before restarting the application.\nCan you run\nnet use\nfrom a terminal when the drive disappeared? This will show the mounted drives - so would rule out that explorer stopped showing the drive while it is still mounted.. Is Chromium still running while you try unlocking the drive? In such cases unlocking may fail.\nNevertheless the logfile contains the lines\n2017-04-26 20:37:11,762 DEBUG [CommandResult:85] Command execution finished. Exit code: 0\nOutput: The command completed successfully.\nwhich seems to be the unlock you attempted. I am not sure while the ejecting drive message still appears but no exception is logged - will have to check the code and come back to you.\nIn the meantime you may try Cryptomator 1.3.0-RC3. Whe touched some of the webdav mounting and ejection code (not sure what exactly) so maybe the problems you have are not present there. Not that 1.3.0-RC3 is only available as .jar-Download so you will have a JVM available and need to have the JCE Unlimited Strength Policy Files installed.. To eject your vault without restart you may use the command line and enter the following (change the drive letter accordingly):\nnet use Z: /delete\nYou may test the current release candidate for Cryptomator 1.3.0. You will need to have Java installed including the JCE policy files to run the jar file.\nCan you send us the complete logfile after unlocking the vault and then trying to eject the vault using Cryptomator? You may use our support system to do that or send us an email.\nIn addition you may run the sanitizer on both your computers and send us the results too. If it works on one of the systems I guess there is some difference in the vault structure which causes this. To run it use the following command:\njava -jar C:\\path\\to\\sanitizer-0.11.jar check -vault C:\\path\\to\\vault\\folder. You may also download the release candidate for Cryptomator 1.3.0 as a binary. Here is the announcement.. A vault could get an UUID which is stored inside the masterkey file. This way it could be identified cross device and idependent of name and location when creating or accessing deep links.. Tested on Win7 and 10 using Office 2007 and 2016. Didn't have any problems using RC8 but had the described problems before so seems to be fixed.. @An-error-occurred \nI guess the problem here is, that the Office Upload Centre does some \"magic\" stuff when opening office files from Cryptomator and because some errors and bugs exist in the Upload Centre itself office tells you the weird stuff about that the path could not be opened or would be an offline copy.\nYou told us, that it is possible to copy the file out of Cryptomator and open it from your desktop. This prooves that access to the file is possible (because if a file could not be read it could not be copied to another location). Thus it is not really a problem of Cryptomator providing the files the wrong way but more a problem of Office trying to do the wrong stuff to read the file.\nFor now our possibilites to fix this from within Cryptomator are limited. We can not change the way office tries to access the files. The workaround suggested by you - copying the file to the desktop, edit it there, and copying it back to the vault is currently the way to go. \nThe only way to really fix this is to wait for Microsoft to improve how Office handles files from so called WebDAV shares (this is how Cryptomator provides the virtual drive). Nevertheless we are working on an improvement of our filesystem interface (especially to increase performance) and will provide a dokany implementation ( #207, no date scheduled yet). This should as a side effect also solve this issue.. I understand what you did and if it worked this way disabling Upload Center would be the way to go. Obviously Office does not actually not need the Upload Center to behave broken. As before, the fact that access to the files is possible when copying it out of the vault means that access to the file in Cryptomator is possible. Office must just not be doing it right.\nTo make this clear: We are not happy with the situation and although we believe that this problem is actually caused by Office we of course want it to be solved. Currently we do not have any options to solve it because we do not understand what acutally goes wrong. If we have a way to fix this in a reasonable way and with reasonable effort we will do so.\nI tried to reproduce the problem today and analyze it further but did not succeed. Maybe we will succeed if we have more information about the exact steps. The following could help us:\n\nWhich exact version of office did you use?\nHow did you go offline? Did you disconnect the cable, did you switch your network interface off in the system settings or did you do something else?\nDo you have any antivirus / firewall software running? You may disable it temporarily to see if that impacts the process.\n\nJust a question before I dig further into it: In your report (but its 6 weeks old now) you mentioned you are using 1.3.0-RC8. Did you update Cryptomator to the latest version yet and do you still have problems?. @An-error-occurred \nThanks for the details. One additional question regarding the office version you are using: Which variant of Office 365 do you use? This must not, but maybe relevant. As mentioned I could not reproduce this using a regular install of Office 2016 so maybe this only happens when using Office 365.. I did some testing and could reproduce the problems you are describing. Out of the blue some commands start failing and work again some time later. I also tested with some commands provided by git bash (like cat, diff etc.) to rule out a general implementation problem regarding in the windows commands regarding webdav shares. I then had a look at the logfile and output of your commands and the output of my test run.\nI discovered the following:\nWhen a command fails a lookup of the file is not send correctly to cryptomator. For example when doing fc hi.txt z:\\hi.txt Cryptomator was asked for a file named \"HI.TXT\" instead of \"hi.txt\". The filesystem provided by Cryptomator is case sensitive, in contrast to the regular on Windows. This is a requirement to ensure compatibility with other filesystems. Something in the Windows webdav implementation seems to not handle case sensitivity correctly.\nMy explanation for the toggle between working and non working state is that the webdav caching somehow influences the behaviour. A way to confirm that, would be to disable caching (if this is possible) and try if the behaviour is consistent then (though not necessarily working).\nI tested this using other webdav servers (e.g. owncloud) and had similar results - so this is not a problem specific to Cryptomator but specific to webdav. This will be solved by #207 and can not easily be solved using the current webdav based approach.. We discussed this and came to the conclusion that a workaround may be provided for Windows. The webdav server may remap requests to resources with equal names (when matching case insensitive) if resources are requested and not found. Even then it will cause incompatibilities with Cryptomator vaults created on other operating systems if files or folders with differnt names (when matching case sensitive) were created there. Thus such workaround would have to be enabled explicitly in the Cryptomator settings.\nWe will have to investigate if this solves the problems or creates new problems. In addition we will decide if it is worth to spend time doing this if #207 will solve it anyway. I will keep this issue updated.. @overheadhunter \nJava is somehow unable to determine the filestore of the file stored in Google Drive. Not sure what the error message \"The directory is not a subdirectory of the root directory.\" should tell us. This message is emmitted by Windows / the JVM. Each directory in the filesystem should be a directory of the root directory. The filestore returned for paths inside Google Drive should differ from the regular WindowsFileStore because the available size and also other properties differ. Maybe some special handling is required for the stuff Google Drive does to the filesystem which is not currently done in the implementation of WindowsFileSystemProvider / WindowsFileStore.\nI guess we will have to look at the WindowsFileStore and maybe native code to get more details on the cause of this issue.. @Vesnyx \nThanks for the hint. Did actually miss that comment.\nI am not sure if this is the same issue though. According to https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8140895 the fix should have been backported to JDK 8 as well. In addition the Google Drive files do not seem to reside on a SUBST'ed drive according to the stacktrace posted by seanatcesa.. GFS update 25.157.165.2150 seems to have resolved this problem. If this problem occurs again, we may reopen this.. You can enter zero as port in the settings. This will choose a free port automatically.. Fine the original problem is solved.\n\nWe should add a readable error message for this case. Maybe we could provide the option to let Cryptomator choose a free port automatically through the dialog.\nNot sure why that happens... I guess the creation of the folder happens before the port is used and there is no error handling afterwards, so no message appears in the UI. Should add a readable message for this case too and launch the server before folder creation to display the error ASAP.. I assume this is an upstream bug. The \"Files On-Demand\" feature of onedrive seems to somehow make access to the file using regular IO from Java impossible. It has to be seen if this is a bug in Javas IO implementation or a bug in Windows IO in general.. We are currently working on this.\n\nThe problem we are facing is, that standard java io operations fail when files on demand is enabled in Onedrive. We assume it maybe either a problem in the JDK or in Onedrive. We are currently in touch with the Onedrive team and on the other hand test how this behaves when using Java 9. We assume that we have no way to work around this in our code and may have to wait for a fix in either the JDK or Onedrive. If we learn more and find a way to solve this on our end with reasonable effort we will do so.\nCurrently, disabling files on demand is a workaround for this problem.. @RiseT \nIn general you are right, but to solve #375 we will have to provide such option anyhow. From java we can not for sure check if a filesystem is readonly or not. So the user would have to set a readonly flag manually befor unlocking anyway if we solve #375.\nI will change the description of #375 to make this more clear.. Answered a support ticket concerning this issue some time ago.\nWe could \"fix\" this by feeding only the first 100 chars of the password or so to zxcvbn. This will not be a problem regarding the computed password strength. If we only feed the start of a password to zxcvbn the worst thing that could happen is that a low score is reported for a passwort that actually is strong. This is acceptable - especially because it will only happen for such long passwords.\nCurrently this does not have a high priority in my opinion. Why? IMHO using such long passwords really does not improve security. Using a much shorter password with reasonable complexity will be enough. A 50 chars password generated by a password generator containing alphanumeric and special characters should be enough. Such a password contains > 256bit of entropy which is more than the derived key. Using overly long passwords will not enhance security.. We released Cryptomator in Version 1.3.1 and it seems you are still using Version 1.2.4. Do you also have problems when using the current version?. Cryptomator is not a tool meant to hide your data but just a tool to encrypt your data. This way Cryptomator adresses the two core concepts confidentiality and integrity of information security. Cryptomator itself does not address availability. Availability is achieved by using the cloud. When storing your files in the cloud the data is replicated and stored in multiple locations by the cloud provider. Part of the history of files is kept, even after deletion, and most providers allow to restore deleted files. If you fear loosing your data you should create additional backups as you would do with non encrypted files.\n\n\nEssentially no. Even when hiding the .cryptomator files, it is obvious that the directory structure belongs to a Cryptomator vault. Even if the structure would be changed it still would have new properties which could be identified except when using steganography. In addition Cryptomator is not a steganography tool and will most likely never be. Using the cloud, this may not even be possible on a large scale.\n\n\nIf someone has the permission to delete data from your storage, you can not avoid this by performing encryption. The permission to delete data is granted to anybody who has the password to your cloud and of course your cloud provider is also capable of deleting your files. In addition anybody who can access you computer, while you have access to your cloud could do deletions. Cryptomator can not change this, because access to the cloud is not granted by Cryptomator but by mounting / connecting to your cloud. In addition this level of access is required for Cryptomator to work.. As Eyremba already commented this, it is not possible as long as we use symmetric encryption. As long as we do allowing encryption without entering the password would allow to decrypt without password as well.\n\n\nWhen using asymmetric ciphers it would be possible in theory. In pratice this would mean a major change to the encryption scheme employed by Cryptomator. Without a secret there also is no way to guarantee authenticity of the data (even when using asymmetric ciphers). So ensuring, that the data has been placed there by a person authorised to do so, is just not possible.\nCurrently I consider that we will not add such feature to Cryptomator on the long term.. Can confirm this. It appears to me that in fact the window is too small.\n\n. This is in fact java related and can not be fixed easily. The usage of the JavaFX password field is the main reason for the password showing up in the memory dump. Because the creation of a memory dump requires elevated permissions an application which would be able to exploit this could do many other things which can not be prevented either.. You may try a WebDAV client like Cyberduck and connect to the vault after unlocking (WebDAV-URL can be copied when you click on the arrow next to the lock button). You might be able to rename the directory using Cyberduck. If that does not work we may add a function to https://github.com/cryptomator/sanitizer to allow fixing this problem.\nIn theory this is a \"valid\" state of our encryption scheme because after encryption the directory names differ not only in upper/lowercase. But in fact the clients have mechanisms to check for directories / files with names which only differ regarding upper/lowercase.  So we wonder how the vault got into that. Can you remember what you did before the two folders appeared?. I did some testing with a vault containing a directory abc and Abc. Windows Explorer seems to have some severe issues once it discovered directories with equals names. Files in Abc could not be renamed, Explorer told me they did not exist. After renaming abc to abc_old, abc_old and Abc are shown in the directory listing but Abc can no longer be accessed and Explorer tells me that the directory does not exist. abc_old is still working fine.\nCyberduck is working fine in any case - so I assume if it tells you there is no directory \"dev\" this might be true.\nI assume this is some weird caching issue or some other stuff caused by Windows explorer. Try the following: Remove the vault from the list in Cryptomator (select it and press \"-\"). Add it again using the \"+\". This will cause a new URI to be assigned to the vault and will prevent that the existing cache is used.\nIn addition it was possible to create the directories Abc AND abc using Cyberduck so the mentioned mechanisms which should check for files / directories with equals names do not seem to be in place. Maybe it is not implemented correctly or I was completely wrong and we do in fact not have such mechanisms. Will have to check the sources.\n  . I believe Windows / the WebDAV client implementation is just utterly broken regarding directories with names which differ only regarding upper- / lowercase. In a WebDAV share it is common and allowed to have such directories. If a directory can be seen or not seen should depend in no way on the actions did before, except for creation / deletion of the directories ifself of course. Inspecting the HTTP requests send to the WebDAV share by Windows makes obvious that the problem is somewhat Windows related. E.g. sometimes when performing actions on the lowercase directory a path containing \nThe new filesystem backend which does not rely on WebDAV is actively worked on currenty #207. Waiting for #207 or a fix from Microsoft would provide a workaround. I greatly recommend to NOT create such problematic directories but of course if some tools does so there is not much you can do against it. To fix such problems a WebDAV client like Cyberduck can be used.\n@overheadhunter A possible workaround / change to the WebDAV server could be to implement special handling of lowercase / uppercase files and directories for Windows clients. I am thinking of something which performs all operations which would be done on an item which is not found to a corresponding item which differs only in uppercase / lowercase, if such item exists. Do you think we have any options regarding this? . We already have issue #284 where high memory usage problems and a possible solution have been discussed in detail. I suggest to try the described solution and come back to us if it does not work then.\nNevertheless a usage of around ~200MB when the application is idle is common. This is mostly libraries related to the JVM and stuff to provide the virtual drive, UI and other functionality.. @PhilZ-cwm6 \nWhen long paths work outside of WebDAV drives this does not confirm that the problem is not within the Windows webdav client. As mentioned we did some testing and we could confirm that the weird characters are introduced by the webdav client (the Windows webclient which is active when browsing with windows explorer) using the HTTP log. The responses from Cryptomator did never contain such characters until the client decided to request / create files with those weird names. That this problem occurs on other WebDAV drives as well confirms that this is a general issue with WebDAV shares and not a problem specific to Cryptomator.\nSide note It took some time to reproduce this problem with the external WebDAV server. We think this maybe due to timing issues, because the local WebDAV server provided by Cryptomator is much faster than remote servers but of course this is only an assumption. The conditions causing the problem are unknown. Thus this may not be reproducible with all WebDAV servers.. K, perfekt, dass es so geklappt hat! \ud83d\udc4d . @fredd727 We already have this in mind and will use the new mechanisms in one of the next versions.. Fixed in https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptofs/commit/140d2cba57bf0d8d91957c3317f24f86e08d7fa1\nAs soon as we update CryptoFS this will be solved in Cryptomator as well.. @joeyvix \n\nRegarding the first point: This already is discussed here #283.\nRegarding the second point: This might not be possible because the current structure of Cryptomator for Desktop requires local access to the files. Chaning this would mean to rewrite most of it.\nRegarding the third point: This is due to limitions of Windows explorer and the Windows WebDav client. When using a third party WebDav client like Cyberduck this does not happen. Plenty of open issues exist regarding this. A workaround will follow with #207.\n\nClosing this issue because nothing remains to discuss here.. The current version of sanitizer supports vault version 6. I assume you are using an old version.

Exciting news.. My bad if this is obvious, but is there a ticket open for HiDPI on Linux? - since the Linux label was removed on this one.. Congrats on releasing Cryptomator 1.4.0!\nIssue is fixed on Linux. :) :fireworks: \nhttps://cryptomator.org/downloads/#linuxDownload. Currently testing around.\n\nMacbook Pro mid-2015 running Elementary OS Juno - works perfectly out of the box\nThinkpad X1 Yoga running Fedora 29 - not scaled properly\n\nBoth of course have HiDPI displays.\nI'm thinking there might be some environmental variable or Xorg setting I have to set.. @matmaxgeds I think I found your solution! Worked on the Thinkpad.\nRun this in the terminal:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface scaling-factor 2\nWhat I am wondering is what will happen on the KDE desktop.. Might be a silly question, but what would be the disadvantages of the way Veracrypt works, where it actually mounts a virtual drive to your system?. Ok, so I ran cryptomator.sh and managed to catch the exact output from when dav communication froze: https://ghostbin.com/paste/9b66w \nHope this helps identify the problem.. Thanks for the response @tobihagemann. Will definitely try out 1.3.2. Any estimate on when that will be?\nI've tried regular WebDAV before, but it fails to mount. I think it has something to do with #585. Just wanted to report that I started using Cryptomator again for casual work (It's been 2-4 weeks since I started using Veracrypt instead, as this bug was making it hard to work.) I've been editing a financial spreadsheet for the last couple of hours with no issues whatsoever, constantly saving.  \nMaybe it was just an upstream Ubuntu 17.10 problem rather than something you guys needed to fix? They've been fixing a heck of a lot of problems lately. I'm 100% positive that this was an issue a few weeks ago.\nIf by Wednesday, I haven't experienced this problem again, I will close this issue. Stay tuned.. Hmm. I did run into the issue again but it is no where as bad as it was before. Happens once a day after I boot up my computer, I force eject the volume, lock & unlock the vault again in Cryptomator, then it will work fine for the rest of the day. Once again, probably an Upstream Ubuntu/Gnome issue, but could be worth investigating. \nWhether you'd like to keep this issue open for visibility or close it is completely up to you.. ",

Windows Explorer reported a message similar to \"Can't read from source\", Total Commander reported \"Can't Copy.

There's a feature that lets you add a :+1: to the issue's original comment, thanks.\n. @lassomagic Not a solution using cryptomator, but if you only need an encrypted folder on macOS, you can use a Disk Utility sparse bundle instead of cryptomator. Plays a lot nicer with macOS.. @Trebuin It shouldn't have to retransmit. A sparse bundle splits the filesystem into multiple chunks, similar to what cryptomator does. On macOS, it may appear as a single file, but it's actually a folder with lots of small files that correspond to the filesystem sectors.. @Trebuin No, that's unfortunately not possible. I primarily used cryptomator as an encrypted one-way backup to my server. Since I got a MacBook, I don't even do that anymore as a Time Machine is enough for backup purposes. I still use sparse bundles as a way to securely encrypt some files like all my scanned documents.. Why not just pipe it in via stdin?\ntail < /dev/urandom\nShows as tail for me.\nSomething like this would easily work and be scriptable/usable in every major programming language.\n. @heinrich-ulbricht Good point. Writing it out is quite dangerous (why use encryption locally, anyway if you write out the password in cleartext?). I'd say piping will allow that.\n. @mostolog how the user is gonna do it should be only the user's business.\n. Why can't Cryptmator automatically create a backup in one of its folders and if the process finished correctly, delete it?\n. @elsesiy Is it possible that you installed the developer previews while @submarine89 installed the final release? Apple may have screwed something up in patching.\n. @elsesiy I was talking about macOS. :smile:\n. @elsesiy You're talking about cryptomator, which is a file encryption tool. I'm talking about an operating system called macOS.\n. @Tchoupinax did you try defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores true? This should in theory prevent macOS from creating .DS_Stores on network drives (not sure if this works for cryptomator drives too).\n. Are you able to create a manual backup of your iCloud? If yes then I suggest you should do that, in case you (or cryptomator) mess something up when trying to get this to work.\n. For everyone who doesn't speak German, the problem basically is this:\n- Container is in Dropbox folder\n- Dropbox folder is on hard-drive X:\n- Folder's free space is calculated like it'd be stored on C:\n- Copying is impacted if the files are bigger than the free space of C:\n- Copying in small parts still works perfectly fine though, as a workaround\n. Good catch, this seems to be a pretty huge issue. Hopefully it'll get fixed soon.\nOnly thing I'm wondering - does this only affect Windows 10?

It's the standard icons shipped with JavaFX so they have the same licence as the framework itself\n. They are normally bundled in a javafx-ui jar along the CSS files. We could include this jar in the project  but we would have to manage the css priority between the files in the jar and the ones within cryptomator.\n. The icons are in the javafxrt.jar, we should be able to use them to without puting them within cryptomator. How come cryptomatir doesn't use the default CSS ressources ? Because adding the CSS code wasn't enough to have the icons showing up, this is why I rebundled them\n. Oh okay this explains why I didn't have the icons by default. \nSo what do you prefer ? A rebundle or a switch to the default css files ?\n. From a licence point of view, isn't a rebundle the same as using the default components ?\n. I merged upstream:master, is the content of the pull request ok now ?\n. I tried to remove them from within intellij but to no avail. I'll try the solution in your link !\n. Ahem, the git -rm fucked up my project setup, I had to reconfigure a new project within intellij. \nNow I've put the .idea directory in another folder so project is not mixed with the sources.\n I don't know if this will be reflected in the pull request (as it's a new project) or if I have to close it and create a new one ?\n.

The transition is not very smooth, maybe we should wait a second before switching from the \"check for updates\" to the \"failed\" message ?\nIs that the correct refresh icon ?\n\n.

    "reg007": "Thanks, ok then...\nI created 2 vaults called iPhone and Mac. Neither device sees the other vault and in Icloud online I see the mac vault but not the iPhone vault.\nNow on the iPhone if I goto Settings>iCloud>Storage>Manage Storage> (I see the following folders)\nCryptomator (inside this folder is the iPhone vault and a readme.pdf) * pdf file cannot be viewed*\nOther Documents (inside this folder is all the files and folders that are on the mac and iCloud online including the mac vault).\nSo perhaps on the Iphone you need to save the vaults into Other Documents instead of the applications folder Cryptomator maybe?\n. Hi, yes forgot about sandboxing. The Cryptomator directory that is created on the iPhone is not shown anywhere else except on the iPhone. Please see pics. However any vault created on the mac does show online and only in the other documents on the iPhone.\nGoing forwards I still don't believe iCloud is a mature enough platform to hold such critical data and I still believe the likes of DropBox, S3, etc are better suited, but, for the purposes of the software, I am not sure if this is a bug?\n\n\n\n\n. On my Mac under terminal\ncd ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/iCloud~com~setolabs~Cryptomator/Documents\nIt does list\nIphone.cryptomator\nreadme.pdf\nand I can view the pdf file\nHope this helps.\n. Hi yes if I do the above that works perfectly. Likewise if I do a search for the vault's name it shows (see pics). If I right click on the vault and click Show in Enclosing Folder I can double click and open the vault. I can also add files to the vault and they are synced to the iPhone no problem.\n\n\n. At least being able to find the vault in the finder means one can right click on the vault, make an alias and drag the alias to the dockbar or wherever suits and you are up and running.\nI don't believe you will be able to unhide the mobile directory. So thinking out loud this is what I would suggest if someone wants a vault that can be viewed on a Mac or iPhone using iCloud Drive. This means any updates done on either device will show up.\nSteps\n1) Install Cryptomator app on iPhone and open app\n2) Create new vault and give it a name\n3) Choose iCloud Drive\nThe vault is now created on the iCloud Drive. Wait around a couple of minutes for the iCloud to sync to the Mac.\n4) Open Terminal on Mac and enter \nopen ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/iCloud~com~setolabs~Cryptomator/Documents/*.cryptomator\n5) You can now quit Terminal\n6) When you next open Cryptomator, the vault will be listed on the left hand side\n. I can confirm this issue is resolved. Vaults created on the phone are now listed under iCloud on the Mac, fantastic and a big thank you for your efforts.\n. Hi, correct if click on either \"Add a Place\" or \"More\", there is no Cryptomator, hope that helps and thank you for all your good work.\n. ",

    "asteppke": "Thank you for all the feedback. To the first comment: the processor in this machine does not support the newer AES-NI instructions. That is why I stated the Veracrypt numbers as a comparison what is achievable using AES without special hardware support on this machine. \nThere are no special firewall configurations. There is Sophos Endpoint Security and Control as anti-virus software installed. I do not know whether it additionally scans all traffic on the network interfaces but at least downloading a file from a local server over http reaches over 50 MiB/s so that is unlikely to be the bottleneck. \nI can test with another PC soon which has AES-NI for comparison.\n. To add another datapoint: Windows 7 x64 on i5-3570K, this time with AES-NI. Only Microsoft Security Essentials running, switching the real-time scan on and off did not make any difference.\nOn this significantly faster machine the large file performance is better, about 32 MiB/s, still much slower than Veracrypt's speed of 3200 Mib/s. The small file performance also improved to about 700 KiB/s but is still pretty low compared to what the underlying hardware can do. During the copy process cryptomator uses about 15% of total CPU time, Windows uses another 15%, the remaining 70% are idle. \n. Great to hear about this improvement which should speed things up quite a bit! \nI wanted to give this a quick test on my Windows machine but the built did not succeed here (maven started the encryption tests and then did nothing anymore), so I will wait for any updates or an alpha version of the multithreaded version.\n. I just repeated the initial benchmark with the the 0.8.1 release and the result a big improvement on this machine (Windows 7, i7 860 CPU):\nLarge file performance 0.7 branch: 18 MiB/s\nLarge file performance 0.8.1 branch: 80 MiB/s\nUnfortunately the small file performance is unchanged, i.e. in the vicinity of 0.3MiB/s. \nAs for the issues with building here I get the following message when using\n```\nmvn clean install\n[....]\n[INFO]\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[INFO] Building Cryptomator cryptographic module (AES) 0.9.0-SNAPSHOT\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[INFO]\n[INFO] --- maven-clean-plugin:2.5:clean (default-clean) @ crypto-aes ---\n[INFO]\n[INFO] --- maven-resources-plugin:2.6:resources (default-resources) @ crypto-aes ---\n[INFO] Using 'UTF-8' encoding to copy filtered resources.\n[INFO] skip non existing resourceDirectory C:\\Temp\\cryptomator\\cryptomator\\main\\crypto-aes\\src\\main\\resources\n[INFO]\n[INFO] --- maven-compiler-plugin:3.2:compile (default-compile) @ crypto-aes ---\n[INFO] Changes detected - recompiling the module!\n[INFO] Compiling 11 source files to C:\\Temp\\cryptomator\\cryptomator\\main\\crypto-aes\\target\\classes\n[INFO]\n[INFO] --- maven-resources-plugin:2.6:testResources (default-testResources) @ crypto-aes ---\n[INFO] Using 'UTF-8' encoding to copy filtered resources.\n[INFO] Copying 1 resource\n[INFO]\n[INFO] --- maven-compiler-plugin:3.2:testCompile (default-testCompile) @ crypto-aes ---\n[INFO] Changes detected - recompiling the module!\n[INFO] Compiling 3 source files to C:\\Temp\\cryptomator\\cryptomator\\main\\crypto-aes\\target\\test-classes\n[INFO]\n[INFO] --- maven-surefire-plugin:2.12.4:test (default-test) @ crypto-aes ---\n[INFO] Surefire report directory: C:\\Temp\\cryptomator\\cryptomator\\main\\crypto-aes\\target\\surefire-reports\n\nT E S T S\nRunning org.cryptomator.crypto.aes256.Aes256CryptorTest\n```\nand then nothing happens. I aborted the process after 3 hours without any CPU activity. This is not in a VM.\n. I checked and web proxy autodiscovery is disabled here. So the slowdown is caused by something else.\nNo idea why the test fails here, my Java skills are quite rusty so maybe it is just a silly mistake with my build environment. I got back to the initial state, \ngit reset --hard\nHEAD is now at 71983cc - added copyright information for the OS X progress indicator\ncommented out the two last tests and then started the built with\n```\nmvn clean install\n[...]\n\nT E S T S\nRunning org.cryptomator.crypto.aes256.Aes256CryptorTest\nTests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 2, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 2.103 sec <<< FAILURE!\ntestIntegrityViolationDuringDecryption(org.cryptomator.crypto.aes256.Aes256CryptorTest)  Time elapsed: 0.762 sec  <<< ERROR!\njava.lang.Exception: Unexpected exception, expected but was\n        at org.junit.internal.runners.statements.ExpectException.evaluate(ExpectException.java:28)\n        at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.runLeaf(ParentRunner.java:325)\n        at org.junit.runners.BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.runChild(BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.java:78)\n        at org.junit.runners.BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.runChild(BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.java:57)\n        at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner$3.run(ParentRunner.java:290)\n        at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner$1.schedule(ParentRunner.java:71)\n        at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.runChildren(ParentRunner.java:288)\n        at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.access$000(ParentRunner.java:58)\n        at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner$2.evaluate(ParentRunner.java:268)\n        at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.run(ParentRunner.java:363)\n        at org.apache.maven.surefire.junit4.JUnit4Provider.execute(JUnit4Provider.java:252)\n        at org.apache.maven.surefire.junit4.JUnit4Provider.executeTestSet(JUnit4Provider.java:141)\n        at org.apache.maven.surefire.junit4.JUnit4Provider.invoke(JUnit4Provider.java:112)\n        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\n        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:62)\n        at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\n        at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:497)\n        at org.apache.maven.surefire.util.ReflectionUtils.invokeMethodWithArray(ReflectionUtils.java:189)\n        at org.apache.maven.surefire.booter.ProviderFactory$ProviderProxy.invoke(ProviderFactory.java:165)\n        at org.apache.maven.surefire.booter.ProviderFactory.invokeProvider(ProviderFactory.java:85)\n        at org.apache.maven.surefire.booter.ForkedBooter.runSuitesInProcess(ForkedBooter.java:115)\n        at org.apache.maven.surefire.booter.ForkedBooter.main(ForkedBooter.java:75)\nCaused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid key.\n        at org.cryptomator.crypto.aes256.Aes256Cryptor.aesCtrCipher(Aes256Cryptor.java:226)\n        at org.cryptomator.crypto.aes256.Aes256Cryptor.access$000(Aes256Cryptor.java:55)\n        at org.cryptomator.crypto.aes256.Aes256Cryptor$2.initCipher(Aes256Cryptor.java:646)\n        at org.cryptomator.crypto.aes256.EncryptWorker.process(EncryptWorker.java:28)\n        at org.cryptomator.crypto.aes256.CryptoWorker.call(CryptoWorker.java:38)\n        at org.cryptomator.crypto.aes256.CryptoWorker.call(CryptoWorker.java:13)\n        at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:266)\n        at java.util.concurrent.Executors$RunnableAdapter.call(Executors.java:511)\n        at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:266)\n        at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1142)\n        at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:617)\n        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)\nCaused by: java.security.InvalidKeyException: Illegal key size\n        at javax.crypto.Cipher.checkCryptoPerm(Cipher.java:1039)\n        at javax.crypto.Cipher.implInit(Cipher.java:805)\n        at javax.crypto.Cipher.chooseProvider(Cipher.java:864)\n        at javax.crypto.Cipher.init(Cipher.java:1396)\n        at javax.crypto.Cipher.init(Cipher.java:1327)\n        at org.cryptomator.crypto.aes256.Aes256Cryptor.aesCtrCipher(Aes256Cryptor.java:223)\n        ... 11 more\n```\n. With the JCE policy files installed the tests and the complete built work nicely here. So it is indeed tied to that. \nNow the remaining issue is only the slow encryption speed for small files.\nThank you for all the support so far!\n. Hi @MuscleRumble, thank you for further investigating this. I have downloaded the 0.9.0 snapshot binary and tried here again. \nThe performance seems to be unchanged: 80 MiB/s for large files and approximately 0.3MiB/s for small files. \n. @totalvoidness: No problem, I can test different versions here easily. To narrow it down it might be best to have some configuration switches, checkboxes or settings where we can disable certain parts  of the binary, e.g. the file size obfuscation or the random number generator. \nI still hope that this is not inherent to using webdav on Windows. \n. Thank you for looking into this. \nI added the log option to robocopy and attached the corresponding log files from robocopy and cryptomator (logfile.txt, cryptomator.log, aborted the process after several minutes)\nAdditionally I reproduced the issue on a different system here with Windows 10 (different CPU, also SSD, same software configuration). Both systems according to the taskmanager were not busy during the copy process (CPU load < 15%). \nI also tried just copying with the Windows Explorer, the issue remains and seems therefore also independent from robocopy. \nThe cryptomator throughput window essentially shows for each small file a red 'spike' and then a flat line at 0 for about 10 seconds for each single file.\n\nIf it would be helpful I can try over the weekend another computer with fewer background processes. . Now I tried cryptomator on the same machine in a Virtual Machine with a fresh Windows 7. Here the copying is going much faster without the interruptions. So it is not tied to Windows 7 or the hardware but some interaction between cryptomator and the rest of the system.. I have tested here with the /MT:1 option of robocopy but the results are unchanged. The copy operation is still very slow. \nWhen accessing the folder before robocopy has finished I can trigger the following robocopy error: \n2018/09/07 01:33:58 ERROR 1450 (0x000005AA) Changing File Attributes K:\\test_files\\small\\2dgame\\build\\pyglet\\tests\\font\\\nInsufficient system resources exist to complete the requested service.\n(closing of issue was accidental, please disregard). @infeo Thank you for this update. I tested the unofficial build here and stability and performance is greatly improved. \nBefore robocopy was stalling here and could not finish the operation at all. Now with the same test dataset we are up at 23 Megabytes/min on this old PC.\nSome operations are still quite slow though, deleting the whole folder results in 6 files/second and 23 Megabytes/min equals 400kByte/s. (In contrast the Veracrypt benchmark reaches for AES 500MBytes/s, so it is not the encryption itself that takes so long but something else is a bottleneck in cryptomator).. I noticed a similar issue using syncthing. The software tries to open a folder in the cryptomator vault and complains that it can't find the folder. It tries again a couple of times and finally finds the folder. \nI could not reproduce this in Windows Explorer though.. ",
    "SecTec": "How do you implement interoperability with for example smartphone apps?\n. The program could just take the OS entropy as a seed for a CSPRNG. Than every IV could stay as implemented now. But the coder has to implement a CSPRNG into the program, which will increase complexity of the code.\nI don't know what the Cryptomator team want to implement in the future, but if the plans contain the implementation of a CSPRNG than they could use it for this issue too.\n@overheadhunter what did you mean by\n\ngenerate just one 128bit IV per write access and adjust the last 64 for each chunk, so the counter will not repeat.\n\nI think the IV must have the same size as the blocksize? You told only where 192 bit have to come from, or am I wrong?\n. @overheadhunter: Why do you re-seed the PRNG to often? You could generate very much entropy made of one seed. And why setting the 65th bit to 0?\n. Couldn't you check if the 64 LSB are 1 and if so stop the counter and generate the next IV? Than Cryptomator will gain 1 bit more secure IV. And the check if 65th bit is 1 or 64 LSB are 1 shouldn't cost more CPU time (I'm not sure because i don't know the x86 CPU that good in detail). Or do you want to count a 64 bit variable up, than you don't need the 65th bit in IV either, because you get the Overflow flag in the CPU.\nint IV[2] = {PRNG(64), 0}\nif (IV[1] == 0xffffffffffffffff) {\n  IV[0] = PRNG(64)\n  IV[1] = 0 }\nelse\n  IV[1] = IV[1] + 1\n. Hi,\nmaby it's because of your Java version?\nhttps://cryptomator.org/downloads/#jarDownload\nThe site say \n\nRequires JRE 8 + JCE unlimited strength policy files\n. Hi,\nwhy not encode the users password to Base64 or Hex and display it as a \"security code\". It won't weaken the encryption and could be used as \"recovery code\".\n. Ok,\nthe users password go through a key derivation funktion I hope, than it has a fixed length of 256 bit. Than convert this to Base64 or Hex.\n\n2nd suggestion Trololol:\nNag the user with following:\nIf you loose your PW you are screwed. Please type in \"If I loose my PW, I am screwed\" and hit the OK button. Than the user is aware of the situation.\nThe Problem I see is:\nA recovery code and the password are the same. You could unlock your data with an secret information. Doubeling the information do not prevent the information be lost. But it increases the codecomplexity and the number of possible attacks.\n. @MuscleRumble\nWhy a code that is shorter than 88 byte should not be \"secure + usable\". And what is the problem with variable size of the code?\nThe code is anyway only as secure as the users password is.\n. If you want an case insensitive code, we need to encode base32, thats even longer.\nBut, what is wrong with a variable sized code?\nIn my opinion we don't need any recovery code. Nag the user to write down his password.\n. You suggested a 16 character long code with only numbers and letters. The code has 36^16 possibilitys ~83 bits ~ 12 character random password. This will weaken the encryption.\nI can't see the advantage of an recovery code.\nYou nag the user to generate the code and write it down somewhere secure. Why not to tell him to store the password in that secure place?\nLets make a pros and cons list:\nPro:\n- User can recover files after loosing his PW\nCon:\n- User have to store doubble data (PW and code)\n- Doubbeling attack possibilitys\n- Increasing code complexity\nNow talk about the only pro I see (maybe someone see more):\nIf the user would loose his password he could also recover the data if he wrote down his PW and don't posses a recovery code.\nNow lets think mathematicaly:\nPW and code are unlocking the vault, are pieces of information and are textual encoded.\nThen why not PW = code. \nNext step if PW = code and the user has to write down the code in a safe place, than tell him to store his PW safe.\n. You are right with scrypt, but it depends on the implementation of the code. If you are using the derived key as code than you need all bits you can get. If you are using something else than maby not.\n. Isn't the OS moving things to a recyclerbin? What should cryptomator do about this?\nCryptomator only offers a crypto layer, filehandling should be provided by the OS.\nYour OS should create a trashbin for a webdav \"disk\".\n. Hey, usually I would love the idea to add more ciphers, but the Crypromator team wanted a small, easy program with only small amounts of complexity to achieve security.\nBecause of this -1 from me.\n.

    "infeo": "1.4.0 will have dokany support, which provides a filesystem interface independent from WebDAV. This can be used as a workaround.\nYou can find the current beta here: Cryptomator 1.4.0-beta2 with Dokany enabled.\nPlease notice: This is a BETA! Make Backups when you're using this.. @overheadhunter that's not the problem. Run a small command application and a qt-based gui app from a vault and both worked fine.\n@SokoFromNZ yes, it would not be very difficult changing the filesystem being case insensitive.\nBut Windows can have more than case insensitve file systems and thus i wouldn't suggest it to implement it in general. From my point of view the fault lies at FileZilla being sloppy.\nThe issue won't be reopend since in the above case the program starts but fails to find some settings (or sort of) and therefore quits.\nRegarding your suggestion, you can open a dedicated issue as a feature request.. With dokany it works. and even better, it updates its status when doing something somewhere else on the same partition :D . will be fixed when the newest https://github.com/cryptomator/dokany-nio-adapter library version is included.. Fixed with https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/commit/e08c2b7dc3b60a569cba1369c9123c01ee08f677 .. as noted in #697, cryptomator starts now inside the vm, but you still don't have an ui. \nCurrently the only maybe-workaround is the usage of https://github.com/cryptomator/cli.. I tested this with the current 1.4.0 release and it seems to work. Closing this issue.. Since we switched to JDK10, which only supports 64Bit systems, this won't happen anymore.. Good news to everybody: we just fixed the Timestamp-Problem in https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptofs and thus these changes will be included in 1.4.0 version!. Fixed with https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/commit/e08c2b7dc3b60a569cba1369c9123c01ee08f677 .. Update: Currently JDK10 is already in use for beta 2. So for now we are aiming the use of JDK10 in the final release (;. well better now than never,:since we finally use dokany this feature will be included in the final ~~1.4.0~~ 1.4.1. Because oracle dropped the difference between limited and unlimited strength jurisdiction policy even backwards in java 8, this issue is deprecated.. With updating to cryptofs 1.6.1 (see commit https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/commit/bc09f28120220f55aeea76a107672cf59f867150#diff-fec012cc4a57b506ab0a978597145d8c) this works now.. @thewinner666 basically yes, but there are several informations missing here: What OS are you using, which cryptomator version is running, can you provide any log files? Without this info we cannot help.\nBut most importantly, if you just need help, you should use the forum. This git-repositroy is for developing cryptomator, e.g. bugreports, feature requests etc.. Additional note @thewinner666 :\nOh, I remeber that I answered som time ago someone with a strange name and funny picture such a question. I can remember this, since the person rambled about like a little kid that none answered his request.\nBut the person ddin't gave enough info in the post to dig into this, therfore i had to asked a few question to analyze it better. But up to this very day these question leave unanswered and the remaining of the user is unbeknowst.... To bring some light into this strange and questionable behaviour:\nThe last modified bug is known (see https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/705)\nThe problem with 'not enough system ressources avaiable' is also known and caused by running dokany in singlethreaded mode. When you try to do multiple operations (e.g. copying, looking into a folder and more) it can appear.. Since the other last-modfying bug and the performance issue will be resolved with the upcoming 1.4.1 release, i'll assign this issue to the 1.4.1 milestone. If the problem persists, the issue can be reopened.. Closed with commits da62a22faf144addc21abfecbb51029ca1c29da5 and c36a1a4aefa2476f32fbb29317409e9d5bb8a15e. Okay, we found the cause of the bug AND there is a workaround for this. (The actual fix needs some time)\nWorkaround Instructions:\n\ncreate/open the vault on the webdav-drive (don't unlock it!)\nclose cryptomator\nOpen the settings-file of cryptomator (located under $HOME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Cryptomator\\settings.json or C:\\Users\\[YOUR USERNAME]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Cryptomator\\settings.json) with a texteditor\nfind the block enclosed by {} which contains the name of this vault (\"mountName\":\"YOURVAULTNAME\")\nedit the string behind the \"path\" and enclosed by \"\" in the following manner: delete the @-character and everything behind it until the first \"\\\"-character\n\nExample\nWe want to mount a vault named test2 and your settings.json looks like this:\n{\n  \"directories\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"Y1uNd-siQXx_\",\n      \"path\": \"Y:\\\\test\\\\test\",\n      \"mountName\": \"test\",\n      \"winDriveLetter\": \"B\",\n      \"unlockAfterStartup\": false,\n      \"mountAfterUnlock\": true,\n      \"revealAfterMount\": true\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"vrhge4DMSIAx\",\n      \"path\": \"\\\\\\\\www.webdavserver.com@SSL\\\\DavWWWRoot\\\\User6a7bc97\\\\My Directory\\\\test2\",\n      \"mountName\": \"test2\",\n      \"unlockAfterStartup\": false,\n      \"mountAfterUnlock\": true,\n      \"revealAfterMount\": true\n    }\n  ],\n  \"checkForUpdatesEnabled\": true,\n  \"port\": 42427,\n  \"numTrayNotifications\": 0,\n  \"preferredGvfsScheme\": \"dav\",\n  \"debugMode\": false\n}\nAfter editing, the part representing the test2-vault looks like this:\n{\n      \"id\": \"vrhge4DMSIAx\",\n      \"path\": \"\\\\\\\\www.webdavserver.com\\\\DavWWWRoot\\\\User6a7bc97\\\\My Directory\\\\test2\",\n      \"mountName\": \"test2\",\n      \"unlockAfterStartup\": false,\n      \"mountAfterUnlock\": true,\n      \"revealAfterMount\": true\n    }\n. Added highlighting of focused UI elements in windows and linux, for mac it is still missing.. bug still persists. but if you change the focuse after step 4 and refocus to cryptomator, the menu eventually opens. So, just retested this issue with beta2. The results are... not overwhelming. But this is due to the properties of the underlying filesystem (NTFS). For more info, see this answer on superuser: https://superuser.com/questions/881804/case-sensitive-file-extensions-in-windows-and-linux#881813 or this explanation in the context of mathematica https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/97734/case-sensitive-file-names-windowsposix)\nBasically we support directory and file names which differ only by usage of upper or lower case letters. BUT windows and programs written for windows does not have to work so well with them. Sometimes and some things work and on other times other things don't. ~~I would suggest we spare us this uper-lower-case headache and just say on window cryptomator is case-insensitive.~~ \nEdit: For Portability reasons and to not invalidate any existing vaults, we should proceed with care. I'll post an update if a good solution is found.. will be fixed when version of https://github.com/cryptomator/fuse-nio-adapter is updated in cryptomator.. Fixed with https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/commit/e08c2b7dc3b60a569cba1369c9123c01ee08f677 .. There seem to be two differnt vaults in this lock file^^.\nThe failure of the re-unlock is explainable and easy to fix (an already existing dir causes this).\nWhat i can't figure out is the unlock failure of the first vault:\n21:37:05.483 [JavaFX Application Thread] ERROR o.c.ui.controllers.UnlockController - Unlock failed for technical reasons.\njava.nio.file.FileSystemException: /Users/dkoppstein/Library/Application Support/Cryptomator/fuse_vaultq3OV1RZZResT: Device not configured\nCan you say anything 'bout this unlock attempt?. empty vaults can be a caused by one or more corrupted cipher text files, see issue #673. . With dokany it works. You have to refresh the explorer view, but then the directory is displayed.\nWith WebDAV the problem persists.. @njmckenzie are you using an individual mount path or the standard mount point?\nEdit: \nI retested this issue on Ubuntu 18.03 LTS with both scenarios but couldn't trigger the bug. Without a log file there is not much i can to for now. Additionally, it seems like something else went wrong since you got a NullPointerException during the unlock-Process. \nMy thoughts are that the UI the option \"Use own Mount Point\" was checked, but either no Path was given or the \"Apply\"-Button was not clicked and therefore the value of the Mount Path was empty. This is a GUI issue and not related to empty/non-empty mount points. @njmckenzie Thanks for the log and it is good to hear that it works now smoothly!\nThe excerpt of the log-file proofs what i suspected causing the bug, namely that the individual mount path variable didn't contain any value. This is a different bug, and should be discussed in a new issue (if it appears again) or in issue #695 .\nThe warning about the JSON-settings file does contain unknown settings can be ignored. The option \"mountAfterUnlock\" does not exist anymore in beta2.. we report it by not \"implementing\" (overiding) the readlink(), symlink() and link() functions. The underlying library https://github.com/SerCeMan/jnr-fuse sets the fuse method pointer to null, if you do not implement a method.. We could implement stubs and return always the error ENOSYS: Function not implemented. But that would increase overhead, since then there will always be file calls to this functionality.\nEdit: Since we does not desperately need file locking I suggest we reschedule this filesystem feature to milestone 1.4.x.. Can be closed when the new nio-adapter library versions are included. We plan this step for the 1.4.0 release.. Fixed with https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/commit/e08c2b7dc3b60a569cba1369c9123c01ee08f677 .. @soehub can you provide a full log file?  your excerpt contains only the exception, that the filemanger with the opened vault could not be opened, but nothing more. The important part should be before this exception.. I don't think this issue has to do something with cryptomator. \nSince there is no additional info given or any other reportings, i consider this closed.. yes, but it's only one possibility. Without a log file (which unfortunately does not exist) or any further information how this happend its hard to tell, what causes the fault.\nif its related to https://github.com/cryptomator/webdav-nio-adapter-servlet/issues/2, then beta2 won't help because this fix is not included.\nBut i think its worth a shot.. Well, i hope the 1.4.0 release will resolve this problem.. related to #673. @gmpreussner \nAlthough i like the split up of the log into several sections, can you also provide the full log file? E.g. for the copy/paste section you show an IllegalArgumentException, but this exceptions is thrown because the filecontent was not written to the storage (the header of each cipher text file is 88 bytes long and thus a getSize()-call on a empty ciphertext file throws this error). The important question is, what went wrong during the write operation. \nAnd can you also provide a log file where you use the FUSE protocol for providing the vault?\nWith both logs it should be easier tracking down the error cause.. @gmpreussner thanks for the log files. \nat the first glance i'm a bit worried about the errors, it seems like the basic java file system calls are throwing an error. If this is the case there is not much we can do. :/\nBut i can say more after i got a running test environment to investigate in this.. Since we already have thread about running cryptomator in mac VM guest systems (#93), i consider this closed. Any further improvements can be noted their.\n@epsschonegge if the gui doesn't show up, maybe you can use https://github.com/cryptomator/cli. If it works, it would be awesome if you also report it in issue #93 . Fixed with https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/commit/e08c2b7dc3b60a569cba1369c9123c01ee08f677. @lf-zbw do you mean something like adressed in issue #220 ?. We would need to keep somekind of database for the metadata, which is out of development scope. (Mainly due to complexity).. This should be fixed in cryptofs with commit https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptofs/commit/bc89e002abcedfa634184cc97df4220f7b7b903d. Can be closed when we integrate this into cryptomator. Fixed with https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/commit/e08c2b7dc3b60a569cba1369c9123c01ee08f677 .. @soti84 \nWhich OS are you using? It seems like your using Windows, which does not support FUSE.\nDue to an bug in beta2, you can select this adpater even though it is not supported. If this is the problem, you should switch to Dokany or WebDAV if possible.. issue will be solved when the next dokany-nio-adapter version is included in cryptomator. Thanks for reporting it!. This is caused by AppleDouble files, which cannot be deleted by the fuse adapter (we mount the unlocked vault with the option -onoappledouble which hide such files for the user because of performance reasons). This will be fixed when the next https://github.com/cryptomator/fuse-nio-adapter version is included.\nMounting the vault with WebDAV and then deleting the directory (as described above) is the current workaround.. Fixed with https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/commit/e08c2b7dc3b60a569cba1369c9123c01ee08f677 .. Tanks for reporting your issue! But i could not reproduce this on a Windows10 system.\nBecause of my quite similiar test environment (see below), my first guess is that it has something to do with windows 7. Another reason could be that you create load on your drive/vault while robocopy is working, because currently the dokany-adapter used in cryptomator runs in singlethreaded mode. (should be changed in the final 1.4.0)\nTo get more information, what Robocopy options did you use?\nAnd can you also provide a log of robocopy? (Option /LOG:C:path\\to\\logfile)\nMy Setup:\nOS: Windows 10 Pro 1803\nHarddrive: SSD\nDokany: 1.2.0.1000\nCryptomator: 1.4.0-beta2\nrobocopy-options: /MT:8 /UNILOG:C:some\\path\\robocopy.log /E\ntest-dir: 609 files, 217 folders, overall size of 75MB. Today i had another look into this and could reproduce this issue. At first there were pauses between some copy operations and after a while the process got stuck (but mysteriously when accessing the files in the original directory, not the vault). When i switched to singlethreading in robocopy(option /MT:1), the copy action finished without any pauses.\n@asteppke:\nCan you try to copy your dir into the vault in singlethreading mode to confirm this behaviour?. To revive this issue after some time has passed: \nThe error is caused by the current singlethreading mode of dokany. After a 10s the dokany library gives up on an up to this point unanswered filesystem  call. If you use robocopy in multithreading mode and browse in the mounted volume, there are several threads competeting for being executed a single thread. So if there is a heavy copy task, it can happen that some calls are dropped.\nMultithreading of Dokany is scheduled for the next 1.4.1 release.. Good news: We activated now the multithreading in our our dokany library! It also passed the tests, but since one should not take multithreading too easy, we hesitated to create an official build.\nBut if you are interested and want to contribute, you could try out the unoffical build and give some feedback.\nAs a little appetizer, here is a stat report by robocopy of copying a directory with 2121 Files with single threading mode\n```\n        Overall  Copied  Skipped    Common    Errors     Extra\n\nDir.:         9         9          1         0         0         0\nFiles:      2121      2121         0         0         0         0\nBytes:   30.55 m   30.55 m         0         0         0         0\nTimes:   0:08:29   0:01:11                       0:00:00   0:00:14\nSpeed:              450842 Bytes/Sek.\nSpeed:              25.797 Megabytes/Min.\nand multithreading mode\n            Overall  Copied  Skipped    Common    Errors     Extra\nDirs.:         9         9         1         0         0         0\nFiles:      2121      2121         0         0         0         0\nBytes:   30.55 m   30.55 m         0         0         0         0\nTimes:   0:02:34   0:00:21                       0:00:00   0:00:04\nSpeed:             1487038 Bytes/Sek.\nSpeed:              85.089 Megabytes/Min.\n```. > \n\n@infeo how long until the code is merged and you make a build on GitHub? I prefer not to test something hosted on ZippyShare.\n\nI don't think there will be a christmas present (; , but i would say january is reasonable.\n@asteppke thanks for testing and feedback!. nevermind. :see_no_evil: . Well, i hope the 1.4.0 release will resolve this problem.. Can you activate the debug mode and post a log file again? (HOWTO: enable debug mode). (sigh) this issue lacks a lot one needs to help in any way.\nAs always: \n1. What Cryptomator version are you using? \n1. Can you provide log files? (see HOWTO: Enable debug mode )\n1. What do you mean with gogs? the self hosted git service? or games downloaded from gog? maybe something else?. This is caused by the used dokany-adapter. There are problems with write-protected files (which all commit files of git repository are). The issue is noted in the respective repository. (https://github.com/cryptomator/dokany-nio-adapter/issues/10)\nThank you for mentioning the problem! \n@gonboy \nCurrently your only option is to use WebDAV. But if you say that also with cryptomator 1.3.4 it doesn't work, there might also be a problem with WebDAV. If you have time, can you also post a log file with the WebDAV-Adapter enabled?. As long as cryptofs does not support the file attribute \"Write Protection\", write protected files are not useable with cryptomator. Interesting error message. This seems like a problem of java, not of cryptomator since the error is thrown in functions of the offical java api.\nI've done some research and found some bugs regarding the error message \"Mount point not found\".\n@brainode which filesystem do you use? (e.g. ext4, btrfs, etc)\nwith overlayfs in a docker setting or btrfs it is highly probable that they cause this issue (see this link or that one). @sanderdatema \nwhat @overheadhunter is pointing out is, that if the password is incorrect, you just recieve an error message in the gui:\n\nIt is not noted in the log file. So if you don't get this error message, your password is correct, but it fails for other reasons. If that's the case, activate the debug log and see if you have the same error message. If it is not the same, see if there's already another existing issue. If this is not the case open a new issue.\nfor the issue opener: as also mentioned, the mount point seems write protected. Please report if this was the problem. to provide them i forked temporary crypomator/cryptomator-linux:\nUnder https://github.com/infeo/cryptomator-linux/tree/master/resources you can find a first suggestion for the appdata file in the flatpack directory. If there are some wrong settings, just let me know.. @bilelmoussaoui is the .desktop ending not needed or should be removed? Because in the documentation examples the value of the launchable property has the .desktop. ending\nOh, yeah. that should be another name.\n@overheadhunter i changed the build paths in the build script. Using build stage sounds reasonable.. Ohh, that is really a helpful tool!\nsoo, added, removed and changed some stuff. \nchecked the appdata file with appstream-util, should be fine now.\ni'll stick to the desktop-id property since it is recommended in the offical documentation.. i suggest using a new branch since the ui element has currently no functionality and it would be only extra effort \"hide\" this element in a stable relase as long as the functionality is not implemented.. you describe two bugs here. The (main) one is the one where the selection is lost.\nFor the second we already have a two issues (see #742 or #705 ), investigated a lot of time and hopefully fixed this bug now.. At first, since this is an open source software, you'll be always able to find out the location of the encrypted masterkey, no matter where or how it is saved. \nSecondly naming the file masterkey.cryptomator shows the user that this file is important, so they don't just delete it because they don't know it. Even better, the user can manually backup it!\nAnd as a third point, if you are not familiar with the security architecture or don't know anything 'bout the software you use, your first steps should head to the documentation and doing some research. . See https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/375 .\nTherefore you have to wait for a future version.. Todo: check spelling before the commit.... On Windows 10 1803 (Build 17134.376) with Cryptomator 1.4.0 it works as expected with Dokany and WebDAV: Accessing (office) documents from the timeline opens the corresponding application with the file. \nWill investigate this more, when the windows 1809 update is installed.. So, after the 1809 update i tested this again and was unable to reproduce this. Both adapters work as expected.\nEdit: Mhm, i think this has something to do with Office 365. I tested this with Microsoft Office Professional Plus (the offline version).. with the office software of libreoffice it works. Also with a txt-document and using the built-in editor.\n@bogdancs92 Can you test this with a simple text file and the built-in editor and report back?. aw man. i'll have a look into this but at first i must grab a version of the office suite somewhere. Thanks for reporting!. I can confirm this behaviour. Seems like it is a bug in https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptofs, because with the pure dokany-adapter without encryption, the timestamp update works. Bug will be fixed when the cryptofs dependecy is updated to 1.6.2.. @overheadhunter na, i don't think so. I looked at the code and in my opinion we can't do anymore than checking. \nBut one thing we could do is inform the user that a) the directory is not empty and b) if we can't remove the directory afterwards. \nThe description with keypass sounds reasonable. I guess it prevented via the symlink the directory from beeing removed and then saved some files in the directory.\n. in general: Currently the FUSE-adapter of cryptomator does not support symlinks.\nFor your first point: Cryptomator can only report POISX errorcodes back to the system (like 'ENOENT`) and can't control how the osxfuse driver or macOS is handeling them. The only optional thing is to write a message into the log. (but i think currently this is not done). Sigh. No, there is no functionality \"removed\". It is the other way round:\nosxfuse just exposes the FUSE interface (set of functions like read(), write(), etc...) which one can implement, but does not have to. In this way you can for example easily implement a read-only filesystem by not implement the functions which alter a file. \nAnd in our case, the https://github.com/cryptomator/fuse-nio-adapter does not implement the symlink()-function of the fuse library. So this feature is not available.\nIf you are interested, you can read more at project site of FUSE.. Ah, thanks for the reminder!\nYes, i think so.\nThe cause could be a lot of things (single thread mode, IllegalMemoryAccessError, Wrong Timestamp), but all of them are fixed with 1.4.1,. @PhillVixx Currently the underlying dokany-nio-adapter has 5 worker threads to serve file system querys (default dokany value), so more than 5 external threads won't yield a higher performance (even may decrease it). Unfortunatley dokany needs a fixed size in advance.. Thanks for reporting this, but \nregarding the seriousness please be aware that the software is not developing and testing by itself in the blink of an eye. It needs free time, money, motivation, energy and skill. So saying we don't take it serious is imho insulting the developers.\nPutting this aside: Of course your log contains nothing interesting, since it only contains the mount with the WebDAV adapter. You need to upload another log file which provides information when you selected the dokany mount method.\nThanks for the offer for the microsoft 365 license, but i got now a version (-;. I can't reproduce this issue with the following setup:\nOS: Windows 10 Enterprise N 1803 (build 17134.376)\nCryptomator: 1.4.0\nDokany: 1.2.0.1000\nOffice: Professional Plus 2016\nWhat are your dokany versions?. Testing this with Cryptomator 1.4.2 i cannot reproduce the issue.\n. It's quite easy: Java 8 is too old and java 11 too young. \nIn Java 11 the JavaFX was outsourced from the standard java library and you need additional dependecies to include it again. The change to Java 11 is scheduled for a later release.\nI suggest to use the provided AppImage, because it is shipped with its own specialized JDK.. duplicate of #697. For a workaround, see #93 \nAs a side note: we didn't do anything on the gui or changed the corresponding libraries, so during the beta phase something on your system was different. If you are able to find out what, maybe post  your knowledge for other users in issue #93. . closed by 7844078203f349001e9cc1213764bc98e36c048a. unfortunatly the sysinternals tool handle does not work i tested it with the current dokany-nio-adapter. When the vault is unlocked and showed in the explorer, no handle to the mounted volume is shown.. related to #711 . What are the file attributes of these files? My guess is that they are read-only and thus opening a handle to them fails and therefore all successive file operation fail. This is a bug in the https://github.com/cryptomator/dokany-nio-adapter library.. i suggest to stick to this issues, since #725 is not so well structered (;. The bug in dokany-library is fixed now with release 1.1.1. \nUnfortunately the underlying inbetween filesystem cryptomator/cryptofs does not support the write protected attribute and always tries to open such files with write access and thus this always fails.\nThere are differnet ways to solve this and we need to think about which one to choose.. > but what exactly does that mean? \nIt means, that write protected files should not be put into the vault. If this already happend, there is a workaround:\nLet's say that your vault is stored in D:\\path\\to\\secret\\vault\\.\n1. Open a terminal\n1. Change to vault directory cd \"D:\\path\\to\\secret\\vault\"\n1. Enter the command attrib -R /S and hit enter.\nThis command will remove from every file in the specified path and its subdirectories the \"write protection\" attribute.\n\ncan we switch out this library for our windows installations of cryptomator manually?\n\nNo. Cryptofs is the core library of Cryptomator (;\n. >Is there going to be a permanent fix?\nWe have a issue for it in cryptofs.\n\nI still face the same behavior of a file being read-only when I directly save it to the mapped vault drive from my Outlook client.\n\nDoes this also happen, if you simply place a file into your vault? It can be the case that Outlook executes a special save pattern to be more robust against filesystem changes, but unfortunatetly involves giving a file write protection.\n. @ruderl You have to apply the tool on your encrypted files. Not the ones in your unlocked vault.. my bad, misunderstood the help page of attrib. Updated my comment.. We need more users to respect the search for already existing issues. . What is a strongbox?\nBSOD errors relate mainly to the dokany system driver. \nCan't tell wether it is dokany or something on our side, since the log file does not contain any debug information.\n. @vanniktech Does the log file show any error before the \"Reveal failed\" message? . Relates to #711 . @TimetravelerDD can you paste a log file while the debug mode of cryptomator is turned on? If you have privacy concerns, use a new test vault with some test files.. > there is a new Dokany Version https://github.com/dokan-dev/dokany/releases\n\nwith some interesting fixes\n* FUSE - Expose allocation unit size and sector size.\n\n* Library - Increase DOKAN_MAX_THREAD from 15 to 63 for better performance.\n\n\nThese changes won't make a difference to the performance since dokany forces you to specify a fixed number of threads before you use it. So as long as the number of threads specified in the dokany-nio-adapter is not changed, there will be no possible performance/stability improvements. At least from these two changes. Duplicate of issue #750 . need to test, if a ui change does not screw up under linux. ready to merge! . I'll agree.\nThis itched me already for a while now, and my idea would be a small filepath obfuscater.\nWhat it should do in my opinion:\n1. obfuscate the directory & filenames: superSecretFileName.txt will be transformed to eeeeeee.txt\n1. different filepaths are mapped to different names: superSecretFile.txt and sUperSecretFile.txt should NOT end up with the same obfuscated name\n1. keep the directory structure: path/to/file should be mapped to aaa/cc/ddd\n1. keep the readability of filepaths: since the logs are for debugging, they should be in some kind of sense readable, so path/to/file is mapped to aaa/cc/dddd rather than MMx4/41/1xXa\nThe points above are just suggestions, maybe there are better ways or the requirements should be relaxed.\nA small bash/python/perl/choose-your-language script should be sufficient, but as a lotn of things someone has to program it (;\nIf it's finished, the issue template can be updated with instructions on using the script.. No.\n@cbartosiak using Handle to list all open handles to the directory yielded like in your case nothing. But when i used the ProcessExplorer, the handles to the opened vault got listed.. I don't know ocaml-fuse, but from my point it seems like neiter of them are the problem. Looks like a write permission issue with the cryptomator.bkup file.. I would rather say the \"error\" here lies in an insufficent translatation \ud83d\ude02 \n@StanoRiga I assume you selected the checkbox and just entered a single character into the text field?\nThe text entered into the field is used as a path to point to some directory or free volume. And since a single letter is not a valid path, you can't unlock the vault. Otherwise a textfield would be quite overkill for a single character and also a decrease in usabilitly.\nIn english, the option is described as \"Use Custom Mount Point\". In german it is translated into something like \"Use Own Volume Directory\" (\"Eigenes Laufwerksverzeichnis nutzen\"). Maybe the description should be changend.. I can reproduce this issue with the most recent version of LibreOffice (6.1.4.2).\nWith the conservative version 6.0.7 it works.\nUnfortunatley i the release notes does not contain any useful information.. @kn1g please stick in an issue to the topic. For your second problem, use the issue search, ask in our forums or open a new issue, if it does not already exist. In your specifc case, >this< would be a reason.\nAdditionally, you can switch from dokany to WebDAV in the settings.. will be fixed with the update of the dokany library to 1.1.2. According to the JDK 11 API the pattern *.txt should work.\nBut i'm afraid we can't do a lot about this :/\nI tested this problem with the raw dokany-java-mirror and it showed the same behaviour. Digging deeper into it revealed that even before the string is processed by the adapter, the search pattern is already wrong. For example when entering dir test.* into the console, the input search pattern in java will be test\"*. \nThis can be either an error in the dokany library or in the C to Java conversion.. will be fixed with the next update of dokany-nio-library version. Yes, with the Dokany 1.2.0.1000 release (see changelog). ",

I will try and do the further testing you identified.  \nIt looks like I'm seeing some of the weird behavior without Cryptomator even involved, in just transferring files to/from Amazon Cloud Drive via either of the web drive programs (access denied).

    "gwarah": "Hi Hunter, is there any way to get the current  cryptomator webdav URL  to mount as davfs2 filesystem?\nSome app running in wine cannot see the cryptomator vault. So I intend to make a shell script to mount a davfs2 volume to solve this problems. Or is there a better solution?\nregards, Lu\u00eds\n. the script will be something like this:\nURL=$(command-get-url-vault)\nsudo mount -t davfs $URL ~/my_vault\n. I've found it. Tks Hunter!\n. By the way, I've finished the script. The package davfs2 must be installed. The only problem is  password chars visible on mount command. A mount.dav2 bug I believe.\n```\n!/bin/bash\nfile    : myvault.sh\ngoal    : mount the webdav volume as filesystem\nauthor  : gwarah; 04/02/2016\nupdate : gwarah; 03/03/2016; password bypass\nwhen davfs2 mount command prompts for vault password, just press [enter].\nIts works fine if the webdav vault had been mounted before\ncd ~\nfile of cryptomator log and last line of current URL\nFILE_LOG=\".Cryptomator/cryptomator.log\"\nLINE_URL=\"$(cat $FILE_LOG |  grep \"http://localhost\" | tail -n 1)\"\necho $LINE\nextract the url from line (last register)\nMY_URL=${LINE_URL##*\\ }\nmount point\nDIR_MOUNT=~/mydrives/myvault\necho filesystem mount\necho URL: ${MY_URL}\necho PATH: ${DIR_MOUNT}\nmount the file system\npackage davfs2 must be installed and configured\nbug: passwords char are visible.

Sure Hunter, subscribed! There are others requested features I have interest such command line functions. regards.\n. Hunter, I've found a new update that maybe could be your interest. It's a password bypass on davfs2-vault volume mounting command. It's avoid the \"password show chars\" bug related before.\n. Sure you can use, modify or refer this script as a model. You owe me some beers when I'll travel to  Germany :+1: \nBut the really great new is that's no need to type cryptomator password at the davfs mount command, if the vault is already mounted.\nAt the password prompt just press [enter] and the davfs-vault  volume is just mounted. Is this the expected behavior?\n. This script is appropriate to an earlier version. This askUbuntu answer has a quite simple snippet to help on this issue.. Sure Rumble, it's really this version. I've done it manually. But at the next versions It will be not necessary, I suppose. \n. Ok Markus, nice. \nSuggestion: put in cryptomator site any upgrade note warning the users about this issue. \nTks for the help. \n. Some screen shots (firefox, libreoffice and nautilus views)\n1) Firefox dialog:\n\n2) Libreroffice message:\n\n3) Nautilus view:\n\n. I've done similar tests accessing this vault by other applications (cups, chromium, google chrome and davfs2), may I post the results in this issue or open a new issue per test application?\n. I've updated to ubuntu 16.04. Libreoffice issue has been corrected. Firefox file dialog issue not yet.\n. @markuskreusch some applications access crypt-vaults but don't open files there. I've try to join pdfs files by pdfshuffler and got this message on open files dialog:\n```\nluis@jupiter:~$ /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/pdfshuffler\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pdfshuffler/pdfshuffler.py\", line 598, in on_action_add_doc_activate\n    f_info = f.query_info('standard::content-type')\ngio.Error: A localiza\u00e7\u00e3o especificada n\u00e3o est\u00e1 montada\n```\nA localiza\u00e7\u00e3o especificada n\u00e3o est\u00e1 montada=volume not mounted\n. New update: An askUbuntu user found a symbolic link workaround. \nDon't fix yet dav volume hidden on firefox-nautilus dialog, but download and \"print to file\" (to these link) resources are working now. . About the workaround (by symbolic link) mentioned above, I suggest reading the #508 issue that complements this one.. 1) Maybe we can invoke just the mount command using sudo? \nR- If there isn't impact to others application (grafical and text) that access the vaults, no problem. But I think the best approach is the permission to some set of application choosen by the user, of course if it's possible \n2) Is there any cross-distribution way to request sudo permissions from the user via GUI?\nR- I don't know anyone.\nNote: I remember sometimes ago I tried a davfs2 solution but it didn't work anymore from the 1.0.X version (on ubuntu 14.04).. @overheadhunter, libreoffice fails on opening docs.

    "SokoFromNZ": "Hi guys,\nI'm using Win7 Ult x64 SP1 (latest updates) and CryptoMator v1.4.6 with a vault using Dokany.\nUnfortunately I have the same issue as described here with any portable app installed in the vault.\nI want to move my secure data and apps from TrueCrypt to a CrytoMator vault but if I'm not able to run portable apps out if it I cannot use it.\nAny idea why this is still happening with Dokany?\nDo you change the FS name when using Dokany? I've found this issue where they say you have to use NTFS as: https://github.com/dokan-dev/dokany/issues/678\nThanks\nAndi\nPS: Using WebDAV instead of Dokany doesn't change anything (obviously ;) ). @overheadhunter @infeo I think I've found a solution (using Dokany)!\nI did some more testing using the current version of FileZillaPortable in a vault. When starting FileZillaPortable.exe it says it cannot find an XML File...but the file is there!\nI looked closer and saw upper/lower case differences in the path to the XML file.\nSo I changed the folder name to the upper/lower case letters in the error message. Did it again for the FileZilla.exe and FileZilla started!!\nSo in a nutshell:\nThe problem is the case sensitivity of CryptoMator File System!\nI would say this is an easy fix if I weren't a developer myself :-)\nThe only easy fix I can think of is if Dokany comes to the rescue: Can you set a non-case-sensitive mode in Dokany?\nAnyhow... Things that need to be done at first glance:\n\nReading and writing to the the vault must support non-case-sensitivity (maybe easy via Dokany).\nWhen creating a vault there is a checkbox (default=false, only visible on windows?) to make the whole vault non-case-sensitive\n\nWhat do you think guys?\nAndi\nPS: Would you mind to re-open this bug again as its definetly not fixed with dokany?. @infeo My point is that the overall Windows user who uses apps installed on CloudDrives, CryptoMator, Boxcryptor, VeraCrypt, Bitlocker VHD-File etc. just sees that they work great with all of them but CryptoMator. Nobody kinda cares why its not working, its just a disadvantage. But I'm totally with you saying that FileZilla is sloppy here! Back to a users view though: I use over a dozen of apps installed and none of them are working in CryptoMator. So its a general sloppiness in for Windows apps. Its definitely bad, but we won't be able to change it.\nAs mentioned I wouldn't do case insensitive in general as you might want to use your vault also on OSs with case sensitive FS. Just as an opt-in option.\n@overheadhunter \nSo if a user requests foo.TXT CryptoMator encrypts the filename and looks on the CloudDrive for that encrypted file name (simply spoken)? So the content and the correct filename (+ Path I reckon) is encrypted in one single file on the CloudDrive? If that is how it works I understand the issue...\nHhhmm...You could encrypt the file always in lower case... but you would have to have a completely separate dictionary for storing the real name of the file as the user wants to keep its upper/lower case letters. Which would be quite a pain to develop :(\n@infeo  do you have another/easy solution in mind?\nOr would you guys like me to open a feature request and discuss it there?. ",

In sum, Cryptomator is too raw to use in production, since it has problems with integral part of daily routine, the large files. Workaround is to use EncFSMP, EncFS4Win, or [VeraCrypt][3].

That sounds like a good plan!\nI can't say I understand what you mean in #299 though, by 'kill' did you just mean it will be slow or? \nBoxcryptor or another similar software does do something like that. If this were my project I'd simply add a layer that compresses, splits then decompresses/reconsitutes after transparently to the cloud provider layer so it can't tell that it wasn't always multiple files.\nI could be wrong, I just started using this product today and don't know enough but this is the first thing I ran into. So, right now I manually 7zip the files into chunks then place them into my cryptovault.\nIt would just be nice if this was automated as one of the layers built into the app instead of me having to do it separately.\n. You can know if the sync client is not done syncing (file1 from one file\nand file2 from another like in the example you gave) because the recombine\noperation will fail checksum, so one can just try again after the second\nfile syncs and both parts are done.\nYou don't need control over the sync layer, and it doesn't matter which\nfile sync first, if you try to recombine them only after both parts of the\nsame file arrive.\nYou hint at what happens if the sync client does not work correctly and\nboth files never arrive, but this is even more likely to happen on small\nfiles with multiple users editing if the sync client is poor than for\nlarger files, which people typically don't edit at the same time.\nAnd right now larger files don't work at all, people have to manually do\nthis.\nOn Thu, Jan 5, 2017 at 5:41 PM Tobias Hagemann notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nLet's say we would split a file in two or more files and they'd be\neventually synchronized (uploaded one by one!). Keep in mind that we don't\nhave any control over synchronization. Think of this edge case: Multiple\npeople work on the same file (e.g., because you share a vault with your\ncolleague) and now you have multiple uploads at the same time. This\nactually doesn't even have to be such an extreme case. Synchronization\nconflicts can also happen if you have multiple devices and work with\nsynchronization clients that are doing an awful job at keeping things in\nsync.\nIn that way you could end up with a splitted file that have different\norigins. Let's say we have file.part1 and file.part2. There is a\npossibility(!) that file.part1 ends up in \"another version\" than\nfile.part2. Heck, why don't we just throw in file.part1 (1) and file.part2\n(1) in there, because they just popped up as synchronization conflicts!\nHave fun putting everything together. \ud83d\ude02\nI'm exaggerating, but hopefully you get the idea why just a small\npossibility could destroy(!) your data or make them unreadable. This would\nbe fatal and that's why we prefer atomic operations.

Also getting very high CPU usage that persists after transfers have finished.. If anyone following this thread missed the announcement, the open-source cloud storage browser Cyberduck has Cryptomator integration in its v6.0 beta that will allow this. However, I tried one build and there were issues like how it once uploaded a file to the directory of a vault without encrypting it, even though I'm pretty sure I had the vault unlocked. So I'm waiting until v6.0 is stable.\nAlso, Cyberduck's paid sister app Mountain Duck that lets you mount cloud storages as drives will soon have Cryptomator integration in v2.0 (if you do wish to buy it, note that they charge again - with a discount - for major version updates so you might want to hold off on the current v1.7).\n@patmuk, thanks for the heads-up that just using Cryptomator's own application won't necessarily work well with any old method of mounting the cloud storage as a drive, I might have tried Mountain Duck or one of its rivals for my Google Drive and I haven't found a free one for Windows..

I guess here is a suggestion on this feature could be implemented:\nExpert Mode:\n- allow configurable path for masterkey.cryptomator\n- if the user chooses this mode, they accept that the \"vault\" will not work with mobiles etc\n- in desktop mode it could be a command line option if you dont want to clutter and confuse the GUI\n- mobile app can choose to have or not have the option to allow a configurable key\n.

    "0xdf": "I think there is a misunderstanding about this issue. The reporter (and other people, linking to this issue) seem to assume that the encryption key is stored in the vault. While the file name suggests this, it is not true. The key is merely stored in encrypted form (just like all the content in the vault). This is not a security issue, because if the cloud provider could break the encryption, he might as well decrypt the files directly.\nThe security, however, depends on the strength of the password used. Scrypt provides some protection against brute forcing it, but a weak password could still be cracked easily. In my opinion when a strong master password is used (ideally with the same length/entropy as the encryption key itself), moving the encrypted encryption key outside of the vault does not increase security at all.\n. There are no hashes of keys in the file. The primaryMasterKey and hmacMasterKey fields are encrypted values. See https://cryptomator.org/architecture/.\n. ",
    "DanielGilbert": "While I agree with 0xdf, for peace of mind and extra security, it might be an idea to replace the \"hash\"-string with an encrypted passphrase instead, like TrueCrypt is working with it's container header.\nSo, instead of primaryMasterKey being the hash and testing against that, one could think of storing the phrase \"this is an awesome tool\", and putting that, encrypted with the password, into the primaryMasterKey variable. Now, when checking the password, rather than comparing hashes, we would try to decrypt the primaryMasterKey and see if the content fits.\nThis would have the benefit that a potential attacker doesn't have the hash of the password, in case scrypt ever gets compromised or hacked. Oh, and btw, bruteforce would be slowed down, because we actually need to decrypt the content, and not just compare hashes.\n. Yepp, I noticed that now. I was under a wrong impression. Looks like the naming is a little bit \"misleading\", although correct from a technical view. Dunno, maybe not calling it \"masterkey\" might help. Well, users are weird sometimes.\nAnyway, the architecture looks good so far.\n. ",
    "DJSarus": "Hi,\nI would like to support this request. As I trust the users of my computer (only me ;-) ) more as I trust nosy cloud providers as e.g. dropbox.\nSo it would make it possible to work with unsecure/short passwords and the security of the data in the cloud would not be affected.\n. ",
    "jordanbtucker": "I came here to request this as well.\nI like the idea of having a type of two factor authentication: something you know (passphrase) + something you have (masterkey file).\nYou could store the master key on a portable drive so that your Cryptomator vaults would only be accessible with the drive present. (Of course you'd want to make a secure backup of the masterkey in case you lose the portable drive.)\n\nThe security, however, depends on the strength of the password used. Scrypt provides some protection against brute forcing it, but a weak password could still be cracked easily. In my opinion when a strong master password is used (ideally with the same length/entropy as the encryption key itself), moving the encrypted encryption key outside of the vault does not increase security at all.\n\nAlthough moving the encrypted encryption key to outside the vault does not increase security, the scrypt salt stored in the masterkey file is 64 bits of entropy that the attacker must know in addition to the password, so moving this data to outside the vault would increase security somewhat.. @Riajyuu why did you tag me?.

    "red-ochre": "Personally, I like that you need to actually unlock a newly created vault. This gives me confidence that I have the password correctly remembered from when I created the vault. If this feature wasn't there, I would immediately lock and unlock the vault to do that check. \n. Yes, I do remember noticing that after creating a new vault, the process immediately jumped to unlocking the new vault without actually saying that the creation process was successful. I just assumed that that meant that the creation worked but it would be nice have that stated.\n. Thx. Yes, I just tried again and the tooltip did show up when hovering over the vault name. However, I hadn't noticed that before - probably because the hover text doesn't show up immediately and, after it does, it disappears quite quickly as well. An \"open vault location\" option on the context menu would certainly be helpful.\n. I just had another look at the GUI, trying to understand how it works. (I'm on a Mac OS X 10.11.3)\nI can now see why I was missing something. When I select one of the vaults on left panel, I get the right panel filled in with some detail - really just the opportunity to enter the password. And then, from what you told me earlier, if I right click the name of the vault, I get a context menu as well. This is what had me confused. This is just my opinion, so please correct me, but my understanding of context menus is that they add the capability to perform extra tasks specific to a particular item. This is helpful when there is no other way to give the user those extra options. However, in this case we have the right panel where any extra tasks could be listed. My preference would be to have all options available for a vault shown on the right panel. This way we wouldn't have to guess if an option was going to be in the right panel or on the context menu.\nOne reason I bring this up is that I wanted to change the password to one of my vaults and it took me a while find that I needed to right click on the vault name, even after I had selected the vault but couldn't find that option in the right panel.\nAs we have talked before, the hover text could be used as a quick way to tell where the encrypted vault was located and then a new option on the right panel could say 'here is where your vault is' and click here to open it in 'Finder'.\nThe other options on the context menu: 'remove from list' and 'change password' could be on the right panel where we can see them clearly.\nSummary: If there is a right panel, then the context menu is redundant and should not be used as it just adds confusion.\nAgain, forgive me if this isn't what you had intended. These are just my thoughts because I had trouble finding how to do things.\n. ",

I've encountered the same bug as described above, running Cryptomator 1.2.3 on Fedora 24. When vault is open, the program eats RAM and eventually the system freezes and the program crashes. Would love to see this fixed, as it renders the program unusable. . If I may ask, because the heap size is only a part of the memory an application uses, shouldn't -XX:MaxPermSize and -Xss be used besides -Xmx? . I've had the same problem on macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 using WebDav however, after seeing this post, I've installed the Cryptomator-1.4.0-beta2.dmg and now using the FUSE file system instead. \nSo far, so good. No recurring issues while using VIM file editor from the command line. I'm backing up locally and will report back if further issues arise.. Now with FUSE file system, I can edit happily however, Autosave function in my iA Writer app keeps throwing up message:\n\"The document \"\" could not be autosaved. The file has been changed by another application\"\n\nOpened new issue 737. Works again @ 10.12.5 beta 3!.

Seems like it is a old one JDK-8034057 and was fixed on JDK 9.. Hi, today It works. lol\nI don't know if it was due a GFS update, or a Windows Update.\nI'm currently using the Cryptomator 1.3.3\n\nUPDATE:\nI don't even need to enable the \"available offline\" option.. I'm using 25.157.165.2150\nI'm using dual boot with Linux, so only once a week I'm logging into Windows. The update was automatically, I don't remember to put to update manually. Only the Windows I make sure to check for new updates.. May I suggest that the name of this file and particularly, the field name \"primaryMasterKey\" does not reflect the fact that it's value is actually AES encrypted with the users passphrase.\nSomething like, \"encryptedPrimaryMasterKey\" or \"securedPrimaryMasterKey\" would alleviate this ambiguity and the security concerns the name raises to those not  familiar with the applications security architecture.\nAdditionally, having this metadata held with the data itself, while convenient, gives anyone wanting to compromise the encryption, much information regarding the exact encryption methods implemented. Information, that would otherwise be difficult, if not impossible to derive from the encrypted data itself.\nHaving this information could enable script-kiddies to use tools which may utilize any future exploits found in the libraries used. A more secure approach is to have the encryption metadata (inc. key) backed up someplace else like the users hard drive and additionally, some cloud server. \nThe cloud storage does not need to be an expensive HSM key server, any high availability cloud storage service would do for this use case given that an assailent who might gain access to these key files (themselves already encrypted) would have no way to tie them to the users personal cloud storage account and the individual Cryptomator volumes held therein. \nFor example, Boxcryptor saves the encryption keys and metadata onto the users hard drive and additionally onto their own cloud based server. As the files are tiny, the storage space requirements are minimal.. Please see my updated comment regarding the virtues of storing the key metadata on another server and users hard drive for back.\nI think this software is very well packages overall which is why I'm making these suggestions. Good point regarding the user knowing this is an important file, however, the I stick by my comment regarding the naming of the \"primaryMasterKey\".. PCI-DSS 3.5.2 requirement:\nEncrypted with a key-encrypting key that is at least as strong as the data-encrypting key, and that is \u201cstored separately\u201d from the data encrypting key.\nDisscusion thread: \nhttps://security.stackexchange.com/questions/52377/what-does-the-pci-dss-statement-store-separately-from-the-data-encrypting-key\nAnother example from: https://product.reverb.com/encryption-on-rails-a-primer-b634d2ba3b24\nThe Data Encryption Key (DEK) encrypts your data, and a second key\u200a\u2014\u200athe Key Encryption Key (KEK) in turn encrypts the DEK. \u201cThese 2 keys should be stored in separate locations as an added layer of security.\u201d\nThis is dabatable however, but it is a \u201cbest practice\u201d and also part of PCI DSS.. The subject of my original issue ticket has been resolved since it is clear from the reply that the primaryMaster key is in fact the password encrypted KEK. The ticket has been closed. \nMy additional comments where to do with a) naming convention (which I still think could be clearer) and b) my comment more on a general design philosophy which adds extra layers of security (i.e. storing all metadata physically else where) as per best practice in PCI DSS for example. \nAn architecture which keeps the encrypted KEK with the data relies on one  premise, that Colin Percival\u2018s scrypt PBKD library will stay uncrackable/flawless for ever or that computational power required to crack it is unavailable. Both of these are probably true for the forceable immediate future.\nI would still change the name of the \u201cprimaryMasterKey\u201d but other then that, a very nice bit of software.. The readme entry ideas is a good one - with perhaps a link to the security architecture page or someplace that explains why it is safe. You don't want perspective clients/users to turn away due to lack of confidence, uncertainty or suspicion in the product.. Not sure from the commit log what the fix was exactly but I can however confirm that it seems iA Writer is unable to actually create its temp autosave files. These files normally start with the dot and underscore (._) characters followed by the filename that is being edited. \nLooking into the Cryptomator volume, I see that there are no longer any such files accompanying the file being edited - which would explain the error message the application is throwing.\nWhat's more is that if I try and create a file in the mounted Cryptomator volume following that naming convention used by iA Writer on the command line using touch \\._TEST it fails with touch: cannot touch '._TEST': No such file or directory but succeeds on any other volume.\nNOTE: I can however, create a file with a dot (.) prefix in the Cryptomator volume, just not a dot and underscore (._) prefix .\n.

    "boboG": "Try OSXFUSE as a frontend: https://osxfuse.github.io/\n. You might want to talk to Rian Hunter. He created \"Safe\" (does anybody know this file encryption app?) which also uses WebDAV and not FUSE. Maybe he wants to share thoughts. -> http://www.getsafe.org/about\n. Tried a local vault (not on Dropbox): same result. All .xlsx-Files are kaputt. :-/\n. When I copy the file from the vault (the WebDAV \"drive\") back to a local location it can be openend. So it has to do with Excel trying to read from the vaults WebDAV drive.\n. As a Mac user you know that the user frontend is everything. The rest is behind the scenes stuff for technicians. Not supporting (or getting along well with) Excel is a very serious issue I think. (I know it is not your fault.)\n. At least one can use LibreOffice to work with the files.\n. Now that MS issued the new 64-bit Office applications I thought I'd give it another try.\nI can now open .xlsx files in Excel 15 and Excel 14. Excel 15 always creates a file with a tilde in the same directory (Test 1.xlsx -> ~$Test 1.xlsx) and says the the Excel file is read-only. Excel 14 does not do this. But after Excel 15 has accessed a file the tilde file stays and Excel 14 from now on also says the file in now read-only. Removing the tilde file brings everythings back to the initial situation.\nSo:\n- Excel 15 cannot write to files (and therefore cannot corrupt them... :->)\n- Excel 14 does work fine unless the file has been opened with Excel 15\n- Libre Office works just fine\nMac OS X 10.11.6, Crytomator 1.1.4, Excel 15.25.1 (Office 2016, 64 bit), Excel 14.6.7 (Office 2011)\n.

    "PKizzle": "With the support of FUSE, it might be possible to get Spotlight indexing to work.\nIt is necessary to mount the volume in /Volumes though.\nTake a look at: https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/252#issuecomment-208411626.\nSo is it possible to either make this the default location or allow to manually set mount location?. This issue seems to be solved: https://github.com/osxfuse/sshfs/issues/27#issuecomment-313798090. I manually created a mount point inside /Volumes and sadly Spotlight is not working out of the box.\nWhen I try to manually enable Spotlight indexing I receive an error message.\nError: unable to perform operation.  Try as root.  (-400)\n    Error: unknown indexing state.\nIf I try as root:\nError: could not resolve path. Maybe this part from the osxfuse FAQ is helpful:\n\n4.5. I am trying to access a \"FUSE for OS X\" volume but I keep getting access/permission denied errors. I am doing this as root - what is going on? Is not everything allowed as root?\n\nFor several reasons, by default, \"FUSE for OS X\" allows access to a volume only to the user who mounted the volume. All other users, including the superuser are denied access. You can change this behavior if you need to. Refer to the allow_other and allow_root mount-time options.\n\n4.6. Can I enable Spotlight on a \"FUSE for OS X\" file system?\n\nYes, but by default, Spotlight processes running as root would not be able to access the volume, so you have to use certain mount-time options. See the answer to the previous question.\n\n\nSource. Okay. So I was able to fix it by manually downloading jdk-10.0.1.jdk and replacing the bundled libjli.dylib  with that jdk version. Somehow the bundled version seems to be newer than jdk-10.0.1. Can anyone confirm this problem?. I am still unable to open the app by double clicking the app icon. Although launch via terminal works perfectly fine. This seems to be a macOS security feature. If I run sudo xattr -cr /path/to/Cryptomator.appthe app launches without any problems.. Now everything works as expected. Then you'll have to fix the new build script. Should I leave the issue open until you corrected it?. ",

But files are only 0 bytes in size.\nWhen i just dragdrop files in there without crytomator, they are send to the Amazondrive (checked via browser and also downloaded)\nThank for your help - and thanks for your support for the software (using it a long time now on windows)\n.

Ok it looks like it was just Nautilus that hung because every write operation returned errors because the tmp files took up all available space. I will change the issue title to \"Out-of-space errors leave .tmp files behind\".\n. Sounds good! Just FYI, I have now published the comparison at https://nuetzlich.net/gocryptfs/comparison/ . Feel free to contact me if I misrepresent cryptomator somewhere.\n. Updated, thanks. The bounds seem to high, though - note that I have used 1,000,000 bytes, not 1MiB.\n. Lower bound looks good, but I see files as big as 1100872 bytes in a directory with 1000 files: \n/tmp/cm-big.cryptomator/d/AV/WYUDCHTYRZKSKXEMDTGUEL6MFOJ3NQK2WNIG3WINZXAHQNHHNQ====$ ls -lS\ntotal 1029836\n-rw-------. 1 jakob jakob 1100872  5.

    "shaiguitar": "I'm seeing this ( ls: .: Too many open files in system ) in OSX using 1.4.1 with WebDav adapter. Seems re-produceable. This was not an issue in prior versions.. The vault that directory is in is relatively large ( GB size wise and file wise ). However I get that message if I attempt to ls a dir with 75 files in it. I originally got this trying to save a file via emacs and it's possible emacs projectile is scanning many files in that project and therefore opening too many handles. I wouldn't have thought WebDav has a limit. I'm not particularly sure what emacs is trying to do behind the scenes but if it's touching other files, it shouldn't be opening but just scanning them in any case, I imagine something like find..

Anyway, solved now - thanks!\n\n. I have to reopen the issue again because the same error occurs again after I had successfully created a vault.\nNow I have a vault with some much needed data in it but can not open it because the same error occurs again  - this sucks big time!

At home (location) now I do not have any proxies set and Cryptomator opens the vault without problems. At work (location) I do have an automatic proxy set to access our university library, so this might have been a problem (the error occurred when I tried at work). I will try at work on Monday if this proxy connection interfers.\n. Yes, I can now confirm that it is the automatic proxy setting that causes the trouble.\nIf I disable it then Cryptomator opens the vault fine, if the proxy is enabled it asks for username/password for server \"localhost\" and does not accept anything.\nCan this be fixed?\n. This at least does not work.\nAny other way to exclude localhost?\n\n. I can not do that because it is a URL (http://xxx.lrz.de) that I have to specify. No access to a PAC file unfortunately.\n. having said that, when I type the automatic proxy URL in a browser the following is returned:\nfunction FindProxyForURL(url, host)\n{\n      return \"DIRECT\";\n}\n. misunderstanding. This is not a script, it looks like this in my configuration:\n(however, it has not kept localhost that I typed in yesterday, there is something else there now)\n\n. maybe this is because I am now at home and not in university network.\nI just tried via VPN to the University network and it is then full of text (with domains and other stuff).\nI am not posting the file here but I am happy to send this to you in separate email (need your email address though).\n. No. strangely enough with VPN from home (but network location WORK with proxy set) it works.\nRelated to the above: I previously just tried to access the proxy via VPN to get that file content, I did not check Cryptomator, did that now. All very confusing.\nI will have to test from work next week again.\nHappy Easter!\n. ",

If I simply click the login button without typing in a password, the decrypted vault is eventually mounted, but my /Volumes directory is littered with directories like \"cloud\" \"cloud-1\" \"cloud-2\" \"cloud-3\" etc. and the final mount ends up on /Volumes/cloud-4. I should mention that prior to attempting the mount the /Volumes directory was empty, so this isn't a case of directories being created because there was a previously created directory with the same name.\nHere is an example of what results after unlocking a vault with a clean /Volumes directory.

    "jellemdekker": "Thoughts for implementation:\n- All clients should register a file association for .cryptomator files during installation.\n- Even though a masterkey.cryptomator file does not contain identifying information about which vault to reveal, the location of this file does.. I have started to work on this feature.. I'm interested in working on this feature. What kind of implementation is preferred? I propose the following options:\n\nInstead of opening https://cryptomator.org/, the following code is expanded to open the appropriate download URL for the current operating system's latest version. Example for macOS: opening https://bintray.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/download_file?file_path=Cryptomator-1.3.2.dmg.\nInstead of opening browser windows, Cryptomator downloads the appropriate installation file and presents it to the user by showing the folder where it was downloaded to (opening a window in Windows Explorer, Finder, Linux file browsers, or simply linking to the file's location in a dialog box).\nExpanding on option 2: open the downloaded installation file and close Cryptomator, so the user can proceed with installing the latest version (might be more complex because of platform dependent code for starting an installation, also needs to account for portable installations).\n\nPlease let me know what your thoughts are on these options and feel free to make suggestions for different approaches.. I have started to work on this. Will post back in a day or two with a pull request.. I think it's already possible to do this with the current code by updating line 44 in DirectoryListCell.java to something like the following:\nif (Vault::getWinDriveLetter != null) {\n    nameText.textProperty().bind(EasyBind.monadic(itemProperty()).flatMap(Vault::getWinDriveLetter + \" \" + Vault::name));\n} else {\n    nameText.textProperty().bind(EasyBind.monadic(itemProperty()).flatMap(Vault::name));\n}\nThis code might need to be modified before it works, I haven't tried it myself yet.\nAlternatively, you could opt to create a new method driveLetterAndName() similar to Vault.java's name() that returns the same piece of text with the Windows drive letter and vault name.. I am unable to reproduce this bug, can anyone else give it a try?\nMy steps (on Windows 10 Pro v1803):\n1. Create a new vault in Cryptomator (to prevent messing up other vaults).\n2. Open the Snipping tool.\n3. Take a snip by clicking the New Snip button.\n4. Save the snip by clicking Save Snip.\n5. Navigate to the new vault in the Save As dialog.\n6. Create two folders called FolderA and FolderB.\n7. Drag FolderA into FolderB.\n8. Confirm that FolderB is now no longer in the vault's root directory.\n9. Navigate inside FolderA and confirm that FolderB is present.\n10. Navigate inside FolderB and confirm that it is empty.\n11. Navigate back to the vault's root directory.\n12. Save the snip as snip.png and close Snipping tool.\n13. Lock the new vault and exit Cryptomator.\n14. Start Cryptomator again and unlock the new vault.\n15. Open snip.png and confirm that its contents are okay.\n16. Navigate inside FolderA and confirm that FolderB is present.\n17. Navigate inside FolderB and confirm that FolderB is empty.. @overheadhunter Do you know if there are any graphic designers at Skymatic that can help with making the unlocked versions for the tray icons for macOS?. I've made the requested changes. I did have one thought, though. I've added strings to the localization file for the English language, do these new strings also have to be added to the other languages or does this happen automatically?. @overheadhunter Perhaps you would like to add a comment block with license information to the AutoFilledSecPasswordFieldSkin class. Also, do you have any instructions for compiling and running Cryptomator from the IDE (in my case IntelliJ)? I'm unable to complete a Maven build, so I cannot test this code myself at the moment.. Done. I changed it, is this better?. Thank you, I've refactored it.. I've updated the code so that 'Force shutdown' is now the default option. I did originally have 'Try again' as the default option, so the user never accidentally shuts down Cryptomator and loses data if they fat-finger their keyboard on the alert dialog.

    "wezeku": "I have the same problem on Windows 10 x64 (tested with antivirus disabled). Also, the icons of exe files are missing and just the blank unknown-document-type icon is displayed.\n\nmarkuskreusch: \"Interestingly this does not happen with other exe files so seems to be something specific to the used file.\"\n\nI've made some tests and sometimes you can copy an exe file that runs ok, but the copy of the file won't run or be deleted. I just had an exe file that could neither be deleted from the explorer, nor from the terminal. 5 minutes later I could delete it, so it's hard to predict.\nMS WebDAV treats exe files differently from other files (https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc779784(v=ws.10).aspx, near the bottom of the page), but I suppose that's not relevant for the component used by Cryptomator.\n. I just ran into PanBox issue 70. According to that, there are some severe Dokan limitations, for example the inability to run executables (e.g. portable apps) from Dokan drives, and Git repos not working on them. So unfortunately, Dokan seems to have it's own problems.\nBTW, if Dokan is to be used, couldn't JNI/CNI be used instead of a Java reimplementation, or would the JNI overhead make it too slow?\n. Thanks for the clarification and the detailed info. I misunderstood and thought you were planning to rewrite DokanFuse itself in Java, but I see from your use of fuse-jna that this was not the case. So, forget my comment about JNI/CNI :-)\n. I've written about some stability observations I made using encfs4win, which uses Dokany. Not sure exactly which issues are due to encfs4win and which are caused by Dokany, but the observations may be of use to you nonetheless: https://github.com/jetwhiz/encfs4win/issues/62\nIn short, the main issues were sudden unmounts (when cloning repos with Mercurial) and residual files left when deleting directory trees.\n.

    "An-error-occurred": "Same problem here, by the way, but it has alread been discussed.. Hey there!\nI do not have 1.3, I'm still working with 1.2.3 (Onedrive)! Still, Office files won't load.\nHere are my observations:\nA)\nI've installed Cryptomator on my desktop PC (Win10 Pro 1703; Build 15063.413) and own the most recent Office 365.\n-> NO ISSUES*\nB)\nCryptomator on my Surface (exactly the same Win and Office):\n-> OFFICE FILES DO NOT OPEN\nPictures will load and if I copy the office file to another folder outside the vault, I can read and edit the files. The error reads: \"[Pfad] konnte leider nicht ge\u00f6ffnet werden\"\nHowever, here's the interesting thing: If I go online with my Surface, the problem goes away! *I haven't tested it with my desktop PC.\nYou've still got my email-address, so if you need further testing or spcific logs from both my PCs, drop me a line.. Same issue. I've sent you the log from my surface.. I've used two different email-addresses by accident, sorry.\nIf you don't find the log, I'll send it again. I've opened a new issue.. Additional info:\nI disabled the Office Synchronisation in Onedrive (Office Upload Centre): OneDrive Properties -> Office -> Office-Dateien, die ich \u00f6ffne, mit Office 2016 synchronisieren.\nIn principal, it didn't change anything. However, I could open two documents and they now stated that they are offline copies from a server version that might be newer. Which doesn't phase me at all, but I had access at least!\nI don't know why only these two files could be opened inside the vault and I can't say if it has st to do with the Upload Centre. The rest still does not open.. Hey guys,\nthe problem persists and I would very much appreciate a fix. As a teacher responsible for data security, I am going to suggest using Cryptomator in our school and I am preparing a presentation on handling sensitive data in the classroom. If I advise my colleagues to follow my example, it would be great if this bug could be eradicated, because as you cannot be online in every room, you sometimes need to open Office files offline from the vault, which doesn't work yet.\nAny thoughts on that?. I see your point and although it does look like Office is at fault, it doesn't change the fact that working straight out of a vault doesn't work with Cryptomator and the workaround is a bit of a hassle...\nI'll try and kill this upload centre... and keep waiting for the update. Thanks for getting back in touch.. All right, maybe this helps you: After some testing, I could effectively disable / kill the dreadful Upload Center using this hint and my Comodo Firewall: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2016-officeapps/office-2016-upload-center-how-do-i-get-rid-of-it/e471b430-d940-4b6c-88ec-af0336cd3e93?auth=1\nNow it does not start anymore when I try to open or save an Office Document. However, the error still pops up.. Thank you for your trouble. To answer your questions:\n0) I'm currently using 1.3.1 on both my PC and Surface (auto-update is enabled).\n1) I use the most up-to-date version of Office 365 on both devices.\n2) By \"offline\" I mean when there's no available WiFi-network or when I disconnect from my home WiFi. The same result if I disable the WiFi-device altogether.\n3) There's the Windows Firewall and Comodo active on my PC but there's only the Windows Firewall on my Surface. Even if I disable both, there is no change in behaviour. BUT:\nInterestingly enough, the documents that I could not open and I then copied to the Desktop and - after working with them - back into my vault, DO open. MS word says: \"Dies ist eine Offlinekopie des Serverdokuments, die am 12.09.2017 um 12:20 Uhr aktuell war.\" Word files I have not copied and used to replace the original file in the vault still give out the error.. Hey there,\nit's Office 365 Home. I tried it when logged in with my MS Account and when not logged in. No difference.. Here's more info that might prove helpful:\nIf there's no WiFi-connection: Problem as described in great detail.\nIf there's faulty WiFi-connection, meaning: the PC can access the router but NOT the internet, the problem is apparently gone! I found out by accident, as my provider had scheduled some maintenance and I was offline but WiFi was on -> I could open all files.. bump\nIt's still an issue.. New info: Interestingly, only Drag&Drop gives me the error. Copying / moving by keyboard works. But as I prefer mouse-based copying, it still sucks. Any ideas here?. As I said, I tried the same thing. My link above suggests this solution, too. Apparently, a restart is not needed. I've tried a whole list of things:\n\\127.0.0.1\n\\127.0.0.1@42427\nthe drive letter\n...\nNothing seems to work. I disabled Windows Firewall and manually changed every \"Internet Security\" setting manually to the lowest protection level - it didn't affect the error in any way. If there's st. else I can do / try out, give me a whistle.\nEDIT: I've just completed the more sophisticated way described here:\n\nYou can control this with Group Policy, as well. Use gpedit.msc and drill down to\n\nUser Configuration \u2192 Policies \u2192 Administrative Templates \u2192 Windows Components \u2192 Internet Explorer \u2192 Internet Control Panel \u2192 Security Page\n\nEnable \"Intranet Zone Template\" with the Low option.\n\nThen enable \"Site to Zone Assignment List\" and use the Show button to add your \"sites\" (servername, servername.domain, ipaddress - the values you enter depend on what name or IP you use to access the share) with a value of 1.\n\nLastly - and this is the most important step - drill down one folder in gpedit to \"Intranet Zone\" and enable for \"Show security warning for potentially unsafe files\", choosing Enable from the drop-down.\n\nClose gpedit, reboot or run gpupdate /force and enjoy no more annoying Windows Security dialogues!\n\n\nBut, sadly, still nothing.. Hello there. The log file reminds me of mine, which I have just uploaded here. The difference is I am using a regular Win 10. I am starting to think it wasn't my fault.... I figured as much. I've tried net use before and it said No Entries In This List. When I click Disconnet Net Drives, there are none. But when I try to connect a net drive, it will work flawlessly with the webdav-url. net use then shows one drive.\nOh, yeah, reinstalling Cryptomator didn't do anything.. I'm a bit confused now as the error persists after a new win installation... is it maybe a cryptomator issue after all?\nEdit:  Here is the log\ncryptomator.log\nEdit2:\nI found this link: https://community.cryptomator.org/t/connecting-drive-failed-system-error-53-with-windows-insider-preview/48/3 <- same issue\nI tried troubleshooting it (w/o the Windows checklist) -> registry entry is there.\nNew vaults didn't work either, btw.\nHowever, right now, everything seems fine. I can't pin down why it sometimes doesn't work (no matter how often I reconnect or restart my Surface) and then again it just does what it was intended to do.. Hi guys, and sorry for bumping the thread.\nBut new and potentially important info: It clearly depends on my online status, I can reproduce the problem again and again.\nWifi connection on -> no drive letter will be assigned; error!\nI disable wifi -> mounting works like a charm.\nI disabled and enabled the win firewall, it didn't change anything.\nMy workaround is to leave wifi off, until I can mount, then turn it on before the upstream-bug kicks in that won't allow me to open an Office doc... see https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/527. This isssue is also connected to whether or not I am online.\nAny thoughts?\nEdit: See edits in my last post. There's a log, too.\nEdit 2: never mind that workaround, see screenshot.\n\n. I don't know what that is... and it was a new installation. I haven't changed anything... it works fine on my desktop PC : (. I am again experiencing the issue. I completely reinstalled my Surface from scratch (!) and thought it would solve everything and it did keep working fine for a few days.\nIt must be a bug, because while being mounted and while synching, the content of the mounted drive suddenly disappeared and when I disconnectd the drive to remount it, the original error popped up again.\nClean, fresh win10!\nI am getting a bit frustrated, since I am heavily relying on Cryptomator and my worklflow is being interrupted : (\nCould it be that there is a problem with Onedrive being on an SD-card? I am currently changing my directory back to the SSD. Let's see what happens.... bump\nIt's still an issue.. Sorry for the duplicate - I figured I needed a new one since this only referred to the Beta.. Hi there, thanks for the answer! I'm pretty dependent on Cryptomator and I don't want to risk anything by using the beta. Since it's a minor issue, I'll just wait until the stable release. Thanks anyway!. Yes, it is working (WebDav) and I'm happy. I would have checked with Dokany, but as it is incredibly slow (see https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/711) I haven't done so.. Update: Office files will load, when Windows timeline is used, BUT:\nMy default browser is opened and the .docx (for example) is prompted as \"download\" or \"open with\". Essentialy, I cannot use timeline.\nTwo more things: PDF files from a vault will not be displayed in the timeline and it used to work in earlier versions (I think before 1.3).\nAny input would be appreciated since this is really limiting.. Thanks for the update! Here's mine from yesterday's re-release of Win 1809 (not the old one that MS had to stop due to file losses):\nThe same error from in my initial post came back; long MS Word loading screen, then the error, document won't open. I tried it again and (also with Excel) then the timeline behaves as described in here: Browser opens and offers the \"download\" / \"open with\" dialogue. But somehow it first got the idea that the files should have been opened with MS Office.\nYes, 1803 worked like a charm.. Yes, Office always seems to be the culprit. I uninstalled Firefox to force timeline to reassign an app and it got me this screen (see below). When I clicked on \"Windows Store\" it suggested programmes for \"http\" - clearly, the path to my vaults (http) is recognised as a web-address and, accordingly, wants to be opened by a browser.\nHowever, PDFs will load just fine (Nitro Pro 7) within the same vault.\n\n. Without wanting to be pushy... has anything come up regarding this issue? I read in another thread that one of you guys now own an Office 365 licence and maybe the problem has already been solved after some testing and the solution will be included in the next release.\nTimeline is a powerful feature and not being able to use it is somewhat of a huge letdown.... No, stale bot, don't close! It's an important issue ; )\noverheadhunter, you wrote that it's up to the OS and that might be true (it probably is, I've got no idea). Still, Dokany is unusably slow (and shows the exact same error) and the fact that I can't use this powerful feature is impeding my workflow to a point where I would give Boxcryptor a chance, although I don't really want to : (\n. Although I understand your perspective as a developer, this isn't the client's perspective. We both know that opening an issue at MS won't do a thing. And why would MS go at great lengths to ensure compatibilty with a third-party software? After all, everything worked well in previous versions and you must have somehow adapted to Windows' standards before. As a layman, I do not understand what you actually do, so the best I can contribute is providing error feedback.. Good point. I'll do it, but I have contributed far bigger issues there and nothing has changed yet. But still, I'll try. Thanks for the input.. Copy&Pasting as a workaround?. Hi there. I'm not sure whether I need to open a new thread or if it's okay here (many of the old topics have benn closed);\nI'm still having performance issues with Dokany (cryptomator 1.4.2). It's just way too slow compared to WebDav.. Hi there. The issue persists with 1.4.4. It might be relevant to security because although all three vaults are locked you can still see the drive in the explorer - with files and everything. Cryptomator displays everything as inactive, which is misleading and potentially very dangerous.. No, not that I know... I disconnected the drive and now after a reboot it's gone. If it shows up again, I'll try your idea. Thanks. . ",

My 2 cents: A password file that only root can read (root:700) and -p parameter could be enough.\n. @heinrich-ulbricht Apart from using system keystore, I don't know how you could pass password to automated command without providing it on a file. Do you have any idea?\n. I'm not sure I'm understanding your comments. Please, correct me if I'm wrong:\n- To open a vault, cryptomator requires a password\n- To automatically open a vault you need to \"pass a parameter\" to cryptomator\n- You are proposing to use a \"shared memory\" pointer, and let cryptomator \"read it\".\nPlease, tell me when/how do you fill that memory (and what happens if computer is restarted) and how will you achieve Java to read that pointer.\nI still prefer \"root-only\" files as a portable solution, or keystores.\n. Hi\nAlthough NTFS is case sensitive, Windows it isn't, so I won't let having same named files (or file-directory) on that OS.\nFurthermore, as this is a multi-platform cloud oriented software than can be used from different OS, this could raise a bunch of problems if different-case files are uploaded using Linux, but can't be downloaded on Windows.\nFor that reason, IMHO CryptoFS should be case insensitive. Hope Linux/OSX guys understand this...\n. @overheadhunter Wouldn't that could cause problems syncing locally?\nLet me try to explain myself:\nUnix computer creates a vault which contains a.log and A.log, syncing them to cloud\nWindows computer sync to cloud, open vault and mounts to X:\nHow will Windows handle X:\\a.log and X:\\A.log if it is a case-insensitive OS?\n. > Will have to test that \n\nWindows won't be able to handle that, so -IMHO- you shouldn't support case-sensitive.\nAn example: http://serverfault.com/questions/323179/filename-case-issue-with-over-webdav\n\nI wouldn't bet Windows will like case insensitive filenames mounted with Dokany either.\n. Just to sum up, please correct me if I'm wrong:\nFS encryption is done using a key, which is wrapped using a password. Without the password, you can't get the key, hence can't decrypt FS.\nAt this moment, key is typed on a pretty textbox, which is exposed to keylogger attacks.\nThis issues is aimed to improve \"authentication mechanism\" to prevent those.\nThe main problem as @overheadhunter exposed is that you have to \"link\" key, password and token.\nIn other words, if you have the following code:\nString p=read_password();\nint r=invoke_2fa();\nif(r==0) decrypt_key_FS(p);\nYou are screwed, because anyone could omit 2FA and it will work.\nInstead of that you need something like:\n\nplease_mr_token_decrypt_this_key(wrapped_key)\n\nWhich is usually done storing unwrapping key within an smartcard, which, based on my experience is a real pain.\nIt's also possible to store encryption keys on local/OS keystore, sometimes protecting them with a password...and even -if your system supports it- it can be integrated with tokens/2FA.\nWe could have a look on how FIDO key provisioning work (to store the encryption key on it), but we should consider keys won't be extractable, so it won't be possible to \"decrypt\" the hole FS tree at once...\nBut, to be honest, I don't think this is something on the \"medium-term roadmap\". Perhaps not even in the long-term.\n. ",

But it seems like this is related to the FUSE mount implementation. So just wanted to check in and say +1 for preserving the created/modified timestamps/attributes. It's a big factor for me being unable to use cryptomator as my main cloud encryption tool\nThis issue is over a year old so it seems to have stalled. Any updates on providing fuse mount capability on MacOS? Its been over a year since this was raised discussed so it seems like this isn't a priority anymore. @dodekeract Hey that sounds like a really interesting solution and one I didn't even think of!! I have the same concern as @Trebuin though because I have many files that I would like to encrypt (let's say a full photo library and movie collection) ranging in TB+ size. So I could throw that all in a sparse bundle and then would like to read/write files to the sparse bundle. So I'm hoping that I wouldn't have to download/transmit the entire sparse bundle locally before I can mount it and browse/read/write. This is the problem with something like veracrypt/truecrypt when stored on the cloud. Have you used sparse bundles with an online storage before?\nI'm hoping to use the encrypted folder it in conjunction with Google File Stream though, so hopefully File Stream doesn't retransmit the entire sparse bundle when I just add a single file to the sparse bundle!\nEnd goal: have files directly stored online without a local copy and have those files encrypted but browsable locally and ideally no system timestamps etc changed when adding files (FUSE mounts respect this). So cryptomator/mountain duck had come to mind.\nWill have to test this out as well\n. @dodekeract I have done a fair amount of testing now with encrypted sparsebundles on Mac (including in the new Mac APFS format) and it is working well. This entirely replaces the need for cryptomator for me for now since cryptomator does not support High Sierra (due to Mac WebDAV bug #579) and also cryptomator does not preserve the timestamps of created/modified on files or folders (again I webDAV issue I believe #220). Once FUSE is implemented then I will look at cryptomator again as I would like to use it\n@Trebuin I am using sparse bundles instead of cryptomator now based on @dodekeract 's suggestion and it is working well. A 3TB sparse bundle isn't a problem if you just add a single file to it. It does not retransmit everything, just the added file. You shouldn't mount and read/write from more than one source at the same time though as that can corrupt it, but otherwise all works well.. @overheadhunter thanks for the update on the fuse progress! I think a lot of people are looking forward to a fuse implementation - issues #579 and #220 that should be fixed with fuse are big for me and made me look to alternative options instead of cryptomator. Hi, just chiming in to say that I experienced the same thing but it is not under high load. Just editing a normal Excel document that is located in a vault.\nI am able to reproduce it every time with the following scenario:\n1. Using High Sierra General Release latest version (10.13 fully upgraded)\n2. Using Cryptomator latest version fully upgraded 1.3.1 (1007)\n3. Using Google Drive File Stream latest version - 25.1.76.2046 - google drive is mounted.\n4. Create new vault on the mounted Google drive folder with cryptomator\n5. Open vault\n6. Open up Microsoft Excel for Mac v 15.13.3 (Office 2015)\n7. Create a new Excel document, enter some text and save it to the vault. Leave Excel open.\n8. Wait for a few minutes, and the vault will no longer be visible/mounted\n9. If point 7 above does not occur, save Excel file again\nOtherwise cryptomator seems to be working and the vault is mounting is working on Google file stream\n. I'm getting the same behavior that @skaeight is mentioning. Previously I thought it was just excel, but it is high load. If I try to copy large files, it always dismounts and crashes mid copy.\nWould love to see this fixed as it has essentially rendered cryptomator useless for me right now. Hey @t0rv1c Thanks for posting too. A number of users including myself are able to instantly reproduce this bug on demand on High Sierra. I pretty much have the exact same problem as you if you see my comments above. Currently this bug has made it impossible for me to use Cryptomator and would love to do so. If the debug file doesn't contain confidential data, then maybe you can post the contents of it in here or attach it here.\nWould love for the developers to fix this issue -- I've been eagerly checking for updates on this topic almost daily now to see if it could be fixed. @tobihagemann Thanks for testing this. It seems like it is on any load rather than just Excel files only.  For example, I just tried uploading a folder of about 100 JPEGs of each less than 4 MB and the drive unmounted when doing it.\nSo I would say at this stage Cryptomator should be publicly marked as not compatible with High Sierra (regardless of whether the bug is on the Apple side or Cryptomator side).\nDo you have any suggestions for work around? Am considering using a VM on Windows to do uploads to cryptomator unless I can regain read/write access on High Sierra.\n+1 +1 +1 for switching to fuse here! I saw the other thread about the fuse implementation but it hadn't been updated in around a year so I thought it had been abandoned. When switching to a fuse implementation, hopefully the system timestamps for created/modified will be respected as well.\nThanks again\n. Thanks @overheadhunter Yep, am familiar with both Cyberduck and mountain duck. May have to consider Mountainduck in conjunction with Cryptomator until this issue is solved.\nCyberduck works but doesn't allow mounting of the cryptomator vault as a virtual drive.\nMountain duck together with a cryptomator vault seems to work and doesn't have this dismount issue (I know its not your software, but do happen you happen to know if mountain duck mounts google drive using fuse? It looks like they aren't mounting using webdav and so they don't have this webdav dismount issue on high Sierra. Also they don't seem to have the macOS timestamp created/modified date issue that cryptomator has. Mostly just curious..)\nThe only issue with Mountain Duck is that I had wanted to use cryptomator together with Google File Stream to mount Google Drive instead of Mountain Duck to mount Google Drive. In other words, I would mount the drive myself (rather than Mountain Duck) and then use cryptomator on top of that. The reason for this is that Google File Stream has caching, can pause the uploads if you lose internet connection/need to move etc, whereas Mountain Duck does it straight away, so there is no way to pause a upload once started and you need to restart.\nAnother possible solution altogether would be to use encrypted sparse bundles as a disk image on macOS. That encrypts everything, in separate files rather than a large individual encrypted file and doesn't have the timestamp issue either. But that is another tool altogether and I think suboptimal compared to cryptomator as I think it is quite fickle and can break easily if a file doesn't get uploaded properly. @wAuner @adw4516 @orangecoding I had mentioned this in other threads, but Cryptomator does not work on Mac OS High Sierra. In my opinion it should be publicly listed as not supporting High Sierra. Once you mount an encrypted volume, it will automatically disconnect/drop as soon as you start trying to add a significant number of files to it. You can read about it on issue #579. This makes it non functional on High Sierra. @adw4516 Yep that's correct. MS Office creates a lot of API requests so triggers the error faster. Just open up an Excel document and save it in a cryptomator vault in High Sierra and hit save 4-5 times in a row and it will disconnect. Hence me saying cryptomator is not compatible with high sierra. Feel free to throw in your +1 on that issue #579 . So is this a confirmed bug then? Since I can't save any files to the vault using any MacOS app? Thanks. ",

Here's my current command that uses davfs2 to work properly - no \"write error\" in vim:\nsudo mount -t davfs $MY_URL $DIR_MOUNT -o username=${USER},rw,uid=${USER},gid=${USER},file_mode=700,dir_mode=700. @emilhuseynli I have kernel 4.8.0-34 (Stock Ubuntu 16.10), vim 7.4.1829-1ubuntu2.1, davfs 1.5.4.\nMore importantly though - I was reviewing my notes.  I think my solution was to append:\nuse_locks 0\nto /etc/davfs2/davfs2.conf.  Please update if that solves this for you!. @SergioBenitez Have you tried my fix listed above? https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/434#issuecomment-278702449\n. ",

    "N-Prime": "Another reason to implement this:\nLet's say you delete 50 files but change your mind about one.\nIf you delete them in the Cryptomator window, the files are gone (not in the trash) but are still in the cloud (let's assume the cloud storage provider does have this feature). You COULD restore them from the cloud backup - if you can figure out which file it is. \nLooking at Dropbox's web interface, it doesn't say when a file was deleted - just the ciphertext filename and that it was deleted. So if you deleted 50 files today and 40 on previous days, you may need to restore all of them to find/restore the one you need then delete the unwanted ones over again. This, by itself might not be an easy task - you'd need to recall and track down the files you previously deleted, potentially missing some.\nIf they went into the trash, it would still be a pain, but (in Windows at least) it gives you more info about deleted files - the file size, when it was modified, and when it was deleted. All things that can help you to narrow down the file you're looking for even if you don't know the exact file name.. ",

    "j-xella": "Not sure if this should be a separate ticket, but once cryptomator supports FUSE on linux, could the implementation also allow putting something into /etc/fstab and then just do \"(u)mount ~/crypto_mount_point\", even on a headless box. I guess it is something that cli will have to implement ...\nP.S. I would be happy to test, if necessary. Some cloud storage providers have limitations on single file size. Splitting file into chunks could be a saver for such cases. As for synchronizaton problem, couldn't it be solved by updating all parts of file at the same time, even if technically the changes were made in one part only?\nFor example, each part could contain a version token (GUID). When a file is modified, new version token is generated, and so all file parts have to be updated. Now, somewhere else, the repository gets synchronized, one part at a time. It means that during the sync some parts will have old token, some will have a new one. This could be used by cryptomator to detect update and block access to the file temporarily.. @markuskreusch To my understanding, file splitting should not be the default behaviour, but something a user would enable or not when creating a vault, with configurable max chunk size. Then the problem of not being able to access a file during synchronization would be a trade-off of the ability to have big files split.\nI (speaking for myself, obviously) would be happy if I had a choice of using an otherwise unusable cloud provider and additional security of possible file size obfuscation in exchange for occasional temporary loss of access to the file.. I use both.\nThey do the same thing, but the priorities are in different places. encFS is mature, stable, fast, but requires deeper integration with the system. Cryptomator's priority is to be crossplatform and standard compatible. Also, I like the directory obfuscation that cryptomator offers.\nI use encFS to automatically encrypt local data (home folders, for example) on my linux machines. It is light, fast and very well integrated with linux.\nI use cryptomator for volumes that I would like to access from different platforms. The WebDAV interface that cryptomator uses is both curse and blessing.\nOn the one hand, it can be slow as hell. It is not the fastest software ever even by itself, but if some program does something more behind the scenes besides just reading a file, it can take really bad. Like waiting for 10 seconds for gVIM to open a simple text file... And nobody will help you - this could be the windows issue or the software that you use.\nOn the other hand, WebDAV does not require deep windows integration. So, for example, if you are at work and don't have admin privileges on your machine, all those truecrypts and dokanys can be out of reach, but WebDAV still works.. ",

Switching the proxy off (changing to the other environment) it works again and is perfectly accessible.. 1. Unlock vault with Cryptomator\n2. Switch environment to your work place\n3.

It would be nice to warn Linux users during the installation  of Cryptomator of this problem  (or even before or after that).\nAlso, the workaround mentioned above doesn't work for me.  Since Oracle doesn't seem to fix this problem it would be nice to have more detailed instructions on how to use those commands.

Some help here is very much appreciated.\nI tried with GMX the following way on Ubuntu/Mint:\nsudo mount -t davfs https://mediacenter.gmx.net /mountpoint \nUsername and password is asked after I hit enter. Mounting GMX via webdav works for me this way, but it doesn't solves the problem with Cryptomator.\nHas somebody used this workaround successfully and if yes which provider and with which commands?\nThank you for your support.. @markuskreusch \noh, my bad. I've overlooked the comment with the uid=username.\nNow it does work, but on my Mint 17 system I can execute a mount command only as root / with sudo (I've got an error message saying that).  \nThanks for your help!.

From there, I was able to create a new folder and git init a new repository and make some successful test commits.\nSeems like it's working! I'm closing this issue. \nI'll do a data backup tonight and then try to use version 1.4.0 more extensively and provide feedback if there are new issues.\nThanks for the help and all your hard work @overheadhunter!. Fyi for others, a new related issue (Cannot add commits in git repo copied to unlocked Cryptomator 1.4.0 FUSE vault): https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/670.

On Windows, everthing is working as expected.  \nDoes anyone else have this git+Cryptomator+GNU/Linux issue and/or have any other thoughts?.

This is a duplicate of https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/283. Thanks for testing.\n\nAs an additional note, I have used git within Cryptomator vaults on Windows 10 extensively and everything works as expected.. Adzwoolly, \nThe reply and details are much appreciated. Good to get confirmation from another Linux user I'm not alone on this. I also experienced the issue regarding inability to change permissions. I discuss other stuff I tried / resources I found in more detail in this issue:\nhttps://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/721  \nWhat's even more perplexing is git + cryptomator worked perfectly for me on Windows 10 for more than a year. I would love to get this resolved because I can feel my git skills decaying as I use it so infrequently due to the friction you describe. Unfortunately I lack the skill set to fix this myself, but if any more capable people need tests run etc., let me know!  . Fwiw I'm using fuse version 2.9.7-1-deb9u2 from Debian Stretch Main repo. I'm not aware of how to get anything more current that than this. As I don't know how to build Cryptomator on my own (willing to learn - just not in current skill set), I will test with Cryptomator 1.41 once the .AppImage is available. Thank you for looking into this!. Using cryptomator-1.4.1-x86_64.AppImage released today, following the steps in the original post above, I receive the same error:\nfatal: cannot update the ref 'HEAD': unable to append to '.git/logs/HEAD': Input/output error\nIf there's something else I should test, please let me know.. Probably not unexpected, but just wanted to follow up to report I'm getting the same error when using cryptomator-1.4.4-x86_64.AppImage..

    "LukasReschke": "Would certainly mitigate the problem best, but I'm wondering what's the UX impact on this. I guess having the credentials static for each mount would be \"good enough\" and doesn't require one to re-setup the mount all the time.\n. Looking at http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/jackrabbit-commits/201510.mbox/%3C20151021123021.6383C3A0337@svn01-us-west.apache.org%3E, #319 seems to be caused by an upstream security issue. Their security patch for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCR-3909 seems incomplete. I will also reach out to them.\n. > Assuming the user uses an up-to-date browser when visiting the attacker's website, wouldn't the same origin policy stop such XHRs?\nUnfortunately not. Adobe software has a very special interpretation of Same-Origin. \ud83d\ude09 \nBasically what happens here is:\n1. Using #319, the attacker uploads a malicious SWF file\n2. The SWF file is then embedded on another page and communicates using some JS callbacks.\nYou can easily test this by uploading http://0me.me/ContentHijacking/objects/ContentHijacking.swf to one of your vaults. Then configure it as object file on http://15.rs/ContentHijacking/ContentHijackingLoader.html. As target page use for example a text file in the same vault.\n. > Just to get you right: How is the XHR executed despite SOP?\nBecause we don't set any special request headers here or so. It's technically a normal XHR request that just is missing the Content-Type header. What is however not possible is to read the response of the request. That's what #318 is needed for in combination.\nhttp://rawgit.com/LukasReschke/500491aba775c11d2591305ee417ed42/raw/72a70ec2477a29b34b6e4895198d31295146ab31/exploit.html showcases this nicely:\n\n\n. > Ok my bad. I had the impression that the SOP prohibits the requests, not the responses. \nIt does as well when the request adds some additional headers and so on. :-)\n. ",

Does password complexity affect difficulty of brute force crack? \nSince salt for scrypt is known in masterkey.cryptomator, I suppose the answer is yes\n2. what is scrypt used for? Can crypto-currency asic miner or gpu (ie. litecoin miner) boost brute force cracking?\n. ",
    "Eyremba": "What's about Argon2 which is the new \"standard\" for password hashing?\nWouldn't it be much better to switch from scrypt to Argon2?\nArgon2 is also used by KeePass for a while now since KDB format v4.. It would be great if there is a generic \u201cDropFolder\u201d for every vault **which allows adding new files (to get encrypted) without entering the password of the vault. We only want to enter the password if we open the folders or work with data in the vault.**\nThat's not possible.\nWell.... it could be possible, but only with this two solutions:\n\n\nStore the key/password somewhere on the harddrive\n(UNSECURE because it could be stored only in plaintext/decrypted)\n\n\nUsing RSA-4096 instead of AES-256..... Which would be by far less secure, take more system resources for calculation, and would require different keys and stuff.\n\n\nI don't think that this will be implemented because it would be really unsafe.\nCryptomator was made for symmetric encryption and not for asymmetric encryption systems like RSA.\n. It would be nice too if Cryptomator would/could have its own version of AES and the hash engines implemented to be completely independent from the Java Crypto Libraries.. In my opinion, everything which is not open-source is also considered/classified as not-secure. That's why Cryptomator beats/outperforms every other solution.. +1\nI can confirm this bug.. ",

    "atYuguo": "Yes, I agree. I have hundreds GB files on cloud, it is unrealistic to download all of them every time I need some files. However since the file name is not readable, I have to download at least an entire directory for this yet. Maybe an option to keep a local index file of plain file name to encrypted file name mapping is a good ideal?\nThank you.\n. @RiseT Thanks for your suggestion. Yes, I am currently an odrive user with paid add-ons. I love the idea of odrive but yet it's not reliable as native clients for production environment. And the odrive encryption is not transparency enough. I know there is a description of the encryption process of odrive on its FAQ page. However the detail is not clear, it's hard to reproduce this process without odrive client. The problem with this is: 1, It's hard to decrypt my data if I don't want to pay for odrive one day (There is no independent decrypt tool released yet). 2, It's not enough to judge if the method is secure without those details.\nOn the other hand, in my opinion, the encryption method of cryptomator is more professional and comprehensive based on open information.\n. I'm thinking an browser plugin that can decrypt file name on cloud storage web page is very useful in this case. :)\n. ",
    "Misiek304": "I also thought about some kind of local registry. It's still not a perfect solution though. To be honest in it's current form I can't see any workaround for this issue.\n. @FireUponSky - I think that's a great idea. This would allow users to manage their files without actually having to decrypt them. Users could download requested files from the vault and decrypt them locally on their computers. But I see a serious security concern here because we would have to hand over a password to the extension and browser. I'm not a encryption specialist nor am I a programmer but I think the less exposure on the encryption password, the better.\nAs a workaround of this issue I would suggest using two passwords. One for the metadata and a different one for the content of the files. Or maybe some kind of two par of separate keys protected with the same password.\nAnother difficulty with the extension would be to make it work with different cloud storage's. Like Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, Amazon Cloud Drive, etc.\nTo summarize I think browser extension would be a great addition to the Cryptomator and it would comply with \"one utility for one purpose\" rule that @overheadhunter mentioned earlier.\n.

It is the first step: https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/354#issuecomment-393594909. I believe the ideia behind the first post by @neomodern was misunderstood.\nIt would be nice if Cryptomator could operate in a Dropbox similar fashion, meaning it would store an unencrypted version of all the files on the hard drive (not some virtual drive) and then, on the background, encrypt and sync everything with the cloud provider.\nThis would allow us to have multiple devices on sync using a cloud provider in the same way dropbox can do but without a virtual drive that always requires to be mounted and doesn't have all the features of a real file system (including performance).\nMy point is: the current model forces us to work on files that are \"stored\" inside a virtual disk making It hard in some use cases / not very convenient. If Cryptomator could be told \"this real folder in my disk should be sync with this storage vault on the cloud\" and then to the sync encrypt/decryption on the background it would be very nice.. If we break this down, Cryptomator doesn't even need to know about all the cloud / remote stuff. Just an option to 2-way sync a local unencrypted folder with an encrypted vault would be enough. \nLater on, one could just mount the cloud storage as a local drive (using fuse, WebDAV or something similar) and store the vault on that drive..

Cryptomator[17284:906592] Cryptomator:Failed to launch JVM. Thanks, I have seen the JavaFX - it's unfortunate...\nI have tried the \"flag-workaround\" but get the same error.\nThe font reset did work but after getting my previous fonts installed again I get the same error.\nA similar problem is mentioned here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33353866/javafx-jfxpanel-embeded-in-swing-application-crash-in-mac. Hi, I did some debugging and found out that \n- running the application as a different (newly created) user with an empty user font folder worked\n- a single font file in my users's font folder - in my case \"31CDDD_0_0.ttf\" - did cause the crash. I removed it from ~/Library/Fonts/ and have no issues launching the application now.\nI hope this helps others with a similar problem. Resetting the fonts to defaults was no option for me as all fonts (including MS Office) fonts disappear with a reset.. ",

Now I delete it again because I need a working version.\n2016-11-12 12:23:12,586 INFO  [UpgradeStrategy:44] Upgrading /media/festplatte/Dokumente/Owncloud/cryptomator_owncloud from 4 to 5.\n2016-11-12 12:23:25,324 INFO  [UpgradeStrategy:44] Upgrading /media/festplatte/Dokumente/Owncloud/cryptomator_owncloud from 4 to 5.\n2016-11-12 12:23:36,030 INFO  [UpgradeStrategy:44] Upgrading /media/festplatte/Dokumente/Owncloud/cryptomator_owncloud from 4 to 5.\n2016-11-12 12:23:49,096 INFO  [UpgradeStrategy:44] Upgrading /media/festplatte/Dokumente/Owncloud/cryptomator_owncloud from 4 to 5.\n2016-11-12 12:24:00,620 INFO  [UpgradeStrategy:44] Upgrading /media/festplatte/Dokumente/Owncloud/cryptomator_owncloud from 4 to 5.\n2016-11-12 12:24:54,056 INFO  [UpgradeStrategy:44] Upgrading /media/festplatte/Dokumente/Owncloud/cryptomator_owncloud from 4 to 5.\n2016-11-12 12:25:06,886 INFO  [UpgradeStrategy:44] Upgrading /media/festplatte/Dokumente/Owncloud/cryptomator_owncloud from 4 to 5.\n2016-11-12 12:25:44,696 INFO  [UpgradeStrategy:44] Upgrading /media/festplatte/Dokumente/Owncloud/cryptomator_owncloud from 4 to 5.\n2016-11-12 12:26:28,709 INFO  [UpgradeStrategy:44] Upgrading /media/festplatte/Dokumente/Owncloud/cryptomator_owncloud from 4 to 5.\n2016-11-12 12:26:59,887 INFO  [UpgradeStrategy:44] Upgrading /media/festplatte/Dokumente/Owncloud_pi2/cryptomator_owncloud from 4 to 5.\n2016-11-12 12:27:10,417 INFO  [UpgradeStrategy:44] Upgrading /media/festplatte/Dokumente/Owncloud_pi2/cryptomator_owncloud from 4 to 5.\n2016-11-12 13:48:15,064 INFO  [UpgradeStrategy:44] Upgrading /media/festplatte/Dokumente/Owncloud/cryptomator_owncloud from 4 to 5.\n2016-11-12 13:48:35,779 INFO  [UpgradeStrategy:44] Upgrading /media/festplatte/Dokumente/Owncloud/cryptomator_owncloud from 4 to 5.\n. After installing version 1.1.4 again I can open my encrypted folder. So it seems that version 1.2.1 didn't update.\n. First I safed the content of my encrypted files. Then I deleted 1.1.4 with its config folder. Afterwards I installed 1.2.1 again and created a new encrypted folder where I put in my files. So 1.1.4 is history from now on. 1.2.1 works although the update was bad. Problem solved. Thanks for your help from Germany!\n. ",
    "sth2258": "Initial scope of this comment was along the lines of \"synchronization\", as by default there is no asynchronous (or synchronous) replication of the vault within the application.\n. Sounds like this should be two requirements:\n- The message around synching is only applicable if you have configured as such (outside the scope of the application); to an end-user that has not configured replication, then they would be extremely confused\n- It sounds like there is some agreement that there should be an automated backup procedure prior to an upgrade\n. Ok so that would explain it - You are talking about Desktop --> Cloud sync. \nYou are correct about the UC I am trying to satisfy - I find VeraCrypt much more unstable (especially on a Mac) as a successor to TrueCrypt, and Cryptomator is the best solution I've found to date to replace it. It might not be your intended audience so far, but it is certainly a use case you are already satisfying. The team might think about having some marketing material sway in that direction as well. Ultimately, the app is good for any file (not block) level storage encryption.\n. ",

Until I click \"Crash\", I can access the files inside. If I click \"Continue\", Cryptomator takes me back to the main screen and acts like the drive was never mounted, although it clearly is and I can still access the files in it. I must completely exit Cryptomator to unmount the drive.\n- As I went through to duplicate the steps, it started acting a little bit differently. When I clicked continue on the crash screen, after the first time, it showed as mounted, gave me the decrypted/encrypted graph, and showed the \"Lock vault\" button at the bottom. However, the Lock vault button does not work and I again must quit Cryptomator to unmount the drive.\n\n\n\ncryptomator copy.log.zip\n. Thank you.

Tried the following with no change:\n- Creating new vaults\n- Uninstalling and reinstalling\n- Creating new vaults after the reinstall. This does not appear to be an \"under load\" issue as I first thought. I installed Cryptomator on a new machine running the High Sierra beta 9. The same issue exists, only this time it disconnected before I did any file copying to the presented drive.. Nothing? Not even a chastising comment about using beta software?. Understandable. I've copied my files out of Cryptomator for now, but I am anxiously awaiting some news (I'm not trying to rush you guys, I promise). Now that I know it's on the radar, I'll sit back and wait patiently.

Both of those packages have trials, although EagleFiler is easier because I can just import a large directory. Create a Cryptomator vault, import a large directory, drive goes away and EagleFiler errors out saying it can't create folders (because the drive is unmounted).. I've been able to recreate the same issue with DEVONthink Pro Office. If I create a backup to a Cryptomator vault from DEVONthink, the drive goes away. I'm trying to recreate it now. For the record, I'm on the GM release of High Sierra and haven't tried it on this version yet.. And it's working correctly again with both DEVONthink and EagleFiler. Maybe an issue the GM released fixed. I don't know.. I will continue to test and update here. I\u2019ve got another machine at home that also experienced the issue. I\u2019ll know more about that one later.. It's not fixed, it just doesn't do it every time. I tried creating a large ZIP file in a Cryptomator drive and it has ejected twice..

Are your Excel files a GB or more and disk intensive?. @overheadhunter, any updates on this?\n@jomuyo Thanks for the log, this might contain an important clue!  :tada:\nconnection is dead\nIn the past the macOS WebDAV client didn't terminate connections after put requests, leaving them stale. We have added a filter in order to terminate such connections from server side.\nMaybe Apple fixed the former behavior, which never conformed to official standards anyway: Instead of either using chunked encoding or sending a content length, Apple added a X-Expected-Entity-Length header field.\nStarting with High Sierra we might need to disable this filter again. I will test this next week together with @tobihagemann.. I\u2019ve tried Dropbox, iCloud, and my own storage hosted on a Synology device. It happens on all of them. . \n",

    "bunducafe": "+1 - same issue here...\nI cannot proceed in using the 1.2. version. After a downgrade everything works as expected. Is there any workaround besides getting everything off the cloud, update, newly setup the different vaults and upload them with the new version?\n. ",
    "jumper444": "The use of Cryptomator with ONEDRIVE (microsoft/windows) keeps a local copy of the files on your machine (it's a setting enabled by default).  Thus the difference between EncFS and Cryptomator in this regard isn't an issue.\nIf you create a vault \"in\" your OneDrive folder (by default it hangs off the Desktop in File Explorer, but actually resides at c:\\users\\[username]\\onedrive) and then use it to store (encrypted) data (your vault), the resulting encrypted files are uploaded to the cloud, but they also remain on your computer and cryptomator can continue to use/operate/store/retrieve while you are offline.  When returning back online Microsoft's software will automatically sync the changes back up to cloud (and/or down from cloud if that vault is being used by another computer as well).. So actually this is superior to EncFS because the data is continuously available, online or off, but there is never an unencrypted version of the files directly on storage.. I wish to confirm this continuing bug issue on cyptomator v3.0rc7x86 (Win 10).\nWhen using robocopy to copy(mirror) files from one location (outside vault) to inside vault, Robocopy sees the files as DIFFERENT (not missing as I saw one 'issue' report state) and will delete all files in the destination (let's presume for argument that the mirror already exists and is accurate) and then recopy the files back into vault.\nIn other words....have an empty vault Z: and be in, for example, C:\\TEMP.  Create a file in TEMP called \"readme.txt\" (put some text in it if you want).  Run:\nrobocopy . z:\\ /mir       (this mirrors where you are c:\\temp to z:)\nRobocopy will see that readme.txt isn't in the destination and copy it to Z.\nNow just run the command again and robocopy will say \"*EXTRA FILE\" on the readme.txt at the z: destination (in other words, robocopy somehow believes the destination file is not the same as the source), robocopy will then delete z:\\readme.txt and copy the readme from c:\\temp over.\nThis will happen each time you run the command even though you can verify the readme.txt file in Z: is accurate/correct/present, etc.\nSomething's wrong here and robocopy is a well used, microsoft programmed utility.  So if it's having problems there is a real issue at stake.\nEDIT: the use of the /fft robocopy flag (2 second time window to account for dos timestamp diffs) does not affect results.  ALSO: use of /dst flag to test for this issue being due to daylight savings time issues did not affect results.  Robocopy copies files entirely each time run as described above.. I have thought that perhaps this is a case sensitivity issue in some way (internally to some chain in the process) so I tried the test with UPPERCASE file only, lowercase only, and a file of miXEd case.  My presumption was maybe that robocopy (and other utils) internally convert or work only on one or the other when conducting matching.  However the result was the same and robocopy will delete destination and copy source over each time regardless of file case composition (english alphabet is all i tested).\nPS: I also tried using file names that did not have an extension - uppercase only and lower case only - on the presumption that maybe the hangup is the period '.' or handling (Historically) of the two parts.  Who knows.  Anyway...nothing seems to correct the issue and I don't know what robocopy is 'seeing' such that it feels files are different.. Oh...I think I found a clue!!  I started trying other command line actions and ran across this.\nPresume we have that 'readme.txt' file in both location (c:\\temp...where our command window is open to; and z:\\ the vault).\nNow run:\nfc /b readme.txt z:\\readme.txt    (this will do a simple binary compare on two files for diffs)\nRESULT:\n.....\nComparing files readme.txt and Z:\\README.TXT\nFC: cannot open Z:\\README.TXT - No such file or folder\n.....\nThe fc command somehow(!) uppercases the 2nd file and believes it is supposed to be comparing to \"README.TXT\" and not \"readme.txt\". Of course when it then goes and asks the z: vault for \"README.TXT\" it doesn't exist because (as I believe I read elsewhere for this software) Cryptomator is operating on case sensitivity even though windows isn't (I'm unsure of this assertion though)\nThe fc command fails without finding the file seemingly due to some case or conversion issue?  Thus (whatever is going on here) it might be concluded that robocopy is having a similar problem.. If i change the destination file name from \"readme.txt\" to \"README.TXT\" and then use either of the below as an attempt to try and work around a seeming case problems it still doesn't work:\nfc /b readme.txt z:\\readme.txt\nfc /b readme.txt z:\\READEME.TXT\n.....\nComparing files readme.txt and Z:\\README.TXT\nFC: cannot open Z:\\README.TXT - No such file or folder\n.....\nOne final note, you will notice that the error message also shows that the drive letter itself is being converted to uppercase \"Z:\\README.TXT\" instead of \"z:\\README.TXT\" so if there is any sort of Crytomator/WebDAV issue with case sensitive drive letters (as strange as that sounds on windows) then that could be the problem.  It's a thought.. Or, another possibility, the 'fc' command is 'asking' the z drive (cryptomator) \"i'd like to see 'readme.txt' and the z drive is 'replying' \"I'm sorry I don't have Z:\\README.TXT\".\nWeird 'discussion/statement' maybe, but I'm hazy on the actual underlying action within the OS/DAV/CLI and thus maybe there is some back and forth messaging whereby entities are miscomunicating.. using command line \"type readme.txt\" to view/list both files works fine and contents are displayed (which is interesting because that just goes and gets the file contents and displays them; hard to understand how that would be much different from FC file compare which essentially goes and gets the file contents as well supposedly using similar underlying win/cli code)\nusing 'dir' on the two directories (one on c: and one in the vault z:) where the readme.txt files are located seems to return correct (and not case changed) results; I tried various switch options also like '/x' for short file name. No observed issues.\nSo there are some command line (dos) commands which function between a regular drive and the contents of a vault, and some others (robocopy, fc ..for now) which do not.  But the entire command line (windows shell) is singularly programmed by microsoft and should be having issues between different commands like this, imo.  Don't know the explanation.\n. I ran another common (free/shareware) util \"SYNCBACK\" to perform a directory/file sync from that same c: drive/file to the z: vault.  It reported no differences (because there aren't) and terminated.  Not sure why robocopy, fc, others? are having problems from the commandline.  I also speculated that maybe it's due to the vault presenting as FAT (not FAT16 or FAT32) file system (right click drive in windows explorer and choose properties).  That's the oldest of the implementations and maybe it's so old that it breaks something?. Cryptomator 1.3 now contains dokany, right?\nHere is outstanding issue with dokany, in certain instances, changing file case to uppercase.\nhttps://github.com/dokan-dev/dokany/issues/293\nCould this be related somehow?. I went crazy almost an entire day with 1.2.3 trying to solve similar issues.\nIf you search you will find a mess of possibilities, reg entries, firewall changes, whatever suggestions.  The cryptomator guys are/were aware of the issue as well and I found various pages herein discussing such problems (and the frustrations with them)\nDespite everything, the short answer to you (from me; i'm not on the project) is to upgrade to v1.3.0rc7 (the latest).  1.3 is a rewrite (with new associated code from other projects) and for whatever reason those connection issues went away.\nI don't know if it's because of the new (included) code ('dokany' project, etc, or whatever) or if they fixed something in cryptomator.  (Presumably if it was a fix of cryptomator code then they would have rolled it into 1.2.x which they didn't seem to do. So I think it's the new helper code addins from other projects).\nRegardless, try 1.3 and see if it goes away.. I believe I successfully have attached cryptomator log file from opening of vault (beginning of the session shown) until close.  I don't know which part(s) might be relevant.. The robocopy issue is here:\nhttps://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/370\nI have comments further below it addressing, again, how command line actions (I was using RC7 at the time) sometimes work or not.  In the case of Robocopy it seems to never be able to 'see' the file(s) in the vault and has somewhat similar behavior to what I present above.. My machine isn't under load and crytomator doesn't seem to be actually doing anything when I waited 2 minutes and then tried the 'type' command again.  I've simply noticed by accident that (except for robocopy) sometimes if I wait a command that failed or didn't see a file will then work again.. I don't believe i can find an exact sequence of commands (although I can't be sure) that cause responses to start flaking out.  All I have to do is take a single, simple file and then do some copy, type, rename, fc (file compare)..and such, a few times in a row and eventually after only a few tries i'll start to get file not found problems on some of the commands,  (but you will notice that DIR always works and always is able to display the file).. Below is a trace of a similar issue. Make a simple text file, copy it into vault, show the contents, then  running Robocopy.  Robocopy believes the files are changed and/or that the destination file is a different file from the source (and thus deletes it).  Robocopy should be simply exiting with no changes since the files are the same.  Note that /FFT and /DST flags (dos 2 second ignore and daylight savings 1 hour ignore) don't change the result.\n\nJ:\\x>ver\nMicrosoft Windows [Version 10.0.14393]\nJ:\\x>echo \"hello\" > hi.txt\nJ:\\x>copy hi.txt z:\\\n        1 file(s) copied.\nJ:\\x>dir z:\\\n Volume in drive Z has no label.\n Volume Serial Number is 0000-0000\nDirectory of z:\\\n07/03/2017  10:26 PM              .\n07/03/2017  10:26 PM              ..\n07/03/2017  10:26 PM                10 hi.txt\n               1 File(s)             10 bytes\n               2 Dir(s)   3,022,188,544 bytes free\nJ:\\x>type hi.txt\n\"hello\"\nJ:\\x>type z:\\hi.txt\n\"hello\"\nJ:\\x>robocopy . z:\\ /mir\n\nROBOCOPY     ::     Robust File Copy for Windows\nStarted : Monday, July 3, 2017 10:27:10 PM\n   Source : J:\\x\\\n     Dest = z:\\\nFiles : *.*\n\nOptions : . /S /E /DCOPY:DA /COPY:DAT /PURGE /MIR /R:1000000 /W:30\n\n                       1    J:\\x\\\n\n\n*EXTRA File                 10        hi.txt\n100%        New File                  10        hi.txt\n\n\n           Total    Copied   Skipped  Mismatch    FAILED    Extras\nDirs :         1         0         1         0         0         0\n\nFiles :         1         1         0         0         0         1\n   Bytes :        10        10         0         0         0        10\n   Times :   0:00:00   0:00:00                       0:00:00   0:00:00\nSpeed :                  46 Bytes/sec.\n   Speed :               0.002 MegaBytes/min.\n   Ended : Monday, July 3, 2017 10:27:10 PM\nJ:\\x>. 1) could a cryptomator vault when created simply be specifed as \"windows based; not case sensitive\" as a permanent option/flag for its entire life?  (Such an option would mean, of course, that a single directory couldn't both contain \"hi.txt\" and \"HI.TX\", however you can't currently do this with Windows either...and, furthermore, if you DID do it from another OS and then mounted the Vault on Windows wouldn't you then have a nasty problem? How would this be resolved even presently?)\n2) if the command line shows the issues  mentioned above are they (or would they) be present from, for example, File Explorer?  I don't THINK I have noticed it yet, but, for example.... if I renamed a file, then viewed it, then did a few other things from file explorer would I theoretically start having similar issues?  Or is there something different about File Explorer or Windows/GUI/system access that differs from CLI/POSIX/CMD?. As an additional question to # 1 above what exactly happens specifically if a vault from a non Windows OS with multiple same file names (different case) are in the same directories?  If cryptomator had a \"windows volume; case not sensitive flag\" then the mounting of volume onto windows that did not have this flag set would seemingly require a warning to the user and then possibly a scan/rename (or translation) of two or more same-named files in some way (so the user could access/operate on both of them).\nIt occurs to me that I've never seen a solution or discussion of a non-Window OS file system mounted directly onto a DOS/Windows drive letter which might have two of the same named files.  Or am I missing a detail here?. I found another clue. You referenced:\nhttps://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/207\nwherein another person referenced (on encFS4win using dokany) this:\nhttps://github.com/jetwhiz/encfs4win/issues/62\nWithin that issue is a following comment:\n\"...These are some general stability observations.\n    Copied 28231 files, 6180 directories to Dokany drive. Explorer (right click+Properties) reports about 26000 files, 6180 directories. Opening new properties dialog again 2 minutes later, it reports correctly 28231 files, 6180 directories....\"\nThuse we have a similar (magic) delay of 2 minutes or so causing file (Explorer in this case) discrepencies (Cryptomator 1.3 now uses Dokany, right?).  Further comments in that issue link have some discussion back and forth about it being based on locking, timeouts, or perhaps Dokany thinking an active process has crashed.\nDon't know if this helps, I'm trying to include whatever I can find that may explain this problem.\n. For those who don't have high level knowledge about 'Dokany' vs WebDAV could you explain what this change or option means?  . I found a feature comparison here (more detailed than the project home page):\nhttps://nuetzlich.net/gocryptfs/comparison/\nand a simpler \"pro/con\" type page here:\nhttps://www.slant.co/versus/4893/18539/~encfs_vs_cryptomator\nNeither of the pages however really tell me the problem cryptomater is trying to solve, what deficiencies it saw in other similar product (they used FUSE instead of webDAV?), and what 'itch' caused it's creation when compared to alternatives.. https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/354\nAs I reviewed previous issues I came across this one as an example discussion where the person was contrasting EncFS having two directories, one encrypted/one not...vs Cryptomator having only encrypted data.  The person presented this as a possible con (that if your vault was in the cloud you wouldn't have access to files while offline.  This was a pro/con situation that I actually had not considered because I am using Cryptomator with OneDrive(Microsoft) which keeps cloud data locally persistant and accessible (although encrypted) when offline.  (I updated issue to point this out as a possible solution to such situations.)\nIt would be a short discussion of these types of issues and use cases which would help those coming here (or reading up on alternative) to ask/answer \"why am I on this page and why is this tool better (or worse) for what I'm trying to do compared to these others\".\nThen I updated the issue to point out that use of Cryptomator. I may be low on coffee at this moment, but what is \"BC 2.0\" since i don't see any reference to what you are referring to.. Windows will not dismout/eject a USB/removable disk is there are open file handles (and if you yank it out you'll get a warning).  Chkdsk (fix) will not run if files are open.  Veracrypt/truecrypt will not dismount if files are open.     Etc. etc.   These are proper responses/behaviors when storage devices are being removed or locked or processed by an operating system or program.  \nCryptomator should not unmount a vault if files are open.  This is the source of the issue/flaw/problem, not something to do with Libreoffice (which certainly keeps file handles open on windows.  Presumably Linux as well...and every other modern OS).\n(yes, an option could exist (like it does for Truecrypt/Veracrypt) to warn the user there are open files and then \"Force Dismount\".  At least then the user is taking responsibility for the possible mess to follow.   But, repeating, Cryptomator should not simply unmount a vault with open files.)\nAlso, I presume Cryptomator issues a file-sync/flush (or whatever the proper command is based on either Java or the native operating system) (and then a 3-5 second pause) in order to flush unsaved data to disk before (trying/checking) to execute the unmount command (and then warning if files still open, etc.)   User could have closed all files but disk caching might still (confusingly) cause a \"files still open\" alert simply due to delayed writes by the OS.. If there is no direct command or API in Java or Dokany or whatever approach Cryptomator is using in order to detect open handles/locks on the vault, then the problem could be solved by asking the OS for open handles/locks and then simply scanning the result for any that are in the vault location.  For example the Microsoft utility program (part of their 'sysinternals' free package) \"handle\" (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/handle) will return all open handles on the system.  Linux (OSX also presumably) have similar command.  Cryptomator could run those on dismount, regex/grep the result, and warn user (maybe list the actual file(s)?) that something is still open.  Then ask \"Force Dismount?\".\n(reviewing the syntax for \"handle\", and since Cryptomator mounts as a drive letter on windows, it seems as simple as using \"handle s:\" as the OS/system command to run -  presuming you have an open vault as the S: drive.  Any results that come back be open handles on the vault). You have probably tested this, but with your reply I am not entirely sure.  Did you just open/mount a volume (and just view it in explorer) or did you actually have one or more files OPEN from the mounted volume.\nThere would not be a handle to a volume if you don't have an open file, obviously. And if you are just viewing the volume in explorer I'm not sure that is enough to create a handle because, recently in windows 10, explorer will simply close itself if the underlying drive/device/volume closes/ejects (instead of maintaining an open handle and blocking).  So please make sure you open a file for editing/use if you did not during the test.  Explorer may not create handles.. ",

When I work only with Win 7 and Cryptomator and ODrive and Amazon Cloud Drive, all is ok.\n2. I also deleted the whole vault on OSX and redownloaded it.

(I'm running Kubuntu 16.04). @overheadhunter, @markuskreusch: I have had some luck on this error after retrying today.  In accordance with https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40228866/optimizing-memory-leakage-in-javafx, I verified that the x-org version was > 1.18.4 (I have 1.19.3 as of sometime this summer) and that mesa > 13.0 (I have 17.0.7 as of Oct and was 12.0.6 before).  I also have mesa-utils but I think that just helps output the mesa version.  The GUI version of Cryptomator rose very slowly for ten minutes and then stabilized at a very reasonable memory usage and now shows normal small movements up and down (for the last 2 hours).  Unless you guys did something internal to cryptomator that fixed it separately, maybe this will work for others?\nI am running Ubuntu 16.04 and Cryptomator 1.3.1.. > How does the Cryptomator AppImage release fit into the desktop with menus etc.? Can you add an option install it into the menus on first start like the app updater?\nYou should be able to do this with appimaged or appimagelauncher.  The only reason I say should is that on ubuntu 18.04, bits of the desktop or menu integration are problematic (but not just for cryptomator or AppImages).  Addition to the menu on first start usually works with either of these options but not always.  Changing the menu folder can be somewhat problematic (creates duplicate menu folders).  \nFYI - with appimagelauncher, use the deb file per the readme on the website. @TheAssassin - my sentence was just an inelegant way of saying that they need to use the deb file.  Your readme says this but many people don't start with that.  . Ubuntu 16.04\nKernel Version: 4.13.0-38-generic\nDisplay Manager: SDDM\nDesktop Enviroment: KDE\nCryptomator version: 1.4.0-beta1\nRunning X11. It is running X11 (edited post above to include information all together). That is correct; Version 1.3.x showed up normal size.\u00a0 I don't remember if it was resizeable but will check.\n\u2063Sent from BlueMail \u200b\nOn Apr 8, 2018, 8:09 AM, at 8:09 AM, Sebastian Stenzel notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nCryptomator 1.3.x window shows up in its normal size?\n-- \nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/656#issuecomment-379523587\n. @joeyvix : half of the first of those suggestions (for linux) can be done by executing Cryptomator with the following command: kdocker -m -n Cryptomator -i /Path/to/icon/image /path/to/cryptomator\n\nIt requires kdocker which is usually available through the repositories.. I think this is still an issue with beta2.  I just downloaded beta2 and ran into an empty mount point using my old folder.  I deleted the folder and recreated it and it worked fine.  Running Kubuntu 16.04. \nTested pquan's scenario also: Rebooted while keeping the cryptomator vault purposely mounted and had the problem (unable to unlock vault with the same target mount point: 12:13:20.874 [JavaFX Application Thread] ERROR o.c.ui.controllers.UnlockController - Unlock failed for technical reasons. java.lang.NullPointerException: null).  \nUnlocking the vault without a mount point, then relocking the vault, deleting and recreating the mount point folder worked as a workaround.. It consistently works without issue on the standard mount point.  The individual mount path is when there is sometimes the issue.  Below is the full log file (three failures and then the success).  I will try again explicitly leaving the mount path empty and/or not pressing the apply button and then making sure those are correctly done.

    "freayd": "Hey, thanks for your help!\nYes that's a possibility, although I don't really want to move my files into the vault. Especially as long as Cryptomator won't start automatically on boot (#40), the files will be inaccessible until I manually unlock the vault. It also prevents having the same file backed up in different vaults.\nDoes anyone knows if FUSE does allow to create symlinks? In this case the issue #252 might be solving this one.\nAnother option might be to use rsync or FreeFileSync to keep synchronised copies of the original files into the vault(s). Not ideal though as it implies having copies of a file and therefore using extra disk space.\n. Ok, I see, will try to make it work with an additional sync tool then.

I'll keep my eyes out for the next release.. Good to know that cryptomator isnt for system folders.\nI should have clarified. I meant can cryptomator encrypt a folder, and the encrypt a parent folder? Meaning both are encrypted by cryptomator. (Not system folders)\n. Excellent, thank you for the quick answers. I will keep this information in mind! I am using the software now and it works great :-)\n. Thanks for clarification. Readme was updated per your requested change. \n. Thanks for explaining that. It's good to know. \nHowever you did not respond to my idea about password protecting the cryptomator application itself from opening without a master password. \nMeaning, in order to open cryptomator a user must enter a master password before the vaults will be displayed. This is important because \n1) it prevents anyone from knowing how many vaults you have \n2) it allows you to save the vault password without worry that someone who has access to the computer can instantly view the vault. \nWhat do you think of this feature? . Excellent! You are welcome, I am glad I can offer some ideas to help improve this already awesome program :-) In modern times, computer security is super important.. Stale? No, this is still an active issue, mr stale bot.. > Is this something that you can always reproduce? If yes, what are the steps in detail?\n@tobihagemann  Yes, in my cryptomator archive, this folder is persistently a \"ghost\" meaning it shows itself but cannot be deleted or altered. However, I cannot explain how to reproduce this error as it just randomly occurred one day and has been there ever since.\nI'll wait to test out the FUSE implementation since I don't want to risk corrupting any data, and haggling with restoring from a backup and comparing changed files.

    "pquan": "I would like to have cryptomator master password too. However, beware it will not add much in the sense of security. \nA computer shall be encrypted with full-disk security and shall have a strong login password. This is your primary line of defence. If you need to give your computer to somebody to \"browse\" the internet, give them a guest account.\nHowever, a master password will be nice so that there will be only one password to remember locally, yet many (hard) passwords to crack from blobs taken from the cloud.. This bug also affects the appimage builds for linux (tested on ubuntu bionic). If you mount a vault, then reboot or shutdown without first closing the vault trough cryptomator, the mount point is left as an empty directory in ~/.Cryptomator/vaultxxxx. \nTrying to mount the same vault on the same mount point then fails. Changing the mount point or manually deleting the empty directory allows the vault to be mounted again.\nSuggestion: I don't see the issue of mounting a vault if the mount point is an empty directory. This is standard practice under linux: make an empty dir and mount something there after.. You should consider that you need to build trust and reliability around your project. \nPeople use LTS for a reason: being stable and trustfull and supported. \nIf it's a problem for you to support cryptomator in the long run on a long term support release, then I'll be questioning if my trust is properly placed with cryptomator. And I guess the same goes with others.. IMHO, snap is something that is bad but necessary in Linux for phones, where ubuntu failed and stopped development. \nSnap is a very bad idea on the desktop/server market. There's a reason for code reuse, memory reuse and shared libraries. \nAnd there's a very good reason why a package shall be able to build from source on a platform. And more so when that package is a crypto-vault.\nI think that cryptomator is trying to move into a \"black-box\" \"trust-me all\" binary blob for commercial reasons and there's nothing positive I see in that. Same goes for android version which cannot be build from source.. I tried the server last month. Is there a way to make it work off-line ? \nMy use case is a disconnected road warrior that updates a \"common\" area over a slow link (like remote areas with no broadband capability). \nWebdav won't cut it here and I'll be willing to pay for a pro version of cryptomator stand-alone supporting a serverless environment.\nPlease consider this as an option. \nThank you..

    "felix-wo": "confirming the issue, which is specific for KDE / Dolphin (while it works under GNOME based systems with Natuilus)\nMy report https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/513 includes a quite convenient workaround.. Hi zell-mbc!\nI can confirm basically what you are telling if and only if I have chosen \"webdav\" (not \"dav\") in the settings (gear wheel) > \"WebDAV Schema\". (Now I got the clue what\u2019s actually going wrong \u2026 but hold on, I\u2019ll report that later \u2026)\nThe error situation as you (@zell-mbc) report is actually a little bug (or at least some strange behaviour) of its own. If \"webdav\" is enabled in the settings and we try to open a safe with its correct key for the first time since starting the program:\n- it says \"Verbindung fehlgeschlagen. \u2026\" (german version) \u2013 which is actually correct as the WebDAV URL failed to mount, though the safe is opened (i.e. the decryption is working)\n- it shows a green dot for the safe in the column on the left (correct)\n- the input field \"Passwort\" is still visible with the masqued password, though the safe is already open. Then:\n  - If we click settings (gear whel) and then back on the safe the password is still there! *) I don\u2019t know if that might be a security risk. Anyway it\u2019s confusing. Or:\n  - We can click \"Tresor entsperren\" a second time without retyping the password. The usual diagramm then appears though it (correctly) says \"Verbinden des Laufwerks fehlgeschlagen\" on the bottom.\n*) @zell-mbc : differs from your description; maybe because it was your second try; situation seems to appear only the first time the mounting error occurs\n. Hi there! Sorry for my late reply.\nFirst, I\u2019m not a programmer, and I\u2019ve not inspected the code. I did some investigation with the program and its behavior on my systems (Ubuntu, see above).\n\nWe need to resolve WebDAV-NIO-Adapter's issue 8.\n\nI guess, you mean KIO.\n\nIf you have any idea how to detect whether a system prefers dav: or webdav: or http:, please comment on that issue! :)\n\nAutomatic detection would be nice, of course, but that\u2019s not the issue in the first place. The call under KDE systems obviously is implemented fundamentally wrong. If \"webdav\" is selected under \"webdav Schema\" in Cryptomator ~/.Cryptomator/cryptomator.log shows:\n\ngvfs-open: webdav://localhost:[port]/[id]/[safe_name]: Fehler beim \u00d6ffnen des Ortes: Der angegebene Ort wird nicht unterst\u00fctzt\n\nThis indicates a misconception. gvfs-open never accepts the syntax with the prefix \"webdav://\" for the protocol, but always and only \"dav://\". Anyway, under KDE after opening a safe it is possible to access the share manually with Dolphin (as described above), as Dolphin does not rely on gvfs in this case (WebDAV protocol). But obviously, Dolphin doesn\u2019t get called with \"webdav://\u2026\" as it should.\nOn the other hand, if \"dav\" is selected as \"webdav Schema\", even under a KDE system the share gets mounted correctly by gvfs. (gvfs is installed by default on a KDE Ubuntu derivate, too, as, for example, Dolphin uses gvfs for mounting external drives.) In consequence, the share is also accessible under its conventional mount point in the file system (/run/user/[user-id]/gvfs/[settings_string]/), on the command line or for any application. But this gvfs mount is \u2013 other than under many gtk file managers, which seem to use gvfs internally also for webdav and furter remote mounts \u2013 not even needed to open the webdav share with Dolphin (KDE file manager).\nBe welcome to ask back for further information or investigation..

My patch doesn't add anything specific in this direction, but providing a keychain enables both greyed options, password saving and mounting on program start. I also tested the second part, it seems to works. However, for your purpose you also need to start Cryptomator on login, e.g., with a cryptomator.desktop in ~/.config/autostart/. Depending on what you mean by \"all of my files\" (e.g. if this excludes hidden config files in your home directory or not), this might do the trick.. With ~/.Cryptomator/pwStore: not greyed out, without such a file: greyed out (added a subclause above to make it a bit clearer).  Pointfiles are no problem, but mounting the whole home directory is tricky (not really related to the patch, since Cryptomator already uses e.g. ~/.Cryptomator/settings.json).. It's unlikely that I'll find time before Easter to look into libsecret myself, but the correct place for a libsecret binding would be the native-functions repo, correct?\nAnother question: libsecret is by no means universal, Kubuntu 18.10 does not seem to include it by default (no dependency of plasma-desktop IIRC). If one adds a LinuxFunctions.so to the .jar that is linked against libsecret.so, Java could still catch the link error due to missing libsecret.so, right?.

Both come from from constructors of keychain access classes: the first one from the already existing class for windows (which fails on Linux as expected) and the second one is just a debug message from my new class to check the file path (looks correct). However, I didn't use the correct debug stream(just System.println), so it looks like they belong together.\nYou should check with seahorse whether your password is saved correctly and of course if Cryptomator shows a filled password field after its next start, than it probably worked.. @zell-mbc In this case you might not have secret-tool installed? Originally, it is also a Gnome tool.\nYou might try to replace (in pwStore)\nsecret-tool store --label='Cryptomator' cryptomatorvault \"$2\"\nby\nkwalletcli -f cryptomatorvault -e \"$2\" -P\nand \nsecret-tool lookup cryptomatorvault \"$2\"\nby\nkwalletcli -f cryptomatorvault -e \"$2\"\nand\nsecret-tool clear cryptomatorvault \"$2\"\nby (kwalletcli has no proper delete)\nkwalletcli -f cryptomatorvault -e \"$2\" -p ''\n\nkwalletcli is the KDE4 tool which was ported to KDE5, there is also kwallet-query which is KDE5 only, but can also access other wallets than the default one.. > There might be something here that could help:\n\nhttps://mhogomchungu.github.io/sirikali/\n\nInteresting, especially this part of it:\nhttps://github.com/mhogomchungu/lxqt_wallet\nUnfortunately it seems quite heavy for Cryptomator, but at least it illustrates the use of libsecret for a non-gtk project..

I have same issue when using gvfs.mount instead of davfs2. What I can test is to try mounting some other free webdav services available in internet and see whether I can work with vim (and also a couple of other tools like git, unison) directly on mounted volume.. So, I tested mounting external webdav volumes and here is my feedback.\nI confirm that the issue  with failing file operations still exists for mounts to https://webdavserver.com server. But I also noticed that they use java implementation of webdav server (probably even same library is used as in cryptomator).\nSo I decided to test with another webdav service GMX Mediacenter https://webdav.mc.gmx.net. After mounting I was suprised to observe that all those issues related to I/O are gone. Most probably they are running full-fledged apache server with webdav module enabled, but I'm not sure. As far as I know, there are three webdav related modules available for apache: mod_dav.so, mod_dav_fs.so and mod_dav_lock.so. I suspect, that the functionality of the last one, the lock module, is missing in the java implementation.\nAnyway, for now, as a workaround, I decided to not mounting cryptomator content, but accessing it using this client also written in java http://www.re.be/webdav_sync/index.xhtml. But hope davfs2/gvfs mounts will do work reliably sometime.. I tried that command (only difference to what I used was file_mode=700,dir_mode=700) with no luck.\nPalanteJon, which versions of vim, davfs, linux kernel do you have?. @PalanteJon I've tried it and it did work!

So, using fuse inside cryptomator's java application doesn't address my concerns (because I would still need to have the packages installed).\nLuckily, thanks to your extensive documentation, it is possible to implement other applications that can use cryptomator vaults. If I find the time, I will experiment a bit.\nA command-line application compatible with fstab and e.g. cryptsetup with less dependencies, however, would resolve the issue.\n@markuskreusch \nI don't suppose cryptomator itself is affected by the flaws in webkitgtk+, which is only installed through dependencies. Instead, the security concerns are related to having the package installed at all.\n(And the maintenance/distribution of packages like webkitgtk+, in general).\nThis page contains a list of fixes for the latest version:\nhttps://webkitgtk.org/2017/01/17/webkitgtk2.14.3-released.html\nThese fixes are not distributed quickly enough, which is a problem for people concerned with security and privacy - which the users of cryptomator presumably are. They trust the application and should not have to worry about security issues in libraries installed through package dependencies that are not even necessary to operate a vault. Really, this issue stems from the use of java.\nHere is a note from February 2016 describing a set of issues which still seem to be somewhat valid:\nhttps://blogs.gnome.org/mcatanzaro/2016/02/01/on-webkit-security-updates/\nThis note made me aware of the problem:\nhttps://git.archlinux.org/svntogit/packages.git/commit/trunk/webkitgtk.install?h=packages/webkitgtk&id=8db7e322f2954da5744de2217b1722f69f1a3ce9\nThis email contains a decent overview of packages depending on webkitgitk+ (the thread contains other considerations as well)\nhttps://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-dev-public/2017-January/028634.html\nHoping this doesn't seem too big-headed to you,. +1\nIn the long run, you might want to reconsider giving an offline filesystem a network stack and code-injection as a feature :-p\nMore code -> more attack surface\nRegardless, I am excited about you reducing the dependency graph and (me) using cryptomator!.

It seems that the tests for this component have failed.\nHere is the build error log (It was very longer I copied the last part):\n```\nResults :\nTests in error:\n  testMasterkeyDecryptionWithWrongPassphrase(org.cryptomator.crypto.engine.impl.\nCryptorImplTest): Unexpected exception, expected but was\n  testMasterkeyDecryptionWithCorrectPassphrase(org.cryptomator.crypto.engine.imp\nl.CryptorImplTest): Invalid key.\n  testMasterkeyEncryption(org.cryptomator.crypto.engine.impl.CryptorImplTest): I\nnvalid key.\n  testEncryptionAndDecryptionSpeed(org.cryptomator.crypto.engine.impl.FileConten\ntCryptorImplTest): test timed out after 20000 milliseconds\n  testEncryptionAndDecryption(org.cryptomator.crypto.engine.impl.FileContentCryp\ntorImplTest): java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: java.lang.IllegalStateExc\neption: File content key created by current class invalid.\n  testPassthroughException(org.cryptomator.crypto.engine.impl.FileContentDecrypt\norImplTest): Unexpected exception, expected but wa\ns\n  testPartialDecryption(org.cryptomator.crypto.engine.impl.FileContentDecryptorI\nmplTest): Unable to compute encrypted header.\n  testDecryption(org.cryptomator.crypto.engine.impl.FileContentDecryptorImplTest\n): Unable to decrypt header.\n  testManipulatedDecryptionWithSuppressedAuthentication(org.cryptomator.crypto.e\nngine.impl.FileContentDecryptorImplTest): Unable to decrypt header.\n  testManipulatedContentDecryption(org.cryptomator.crypto.engine.impl.FileConten\ntDecryptorImplTest): Unexpected exception, expected but was\n  testEncryption(org.cryptomator.crypto.engine.impl.FileContentEncryptorImplTest\n): java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Fil\ne content key created by current class invalid.\n  testDecryption(org.cryptomator.crypto.engine.impl.FileHeaderPayloadTest): Unab\nle to decrypt header.\n  testEncryption(org.cryptomator.crypto.engine.impl.FileHeaderPayloadTest): Unab\nle to compute encrypted header.\n  testDecryption(org.cryptomator.crypto.engine.impl.FileHeaderTest): Unable to d\necrypt header.\n  testDecryptionOfOldHeader(org.cryptomator.crypto.engine.impl.FileHeaderTest):\nUnable to decrypt header.\n  testEncryption(org.cryptomator.crypto.engine.impl.FileHeaderTest): Unable to c\nompute encrypted header.\n  testDecryptionOfManipulatedFilename(org.cryptomator.crypto.engine.impl.Filenam\neCryptorImplTest): Unexpected exception, expected but was\n  testEncryptionOfSameFilenamesWithDifferentAssociatedData(org.cryptomator.crypt\no.engine.impl.FilenameCryptorImplTest): cipher.init(...) already invoked success\nfully earlier with same parameters.\n  testDeterministicEncryptionOfFilenames(org.cryptomator.crypto.engine.impl.File\nnameCryptorImplTest): cipher.init(...) already invoked successfully earlier with\n same parameters.\n  testDeterministicEncryptionOfFilenamesWithWrongAssociatedData(org.cryptomator.\ncrypto.engine.impl.FilenameCryptorImplTest): Unexpected exception, expected but was\n  testDeterministicEncryptionOfFilenamesWithAssociatedData(org.cryptomator.crypt\no.engine.impl.FilenameCryptorImplTest): cipher.init(...) already invoked success\nfully earlier with same parameters.\n  testDeterministicHashingOfDirectoryIds(org.cryptomator.crypto.engine.impl.File\nnameCryptorImplTest): cipher.init(...) already invoked successfully earlier with\n same parameters.\n  testChangePassphraseWithIncorrectPassword(org.cryptomator.filesystem.crypto.Ma\nsterkeysTest): Unexpected exception, expected but was\n  testInitialize(org.cryptomator.filesystem.crypto.MasterkeysTest): Invalid key.\ntestChangePassphraseWithCorrectPassword(org.cryptomator.filesystem.crypto.Mast\nerkeysTest): Invalid key.\nTests run: 66, Failures: 0, Errors: 25, Skipped: 2\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[INFO] Reactor Summary:\n[INFO]\n[INFO] Cryptomator ........................................

Thus you could maybe just increase the test timeouts.\nModule build durations from my system (i7-4700HQ, 16GB RAM, SSD) as\nreference:\n[INFO] Cryptomator ........................................

So I changed number of encrypt/decrypt test loops from 1000 to 10 and then the test passed with following times:\nI noticed that my Win Vista is running a killing Microsoft update service which used 50% of cpu and other resources. But for the following test with 10 iteration of encrypt/decrypt loops That service was stoped.\nSo I am wondering why a task that 1000 iterations of it has been considered to run in at most 20 seconds, just 10 iteration of it is taking 38s on my laptop. This is while other tasks are just slower relative to markuskreusch computer just about 2-3x slower. That is strange.\nDoes Cryptomator encryption engine used a hardware acceleration for AES which my relatively old CPU misses it?\nThanks again.\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[INFO] Reactor Summary:\n[INFO]\n[INFO] Cryptomator ........................................

Hi Markus,\nThanks for your complete description. Specially for pointing to possible pieces of code to be changed for customization.\nAbout the complexity of the total task I guessed previously (from observation of application footprints on file system) that it is not just encryption of data or file names. I see something like folder flattening and then maintaining the structure by some kind of linkage data.\nSo the simple code example I wrote before was just too simple. In practice user may need to inherit more class/interfaces and overwrite more methods. But the idea is that the custom developer does not need to change your code. That will provide the chance that developer can update customized app to your later versions since he/she has not changed any byte of your app. Developer has just wrote and put a few class/methods in a predefined folder or add their name to a config file or as an option to the make script. So its is possible that the customized code be useful up to multiple seamless version updates. Some kind of plugin based extension.\nAlso I must mention that my purpose is not providing gui/user configurable encryption algorithms. But just inclusion of completely user defined custom (not generic known) ciphers.\nIt is true that AES and other algorithms are current best methods. But I think accounting on just a key which can be braked by some one which has powerful computation power is not wise specially when all encrypted data and keys are to be stored on the cloud.\nSo some one may need to become more sure by adding other personal key/algorithm based layers. That version would be personal.\nSo the target of this feature is not ordinary end users, but those who are get source code and would like to change it to match their needs. They are developers but if possible would like to derived their customized code in the simplest and lowest cost way. Specially keeping in the mind the possibility of quick update to future releases.\nThanks again :). ",
    "PhilZ-cwm6": "Any answer about this ?. In fact, I never used windows explorer for this. I have big data files synchronized over a few machines using an encrypted USB key.\nTo handle the files offline, I use 2 tools: Beyond Compare for manual operations and FreeFileSync for automated local syncs.\nPayed: http://www.scootersoftware.com/features.php\nFree: http://www.freefilesync.org/\nI can definately copy the long file paths in different locations on windows using both tools.\nLong paths can be synchronized to my Linux NAS, my NTFS USB key, and my local NTFS HDD with both tools.\nThey can handle properly hidden linux files and long path names under windows. Explorer and most apps cannot.\nHowever, both FreeFileSync and Beyond Compare cannot copy the files to the webdav server.\nWindows allows long path names to be managed by dedicated tools. However, it seems the webdav server cannot support it.\nWhat webdav server you suggest, as I am looking for something robust and reliable ?\nMany thanks for your input\n. a last note to my above detailed message: Windows 10 does allow handling long paths up to 4k through a special registry entry, so we just need a good webdav server to handle it too. Thank you for your input,\nHowever, don't draw fast conclusions please.\nWhat actually happens is that the webdav server cannot cope with the long path, the file is deleted despite FreeFileSync or Beyond Compare and similar tools could write it.\nThe issue is not with FFS or Beyond Compare but probably with the the cryptomator webddav server or the windows webdav client\nMay you answer these 2 points:\n1- does copying long paths to the webdav server work under windows 10 once long paths enabled ?\nhttps://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/jeremykuhne/2016/07/30/net-4-6-2-and-long-paths-on-windows-10/\n2- in your above test using Free File Sync, did you use native windows webdav client or Cyberduck webdav client?\nMy hope with this ticket was not to debug windows or third party tools like you are thinking. I am just asking you to get us the option to support long paths in windows by using an alternate mount method or by pointing to an alternative webdav client that supports long paths.\nWindows, even the Seven, does support long paths and many linux special chars, but you just need specific tools like FFS and Beyond Compare to handle them.\n. Fix found:\nI tried 2 alternate webdav clients:\nMountain Duck and DirectNet Drive\nBoth will enable support for long paths under windows, obviously using dedicated sync tools like Beyond Compare or FreeFileSync or alternative tools to windows explorer\nMaybe this should be added to the FAQ. This also confirms that your webdav server supports long paths under windows, but we just need to use proper clients and tools\nPS: sorry because I confused in my posts above webdav client and webdav server. thanks\nPlease look at my other ticket, so that we can use an alternate webdav client and not having to manually unmount the drive for windows client used by Cryptomator. just more feedback:\n- Mountain Duck hangs frequently on sync operations using FreeFileSync, mainly on copying / renaming big files +1.5 Gb. Windows client never ever gave any freeze or error\n- I will give a longer feedback on DirectNetDrive. But still, when we will unlock vault in Cryptomator, it will mount a webdav drive in windows, unless this option is added, right ?\nOk, read the wiki for mountain duck upcoming feature, looks nice. One issue: Mountain Duck, unlike Cyber Duck, is not open source if I am not wrong. \nAnd still this doesn't answer my question: option to use alternative webdav client without always forcing a mount to the windows webdav client. Same issue for me\nWas working fine under Windows 7\nInstalled windows 10 from scratch and now no text in tray icon menu\nReverting to 1.3.1 to test, fixes the tray icon menu. not fixed in 1.3.4. A more testing looks like it is not related necessarly to destination path length:\n\nFiles in this screen shot are under this path:\nZ:\\My Docs\\Personal\\Administrations\\2015.08.13_D\u00e9gats Eaux Villars 2010\\Devis et factures infiltration d'eau en fin de travaux\\Photos envoy\u00e9e a RC Sanitaire\nSadly, for me, since I moved to windows 10, Cryptomator is unusable. Using Webdrive to mount the webdav path fixed the issue\nI have all my files in sync without any error or filename modification\nSo it seems related to the webdav windows 10 client and encoding in file names maybe. I had no issues under windows 7 with same container and files. I wanted to confirm again, that my 2x daily syncs work perfectly on the Webdrive webdav client\nLet me know if I should close the issue or you want to look into it or it is a known limitation in webdav win 10 client for some types of path encoding. - I created a new vault from scratch\n- I tried to create this file path again, by copying file from a D: drive:\nX:\\My Docs\\Personal\\Administrations\\2013.01.10_D\u00e9gats Eaux Sarogan 2013\\Devis et factures infiltration d'eau en fin de travaux\\Photos envoy\u00e9e a AS Plomberie\\7a-buanderie mur gauche - trou.jpg\n- I get the screenshot\nUsing Webdrive 3 to mount the drive doesn't cause issues. I had no issues for same paths under windows 7\nBasically, it seems to create a second wired file name termination. Both files cannot be accessed or deleted\n\n. Thank you for confirming the issue\nJust to add that mounting using Webdrive 3 we can copy files without issue. Not sure if it is the Cryptomator server or Windows 10 client.... Well, I can assure you I have the long path names enabled since I first installed windows 10. It was one of my main motivations to migrate from win7 to win 10\nAlso, the assumption that Windows Explorer fails is wrong, since I can perfectly browse long paths created outside the windows webdav client (USB key, hard-drive...), or even those inside WebDrive webDAV client. I am not sure I could understand all your internal testing conclusions. However, just a note, did you well notice that using South River WebDrive client to mount the cryptomator vault makes it possible to browse through long pathes without any issue ? This obviously confirms that the issue could be in windows 10 webdav client and not windows explorer. I will asap, but will have to wait as I cannot afford to test beta pre-releases right now\nMany thanks for all your work. did not have time to install beta to test, sorry.

Would be great if a 1.3x update fixes it so that we have a proper webdav version, until all dokany issues are ironed out for a stable daily use, mainly speed. will this be fixed to allow a properly working Webdav alternative, until Dokany gets faster and stable ?\nBest regards.

Instead, it returns the following message:\nlsof: WARNING: can't stat() webdav file system /Volumes/Aleph-2\n      Output information may be incomplete.\n      assuming \"dev=32000004\" from mount table\nThis stat attempt to /Volumes/Aleph-2 seems to trigger something, because now, after a few seconds, the Finder opens a message saying that the WebDAV server has been unexpectedly disconnected. It gives me the option to ignore this fact or to eject the share. When I eject the share, things work normally again, meaning that on the next unlock, the mount is called /Volume/Aleph again.. Unfortunately, after days of flawless operation, the problem is now re-occurring for me. After turning on the Mac, I started Cryptomater and unlocked the folder. This lead to the (MacOS) error message \"Beim Verbinden mit dem Server \u201elocalhost\u201c ist ein Fehler aufgetreten.\" (roughly \"An error has occurred  when connecting to server 'localhost'\". After that, Cryptomator showed the folder as unlocked, but there were two empty directories in /Volumes, \"CryptomatorFolder\" and \"CryptomatorFolder-1\" (\"CryptomatorFolder\" being the name of the Cryptomator folder).\nLocking and unlocking the folder shows the same result, regardless if I delete both /Volumes folders, or if I keep them. Cryptomator, though, shows the respective folder as unlocked. I am able to manually connect to this folder using the Finder menu \"Mit Server verbinden...\" (\"Connect to server...\"). This leads to the Cryptomator folder being available as /Volumes/CryptomatorFolder-2.\nAfter that, and after locking the Cryptomator folder and exiting Cryptomator, I cannot  rmdir /Volumes/CryptomatorFolder-2 for a while, the error message being \"CryptomatorFolder-2: Resource busy\". After a minute or so, I can delete the folder, /Volumes now containing no Cryptomator folder at all.\nNow comes the interesting part: When I restart Cryptomator and unlock the folder again, this works - but the three folders /Volumes/Cryptomator, /Volumes/Cryptomator-1 and /Volumes/Cryptomator-2 reappear (!), which the former two being empty and /Volumes/Cryptomator-2 being the actual mount point for the Cryptomator folder.\nSince it worked so well for a number of days, I take it for granted that, after rebooting, it will continue to work normally for a while, and that this is a very random bug..

    "endbacher": "Hallo @tobihagemann \nsorry if I was not clear enough, my approach was a more general consideration (not limited to specific desktop or mobile versions) of free / open source systems support to make encryption more user-friendly / easier for people in times where data is not stored (only) on local drive anymore but supporting this directly in Cryptomator. With increasing number of programs / apps involved from different parties I see the risk of things getting too complicated (thinking of my parents generation, security vs. user-friendlyness like for most security related apps) or possible data corruption by user-handling or software. This is why (if managable from technical and resources point of view of course) the idea was to just enter for example Nextcloud URL, user name and passworts for both cloud and encrypted content and being done with setup in unique as easy as possible handling across devices (one might also think of transferring required data from desktop pc to mobile device via a barcode and photo).\n\nWe won't integrate cloud storage services directly. In the future, you could use Cyberduck and Mountain Duck to do so.\n\nThis togehter with #326 partly answers the question - the non-integration of cloud storage on desktop is something one could cover by workarounds via cloud service clients or cyberduck (unfortunately only available for Windows) but for mobile devices there are not much alternatives as most native apps are too limited from technical point of view or too complicated to use for average users and with limited space on devices keeping local copies is not really the way to go. If you see chances are higher for mobile in future then please move this to Android section.   . ",

It seems whenever I do that, that is when it fails. If I keep the window open on my desktop (open as in not minimized or closed), cryptomator continues to work perfectly. It might be that for some reason, Windows doesn't seem to like it when its closed or minimized. Hope this helps for something.. ",

When I delete the shared folder SVGs I get a casual confirmation dialogue. Confirming with yes the folder disappears - but after a short while anf the press of F5 it's there, again.. Other folders that have made problems were in the same vault, but after upgrading to 1.3.3 we could delete them without any trouble. But I don't remember their path anymore....

I did some testing and currently I have even more problems with Visual Studio + Cryptomator when using DOKANY.\nLatest Visual Studio 2017 (v15.7.5).\nIn this test it was a smaller project that contains an additional project, that is only a logging.dll.\nWhen opening the Solution from the Vault that is mounted with DOKANY, Visual Studio is complaining multiple times that files have been modified from \"externally\". This was even more happening while I was still copying another project to the drive with many files.\nBut even later, when nothing was writing in the background anymore, I never was able to compile the solution:\n```\nDOKANY:\n[Failure] File was externally modified: B:\\XXX\\YYY\\Conf.cs.\n1>------ Build started: Project: Logging, Configuration: Debug x64 ------\n1>  Logging -> B:\\XXX\\Logging\\bin\\x64\\Debug\\Logging.dll\n2>------ Build started: Project: YYY, Configuration: Debug x64 ------\n2>C:\\WINDOWS\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\Microsoft.WinFx.targets(268,9): error MC1000: Unknown build error, 'Could not load file or assembly 'file:///B:\\XXX\\Logging\\bin\\x64\\Debug\\Logging.dll' or one of its dependencies. Could not find or load a specific file. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131621)' \n========== Build: 1 succeeded, 1 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped ==========\n```\nLater I mounted the same Vault with WEBDAV, and it was compiling:\n```\nWEBDAV:\n1>------ Build started: Project: Logging, Configuration: Debug x64 ------\n1>  Logging -> Z:\\XXX\\Logging\\bin\\x64\\Debug\\Logging.dll\n2>------ Build started: Project: XXX, Configuration: Debug x64 ------\n2>  YYY -> Z:\\XXX\\YYY\\bin\\x64\\Debug\\YYY.exe\n========== Build: 2 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped ==========\n```\nThe copy-job for the bigger project was often stopping completely (speed: 0 bytes/s) and once throwing an error, that not enough system recources are availabe for the copy job (but I could resume later) when Visual Studio was loading a project.\nSome screenshots:\n\n\n\n\n. Many thanks for the prompt reply!\nI will try it with Cyberduck.\nI really cannot tell how I achieved that!\nI started with an 1.2.x-version and upgraded multiple times.\nJust found out as I am working with git from commandline and wanted to list my files and was suprised that the directory could not see any files when I was using lowercase, as it always was not be a difference on Windows.\n. I installed Cyberduck, copied the WebDav-URL from the unlocked Cryptomator Vault (using Cryptomator), and successfully connected in Cyberduck by pasting the URL to the quick connect input field and pressing enter.\nI see my files but I only see the folder \"Dev\" with all my files in it, not the folder \"dev\".. \"Files in Abc could not be renamed, Explorer told me they did not exist. \"\nYes exactly those problems I have from time to time and reported it especially with Visual Studio (https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/519). Sometimes it seems to work after some time, I sometimes try to do a search with explorer and I \"feel\" like it might sometimes help to be able to access files again (maybe it has nothing to do with it) ... but I moved away from trying to open projectsa directly from Cryptomator, I now use git to clone from Cryptomator to lokal disk and open the projects loakally and push changes back with git inside Visual Studio to the Cryptomator repository.\n. Update:\nI found out more.\nYou can acces EVERY directory that exists on the drive one time with a capital letter and wihtout!\nAnd now it depends if the directory really has a capital letter or not that it can displays the content.\n. Some more fun:\n\nI created a new vault with Cryptomator v1.3.3 and mounted it to Y:\ncreated the following folders in Explorer on that drive:\nDaten\nTest\nklein\nKlein\n\nThe last one disappeared after creating it, but without an error.\n\nstarted cmd.exe\n```\nY:>cd test\n\nY:\\test>dir\n Volume in drive Y has no label.\n Volume Serial Number is 0000-0000\nDirectory of Y:\\test\nFile Not Found\nY:\\test>cd ..\nY:>cd Test\nY:\\Test>dir\n Volume in drive Y has no label.\n Volume Serial Number is 0000-0000\nDirectory of Y:\\Test\n11.01.2018  07:58              .\n11.01.2018  07:58              ..\n               0 File(s)              0 bytes\n               2 Dir(s)   4.405.776.384 bytes free\nY:\\Test>cd daten\nThe system cannot find the path specified.\nY:\\Test>cd ..\nY:>cd daten\nY:\\daten>dier\n'dier' is not recognized as an internal or external command,\noperable program or batch file.\nY:\\daten>dir\n Volume in drive Y has no label.\n Volume Serial Number is 0000-0000\nDirectory of Y:\\daten\nFile Not Found\nY:\\daten>cd ..\nY:>dir\n Volume in drive Y has no label.\nDirectory of Y:\\\n11.01.2018  07:58              .\n11.01.2018  07:58              ..\n11.01.2018  07:58              Daten\n11.01.2018  07:58              klein\n11.01.2018  07:58              Klein\n11.01.2018  07:58              Test\n               0 File(s)              0 bytes\n               6 Dir(s)   4.405.747.712 bytes free\n```\nThen I created a new textfile in Explorer in the directory y:\\klein and it showed up without a problem.\n```\nY:>cd klein\nY:\\klein>dir\n Volume in drive Y has no label.\nDirectory of Y:\\klein\n11.01.2018  07:59              .\n11.01.2018  07:59              ..\n11.01.2018  07:59                 0 klein.txt\n               1 File(s)              0 bytes\n               2 Dir(s)   4.405.678.080 bytes free\n```\nNow comes the funny thing:\nI creaded a new textfile with the commandline: notepad y:\\Klein\\Klein2.txt and saved the file.\n```\nY:\\klein>cd ..\nY:>cd Klein\nY:\\Klein>dir\n Volume in drive Y has no label.\nDirectory of Y:\\Klein\n11.01.2018  07:58              .\n11.01.2018  07:58              ..\n               0 File(s)              0 bytes\n               2 Dir(s)   4.405.678.080 bytes free\nY:\\Klein>notepad Y:\\Klein\\Klein2.txt\nY:\\Klein>dir\n Volume in drive Y has no label.\nDirectory of Y:\\Klein\n11.01.2018  07:59              .\n11.01.2018  07:59              ..\n11.01.2018  07:59                 0 Klein2.txt\n               1 File(s)              0 bytes\n               2 Dir(s)   4.405.612.544 bytes free\nY:\\Klein>cd ..\nY:>dir\n Volume in drive Y has no label.\nDirectory of Y:\\\n11.01.2018  07:58              .\n11.01.2018  07:58              ..\n11.01.2018  07:58              Daten\n11.01.2018  07:59              klein\n11.01.2018  07:59              Klein\n11.01.2018  07:58              Test\n               0 File(s)              0 bytes\n               6 Dir(s)   4.405.612.544 bytes free\n```\nNow I can see both directories in Explorer!\n\n. Thanks for the explanation. The good thing is that a solution is already in development with Dokany or similar, so sooner or later this should be no problem anymore.\nUntil then I think I will need to simply copy the files from webdav to a windows file system to avoid problems with programs, like I already do when clonging with git from the webdav drive to a lokal disk..

A little addition: this problem does not occur in Windows 10 Pro 64bit, Version 1703 (Build 15063.483; this is the current Windows version). \nSo it might be in fact a problem with Windows itself, rendering this issue unnecessary.\nThanks for your patience!.

I just hit this issue myself right now, attempting to update to the latest release (that is, cryptomator stated it couldn't update it - not that the installer aborted). I use Webroot AV myself. I turned off Webroot protection temporarily, and the install proceeded. You might want to include a notice/warning in the install to turn off AV temporarily for this reason.. Actually - at least with Webroot - not even an admin-mode editor can modify the hosts file. It's pretty hardcore - only way to edit is to either turn off the whole application temporarily (easiest/fastest) or go into the settings and uncheck 'prevent any program from modifying the HOSTs file'. But then if you forget and leave it unchecked, it'll remain unprotected, whereas webroot will re-enable itself after several minutes, automatically. \nI think the notice as written might cause more trouble - people trying to edit the hosts file rather than disabling AV, and then getting frustrated at not being able to change it? \nPerhaps just a notice at the start recommending that AV be turned off while installer is running - with a reminder at the end to turn the AV back on.. Sure - I certainly understand your concern. I agree that it's good to explain what specifically the installer is doing with the hosts file. \nSince this is an open source application, any 'monkey business' would be rapidly discovered. So users have the assurance of transparency in that regard. \nOver the years, I've installed maybe....four? commercial applications that recommended turning off AV during install. So it's uncommon, but it does happen. Unfortunately I can't recall the names of any of them!. ",

Maybe this was Ubuntu 17.10 related and was fixed in os updates? But to be honest, I didn't copy large amounts of data around and didn't use it too intensively.\nUpdate\nUsing a fresh Ubuntu 18.04 installation it starts hanging again, same as before. I'm awayting the 1.4.0 update and will report back.. Can confirm that it works with FUSE: I installed 1.4.0-beta2 via ppa (18.04/Bionic) and I encrypted 600 k files / 160 GB which would never run though even for a small part on 1.3.X and I can even open Spreadsheet files in LibreOffice directly from the Vault - which stopped working on 1.3.X with 18.04. I've OpenJDK version \"10.0.2\" installed.\n\nThis is a beta version! Make backups and don't use this version for production data. \n\nHow bad is it? I made a backup but would use this now for production as I guess this is only a \"to be sure\" warning? :-)\nGreat work !! :+1: . @overheadhunter \nThe directory I find the files for this vault is ~/.Cryptomator/credentialsQ2RmxXxXxXxX/\nI backed up and deleted the files in the directory ~/.Cryptomator/credentialsQ2RmxXxXxXxX/ which solved the problem, was too obvious but I thought I have to unmount something which is still mounted.\nThanks alot !!. In my case I think the problem was that KeePassX 2.0.3 saved the keestore to this location after I locked the vault. So it's probably a user error. I use a symlink (ln -s) which points from my home dir to ~/.Cryptomator/credentials***/ btw.. > I would expect Cryptomator to clear the folder contents when starting a new session.\nUncool: This would delete passwords or master keys added to (in this case) the keystore which were safed after the volumne was (accidently) closed.\nShowing an error, that the mount folder (display the path for convenience) is not empty should be enough..

Thank you for the quick follow up.\nFor 1: Each individual file gives me the error I shared,  and they don't have zeros in the beginning. The names match the files I see in the encrypted directory. By the way, I also see each *.lng file cannot be inflated error intermixed as well. The file's names do not have a zero in the beginning there either. The very first error is the lng file, but it doesn't seem special in terms of the specific error.\nI also wanted to point out that these are not zero byte files. They seem to have the correct \"size\", and based on that it seems unlikely to me that they all be \"missing\" data. If i had to guess, i think there is a foreign key relationship somewhere in the taxonomy to serialize and deserialize this data which is either corrupted or not available for some reason to walk the tree, or perhaps some other dependency is missing or wasn't generated.\nIf you want can you explain to me the chain of files you use and how they map to the encrypted files? I could tell if you something is missing zero byte etc.\nFor 2: The file in the root directory which i mentioned wasn't corrupted and worked fine. There are no discernible errors with the file. \nFor 3: I dropped a file in a new folder called \"test\" and it both encrypted and decrypted fine. In other words I was able to read and find the file out without any issues. In this sense it doesn't appear to be a reproducible hardware problem, or entirely deterministic. . ",

The spreadsheet that I used to make my drive disappear is a .ods OpenDocument spreadsheet. It is 159kb in size, and I am using LibreOffice version 5.4.1.2 to edit this file.

After installing the MacOS 10.13.1 update, I opened up my LibreOffice spreadsheet in my Cryptomator drive, copy and pasted cell formatting to another row, and saved the changes. The drive disappeared in a little over three minutes. The 10.13.1 update did not resolve the issue.. I would like to share an observation that I just discovered.  I installed Cryptomator 1.3.2, and was testing if the this issue was fixed in the new version. The issue still occurred, which is not surprising since this bug is still open. I did however discover that the bug did not trigger if I quit LibreOffice, and save the spreadsheet changes at the confirmation dialog. The bug will also not trigger if the changes are saved, then you quit the application quickly following the save. It seems, at least the case with spreadsheets, that the Cryptomator drive will dismount unexpectedly, if changes are saved and the application is left open between the 3 to 5 minute time period.. ",

Hopefully it'll help the developer. @overheadhunter In the log file I sent you, I remounted the vault before closing it manually and then took the log file out. So the end line is not where the bug happened. If you look around a little, for example at line 20391 (15:49:00.768) vs 20392 (15:50:08.180), this is probably where I remounted the vault. Just below, there is \"Connection: close at line 20404\"... I can try to get another log later otherwise. LMK.

A 100 character long string of just 'x' has a strength of 1 according to zxcvbn, due to the low entropy. The same goes for \"passwordpassword...\" to a length of 104 - someone might think it's clever to paste \"password\" 13 times as some kind of shortcut, have it evaluated as \"strong\", and get the wrong idea about how good a password it is (it isn't).\nIt would probably be better to truncate the string to the longest it can be without causing an issue, and still pass it to zxcvbn (as in the comment by @markuskreusch above)..

Once you mount an encrypted volume, it will automatically disconnect/drop as soon as you start trying to add a significant number of files to it.

For example it is not being maintained by the community after the push made by Canonical, it also still depends on an LSM like AppArmor (Solus OS had to integrate it into the system to offer all the features of the format, something I doubt all distros want to do) .\nI would even encourage you to look a little more Flatpak now, since I have seen complex applications that use Java working perfectly. AppImage is fine, but you have to give execution permissions and put it \"somewhere\" manually before it works, it also requires a lot of manual intervention if you need to run advanced features, such as installing appimaged or sanboxed with firejail..

Goodbye.\n```. So @overheadhunter, is there a way to control where these files are stored:\n\n.ipcPort.tmp \u2013 created in the user's home directory, and it actually goes away once the application is closed\nic2_something.log (or something like that) \u2013 created when there are some error with the JVM\n\nI guess that wouldn't be a problem when #710 is addressed, but I would like to know if there is one of those -D settings I can use in the meantime.\nOn a different note, @bilelmoussaoui, would you want to team up on this one? I've seen that you are pretty good on these things...and for instance, right now I can't even figure it out how to install fuse 3 :rofl:. > @x80486 you can use -Dcryptomator.ipcPortPath\nGreat! I'll use it to force the file to be created (and recreated) inside $HOME/.Cryptomator until you start using the Freedesktop XDG Standard.\n\nBtw: How did you include the JVM? Or is it an external dependency?\n\nA compatible JRE (version 10.0.2+13) is included in the Flatpak \"container\" itself \u2014 as a dependency. Same for fuse and whatever is needed for WebDAV...so it should behave exactly the same between distros \ud83e\udd1e\nOn a different subject, I'm just reusing the generated JAR file from your build. I believe that Flathub folks like to build the artifact from scratch, but I don't see the need for Java applications; once you have the generated JAR, it's only a matter of guaranteeing the compatible JRE in order to run it successfully...but let's see how that goes. That's why I was poking on the OpenJFX issue, because if that's included we wouldn't even need to provide that dependency since the (fat) JAR would have all contained.\nI don't know what's your preference on that.. > We should not build everything from source. This is not the way Maven works. There are already plenty pre-compiled libraries involved anyway. Instead I'll try to split our CI build process into two stages. The first stage creates a \"directory\" containing the ELF executable as well as the stripped-down JRE and all the libraries. The second stage will then build the AppImage. You can then get the artifact from the fist stage and wrap it into a Flatpak package.\nI agree, there is no need for that if some other process is taken care of it already. Eventually, all of that output would have to be published somewhere.\nI don't know what's the content of that ELF executable; is that something platform-dependent or a wrapper for a fat JAR? I was under the assumption that you were delivering a \"fat\" JAR file with everything required (including JavaFX / OpenFX, in the future) to run it as java -jar /path/to/Cryptomator.jar.. Maybe I didn't get it, but I was under the impression that, if I download appdir.tar.gz, extract everything, and run ./appdir/Cryptomator/Cryptomator it should work without any other (run-time) dependency...but I'm getting this:\n```shell\nFeb 15 19:25:17 pacific systemd[1489]: Starting Tracker metadata extractor...\nFeb 15 19:25:17 pacific systemd-coredump[3596]: Removed old coredump core.Cryptomator.1000.6fdda7ef26a145968235b9d4cf3e8474.3349.1550276694000000.lz4.\nFeb 15 19:25:17 pacific dbus-daemon[1518]: [session uid=1000 pid=1518] Successfully activated service 'org.freedesktop.Tracker1.Miner.Extract'\nFeb 15 19:25:17 pacific systemd[1489]: Started Tracker metadata extractor.\nFeb 15 19:25:18 pacific systemd-coredump[3596]: Process 3547 (Cryptomator) of user 1000 dumped core.\n                                            Stack trace of thread 3592:\n                                            #0  0x00007f69a6c9153f raise (libc.so.6)\n                                            #1  0x00007f69a6c7b895 abort (libc.so.6)\n                                            #2  0x00007f69986b9b39 n/a (/var/home/machina/Downloads/appdir/Cryptomator/runtime/lib/server/libjvm.so)\n                                            #3  0x00007f69988e2569 n/a (/var/home/machina/Downloads/appdir/Cryptomator/runtime/lib/server/libjvm.so)\n                                            #4  0x00007f69988e2deb n/a (/var/home/machina/Downloads/appdir/Cryptomator/runtime/lib/server/libjvm.so)\n                                            #5  0x00007f69988e2e1e n/a (/var/home/machina/Downloads/appdir/Cryptomator/runtime/lib/server/libjvm.so)\n                                            #6  0x00007f69986c4950 n/a (/var/home/machina/Downloads/appdir/Cryptomator/runtime/lib/server/libjvm.so)\n                                            #7  0x00007f69986b8538 n/a (/var/home/machina/Downloads/appdir/Cryptomator/runtime/lib/server/libjvm.so)\n                                            #8  0x00007f69a6c915c0 __restore_rt (libc.so.6)\n                                            #9  0x00007f6990638830 n/a (n/a)\n                                            #10 0x0000000000000000 n/a (n/a)\n\nFeb 15 19:25:18 pacific audit[1]: SERVICE_STOP pid=1 uid=0 auid=4294967295 ses=4294967295 subj=system_u:system_r:init_t:s0 msg='unit=systemd-coredump@1-3595-0 comm=\"systemd\" exe=\"/usr/lib/systemd/systemd\" hostname=? addr=? terminal=? res=success'\n```\n...and I do have glibc-2.28-26.fc29.x86_64 that includes libc.so.6 (although I don't know much about these stuff):\nshell\n[machina@pacific ~]$ rpm -ql glibc-2.28-26.fc29.x86_64\n...\n/lib64/libc.so.6\n/lib64/libdl-2.28.so\n/lib64/libm-2.28.so\n/lib64/libm.so.6\n/lib64/libmvec-2.28.so\nI do see the JAR files there, so it looks like that wouldn't be an issue when this runs.

It would be a matter of changing the location for the .tar.gz file and removing some of the dependencies, like JavaFX, and probably the Java Runtime Environment..

Funny thing is, if I use the JAR version: Cryptomator-1.4.0.jar, FUSE works fine. Let me see what's going on here, but I assume what you are trying to do (the ELF executable) works.. I've tried to use Freedesktop 18.08 from time to time, but WebDAV doesn't work...and I know why: there are some dependencies in GNOME 3.30 not present in Freedesktop 18.08 that makes it happen \u2013 I just don't know what are those :rofl:\nWhen the Flatpak becomes stable (and before submitting it to Flathub) I can dig those; I already tried gvfs alone...no luck. I would also want to use libfuse 3.x but I think that needs some serious modifications to make it work in Flatpak.\nThe comments can be added, but once you work on a couple of manifests you realize they are not needed \u2013 and you might get some heat from reviewers in Flathub because of that :sunglasses:. I'm using GNOME on Wayland:\nshell\n$ lspci | grep -e VGA -e 3D\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Device 3e92\n$ echo $XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP\nGNOME\n$ echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE\nwayland. OK, I get it. I know I don't have (any library for) GTK+ 2.x installed, so that's the issue. I tried on a different VM with the same environment settings, plus GTK 2 and it works fine.\nI will work in such a way until the Flatpak (count me in if you need help with this one) is ready then! Thanks for the tip!. ...are you going to include all OpenJFX dependencies also in the (final) JAR? In the current release, 1.4.0, if JavaFX is not in the classpath the application doesn't start.\nI think you might want to entertain the idea of bundling all the required JavaFX modules in the (final) JAR \u2013 unless there is something else I'm not aware of. It's easier and nowadays space is not really a concern.. The Java Packager is something you can easily circumvent by using: maven-shade-plugin \u2013 just a suggestion. In that sense you can just have the required dependencies on the POM file and a simple ./mvnw clean package should do the work. It doesn't matter the actual fragmentation as long as JavaFX can be pulled in as a dependency...or at least what's needed from it.. No, it does not; that only gives you a JAR file ready to be used anywhere \u2013 but you know that already :wink:\nI forgot you are shipping \"native\" packages for Windows and macOS :sweat_smile:.

You are right that not many implement 100.0% of the standard, and they don't have to.  RFC 5280 for PKI is a good example. They first implement what people use and probably will use. stuff that are rarely or ever used often wont be implemented. Especially not is in huge complex standards. Arbitrary elliptic curve support is a good PKI crypto example that just a few crypto softwares in the world have implemented... \nNow... \nMy opinion is that symlinks does not count to there rare cases and should have been there from very early releases.\nBut now it at least  is on the table :).

Deleting this file fixes the lockout as suggested by aethys256\nExample/duplication\nIn my case I was using KeePass, which had a database file open from the mounted drive. I shutdown without closing either Cryptomator or keepass. I was not paying close attention but I believe I was prompted that Cryptomator was preventing shutdown.\nAfter reboot I was unable to decrypt the folder. When I checked the corresponding folder in .cryptomator, the only file that was left in the folder was the database used by Keepass. Removing this allowed me to unlock the drive.\nWhat Might be happening\nI think one of two things could have happened (although I would appeal to a developer). \n\nKeepass was set to auto save on close, so it saved a file in the mounted folder directory after Cryptomator had already cleared the drive.\nKeepass prevented Crypotmator from removing the file it was using. Since it was still trying to clear the contents, I was prompted that Crypomator was preventing shutdown. The hard shutdown left the file in the folder \n\nOn reboot Cryptomator sees a file in the drive prompting it to think the drive is unlocked, when it is actually closed. Meaning users cannot unlock thier data\nPrevious testing was not able to reproduce this error because Cryptomator is properly emptying the drive when the computer is forcefully shutdown, however when a second factor is involved the bug is still present. This is not a user error per se, since the users were operating cryptomator correctly. \nWhy I think this is a bug\nEven though saving the file in the mounted drive is not an issue with Cryptomator I think the way it is handled is a bug.\nFrom a users point of view I would expect Cryptomator to clear any existing contents and reopen the drive. However if this is not possible there should be some useful message to help the user. The only thing I was told was that Cryptomator failed to open. This makes me assume my password is wrong. Even if Cryptomator cannot handle a file already existing in the folder, the exception should be more useful.\nThis is important for users because being locked out of there account is panic inducing, and a major problem. While I expect most users to be somewhat savvy, I think it is plausible that they will never figure out they need to clear their  local folder, and therefore lose all of their data. \nIf my interpretation is correct, it will be fairly common for other applications to save a file in this folder on shutdown. Any application with auto save could create this issue including text editing software. I  expect this to come up fairly regularly and to cause significant issues for the users.\nDuplication\nSave a file in the folder path after the drive is locked. Attempt to reopen the drive with Cryptomator.\n(thanks to all the developers on this great project) . @overheadhunter\nI just left a comment in the closed #668 ticket. My experience is identical to what was posted here, including using KeePass. \nI suggest at a minimum users are told what the problem is , as @infeo suggests. This at least prevents hours of panic and retyping passwords. However, I would expect Cryptomator to clear the folder contents when starting a new session. If that is possible that would fix this issue. . ",
    "michael-wenyon": "Thank you. I asked the developers and GnuCash does not have an option to disable locking. I could store my data as an SQLite3 database, apparently; but there are issues and a learning curve to doing that.. A GnuCash developer says that the lock file does not use flock() per se, but requires ability to create the lock file. Could it be a permission issue?. I will try to find more about the lock file.\nI have one now and the permissions are for me to read/write, my group to read and no access for anyone else. It appears to be a simple text file. It has no content: I don't see any text when I open it in a text editor.\nWhen I added '.txt' to the file name so I could drag it into this Github comment window, Github said it could not add it because it has no content: \"This file is empty. Try again with a file that's not empty\" is the message showing now at the bottom of this comment box..\n. Here is the ls -l list for the file (with the .txt extension I added):\n$ ls -l\ntotal 0\n-rw------- 1 michael michael 0 Apr 24 09:11 'test.gnucash.LCK.txt'\nAnd here is what I get with the 'file' command:\ntest.gnucash.LCK.txt: empty\n. Help from a developer of GnuCash:\n\nthe lockfile itself is being created here https://github.com/Gnucash/gnucash/blob/3.0/libgnucash/backend/xml/gnc-xml-backend.cpp#L637\nA little further down in the code it will also try to create a hard link to this lock file.\nIf your filesystem reports it doesn't support hard links gnucash will just continue. If there's another error, it will warn.\n. This appears to be fixed in Cryptomator v1.4.1\nI can open and save Gnucash files now.\nNow:\nFuse 2.9.9 (Debian buster distribution version)\nGnucash 3.4\n. \n",

In addition to the description above this video illustrates what happens here.\nThe issue first occurs with nautilus 3.29.92 / commit 1dfc0355.\nTechnically it fails as name_max = 0.\n```\nThread 1 \"nautilus\" hit Breakpoint 3, nautilus_new_folder_dialog_controller_name_is_valid (self=0x555556f6c5b0, name=0x555556fa5d70 \"cc\", \n    error_message=0x7fffffffe420) at ../src/nautilus-new-folder-dialog-controller.c:67\n67      else if (nautilus_file_name_widget_controller_is_name_too_long (self, name))\n(gdb) i locals\nis_valid = 1\n(gdb) c\nContinuing.\nThread 1 \"nautilus\" hit Breakpoint 2, nautilus_file_name_widget_controller_is_name_too_long (self=0x555556f6c5b0, name=0x555556fa5d70 \"cc\")\n    at ../src/nautilus-file-name-widget-controller.c:87\n87      max_name_length = nautilus_get_max_child_name_length_for_location (location);\n(gdb) i locals\npriv = 0x555556f6c580\nname_length = 2\nlocation = 0x5555562bfe60\nmax_name_length = 3\n(gdb) c\nContinuing.\nThread 1 \"nautilus\" hit Breakpoint 1, nautilus_get_max_child_name_length_for_location (location=0x5555562bfe60)\n    at ../src/nautilus-file-utilities.c:1367\n1367        return max_child_name_length;\n(gdb) i locals\npath = 0x555557039860 \"/home/user/.Cryptomator/testqbR8qVZvQU1a\"\nname_max = 0\npath_max = 4096\nmax_child_name_length = 0\nfunc = \"nautilus_get_max_child_name_length_for_location\"\n(gdb) bt\n0  0x00005555555df477 in nautilus_get_max_child_name_length_for_location (location=0x5555562bfe60)\nat ../src/nautilus-file-utilities.c:1367\n\n1  0x0000555555677755 in nautilus_file_name_widget_controller_is_name_too_long (self=0x555556f6c5b0, name=0x555556fa5d70 \"cc\")\nat ../src/nautilus-file-name-widget-controller.c:87\n\n2  0x00005555556799fd in nautilus_new_folder_dialog_controller_name_is_valid\n(self=0x555556f6c5b0, name=0x555556fa5d70 \"cc\", error_message=0x7fffffffe420) at ../src/nautilus-new-folder-dialog-controller.c:67\n\n3  0x00005555556777da in nautilus_file_name_widget_controller_name_is_valid\n(self=0x555556f6c5b0, name=0x555556fa5d70 \"cc\", error_message=0x7fffffffe420) at ../src/nautilus-file-name-widget-controller.c:105\n\n4  0x0000555555677b85 in file_name_widget_controller_process_new_name\n(controller=0x555556f6c5b0, duplicated_name=0x7fffffffe490, valid_name=0x7fffffffe494)\nat ../src/nautilus-file-name-widget-controller.c:216\n\n5  0x0000555555677d44 in file_name_widget_controller_on_changed_directory_info_ready\n(directory=0x555556f1d430, files=0x0, user_data=0x555556f6c5b0) at ../src/nautilus-file-name-widget-controller.c:261\n\n6  0x0000555555670b83 in ready_callback_call (directory=0x555556f1d430, callback=0x555556f9a0e0) at ../src/nautilus-directory-async.c:1345\n7  0x0000555555671d2c in call_ready_callbacks_at_idle (callback_data=0x555556f1d430) at ../src/nautilus-directory-async.c:1916\n8  0x00007ffff7ed5271 in g_main_context_dispatch () at /usr/lib/libglib-2.0.so.0\n9  0x00007ffff7ed6f89 in  () at /usr/lib/libglib-2.0.so.0\n10 0x00007ffff7ed6fce in g_main_context_iteration () at /usr/lib/libglib-2.0.so.0\n11 0x00007ffff73407ee in g_application_run () at /usr/lib/libgio-2.0.so.0\n12 0x000055555559c905 in main (argc=1, argv=0x7fffffffe7a8) at ../src/nautilus-main.c:81\n(gdb)\n``\nWhen I understand it correctly, this is some FUSE file system [setting](https://linux.die.net/man/3/pathconf) that can also be tested on the CLI like this:getconf _POSIX_NAME_MAX ~/.Cryptomator/testqbR8qVZvQU1a, which returns0`.\nThe question remains, why name_max has a value of 0. \n.

(e.g. ext4, btrfs, etc)\nwith overlayfs in a docker setting or btrfs it is highly probable that they cause this issue (see this link or that one)\n\nFor my bad, i use btrfs...Sadly bug is still open in java.

I think that updating my jdk from 10.0.1 to 11.0.1 will fix problem, but on 11.0.1 cryptomator just didn't start.. @overheadhunter - I'll try to test it today,in other ways - on this week.

    "bilelmoussaoui": "Hey, I'm that guy from Twitter. \nWill provide a fully working Flatpak today and push it to Flathub (the appcenter for flatpaks for now). This might require some additional modifications here like a correct AppData file (used to show the app information on the appcenter), a working desktop file and some shiny icons to be shipped! \nUpdating the Flatpak packages is easy, you just edit the release tarball & sha256sum on a JSON/YAML file, test the build from a github comment using bot, build checkout the results, merge and voila the users will be getting the latest release no matter which distro they are using! \n. The desktop file is fine. Still, the desktop file, the icons & the appdata has to follow a RDNN (reverse domain name) specification. It's to avoid having two application with the same name shipping the same data in the same place. \nThe appdata file has to be created too, otherwise, the application will look like an alien on every software center out there on Linux.. @infeo Prefect. The .desktop here is not needed https://github.com/infeo/cryptomator-linux/blob/master/resources/flatpack/org.cryptomator.cryptomator.appdata.xml#L64\nYou could also add some screenshots! and OARS tags (they are optional but they allow users or parents to control which apps their kids can use) https://hughsie.github.io/oars/\n. @infeo  The icon name here https://github.com/infeo/cryptomator-linux/blob/master/resources/common/org.cryptomator.cryptomator.desktop#L5 should be updated too.\nFor the icons, you could try to provide more sizes. This will make sure that the icons will look great on every distro/screen :+1: . @infeo It can be removed :+1: \n.  Also, the categories from here https://github.com/infeo/cryptomator-linux/blob/master/resources/flatpack/org.cryptomator.cryptomator.appdata.xml#L49 are not needed. They are extracted automatically from the desktop file. So they can be moved there instead. \nThis file is not a Flatpak specification. It should be installed with whatever Linux packaging system under /usr/share/metainfo/ and the desktop file under /usr/share/applications\nThe same for the icon here https://github.com/infeo/cryptomator-linux/blob/master/resources/flatpack/org.cryptomator.cryptomator.appdata.xml#L10 It should be removed as you're shipping a desktop file too.. Also you might want to add update_contact & developer_name\nFor the https://github.com/infeo/cryptomator-linux/blob/master/resources/flatpack/org.cryptomator.cryptomator.appdata.xml#L65 \nYou can use desktop instead of desktop-id and remove .desktop extension \nOn linux you can validate that file using appstream-util validate myawesomeappdatafile.appdata.xml. @infeo Thanks for your work on this! For the release tags, as it's XML you can just use \n<release version=\"1.3.2\" date=\"2017-11-25\" urgency=\"medium\" />. Yeah definitely. Let me know whatever help you need from me. You can reach me by email or on Twitter . Oh nice! I will take a look at that and help providing a flatpak nightly and a stable one on flathub to boost the application on Linux:). ",

Given that Cryptomator is on Git, I wouldn't have thought that Git wouldn't be compatible.\nHopefully this helps raise awareness of this issue.\nEDIT:  Although moving it out of the vault in order to commit does work, when it is moved back into the vault, Git still says there are changes to be committed.

    "timmaj": "I experience the same issue when using robocopy on a large vault on Windows. I map the vault to a folder; at some point it becomes unavailable, while the folder is still considered a link. It needs to be delected manually in order to make mounting the vault possible again.\nBy the way, I am also using Google File Stream.. One more observation: when restarting the synchronization after failure and re-mount, the problem happens again but when comparing different folders. It seems that all folders already cache by Google File Stream are processed fine; those cached on-the-fly eventually lead to the problem. This could suggest that in Dokany and/or cryptomator some timeout are handled in a problematic way.. And finally, a question: there must be any reliably working software stack of Google Drive (without local replication), file-based encryption and synchronization out there, musn't it? I think I tested in the last two years every bloody tool available for Windows and any imaginable combination seems to have some problems. File Stream, Cryptomator and Dokany (WebDav does not reliably work...) and robocopy finally seemed to be the way to go...until after synchronising a TiB of data, nothing works again because the whole process will just have cryptomator unmount volumed at some point when robocopy checks for differences....

In this section I added <module>uber-jar</module> and saved the file.\n<profiles>\n        <profile>\n            <id>release</id>\n            <modules>\n                <module>buildkit</module>\n                <module>uber-jar</module>\n            </modules>\n        </profile>\n        <profile>\n            <id>coverage</id>\n            <build>\n                <plugins>\n                    <plugin>\n                        <groupId>org.jacoco</groupId>\n                        <artifactId>jacoco-maven-plugin</artifactId>\n                    </plugin>\n                </plugins>\n            </build>\n        </profile>\n    </profiles>\n3) From the 1.4.5 source files I copied the uber-jar subdirectory from main\\uber-jar into the 1.4.6 sources files. This uber-jar directory belongs under the main directory like it is in the 1.4.5 source files.\n4)  In the new 1.4.6 main\\uber-jar subdirectory I edited the pom.xml and updated the version section and changed 1.4.5 to 1.4.6 like this: <version>1.4.6</version> and saved the file.\n<parent>\n        <groupId>org.cryptomator</groupId>\n        <artifactId>main</artifactId>\n        <version>1.4.6</version>\n    </parent>\n    <artifactId>uber-jar</artifactId>\n    <name>Single \u00fcber jar with all dependencies</name>\n5) Now you can do the build:\nRun Maven\ncd cryptomator-1.4.6\\main\nmvn clean install -Prelease\n6) After the build is done you should find the Cryptomator-1.4.6.jar file in your cryptomator-1.4.6\\main\\uber-jar\\target directory.\n7) On my Windows 10 x64 machine I see that the Cryptomator-1.4.6 fat jar file is only about 23M in size.\n8) I was able to run this jar file using:\nC:\\Java\\jdk-11.0.2\\bin\\javaw.exe -Dcryptomator.settingsPath=~/AppData/Roaming/Cryptomator/settings.json -jar C:\\Cryptomator\\Cryptomator-1.4.6.jar\nWhile I haven't done any extensive testing with this new Cryptomator 1.4.6 fat jar file, on Windows 10 x64 it starts up and I was able to unlock my encrypted files.\nGiven this I'd ask @tobihagemann and @overheadhunter to consider doing this type of build.\nI wonder what type of problems if any exist on Mac or Linux?\nThanks. ",
    "arunsathiya": "Thank you, @tobihagemann! I don't see any specific errors on the log, but the 1.4.5 version helped. I will be looking at 1.4.6 version again, and I will drop my log here as soon as possible.. ",
