    "abobader": "I have .net error for latest server build:\nhttp://paste2.org/p/3121208\n. No, I was at dashboard adding more VF/Collection at that time.\n. I will confirm this today, will add some folder to the media collection and test\n. heh, sound like it Ebr :)\n. It just happens today when I update coverart to build 3.9.3.3 and click restart server from dashboard\nAll sort of problem, that the server give this error:\n\n\nIn the system tray I see with these error 2 server icons, and of course dashboard will not work, so after 2 try, the server icon gone from the system tray, but it running in the task manager, so I kill it.\nHere the complete log for all that:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/8pvtylcefe2wfgl/logs99.rar\nHere the even net error:\nhttp://paste2.org/p/3141523\n. It fixed in 3.0.4820.28638\n. Good day Ebr,\nSo that will be with upcoming server build?\nMy best\n. Many thanks Ebr!\nThat the problem, I will try to install it via the setup and hope it completed the download to test this.\n. Good day Ebr,\nUninstalling MBT do not work from the start menu or from the folder as you see, it bring the server and actully for mbt it do not uninstall it.\n\nMy best\n. Did not install the new build yet (need to finish the download first - hoping it will happens tho) :)\n. Confirm it there :)\n\n. I test it and it working here, it remove the server.\n. Good day,\nIt not working at all, it only remove 2 things:\n1 - System folder.\n2 - Short cut in the start menu (mb3 group).\nAs I test it to remove everything (All 2 option when starting the uninstall), after it done, still left over for everything:\n\nAlso notice that give me error before the end of it as this:\n\n\nMy best\n. None of the 2\n. I did not see this happens before and also not now.\n. hmm, that mean i need to re-start the PC, I can later tho since i am now in the middle of some scanning issue.\n. Yes, did not have time to upload Tikuf one yet, but I will today, that case it?\n. I need to test this overnight tho, I will report back about it tomorrow.\n. Ok, running it with admin right fix the issue.\n. That goes for MBT as well, it need admin right to finish the installation.\n. Did not work for MBT, it give me this error:\n\n. @ebr11 I did step 1 and saw this:\n\nI will kill that processor and do step 2 and 3\n. @ebr11 Step 1 actually remove the server from Programs and features, so step 2 seem not need it.\n. Regarding:\n\"I think this should probably be a new bug related to server shutdown. We need to be sure we kill off all our spawned processes when we shut down.\" I recall reporting that in some old pasts build of the server to Luke, and it been fixed at some point in the past.\nI complete step 3, but got error when install done, then the server crashed, here the log:\nhttp://paste2.org/p/3121677\n. Not fix yet @ebr11  but I need to test latest server build (still trying to download it)\n. Is they are new server build update I can try to test this?\n. Good day,\nI see not error, but it just sit there doing nothing, what i should do next?\n\n\nMy best\n. Can I go a head and start the server, or cancel that and do another setup?\n. I just cancel that windows and run the server without problem, so what left of is that \"Extracting package\" do not close itself.\nSo no more error this time, and I can confirm it fix, only the issue I reported.\n. That correct Ebr, in the Pismo not installed in the PC, then it will not hang, I just test it.\n. I confirm now, with pismo already installed, it will not hang, and it will complete everything and run the server. So this indeed completed, well done all\n. Do you want me to test as run the file at:\nC:\\ProgramData\\MediaBrowser-Server\\System\\MediaBrowser.Uninstaller.exe\nSince I have no link at the start menu for it.\n. Confirm working:\n\n. Ok, closing it now\n. I will test that when you upload the new build of CA Ebr.\n. I remove coverart, re install 3.9.3.4 and still say it registered, how i can remove the register key to test this?\n. Confirm the issue is working, well done.\n. I trying to install from the download at the moment, the reason for this, I want to test as everyone else, I notice when I reported some issue regarding dashboard you told me \"that because I am using the dropbox install ver\".\nI am \"now\" not a user, a tester, what the point then if I can not test some issue as it should be?\n. Resume not working here, it stop with the error I been reporting for some time and restart from 0 point\n. Luke, what the things I can not test if I use the dropbox download ver for Server and MBT, because I get tired now from trying to download from the setup.\n. Thanks Luke, let me install it then.\n. I wish thing easier as the dropbox, now I am running the server.\n. Confirm it working :)\n. Luke - I will test it now\n. I confirm it install the pismo alright, I will wait for the media scan to finish to confirm the other issue.\n. Ebr, it hang after the admin privileges window confirm matters, let me wait for the media scan to confirm the iso issue for pismo then I will test this.\n. Confirm it working now Ebr, well done.\n. I will test this, only need it here to url the server dashboard?\n. Working :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n. Yes, I have to delete it, then re upload it again.\n. It work now, as I test it with new profile, but this as before tho, when you first install the server, you will face this as I recall it.\n. I just try it now with new install and it happens again, I even go to another menu and come back to it, same issue, then i delete it and added it, then it work, here the server log:\nhttp://paste2.org/p/3142510\n. Confirm it fix to me in server build: 3.0.4821.28671\n. Sure Luke, here the image:\n\n. Maybe this one:\nhttp://paste2.org/p/3132454\n. It fix now Luke, well done.\n. I will test that as well tonight, Scott, any new build for win8 app? :)\n. Confirm it fixed, only some issue in general, that I notice in last build and this one as well, that the busy circle do not go away till you move to another menu:\n\nDo I do a bug report for that or it here enough?\n. dup of what?\n. ah, lovely, this same post as no 43, can you delete this one, since it not dup issue as a report bug, it simply this site post it twice\n. I can not either with latest build of the server, in the past when that happens, I simply played a titles, then stop it and went to settings at the dashboard, then saw what in the images.\nCan we consider this a close ticket since I can not produce the error again.\n. THis bug report will not come in the list, I see it only when I did search, so indeed it a mod issue here.\n. ah, sorry guys, I found out some active filter there, when i close the filter, I can see it, this site is indeed have a bug.\n. I can not start the server now, that windows error crashed and installer thing on even for .net as I post it before.\n. @ebr11  nope, same steps as i report it, server update by itself, I just click restart server from dashboard and that all.\n. Also I use dropbox ver build to install latest build, I thought it do not auto-update by that build tho.\n. heh, lovely :) wonder how can i break that down.\n. I need new server build to test this.\n. Ok, I test this from the dashboard or from the setup? I just to be sure the correct way to test this as it need it.\n. Server update then click restart crashed the server:\n\n\nHere the server log:\nhttp://paste2.org/p/3151778\nHere the even net log:\nhttp://paste2.org/p/3151780\n. too old? how come buddy, I just update this morning, what going here, I am totally confus\n. lovely, I just see new error when try the setup:\n\n. Thanks Ebr for explaining this, I am updating now, and then will wait for new update to test and update this ticket.\n. with setup update I see admin prompt for pismo to update something. I will confirm this as well from the dashboard when update come out.\n. Fully understand the issue Ebr, I just report what I do.\n. I am now waiting for new build to test this issue on the dashboard, do you want me to test the setup? (close the server or uninstall then run setup.exe)\n. Confirm the fix, did not see any admin prompt when the update done, well done.\n. But for mbt is another issue, since I run the setup (just in case to check update, it it stuck on this after the admin prompt for pismo iso modify something:\n\n\n. 1 - Save metadata within media folders.\nAlso find it in:\n2 - metadata image\nForgot the other, when I come cross them I will update this\n. Confirm it fix with the issue I have before, well done.\n. Can i flag this as close?\n. So we do \"manual\" shut down for these processors at the task manage before the uninstall?\n. So how we can help in this?\n. it always bdinfo folder, I will do some test tonight about this, I can use some util for this to see what hold it (I hope to remember what util I used for this).\n. How about like display something anywhere to indicated the server restarting as example.\n. Here the last lines of the log when server about to restart:\nhttp://paste2.org/p/3142547\nor you want the log when it restart if that the case, then please look to bug number 37 last comment as I upload the log there.\n. Same issue with server build 3.0.4820.28638\nHere the server log:\nhttp://paste2.org/p/3143132\nHere the even net log:\nhttp://paste2.org/p/3143136\n. The server actually crashed as I see no trace for it in the task manager.\n. Ok, the server will not start, do we wait for another build?\n. I am not using the dropbox build at this, it normal setup download, and the update for latest one come from the dashboard update, I told you that Luke in mb3 site :)\n. I tried that Ebr still, it give me error 2 of them, let me get screen for it\n. Ok after I kill it from the task manager, it start now without problem, but I see this build to update: 3.0.4820.28638\nDo I update or not?\n. Thanks Ebr, I will shutdown the server and run the setup.\n. Ok, restarting the server after installing plugin seem a lots better now regarding speed, only down side to it, it do not update the dashboard, same page there as you think you did not restart the server.\n. That correct @ebr11 with latest server build.\n. The uninstaller did it, for the icon in the main menu for mb3, so I delete mbt and then delete the group menu. But no matters what you re install the server, it will not add anything in start menu\n. That correct.\n. None for both.\n. That correct.\n. Opps, just saw it now when I did last update by the steup, sorry buddy I forgot to look to it now, it there now.\n. It just happens with this build, case solve going to close this if you agree Ebr.\n. Same issue as:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser/issues/51\n. You need to run the setup and update the server.\n. Make sure at the task manager that the mb3 server not running, I faced that before.\n. I will flag this as a bug till Luke and Ebr see if that a duplicate of no 51 or not\n. Then I will go and close it since it same bug number as https://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser/issues/51\n. Our problem to fully report any issue for local metadata for mb3, that we do not have finished mbt as client to display and test, i been testing mb3 metadata for movies and tv series (save locally) enable for some times now.\n. hmm, it sound right since now the link from my ISP to mb3 site is fast, I will test this with another plugin when it come out, I will close this and keep an eye on this issue, well done Luke.\n. Log as well same in ticket: https://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser/issues/64\n. Also happens if you shutdown the server and restart or just restart.\n. Confirm it fixed as Mark said.\n. It could failed or maybe not, Luke, but the point here rise again, as ticket number 61, click on \"cancel\" do nothing then.\n. I can not test it now, the link is too fast to even try to stop it, always install it in a seconds\n. Good day Luke,\nCan you put dummy (false) long file as plugin to test canceling the issue as a test if that not a problem tho.\nMy best\n. I am not facing this problem, after the install, mbt run fine, close it, re start it again without any issue.\n. I just test it again, I close and open MBT like 5 times after the new install, no problem at all.\n. Good day,\nFor me, it no longer an issue any more, server start within like 20-30 seconds or so.\nMy best\n. That btw, a cold start.\n. With latest build, cold start is about 12 seconds now, well done Luke!\n. Good day Tikuf,\nMy mistake, it is a internal subtitle as I just look to the movie folder:\n\nHere the json file for that movie:\nhttp://paste2.org/btaG12Xe\nMy best\n. Yes, I been reporting that for some days now:\nhttp://mb3dev.ebrsoft.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=332&start=650\nhttp://mb3dev.ebrsoft.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=332&start=680\nAnd it not to that page only, some times it comes to others menus as well.\n. I like that, well done!\n. All fixed now.\n. ",
    "LukePulverenti": "did you by any chance navigate away from or close the dashboard while they were open?\n. is there still a problem here?\n. Closing because nobody else has reported it. Abo, let me know if it pops up.\n. That is this issue #12 \nThe third party web socket for windows 7 also has the same problem. If that's all that's left on this ticket please close it. Thanks.\n. can someone with metabrowser do a test and see how the realtime watcher feature handles ripping from discs? metabrowser has zero delay for picking up file system changes. Either he's not supporting media ripping, or he's figured it out in which case we may want to consult him. I know metabrowser has a watch folder that you can put new content in, and it will move it to your media folders, and this is not watched realtime. So maybe that's his strategy.\n. Let's just make a decision so that we can close this and not leave it open forever? Do we need to do anything?\n. This is a month old. Can someone try it out and see if we still have an issue? Thanks.\n. @RedshirtMB please validate.\n. i actually thought you meant a trailer, not the vf. in any event i just tested and it worked for me. did you make sure to wait at least 10 seconds before testing? we have a delay with picking up changes.\ntry the test again. wait 10-15 seconds, then test in the library explorer.\n. i see the problem. it's working in the physical based view on the lib explorer, but not for any of the users. looking in to it.\n. This depends on #54\n. no, sounds great. thanks!\n. As much as I hate closing this, it is due to port exhaustion:\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa560610%28BTS.20%29.aspx\nThere is not a lot we can do other than keep our restarts to a minimum.\n. Closing this because #91 will pretty much cover it.\n. I really despise hidden settings that will require documentation in order to be able to change them.\nI'm going to expirement with making this a one-time interpreted property. Meaning, interpreted only on first access. This will allow the settings to be changed in the file and work right away without requiring the user to blow away their library.\n. I was unable to reproduce this. Can someone try this out? If it happens please post your browser vendor and version. Thanks.\n. BaseApplicationHost.ConfigureAutoRunAtStartup is empty\n. Ah, I had code to run it when configuration gets updated. I forgot to put that back in. It's in now. It also runs at startup in case the value is modified manually. Configuration is available at that point.\n. are you still using zero-byte dummy files?\n. yes. i'm going to move this to validation. you can test by replacing the dummy files, or just taking them out of the library for now. thanks.\n. any issue still?\n. in this case not the same. it looks like yours are during playback?\n. Closing because fanta's issue is during playback and nobody else has reported. Abo, I think this was just due tot he zero-byte files anyway.\n. can you elaborate?\n. Now that I know that multiple clients can utilize it, I'll add it to the backlog. Api changes carry a lot of overhead now due to the documentation and number of people consuming it, so that's why i wasn't sure it was worth it.\n. ok, it's back. you need to opt into the OverviewHtml field. It will be empty if there wasn't actually any html in the first place, so you should ask for both Overview and OverviewHtml\n. i've revised this a little so that if you ask for overviewhtml you get something\n. By default it prefers the latest release version. If there isn't one, it prefers the latest beta version. Then if there aren't any of that, it selects the latest dev version. \nBasically, we want to default to release, and let people opt-in to beta or dev.\n. Do you see the same problem on the html detail page?\n. i agree\n. in mbt i will probably rename it to cast. we can show them all and then later add the ability to filter.\n. test within a client\n. Sorry, forgot.\n. Bonus points if you can eliminate the need for two uninstall projects.\n. Abo - do you have access to closing tickets? when you confirm something you can use the Close & Comment button.\n. can it be refined to only run if the key changes, and if there are premium plugins installed?\n. If that can prevent a restart, then yes, that would be great. if we can't accomplish that before release than i think my suggestion would be an ok compromise.\n. Abo, are you not using the drop box updates anymore?\n. I have tested this before and it was working. I think the mb3 admin server does support this. But even when a server supports it, not every download will resume.\n. I think everything except for application auto-update. If i remember anything else i'll let you know.\n. Ebr,\nCan you post a full url to the latest server zip file? I would like to look at the http response headers. Thanks.\n. I would be surprised if the mb3 admin server does not support range requests. This can be done. You'll need to change the download code to use the algorithm here:\nhttp://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vbgeneral/thread/b1c67073-ac98-43b5-a211-aca252965467\nIt's in vb but should be easily converted to c#. Then if downloads are cut off you can implement a retry and resume. \n. I'll put this in http client manager\n. Please file here:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser.Administration/issues\n. Abo - in order to test this, please uninstall pismo, then run the installer. it should install pismo.\nthen test that pismo is actually working - you will need to delete the data and cache folders before starting the server.  then when the media library scan completes, verify you have media info for iso's. \n. This is done. @ebr11 please validate. The setting is on the advanced config page and does not require a server restart.\nThe library manager will react to the change by clearing out all ItemByName caches.\nAlso, ImagesByNameProvider will now return true in NeedsRefresh if the IBN path has changed since the last refresh.\nAlso, I kept the ImagesByName moniker but changed all internal names to ItemsByName.\n. Thanks. Just use the dashboard in the web browser to try and play a movie. let me know how it goes. also if you could test an audio file that would be great too. thanks.\n. is it exactly the same as before?\n. I can't reproduce this. Can you try this again? Is it consistent?\n. can you add screens to this now?\n. is there a log from that time?\n. Abo can you re-test this?\n. Is this the same for both ipad and iphone?\n. Thanks. Nice work.\n.

I think this is the same as #52 \n. He'll need to do that everytime if he's using the dropbox updates, right?\n. abo, i'm closing this, but if that other issue persists, file a ticket for it.\n. It causes some other issues so we have to resolve it. It can cause concurrency issues if the separate instances get refreshed at the same time. It also causes loss of user data, where one instance has the latest user data object and the others don't. So lots of issues.\nI tried to override GetCachedChildren in UserRootFolder to have it drop the instance coming out of the db and pick up the correct one. In theory it seems like that should work and yet it didn't. I didn't go any further after that, but that could be a starting point. I can't really look at this right now because I have other stuff to get done, and I'd like to get back to mbt. \n. Yea there's that approach too.\n.

Please re-up the log file.\n. CBers, can you do this again, and post both server and ui logs from the time of the issue? Thanks.\n. Great!\n. That's an option although there are questions to be answered about that first. Will it be too rigid and not allow different installations on different mbt instances? If we add a plugin catalog browser to mbt, it will mean adding or removing an mbt plugin will affect other mbt installations. Will that be intuitive? And then what will be the process for ui plugin developers? Testing changes will mean build plugin -> restart server -> restart mbt.\n. That's fine although I think we should build it so that installing a ui plugin doesn't require a server restart. Since the server won't be loading the ui assembly in memory, I don't think that should be a problem.\n. I think these kinds of questions are something we'll have to keep answering:\nhttp://mb3dev.ebrsoft.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=351&start=10\nJust throwing this idea out there, but there are other ways to achieve the centralization. User installs MBT, installs plugins on MBT. Then they go install mbt on another machine and we recognize that and say hey would you like the same plugins as your other mbt installation.\nThen we could take this a step further with the remote control api that I'm in the process of building, and that will give us all the centralization that we need. We'll know about mbt installations as well as what plugins each of them has.\nI'm just concerned about over-complicating the server by forcing it to manage something it shouldn't really care about. Think long term sustainability. People are going to inevitably request the ability to have different plugins on different installations, which is reasonable, and that will lead us to further complicate the server by forcing us to provide support for that. All of which can be avoided by having mbt go directly to the package server. \nWe can still have the relationship between server/ui assemblies. UI says hey, I notice trakt was just installed on the server, would you like to install trakt onto this mbt installation.\nJust a hypothetitcal question, but a fair one. Suppose we had multiple ui's, each with their own set of plugins. How would the current system handle that?\n. This doesn't impact the server a whole lot. The impact is mainly to mbt,\nand some minor impact to packages to have a designation value. We should\nget it right, especially now that we have additional help. Adam is helping\nin the ui, and his buddy Ogre is potentially on the way, and I have two\nother contacts who keep saying they want to help. Sooner or later one of\nthem will pan out and then there will be three of us on mbt.\nPlus the mbc announcement is going to take a huge load off of mbt\nso that it doesn't have to have everything on day one.\nOn Thu, Mar 28, 2013 at 1:20 PM, Eric Reed notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nIf we have all of that other integration, then, yeah, I agree. But all of\nthat other integration is going to take a while.\nI don't think there is a perfect answer here in the short term. As, with\nhybrid plug-ins the user would have to install two components in two\ndifferent places. If we have the intelligence you described above, we could\nhelp that out but, again, that's a lot to build.\nIn short, I think that would be a better system but when do we draw a line\nand get something out the door?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser/issues/83#issuecomment-15601782\n.\n\n\nLuke Pulverenti\n. I think this is ok. This is one of these developer error things that you won't want to swallow. Let it crash and force the developer to fix it. Otherwise if you fail silently, you have to dig through log files to find the problem. I know this sounds harsh but you didn't follow the example, which had \"/MyRoute\" and not \"MyRoute\". This would be unintuitive for new developers coming on. Let them see an explicit error so that they can fix it. Alex had this problem back when HttpManager used to swallow exceptions and he had no idea what was going on.\n. Having it fail this way means it will never get to production in the first place.\n. in the interest of a resolution. the routes are stored in attributes, so it's not anything we're initializing and can trap. even if we agreed on the approach on wanted to trap it, i do not have the time to dig through service stack source code to figure it out, and i can't say it will be a priority anytime soon.\n. Note the header, Create Password or Update Password\n. just like any other change password function, you have to authenticate by providing your current password first. The reset password button is also there in case you've forgotten it.\n. Yea not a bad idea.\n. ok, i'll do the comparison, but fyi, when encoding to aac or wma, it's always fixed at 2 channels, because ffmpeg throws an error otherwise. i researched it a while back and the encoders they're using don't support more than 2 ch.\n. The api doesn't know, and it's not going to make any assumptions. If you ask for six it will give you six, unless as Tikuf points out, the item doesn't even have six channels then we may not want to allow upsampling.\n. Mike, thanks! I'll play with it when I have a chance, but yes, you're right. ItemType is something that should be looked at.\nFor a brief overview of providers, they download or extract metadata for items in the library, and they execute in order of priority. Some providers use the internet, like tmdb, others extract info from the file itself, like ffmpeg.\nCan you create a dummy box set just for testing purposes? Just grab a couple sample video clips, make folders for say, Rocky I, Rocky II. Then put them in a Rocky boxset folder, with \"[boxset]\" appearing somewhere in the folder name. That should allow you to play with boxsets.\nThanks for looking at this. I like how your tmbd api has automated unit tests, and i think it would be great if at some point we could have some for our providers.\n. Mike, based on the comments from Ebr, it sounds like some of your changes should be removed? Or am I missing something? In any event, it sounds like your append to repsonse change will be useful. You should probably get a changeset together that has only the things you and Ebr have agreed to, and then get that into a pull request. Nice work.\n. If this eliminates three http requests per movie, then it's a change worth making, so I would say proceed.\n. Also I just did a test, and it turns out they're applying http response caching, and returning 304's when our cached copy is still usable. Based on this I think we should follow that protocol. The fact they apply response caching means we can hit them as often as we want, and they will tell us when our cached data is stale.\n\n. We definitely should eliminate the extra requests. There's no reason not to.\nWhen I brought up the response headers it was in an effort for us to potentially re-think the way we do some of these things. If i can extend our http client with a robust, long-lived cache, and if we get our movie requests down to one, it opens the door for us to refresh in a much more powerful way. \nRight now the providers are unintuitive. Abo is under the impression that the refresh button in the library explorer doesn't do anything. The needs refresh algorithms, in my opinion, are a little too smart because the decision making is trapped in code and not in a place where the user can see it and control it. \nContrast this with Metabrowser which has a \"dumb\" fetcher where if you tell it to process something, it completely refreshes everything. It's true that in order to get automatic refresh you do have to go and setup jobs, but at least the control is right at the user's fingertips.\nI don't see this as a high priority but I'm just saying I think we can do better than what we have. What I'm proposing is not a paradigm shift, it is just a matter of shifting responsibility of where the cache lives, and using standard protocols to determine staleness, rather than internal algorithms.\n. Michael - yes it does, but it uses the .net framework's built-in caching, which in turn uses temporary internet files. So while it does honor the headers, the cache isn't very large and data gets recycled quickly. So one idea is to disable it and use our own which would work off of etag, just like you mentioned and then all the different providers can benefit from it.\nThis is somewhat related:\nhttps://trello.com/card/make-internet-providers-more-responsive-to-configuration-changes/50c03d2ab582e7483d002f1d/133\nRIght now the user can change provider configurations, but having the refresh interval setting means they won't take affect until that expires, giving the impression to the user that the settings have no impact.\n. Anyhow Michael, this is getting off topic, and what I've presented are just ideas for improvement. They may or may not see the light of day. I would still love to see you pursue the request reduction though. You'll have to make sure to test it with boxsets and make sure the saved json works.\n. Closing this. Will re-open if we hear from Mike again.\n. With that error message this could be a tricky one to hunt down, but it's possible it could be happening off of an action that is triggered by a timer.\nPlease try again on the new build i just posted. thanks.\n. can you post your log no matter what happens?

Tikuf,\nAt this point we're able to satisfy, IE10, Chrome, iOS Safari and Firefox. Any playback errors in those browsers will require a server log as well as the corresponding ffmpeg log.\nI am still seeing some issues encoding high bit bluray mkv's to webm. I'll get a log up when i have a chance.\n. @tikuf - can you work with them and get whatever logs are needed and diagnose?\n. @Techywarrior I figured this out. The player is actually starting in a paused state, even though the server is streaming. If you press the video js play/pause button twice and then it will play.\nCan you look into this? I would first start by updating our video js code to the latest, as I think there might have been a buggy release that we got.\n. No. If it's a known video js issue then let's move on because they'll inevitably fix it.\n. Mark, CBers, can you post startup logs as well?\n. ServiceStack's Init is consistently taking a long time in all of these logs, so at some point i will have to dive into that and see what's going on. In the meantime I'm focusing on things we can directly control because there are a few things of ours that are taking too long as well.\n. @RedshirtMB \n@CBers \n@skynet600 \ncan you guys post new logs? Thanks.\n. Unfortunately no. I am putting up a test build with it disabled. If that solves the issue then I'll make swagger conditional based on the developer tools setting.\n. What you're seeing with the Swagger service is a rest service that I wrote to serve the static swagger html. So that's why you still see the swagger message even though the swagger plugin is disabled. So the  problem is elsewhere, something at the end of the ServiceStack initialization that unfortunately does not have any logging messages. I'll dig deeper.\n. what kind of startup times is everyone seeing now?\n. It's not swagger. It's something else in there that doesn't have logging.\nOn Tue, May 14, 2013 at 4:51 PM, skynet600 notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nSwagger took just shy of six mins again tonight...\n2013-05-14 21:43:41.4919, Debug, ServiceController, Registering Reply\nservice 'WeatherService' with request 'GetWeather'\n2013-05-14 21:43:41.4919, Debug, ServiceController, Registering Reply\nservice 'DashboardService' with request 'GetDashboardInfo'\n2013-05-14 21:43:41.4919, Debug, ServiceController, Registering OneWay\nservice 'DashboardService' with request 'GetDashboardConfigurationPage'\n2013-05-14 21:43:41.5019, Debug, ServiceController, Registering Reply\nservice 'DashboardService' with request 'GetDashboardConfigurationPages'\n2013-05-14 21:43:41.5019, Debug, ServiceController, Registering OneWay\nservice 'DashboardService' with request 'GetDashboardResource'\n2013-05-14 21:43:41.5019, Debug, ServiceController, Registering OneWay\nservice 'SwaggerService' with request 'GetSwaggerResource'\n2013-05-14 21:49:31.9714, Debug, ServiceController, Registering Reply\nservice 'SwaggerResourcesService' with request 'Resources'\n2013-05-14 21:49:32.4114, Debug, ServiceController, Registering OneWay\nservice 'SwaggerApiService' with request 'ResourceRequest'\n2013-05-14 21:49:32.4414, Info, App, Loading Http Server\n2013-05-14 21:49:32.4414, Info, HttpServer, Creating HttpListner\n2013-05-14 21:49:32.4414, Info, HttpServer, Adding HttpListener Prefixes\n2013-05-14 21:49:32.4614, Info, HttpServer, Starting HttpListner\n2013-05-14 21:49:32.4614, Info, HttpServer, Creating HttpListner\nobservable stream\n2013-05-14 21:49:32.7614, Info, App, Alchemy Web Socket Server started\n2013-05-14 21:49:34.1214, Info, App, Core startup complete\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser/issues/122#issuecomment-17904204\n.\n\n\nLuke Pulverenti\n. Finally hunted this down.\n. i don't see it changing again.\n. yea, that's a bug\n. Yes, sorry. I just got tired of seeing the issue list so large so I just went on a house cleaning spree.\n. ok, sounds good. this might have a ripple effect and require several other resolvers to get bumped down a level too. we didn't quite achieve one goal i had of making every resolver completely independent of other ones, so there is some tight coupling unfortunately.\n. When we put together our list of assemblies to find types within, plugin assemblies come first. That's why it's currently working even though both your resolver and the core resolver have priorities of First.\nBut the core resolvers should be changed anyway so that they're not relying on this. The assembly order is completely independent and can be changed at anytime.\n. This is very easy. Go to the MediaBrowser.Server.Implementations project -> Library -> Resolvers.\nFind every resolver that overrides the Priority property, and bump each one down a level, e.g., First to Second, Second to Third, etc.\n. It checks it within the actual Fetch method, so no, we're not running ffmpeg against all your files. There's a base class where NeedsRefresh is driven off of the item's last date modified as well as the last refresh result. It's done that way to avoid having the provider try again and again on failed extractions.\n. yup, done\n. How about text in the directory picker indicating a recommendation for unc paths? In general I don't think it's a good practice to have the server auto-magically do things such as this. It requires that we make assumptions and that ultimately leads to control being taken away from the user. If we present the information they can make their own decision. I just googled and plex and xbmc both support mapped drives.\nDo we know what the exact problem mb2 had with them? I'm sure it can be solved. The file system access in mb3 is completely different so it might not even be an issue.\n. I see. We already have text for that indicating that unc paths are preferred. That can possibly be improved, along with an \"are you sure' anytime they setup a local path. I think that's a better option than taking the choice away from the user.\n. That depends on what client they use. I plan to have mbt stream when the file is not available. (It'll have to stream anyway in order to handle the youtube plugin).\n. The only way I can see us converting is if it's a controllable option in the api and we put a checkbox in the directory picker so that they can decide at the time they setup their library. Even if it's checked by default, that's fine, as long as the information is there and it can be controlled. I just don't want it happening in the background without providing any ability to control it.\n. I just think that's important information to make available. There's no reason not to be explicit about it. Actually it can have a side effect benefit that if the user hasn't setup their network shares yet, having that there will serve as a reminder to go ahead and do that before continuing.\n. that would require admin right. it's also arguably intrusive, unless we step them through it so they know what's about to happen.\n. I would just stick to the conversion idea if that's what you really want. Forcing lan paths will require those with single box installations to setup network shares. Plus if we're able to grow our user base beyond the mb2 crowd, I think we'll see users who use us for streaming only. There are a lot of people who use plex only for streaming and then combine it with xbmc in the living room. As much as I'd like to have everyone on every client, I don't mind going after those users too.\n. do  you still intend to convert? there was a ct user today who saw the message but didn't know what a unc path was, meaning converting wouldn't help anyway. i'm going to make it friendlier to indicate the scenario in which it is helpful so that it doesn't look like it's mandatory. But I think people see it now.\n. There has to be a network share setup for that to work, correct? In which\ncase conversion only targets someone who is able to share their media but\nyet unaware of what unc means.\nOn Mon, May 20, 2013 at 10:30 PM, Eric Reed notifications@github.comwrote:\n\nconversion would be for the people who don't even know what a UNC path is\n- they would select the drive but we would change it to UNC.\nHowever, I'm sure this won't be as easy as it sounds so anything we can do\nto educate and have the users make the proper choice up front would be good.\nI also will be looking at static streaming in MBC soon but that will still\nnot be the optimal solution.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser/issues/128#issuecomment-18185673\n.\n\n\nLuke Pulverenti\n. No I don't think we're going to go overboard here. Unc paths will benefit\nall, but it is really only needed for users with folder rips.

If you go back into movies is it faster? \nThose are probably images that failed to load.

Let me know how the movies or tv series views work in the latest. please test by refreshing the page and going straight to those views, not the collection based browsing because they are currently pretty heavy. Thanks.\n. @tikuf any thoghts?\n. @tikuf What's up with this?\n. Not for mobile, but on larger screens, yes, we have room to add that. localhost gets 100 so either way it's unlikely to be greater than that.\n.

The client could see the server via UDP but\nnot actually communicate with it after that.\nI finally figured out what was going on here. Our UDP server returns the\naddress of the last network interface on the machine. My dev box had a\nVM installe on it (it wasn't running but just installed - I had forgotten\nabout it) which had installed it's own virtual network interface. So, while\nthe UDP request worked fine, the address for the server that was returned\nwas for this virtual interface, not the actual one in the machine.\nShould we not be returning the first IP address in the list?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser/issues/135\n.\n\n\nLuke Pulverenti\n. Maybe later, but the idea of this is to allow auto-discovery without any configuration. If you have to configure the server locator then at that point you already know where the server is, so it basically defeats the purpose.\nAnd Sinjen, no, we're bound to a port, not an IP.\n. That is exactly what we are doing. The guidelines for the udp server from the beginning are that clients should use it but not depend on it. Not only is it not guaranteed to return a perfect result, but it also could be unreachable if we were not able to open the port. Then then there is this issue which the udp server also falls victim to:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser/issues/12\nSo long story short, every client should have a way of manually identifying the server.\n. I'm not sure what you mean. The server binds to http://+:8096, where +\nequals all possible addresses. There's no way to ask it what address it;s\non.\nOn Fri, May 17, 2013 at 9:49 AM, Eric Reed notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI do plan to add explicit configuration to MBC but it does seem like it\nwouldn't be hard to make the UDP server much more reliable by simply\nquerying the http server for the address on which requests are being\nreceived.

Thanks.\n. @ebr11 - can you describe this? we might be able to offload it.\n. you don't think the more specific search should come first? for instance, I know searching for the office will return the uk version, and the year is needed to get us.\n. I'm actually right now looking at what Mark2xv started which is getting all the series info at once. I think it's a necessity now that we're seeing so many tvdb timeouts. It will remove all of the episode level http requests, which I think will make this ticket somewhat moot, if it's for performance. better to get the right match considering we currently don't offer a straight-forward way to correct wrong ones.\n. This is not going to happen before release, sorry. Once we open the product up to the entire community, please make a feature request in the CT so that it can be voted like anything else.\n. I do find this aggravating myself. It's just not very important right now.\n. no time for calculations right now but i changed it to blank it out if it equals 0:1. That will at least prevent ui's from displaying the junk value.\n. Yes, it is probably related to that. Anybody who is storing media on a\ndifferent device than mb3 is hosted on will probably want to configure the\nscan library task so that it polls on a schedule to their liking. It\ndefaults to every two hours.\nEbr also found a very good registry fix that improves the real-time\nwatchers. We are unfortunately not able to auto-set it because that causes\nvirus scanners to get mad at us. But he can provide info for you if you\nwant.

I am not seeing this so it seems like a highly subjective issue to me. I don't want to change the chapter times because I'd like playback to honor the time in the file, or dvd/bluray playlist. So it's a question of do we extract at a future time rather than the marked time.\n. Tikuf, unless you say otherwise I'm inclined to close this. @bartonnen a lot of work has gone into chapters, particularly to avoid getting black images which used to happen to about 1/4th of them. I'd rather not change it right now. But if you still feel this is incomplete you can always make a feature request on the CT after release and it can get voted on just like anything else.\n. I changed the config setting to store the value as text rather than the rating int. This isolates the integer logic inside our application. Then I based the dropdown on movie ratings - G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17.\n. I'll revise.\n. Now I think it's what you were looking for. It's exactly as before except it removes the dupes and actually concatenates them as you described. If you got the previous code you'll have to delete user config files or you'll get an xml parsing error.\n. Why not give him info about the registry value that we used to set? That\nseems to help a lot.\nOn Mon, Apr 22, 2013 at 11:47 AM, Eric Reed notifications@github.comwrote:\n\nUnfortunately, I don't think there is a lot we can do here. We fought with\nthis for quite a while during early development and the simple fact is the\ndirectory watchers just don't always work that well with network resources.\nOne thing you can try is adjusting the delay between the time the watcher\nsees a change and it actually causes a refresh. This is currently not\nexposed in the configuration interface but it is configurable internally.\nThe setting is FileWatcherDelay and is in seconds.

If we're going to do that it would be easier to just trigger the scan task. We don't really need a config setting for that.\n. I think it's good the way it is. The number of columns varies depending on screen size. It could be anywhere from 1-5. In any event, there will soon be page size selections, although they will be nice even numbers.\n. @ebr11 Please review.\n. Actually I think this is working for video, but not audio.\n. @tikuf One thing you had me do is stop attempting to extract chapter images for a file as soon as one fails.\nIs it possible that say, chapter 3 could fail and then the rest succeed?\n.

I know the issue with albums so I'll look at that. For artists, I have it disabled for MusicArtist right now because there is some duplication of work going on with the new Artist entity. I can put it back on if someone really wants it but I think the folder-based artist is very limited compared to using id3 tags, so I'm not sure of it's value. The api has methods to get all artists, and it will include artists that appear individually on songs within an album.\n. Ok, I will put it back on.

Folder-based browsing isn't going anywhere, but the ui developers have expressed a preference to tags because of the additional capabilities they provider. So I think that's where you're going to see the client-side efforts focused.\n. This will be fixed in the next build but it is going to impact library scanning performance. Albums on musicbrainz have two id's - release entry id and release group id. Last fm gives us the former, while fanart uses the latter. We have to make a call to musicbrainz to translate the id's, and their api docs are very adamant about limiting to one request per second. Sure enough in my testing, anything more frequent than that and they start rejecting requests.\n. Read what I wrote again. It gives us an id, just not the one we need for\nfanart.\nOn Thu, May 2, 2013 at 5:57 PM, Mark notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nwhen an artist call is made to lastfm, doesn't it return all their albums\nas well with the correct I'd. can't we just store it with the parent then\nlook locally for the id.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser/issues/222#issuecomment-17367474\n.\n\n\nLuke Pulverenti\n.

This has nothing to do with mathching names, and everything to do with the music brainz id, which fanart expects.

This is the search being used \nhttp://www.musicbrainz.org/ws/2/artist/?query=artistaccent:u2\na3cb23fc-acd3-4ce0-8f36-1e5aa6a18432 is listed as group, the other as Person. Both have score 100. So I think the code got it right.\n. i have to put up a new build to remove some test code so you can try this all again shortly. But the build will also examine the MB results to find the first artist of type Group, which will solve this issue.\n. Tikuf,\nBased on the fact that I made the .ass font change, are you saying that if a file is already in the correct charset, that it should work fine now?\nI did some research and have found that there is no completely reliable way to detect charsets of a file.

If I had to guess I would say it's probably getting picked up but then cleared due to forced refreshes. I think the clearing of values is something we should probably never do and just let the providers replace the data.\n. There is nothing to do here. The containers that hold the images are at fixed sizes to keep everything looking uniform. Inside the container, the image AR is preserved, so a 1:1 image on the home page will result in some wasted space but nothing more.\n. No, it's there.

Please post the entire log (for all issues).\n. That doesn't look like the entire log, only the startup sequence.\n. This is fixed in the next build but will require deletion of your library db. All internet providers should now try again on the next scan when there's a failure.\n. when i search for Annette Funicello & The Beach Boys on music brainz, the highest rated group is the beach boys. There isn't even a group record for Annette Funicello, only a person record, so I'm not sure what you're expecting.\n. In the case of Dave, we're able to get a music brainz id from last fm, which allows us to bypass musicbrainz. Searching mbz does yield the correct result, but that never happens because we get it from last fm. This all goes back to their request limit, which if it wasn't so strict would allow us to go directly to mbz for all requests.\n. you'll have to wait for the metadata editing feature where you'll be able to edit the id's manually and then refetch\n. they're actually tags, not genres. i'm going to put them into our tags\nfield instead.\nOn Fri, May 17, 2013 at 10:30 AM, Eric Reed notifications@github.comwrote:\n\nI'm sure that's what it is.

I see one potential problem here. Near the end of the log, the movie db provider saves json within the movie directory, and then the directory watchers are firing in response to that. I verified the path of the json file is getting passed into TemporarilyIgnore, so something is going wrong within DirectoryWatchers. I think what's happening is there's a changed event on the containing directory and we're not ignoring that.\nThat's not say this will fix the halt, but it's worth fixing this and then re-testing.\n. @ginjaninja1 Please test in next build.\n. we have some known issues with the log window. please disable it, then delete your library db and try again. \n. - Ensure episode and season resolver regex's function and return correct values.\n- Update remote season and episode providers to support them\n. We're not going to change the IndexNumber property, but what we can do is add an additional IndexNumberEnd property. This will allow clients to display the two numbers as desired.\n. If you want to do that then you'll have to go into RemoteEpisodeProvider and have it perform an additional http request to get the info for the second episode. Then you can just concatenate them. If the user already has local xml nothing needs to be done because mcm already concats them.\n. No, I wouldn't add a new field, I would just concatenate it into the existing overview. If we extend it to split them it will not be supported for mcm or metabrowser users.\n. You know what. I would say let's do this in two phases. For now, let's just satisfy this issue by recognizing multi-episode file names. we can think about how to handle metadata later.\n. The first phase is just to get the system to recognize the fact that it is a double episode file. That happens within the episode resolver. There's a very complex regex that gets run against the file name. This will have to be updated so that we can extract the range. Then an additional property will have to be added to the Episode entity. Perhaps EpisodeCount indicating the number of episodes in the file, or perhaps a nullable IndexNumberEnd. (IndexNumber is our generic property for episode number).\nStep two is then updating the remote episode provider to get metadata. But hold off on that because I am refactoring the way we get metadata for tv series, seasons and episodes. We're going to be downloading metadata for the entire series all at once so that we don't have to perform individual http requests for each episode. That will be checked in later tonight, hopefully.\n. Nice, that's a good start. Does it handle the series name prefix, e.g.\nDexter s01e01-e02 ?\nOn Mon, May 20, 2013 at 10:28 PM, Luis Almanzar notifications@github.comwrote:\n\nOk, I created the regex for the double episodes, the formats that it\nsupports are:\n01x02x03 blah.avi\nS01x01x03 balh.avi\nS01E02E03 blah.avi\nS01xE01xE02 blah.avi\n01x02x03 blah.avi\nS01x01X03 balh.avi\n01x02 01x03 blah.avi\n01x02 - 01x03 blah.avi\nS01x02.S01x03 blah.avi\nS01x02 - S01x03 blah.avi\nS01E02-E03 blah.avi\nS01xE01xE02 blah.avi\nAm I missing anyone?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser/issues/286#issuecomment-18185633\n.\n\n\nLuke Pulverenti\n. ok, my stuff is in.\n.

Unless you have more to do you can submit a pull request.\n. This is done thanks to Luis. In fact, this also brings support for more episode file naming conventions. I added it to the web client. Now you can request other ui developers to add it. Luis, are you on our dev forum? Do you have anymore pull requests in you?\n. Well no i meant would you like to do anymore. i'll get you on our forum.\n. We have a trello board for future activity, and I'll invite you to that. For now feel free to take issues labeled you take it.\n. Also can you not zip up files unless you really need to. It's cumbersome for us to unzip. Try\nhttp://paste2.org/\n. The xml validates so we should probably figure out a way to handle that.\n. This will have to be updated in BaseItemXmlParser to handle html content:\ncase \"Overview\":\n            case \"Description\":\n                item.Overview = reader.ReadElementContentAsString();\n. Luis - with this change now all overviews are being prefixed with CDATA tags. We need to have that removed.\nI think the original issues was that we had an EM tag that was causing the failure. we don't need to preserve that, fyi.\n. Yea but it means other clients may have to parse it. I would just get it back to being plain text while solving the original issue.\n. Internally, when it's resolved, although it goes back to clearing meta\nvalues which i don't think we should do. i think that could cause it to get\nlost, and it seems overkill to write a provider for this.\nOn Sat, May 18, 2013 at 11:30 AM, Eric Reed notifications@github.comwrote:\n\nShould we do this internally or force people to physically re-name their\nfolders?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser/issues/289\n.\n\n\nLuke Pulverenti\n. But even this approach is heavy, because if we want to make it configurable, a change requires a library rebuild.\n. It just seems to add to the whole black box. If we mis-identify something,\nwe currently don't offer any tools to help re-identify. we generally tell\nthem to rename the folder and that causes a new item anyway. if we could\nremove this, it would make the metadata editing a lot easier to build, and\nthen that could be used as a tool to correct something and re-fetch. if you\nwant the fetchers to be a competitive alternative to standalone programs.\nthen the decision making has to come out of low level code and moved up to\nwhere it is user controlled.\nOn Sat, May 18, 2013 at 1:09 PM, Eric Reed notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nIf we never clear metadata values, how do we ever delete data?

You're right, the edits have to be saved elsewhere but if it weren't for this, at least the work could be broken down into two separate stages. Now it all has to be done together which means it could be a while before we see the feature.\nAs far as removing data, I don't think we need to be smart about that. Metabrowser doesn't do that at all. If it mis-identifies something, generally the first thing I'll do is make sure the file/folder name matches tmdb/tvdb exactly. If that's the case and it's still wrong, I find the tmdb id myself, punch it in, tell it to re-fetch that one item, and it works perfectly.\n. That's definitely a bug if that's still the case. I'm guessing possibly not anymore with the introduction of the file system stamp. I will just say this. I understand these providers better than anyone aside from you, and yet I'm still often confused at all the different conditions and checks. The only way to make the support questions go away about why things aren't getting refreshed is to take the decision making out of the code and push it up to the dashboard, such as the way scheduled tasks are fully controllable. (Imagine if each task decided it's own schedule as well as whether or not it wanted to run each time).\n. Actually the remote season provider is already doing this, so we could just leave it at that..\nif (seasonNumber == 0)\n        {\n            season.Name = \"Specials\";\n        }\n. The internal rename will only work with internet providers, yes. I keep going through many different scenarios, but I think I'm back to my first one, which is doing it at resolve time.\n.

We're not going to do it based on the contents of xml files or media info. we like to be able to identify things before we get to that point.\nso we need to be able to do it based on file names along. i don't like the idea of the reserved folder name - it's not localized nor is it intuitive. it has to be something that can be configured from the dashboard.\n. no, the views are client-specific. the server doesn't care or know about them. it would be more like identifying what the collection is so that clients have more information to do what they want.\n. it's a client built into the server. for most same thing, understood. but the identification process should be generic such that another client could do something completely different if it wanted.\n. To an extent this is quick and dirty. Make sure a parent folder has either [trailers] or [musicvideos] in it.\nI hope to later integrate this into the dashboard.

The image enhancer method to get date last modified should be changed instead to return a cache key so that the cache location can be based on validity. Then you can incorporate all the values you depend on into the key. \n. These go in the cache directory, which means they can be deleted safely at anytime. Images in the data directory are actually assigned to an Item's image paths, which we can determine and recycle when not used anymore.\n. This will be changed to return a cache key:\nLastConfigurationChange(BaseItem item, ImageType imageType)\nYou can incorporate anything you want into the key - config values, item values, ca version # if you want, etc.\n. Are you sure? Let's say a CA image for an item depends on video type, item type and display media type.\nYour cache key might be a hash of those three values plus config date change that you already have. wouldn't that do it? that way if the display media type of an item changes, it's not valid anymore.\n. I think if anything there are more powerful ways of doing it now. I think doing as part of a bulk edit screen is more useful than a setting. We could offer the ability edit that as well as other things on a mass scale. But going back to the mb2 setting, in this type of community many are collectors and have not necessarily seen everything in their collection. So even there i wonder about it's value.\n.

Working as designed. we get series xml once from the tvdb and then use their updates api to keep it up to date.\n. I think with the tvdb it's immediate because if we were to allow checking for updates on every library scan, it would always find at least one series that'e been updated. that's why i limited it to once per day.\n.

It's not really by design. The server continues to send data during the pause. At some point, the browser closes the connection during the pause.

Just because the similarity score isn't high, doesn't mean they're not similar at all.

I'm still unable to reproduce, even without logging in as the other user.\n. i can't imagine an uninstall reinstall will make any difference. sounds coincidental.\n. If you have chapter images extracted, and then delete your library db, the next time you run the task the images will already be there. There was a bug where in this scenario it would never see your cached extraction, and it would not get set at all. This was fixed a couple weeks ago. Perhaps that was the same build that Redshirt used when he uninstalled and re-installed. That's about the only reason I can think of why he would think that it was fixed by re-installing.\n. Are you guys still seeing this?\n. Fixed the MediaType error.\n. Please post this in the Media Browser classic issues area.\n. It's already there. Similar movies has an option to include trailers. This generic param isn't really needed in these contexts because each of the similar api's only return a single item type - movies being the exception that also includes trailers.\n. I can add this if you still want it. Just want to make sure before the work is done.\n. This is a moot point now because trailers are in the channel infrastructure. Not sure they will return to the similar results. Even if they I think users should be able to configure server side, e.g. include channel items in my recommendations.\n. Luis - Fantastic.

We'll just wait for Ebr.\n. no that's the http traffic. i need the web socket. you should just eyeball it. if you don't know what you're looking for, that's fine, just leave it for now.\n. It's fixed for the next build.\n. The trailer plugin is saving them with ratings of \"not yet rated\". I'll update it so that it doesn't do that, but you'll have to manually fix your current trailers. We do not have rating info on se-15 or hk-planned. From now on if we don't have rating info, we'll treat it the same as unrated. But if that causes any adverse effects, it'll have to be removed, and then you'll just have to manually edit those titles when it happens.\n. I can't get this info from a web browser and right now i don't want to have to force the user to create a name.\n. inapplicable because the field is gone. coming back later differently.\n. I think this is a bad idea. The reason why we're seeing people trying to force types is due to the presence of the Type tag in xml. It's name implies some kind of function to it.\nThe collection types are actually helping solve this, and there's several improvements that will be in the next beta that I think will address many of the type resolution issues. I don't think it will be as much of a problem when tomorrow's beta goes out. So please re-evaluate after that.\nBut the main reason it's a bad idea is that it's not solving the problem at it's root. The reason why something gets misidentified is because the library structure guidelines aren't being followed, or a bug. If we give people a way to force a type, then they won't bother to fix the folder.  As a result, other parts of our system aren't going to work, and the true problem will be very difficult to hunt down. Users will show us the symptoms they are seeing and it will take a long time to trace it back to the fact that they forced a non-standard folder structure.\nThis could lead to the worst of all possible scenarios - where we have to start loosening up the server in order to accommodate these forced items that don't follow the library guidelines.\nExample - a movie folder containing a video file that is not a supported extension. User forces it to a movie. It winds up with no media info, all ffmpeg and ffprobe operations will fail and it will not be playable. When the user complains about this, it will be difficult to trace it down to the fact that they forced it to a movie, but when all is said and down, it will just lead back to the original problem that we don't support the extension they want.\nWe've gotten this far without putting lipstick on errors and I don't think this is a good time to start. A better solution is just to trace each issue to it's root. The answer is always invalid structure, which leads to three possible outcomes - user error, bug, or something that just isn't supported (yet?). The more we hunt them down, the more the problems will go away on their own (collection types are going to help).\n. Sorry, I see what you mean. The presence of the video file in the folder should result in a whole new item, with a new Id based on the way GetMbId works. On the scan that should cause a new child to be discovered and the old one dropped.\nSo we probably want to figure out why that's not happening. \nIt's probably because the when the movie folder gets added, the containing folder gets marked for refresh by directory watchers. When the video file gets added inside, only the new folder gets refreshed. We would have to go up two levels, which the directory watchers don't do. So that's something to think about and experiment with. In any case, the next complete scan should correct it, although we obviously don't want to wait that long.\n. Feel free to submit a pull request. Thanks!\n. To answer the other questions. We have our next milestone here:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser/issues?milestone=5&state=open\nIt's pretty light because our focus has shifted towards the upcoming client releases, but we can definitely handle adding this. We can also get you into our dev forum if you drop your email.\n. I can't reproduce this. Are you still able to?\n. The web client displays it all.\n. Yes it can be improved, but that's the info. \nYou can get this out of the MediaStreams field, which lists all the video, audio and subtitle streams within the video.\n. There isn't much to translate. Your app will probably only care about - video resolution, audio/video codec name. Perhaps audio bitrate, and number of audio channels. It's all there. You shouldn't have to fuss with it too much.\nThe one downside right now is we don't currently have a way of determining progressive vs interlaced. It's an open issue I'll get to sooner or later. So I suppose depending on resolution you could display 1080p. The few people out there with interlaced content may complain though.\n. Make a feature request in the CT.\n. Fixed (forgot to reference bug in changeset).\n. This one is all you need, and it can do all of that:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser.ApiClient\nWe also have quite a bit of info here:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser/wiki\n. Are you planning on building anything for public consumption? We can add you to dev forum if you like.\n. The apiclient package is built around the media browser client workflow, so that's why users are involved. I have been meaning to add support for user-less queries, so that is on my to do list. In the meantime it can be mocked by just making one call to get users, and basing all queries off of the first user id it returns.\n. Fixed in latest build.\n. Ebr, what's your version of chrome?

The web client is getting it every 1.5 seconds i think. but the client is only reporting it's position once every five seconds.\n. MBT will report every 1-2 seconds. It just depends on the performance level of the device, connection, battery considerations, etc. So each client decides on their own.\n. Potentially, yea. What does the web client say is the runtime length of i t?\n. There's no validation, it's just that if the runtime is 1 second according to ffprobe, then you can only seek from 0 to 1. The metadata value is a possibility just for dvd rips, but i'm pretty sure the seek will just end up failing so it won't end up helping much.\n. yup, true.\nOn Sun, Aug 18, 2013 at 12:47 PM, Eric Reed notifications@github.comwrote:\n\nThe run time doesn't exist.

Fixed via new DvdLib that now gives us accurate runtime information.\n. It's just to cover the scenario of someone entering an imdb id on the edit page and then getting surprised when we're still not able to retrieve movie information.\n. Exactly. I meant search as in when we don't have a tmdb id. So tmdb id -> imdb id -> name search.\n. I guess a basic one like this is ok.\nBut you can pass multiple id's to the remote play url. The idea was you figure out the list of items you want to play on your own, otherwise it's just going to be a cat and mouse game of adding more and more params to accommodate for what each developer wants to do. So you can just as easily start with an item query to get the list of songs and then pass those id's into the remote play url.\n. There is a play all button. I'm not going to add it to the api because it would require a param change. User Id would have to be passed in so that we can figure out what items in the folders the user is allowed to see. So back to my original reply - the api accepts a list of item id's. you pass in the list of what you want.\n. Am I missing something? Are these just files with a .ds_store extension? If so then I'm not sure how the server could get tripped up by them.\n. psykix - if you don't mind setting your server update level to dev, we'd appreciate you helping us test this before the next release, thanks.

Yea that's what I meant.\nIt has to be virtualized? That prevents it from ever being editable. I've removed almost all virtualization because of that.  Not a deal breaker for this feature I guess, but just so that we know the consequences.\n. Ok, fair enough. The LinkedChild class has a type property - Auto being for shortcut links, manual being for manually added links. In plex's web client you can go to a movie and manually add it to a collection (boxset). So I put the manual type there so that we can eventually add that. Not a big deal, we can figure it out if we ever decide to do that.\n. Yea I guess. I'll put the distinct on the server side.\n. Ok, i think the requirement is satisfied but we may have taken a performance hit. I just ran a profiler and a few clicks around the web client resulted in 10 million calls to GetRecursiveChildren(user). In CollectionFolder, for both LinkedChildren and ActualChildren, do they need to go all the way down or just 1-2 levels? I think ActualChildren is just one level right? I think line 122 can possibly be changed to just RootFolder.Children.\n. Re-opening so I don't forget to update the wiki.\n. Wiki updated.\n. This is a good start - how about we future proof a little. Instead of basing it on id, add a class to the page - adminPage. Then perform a classname check instead of id. Then that will allow us to add more pages easily. Then for extra credit, if you want to add the rest of the pages that are exposed on the sidebar - library, scheduled tasks, etc, then that would be great.\n. And thanks for helping us out. You should get an email soon about the dev forum.\n. The login page decides between the visual and manual login forms depending on configuration. We'll also have to add a button at the bottom to switch to manual so that hidden users can login.\n. Well it comes up as the first search result on the movie db site. We have some word removal going on in the search algorithm. We might want to think about removing all of that and feeding the search string directly into the movie db, and taking the first result we get back.\n. Fyi - if the movie has an existing tmdb id, force refreshing will not clear that out. This is by design. So check that on the edit page. If that's the issue then this ticket is invalid.\n. That's currently by design because if we did that the recursive refresh would take a long time and we currently don't have the ability to display progress on it. So at some point we need to expand on the force options to indicate whether images should be included or n ot.\n. I tested his scenario, so yea, more might be needed.

I was going to look at this for the next server release but there's really no reason for it to be a core feature. I've propositioned it to Radeon. It's just an entry point that monitors a download folder, grabs episodes, renames and moves to the correct season folder. That's a lot easier and safer than renaming episodes that are already in the library, which I imagine will be a very painful process to get it bullet proof.\n. Thanks, that was my mistake.\n. we have play and resume for audio books now.. After you press our play button, you then have to press play on the browser player that comes up.\n. We do have some encoding issues with internet explorer. That's why you get\nthe message about installing the webm plugin, which is unfortunately not an\noption on mobile. But you should still be able to get audio to work using\nthe workflow i described (and some video, but not all).  These are actually\ntwo separate issues. The first issue is that IE doesn't allow autoplay,\nwhich is why the double play press is needed. You appear to have found a\nworkaround for that via settings, which is great. (You might still want to\ntry using defaults to compare though).\nHowever, even once you get through that, you'll run into the issue of IE\nnot accepting our mp4 streams for at least 50% of your videos. Audio should\nbe fine. The desktop workaround is the webm plugin. Since IE is the only\nclient that doesn't like our mp4, and since we have the phone app, I'm not\nsure when we're going to be able to invest the time to solve this (a lot of\ntime has already been poured into it).\nWere you able to follow that? Can you verify what I'm saying is correct by\ntesting audio playback on wp8?\nOn Mon, Sep 2, 2013 at 6:41 PM, starkadius notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nWhen pressing play a message appears saying \"Internet Explorer Playback:\nFor optimal video playback of Internet Explorer desktop edition, please\ninstall google's webm plugin for IE.\" I press okay and then it shows the\nlittle black box above the pause/stop/quality bar and it is already set to\nplay because the playback icon is showing the PAUSE icon.

That's not the intended behavior for disabling genre data. that checkbox is to disable getting data for the genre itself. since there's no source for that, the checkbox should be removed. you need to use the edit page to lock the genre field if that's what you want to do.\n. This will be in the next dev build. The param is Indicator=Watched. Omit this param otherwise.\nI did this with a webdings check mark because text is much faster than using an image, and webdings should be available on other platforms.  It basically looks like the MBT indicator.\nIn normal scenarios there's no real impact to cache size. It is how Grant first suggested. It just replaces the image that would have been there. The only way this can impact the cache is if the user browses their library with Roku, then goes on a rampage marking things watched/unwatched, then goes back to Roku. Even then it's not likely to have a big impact because the indicator is drawn on the final output, after re-size, where the image will already have been shrunk.\nIn other news, I also added a Format param, which accepts bmp, gif, jpg, png. If omitted the behavior is identical to as it is now. You might be able to re-enable cover art and use format=jpg. There is some transparency in the indicator and it looks fine with jpg, although cover art is obviously considerably more complex so I'm not sure how that will pan out.\nI will update the wiki.\n. Here's a sample, first using png output, second using jpg.\n\n\n. I don't quite follow.

You've got old data in there from back when we first started saving xml in mb3. we used to take the tvdb response directly and stuff that into xml. now we take the data from our internal objects. so you've got the whole series node duplicated at the bottom with all the episode metadata.\nThere's nothing i can do about your xml that is currently affected, but i'll fix it so that the next time the files are saved the big series node will not be there anymore.\n. Just to clarify, the reason there's nothing i can do is because we actually have code that looks for the series node because that's how mb2 used to save series xml. Beginning with the next build the next time your xml files get saved  that series node at the bottom will be gone.\n. @SvenVandenbrande  \nI am going to add core live tv interfaces with basic methods you'll have to implement. - for example, GetChannels.\nThe interfaces will largely be emtpy just as a demonstration to show you how our interface-driven architecture works. I'll expect you to add more methods to them.\nThen we'll need a next pvr plugin that implements those interfaces. I will add a plugin to our plugins repository:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser.Plugins\nI assume you've already got next pvr installed. Fyi, here is the conversation I started with them about this:\nhttp://forums.gbpvr.com/showthread.php?54259-Media-Browser-Integration\nThey don't have a whole lot of documentation, but plenty of sample code and they seem very helpful in their developer forum.\n. I will add the next pvr plugin stub and then explain.\n. With the latest server, you can test out the live tv endpoints within swagger:\n/LiveTv/Services\n/LiveTv/Channels\nBoth of these will return empty lists. I then added a next pvr plugin here:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser.Plugins\nOnce you have the plugin installed, you'll see the next pvr service and the dummy channels in the result. You'll need to implement GetChannels, as well as create configuration within the plugin for the user to connect to their next pvr installation.\nThe core methods and model objects are just stubs with a single property - Name. This is really to give you an example of how it all works. What you'll need to do is add more properties, methods and model objects to the core which the plugin will then utilize. So they'll both have to be built up at the same time.\n. @SvenVandenbrande \nThe developer of Argus TV just reached out to me about using Argus as a back end. From what I can see, they have excellent documentation as well as a .net SDK:\nhttp://www.argus-tv.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page\nhttp://www.argus-tv.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=25769#p25769\nThat's something to think about because the SDK would take care of a lot of the work for us.\n. Perfect. Those looks like swagger docs, which we also use. They're very handy. You're right, we don't need the wcf sdk. Thanks, we'll look into it.\n. @SvenVandenbrande \n@dot-i \nMoving this to the next work item, #565\n. This was closed as a server ticket because the feature is generally better off being embedded into the client applications.\nIn terms of AirPlay with the apps, we did have AirPlay support with iOS for a little while, mostly for free thanks to the LG Connect SDK. The problem is the Connect SDK is a little heavy and comes with it's own set of issues, so eventually we had to remove it from the iOS app and implement the features directly ourselves. At that point that's when AirPlay got lost in the shuffle.. Yes, definitely open and not against adding it to the server. We only removed it from our issue list because we didn't consider having it server-side to be a priority anymore.. Yea that can be next.

This is already in the forum so we'll wait and watch it there.\n. Good idea, but please keep requests in the forum so that we can gauge interest.\n. Yea only the tmdb, tvdb and boxset ones. Couple examples:\nMy Movie [boxset] [blah blah]\nshould output\nMy Movie [blah blah]\nThen \n[tag1] file 01 [tvdbid=12345].avi\nshould output\n[tag1] file 01.avi\n. No Luis - keep what you did, but go back to the movie db provider and update that name regex method to handle it.\n. Well if possible. If not possible then revert this. But I'm sure you can handle it.\n. The regex is a one time operation that never gets called again once we have the tmdb id. I think it's unintuitive to have parts of the name reserved as unsupported. And inflexible. The bracket identifiers that we support are an advanced trick and not known to very many people. Everyone else is just left guessing why the name doesn't match the filename.\n. For movies, yea. For all other types the information between brackets is lost. If you have a game with [u] in the name there's no way to preserve that identifier, which tells you the language. Or if you name your home videos that way, unsupported. We're attracting a lot of new people who will not know about that and all it's going to do is create guess work.\n. Luis, why don't we do this. Let's just solve the original issues, which says that\n[tag1] file 01 [tag2].avi\nresults in an empty file name because everything between the first [ and last ] is lost.\nCan this be fixed to output \nfile 01\n?\n. Closing - please put requests in the forum so we can gauge demand. In regards to that SO article, I did attempt to go down that path, but it's really hacky. It requires reporting to the operating system that the service has failed and relies on recovery options in order to restart. This not only makes us look bad in the event viewer, but it can be easily broken if the user changes the recovery settings in administrative tools.\nRight now running as a service is not recommended if you're running dev. If you're on beta or release the restarts are every couple weeks which I think is perfectly fine.\n. Do you have anything concrete, because right now my feeling is that if there were a server issue it would affect every client and would have been noticed already.\n. the only thing i can think of is the duration for his item is not correct, leading the server to think it was past the max resume point.\n. Is there anything concrete here?\n. Fantastic, thanks for the contribution. Since we haven't actually pushed the new beta yet, I'm going to wait and merge this afterwards so that it can go into the following public release.\n. This one isn't going to get fixed because we have a 30 second delay when processing file system changes. So if you delete a folder and then click save on the old item, this is going to happen. Best thing to do is just use the metadata manager.\n. Closing - please put the feature request in the forum so that we can gauge demand from all of our users.\nIf there's more than one topic, please create a separate topic for each one.

Yup, it was.\n. we have that, in the views section of the web client. it ignores the file\nsystem.\nOn Mon, Nov 25, 2013 at 11:36 AM, fabiomello notifications@github.comwrote:\n\nwould be great to have an option to ignore the (often unorganized and\nchaotic) filesystem structure and show only organized and scrapped data.\ni.e: tv shows/season folders/show only files correctly recognized by\nthetvdb in a manner similar to the xbmc library.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser/issues/637\n.\n\n\nLuke Pulverenti\n. Wasn't able to merge so just re-implemented.\n. Also reimplement album to movie/series/game associations.\n. @tikuf where in the forum is this?\n. Shaun, I tested this out by pulling down your repo from scratch, and I was unable to build in 2012. I can get you the exact error messages but it's probably best that whoever does this have a 2012 and 2013 installation that they can test both in.\n. That's fine, stay on MBT. Chris too. You guys can do WPF so that makes you a pretty scarce resource. We can have someone else look at 2013 compatibility at some point.\n. If we're going to do this, can you separate it out in to three settings - Images, Backdrops, Screenshots. There are no core providers that download screenshots but the game plugin does.\n. Thanks for the vote of confidence, but we are actively recruiting developers for this. So if you want to see this happen, opening a ticket isn't going to get it done. Head over to samsung and panasonic developer forums and try to promote us and see if you can attract interest. Github is also a great place.\n. How important is this? The menu has a lot of choices as it it.\n. Yea the reason I'm skeptical about this fix is because this RefreshUsersMetatata hits the Users property, which will then lazy load the users out of the db. If this comes back empty it will add one as part of the lazy load operation.  So we probably need to learn about why this is a problem under mono and fix it differently because it will potentially come up again elsewhere.\n. unfortunately it's not going to change anytime soon unless we're able to improve our dvd probing.\n. well that's different. there will never going to be menu support when transcoding.\n. we do our best to autoplay the main movie, but it does not always work and there isn't a lot we can do about it. Look up the industry leading media encoding tools. None of them care about folder rip structures. We depend on them, so until their priorities change all we can do is try to workaround it.\n. Anyway @RedshirtMB  I'm closing this issue because we're now getting the correct vob file list. I'm not forcing a rescan for existing users so it will only be corrected by refreshing from the edit page.\n. just jump in and help test\nhttp://mediabrowser3.com/community/index.php?/topic/947-linux-server/page-10#entry56046\n. http://mediabrowser3.com/community/index.php?/topic/3634-mono-server-linux-os-x/\n. If you're looking to help out that's great. Are you able to do .net work or only client-side? I'm asking because most of the web client tasks I'd like to do soon will also involve server-side .net. There are a couple pure client-side tasks but they will have some degree of difficulty.\n. Cool, thanks!\n. Duplicate of #514 \n. I haven't really looked at it too heavily, but I know I would prefer something event driven over an arbitrary timeout value. IE will throw an error if you try to focus something that is hidden. You can't prove the element will be visible after 300ms, particularly on slower devices.\n. you would just have to resync with the latest source and reimplement.\n. That is not going to be easy because it likely means api changes for apps in the way handle multi-part episodes all throughout the system. That really should be left for me, but you can ignore multi-part handling for now and continue on with the series level checkbox.\n. @Nerdy314159265 What is considered a basic feature is not the same as it would have been five years ago, ten years ago, etc. If more people cared about this, we obviously would have done it sooner, but that hasn't been the case.. However having said that, it has been long enough so this has been added for the next release.\nYou can edit the display order on a per series basis using the metadata editor. . Yes you will name the files by dvd order if you want dvd, and then change the setting for that series in the metadata editor.. No, just haven't had a chance to look at it yet.. Thanks. there's some merge issues here so i'm taking care of it manually.\n. Can you post screenshots of what your tv folder structure looks like? At all levels please. Thanks.\n. No problem. still no images though.\n. I didn't get anything that was requested.\n. You can attach them directly to this post by replying using the github page.\n. No.\n. Everybody else is capable of attaching images to post. For example:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser/issues/614\nI'm happy to help if I can get the information needed to debug.\n. Issues can also be filed here:\nhttp://mediabrowser3.com/community/index.php?/forum/19-general-help/\n. Great thanks.  Can I see a screenshot of your big bang theory series folder (the file system), as well as your season 1 folder, (if you have season folders). Thanks.\n. Re-implemented manually.\n. Ouch. I like SimpleInjector because of it's minimalist approach. Have you seen these performance numbers:\nhttp://www.cnblogs.com/DebugLZQ/archive/2013/06/13/3110551.html\nUnlike mbt where I think most of the work would be done at startup, the Ioc is used constantly on the server.\nIf you really need it, that's fine, we should be able to localize the change to MBT only. I believe there's only 3-4 methods in BaseApplicationHost that use it. We should be able to make those abstract and push SimpleInjector up to the server project.\n. can you test it in ie? the panel open method is asynchronous. IE will throw an error if you try to focus something that isn't visible.\n. Tikuf, I'm going to close this since there are merge conflicts. Can you resubmit with just the max width stuff? thanks.\n. No, it's not that bad. it's about 1/3rd done, just ran out of time to finish it for this release.\n. Yea still in progress, but nearly complete. TimHobbs is going to revive it soon and complete it.\n. Finally done!\n. I'm pretty sure whatever that is is completely unrelated, so I'm guessing no. This is for storing content in multiple resolutions to allow the optimal one to be selected by the device playing the content.\n. Sure.\n. Wow, awesome. Thanks. I will look at it this week.\n. Can you provide a specific example with steps to reproduce? Thanks.\n. Ok, thanks.\n. Merged in manually.\n. mreged manually\n. Partially implemented. You'll need to resubmit the rest.\n. Nice. The only thing is I wouldn't use this, because it's something that can only be used if play begins from the detail page.\nhttps://github.com/timhobbs/MediaBrowser/commit/216f94f81cce97e7f2bb6aca4f384be8939da79f\n. Awesome. Does the Play To version actually work?\n. Ok. I've asked 7Illusions to comment on this. If it's not possible to send these commands to dlna devices then a little more work will be needed.\n. Yea we have it in the api. i'll pull it down a level so that dlna can use it.\n. I have made changes to the core to accommodate this. SessionInfo now has a SupportsFullscreenToggle property, which is going to be false by default.\nTim, update this to the latest code, then update the remote control ui to check the session.SupportsFullscreenToggle property. If false do not show the button.\nThere is another change I have to make to the web client to get it to report that it supports this toggle.  I will do that soon but just fyi, once you support the property you won't see the button at all.\nAlso remove the changes you made to the dlna project.\n. what are you seeing?\n. Ok, thanks. Should be fixed now.\n. Actually don't worry about that.\n. Shaun, the expanded remote control api is actually just about done. i'll have it in apiclient soon and then mbt will just need to be updated to use. \nTim hopefully will handle the new remote control UI for the web client that you'll be able to use for testing.\n. Yup, all that stuff.\n. I don't think this is applicable anymore now that any media type can go in a collection. maybe with playlists though.\n. Cool, looking good. I did revert the icon change just because there would be no way to tell if an external player is selected unless it's a chomecast player. it shouldn't really matter what device the target is, as they're all essentially devices on your network.\nOne minor thing - MediaController has a getLocalPlayer method. If the CC code will need to talk to the local player it should go through that api rather than directly talking to the html5 element.\n. This has been fixed for the last couple releases.\n. Implemented manually.\n. implemented manually.\n. Cool! Sounds interesting. I'll merge it after the current beta goes stable.\n. Judging from the names is that coming from the artists tag in an audio file? We don't split them by comma. We used to but that caused quite an uproar with the id3 standards crowd. Right now it fails but fails in a way that is handled and recovered from. In any event if you want to get involved with the project somehow that would be fantastic.\n. What kind? in MBT I would think if you want to draw something on top of an image you would just use wpf content, no?\n. welll it's really the server's responsibility to extract all of that information. and that's exactly what i plan to do, and eventually have a photo api that is just as robust as what we have for videos.\n. No, not really. The most that will happen is the enhancer interface will be changed to work off a stream rather than an Image object.\n. No longer needed.\n. Done for next release.\n. This is good but there's just so much in here, hitting so many different areas that it's hard to evaluate. For instance, I know I don't really want the progress bar running all the way across. I like the key handing in media controller but not so much the dom manipulation because it wasn't really designed to have any UI. The autoplay checks in media player are gone, presumably they're restored somewhere else but it's hard to tell. Also, we don't need to force code sharing with chromecast and the internal web player because as we shift more responsibility to the receiver page, that's all going to have to be unwound. There are definitely good things here but I just don't want to merge so many different things at once.\n. I'll merge this but I may trim this a little. I'm not sure who is going to remember all of those alpha keys. \n. Merged in the space bar pause manually.\n. Yea this one will have to sit for a bit. The server needs full support  before it can be exposed to clients. so let's see if Luis helps with conversions first.\n. Fyi this will be in the next release. Now that we have all the subtitle conversions we need I just need to create the api for it.\n. Shouldn't the lib64 version already be there? It looks like it gets laid down:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser/blob/master/MediaBrowser.Server.Mono/MediaBrowser.Server.Mono.csproj#L155-L162\nSo I think it's there but just failing to load.\n. The build targets any CPU but for some reason at runtime it is always looking in lib64\n. Yea exactly, you're probably right. We never filled those out.\n. We'll get to this before the next public server release. If you would like to submit a pull request you are more than welcome to. Thanks for the tip.\n. Sorry Tom. As soon as I get the stable server release out I'll go over this.\n. Looking at this now. Couple questions\n- Since the identities on BaseItem are not persisted, how will this work if the user starts up the server and then refreshes a single episode? (Or adds one).\n- Will other kinds of items have to implement these new interfaces?\n. Ok, then I misunderstood. I thought it was attaching to the series so that it could be used later by episode providers.\nWell, I feel like adds a level of complication, but, I did say we'd get more anime friendly. So i'll merge it. If there's a way we can do awway with the base item property, i think that would be great.\n. One more question - what happens if we are refreshing images but not metadata.\nFor example, user kicks off a job to replace all posters (future functionality). The MetadataRefreshOptions will be set to not refresh metadata, so those providers will be skipped.\nAre the image providers able to reconstruct that information if it is not there?\n. Ebr - no, no change. \nTom - Ok. We will have to cross that bridge when we get to it. Personally, I'd prefer not to have it on the item at all and then just pass it along the refresh process.\n. The scenario of only refreshing images will not be common, so that's ok. So really it just comes down to the breaking change for image providers.\n. Awesome, thanks. I had to put the code in a different place to keep the native methods out of the linux and osx builds. it will be in the next release.\n. Thank you!\n. Cool!\n. Yea i was thinking of actually making them a lot smaller and just using text and the icons. I think a lot of people are not going to have images so it's not going to look great seeing defaults all the time. \n. Ah! That actually looks really good. Nice one. I was thinking something along the lines of this, much smaller so that they don't really take up much space\nhttp://thedroidlawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screenshot_2013-05-15-03-57-47.png\nAlthough not necessarily color coded like that, but shaped that way.\n. Yes, thanks, that's a big help. I like that a lot, but I'd still like to go a bit smaller than that.\nAlso - can you remove it form the library browser method and just build something standalone for that one page. just use the icons and don't even have it look for server images. I think the rectangular shape is good but we need a new style for this page. you could play with some solid color coding - but with transparency so it's not too intense.\n. Well i want to make them really small so that they don't occupy a lot of space. we don't really have an image option for that type of size.\n. Ah, merged it thinking it was all submitted, so just need the rest.\n. Awesome. I'm merging in the hover fix manually. The group though will have to be handled a little differently, plus I'm about to roll out some configuration for that page.\n. I thought we had lost you, sorry. Can you respond to Redshirt's question? Thanks.\n. Red - for now on the v1 recevier page you could just send the stop transcoding command from your app. Maybe with the v2 page we find a better way.\n. This is resolved in the v2 receiver that the web client uses. Luis also added it to v1. Red can you test and confirm? From the server/receiver standpoint i think this issue is pretty much closed.\n. Fixed for next android release.\n. try it out now. i had some code i hadn't checked in yet.\n. I think popups will have wait cursors with this. Honestly I think it's ok as it is. The modal background is enough.\n. Perfect, thanks.\n. A list view is coming.\n. This is fixed for the next release. Dlna will honor user preferences regarding languages, and will also support remote control to change tracks on the fly.\n. We have this at both the Series and Episode level. It's already supported in the web client. If you're using a different app and would like to see those filters, please file a ticket in their issue area. Thanks.\n. Under tv -> shows and tv -> episodes.\n. It is the played filter. Same thing as watched, just a universal term for video, games, music, etc.\n. it will be added, yes.\n. Good stuff. Couple things - the regex's with paths were updated a while back to support both / and \\ as path delimiters. Is that still preserved? Also, you might want to look at tv renamer. it's regex list is exposed in its' xml config file. it's pretty robust so we could consider adopting them.\nlastly - just make sure Luis's unit tests still pass (and update them if needed).\n. I don't think we need to make that assumption. there was actually a situation i saw a couple weeks ago where that would have had negative repercussions. i will need to search to find that.\n. Also, what does this mean:\n\"Auto-organise and the missing/unaired provider probably also need a looking at for these.\"\nJust want to know what loose ends we're going to have.\n. No, they shouldn't. The missing/unaired stuff currently assumes they have season/ep numbers and will not do anything if there are entries missing that data. I think that's a good approach for now because otherwise we end up creating duplicates for users who don't have clean metadata.\nwhat do you mean fix sxxexx? what exactly is wrong with it?\n. Yes they should, and we should try to support that if we can. You can argue why do i need a season folder if i've got the season number in the filename. \nHowever - we can file a bug and do it at a later time. It's not something that has to be done now.\nBut this is where i would install tv renamer and look at it's patterns rather than trying to craft them by hand.\n. I believe it is this one..\nhttp://www.tvrename.com/\nafter you install there's a menu option to hand-edit the config xml\n. Yea I agree with you. Our docker script is brand new. Would you like to help out with it?\n. This is fixed now. It uses pre-built binaries.\n. If you try again now does it work?\n. Is there anything to do here?\n. Should be resolved now.\n. This is all managed by the plugin. Please report this here:\nhttp://mediabrowser.tv/community/index.php?/forum/97-live-tv/\nThanks.\n. Well Ip Man/1 is definitely going to be a problem, and I don't think we're going to do much about it because I've never heard of that convention before. (But if it's a common one, please correct me and we'll rethink). But as it stands now, You either need to separate those movies, or use the collection feature to group them.\nAs far as language - yes that could be an issue too. I'm going to expand the language preferences to have second choice, english fallback, etc.\n. Just because they're in separate folders doesn't mean you have to view them separately in media browser. They're three different movies, then you use the web interface to create a collection and group them together. It's pretty easy.\nOr you could keep your IPMan/1, and yes, it will try to lookup \"1\", but then after it does that, goto the movie in the web interface -> edit -> Identify. Then search for Ip Man 1 and fix it manually. So those are two different options that will both work.\n. Fixed for next release\n. please supply a concrete example, with steps to reproduce, and a server log. thanks.\n. and if you refresh the series manually, what happens?\n. Ok. When you report issues, please supply more information. See:\nhttp://mediabrowser.tv/community/index.php?/topic/790-how-to-report-a-problem/\n. well yea the language setting is probably what it is then.\n. can you please retest on the current release, using the refresh function from the editing interface? thanks.\n. Ok thanks, point taken on both of those other things too.\n. Fixed in latest.\n. Sorry, / is the only universally recognized separator. we used to have more and had to remove them because of this.\n. Thanks! I'll take a look at this this weekend. While you're at it, do you mind also looking into the issue of the service reporting a new version on every startup? Are you seeing that? Thanks.\n. can you provide a sample file?\n. If you can post in our community we have a lot of people who can help answer these questions:\nhttp://mediabrowser.tv/community/index.php?/forum/53-server/\nThanks.\n. can you show screenshots of these folders?\n. In metadata -> basics ,is save artwork and metadata into media folders enabled?\nif so then everything appears to look fine so you will probably want to do a manual refresh from the editing interface, then check the server log to see if the nfo save might have failed. Or post the complete log if you can't understand it.\n. Going forward please always supply complete logs. Yes it's working as expected because no internet metadata was found, therefore there was nothing to save. the save button forced it. so we'd to look at why it's not able to get internet metadata. it could be because of the title of the series.\n. Fixed for the next release.\n. Fixed for next release.\n. Hi! Best thing to do is create a fork and make the changes there.\nLook in xonfiguratuon manager and use the configurable cache path as an example.\n. This won't happen. The app runs in 32-bit  mode due to other dependencies. Right now we are not going to take on the workload of producing x64 & x86 versions.\n. if the app is running in 32-bit mode then spawning a 64-bit process will cause it to run within the wow64 compatibility layer, which defeats the purpose. the other platforms are different and have their own considerations.\n. Thanks!\n. Closing, but this would make a great channel plugin.. Thanks!\n. Please post this in the community so that demand for it can be measured. Thanks.\n. Fixed for next release\n. Thank you. This will be corrected. Our security is tightening up in our respects as well.\n. Special characters are no longer allowed in usernames.\n. going forward but the change was made at least six months ago so it's been in place for a while.\n. Can you provide a sample file?\n. i am unable to reproduce the original problem of it stopping or restarting before the song ends.\n. I'm unable to reproduce. can you provide a sample file? thanks.\n. We still need more information such as server and encoding logs.\nhttp://mediabrowser.tv/community/index.php?/topic/790-how-to-report-a-problem/\n. Cool. there isn't much to see yet. This is just to capture. it's not displayed yet. but soon.\n. Yea Shaun as you can see, we're capturing a subset of exif data. Feel free to add more if you think there's any other data we should grab:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser/blob/756d43f352fdf1f39ef2690bb44ff57be78adfbf/MediaBrowser.Providers/Photos/PhotoProvider.cs\nYou'll just have to learn how to get it out from the taglibsharp objects. there's links to examples in that file.\n. Duplicate of #893 \n. i cannot reproduce this, sorry. there is no point in leaving the ticket open without any logical next step. i am testing osx now and if i come across it i will look at it. if you can come up with a repeatable scenario that will be helpful.\n. Yes actually. Media Browser Theater would be a great place to help.\n. do you have a more specific example? \n. It can find the file, it just wasn't able to launch your browser. if you're running from a terminal it and this happens it will print out the url for you to manually visit.\n. Sorry this will break the api. We already pass the info down to clients using ProgramId.\n. Need a specific example. Screenshots, logs. Eyc\n. merged manually.\n. merged manually.\n. It is respecting them. The 1280/720 values that are passed into ffmpeg are upper bounds. they are not fixed resolutions.\n. ffmpeg respects the aspect ratio. if you don't think this is happening, then take that command line, create an encoded file, and then let's look at that. it's a separate issue that has nothing to do with dlna profiles. and framerate is only used as an upper bound. we don't increase it via profiles.\n. I am not sure, but I am closing this because with respect to Dlna profiles there's no issues here. Best thing to do is start a discussion in our community. I'm sure we have users who know the answer to this.\n. That's our full release build script which has a number of dependencies (outlined in the file). If you're trying to build and run locally I would just open up the server solution and build from visual studio.\n. Ah I see. Let me explain the purpose of this script then. This script outputs two zip files - a windows zip and a mono zip for osx and linux. From there I manually upload the windows zip to package repository, and we have a ClickOnce installer that downloads the latest server package. \nFor mono the process is different and I can get into these details too if you like.\nCan you give me more details on the installed you'd like to create? \nFyi, there are some aspects of this script that need to be updated and I will try to do that this week. For example, we no longer need mono on windows to build the mono zip. \n. Ah great, that sounds exciting. Keep me posted on that. I will make some changes to the build script in the next day or so to remove steps that we no longer need and then I think it should be fine for you. Building in release with visual studio is fine too. I wouldn't go to the trouble of an installer since that's not your ultimate goal.\n. I've updated the script and reduced the dependencies and the amount of work it does. Let me know if you need anything in regards to ffmpeg.\n. Looks good, but have it check for -nosplash to be consistent with the others...or, keep it as nosplash, remove the dash from the others and build it internally into ContainsOption.\n. Looks good but you need to resync and re-do the changes.\n. can you re-submit this on the new dev branch? thanks.\n. This is no longer needed given the new username requirements.\n. The server api now supports it. When there's an app or browser ready to take advantage of it, we'll look at that separately. Thanks.\n. All of the information you need regarding the recent dev builds can be found in the alpha area of the community..\nhttp://mediabrowser.tv/community/index.php?/topic/15653-305467/\n. For starters, re-work the certificate so that the path is passed in. yes we'll need two ports, and i don't think we need to worry about disabling http yet. probably too early for that. \nif you can resubmit against the dev branch that would be great.  i'll merge it in as soon as the current beta goes stable.\n. you don't have to worry about that. it will be deprecated over the next couple of releases. \n. I made some changes prior to the stable release to get the https port property added and get the ball rolling on getting the port authorized for all new users via the initial admin prompt. You'll need to update this to use that so that the pull request can be merged in automatically.\nAlso, deprecating the WebSocketPortNumber property is good, but we can't do it yet because it will likely break the iOS app. So that needs to be restored temporarily, just have it point to the http port.\n. need to update again and re-submit (sorry). once you do that i'll try to merge it in this weekend so we can start testing. thanks.\n. also just for consistency can you rename CertificateLocation to CertificatePath in all places? thanks.\n. If you guys think GStreamer would be better, we can look at it. It looks like it will support more operating systems and hardware. It would be a big job to switch from ffmpeg but we could try to do it little by little.\n. This won't happen for the existing web client because it is a great tool to use to preview what the library will look like in other clients. When users asking questions or having problems, we always point them to the web client to see how it looks there first before troubleshooting the client they're using. If we introduce an extra step of a separate install, it will only make that harder.\nWe do hope to have a second web client in the future designed for TV usage, and this will probably what you're suggesting.\n. We are getting this information from ffprobe, which doesn't natively support dvd's and iso's. It will generally be pretty accurate when the dvd has only a single VOB. When it has multiple VOB's, it might have problems. Rather than keeping this ticket open forever, we might as well just acknowledge that this is a won't fix unless dvd's start making a comeback in the market.\n. No longer an issue, at least for collections created in the interface.\n. Actually you only need to do it in the javascript.json file. our translation site will take care of the language specific ones the next time i sync it.\n. not really, and putting it on the interface suggests that all implementations can support it. I see there's a mono.security nuget package, so that would be preferable. but it seems old (dec 2013).\n. this looks easy enough, no? https://blog.lextudio.com/2014/05/how-to-create-certificates-in-c-via-mono-security/\nwe will just need our own build of Mono.Security \n. ok, i slightly reworked the hosting options so you'll have to re-submit. I renamed UseHttps to EnableHttps, and also changed the SystemInfo reporting to not reflect configuration but instead the current state. Also made sure the automatic port mapping respects the setting as well as immediately reporting to Connect after a change.\nWill Mono.Security work on windows running under the .net framework? I'm guessing  yes since it's a nuget package. We already use Mono.NAT in a similar fashion.\nAlso wondering if we should have one public port mapped to either local port depending on settings, or have two public ports. Right now it is a single port. I am thinking of the scenario where an admin wants to require https but allow an exception where needed if for whatever reason https isnt' possiblew.\n. Ah my mistake, i missed that the p/invokes were still there. Ok. I'll add the second port then and this should be almost good to go.\nSo I am guessing the field to specify a cert will only be for those who want to use their own? Are you keeping it as an override?\n. does this require elevation?\n. Done in dev.\n. Thanks! Just so you're aware, I don't intend to always have the BIF generated on the fly. As you can tell, it's much too slow. Ultimately I intend to have options to create it ahead of time during scheduled tasks and/or at the point of media discovery. If we can confirm that this proof of concept results in a usable BIF, then I'll go ahead and put that work on my plate for the near future.\n. Thanks. So you've run a successful test from the Roku?\n. this is resolved for the next release\n. Thanks, although this is showing 757 changed files..\n. Ok, cool. can you close these and resubmit on the dev branch? thanks.\n. Apologies I haven't been able to loom at it. I asked him to take on the review for it so that it could get done sooner rather than later.\n. Yes definitely. I am wondering if 5 or 10 min separation could be a quick fix that will avoid a refactor. Keeping in mind nothing should change visually from the original dressing except for the presence of the shows that are missing\n. We also need the original formatting preserved on the javascript because right now the diff indicates that nearly every single line in the file has changed, so you can't really tell what's what.\n. Also comments in the css - for example, why do borders and paddings need to be changed when the issue is missing data.\n. The current release attempts to resolve this with a quick fix by changing the cell duration to 10 minutes down from 30. I am guessing the issue not solved but rather has just been improved to occur slightly less often. We can always drop it down to 5. But this is the kind of surgical precision change I was hoping for:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser/commit/908a059f4512cdf06d736b9d201beaba6d47f1f3#diff-f2e3b21e04d0097edffc0982d3cd3317\n. It's all done. I've rewritten the rendering. There are no more timeslots now, just a blank canvas with programs on it. So the issue is solved now.\n. I cannot reproduce this. More information will be needed.\n. It's normal. Internet channels may not have this information. Strm files will not have this information. Bluray/Dvd/Iso media info extraction may not have this information. Plain video files should have it but every once in a while there will be files that ffprobe fails to process.\n. yes metadata manager refresh\n. will merge manually into dev. thanks.\n. Not applicable anymore. A reporting overhaul is coming.\n. We've just marked it as available in Vietnam. Give it a few hours and then try again. Thanks.\n. Yes the worker should do what the trigger tells it. What I would do is add a TaskExecutionOptions object as a parameter to the Execute method. For now, give it one property, say MaxRuntimeMs. \nThis property can be set based on trigger options - example, a strict time limit, or via some of the situations Ebr mentioned above.\nThen in ExecuteInternal to enforce the time limit, it's trivial because I'm pretty sure there's a constructor overload for CancellationToken to cancel after a given duraiton.\n. Yes its' a little messy now that I see it. Let me think it over. Options on the task itself might be cleaner.\n. where is that from?\n. Yes as far as I know that's correct. I would post this in our community as our Docker maintainer is active there, as well as many of our Docker users. Thanks.\n. No, that's out. IScheduledTask only needs to worry about execution. Options come from the user, not the developer of the task.\n. yea this one looks good. i'll take a closer look later and merge.\n. Does this work for all samsungs? what year did they start supporting flac?\n. merged manually\n. Thanks. I'm going to keep the same api but switch the base implementation to what you're doing with Idle/Resume.\n. Awesome, thanks. I will test and merge on dev.\n. I don't think this one's a good idea now that there are four tabs in the preferences. if you want to change settings in all four you keep getting bounced back to the home page after each one. I don't think that's good.\n. you don't have to click cancel to get out, you can just navigate. i think you're only thinking that way because you as a developer happens to know that cancel will do a history.back().  i think a save button in the top right would be a bit of an uncommon paradigm, and inconsistent with how the rest of the web interface works. in it's current form i wouldn't say that it's difficult to use so my preference is to leave it as it is. i haven't heard people asking how do they return to the home screen from inside user preferences.\n. Yea that will work\n. Thanks. I've merged this in by hand.\n. fixed with https://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser/commit/e1167c0be9a11ed6832466622a002ae5a9c8e468\n. Merging manually into dev.\n. merged manually.\n. Merged manually but all requests should be properly prefixed by developers. Mono behaves a little differently than .NET and will sometimes throw exceptions over this.\n. Thanks. These are just little mistakes.\n. Awesome. Just sync up this pull with the latest code and then i'll merge it in.\n. Well this was added because when a program in Next Pvr doesn't have an image, it return a 200 status code instead of 404 along with a mime type that is not expected for an image. So I look at this pull request and i say that's why we have mime types in the first place.\n. no longer needed.\n. Fixed for next release.\n. Thanks!\n. can you rework this to use the resolution normalizer? because clients specify their max values and the server determines the output based on that. for example, client might say max resolution of 1080p with a max bitrate of 2mbps. The bitrate would normally be higher but the user lowered it for network reasons. At 2mbps h264, 1080p is too high so the resolution needs to be lowered. The client still indicates 1080p because that's what it supports, but the server adjusts based on the other params.\n. Great. The other situation that needs to be tested to make sure it hasn't been broken is when we don't know the resolution of the source. So try live tv for example.\n. can you try it on some channel content? you'll need to pick one that doesn't report any media info. twitch should work.\n. Since we have to put out another bug fix release, i'm going to manually add the code to detect anamporhic video. so that means you'll have to update from master one more time. then once we finally get into a longer release cycle i'll merge the rest.\n. Based on this I think the anamorphic detection will have to be reverted:\nhttp://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/21445-direct-stream-question\n(Unless you can solve that). The ffmpeg params for resizing anamorphic content can stay though.\n. Handled server-side.\n. Resolved in previous release.\n. Update to the latest version. There is still the issue of the html pages being accessible, but the api is secure and will reject any attempts to modify settings.\n. I think this ticket makes some good points, and if https were mandatory this is how we would have proceeded in the first place. So really the question is how do we approach this given that https is optional. Or if we choose to make https mandatory, how do we do that so that average Joe user doesn't even have to know about it. That's really the key, otherwise it's just going to cause a lot of pain.\n. The storage is changing, as well as the api. We will use bcrypt. For now we will have to leave this behind a hidden config switch while we give clients a sizable grace period to adapt (at least 6 months). Enabling it will result in only being able to login with apps that have been updated. Thanks.. There's nothing random. Either the date is coming from the filestamp, or you have a metadata file that contains the Added value. If you have the latter, then that is always used. If you have any other programs writing nfo files you will want to review.\n. Glad it is sorted :)\n. 3.0.5607.2 resolves a crash related to chapter image extraction. Also see here for info on a debian kernel bug that is also causing a crash:\nhttp://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/19955-emby-crashing-ubuntu-server/?p=207271\n. It looks like there's a user in that thread who has created one. why not post there and team up on it? If you guys can get it tested we can include it in a future server release.\n. Can someone provide an ffmpeg transcoding log? thanks.\n. I've merged these in manually, thanks.\n. I believe this is resolved with mono 4.4.2. Can anyone try it out? thanks.\n. Have you guys seen this announcement about mono 4.6? It has a rewritten TLS layer:\nhttp://tirania.org/blog/archive/2016/Sep-30.html\nIf there's still an issue, we should look at it as a new topic. Thanks.\n. Thanks. Resolved for next release.\n. Resolved in 3.0.5724.2\n. Fixed in latest code.\n. Done, but supported in Chrome only.\n. Hi there. Since the time you filed this issue, we have revamped our packages and this is no longer applicable. Please try again and let us know how it goes. Thanks.\n. Thanks. Please see http://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/790-how-to-report-a-problem/\n. There should be more headers - X-MediaBrowser-Token. Also, The Authorization header is passed from the Emby client, so it looks like that is getting lost through the proxy perhaps?\n. Well to make things easier anyway, the server will start using X-Emby-Authorization with the next release. I will get the info out to app developers as well.\n. Can you give an example? What content type did you select when adding it to the library?\n. Great, thanks for responding.\n. What would you suggest? You could try the docker release. Every other team is doing the same, take a look at Sonarr. We try and keep our repo as a mirror of Xamarin which is the default mono builder. Granted we have fallen a little behind and need to update current version on official mono repos is 4.0.2.5-0xamarin1. That being said, since ours is a mirror it shouldn't be an issue to update to the newest official release. How do you define official? Our sources are direct copies of xamarin and same with the packaging files. The only thing we do is change the name of the tgz source file and the changelog in order expedite the packaging process.\n. We have a brand new CentOS package on the website. Please try that.\n. Yes it's a nice idea. Perhaps later this year.\n. Sorry there's just not enough space to do this.\n. Resolved, thanks.\n. Is this really the only way? this is going to require review in every single app if that is the case.\n. This will be handled differently.\n. Do you mean for the server to handle audio files encoded with opus, or to transcode to opus when delivering to clients?\n. .opus file extension?\n. It will be in the next android release.\n. Hi @ShanePe thanks, I can help you get started. Can you refresh my memory on one thing. Where does Kodi store smart playlist definitions? Is it in the database or an nfo? Thanks.. Hi Shane. I would imagine we would adopt the same kind of approach as XmlTV. What we did there was create a standalone class library and I think that's a good way to go here. So you'd start by creating a library that can read the xsp to an object, as well as save the xsp back to a file. You can define the object inside the library. Once we have the library, then we can look at deciding how Emby Server will make use of it. You'll also want to make sure it has unit tests along with some sample files.\nThe only part that's somewhat of a pain is that it needs to be a PCL targeting Win 8.1/.NET 4.5. That is really the best approach right now for dual compatibility with .NET and .NET Core. \nThat means file system access won't be available, so you'll want to have the library just work with a Stream. The unit test project can then use the full .net 4.5 framework and can pass in a FileStream. Let me know if this helps. Thanks.. What you can do is create a github repository with your own account along with an MIT license, or something similar. Then we can just fork it and our repository will just be a fork of ours. If you don't want to have a public repository then yes you can zip it up and we'll just create it under ours. Thanks !. Perfect, thanks ! How are these handled in the user's file system? Is it a matter of creating a smart playlist in the UI and the xps gets saved to an internal location...or can users create their own and put the xsp's anywhere they like, perhaps with images and fanart just like a video file?. Minimizing dependencies is the key to multi-platform support. So on that note, would you mind removing the PCL third party library and just having the class work with a Stream? If you don't want to, that's fine, I'll do it when we fork this. But since we already have our own file system interfaces we will want to use those to resolve a path into a Stream.\nAlso, question, does Kodi always display smart playlists as a text-based list. What if you wanted a smart playlist to have a poster, does it support customizing that, or is it auto-generated based on the media?. Hi Shane,\nJust for an update, the only holdup here is our ability now to do the UI work needed for this. I'm starting to think about how that will impact or change screens we currently have. Thanks.. That would actually be fantastic. Are you in the Emby community? Can you send me a PM there? Thanks !. Yea, exactly.. Yes we are still planning on this for the future. thanks.. Hi, here's our ProgramInfo object:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/blob/master/MediaBrowser.Controller/LiveTv/ProgramInfo.cs\nSo basically as much of that data as possible. But you don't need to limit based on current emby server requirements. If there's interesting data available that we're currently not using, it could give us food for thought for future enhancements.\n. I wouldn't rule it out. A few people have mentioned it, but overall we probably need to see a little more demand for it before investing the time.\n. Nothing has been done for this.\n. We have interest but there are some prerequisites that are required before it can be looked at. We have to restructure our authentication into a more modular system. That in turn has a prerequisite which is SSL working out of the box for all users without any advanced configuration. We currently don't have that right now. The self-signed certs are a pain and require additional configuration with client apps, and on some platforms that's not even possible. So that's what we need to figure out first.\n. Hi guys, we would very much like to do this. We are currently focused on Live TV and offline syncing, but after those things get to where we want them then we can certainly take a look at this.\nIf someone here would like to take on some projects related to this, then please send me a message in the Emby community and I will give you some development tasks. There are things we can take from @jose-pr 's pull request, but much has changed since then and there are also a few adjustments I would like to make. I am happy to offer direct guidance if there is someone who would like to take on some of the work. Thanks.. If you'd like to participate in testing, please see here: https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/56793-ldap-plugin\nThanks guys.. Great, thanks. I added a screenshot so that you can see the settings that are available in the plugin setup screen.. Try it now, you should be able to find it. It's in the General section. Thanks.. The beta looks to be going well. You can now configure default user permissions for newly imported LDAP users, and the change password function is now supported as well.\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/56793-ldap-plugin/\nEnjoy.. I'm closing this now as we have the basics covered in the beta server and LDAP plugin.\nI'm happy to look at new improvements for this. Please open new topics for the changes you'd like to see, either here or in our user community. Thanks !. That's not an error. web-animations-next-lite.min.js.map is only requested when you open the chrome console. Do you have an actual problem?\n. No not really. The server wil handle that and continue marching on. But we need to know why your movies didn't get images. Best thing to do is add a new movie, then post the complete log from the time you added it. Thanks.\n. Thanks. Resolved for next release.\n. Sorry, this isn't feasible.\n. Where are you saving this setting? I have not been able to reproduce that.\n. Emby Theater has 1 & 2. The regular web client will get those once it has the same video player. 3 isn't going to happen. The menu is dynamic with user generated content, therefor we can't predict how many items there are going to be. 4 is done for the administrative side.\n. Great stuff! The extra IO call is unfortunate, but if that's what's needed then so be it. Does that replace all of our uses of that method?\n. Ok, thanks. If you want the pull request then please close and resubmit on the dev branch. Otherwise I can just close and make the code changes. Thanks.\n. Is this causing a problem? We need support for the file:// protocol so I might not be able to merge this. Thanks.\n. Thanks! I will close and merge manually into the dev branch. By the way, the .cs version isn't really needed. It's just so that I can easily dump out new versions of the built-in profiles in the event of scheme changes. Since your .cs version isn't a complete representation of the xml, it's not really needed.\n. My mistake. I will add the .cs file.\n. Can you provide test cases that don't work with the current code? Thanks.\n. Can you provide a couple test nfo files that fail with the current code? thanks.\n. Thanks. I incorporated a couple things into the dev branch - the imdb regex, and the indexOf change on the closing tag. I also made sure not to fail the provider on xml exceptions since these are not valid xml anyway. I tested with your blade runner sample and it worked perfectly.\n. We already have this on a per-user level. And the video player does some mp4 remapping already with content types for mkv, m4v, and mov. are there other types that will play that way?\n. I will need to review more closely. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think we want to be offloading everything to the GPU as I don't think it's equipped to handle parallel processing. Therefore the system will need to be smart about when to do it and when not to.\n. Ok, my mistake. I see this is just decoding, not encoding.\n. I'm merging this in by hand, just starting with playback and we can always move it to the lower level encoding classes later for sync conversions.\nCan you try to find a platform independent way to detect qsv support? Maybe the best way is to try to do something with ffmpeg and see if it spits out an error?\n. Well I've added it, but I guess zeranoe does not include these decoders with their windows builds? That would be a shame.\nAlso in order to safeguard against users creating problems, we're going to query ffmpeg for decoder support at startup so that we can fallback to default if the user's ffmpeg doesn't have it.\n. I cannot reproduce this. Please let me know if the problem still occurs on the latest release.\n. Server log i suppose. For verification i am simply going to a season detail screen, clicking the checkmark, then refreshing the page, and all episodes now have checkmarks.\n. that doens't matter, please supply the whole thing anyway,. thanks.\n. the request never even made it into the server. you can try checking the debugger inside the browser for errors. you can also try a different browser.\n. does it work if the season is already watched and you mark it unwatched?\n. if every episode is watched, then just refresh the page, the season check mark should be red.\n. ok, do you have episodes directly in your series folder without season subfolders?\n. I see the issue, thank you. It will be resolved for the next release.\n. Can you resubmit on the dev branch? Thanks.\n. Added to latest server.. We've already got the same thing:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/UniversalDetector\nWe use it at the time of playback, not downloading.\n.  This is resolved for the next release of Emby Server, thanks.. Thanks!\n. To get help on this, please see http://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/739-how-to-report-a-problem/\n. Thanks. I need to be able to analyze the changes though. You just have to make sure formatting, tabs, spaces, etc are preserved. We use visual studio at default settings.\n. What advantage does restarting with powershell offer? We had a similar restart working a while ago I think just via command line, but we ran into the problem of the service user account not always having access to starting services.\n. Ok. Also, I don't think we need to do the actual restart with powershell. There are ways to do it without creating that dependency.\n. This is going to be \"fixed\", although not in the way you're looking for. When the system isn't capable of self-updating the application, we're just going to have the label say \"Automatic update level for plugins:\". It is unlikely we will have this for linux and mac in the short term, so this will at least prevent users from reporting it's not working.\n. Can you add links to documentation for those permission strings? thanks.\n. Ok, please add to the code via comments so that others can refer to it in the future.\n. have you also tested on windows?\n. Thanks. Please resubmit this on the dev branch, or I can just make the code change manually.\n. i thought your first implementation was fine. it was just a three line change. we don't need a setting for this.\n. One thing I see just from eyeballing - the delete empty folders option is no longer going to work. Given a processed folder A, it will delete all empty sub-folders under A, but not A itself if is empty.\n. Please add comments in the code about why Path.GetFullPath is necessary, and also please use string.equals(a,b,OrginalIgnoreCase)  like we do elsewhere.\n. If you resolve the pull request conflicts i'll merge this in.\n. Excellent, much simpler!\n. This has gone stable now:\nhttp://emby.media/community/index.php?/blog/1/entry-268-emby-server-3057818-released/\n. Why the param changes on GetEpisodeFileName? is that actually needed?\n. Let me know thoughts on this as possibly a more simplistic alternative, that doesn't require the length param:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/commit/cc5625c55991d3360bbab31fe372d36231f13704#diff-2ccebb4a8189fa1086827bf4a5ba2ae3R442\n. i don't want to dwell on this for too long so just resubmit on dev and change my version and i'll merge in.\n. Closing since this is covered by your pull request.\n. This is a good idea but the data should not touch library items and metadata files. auto-orgnanize should be a self-contained feature and should keep all data to itself.\n. in the auto-organize config file. imagine auto-orgnaize where a plugin and you have no control over the  core server.\n. That's correct, and that's for the better. we don't want users having to jump around to different sections just to get a file organized. that's why the manual override is right there in the auto-organize ui. look at metabrowser for some inspiration.\n. http://themetabrowser.com/\n. i haven't used it in a few years so i don't have one. you can always install and check it out, but it had an equivalent, self-contained feature. you could add your own list of search and replaces to the file names to allow them to match up with series in your library. we don't need the ui for configuring that right now, just the remembering is fine. so if series name X is extracted from the filename, but the user overrides it to match series Y, then just have it remember those before and after names for use later.\n. it's nice. just use generic text in the popup. it's easier on the translators. also, use the paper list style. check the notifications page in the latest code for an example.\n. you just edit server.json for html files, javascript.json for js, and the language versions are generated by our translation site.\n. Can we try to be more primitive and not have the smart match model classes? All of the settings for tv auto-organize should be self contained underneath TvFileOrganizationOptions. You should be able to reuse the NameValuePair class and just have a simple list of them.\n. i don't envision this extending beyond tv so i want to simplify as much as possible. movies are always one off, case by case therefore it will not be as useful. maybe one day we'll organize music but even there it's not really as useful. i also don't see a one to many relationship here. just fill in the search string, then the replace string.\n. I'm ready to merge this one. Can you:\n- sync to latest dev\n- remove the de language text\n- remove the javascript.json text\nThanks.\n. There is an access problem. The server is unable to access the path you're attempting to add. The web interface is then mis-interpreting the access error as login access and bouncing you out. The bounce out has been fixed for the next server release. You can resolve the access error by ensuring the server process has access to that location.\n. Needs localization\n. You can't do this\nError: {0} - {1}\nbecause the translators will have no way of knowing how to handle that. You'll just have to use multiple lines.\n. Then you can't do that. The header should only be 1-3 words anyway\n. Maybe Error Organizing File would be a little friendlier.\n. Maybe we will never support right to left but i have been avoiding text concatenations such as this just to give ourselves flexibility\ne.status + ' - ' + e.statusText + '' + e.getResponseHeader(\"X-Application-Error-Code\")\nAlso what are some examples that come through from X-Application-Error-Code? That wasnt' really meant for user display.\n. Yes please look at the trakt plugin and see what needs to be done there:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby.Plugins/tree/master/Trakt\nIf it's getting marked watched correctly in the core server then it's most likely limited to the plugin.\n. You don't need mono experience. you can test it on windows. if the content is getting marked correctly in the web interface, then the issue lies solely in the plugin.\n. There's been an update to the plugin that has resolved a few issues.\n. Please resubmit on the dev branch. Thanks.\n. is that available separately without movies?\n. can you change it to a dropdown instead of the tabs? also i saw some hardcoded english text somewhere in the javascript.\n. the reason i want the tabs is to keep user decision making strictly in the vertical direction. Also the identify button in the middle is kind of clunky. It's unclear if i need to click it or not. If it's required, then every field that comes after should be unavailable until the identify process is completed. That way there's only one button to click on. If it's not required, then we need to decrease it's level of prominence  and maybe just turn it into a search icon button next to the name field.\nCan you also change the style of popup to what is being used by the normal identify popup? if you do that, then you'll have no problem switching to the newer paper elements, and there will be a search icon button that can be used.\n. You just use plain html disabled attributes. But I think it would be better for the fields not to be visible, problem is the jquery mobile popups don't react well to changing height.\nI know you're just preserving the popup as it was, but I think this feature really needs to switch to the newer methods because i've been in process of deprecating a lot of jquery mobile features like have a nice small icon button or put icons on the text buttons. also the newer style popup puts a back button in the top left which will allow the cancel button to be removed. It's really not difficult. here's an example:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/tree/dev/MediaBrowser.WebDashboard/dashboard-ui/components/itemidentifier\nand here's how it's called\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/blob/dev/MediaBrowser.WebDashboard/dashboard-ui/scripts/librarybrowser.js#L947\nIt will wind up being very large but that's ok. i can handle that later.\n. Right you can't use it i\"m just saying use it as inspiration to create a new one.\n. well no, not leave as paper dialog, look at the source of the identify \"component\" and design this one in the exact same way. if you do that then the sizing point is moot because it has a fixed size and scrolls when needed. you might even prefer instead to look at components/imageuploader because that is the exact same thing and only 190 lines of code. so that will be quicker to copy paste and remove what you don't need.\n. you don't necessarily have to. if you look at imageuploader.showEditor, that is basically the code needed to display the popup. you can then put the popup markup into a template.html file just like it's doing. so you don't actually need to move this into the components folder.\n. well the main important thing is the new popup style. whether it goes into the components folder or some quarantined auto-organize folder doesn't really matter so much. yes migrate to the paper inputs.  you can make the series dropdown width 80% and use paper icon button. \nfyi, the popup will be huge and will have a dark background but that's ok, stick to the pattern. i will adjust after merging it in.\n. well skip paper dropdown because we're not using that anywhere in the application. sorry, should have been more clear about that. i don't like their implementation of that at the moment so we're not using it yet.\n. we're only using a limited subset that i've specifically tested.\n. it is a gradual transition. if you just stick to the patterns currently used you would not had to spend time on any of that stuff. we are not using the label float attribute anywhere. I apologize, I thought this would be largely cut and paste from the identify popup without any research required. If you want to just submit what you have i will take it from here and complete it.\n. Hey,\nThis is great stuff, although can anything like the instant feature be extracted to a separate PR?\n. I'm closing this. If we're going to do it, it will have to be as a plugin.\n. can you submit a request to the developer to add it? thanks.\n. we need to make a revision to this because now the results are showing duplicates. when you add the results to the list, check the ProviderIds property and if there is a single existing provider id that matches, then skipping adding that item to the result list. This should work for Omdb + Tmdb and Omdb + Tvdb because they both have imdb in common.\n. Please try again by rebooting your CC device and reconnecting from the casting app, thanks.\n. How about instead give the function a name to indicate it's a filter to determine what files to organize. then move the length check in there as well. the purpose of the try/catch will then be to handle any possible error when querying the file info and returning false if something is encountered.\n. Thanks. This is certainly very interesting but this upcoming release is all about simplification and removal of multiple ways of accomplishing the same thing. So don't take it personally but I may sit on this for a little while to see if this is something we really want to do. I love the contribution though and if you want to help elsewhere i can certainly give you some ideas.\n. For the next release, we are now binding to all available addresses using 0.0.0.0. Please re-open if there is still an issue. thanks.. Now that we're using github releases, you can just grab the windows zip and run the server portable from wherever you like. \nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/releases\n. The latest beta has a new upnp layer. This may be resolved as a result.\n. Can you try this on the latest beta? thanks !. No, let's not start having the library monitor worry about item types. we've gotten this far with what we have now so we don't really need to go overboard. Just keep it simple. If episodes are coming in rapidly they will have to come in continuously every 30 seconds or less in order to cause a delay in getting the new ones scanned in. That's not going to happen very often, and when it does, a delay of the library scan by a couple extra minutes isn't really a problem.\n. Solved original requirement via 53a4efeff16a0d019ab7bfed63dc9dc5ec4f54bc\n. Thanks. The issue was actually elsewhere.\n. It would have to follow the multi-version naming so that the rar file and the unpacked video are seen as two versions of the same video. See the section on multi-resolution naming:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/Movie%20naming\nOr they can be merged in the UI using the video grouping feature.\n. Yes if you do something on the file system that causes an item to get deleted or have it's Id changed, then use the metadata manager with the old item before the server has noticed the change, then yes this could happen.\n. i'm not aware of anyone doing this as of yet but perhaps you can be the first and then show us how it's done. you can also always just find the logs folder and write some script to manipulate the files.\n. Emby is written mostly in C#. We use NLog for logging. You can probably write some kind of script to interact with the log files that are created. I'm closing this because there doesn't appear to be an actual issue, but discussion can continue.\n. Thanks - there are some changes in dev that make this no longer applicable.\n. I have a solution to handle the specialized case of this kind of sub-folder:\n\\Glee S01E01\nWhen both a season number and episode number are detected in the folder name, we can avoid creating a season based on that.\nHowever, if the season folder name is \"foo\", then we will leave this alone as expected behavior because there is a positive here in that it allows customized season folder names that are not based on a numeric value.. If you use windows this is available on the dev server now for testing. Please try it out and report issues. Thanks.\n. No, best to let the consumer decide how to handle it.\n. If you're on dev or running from source it's only temporary while the database is undergoing some changes.\n. Apart from blocking by tags, library separation and parental controls should now be restored in latest dev. Please let me know if you any issues. Thanks.\n. Yes it can but you can also just use / without the web\n. See here:\nhttp://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/28474-305824-chrome-transcoding/\n. This has gone stable now:\nhttp://emby.media/community/index.php?/blog/1/entry-268-emby-server-3057818-released/\n. We do sometimes stream copy the audio but HE-AAC is currently excluded as direct stremable from Chrome. I have had several users send me sample files with HE-AAC that I am unable to play in Chrome.\n. The problem with the bitrate upscaling is that it's potentially a paradigm shift for the api. Clients are instructed to supply their max supported values without regard to the content, so they might pass along 100mbps as their max bitrate.\n. I will make the LibraryMonitor change manually though, thanks. The probing, yes, probably needs to be done but I know it's going to have a temporary paid period of incorrect detection and it's the harsh reactions that really worry me the most. \n. I'm going to manually merge the scaling change for when a MaxHeight only is supplied. It looks like we have already made the change for MaxWidth over the course of time while this pull request has been open. The only difference is ours has a *2, then / 2, I believe for rounding.\n. Only if the created or modified timestamp of the file changes, or the list of external subtitle files attached to the file changes.\n. Do you have a specific, concrete example?\n. Andy I can't merge this in. We already have the code to probe live tv but i had to comment it out right now because it causes multiple streams to be opened and closed with the tuners which can create tuner conflicts. It will have to wait until i have a chance to buffer the stream in Emby server.\n. In BaseTunerHost - AddMediaInfo\n. No I mean the trouble is a different kind of trouble, as in other open streams get terminated, recordings fail, etc. We need to make sure the entire playback session only opens one single stream.\n. Because ffprobe opens one stream, closes it, then the video player or ffmpeg opens a second one.\n. You're right, but their problem becomes our problem so for now I had to disable it.\n. Sorry, it's possible you were subjected to a bug on the dev branch which is normal. Since the general population will never see this, I'm not going to spend any time writing code to address this. If it's still an issue you'll need to delete your library database file - library.db.\n. You can take a look at it here if you like and update the search method:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby.Plugins/tree/master/GameBrowser/Providers\nIf you're not able to do this you can also re-open a ticket there. I am closing this from here since it is not related to the core server.\n. merge from master\n. Well we have passing unit tests with those kinds of names so it really depends on what you mean by not recognized.\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby.Naming/blob/master/MediaBrowser.Naming.Tests/TV/EpisodeNumberWithoutSeasonTests.cs\nRecognized simply means episode and season number are parsed out of the name. Or maybe they are recognized and there's some problem in some later stage with downloading metadata.\n. Yes you are correct. We have adopted kodi naming standards and after going over the supported formats and the unit tests, I believe this is by design. Without a separator between the episode number and episode title, it is difficult to handle the situation where the episode title is a numeric value or starts with a numeric value. That's why all of the supported conventions either use a separator, or use a prefix on the numbers, for example, S01E01.\n. Hi, welcome. I don't have anything against this but we don't have that option right now because nobody has really cared about it up until now. \nTruthfully with projects like flac js, we probably won't need to transcode flac much longer anyway so that's probably where we're going to put our efforts. I think you'll be very happy with that.\n. Not yet but it's something I'd like to look at.\n. Until we have in-browser flac decoding, we will switch to opus for browsers that support that, which is higher quality than what we're using now.\n. Thanks. As it's working with the native version in Chrome, I will probably just give it time and see if the polyfill gets updated and that takes care of it. If we get to the point of releasing and that doesn't happen, then I'll look into it.\n. Duplicate of #1122 \n. Actually let's go over a specific problem in detail if an interface is being missed. I don't really plan on doing an option unless it's something that's impossible to be handled automatically.\n. Hi @ajbrown do you mean to say that Emby Server is reporting the internal VPN address as the remote address? If yes, then go to Advanced -> Hosting and you can manually override your external address.\n. I've added the ability to enter an ip address to bind to. You can help test it here:\nhttp://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/35687-3113-bind-to-local-ip-address/\nThanks.\n. Hi, there have been major changes to the packages over the last week or so. Please try again. If the issue persists, please re-open with new info. Thanks!\n. What's left with this one? There are 41 files changed, and lots of things that aren't directly related to daily episodes. Thanks.\n. in regards to dlna, what were you seeing before?\n. duplicate of #1302 \nIf this is meant to be separate - the http server binds to IpAny, which means it handles requests to the 8096 port on any address supported by the system.\n. So it's direct stream. Are the subtitles internal or external?\n. Click on it, then disable it.\n. I have fixed the parent path issue at a lower level. what is the effect of returning the parent directory contents when a file is requested? includeHidden I'm just going to default to true so that it doesn't have to be sprinkled everywhere\n. I've defaulted it at the server level so we don't even need that param anymore. If you want to do more work then we can leave this open but I won't merge as is because I don't want to have the api return the parent folder file list if you request children of a file. I think what you're trying to do is keep the list visible when the user clicks on a file. That should happen inside the picker. \nDefaulting the paths based on previous value is a great idea - but we have to handle what happens when it doesn't exist, which I think you've handled at the api level, but that should also be in the picker. We should keep the api design independent of the specific use case.\nThanks\n. we used to have this buut we can't do it because there are several places where we don't want the failure to fall into global error handling. ultimately what needs to happen instead is it has to be implemented on each individual screen with customized error messages for each.\n. No because sometimes we need to look at the response status code and customize the error message. it's not really possible to have one global error message handler because then you end up showing error messages when it's not needed or appropriate.\n. This is good although I will remove the private key check simply because I don't want to pull cryptography into configuration. thanks.\n. Based on previous discussion, can't do this.\n. Thanks!\n. If you check out the releases you can click into one and download assets for that release:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/releases\nSo while we're not going to rework our installer what we can do is document a portable install method that involves grabbing the assets directly from github.\nAs for Linode, I'm sure going forward they are going to have dramatically improved DDOS protection, so we're not really going to make any judgments until this is over.\n. The fix for this is in the dev branch. It's just not being merged forward until other changes are ready to be as well.\n. This is also available in the beta branch now.\n. This is in the stable release now.\n. Thanks. Please make this more surgical by ensuring lines of code not involved in the change do not appear in the change report.\n. Hi, what were the symptoms experienced? Do you mean image paths in nfo files? what operating system is the server running on?\n. Ok, I traced this down to the server treating the two paths as the same library item. Going forward, the server will generate library id's using case-sensitive paths. This change is risky to make for existing servers so it will only apply to brand new installations.\n. Thanks. Please close and re-submit on the dev branch and I'll merge this in.\n. Thanks, I will implement manually. We don't want to change all those translation files because the translation service will just change it back. I will make the change in the master version.\n. This has been resolved for the next server release, thanks.\n. Hi, can you please retry on the latest version of the server? thanks.\n. And the transcoding log?\n. Is there still an issue here on the latest versions?\n. Thanks for the info. We probably won't be able to spend much time on it until it reaches the beta channel, by which time there's a good chance it will no longer be a problem.\n. http://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/30148-blank-screen-on-firefox/?p=295859\n. Thanks. I will close this then since i don't foresee any work for us. Thanks for the info.\n. Thanks. Fixed in dev.\n. This will come but not until we have trusted certs for all users instead of the self-signed cert we have now. \n. @anderbytes yes it is. The OP is asking for http to be blocked or redirected to https.. We are adding this for the next release of Emby Server, thanks.. I'm going to merge this but a few more changes are needed:\n- The ul data-role=listview should be changed to use the paper list instead of the jquery mobile widget.\n- The html page added is pulling in a bunch of jquery mobile dependencies but it doesn't look like they're all being used.\n- Lastly, avoid writing any new code that uses jquery, so this \n  $('.extractedName', popup).html(item.ExtractedName);\nshould be\npopup.querySelector('.extractedName').innerHTML = item.ExtractedName;\n. Please provide a screenshot of the entire folder and it's contents. thanks.\n. Ah yes. we should change these paths to not be localized, although making the change will require users who have customized images to move them to the new locations. therefore, if any change is made, it will probably only apply to fresh new installations.\n. Sorry, I think I mis-understood this. There are no translated genre folders. You can see this by editing a genre\n\nEmby server does not translate genre names from one language to another, but you might be getting translated genres from internet metadata providers. So what is your actual issue, that images in the genre folders aren't being used?\n. This is coming from the mono framework when trying to get the current date. It's beyond our control Try updating your installed mono, or, if you're running the latest, try dropping to something like 4.0.3. Looking at the mono source code it only throws this error due to certain conditions on the system, although i'm not quite sure what those are.\n. Merged manually, thanks.\n. Cool, thanks! How do you explain a channel offset?\n. Here is a sample file:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/j9372zky4x7qukj/test.rar?dl=0\n. Please make these lowercase:\nvar Lyricist\n. Awesome, thanks. Does it still build in 2013?\n. I've had to revert this. It did not build for me out of the box on 2013 and I do not have time to debug it right now. Also, it caused the solution to prompt to run nuget restore but we need that disabled, which means any changes to package files have to be checked into source.\n. it's good but don't write any new code using jquery or jquery deferred. See guest inviter for a replacement example\n. No, not necessary for this pull request. Thanks.\n. I merged this in by hand. Great work here, it looks great. The one thing to fix, if you click new series and then cancel by backing out, it resets the dropdown value. What you should do is use the reject handler to signal that the operation was cancelled, and then the auto-organize page can catch the rejection and react accordingly, or probably not react at all.\n. I would change it because the natural expected behavior when cancelling a dialog is that no changes are made. Thanks.\n. Perfect, thanks!\n. This is getting much more complex now with all of the regular expressions. Can you add some unit tests to the MediaBrowser.Tests project? Just create a few sample files with different variations that way anytime we make a change we can run the unit tests to make sure nothing is affected. thanks.\n. Can you explain\n\"   Make to work with current channel id values\"\n. All set, thank you.\n. The windows build script under tools -> windows_build_script fails.

Similarly, once that is solved, we're going to need to check the linux build scripts as well.\n. Ah ok. You can use the tortoise git shell extension to add them on a one-time basis. if you right click inside the folder -> add, then there's a checkbox to include ignored files\n. I haven't had a chance to look into it yet, but I will soon. I actually just took a quick glance and I do really like the javascript refactorings, but try to avoid changes that aren't directly related to multiple tuner sources, as it's just going to keep increasing the time & complexity factor.\n. But, just to add - I don't want to discourage you from making those other improvements, it would just be ideal to slice them into separate pull requests.\n. merged manually.\n. Yes that's all i'm referring to. if you put the provider id's into the post body then they should just deserialize into the strongly typed dictionary automatically.\n. Just try it.\n. Merged - only thing missed was changing the apiclient method to use the post body rather than query string. i've made that change so you'll just need to test to ensure it's still functioning.\n. Hi, the last fm plugin was built by a community member who has not been around as much lately. We are hoping another community member will take a look at it: \nhttp://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/30066-lastfm-addon-gone\nThanks.\n. Thanks for the request. You can help test this here:\nhttp://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/35687-3113-bind-to-local-ip-address/\n. If you can re-base, i'll merge this. thanks.\n. Hi, thanks for the request. Please post this in the Emby community as it's the best way us to gauge the interest level from other users:\nhttp://emby.media/community/index.php?/forum/53-windowsgeneral/\nThanks!\n. Hi, I think this is completely unrelated. The only thing that setting does is dictate the presence of an http header that gets added to every response\nif (_denyIframeEmbedding())\n            {\n                res.AddHeader(\"X-Frame-Options\", \"SAMEORIGIN\");\n            }\nThat's really all there is to it. I think your issue is elsewhere.\n. If you want to post in the community there's a good chance there will be others with a similar setup and that might lead to some clues:\nhttp://emby.media/community/index.php?/forum/115-server-support/\nThanks.\n. If you could try this that would be great:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/commit/80abd431ec7019f54e63913dc186d63aa245e199\nWith this change, subtitles are delivered externally to the TV and no longer require burn-in transcoding. I have tested this and verified on my 2015 LG test unit, but I don't know about earlier models. Thanks.\n. absolute data should be allowed for season 1 though\n. because users might have their files named that way.\n. Hi, can you give an example? Thanks.\n. Please provide a complete server log of this scenario, thanks.\n. The latest stable mono release according to the website is 4.2. I would strongly suggest avoiding pre-release versions. Right now I don't think there's anything for us to do here.\n. Hi, thanks for the report. i'm going to have to add more logging to trace this down. Are you able to try the beta channel? thanks.\n. Hi, can you please try newer beta revisions? Thanks!\n. The user data keys are dynamic and based on tmdb or imdb id's. If i had to guess, when you first imported, you only had imdb id's attached to your movies, then later through refreshing you acquired tmdb id's and the user data key switched to that, thus unfortunately causing data loss.\n. Hi there. Can you tell us what your tv folder structure looks like? I'd like to see what a series folder looks like as well as some of the episode file names. Thanks!\n. Thanks. Can you also show an example of a later season that is not displaying correctly? Thanks.\n. What does the web interface look like? can you show a screenshot, as well as a screenshot of your actual folders? thanks.\n. Ok then if it happens again, before attempting any workarounds please post in the Kodi section of our community:\n. Thanks.\n. http://emby.media/community/index.php?/forum/99-kodi/\n. Duplicate of #1139 - https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/issues/1139\n. the ItemsService change should have no effect because apps have been instructed to pass all dates as utc. Can you confirm?\n. Yea i understand but that's a breaking api change that effects every app, and also, for other types besides episodes, UTC is preferable. In fact, UTC would be preferable for episodes as well if that's what the provider data gave us. Unfortunately what we need is different behavior strictly for episodes and that's just going to create too many trickle down changes of other places that will need adjustment as a result of this change. Alternatively, this can also be fixed in a more surgical manner at the time the by date episodes are imported into the library.\n. This is going to require changes everywhere. Apps are instructed that all dates passing in and out of the api are utc. when we save to the database, we convert to utc. This would be perfectly fine if all the provider data was utc, which it actually is for live tv but not all others. Sorry, but right now i would rather just handle the specific issue surgically.\n. Because even though we are converting to UTC for storage and transfer, we are making sure to convert back when needed for use with the providers, effectively undoing the conversion. It is only the by date episodes that have a breakdown somewhere that needs to be remedied, and I think it is at the point in which they're imported into the library, but I'll know for sure when I actually dig into it.\nIt is the best of a difficult choice, either a fundamental api change or a quick fix that tackles only the specific issue. The api change would be really difficult due to the generic api that we have. It would force us to tell the app developers, if you're dealing with type X assume UTC, but type Y assume local. that would be really messy. In a perfect world the provider data would be UTC, but it is not so we have to make the best of it.\n. No they are not because you haven't thought about the effect on the other media types where we do have appropriate utc data. In any application with an api it is always preferable to pass all dates across service boundaries as utc, and that is the way we designed the server api. Unfortunately we learned a little bit after the fact about the way the providers handle the dates, but it can still be handled by ensuring that any manipulation on the date objects is undone at the appropriate stages.\nYour comment about just plain wrong is not really looking at the whole picture, because there are other areas where that operation is reversed when the original value needs to be manipulated.\n. We could have that property on the server if we really wanted, but we need another way of expressing it through the api, either just documentation or something else, just to avoid fattening up the output of every single item. But that really should be treated separately from this, because this is something we can fix on it's own without having to do all of that.\n. Resolved via 7ba6722e620d4966688eebd36bbb3a57ee3a2f80. Thanks.\n. Thanks! Can you please re-submit both of these on the dev branch? There have been some minor changes there to hd homerun. thanks.\n. Hi, please either sign the CLA or I can look at implementing similar changes on my own.\n. DRM channels are just going to be removed fro the next release, thanks.\n. Send a message to a specific user or all users?\n. Hi, that's not actually an error. Please discuss your actual problem. Please see http://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/739-how-to-report-a-problem/\nThanks.\n. Hi, please try again with the latest release of Emby Server. Thanks!\n. Thanks. The only problem here is that the automatic port mapper depends on device discovery, so we're going to have to check that setting as well before shutting everything down.\n. Thanks. can you resubmit this on our dev branch so that we can submit this for testing in our pre-release builds? Thanks.\n. Do any of the omdb image providers depend on the same api urls as the data providers? That's the reason why we have caching for tmdb and tvdb, because we need to use the same data later in the image providers.\n. I just recently updated omdb and moviedb to skip these. the tvdb image provider already skips these. what further improvements does this bring?\n. Ok. Only thing is the missing episodes don't currently have a premiere date until they've been refreshed. What you should do is update MissingEpisodeProvider to set that value on new Episodes that it creates.\n. Thanks. I think we can just allow users data to get upgraded over time. There isn't a pressing need to do that immediately.\n. No, I think it should stay as-is and the database query should be adjusted to return results with and without special chars.\n. Understood, and that's what should be changed.\n. ^ yea that is probably what's going to happen.\n. Resolved for next release.\n. Hi, are you using the built-in web app on Xbox One?\n. Ok. We are not testing the built-in web app anymore on Xbox One because we have a new web app dedicated for TV use, which you can read about here:\nhttp://emby.media/community/index.php?/blog/1/entry-293-introducing-emby-theater-for-xbox-one/\n. Hi, can you let us know if this is still an issue on the latest version? Thanks.\n. Great, thanks for the update!\n. Let's do this a little differently. I'm going to delete this class from the core since it's not needed in the core server. If it's needed by the plugin, just take a copy of it there. Thanks.\n. Hi, the best thing to do is post in our community and collaborate with other members:\nhttp://emby.media/community/\nBook support was added by a community developer in the form of a plugin called BookShelf, and unfortunately I cannot really speak to the functions that the plugin supports. At the very least, you should make sure to have it installed, it's available in the server plugin catalog. Thanks.\n. can you please provide screenshots of the containing folder so that we can see all file names and paths? also, how is that library setup in emby server? thanks.\n. Hi, this is resolved in the latest version. Please re-open the topic if there's still an issue. Thanks !\n. It's not even possible to use the identify feature for episodes. We don't expose it because all you need to do is make sure the series folder is identified, then ensure the episode has season and episode numbers. Did you follow the tv naming guide?\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/TV%20naming\n. This should no longer be an issue. If it is, please re-open. thanks !. This is on hold. I think TV Maze is best left as a plugin and not a core feature, unless they later add multi-language support. \n. Hi there @michaeljbailey, I would suggest posting about this in our community to potentially encourage a community member to build a plugin:\nhttps://emby.media/community/\nI think it is unlikely this will become a point of focus for the core Emby team. Thanks !. I think it is a good attempt, but in general, the less the system knows about particular types, the more flexible it will be.\nFor example, adult videos are mostly treated like regular videos, but with some exception. Users might not want them showing up in search, suggestions, etc. instead of making the system aware of adult videos, let's instead allow those exceptions to be configured per library. Everybody wins doing it that way because there are people asking for those things already, and it will be more useful for whatever other sub-types might come along.\n. From the pure emby standpoint this is possibly good consolidation, but we support nfo generation and kodi supports long and short versions, so the current code is designed to pull in both.\n. Well perhaps another question is, what is the pressing reason to change it? \n. Besides the overview stuff, has the rest already been merged in via other pull requests?\n. Thanks!\n. Occasionally an update will require user interaction, therefore I don't think this is something we want to do. You guys are encouraged to try the new .NET Core version of Emby Server which is currently in testing, and there is a new process for the Windows Service:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/50012-emby-server-for-net-core/\nThanks.. Thanks, will take a look, and/or pull requests are welcome :)\n. probably yes, or mono develop.\n. Resolved by b11357355aebb32ec39bc9d6ac04b45934fa252a. \n. Resolved via 465ac8c62587f688703e1423872aed7f5c2d2f38\n. Hi, please open a feature request topic in the Emby community so that we can assess demand from other users. You can do that here:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/forum/98-feature-requests/\nThanks !. Thanks, but do you have access to our onesky translation site? you should make the changes there because these edits will just be lost anytime we sync the translations.\n. If you don't have access, I can give you access. Just PM me the email address that the invitation should be sent to. Thanks.\n. Obsolete due to changes about to go in.\n. Thanks for testing beta. This should be resolved with the newer builds.\n. Which fields is this currently not working for?\n. Most users don't have massive libraries. At the moment I don't want to do this. Thanks though.\n. No, can't do this globally. If the value needs to be normalized for any given provider, it should be done inside the provider.\n. No, I mean inside the individual provider class files that we have.\n. Can you submit this on the dev branch? Thanks!\n. Thanks. Softworkz reviewed and submitted a modified version:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/pull/1877\n. Hi, awesome. We used to have one but eventually abandoned it. Do you have any screenshots you can show? Just fyi, I won't be able to look at merging this in until the video players from the web app and Emby Theater are merged into a shared component. Then at that point I'll be able to look at how a mini player would fit into both apps.\n. I can't offer an eta, but since you're handy with javascript you could take on projects related to the unification that would help ease my workload and get us there quicker.\n. This will be painful but you can help get jQuery removed from these two script files:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/tree/master/MediaBrowser.WebDashboard/dashboard-ui/components/metadataeditor\nEmby Theater does not import jQuery and I'd rather not start doing that. I am working on unifying the listviews and card layouts and once these things are done, playback will be the last major piece requiring unification.\nSo although these things are not directly related to what you want, they are sitting in line in front of it so any help would go a long way to getting us there faster.\n. I've already taken care of the jQuery removal. Merging the playback frameworks between the apps is the last thing remaining.. Unification is done in the dev branch. This feature could be added to the htmlvideoplayer component.. We probably have some things to talk about. For starters, in the Emby web app, the video OSD UI is owned by the app, but in Emby Theater, it's owned by the user selected skin. In other words, the OSD is not attached to the video player, they are completely separate.  (And I see you've noticed that). This approach not only allows for skinning but it also allows for the same OSD to be re-used with alternative video players (windows, samsung, linux, raspberry pi, etc).\nSo if you pop the video player out and navigate back, you are no longer on the OSD screen anymore. So there are a few possible approaches here:\n\n\nJust have the video player own it's own mini OSD for docked mode. This would require some duplication of effort for whatever features end up going into the mini OSD.\n\n\nDo a minor rework to the OSD to separate it out from the page and into a component that can be embedded into any element. \n\n\nIn the latter approach I would imagine something like,\n\nnavigate to videoosd.html, this creates an instance of the OSD and attaches it to the OSD page. When the user navigates out of that page, you could then destroy the OSD instance attached to the page, and the docked container could create a new one. Or you can look for an approach to retain the same OSD instance.. Nick, can you please send me a PM in the emby community, thanks.. Where is http coming from though? I'd rather keep that knowledge as opposed to just having a catch all.\n. Duplicate of #1618\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/issues/1618\n. Closing - auto-organize will soon be moved to a plugin, and the community will have more freedom to help add new features to it. Thanks !. Maybe there was an issue with older versions of the server but I can't reproduce the problem. I tested adding tags to both Series and Episodes, refreshed, and the data remained.\n. I don't want the tasks to be this complicated. If this much setup is required, we've done something wrong. Instead we could do some kind of setting such as \"allow only one task at a time\". something along those lines.\n. Notification to where?\n. FYI it is better to create feature request topics in our community because that allows us to gauge interest levels from other users. Without that feedback some of these may end up sitting here in an open state forever. Thanks.\n. Thanks! can you submit on the dev branch though?\n. This is better but now can you strive to improve it even more and eliminate the need of an extra img + div on every card? Look for a css only solution that doesn't require extra elements. thanks.\n. We can't do this. While I would like to have a visible placeholder img that has it's src replaced, we need to be able to choose between filling a container with stretching and filling a container without stretching. As of today img does not offer that which is why we use background image css. This can be re-evaluated in the future as newer techniques emerge.\n. This has been added to the new stable release, 3.0.5984. It is bring your own ffmpeg though, and then the server will utilize it.\n. Thanks !\n. But it also says if you use the \"Use foldernames for lookups\" setting. What is the default out of box setting for that?\n. Anyone?\n. i haven't added error handling for this yet, so it will still happen. you'll just have to manually change the setting in the config file.\n. Sorry, this was an accidental merge. We can't do this for now due to channels (trailers) that get internet metadata from the server's metadata functions. I'll have to think about how to allow the channel to specify that.\n. If the path has become invalid, then the check on FileExists in GetParentPath could potentially cause a long timeout with a loading spinner, leading to the dreaded reports of \"not working\". So we need to eliminate that check in order to merge this in. However, that kind of defeats the purpose because then you'd be seeing one thing in the text field, and other in the result list.\n. I'm closing this right now. Adding the field to the editor would be misleading because users would end up thinking the value would actually be used for something. We're not going to add the value until something actually uses it.\n\nIf you or anyone would like to contribute by adding a metadata provider to our books plugin, I think that would be fantastic. If one of those providers can make use of ISBN, then we'll be happy to add it to the editor.\nThanks !. Not until we have a use for the data.. Jose - thanks! Just want you to know you're not being left hanging. I will start looking at this soon.\n. Resolved in 3.1.48+\n. Resolved for next release, thanks !. This will be in the next set of releases, thanks.. Please make sure to attach complete logs, thanks.\n. Ok, since you're running an older version of the server, I would start by updating to the latest version.\n. Everything that is supported is listed in the naming wiki, including examples:\nMovies - https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/Movie%20naming\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/TV%20naming\nSeason folders are probably the one area that could use some discussion in the wiki but to answer the question, it's \"Season X\", \"X\", or \"Anything\", where \"Anything\" is just an arbitrary name for a season without a number attached.\n. We don't do anything with that value, so Season 1 (2016) is still season 1.\n. Ok I see. Yes I guess this is possible but since it it organizes that one episode you might not be happy if you end up with two folders for the same season because it went through December past January of the next year. Obviously there is a solution to that but now in order to organize an episode we have to go and get info about the first episode of the season.\n. This ticket is likely to remain here in limbo indefinitely, therefore I'm going to close it. Please open a discussion topic in our community:\nhttps://emby.media/community\nIf we see enough demand for this enhancement then we'll be happy to add it. Thanks !. Try refreshing the title from the detail screen to allow it to fill in media info.  Given enough media info, it should use the mounted m2ts path.\n. Any result?\n. I would upgrade to mono 4.3.2.4, or 4.0 at the very least. we are not testing 3.x anymore.\n. I can't be sure, but i haven't seen this reported before. I can't commit to spending time researching this until I know that it occurs on a more recent version.\n. Streams disconnecting unexpectedly is a known issue with 4.4 that we're currently investigating. That's why I suggested 4.2.3.4, which we've seen great success with.\n. Thanks for reporting back. I'm not sure if you installed or built from source, but if you try the dev or beta branch, you should see much more success now with mono 4.4.1.\n. Right, so from source I assume master branch. On the download page of the website we mention how to get the beta channel, and there is a corresponding beta source code branch.\n. Great, thanks! I will test this later. Just looking at it from a glance, it looks pretty good. The important thing was making sure to handle results of the selector functions, handling the cases of 0, 1, or multiple elements, and it looks like you've done that.\n. Just fyi, this has been moved to shared components now, until the two apps merge:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/emby-webcomponents/tree/master/metadataeditor\nIf you're free to help continue with this, we also need to find a tree that doesn't depend on jquery (or just roll our own):\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/blob/master/MediaBrowser.WebDashboard/dashboard-ui/scripts/editorsidebar.js\n. We have been backtracking out of Polymer due to two specific reasons - first, there are too many quirks with their elements when running in browsers that are not based on Chromium. If you look at the web client source history you'll see I was maintaining several of my own fixes within the elements before dropping them.\nThe second reason is performance. The elements look great but don't perform well in browsers not based on Chromium, and even then, you can feel the overhead of pulling in and processing all of the html imports. It's just a little too heavy for me right now.\nI am in favor of pure web components though and you can see some examples here: https://github.com/MediaBrowser/emby-webcomponents/blob/master/emby-input/emby-input.js \nThese are much lighter, more minimalistic and more stable. They do require some compromise, for example, you might have to render out\n<label><input /></label>\ninstead of just\n<input />\nBut to be honest, I am OK with making that kind of trade-off. It is similar to the trade-offs you'd experience if you tried to move from Polymer to material-design-lite.\nAdditionally keep in mind, Emby Theater is targeting smart tv deployements, and the browsers on these tv's are often very primitive. We've been OK with polyfilling registerElement but back when we were trying to pull in all of Polymer it was just a no-go.\n. So in terms of where we are with moving away from Polymer, it is completely gone from Theater and the shared components. It is also completely gone from the browsing side of the built-in web app. It is only when you move to the dashboard side that you feel the pain of both Polymer and jQuery getting pulled in. But we have replacements ready for everything that's being used, I've just been doing the actual replacement little by little as it's obviously very tedious.\n. In the next release of Emby Server you'll be able to configure remote access on a per-user basis. Thanks.. Back when we first started we decided all dates would be stored as UTC as an idealistic approach, however, for some metadata fields or providers this has turned out to not always be practical due to the inability to predict the format of the incoming data. We currently do some gymnastics to get around it without too many issues, but at some point an overhaul probably should happen so that whenever it's appropriate we can just keep the source data untouched and not try to do anything with it. However until that time I think it's best to not merge anything like this.\n. Fantastic, thanks!\n. Thanks. Please attach complete log files, thanks.\n. Any log file that was modified during the time frame.\n. I would try 3.0.6020, along with the newly released mono 4.4.2. If there's still an issue then you might want to drop back to mono 4.2.3.4.\n. Can you make sure these changes build under .net 4.5 and don't require 4.6? thanks.\n. Thanks, yes known issue right now. It does respect parental rating and blocking via tags but not library separation.\n. Is this still needed? I have seen your newer screenshots generally do not have the Movie: prefix anymore. Thanks !\n. Are you saying you can't control these prefixes being applied? If so then that makes this a bit more urgent. I had thought all along you were just adding the prefixes as a preference.\n. This will be in the next set of test builds, thanks.\n. See https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/pull/1202\n. Hi, while we don't have a one-click package at this point, you should be able to follow the manual setup instructions on the linux download page:\nhttp://emby.media/linux-server.html\n. Closing in favor of #3298 \nPlease continue discussion there. Thanks.. You can participate in testing here: https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/59597-emby-server-for-western-digital-nas/\nThanks guys.. I'll merge this manually into the dev branch, thanks.\n. Thanks. Already made the same change.\n. Thanks! My only questions/concerns are the changes to resolution scaling. For now, I've taken I've merged in the quote fixes by hand, relating to forced key frames, because I vaguely recall an issue around that. Thanks.\n. I think the problem with the scaling here is going to be anamorphic pixels, therefore I'm going to isolate your changes to vaapi. I think users are going to report incorrect scaling but I guess we'll see what happens.\n. i already did. what is the vaapi device, and is that field mandatory?\n. Ok, thanks! I will make that the default and add this info as help text on the setup screen.\n. This is the same as the catch (IOException below it). Whether the file is locked or whether there is no write access, they will both produce UnauthorizedAccessException, so that means this change will nullify all of the checks of whether a file is locked or not.\n. Ok, my memory is fuzzy so i need to wait and see examples of exceptions from files being locked before merging this.\n. Sorry I meant a log from a locked file situation\n. This is currently working as expected.  The caching headers being applied are conditional (weak), due to the fact that the url has nothing but library Id's. Therefore if we switch to strong caching, there is currently nothing in place to bust the cache if the source file changes. If you look at the images api, we put a caching value in the url, basically the equivalent of an Etag. This allows clients to cache forever based on that url because if the image changes, so too will the url. In order to switch to strong caching, we would need some kind of an api change such as that.\n. https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/commit/dcf3509ea28e1bb0cdc3ada16432cfb50b08aac4\n. See: \"there is currently nothing in place to bust the cache if the source file changes\". That's what I added in my commit which then allows the normal caching mechanisms to be used. What you did in range request writer was just repeating the same response headers that HttpResultFactory already writes.\n. Yes, some of them were, with conditional (weak) caching. If you look at the control flow of the caching headers you see the difference between conditional and unconditional is the presence of a cache duration. The consumer up in the api layer was not supplying a cache duration (and rightfully so), therefore it was only getting conditional caching based on last modified and etag. I updated the api layer to pass in a long cache duration which now steps it up to unconditional and allows the client to cache forever. But before this could be done, we first had to devise a way to change the url if the file changes because that would be the only way to force the client to download it again.\n. Ok, then yea for transcoded output that would be expected because we don't know what the final content length is going to be. The range request writer doesn't even get used for that. That's the progressive stream writer up in the api layer.\n. Yes that is conditional caching which was already there. That requires the client to come back and check if it has changed via conditional requests. Unconditional says you can keep your copy until X expiration date without ever having to come back to see if it has changed. The only way to bust that is with a new url altogether. Granted with a large video file this is unlikely to ever be a problem, but it is possible for music.\n. ok, what is the exact difference?\n. grab the latest code again. that looks like it's missing something.\n. Ok I would just try simpler tests for now with regular library media. MediaSourceInfo has a new ETag property and we're going to have to make sure that is filled out wherever appropriate. For now I have not done that, I've only just made sure it's there for normal library media. And there will also be cases of remote media where it should just be left null.\n. Please attach a complete server log, thanks.\n. Unfortunately the log doesn't indicate what path the problem is on. did you customize any server paths? does this happen with a fresh installation of the server on default settings?\n. Resolved for the next release of Emby Server. Please re-open if there is still an issue. Thanks.. Hi, in the Emby web interface you can configure the cache location and metadata location. These are the two locations that take up by far the most space used by Emby. Is this what you're looking for?\n. Technically it is actually used everywhere since byte range requests for transcoding are always ignored. It's just the opposite scenario that is not supported. Since the toggle doesn't work we can hide it.\n. It has to remain. There is one device that needs it, and others that won't be able to function with it. So it has to be controllable either way.\n. I took care of the input changes because I became a little anxious to drop polymer, so that part is done.\n. Are there any straight up bug fixes from here that should be integrated separately from movie support? If so then please let me know. Thanks.. I'm in process of publishing auto-organize as a plugin. See: https://github.com/MediaBrowser/emby-auto-organize\nYou are welcome to take some ownership and add whatever features you like. Thanks.. This isn't valid because it should be something that pertains to the file, not the database item.\n. Ok just fyi we already have a home-grown text! require module. See if that can be used.\nMake sure to use bower instead of thirdparty if possible.\nAlso, will with these changes, will Common be able to compile if re-targeted as a .net core project?\n. So the core server would handle decryption and send the unencrypted version to external authentication providers? \n. Also, is this pull request obsolete due to #2139? It appears to include some of the same changes. Thanks.\n. Looks nice. How would this handle multiple commands in a write transaction? Or multiple result sets when reading?\n. If you're looking at this in order to prepare for a different database, since everything is based on .NET interfaces I think all we need to do is supply an alternate implementation to create a different type of connection.\n. I will be doing this soon. No need to rebase.. FYI, chrome transcoding has been switched to HLS, therefore this is obsolete now as the the HLS protocol has support for these kinds of things already. This probably should just be closed.. hls has it's own set of complexities and drawbacks but other new features have made it a necessity.. Is something wrong with it? there are 0 changes now.\n. Thanks ! I've merged these changes manually into the dev branch:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/commit/bd89529bd1e30593d1af5b5b1b7063b4d2214e49\nGoing forward, can you switch to dev? I will also publish a release to the dev channel for users to try out. Thanks!\n. Hmm, I am not sure to be honest. I wonder if ffmpeg is depending on something that is missing.\n. Can you try downloading a static ffmpeg build from:\nhttp://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-mac\nThen use the server dashboard to configure Emby server to use this verison? You can do that under Playback -> Transcoding. Thanks!\n. Hi, I'm not able to reproduce this. Please re-open if you are still having an issue. thanks !. FYI, chrome transcoding has been switched to HLS, therefore this is obsolete now as the the HLS protocol has support for these kinds of things already. This probably should just be closed.. The packages have been updated. It should be resolved now, thanks.\n. @jose-pr yea if you want to start having discussions about work that needs to be done, I'm ready to start doing that. Thanks.. I ended up implementing a much smaller version of this, but conceptually similar with the modular authentication provider.. Hi, please provide the information requested here:\nhttp://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/739-how-to-report-a-problem/\nThanks!\n. Thanks. Can you explain the approach? What is CanRestartWindowsService querying for?\n. Hi, can you look at this?\nhttp://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/39243-service-wont-restart-after-upgrade\nThanks.\n. Thanks !\n. Locate the server's program data folder, then find the /config/system.xml file. Then remove the xml node LocalNetworkAddresses, save it and start the server back up.\n. Hi, we can continue this in the emby community, where there is already active discussion. thanks.\n. No problem !\n. There is nothing wrong with that, but then again why not just add them to the core for everyone to take advantage of. What formats are they?\n. Ok, I'll add that, thanks.\n. I think we should just force 8-bit output because not all devices are going to be able to play 10-bit.\n. That is possible but it's not an end to end solution. If we fix that, then the next problem that will be reported is video not playing when the client app does not support 10-bit output.\nWe have some validation relating to the user's installed ffmpeg build, for example, we reject really old versions as well as libav forks. So perhaps this should be incorporated and just not allow the server to use it. What will happen in this case is the user will be given a choice between either updating their installed version, or they can just download a standalone copy to the folder of their choice and point emby to that folder.\n. if you run ffmpeg -encoders what is the output?\n. installing ffmpeg gives users a choice between libx264 and libx264-10bit, the former being the default choice. libx264-10bit is indeed incapable of outputting 8bit content though.\nRight now we would just prefer to require 8-bit than attempt to support both. thanks.. They certainly are. \n. Hi, are you still having an issue? I believe you created the same topic in the Emby community, can you link me to that? Ebr suggested it is probably due to your server potentially changing ip address. Thanks.\n. Hi, please try our latest Emby Server release, 3.0.8400, as well as our latest Emby for WMC release. if the issue persists, we'll take it from there, thanks.\n. Resolved in beta.\n. Resolved in beta.\n. Hi there, sorry to hear about this. Can you please provide a server log from the timeframe of encountering this issue? Instructions are here:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/739-how-to-report-a-problem/\nThanks !\n. Hi, can you please try the latest release of the server? Also, when uploading a log file, please indicate the problem that was experienced during the time of that particular log. Thanks !\n. Hi, thanks for the report. Is this still reproducible? i have a fix that can be tested on it. Thanks !\n. Thanks. if you could try the beta channel that would be helpful.\n. Resolved in onesky.\n. Thanks but this is all beginning to get hacky. It is beyond my level of comfort. At this point I would rather rewrite the entire windows service integration to be based on this\nhttps://github.com/kohsuke/winsw\n. Thanks, that should help me narrow down the issue.\n. Our freenas and freebsd packages have incorporated patches into the mono runtime to address stability issues related to the realtime monitor. I would suggest using those. These three directories are internal data folders and for the next release we're going to stop monitoring them, so that may help as well.\n. Yea otherwise you could ask around in the community to learn about the patches but it's probably not worth the time.\n. Is this for other applications to use the subtitle files? because at this point there should no longer be any issues inside Emby related to character encoding. Thanks !. Are you still having any encoding issues?. What do you mean by that?. Heads up, the newly released Emby Server 4.0 will have much improved encoding detection of subtitle files. Please try it out. Thanks !. Has anyone tried their subtitles with 4.0? The encoding detection should be very much improved so that a setting isn't really needed anymore.. Yea that error is not about encoding, it's that the srt is invalid.. Can you zip up some sample subtitle files and attach them here? thanks.. That question is for both @osrl and @theerror \nThanks guys.. Fixed via 75798465e1e3a8ea6edd505e8a6189b27edfb925\n. Hi, is this still an issue? I have not been able to reproduce this. Thanks !\n. Thanks for the info. So you think it was about a half dozen? Just trying to get sense of  how far back it was. \n. Thanks. We'll close and see if it comes up again. . Done, thanks.. Duplicate of #1634. Does this compile with both .net core and the full .net framework? Admittedly it is a little complicated for my comfort level, specifically manual parsing of the server config file as well as the manual appending to the log file.. Closing. No longer using nlog.. Hi, can you please show screenshots to demonstrate the issue? I am having a hard time visualizing this. Thanks !. It's due to the way collection images are generated. It's resolved for the next release, thanks.. I'm afraid the server-side ISO mounting is probably headed for the chopping block because it requires running under sudo (elevated permissions). We're using a standard linux feature to mount the ISO in an easy way but unfortunately it can't be done without administrative privileges. \nSince running any software in this manner is not advisable for security reasons, almost nobody is using this feature, therefore we're not really giving it a whole lot of testing.  We need to find another way to do it.\nI'm sorry if this isn't the answer you're looking for. Please note, this only impacts the ability to stream and transcode ISO content to apps like the web app, Roku, etc. You can still add ISO's to your library and play them from Emby apps that support them natively, such as Emby for Windows Media Center, Emby for Kodi, etc.. There is not right now, but what you can at least do is name your ISO's in a way so that the server can determine what kind of ISO, that will help ensure successful playback in Emby for Kodi.\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/Movie%20naming\nThanks.. Thanks. This is a translation error. It is resolved for the next release.. Hi, please try disabling the realtime monitor. Unfortunatly it is raising an error in a way that we're not able to catch and this is causing the server to crash. Thanks.. Thanks, resolved for next release.. Hi, sorry, but this is just not true at all. The only thing it touches are the image files, if not already cached, and then the theme songs/videos.. It will store images internally if configured but local images in the media folders always take priority. So those would have to be removed to avoid them from getting hit.. Can you please provide the emby server log? thanks.. Hi, thanks for the feedback. Can you explain more what you mean about processing? thanks !. When you first open the web app, what url are you initially coming in with?. Hi, the mono runtime 4.2.X is no longer supported. The minimum version we require is 4.4.2, but 4.6.2 is recommended. Thanks.. Thanks for the tip !. It's not that we don't parse them properly, it's that we don't parse them at all.. Can you please attach the complete emby server log? thanks !. Hi, please try 3.1.2. Thanks !. Where is this documented? In the kodi wiki, the examples of the set tag appear to be the same as before:\nhttp://kodi.wiki/view/NFO_files/Movies\nThanks !. I'm closing this. The kodi wiki on movie sets has never been updated to reflect any of this:\nhttp://kodi.wiki/view/NFO_files/Movies\nWe use the kodi wiki as our NFO reference. If you can please ask the Kodi team to update the NFO wiki, then once that is done you are more than welcome to re-open the ticket and then we'll take a look at what work needs to be done.\nThanks !. What exactly is the issue at this point? The failure should be resolved.. Resolved for next app update, thanks.. you can create users with a plugin. you can also just do it with the api. no need to work with the source code. You can find some api info on our wiki here:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/wiki\nHowever, creating users is not documented so the best reference will be our api library:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby.ApiClient.Javascript/blob/master/apiclient.js\nThanks.. Hi, check your system and make sure the timezone is set correctly. Beyond that, we're limited by the data coming from tvdb. The dates are not localized for different regions.. Closing, see #2486 . Merged manually.. Thanks. Please close and re-submit on the dev branch.. The file is missing all media info. We have some decision making that decides whether or not to use the bitstream filter based on media info.\nWhat this means is either - you just setup the library and the scan hasn't completed yet, or there was a problem probing the file for media info and that's why it is empty. Try refreshing the metadata from the detail screen using the 3-dot menu. then see if that fills in more information at the bottom of the detail screen.. Can't you just grab the portable download?. It appears Nano is obsolete now, therefore we won't be moving forward with it: https://www.petri.com/nano-server-today-gone-pretty-soon\nHowever, we will commit to Windows Server Core, and Emby Server already runs on that, although there is some setup required: https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/issues/2924\nIn a future update to the server we will resolve that so that the setup step is not required. Thanks !. Who created this m3u? what is the source?. This would break this example:\nEXTINF:0,84. VOX Schweiz\n. I whipped up a unit test, so just make sure these tests are passing, and add a test for the scenario you are trying to cover.\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/blob/dev/MediaBrowser.Tests/M3uParserTest.cs\nThanks.. Nevermind, i took care of it. thanks !. Hi, this is already resolved for the next release, thanks!. It sounds like your router is preventing access from the outside. You might need to configure port forwarding on it.\nI would suggest checking out our Connection Troubleshooter:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/Connectivity\nPlease try the steps listed there and let us know if you're still having issues. thanks !. Hi there, in order for us to best help you, we need a bit more information. Please provide the information requested here:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/739-how-to-report-a-problem/\nThanks !. I can reproduce it as well, there's some error about their ssl certificate. Similar errors have happened before and have been on their side. I am going to give it another day or so to see if it resolves itself before I spend any time on it. Thanks.. Please attach the complete emby server log. thanks.. What do you mean reporting selections? Playback has nothing to do with the Edit Subtitles popup.. Can you try the open beta version:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/24350-android-open-beta-testing/\nThanks !. This just happens to be the address of one of our music brainz mirrors. The above URL is now functioning correctly. Thanks !. try entering the full url and leaving the port blank.. What Emby app are you referring to? I have tested the web app, android, Theater, and iOS and the port is optional on all of them.. Thanks @animosity22 . In my testing I don't see any problems here. The OP can re-open if there is an issue. Thanks.. This will be in Emby Server 3.6.. Our documentation is up to date. Have you taken a look at our wiki?\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki. Is this still needed?. This will be in Emby Server 3.6. Thanks.. Hi, it did not disappear but was moved to per library settings under each library. But after further review I can see that they are not showing for the audio books content type. This will be resolved in 4.0.1. Thanks.. Is it possible you've not passed in a valid item id? This is a primitive api method that frequently. Is it possible the item could have been deleted?. Can you pull up the same item in the web app detail screen and use the chrome debugger to locate the same http request. can you find the differences between your request and what the web app is doing? check the http headers as well. thanks.. What subtitle issue?. Thanks for the report. We have been checking for specific levels but we're just going to skip it for all mpeg4.. This is resolved in Emby Server 3.6. Thanks.. Hi @flyingdan, are the subtitles changing with the time in this scenario, or are they stuck on a particular text? what kind of subtitles are these? thanks.. What web browser is this?. I'm aware of the issue in firefox but i cannot reproduce it in chrome. Thanks.. Http auth as opposed to Emby auth is a paradigm shift that is probably not realistic, simply because the entire system is built around emby users. \nHowever, having http auth as an additional layer is potentially doable, so that would mean double authentication. How does that affect this feature request?. Everything is based on an Emby user, so if the user first authenticates with your server using HTTP Basic Auth, they will then need to authenticate with Emby so that we can establish the Emby user for the session.. We are starting with LDAP which is now up for testing in the beta server. Http basic auth is possible for the future. Thanks.. @boospy Can you please clarify your question. LDAP is separate and by itself, it will not provide HTTP Basic Auth. Is this what you mean? Thanks.. Hi, very cool. Is this for internal PC tuners or legacy network tuners? or both?. Thanks. If you can please sign the CLA then I will look at integrating this very soon.. Merged manually, thanks !. Hi guys, please be aware this is still an experimental feature for us, and as such, we are not yet going to have the answer for every possible issue.\nHave you tried experimenting with newer ffmpeg builds? On Windows you can download a newer version here:\nhttps://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/\nOn Linux see here:\nhttps://www.johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/\nThen you can configure it in the Emby Server dashboard under the Transcoding menu. Thanks !. Ok, thanks for the info. We are going to update ffmpeg. I am closing this for now, we can reopen if it we see it with newer ffmpeg builds. Thanks !. Hi, thanks for the report. Can you please attach an Emby server log? Thanks !. Is there still an issue with the latest release? I don't have a TP-Link router for testing but I don't see any issues with linksys. Thanks.. @OronDF343 are you still seeing an issue? thanks.. Why do you think you're having an issue?. How are you measuring working or not working?. I found something that looks suspect. The url sent to the router is always the root url, missing the /upnp/xxxx sub-directories.\nLooking at the code:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/blob/dev/Mono.Nat/Upnp/UpnpNatDevice.cs#L114\ncontrolUrl is never populated, but then it is used later to build the url, and since it is null, the entire sub-directory never becomes part of the final url.. Ah yes, looking at the original code this is based on, at some point along the way i ripped out an entire method that was querying the services list and filling in that info.. Can we see what the folder structure looks like? thanks.. It appears the issue is you have songs directly in the artist folder, try making a sub-folder for the album and moving them into there. Thanks !. I am not able to reproduce this. Please re-open if you are still seeing an issue. Thanks !. Please try again with the next release of Emby Server. Make sure to run a library scan after updating. Thanks !. Hi, thanks ! Can you re-submit this on the dev branch? Thanks.. Hi there, can you please describe your issue with a little more detail? What are you entering where? Is there an error message? If so, what does it say? Thanks.. What code?. Where did you get those values?. And where exactly did you enter it? . Can you explain that in more detail? What is home desktop server finder?. Where did you put in your emby connect account?. Can you describe in more detail? I have never seen this, sorry. It pops up, you pick something, and then the box dismisses on it's own. Thanks.. What version of Chrome on iPhone?. Is this mono 4.8?. That's an older ticket, but this looks like one to keep an eye on: https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52675. There was a mono service release today. I haven't had a chance to test it yet but that would be good info to know if it still occurs with that.. You can't. If you want to move a file then you would need to do that in the file system, then run a library scan and Emby will pick up the changes.. What path are you referring to, is this a media file?. I've seen your screenshot, but the path is blurred out. That's why I asked questions about the path so that I could try and figure out what you're trying to do.\nUltimately, what you want to do is just follow these instructions:\n\n\nIs the path you want to edit a top level folder that was added in Emby library setup? If yes, then use the web interface to edit library setup as desired. That's all you need to do, and after you make changes it will kick off a library scan.\n\n\nOR, is the path a sub-folder or media file? If yes, then do whatever you need to do directly in the file system. Then once you're done, run a library scan and Emby will pick up the changes.\n\n\nThanks !. I understand. Unfortunately at this time we do not have a documented process to surgically change the path of something. The only supported method is using the interface to re-do your library setup to the new locations.\nI think this would be a good idea for us to add support for, but before we can do that we will have to test it ourselves and come up with a set of documented instructions. Thanks !. You will want to change the path in the library.db database, for all affected items. so for example if this is a folder, all child items as well.. Duplicate of #2469. Hi there @Timk69, can you please go over an example? What does the folder structure look like? Thanks !. It appears to be due to the system not supporting DualMode sockets for Ipv6, however, the mono version of BSD is throwing an ArgumentException when it's supposed to be throwing a SocketException like the other platforms do. We will have to adjust for the next release, thanks.. Hi there, sorry to hear about this. Can you please provide the info requested in how to report a media playback issue? You can learn how to do that here:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/739-how-to-report-a-problem/\nThanks !. Did you have a chance to try this?. Please try again, thanks.. Any news?. This has been added for the next release, thanks. Emby apps will need a little time to get updated but the android and windows uwp apps have been updated for their next releases. Thanks.. To be honest I don't think we have much control over this. We are using the browser's full screen api. There's no other way to do it besides that.. Yes in general i would not recommend embedding because some browsers will dis-allow certain features within the embedded frame.. Can you submit on the dev branch? Thanks !. I'm working towards getting a release out so i've taken care of it. thanks.. Nothing related to detection has changed. Best thing to do is provide the info requested in how to report a media playback issue: https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/739-how-to-report-a-problem/\nThanks !. Hi there, can you please attach the complete log file? thanks.. It looks like the server is starting up OK. What is the problem you are having?. Hi there, can you please discuss a specific example? thanks.. I've tested and it seems to be working fine, thanks.. Need more specific examples, thanks.. Ok yes i can confirm movie.nfo is being ignored. thanks.. Now available for testing: https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/54560-32609-hauppauge-support/\nHowever this is currently Windows only so if you're using TvHeadEnd then I'm guessing you need Linux support.. It's up now, thanks.. Thanks !. Please try again with the newest release of Emby Server, thanks !. This should be resolved with the latest version. If there is still an issue please re-open. Thanks !. swagger will (begin to) return for the next release, thanks.. We are switching to the Skia image processor and in my testing it seems to be processing them fine, so I am closing this. Skia has already been rolled out for Windows and Mac, and will be added to Linux releases over the next few weeks. Thanks.. Thanks ! I'll handle this on the dev branch.. What if you just shutdown from the web interface? How does that compare?. Closing with won't fix - won't fix with the current mono version that is. We are currently reworking Emby Server to run with the smaller and faster Microsoft .NET Core runtime. You can participate in testing here:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/50012-emby-server-for-net-core/\nSo far we are not seeing any issues with shutdown, however if something does come up with this version then we'll look into it. In the near future our current set of Linux packages will be switched to run with .NET Core instead of Mono. Thanks !. Hi there, can you please go over a specific example, while providing the information requested here:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/739-how-to-report-a-problem/\nThanks !. Hi, that's very old. I'm not asking for a copy of your video file, what I'm asking for is discussion of an example by providing the information requested in the link above. Thanks !. Closing, but please feel free to re-open when information is supplied. Thanks !. This won't happen if the phone is awake and the web app is in the foreground. Once the browser moves to the background the OS will suspend it after a period of time. There is not much we can do and I don't believe the browsers support playback from a serviceWorker at this time. This is why in the native apps nowadays all playback originates from background services so that once the UI is suspended it won't effect playback.. I am not sure the service worker is capable of waking the UI. It might be, I just haven't checked it's api. Even still it may not matter because if the UI is suspended then you won't get any events that the song ended. At this point we may just have to wait for more service worker features to be added.. I'm going to close this because there isn't anything we can do about it as of today. Thanks.. I think the ultimate answer is playback from service worker, coupled with a wake lock in the service worker. That will allow the UI to be suspended. I am guessing that is what they will do because that would align it with typical android and ios playback.. I suppose the stream idea is possible, in theory. I don't think the web audio thing will make any difference because the root problem is that playback in the UI cannot be controlled when the UI is suspended.. Hi, try updating the Emby for Kodi add-on. If the issue persists then yes log files are needed. Thanks.. What about Chrome instead of Chromium? I cannot reproduce this, sorry.. Please also be sure you're on the latest release of the server. Thanks.. I was able to test on Fedora, didn't see a problem. Please re-open if you are still having an issue. Thanks.. Hi, please discuss an example and provide the information requested here:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/739-how-to-report-a-problem/\nThanks !. Hi, you don't need to open a forum topic, but you do need to provide the information requested in that link. Thanks !. Can you please attach the original ffmpeg log? That has been edited and is missing some much needed debugging info. Thanks.. Did you customize anything under dlna? because i see things here that should not be happening under a default installation. thanks.. Any info?. Is this still an issue?. Just did this manually, thanks.. The core endpoints use the same method as plugins, this shouldn't be necessary. There's got to be some other factor here that's going on. . Yes I think going forward it is best to just pull it in via constructor rather than the magic property that we used to set before. Thanks.. Hi, just tested and it is working fine. That means this problem is either library-specific, or related to your version of the mono runtime.\nI notice you are running 4.4.2, our minimum supported version is 4.6.2, and we recommend 4.8.1. Thanks.. What model LG is this? On the latest release of Emby Server I tested, no problem found. I am on a newer LG though. Did you start playback from the TV or from the phone?. Closing. Need more information to proceed further. Thanks.. This isn't safe to merge. I just eyeballed it quickly and I can give you two examples. Many of the ToList() are not needed, specifically look at the ones that are happening inside of a lock statement. By removing the ToList(), the enumeration of the list is now moved to outside of the lock. Audio.cs - without the ToList() you will end up modifying the original list, which is not intended.\n. Can you give an example podcast? thanks.. It is direct playing to the url and depending on the remote server policy for access control headers that is dictating whether it plays or not. Video is working because we have an automatic switch to server transcoding in the event of a failure, but we have not yet added that feature for audio playback.. Resolved for next release.. is there an ffmpeg log? can you please attach that? thanks !. You might be interested in testing our new .NET core build:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/50012-emby-server-for-net-core/\nPlease note this is just for testing and experimentation right now. Thanks !. Either way, after looking at your error again, we did resolve a similar one. Please re-open if the issue persists. Thanks.. It's already in the api. It requires requesting the optional field OriginalTitle.. Can you please describe your issue in more detail? thanks.. Please attach the complete log file. Thanks.. Duplicate of #2015 . You can participate in testing here: https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/59597-emby-server-for-western-digital-nas/\nThanks guys.. I'm not convinced this is necessary because there is already a loop in that class that will handle disconnection. How can i simulate this for testing? Because i started watching a channel in the web app, then pulled the network cable out of the HD Homerun. As expected this caused playback to fail, and so I went back to the channel detail screen. Then I plugged the network connection back in, gave it a few seconds and I was able to click play and start playing again.. The code has changed so this is no longer applicable. I am happy to review if you can prove that it is needed, but there are already checks in place to handle dropped connections. Thanks.. I am closing this with wontfix but that doesn't mean it can't happen, it just means it won't happen in the core emby server. We can't rename our nfo's to emby because that goes against one of our major goals -\n to use a metadata format that many other applications support. What you should do is disable saving to nfo. Saving via alternative methods can then happen via a community plugin. Thanks !. Sounds like you moved files over that had already been corrupted. Locate the data/users.db file and try renaming that. Then start the server.. It could be a problem with the drive.. The answer as of today is that offline downloading quality for music is controlled via a setting in the app, however, if you're given a prompt to select quality and you pick medium, then of course it should also take affect as you expect.. This is resolved for the next update to the app and server, thanks.. Hi, no this ticket is fine here, thanks !. Yes we used to transcode to opus but after seeing a non-trivial number of random failures we were forced to go back to older, more stable encoders.. Well, i should have put more detail in my code comment but unfortunately I did not. I'll have to see if i can find the topics in the community.. Actually I think I recall that transcoding logs would look fine but both chrome and firefox would just randomly stop playing in the middle of the track. I can't make a setting for something that's just going to cause people to report problems. You can always find that file within your installation and customize it, although it will only affect the web app.. It will be coming. Thank you for your patience.. The custom font is not available in the browser. We render the subtitles directly in the browser with a presentation designed to be close enough in exchange for avoiding having to burn them in with server transcoding. However, the next server release has added a setting that will allow you to control this and burn them in if that's what you prefer. When they are burned in on the server, then all of the custom styles will be preserved.. Hi, yes this is possible and we do support it. It sounds like maybe the initial library scan has not completed and we don't know the runtime of the video. That is just my guess. In order for us to best help you, please supply the information requested in how to report a media playback issue:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/739-how-to-report-a-problem/\nThanks !. Thanks for the feedback !. Closing as won't fix. Given that we are moving away from mono and onto .NET Core, we will not be pursuing a solution for this when running under the mono runtime. If you'd like to get involved with .NET Core testing, you're welcome to do so here:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/50012-emby-server-for-net-core/\nWe've yet to see anyone report anything like this when running under .NET Core. Thanks !. I can't seem to find the changes. The link in that topic is dead.. Please re-open if you are able to locate the information. Thanks !. https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/50765-323015-beta-odroid-xu4-hardware-encoder-support/. Resolved for next release. We just won't have xbox one in that list anymore. It is creating a new UUID on every startup which means we can't unique identify it. Thanks.. Please try again. Thanks.. Did this help?. To solve the key expired error, just go back to our download page and follow the initial part of the instructions again about setting up the repository key. Then you should be able to update. Thanks.. Did this resolve your issue? Please re-open if you are still having a problem. Thanks.. Resolved for next release, thanks.. Have you attached an emby server log?. That is not a server restart, that's actually the automatic daily log restart. Try restarting the server and then attaching the new log. thanks.. I don't see any problems there. why again do you think https isn't working? We would have a massive uprising if that were the case. I'm not denying you're having an issue, but it sounds like it's going to be specific to your setup.. Moving to community https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/49403-cant-find-server-on-https-port/?view=getnewpost&fromsearch=1. OBS keys expire every two years so what you will need to do is go back to the download page of our website and do the first part of the installation process again, the part where you setup an OBS key. After that you will be able to update. Thanks.. See here\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/13029-ubuntu/page-50#entry469837. Did this help?. Yes I see your comment however if you look at the thread that I linked to, everyone else seems to be able to update using the instructions given there.. Tested, not seeing any problems at this point. Please re-open if you're still blocked. Thanks.. Tested, no problem found. Please refer to the wiki on 3d video naming as it goes over an example on how it is combined with multi-version support:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/3D%20videos\nThanks.. Please compare that to the example in the wiki. Thanks.. Hi, rather than have this topic remain open indefinitely, please file a feature request topic in the Emby Community so that we can gauge community interest. Thanks.. Please try the latest release of Emby Server and let me know how that compares. Thanks !. Please try Emby Server 3.2.32. Thanks.. Please install the latest release from the website. Multiple users have confirmed improvements. Please re-open with new debugging information if you are still having an issue. Thanks !. We have been waiting on a fix from Microsoft and we've finally gotten it. The next update to the Xbox One app will have major playback improvements, if you have new Fall Creators update installed to your Xbox. Without that it will continue to be the same as it's been for the past few months. Thanks.. @koalaeagle please let us know if this answers your question. Thanks !. If we're here trying to help you then why do you doubt that we'd actually look into the changes you need? Of course we want to help you.. Do you have logs from the older release for comparison purposes? thanks.. Yes this is by design. Since the feature is used by the store apps, allowing custom content places us at risk of violating app store policies. Additionally it is also used by our online web app, app.emby.media, and seeing that on the login screen can lead one to believe that there is some affiliation with Emby, which is obviously not the case. Thanks.. I can't reproduce this although I don't have lineageOS to test with. Can you please attach the information requested in how to report a media playback issue: https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/739-how-to-report-a-problem/\nThanks.. Added for next app releases, thanks.. We can't do that. There would have to be some other, more explicit setting. For most that would just become a guessing game.. We're going to start marking the external subtitles as default. This by itself will end up giving them higher priority than embedded subtitles that are marked by default. Thanks.. We do follow symlinks, but it happens natively within the .net framework, or in this case, within the mono runtime. I think there are some cases where mono doesn't follow them, although for most they do seem to work. We are in process of switching from .net core to mono so for this type of thing we will probably just wait and re-evaluate later once we've switched.. Are you all set now?. Fix? See my comments above that is the status. Thanks.. You might be interested in participating in Emby Server for .NET core testing:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/50012-emby-server-for-net-core/\nPlease note it's just for testing and experimentation right now. Thanks !. Can you provide more detail? How do we exactly test the same scenario? thanks.. Is there still an issue here with symlinks?. Our .net core installers are available on the website now. Please try that and re-open if you are still having an issue, thanks.. Did you enter a custom cert? Perhaps the message needs to be re-worded, but we are no longer allowing you to enable https as the external address unless you supply a custom cert.. It makes sense, it's just that Emby doesn't have any way knowing that it's behind something else that is handling ssl. So we'd have to have a way to make you confirm that.. Being able to report as https in your situation would still be nice to avoid all of those redirects.\nI guess that leaves two options - you either enter a cert into Emby, which won't actually be used since Caddy is handling it. But entering it will make the config screen happy so that you can check that box.\nOr, we could have another box you can check to indicate that Emby is running behind another web server which handles the ssl certificate. When that box is checked, the config screen would allow you to proceed.. Ok, for now guidelines would be that if you are behind a proxy then you should leave it off and let the proxy handle it. Thanks.. Unfortunately this is just a hard one to test because it is specific to the input. There is no obvious problem in the log files here. if you really think it is related to a server change then I'll need you to help by installing an older version so that we can gather some comparison data.. Please try again with the new release of Emby server, thanks.. Thanks for the feedback.. How to report a problem: https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/739-how-to-report-a-problem/\nThanks.. It should be resolved for the next release, thanks.. Hi, it looks like this is coming from a messenger plugin. Try going here:\nC:\\Users\\yesth.DESKTOP-BC49PUQ\\AppData\\Roaming\\Emby-Server\\plugins\nThen delete the plugin .dll file. I will let the developer know the plugin needs an update for the beta server. Thanks.. This is resolved for the next release of the app, thanks.. Hi, can you please provide a little more detail? What device and what app? Is it an Emby app that you're playing from?. I'm not able to reproduce this, however there are recent changes that may affect this. Please re-evaluate after the next stable release. If the issue persists, please re-open with the information requested by @sven. Thanks.. Closing, see #2865 . https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/50765-323015-beta-odroid-xu4-hardware-encoder-support/. Hi, this log looks OK. Can you please try with the latest release of Emby Server, and then if the issue persists, please attach the complete server log? thanks !. Ok well you're running a beta version there which has brand new changes. Can you compare to stable? thanks.. This is resolved for the next release. Thanks for the report.. what are your file names?. This is expected behavior because many people use 101 as season 1 episode 1. Try using one of our other naming conventions  listed here:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/TV%20naming\nFor example, s01e01.. Please attach the information requested here: https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/739-how-to-report-a-problem/\nThanks !. The problem is we have no media info for your file. Perhaps this failed during the initial library scan due to an ffprobe error. Try refreshing the file manually from the web app detail screen, then see if this fills in missing information such as the runtime. Once you have that, then try to play again.. We already do close the process, so there must be something else going on here. Please attach the information requested here:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/739-how-to-report-a-problem/\nThanks !. Unfortunately these logs are unreadable for me. One of the ffmpeg logs is 0 byte, the other contains just a copy of the regular emby server log.. This is resolved for the next release. Thanks for the report.. Well we're not assuming anything like that but there might be parts of the ClickOnce installer that are. I would just use the portable download which is also on our windows download page.. https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/50765-323015-beta-odroid-xu4-hardware-encoder-support/. This is added for the next release, but you need to bring your own ffmpeg build that supports the libraries that are needed for this.. Hi, this was due to an outage on the open build service that we use. They are back up and running now. Thanks.. Swagger support will be returning in the next release: https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/26487-swagger-ui-not-working/?p=485562\nThanks !. Hi there, can you please discuss an example, and attach the information requested in how to report a media playback issue: https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/739-how-to-report-a-problem/\nThanks !. I think what you probably need to do is just lower the in-app max streaming bitrate setting until it becomes playable.\nIn any event, we can't really proceed further without more information. Please re-open if you're able to supply it and we're happy to investigate. Thanks !. Please open this in the reports repository: https://github.com/MediaBrowser/EmbyReports\nThanks.. We already have a double tap on the left/right side of the screen to fast forward and rewind. it is just not currently working on ios devices.. Thanks. Upon a very quick initial review, I don't see any differences between that and a local copy from three weeks ago. But I will continue to investigate.. what version did you update from? and what browser do you use?. That all looks fine. I suppose you could try clearing browsing data. I'm not sure of the issue at the moment because this is tested constantly on Chrome.. Thanks, you could check the network tab in the chrome debugger and monitor to see if any http requests are failing.. Thanks for the info !. Hi, devices are actually based on device identifiers and not any kind of network related information such as mac address or ip address.\nFor example, in android we get the android ID, in iOS we get the uuid, etc. If you use two different devices there is no way to stop two devices from showing up.\nHaving said that, if you're concerned about the license, once a device stops connecting after 14 days, it will no longer count against your license limit.\nPlease let us know if this helps. Thanks.. Where is the device now? it sounds like the device still has the app installed on it.. We've investigated and have not been able to reproduce. The UUID comes from the android ID, but over time there have been changes to that (though not recently). If it happens again with any new devices then please re-open and we can look further. Thanks.. What Emby app are you playing from?. Closing with won't fix. We will have an all-new installation process very soon. Thanks.. Hi there, sorry to hear about this. Can you please discuss an example and attach the information requested in how to report a media playback issue: https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/739-how-to-report-a-problem/\nThanks !. Hi, we do have support for extras, but they need to be under the series folder. We don't currently support them underneath the season folder.. I'll test the settings on the latest version of the plugin and see if it needs an update. thanks.. Many screens have this now.. You're saying ffmpeg needs this, or the server executable?. Normally I would retain the older ticket, but since there is a lot of useful info, I am closing this in favor of #3175 \nThanks.. We have never displayed these kinds of markings in the player, just fyi.. Can you provide a sample video for testing? thanks.. Yes i was able to obtain a sample and couldn't reproduce, thanks.. This will be in the next release, thanks !. What model TV's?. Resolved for next release, thanks.. Hi, we have new guidelines for setting up a Windows Service:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/Running%20Emby%20Server%20as%20a%20Windows%20Service\nLet us know if this helps. Thanks.. Yea you can put it anywhere you want, and when you set it up you can name it whatever you want.. I've updated the instructions to let users know they can place it anywhere and update the system PATH variable:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/Running-Emby-Server-as-a-Windows-Service\nHas this answered all of your questions?. We are rebuilding around the new .NET Core runtime and the presence of the windows service would require us to maintain a project specific to windows desktops. Troubleshooting a windows service is not really something that we want to be doing.\nThank you for the feedback though. We will improve the instructions so that every step is clearly outlined.. What model TV?. Hi there, does this occur with the latest release of emby server? thanks.. Thanks. Please re-open with new information if you run into a problem.. Please attach the complete emby server log. thanks.. Hi, we are soon to replace our installation process with this:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/50012-emby-server-for-net-core/\nSummary - the mono runtime is out and .NET Core is in. Nobody has reported this on .NET Core. If you'd like to try it you're welcome to. We'll re-evaluate this once the website install instructions have been switched over. Thanks.. Closing, haven't seen any evidence of this in the .NET Core server. Please re-open if this still occurs. Thanks.. Are they named with the language? Without this the server doesn't know what the language is and that is why the downloading is happening. You can learn how to name your subtitles with the language here:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/Subtitles\nThanks.. Can you discuss an example? thanks.. Any example? thanks.. the media info from the web app of an example. thanks.. no, the media info from the detail screen. thanks.. No, this is the metadata editor. I mean the media info at the bottom of the detail screen in the web app. The same screen where you would play the video.. Click on the item in the web app and that will open up the detail screen. thanks.. That is a series folder. Can we look at an actual video file example? thanks.. And what are your subtitle download settings?. Ok, as presently constructed it is working as designed, although I can see how that would be unclear to you.\nThe reason it downloads SRT even though you already have .sub is because .sub files are graphic subtitles, and these will require server transcoding for many apps such as the web app, Roku, Smart TV's, etc.\nThe subtitle download feature has two goals - to not only help you obtain subtitles, but also to help you ensure you have text-based versions that can be delivered to Emby apps more efficiently. . Yes it's a possibility for the future. Closing this for now, will re-word the help text on the config screen.. There appears to be another outage on the OpenSuse build service. There is nothing we can do about this so you'll just have to wait it out. But see here for the new direction we're headed in:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/51846-repository-not-available/\nThanks.. Hi, can you let me know if you're seeing this on the new server release, 3.2.34? I haven't seen this issue in my testing on High Sierra. Thanks.. What model LG?. Is this still an issue on the latest version? thanks.. Is this still an issue with 3.2.50? Thanks.. Can you try 3.2.60? Thanks.. Any results with the latest release? thanks !. Hi, can you try 3.2.70? Also, does this happen when using the web app to remote control?. Thanks for the feedback !. Hi, please sign up at onesky and contribute to the Media Browser project. Your changes here will just get overwritten anytime we pull the latest translations. Thanks.. You may want to try a newer ffmpeg build and see if that resolves this. You can grab one from here:\nhttps://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/\nThen set it up under the server transcoding menu. Thanks.. Did this help?. Thanks.. Hi there, can you attach an emby server log? thanks.. Are you sure the device is actually on the network? is that ipv6 address a lan address from inside your network?. Resolved for next release.. It's fine here. I remember this happening once before to a user and the problem was either browser related or they had javascript disabled in the browser. Or perhaps it was a browser extension causing it.\n\n. Ok thanks for the info. We are about to replace the install instructions with a brand new package:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/50012-emby-server-for-net-core/\nWe won't even be using that website anymore, so for right now I am going to close this with won't fix. Thanks for reporting.. hi @louisforget thanks for bringing this to our attention.. Resolved for next release, thanks.. In the latest beta this example works just fine for me. I am going to assume it has either been previously resolved, or resolved for the next release. Thanks !. This is unsupported. What you need to do is just have one single library using the mixed content type.\nTo comment on your observations, the library options are not merged but rather it is probably a situation where it is just random as far as which set of options the library scan will utilize. By doing it this way you've set two different sets of library options on the same folders. We're not really testing this sort of thing so I would expect unpredictable behavior.. > \"It seems that an unset library does not support the same TV/Movie naming as specific libraries.\"\nCorrect, because it's nearly impossible to automatically detect when supporting all features, so some are disabled for mixed libraries. That's actually why we have the content type selections in the first place.. Closing as this is not realistic. Suggested behavior is just have one single library using the mixed content type. I am updating the TV naming guide to reflect that season sub-folders are required in mixed content libraries. Thanks.. I'm not able to reproduce this. Can you please attach the information requested in how to report a media playback issue: https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/739-how-to-report-a-problem/\nThanks !. Resolved for next release.. What audio codec are you having a problem with?. The apple tv example is not valid here because we already detect that and convert the audio as needed. If you're finding this isn't happening then please see how to report a media playback issue:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/739-how-to-report-a-problem/\nThanks.. Closing due to abandonment. @Richard87 please feel free to re-open if you are able to provide the requested information. Thanks !. @brianjmurrell, In the case of Chromecast, the Chromecast device tells us what codecs are supported, however, I believe I have heard of cases where this detection is incorrect and could possibly lead to sending audio to the TV that it doesn't support. If we're truly not able to detect this, then the only solution is a setting.\nIn the case of Apple TV and iOS, we can detect when AC3 is supported and I've not heard of any cases where this detection is inaccurate. Therefore, if you're asking for a setting as a means to resolve a problem, I'd rather just look at whatever problem you're having so that we can make it work out of the box. If it turns out that this isn't possible, then a setting would be valid, but I would like to get to the bottom of that first. Thanks.. In other words what I'm saying is that for android, iOS and Apple TV, any required downmixing should already be happening out of the box.. Those settings have been there for a long time. A use case for those settings would be running the server on a device that doesn't have any horsepower for transcoding, so you use the server switch to deny transcoding altogether. In this situation the app will do it's best to direct play the file, subject to the supported media formats for the app.. It is a setting to allow it, and applies to both music and audio within video files. Keep in mind the help text below. It is not guaranteed that all media will be playable in every app if you take away access to transcoding.. @screwfaze I have responded to you many times about this. This feature is planned for the future. By subscribing to this ticket, you can be notified as soon as it is completed. Thanks.. What is the reason to update?  x265 is already supported.. Hi, the settings are saved automatically without having to click a save button.. Resolved for next release, thanks.. I'm not able to reproduce this. Can you please attach the information requested in how to report a media playback issue: https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/739-how-to-report-a-problem/\nThanks !. Have you tried this in Firefox Quantum? I have not been able to reproduce this.. Closing as I'm unable to reproduce. If you run into this with the new server release, 3.2.40, please let us know. Thanks.. This is resolved for the next release of the app, thanks.. Again, this is resolved in an upcoming update to the fire tv app. It is not server related. Thanks.. Resolved for net release. (not 3.2.40, the one after). Thanks.. Hi, what audio formats does your bluray player support over dlna? do you know?. And what format were you trying to play?. Can you attach the emby server log? thanks.. Without a philips bluray player for testing I am really not sure. If it is direct playing without transcoding then that would suggest a very basic problem, but at the moment I'm not sure what it is.. Is this still an issue with 3.2.50? Thanks.. Is this still an issue with 3.2.60? Thanks.. Can you please try the latest release and let me know if this is still an issue? thanks.. Closing due to inactivity, but please feel free to re-open if you'd like to continue the discussion. Thanks.. This is by design. We only use it as a filter, it doesn't influence the binding.\nReason being it's just easier for us because then we need separate sockets for whatever address you enter, another one for localhost, etc.\nAnd then if we do that, then we have to start troubleshooting what happens if one of them fails to bind and the other succeeds, and how we're going to have the server react to that. So that is why we've done it this way.. Closing due to expected behavior.. Hi, yes I pushed the beta without waiting for translations. It is resolved for the next update, thanks.. Duplicate of #2999. Hi, no, #2999 is sufficient. Thanks.. Resolved for next build, thanks.. Hi, install from the website on top of your existing version and this will be resolved, thanks.. Thanks. Looks like a change we will need to adjust to. For now you might as well just go ahead into Metadata settings and put MovieDb ahead with higher priority. That's what new server installations are doing by default now anyway.. Please discuss an example and attach the complete emby server log, thanks.. Resolved for next release.. Historically, dating back to Media Browser 2, we have made Genres a global object and allowed them to be configurable underneath the server's metadata folder/Genres, using folder.jpg.\nBecause of this, it is just a known issue right now and is unlikely to change in the short term. We will have to rethink the way we handle genres. I suppose a quick and easy improvement would be to base the thumbnails using the lowest rated content. I would call that an improvement because it will decrease the likelihood if this being noticed, even if it's not a complete solution.. The next release will have a lighter header. Do you think this will be easier now?\n\n. We are gradually moving away from these tabs. Thanks.. Have you tried putting quotes around the path?. Ok, we've tested and verified this won't happen with the new Docker image on our website:\nhttps://emby.media/docker-server.html\nYou don't need to switch, as in the near future the current Docker image will be updated with all of these changes. Please feel free to re-open if there is still an issue. Thanks !. Hi there, can you please attach the information requested in how to report a problem:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/739-how-to-report-a-problem/\nThanks !. Closing due to abandonment, however please feel free to reopen if you can provide the requested information. You may also wish to try the app update that just went out. Thanks !. In the next release you'll be able to configure this per library.. hi, it works fine here. what actually happens?. Can you attach the complete log file? what versions of the .net framework do you have installed?. Tested on windows 10 in debug mode, no problem found. I will need to close this as I cannot reproduce. Please feel free to reopen if you can investigate more and find out what is going on. Thanks.. Please try this again with the next release, thanks.. Confirmed, resolved for next release, thanks.. Thanks, will do. I actually have been trying to get the build signed but the pre-signing assessments fail with unclear error messages. I think it is due to the slightly non-standard folder structure inside the bundle though.. I've added some text to the bottom of our MacOS install page. It's very minimal to try and avoid scaring people away.\nPlease re-open if you feel this is inadequate. Thanks.. Resolved for next releases, or actually two releases from now in your case. Thanks.. Hi, thanks for the report. The camera plugin is a community addition and you'll need to report this to the developer of the plugin. He can be found in the Emby Community under the name chef.\nYou might also consider removing the plugin and using our IPTV plugin as it is essentially the same concept. Thanks.. Hi, we don't currently have this publicized but I am glad you found a workaround. Thanks !. Merging with #3064. Thanks.. In next release.. @GrumpyMeow please attach the complete emby server log, thanks.. Logs are accessible from the emby server dashboard. thanks.. @TheSIlentLink and @vangeliis the issue in both of your logs is resolved for the next release, thanks.. Same reason as QNAP: https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/51334-new-qnap-package-for-testing/?p=511799. Resolved for next release, thanks.. You'll have to figure out how to delete them from your router. If there isn't a way, then you'll have to wait for them to expire.. I think this is an area we can improve upon by asking people up front what they prefer.. Our single largest point of troubleshooting every single day is always about setting up remote access, so the system is designed to be as easy as possible. I think some up-front questions as part of the setup wizard are a simple solution that will appease your concerns. Thanks.. No, I am saying that there is still more work to be done.. The next release of Emby Server will have explicit settings in the startup wizard to:\n\nEnable or disable remote access\nEnable or disable the automatic port mapping feature with UPNP.\n\nThese settings are also available after the startup wizard in the Advanced section.  Thanks for the feedback guys.. This will be in the next release of the app, thanks.. Hi, I notice you've updated to the mono runtime 5.4. Our highest supported version is 4.8.1. Can you roll that back? It is likely related to this. Thanks.. Ok, if you look at your x64 instructions and how nice and elegant they are, the good news is that we'll soon have similar for armhf. And once we have that there'll be no more mono runtime at all, and the entire installation will all be self-contained. Hopefully that will be any day now that we'll have that available for testing.. Yes you can also try out the Docker image that is available for testing: https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/50012-emby-server-for-net-core/\nOtherwise apart from that you'll just need to wait for our new arm packages, which should be ready any day now. Thanks.. Now available for testing:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/50012-emby-server-for-net-core\nThanks !. If you're running pre-release then please make sure to stay on top of the latest versions. thank you for being a part of the testing team.. Please attach the emby server log, thanks.. Closing due to abandonment. Please feel free to reopen with the requested information. Thanks.. To be honest, I'm not even sure we're going to be doing anything here. I am leaving it open so that we can look into it and entertain the thought, however if we do this then you lose the ability to pick the version and have that version transcoded at a given quality. Not everyone is using multi-versioning for different qualities. For instance, some are using it for directors cuts and things of that nature.\nThe one exception is the specialized use case that you mention of transcoding restriction + synced copies. That's an obvious situation where we would put those different versions into the player for selection.. It's resolved for the next release of the server, thanks.. I'm not able to reproduce this. Are you still seeing this on the latest version of Emby Server? thanks.. I can't reproduce it,  not even if I mash the spacebar repeatedly.. if you do this outside of video playback does it navigate backwards?. It's natural behavior of the browser to activate a button if the spacebar is pressed while it has focus. So somehow there must be a certain combination of factors causing the back button to gain focus.. Are you still experiencing this?. Are you still seeing this?. Thanks for the info.. It's not that we're going back on space, it's that somehow i think the back button is gaining focus, and as you're aware, clicking space on a focused button will invoke it.. Do you have Emby Premiere?. In that case please try this on http://tv.emby.media\nSee if it happens there. The back button there has set tabindex=\"-1\" to help avoid it being keyboard focused. I can do the same for the web app.. Please just click the link, thanks.. there's a button you can click to manually enter server info.. All connections are direct from your browser to your server.. Only Emby Connect, if you use that, and then Emby Premiere validation. That's it.. That's all i need, thanks. Just wanted to confirm that what we already have in Theater will be the solution. Thanks !. We're good for now, thanks.. Resolved for 3.6. Thanks.. Looks like this pull request has 0 changes?. Thanks !. Hi, can you discuss some examples? thanks.. I'd like to resolve this, so if you can get me some examples that would be great, thanks.. For that first example, can you confirm the file name of the non-sample media? thanks.. Can you give an exact example rather than movie title? i would like to see an exact example of both the original movie file name as well as the sample file name. thanks !. This is resolved for the next release, thanks.. Was any emby log file created under /var/db/emby-server/logs?. Is this already released for FreeBSD or did you manually apply the zip file output that we publish?. Emby.Mono.zip\nCan you try this one as a test? make sure to retain a backup. thanks.. If the issue persists, check if you have any plugin .dll files underneath /var/db/emby-server/plugins. Then try deleting those files. Thanks.. Correct.. The results above has helped narrow it down to some startup code that uses the Mono.Posix library to make syscalls to query the OS information. This allows us to differentiate between freebsd and linux. The problem is I have no explanation for the sudden failure because the code hasn't changed, nor have the included libraries.\nSo I am just going to remove it and have you guys add a command line param to specify freebsd customizations from the outside in. Might as well do it now because the library will not be usable anyway down the road with .net core.. @woodsb02 \nFor next update, please add the following to the startup command line.\n-os freebsd\nThanks.. In the meantime if you could test the latest beta zip, that would be helpful:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/releases/download/3.2.50.5/Emby.Mono.zip\nThanks.. it's possible  yes. i think the mono runtime has a defect with those events if i recall correctly. i guess i could exclude them from freebsd.. This is resolved in the latest beta zips, but as mentioned, please add the following to the startup command line:\n-os \"freebsd\"\nThanks.. Resolved in 3.2.60, thanks.. I guess that is fine for now. As mentioned elsewhere we will gradually get them removed, so ideally it would only be temporary.. What dlna player?. I'm not quite sure at the moment. Testing with windows media player as well as smart tv's this all works fine.. Where can I find this freebox? is it an app or a separate device?. Thanks for the info !. hi @anoma, can you please show us what the exact folder structure looks like? perhaps some screenshots? thanks.. Ok, that's what I was expecting to see. If you use a mixed content library then season sub-folders are required, and our wiki covers this:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/TV%20naming\nThanks.. Then in that case you need to see the complex folder structure example, also covered in the wiki. Thanks !. Closing this as it will be handled by #3207 \nThank you for the zip file example, that will be used for testing throughout development.. Hi, does the browser console show any errors? can you capture the console output? thanks.. Hi, can you reproduce this on 3.2.60? Nothing specific was done but I am just curious to see where things stand. Thanks.. Closing due to abandonment, but please feel free to re-open if there is still a reproducible issue. Thanks.. HI there. If something is not being recognized, then please discuss an example and attach the information requested in how to report a problem:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/739-how-to-report-a-problem/\nPlease check out our TV naming guide:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/TV%20naming\nThe easiest way to manage seasons is to use season sub-folders. This is the recommended approach, although we do also support episode files directly under the series folder. Please see the supported naming conventions for files that will allow you to assign season and episode numbers.\nYou cannot configure a metadata source per each library but this is planned for the future. You can however turn off internet metadata entirely for a library if that's what you'd like to do.\nIf you're having an issue with subtitle playback, please discuss an example and attach the information requested in how to report a media playback issue:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/739-how-to-report-a-problem/\nThanks.\n. Yes @Firerouge answered this pretty well. We'd like to be able to accommodate a mish-mash style folder structure in the future. Thanks !. What kind of plugin are you looking to build?. Sounds good. So you just need to setup a plugin skeleton and then add metadata provider implementations just like what you see here:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/tree/master/MediaBrowser.Providers/TV/TheTVDB\nThanks.. Closing. Please let us know if you need anything else, thanks.. Yes currently, it's always possible to change, but behind that menu is the ability to download and delete subtitles so that's why it requires admin rights.. I just meant that while I was explaining our original thinking, we are open to changing and improving it.. Well that's actually not good. That should be getting blocked at the api level if the user doesn't have permission. I think a per-library permission might make sense, similar to what we did with the delete permissions.. This will be in Emby Server 3.6. Thanks !. Yes it is, but all of the native apps will require updates to respect the new options. Thanks.. We'll add -profile:v 578 for the next release, thanks.. Please try release 3.2.60, thanks.. Closing. Please re-open if there's still an issue. Thanks.. Truthfully i don't like the way the current endpoints are done, but i did them the way that the sickbeard developers wanted for tv, and then later movies was done exactly the same way.\nWhat happens if this is music that doesn't exist on musicbrianz, or if for some reason we don't have the musicbrainz id? For this reason I would actually prefer that you instead send the path to actual media file that was updated.\nIn fact, I would actually like to just redo these endpoints into a single generic one along those same lines. You provide a media path to updated media and also an indication of what action was taken, e.g. file added, updated, deleted, etc.\nWill this work?. Ok thanks. I'll get this added soon.. I will try to write some documentation soon but hopefully you can get the gist of it here:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/blob/dev/MediaBrowser.Api/Library/LibraryService.cs#L256-L270\nThe request body will be a json payload with an Updates property, and that property is a list of updates. Each update contains a media path and an UpdateType. Even though we could probably figure out the UpdateType if we wanted to, it should be easy enough for you to supply. Thanks.. This is in the new stable release. Please let me know if there are any issues, thanks.. Ok, I hadn't thought of that, so let's first take this one step at a time. First I would test this by supplying a path that exactly matches a library folder in Emby library setup. So for example, if you setup a music library with \n\\myserver\\share\\music\nThen you could use the api to notify a song was downloaded to:\n\\myserver\\share\\music\\artist\\album\\song.mp3\n(Or whatever the path might be).\nWithin 1-2 minutes you should see a logging statement that says something like\n{Title} (\\myserver\\share\\music\\artist) will be refreshed.\nOnce you've verified this, then from there we can talk about path mapping. Thanks !. Ok thanks for verifying. If we want to minimize work on your part, then here's what i can do to increase the likelihood that this will work out of box.\nWhen users setup their library folders, they can optionally correlate a shared network folder with the local library folder that they add. This allows the server to use the local folder for internal access, and client apps use the shared network folder. \nWhat I can do is take the path you supply with the api and try to match it against both. While this won't be bulletproof, it should be sufficient if you add some help text when they setup the notification mechanism. Is this good enough?\nIf you want it bulletproof, then you might want to support a path substitution mechanism on your side where you can do a string replacement on the path before it gets sent to the emby api. This would allow the user to correlate a path that is configured in your app, with a path that is configured in ours. Let me know what you think. Thanks.. Hi, I removed this because it's not actually used in the core server and I generally don't like keeping code around that isn't used. I am open to a more modular container system where both the server and plugins could use the same thing.\nBut until we have that I would suggest defining objects in your plugin class, and assuming you've setup a static singleton like most other plugins, you can then access those objects that way. If you have any objects that need disposal, you can have the plugin implement IDisposable and handle it there.\nI realize this isn't the dependency injection you're asking for, but it does at least give you some kind of life cycle management. Thanks.. Hi, I just tested, no problem found. Please discuss an example and attach the information requested in how to report a media playback issue:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/739-how-to-report-a-problem/\nThanks.. Closing as this was answered in the community. Thanks.. This is resolved for the next release, thanks.. Hi there, welcome. Can you please discuss some examples and attach the information requested in how to report a problem:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/739-how-to-report-a-problem/\nThanks !. How are you determining matched? Is that just by the presence of the image?. Ok, this actually isn't a matching issue. By default we only use local images in your music folders + embedded images in your audio files. If you want images to be downloaded you'll have to turn on audiodb fetching under Library -> Metadata, and then you'll have to manually refresh your music library.. Hi, has this answered your question?. Can you discuss a specific example? thanks.. did you click save on all three after making those changes?. Do they have musicbrainz id's? that is what we use to download from audiodb.. Try using the Identify feature for one of those albums or artists.. That's ok, musicbrainz search does not include images. So did you go through the identification process?. Ok, now let's look at why this didn't happen automatically. can you pick another artist, and do a manual refresh of that artist. Then please attach the emby server log. thanks !. Did you have a chance to try this?. Hi, please try the new release of Emby Server and let us know if there is still an issue. Thanks !. I figured out why it was not getting the metadata on the first try, but was succeeding with a refresh. It is resolved for the next release. Thanks.. Thanks. We're no longer swallowing that I/O error which means now it will be logged anyway.. Please attach the complete emby server log, thanks.. Wait, nevermind, the plugin needs to be updated for the beta and we just haven't done that yet.. hi @JimBobSquarePants can you please attach the complete emby server log from when this happens? You can send it to me privately in the Emby community if you prefer. Thanks.. Thanks for the feedback and apologies for the disruption.. Closing, please re-open if you need further assistance. Thanks.. This will be in the next release, thanks.. Hi, good catch, thanks. Resolved for next release.. Hi, since you can reproduce this, can you please try the following. Open the library editor for a library that has more than one path.\nInstead of clicking the Remove button, just click on the text of one of the folder paths. When you do this, it will show another window. Does this window display the correct path, or not? Thanks !. Perfect, thank you. So that confirms that the directory picker chooses the right value, but the remove button does not. Even though I'm not able to reproduce this, I should be able to hunt down the differences. Thanks !. Please try with the new 3.2.70 release. thanks.. Ok, closing this. Please re-open if there is still an issue. Thanks.. Can you please try this version? \nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/53753-emby-for-android-libmpv-testing/\nThanks.. Thanks for the feedback.. You're saying you put a slash in the name? If so that's not allowed. We'll have to catch and handle that and show an error message.. As of right now pretty basic. Alpha numerics along with some additional characters like dashes, underscores, etc. Basically what would be acceptable in a windows folder name.. Resolved for next app update, thanks.. Resolved for next release of the app, thanks.. Hopefully soon.. Hi, if you want this to just work universally, then you really should tag the defaults in the files themselves rather than relying on settings in media management tools such as Emby.. Do you still see value in this?. This is resolved for the next release of the app, thanks.. Added for next release of Emby Server.. Hi, can you provide a sample video for testing? thanks.. Hi, this plays just fine for me in firefox (and chrome). I tested by pre-selecting each of the audio tracks in both browsers. In case it might matter, I'm on firefox 58.. No, I didn't have audio, sorry. So that's the open issue.. Do you have microsoft edge to test with? or android chrome on a mobile device? I'm curious if it happens with either of those. Thanks.. Ok. I guess we need to see if there's a transcoding adjustment we can make to account for this, maybe by shifting timestamps. I'm not quite sure yet.. Can you provide a sample again? I think I may have misplaced it. Thanks.. What is your name in the Emby community? I thought you sent the file to me over PM, maybe the link is still valid but i can't find our conversation. Thanks.. I'm happy to look into getting these files to work in all apps, but due to inactivity I'm going to have to close this topic. Please feel free to re-open with the requested information. Thanks.. Can you attach the emby server log? thanks.. Closing. Please feel free to re-open with the requested information. Thanks !. Hi, that's not easy to do. It would be much easier to instead whitelist the ip addresses that you consider to be friendly.. The ability to associate an IP with a country is not always easy, especially when taking VPN's into consideration. That's why I think it would be out of our scope because i see a lot of troubleshooting in our future such as \"X ip address was detected as the wrong country\". The amount of time we would end up spending on that I think would just pull us away from media management which is where our focus is. A whitelist on the other hand is something we can easily do. Thanks.. Hi there, do they appear correctly in the web app?. Can you please zip up some sample subtitles and attach them here? We will need to test and see if this might be a platform defect. Thanks.. Ok we've tested this and it looks like a platform defect as far as we can tell.. That app has it's own embedded video player with custom subtitle rendering i would imagine. We are using the apple video player libraries, and therefore, platform defects become our defects as well.. Hi, if you'd like to join the iOS beta it may be resolved here: https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/57242-150-new-video-player/\nThanks.. Resolved for our next app releases with the new video player, thanks.. Hi, this is not related to the core Emby Server. The Statistics plugin is a community addition that is built and maintained by a community developer. Please report this to the developer in the plugins section of our community:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/forum/46-plug-ins-and-themes/\nThanks !. Hi, please try the emby/embyserver docker instead of emby/embyserver_netcore\nLet us know if the issue persists. Thanks !. Answered in community, thanks.. Hi, can you try going here: http://www.hauppauge.com/site/support/support.html\nAnd installing the latest windows 10 hauppauge software? thanks.. Did you install the WinTV software?. Closing, but please feel free to re-open with the requested information. Thanks.. Yes, it's already in the beta release if you want to grab that from the website.. The new release is up. Please let us know if there is still an issue and we'll re-open and investigate. Thanks !. Hi, are you asking about the folder sync feature?. The next release of Emby Server will expand on these features:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/58172-33120-convert-media/\nThanks.. Closing. Please feel free to ask additional questions. Thanks.. Hi, did you customize the server's transcoding temporary folder?. Hi, any news? Thanks.. Closing due to abandonment, but please feel free to provide the requested information and re-open. Thanks.. HI, just use this as your wan address in settings\nhome.mydomain.net\nYou don't need to add /emby, the apps will handle that automatically.. Resolved for next release, thanks.. Closing due to profanity. Please feel free to edit your postings to be a little more civil and polite, and then you can re-open the issue. Thanks.. Resolved for next release, thanks.. It's isolated to the trailer plugin. you can just uninstall that for now.. Hi, this isn't true. We don't ignore these. There must be another explanation.. No problem, glad you sorted it out.. Thanks, this is resolved for the next release.. HI, multi-part is a core feature and this is something our apps need to support without any plugins.\nTo answer the question more specifically though, server plugins do not have the ability to influence client-side behaviors. They are generally just for providing data to the server.. Hi, it's possible for the future but we already have a Docker image. Have you tried that?. What dependency issues? Our new linux packages have no external dependencies that are required.. Why do you feel that you can't disable DLNA?. Just to clarify, you can disable all of the DLNA features, but since there are other components that depend on network device discovery, there is currently no setting to disable that. . Ok, what we can do for the next release is delay starting the device discovery component until another part of the server requests it. This way if you disable both dlna as well as the automatic port mapper, then it will never be requested.. Added for next release, already in the beta. Thanks.. I wonder if we could also just compile ffmpeg for windows with all dependencies self-contained.. Should we do anything here?. Are you still having trouble with this?. https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/59558-beta-amazon-alexa/. Hi, now that we have our own package we will be looking to go into the official repo. Thanks.. Added for next release, thanks.. This is resolved for the next update to the app. Thanks.. shoot, i merged this by accident thinking this was another PR for the tvh plugin. this is a little too dirty for my liking.. I think what you're going to need in addition to that is a custom api added to the plugin that will serve as an in-between. And then you can have the plugin return a localhost url for the image, and when the api gets hit, it will download the image from tvheadend and figure out the content type so that it can fill out the response headers.. This method will be slower so i will just use your previous hack just so that we can get the images working. thanks.. Strange that doesn't sound right. What runtime is the plugin project targeting?. Oh wait I see from here, the IHasMetadata interface is gone. If you pull the latest nuget then you should be fine. It sounds like you haven't actually updated that.. I don't have an answer for you then, because that code appears to be compiled against an older nuget version. In fact, other plugins performing the same operations were able to be updated for the newer server  by updating nuget.. Glad you sorted it out, thanks !. Hi there, can you please attach the complete emby server log? thanks.. Resolved for the next release of the server, thanks.. Hi, this is resolved for the next release. It should already be in the beta. Thanks.. Hi, what you should do is first visit the plain http page using port 8096. From there you can setup SSL support which will allow you to use port 8920. Thanks.. Hi, did this help?. Can you close and resubmit on the dev branch? thanks.. These assemblies are proprietary. Well, except for Naming. It's mostly just added that way out of convenience.. Hi, thanks for this investigation. We currently require some folder structure but this is something we plant o remedy and move to a media-driven model that will accommodate any folder structure.\nI've created a new ticket to track this and I'll merge this into that:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/issues/3207\nThanks.. Hi, we should already be doing this. In fact, the local images are given priority over internet images. How are your images named?. A few are supported. They are listed in our music wiki:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/Music%20naming\nfolder.ext is the most common.. Just curious, what are your file names?. What happens if we pick the first image out of the five and then you come back and say you'd prefer it was a different one? Why not just quickly rename one to folder.jpg?. I never like to reject feature requests outright but at the very least I see this one sitting open for a long time so I would suggest just using a rename utility to create folder.jpg files from your existing images.. Thanks. I'm going to go ahead and close this as I think that would be the best approach. Thanks.. Thanks. This is showing 9 changed files though. If you can reduce that to only the files that have changed, then I will merge in.. Did turning off the realtime monitor help?. Has this helped?. Ok, I'm going to close this as I don't think there's a whole lot we can do and we're working on a .NET Core based package for FreeBSD. Thanks.. Merging this into #3207 \nThank you for the zip sample.. @anoma I haven't looked at your examples in depth yet, but if your folder structure does not match what is listed in our tv naming guide, then yes it is related.. Developer note, see zip file example in #3068 . Another zip sample in #3205. Hi, it's resolved for the next release, thanks.. Hi, you'll need to remove the theme videos plugin .dll file until the developer has issued an updated version. Thanks.. Thanks for the feedback. You're saying you want a separate app from the apps we already have?. I don't think dedicated apps are realistic for us, but if you check out our recent Android TV update, we're able to put content right on your device home screen:\nhttps://emby.media/emby-for-android-tv-oreo-ready.html\nThis can allow you to get to what you want with a reduced number of clicks.\nWe are going to be doing this sort of things on all platforms where it is possible to do so. Please let me know if you have additional questions. Thanks.. I'm going to close this, however we are happy to hear your feedback on our existing apps and what we can do to make them better for you. Thanks !. Well, we won't add this to the search api because starting with 3.5 you can use the regular items querying api and simply include a SearchTerm param. Going forward that should be how you search.\n@softworkz  dev note - In ItemsService, come up with a way to expose query.AnyProviderIdEquals with the api.. This will be in Emby Server 3.6. Check out the AnyProviderIdEquals param in swagger. Thanks.. Other than metadata where did you find absolute paths?. They'll be saved with tokens for the next release, or two releases from now most likely.. It will be changed to immediate, two releases from now. (Not the upcoming release we are working on rolling out). Thanks.. What last update?. I wouldn't worry about it. The hls library that we're using has very verbose logging to the console.. Can you provide the ffmpeg log? thanks.. Are you still seeing this?. I'm closing for now because I can't reproduce this,  but please feel free to re-open with the requested information. Thanks !. server/ffmpeg log?. Closing due to abandonment. Please feel free to re-open with the requested information. Thanks.. Hi, in the server dashboard under library -> display, you can turn on the folder view option.  In the current release version it won't display perfectly as folders, but it's resolved for the next release, thanks.. Why doesn't it look better?. Right, that's not the folder view i was talking about. I would just wait and try again with the next release of Emby Server. Thanks.. Thanks. I wrote this slightly different to the way you did it, although conceptually the same idea. Thanks.. Hi, since you've opened a topic in the ApiClient repo, we'll continue the discussion there:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby.ApiClient/issues/41\nThanks !. Thanks, this will be resolved two releases from now, not in the upcoming stable, but in the release after that.. what app is playing?. What version of Chrome?. Did you have multiple browser tabs open?. What version of the server are you on?. Thanks. It's resolved for the next release.. Resolved for next release, thanks !. Stop using the AddChild method. Just copy the files and let the regular library scan take it from there.. When I look at the auto-organize code from a few weeks ago, there were no calls to folder.AddChild. I see that you have added this to both TV and Movies, but it's not a good thing to be doing. Remember what I said that the plugin should be only be an automated alternative to manually copying the files.\nIf you copy the files in manually, the next step is running a library scan or waiting for the realtime monitor to pick up the changes, and that's exactly what the plugin should do. Just copy the files without using AddChild.. Yes, we can continue in the PR.. HI, please attach the emby server log from the timeframe that you experienced a problem. Thanks.. Closing due to abandonment, but please feel free to re-open with the requested information. Thanks.. Resolved for next release.. On the stable server, you need to enable the per library option to store artwork and metadata in media folders. On the beta server, this has been changed to a per library option to store subtitles in media folders. So please verify that. . Server log? And yes it is, but if they fail to save due to permissions, it will automatically switch to saving to an internal folder. That's most likely your issue.. Glad you sorted it out.. Hi, your files look fine. It is automatic. Maybe you had pre-existing metadata files, in which case that would be the metadata source. Or maybe there was a tvdb outage or other kind of download failure at the time. Please attach the information requested in how to report a problem:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/739-how-to-report-a-problem/\nThanks.. Ah yes I completely missed that, thanks @Penkethboy . What device?. Resolved for next app update, thanks.. Please discuss an example and attach the information requested in how to report a problem:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/739-how-to-report-a-problem/\nThanks.. Ok, we'll continue in the community thread. Thanks.. Server log?. Right well it says pfx right on the setup screen :). Server log?. Closing due to inactivity, but please feel free to re-open with the requested information. Thanks !. Hi, try configuring the secure connections mode setting.. Since you opened a topic in the Emby community as well, we can continue the conversation there. Thanks !. Hi, this isn't a problem. At various sizes, it will either be one line or two lines. Nothing to worry about.. I'm closing this sorry. It's a very simple responsive css. At X resolution one line, Y resolution two lines.. Hi, please open this in the Emby for Kodi repository:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/plugin.video.emby\nThanks.. It could be permissions. It could also be a defect in the 2.07 version of the .NET core runtime, which the 3.4.1 release updated to. The error is coming from the runtime itself so there's not much we're going to be able to do about it. The next release will be updating to the 2.1 version of the runtime so perhaps that will resolve it.. Closing as there isn't really anything for us to do here. Please try again with the next release and the updated .net core runtime. Thanks.. Not yet because we allow admin users to remote play content to devices no matter who is logged in, no matter if that user has access to the media or not. I can't just add a restriction easily without breaking that, so it will have to wait until we can rethink that and solve both requirements together.. It's resolved for the next release, thanks.. Closing based on your comment in #2431 . It's resolved for the next release, thanks.. Hi, it's not by design, it's just an open issue on desktop layouts right now. Thanks.. It's resolved for the next release, thanks.. Once it gets added to Microsoft's kestrel library then we'll adopt that implementation. Looks like they have an open ticket about it:\nhttps://github.com/aspnet/KestrelHttpServer/issues/73\nThanks.. Hi, please use EmbyServer.exe. If you are intending to run as a windows service, instructions for that can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/Running%20Emby%20Server%20as%20a%20Windows%20Service\nThanks.. Please let us know if you have additional questions. Thanks !. Can you try another browser? I can't reproduce this, however occasionally i have heard users on gentoo mention this.. I was able to reproduce in firefox on windows. It's resolved for the next release, thanks.. Hi, thanks for the info. Just for some context, Genres came first and there is a field for that. GenreItems was added later so that we could include the GenreId so that apps could query by genre id instead of genre name. We couldn't change the structure of the Genres property without breaking apps so had to just introduce GenreItems. This is just intended to be a substitute for Genres.. Since we've already had this for a couple years now, I'll just make sure the wiki is up to date but I'm not going to make a change at this point, thanks.. Docker betas are currently on pause while we work out some changes. Thanks.. Updated docker betas are on the way up. Thanks.. Can you please attach the emby server log? thanks.. I'm not able to reproduce this. Please try again with the next release, and then if there's an issue feel free to re-open the ticket. Thanks !. Thanks for the feedback !. This will be in the next release. Thanks.. Thanks for the report. Please try this again with the next update to the app.. Resolved for next app update, thanks.. Thanks, resolved for next release.. Can we look at an example? Please attach the information requested in how to report a problem:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/739-how-to-report-a-problem/\nThanks.. Resolved for next release, thanks.. Not at this time, however you can find src.rpm's for older versions here: https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Aemby&package=emby-server\nThanks.. Yes some screens already have this where they remember the filters and sorting. Over time it will be implemented in all screens. Thanks.. They will be saved in Emby Server 3.6. Thanks.. I didn't know there were x64 WD's? I thought they were all armel. It's been a while since I've looked at them all. I assume by arm you mean armel?. You can participate in testing here: https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/59597-emby-server-for-western-digital-nas/\nThanks guys.. Closing. This will be up on the website soon. Thanks everyone.. Well the source is there, but it looks like i may have mis-tagged. You may just have to fix this up manually by building from the merge commit that bumped sharedversion.cs from 3.4.0 to 3.4.1.. Thanks, I think you opened a topic in our community so we'll assist you there. . Closing this as we are discussing this in the community. Thanks.. They currently aren't available. It's just easier for our build process right now to keep the output files in the repository. At some point we will look at reworking this. Thanks.. This is resolved for the next release, thanks.. Resolved for next release of the app and server, thanks.. If you're running our legacy install package, then right now a manual update will be required. The steps listed to do so are in posts #3 and #4 here:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/58613-question-about-my-32-bit-upgrade/?p=574032\nThanks.. Right now there are some compatibility problems with the older OpenSuse installations that are making this difficult. We will probably later setup a brand new repository for our newer packages, but we don't have one at the moment.. We're not going to be using the opensuse repositories anymore, but we most likely will set up new ones in the future.\nPlease feel free to leave feedback here:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/issues/3283\nThanks !. the server log would be good, thanks.. Resolved for next release, thanks.. Dev note: I've created a failing unit test for this in the Emby.Naming project, so ideally all that needs to happen is getting that test to pass, without breaking any others.. Resolved in Emby Server 3.6.. Resolved for next release, thanks.. Oi, n\u00e3o temos planos para o Torrent, desculpe.. Resolved for next release, thanks.. It does capture the changed imdb id, issue is you go to refresh the item and the MovieDb id is the highest priority movie fetcher, and that is keyed off of MovieDb id which still has the old value.. I haven't had a chance to come back to this yet, thanks. . You're changing the contents of an existing nfo to point to an entirely different movie. Isn't this going to be a pretty rare scenario?. I've resurrected our old lastfm plugin into a new repository. I will help ensure it is compatible with newer versions of Emby Server, but we will have to depend on community help to ensure it is still compatible with last fm.\nThe source can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Lastfm\nThanks !. Keep in mind that fanart.tv has the highest quality music images available, and we already have audiodb as a secondary option. I haven't seen too many incorrect ones on those.. Sorry, wrong issue.. This will be in the next release, thanks.. I've resurrected our old lastfm plugin into a new repository.

Thanks !. Resolved for Emby Server 3.6.. The libraries will have a folders tab in the next release. thanks.. The newly released Emby Server 4.0 will feature faster library scans. Thanks.. Added in 3.6:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/62657-36040-transcode-throttle-is-back/. Ah I see you're on FreeBSD, the version of Emby server is running a little behind at 3.3. The latest version is 3.4.1 but that hasn't been released for FreeBSD yet. 3.4.1 has some improvements for this, but the latest beta release has even more. We're soon going to begin development on our own FreeBSD package that we can make immediately available following every new release. You can read about that here:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/12906-freebsd-package/?p=588153\nSome users in that topic have even figured out how to update their mono install manually and then manually update the server install, but we don't have any official instructions for that.. I'm not sure yet.. Resolved for Emby Server 3.6. Thanks.. Resolved, thanks.. See here: https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/60213-34121-resolution-reported-in-reverse/\nThanks.. Resolved for next update, thanks.. Hi there, welcome. Please open this topic in our Kodi repository:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/plugin.video.emby\nHowever, since you also posted in our support community, we can just keep the discussion there and respond to you in one place. Thanks.. Duplicate of #2442 No playqueue. It's pretty basic at this point. It's something we'll improve in future releases.. Resolved for next release, thanks.. No longer applicable.. This will be handled by #3388 - Add in app settings to indicate support pass-through formats\nThanks !. Please attach the complete ffmpeg log and the emby server log. thanks.. Can you please provide the requested information so that we can learn more about what happened and what you were trying to do? thanks.. It's up.. You'll need to build a plugin by following our plugin building guide:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/wiki/How-to-build-a-Server-Plugin\nAnd put this class into the plugin.. Got it ok. Then try playing it in the web app.. You dont' call it. It calls you.. Remove the defunct metadata viewer plugin..

Closing this since we are already helping you in the Emby community, and one place is sufficient. Thanks !. What have you been using as the basis for homebrew? Everything has been tagged and done the same way as previous releases.. Yes that would be great, thanks !. Hey, just one to confirm that when installing through ports, does the server end up in the Applications folder similar to our MacOS install instructions on the website? The instructions ask them to drag it into Applications. The server has to be run from there rather than an arbitrary location or it will be denied access by the system to do certain things, such as launch it's embedded ffmpeg. Thanks.. Perfect, thanks.. Resolved for Emby Server 3.6. Thanks.. What domains are you using?. We'll look at this. Thanks.. Resolved for Emby Server 3.6.. Resolved for Emby Server 3.6. Thanks.. There are some libraries that are currently closed source. I will be looking at your IsoManager issue soon and I will get back to you on that. Thanks !. Can we look at what requests these are? Because if there is server activity coming in, then doesn't that imply the machine should be awake anyway? Thanks.. Exactly. I don't necessarily have a problem with adding an option, but i would like to learn what is causing the spin up as opposed to just blindly adding it.. Ok so you weren't actually able to isolate the logging as the reason for the NAS waking up?. Closing due to inactivity although I'm happy to continue the discussion. The reason I don't think logging is the issue is because we have worked very closely with Synology users to refine the logging to make sure there isn't too much logging that will prevent the NAS from sleeping. Thanks.. Resolved for Emby Server 3.6.. Resolved for next app release.. https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/60857-watched-episodes-not-removed-from-folder-sync. Resolved for 3.6.. Resolved in 3.5.2. Thanks.. We will be improving this in the future. Thanks.. In Emby Server 4.1 we are looking into preserving all audio tracks when using the conversion and sync features. Thanks.. This will be in Emby Server 4.1, thanks.. Resolved in 3.5.2. Thanks.. Can you please describe \"does not work\"? Thanks.. Closing due to abandonment, but please feel free to re-open with the requested information. Thanks !. This won't be happening out of the box. We previously tried to do this before, and feedback was very harsh from users who are not manually curating their track titles, as they were seeing what appeared to be random titles.\nWe will add an option to force original track titles. You can subscribe to that by following #3331 . Thanks.. Resolved for Emby Server 3.6.. Resolved for Emby Server 3.6.. Coming in 3.6.. Hi there, thanks for the contribution! Can you please submit this text on Onesky instead? Any changes you make here will just get replaced whenever we update the text from Onesky. \nTo update on onesky, simply sign up on their website, and then search for the MediaBrowser project. Thanks !. Resolved.. Resolved for next app update.. Resolved for next set of app updates.. It's planned for the future. Thanks.. Hi, releases are now here:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby.Releases\nThanks.. Hi, are you still having an issue with this?. Hi, are you still seeing this with 3.5.3? Thanks.. Can you try this, instead of adding smb paths to emby, first mount them to your OS as a local folder. Then add the local folder path to Emby. Please let me know if this makes a difference. Thanks.. How does it change anything? it's just two different ways of importing an smb share into Emby. . This is resolved for the next release (3.6), although I would suggest choosing NFS instead. Thanks.. Resolved for next set of app updates.. Resolved for next set of app updates.. That code will only matter if you are actually using smb or unc paths, which in the above example it appears that you are not.. Yes OK. Problem is this is supposed to be happening automatically in the netcore runtime, and it isn't, so unfortunately the issue is there. There is an open ticket about this in the corefx repo.. I know that is still an open issue, but because there's not a long we can do besides wait for this to be implemented in the netcore runtime, I am going to close this, just so that we can keep our issue list clean. Thanks.. Since we helped you in the forum we can keep the conversation there. Thanks.. Resolved for Emby Server 3.6.. Dev note: Only as needed to prevent disk space errors.. Added for next release.. It's definitely interesting, it's just a question of will the audience for that be large enough to justify the cost of adding another installation package option to our roster.. Hi, if you use one web app to control another web app, do you see this issue?. I'm going to close this due to lack of response, however, just so you're aware, in all likelihood this is an issue within the app that you're controlling. Thanks.. Hi, I'm not able to reproduce this. Does the browser debug console show any errors?. Can you attach the complete console contents? Thanks.. Can you still reproduce this in MS Edge?. Ok i still can't reproduce this.. Is the proxy adding a CSP?. Can you try our hosted web app and see if there's an issue there?\nhttp://app.emby.media\nThanks.. Do you still see this with the hosted web app? Thanks.. Can you still reproduce this?. Hi, this is not true. When you disconnect it asks you if you want to shutdown the chromecast app. Click no.. Yes you're right thanks. We don't support this but we probably should.. This is something that would be nice eventually, but it would require streaming from mobile device to chromecast, as opposed to emby server to chromecast. we are not yet at the point of looking at that.. Is this still an issue?. Resolved for Emby Server 3.6.. Hi, just tested and confirmed that it's working fine here. Please see how to report a problem: https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/739-how-to-report-a-problem/\nThanks.. Is this all good now?. Closing due to inactivity. Please feel free to re-open with the requested information. Thanks.. Resolved in latest update.. Hi, the mobile app is not open source, but android auto support is planned for the future. Thanks !. Hi, is it necessary? New content types are a lot of work for us. There is music, and the next release will have audio books. I would think one of those two should be close enough, no?. I would use audiobooks with the next release. I think you will find that close enough to what you are looking for. Thanks.. We will be getting an update out to resolve this. Please see here for additional info:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/62404-google-chrome-v69/\nThanks.. Hi, yes it's a great idea. Thanks.. Resolved for the next app update.. Thanks. This is resolved for the next release, although it will not be able to correct installations that are already affected.. Resolved in Emby Server 3.6.. Hi there, can you attach the complete emby server log? thanks !. This is due to the defect that was in 3.5 and 3.5.1. It is actually a .net core runtime defect and as a result we've disabled the audiodb provider until .net core 2.1.5 is released with the fix.\nHowever, your music library still has audiodb image urls saved and the server is still attempting to download them, thus causing the crash. Your only fix right now is to remove your music library from emby, run a library scan after removing it, and then you can add the music library back. thanks.. Please let us know if there is still an issue. Thanks.. Hi, our ffmpeg build is missing a library. It is resolved for the next release, thanks.. It's contacting an external provider. Every once in a while, some of those requests may time out. You can always just disable the feature if you don't want to see these in your log.. That's because timeouts are going to result in delays. My suggestion is just have it run in the middle of the night and then you can just set it and forget it without having to care how long it takes.. It depends on how you've configured the downloading.. Hi, this is resolved for the next release, thanks !. To me that just sounds like it can't download the data fast enough. . I would try lowering the in-app quality setting in case the bitrate being delivered might be too high. Thanks.. Did you try this?. https://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/63827-add-movie-extras-to-playlists/. Resolved for Emby Server 3.6. Thanks.. Resolved in Emby Server 4.1.. Can you list the specific log messages that you'd like to see changed, along with examples of what they should look like? Or is it just auth-error for right now? Thanks.. Added for Emby Server 3.6. Thanks.. Added for Emby Server 3.6. Thanks.. Resolved for next release. Thanks.. Is this still an issue?. Have you looked through the Emby Community? There are many examples of similar reports as this, and then with a little adjustment to proxy settings there was no longer any problem.. Can you please try this with the new 4.0 release? thanks.. Closing due to abandonment. Please feel free to re-open with the requested information and we're happy to help. Thanks !. Are you still having a problem with this? thanks.. Closing due to inactivity, but please feel free to re-open with the requested information. Thanks !. Duplicate/merging with #2646 - Channel groups for LiveTV #2646. Hi, we answered you in the Emby community, thanks.. Please see here:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/blog/1/entry-423-emby-server-34-released/. Sorry, my mistake. Please see here:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/blog/1/entry-437-emby-server-353-released/\nThanks.. It's resolved for the next release of the app, thanks.. Hi, can you please discuss an example? thanks.. Thanks !. Hi there, have you explored advanced server settings?. I'm referring to the lan networks setting.. Thanks !. Resolved for Emby Server 3.6.. Resolved for Emby Server 3.6. Thanks.. Hi, we don't believe there's an issue here. mtime is bumped when we make a change to the files, it just means they haven't changed since then.. Thanks for reporting.. Hi, yes it looks like you're right. I'm re-opening this ticket for tracking purposes. Is this causing you any problem?. Or if you're on arch linux then you will need to go back to ffmpeg 4.0.2.. From your other topic I see you're on Arch linux. Please see here for more information and the solution:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/65009-i-think-i-found-a-bug-in-transcoding-when-resuming/\nThanks !. Resolved for emby server 3.6. Thanks.. Hi there, can you please try Emby Server 4.0? Thanks.. That could take a little while. I would just give it some time. Thanks.. This won't happen. You identify the series, then all you have to do is make sure the episodes have season and episode numbers. If you want your video file to be a different episode than what's on tvdb, then just rename to a new episode number.. Curious of the use case. What kind of things would you plan to comment on?. The reason I'm asking is because if this is something that you could do with tags instead, then that be more powerful because you can filter based on tags to find other titles of the same criteria. And I would expect that tags will be incorporated into search in the future, as well as being able to see lists of tags.. Resolved in latest beta. Thanks guys.. Hi, what user are you trying to login with? The local server credentials, or your Emby Connect user?. What version of Emby Server?. Thanks for the feedback.. This is resolved in our beta packages and will also be included in the upcoming 3.6 stable. Thanks guys.. Hi, can you provide a link for reference? Thanks !. Do they have an API? How popular is it?. Server log?. And also do you have libskiasharp installed on your system, and what version?. The beta channel has rolled back to skiasharp 1.60.0, so that's the version you'll need to have on your system.. Did you have a chance to try this?\n. This should help you get squared away:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/66507-small-problem-with-skia-sharp-on-arch-linux/\nThanks.. No it shouldn't. This is the user's configuration object, not the actual results. You would use the regular library browsing api to get results.. It's slightly wider in 4.0, although I still have not gotten to a mouseover tooltip yet.. Instructions are on our website:\nhttps://emby.media/download\nIf there are betas available on your platform, the instructions will be on the page for it. Thanks.. The Synology beta is a closed beta process.  To join you'll have to announce your intention to volunteer for testing in the Synology section of the Emby Community. Thanks.. Hi, on what screen?. Did you set this up as a TV library?. Thanks. I see the problem. I'm putting in a fix to resolve this in the upcoming 3.6 release. Thanks !. Hi, does this still happen?. Hi, does this still happen?. Ok this is actually bad data coming from Omdb. What I would suggest is making sure that MovieDb is your highest priority metadata provider for each of your Movie libraries.. What is the Imdb Id?. Ok i tested movie4, and yes i can reproduce but this is a bit of a special case.\nLooking up that Imdb Id on Moviedb returns zero results. So then we go to the next movie provider which is Omdb, and it sends back the #DUPE# result. I could have Emby check for #DUPE#, and then treat that the same as no data found, this way you don't end up with junk data in your display.\nI think what has happened is the real Imdb Id has changed, and you need to update your nfo with the new value.. I've pushed Omdb 1.0.4 to resolve this, thanks.. Hi, this is resolved for the upcoming 4.0 release. Thanks !. Hi, what version is this? Is any emby server log generated? Thanks.. Anything?. What model RPI?. is this the one that you have?\nhttps://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-1-model-b-plus/. Hi, is this with the web app?. Can you please attach the emby server log, and ffmpeg log if there was one? Thanks !. Actually it's not a problem on most linux platforms, only arch linux. On other linux platforms we have already bundled our own ffmpeg. It is only with arch linux that we've been using your system version.\nGoing forward with 3.6 we'll be shipping our own. For now, he is correct, simply downgrade to ffmpeg 4.0.2. Thanks.. Hi, yes i agree we should improve this. thanks.. Hi, we have ready built aarch64 packages in beta:\nhttps://emby.media/linux-server.html\nPlease let us know if this helps. Thanks !. Hi, what exactly do you mean by \"don't work\"? Thanks.. Before we can proceed further, we'll need support from .NET Core to run on musl:\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/docs/issues/5731\nThanks.. Hi, thanks for the report. I'm closing this as a duplicate of #3399 Hebrew Subtitles - Weird behaviour in multiple devices. When working on this, we'll utilize the information from both tickets. Thanks !. Hi, can you by chance show a screenshot or image of one of these? I have seen this reported before but  haven't reproduced myself. I think it is something that is only observed under certain conditions. Thanks !. This is resolved for the next updates to both of these apps. Thanks.. Hi, you'll need to roll back your system installed ffmpeg to 4.0.2. 4.1 is not yet supported. Thanks.. Hi there, please attach the information requested in how to report a media playback issue:\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/739-how-to-report-a-problem/\nThanks !. Can you please attach the information anyway so that I can try and help you? There is no way that library monitor errors are going to interfere with playback. Thanks !. Hi, if you were to add a new movie, would this happen?. When you add a new movie, does it include a pre-existing nfo that emby reads?. Deleting the nfo will not delete information from the database. Instead of doing that, try using Identify feature.. If your server only has one user, and if that user does not have a password, then there is no sign out and you're always automatically logged in.\nTry giving your user a password, or adding a second user.. Ok, the problem here is that there is some confusion over local login vs Emby Connect. Yes I would suggest assigning a password to your local Emby user from within your server dashboard.\nThe Emby Connect feature is something that you would use away from home to make remote access easier, and it has it's own password.. Hi, we already do this in response to any user action. Anytime you do something manually in the video player, it gets reported to the server immediately. We would need to look at a more specific example. Thanks !. Hi there, how does the latest version of the app compare?. Hi, try updating the anime plugin.. Ok unfortunately you'll need to remove the anime plugin or not use auto-organize for now. The anime plugin is a community maintained plugin and I just don't know enough about it to be able to give you a better answer. Thanks.. Closing as this is plugin related. Thanks.. We will add the ffmpeg source to our distributions. Thanks.. We will get this added to our distributed packages. Please just give us a little bit of time. Thanks.. If you need it immediately you can get it from our arch linux package:\nhttps://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/emby-server/\nJust click source files, then open the PkgBuild.\nHaving said that, what problem are you trying to resolve? The server is designed to work both with and without our modified ffmpeg builds. There might be some features missing with a vanilla build, but nothing should break.. Right, we haven't gotten to 4.1 yet. I should clarify what i meant by vanilla ffmpeg - you should at least make sure to match the version we're shipping. Anything else you can assume is untested. Thanks.. Starting with beta 4.1.0.10, the licenses file contains a link to the ffmpeg source code that was used to build it. As previously mentioned, this is already in the arch linux stable package. Thanks.. Please let me know if this is resolved in 4.1.0.2. Thanks !. Please attach a new log file. Thanks.. Hi there, are you still seeing this?. Closing due to abandonment, but please feel free to re-open with the requested information. Thanks.. Hi there, thanks for the info. Can you provide a sample video that I can test and confirm this with? Thanks !. i grabbed one of those big buck bunny files but didn't have any problems.. I even tried the test of renaming an avi to mp4, and after it was probed it was successfully detected as an avi container.. Hi, this will be available in the next update to the app. Thanks !. Hopefully in the next few weeks. It will be whenever it gets through the LG review process. Thanks.. Hi, is it still setup with the Books content type? There is now a dedicated audio books content type. You will need to remove the books library, run a scan, and then add it back as audio books. Please let me know if this resolves it for you. Thanks.. Hi there, can you please attach the emby server and ffmpeg logs? Thanks !. How did you install Emby Server? Please make sure you are using our official docker package:\nhttps://emby.media/docker-server.html\nThanks.. Ok, that docker will need to go back to ffmpeg 4.0.2. Thanks.. Did you install drivers into the container?. Can you attach an emby server log, hardware detect log, and ffmpeg log example? Thanks.. I  only see a hardware detect log. can you also attach the emby server log and an ffmpeg log example? Thanks !. And the ffmpeg log?. Please attach the complete ffmpeg log. thanks.. I really have no idea. I will need more information in order to provide additional insight. Thanks.. Closing, but please feel free to re-open with the requested information. Thanks.. Right, we don't have native support for this, I would just mount it in the OS as a local path, then add that to Emby. Does this help?. Curious, why keep the subtitle file out of order? You're kind of asking for trouble there because we feed the subtitles directly to the video player, and if the video player doesn't support this then it will not work.\nYour suggest of re-ordering, I suppose that makes sense, but that means we have to start processing user subtitle files now. There is a strong chance that it will just end up creating new problems.. For what it's worth, i just tested this in Vlc and i can't even get those subs to show up, and Vlc usually handles everything.. I'm going to close this as I don't think we'll be adding workarounds for this. Thanks.. Can you provide a copy of the avi file for testing? thanks !. Got it, thanks.. Resolved for next release, thanks !. Hi, it isn't that it's broken, it's that playlists and collections can be created by anyone and therefore have their own rules. This is something we'll be revamping in a future update to make it more transparent and configurable. Thanks.. Thanks for reporting. This is a Chrome requirement starting with Chrome 72. You either need to be running the web app on https or localhost. You can also use our android or iOS mobile apps. I'm going to close this as this is out of our control. Thanks.. Hi, what router do you have? Our port mapping feature is not guaranteed to work with all router models, but you can always manually configure your router. Have you tried that? Can you please attach an emby server log? thanks.. Hi, that log is coming up not found. Can you please attach it to here? thanks !. Hi, Emby is using it's own ffmpeg. Have you updated to Emby Server 4.0.2?. Hi, actually it has always been this way. We have never really had automatic retries. This is something I attempted to do a long time ago, like 4-5 years ago, but push back was really hard as users were constantly complaining of slow library scans due to repeated attempts to contact external metadata providers.. Hi, can you describe in more detail what you mean? if you can't get them onto the same screen together, then you'd just have to add them one at a time.. That never existed, at least not intentionally. Once you change the search value and the search results change, your previous multi-selections are gone. If it used to be different it was by accident.. This is a little bit messy. The model object should be kept clean and have only the strongly typed dictionary. Leave the parsing up at the api level. I don't even think you need that anyway though, just a Dictionary property.\n. Better but still a bit quirky to have a property suffixed with Dictionary. Can that be removed?\nWhat you have now is going to create complicated post query strings that will be difficult to debug. Make the request object property a Dictionary as well, then switch the client-side post to use a json post body.  See updateServerConfiguration for an example.\n. This is fine. I can add this independent of this pull request.\n. This is going to negatively impact apps that are looking for ChannelFolderItem in order to apply special considerations. While I would like to remove this, at the moment I don't really want to be dragged into all of the app work that this is going to require.\n. We generally try to avoid fixed font sizes, and instead just let the sizes flow from the top of the document down.\n. Is this a filter? \n. Right, I see, because without that list we don't know what to import, right?\n. ",
    "xzener": "I was never able to duplicate this one.\n. Doesn't the Server already do this?? I have added a few movies (a couple builds back), the Server seemed to notice the new media right away... Even before the movie was done backing up. \n. I just edited a trailer poster via PS, saved as \"folder_on\". Went to the server/data/trailers folder, changed the folder.jpg to \"folder_off\" and changed folder_on to folder (the entire time watching the server window update changes made) Opened up MBT, went to the trailers VF... The image has been updated without a server restart.\nLuke, is anything else needed to verify this bug is fixed??\n. Ebr, This is working for me. Good job guys. Keep up the great work.\n. I am not experiencing this either... Very odd.\nEDIT: What build of MBT is this occurring on??\n. I just installed the latest and greatest, still working ok for me.\n. By the way, did we get rid of the gold supporter medal?? \n. Sorry I didn't get the info to you Ebr... Had to run to Reno, family emergency.\n. Awesome! Nice job Ebr.\n. I still don't see that a password exists. Using Server v3.0.4836.22365. I have to enter a password to enter the profile, but looking at the \"User Profile/Password\" tab... \"Current password\" is blank.\n. Right, but \"Current Password\" is blank. Is this by design, the current password is needed to type a new password??\n. Maybe we could add a (Password protected) or something similar next to the user on the profile selection screen? Just a suggestion. \n. This is working as designed. Well done Luke!\n. Of course, but I'm trying to find an OS I'm happy with... Can't go wrong with W7. Server 2012 was overkill, and not compatible with Home Group?!?! What the heck were they thinking?? I'm still pondering WHS, but it not being a supported OS has me thinking otherwise.\n. I will do some testing tonight and report back. Ebr, did you see anything in the logs that was questionable?\n. I just registered my copy of W7 Pro on my Dell 2950. I am still receiving the above error.\n. As soon as the installer is \"Creating shortcuts\", the popup appears. Hope this helps.\n\n. That is strange. A matter of fact, I attempted to uninstall last night... MB3 doesn't exist in the list of programs?!?! This is Windows 7 Professional 64bit, The only thing different is multiple CPUs and a butt load of RAM?? \n.  Is this something I need to do on my end??\n. It looks as though its there... But is the value set incorrectly?? \n\nHere is my Add/Remove Programs list. As you can see, MB3-Server isn't listed.\n\n. Ebr, Sorry... Busy with work and school. I just looked, there is no \"uninstall\" folder in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion folder. Please advise me on what to try next.\n. That would be great. I'm guessing this wouldn't be a wide spread problem... Not sure of anyone else running a server like mine dedicated to MB3. I literally have the bare minimum installed on this machine.\n\n. I accidentally installed MBT just now. It seems to have created the \"uninstall\" folder. Not sure if you put that there too. Just installed the server, still not being listed in the \"uninstall or change a program\" window, nor is it listed in the \"uninstall\" folder in Regedit.\n. Although, I didn't receive the popup?!?!\n. Yes, I DL a new Setup.exe every time I upgrade either program. I will keep an eye on this the next couple of builds and report back.\n. Did not receive the popup with v3.0.4845.30885. Media Browser Server is now listed in the \"Uninstall or Change Program\" menu. Thanks for the help Ebr, hopefully we dodged a bullet or two. \n. Ebr,\nI downloaded and put the file outside of the mediabrowser-server folder. I put in in my \"c:/users/username/\" in a folder named temp. \nI then typed \"c:/users/username/temp/MediaBrowser.Installer product=server class=Beta version=3.0.4843\" and pressed enter...\nThe installer window pops up but does nothing.\nAm I doing something wrong??\n. Ebr,\nI get the UAC popup about the system wanting to run the \"MediaBrowser.Installer.exe\" I click yes, then I get the installer window, but the progress bar doesn't scroll...\n\n. This seems to be working properly for me. I will allow Skynet600 to comment and close.\nEDIT Spoke too soon. It doesn't see my Android client currently playing a DVD ISO. \n. Server (User) view is working for me, Physical still not working as Skynet600 posted.\n. Still only a blank screen when no plugins are installed. Using Server v3.0.4844.17703.\n. Skynet, you can close the bug now.\n. Why would it have to be mobile friendly?? It seems as though most mobile websites have its own \"tailored down\" view than its desktop version... Maybe it could just be active in desktop. \n. Sorry I didn't give much input to my request Luke, School has me busy (Finals)... But the outcome is better than I had imagined. Beautiful job!! \n. Wrong thread.\n. Wrong thread.\n. Seems as though my permissions were set \"read only\" on the FlexRAID drive... Full permission was set to the folder only. This is invalid. \n. If the fix was in the newest Dev server update, this is still broken...\n\n. Force refresh does not resolve the \"0\" bit rate. \n. I confirm, this issue has been resolved. Well done Luke, thanks.\n.

This doesn't have anything to do with CA.  It is the server freaking out on a restart.\n. Still occurs in 4818.26322\n. If you read the referenced discussion you'll see the issue :).  It depends on what you are ripping and how you are doing it.  The issue is that it is sometimes recognized too quickly - before whatever is needed to identify that it is a movie.  In that case, you end up with it resolving as a folder and nothing that happens after that short of re-scanning or restarting picks it back up as an actual movie instead of a plain folder with sub folders.\nRight now, this can be avoided by lengthening the amount of time we wait between changes to the file system but, as Luke points out in the other discussion, this is just a hit or miss/get lucky way of solving the issue.  It would be nice if we could be a little better about properly identifying things during the rip process.\nThis isn't a huge issue as it mainly only affects folder rips which, I don't think a lot of people other than me do.  Also, it can be addressed by the individual by fine tuning the file system watch delay to their liking.  I just want to keep this open to see if we can do anything else about it.\n. For now, we can just plan to educate people on the adjustment of the delay if it becomes a problem.  We have bigger fish to fry...\n. Actually, since it is a part of the installer, you could test it now by un-installing your current server and then re-installing it via the download link (won't work if you unzip from dropbox).\nHowever, the current uninstaller doesn't know about it so, if you un-install via \"Programs and Features\" it won't remove the entry yet.  That will work after the next server release.\n. Those methods of uninstalling are dead with the next version.  You will uninstall via Programs and Features.  Did the new installer give you the uninstall option in \"Programs and Features\"?\nYou cannot simply run the uninstaller manually as it has to be told what to uninstall.  Well, you can but you have to provide it with command line parameters.\n. Okay.  With the next server release, it should actually work properly.\n. I was writing to the wrong hive (causing the security problem).  A new installer is up that shouldn't cause that issue.\n. This has not been completely tested yet...\n. Excellent.  Thx.\n. 1) Was the server running at the time you attempted the uninstall?  If so, this is probably the same thing we pointed out before - we're not shutting down all our child processes when we stop.\n2) Or, did you happen to have a windows explorer window or something else open in that particular folder?\n. Can you make it happen again?  And, if so, can you look in task manager to see what could be holding a lock on that folder?\n. Okay, have part of this done.  Need a nuget update to be able to put in MBT.\n. I implemented this method but two points:\n1) It is only being called at application startup which doesn't seem right.  Seems like it just needs to be called whenever the option changes.\n2) Even so, it isn't working and I'm wondering if maybe the configuration isn't loaded at the time it is being called...?\n. This is still broken in 4821.13276\n. This works for me now.  Can anyone else confirm?\n. More work to be done on this...\n. I have verified in my installation that this now works.  It will cause a complete re-load of your music metadata since it needs to re-process the bio information.\nTesters please verify with next server release.  Thx.\n. That's not your final formatting, right?\n. Why not supply the plain overview if there is no html so that each client doesn't have to have logic to handle that situation?\n. Well, that's what I was afraid of.  It didn't give me that problem though.  Maybe because I have UAC turned off...?\n. Okay, @abobader try this:\n1) Uninstall using the Programs and features item.  It should uninstall the server but it won't take the item out of Programs and features so\n2) Double click it again and Windows should tell you its already gone and ask if you want to remove the item.  Say yes.\n3) Now try installing via the link again.\nI've put up a new installer that should fix this.\n. I found that earlier today.  If you uninstall with the server running and a library scan or anything ffprobe-related was running at the time or recently, the process is still going and causes that problem.\nI think this should probably be a new bug related to server shutdown.  We need to be sure we kill off all our spawned processes when we shut down.\n. I never saw @abobader actually confirm this security bug was fixed...\n. That's what I thought.  Thx. Abo.\n. Is this security error fixed now?\n. That looks kind of like the Pismo install hung...\n. C'mon guys, it takes less than 5 seconds to properly update the labels on these things when you close them...\n. Can someone confirm that attempting to run the uninstaller directly tells you not to do that please?\n. Yes, please.\n. Because all plug-ins need to re-run their validation routines.\n. I think a better approach would be to define an IRequiresValidation interface that can be called whenever it needs to happen but that will take a bit of re-working a few things.  Since this was basically a one-time thing, I just didn't spend much time on it.\n. This should no longer happen after the next server update.\n. Can I get a confirmation on this with current server version please?  I will put up a new version of CA that will re-validate any time the key is entered/removed.\n. Go to the supporter key part of the Help page in the dashboard and delete your supporter key and save.  You should then be able to go to the plugin catalog or to the CA config app and it will tell you CA is not registered/expired.\nThen go back and put your supporter key back in and then go back to CA and it should say you are registered.\nAll this should work without needing to re-start the server.\n. Thx.\n. Please try re-installing right over top of what you have now and see if it seems to hang at the end again.  If it does, make sure there isn't a window hidden behind something that is asking for admin privileges or something...\n. Thx.\n. I assume this was completed...\n. Hmmm.. @abobader did you update twice?  It seems like that admin stuff has to be caused by the new Pismo install but that should only have happened if you actually updated twice.\n. I know there have been all kinds of other issues with the in-place update but no one is getting an admin prompt on an update from the dashboard anymore, right?\n. Dashboard.\n. Sorry, your first version was still too old.  The update from the dashboard isn't going to work until 4821+.\nYou will need to delete the mbserver.zip file in the update folder and then install 4821 from the normal setup.  Then, on the next update, you should be able to use the dashboard.\n. 4820 is from yesterday.  You updated this morning but were still running yesterday's code.  As I said in the ticket for this particular issue (#52) it is going to take two update cycles to get the dashboard update working because we have to update the update logic first.\n. Your second error is an ISP problem.  You should be able to just run it again.\n. Pismo will be installed every time you run the setup program.  This ticket pertains to only the dashboard update.  In the real world, people should only ever run the setup program from the web once.  From then on out they should be using the dashboard.\n. @abobader I just implemented some retry logic on the download in the installers.  Let's see if maybe that helps you out at all with some of these issues.\n. No, this issue does not affect running setup from the web link.\n. Okay, that's a separate issue from this so I'm going to close.  It looks like the pismo install is hanging...\n. No, we need to figure out how get them all shut down properly with us.  But first, we have to figure out exactly what they all are.\n. If you can make the uninstaller tell you it can't delete something again, then find in task manager what is holding the files open.\n. This is solved isn't it?\n. I think maybe other changes have addressed it then because I don't think anyone has had this issue in months.  We can probably safely close it unless it crops back up.\n. Abo, you should be able to start your server by deleting the MBServer.zip file that is probably in the Updates folder.\n. No.  There shouldn't be anything in the update folder in our deployment packages.  I'm assuming he ran (or it ran automatically) the update task and it brought down the new version.\n. Don't use the update task, it is not going to work.  Just run the installer from the web link.\n. Okay, I think I have this licked but it will take two update cycles to test it since the updated update components won't be in place until the next update... confused yet... ;)\n. Starting with the next available update, you should be able to use the Dashboard to accomplish it.\n. I think I saw @abobader say this worked...\n. Did you manually delete the start menu folder or just allow the un-installer to do it?\n. Okay, so you manually deleted the link for MBT and the entire \"Media Browser 3\" folder in your start menu and now the setup doesn't put it back when you re-install from the web link?\n. Okay, can you manually inspect the start menu folders for both your current user account and \"all users\" and see if there is a \"Media browser 3\" folder in either one?\n(Right click \"All Programs\" and select \"Open\" and \"Open all users\")\n. Okay, and when you install either product, you don't get a shortcut in the start menu for either one?\n. Yes, I believe this can be closed\n. What are we going to do about this?  Ideas on how we should handle it?\n. I can look at it.\nWhat if we attack it from the other angle and make sure we never persist a virtual folder...?\n. Ok I've checked in the non persistence of BasePluginFolders.  One side effect will be a log message that we are adding the virtual folders in on every library scan but that is harmless.  We'll see if this solves the issue or if we have to take a more radical approach.\n. Actually, now that I've done this, I'm not sure I understand what the problem was in the first place so maybe this isn't going to help.\nNon-cached children is compared with the cached children based on ID so these items will be matched up and not duplicated anyway.  So, I guess I don't really understand what this issue is.\n. Yeah, but I can't see why that would be the case since that method above is just returning a reference to the physical root's virtual children...  I'll investigate more.\n. I think we're looking in the wrong place.  This phenomenon is not constrained to plug-in folders. All top-level folders for each user appear to be new instances.  It is probably the creation of collection folders we need to be looking at.\n. Yep - here is the actual issue:\n```\n    protected override Folder Resolve(ItemResolveArgs args)\n    {\n        if (args.IsDirectory)\n        {\n            if (args.IsPhysicalRoot)\n            {\n                return new AggregateFolder();\n            }\n            if (args.IsRoot)\n            {\n                return new UserRootFolder();  //if we got here and still a root - must be user root\n            }\n            if (args.IsVf)\n            {\n                return new CollectionFolder();\n            }\n        return new Folder();\n    }\n\n```\nThis could get a little tricky.  I'll have to look at it tomorrow. \n. Been banging my head against this one all day and haven't figured out why this is happening yet but I did discover something else I don't think we should be doing...\nWhen validating the library, we run through validation for not only the physical root but also for each individual user.  With the exception of the user roots themselves, the user \"libraries\" are nothing but references back to the physical library - which we just validated.  Why are we traversing it again for each user?\n. Okay.  Seems like this is going to cause the potential concurrency issues as - even if we get the single instance thing worked out (which I think I just have) - repeating this validation on each user is going to potentially cause the same items to be validating simultaneously.\n. It was just the waste that I was initially looking at.  Couldn't figure out why it would be needed.  My check in has it commented out (mostly because I just forgot to uncomment it) so we'll see if there are any side-effects with it missing.\nI have checked in an approach to dealing with this mult-instance issue.  We should monitor it to see if it has any adverse side-effects of its own.\n. This has to do with a bug in MB2.  Basically, the MB2 series provider is saving actors in an element tag that duplicates one that is possibly already there.\nI fixed this problem in the provider for MB3 so, you should be able to just delete the series.xml and let mb3 re-create it.\n. Of course, I've saved locally from the beginning but that's just me.  It would be nice if more folks did try out the internal providers and saving.\n. CBers, please confirm if deleting the xml file and allowing MB3 to recreate it (make sure MB2 doesn't beat us to it) solves this problem.\n. Yes, running the scan should do it or you can just refresh that one series from the Library Explorer.\n. Did you delete the xml file with the server running?  That should have picked it up automatically.\n. CBers - looks like those items are no longer resolving as TV series.  Do they contain seasons?\nIf you look at them in the lib explorer, what does it say they are?\n. No, please let us know what is going on here.  There may be a bug we need to address.  What are the answers to my questions above?\n. Okay, I do that all the time.  Just create a sub folder called \"Season 1\" and then create an empty file in there called s01e01.avi and then all the meta should load in properly.\n. You are going to have to re-scan the library or re-start the server because those items are folders and nothing you do to them while the server is running is going to make them ever be anything but just plain folders.  They have to be re-discovered as TV after you altered them to contain the things that make them TV.\n. A library scan would have done it too.\n. This is the same thing as previously reported.  The series \"Zero Hour\" has an MB2-generated series.xml in it.\nThe log is not as easy to decipher as with MB2.  MB3 is massively parallel so messages are interspersed with one another.  The trailer activity you are seeing is unrelated to the error.\n. Going to re-open this and see if there is anything we can do to be compatible with the malformed MB2 xml.\n. That's what I said in my first post about this :), except it is actually MB2 that is saving the duplicate actor node.\nMCM should not be a problem and this should only be a problem in MB2-generated Series.xml.\n. I'm pretty sure the Series.xml files that are causing this problem were created by the MB2 fetchers.  Unless someone else has the exact same bug we did.\n. Yeah, I there really isn't any harm here I don't think.\n. Yes, the email has a MB3 logo in it and then some text and the key.  Apparently an email with an image and less than 800 characters of text is a signature for spam.\n. I've lowered the SpamAssasin score on our emails to 2.9.  That should take care of this.\n. I really think we need to have the ability to edit this sort order on the library definition screen itself.  We field about a question a day on this because it is not intuitive that you would have to go the route that you do now.\n. Here ya go.\n. FYI I was playing around with the android app and noticed some covers didn't come over treated.\n. Yeah, give me just a minute.  Interestingly, I just made it happen again and I'm getting errors in the log with no detail which is also new...\n. Here are the same errors with the http logging.\n. FYI it does appear to only happen during the client requests as I ran the full image enhance task and got no errors.\n. I have not seen this happen in several releases.\n. Here is the actual error:\nCould not load file or assembly 'MediaBrowser.Controller, Version=3.0.4815.276, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null' or one of its dependencies.\nIs it possible we've left something out of the deployment package that is loaded in memory while the installer is running but not when we run MBT directly...?\n. Then what on earth is going wrong with CBers installs?\nCBers, exactly how are you installing?  You should not be downloading anything and re running it.  You should always be running the setup directly from the web link.\n. To clarify again the install process.  When you click on the link to \"setup.exe\" you need to \"RUN\" that program, not download and save it somewhere to run over and over again.  The next time you want to install, you need to go to the web link and run setup.exe again (let the browser re-download and re-run it from the temporary location).\nBasically, you need to be sure you are always re-downloading the \"setup.exe\" program.\n. When you click on a link in a browser that is an executable file, you get the option of either saving it or running it.  I'm saying to run it.  This is in IE.  In chrome, it downloads it automatically and then shows it on the bottom bar where, if you then click on it, it will run.\nThis is what needs to be done each time if you are installing outside of the dashboard because yes the setup.exe does change.  That file is not even our setup program.  It is the ClickOnce pre-requisite installer.\nSo, you need to treat our installation just like you do Chrome (they use the same technology).  You always click on the link in the browser, let it download and run that exact copy of the setup program.  Do NOT save that setup program somewhere for future use as it is transient.\nSorry if all this is confusing.  I'm probably making it sound harder than it really is.  Basically always click the link and re-download/run the setup.exe every time you install.  That's all.\n. Not via the dashboard, but via MBT itself will be coming.\n. If we have a direct url to the video, why do we need the page parser?  For instance, if we have the following url as our video path, can't we just stream it directly?\nhttp://www.youtube.com/v/7AW9C3-qWug?version=3&f=standard&d=AWlMbZDaYaUQIOZQnJ7NNp0O88HsQjpE1a8d1GxQnGDm&app=youtube_gdata\n. When you get a chance, shoot me a note on how it's done.  Thx.\n. Ok, thx.  I don't think we should attempt to directly stream YouTube.  Most of the examples I found have been abandoned because it is a maintenance nightmare and it is technically illegal so I'd like to keep that out of the product.\n. Luke will have to confirm but it is probably a bug in the API.  I see lots of exceptions in there.\nWe're very busy working on a lot of different things but we won't lose track of you.  Thanks.\n. I have a few jpgs created by WMP or maybe WMC in my music folders.  They are:\nAlbumArt_{guid}large\nAlbumArt{guid}_small\nAlbumArtSmall\nI'm not sure who created which ones but the \"small\" versions are only 75 by 75 so not really usable.  The large one is 200x200.\n. Nice.  So WMP does write to folder.jpg too?\n. Make that happen in chrome and then hit ctl-shift-j and post what is in the window below.\n. Never mind, I found it.  This page wasn't modified for the elimination of a function in the api client.\n. No worries.  Hope everything is okay...\n. Can I get a confirmation from anyone that this is fixed?  Thx.\n. What if we kept the same architecture we have now but create a separate UIPlugin folder on the server?  This would keep everything centralized through the server as far as installations and updates.\n. I think keeping the centralized management outweighs the other potential issues because the majority of cases will not need different plug-ins installed on different versions of MBT.\nHandling the updates and installation via MBT means that a user would have to go to two different places to install and register things.  Centralized management is one of our selling points and this would break that model. \n. No, that shouldn't be a problem.  The other piece that still needs to be addressed though is hybrid plug-ins.  We want the user to be able to install one item and have it put both pieces in place so we may have to have a third designation.\n. Exactly, Red.\n. If we have all of that other integration, then, yeah, I agree. But all of that other integration is going to take a while.\nI don't think there is a perfect answer here in the short term. As, with hybrid plug-ins the user would have to install two components in two different places.  If we have the intelligence you described above, we could help that out but, again, that's a lot to build.\nIn short, I think that would be a better system but when do we draw a line and get something out the door?\n. I understand but I have a lot on my plate this included.  I also know I am a bottle neck here because I don't always have the amount of time I would like.\nThis weekend is Easter and I have my kids.  I won't have much time to work at all until the middle of next week.  I'll look at what we can do here then and see how we might be able to put just what we need for the server in place.\n. The back end of this is done.  The dashboard catalog needs to be updated now.\n. I don't agree.  Our server should not fail because a plug-in developer makes an error.  From the user's perspective this is way too harsh a consequence.  They cannot use the system and have no idea why.  They are likely to just think we are crap and move on.\n. How can we be sure of that?  Basically, all that needs to happen is a plug-in dev accidentally publishes a bad version and now everyone in the world can't use MB until they un-install this plug-in?\nI think the first time that happens the community will scream for it to be fixed.\n. Okay, that's reasonable for this particular issue.  I would like us to strive for the impossibility of a plug-in bringing down our whole system in any case we can, though.\n. Okay, next version will ignore thumbs.db, albumart.jpg and anything ending in small.jpg.\n. Did this change get removed or did I miss something the first time?  Log from current dev build:\n2013-07-10 15:17:47.3861, Debug, DirectoryWatchers, \\MEDIASERVER\\Movies\\HD\\Ice Age 3 - Dawn of the Dinosaurs\\Thumbs.db is locked.\n2013-07-10 15:17:47.3891, Info, DirectoryWatchers, Timer extended.\n2013-07-10 15:17:55.4160, Debug, DirectoryWatchers, \\MEDIASERVER\\Movies\\HD\\Ice Age 3 - Dawn of the Dinosaurs\\Thumbs.db is locked.\n2013-07-10 15:17:55.4190, Info, DirectoryWatchers, Timer extended.\n2013-07-10 15:18:03.4464, Debug, DirectoryWatchers, \\MEDIASERVER\\Movies\\HD\\Ice Age 3 - Dawn of the Dinosaurs\\Thumbs.db is locked.\n2013-07-10 15:18:03.4464, Info, DirectoryWatchers, Timer extended.\n. I'd call it a quirk.  The app has a hidden window.\nNot sure if we can hide it from this interface.\n. Did tmdb change their API again?  It was necessary to make the separate calls in order to get all of the info we needed.  They re-worked this in v3 of the API.  It creates multiple requests but individual payloads are lighter which is what they were going for.\nAs for the box sets, they have changed the way that works a couple of times.  We used to be able to get full movie data back for a box set but they changed it so that it only returns a sub-set of it.  It is (or was anyway) a subset, though so the same result object should still work.\n. According to the current documentation, it doesn't look like this has changed.  With your changes, we will no longer get country-based release and rating information, images or any cast info.  Is all this somehow working for you?\n. > Also, the value is a class level value in highly concurrent system - it's my understanding there's only one instance of the class. I'm making that variable a local variable once I get the chance.\nTo what variable are you referring here?  Results are deserialized into instances of the class in question that are local to the executing method.  There should be no concurrency issue here.\n. > The only thing in common between movie and collection right now, is \"id\", \"backdrop_path\" and \"poster_path\". \nAnd, unfortunately, that is about the only data that is returned for collections right now...\n. The release info result is searched for the specified country.  This is how we get proper ratings and release dates for the user's country.\nYou are getting full image and cast info from the single call?  This is not how it is documented to work in v3.  It is how it used to work in v2.\n. I see now you are talking about the ItemType variable.  Yes, this is a problem.  That is a vestage from MB2 where each item had its own instance of the provider.\n. For boxsets, we could do them separately now.  They were combined because, when they first implemented the collection data, it returned the exact same information as a movie.  This was nice because we got genres etc.  Then they \"fixed\" a bug and we now have a separate call and very limited data for boxsets (what they call collections).  I put in a request almost a year ago to have that data expanded but it hasn't happened.\n. > The feature I'm using in TMDb is the \"append_to_response\" which allows you to take any of the other sub-requests (releases, casts ..) and add them to the current request. I just add all the pieces we need :)\nAh, I see.  That was the bit that I missed.  Very cool.  Just be sure the object we save is identical to how it was before because the json provider needs to come back and read that.\n\nAppearantly I suck at high-traffic git projects. So I might have done something wrong while getting the upstream changes. I might discard my fork and re-do my changes in a seperate branch.\n\nThe only thing I've found that works reliably right now is Tortoise Git.  Sucky interface but seems to not stuff up the repo like Git for Windows does sometimes.  You might also look at SourceTree.\n. One other thing you could look at here would be splitting the images out into a separate provider.  This would allow independent control of the metadata and the images.  For instance, you could retrieve just the meta or just the images if you had the other one locally already.\n. No, I think his changes are okay.  The part I missed was the append_to because github cuts off the source lines with no way to scroll right - so I never even saw that on the request url.  I think that must have been an addition to the API since I re-wrote that provider for MB2 - or, I just missed it back then.\nAnyway, that call reduction should be fine as long as we preserve the saved json format.\n. There is no reason to re-fetch from the net 95% of the time.  The saved json relieves the load on tmdb and makes our re-scan process much faster.  It is integral to the design of the providers.\nWe either need to preserve it in its current format (preferred since we already have a bunch of it out there) or re-write the json provider to properly read whatever the new format is.\n. I really don't think that's a good idea.  It will still slow down our re scans - especially if there is no net connection at the time.  Plus, they limit our hits and concurrent hits.\nThere is no good reason to hit them again when we already have the data locally.  The savings we are getting with the multiple request reduction is only a 1-5% case.  Eliminating our local copy of the data is a 95% case.\n. Just to further explain - Right now, the only time we even touch tmdb is the very first time a movie is added to the file system (assuming save locally is on which it is by default).  This carries forward even to the situation of a clean install on a new machine - as long as the media folders are still there.  Even if the user deletes their cache and library db, we still won't hit tmdb for these items again. So, cutting this request down from four to one is a good thing but only helps us in this one instance of the very first time a movie is discovered. And, the payloads are identical.  The only thing being saved here is the overhead of the multiple requests.\nIf we eliminate our local json and it's provider we are now hitting tmdb on every library scan.  That just doesn't make any sense to me.\nThis data is relatively static.  Once it is there, it is there and doesn't change much.  Our current system is very efficient with this type of data.  I'm for the new request type but we have to make our save locally functionality work too.\n. I'd also love to see you look into pulling the images out into their own provider if you're up for it...\n. If I get time and he doesn't get to it first, I'll see if there is a way to implement his consolidation of calls and still keep our compatibility with the existing saved MBMovie.json.\n. From the log it looked like an initial scan was cancelled for some reason.  Did you start to make modifications to the configuration after the initial wizard ran?\n. Ok, thanks.  I still think we have some issues lurking in the initial scan of brand new installs.  I've always had these types of errors whenever I build from scratch - but haven't done that in a few weeks.\n. I don't think the problem will re-occur unless you clean out your library.db (and maybe your cache) and make everything rebuild from scratch.\n. Uninstall from programs and features and check \"Remove All Traces\"\nUse the web link to the beta server setup.exe that is in the forum build announcement thread (probably the same one you have).\nWhat Microsoft product?\n. Okay, so you replicated the same problem we've seen on initial scans.  If you just keep re-starting the server, it will most likely finish and be okay after a couple tries.  Seems to only happen when there is a whole bunch to process.\nThe message from the programs and features is a compatibility warning.  I need to research how to suppress it.\n. So does that mean that any user who is tied to the default library can modify it?\n. I mean through the User Profile section of the dashboard.  In that context, no user can actually modify the library if the \"Use default\" is checked.\nSo, it seems we should change the header of the \"Media Library\" section to be \"Default Media Library\" since this is what is actually being maintained here.\n. Since it is always the default library, why wouldn't we label it clearly as that to eliminate any possible confusion?\n. I think it will take a while for people to setup multiple profiles and run into this possible confusion.  But I also don't think we need to dynamically change the navigation tabs.  That tab will always be the default library so why not just call it that.\n. > Always? Wait, are you referring to the left navigation? Why don't we just call that \"Default Media Library\"?\nYes.\n. Is there anything else that is special about this machine?\nDo you plan to activate the OS?\n. Yeah, thanks.  I know when it is happening.  Your machine doesn't have the standard registry entry for the uninstall section of Programs and Features - which seems really strange...\n. No, Xzener but please bring up regedit and see if you have the following key defined:\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\n. Since you are getting the error you are, I wouldn't expect MB3 to be in the list.  Since the key is there, it must be some other problem. Perhaps permissions related.  I'll look at it next week.\nOur installer is pretty much portable and the same exact program handles both installations and updates so I don't really want to embed it as an actual installer in the windows sense.\n. Sorry, I pointed you to the wrong place.  We are storing in the current user's hive (to avoid the need for admin).  Please look for the same key in HKEY_CURRENT_USER and see what you find.\n. Where do we stand on this?\n. Okay, so maybe that folder doesn't exist if you've never installed something just for the current user on this machine.  I wonder if I can create it...?\n. Okay, try to install from the web link (be sure you re-download setup.exe) and see if it creates an uninstall entry for you.\n. Yes, I put the same logic in for MBT.  Very strange that it would work for it but not the server.  Are you sure you downloaded a new version of the installer?\n. Excellent.  Thanks for the help.\n. I don't fully understand how this is happening since we wait for our calling process to exit before continuing in the update situation.  Somehow, even though that process reports it has ended, we still find it when we search for it by name in running processes (or, there is another mediabrowser.serverapplication process going).\nI have added a short delay after the first wait for exit and a timeout on the second wait for exit.  Hopefully, this will catch this situation.  In any case, the update process won't hang indefinitely - although, it may still fail if the process is still really running after the timeout.\n. If you ran the update from the Dashboard then you are still running the old version.  It will take two update cycles to get this code in because it is the actual update code...\n. As I stated in my previous comment.  If you did an update today via the dashboard, you still had the old update code.  It will take two updates to get the new code to you.  So, the next update you do via the dashboard will have the new code and, hopefully, no longer have this problem.\n. If you did the update both yesterday afternoon and this morning (twice since my first comment above) then, hopefully, this is resolved - or at least changed behavior.\n. Excellent, thanks.  CBers, you too?\n. Can you tell me exactly what you did and what happened?  Also, how long did you wait with the message up?\n. If you can make it happen again, please let it sit for a minute without canceling it.\n. Yeah, that could be helpful.  We can actually force it to do the update again.  It's possible (via a couple hoops) to install back-versions...\n. Yeah, I think it must be some sort of timing issue but I also really don't know how it can be happening at all based on the logic.\nI think the next pass I'll just try and bypass the check for the running server when we are doing an update as that seems to be what is tripping it up somehow.\n. Xzener or CBers, can you help me test this today since It never happens on my machine?\nYou need to download this  into any temporary folder outside of the mediabrowser-server folder.\nThen bring up a cmd prompt and go to where you downloaded the temporary copy and type:\n\nMediaBrowser.Installer product=server class=Beta version=3.0.4843\n\nThat should install an older version of the server.  \nNext - very important step - You have to copy the temporary version of MediaBrowser.installer.exe back into your system folder since it was just replaced by the update.\nThen you can go to the dashboard and do an update and see how it goes.  You can do these two steps multiple times to see if the issue crops back up.  Thanks.\n. The normal update process is still running the old code.  You will have to go through the steps I outlined above to test the new code.\n. Can you further define \"does nothing\"?  What message is in the window?\n. Okay.  For some reason, you guys can't install the back versions.  Let's just wait for the next two updates then.  Thanks.\n. What happened to this?  It was done but now it appears to be gone.\nAlso that filter button looks like it was just dropped in a random location on the screen...\n. And, the version selection option still shows up for items you can't install - that needs to get hidden as well.\n. I understand that the target system was added to the filter options but it is not obvious at all what you are looking at when you just bring up this screen.  There are a bunch of plug-ins and you don't know what they go to.  As we get more, this will be even more confusing.  The filters will make more sense once I implement the categories on plug-ins.\nI really think they should be grouped by target system or, at least there needs to be an indicator on the tile as to what system they are for.\n. @Techywarrior The version selection is gone for all plugins now...\n. Yeah, it looks better.\nWhenever we have these multiple levels of \"tabs\" though it is not always completely obvious how the selections work and relate to the content.  I wish we had an actual tab control that would make it more obvious.\n. I really think the collapsible groups that @Techywarrior put in initially was a much more straightforward approach.\n. The page could initially come up with only the server ones expanded.  Then we have basically the same display we have now but a little more clear what you are looking at.\n. This looks muy bueno in the latest version.\nCategory is now filled in as well so you can add that to the filter.  Here are the ones I've defined.  Not married to them so feel free to make suggestions:\n<option>General</option>\n                        <option>Content Provider</option>\n                        <option>Theme</option>\n                        <option>Screen Saver</option>\n                        <option>Social Integration</option>\n                        <option>Player Integration</option>\n                        <option>Image Processing</option>\n. You probably have a license from way back on CA and did the upgrade to v3 right?\nIf so, it isn't supposed to show as registered for you right now.  It can only \"see\" the full version 3.0 registrations not the upgrades.  I will probably have it allow those as well but, right now it won't.\n. Web - upgrade CA and see if it comes up registered for you.\n. What is the dashboard-ui folder?\n. Where is this folder?  How is it created?  I don't have one and the update process is completely unaware of it so I'm not sure how it is changing anything - unless it is a sub-folder of \"system\" and then it is probably due to the fact that we remove and re-create that directory during an update (the quickest way to delete all files).\n. Yes, I found it.  It is inside System but it is created by the extraction of the zip file itself so I don't know how we could be affecting any permissions on it.\n. @Techywarrior what kind of machine/OS are you running?  Are your default permissions for the programdata folder not full control for your user account?\n. Xzerner and I discovered yesterday that his user account did not have full-control of the programdata folder.  Once we gave full control of that folder to \"Users\" a lot of his installation woes went away.\nI found a lot of Google hits on this issue and it appears in some instances this is the case.\n. We don't do anything explicitly with permissions.  The user running the update would be whatever user account the server is running under.\nCan you confirm that your \"Users\" group has full control of the C:\\ProgramData folder?\n. It's possible I guess that the ClickOnce installer (that's what setup.exe is) is elevating the current user somehow.\nBut, the bottom line is we are expecting the server to have full-control of the ProgramData folder.  We either need this to be the case or we need to find somewhere else to install to...\n. @Techywarrior I agree but this was an assumption we made - I guess erroneously.  The question now is what to do about it.\nBut, if normal users only have read/list/execute permissions against ProgramData, how does anything we are doing work?  We wouldn't be able to create log files.\nSo, something else is going on here.\n. You mean if not using our music provider?\n. Can you give me an example?  This must mean that Last.fm doesn't have it but we should filter out a 0000.\n. You mean their soundtracks?\n. Okay, I think this is fixed.  This means we will not get any info for these items since we key on mbid.  We weren't getting any usable info anyway.\nA separate enhancement would be to possibly read this id out of tags from one of the songs in the album.  Please enter that as an enhancement.\n. You're right, something borked this recently.\n. As long as we bypass the logic that goes with it.  If there were no window right now, the process would just hang with no way to kill it.\nI'm going to bypass the shutdown logic during an update though because we've already waited on the server to shutdown previously.\nThis would also mean that we'd need some sort of logging capability in the update/installer.  Not a terrible idea in itself.\n. My i7 dev box is consistently about 13 seconds to start the server.\n2013-04-08 09:04:05.7567, Info, App, Loading CoverArt, Version=3.9.3.9, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null\n2013-04-08

The slow start up on a cold boot sounds like we are waiting on either network or hardware resources to initialize although, obviously, that seems awful drastic.\n. > Well on this same machine I do have Plex Server running as well as metaBrowser.  They both start on power-up.  Could there be a conflict between something else and MB3?\nIf its not a huge deal, certainly worth uninstalling or disabling Plex just to find out.\n. Looks like SS is 50-70% of the entire start-up time on my two machines.\n. SS is your problem as well except it is taking 5 Minutes for you...\n. It's not necessarily just you. I test mostly on my dev box and I pretty much never cold start it because I've got so much going at once it is about a 10 minute process to do so.  So I haven't even tested that scenario yet.\nIt definitely sounds like some sort of network resource is hanging up during initialization.\n. Not sure where you are on this Luke but I do think we need to either speed this up or have a splash screen before Monday.  I really think a splash is okay.  Just some immediate feedback so people don't keep clicking on the shortcut.\n. Aha - It's Swagger.  Luke, could we delay that initialization until someone actually asks for the API docs?\n.

Yeah, I would think upping the memory would do a world of good.  2GB barely meets the requirements of any modern OS.  I know that server says it can run on less but that is assuming it is doing nothing but serving files.\nAlso, a faster system drive would help as you are undoubtedly doing a lot of paging.\nHow does it perform once it is up?\n. On my dev box I'm down under 10 seconds on a normal re-start.  The last time I rebooted it still took about a minute.\nOn my production box it is so fast I can barely see the splash page.  < 3 seconds.\n. I'm pretty sure we have localized the slow startup to some 3rd-party components we are using.  We're trying to nail down exactly what and why.\n. I just saw that recent changes require the deletion of all the db files.  I'm guessing this is related.  Rebuilding now and then I'll confirm.\nWe need to stabilize the format of at least the userdata database such that it doesn't require deletion once we go out to a wider audience.\n. Yep, it appears this was related.\n. Was this completed?\n. Yeah, my resolution problems were related to something else which had me go looking at resolver priority and I noticed this so assumed that was the issue.  Turns out it wasn't, but, as you said, we still should adjust this so that it is possible for someone to get in front of us explicitly.\n. I believe a recent commit just implemented this...\n. Yeah, I think this is a bug.  That provider doesn't override NeedsRefresh or CompareDate so it is getting run on every video.  Either it needs to override NeedsRefresh to check if the primary image is null or it should add that check to the Supports method.\n. Yeah, I'm taking the bug label off of this but is there any way we can move the check for the primary image path to the needs refresh process so that it doesn't look like this is being done when it isn't?\n. This isn't to eliminate mapped drives. It is to eliminate the situation where the user sets up his directories as local drive references because he has MB3 server on the actual media server machine.  If they do this everything will appear to work until they try to actually play something from MBT or MBC.  Then it will fail because the Path reference is unreachable from that machine.\nThis situation is not intuitively obvious to the normal user so I think it would be good for us to remove it from the equation.\n. I don't understand.  There is no choice in this instance.  It simply won't work if they use a local drive reference...\n. And, mapped drives, actually will be an even bigger problem for us than it is for MB2.  In MB2 it is a problem because Windows likes to disconnect mapped drives after periods of inactivity and they aren't always re-connected at startup which causes all kinds of pain for us.\nIn MB3 we could have the same issue with mapped drives that we do with local ones.  If all the locations aren't mapped to exactly the same drive letters on all machines it won't work and it won't be obvious why.\nTranslating everything to UNC will solve all these issues and not remove any power from the user.\n. > That depends on what client they use. I plan to have mbt stream when the file is not available. (It'll have to stream anyway in order to handle the youtube plugin).\nSo, what will happen is some user will ask why the quality sucks on his videos and he can't get any 5.1 audio or they'll just give up because it sucks and it will be because they set it up with local drives.  But there won't really be any way for them to know this.\n. What, exactly, is the harm?  I've laid out several benefits to doing this.\nBasically, I'm saying let the user pick his directories how ever he wants to.  If they want to point to them with the local drive (because that's what they'll do because, if they're on the same machine that's what it will look like they should do) then fine.  We just translate that directory they chose to a universally acceptable reference.\nWe haven't removed any control or options from them at all.  We've taken their choice and stored it internally in a way we are sure will work in all instances.\nWhere is the harm in that?\n. So display a message telling them we translated it.  And, if it can't be translated, tell them that too.\nWhat I'm suggesting makes the process much easier for the normal user.\n. What if instead of translating them behind the scenes, we simply eliminated the option of using the local drive letters and always force them to go through the network paths?  \nUsing the network paths is what we will want them to do anyway, it shouldn't make any difference even if the content is local to the machine and it will eliminate all confusion...\n. conversion would be for the people who don't even know what a UNC path is - they would select the drive but we would change it to UNC.\nHowever, I'm sure this won't be as easy as it sounds so anything we can do to educate and have the users make the proper choice up front would be good.\nI also will be looking at static streaming in MBC soon but that will still not be the optimal solution.\n. I still think it would be very useful but I'm sure it won't be a simple as it may seem because of the network setup issues.  So, I'm not going to take time out to do anything with it right now.\nIf Luis would like to look at some possibilities, that would be great.\n. It's probably not perfect but I believe we are supplying a culture in the few instances where it is needed (the formatting   of the rating value which is a decimal is one I know of).\nIn the other places, I think, we have to assume the current culture is correct but I'm not sure.\n. It appears tmdb is now reporting the one number we needed to handle differently in a unified fashion so I actually removed the culture-specific stuff we had before.\n. The part that makes me nervous here is that there was apparently no indication that the zip didn't extract fully.  Hopefully, there was and it just got dismissed somehow.\nIn any case, I will try to put some sort of recovery logic in place so that, if something fails and we know about it, we can rollback to the previous version.\nLuke - we will need a mechanism across processes and instances of those processes to relay error conditions.  How about if I just have the installer/updater drop an error.txt file into the updates folder.  Then, if that is there upon start-up, the server can display the contents as error messages in the dash...?\n. Okay.  We just need something persistent across executions but that we can clear out once we've displayed it.\n. Although...I'd love to keep serialization out of the installer/updater.  I don't want any dependencies in it.\n. That's right, I forgot.  I had to add that to retrieve the package information.  No worries then.\n. Delete trailers.  Looks like a change affecting plugins.  This isn't related to this ticket however...\n. You would have had to delete them both.\n. @Techywarrior What missing folders?  A lot of the folders under our program data directory are actually created by running the server, not the installation.\nWe are in program data because it requires admin rights to write to Program Files.\n. @FantaXP7 from here on out, if the extraction fails in a way we know about it, it should restore your previous system directory.\n. Okay, sounds like maybe another partial extraction.  But, if it isn't throwing an error, there isn't much we can do about it.\n. Okay, that's fine.  I really just wanted to document this so we won't spend a lot of time figuring it out later\n. I do think we could improve the server end of this.  We also do need to be able to manually configure it but that needs to be a fallback not the norm.  The average user shouldn't have to care where the server is.\n. I do plan to add explicit configuration to MBC but it does seem like it wouldn't be hard to make the UDP server much more reliable by simply querying the http server for the address on which requests are being received.  That would get us in 99% of cases I would think and go further towards our goal of minimum configuration required by the user.\n. When any request comes in, the address upon which it was received is available, right?  Couldn't we capture it there?\n. Status?\n. This is as designed.  Blocking unrated items was a very problematic feature in MB2 so I have eliminated it.\n. Didn't we determine that this actually is the case for some?\n. New installer is published which should fix this.\n. Yes, but it should be very easy to build an updater with no window as all of the real logic is within a separate assembly.\n. Well, we have logging now but still no notifications on the dashboard if something went wrong.  So that is the only purpose of the window in this instance right now.\n. Yeah, should be pretty simple.  Just need to pull anything in parens \"()\" out of the name before calling the tvdb search.  Then, if that fails, put them back in.\n. I think when it comes to the tvdb, the vast majority of items do not have the year associated and, if you provide it, it won't be found.  So I think the most efficient approach is to search without first.\nThat's why it works for most items now.\n. This is actually only the first time you click on it, right?\n. Looking at the log you posted, only two episodes were attempted to be fetched by the internet providers. All other items had local xml.  If local xml exists, the internal providers will not run.\n. Can I see the log where the remote fetches actually happen?  This one is after the fact.\nAre you sure this isn't a permissions problem?\n. What happens if you re-start the server?\n. How, exactly, are you deleting the metadata?\nWhen you do that, do you see items in the log that say the directory watchers saw you do that?\n. Nothing changed in the release with Pismo so that is coincidental.  Please do the following:\n- With the metadata correct and everything as it should be, re-start the server\n- Then go in and delete whatever it was you were deleting\n- Don't touch anything else.  Just wait for the watchers to see the change and cause the refresh.\n- After all that is finished, please post a link to the server log out here.\nThanks.\n. Yeah.  I haven't been able to find the registry hack again yet.\n. Here is the registry change.  I'm not 100% sure it will solve your issue but it is worth a try.\nhttp://support.microsoft.com/kb/810886\n. Yes it is.  Does it appear to not be working?\n. Ah, you mean on the TV side.  I don't think they used to support those...\n. Yeah, I guess we should support this although I think it is largely just going to contribute to our cache size issues.  The standard sizes of these items are adequate for 99% of all display situations for them.\n. Okay this is in.\n. This will take the redesign of the fetchers I asked Lord Mike to do so it may be a 3.x item.\n. Is this reproduce-able?  Or, can you find an error in the event log from this crash?\n. Also, your logs show a ton of errors in dealing with metadata for your TV items.  I'd like to get to the bottom of that.  Please post these logs and a snapshot of one of your TV folders in a reply in the beta topic on the CT.  Thanks.\n. I think this is a permissions problem that windows doesn't handle well and may only manifest itself in certain situations.\nI have the MBC installer currently forcing itself to run as admin.  We may want to do that to the server installer as well.\n. The problem with that is, if someone changes their rating system, this value will be invalid.\n. Looks great.\n. Unfortunately, I don't think there is a lot we can do here.  We fought with this for quite a while during early development and the simple fact is the directory watchers just don't always work that well with network resources.\nOne thing you can try is adjusting the delay between the time the watcher sees a change and it actually causes a refresh.  This is currently not exposed in the configuration interface but it is configurable internally.  The setting is FileWatcherDelay and is in seconds.  If you were to bump this up to 15 or 20 seconds the situation you encountered might be mitigated.\n. I had forgotten about that but didn't we determine that it kept getting re-set?  I'll have to hunt it back down.\n. Try this registry change:  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/810886\n. Actually, this is broken for all premium plugins.  I'm currently trying to track down what happened.\n. gc - be sure the user under which MB server runs has full control of your mediabrowser-server folder.  That should eliminate the need to run it as admin.\n. The installer does attempt to set the permissions but, apparently, it doesn't always work.\n. > it will take about 8-10 mins per full bd\nHoly crap.  That's 83 hours for 500 movies.  Doesn't sound like a process we want to undertake...\n. Perhaps we can talk to the MakeMKV guys and get them to fix it...\n. Okay, ignore this post but I'm loving that shot of Jennifer Connelly.  Looks like it was taken before she got skinny and lost her chest ;).\n. Yes, IBN should be the last place we look.\n. But even once the tiles reach their maximum size, there is way too much margin - leaving us with this:\n\nThere is obviously more than enough room there for another column of tiles but it won't do it until I go even wider.  Do we really have no control over that amount of right padding?\n. Great.  Thx.\n. That's to be expected.  The problem before was it was about n 1/2 tiles before you got the next column.\n. Luke - I think all these issues can be solved with the \"force\" parameter that exists on refreshMetadata.  We just need to figure out when to use it.\n. I think we should keep this open until we're sure this is licked.  I think it may be tricky.\n. @bartonnen I think I've addressed this in the latest code.\n. A bunch of changes were made yesterday in this area and I think there are a few regressions.  I'm getting a different error than you are but also having issues.  We'll nab 'em.\n. Selecting a path where?\n. Yeah, it is highly possible that the log window could blow out its memory limit.  I meant to put some sort of re-cycling into it but forgot about it.\n. I put a check in to clear the log window after 10k rows.  Let's keep an eye on it to be sure it doesn't slow anything down.\n. Bios come from Last.fm\n. Please post the log.  We made changes in this area recently so maybe we goofed something up.\n. From my experience we will probably need to have both.  The MB2 music plugin is based entirely on tags and some like that but a whole lot of people would rather drive their music libraries off of their own physical structure.\n. Yes, I have seen this as well.\n. Please ensure the account running the server has full control over our programdata/mediabrowser-server directory.\n. Also, when did you install this server?\n. Yes, that is what is happening to him.  The root isn't working.\n. I had the window up.  The log was quiet but the image had been fetched during the session.\n. It may be one of those very coincidental things.  Try forcing some images to download via the providers then go delete them in explorer.  Also, make sure this is on a network drive, not local to the machine.\nIf that works, then close this unless it crops up again.\n. Ah, yes, image.Save is also a really bad one.  Holds a lock until you dispose of the image - but I think we already have those handled.\n. I think Luke's changes will improve this but we could definitely add the ability to tag an item with a musicbrainz id.  I would suggest [mbzid=nnnnn]\n. > Why would it have to be mobile friendly?? It seems as though most mobile websites have its own \"tailored down\" view than its desktop version... Maybe it could just be active in desktop.\nThat is kinda what he means I think.\n. Any chance there is a case-sensitivity problem with the file system?\n. Interesting side-effect of our new userdata identification technique.  Actually, I think it is accurate and not sure it should change...\nFor the purposes of user-specific data like resume point and favorite, etc., we identify the items by their IMDb id instead of our arbitrary file system Id.  This way the information lives with the item even if you move its physical location.\nThe side effect being what you are seeing there - all copies of the same movie get the same data.  Since they are, in fact, copies of the same movie, I think this is correct.\n[tikuf - Pretty sure you knew all that, but for those reading behind...]\n. > Ya i agree that the resume should be set for all and I do like that just not sure we should show it multiple times in the resume section.\nYeah, but two issues with this - 1) what Mark said and 2) we really have no way of knowing which version you did watch...\n. Just fyi as a side note - you can paste in or drag in images directly from your computer into one of these github responses and it will display in-line.  Very handy.\n. If you have the 3rd party xml, then neither images nor metadata will download.  I had it on the list to split the images out into their own provider but we haven't gotten to it yet.\n. Luke - maybe the backdrops are coming back a little differently in the append_to...?\n. Not boxsets.  I just created a new movie.  Got metadata, a folder.jpg and no backdrops.\n. Yeah, if that's the case there is a logic error there.  I'll look at it.\n. I don't see what you're referring to on the refresh images option.  The logic looks correct to me regarding that.\nHowever, the backdrops are coming back empty so there must be a problem with the new fetch logic.\n. The backdrop condition is also correct.  It downloads if either that option is set or there is no local backdrop.\nThis issue is created by the new append_to_response approach of gathering the data.  See this topic.\nBasically, since the language parameter is used for the main info it causes no backdrops to be returned because backdrops have no language.\n. I recall that discussion.  Is there already an issue out here on this?\nThere are probably things we could do with hashes on the options or something but we really don't want to hurt the scan process 100% of the time to cover a 1% case.  \nI think this particular issue is centered around the save option because the images actually were downloaded.  It's just that they were downloaded to the remote image cache.  Perhaps we should just delete that whenever the save locally option is turned on.\n. Okay, cool.  That would be an easy fix.\n. The items that weren't getting locally saved images still aren't as of today's code.\nIt's the FanArt providers that aren't running.\n. A couple questions:\n1) Did you happen to have an explorer window up where that episode lives or any other files in that area open in some other program?  Like editing something with notepad or downloading an image or using metabrowser/MCM?\nThe watcher saw the change but there is logic in there to not kick of a scan until whatever you are doing is actually finished.  This way we don't constantly scan the library over and over when you are in the middle of a 45 minute rip process.  So, the watcher saw some file in that same area as being open and was waiting for it to be freed.\nOnce that happened, it would have cancelled the current scan and kicked off a new one.\n2) What client were you using against the server at this same time?  There are a bunch of item not found errors in there.\n. Did you leave MP3 tag up during that process?\nThat server is several revs behind so it doesn't have the necessary messages in the log.\n. He means his update level was reset.  We aren't still doing that are we?\n. Try completely closing the explorer window.  I have found that Windows Explorer holds locks on things when it is open.  It is maddening trying to delete a folder sometimes because the window you are trying delete it from is actually holding open the thumbs.db within the folder you are trying to delete.\n. P.S.  Going into the dashboard and re-adding the location fixes this up so it is not a high priority item - just spit and polish.\n. This was initially done during the startup wizard so it would have been starting from a non-existent library.  Perhaps that has something to do with it.\n. I see this as well.  I think the provider is trying to download an image but the image already exists.  I think the problem is that WMP creates folder.jpg as a hidden system file.\nI haven't traced this but my guess is we don't see the file is there and then we try to overwrite it.\n. When I go to that link it tells me the response has an invalid character in it.\n. FYI MBC has a button in the config page to kick this off.\n. Do you know what actually happens to them?  Do the images themselves go away or just our links to them or are they actually destroyed in some way?\n. They may be two different files but they are the same movie :).\n. In the end, we are at the mercy of the providers and the data they provide.  I don't want us spending tons of time and energy trying to work around their inaccuracies.  Instead, we should work to have them fix them.\nThis process will never be a perfect one and we undoubtedly can improve it but we haven't yet reached the time where such items get to the top of the priority list.\n. Please post this in the CoverArt repo.\n. I cannot figure out under what circumstances this doesn't work but I edited a folder name about five times yesterday trying to get it to work and it wouldn't recognize that the id was in the name.  Then today, it is picking it up.\nSo this is some sort of edge-case scenario still to be tracked down.\n. The problem with that is when the data isn't there.  Like when someone deletes an image or when an item is mis-identified the first time.  That is why it has to be cleared sometimes.  But that's a good guess.  I'll look at it.\n. Okay, I'll have to investigate what's going on then.  Maybe it is specific to CA.\n. Not sure yet.  I'll close this if there isn't.\n. There is a core issue related to this but not this exactly.  Will open a new issue.\n. Yeah, I was just hoping to avoid it because it caused a bunch of headaches in the previous world.\n. I'm going to go ahead and do this.\n. There is a bug on the IBN priority (#201).\n. Yeah, it is not exactly the same.  Just part of the issue is covered there.\n. Please post links to log files.  My log viewer application (available on the CT) will upload it for you and provide a link.  It is very hard to deal with entire logfiles in a post.  Thanks for your help.\n. Yes, they are coming from Last.fm and we are at the mercy of the data source here.  We can either ignore them or try to clean them up by comparing them against a list of \"accepted\" genres.  The problem with that is the list might be quite long and could slow things down.\n. I'm sure that's what it is.  If there are tags, they are used, otherwise the provider does it.\nThe best approach here is to probably have the Last.fm provider ignore genres.\n. Does the task % number on the dashboard ever change?\n. Looks like good detective work.  Thanks.\n. I don't think this issue is just isolated to you.  I find my scans on my server routinely stuck at about 65% (always seems to be about that level).  The activity in the log and everywhere else just seems to stop.  The task never reports it is completed and you can't stop it.  Pressing stop on the dash just puts it into a perpetual \"Stopping\" state.\nSomething is definitely up here but I can't tell what it is. \n. What is the issue with the log window?  I just had a large library scan stop twice at the exact same spot.\n. Is this supported in MB2 or did we change it somehow?\n. Okay, I don't think it was.  It is a good enhancement possibility.\n. Let's be sure we test this for performance impact since there are a whole lot of episode files in a decent sized library.\n. Can I please see the xml?\nOops.  Sorry, you posted it : |\n. I think this is a problem with the data at tvdb.  Try editing that xml file and removing the html tags that are embedded in the overview field.\n. If we never clear metadata values, how do we ever delete data?  This is the only reason I put that logic in.  If you deleted something or an item was mis-identified the first time, it was impossible to get rid of the data.\n. Will having the user re-name their TV specials folder to \"Specials\" work?  If so, I think that might be the best answer for this particular issue.\n. But how does that solve the issue at hand - of removing data that needs to be removed?\nAlso, for metadata editing we are going to have to manipulate and save the same files that the 3rd party guys do.  Otherwise, our edits will never persist any kind of re-scan.  So, for that, this doesn't really appear to be an issue.\n. Where I ran into the issue was with images.  Let's say the wrong logo.png got put in a folder so I deleted it.  The library still showed it and always would until you deleted the db file.\nUnless we provide the ability to clear out these values then some provider has to \"own\" each piece of metadata so that it can do it.\n. It's not the case anymore because we clear out the image paths before allowing the providers to run.  If you can find some other way of accomplishing that, I'm fine with it.  I just don't know how we erase something without either having the baseitem do it before a refresh or having a provider own a particular attribute and do it itself.\n. I think we should have people rename their season 0 folders and be consistent now that we can have specials anywhere.  That appears to work.\nThe rename internally is also okay but I don't think it works in all instances (maybe without inet providers?)\n. That is when it is done in MB2.\n. This is starting to sound like a timing issue.  Like maybe the episodes are attempting to fetch before the series itself has and, therefore, there is no series id to fetch with...\n. A video of some sort within its own folder is the definition of a movie in MB.  To support music videos as something else will mean we'll need some way, either structurally or other, to denote them as such.\n. Sounds like a good approach but if we can't determine the current cached enhanced image how are we deleting the ones that are no longer in use?  Re: http://community.mediabrowser.tv/permalinks/r/13546/57061/mb3-server-beta?expand_comments=true#cr57061\n. Strike that - The value that is changed is on an item not within any configuration I can track within the plugin.  How would I incorporate that into a cache key?\n. Yes, but that value is based off of information in my configuration files as it relates to all items - not every single item in the library.  I would have to maintain some sort of list of keys for every individual item for that to work.\n. Ok...wait, I think I'm clicking to it...\nIf that returns a key, then that key is related to the cache name and so it is the other end that would determine if it changed...\n. Yeah, see above - I finally snapped.\nThis won't impact anyone else, right?\n. This is going to be a MUCH better solution all around.  May even give us a slight performance bump on enhancing.\nI think I've got it done both in core and CA. \n. > I have to honestly say this is my least favorite feature of MB2. I've borked my playstates more than one because of it.\nThe thing about doing it with a setting is that it is impossible to bork your playstates with it.  We don't actually create a playstate for items older than this, we just always return true for HasPlayed for items older than this.\nThat way, you can simply change the date and everything is back where it was without any mass edits.  And we don't generate a ton of userdata objects that aren't really necessary.\nI think it is a pretty innocuous setting.  The mass edit strategy is more potentially destructive and would have to be done for every user.\n. You mean the watched before date?  That is a setting that is saved in the config file.\nOr do you mean actual watched status?  If the latter, then it was discussed and we don't do it for a couple reasons.  One, we want to run with read-only access to the media folders by default (although this is becoming less prevalent) and two, it isn't a single setting as this information is saved per user profile so we would have to come up with a nested setting and have to worry about other apps destroying it.\n. The changeset referenced here doesn't look like it addressed this particular issue.  Seems like we need a .trim() on the name setter.  Am I looking at something wrong?\n. Also, just FYI, I know the movie db works this way and maybe the tv db too - Updates on the website are not immediately reflected in the API.  It can sometimes take a few days.\n. I might have created the Parental Rating bug trying to eliminate the condition where the admin user cannot set a max rating...\n. I fixed the part I screwed up but how did you ever get there?  If I go into the dashboard from a non-admin user all I get is the dashboard main page and no left side tool menu...\n. I still think you need to be able to allow a max rating on an admin account.  People have always stumbled themselves with PC and not realizing why things weren't there.  There really isn't a good reason to deny the ability to limit the library with parental control just because one is an admin.\n. It is the blasted \"Block Unrated\" option that is the big problem here.  Now you see why I didn't want to implement it in the first place.  Created these issues in MB2 all the time.\nI am going to turn it off by default and let the people who really want it turn it on.\n. Some devices don't have any distinction between pause and stop so could be a tricky one.\n. I think that would depend on the client.  In MBC for instance, I don't think we send a position update on pause but I can look at adding it.\n. Yeah, I take that back.  Any status change will cause MBC to update the position on the server.  But, this should never really be a issue with it anyway since we're not streaming so won't get cut off.\n. I was under the impression the default would be non-cropped but MBC appears to be getting cropped ones.  Do I have to ask for non-cropped?\n. I'm getting a missing method exception on the net 3.5 model attempting to set that option\n. Some providers have html overviews.  Maybe IMDb when sourced via things like Metab...?\nI also know that Last.fm has html overviews and bios.\n. From what I can tell, the tvdb does not support any other country ratings.  At least, there is no mention of it in their API.\n. If you create the proper images in IBN/Mediainfo folder (rated_nnn.png) then I think they will show.\n. Appears to still be a problem.  CT report\n. I'm not sure exactly what it is.  It is probably related to the way legacy themes access information but there is a decided difference between starting MBC the first time after a server re-start vs any other time and I see all the people creations happening on the server during this wait period.\nThis is a legacy thing I'm sure but I don't see a lot of harm in going ahead and loading all of those items at start since it is very likely we'll need them anyway.  I'm assuming they are loaded all in a block like they used to be.\n. Okay, I have the feedback now.\nNot requiring all of these items into memory might also solve the issue as I don't think anything is really requesting them all.  I think it might just be requesting a few and that is causing them all to pre-load.\n. I'd rather demand load them in MBC since they very well may NOT all be accessed in any given session so no reason to take the hit over the wire.  They are already cached on my side once we do get them (but only the ones actually requested).\n. It was just a typo in some new code CBers.  Should be fine now.\n. I'd like to limit the fragmentation of our documentation.  Right now, the wiki on GitHub is for developers and the KB on the CT is for users.  There are links to the CT now on the website and from the MBC Configurator.\n. We should, however, probably add a \"Become a part of the MB Dev team\" page on the main site that would then link back to GitHub.  Grant (couldn't find your github id) are you listening...?\n. Maybe except for images, the markup on the CT and Github is identical so copying the one here over should be fairly easy.\nI do think we should try to keep user docs and dev docs separate though.  I'd much rather have our end users registering on the CT than wading through a coders site like GitHub.  Yes, there will be overlap but that's okay.\n. Hmmm... when I tried it before I couldn't \"@\" you in here.  Now I can.  Whatever.\nBoy, we could sure use Birkoff right about now...\n. We've had a lot of discussion about that section in other threads.  It is one of the areas of overlap and will exist on the CT as well.\n. Right now it looks like the minimum score is 0 but maybe I was looking in the wrong place.  For MBC I don't really need to limit by number.  I can show as many as we need to.\nLimiting by number is going to produce arbitrary results without some sort of decent minimum score though because there might only be one or two things that really are similar but you'd still get 10 or 25 or whatever - most of which wouldn't be similar at all.\n. Also, can we add ExcludeItemTypes to the SimilaritemsQuery?  MBC has a setting to exclude things like trailers from these types of searches but I can't do that unless I filter the list after it has come back (and then, if a bunch of trailers score high it will bump out other content).\n. Apparently there is another sub-tag to that ParentalRating of \"Descritption\" which holds the specific reasons for the rating and this is filled in by MetaB.  I don't believe we currently read this tag nor have anyplace to put it on BaseItem.  Should it be added?\n. Seems to be working but it obscures the top of the slide-out filter/sort panel.\n. Did you remove weather from the server?\n. MBC was using it.\n. It does still use the Yahoo service but it was getting the location and degree type from the server settings.\nThat was the reason this issue was opened. \n. .49 is a version of MBC not the server :)\n. I am using the APIClient routine to post to the progress url but I don't see anything in there that would tie it to my websocket session.  What needs to be specified to tie that post to the session?\n. Never mind.  I found it.  The auth header wasn't set properly on that post call.\n. I think the reality of the situation for anyone is going to be that there are times that their internet connection won't work.  Therefore, this message will almost always appear at some point.  But, unless it is a consistent and long term problem there isn't any issue that the user can address.\n. It could be on either end.  But, regardless it isn't an actual problem long-term so the persistent message isn't useful.\nIf we truly had a severe reliability problem with our back end, we would be seeing reports of people not able to download our packages or get to the plug-in catalog when they request it (MBC also contacts this same repo) and I have seen none of those reports and I have not experienced any problems with this in the past couple months.\nSo, maybe there is something internally with the server that is getting gummed up on these requests somehow. \n. Are we no longer showing the message?  I still think the persistent message is not useful (and potentially harmful) since it won't be anything the user can address.\n. Were those manual runs of the task?\n. Embedding on the page sounds reasonable.  I just think the persistent footer message isn't useful because it is potentially so old.\nUltimately, I'd like to know why we get so many failures though and only in this context.\n. The categories exist already and the filter mechanism does too.  We just need to add the categories to the filter.\n. That's true right now but what happens when something extends movies or any other type to include another sub-type?  Then we'll have to add yet another option.  Just seems like using the same method as the other queries catches all possible future cases.\n. Also, while the API service implements this, the IncludeTrailers property has not been added to the SimilarItemsQuery in the model so the APIClient has no access to it.\n. I've worked around this in the MBC APIClient so it isn't a high priority item.  I still think using the standard properties would be most flexible going forward, but leave it up to you what you wan to do here.\n. I worked around it for this implementation.  I still think using the same set of properties would be good but it isn't a priority right now.\n. I have done this.  You html gurus should check my work and be sure I did it in a kosher way.\nI also fixed one bug in the key entry process but there is another one I didn't chase down.  The keys now properly reload after you update them but the badge in the header does not update.  You have to move to another page or refresh that one for it to go gold or silver based on the new saved keys.\n. We should probably keep it open.  I just removed the option from MBC since the server doesn't support it.\n. > Does this occur in the web client?\nThere is no indexing of collections in the web client, is there?\n. Actually, there are two different places - our supporter page and then the plugin pages.  I think I made one of them stay within the same browser tab and the other open in a new one.  I remember there was some sort of good logic for why on both but can't remember what it was : |\n. People are still having trouble with this.  We should remove the attempt to launch PayPal in a separate tab.\n. I can't figure out why this only happens with the internal player as the exact same code is being executed in both cases.  In any case, the one thing that seems to matter is win 7 server vs. win 8 which, to me, points to something with the win 7 websocket library.  Could be an interaction between the one I'm using on MBC and the one being used on the server but the one I use in MBC works with win 8 every time it seems.\n. For now, I'm moving MBC back to the HTTP api calls as they appear to work fine in both environments.\n. Please test it and confirm it works for you.  Thx.\n. Crap, you're right.  I accidentally left the start with websockets.  What is the impact?\n. Excellent.  Thanks.\n. > mbc build .59 resolves this issue entirely for me.\nI just want to confirm \"entirely\".  The start/stop reporting should now work okay but I'm still seeing that progress reporting is not working properly with a Win 7 server.\n. But does the seek bar and position move properly?\n. Okay.  It is not working for me on my Win7 server but does work on my Win8 one.\n. Wow - not trying to put lipstick on anything.  Trying to make the system more intuitive and user friendly.\nFor me, this happens because our system reacts so quickly to a file system change that my movies are identified as folders before I can get the video file into them.  Then it gets difficult to make it re-identify it.  I suggested making it not react so quickly before and you dumped on that too.\n. MBC shows all of this information.\n. Personally, I think this is a no-brainer.  I don't see why anyone would want something they already watched to completion still be tagged as \"New\".  But, I've been wrong before (once ;).\n. What does the server log say about it?\n. Force refresh a boxset and post the log.\n. Because of the enum and \"Last\" previously being 5, this fix will also require a re-build of CA.  Future changes like this should be insulated from this though.\n. I also still really don't like the design of the remote browse/play dialog.  I find it cumbersome and not intuitive.  If I want to remote play something I have to produce a drop down to select the right command set and then the play buttons appear.  Too many clicks and not immediately obvious that I need to click the drop down when I first enter the dialog.\nI think just straight buttons to Browse, Play, Resume, etc. would be much easier and more intuitive.\n. This issue is occurring for me on the web client.  Other clients would be different.\n\nVersion 26.0.1410.64 m\n\nThere is an update available so I'll try updating chrome.\n. Updated Chrome.  No change.\nUsed IE 10. Same thing.\nBehaves the same whether I'm controlling MBC or another instance of the dashboard.  The chrome log window (shown above) confirms the seek command being sent is with position 0 no matter where I drag or click the bar.\nThis is a folder rip - is it possible that is causing the hiccup?  It used to work fine.\n. Yep - duh.  Just noticed that movie has no run time.  Most of my other rip run times are incorrect but they do show something and, on those, the seeking does work (within the value it shows anyway).\nSo, you must be validating the value against the run time or something.  Could you maybe not do that for a folder rip and, also, use the metadata run time for those?  I think if we did those two things, it would mostly work for folder rips.\n. The run time doesn't exist.  It isn't reported anywhere so I assume it is null.  The remote window shows the bar as 0:00/0:00.\nBut, doing what I asked will work for MBC and probably MBT as well because we aren't streaming so the seeking, as long as you provide the proper value will work.\n. I thought we were already doing this.  At least, we did in MB2.  Maybe it got lost in translation.\nBut, I'm not sure imdb id should be the priority since it is actually tmdb we are searching...\n. Right, but why use IMDB id first if we have the tmdb id.  That's all I'm saying.  Seems we should use tmdb id if we have it and fall back on imdb since it is actually tmdb that we are searching (so that relationship is guaranteed to be there while imdb may not).  This is how MB2 did it I'm not sure how it fell off of our implementation.\n. Ah...gotcha.\n. I think what happens is OSX creates a hidden file that looks just like a video file and we are getting tripped up because now there are multiple video files in the folder.\n. You want me to take a whack at this?\n. Okay, The CollectionFolder is actually the main item that does need to support this - perhaps you were thinking about the UserRoot folder.\nIn any case, the only one I blocked from supporting shortcuts so far is the Aggregate folder.  I did have to virtualize LinkedChildren.\nIn early testing it appears to be working but this will have to be vetted very thoroughly.\n. Because of the way collection folders dynamically build their children - they also need to dynamically build their linked children.  So, either we virtualize it or we have to build it and there isn't a good place to put a hook in to initialize it.  Then, we'd also have to deal with when to clear it out, etc.\nBy virtualizing it like the children, we keep it dynamically up to date at all times and loaded on demand.\nWhat would be the use-case for editing these manually?\n. Okay.  The only other snag I've hit so far is with the way MBC builds recent lists.  I do a limited recursive search via the API query string.  I think you are defaulting any recursive search to not include linked children so the recent lists are missing any of these shortcut items.\nCan you add a param to allow me to force it to include the linked children on these searches?  I can deal with dupes on my end if I have to (although, I don't think that will happen much in this particular instance).\n. You can leave the default to ignore linked children unless specifically requested not to do so.  That way it won't screw up anyone else.\n. Yeah, the recursive is a mistake...\n. > We have some word removal going on in the search algorithm. We might want to think about removing all of that and feeding the search string directly into the movie db, and taking the first result we get back.\nI think this is a good thing to try.  That logic is very old and tmdb's search has probably gotten a lot better.\n. How much did you test this so far?  I think the starting and ending number replacement may still be valuable as I'm not sure tmdb has gotten that good at things like recognizing \"eight\" for \"VIII\" and that was a fairly recent addition.  Also the foreign character stuff may also be necessary still.\n. That's a great idea.  I'm going to solicit on the CT for troublesome names.\n. I suppose this could pretty easily be implemented as a plug-in if we wanted.\nIt could be implemented as a provider that runs after the others if we didn't want to introduce a new process to the refresh.\n. if we're gonna do this we should do it such that we can add whatever overlay we want as opposed to just watched.  Plus, we need to take into consideration a way to do it without exploding the image cache (see discussion in dev forum).\n. Yeah, I think this is a great idea.\n. Video works.  Audio does not.\n. I agree.  Commas are likely to be common in a lot of names.\n. Do we know that this data is coming from IMDb?  Is it coming via their open FTP methods?  I thought OMDB was using open, freely available data...\n. Yeah, I suspect this OMDB thing is a thinly veiled abstraction of IMDB scraping.  Be sure we maintain our current providers as fall-backs for when this guy gets taken down...\n. I think we should keep this the same style it is now as it matches the installation and update windows and is fairly un-obtrusive. We just need to update the logo.\n. Did you save your edit before turning off the updating?  If you do, does it make a difference?\n. This is in.\n. I see you have this on 22 - just wanted to confirm you don't plan to do this on the current release cycle since it appears I need that to go out on schedule for Podcasts.\n. This would have to happen at the client level.  It is possible for them to request non-enhanced images so they would just need to add this option if they wanted to.\n. The steps to reproduce are in the initial post:  Hit the Restart server button from the dashboard when in a plug-in's configuration page.\nThe error that is produced is the generic ServiceStack error with a null ref (see below).  I'm 99% sure the issue is as I described, the plug-in simply hasn't initialized yet.  Just wanted to get it documented out here.\nSnapshot of GetDashboardConfigurationPage generated by ServiceStack on 10/10/2013 6:09:25 PM\nview json datasource from original url: http://localhost:8096/mediabrowser/dashboard/ConfigurationPage?name=MBPlus& in other formats: json xml csv jsv\nResponse Status\nError CodeNullReferenceException MessageObject reference not set to an instance of an object.

Yeah, I encountered this a week or so ago and put it in the forum.  Good thing you put it out here because I forgot about it.\n. No, that's not right.  Anything in brackets is supposed to be stripped. If you don't do that we'll never find the titles with the meta fetchers.\n. Why make the regex more complex and slower.  The whole point of me implementing this logic in the first place was to allow for all the things that put special stuff like origin and format inside square brackets. All of that is supposed to be ignored for the purposes of determining the real name.\n. The name will never match the file name because we replace it with the real name when we find it.  This is a four year old feature of MB.  For reference: http://community.mediabrowser.tv/permalinks/r/450/1206/text-bewteen-is-no-longer-ignored#1206\n. I meant the PayPal button on the supporter page.  I think this may have been done already though.\n. I think the new alternate versions/media sources functionality going in will eventually solve this but the other side of the coin is that you might want to select which version to look at/watch.  Those aren't really duplicates as you might want to select the HD or SD or 3D version.\n. I believe the new alternate version/media sources stuff will mean your first expectation will become the reality.\n[shameless plug] CoverArt would allow you to see the difference[/shameless plug]\n. Does his have an impact on server-side image processors?\n. So how does all this change how one would write a provider?\n. So people's custom media folder images will just be ignored...?\n. From my experience with MB 2 and MBC, the grouping is a quite tricky problem.  Because what the user expects is to only see the actually new items within the group - not the entire container.\n. While you're in there, how do you feel about the concept of resolving all top-level folders in a media folder with a type of \"TV\" as a series?\nIt is currently a real pain to add a new series to MB because, if you're not real quick in also adding a season 1 folder it gets mis-identified and things go badly.\nSeems like we can safely make the assumption that any top-level folder in a TV media folder is a series.  We could make the folder provider that looks for a folder.xml file take priority so that, if someone ever does want to organize their series into folders, they can by having that xml file.\n. Adding new TV shows is way too hard right now and makes the system look bad.\nWe need to figure out a way to manage that better.  That has to be more likely than whatever rare situation someone would have where a top level folder isn't a series.\n. Yes, we plan to as soon as Microsoft opens up the sdk. http://mediabrowser.tv/community/index.php?/topic/7394-xbox-one/\n. FYI - primary images are readily available for most seasons of most shows and should continue to be the primary image in this view.\n. Perhaps you don't have image fetchers enabled for TV seasons.  Tvdb has primary images for most of them.\n. Then I would suggest posting in the Server forum.  Please manually refresh a season with the metadata editor and post the server log from that session.\n. In case you haven't figured it out already - simply enclose the resolution in square brackets []\n. You said before, I think, that you forked.  Be sure you cloned...\n. Personally, I think the time limit should be a part of the trigger because you may want the same task to run for different lengths of time at different times (say five hours during the night but all day on Mondays).\n. Yes, Hallelujah as this will fix this problem on the ATV app as well.\n. Since https cannot be used in all situations, sending passwords in plain text is not advisable.\nAll of the information you provided above is technically correct, but it must be balanced with the actual vulnerability and need.  We are securing access to media content that is stored already within a (most likely) insecure file system.  If one were to gain access to the physical Emby database, they have gained access to that file system and, therefore, any passwords for our system are irrelevant at that point.\nAlso, most of the clients do not store any form of a password on their end (hashed or otherwise).  Instead they store an access token that can be readily revoked at the server end requiring the client to re-authenticate.\nSecurity is important to us and we have made improvements in this area and will continue to do so.  However, there are many practical factors to take into account when doing so.\n. Since we are open-source, any hard-coded key or certificate in that source is readily obtainable.\n. Check out the Swagger docs available from the tray menu of the server.  Particularly the \"Users\" end point.\n. The server doesn't necessarily run under the local system account because it may need access to network resources - in which case it needs to run under specific credentials to do so.\n. Yes, we will direct stream and that is not considered transcoding.\n. Correct.\nFor further help please post on the support forum http://emby.media/community.  Thanks.\n. Might I suggest a Dictionary instead of a List so that you don't re-process dups...?\n. Yes, just localization of the text you have control over.  See the other pages for how to do it.\n. Yes, you should always be working in dev. Thanks.\n. http://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/26063-movie-poster-no-scaled-properly-when-dimensions-not-set-in-metadata-manager/\n. This is by design at this point in time.\nWe install to the user-specific area instead of a common location because this is the only way we can ensure our automatic update routines will work completely unattended.\nGiven that, we install to the first admin account to minimize the situation where someone installs the server multiple times on the same machine into multiple different user accounts.\n. I'm pretty sure the only reason we elevate right now is to cause the server to be installed into a single, repeatable user account even if the user installs it from multiple users.\nThis elevation can probably be removed with the only repercussion being that the server will get installed into whatever user account is running the installer.  We cannot go into a common area (other than the admin user area).  We have been down this road and it simply isn't reliable.\nIf someone wants to make the change to the installer such that it doesn't request elevation and thoroughly test it with both existing and new installs, then I'm game for that.\n. Recorded TV probably shouldn't be defined as a library but, in relation to this specific change, the issue will be with the standard movie structure of each one in its own folder and many different files within that folder.  We don't want a refresh firing until all the files in that folder have finished being modified.\nDid you test this scenario?\n. It isn't a bug but, rather, an unsupported structure.\nIt's possible that structure could get supported in the future but it isn't now.\n. That is a convention we've been using for many years and it works in 99% of cases.\nI believe your issue can be solved by simply naming the movie \"REC\".\n. At one point, we used to make a final attempt with the raw file system name if nothing was found with the previous attempts.  Restoring that may also solve this.\n. What app are you using on the TV?\n. Okay, so this would be via DLNA.\nThis isn't one of the new Sonys with Android TV on it is it?\n. According to my search, that is an Android TV model.  If so, you can find our Android TV app in the store and it will provide you with a better interface for Emby.\n. This will also probably make it much harder for someone to do a clean re-install and then restore information from backup.  Just FYI.\n. Make sure you haven't named your items in such a way that they are being discovered as multiple parts of the same item.\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/Movie%20naming\n. DisplayPrefs have a dictionary in them...\n. Can you please describe exactly what happens when you try to log in?  Also, had you set up the FTV to automatically log in to that person and remember the password?\n. Hi.  Can you please send a log from the app and then provide the information requested in the instructions linked below?  Thanks.\nhttps://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/739-how-to-report-a-problem/. Hi.  Yes, we are aware of this but have not been able to track it down yet.\nThanks!. Hi.  This will be fixed with the next release of the app.\nThanks.. Hi.  Can you tell us exactly what you did and what happened?  Also, did these people already have Connect accounts or no?\nThanks. . > I can no longer add an alias to a user who was invited by emby connect?\nI'm not sure what you mean but please ask this different question in the forums.  Thanks.. Hi. I tested an email of \"test.account@domain.com\" and received the email without issue.\nFor the \"+\" one, I believe if you simply omit the \"+\" it should work as well since Gmail ignores those anyway.\nPlease let us know if you still have an issue with this and under what specific conditions and we can re-open.  Thanks.. Hi.  Are you running through a reverse-proxy of some sort?\nIt looks like some of the payload from the request is being stripped.. Okay, I'm pretty sure that is the problem.  Most of the information being sent to the server is being stripped away by something.. It is the POST data that is getting stripped.   I'm not sure by what.... We aren't sure but it is something with the reverse-proxy.\nJust FYI - you aren't getting proper playback (your items will always transcode to a generic format) in any of the Emby apps if this information is being stripped.. Hi.  Thanks for the report.  We will take a look at this.. Hi.  This should be fixed in the beta of the app that went up today.\nThanks.. ",
    "skynet600": "Still not happening for me in the last few builds.\n. Is this supposed to be resolved because it is not working for me on v3.0.4820.28638?\n. The library browser, xml and mbt all show in the same order but this is my point.  In my opinion mbt should show the order based on the tag and not the order within the xml.  It should be cast then crew.\n. Actually if we need to keep the crew then I would like to see a new tab for therm and keep performers for the \"performers\". Alternatively keep the crew out of performers altogether and just have the director as is in the detail page.  Do we really care who the rest of the crew are? \n. What exactly needs validating on this one? I still see crew before cast at least in the library browser. \n. Yep I see what mean. Works a treat. \n. Ok but sometimes they are not there at all and other times I see double and sometimes I see no MBT when I am clearly in it.\n\n. Still a problem for me.  Example here is I have dash open and I open client.  Both client and dsh shows in user list.  Close client, refresh dash and it still shows as connected.\n. This works for me and V3.0.4844.14865.\n. Working. Well done. \n. I would be happy to close but I am unable to change the labels, right?\n. Resolved thank you!\n. iPad safari\n. Just tested on windows PC and Firefox.  It works fine there and indeed in IE.  Although with IE the item does not play.  See new issue.\n. With iPhone when you play a title the player immediately maximises which is great but when you hit done and it resizes the window the stop doesn't do anything and the player does not close.  I need to close the browser to get rid of it. With iPad no maximise.\n. Nah sorry Luke but no change. When I play an item I get the minimised player up with a big play button inside it. Pressing that actually plays the title and I then have to max the screen. All a bit drawn out if i am honest. Once finished I hit done and it returns to small screen and does not close at all. \n. You are missing the point here.  The problem happens on a cold restart of the machine itself and not just the server process.  The server process starts up within seconds on my system to.

Mark, are these logs from a machine restart or just the server process?  With the process start my system takes around seven seconds.  However with the machine startup it takes around six minutes.\n. Well on this same machine I do have Plex Server running as well as metaBrowser.  They both start on power-up.  Could there be a conflict between something else and MB3?\n. Disabled on startup metaBrowser, Plex and Teamviewer.  Not much difference to me.\n2013-04-08 22:12:30.6612, Info, App, Loading MediaBrowser.Api, Version=3.0.4846.28124, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null\n2013-04-08 22:12:30.8812, Info, App, Loading

Do you think the following could have a bearing on it?\nmetaBrowser\nPlex\nMB2\nicloud control panel\nteamviewer\nI use this machine as a server of course so it has all this stuff running on it.\n. Yeah taking around eight minutes for me now.\n. Not noticeably no.  I have a little over 1200 titles with  some being in a boxset format.  I just opened it and using my iPhone connected to my corporate guest wifi started it at 16:02.  The timer is still going strong with lots of flickering at 16:18. It finished at 16:19. \n. My \"Films\" collection within the library viewer but remotely using the internet. \nI closed the connection and tried it again.  I would have expected it to be quicker.  It actually took half the time but I was left with an odd view of images but with some empty squares.  I refreshed the page and it resolved almost straight away.  Clean and quick.  I closed the connection again and tried again.  This time it took less than a minute!\n. Recommended was almost instant but I only have five items there.  Movies itself took little more than 15 secs I suppose.  By the way here is the odd squares I was talking about...\n\n. Yeah I can refresh the page and all is nice again.  By going back you mean to my collection?  If so then the results are varied if I am honest.  For the most part it is a long wait but once there and the page has finished loading it is nice and smooth.\n. Ok well no movies is taking a while to finish.\n. Yeah it has improved for me. I have to say Luke this interface is really turning into something sweet. I love the filtering choices and views. \n. That would be a more manageable figure in my opinion. \n. Expanding on this a little but how about A to Z grouping? Maybe a separate request but at the mo it is hard to find stuff. \n. In fact local host also has four columns which on much bigger screens is also too little in my opinion. \n. You might have to show me a picture Luke. If you mean the progress bar then that is fine. I see no resume bar though. \n. Still an issue Luke. \n. Again I did not see a progress bar.\n. Here is the contents of music.\n\nHere is a startup log...\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5701721/MB3/Server-635027845416165427.log\n. Yes indeed that was the problem. So we need to change the priority?\n. I remember getting now 1 for a birthday. 84 albums later :s\nAnyway I just happen to re-add that one which is why it is there. Completely irelivent I know. \n.

    "RedshirtMB": "Still not working. Neither the Android client or the Web UI are showing the backdrop image for the trailers folder. The logs show that the server did detect the filesystem changes.\nlog\nLooking at the json returned from the server, there are no backdrop image tags provided.\n\n{\"Name\":\"Trailers\",\"Id\":\"db698305-8fd7-14eb-03a1-> 3917943077ec\",\"IsFolder\":true,\"Type\":\"TrailerCollectionFolder\",\"BackdropImageTags\":[],\"LocationType\":\"FileSystem\"}\n. That json excerpt is 10 minutes after I added the images. The images do show in the library explorer, but nowhere else. Is the library explorer even using the api for the images or just reading them right off the file system.\n. I hate to be late to the party but do we have to strip the tags? I wish I'd gone through the issues sooner. \n\nWhile I can appreciate users on an HTPC might not like the hyperlinks, I find they are a neat addition to the mobile client where you have the device in your hand. I've got the links working on the Android client and was just in the process of formatting them so that the url itself isn't shown\n\n. God no..\n. Fixed in the newest buids\n. I have to admit that confuses me too. Clicking on the URL initiates a file download. Eric makes is sound like the installer shouldn't be downloading, rather running remotely.\n. Just tested. I'm seeing this issue as well.\nLog output is the same as CBers.\n. CBers. Do you have Trakt installed. If so delete it from both the server and MBT plugins folder.\nIt seems that on first run the plugins aren't loaded in MBT Then on subsequent runs they are.\n. Closing this then. I'll open a bug on the MBT issue tracker.\n. Oh please :+1: \n. So does the Zune software it seems. A hidden folder.jpg.\n. Confirmed.It's fixed.\n. Regarding hybrid plugins, since both mine fall into that category. For both I'm going to have 2 assemblies, one that would install on the server and one that would install on MBT. I'd really like to see it done so that there's only one store tile. The store is going to get cluttered quick, and could end up being confusing to some users who want to install one of those plugins. Plus it alleviates the \"Which of the hybrid parts do I charge for\" if I'm going the premium plugin model.\n. Will we actually be streaming to anything that has greater than stereo output?\n. I can see the text in both chrome for android, and the android gmail app.\nOn Tuesday, April 9, 2013, Luke notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@RedshirtMB\n@tikuf\n@abobader\nDo you guys see this on any of your andriod devices?

It takes 40 seconds on my core2duo e6600.\n. Testing with build 3.0.4845.30885.\n\nSomething has changed in the most recent build. The Core 2 Duo has dropped to 20 seconds from icon click to systray icon appearing.\nI7 960\nC2D E6600\n. On my i7 it takes about 9 seconds to get to the system tray icon from launch.On my C2D e6600 (i think) It takes at least 2 minutes.\n. I'm glad you discovered that. Interesting how browsing my own library using the Library Explorer, I don't have any mis-resolved games.\n. Why not go one step further and actually share the directory if the path hasn't already been shared, and it's on the local machine. I'd imagine it being helpful for less technical users.\n. Is there a collection that's missing? Or is Documentaries the first in the list?\n. The undefined collection is actually MBTrailers. For some reason I'm seeing the same after the most recent server update. It's also showing in the library explorer with no title.\n. Yes it's still borked for me. Just tested in Chrome 30.\nI installed SNESBox, clicked restart at the bottom. The page refreshed. Clicked the plugin catalog button with the arrow. Then clicked the NESBox plugin. Clicked the install button and the screen immediately changed to \n\nHere's the log.\nI've left the browser window open with the spinning circle in case you want me to do something specific to troubleshoot \n. Updated to Chrome 31 today and am still seeing the issue described.\n. Just tested on today's build and I was able to successfully install a second plugin. Nice!\n. Please test with the most recent version and report here if there are issues.\n. Haha.It's a nice shot.\nLooking at the screenshot Tikuf provided, It would be nice if roles were combined. So show Shane Acker once, but have his role be Screenplay / Director rather than showing him twice. \n. You don't have the green text image in a ibn music folder do you?\n. Jacklynee has also posted on the CT how Arabic is mangled.\n\n. when an artist call is made to lastfm, doesn't it return all their albums as well with the correct I'd. can't we just store it with the parent then look locally for the id. \n. If I understand what Voltage is saying, His D drive is populated with movie folders and boxset folders with movies in them. Selecting D:\\ isn't working.\n.

Watching a 3D version of Avatar at home and then going out and watching your 2D copy from the same resume point on another device.\n. Yeah I goofed with the last update. Didn't correct the dispose method.\n. I can push a build after work. I wanted to wait and squash gcw07's bug too.\n. New build posted. If it's still happening you can post it on the trakt issue tracker.\n. \"Now 44\" OMG do I feel old. I remember buying \"Now 8\" \nCarry on...\n. Fantastic!\n. I have to honestly say this is my least favorite feature of MB2. I've borked my playstates more than one because of it.\n. its only mbc but the server log, or at least my log, shows the playing items api call and a HTTP 200 response. I've already mentioned it on the mbc issue tracker. Eric hasn't had a chance to look and see if its mbc or server\n. I'm seeing this as well. To expand... It appears that the Videa Image Extraction task will process a newly added item, when the directory watchers pick it up. \nYet if you manually run the task it doesn't process pre-existing items without images.\n. I gave up and ended up just uninstalling and deleting the entire server folder. On a re-install, re-adding all the libraries it worked on the custom library.\n. I haven't seen this issue since deleting the server folder and re-installing from scratch.\n. droid isn't using websockets to report playback\n. nope. sorry\n. It's partially working for me. It looks like the initial playback started api call is still being done through websockets and the playback progress and playback stopped are being done through http. \n. For users who had partial websocket functionality there is no impact as far as trakt is concerned. Users such as myself who have no websocket functionality, trakt reporting doesn't work at all. The server firing the start event is imperative.\n. mbc build .59 resolves this issue entirely for me.\n. The position in the dashboard seems right to me. It looks like the server is receiving the progress updates properly\n. I'm not against showing it. My initial reason for not showing it was that it's not actually accurate since what the user is seeing on my client is an H264/AAC encoded stream with the video dimensions changed to reflect the screen.\n. I feel the same way. I filter out Watched items on my client when showing what's new.\n. Just tried this on the droid client. It's really sweet.\n\nIf there was also 'unwatched' and 'new' flags. It would allow me to really streamline my UI xml allowing the device to build each tile quicker.\n. Might be handy to do similar during the initial client websocket handshake. That way we can have other clients aware of what media types can even be sent to another client.\n. Thank you for reporting this. The appropriate people will be notified.\n. All I have is sfnetworks log which shows the Trakt logging in relation to playback. Neither Grant nor I can reproduce this, and the link to my source shows I'm not adulterating the userData.Played value before consuming it.\n. and I agree with you that every client would be seeing this. If you have any other suggestions for testing I'm willing to give them a go.\n. I'm still not able to repro. Closing until a reproducible situation can be created. \n. I don't think this is 100% yet. I just added images using the editor interface to the trailers root folder and the missing backdrop/primary image indicators didn't refresh and disappear\n. When you disconnnect from the Chromecast. Are you doing it from the cast icon within the Android client, or from the notification tray? Are the results the same from both? \n. Thanks. That gives me a starting point.\n. Is there a noticeable performance increase transcoding a movie when running in a 64-bit environment  as opposed to the 32-bit environment?\n. Is this through the Web Client, Android or IOS? \n. Also, new shows aren't displaying actors at the series level. I've added 3 shows today and none have actors, while they do on TVDB.\n. Emby doesn't support nested episodes. https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/blob/master/MediaBrowser.Server.Implementations/Library/Resolvers/TV/EpisodeResolver.cs#L33\nNested episodes aren't described in the wiki either. \nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/TV%20naming\n@softworkz Season folders are optional, in this case TwoD is just not following the library structure guidelines.\n. Thanks. I'm back on the release build after a server reinstall. I'll keep an eye out after the next release build.\n. Karbowiak.\nLinode isn't a tiny operation. Abandoning ship just because of one outage, even though it was a big one, seems a bit knee jerk. \nI for one am in a way glad the outage happened. It lets the devs assess how the emby ecosystem handles a large scale outage and determine what changes should be made across the server, clients and web services.\n. ",
    "FantaXP7": "I've been getting a ton of ffmpeg crash notices in windows...not sure if it is the same issue.\nhttp://pastebin.com/krKVaDGC\n. After an attempt to play something via the iphone app. Items will play...though I think I will need to look at it closer and pay better attention, didn't notice the errors on the server side until later on. \n. I accidentally doubled posted Issue 94 and 95. On 95, which I closed, I added logs...just in case that might help.\nThanks\n. Ok will do.\nThanks\n. During that log not 100% sure that I did or didn't.\nHowever, it happened two times afterwards, same as in the screen shot, and those two times I was away.\nI have since updated versions per Luke's suggestion and I will keep an eye out.\n. Sure thing.\nI updated but forgot to hit the restart to complete button. So it has been running the new build for about 10-15 minutes.\nMaybe tomorrow morning?\nAlso maybe I will figure out how to share the log folder via drop box so it can just be accessed often with the all the logs...I think that's doable. \n. No crashing.\nSo just a standard uninstall? Just a note, I had to install the microsoft product with it as well.\nAlso just use the link you had sent in a PM to download again or is there a page I can find links to releases?\nI will get to this later maybe at lunch when I have some free time.\n. .net framework 4.5 and Visual c++ 2010\nWhen selecting MB-server to uninstall, before I even select any boxes, I get the error \"this program might not have uninstalled correctly\".\nI thought maybe it was because it was running. Exited MB-server, tried again and same message.\nAfter uninstall, the icon stayed in the programs list.\nAnyways, I installed just fine. But about 5 minutes after initial setup of libraries and being just at the dashboard I got another unhandled exception and on the bottom a message about not being able to connect to the MB repository.\nIt crashed though this time when attempting to go to other pages, like Plugins, I get error loading page instead of just a blank page on my web browser.\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/u0v3o6fn82f9cva/Server-635000694996558159.log\n. Ok, finally got time today to play around. I installed the windows update.\nInstalling MB-Server went well. One small thing, when selecting my music directory I hit ok or proceed when selecting the directory, but nothing happened. I closed out of the window and the directory I selected was there anyways. This did not happen when previously selecting my movies and tv series directories which are located on the same network share.\nAnyways, things look good after initial setup, I can see the percentage change now while scanning the library which it previously did not.\nNo errors or crashes thus far, I'll take a look again in the morning.\nAnything else to check for let me know.\n. I posted this in the development forums, so here is a copy and paste of what I observed:\nthis morning and now this update tonight, I get the dialog box that says \"shutting down media browser server\" that doesn't leave.\nAlso at the bottom of web interface it still asks to restart the server to finish the update.\nSo what I did this morning and this evening is click cancel on the dialog box, click ok on the message about canceling installation, then re-open mb theater and everything appears fine and up to date.\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/h9tx0pioivrnq8h/Server-635006017611017142.log\nAlso if it matters, I initiated the update from my laptop rather than directly at the machine it is running on.\n. Yes, update this morning was successful and without the same errors mentioned here.\nThanks\n. Hey ebr,\nI've noticed this again this morning. \n. To be honest I am not sure. This morning when I got to work, I went to the dashboard and noticed a pending restart message at the bottom. I hit it and noticed nothing was happening. Logged into my server and saw the shutting down message.\n. Ok, I'll keep an eye out for the next update. \nMaybe you want to log into the server to observe as I update?\n. https://join.me/657-285-400.\nWhenever you feel like it. \n. heh, well the more the merrier. \n. ebr if you got a second I still can't re-install. Command is not open either. \n. Are updates set to being automatic?\nI woke up today and noticed my web dashboard is asking me to restart to finish updating...and I am about 99% sure I didn't hit update late last night.\n. Ok, I was waiting for a new update to maybe show ebr while the update was running.\nAnyways I hit restart, a mediabrowser installer window popped up then I hit ok, it went away...then I had the restart to finish message another two times...but no shutting down media browser box.\n. With the latest update the install looked ok. \nAfter I had to restart the server I got an error: \"There was an error launching Media Browser. One or more errors occurred.\"\n. https://www.dropbox.com/s/ftl0lq8yyowzi1w/Server-635012021807718470.log\n. https://www.dropbox.com/s/84bxyek3amhe9eu/Server-635012124751916025.log\n. Hmm yea didn't really think so but wasn't 100% sure. I've had bad luck with updates recently.\nDeleted trailers, didn't fix it. Deleting youtube plugin fixed it though. \n. The restart to finish update this morning went smooth. Nothing like yesterday.\nI had done so again from off site on my port forwarded address but this time kept a teamviewer session open to monitor if any errors pop up while the update occurs. I will continue to do it this way just in case anything was missed the first time it occurred.\n. @ebr11  And I assume it will notify myself? Or just keep an eye on the revision numbers? \n. ",

Ok figured it out. I changed the HTTP port directly in the config file, which somehow was being cached despite deleting the file between installs. This caused the server to try start on  port for which it didn't have permission. Used netsh command to add this port to the http listeners and it worked. Have reverted to 8096 and still works.

    "tikuf": "Aart and Boris here are some parameters for you for hls. I'm not sure that there is currently provision in the api for a stream of 64kb (no video)  (I suspect Luke will correct me if there is) but apple have this as a requirement to get the app in the store.\nHls Settings\nBitrate Pairs & Resolutions \nA 64000,V (nil), (no video param This is not in the server yet I don't think)\nA 64000, V 150000,MaxWidth=640,MaxHeight=360\nA 96000, V 300000, MaxWidth=640,MaxHeight=360\nA 128000, V 1000000, MaxWidth=1280,MaxHeight=720\nA 128000, V 1500000, MaxWidth=1920,MaxHeight=1080\nA 192000, V 2000000, MaxWidth=1920,MaxHeight=1080\nA 192000, V 2500000 , MaxWidth=1920,MaxHeight=1080\nThe max widths and heights are only a guide and can be altered at your discretion (they are currently imho resolutions at which the videos are view-able) Obviously a 1080p stream will not be able to have a bitrate of 100kb p/s.\nVideo codec will always be h264 for hls.\nAudio codec can be either mp3 or aac {AC}.\nRecommend 2 Chanel (if you are coding for a device that has surround capabilities then 6 chan can be used but only with aac) {CH}.\nAudio sample 44100 {ASR}.\nSo your basic url will be something like>\nhttp://{server}:8096/mediabrowser/Videos/{id}/stream.m3u8?VideoCodec=h264&VideoBitRate={V}&MaxWidth={W}&MaxHeight={H}&AudioCodec={AC}&AudioBitRate={A}&AudioChannels={CH}&AudioSampleRate={ASR}\nThe top video setting should be considered as a max value due to apple requirements that segments be under 5meg this will probably not be much of an issue since the top 3 settings should only be for a home network but I think we should stay within their spec.\nUsers will have to be mindful that their upload on the network the server is on will have to be able to sustain the upload rate with this in mind the middle setting may also be unsustainable unless they have a very fast net connection.\nAny questions don't hesitate to drop me a line here or on the board (or by messenger).\n. I have given imo are the max sizes not necessarily the sizes of the screens or the capabilities of the devices. Basically a framework for the boys to work within. Our house has just gone completely droid so I have no devices to test on. I am sure they have a better idea of device screen sizes/capabilities than I do, if not i will research some more. \n. To get the interlace/progressive flags ffprobe has to decode the video using the  -show_frames param it does this for each and every stream in the file unless you actually specify to run it for video only with the -select_streams v param.\nThere are problems with this because.\n1. The show frames is executed before any other options in ffprobe.\n2. There is no way to limit the output (ie the number of frames) that ffprobe returns info for it does the whole film not matter what (loads of requests to change behavior but no movement from ffmpeg devs).\n3. The returned info is not always correct although it is for the most part).\n4. Using the -select_streams v will return no info for audio or subtitle streams.\nhere is a sample of what ffprobe puts out for every video frame in the video (below is progressive)\n        {\n            \"media_type\": \"video\",\n            \"key_frame\": 1,\n            \"pkt_pts\": 1048559,\n            \"pkt_pts_time\": \"11.650656\",\n            \"pkt_dts\": 1048560,\n            \"pkt_dts_time\": \"11.650667\",\n            \"pkt_duration\": 3753,\n            \"pkt_duration_time\": \"0.041700\",\n            \"pkt_pos\": \"964\",\n            \"pkt_size\": \"573445\",\n            \"width\": 1920,\n            \"height\": 1080,\n            \"pix_fmt\": \"yuv420p\",\n            \"sample_aspect_ratio\": \"1:1\",\n            \"pict_type\": \"I\",\n            \"coded_picture_number\": 0,\n            \"display_picture_number\": 0,\n            \"interlaced_frame\": 0,\n            \"top_field_first\": 0,\n            \"repeat_pict\": 0,\n            \"reference\": 3\n        },\nAs far as I can see the only way to get the interlaced/progressive status of the file would be to run ffprobe and return the usual MI the run it again with the -select_streams v -show_frames params (only) read the \"interlaced_frame\": X, output then kill off ffprobe once we have that value. I'm not sure we want to do all this for the interlaced/progressive MI but atm as far as I know its the only option.\n. Ffmpeg will accept a url as the input file so it is much the same as a local file. So with that in mind we will have to parse the page (or use a page parser that has already been written).

This means that if the subtitles are non utf-8 already ffmpeg can extract them and keep the correct encoding our problem here is if the subs are utf-8 and need to be a different character set\n. Ah i stand corrected. Zeranoe in his latest build has iconv support yay. means we can encode the subs on the fly to the right character set.\nUsed as an input param\nNow returns the correct encoding all we need is for the user to either specify the lang in the file name or assume lang from settings. (and a list of char sets)\n. I will test on the syntax of internal but since we are running it as a stand alone extraction it should be the same \n. yes syntax is the same \nIf we add the seek extraction subs should be fine. \n. I had all my folder images @400x400 and wmp overwrote every one with a 200x200 my embeded images are 400x400\n. @Luke not quite working as expected. I axed my full library and restarted first run took a little under 11 minutes for about 25k items (internet providers off-wow!) it only produced about 100 images in the audio images I re scanned which took a little under 5 mins and gave me all my audio images. So a basic scan took about 16 mins compared to 50 mins prior to your recent updates. Not sure why it required 2 scans.\n. No not installed. I will run again and see what happens.\n. I don't think it did looking at the lib explorer the same primary is listed for all songs in the album (not sure if this is changed behavior or not) . But based solely on the speed I would say it only extracted once. I will blow the lib away again and inspect the logs to confirm.\n. That looks to have got it Luke (I will do more testing). I just deleted the db file and the audio images for this test it ran through and extracted 946 images (for over 13k songs) in a little over 7 minutes. I will run a full test now.\n. Nope stand corrected the full refresh got 151/946 images on the music.\n. Ah right you are its a limitation of libvo_aacenc. we can have 6 channel aac if we use the aac codec which we may not want to do replace libvo_aacenc with   aac -strict -2  there are some bad reports about it but it has been revamped since. I will look into it further\n. Dlna is one i can think of which is why i was testing\n. There are a few sys files in the music folder that need to be added as well AlbumArt_{*}_Small.jpg ,AlbumArtSmall.jpg etc currently media library refresh from wmp triggers full music refresh in mb3. This currently happens when accessing dlna through wmp I know it would be a rare thing to access dlna through wmp but i'm not sure that a full refresh is warranted with system file changes (aside from folder.jpg).\n. Could we also perhaps add an option when setting up individual user libraries to copy from user x's library to save rebrowsing for folders allowing an easy way to have a subset of the default (or other) user.\n. > Do you guys see this on any of your android devices?\nNo all is good for me\n. Yes it is fixed in the server. When I asked you to test the other night I thought Luke has released it in a build. (it was night for me anyhow)\n. Luke all we need to do here is swap out the font Arial and replace it with Arial Unicode MS it will enable scripted lang to display properly.

This is due to the fact that the type of mp4 we are creating (fragmented mp4) doesn't look to be recognized by ios. we will have to use hls when accessed by an ios device.\n. They all have different requirements codecs/containers etc so while it works in safari chrome firefox it doesn't mean it will work in all yet.\n. I can repo it here now. I'm sure it was working last time I tested. I take it all is well at your end. FFmpeg fires then gets killed by the server.\n. Further tested this today and the command line is good as is the conversion and it plays in vlc so it something that has changed with either ie or the dash.\n. Well done Luke nice one\n. @Logos302 check %appdata%/MediaBrowser-Server\\cache\\encoded-media  I suggest most will be in there if you have been playing a lot through the web interface or one of the other clients run the cache file clean up task should clear it out if not you can manually delete. (if it is in fact the issue)\n. The subs failed to extract. Abo can I see the associated json for that movie (from library explorer)\n. I have tested our c/l with Abo outside mb and it worked. I was waiting for the subtitle seek before I asked Abo for a retest.\n. Jacklynee can you post the issue for Mark over at > https://github.com/RedshirtMB/trakt-mb3/issues\n. Luke if we can query the database for the correct aspect ratio as reported by ffprobe the fix is\nUsing 16:9 as an example\nWhere we transform the aspect from say 16:9 to 16/9 and specify the -aspect param directly from the database.\n. Luke hold off on this I may have an easier fix (not quite as good as it doesn't crop the black bars but it does get the right aspect). Just testing on chapter extractions now and its just an addition to the c/l no d/b query req.\n. Luke using the 90/10 rule I have scratched the above command line due to the fact that while it gives nice images for dvd rips and most videos it does crop the image in some instances which is undesirable. Aside from that it is a lot harder to implement and cost vs benefit is not there. Instead I have opted to leave black bars if they exist and just make the aspect correct according the the sar  so I am using these c/l with good results.\nLine 760 & 761 of MediaBrowser.Server.Implementations\\MediaEncoder\\MediaEncoder.cs\n            var args = useIFrame ? string.Format(\"-i {0} -threads 0 -v quiet -vframes 1 -filter:v select=\\\\'eq(pict_type\\\\,I)\\\\' -vf \\\"scale=iw*sar:ih\\\" -f image2 \\\"{1}\\\"\", inputPath, outputPath) :\n                string.Format(\"-i {0} -threads 0 -v quiet -vframes 1 -vf \\\"scale=iw*sar:ih\\\" -f image2 \\\"{1}\\\"\", inputPath, outputPath);\n\nwhat we currently have\n\nWhats the new c/l produces\n. I'm not seeing it either but that said bumping the extraction time by fractions of a second may fix the issue but it may also create an extraction point at a scene that is well past the chapter point (as it will seek to the next keyframe + scene change then extract).\nWhen they extract a image for the bd menu It would not be done automatically it would be a carefully chosen shot to represent the chapter.\nI'm in two minds on this I would like accurate representation of the chapter scr by the frame that is extracted actually being in the chapter but we have no way of telling that it will actually be achieved by rounding up the seconds. \nI would like the chapter times to stay the same.\nWe could try a simple transform on the extraction time and see if it fixes the error and get Adrian to report back to us. This will only effect videos with existing chapters not our generated chapters as they are already whole seconds.\n. Not seeking to a scene change increases the chances of black frames with the current code we are seeing less than .5 % totally black frames.I don't want to increase that which may happen. \n. I think we can leave this for now Luke and revisit if it is a wide spread issue as Adrian said he can only see it in one file\n. No problem just thought i would mention it\n. This is a good indication that the seek index in the video is broken or damaged. To test try seeking past the point that the chapters fail to extract in wmp.\n. @gcw07 Could you run the following for me. Shut down mb3 delete\nC:\\ProgramData\\MediaBrowser-Server\\data\\extracted-video-images\nfolder\ndelete C:\\ProgramData\\MediaBrowser-Server\\data\\library.db\nStart mb 3 up let it rebuild the library.db once that has completed shut down mb3 again \nStart the server and run the extract chapter images task and then post a link to the server log (if the issue isn't fixed)\nThanks\n. Generally not if we cant seek to chapter 3 (and seek would be the only real point of failure) then we should not be able to seek to chapter 4. If killing off the existing chapter images & db doesn't fix it I will give him a batch to try manually outside mb3.\n. Have you tried a manual extraction past the failure point? I wondering if a fast and slow seek my fix it? I cant repo here I am getting chapter images for everything I have looked at thus far.\n. The server should start immediately rebuilding on start up. This is not happening? \n. There are a lot just not as many as you may think (we pretty much get 2 errors for each item) still not good but not as bad as it looks from the logs.\nFirstly we need to find out if the failed files have anything in common (video codec for example). If you could choose some of the failures and look at them in the library explorer see if you can find common ground.\nIf you could test the extraction manually for me with the two command lines below.\nffmpeg -ss 600 -i file:\"input.mkv\" -threads 0 -vframes 1 -filter:v select='eq(pict_type,I)' -vf \"scale=iw*sar:ih, scale=600:-1\" -f image2 -y \"testimage.jpg\"\nffmpeg -ss 600 -i file:\"input.mkv\"  -threads 0 -vframes 1 -vf \"scale=iw*sar:ih, scale=600:-1\" -f image2 -y \"testimage.jpg\"\nIn the code if the first c/l fails we revert to the second so if you could mimic the server in this aspect .\nOpen a cmd prompt in the server program data ffmpeg folder (same level as ffmpeg.exe) and test a few of your failed files incrementing the -ss 600 by 600 seconds each run  (eg -ss 600 -ss 1200 -ss 1800 etc etc) until you are past the fail point. The \"testimage.jpg\" will be overwritten each time so check the image in between runs. Make sure you use the full path to the files you test when replacing \"input.mkv\" \nIf you see an ffmpeg failure can you tell me exactly what it says (or scr shot will suffice). \nThanks\n. Ok on that same file try running\nexchanging the input.mkv for the path&filename to the file use same path for output (input-new.mkv) . Then move your original file somewhere outside mb3 and rename input-new.mkv to what ever the old input was (in other words swap out the file).\nRun a refresh then run extract the chapter images. I am 99% sure it is a damaged index this doesn't always show up during playback as players are more tolerant than encoders.\nI broke a heap of indexes today for testing  and I was seeing exactly what you are seeing.\n. \"It only copied the first 2 minutes of a 52 minute long video.\" Ok that tells me that the file is broken (for ffmpeg anyhow) Basically means it needs a full re-encode (or attempt at one to try and fix its issues).\nIf you throw me a link to a text file containing the library explorer data I will write one for you to run.\n. It usually happens when the time stamps skip backwards or something similar. If you try to skip to one of the chapters that doesn't have an image chances are it wont play (if you transcode from the start it will work as long as the file isn't superbad). For the most part \nfixed mine (but i broke them on purpose so ymmv).\nA slow seek may work too (I dont know).\nBecause we are not logging the actual ffmpeg stderr I dont know what is happening to those files (but if we did that we would have 40 trillian ffmpeg txt files)\nCan you please  try the -c copy c/l on one of your failing files and see if it fixes it?\n. You don't need to re rip. Just re-encode (hopefully) now i know that you both are using the same program I should be able to repo. Tell me are the ones you are having issue with 1:1 rips?\n. It is the was makemkv does it it just joins the files together and the time stamps are all over the shop\n. Gcw this command line should fix your makemkv files so they are not broken for ffmpeg\nSame instructions as above just a slightly diff c/l it will take about 8-10 mins per full bd . Hopefully it works for you i created a few files with makemkv today and it fixed all of them. It may desync the audio so dont blanket run it yet. if it produces thumbnails I will play with the sync.\n. Are you trying it on the same video each time? If so please try a different one (that has the same issue with thumbs) that one appears hosed.\n. You could also try\nwhich should ignore all indexes\n. Ok these are tv files they may be a lost cause it looks like makemkv just slices them up without any thought to the consequences (I could be wrong). Please try on a movie that you have the same issue with.\nHow big are your tv files? I wouldn't mind looking at one to see if i can sort it (these question may be asked by other people) I would like to have a better idea of what is going on. (if you have a short one that would be great).\n. Well never say never but it looks like it the way the mkemkv cuts and splices the video (older versions of makemkv at anyrate). I have 1.81 that i d/l today and am running in trial created video that was not seekable and the first command I posted fixed the files so it was seekable by ffmpeg. I did notice in their change log for this version \"Improved compatibility of produced MKV files\". I will try to get an older version and see what happens. In the meantime it is worth trying the first c/l on one of your movies ( I don't think we can properly decode a tv rip). Unless there is a way for ffmpeg to seek using pts rather than dts (there has been some patches submitted but no commit)\n@ Eric yes it is a considerable time it could be staged but offering a user a possible solution may be nice\n. Correct Luke but more the way its put together.\n. Ya problem is it not just this feature that it effects. Do those items stream ok? They should.\n. Is that extraction past the point of normal failure for that file? At what chapter time was it failing before?  run it out to 3000\n. It sounds like it rewrites the indexes and the headers. Test seek in the dash. Good find hope it fixes them all.\n. Out of our control at the moment. \n. \n. Its not on all movies just some not sure if its my xml or not\n. \"People\": [\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"Danny Elfman\",\n        \"Role\": \"\",\n        \"Type\": \"Original Music Composer\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"Jim Lemley\",\n        \"Role\": \"\",\n        \"Type\": \"Producer\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"Pamela Pettler\",\n        \"Role\": \"\",\n        \"Type\": \"Screenplay\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"\u0422\u0438\u043c\u0443\u0440 \u0411\u0435\u043a\u043c\u0430\u043c\u0431\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0432\",\n        \"Role\": \"\",\n        \"Type\": \"Producer\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"Tim Burton\",\n        \"Role\": \"\",\n        \"Type\": \"Producer\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"Dana Ginsburg\",\n        \"Role\": \"\",\n        \"Type\": \"Producer\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"Mary Clayton\",\n        \"Role\": \"\",\n        \"Type\": \"Producer\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"Jinko Gotoh\",\n        \"Role\": \"\",\n        \"Type\": \"Producer\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"Shane Acker\",\n        \"Role\": \"\",\n        \"Type\": \"Screenplay\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"Marci Levine\",\n        \"Role\": \"\",\n        \"Type\": \"Producer\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"Nick Kenway\",\n        \"Role\": \"\",\n        \"Type\": \"Editor\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"Mindy Marin\",\n        \"Role\": \"\",\n        \"Type\": \"Casting\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"Robert St. Pierre\",\n        \"Role\": \"\",\n        \"Type\": \"Production Design\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"Fred Warter\",\n        \"Role\": \"\",\n        \"Type\": \"Production Design\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"Christophe Vacher\",\n        \"Role\": \"\",\n        \"Type\": \"Art Direction\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"Giles Keyte\",\n        \"Role\": \"\",\n        \"Type\": \"Still Photographer\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"Shane Acker\",\n        \"Role\": \"\",\n        \"Type\": \"Director\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"Elijah Wood\",\n        \"Role\": \"9 (voice)\",\n        \"Type\": \"Actor\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"John C.

Still present in 4-24. I will try to find out when the regression happened (it was when they introduced the data tag).\n. 4-6 was the last version that didn't produce that error\n. @ginjaninja1 Actually is quite a dirty file and needs fixing but ffmpeg shouldn't barf on it. Ginja how many of these do you have?\n@Luke can we add a little bit of code that just pumps the filenames that ffmpeg had issue with to a file other than the log. It will help us determine what sort of % we are going to fail on and give the user a list of files that may need attention\nsomething like \n//failure extracting chapter\n\"J:\\Bluray\\9 (2009)\\9 (2009).mkv\"\nIf we do this it will also give us a list that we can process .\n.\n. Luke can we temp roll back to 'ffmpeg-20130406-git-7775992-win32-static'\n. Ya its a bug in ffmpeg (the fact it barfs) but I will write you something that will clean them up\n.

Just to throw another spanner in the works if the subtitle file is already the correct charset and we then convert it to a charset then we make it gibberish.\nalready converted file reads\nIf I then run that through the converter again \nSoooo I guess we need to determine what the charset of the file is before we apply a charset conversion. This would probably be best done during the library scan. I don't think there is an easy way to do it.\n. That is correct everything should work fine if the charset of the subs is correct I only have limited files to work with. \nI wonder if we can work with failures? I did notice that ffmpeg failed with a specific message on some files that required charset change let me investigate that further an get back to you.\nAnd my research shows the same thing no easy way to do it I did find a few libraries but nothing that was even close to 100%.\n. Luke if we run a raw srt file through that needs a charset option ffmpeg errors with\n[subrip @ XXXXXXX] Invalid UTF-8 in decoded subtitles text; maybe missing -sub_charenc option\nError while decoding stream #0:0: Invalid data found when processing input\nI then converted the srt file using the correct charset In this case windows-1256 and re ran the ass conversion and it worked I have an ass file with the correct scripting.\nNot the most elegant way of doing it but i think we can use this?\nHere is the test file i used\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1349444/srt-file.srt\nI ran our normal ass conversion\nand got the error above.\nI then ran\nto get the orig file in the correct enc\nThen ran our conversion to ass on the output.srt.\n. Ya while not a perfect solution ffmpeg will at least tell us that it needs it (it wont tell us what charset). If we can read the stderr (it think its stderr) for that string kill ffmpeg if it is found and add the charenc and try again. (or test it on the library build and mark it in the database)\n. Extraction is going to be tricky we do need charset in some cases only (when it is not correct). I would think that most internal subs are already in the correct charset. I would suggest we leave it for now and get external working.\n. Ya i agree that the resume should be set for all and I do like that just not sure we should show it multiple times in the resume section.\n. Ya I understand but neither do i lol. I will close this now just thought i would bring it up\n. Cant see anything in the logs. But there are no log entries relating to subtitles at all so it looks like we are either failing to call for the sub extraction or it is failing due to charset or some other reason.\n@hanand2  A couple of things\n1. Are they internal or external subs? (looks like external as there is no stream listing from ffmpeg)\n2. Can you please post a link on paste2.org to the library explorer json entry and the subtitle file (if external) .\n. Yup ok it is likely it is a charset issue can you post a link to the subtitle file so i can see it please\n. Rename your original srt file and try with this one https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1349444/Beautiful%20Creatures%202013%201080p%20Blu-ray%20Remux%20AVC%20DTS-HD%20MA%205.1%20-%20KRaLiMaRKo.srt\nIt is most likely the charset that is causing the failure this file has the correct charset for Hebrew. Lmk how it goes.\n. @hanand2 you may have to clear the cached subtitles as Luke mentioned above\nmay as well del all the cached subs (they will regenerate) delete the contents of  %appdata%\\MediaBrowser-Server\\cache\\subtitles and you should be good to go.\n. Found the issue here Luke the seek extraction is failing on the c/l because the file exists we need to add in -y\nMediaBrowser.Server.Implementations\\MediaEncoder\\MediaEncoder.cs (L584)\nand L749\nJust on the off chance that the generated filename already exists as it does in this case..\n. Turns out it is not this it was just coincidence there is something weird happening.\nHere is how to repo.\n1. Start playback from start and activate subs - works\n2  Skip to any chapter (after step 1) - subs work.\n1. stop video\n2. start video again then skip to a chapter\n3. now activate subs and the spinner just keeps spinning no play back\nAll subsequent skips stop restarts etc will get you a spinner as soon as you activate subs. This will continue until you restart the server.  Can you test that with an external sub on your system see if you can get it behave the same?\n. Shark has no impact on what we are doing. There are actually 2 things at play here one is charset \nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser/issues/236\nAnd while I know something is NQR I'm not quite sure what. There are instances where the sub extraction is failing but I don't know what is causing it yet.\n. Yes half of it is half of it isn't. There is a problem in the dash that I cant put my finger on the initial problem was sub char set and ffmpeg failing as a result but there is the other problem with the dash that is separate from that. Hopefully when techy gets some time and update/rewrites player this may be corrected. (is there an on hold designation on git?)\n. The folder.png (or jpg) is simply not present in my user folder. I have uploaded a few times as well I was trying to find under what circumstances it stops showing admittedly I haven't looked very closely been trying to nail down something else. I suspect it is server restart. It only appears to happen to the single admin user I have set up(which may or may not be relevant)\n. @skynet600 can you please make one of the problem mp3 available for me to download thanks\n. @skynet600 this maybe the order in which things are done (as per the dev forum post)\n. @Luke are we looking in the VIDEO_TS folder for the playable streams? We are recording just the vob file names in the db and since we are mounting bd and just calling the directory with the bluray protocol we dont need the dir structure for bd we do however need it for dvd. I cant see anywhere that we are specifying the VIDEO_TS folder as the folder that contains the vobs.\n. Ya the c/l works fine and transcode is kicked off in the server. The preview window is not showing on first click. It was a bit deceptive the folder rip I was testing on didn't have any audio until 30+ seconds into the playback (which i cant see but i can hear).\n(Iso work perfectly now and are instantaneous)\n. ffprobe will report channels as 6 on 6 channel source\n. If we want to get the right number of channels from bdinfo we will have to take the .1 (or .2) and just add it to the previous number or just define 5.1=6 7.1= 8 etc\n. This is by design (ish) if the device consumes no media for a time ffmpeg quits so we don't have multiple instances transcoding different files (if you change your mind and start watching something else). We may need to alter the api so there is a distinct difference between pause and stop.\n. No it's not making them up. I would suggest its just reading a different version of id3 tags than the one you are seeing.\nOf course I may be wrong. Check all versions of the tag in an external program make sure that genre doesn't appear in a another tag.\nCan you run mp3tag (or what ever you used in the first image ) on the same song please.\n. This is bizarre but yes apparently there is a numbering scheme for id3 tags (I believe it is universal) but 50=Darkwave as you have discovered, 10=New Age, 19= Industrial etc etc. The name to number was invented I suspect to save space in the file. As i said I don't think it is just ffprobe/ffmpeg thing, it may be but I don't know.  \nAnyhow it can be solved by simply adding a  \"The\"  in front of your 50s,60s,70s,80s tag.\nAs this is something out of our control I think this can be closed.\n. Sorry should have posted here too \ndev forum\ntop bottom\nside by side\n. Luke are you going to copy the font to the font folder on the users system? If we specify the windows font folder ffmpeg scans it prior to every encode (that req a font) and the lead in time blows out. I think the font is present on a vanilla install (I haven't got one to look at atm) if so can we copy it to the font folder in %appdata%. To drop down the size of ffmpeg we could use the shared builds which save a couple of meg.\n. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6513633/c-convert-transparent-png-to-jpg-with-non-black-background-color\n. Luke could you use \u2714 which is   &# 10004 ; (remove spaces) or &# 10003 ;  \u2713\n. http://ascii-table.com/info.php?u=x2714\n. wow sorry missed this for 12 days. Not that i am aware of Luke unless we blanket remove wma from the probe\n. Just to clarify ffprobe can decode\nWindows Media Audio Lossless\nWindows Media Audio 9 Professional \nWindows Media Audio 1\nWindows Media Audio 2\nWindows Media Audio Voice          \nbut not wma pro10\n. @Genprelate could you please make that audio file available (download) for me to test with.\nTia\n. I found that same source and tried a few of the files (wma 10) and they worked ok with our conversions etc. I would like to get my hands on his file so i can see what the diff is. In any event I thought we suppressed those errors so i'm not sure why they are showing\n. This is done and can be closed\n. Latest server should fix internal& external ass/ssa/srt as playable (most of the time) internal pgs and dvd subs should work too.   There is just a bit of a bug which we are having issues tracking down.\n. 3.0.5031.21343 should have the abilty to use ass and ssa external or internal (bugs aside)\n. Yup I still have some work to do on ass/ssa. it is number 3 on my list.\n. Just to clarify it doesn't look to be doing if for all codecs eg ac3 is ok. DTS-HD MA, TrueHD both look to be affected there may be others.\nFfprobe when run externally produces the correct bitrate (on the couple I ran it on) meaning there is possibly some error reading ffprobe's output.\n. http://mediabrowser3.com/community/index.php?/topic/2788-server-side-encoding-settings/\nhigh cpu  - (as is now i think we could cut wait for segments to 1 or 2 here as well) would produce close to 100% cpu but allow seek faster in devices that support it\nmedium cpu - (threads 2) we would have to change the wait for segments likely to 1 would likely cut the cpu to about 20-50% depending on cpu (a bit less than webm uses now)\nlow cpu (use -re param segment length of 5 seconds wait for segments 1) cpu on most modern cpus would be between 5 and 20%. The -re is an input option so it would be ffmpeg -re -i blah\nfurther to that\nhttp://mediabrowser3.com/community/index.php?/topic/2280-transcoding-in-mb/?findpost=49992 (more up todate)\n. The issue is that dvd titles fall under the low bitrate which makes dvd video in the dash far less than it should be. The current settings are very low.\n. As Luke said. This happens due toe the fact he has cut the menu out on a full dvd VTS_01_1.VOB is usually the movie that plays behind the menu\n. Please mark as fixed \n. Done think I got them all.\n. ",

I did, but it didn't mean much to me :-( \n. OK, thanks.\n. There's probably a lot of useful info in the Github WiKi that users would find useful, Such as the Library Structure section (https://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser/wiki/Library-Structure).\nSomething like this should be in the CT or on the MB3 website.\n. @WWWesten, no I believe this just relates to ROKU devices. \n. Cool, thanks guys.\nWill this then show up in MBC correctly as well ??\n. Thanks for doing this guys, but even after the releases yesterday and the subsequent library rebuild, I was still not seeing double episodes being displayed correctly. \nSo, I went into each double episode in the dashboard and manually refreshed it and only then did it display correctly. \nBefore refresh: http://db.tt/XJYCnX7y\nAfter refresh: http://db.tt/CB2w2dW8\nThanks. \n.

Hhm... I already told Luke I'm not a dev but I'm glad to have the time to follow MB rebirth here. \nSo I wonder if the WMC API provides access to parts or even the whole engine/module of the album art handling functions? To make use of this would be a pretty good thing from my point of view as a Software Analsyst. Since I have been pretty happy with the performance of WMP11 and 12 when it comes to library handling.\n. well, I understand the reason behind that decision. And even though I don't know how good mono is, as an Engineer I love to have services available for multiple platform and my own choice. Very nice!\n. Btw, is this just pure technical talk on github or do you take general feedback from the community here too?\n. Is enhancing them automatically a realistic approach? From my perspective, and I have \"enhanced\" mine over the years by using automatic tools a lot. Due to the variaty of albums re-releases themself and the fact that there are tons of mp3 rips outhere which tend to cause automatic enhancemt functions to produce mayhem.\ndo we actually have our own player engine? does MB3 make use of some third party audio player?\n.

    "LordMike": "@ebr11 \nThe only thing in common between movie and collection right now, is \"id\", \"backdrop_path\" and \"poster_path\". :P\n. > With your changes, we will no longer get country-based release and rating information, images or any cast info. Is all this somehow working for you?\nI just made a quick test with my API. Calling the main /movies API with a language set, will also affect the outcome of the images and votes fields. As for country release info, this seems to be a list of dates for all countries, no matter which language we're requesting with - which makes sense since we never specified the country.\nBtw. do you know a movie with different casts for different languages?\nThe API doesn't allow languages to be set when fetching casts, so I don't see how it's possible for it to return different data based on any language/country property we set.\n\nAnd, unfortunately, that is about the only data that is returned for collections right now...\n\nWouldn't it make sense to handle collections and movies differently? Or maybe media browser doesn't store info on boxsets (like all movies in a set, in order to find missing movies).. (I really don't know, haven't looked into it) ?\n. > They were combined because, when they first implemented the collection data, it returned the exact same information as a movie.\nAww .. That sucks :|\nI agree, the previous form would have been better, but sadly the gods have decided otherwise. :/\n\nYou are getting full image and cast info from the single call? This is not how it is documented to work in v3. It is how it used to work in v2.\n\nIt seems that way. I have yet to find a movie with so many images that I can't get all. The feature I'm using in TMDb is the \"append_to_response\" which allows you to take any of the other sub-requests (releases, casts ..) and add them to the current request. I just add all the pieces we need :)\n\nI see now you are talking about the ItemType variable. Yes, this is a problem. \n\nI figured. I've moved it into the methods in question in my latest commit. https://github.com/LordMike/MediaBrowser/commit/e31b7e175ce223d3b80f24fa72578be9c6776d8e\nAppearantly I suck at high-traffic git projects. So I might have done something wrong while getting the upstream changes. I might discard my fork and re-do my changes in a seperate branch.\n. The saved json will not be preserved.. :/\nUnless we do some hack where we promote the f.ex. the cast and crew lists to the parent container, without disrupting the JsonDeserializer.\nIsn't there some way to make MB re-fetch everything if it detects an update has happened?\n. @LukePulverenti \nYour client already respects 304's and sends e-tags (I think it was that). The only thing now would be to extend the lifetime of a cached request. As you already have a central HttpClient implementation, I think we can do this.\nWithout any research, I would say a simple approach is to store each page we'd like to cache (perhaps under a certain size, certain mimetypes etc) in a directory with a form of {url-hash}-{etag}.cache. This way we can find them again. But this should be in another issue :P\nEDIT: I looked into your client, and it seems you're already using the built in caching. Adding a long-lived cache would probably require some manual work, as I can't seem to find a built in mechanism for this.\n. ",
    "Techywarrior": "We currently don't seem to have any indicator of who the default user is.\n. Aligned the filter button to the left.\nHid the version selection option for non server plugins.\n. ok, version selector should be gone for non-server plugins but still show up for server plugins\n. Server plugin list is open by default now.\n. Machine specifics: Win 8 premium\nI'd have to break my setup in order to reproduce but basically the problem is that the setup.exe installer is fine. The issue is when you do an upgrade from inside the dashboard (MB Server). This upgrade seems to be run as a different user or simply is changing permission on the files/folders inside the mediabrowser/system folder.\n. Do, just ran the setup/upgrade to show you a screenshot but didn't look at that.\nYou can see in the screenshot that setup.exe runs as my user (Craig Noll) but when the upgrade occurs from the dashboard it happens as the generic Users. The generic Users only has read & read execute permissions to the files.\nProgramData permissions for Users group is read/list/execute only\nEither setup.exe is assigning extra permissions to the user that ran it which aren't needed or the upgrade is removing them.\nI think this is really only a problem because I am editing the files themselves as I develop and not a problem for the average user.\n\n. I don't think a reasonable solution is to ask people to change permission of a Windows folder. \n. Is it possible that the log files are being created by the SYSTEM user or something like that? Not sure what other insight I can give you but I can test if you make any changes.\n. It won't let me mark this as in-validation but it should be fixed in the next build. \n. I don't have an iDevice to test my fix on but I think I got it. Check the next build and let me know.\n. grr. Both this bug and the fullscreen not working in IE10 are bugs in videoJS. It looks like someone has posted a fix for fullscreen on the videoJS github repo. Don't know when they will post the new build or if we should maybe build it ourselves.\n. I had the same issue with the folders being missing. I've had the issue before with auto-update but this time I am having the problem using setup.exe as well.\nIf this is the same issue that I was experiencing with the file permissions then you may need to consider moving it. What is the reason the program is in the hidden ProgramData folder instead of Program Files(x86) or even the /User/ folder?\n. oops. You'd think it would be easier to hit the big green button instead of the gray one... but Noooo... not for me!\n. @ebr11 dashboard-ui was missing, core(?) folder empty, and I think the other 3 folders were empty too (all in System).\nSorry, not at that computer right now so it's just off memory.\n. I'm not sure the best way to solve this issue is. The problem is that at certain browser widths we are changing the size of the plugin image.\nI played around with a few things and they have issues as well. It may just be something that we have to live with in order to make it dynamic for different screen sizes (mobile, desktop, tablet)\n. @ebr11 I think he is referring to when you add a library folder.\nI'm not really sure that this is needed tho. There really isn't a reason for someone to be trying to manipulate the files on the server via the web interface.\n@MrLinford Even if you created the folder you wouldn't be able to put files into it. Why not create the folder properly in the file explorer?\n. You only need to select the root folder of the movies. You don't have to select the individual movies. so if your D drive is entirely comprised of movies then you can just select D:\\ and click OK.\n. Not an issue. Sorry.\n. Yea, I was worried about the performance. On desktop you don't even notice it but the number of new DIVs was a concern. I think it's the rendering that's causing the lag and not the actual looping. I didn't rewrite the entire guide, I just \"fixed\" it so that shows actually reflected when they started/ended and some shows that were hidden would be displayed.\nI wasn't as concerned about the shows being hard to read right at their end because you can always hover over them and see the titles. Showing the current half hour may work but it would still potentially display shows that have ended (if it was only 15 minutes long). I think the better solution may be to display it sort of how I did but stretch the width of the current partial 30 min block to be the same width as 30 minutes. There would be a bunch of things to consider with how it will work however.\nBut, someone else can do all that. Since there was absolutely zero feedback from the people who could merge this either approving it or asking for specific changes or fixes I'm not going to bother spending time to rewrite the entire guide code to support a more robust solution.\n. Ok, well if it's actually going to be reviewed and (ultimately approved) then I can spend the time rewriting the entire thing to be more efficient.\n. I did some thinking and testing and I don't think that doing exactly what tadams88 is suggesting will work. There is a chance that no show is scheduled in a particular timeslot. Not entirely sure if I should even worry about that but if we looped thru the programs and there was a gap between two there would be a problem.\nI rethought the old method that was used and I think I have come up with some good changes. First I removed all the individual DIVs used for \"time slots\" and am using the programs to fill those spaces themselves and then creating a filler DIVs if there isn't a program scheduled (if it ever happens). This reduces a single channel's DIV count from 1440 to the number of programs (~40-50). I also realized that I was being stupid checking every minute. If a program is running nothing else can be on at the same time so it now won't check until the time the current program actually ends. This change reduced the number of times I looped thru the programs from 6160 to 152 (on my 7 channel system).\nI'll try get some more people to test and confirm that everything behaves as expected and then update the pull request.\n. My gut feeling is that having everything absolutely positioned would create additional overhead in browser rendering.\nI could do what you suggest with removing each program but not sure it is going to make a big difference. It's looping thru only the programs for the specific channel at a time so the array is only going to be 50-60 items at max. More likely it will be a lot less. On top of the splice I'd have to create a new global variable (which shouldn't effect too much).\nLet me know what sort of performance you get with the new update compared to the last test you did and we can take it from there (updated files are on the forum. I didn't want to keep making pull requests here to test. Or PM me if there is a better way to work/test this)\n. Good news, testing looks good with partially populated channels or channels with no data. I also stretched the first partial time block the same as WMC does it.\n(I'm sorry about all the lines where just the spacing changed but I couldn't fix it to match no matter what I did)\n. I've removed the last functionality that would cause 1000s of DIVs to be created. Now if there is no program at a specific time, or no guide data, I am finding the next program on that channel and making the spacer DIV large enough to fill all the space. Worst case scenario this replaces 1440 DIVs with 1 DIV at the expense of having to loop thru the list of programs for a given channel one time each time there is no guide data.\n. The CSS had to be fixed because the way it was setup before was that every 30 minutes was a block in the guide, that DIV had a border on it regardless of whether the program actually ended there. Then the program DIV was on top of that and hid the borders in the intermediary DIVs. This makes no sense so I changed it to have the border on the actual program DIV. The display is the same but it's more efficient.\nI also changed the width of 30 minutes to be evenly divisible by 30 so I could have a fixed width for \"1 minute\".\n. All the spacing has been fixed. It should be much easier to read the diff now.\n. Changing it down to 10 minutes will make it happen less but still won't fix the problem. Shows end at odd times not just on evenly divisible by 5/10 times. From looking at the TV guides of people in Europe it seemed even more common for shows to NOT end on a 5/0 then to end on one. \nI understand that simply changing the cell time to 10 minutes is simpler but my pull request fixes a lot of the issues with the TV guide besides just that. We've tested it pretty well and I got rid of almost anything that would slow it down.\n. dev branch\n. ",

For me 99% of the startup time is as mediabrowser enumerates its cache and ibn prior to getting to the system tray.\nFWIW i think theres not a 100% 1-1 to relationship between cache/ibn size and startup time. Startup time seems affected by how the cache/ibn was built re: metadata fetch and store configuration. Anecdotally if all metadata is removed, and MB3 is left to fetch and store all metadata in media folders, then startup seems quicker.\n. I store all my tv as seriesname (release year)....seriesname (YYYY). This use to help MCM with disambiguation\n. Just been testing moving over to full MB fetching (by removing all my local metadata).\nThose series which have (YYYY) on the tvdb primary title do fetch, no surprise, but this does confirm that the correct naming scheme is 'SeriesName (YYYY)' for tvdb compatability of such series not say 'SeriesName YYYY' or 'SeriesName [YYYY]'.\nSo perhaps the  tvdb fetcher just needs the 'pidgeon logic' of if series have (YYYY) and IF 'Seriesname (YYYY)' doesnt exist  then try 'Seriesname'.\nThis would allow all shows with multiple instances in different years to be 'disambiguated' and all folders on filesystem to be consistent (with their year of release).\n. tikuf i have 190 files=0.4%.\ncan you recommend a utility that will clean the offending files?\n. looks like special charcaters in general casuse the issue with songs and albums not showing eg.

NB search returns in fanart search returns web interface are stylised Keys, Alicia and Dylan, Bob in case that is significant.\n. I am one of those who traditionally liked the view by physical structure, primarily because it was easier to have a full complement of organised local metadata without blanks, but also for the practicalities of finding what you likely to be looking for.\nSince MB3's default by  'artist' view, i have gone to the trouble of tidying up all the artist tags and have been impressed with the fetchers ability to find obscure  artist image content (square ratio and high quality). It has taken me 5 days to clean all my artist tags to match lastfm and fanart with no duplicates/variations of the same artist/group, so I am now invested in this by artist view :-).\nI do think a by 'albumartist' view would also have its place; physical structure would be my preferred view.\nUsing the artist tags to download a full complement of bios and artwork is nice too.\n. no problem, have split them out.\n.

How can you tell what id musicbrainz is or is not giving an artist from this response please?\nthe one above was for 'The Flying Pickets' which was incorrectly tagged.\n. i notice on web musicbrainz uses 'The Flying Pickets' and has alias 'Flying Pickets'.\nhttp://musicbrainz.org/artist/9652d56e-ee75-4a19-a1db-6637a4f1bfbe\n. thank you, will try that\n. sorry for late reply, yes its fixed for me.\n. 1) i didnt have anything open in some other program. Having waited 10 mins for the file to show, i would have opened the explorer window to the folder, but nothing else. I do use tvrename to move the file into the folder, but its never locked a file open before. Tv rename has a 2 step process of copying the file with extension.tvrename and then renaming to the correct extension.\n2) Dashboard ui from chrome (on the server) and MBC were open as clients. I had also removed a few albums in mp3 and added them as flac rips..probably should have mentioned those and also checked if they were added. thats possibly the item not found errors.\nMaybe a one off but i thought it best to log it. will keep an eye out for it in future. \n. apologies for late response. I missed the requirement to turn on debug logging, have turned it on now.I have been looking out for the issue and there does still seem to be a 'gremlin' in the system. When the library seems overly slow to update, For the most part a scan library task forces an update of the library (sometimes a restart of the server is necessary).\nWhen in a stuck state Sysinternals process monitoring of the the mediabrowser.server process seems to highlight the same set of media files (music and tv) being accessed over and over again (by mediabrowser), so may be a helpful tool also.\nWill look out for the issue again and send the debug logs.\n. here is an example.\nSteps to reproduce\n1. Album 21 Singles 1984-1988 had in correct name accroding to lastfm.\n2. Launched MP3tag to change album tag and folder on filesystem to match correct album name (21 Singles). (changing folders is a consistent theme to reproducing the issue i think)\n3. indefinitely repeating 2013-05-13 08:50:10.4464, Info, DirectoryWatchers, Timer extended.\n4. update to album never reflected in library. (Would have been fixed by a scan library task i suspect).\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/84611964/MBLibraryUpdate/Server-635040276253651053.rar\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/84611964/MBLibraryUpdate/21SinglesProccessMonitorLogfile.rar\nprocessmonitor log seems to show mb is constantly hunting for files in old path, as well as constantly reviewing the file properties on the new files.\n(not shown on logs) once the library update has got stuck, it seems stuck for all subsequent additions to the library (eg tv episodes), new tv episodes join the list of repeatedly queried files as show by process monitor and dont show up in the mb library.\nFWIW when the scan library task kicked in, the library state was bought up to date, but process monitor continues to show mediabrowser trying to query the now gone 21 Singles 1984-1988 files and the newly located 21 Singles files, as well as querying for the new tv epsidoes that got 'stuck'.\nAfter the library scan task, The media browser classic client doesnt see the new previously stuck tv episodes as far as the 'RAL' is concerned (the files do show in the library though). The android client does see the files on its 'RAL'. a restart of the mb service is required to get the mbc ral updated.\nmoving whole tv shows between drives doesnt seem to cause issue.\n. no mp3tag up at the time,\ni thought it was a long time between server updates,- will try a manual re-download.\n\n. doh, update level got moved off beta, will test again and post logs.\n. So now running the new version it seems that it is the folder.jpg (in the move to location) the watcher is complaining about.\nSteps were\n1. use mp3tag to amend tags and move folders/files on album 101 (with 2 sub folders-CD1/CD2) - close mp3tag\n2. use windows explorer to move jpgs to new folder structure.\nwhen i deleted the supposedly 'locked' folder.jpg file in cd2, mb3 log complained about folder.jpg in the root of the multidisc album.\nwhen i deleted folder.jpg in root, mb3 complained about folder.jpg in CD1 subfolder.\nWhen i deleted folder.jpg in CD1, mb3 added/fetched the album ok.\ni then went back and used explorer to copy the folder.jpgs back in, this time no lock detected, everything reindexed ok.\nNext i used mp3tag to move Best of Willie Nelson. Didnt move jpgs, and problem didnt arise.\nNext i copied the jpgs (using explorer) and MB3 is now reporting the jpg is locked.\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/84611964/Server-635041114443855630.rar\n\n. whilst still in the locked state, i changed another album and folder, '(1985) catching up with depeche mode' to '(1984) Catching up with depeche mode', MB3 starting to complain about a .cue file being locked in 'Catching up with depeche mode'. (my album folders have .cue files in them).  deleting the cue file, MB3 started to complain about the folder.jpg in the same album. So its not just jpgs- but once its gone wrong we already know it stays wrong so that wasnt the best test.\nClosing the explorer windows didnt seem to have an effect.\nTurning off AV didnt affect.\nCould it be a false positive and in fact the file isnt locked?\nprocess monitor filtered to only show activity on the path of album with the locked file, shows no activity.\nPerhaps the fact that a restart of MB3 no longer shows a locked file, proves? that the 'lockedness' is internal to MB3. Also the supposedly locked file is editable and renamable and not behaving like a locked file.\n. Might have sussed a significant factor, read only files seem to wind up mb3 'the wrong way'\nI can make the issue happen just by renaming a readonly folder.jpg in the music library.\n. Has fixed for me,\n. I have all my folder.jpgs read only, WMP and WMC have a nasty habbit of resizing artwork down to 200x200 otherwise. That said i wouldnt need MB3 to overwrite album images.\n. view-source:http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/?method=artist.search&artist=The+Metros&api_key=7b76553c3eb1d341d642755aecc40a33\nsuggests the data is available when there is an 'invalid response'...could mb3 handle that?\n. re: When I go to that link it tells me the response has an invalid character in it.\nYes but on chrome (at least)  if you 'view source' it seems to  show that although there is an invalid character the data is available and made sense of by chrome when the format of the call is left blank rather than json.\nin the examples i have tested, anywhere there is invalid data... is in a part that is inconsequential to the goal of the search ie an obscure unmaintained artist with a similar name that youre not looking for in the first place. Maybe the parts that are invalid can be 'dropped' and valid parts checked for good results? in the examples i have checked the correct MBID data seems to be available.\n. your suggestion sounds plausible; Its v. interesting... your links above, is sort of the same link as mine...(when you click details) it confirms the same artist mbid as mine...so lastfm is reporting supposed artist mbids which are not actually confirmable by musicbrainz on closer inspection...\nDoes this imply that that the lastfm artist call is a bit too  flawed (in an of itself) to be used as a reliable method to find appropriaite values to send to fanart; (in time as fetcher improvement becomes higher up the development priority compared to more pressing issues no doubt) maybe the suggestion over making use/comparing of artist ids in the album lastfm responses isnt such a bad one, ...if direct musicbrainz is not possible...\n. If its  not by design...\non version Version 3.0.4882.1204, i still get this\n\n\n\n. Version 3.0.4929.18535\nJust Capitalised a collection photo ...to Photo. This seemed to proceed without error but the collection on the dashboard was still called photo. ie in the library configuration the change had stuck but not on the dashboard or mbc ehs..\n. Ah i was'nt sure it was the same, as when there is no folder.jpg in ibn, it still doesnt use folder.jpg in media collection.Presumably MB3 cant expect to find all metadata in IBN for artist if they exist in IBN as its more than possible that metadata is split between collection and mb3 ibn and cache? given all the metadata location possibilities.\n. Perhaps, as the fetchers have time to develop,  the highest match should only be used if it passes a 'likeness; test? On the throttling point, would it fit within the MB design, to have another layer of fetch, Ie quick & dirty to populate 50%, and then a slow check over time with musicbrainz. I think users would happy to accept that it took 1 week+ to build a more rich & acurate music library, if there was feedback that it was happening/coming along.\n. whether or not MB3 sees these last fm genres seems dependant on the metadata fetch config. they dont always appear, for a given metadata config, sometimes they never appear and id3 tag genre is the only one in sight.\nfor me... genres in id3tags is the only reliable place to get them from. even musicbrainz doesnt publish genres as they are too 'difficult'...(i read 'personal')\n. i havent watched it for longer than a few minutes, but yes the % seems to never change.\n. I was looking for 0 byte corrupt jpgs and xmls, (they used to cause a problem before i seem to remember)..none found. I was looking through the last tv to be scanned before the last halt. I found a season without any content, when i deleted it, some seemingly 'pent up' tv scanning activity came through and the scan task which had been halted for 20mins, was finished (though this might have been coincidence). will try and reproduce.\n. might be getting somewhere, just halted again 'near to' the good wife...found an empty season folder in the good wife...deleted...the scan task completed straight after (with a flurry of activity in the logs)\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/84611964/Server-635043983062141965.rar\n. and again for true blood season 6 (log above updated). Seems the fetchers dont like blank seasons. My Management program creates season folders as soon as they are published on TVDB, dont know if others will see this issue. Now i think about it as i tested music, i moved over to tv. and i was still on tv when i moved to movies, so perhaps it was just tv that it was hanging on...\n. Its not guaranteed that an empty folder halts the scan but since i removed them all, the scan task finishing and the lines saying 'sql delayed writer X commands'' seem more frequent and assured.\n. if others can't reproduce this, i am developing a theory that there is some sort of upper error limit for tv fetching. As i remove series with 4 digit seasons, and blank folders, more of the library is indexed properly. Its like MB3 is not moving onto the good bits of the library after it hits X problem areas.\n. Think this issue might be peculiar to myself.\nI was using old series.xmls from another fetching utility..\nMy series are all suffixed with Seriesname (YYYY).\nI had thought that these were ok since MB3 was fetching the xml for the episodes within, but on reflection this might have been causing MB3 an issue. The above still stands, but it may be peculiar to me as i was causing MB3 undue hassle (as it currently doesnt like 'Seriesname (YYYY)')\n. sure, but i wont be back to test until thursday this week.\n. I dont think i am having any library scanning halts with movie ingestion into the library now.\nIf i let mb3 download and save all metadata locally in media folders, then delete the database to get MB3 to index my library from scratch, the library scan completes but the library is not built properly\nScan task finished OK, no log activity for 5 mins, No disk, cpu, mb3 activity, but library is not built\n\nEpisodes do not show (even unfetched)\n\nlooking at the internet usage monitor and logs its seems that the tv backdrops are redownloaded unneccessarily.\n\nRan library scan again at 17:15 but this time it just halted. no disk activity, nothing.\nlots of running xyzprovider messages but no activity\n\nlog from initial library deletion and restart of mb3\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/84611964/Server-635049235103693836.log\nto scan task finnished, no activity and library not finished, then run scan task 2nd time, task halted.\nafter no activity for 2 and half minutes, with library scan halted, i  closed mb3 and restarted\nloads more activity, scan completed ok...more/all? of the library indexed/viewable in the dashboard.\n.\nactivity all stopped....ran the scan library task at 19:00...more library activity - shouldnt this all have finished after the (multiple) previously sucessfull scan tasks (which completed ok)\nlog from close and restart of mb3. past 2nd scan at 19:00 to 2nd scan activty finish @ 19:09, through 3rd scan at 19:10, 3rd scan completes at 19:11. mostly previously errors in 3rd scan but still some separate library activtiy?\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/84611964/Server-635049264742219063.log\nsummary conclusions of potential problems\n1) the scan task halting,\nperhaps these should go into separate issues?\n2) the scan task completing but not being effective (the librarys not showing content)\n3)  the scan task re-evaluating unchanged media which should have finished with ingestion a long time ago.\nFWIW heres an example from before of what the logs look like when i delete a blank season folder.\nThe scope of the impact, looking at the log messages, is much wider than expected? - other seasons in the series are checked? or enumerated?\nsee log following\n2013-05-23 09:04:51.2364, Info, DirectoryWatchers, Watcher sees change of type Deleted to T:\\TV2\\Stargate SG-1\\Season 11.\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/84611964/Server-635048947654692693.log\n. with log window disabled it does seem more assured. no halts reproducible (tv ingestion, no blank folders).\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/84611964/Server-635050282612103712.log\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/84611964/Server-635050367999996598.log\n. I never used MB2 to fetch so i cant say. I am hoping that MB3 will be the version that allows me to ditch my flakey 3rd party utility.\n. In case you hadnt guess it..this is the consequence it seems..namely the image is downloaded onto filesystem but not ingested. and the episode xml is downloaded but not ingested.\n\n\n\n. CDATA issue withstanding, it was good (but of course not crucial) that the tags did come through and the dashboard ui seemed to understand them, eg italicised words preserved.\n\n. apologies just realised drop box compresses automatically..tried pastebin but logs were too large.hopefully this is convenient.\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/84611964/Server-635045471499480890.log\nHi Luke,\n'northern exposure1' is what i temporarily named 'northern exposure' to, to nudge it on, my issue was  with 'northern exposure'. All things being equal mb3 should not and does not have a problem determining series id for 'northern exposure' (as this is what it is named on tvdb).\nThe problem i am seeing, as these logs today seem to show, that MB3 is stuck not determining series ID for many shows. Correct or incorrect log entries aside, there is no xml in these tv series folders (for series or episodes).\nThis was all from a pristine fresh build with no preexisting xml and a fresh install of mb3 (deletion of cache/library at any rate), and metadata configured to be stored in media folders. So possibly in a best case scenario for MB3, MB3 seems to have got stuck. I say stuck because it seems compelling when just by renaming a tv series and then renaming it back again to the 'exact same name as original', MB3 is now fetching that tv series (where previously it would not fetch, no matter how many times I scanned the library or restarted Mb3 and now its seems waiting until the next day). I will try another fresh build of the library, maybe this was a one off.\nthis was a log from the build showing the tvdb timeouts (the normal ones i think when the api starts throttling the client).\nI couldnt find the exact one where the original  northern exposure fetch failed, but i think they were all similar..\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/84611964/Server-635045033186356691.log\nand an earlier one showing more timeouts.\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/84611964/Server-635044897955231913.log\n. thanks for confirmation/info.\n. hi luke, the genre tag is\n\"Drum 'n' Bass\"\n. strange i can reproduce 100%\nchanged tag to \"drum 'n' bass\"\n\nfolder \"drum 'n\" created in ibn (it has no folder.jpg)\n\nunexpected url? for genre \"drum 'n' bass\" in dasboard re 1st ' is escaped but not second\n\n. scratch that its seems affected by whether there is a genre folder drum 'n' bass already created before mb3 detects a track with that genre.\n\n. just reproduced the following symptoms.\n1. No drum 'n' bass genre folder.\n2. existing content modified to drum 'n' bass genre\n3. MB3 creates ibn\\genre\\drum 'n' bass\n4. copied folder.jpg to drum 'n' bass.\n5. quit mb3\n6. restarted mb3\n7. waited a  while\n8. drum 'n folder created in ibn\\genre (without any changes to content)\n. the same unexpected value eg avantgarde for tracks with 90s genre\n. yup ffprobe is making up these genres it seems\n\n. I thought it might be accessing a different tag too; if i use mp3tag to change genre from '90s' to 'testgenre', ffprobe sees the genre as 'testgenre' and if i use mp3tag to put it back to '90s', ffprobe sees it as 'avantgarde'.\n\nThe id3v1 tags are not populated, nor ape. so its seems ffprobe is hardcoded to see 90s as avantgarde.\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/84611964/01.%20Breakfast%20At%20Tiffany%27s.mp3\n. you learn something every day :-) thanks for confirmation, will use a prefix as you suggest.\n. yup, looks good now\n. I agree ';' would be safest as a 'blanket' setting. Of my 8000 artists none have a ';'. '/' i think is more compatible / commonly used, but this would require an exceptions list as it is used in real artist names. Windows media player seems to maintain an exceptions list and use '/' as separator (AC/DC still registers 'properly').\n. If an exception list is too much for the benefit, then i think ';' would be better than '/' because 1. all MY music clients understand ';' as a separator and 2. none of my artists have ';'. But it would be worth checking with those other vocal music users and gather a wider consensus / get them to check their clients compatibility with ';'.\n. just so it doesnt get  lost i created a list of artists on musicbrainz with ; and / separators if it helps. http://community.mediabrowser.tv/permalinks/r/14291/65451/delimeter-on-artist-field#65451.\n. Luke i cant work out how /where to add my contribution to the whitelist of artists not to split. For the previous time you pointed us to a specific file (contributors.md) to go and edit. Could you get me started on what you need us to do to build the whitelist.\n. My first pull request, needs to be checked\n. its apparent im confused by github, i thought i had replicated the structure before...i edited it again to include your suggestion..but i cant see my correction :-(\n. thanks, its making a bit more sense...do i just wait now for an owner to accept or reject? is it submitted for review? do i need to close it to submit it?\n. my 2012 model supports flac..i assume all later do as well ..but have not done any investigation..maybe a second samsung profile is a safer way to go..that said the number of unsupported tvs must be diminishing towards zero over time\n.

    "Tharnax": "Not sure if Beta tester input is appropriate here but given myself and another beta tester (Jacklynee) both ran into this issue, I feel this issue t is going to come up often.  Personally, I didn't even notice the Network option when I first setup the server, I know the drive and folders my media is on so I went directly to the local folder structure.  Obviously, from both of our posts in the Community forums even with the UNC path warning, we didn't realize that had to do with how we setup our media libraries. Given the way MB Server and MB Classic is shaping up with MBT ont he way there appears to be the need for a more appropriate mechanism in place to direct individuals to setup UNC paths and not local folders if in majority of instances the ultimate player is going to be looking for the media on a networked device.  My $.02 for whatever it's worth.\n. ",
    "DGMayor": "I did mine as UNC be default only because I had the knowledge to do so from prior experience.  The idea behind MB3 was to make is so easy, you don't need documentation.   If you're not knowledgeable  about the way network shares, permissions, UNC paths etc work, you could run into issues by not doing this from the start.  \nI definitely think there should be text reminding the user to make sure their media drives are shared properly, but I do like the idea of translating them to UNC automatically and invisibly.\n. Would it be possible to test for shared access and give a message regarding that as well?  UNC paths are kind of useless when they don't have the sharing and user rights configured properly.\n. Don't you need your library set up with UNC paths for MBC to work on any other machine other than the one hosting the files?\n. :+1: \n. I was having this issue too until the update that moved the server into the user profile.  Since then it's been fine.  \nDifference for me was that I didn't have folder.jpg images, It was giving me this error trying to extract the image from the MP3's id3tag.\n. you're right, I lied.  I'm still getting it too.  I just assumed that I wasn't since the album art started showing up ><\n. Yeah I really don't plan on using MB for music since I currently use Subsonic for that.. I just populated 1 artist / 22 albums for testing purposes.\n. Going by Sickbeard's options for multi episodes, it supports these:\nDuplicate: Season 02\\02x03 - 02x04 - 02x05 - Ep Name.ext \nextend: Season 02\\02x03-04-05 - Ep Name.ext\nExtend (limited): Season 02\\02x03-05 - Ep Name.ext\nExtend (Limited, E-prefixed): Season 02\\02x03-E05 - Ep Name.ext\nRepeat: Season 02\\02x03x04x05 - Ep Name.ext\nRepeat (Separated): Season 02\\02x03 - x04 - x05 - Ep Name.ext\n. Would it be possible maybe to have the resume point creation fire off when something is paused as well as stopped?  That way if this does occur, you will resume where you paused, and not at the previous resume point.\n. Then it's not working ;)  When this happens, it goes back to the previous resume point, not when it was paused.\n. The only place so far I've experienced this was in the web client.\n. I'd rather not LOL \n. Not the name in question, but say if the folder was Jon And Kate Plus 8 vs Jon and Kate Plus Eight.  Bad example because I'm not talking about a specific TV show, but just a bunch of files in general that didn't need metadata or anything..\n. Just tested it again, same results (no thumbails)\n. http://paste2.org/6L59H80P\nStarted a new log, hit video image extraction, and that's what I get.  Never touches the other user's collection (the one that isn't being extracted).\n. So I logged in with the user with a custom collection and ran video extraction and it worked, but it won't work as me.\nThis didn't work in prior versions.\n. I still have to log in as the user and manually run them out they don't happen.\n. That seems like an unpleasant fix.  Probably should though, since I'm still having MBC not update one of my collection RAL's, and I can't figure out why...\n. Just checked and it did work when running the video image extract from my main account.   I apologize for not checking sooner!\n. ",
    "Sinjen": "This one just got me when trying to test MBC. Thank god Redshirt keeps up with all the bugs here. I was about to go crazy. I run a vmware instance on the same server I run MB3 on. This may actually be why I have always had trouble with the functionality the UDP server provides. Should this be configurable by the user...even if only manually for those that run in to this rare case?\n. Luke, don't you know what IP the server app is bound to? Can't you safely just assume that the UDP server should broadcast that address?\n. Hmm, then if the UDP app is going to guess, why not use the IP of the server host name? At runtime you can retrieve the hostname of the machine you're running on, resolve the IP, then broadcast that? IMHO, something needs to be done with this before we have a bunch of new testers come on board. Right now, I have no way to configure Eric's MBC app.\n. I must not be thinking clearly and I certainly know very little C#, but are you saying that you are currently taking the host name and resolving its IP and using that for the UDP server for broadcasts? If that's true, I don't see how the wrong IP was broadcast. If that is not what you were saying, then can't you do something like this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1345676/how-to-get-the-server-ip-address to use for the UDP broadcast? Again, I may not be understanding something, but this seems like the way to go and appears to be trivial to do.\nBtw, I also agree that each client should be able to configure manually since firewalls play a part in this as well.\n. I admit complete ignorance when it comes to .NET so forgive me if this suggestion makes me look silly, but wouldn't one of these methods work in this case? - http://www.geekpedia.com/tutorial149_Get-the-IP-address-in-a-Windows-application.html  If nothing else, you could build a list of available IPs. Then present them to the user if more than one are found for them to pick from during setup? Or make it an advanced option.\n. Ah well clearly I don't understand something then. I can't reason out why the UDP server would ever bind to the wrong interface in that case. It would be nice to be able to run multiple nics and/or vmware on the same box without mucking up any MB3 functionality. How do other web servers get around this problem?\n. ",

Hello Luke,\nit is not theme-music , see indian movies in their DVD menu have extra which in MB3 called Spiceals with \"S\"\nNow under Spical folder i created a new folder called SONGS to put all video songs \n     \n. what is inside the specials folder?  a folder called Songs under that folder is AVI Video clip of 6 Songs from that movie \n. So it is not part of Theme-Music \n. What is this folder? http://www.imagebam.com/image/3ec234251869150  ?? That is Specials Folder \n. So let me understand this : under Trailers folder i will put sub folder called Trailers with trailer video and second sub folder with Specials ?\n. I thought Specials was a new add on sections for Deleted senses and extra from a movie like interviews \n. well that what i did \n. ok but no sub folder under specials only video correct\n. I see the point it is working now \n. Issue resolved \n. Hello \nHere is the Link for full logs \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/7iun6xc8thensrv/C6G06Pw3VA\n.

    "gcw07": "OK, switching from Stable to Beta release seems to have fixed it. Seems like it loads now. Closing.\n. That is it, it didn't have any local xml at the time of the fetch attempt. I deleted all the local xml data to see how it fetched it. However, seems the latest beta is grabbing data correctly for now. At least fetching all data, with the exception of grabbing double episodes which I don't think the internal fetcher has ever supported.\nThough it is not saving and creating local xml for the \"series.xml\" file.\n. OK, going to reopen this one as I've been playing around with it more and at times it works, others it just completely fails. The log thinks it grabbed the data for the show, however it didn't. The metadata directory is completely empty.\nLogfile\n. Well that is what I'm saying. It doesn't even attempt to remote fetch the data even though the directory is empty. It is like the data is cached and it thinks the xml is still there, but it isn't. Yes, the permissions are correct. I've double checked that.\n. OK, when I restarted the server, upon first scan it picked it up fine, grabbed the data and saved it. So it works upon a restart, but not under a normal scan. Log from the restart.\nLogfile\n. Well it partly seems repeatable. Go into one of your TV Series and delete the base info out of it, including the xml, images, etc. Just leave the season stuff alone. If you try to run the library scan and even if you reset, it doesn't seem to pick it up. It seems like it is cached.\n. OK, just found a way to fix it, but not sure what happens. If I open up the library explorer and do a \"force refresh\" on the show, the next time I run the library scan it will fetch the data from the server.\n. Just going into the directory and deleting. Yes, the watcher was picking up a change, but that didn't help the fetcher. However, at the moment the latest release (that you did earlier today that installed Pismo), seems to be doing a much better job of picking up the change and fetching the data. I'll keep going through my collection and testing this and if it comes up again, let you know. Thanks.\n. Well, I waited 15 minutes and watchers never caught the change. I wonder if this is partly related to issue #184. All my data is on a NAS. The only way I was able to trigger the fetcher was to do a library scan. It did pickup the removed files and fetched the data. It has been more reliable lately. I don't know why it all of a sudden started working and if there was any changes I made on my end or if it was just some bad directory permissions or something.\nLogfile\n. Well having to just manually run the scan after adding/updating files isn't bad. I mean I'm used to it with using an external fetcher in the past. As long as the scan picks up the change it if fine. This also explains why a couple times as soon as I deleted them it did fetch the data right away, but majority time not.\nDoes the registry fix make virus scanners flag and quarantine MBS? Thanks.\n. Yeah, if it is safe, I'd love to try it out. Thanks.\n. I'm fine with closing it for now. If it pops up again I'll try to get some more logs and try to duplicate it, but so far I haven't been able to duplicate it with the most recent build. Still would like to see that registry change. Thanks.\n. Yeah worth trying. Thanks for looking it up.\n. Seems Windows 8 removed those registry entries, so it won't work for me. But thanks for looking it up.\n. +1 for hd tv logos especially. Been using them for a while now (with MB2) and they often just appear more crisp then the original low res ones.\n. If you are going to redesign the fetchers another nice feature would be support for multiple TV episodes in one file (eg. s01e01-e02). I think most of the external meta grabbers will get the data properly, but would be nice if the internal fetcher did too.\n. WMP won't open a mkv, so not really an option. But seeks fine in MPC-HC.\n. Is there any other method of testing?\n. OK, tried it out on my HTPC (which is the only computer I have setup to play MKV's in WMP and isn't not the server), tested out the files it errored on. No problems seeking past the points. So don't think it is that problem.\n. I did see this and I will try what tikuf suggested and post the logs. Just been busy so it will have to be a little later today.\n. @tikuf is it supposed to rebuild the library.db right away? It hasn't recreated that file after 20 minutes.\n. No it wasn't. It is a permissions problem that popped up earlier with updating the server software.\nhttp://community.mediabrowser.tv/permalinks/r/13546/55493/mb3-server-beta#55493\nI restarted the server as an administrator and it finally created the library.db file. I'll get a log on the other problem soon now.\n. OK, it still failed. Here is the log. Lots of errors reading the files it seems, yet no problems seeking on them.\nLogfile\n. I don't see anything as far as codec that is different from ones that work. Basically they are h264 videos. I have others of the same codec that extracted fine and then those that didn't. All the failures do look like h264 videos though. I haven't come across one that is anything else yet. I'll work on the manual extraction and report back.\n. Getting the message \"Output file is empty, nothing was encoded (check -ss / -t /frames parameters if used)\". Even if I reduce the seconds down it still says that.\n. OK, tried reducing it to 0 and then jumping up by 60 seconds instead. 0 created a blank image like it should. 60 created an image, but also had some errors:\n[h264 @ 03ff4400] reference picture missing during reorder\n[h264 @ 03ff4400] Missing reference picture, default is 65556\n[h264 @ 03ff4400] reference picture missing during reorder\n[h264 @ 03ff4400] Missing reference picture, default is 65556\n[h264 @ 03ff4400] reference picture missing during reorder\n[h264 @ 03ff4400] Missing reference picture, default is 65556\n[h264 @ 03ff4400] reference picture missing during reorder\n[h264 @ 03ff4400] Missing reference picture, default is 65556\nframe=    1 fps=0.0 q=0.0 Lsize=N/A time=00:00:00.04 bitrate=N/A dup=0 drop=8\nvideo:21kB audio:0kB subtitle:0 global headers:0kB muxing overhead -100.101875%\n. That did not copy the entire file. It only copied the first 2 minutes of a 52 minute long video.\n. @ebr11 it does appear the user has the permissions set, but shouldn't the installer/updater reset those permissions just in case any are wrong? And no idea if an updater can even reset permissions like that.\n. https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0pNvArEEZ2SZFpXS1dxUF9kYkk/edit?usp=sharing\nDifferent file from the 52 minute video, but same problem.\nRe-encoding 30 to 40 files is probably not in the cards. But good to know what is is.\n. @LukePulverenti that is what I also use to rip my files and all the \"bad\" ones appear to be blu-ray rips from MakeMKV. Re-ripping the bad movies wouldn't be that horrible for me, but re-ripping the TV series is the time consumer as most of the broken ones are entire seasons of episodes.\n. I'm not sure what 1:1 rips are. I usually just go in, select the highest quality audio track and sub track (eg. DTS-HD and DTS; or DD-MA and DD), remove all subtitles and go. \n. OK, so I re-ripped The Hobbit as that was one of my files that was broken. While it now gets a little further along (10 minutes in instead of the 5 it was failing at), it still doesn't work. Not sure what to do, but don't think re-ripping will fix it.\n. Just tried it. It only created about a 4 minute long video (from a 3 hour movie). Basically I think it stops at the same point the thumbnail stops working.\n. Tried it on a different file. It stopped early too (2 minute mark of a 52 minute file). Tried the other command and it did the same. Just ends early.\n. I've tried it on movie files and tv files. Does the same exact thing for both. At the point the thumbnails stop producing, the copy stops. I've even tried re-ripping a movie and trying it on that. It fails too.\nThe smallest one I have is 4.5 GB. Not sure how I could transfer something that large to have you check out and test.\n. @tikuf I am using 1.81 and tried re-ripping a movie and trying the command on it and it still stopped at a few minutes into the file. Just sounds like MakeMKV and this feature aren't going to be too compatible. Lot of work trying to figure this out when %40 of them are blacked out images anyways. Thanks for looking into it and trying.\n. I haven't done a ton of testing of actually watching things through the web interface, but yeah I did notice jumping to some chapters didn't work. I didn't pay attention until we started messing with this chapter problem, but they are the same files as the broken thumbnails. So guess it does break more features then just the thumbnails.\n. I ran one of my broken files through mkvmerge. Basically just ran it through, no changes to audio, chapters, etc., letting it remux it. After I did that, running the thumbnail generate line on ffmpeg did work. I'm not sure exactly what mkvmerge does or how it would fix a file. Still gave some warnings/errors, but did create the thumnail.\nPS C:\\ProgramData\\MediaBrowser-Server\\ffmpeg\\ffmpeg20130412> .\\ffmpeg.exe -ss 300 -i file:\"G:\\Hobbit\\s02e01.mkv\" -thread\ns 0 -vframes 1 -filter:v select='eq(pict_type,I)' -vf \"scale=iw*sar:ih, scale=600:-1\" -f image2 -y \"G:\\Hobbit\\testimage.\njpg\"\nffmpeg version N-52045-g694fa00 Copyright (c) 2000-2013 the FFmpeg developers\n  built on Apr 12 2013 16:54:51 with gcc 4.8.0 (GCC)\n  configuration: --enable-gpl --enable-version3 --disable-w32threads --enable-avisynth --enable-bzlib --enable-fontconfi\ng --enable-frei0r --enable-gnutls --enable-iconv --enable-libass --enable-libbluray --enable-libcaca --enable-libfreetyp\ne --enable-libgsm --enable-libilbc --enable-libmp3lame --enable-libopencore-amrnb --enable-libopencore-amrwb --enable-li\nbopenjpeg --enable-libopus --enable-librtmp --enable-libschroedinger --enable-libsoxr --enable-libspeex --enable-libtheo\nra --enable-libtwolame --enable-libvo-aacenc --enable-libvo-amrwbenc --enable-libvorbis --enable-libvpx --enable-libx264\n --enable-libxavs --enable-libxvid --enable-zlib\n  libavutil      52. 26.100 / 52. 26.100\n  libavcodec     55.  2.100 / 55.  2.100\n  libavformat    55.  2.100 / 55.  2.100\n  libavdevice    55.  0.100 / 55.  0.100\n  libavfilter     3. 53.101 /  3. 53.101\n  libswscale      2.  2.100 /  2.  2.100\n  libswresample   0. 17.102 /  0. 17.102\n  libpostproc    52.  3.100 / 52.  3.100\n[matroska,webm @ 0255ab60] Unknown entry 0xF0\n    Last message repeated 1401 times\nInput #0, matroska,webm, from 'file:G:\\Hobbit\\s02e01.mkv':\n  Metadata:\n    creation_time   : 2013-04-27 08:16:36\n  Duration: 00:21:41.14, start: 0.000000, bitrate: 2099 kb/s\n    Chapter #0.0: start 0.000000, end 384.467400\n    Metadata:\n      title           : Chapter 00\n    Chapter #0.1: start 384.467400, end 698.531156\n    Metadata:\n      title           : Chapter 01\n    Chapter #0.2: start 698.531156, end 979.103111\n    Metadata:\n      title           : Chapter 02\n    Chapter #0.3: start 979.103111, end 1259.591667\n    Metadata:\n      title           : Chapter 03\n    Chapter #0.4: start 1259.591667, end 1301.142000\n    Metadata:\n      title           : Chapter 04\n    Stream #0:0(eng): Video: h264 (High), yuv420p, 1920x1080 [SAR 1:1 DAR 16:9], 23.98 fps, 23.98 tbr, 1k tbn, 47.95 tbc\n (default)\n    Stream #0:1(eng): Audio: dts (DTS-HD MA), 48000 Hz, 5.1(side), fltp, 1536 kb/s (default)\n    Metadata:\n      title           : Lossless\n    Stream #0:2(eng): Audio: dts (DTS), 48000 Hz, 5.1(side), fltp, 1536 kb/s\n    Metadata:\n      title           : 3/2+1\nOutput #0, image2, to 'G:\\Hobbit\\testimage.jpg':\n  Metadata:\n    encoder         : Lavf55.2.100\n    Chapter #0.0: start 0.000000, end 84.467400\n    Metadata:\n      title           : Chapter 00\n    Chapter #0.1: start 84.467400, end 398.531156\n    Metadata:\n      title           : Chapter 01\n    Chapter #0.2: start 398.531156, end 679.103111\n    Metadata:\n      title           : Chapter 02\n    Chapter #0.3: start 679.103111, end 959.591667\n    Metadata:\n      title           : Chapter 03\n    Chapter #0.4: start 959.591667, end 1001.142000\n    Metadata:\n      title           : Chapter 04\n    Stream #0:0(eng): Video: mjpeg, yuvj420p, 600x338 [SAR 676:675 DAR 16:9], q=2-31, 200 kb/s, 90k tbn, 23.98 tbc (defa\nult)\nStream mapping:\n  Stream #0:0 -> #0:0 (h264 -> mjpeg)\nPress [q] to stop, [?] for help\n[h264 @ 024d4340] reference picture missing during reorder\n[h264 @ 024d4340] Missing reference picture, default is 65657\n[h264 @ 024d4340] reference picture missing during reorder\n[h264 @ 024d4340] Missing reference picture, default is 65657\n[h264 @ 024d4340] reference picture missing during reorder\n[h264 @ 024d4340] Missing reference picture, default is 65657\n[h264 @ 024d4340] reference picture missing during reorder\n[h264 @ 024d4340] Missing reference picture, default is 65657\nframe=    1 fps=0.0 q=0.0 Lsize=N/A time=00:00:00.04 bitrate=N/A dup=0 drop=2\nvideo:28kB audio:0kB subtitle:0 global headers:0kB muxing overhead -100.077782%\n. Yes. It was failing sometime after chapter 0 and before chapter 1 image (at the 6:24 minute mark). It extracted images (with those reference errors) all the way to the end of the file. Running it out to 3000 gives an error since that is longer then the file (22 minute tv episode). No problems running it out to the 1200 mark. What does mkvmerge do to a file that could fix it?\n. OK, finally had a chance to test seek it and try even streaming past the normal point of failure. Everything works fine at the moment. Might do this for a couple of videos, but not going to be able to do it for all my files.\n. Wasn't sure if the latest build had anything done to the fetcher to fix this or not. I'm still getting the error. Here is another log in case you need it. If your still working on it, just ignore this.\nLogfile\n. I'd say this can be closed since a version or 2 ago fixed this problem.\n. Along the same lines, something like how fanart shows the background in the header would be pretty nice. Seems though it would take a redesign of the details page. Would be nice, but understandably a low priority.\nhttp://fanart.tv/series/75682/bones/\n. Here you go.\nLogfile\n. Try this one. Not sure it is it either. No matter what, that file has been in the directory for several weeks and it never has fetched the data for it.\nLogfile\n. It isn't. It is on a linux server. I did check and it didn't have write permissions (was set to 555 instead of 777). However I've reset it to 777 and tried scanning again. Still not picking up the file.\n. Shouldn't be. It scans the regular season folders fine. Just not that one file. I haven't cleared out the entire meta folder to see if it would refetch the rest of the specials folder.\n. Ran the file through mkvmerge and it seems to have fixed it. No idea what it was, but seems like it was just the file. Closing.\n. No, the directories were completely empty. Just the base movie directory and movie file. So\nDie Hard Collection [boxset]/Die Hard/Die Hard.mkv\nDie Hard Collection [boxset]/Die Hard 2/Die Hard 2.mkv\nThe fetcher properly recognized the movies. Downloaded the metadata. Downloaded disc, folder, logo and thumb images. Just did not download any backdrops. It even properly recognized the boxset, downloaded the metadata for that and the folder. Did not download any backdrops for that either.\n. Just added the 4th movie to the boxset. Did the same thing. Grabbed metadata, etc., but no backdrops.\nLogfile\n. Luke yeah I saw those lines too. Which is odd because it was completely empty. It is like it is fetching the metadata first then when it goes to download the backdrops, it rechecks the metadata exists and since it now does, it skips over downloading them.\n. Also, maybe this is a boxset problem. Maybe it is seeing the base boxset metadata.\n. I assume you mean, \"Refresh existing Images\" within the metadata / images configuration location? If so, no.\n. But I was getting some images. Everything besides backdrops was downloading.\n. Yes, I have trakt installed. Uninstalling now, but can't really test the restart feature until another update is pushed.\n. Uninstalling trakt did make it start working. Seems to be a trakt problem. I'll try out the latest version that he just put up.\n. This doesn't seem to be working at the moment. My Season 0 is still showing as Season 0 instead of Specials.\n. Is there a task to rebuild the library or is this something manual?\n. That works too. Just wasn't sure. Might be nice later down the line to have a way to do it from the dashboard, but I'm sure doing it while the server is running is a lot more complicated. \n. Actually, what do we delete. There are now some other similiar named files in the data folder\nlibrary.db\nlibrary.db-shm\nlibrary.db-wal\n. Thanks, I'll try it out again when the next release comes out. I just wasn't sure if it was related to that initial scan or not because even if you did a manual scan, it would pick up my library, but clicking on an item within that library would throw errors.\n. OK, makes sense. Tikuf and I figured there was another way for direct play, just weren't sure what. Thanks.\n. I can do a seek with the player. We just weren't sure what you were supposed to do with direct playback.\n. Unfortunately, I don't believe there is anyway to prevent the Roku from sending that. It is something automatic. This was a good thread as to what the Roku is expecting, http://forums.roku.com/viewtopic.php?f=34&t=36941&p=240244&hilit=range+request+header#p240244\nNot sure if the server could just ignore it or what, but it isn't something that is controllable by the channel.\n. Tikuf said to use .ts over hls as it was better. I can switch it to hls though. Just was doing what was recommended. Does hls send the proper header?\n. OK, makes sense. Was just doing what was recommended. Can make the switch easily and hopefully it should fix everything. At least it won't continue to create 1GB version of log files from all the errors. Thanks.\n. I made the switch and it is no longer throwing all those errors, which is great. One thing I do notice and it may be just fine and what is expected, but wanted to check with you. Getting some warnings on the url. That some of the parameters aren't supported. So just wanted to check to see if that is expected or maybe the url is incorrect.\nLogfile\n. Sounds good. Just making sure. Thanks.\n. OK, related to this. The tasks finally completed. I think the TVDB api is back up and running, but maybe it isn't. However, I added some files when it was down and now I can get it to rescan the folder and get the data for those files. It never created the metadata. Don't know how I can make it trigger to rescan the folder as a library scan doesn't seem to be doing it.\n. Does anybody know if TVDB is back up and running. I can connect to their website front end, but I have not been able to scan and get any data from them for a day. The server logs don't even appear to be attempting to call the API anymore as when it was and it was down it would show timeout errors. But nothing now.\n. Ah ok, that makes sense. When I originally deleted all my xml and recreated it a few months ago it did call every time. I did see that commit a while back when you switched over to the single series info + metadata call to reduce the number of times it was hitting their server. So it makes sense that it is cached and there was just a problem. Thanks.\n. I know you fixed this and not sure that fix is out yet, but for the life of me I can't get it to grab any metadata anymore. On the failed files or even on brand new items. It never grabs the metadata.\n. Here is a log for it. I don't know what changed, but metadata will no longer download for anything.\nLogfile\n. Not sure, but maybe it is related. All this started happening right around the time I deleted my library.db file so I could get the \"Specials\" stuff working.\n. Yeah, ebr I just got the email for this issue. Assuming my Id is just my github login name:\nhttps://github.com/gcw07\n. Watched a few other transcoded files and it appears to just be random when it stops. So it plays 2 minutes then stops, etc.\n. Not sure if this fix was in the \"Version 3.0.4917.16548\" that was just released. If it wasn't, let me know and I'll just wait. If it was, it is still deleting all parts early and crashing.\n. Maybe Cbers was watching a longer video. The longer the video, the more time it takes to fail. So for 30 minute shows, it fails after a couple minutes. The only thing that has changed on the Roku was a change from requesting multiple streams (like Roku suggests), to just one stream that you guys are suggesting. This all happened right whenever the cache was removed. I'll talk to Tikuf again tonight, just nothing more I can really do on the Roku's side at this point. From looking at the logs, it appears to try to grab a created segment, but the segment isn't there, so it just crashes.\n. Server logs where it returns a 404 because the file no longer exists.\nLogfile\n. Remember this is on fetching. So if you already fetched the episode, it wouldn't correct itself until you either deleted the metadata and refetched it or do a manual refresh on the item.\n. Spoke with Tikuf and it appears that ffmpeg finishes up and then shortly afterwards the segments get deleted. That or the HLS playlist reaches the end of the file marker and then caches the file. So it stops requesting the playlist file. Then the server things it stopped, so it cleans up after itself.\n. I haven't seen it recently, but haven't been spending a ton of time in the dashboard. So can't say it is 100% gone yet. I'll pay close attention over the next day or so and respond here if it is still erroring out like it was.\n. Have you guys tried just using a simple blank target to the form itself?\n<form name=\"_xclick\" target=\"_blank\" action=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr\" method=\"post\">\n. For when you get to that point and not sure if this will help, but here is the Roku encoding guide.\nhttp://sdkdocs.roku.com/display/sdkdoc/Encoding+Guide\n. That looks perfect. Thank you so much for adding it. Can't wait to add it into the next Roku build. I'll also play around with the CA and trying the new jpg format. See if I can re-enable that feature. \n. This thing is really cool and looks great. I did have a question about the format option. When switching an image to a jpeg from a png, does the server set the background color? Like for instance right now the background color is black. If it is set, I wonder if an option could be added to set a color. You could fake transparency on solid backgrounds by setting the base color to match the background color it is going over. Just a thought. Thanks for adding the overlay. Looks great in app.\n. Yes, the transparency from coverart. If you use that the switch from an enhanced image (CA image) and force it to a jpg. Well it has to place the file on a background. Does that make sense?\n. \nClear image:\nformatted as jpg:\n\n. I'm getting it as invalid at your link too. \n. http://sdkdocs.roku.com/display/sdkdoc/BrightScript+Language+Reference#BrightScriptLanguageReference-717ParseJsonjsonStringAsStringAsObject\nLooks like it uses a strict RFC 4627 validation. It is failing on that. I'm getting the same thing to fail on the freeformatter site too.\n. Downloaded the file and put it on my own server just to make sure it wasn't cutting it off because of dropbox.\nhttp://www.gwscripts.com/test.json\nThe error I get is:\nThe JSON input is NOT valid according to RFC 4627 (JSON specification). Unexpected character () at position 2916611.\n. Shouldn't the proper format for null values be either:\n\"Language\": null\nor\njust leave it off completely.\n. Well that is the area that all of the validators has pointed to. The character number is always right there at an empty language field. Though your right that it doesn't seem like it is a null field. It seems like it is a string but with bad data in it. Everytime I try to copy it, it seems to fail. I think there might be some hidden character inside it, but not having much luck figuring out what it is.\n. So I followed what the validator was saying was an error and traced it back to that Language field for an individual movie. As soon as he removed it, it started working. I'm not sure how or if we could detect the bad information that was in that field. I don't think it was just an empty field, but some special character that was corrupting it.\n. I can ask him to put it back into his folder to see how the server reads it. The server may be more lenient on reading things like that then the Roku. Remember this is the same json parser that can't read the large numbers in runtime ticks.\n. I haven't been able to reproduce locally, but I don't have the corrupt file he had. I've asked him to see if it is small enough to share. If it is I'll let you know.\n. So I contacted him and by the time I got back in touch, he had already deleted it. It was apparently an ISO. So who knows. Going to close this. Thanks.\n. I'm not using any other meta fetcher, just the built in one.

    "bartonnen": "I've seen quite a few where the image extracted is before the chapter point - if I start playing from the chapter point (which is at a scene change) then I don't see the thumbnail at all (it's from the end of the previous scene). I'm hoping that all you'd need to do is grab from only a few milliseconds later.\nAs an example - my copy of The Hobbit has 32 chapter points, the thumbnails for these time are all from the previous scene:\n00:33:14.409\n00:43:40.368\n00:50:12.301\n01:12:11.369\n01:22:06.463\n01:56:58.094\n02:17:59.438\n02:20:09.359\n02:22:59.112\n(all the others are OK though).\n. When using pre-defined chapter points is it really necessary to seek for a scene change? Isn't it possible to just extract at the defined time without seeking?\n. Just thinking out loud here: would it be possible to schedule a one off \"Scan Media Library\" for a few minutes later after a watcher dies? Or have a config setting that allows that behaviour. i.e. for remote linux boxes - a watcher just detects a change of some sort, and it schedules a scan for a short while later, then rely on the scan to find the new content.\n. Luke - what about deletions? e.g. Just deleting an Actor from the series metadata - will that cause the actor to be removed from the series in MB3 as well?\n. This looks to be working fine to me. I've added actors, deleted actors, split double names, and everything worked properly.\n. Luke - this is a related issue: when an episode has guest stars, their name(s) can exist as a pipe delimited list within the  <GuestStars> element, but they can also exist as Person elements (with roles) within the <Persons> element.\nThe current version of metabrowser takes the GuestStars field from TVDb and parses it into the more complete  <Persons> node.\nIt looks like MB3 is preferring GuestStars as whenever the same person exists in both lists, the one without a role takes precedence.\nI think you should use Persons in preference top GuestStars (with an episode xml file).\n. OK, I'll check it out when the next release is available.\n(I just noticed that my comment lost some of the text as I'd used less than and greater than characters around some element names in some places (GuestStars and Persons) - I''ve just edited it to make the < & > visible.)\n. @ebr11 this is working now, with the Persons list taking precedence over the GuestStars list. \nIt wopuld be good if there was a standard way that roles could be assigned on TVDb - I have noticed that occasionally roles in parentheses are appended to names, and that MetaBrowser parses these and splits them out properly into the Persons list. But according to this post the TVDb admins don't seem to approve: http://forums.thetvdb.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=9123\n. Here's a few other possibilities:\nI'm sure most users would have their local trailers and music videos in separate folders away from their TV and movies - perhaps another, easier, solution would be to put some sort of tag at the end of the containing folder name - eg. [music videos] or [trailers] - that way anything found under that folder could be included in a different view.\nOr, have reserved folder names (like\"Music Videos\" and \"Trailers\") where all their contents would be included in a different view.\nPerhaps this would be the easiest - against each collection have a checkbox that determines whether that collection should be included in any of the views or not. \n. So, how about the checkbox idea (last paragraph above)?\n. OK, I get it. It's just that so far I've only seen views at the top of the server home page.\n. This is working really well for trailers - exactly as I had hoped. But, there's a few issues with music videos.\nAs I have no other music in my collection, the \"music\" section (in the server client) doesn't appear (all I get is \"Movies\" and \"TV\"). I can get to the music section by searching for a video by name, clicking on the title and then I'm in the music section. \nIf I browse to my Music Videos folder in MBC (it's inside my \"Archive\" collection) - the folder appears empty.\nLooking through the log, I can see that music videos are still being looked up as if they're movies, e.g.:\n2013-05-28 14:57:34.5332, Info, MovieDbProvider, MovieDbProvider: Finding id for movie: Fatboy Slim - Weapon of Choice\n2013-05-28 14:57:34.5332, Info, MovieDbProvider, MovieDbProvider: Finding id for movie: Malcolm McLaren - Soweto\n.

Besides storing the extra episode numbers, the Overview should be stored?\n. Yeah I know, but what I want to know if I should also extend the Episode entity to expose the additional overviews.\n. But the issue here isn't recognizing multi-episode filenames, since the current remoteEpisode provider fetch the correct metadata for the first episode. It worked on a file of mine named But that's weird... the current remote episode provider pulled fine the metadata for a double episode that I had named \"Elementary - S01E23-E24 - The Woman.mp4\", but it only pulled the metadata for the episode 23 (since the double episode fetch is not implemented).\nSo, the first phase should be pull the remote metadata for double episodes, or read the double episode metadata on the xml provider?\n. Ok, I created the regex for the double episodes, the formats that it supports are:\n01x02x03 blah.avi \nS01x01x03 balh.avi\nS01E02E03 blah.avi\nS01xE01xE02 blah.avi\n01x02x03 blah.avi \nS01x01X03 balh.avi\n01x02 01x03 blah.avi \n01x02 - 01x03 blah.avi \nS01x02.S01x03 blah.avi \nS01x02 - S01x03 blah.avi\nS01E02-E03 blah.avi\nS01xE01xE02 blah.avi\nAm I missing anyone?\nOh yeah, it includes the changes for between x, X, . and -\n. Yeah, it handles them.\nthis is the branch:\nhttps://github.com/lalmanzar/MediaBrowser/tree/issue_286_phase1\nand here is the file where I added the regex. \nhttps://github.com/lalmanzar/MediaBrowser/blob/issue_286_phase1/MediaBrowser.Controller/Library/TVUtils.cs\nAnd the call is made inside the EpisodeResolver to set the IndexNumberEnd property. \n. Ok, I'll work tonight to change the regex to support those formats and make it also multiepisode friendly, like it should be able to pick it up even if the filename contains 5 episodes merged.\nI'll let you guys know when it is done.\nOne more thing, should I set another project in the solution for making tests? that way we can have the regex tested and verify that they work for all the formats we want.\n. Should we support only the ones from Sickbeard's? I think those are the standard ones.\n. I'm starting from scratch doing the unit test first. And I want to keep a single set of regular expressions for multiepisodes and single episodes names.  After I finish with the standard ones adding new ones should be easy since the testing will be there. \n. Ok, its done.\nIt's here:\nhttps://github.com/lalmanzar/MediaBrowser/tree/issue_286_phase1\nSomeone take a look at the specs to see all the formats that are tested, and tell me of any that I might forgot.\n. Nope, I'm not on the Dev forums. And I don't have other pull request. I did this issue cause it was in the category \"you take it\".\n. Yeah, cool. \nShould I take from the issues, or you guys have a board with stories on some other page (like trello or something)?\n. So, you want all html removed or should I only fix the CDATA? Cause the style is preserved and displayed correctly on the dashboard.\n. Close this pull request... apparently the rebase went weird... It shows files I didn't touched....\n. What file names are you using right now?\n. Ok, that's weird. The only way I was able to reproduce the error was with the Season item having the wrong number on the edit page. Check there for the Season 1 item and see if the Season number is the correct. \nIf not, change it and create a fake file like \"Family.Guy.s01e10.test.avi\" and see if that pull the right metadata for that one. If it does I'll let you know how to fix the ones that are wrong if you don't want to reset your library. \n. Yeap, that's it. Thanks for the info, I'll work on a fix.\n. @LukePulverenti I'll push a change directly to the release date and end dates storing 12/31/1900 when you save the item with the date empty.\n. Right now  it only detects. As far as I know the metadata phase is not yet implemented.\n. @LukePulverenti , only merge the name and overview? maybe we can also merge the Guest Stars. What you say?\n. https://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser/commit/fb4e1315de39195c3ace33fda160d95904a643bb\n. I'll take a look, I think it could be done really simple.\n. just got it working. I'm gonna push it. You can test it, and if it has any issue just roll it back. is a couple of lines in css.\n. One question, the seekPosition property will be in seconds or milliseconds?\n. I can't find any implementation for play previoustrack on the MediaPlayer object.\n. :P I put the wrong name on the commit, is the previousTrack that was implemented.\n. The thing is that it matches exactly as one of the multi episodes formats.\n. Maybe we should remove that format from the supported ones.. It isn't used a lot as conventional naming.\n. So you want only the tags striped.. No matter what they are. Right?\n. Ok.. so just strip anything?\n. Sure, give me 2 mins.\n. ",

Lot of times I see SD and skip over it. I only watch HD and Bluray quality now. :)\nEven while its transcoded, the quality of the file make a different though. Right?\nPlus to most common users (including myself until recently) 16:9 means HD and 4:3 means SD. They don't even care if its transcoding or playing directly.\n. Are you talking about?\nVideo:msmpeg4 \u2022 Level -99 \u2022 576 \u2022 432 \u2022 1017 kbps \u2022 23.976 \u2022 yuv420p\nAudio:mp3 \u2022 159 kbps \u2022 2 ch \u2022 44100 khz\nIf so it is pretty cryptic. \nI was wondering if there is any that is more in terms of 480p 720p 1080p. HD/SD and 2.1 or 5.1 information. If this information is already available can you please share swagger that returns it?\n. Not a problem. I will hit up google to find out how to translate this information into the way I want.\n. Alright sounds good. I did look at the video resolution and some of them were not standard sizes like I expected it to be for 480p vs 720p. No biggie, I can do some math.\n. @ebr11 Yeah, I see it in MBC. I don't know where I was looking before. Sorry.\n. Agree... I do that in the IOS client right now.\n. Seek works fine from my IOS client. It does take one second to respond. So the slider jumps back and forth for a second. Probably the same issue with other clients as well..\n. That would be perfect. Also the socket returns the new ticker value only every 5 seconds. Is that an expected behavior? \n. I'm getting the tickets every second. I was wondering if there is a way to increase the frequency on how often the client reports its position. Might be an overkill. But just a thought\n. I got to start testing in MBT or MBC. Dashboard is convenient for testing but probably not the ideal environment.\n. Fair enough. :) That should work for me.\nIt would be useful to add a play all button on the dashboard at some point of time. I use dashboard extensively and I listen to tv shows while coding. Thats just me :)\n. Volume control as well, please.\n. That was the case with one of the media item where tmdb was set but I found items that were new eg., \"Croods, The (2013)\" that did not have any of the external ids set.\nIn one case I put in the tmdb id and force refreshed, it pulled the metadata fine. In another case I renamed the title from \"Croods, The (2013)\" to \"The Croods (2013)\" and the force refresh worked there as well.\nSo there is an issue somewhere.\nAnother related issue is that when force refreshed, the metadata does not refresh the images if they already exist. Ie., usually the primary image is a SS when no meta data is available and when I fix the issue and force refresh it. I would expect to re fetch everything and overwrite existing metadata. What do you think?\n. I figured it was by design. Its not something to worry about as of now. \n. ",

If i tap the pause icon again it remains paused even after repeated attempts. This occurs in both desktop/mobile versions when setting website preference in IE settings. Also tapping the black box reveals nothing else.\n\n. Okay I have done what you described and I get the same results. Audio playback does not work. I tried multiple songs and different video formats (mkv, mp4, avi etc) and nothing is being played back. What does work is the remote from the phone sending it to playback something on my HTPC. Basically the IE MBserver UI only works for remote playback on windows phone. \nSeeing as how we have the windows phone MB3 app being developed by scottisafool which for the most part does work, I don't see this issue as being a priority. Ideally I would want it to work as intended though but I would understand if you wouldn't put any time right now into this issue. If you need me to do any more tests to address this issue at some point, I will be more than willing. Thanks.\n. Okay yes I believe IE in RT is not the same as IE in Windows Phone. Audio and video playback (for the few videos I tested) do appear to play correctly in RT Internet Explorer. On the Windows Phone 8 IE it is just as the issue I described, nothing is being played in either desktop mode or mobile mode.\n\n. \nWP 8.1 Update has fixed this issue. Playback works great now.\n. I see, yes I assumed the \"disable internet providers for\" checkboxes was the universal way of locking ALL items in that metadata field, in this case Genre. The way you described I would have to lock the genre field individually for all 278 of my TV shows manually or simply not use \"enable tvdb updates\" because that option is what overrides all of my TV show metadata.\nIs there a way to batch lock the fields within the server? It doesn't seem user friendly having to edit all of these TV shows individually and locking the fields. I will be able to do this in a batch edit using notepad++ and appending the   \"LockedFields>Genres</LockedFields\" tag to the series.xml files in one sweep but the average user wont know how or want to do that method. \nThanks for clarifying.\n. Glad this has been noticed. Ive been meaning to put together a description of subtitle errors I have seen experiencing since the past few updates but I wanted to know that it wasn't just me or if it would be fixed. For example SSA internal subs doesn't seem to get working all the time if at all. Subrips (internal) doesn't play at all. SRT (external) not playing either. ASS internal or external which was added recently isn't playing either. Should I post these as separate issues and provide server/ffmpeg logs?\nI would like to know what the subtitle extensions that the server currently supports so I can know if I should describe the issues as a bug or an enhancement request.\n.

I plan to move ARGUS TV to a full REST api in the future, phasing out the WCF endpoint and SDK.\nThe documentation is spread over the C# SDK you looked at (it has a .chm help file) but the REST api itself is also self-documented up to a reasonable point if you browse to its help pages.

The only other ways I can think to address this is to look into a \"helper\" service or create a scheduled task 1 minute in the future that can stop/restart the service.\nThere may be other ways to do this.

I can try to suss out via procmon what it's doing.\n. The more I think about the scheduled task approach, the better it seems.  It would be possible to register a scheduled task under a folder such as \"MediaBrowser\" and call the task \"MediaBrowser Server Update\" or something like that, and don't schedule a start time.  From then on, whenever you need to restart the service, you can merely invoke the existing scheduled task.\n.

Can we have GM both on the server and on MBT so we can do client side image processing ?\n. Well, if you are dealing with photos you want to access the EXIF data so you can rotate the orientation as required to match the camera. The GraphicsMagick convert tool supports the -auto-orient flag to do this.\n\nA nice way to do this is to have the baseItem have a auto-orient flag and so the server will take care or the rotation (if required) before presenting to the Client.\nAlso, when we move to imagemagick or sooner can we also add a bunch of image data to BaseItem - i.e. actualWidth, actualHeight etc that will make photo display much cleaner and easier\n. :+1: \n.

I don't think you'll need to run it from the file system, unless if it gets replaced by Emby.Web in which case this file would be replaced too.\n. Settings --> Users --> Select a user --> Allow video playback that requires transcoding\n. The only program that doesn't work with LF is notepad. Projects using LF instead of CR+LF is normal, don't assume everyone works on Windows.\nThat absolute path in MediaBrowser.ServerApplication.csproj is a bad idea. What if a developer is using a 32bit windows? There is no \"Program Files (x86)\" on his system. Or if his primary drive is not \"C\"?\nSince you just wanted to change your last commit you should have used amend instead of revert. To get rid of all those commits, and end up with only one you should squash your commits. If you are using git from a shell use:\ngit reset --soft HEAD~7\ngit commit\nIf you are using TortoiseGit go to the log (right click --> TortoiseGit --> Show log)  --> select the commits --> right click and choose \"Combine to one commit\".\nAfter that you will have to push using force (-f).\nAlso you should probably have used the dev branch instead of the master.\n. > Thanks for the tips, I've never used git before so there's a bit of a learning curve.\nGlad I could help :). Git is hard to master but it's a great tool.\n\nThe HintPath is just that, a hint. It doesn't have to exist, it's really going to pull it from the GAC if it can't find it there. This is just what's added by VS when you add a reference, I didn't add it manually or anything.\n\nYou should probably change it to something like \"%programfiles(x86)%\\Reference Assemblies\\Microsoft\\WindowsPowerShell\\3.0\\System.Management.Automation.dll\" or remove it completely, but since I'm not sure you'll have to wait for Luke's input on this.\n\nI don't assume everyone works on Windows, but I do, and that's what my tooling did for me. If I need to change my default settings in VS to always output LF only, then so be it, but I would like to know that up front.\n\nNot sure if you can do something about it from VS, but at least git has an option to change LF to CR+LF when checking out and CR+LF to LF when commiting. It's \"core.autocrlf\" in git, I think it's the \"AutoCrlf Convert\" option in \"TortoiseGit --> Settings --> Git --> Auto  CrLf Convert\".\n\nI'm using Git from the built-in MS provider for VS, so I don't see anything called a \"squash\" available. Instructions on how to do this from the github site would be welcome!\n\nThere is no way to do it from the site, and I'm not using VS so I can't help you with that one.\n\nI'll commit to the dev branch next time, I didn't know the proper procedures here.\n\nSince the dev branch has all the commits from the master branch, you can just change the base branch when comparing changes, right before making the pull request. Unfortunately as far as I know there is no way to change the targeted branch after making a pull request in Github other than closing it and making a new one.\n\nI think I updated the commit properly now (thanks for the TortoiseGit instructions). Let me know if not.\n\nIt looks fine. If you want to \"amend\" a commit in the future, I believe TortoiseGit has a checkbox for it when you go to make a commit.\n. There 's an option in Settings --> Users --> (select a user) to \"Allow video playback that requires transcoding\" which you can turn of for each individual user. Isn't that what you are asking for?\n. Shouldn't that be [\\r\\n|\\n]?\n. You are right, I seem to have mistaken [] for ().\n. You can \"squash\" all those commits into one https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History,\nalthough looking in your commit history you just need to throw away the last for commits:\ngit reset --hard HEAD~4\n(Watch out before using this, you'll \"lose\" those four commits, if you want to keep the changes from the second commit you should probably first make a new branch)\nAnd then\ngit push -f\nto force push to the server and overwrite the commits there.\nAlso next time when you want to work on two different features for pull requests you should create a branch for each.\n. From my experience any file you play through a browser will be transcoded.\n. What if euhd was related to the series name and elefantastisch was an episode title in the first screenshot? Adding all of it as a smart match would make no sense since it would only match a single episode, it should probably be a text box.\nAlso in the second screenshot as can be seen by \"Anger Management\" using the whole string makes little sense, since it contains the release group, which can be different in each episode.\n. TvFolderOrganizer.cs was modified 3 days ago in the dev branch, so github does not know how to merge your version of TvFolderOrganizer and dev branches version. What you need to do is rebase your branch on the remote dev branch. I also recommend that you remove the merge commit from your commit log before doing the rebase cause it may cause you issues during the rebase.\n. Any changes you make in a branch (including rebasing) wont affect any other branch so it's safe to rebase. If you are afraid you might break something, create a new branch from your master and rebase that.\nNote that your \"origin\" probably refers to your fork, and not to this repo. You'll have to add a new remote pointing to MediaBrowser/Emby instead of softworkz/Emby, and rebase on that remote's dev branch.\nIn git even if you do break a branch (for example if you delete a branch, or you do a hard reset) the old commits are still there for some time (I think the garbage collector will delete them only after a couple of months has past) even if you don't see them anywhere. As long as you know the old commit hash you can create a branch using that hash and the log will be exactly as it where. You can find md5 hashes of \"deleted\" commits using the reflog.\n. Unfortunately you can't change the branches of a pull request in Github (I believe there is a feature request about this but hasn't been fulfilled) , so you either had to replace your master branch and reopen PR #1200 which was targeting \"dev\" branch or create a new PR.\n\nAnd finally: In the future, should I always submit pull requests against the dev branch, or just this one?\n\nThat depends. Unless the project changes its release cylce (this is probably not the correct term but I can't think of the correct one at this hour) you should submit your PRs against the dev branch and not the master branch. Looking at the log I believe that the dev branch is used for anything new, and everything is merged in the master branch only when a new stable or beta version is released (I could be wrong about this though). \n. This is still an issue. Running version 3.0.5800.1481 on Windows 7.\n. Unfortunately still an issue on Version 3.0.5875.28272.\n. I think it's fixed, tnx.. Even though the video is transcoded from h264 to h264 the level of the original video (5.1) is different from the target level (4.1). \nMy guess is that at least for the linked file the reason it gets transcoded is the level of the video, not the container or the bitrate, since not a lot of devices support playing of level 5 and up h264 videos. Not sure what is the maximum level supported by browsers, but Emby's player seems to limit it to 4.1:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/blob/8b2e009bf78b3062df609cd5fbbee254a42aeb36/MediaBrowser.WebDashboard/dashboard-ui/scripts/mediaplayer.js#L386\n. This seems to have been fixed. I've had a couple of instances where the animation didn't work properly, but since I can't reproduce it I'm closing this.\n. Doesn't seem like \"Header Stripping\" is the issue. I remuxed one of the videos and Emby is still downscaling it.\n. The only common between the problematic files I can see is the very low bitrate (<1mbps).\n. And with that in mind I found another series that downscales:\nhttps://gist.github.com/psxlover/4ab28e86da3505ca1e11\nTurns out Emby limits width to 720 when the input file has a low bitrate (and the 720 has nothing to do with the height of the original video, since this one is 1280x688).\n. My guess is that the client's max bitrate value should be passed here https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/blob/459974a80ce2b316514c49d66dd9cb4ff03e6e34/MediaBrowser.MediaEncoding/Encoder/EncodingJobFactory.cs#L85 instead of the video's actual bitrate. No reason to transcode a video just because its bitrate is low.\n(request.VideoBitRate instead of state.OutputVideoBitrate.Value? Not sure if that is a max)\n. Now you can't get into the movie/series when the overlay is open. Perhaps you should check for \"userDataIcons\" instead of \"cardOverlayTarget\".\n. External only. I created a .mkv with embedded.srt and it worked correctly. Also files with embed .ass resume correctly as long as embed .ass is listed as supported in the DLNA profile (I guess when they aren't supported, they are extracted and served as external .srt).\nLooking at the packets with Wireshark the subtitle's timestamps have been modified by the server, and it only sends the dialog from the point your resume and onwards.\n. Or you could simply look for /web/ instead\n. I'm already using <SubtitleProfile format=\"srt\" method=\"External\" didlMode=\"\" /> in my profile, and it has been working fine.\n. Another option would be to store the title without accents in a field used only for searching.\n. ",
    "Nerdy314159265": "Has there been any progress on getting this added in? It really hampers adding certain types of media to one's library.. I think it's interesting that this issue, which in some situations could be considered a critical failure of the software, has not only not been fixed in almost a full year since my last comment but over 3 years.\nThis is a basic feature that so many other media softwares have already figure out and implemented. It's hard to believe Emby could be so stunted.. @LukePulverenti I very much appreciate the fix. As you probably can tell from my comment, this has been a sensitive issue for me for awhile.. I'm still experiencing this issue.\nI tested by adding a tag to some TV shows that I have added and setting it to block the tag on another account.\nWithin the TV menu the shows aren't visible, however, under the \"Next Up\" subheading the shows are still visible and are still playable.. An example would be attempting playback on the Roku Streaming Stick of a bluray copy of Stargate Continuum. The video would load, play for a short duration then would buffer with a black loading screen. When playback resumes it's very short less than 10 seconds and it buffers again.\nGetting logs will take a little bit for me to retest and make sure I give you the correct ones.. Apologies for never following up with more details like I should've. We've dealt with it for now by lowering the max bitrate like you suggested. However, I still find it curious that the auto mode doesn't work for some reason.\nEvery connection along the network pipe is solid. So my only guess is that the app is trying to draw more bandwidth than the Roku can deal with, either from a memory or CPU limitation.. ",

    "TomGillen": "Yea, that would be fine too. I hadn't seen those benchmarks before. That's awful.\n. Ill remove the current AnimeSeriesIndex and related code after this is merged and the anime plugin has been updated.\n. Can we get some feedback on this?\n. I only added the identities to baseitem so that image providers could access them during the refresh without having to make very extensive breaking changes. Ideally, it wouldn't be there. If a single item were refreshed, the identities would be recalculated and populated at the beginning of the refresh, wouldn't they?\nThis is work that is currently done at the beginning of each metadata provider, and is then immediately used inside that provider, and never made available to others. The item identities allow the identification  portion of each provider to be run for all metadata providers as a separate phase, which means that all identities are available to all providers when they start trying to fetch the item data. It also allows the identity converters to run in between these two phases, and fill in missing identity information.\nThe new interfaces are entirely optional. I have only implemented them on the TV items, partly as an example, but mainly because those are the ones I need for the anime plugin. Any of the other item types could implement it if someone found they needed it.\n. Well, the image providers still have access to the information that they had before, so they could fall back onto the previous logic if there are no identities (I just checked, and I did not implement this). However, if the previous run was actually using the identity information, then the refresh might pull down the wrong images.\nI guess we can either persist the identities, or always run the identification pass when refreshing anything on an item.\n. @ebr11 \nWell the first thing to mention is that it is optional. Unmodified providers continue to work just as they are.\nThis change introduces the concept of an item identity. These are a little like the provider IDs that we are currently using, but they store more information specific to each type of item.\nFor example, this is the item identifier for a TV episode:\n``` c#\npublic class EpisodeIdentity : IItemIdentity\n{\n    public string Type { get; set; }\npublic string SeriesId { get; set; }\npublic int? SeasonIndex { get; set; }\npublic int IndexNumber { get; set; }\npublic int? IndexNumberEnd { get; set; }\n\n}\n```\nThe Type on the identifier functions similar to the key in the provider IDs dictionary. The identity is supposed to provide all of the information needed to fully identify the item.\nIf an item type has an item identity implemented, then you can define IItemIdentityProvider<TLookupInfo, TIdentity> implementations, which are responsible for identifying an item.\nDuring an item refresh, all of the relevant identity providers are run before the metadata providers are run. The metadata providers can then retrieve these identities while they are fetching their metadata.\nThe main purpose of this, is that in between the identity providers and the metadata providers, the identities can be used to create new identities. This will allow the anime plugin (or any similar plugin in the future) to insert conversion between thetvdb IDs and AniDB/Hummingbird/AniList IDs before the metadata providers run.\n@LukePulverenti I would also rather the property were not there. Passing it along to the image providers during the refresh will require some breaking changes to the image provider interfaces, and we will likely have to always run the identifiers even when only refreshing images.\n. I just hadn't looked through the auto-organiser's code to confirm if there might be any conditions under which it wont pick them up, but it looks like it should work fine. I've not tested it.\nThe missing/unaired currently always assumes that episodes have season numbers, so it won't ever notice that you have episodes without. It also needs some logic to decide if missing/unaired virtual episodes should be created as those in a season or not (should match however the user is organising their current episodes).\n. I should also mention that these changes are only for absolute episodes. Those without any seasons at all. I've not done anything to fix \"sXXeXX\" files inside the series folder, mainly because I am not sure exactly how we should be handling those. Should such files have a virtual season parent?\n. \"Series Name/s01e01.mp4\" is not recognised as an episode, as all of the regexs which match that naming format expect a season folder. I am not sure that omitting the season folder for such episodes is something we really need to support, but if we did, should such episodes still show as having a (virtual?) season folder as a parent?\n. > the regex's with paths were updated a while back to support both / and \\ as path delimiters. Is that still preserved?\nYes.\n\nlastly - just make sure Luis's unit tests still pass (and update them if needed).\n\nThey still pass, but I'll add some extra conditions to test.\n. I'll take a look at tv renamers expressions.\n. Do you have a link to the specific renamer you mean? There are a couple with similar names.\n. ",

True. I kinda expect them to be grouped like collections though now that we have them. I would then expect to be able to choose from the detail page which format to play - but then that is just my expectation.\n\nI don't mind them showing up twice but then we really need a default identifier to show which is which. It is a crap shoot for me if I'll get the HD, 3D or SD version with any one of those. Prior to collections going in I submitted an update to show \"banners\" on each movie - it looked pretty nice but it conflicts with the other info - collection count and \"played\" tick. Perhaps the hover info could include the format? Not really sure where that info should go to be honest... :)\n. LOL - yeah, I saw that CovertArt shows the format. :)\n. It was a little clunky so I fixed it up to remove transitions. The transitions were kinda neat, but on the 2nd go around it made the UX a bit odd - it resulted in a bit of a flash after the images were loaded from the cache. I have tweaked it and I'll include it in another pull request - basically it will just result in lazy loaded images, but without any fancy presentation.\n. Just to help explain a bit why the css is using positioning: to allow for easier grouping of video controls, and to allow for left/right alignment I opted for positioning the containers. Here are some examples to better illustrate:\n\n Attempting to use relative positioning would result in the need for negative top margins, which I thought would be even more confusing.\n\nThe absolute positioning allows left and right alignment easily without bothering with floats and widths.\n\nEven if the widths are set wider than they probably should be we don't have layout problems - it is just a little more forgiving.\n\nThis is a good example of how the grouping/alignment is working.\nOf course all this can be achieved with a more simple layout, but I thought the control grouping worked well and overall I found it to look nicer and more aligned to what I would expect from other video players. We don't need to keep this css layout if you don't like it.\n. I'd pick and choose but I am just not that good when it comes to git, sorry. If I can figure it out I'll try it.\n. This may help a bit:\n- The dom stuff is just a time tooltip - when you scrub the position bar it shows the time. It was in the mediaplayer-video but since this should be the same no matter where it is used - video, audio, now playing bar - it just made sense to use it in a centralized location. It is very little code, so it can be easily moved elsewhere. I simply did not think it was a good idea to have identical code in 2 or 3 places, but it can be done pretty easily.\n- Not sure exactly what you mean by autoplay - optimal stream stuff? If so, it was just moved. There were \"private\" functions intermixed with \"public\" ones and I just reorg'd code to keep like with like. Nothing was removed.\n- The now playing position bar change is just moving the 3 lines of html and the css updates. It is pretty easy to unwind too.\n- Not sure about the cast forced code share thing. The only things changed in the chromecast.js file are minor changes to bindings that I noticed in the original codebase. I figured it was a decent thing to bring over since there may be some minor perf difference with creating a single binding and reusing it as opposed to creating bindings multiple times.\n. Sure. And I mentioned in the other pull but not this one, that some of them are not even really aligned with commands. Mainly at that point I was just playing around and showing how easy it would be to use this for hotkeys for just about anything in the web client.\nI did think it would be cool to show a hotkey map - like maybe if the ctrl key was pressed. I forget where I've seen that before, but I know I have seen something like that. Anyway, I did not expect everything to be a keeper.\n. Yeah, for sure. I don't know if you saw the trello board but I linked a xaml app that has c# ready to go for srt to vtt. It could at least be a starting point and bangs out one of the top type of subs.\n.

Boy, learned alot about the channels and twitch tonight - good stuff.\n\n\n\n\nTwitch is an odd one - it only lets you take 100, and you get them in the\norder they want to provide them in, which is based on viewers. Overall the\napi is a little clunky, so it makes things a bit hard too. Basically\nthough, we get back the top 100, and then somehow those are being alpha\nsorted - but it is a false alpha sort since the order is really \"arbitrary\"\n(based on viewers). You could easily have games with names from A-Z in the\nfirst 100 and 101-200, so alpha is misleading. However, alpha makes it\neasier to find unless we implement search. ideally, I think we'd be able to\noverride the channel item sorting and just \"take what we get\" so to speak.\nI'll chat with you more about this tomorrow.\nOn Wed, May 28, 2014 at 11:31 PM, Tim Hobbs jesus.tesh@gmail.com wrote:\n\nAnd, now I realize that the sorting stuff won't work anyway, so no hurry\nthere.

    "hurricanehrndz": "Did you compile the 32 bit version yourself or did you use the download link from the thread? The thread only made the 64bit version available.\n. That would be the problem, the download link is specifically built for the x64bit architecture, the only library file that is specific to each architecture is sqlite. So yes the x64 build will work on 32bit, only if you move the sqlite library file like you have done so. So this is not really a bug, its more of an annoyance that can be resolved like you have done so, or by compiling from source the 32bit version.\n. Luke,\nEverything is fine for the x64 bit version. He is trying to run the x64bit version on a 32bit host. The releases you compile are for x64, so of course the 32bit hosts will error. \n. Issue has been resolved.

PS the right project files are here:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby.Build/tree/master/builders/emby-server/debfiles\n. https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby.Build/pull/42\n. One sec, I will write a test script for you and will like the results back.\n. can you please run this \n```\n!/bin/bash\nMAGICK_LIBRARY_PATH=$(find /usr/lib/emby-server/ -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d| grep -v bin)\nMONO_EXEC_ENV=\"$MONO_ENV LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${MAGICK_LIBRARY_PATH}${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:}$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\"\necho \"$MONO_EXEC_ENV\"\n```\n. Okay, I see the issue, for some reason in your configuration you have folders in /usr/lib/emby-server which are not suppose to be there. \n. Yes, its a recent change we made in order to ensure that our version of imgaemagick doesn't conflict with the one distributed by default with each distro. Some users complained of not being able to run gimp and other apps that depended on imagemagick. \n. Exactly so we made our version of imagemagick that was a shared library not system installed one. Because of differing arch we needed to be able to find lib directories in '/usr/lib/emby-server' hence we added those two lines that are giving you trouble. Unfortunately during our testing we never had an example where there were other folders other than lib, lib64 and bin. \n. Please test this:\n```\n!/bin/bash\nMAGICK_LIBRARY_PATH=$(find /usr/lib/emby-server/ -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d| grep -v bin | grep -v -e \"/usr/lib/emby-server/.\")\nMONO_EXEC_ENV=\"$MONO_ENV LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${MAGICK_LIBRARY_PATH}${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:}$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\"\necho \"$MONO_EXEC_ENV\"\n. Okay. PS I don't think you have libembymagick installed, which is fine, but it does increase performance over the WAN. \nPlease give me the output of:\nls /usr/lib/emby-server\ndpkg -l | grep emby\n. Yup you don't have our embymagick packages, again this is another scenario which we didn't think about  I guess. Any reason why you don't have them?\n.\n!/bin/bash\nMAGICK_LIBRARY_PATH=$(find /usr/lib/emby-server/ -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d| grep -v bin | grep -v -e \"/usr/lib/emby-server/.\")\nMONO_EXEC_ENV=\"$MONO_ENV ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+\"LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"}${MAGICK_LIBRARY_PATH}${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:}$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\"\necho \"$MONO_EXEC_ENV\"\n```\nThis should give you nothing which is probably what you want. \n. That package libembymagick is brand new. You don't need to have and if you feel comfortable without it then that's cool. I though I would just let you know that images being transmitted over the wan will be slow because you have no access to imagemagick. \n. PS libembymagick does not conflict or interfere with imagemagick\n. Okay thank you. I will be updating the script with the fixes now.\n. lol, I have answer this question 100 times but okay. One yes it does compress. \nTwo. imagemagick across all the distributions are all compiled differently. Debian and Ubuntu do not seem to include webp which is the default compression we use. Additionally, imagemagick in the distros is compiled to do threading on each image, which is good when processing large image files. But in our case we are trying to process reasonably sized files but lots of them so its better if we thread the process ourselves. Also, we use a better compression algorithm q8 rather than q16  for better performance.\n. Without the libembymagick  there is no compression on the images. \n. There should be a new build in 1 hour addressing your issue. \n. Ha ha. Good call, maybe I'll add it to the wiki\n.

What git commands did you use?\n. I don't know about fixing your branch. It's pretty mangled. What I can do is tell you the proper way to rebase your changes onto a branch.\nFirst you should ALWAYS work off a new branch. In this case you should be working off of the dev branch but with a new branch name. After your initial fetch open up a git shell and run the following (omit everything after \\ it's meant to be commentary:\ngit co dev \\change to the dev brach\ngit branch YourNewBranchNameHere \\ create a new branch\ngit co  YourNewBranchNameHere \\ change to the new branch\ngit push --set-upstream origin YourNewBranchNameHere \\ push the branch to your remote repo\nAt this point you have a new branch called: YourNewBranchNameHere that is based on current dev. Do all of your work in this branch then submit a pull request. If it's accepted there is nothing else to do. \nHowever, dev continues to change while your pull request sits there. At some point you need to integrate the dev changes into your branch so your pull request can be merged. The first thing you need to do is get the dev changes into your local repo.\ngit fetch upstream \\ bring in changes from the official media browser repo\ngit co dev \\ change to your dev branch\ngit merge upstream/dev \\ merge the changes from the official repo into your local dev repo\n                                       \\ since no changes were made to the dev branch because all work\n                                       \\ was done in YourNewBranchNameHere this will merge conflict free\ngit push \\ sync to your remote repo\nAt this point you have a local dev branch that mirrors the official media browser branch. You now want to bring those changes into YourNewBranchNameHere. But the result you want is your new changes replayed ontop of the dev changes so they can be easily merged.\ngit co YourNewBranchNameHere  \\ change to your new branch name\ngit rebase dev \\ This is what does the magic. \nThe command git rebase dev will unwind any of your changes merge in the changes from dev into YourNewBranchNameHere then attempt to replay your changes on top. If there are no contlicts you can just do a git push and you are done.\nIf there are merge conflict you will need to fix them. They are marked with the standard git conflict resolution markers. Then run:\ngit add [Conflict files] \\ Each file with a conflict needs to be re-added individually after resolution.\ngit rebase --continue \\ signal all conflicts are dealt with.\ngit push -f \\ you need to force since this is a non continuous change.\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask, but I recommend creating a new branch and just re-doing your work there. \n. I have an ulterior motive. Once this is done I can finally move to a low powered server instead of my i7 beast.\n. I don't have a plan yet. I just know my 1000 watt gaming pc is totally overpowered:-)\n. I've done some reading about gstreamer and am skeptical. It doesn't seem to support nvenc or quick sync yet, but I like the concept. Information is hard to come by though\n. Fantastic. This should be better then.\n. That was my concern about about mono.security as well. There is a version with each mono build and it seems as if that package hasn't been updated in a while. Unless reflection is broken out implementing this on linux will be a PITA. \nI'm not sure where else to put the code so feel free to suggest somewhere else, or not merge it.\n. Mono.Security is HUGE. Apparently it's standalone so I've got a certificate generation code working. Just making sure it doesn't fall over on a modern version of mono. \nI hate developing for linux:-)\n. Updated to include mono cert generation. I've included Mono.security as a third party library but it SHOULD NOT be included in the install, hence copy local is set to false.  We just need it to compile against. All installations of mono include their own Mono.Security. As long as they don't make a breaking change we are good. I took the Mono.Security from Mono 3.2.8 and ran it against 3.12.0 it works fine. \n. Will rebase shortly.\nWill Mono.Security work on windows running under the .net framework? \n  It may. I'm not really sure. I didn't use the nuget package since it was so old. I implemented the code twice, once using pInvoke and once using Mono.Security. Investigating the this will require some time, and the weekend is over so I'll be short on it till next week. If this is a requirement it will have to wait.\nAlso wondering if we should have one public port mapped to either local port depending on settings, or have two public ports.\nIt's probably a good idea until all the 3rd party clients are updated though. That way new ones can use https and old ones will still work. If it's one port and only one, many clients will not work properly I'm guessing. Especially if you don't purchase a valid certificate from a provider. There needs to be an option to disable the http public port though for people who only want encrypted traffic.\n. That controls where the cert is located. If the server starts up and no cert is located at that path, it will generate one. If one is there it will leave it be. Basically it has to be set for ssl to work. I couldn't think of a reasonable default that would work on linux and windows. If one exists it probably makes sense to just default the field. \n. Rebased.\n. Not as long as the cert file is in a location that doesn't require elevation\n. New ui organization looks nice.\n. This is MUCH more involved then the previous implementation. Let me know what you think before I flush it out.\n. Bummer.\n. Any more thoughts on this? There are a bunch of people coming up with odd workarounds because task length can't be limited:\nhttp://mediabrowser.tv/community/index.php?/topic/18822-recursive-batch-create-roku-bif-files/?hl=bif\nhttp://mediabrowser.tv/community/index.php?/topic/18755-create-bif-file-manually/?hl=bif\n. This is no longer necessary after subsequent changes by luke.\n. no matter what, without universal ssl support through the Emby ecosystem this is going to be a problem. Everyone recognizes that and is working towards a better solution. \n. HTTP 2.0 supports alt services which will basically be DSL without certificate validation. \nIn the short term we would need to provide a way to overide cert validation errors on each platform unless end users want to purchase ssl certs or use the free eff platform when it comes out.\n.

The public and private key are a pair. How would you suggest we keep the private key a secret since we are open source and don't host the server software? If it's not secret we might as well use http as anyone can decrypt the traffic. \nAlso, we cant override certificate validation errors on roku or windows 8.1 store apps. (There may be other platforms that don't let you do this as well) \nPinning only prevent MITM attacks by spoofed certs from bad cert authorities.\n. Hosting a CA as you are suggesting has nothing to do with certificate pinning. Certificate pinning is just telling your browser (or application) what the public key\\certificate for your well known website is. This way, if a bad CA which was in your trust chain did issue a cert for a pinned website, the browser or application could tell you. (See the following: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Pinning_Cheat_Sheet) In other words, pinning basically prevents a MITM attack even if someone has obtained a cert for a website illicitly that would otherwise be valid in your trust chain.\nAll of that said issuing an emby CA root cert with the private key well known to all and allowing users to generate ssl certs from it isn't a bad idea if we were able to override the certificate validation process on all platforms as we would NEVER want the cert in the OS or browser trust chain. I'm not sure if this is possible but will do some digging on it.\n. You may not even need a guest account. A Dlna client might be able to do something similar without an account since by default they are auto detected.\n. ",

Hi Luke\nCan you take a look at these changes, they are working nicely for  me.\nI was not able to make suitable tweaks within FFMPEG (in particular trying to override the frame size within the QSV encoder caused a lot of strange results - I think because the rest of FFMPEG expected the original values to be used and not my overridden values).\nQuestions\nI've made a couple of other tweaks too and have a couple of questions...\nCRF\nI'm not using CRF based encoding - In most documents I've read, since we are streaming at a particular bit-rate the most important thing is the bit-rate. Therefore the setting that should be changed to affect quality should be the -preset. The slower the preset the better the quality will be at the specific bit-rate. \nThis could mean low end CPUs may not be able to keep up, but this is why I would have thought it would make sense to use ultrafast | fast | slower as the options that change when the user selects a quality.\nRounding factor\nI have added some logic to use a different rounding factor if using QSV. Based on the code I've added, the values for any other codec should remain unchanged.\nMaxrate confusion\nI noticed here:\n// H264\n                if (hasFixedResolution)\n                {\n                    if (isHls)\n                    {\n                        return string.Format(\" -b:v {0} -maxrate ({0}*.80) -bufsize {0}\", bitrate.Value.ToString(UsCulture));\n                    }\nThat the -maxrate would be less than the bitrate when we have an HLS stream, in my edit I have set the h264_qsv -maxrate to be 20% higher than the bitrate because - but have I overlooked something here?\nScaling method\nFinally, you'll notice I have added a scaling method which will be appended to the existing scaling options - :flags=fast_bilinear - This is because I found that with the default method I was getting about 25fps with low CPU and GPU utilization (something was clearly not working correctly).\nAfter switching to this different scaling method, I was getting about 55fps with 75% GPU and 85% CPU utilization\n. Yeah - I get really confused with git commands. There was an miss-match\nafter Luke change some things whilst I was implementing the original QS\nthings, and I didn't really know what I should be doing. Apologies.\nAre you able to point be in the right direction for how I should fix this?\nOr are you able to implement the NVENC changes without me fixing my git\nmistakes?\nM\nMatt Bunce | 0789 0788 321 | matt@purplepixelmedia.co.uk\nPurple Pixel Media Ltd, 28 Vanguard Close, High Wycombe, HP12 3FP |\nRegistered company: 06438677\nOn 18 January 2015 at 17:09, Mike notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI was checking out your changes and it looks like the nvec one includes a\nbunch of merges from dev.

It's pretty mangled. What I can do\nis tell you the proper way to rebase your changes onto a branch.\nFirst you should ALWAYS work off a new branch. In this case you should be\nworking off of the dev branch but with a new branch name. After your\ninitial fetch open up a git shell and run the following (omit everything\nafter \\ it's meant to be commentary:\ngit co dev \\change to the dev brach\ngit branch YourNewBranchNameHere \\ create a new branch\ngit co YourNewBranchNameHere \\ change to the new branch\ngit push --set-upstream origin YourNewBranchNameHere \\ push the branch to\nyour remote repo\nAt this point you have a new branch called: YourNewBranchNameHere that is\nbased on current dev. Do all of your work in this branch then submit a pull\nrequest. If it's accepted there is nothing else to do.\nHowever, dev continues to change while your pull request sits there. At\nsome point you need to integrate the dev changes into your branch so your\npull request can be merged. The first thing you need to do is get the dev\nchanges into your local repo.\ngit fetch upstream \\ bring in changes from the official media browser repo\ngit co dev \\ change to your dev branch\ngit merge upstream/dev \\ merge the changes from the official repo into\nyour local dev repo\n\\ since no changes were made to the dev branch because all work\n\\ was done in YourNewBranchNameHere this will merge conflict free\ngit push \\ sync to your remote repo\nAt this point you have a local dev branch that mirrors the official media\nbrowser branch. You now want to bring those changes into\nYourNewBranchNameHere. But the result you want is your new changes replayed\nontop of the dev changes so they can be easily merged.\ngit co YourNewBranchNameHere \\ change to your new branch name\ngit rebase dev \\ This is what does the magic.\nThe command git rebase dev will unwind any of your changes merge in the\nchanges from dev into YourNewBranchNameHere then attempt to replay your\nchanges on top. If there are no contlicts you can just do a git push and\nyou are done.\nIf there are merge conflict you will need to fix them. They are marked\nwith the standard git conflict resolution markers. Then run:\ngit add [Conflict files] \\ Each file with a conflict needs to be re-added\nindividually after resolution.\ngit rebase --continue \\ signal all conflicts are dealt with.\ngit push -f \\ you need to force since this is a non continuous change.\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask, but I recommend creating a new\nbranch and just re-doing your work there.\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/MediaBrowser/pull/970#issuecomment-70421318\n.\n. haha - Well that was always my motivation!\n\nI started out with the low-power chip and had to make QS work to allow\ntranscoding at all!\nIt does seem to be working pretty well for me.

Was wondering if it's a class of errors known to happen because of version issues (known mono bugs). Will try with latest mono and check if it's still there.\n. Installing mono 4.0 was not a problem, I am proposing PR #1956 too to make mono v4.0+ a requirement of the Linux build script.\nWith this version of mono there are no more crashes; video stops playing after a while as per OP, but this time with a more graceful dialog \"there was a problem\" and then I see in the logs that a 500 was returned.\nThis happens with an x264 video (not transcoding); I tried with a Divx5 video and the same happens.\n. I checked transcoding logs (when using transcoding, not the case with x264), no issues there.\nIn the javascript console I can see Media element error code: 3, I think this is the lead for this problem. Will wait for some feedback about troubleshooting.\nExcerpt of the server log:\n2016-07-19 01:16:09.0926 Info HttpServer: HTTP Response 200 to 192.168.168.122.

Would be nice to have it always generated with those two configSection elements, but not sure how to achieve that.\nWill give a try later on with mono 4.4+\n. @LukePulverenti yes, the master branch.

    "Bluebull32": "Great, thanks.  I completely agree that the .bif files would be a lot more useful if they were generated ahead of time.  If you are going to look at this later in testing, be aware the the bif files will not get picked up during playback when they are ready.  The video needs to be stopped, and resumed/started over before the thumbnails will be displayed.\nThe stuff on the roku client app is good to go, it just need to be uncommented.\n. Yes I have.  I just keep an eye on the the folder where the thumbnails and index.bif are created.  Once the index.bif file is created, I can just replay the video on the roku, and the thumbnails function just like you would expect.\nNow that I think of it, there is probably no reason to keep the jpegs around after the index.bif has been successfully created.\n.

    "TheTedAdams": "Just tested this pr on my Nexus 4. I timed how long it took to render the guide after the page loaded (starting when the popup appears, and ending when the popup disappears).\ndev: 1s, 1s, 1s\npull-request: 21s, 21s, 20s\nDecreasing the cell size from 30m to 1m seems to have a very negative impact on mobile performance. This might need some performance tuning.\nI do think it is a good idea to allow programs to be displayed accurately to-the-minute. I think we would get better performance from re-working the code to iterate through the programs once, and place each program in its appropriate spot, rather than iterating through the cells and then iterating through the programs once for each cell to find the correct program to put in that cell.\nI do agree that the starting time should not be the beginning of the hour, but using current time means that the currently playing program is completely illegible for the last 15 minutes of the show. Personally I would rather see the most recent half-hour, instead (e.g. 1:00, 1:30, 2:00, etc.). I think this is how the guide works for Comcast at least.\n. What I was suggesting would be a major overhaul of how the guide is rendered. The only reason is because that's how I tackled it when building a proof-of-concept guide overlay for the video screen. It involves calculating and setting the size of the program container, and then positioning each program absolutely based on calculations of where it should go. It seemed to be a pretty performant approach, but I agree that if we can get the functionality improvements we are gunning for without such a major overhaul, that would be the better option at this point.\nI didn't realize that we still had a div for every minute, sitting underneath each show. That should be a very helpful fix for div count. And good move on skipping slots that are already filled. That will cut WAY down on iterations through the programs array. Love it.\nI wonder if the program iterations would be even more efficient if after we found the program (around line 175) we added programs.splice(i, 1); That would mean each iteration gets shorter, and saves us from iterating through programs that have already been placed. The only question there is whether the cost of calling programs.splice() once per program found would be more or less than the cost of iterating through already found programs. My gut says the .splice() would add efficiency but might be worth a perf test.\nOr, if we are sticking with 1 minute increments, I wonder if there would be a performance gain from turning the array in to an object with date.setSeconds(0) as the key.\n``` javascript\nvar programDict = {};\nprograms.filter(function (curr) {\n        return curr.ChannelId == channel.Id;\n    }).forEach(function(curr) {\n        try {\n            var time = parseISO8601Date(program.StartDate, { toLocal: true })\n                                .setSeconds(0).getTime().toString();\n            programDict[time] = curr;\n        }\n        catch (err) {\n    }\n});\n\n```\nThen the programs could be retrieved by calling programDict[date.getTime().toString()] instead of iterating through an array?\nDunno, just bouncing ideas around.\n. What you just sent me in PM is a massive performance improvement. Great work. Back down to ~1s to render the guide on my Nexus 4. (A lot better than 20s!)\nIf we are at 1sec render time we probably don't need to worry overmuch about tweaking out every last bit of performance. So just ignore my rambling musings :)\nOne last thing would be what you mentioned with stretching the first cell out to 30min width, regardless of how long it is.\nThis is how WMC shows the guide at 4:59, for instance\n\nHaving a 1min sliver makes it look at-a-glance like the guide didn't render correctly, just in my personal opinion\n\nIf you can figure that one out, I think this would be an awesome improvement to the guide!\n. It's there now, your second commit showed up in this pull request. Click commits up top to see the second commit showed up, and then click files changed to see the final outcome of the 2 commits.\n. You are done. The Pull Request is submitted. One of the owners will review when they have time, and then they will either accept, reject, or ask for some changes. Might take a while, those guys have a lot on their plates.\n. I see your point. I do agree with ebr that the current buttons are odd though. I have to click OK, and then click 'cancel' to accept my changes. There should be a way to 'positively' close the preferences page.\nOther ideas:\n- Old-school windows interface would be to have an 'Apply' button that has current functionality, as well as an 'Ok' button that saves, and closes the preference window\n- Add apply buttons per section, and change \"ok\" button at the bottom to have text \"Save and close\". Quick mock: \n  \nOne other thought: Because the \"ok\" button is at the bottom of the page, do you really think people scroll to the bottom of the page to hit ok, just so they can scroll back up and change a setting they just scrolled past? I feel like the natural flow would be to change settings as you scroll down, and once you reach the button click \"save and close\"\n. Ah. I think the issue is that the ok button makes me think of this as a modal rather than a page. Maybe change ok to 'save'? Either way, perhaps close issue #882 \n. Desktop Full Screen:\n\nDesktop 556px:\n\nDesktop 555px:\n\nMobile:\n\nPersonally I think it might be a good idea to float the controls left in mobile, as they are somewhat separate in function from the buttons they are with.\n. @LukePulverenti this is getting an intermittent 500 error requesting the backdrop image from the server... the error is:\nThe process cannot access the file '{serverLocation}\\cache\\images\\resized-images\\c\\c95258cf-d143-0c40-3a91-1518eacab4a5.webp' because it is being used by another process.\nMy guess is the process that returned the backdrop for the details page hasn't been terminated/released the file?\n. The intermittent 500 from the server serving the image is hitting the video error handling, which stops the video and brings up a popup. This is pretty nasty behavior. Closing this pull request until I can fix the image serving, or figure out a way to detect that the error came from the poster and just ignore it in the error handling...\n. I've been using this for a week and have not been able to recreate the errors I was seeing the first night. Seems stable.\n. Synced. \n. Shouldn't this also be going against the dev branch?\n.

Yes, the core server would have the option to receive an unhashed password encrypted , decrypt it and use for authentication.\n And yes the other pull request is based on this one\n. In the future after finishing the external auth providers i was thinking more of using Entity Framework Core for all repositories which will create the database sqlite, mysql, postsql and tables and add columns by itself which works with 4.6.2 the current framework for now i am doing it because i was addingand reading some fields to the users database and was just rewriting the code multiple times, so i just put it in the base class. \nAt the moment each commit, read is for one command is just to make it easier by handling the errors and the parameters without having a connection. Just do multiple commits or multiple reads, the commits does use writelock so if multiple writes are made it will wait.\n. Remake of #1885 @LukePulverenti  , this would be the base for additional authentication providers needs to have a way to add distinguishednames from the web to a user\n. Should allow for plugins that could provide for #1981 and #1146 \nShould be easy to add a salt now for password #1074 \n. @untotren  I had to stop working on this as I have been busy (still am), also i think Emby was going to move to ASP Core and i was waiting for that until i made any other changes. I encourage anyone to continue working on this maybe even implement something like LetsEncrypt for secure ssl. @LukePulverenti Has the move to Net Core been done? Are there any major chances coming soon to the code/ especially in the authentication side? I was planning on putting some work into this maybe after the holidays. . I am waiting when i can just hit build in .net core. so i can test build easily and don't have to worry about using functions not available for net core/std. For now it still builds by default in mono / net 4.x. ",
    "paul-777": "I have reworked it - turns out the issue was that we weren't detecting anamorphic removal as upscaling so we were passing in the current video bitrate as the limit and many of my 720 res anamorphic 21:9 videos have bitrates less than 800Kbps so were then being scaled down to 640 rather than upscaled properly. For example a 720x432 anamorphic video which should be upscaled to 1032x432 was being down sized to 640x268.\n. Unfortunately I don't have that capability to be able to test it.\n. Channels? All I have is the media on my own storage. I can't see why the changes would affect media where we can't obtain mediainfo though - if the IsAnamorphic flag isn't set it the metadata then it will have no effect. Which in itself will mean that those anamorphic streams (many live TV broadcast are) still won't be upscaled properly, but won't be any worse than the current situation.\n. Hi, I have now updated this again with the latest pull from master, please can you take a look at merging it - having to pull changes in from master and in some cases remake them in new files is very time consuming. This fix is important for anyone using LG (and other) TVs which cannot handle anamorphic videos. thanks\n. Updated from MediaBrowser master again\n. ok, no problem, thanks\n. Merged from master\n. pull from master\n. The issues for this should now be fixed and I have updated to master again. For it to work properly with only content the metadata does have to be refreshed to perform detection again. Many of the changes are also not to do with the detection but also dnla clients passing a flag for whether they support anamorphic to get the correct stream.\n. Hi Luke,  I've merged this with master again, is there any reason you can't merge it? Keen to get back to being able to use standard releases but need this working on all my LG TVs.\nthanks\n. Hi Luke, \nUpscaling of anamorphic content is the correct thing to do though - down scaling them results in half the pixels and a very poor quality image compared to the intended resolution, and in fact results in 20% less pixels than the anamorphic source which clearly isn't great (based on normal DVD formats). Just because we allow the bitrate to go higher to achieve this doesn't mean it will actually go to the maximum rate given, so even if a client did pass a max of 100Mbps it is very unlikely that any content would upscale to that - you would likely need to find a 70Mbps anamorphic source to cause that to happen. Also anamorphic content is typically restricted to DVDs so even the upscaled version will still have a lower bitrate that an HD stream - which means that if clients are specifying a max bitrate that allows them to work with HD stream then upscaling of anamorphic should be no issue at all.\nActually in my own build I don't limit the output bitrate based on the source bitrate, only by the max specified. (remember this is a max not a target) The reason for this is that when transcoding I am often reading a highly compressed stream and encoding quickly with a lower compression ratio so in order to maintain output quality the bitrate has to rise. With the default restriction in place transcoded bluray rips looked terrible on a big screen. This is was most noticeable when we were triggering level41 -> level40 transcoding of a 1920x1080 stream, the quality drop was huge. The only reason I can see for limiting the bitrate based on the source is if we feel that the max bitrates, resolution etc. requested by clients are not accurate and we need to \"help\" them with that decision. \nThe anamorphic detection now allows for a small amount of distortion without flagging it as anamorphic which should prevent issues with badly encoded streams. If it does get flagged then the distortion would likely be noticeable visually.\n. ",

    "altf4": "I should have said. I'm using:\nVersion 3.0.5518.7\n. Good comments! For sure, the only way to ensure confidentiality when submitting user credentials is an end-to-end encrypted channel. No amount of client side hashing can solve that problem. HTTPS being mandatory would be a great step forward for security. Though that can be considered separately from the question of how to store credentials in the backend.\n@jabbera One option to consider for for certificate validation on thick clients is certificate pinning. The idea is that rather than using the Certificate Authorities built into the platform, you create an Emby CA, hardcode its public key into the thick clients (Android app, Roku app, etc...), then have the client validate against that CA. It effectively bypasses the main weakness in HTTPS: The certificate authorities. It's more secure (because you're only trusting one CA and not the whole list of foreign governments in the default CA list) and more convenient.\nWhat this would let you do is provide (perhaps just to paid subscriber people. Monetization opportunity!) an Emby supplied HTTPS certificate that their thick client apps will just recognize and be cool with. No need to (perhaps unsafely) ignore SSL errors. The only area where this doesn't work is in the browser. There is no thick app to hardcode a cert into. But perhaps manually accepting a funny SSL cert one time in the browser is worth it \"just working\" on all the other platforms.\nCertificate Pinning\nhttps://www.owasp.org/index.php/Certificate_and_Public_Key_Pinning\nThanks!\n. @ebr11 You are correct that HTTPS is really necessary for a secure transport of credentials to the server. But supposing that this is impossible for some reason, it is still a security vulnerability to send client-hashed passwords as Emby currently does. \nIt feels strange, I know. But consider every major website on the Internet. Until relatively recently, sites like Google, Facebook, and Twitter had HTTP as the default, and an optional HTTPS site. (Similar to Emby's current configuration) And what they did was send plaintext passwords via HTTP, and hash them on the backend. That is the most secure option.\n. Not true. The EFF's HTTPS-Everywhere project was created specifically because of the problem of major websites having HTTP as default. In each of these cases, user credentials were being sent in plaintext over HTTP, before the switch.\nHTTPS-Everywhere\nhttps://www.eff.org/HTTPS-EVERYWHERE\n2011: Twitter announces option to use HTTPS by default\nhttps://blog.twitter.com/2011/making-twitter-more-secure-https\n2013: Facebook switches to HTTPS default\nhttps://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/secure-browsing-by-default/10151590414803920\n2010: Gmail switches to HTTPS default\nhttp://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/default-https-access-for-gmail.html\n(They had a user option for it, previously)\n. Good question. It is a hardcoded public key, as in asymmetric cryptography. So it is not a secret. The reason you hardcode it in the app is to have a secure way of distributing it, in the same way that every other CA certificate is distributed in the browser. \nPublic Key Cryptography\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography\n. Just to recap: The certificate pinning thing is just a suggestion for a possible way to handle HTTPS for thick client apps. It's really separate from the question of how to store credentials once the server has received them. If you would like, I could make a separate github issue to implement (and discuss) certificate pinning. \nTo answer your questions, I am not familiar with the Emby backend infrastructure so it's hard for me to say definitively what's possible, but it does not require anything major. Pinning is something that is really common for app developers, and a good security measure. But it can definitely be described as a \"nice-to-have\".\nTLS certificates come in two halves: private and public. The public certificate is the thing that the server sends out to clients in order to prove who it is. This certificate is not a secret and is the thing that you look at when you view the certificate for the current website you're at. For example, here is Github's public TLS cert:\n\nThe web browser knows to trust this certificate because it has been issued by DigiCert, which is a certificate authority built into the browser. The certificate authority system is the main weakness in HTTPS, since any certificate authority is capable of creating a valid certificate for any website, thus being able to spy on it. There has been lots of precedent for CAs being compromised by hackers or otherwise coerced by local governments, so this is a real issue.\nCertificate pinning solves this problem by creating your own certificate authority, and telling your app \"Trust only this CA, and no others\". This drastically reduces your surface area for risk in HTTPS. There are no TLS error to ignore, since clients will be given a valid certificate signed by an authority they trust.\nSo you would in fact need to keep the Emby CA private key a secret, but only in the same way that any other site (including every other open source project) keeps their TLS keys secret. I noticed there is an HTTPS site: https://connect.mediabrowser.tv/ It would be no different than that.\nI hope that helps. \n. ",
    "xmob": "But by sending a password hash and comparing it to the hash in the database, you are sending passwords in plain text.\nHow things are at the moment is the same as sending the password in plaintext and storing the passwords in the database as plaintext.\n. ",
    "telyn": "You could automatically generate the private key on startup. However I personally feel like this is over-engineering it. I agree with @altf4's original post and @xmob - the current setup is equivalent to storing passwords in plaintext on the database. Storing passwords salted and hashed, and have the client send the password in plaintext (over an encrypted transport) is all Emby really needs to do in my opinion.\nFor over-the-internet situations, let it be up to the person installing Emby to provide the SSL certificate and keys for their hostname. What I myself do is place Emby behind nginx and use nginx for SSL termination, but I admit that I haven't investigated how my Chromecast connects to it in that case.\n. ",

Altough I'll have to match every album manually... While the found album has the exact same name as the album in my library, ABBA - ABBA. Why is this not working automatically?. Yea, I did it for one album and it worked, check the EDIT of my previous post.. I did some manual refreshes of a few albums and music artits. Manual refreshes start here in the log:\n2018-02-04 15:18:51.680 Debug App: Running AlbumNfoProvider for /storage/media/music/ABBA - ABBA\nLog.txt. I've taken another shot at trying Emby. I'm determined to switch over (even bought premiere!).\nI'm still dealing with this issue and have no clue why its happening with only my music collection.\nI have also transitioned to the recommended library directory structure for music to be found on the wiki of Emby. Does emby even look at the directory structure to figure out to what artits an album belongs?\nI have no mp3 tags for my songs and my libraries are read/execute only. Altough don't think this is the issue as movies/series don't have this and are also read/execute only to Emby. I also noticed that none of my albums have a music brains ID tag set (or any other). They only show a picture in the library if a picture is contained in the song files.. Can this issue be reopened?. \nserver-63665395200.txt\nserver-63665433074.txt\nOk, so the picture to indicate what my library looks like atm. Two log files attached when adding my music library. No musing matching is happening. When entering ID tags of musicbrainz manually, it works just fine.. Alrighty thanks thats nice to hear! The \"our own package\" is still compatible with the ports framework of FreeBSD I reckon? If I want to, for example, compile Emby from source?. Alright thanks for the update Luke! Give FreeBSD some love! I guess we can leave this issue open. I'll get back to this once the new version lands.. Hello, I updated to emby package 3.5 for FreeBSD and readded my music library. Altough I'm still not seeing any pictures of metadata on the albums... :(. Ok provided a log file of adding my music library. I added my library at 10h:42m:50s. Do you think that adding mp3 tags to my music collection will help in this? Altough I prefer it fetches based on directory structure... a bit easier to maintain. I'm not sure if you can troubleshoot the problem from the log (debug logging enabled).\nLog.txt\n. Ok so what I did as a test was the following; I gave the songs of an album mp3 tags (artist = ABBA, album = ABBA) and gave it a manual refresh. After the refresh it found musicbrainz ID's and filled them in. The given mp3 tags are identical to my directory structure i.e. :\n/Artistname (ABBA)\n---Albumname (ABBA)\n------ Song1.mp3\n------ Song2.mp3\n------ Songx.mp3\nSo from mp3 tags it can obtain the album/artits and find the associated musicbrainz ID's.\nEDIT: I did this for my whole library using mp3tag and now all my albums are matching. Altough this did fix my issue issue I feel like its a hack for the bug in question. I.E. directory structure -> musicbrainz id's.. ",

I would imagine we would adopt the same kind of approach as\nXmlTV. What we did there was create a standalone class library and I think\nthat's a good way to go here. So you'd start by creating a library that can\nread the xsp to an object, as well as save the xsp back to a file. You can\ndefine the object inside the library. Once we have the library, then we can\nlook at deciding how Emby Server will make use of it. You'll also want to\nmake sure it has unit tests along with some sample files.\nThe only part that's somewhat of a pain is that it needs to be a PCL\ntargeting Win 8.1/.NET 4.5. That is really the best approach right now for\ndual compatibility with .NET and .NET Core.\nThat means file system access won't be available, so you'll want to have\nthe library just work with a Stream.

That's the reason I want to use ApacheDS as LDAP server, create centralized accounts for every user and manage their roles by group memberships. \nAll other software I'm using like the mentioned NextCloud has LDAP support. Only Emby is missing, which is pity, since it's a great software in his job. . Hi, thanks for your quick reply!

Hi @LukePulverenti, thanks for the quick reply! \nThis was also my suggestion, but it doesn't seem to work. I made several changes and got the old ones after a page reload.

Sorry for the commit/revert noise. I am new to GIT (but not to development).\n. @psxlover: Hmpf, yeah, now I realized that I need to create a branch for each feature and that I need to keep my forked main branch clean. Thanks for the commands I will try it to get my main branch clean.\n@Luke: The setting is not for \"Perform leftover-file and empty-folder deletion in processed folders only\"\nIt is for a different feature \"Disable multi-episode detection\" which I mixed up because I didn't know that I need to create separate branches.\n@ebr11: These file operations are pretty fast, so from a performance perspective it wouldn't really matter, but I agree that using a dictionary or even better HashSet should be used instead\n. OK, I have finally managed to move the second feature to a separate branch and created another pull request for that. Thanks to @psxlover I also managed to get rid of the unnecessary commits!\n. Finallly, I have changed the List to a HashSet as proposed by @ebr11 \n(and even managed to merge it into a single commit using git rebase - I'm learning... ;-)\n. Excellent point. I fixed it now while also making sure that actual watch folders do not get deleted in case a media file was found there\n. Casing is not the only aspect in which two file paths pointing at the same target could differ:\n- 8.3 vs full naming\n- Environment variables\n- Symbolic links\n- Navigation components (C:\\temp..\\temp.\\ == c:\\temp)\nare the issues I wanted to rule out.\n. But it turns out that GetFullPath resolves 8.3 naming and indirections (..) while it does not resolve environment variables and casing.\nAfter some research: A definite solution is not available using .NET and would require p/Invoke (GetFileInformationByHandle). \nI left GetFullPath in the commit but added comment and StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase as requested.\n. From the discussion, one might get the impression that  this change request is questionable. But in fact, the discussion was just about reliable folder comparison, and the comparison method used in this change is probably slightly better than the usual employed method with no drawbacks involved. \nSo I think this is still a good change...\n. I don't understand why it says conflict. There is no conflict in the changd file..\n. I created a new pull request which does not believe in a conflict: #1199\n. The original purpose of this change was to overcome problems with multi-episode detection.\nOnce the changes from \nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/pull/1189 and https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby.Naming/pull/4\nare incorporated, then there is probably no more need for this change!\n. It is required to supply the length of the season (=target) folder path, because this length is required to calculate the max filename length.\n. I know the article from Kim Hamilton and had even read it a few times in the past. If you read further into the topic, you will find, that many things in .NET do not work with the \\?\\ notation. Would we start allowing this, lots of regressions would be guaranteed and the complete code would need to be reviewed. In certain situations, .NET code would need to be replaced with p/invoke, which is not portable, of course.\nBut it's not just the technical aspect. Would you really want that a multi-episode file gets a name like\n'Homeland S04E1-12 - The Drone Queen, Trylon and Perisphere, Shalwar Kameez, Iron in the Fire, About a Boy, From A to B and Back Again, Redux, Halfway to a Donut, There's Something Else Going On, 13 Hours in Islamabad, Krieg Nicht Lieb, Long Time Coming.mkv'\nI don't think this is a good idea anyway...\n. Your proposed solution is not reliable:\n- It does not work when episode title is modified through fileSystem.GetValidFilename\n- It does not work when episode-name patterns %e.n and %e_n are used\n- It may create files that start with a space character\n. Another suggestion (based on my commit): \n- Instead of adding parameter int destPathLength to _GetEpisodeFileName, add parameter int? maxLength to this method\n- Perform calculation of the maximum available filename length from within the caller of GetEpisodeFileName\nThis way GetEpisodeFileName will remain portable (if that was the point of your concern), and the things I mentioned in my previous post would still be solved.\nFinally one more thing: We need to subtract 4 more characters from the allowed length, otherwise subtitle downloading could fail... (Think of filename.eng.srt)\nWhat do you think?\n. Hmpf, I screwed this, because I rebased against dev. I'll create a new pull request!\n. Why do you think it is bad to store these match strings in the same way as all oher data is stored?\nCan you suggest an alternative way to store?\nAs far as I'm concerned, I do not care about where the match info is stored - but what I deem really important is a way to view and edit this information...\n. But in this case, editing via the Metadata manager would not be possible, right?\n. Pardon, what's metabrowser? Is it different from Metadata Manager?\n. Hey Luke, \nplease don't leave me alone with a vague suggestion here. It's your project, your rules, you are the architect!\nTell me how you want this feature to be implemented and I will do as requested... \n. I still don't understand how metabrowser is related to auto-organize. Could you please post a screenshot of the UI you are refering to?\n. Well, if the UI is of no interest, then there is no point in looking at metabrowser.\nThe workflow you described, is exactly what I had implemented anyway.\nNow I have changed my implementation as you requested: The matching strings are now stored in the AutoOrganize config and the UI for deleting those strings is within the dashboard's auto-organize section.\nThe workflow is as follows:\n1. A file fails Auto-Organization because the Item-(Series-)Name cannnot be resolved\n2. The user can now organize the file manually from the Auto-Organize Log\n3. I have added an option to this dialog to save the match string:\n\n1. If the option is checked, the match string is saved to the autoorganize.xml file and in the future, all files with this string are automatically matched to the library item\n2. I have called this feature \"Smart Match\" and added a UI directly in the dashboard:\n\nCurrently match strings can be deleted only. Probably a method for adding custom strings, will not be required anyway. It is just important to be able to review the smart match configuration and to correct undesired settings.\nWhat to you think?\n. Regarding translations: Can you suggest a tool to edit all string files in a synchronous way?\nRegarding style: I am already using the existing styles  - actually I copied a few bits from the scheduled tasks page. What's do you think is wrong? \nPS: I just tweaked this a bit to get series names bigger and match strings smaller. But I will gladly leave the visual tweaking up to someone else..\n. OK, good to know that. I tried some localization tool and it screwed up all files..\n. @psxlover: The important thing here is, that we are NOT matching against the filename. We are matching against the series name that emby has extracted through its regex patterns and cleanup methods.\nFor this reason it is very unlikely that euhd is the series name and elefantastisch an episode name, because this is already the parsed result.\nAs to the second case: Yes, currently you have to repeat the procedure for a title with a different release group. But cases with more than two or three different release groups are probably rare.\nBut I understand your idea and I had thought about that, too. The thing is: Before this change, emby was matching the regex-extracted series name by exact comparison: exractedName == seriesName.\nMy change keeps that method, it just adds alternate recognition strings.\nWhat you are proposing would be a substring match. E.g.: the extracted name is \"zzgtv-anger\" and you would like the user to be able to change this through a textbox to \"anger\". In order to make this work, the matching would need to be changed from exact matching to substring matching. This is a bit dangerous, because when there is another series containing 'anger' in the title, it would be incorrectly organized. You may say, that this is a rare case, but there are even more implications with substring matching: The watch folders may not just receive tv series episodes but also movies or songs or some other stuff. This makes it very likely that - at some point in time - you may receive a file where the regex-extracted name contains the word \"anger\" and this file would be organized incorrectly. Due to the automatic handling with file-move, folder deletion and renaming, you may not even notice what has gone wrong.\n=> This is why substring matching is a very bad thing in that case.\nI thought about that for quite a while, but in the end I always came to the conclusion that substring matching would cause many more problems than it would solve. \nOf course, you will have to go through the organize correction dialog two times, if the files are from two release groups, but that is at least much better than doing it 24 times for a single season...\n. A future improvement I have in mind would be this: Once you have completed the correction dialog and checked the \"Smart Match\" option, the server could go through the failed log entries and retry organization. This would help in cases where you already have an amount of failed files in the log (e.g. all containing 'zzgtv-anger'). \nEdit: This is unnecessary, because the other files will be picked up during the next organize run anyway!\n. This feature is now also included in #1202\n. I tried to implement this in an independent way where SmartMatch is not restricted to TV organization but rather a feature that could be shared by other organization methods which may be added in the future (at least in theory).\nSince we are dealing here with a structure that is persisted to the users' configuration files, there is no easy way to change this in the future. I.e.: If we put SmartMatch data directly into TvFileOrganizationOptions instead of AutoOrganizeOptions, we would run into a problem later..\nRegarding NameValuePair: I don't think that this is an appropriate structure for 1->n entities. Also, considering the resulting xml structure of the config file, I'd say that my approach produces better results...\nI have employed some simplification of the storage just now - see the last commit...\nBut if you insist on NameValuePair - tell me and I'll do so!\n. OK, I'll move it to TvOrganizeOptions.\nRegarding one-to-many: Just look at the screenshot:\n\n. Nonetheless, I think it would stiil be worth, talking about the auto-organize architecture:\nWith this change, I modified several function signatures to use AutoOrganizeOptions instead of TvOrganizeOptions.\nThe other thing I'm working on already does rely on this change:\n- EpisodeFileOrganizer gets a new base class FileOrganizerBase\n- A new class MovieFileOrganizer derives from this same class\nAs a consequence, the individual function signatures should not use a specific options class (like TvOrganizeOptions) but a generic options class instead (like AutoOrganizeOptions)\nIf you like I surely can move the smart match strings to TvOrganizeOptions. But what is the actual advantage over the alternate way? I squeezed my head but didn't get an idea...\n. This is an independent subset of changes included in pull request #1202 anyway. If #1202 would be merged, this PR could be closed.\n. OK, hold on...\n. Hmpf, I need help. I rebased to dev and fixed up everything.\nThen I did \"git push --force\"\nSuddenly this branch is targeting \"MediaBrowser:master\". I'm sure it was targeting \"MediaBrowser:dev\" before.\nI read in many places that retargeting a pull request is not possible and not supported, but in my case the target branch HAS changed. That's kind of weird, at least..\n. This pull request (or rather its branch) seems to be seriously broken.\nThus, I created a new pull request #1432 to replace this one!\n. PS: An easy way to test this is to remove or rename a file that could not be auto-organized and then try manual correction\n. How should this be done?\nI can localize \"Status:\", but I cannot localize the errors that come from the server...\n. Please clarify: Do you mean just localization of the \"Status\" label? Or is there more to it?\n. OK, done!\n. It's the message box header, so no multiple lines.\n. Then I'll do\nHeader: \"Error\"\nand move the rest to the message, OK?\n. OK, done!\n. If you want localized ordering of the elements (i.e. first statusText then status), then the previous variant using {0} and {1} (which you didn't like) would have been capable to achieve this.\nHere are some examples where the X-Application-Error-Code header is needed to indicate the actual error to the user:\n- User opens and completes the correction dialog for a file that does not exist anymore\n- User opens and completes the correction dialog for an existing file but the file cannot be copied to the target location (drive or path not accessible, file in use, no access permissions, volume full, etc.)\nIn the current public release, the correction dialog just remains visible forever in all of these cases. This behaviour is even more irritating when you consider the fact that in case of a successful completion, you will experience a similar result: The correction dialog remains visible until the file move operation is completed. As a consequence, the user keeps waiting and waiting assuming that he's waiting for the file move operation to complete while in reality the operation has failed long ago.\nI think it is important in these cases to indicate such failures to the user not only as a generic message (like \"An error has occured\") but also provide some useful information about this error. The X-Application-Error-Code provides exactly this, so I did not look any further.\n. Retargeting a pull request seems to be a no-go with GIT.\nWill create a new pull request.\nClosed.\n. I really tried and tried again, but in the end, it always said \"Can\u2019t automatically merge\". I really don't know why, because there is no actual conflict in the file. \nPlease help me, before I start hating GIT ;-)\n. @psxlover Thanks for your help! The problem is that this change is in my forked master branch and I have several feature branches based on this master branch. When I rebase my master branch, will this affect my other feature branches? Or is it save to do it?\n. Thanks again. I already had found out how to add the original Emby as upstream project in order to rebase, but I wasn't sure about the consequences on the other branches...\nOne last thing: When I create a new branch including this change and rebase that branch, can I update this pull request to use the changes from the new branch, or is the only way to close this pull request an create a new one?\n. And finally: In the future, should I always submit pull requests against the dev branch, or just this one?\n. I suspected this, that you can't change a pull request's source branch, so I took the way through a new pull request. The inconvenient thing with this procedure is, that all discussion that the issue may have gone through lives in a different place then (like in this closed PR).\nThanks for your thoughts about the targeting branch. I was unsure since all my pull requests were against master and nobody complained...\n@LukePulverenti So one should always target pull requests to the dev branch, right?\n. OK, will do!\n. Resubmit of #1199 against dev branch.\n. This is a follow-up to pull request #1199, targeting MediaBrowser:dev instead\n. Thanks! :-)\n. This is the process to organize a file as a movie:\n\nClick on \"Movie\"\n- The Movie and Year fields are set to the values from Emby's integrated movie name parsing feature\n- Depending on your media source and its naming standards you may need to adjust the name field at least in order to get appropriate search results:\n\n- Now click the Identify button to get a list of search results:\n\n- Select an item from the result view or click Cancel and you will be returned to the previous dialog\n- There you can also select a base target folder from a list containing all of your library folders for movies\n- Click OK and the movie will automatically be organized according to the choices you made\n. This is how the \"Create Series\" feature is supposed to work:\n\n- Click on \"New Series\"\n- You will get a dialog similar to the one for movie identification:\n\n- Enter/correct series name\n- Click \"Identify\"\n- Choose series from search results or click \"Cancel\"\nNow you would click \"Create Series\" and be returned to the initial dialog with the newly created series selected in the series dropdown field.\nBeware: This last step is not implemented yet!!\n. Rebased to and adapted for dev/HEAD\n. Completed the \"New Series\" feature for the auto-organize-correction dialog.\n. No. These two features are sharing quite a few things...\n. But you could just hide the tab switch element:\n\nin the html\n. PS: I spent endless hours trying to do this with paper-tabs. In the main branch this worked without problems, but not in the dev branch. Paper-tabs are working just fine in the normal html, but not in a popup. I even tried to migrate the jQuery popup to Paper-Dialog, but same result: Paper-tabs didn't work...\n. Yes, localization is still pending!\n. > the reason i want the tabs is to keep user decision making strictly in the vertical direction. \n\nAlso the identify button in the middle is kind of clunky. It's unclear if i need to click it or not.\nIf it's not required, then we need to decrease it's level of prominence and maybe just turn it \ninto a search icon button next to the name field.\n\nI abolutely agree! I think the \"New Series\" button should be a small button right to the series dropdown. I just didn't do it because I couldn't find a precedence case in the existing UI markup which I could adapt accordingly. Multi-targeting html code is out of my focus anyway, so I wasn't sure if horizontal stacking is allowed at all..\n\nIf it's required, then every field that comes after should be unavailable until the identify process is completed. That way there's only one button to click on. \n\nI agree. But I couldn't find an appropriate \"disabled\" style for the input.\n\nCan you also change the style of popup to what is being used by the normal identify popup? \nif you do that, then you'll have no problem switching to the newer paper elements, \nand there will be a search icon button that can be used.\n\nThe paper-dialog was just a local experiment. In the submitted code there is no change to the popup method. I also don't have any individual popups. It's always the correction dialog with variable content...\n. I had a look and found that I can't use the itemidentifier as a component. It is built specifically for the library identification process (displaying the identify options and calling \"Items/RemoteSearch/Apply/\").\nAlso dealing with multiple stacked popups -- I don't know how well that would work. That whole html/css/jss stuff is among the top 3 on my hate list :-)  - So I wanted to avoid changes that may break something.\nBut during my frustrating efforts to get paper-tabs working, I already had migrated the popup to paper-dialog once - so I could at least do that again and also replace the cancel button, if that's OK?\n. OK, understood! Then I'll leave it all in a single popup as paper-dialog. On Chrome is resizes fine, but if it doesn't on other platforms, there are still appropriate methods provided by the paper-dialog to fix this. Right?\n. So you are saying I should implement the complete auto-organize popup as a component?\n. So, the important thing is that the popup markup is not contained in the actual page html?\nProbably a good idea since the jQuery popup is sometimes visible for a short time when the page loads. And I can get rid of the code to reset all form fields for subsequent popup displays.\nBut in the normal html folder there are no other .template.html files... Wouldn't it be more consistent, to put it in a component subfolder, then? (or in a template tag in the actual page markup)\n. Sorry for my detailed asking. I just don't wanna do it twice or thrice...\n- Should I also migrate all form inputs to the corresponding paper-versions?\n- How can I arrange the \"New Series\" button horizontally to the right of the series dropdown? (I mean in a portable way... no problem to make it work in a desktop browser).\n. The good, the bad and the ugly:\nI followed the component pattern. Works fine so far! \n- The good: paper-tabs are working again with this pattern! I migrated back to paper-tabs!\n- The bad: While Polymer may be a newer and better approach for html multi-targeting, it has gotten even harder once again to investigate, debug and identify what's really going on when things are not working as expected\n- The ugly: Width: 80%? This doesn't even succeed with a single browser - as long as you don't write some dedicated code to adjust this. Or am I missing something here? The requirement would be as follows: 1. Button width should be constrained to a fixed minimum determined by the caption text. 2. Dropdown width should expand to fill the remaining space. On all supported platforms... I doubt if that could really be achieved without writing js code....\nMy next step will be to replace the html inputs with Polymer controls....\n. Migrated most form inputs to paper-controls. \nPerformed new vulcanization because paper-dropdown-menu was missing.\nReplaced Cancel buttons in favor of the new back button.\n. Hmpf, spent quite a but of time on that...\n. Are you really sure that Polymer is ready for productive use?\nI encountered so many problems - just using Chrome, which should be the best for Polymer...\nI wonder how that works on other browsers (desktop and mobile)...\n. But when mixing paper-input controls with classic controls (like SELECT), there will be a different look&feel...\nThis is the latest screen shot:\n\nThe paper-inputs have that special super-duper-feature to display their label in a big version within the input while the input is empty and this label shrinks and moves to the top of the input once the user has entered some data. According to the docs this behaviour can be deactivated by adding an attribute \"alwaysFloatLabel\" which does not actually work, though. But it works, when you add an \"always-float-label\" attribute.\nHaving to check out such things is burning huge amounts of work time. I'm not really sure if Polymer is such a good alternative (at least at this time).\nWhen you are saying now, that html option select should not be migrated to its corresponding paper control, we will end up with mixed controls of different look&feel. Then you would have to invest even more time to make these look and behave at least in a similar way. Is it really worth the effort?\n. Yes, please, I would be really grateful if you could do that!\nOrganize Movies #8 was the transition to paper-dialog and\nOrganize Movies #9 was the migration to paper-input (and switching to the back-button)\nSo you could use everything until and including \"Organize Movies #8\" and use just those parts of \"Organize Movies #9\" that you would consider useful...\n. The previous attempt (Organize Movies #9) to migrate all controls to paper-controls didn't work out well, so I reverted that change.\nThis commit should get it all working again!\nThe switch to paper-dialog as a component (technically) and the new dialog layout style (back button in the upper corner replacing individual cancel buttons)  is completed now and most of the obvious bugs should be fixed.\n. Improve AutoOrganize-Feedback \nThis commit improves client feedback for auto-organization.\nAs a result, the organize-log is updated for each item separately, not just as a single update once the organize task has completed.\n(This change depends on the introduction of the new websocket message \"AutoOrganizeUpdate\" inside this branch, so I can't separate it into a different pull request...)\nThis change also fixes the Organize-Taskbutton functionality in the auto-organize log (part 1: adjusted style of progress bar; part 2: added basic execution delay)\n. Update auto-organize log in all clients on single log item deletion or clear log action\nWhen two or more clients are displaying the auto-organize log at the same time:\n- When deleting an item, all clients  are instantly updated now\n- When clearing the log, all clients are instantly updated now\n(This change depends on the introduction of the new websocket message \"AutoOrganizeUpdate\" inside this branch, so I can't separate it into a different pull request...)\n. ...rebased to current dev branch.\n. Added server side locking to prevent duplicate item processing and changed the autoorganize list to display a processing indicator.\nPlease see the following video: https://youtu.be/Lq4RGXVh_os\n. AutoOrganize: Instant completion of correction dialog \nWhen the autoorganize correction dialog is submitted, the server service waits just 2s to complete the request.\nThese 2s are to wait for an exception that might occur. In this case the exception is forwarded to the client and the web UI will immediately display a message overlay with the error message.\nOtherwise the ajax call is returned after 2s and the dialog gets closed in the client UI. The organization progress is then displayed in the autoorganize list (orange text color and spinner animation).\n. Once again, rebased to latest dev...\n. AutoOrganize: Make LeftoverDeletion and EmptyFolderDeletion also work with manual organization:\nPreviously the auto-organize features LeftoverDeletion and EmptyFolderDeletion only worked when organization was performed through the internal scheduled task.\nThis commit makes these features also work for all manual organize operations:\n- Organize via correction dialog (series or movie)\n- Retry organization when target is already set (series or movie)\n- Delete file\nTo make this work in various situations, the code for these two features was refactored into FileOrganizerBase.cs without functional changes.\nThis commit also improves the automatic search term for movie organization.\n. Over the time I always tried to extract certain changes to a separate branch.\nSometimes it works, but sometimes it doesn't. I always tried to isolate changes as good as I could, but in this branch there are too many changes where many of them are depending on others. \nI am testing my code every day on quite a few real world scenarios. I think I have achieved a state which is rather stable and really worth looking into it.\nI know that this has grown quite a bit over the time, but looking at the details, it is not that much stuff that has changed.\nTo help you a bit looking through the changes, I have compiled a minimal list explaining all of my changes. It should be in the same order as it is presented here on github.\n. -   MediaBrowser.Api/Library/FileOrganizationService.cs\n  -   Added properties for new series organization\n  -   Added method for movie organization\n  -   Added methods for Smart Match entry management\n-   MediaBrowser.Controller/FileOrganization/IFileOrganizationService.cs\n  -   Added Dictionary for InProgressItems\n  -   Added methods for movie organization and for Smart Match entry management\n-   MediaBrowser.Model/FileOrganization/AutoOrganizeOptions.cs\n  -   Added SmartMatch options via composition\n-   MediaBrowser.Model/FileOrganization/BaseFileOrganizationRequest.cs\n  -   Created as a base class for the existing EpisodeFileOrganizationRequest and the new MovieFileOrganizationRequest\n-   MediaBrowser.Model/FileOrganization/EpisodeFileOrganizationRequest.cs\n  -   Added properties for new series creation feature\n-   MediaBrowser.Model/FileOrganization/FileOrganizationResult.cs\n  -   Added some new properties: IsInProgress for dynamic progress display in the client and two others for movie organization\n-   MediaBrowser.Model/FileOrganization/MovieFileOrganizationRequest.cs\n  -   New class for movie organization\n-   MediaBrowser.Model/FileOrganization/SmartMatchInfo.cs/ SmartMatchOptions.cs\n  -   New configuration classes for the SmartMatch feature\n-   MediaBrowser.Server.Implementations/FileOrganization/EpisodeFileOrganizer.cs\n  -   Made subclass of the new FileOrganizerBase\n  -   Changed options usage up one level (AutoOrganizeOptions instead of TvFileOrganizationOptions) to enable access to SmartMatch options\n  -   Parse and store movie naming to optionally allow treating a file as a movie\n  -   Already save result at the beginning of the function to enable dynamic display of organization progress\n  -   Also perform LeftOverDeletion and EmptyFolderDeletion on manual organization operations\n  -   Implemented SmartMatch feature to remember certain strings as item identification\n  -   Improved error handling and error display \u2013 generally and especially in PerformFileSorting()\n  -   Implemented series matching via SmartMatch strings\n  -   Fixed bug when providers don\u2019t return episode titles\n-   MediaBrowser.Server.Implementations/FileOrganization/FileOrganizationService.cs\n  -   Added ConcurrentDictionary for items that are currently being processed\n  -   All returned FileOrganizationResult objects are updated with a valid IsInProgress property\n  -   Can now handle episode as well as movie corrections (depending on result.Type)\n  -   Implemented a new Websocket message \"AutoOrganizeUpdate\", to tell the client to update its organize list\n-   MediaBrowser.Server.Implementations/FileOrganization/FileOrganizerBase.cs\n  -   Base class for the existing EpisodeFileOrganizer and the new MovieFileOrganizer\n  -   All methods which are common to both variants were moved here\n  -   Implemented cleanup of parsed movie names for movie organization\n  -   Implementation of features \u201cLeftOverDeletion\u201d and \u201cEmptyFolderDeletion\u201d was moved here\n-   MediaBrowser.Server.Implementations/FileOrganization/ItemInProgressException.cs\n  -   New custom exception which allows specific handling of this exception in certain situations (=> throw error on manual organization, ignore errors and continue during auto-organization as task)\n-   MediaBrowser.Server.Implementations/FileOrganization/ItemProgressLock.cs\n  -   New class to implement locking and status of items currently being processed\n  -   Implements IDisposable to enable usage with minimal code by employing the using-pattern\n  -   Throws ItemInProgressException is item is locked already\n-   MediaBrowser.Server.Implementations/FileOrganization/MovieFileOrganizer.cs\n  -   New class implementing (manual) movie organization\n  -   Currently the primary file is copied/moved only. This should be improved a bit in the future\n-   MediaBrowser.Server.Implementations/FileOrganization/OrganizerScheduledTask.cs\n  -   Just added some new dependency services\n-   MediaBrowser.Server.Implementations/FileOrganization/TvFolderOrganizer.cs\n  -   Added some new dependency services\n  -   Removed \u201cLeftOverDeletion\u201d and \u201cEmptyFolderDeletion\u201d features which were moved to FileOrganizerBase\n-   MediaBrowser.Server.Implementations/IO/FileRefreshItem.cs\n  -   Item class for the new refresh queue\n-   MediaBrowser.Server.Implementations/IO/FileRefreshQueue.cs\n  -   Timed queue class refactored out from LibraryMonitor, now grouping all items by parent folder and independently processing these groups\n  -   This approach is much more reliable/stable\n-   MediaBrowser.Server.Implementations/IO/LibraryMonitor.cs\n  -   Separated queue stuff into FileRefreshQueue\n  -   Remaining code is very simple now\n  -   FileRefreshQueue could be used for watching autoorganize folders (instead of polling)\n-   MediaBrowser.Server.Implementations/Persistence/SqliteFileOrganizationRepository.cs\n  -   I added two additional fields to the auto organize table to store the parsed movie name and year just in case that it is a movie that we are dealing with\n  -   I did this for the following reasons:\n    -   The SqLite variant provides a proven storage method from which I didn\u2019t want to deviate, replace or amend\n      I just didn\u2019t want to come up with something where people could have thought that I wanted to outnumber anyone else or overtake the project lead\n    -   Code changes were minimal for this, so it jumped right into my head\n  -   Alternative: Generate these strings just on the fly and don\u2019t store them in the db table\n-   MediaBrowser.Server.Startup.Common/ApplicationHost.cs\n-   Minimal changes\n-   MediaBrowser.WebDashboard/dashboard-ui/apiclient/apiclient.js\n  -   Added methods for SmartMatch and movie organization\n-   MediaBrowser.WebDashboard/dashboard-ui/autoorganizelog.html\n  -   Refactored correction popup into component\n-   MediaBrowser.WebDashboard/dashboard-ui/autoorganizesmart.html\n  -   Management of new SmartMatch feature\n-   MediaBrowser.WebDashboard/dashboard-ui/components/fileorganizer/fileorganizer.js\n  MediaBrowser.WebDashboard/dashboard-ui/components/fileorganizer/fileorganizer.template.html\n  -   UI for new organize-features\n-   MediaBrowser.WebDashboard/dashboard-ui/scripts/autoorganizelog.js\n  -   Removed correction functions\n-   MediaBrowser.WebDashboard/dashboard-ui/scripts/autoorganizesmart.js\n  -   Functions for new smart match feature\nMediaBrowser.Server.Implementations/IO/FileRefreshItem.cs\n. Sorry, that looks aweful. I'll try to find somethin better..\n. OK, I think I got it now - should be readable...\n. Rebased to the current dev branch...\n. Danergo,\nthis would be a complicated task. It's not just about the 44 files where I made changes. There are many more changes in the dev branch which my changes are relying on (just thinking of th Polymer components for html rendering).\nSooner or later these changes will be merged from dev to main, but in a consistent order, and then my changes will fit into the main branch as well. \nI we would create a branch from main and try to merge only my changes into it, we would need to start cherry-picking those changes from dev that my changes are relying on. But there are chains of dependencies that would need to be resolved manually with great effort, to pick all required changes. In the end, you might find that almost all dev branch commits must be included and the issues with Mono are inherited as weil...\nSo not, it's not (economically) possible this way!\nThe way to go is to fix the Mono issue in the dev branch. What problem do you have? Did you create an issue?\nRegards,\nsoftworkz\n. I've seen your conversation with Luke at Emby Community. He is the right guy for this problem!\n. Unfortunately it hasn't been merged yet.\nLuke is very busy at the moment and is plannng to merge my changes manually.\nI hope he will find some time soon.\nIn the meantime I am trying to keep this up-to-date with all other changes in this branch.\nAt my site it is running great so far. I successfullly organized many new series and movies yet...\n. - I didn't have this series in my library\n- I created a file \"The.Big.Bang.Theory S01E01.mkv\"\n- In the Auto-Organize-Dialog the series name was detected as \"The.Big.Bang.Theory\" \n- I chose \"Create new Series\" and clicked on \"Identify\" (without removing the dots)\n- The series was found and I selected the entry \n- The folder name was set to \"The Big Bang Theory (2007)\"\n- The folder was created and a \"Season 1\" folder was created inside\n- The episode was moved to this folder and renamed to \"The Big Bang Theory - S01E01 - Pilot.mkv\"\nI'd say, so far it worked just as it should!\n- After another library scan task had completed, the new series was recognized correctly and appropriate images were downloaded for series and season\n- Then I added another file \"The.Big.Bang.Theory S01E02.mkv\" to the auto-organize folder\n- It was matched to the series automatically (despite the dots), so in this case the smart match feature (which is new as well) wasn't even required\n(SmartMatch would help in cases where files are named like \"TBBT.S01E01.mkv\")\nThis behaviour appears to be fine as well!\n- I also tried creating a series folder named \"The.Big.Bang.Theory\" manually and added files like \"the.big.bang.theory...\".\n- In this case the episode was correctly identified as well\nThus, I suppose this is either fixed by \"my\" changes or - if not - we both tested this under different conditions..\n. Smart Matching is in the current beta and dev.\nNew series creation is in the current dev.\nMovie organization will hopefully follow soon..\n. I'm waiting for a number of fixes to be merged before I can go on with the movie stuff.\nIt's up to Luke when he'll do that\n. This feature has been implemented in a plugin:\nhttp://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/35246-new-plugin-organize-movies-with-movieorganizer/\n. I should note that there is a slight drawback: The search API does not return images. But when trying to identify a movie, a single result is not helpful, even if it comes with an image...\n. OK, I will try! If he'll do, we are still set - no additional change would be required..\n. OK, I sent a message to the owner of omdbapi. I sent you a copy as PM on http://emby.media/community (had no other idea how to send you something)\nLet's hope he will agree - at least I had a good argument...\n. OK, will do!\n. I'll also aggregate the image links. Sometimes one result does have an image while the other doesn't..\n. This change is now also included in #1202\n. Please see also: http://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/25946-auto-organize-has-stopped-working/\n. Oh well, the length check is already performed in the function IsValidVideoFile:\nIn case of a too long path, the FileInfo.FullName property will cause the exception.\nIf you are referring to the minimum file length check - these two are actually very different issues:\n- Path too long: Throw and log error but continue processing all other watched files\n- File too small: Silently ignore since it may be just a trailer or sample file\n. But of course I could rename it to FilterValidVideoFile...\n. I renamed the function to FilterValidVideoFile as requested. \n. Thank you! :-)\n. I understand. I'll revise it to group by folders...\n. But on the other hand: When grouping by folders: in case of a series folder, the library update would again be suppressed, when episodes are coming in continuously.\nThen the library will not be updated until the last episode is written. I would like to find a way to get the library updated on each episode one by one, not just hours later..\nHow should I do this? I could handle season folders differently...\n. OK, I will do the 'group by folders' approach - which is simple - and see how it goes...\n. Three new class files may not look like \"keep it simple\" at first sight, but I think that this is still a good solution because it is more modular and thus easy to understand, control and even modify.\nDespite the refactoring, semantics are preserved except:\n- Update requests are grouped by parent folders\n- Evaluation of 'tempIgnorePaths' is no longer done when queuing paths but instead performed when update paths are being processed. This change avoids the possibility of update paths being lost in certain situations\nIt's a bit difficult to get the whole picture just from viewing the diffs... but please tell me what you think!\n. - Renamed queue mechanism classes to a more generic wording. In the future, auto-organize folders could be watched in realtime same like library folders. In this case the FileRefreshQueue could be re-used to wait until files are being locked no longer\n- Made queue delay configurable\n- Added xml comments\n- Improved logging\n. ~~This is just an independent subset of changes included in pull request #1202 anyway. If #1202 would be merged, this PR can be closed.~~\n. I removed this change from PR #1202 because it didn't have any dependencies and can be treated separately...\n. Each series folder must have season subfolders by convention. That's how it is designed currently. Otherwise it won't work right.\n. > Emby works fine with or without season folders. It just makes a mess of any other folder in there, while > it should simply ignore unparsable folder names and look at the actual media files inside them.\nThat is a contradiction. You can't say it is working fine and it's making a mess at the same time.\nIf you would create season folders it should work fine. That's the currently favored structure. It may also work when all episodes are contained in a single folder, but obiously not when each episode is contained in its own folder directly below the series folder without season folders.\nThat's the current design. But any design can be modified or improved. If you decide to contribute to Emby and submit some improved code, there are good chances that it may be accepted.\nAlternatively you could simply create season folders, or use the autoorganize feature, which let's you put all new episodes into a single incoming folder from which they are automatically copied to the appropriate series/season folder.\n. I am wondering if this should be handled at the provider level to return something generic like \"Episode 1\"...\n. OK. I didn't do it anyway because the library seems to handle it fine.\n. This also includes changes from PR 1202 since it was built on top of it\n. I reverted my changes and adjusted autoorganize to use the latest provider change\n. Hold on, I will clear this up..\n. I'm closing this. The only functional difference I had in my code  was better propagation of errors to the user and in the log.\n. I added icons to distinguish files and folders. I used 'folder' for folders but 'menu' for files because I couldn't find an appropriate file icon.\nWe should see if we can find or create a generic file icon for this purpose...\n. The \"sprinkle\" (I'm interpreting this as \"changes to many files\") would still be required to pre-initialize the dialog with the current setting (12 of the 14 fiile changes are doing just this).\nThe parent directory contents are required to fill the dialog files list, even if a specific file is selected (and pre-initialized).\nJust merge this and you'll see that file dialogs are actually working as one would expect.\n(Two scenarious need to be tested: folder selection and file selection. File selection is used for the ssl certificate setting)\n. I implemented error handling directly in directorybrowser.js, not in apiclient!\nAs to the other issue. You wrote \n\nI don't want to have the api return the parent folder file list if you request children of a file\nWhat do you mean by \"children of a file\"? A file cannot have children.\n\nThe API path is \"/Environment/DirectoryContents\". It didn't seem unnatural for me if that API method would return all contents of a specified file's directory in case the path parameter points to a file.\nThat way appeared to be the most simple solution to me. I don't think that a client-only solution can be found in this case, because the client has no means to distinguish between files and folders. Thus, any alternative I can imagine would require the introduction of an additional API method like one of these:\n- GetDirectoryContentsOrFileSiblings\n  (same like my change but as a separate method leaving the original method unchanged)\n- IsFile\n  (to determine if item is file or directory and implement different handling in the client)\n- GetFileDirectoryOrDirectoryPath\n  (returns the containing directory path for files and the input path for folders)\nWhat's your preference?\n. OK, but couldn't we implement a generic mechanism for this that can be activated individually?\nMaybe this would be better than copying the same code over and over...\nApart from this, I also fixed accessing the response headers.\nresponse.headers[\"X-Application-Error-Code\"]\ndoes not work anymore. We need to use\nresponse.headers.get('X-Application-Error-Code')\ninstead\n. Yeah, I understood that.\nWhat I meant is something like a dashboard-function that can be specified as an error handler for individual apiclient calls.\nJust to avoid writing \"Dashboard.alert()\" stuff over and over again...\n. OK, but then at least the description should state, that it must be a PFX file without password.\nWe shouldn't let all users go through trial and error and having them finally find this information (PFX must not have password) somewhere in the forums...\n. Sorry, this is not what you denied with the previous discussion (= general handling of all exceptions)!\nIt is what you demanded: Error handling needs to be done individually.\nWhile the dashboard function is generic, it needs to be explicitly specified on each API call.\nThe other commit is just an example how to use it...\n. As requested I performed these changes:\n- Separated into a separate class because it needs a different ordering from other omdb providers\n- Implemented IHasOrder - made sure default order puts it after tvdb\n- Updated ServerConfiguration to disable it altogether by default\n- String.format calls now use CultureInfo.InvariantCulture\n. Finally added a migration task.\nAfter adding the new code, the provider became disabled once.\nThen I re-enabled the provider and on subsequent start-ups, it didn't get disabled again ==> Just as it is supposed to be...\n. @LukePulverenti recently posted this in the original PR:\n\nI'm ready to merge this one. Can you:\n\u2022sync to latest dev\n\u2022remove the de language text\n\u2022remove the javascript.json text\nThanks.\n. I did as requested:\n- Rebased to latest dev\n- Removed the de.json file changes\n- There was no modification to the javascript.json file anymore\n\nSome general notes about implementation:\n- SmartMatchInfos is a new property of the AutoOrganizeOptions class and not of the TvFileOrganizationOptions class. Even if we don't envision smart match functionality for anything but series episodes at this moment - the time may come (perhaps music organization by artist or something we couldn't think of by now) - or may never come. But the model is ready for this - just in case\n- EpisodeFileOrganizer: There are quite a few changes replacing TvFileOrganizationOptions by its parent class AutoOrganizeOptions. This is not only due to the previous topic. It is also a preparation for future Movie-Organization. Common functions from EpisodeFileOrganizer will be refactored to a base class FileOrganizerBase from which EpisodeFileOrganizer and the new MovieFileOrganizer will be derived. This is another second reason to use the more generic AutoOrganizeOptions class instead of TvFileOrganizationOptions\nYou wrote:\n\nThe ul data-role=listview should be changed to use the paper list instead of the jquery mobile widget\n\nAt the time I did that, I tried to find an existing view with similar functionality that I could use as a design prototype. That was \"scheduledtask.html\". It is still using data-role=listview, today. \nOnce you have changed that, I can try to follow...\n\nThe html page added is pulling in a bunch of jquery mobile dependencies but it doesn't look like they're all being used\n\nAre you referring to anything more than \"jqmtable,jqmpopup,scripts/autoorganizesmart,scripts/taskbutton,detailtablecss\"?\nI think \"jqmpopup\" and \"scripts/taskbutton\" could probably be removed. Or is it more you are referring to?\n\nLastly, avoid writing any new code that uses jquery, so this  $('.extractedName', popup).html(item.ExtractedName); \n\nI'm rarely writing new code (- in the case of html, css and javascript, at least!). I'm usually copying and adapting existing code to maximize compatibility. If you would name or suggest a prototype implementation, I could adapt the code in this PR to the specified style.\n. A few more notes:\n- the auto-organize task button is not working (i.e. not displaying a progress bar when active). I encountered this problem a while ago and fixed it in my working branch, but I don't remember what it was, right now\n- it doesn't work as smooth as it should. Sometimes the target series and target folder is determined correctly, but the file is not moved. When clicking on the dialog button, an \"OK/Cancel\" dialog is presented. Finishing with OK, actually copies the file\n- Even if far from perfect, this is an important and fundamental change, that so so many users have been waiting for a long time!\n. I really wonder why you are doing this...\nIf the ExtractedSeriesName is null or shorter than 4 characters - why would you want to display the checkbox in such cases? It just doesn't make any sense...\nSame issue with the display of the extracted series name. If the user can't see it, he won't be able to troubleshoot Emby against the current smart match configuration.\nWhy?\n. Rebased and reduced to remaining changes\n. Made some changes to group smart match strings by item:\n\n. Rebased and reduced to the missing pieces...\n. This is obsolete now..\n. OK, I'll change that. Should I also change the existing code?\n. OK, changed new code - does not use jquery selectors anymore and itemidentifier.showFindNew is now using native Promise instead of jquery deferred.\nI can also change fileorganizer to move away from jquery later, but I didn't want to overcrowd this PR..\n. You will need to look at the positioning of the \"New Series\" button. I used fixed percentage values for element widths, but this may be too small for other languages. I didn't find a way to match the button width to its text content and have the dropdown fill the rest of the total width of the row.\nOf course, you will also need to hide the new button afterwards, since the feature is not yet completed..\n. Actually I did the dropdown reset on purpose to remove any \"new Series\" entry that was added previously. Yes, it also clears the selection. I though this would be no issue because once you clicked on the \"New Series\" button, you won't be interested in a previous selection anyway.\nIs that OK, or do you still want me to change it?\n. Updated the branch:\n- No changes are made on cancelling\n- Replaced jQuery stuff in fileorganizer.js\n. Here are the required changes on the server-side to make the new series feature actually work.\nI reduced the changes to a minimum that is required to get it going\nThere is one thing which is very important to me and that I also included in this change: \nIt's selection of the target folder. If the user has more than just one folder configured for tv series content, he should be able to choose the root folder where the new series will be created.\nSo please: Do not drop this out for simplification! It is important for me and will be for other users as well. In the future, we can hide this dropdown by default and only display it when a user has configured multiple folders. (I haven't done that yet, in order to have a consistent testing scenario)\nDifferent issue: I'm not sure about how to compose the folder name for a new series. Currently I'm having that hardcoded as:\nseriesFolderName = string.Format(\"{0} ({1})\", seriesFolderName, series.ProductionYear);\nFor me that's OK but other users may have different opinions..\n. Apologies, I introduced these duplicate properties for testing and forgot about them since!\nRegarding auto-deserialization to a generic Dictionary: I couldn't find an existing case in the code, so I opted for manual deserialization at the API level for now.\n. I renamed the property NewSeriesProviderIdsDictionary to NewSeriesProviderIds.\nI also followed your hint at the updateServerConfiguration method, but there is no dictionary involved in the serialized content (not even to speak of a generic dictionary); furthermore the serialized object is coming from the server, modified at the client and returned back, which is not the case in this modification.\nI couldn't find an example in the current API where a Dictionary is involved (neither default nor generic)\n. Thanks for the hints!\nI really had my doubt's - but as a matter of fact it actually works, so here we go...\n. OK great, I will check!\n. I just tested, and it's working fine!\n. Use Exceptions instead of null return values\nPreviously some methods were just returning null  or empty values in case of encountered errors; as a consequence, the actual reason for failure was never propagated to the UI which instead just displayed a generic message like \"Unable to sort xxx because target path could not be determined.\"\nAfter this change, the actual reason for failure will be saved to the auto-organize log or displayed in the UI (when completing the organize dialog).\nThis information is quite important for the user. Examples are \"No permission\", \"Target folder not available\", \"Disk full\", etc..\n. Fixed error handling\n- adjusted onApiFailure handlers due to use of fetch API (using e.headers.get instead of e.getResponseHeader)\n- if a server-side exception occurs on completion of the correction dialog, the error message is now displayed as a message box in the client (transferred to the client as response header 'X-Application-Error-Code')\n. EpisodeFileOrganizer.GetNewPath; Throw Exception when metadata cannot be found\nBy throwing the Exception the message will added to the StatusMessage or\ndisplayed in the client.\nWithout this change, the user would see \"...because target path could\nnot be determined\", which is not helpful...\n. Rebased and added two additional fixes\n. Rebased. 4 commits remaining :-)\n. Here's a video demonstrating the visual result of this change:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lq4RGXVh_os\n. Rebased and consolidated commits.\nNEW: Removed jquery from autoorganizelog, autoorganizetv and autoorganizesmart!\n. Replaced by #2076\n. I used the unspecific name \"MovieDbProviderBase\" for the base class, because it could also serve as a base for MovieDbSeasonProvider, MovieDbSeriesProvider and MovieDbSeriesImageProvider in the future. There is still a lot of duplicate code.\n. I just added the same kind of migration task as I did for the OmdbEpisodeProvider. \nRegarding query performance I would like to note that the new provider is less critical than the OmdbEpisodeProvider because it caches its results to disk (same like TvdbEpisodeProvider).\n. Done!\n. Problem has been described here: http://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/32725-odd-thetvdb-fetcher-issue/\n. Cause has been an invalid fallback to absolute episode naming. In the mentioned case:\n- Metadata was requested for S19E04\n- TheTVDB does not have data for this season\n- This made the provider switch to absolute episode numbering and pick data from episode 4\nI corrected this behaviour in a way that\n- Normal episode numbering is used in when a season number is supplied with the lookup info\n- Absolute episode numbering is used when no seaon number is supplied\n- Cases are separated. No more fallthrough.\n. Why? \nThis would only help in situations where the series.zip file would contain \"episode-abs-{0}.xml\" files only, but no \"episode-{0}-{1}.xml\" files.\nI don't think that such cases exist. TheTvDb seems to always have a \"Season 1\" at least.\n. Sure, but what I mean is that the \"series.zip\" from thetvdb will always have both xml files\n. - A request for S01E01 will be satisfied through \"episode-1-1.xml\"\n- A request for E01 (without season) will be satisfied through \"episode-abs-1.xml\"\nThus, no need for a fallback in one or the other direction.\nFor season > 1 fallback to absolute numbering is logically incorrect (and impossible for the other direction)\n. Cool. Good decision to remove it.\n. \n. No, this doesn't make any sense for a query either.\nWhen a user enters a date range to limit search results, no adjustment should occur. \nThe entered date should be matched/compared to the permiere/air date of the library item as it is officially recorded (and supplied by the providers).\n. This is not limited to episodes, it is also applicable for movies and other items.\nIt's just a matter of logical consequence: \n- It is impossible to work with UTC dates. Not for series/episodes, not for movies, because we don't know the time zones for the provided dates\n- Thus, we can't convert them to UTC\n- The only option is to leave/treat air date and premiere dates as local (local to to the location of premiere)\n- Finally, this would lead to the behaviour that the user is expecting anyway and nothing else.\nImagine a German user, searching for a certain US item by release date: He reads the release date on a US website and enters this date in the search (he would never convert that date to the European date and time before entering).\nAfter all, I don't think that this change would break anything, it would just fix all issues.\nPlease note that the changes are limited to \"PremiereDate\" and \"AirDate\"! For other dates (e.g. like DateAdded) the timezone conversion is absolutely correct!\n. But how?\nUTC conversion is not possible.\nIt affects library and auto-organize (series, seasons, episodes, movies at least).\nhttp://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/26050-premiered-date-is-showing-up-wrong/page-4?hl=organize\nhttp://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/33295-auto-organizedaily-shows/\n. Why do you think this would require changes everywhere? IMO, the changes are (more or less) complete in this commit.\nPlease take some time to carefully think through what is happening here right now:\n\u2022Local Timezone is UTC+2\n\u2022Look at TvdbEpisodeProvider, Line 410\n\u2022DateTime.TryParse creates a date from the string in the xml, assuming this is a DateTime matching the local computers regional settings\n\u2022Thus, the next statement \".ToUniversalTime()\" converts the datetime (assumed as local datetime) from the local datetime to a UTC datetime\n\u2022If the parsed date is \"2016-03-30 00:00\" the converted date would be \"2016-03-29 22:00\"\nThis is just plain wrong. It's not one out of two or more feasible alternatives to choose from (and to prefer due to compatiibility). The result is total nonsense and not even close to UTC.\n. OK, I'm getting your point..\nHow about a new BaseItem property like PremiereDateIsUtc? Series, Episodes, Movies would return false, all others true.\nDepending on this property, client input could be processed accordingly (e.g. like you said, reverse timezone conversion).\nThe \"plain wrong\" statement was targeting the use of _ToUniversalTime _ in the context of the TvdbEpisodeProvider. I'm sorry that I didn't make that clear..\n. I agree.\nThough, if we exclude the changes to ItemsService.cs, I think my other changes are still valid, even while we don't yet have some date discrimination indicator, because:\nPerforming no timezone conversion at all will produce better results than performing that bogus/incorrect conversion like it's done currently.\n. Today I re-assessed this issue, but I came to the same conclusion as previously:\n- Assuming an externally provided DateTime as local and then converting it to UTC is always wrong (unless your local time zone matches the time zone of the external DateTime)\n- I already gave an example to illustrate this\n- You should also consider this: The premiere or air dates coming from the metadata providers usually don't have a time component anyway! \n- And these properties are displayed without time component in the UI!\n- So the only actual effect of calling \".ToUniversalTime()\" is that Emby will display incorrect dates (and incorrectly auto-organizes)\nI removed the changes to ItemsService and modified BaseItemXmlParser to use DateTimeStyles.None instead of DateTimeStyles.AssumeLocal.\nBut I think all other changes are mandatory.\n. No, this is not the case with Omdb. \nBut caching will stll speed up subsequent requests for the same item.\n. You need to consider this:\n- A user would typically have a scheduled library scan every 12 or 24 hours or at some point at night\n- This is where the provider cache gets filed/update\nBut additional library scans either triggered by filesystem events or manually by the user will be a lot faster using cached data.\nIt also seem to me that Omdb is delaying its responses to throttle requests, which makes subsequent querying take even longer.\n. Just rebased.\nUnfortunately, GIT has screwed up the DIFF to OmdbProvider a bit. It's not as complicated as it looks..\n. The further improvement is a reduced library scan time.\nSometimes I had about 15min. After the fix I had 50s once. \nNow I tried again and had 1min 25s. Then I reverted the change and tried again: 7min 2s.\nThis is still 4,5 times faster! (I suppose, it's 15min when tvdb data is old and gets cached again).\nThe problem here is the TheTvDb provider. Even when using cached data, it is still quite expensive to parse thousands of xml files. If you want to try for yourself, add \"The daily show\" (3200 episodes) to your library or another series with even more episodes.\nPS: I'm running on an 8 core AMD processor, I suppose the effect would be even more drastic on those NAS devices or other low-CPU systems that Emby can run on..\n. Another benefit is that the log does no longer grow by 10MB\n. > Ok. Only thing is the missing episodes don't currently have a premiere date until they've been refreshed. What you should do is update MissingEpisodeProvider to set that value on new Episodes that it creates.\nAccording to my change, an episode that does not have a premiere date gets still refreshed (once) until it has one..\n. Rebased...\n. Rebased and added IExternalId for TvMaze\n. Finally, we have an alternate SeasonProvider!\nTvMaze serves season data and the new provider is now able to process it.\nI also added a SeasonImageProvider for TV Maze.\n. > it kept getting confused over \"the blacklist\" other than that it's spot on\nNo problem on my side. Here's the result from my MetadataViewer plugin:\n\n. > I added the homepage link to the maze episode webpage\nI had missed that in the first version, but I added the TV Maze external id classes for Series, Seasons and Episodes, so all links should work\n. >  after doing that I was able to link the episode trailers to each episode\nYou can't get trailers through the API at this time. I posted a request on their site to include them:\nhttp://www.tvmaze.com/threads/1446/trailers\n. We can't do it by scraping the html page - especially not for virtual episodes.\nCurrently, we are loading all episode data for a show with a single api request.\nNow, imagine a series with 5000 episodes: We would need to perform 5000 http requests...\n. I tried again, deleted all provider ids and re-identified \"The Blacklist\" again, but I couldn't see any problem...\n. Last rebase of TV Maze stuff\n. I think TV Maze is a valuable source with sometimes even better data than omdbapi.\nAlso, TVMaze provides per-season data, being the only alternative to the MovieDbSeasonProvider!\nBut no matter if TvMaze is shipped with the server or as a plugin: Emby must allow more detailed control over metadata retrieval. Once this is done, TV Maze should be included anyway IMO.\nMy suggestion would be: Include TVMaze now in the main server but deactivate it for all new and upgrade installations - except: The TvMazeSeasonProvider should be enabled by default.\n~~But if you want to wrap it into a plugin, go ahead, I'm fine with it. I just don't want to maintain it myself...~~\n. Finally created a plugin. The code in the plugin is unchanged, so it could be merged into main anytime,  so I'm closing this.\n. Rebased annd removed unrelated stuff\n. Minimalized the approach\n. Added two more fixes...\n. OK, if we will have a solution to select metadata providers per library and a setting to prevent content from being mixed with other libraries' content, this would probably even be a better solution. I'm seeing this now!\n. This change may appear a little extreme at first sight.\nThough, all of that \"ShortOverview\" stuff obviously existed for a single reason only: Overview descriptions from OMDB have been very brief in the past.\nBut this is no longer true. By querying OMDB with parameter \"&plot=full\" we are now able to retrieve just normal overview descriptions.\nAs a consequence, all implementation for \"ShortOverview\" information is no longer required and could be removed.\n. AFAIK there is no place in Emby where the short overview is displayed when the normal overview is available, so why should we keep this info if we aren't using it anywhere?\nTo me this seems to be a dead end in Emby, once implemented to receive the poor OMDB descriptions.\nRegarding kodi: Kodi may have it, but why should we pull that data if aren't using it anyway?\nRegarding NFO: In the future, OMDB will always retrieve full descriptions, so why save some \"ShortOverview\" data to NFO files that usually is empty (unless manually filled)..?\n. Please think about this just one more time:\n- Is there a real-world scenario where a typical Emby user would even notice this change? The ShortOverview property isn't really used anywhere except for writing to NFO or XML\n- Are there any Emby users that are using Emby as an application for pulling Kodi data and writing that data to NFO/XML files? Or why should we care about those 5 ;-) users?\n- Why write to XML/NFO if the info isn't used anyway after reading back from XML/NFO files?\n. OMDB now has full plot information for all items.\nThus it is no longer required to store this short information to a special \"ShortOverview\" property (with the purpose to avoid merging the short plot in favor of a longer plot),\nNow plot information from all providers can be treated equal!\nThat's why I thought it is a good time to drop that ShortOverview thing completely as the original reason for it has gone away.\nBut if you really want to keep it, I will reduce this PR to the actual OMDB changes and will leave the ShortOverview stuff as it is. It's your decision how would you like it?\n. I just created the new PR #1907 that contains the \"other improvements\" of this PR only.\n. But I think, we're still not done with this.\nYou we're asking, \"what's the pressing reason to remove the \"ShortOverview\" infrastructure?\"\nI would sum up that reason like this:\n- The original cause that lead to the introduction of the \"ShortOverview\" stuff no longer exists (OMDB now does have overview information of normal length)\n- The \"ShortOverview\" data field is a dead end in Emby because its content isn't used or processed anywhere (Only exception: It's written to xml or nfo files. But when it's read back from such files - it still isn't used, processed or displayed in any way)\n- And here's the pressing aspect: With the current implementation we are throwing away ALL overview data that's coming from OMDB for no reason...\n. Can be closed after reading because content was further split up into #1907 and #1908\n. This is an alternative to PR #1762 without dropping the ShortOverview stuff\n. Closed because further split up into #1907 and #1908\n. Previously it looked like this:\n\n. Rebased!\n. All other variants I tried didn't work out, not even the maxlines property (works when changing input in the client but does not work for initial display.\nThe commited css targets the iron-autogrow-textarea, which supports a max-size according to the documentation while the paper-textarea does not support a max-size (and obviously doesn't even support explizit sizing).\nAs a result, the input will grow until 90px height and display a scrollbar for larger content.\n. For Rated and Plot I had actual cases where i got \"N/A\" values.\nThe result was that the Overview was \"N/A\" and the Rating was \"N/A\", while another provider would have had real information.\n. For other fields we use .TryParse(), which of course fails for \"N/A\" entries, but I think a generic replacement of these values is a cleaner solution.\n. Rebased and reworked without using TypeDescriptor\n. Hold on, something's gotten wrong here with GitHub...\n. The problem was caused by an older version of this branch on GitHub.\nEverything is fine now!\n. This solution is not using an additional img tag. It is using an img tag instead of the div tag that was previously used. So, there is no extra element being used.\nIf we don't want to interfere with images that have transparency (eg a transparent border as those created by the cover art plugin), the placeholder background needs to be removed (or switched) just in the moment when the actual image is loaded and about to be displayed.\nSince we agreed that we don't want an event based solution, there aren't much options left to perform that kind of image switching.\nThe key to the solution here is the img tag. The special behaviour of the img tag (and this behaviour is consistent across browsers on all platforms I tested) is this: If the img tag is displaying an image via its src property and the src property is changed from javascript, it keeps displaying the previous image until the new image is loaded and ready for display.\nFor css-backgrounds this does not work. When the css background is set to an image that is not yet loaded, the background is immediately cleared until the new image is loaded.\nI also think that using img tags in an html view to display like 100 images is a more natural way than doing it with 100 div tags using css-baclgrounds. I don't have any evidence for this statement, but I would imagine that at least some browsers may handle 100 img tags with greater efficience than 100 css backgrounds.\n. Just a few days ago I wanted to show a few pictures to a friend (android app, mobile network): It was just impossible to do that!\nThat's caused by two things: 1. missing placeholders; 2. scrolling does not stop at the end of the list but far beyond in the dark instead. I wish I could stand next to you demonstrating that behaviour in real-life...\n. >  we need to be able to choose between filling a container with stretching and filling a container without stretching.\nPhotos must never be stretched, so this could at least be applied to photos....\n. This is a list of proposed enhancements for the handling of channel items.\nPlease tell me what you think!\n. This is obsolete. I'm starting a new PR\n. This time: Minimal changes only, separated into 3 different commits\n. Required changes have been done\n. Most items on SoudCloud have formatted description text:\n\n. Displaying without line breaks would make these descriptions unreadable...\n. \n. Is there any BaseItem property that would indicate that it has received data from providers?\n. - Alternative 1: Only force update of item name when it is a channel folder. (I'm showing child counts in the folder names, these should really reflect \"live\" data)\n- Alternative 2: Allow specfying locked fields. If a field is locked (for provider updates), allow updating through the channel\n- Alternative 3: Make the SoundCloud plugin a MetadataProvider to update its own content\n- Alternative 4: I could \"salt\" ChannelItemInfo.Id each time it is queried with random content, to make it appear to be a new item and use the new name. (Probably not a good solution, though)\n. I replicated the situation. I could reproduce an empty dialog but no timeouts:\nWhen the path no longer exists, then GetParentPath will fail but DirectoryContents will fail as well.\nThat leads to an empty dialog (because it hits the error delegate of Promise.All at line 87 in directorybrowser.js).\nI couldn't replicate a situation where the spinner remains visible (because on error it is hidden in line 88).\nI just commited a simple fix for this situation: In case the init path does not exist, the dialog now just behaves like before: Displaying a list of the root drives.\nI tested several scenarios where either the file or directory name or the parent path no longer existed: In all those cases the dialog falls back to the previous behaviour now.\n. Rebased.\n. Reworked this by removing questionable changes and changing exception handlers to plan 'catch' statements.\n. > What are the formats we get back from the metadata providers? Couldn't we just datetimeoffset.parse them (and then UTC converting them) instead of assuming US EST?\nMost of the providers don't specify a time base.\nBut DateTime.Parse assumes a datetime to be local. Converting that to UTC will always result in a value that is totally wrong.\n. > However until that time I think it's best to not merge anything like this.\nI don't understand this. What we are currently doing is complete nonsense.\nAs mentioned earlier another alternative (which is very easy to implement) would be to eliminate all those UTC conversions for those metadata fields that are just meant to specify a date without time component. I mean, there's absolutely no point in converting a date (without time) to another timezone.\nFor instance, if my birthday was on 5.6.2016, it's not \"5.6.2016 20:00h\" in Middle East Asia or \"4.6.2016 00:40h\" in the US. It's always just 5.6.2016, no matter what time zone you're in!\n. > After all this has been done, one finally could admire the beautiful sunrise picture taken at 23:00:00 UTC...\nI thought I had already fired all related arguments regarding this issue, but this is something I hadn't thought about. Thanks for pointing this out.\nI still got some hope that this will be finally addressed...\n. StringUsageReporter Class\nThis class contains tests for reporting the usage of localization string tokens in the dashboard-ui or similar.\nRemarks\nRun one of the two tests using Visual Studio's \"Test Explorer\":\n-   ReportStringUsage()\n-   ReportUnusedStrings()\nOn successful run, the bottom section of the test explorer will contain a link \"Output\". This link will open the test results, displaying the trace and two attachment links. One link will open the output folder, the other link will open the output xml file.\nThe output xml file contains a stylesheet link to render the results as html. How that works depends on the default application configured for XML files:\n-   Visual Studio\n  Will open in XML source view. To view the html result, click menu 'XML' => 'Start XSLT without debugging'\n-   Internet Explorer\n  XSL transform will be applied automatically.\n-   Firefox\n  XSL transform will be applied automatically.\n-   Chrome\n  Does not work. Chrome is unable/unwilling to apply xslt transforms from local files.\n. Adjusted to removal of paper-fab\n. Fixed sync conflicts.\n. Actuallly this is nothing more than a slight coding style improvement...\n(but will make streaming implementations much more transparent)\n. Background:\n- Enumerating files in a folder is a very expensive operation\n- Opposed to this, accessing a specific file (or its properties) is an extremely cheap operation\n- Purpose of the DirectoryService was obviously to avoid repeated file enumerations in a specific folder by caching the results\nThe implementation of the DirectoryService got one step too far, though:\nTo get information about a single file, it enumerated all content of the file's parent folder (which is expensive) instead of just returning the properties of that single file (which is cheap).\nThis fix changes the behaviour and will always directly determine the file information from the file system.\n. Hehe, OK!\n\nFrom: Luke notifications@github.com\nSent: Saturday, August 6, 2016 9:13:07 PM\nTo: MediaBrowser/Emby\nCc: softworkz; Author\nSubject: Re: [MediaBrowser/Emby] Fix for bad DirectoryService.GetFile performance (#2029)\nThanks.

I doubt that. IOException and UnauthorizedAccessException don't inherit from each other.\nPerhaps you mean that UnauthorizedAccessException would be caught by the generic catch anyway.\nBut the only goal was to avoid writing the log full of detailed Exceptions (Logger.ErrorException()) in case Emby does not have write permissions on a library...\n. Recently a user posted such a file, I'll try to find it..\n. Found it: http://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/37453-high-cpu-and-ram-usage/\nIt's the link in the first post\n. I just tried this:\nI added a file to the library and locked it with: http://www.jensscheffler.de/filelocker\nI debugged this and got an IOException. The following line was logged:\n2016-08-13 08:32:27.2452 Debug LibraryMonitor: E:\\Movies\\TestMovie\\TestMovie1.avi is locked.\nSo, a locked file does not cause an UnauthorizedAccessException - qed.\nBut anyway: This commit is not about changing behaviour, it's just about reducing log lines. \n. This is the result of intense investigations about Chrome's behaviour regarding buffering of media content. Whatever scenario I tried, with different content files, different player frontends, different server behaviour (supporting range requests or not), or various HTTP response header combinations:\nOn any seek operation (no matter if large or minimal), Chrome always initiated a new http request and never used any local cached data.\nLong story short: As opposed to most other browsers, chrome does not implement specific buffering for media content. Instead it just employs the default http caching mechanism. Thus, the solution was to add appropriate caching headers to the range responses.\nNote: This commit only addresses serving of static files to the clients: Either files that match the client's device profile or pre-transcoded files (e.g. created from the FolderSync plugin).\n. Finally, Chrome is using cached data on seeking when available:\n\n. This solution used the cache key as ETag and the cache key is built from file path + last modified date, so it is a strong key!\nI will test your other commit, but my commit is more universal as it doesn't need any client scripting.\nI have investigated quite a few other servers streaming html video and they were all sending the http response headers in the way I did in this commit!\n. No, these headers (Cache-Control, Last-Modified, Expires and ETag) were not written before I added them in RangeRequest writer.\n. Correction: They were ALL missing when I was working on streaming live transcoded files.\nWhat was missing for static files served via RangeRequestWriter was the \"ETag\" and Chrome only started caching after supplying the ETag.\n. > But before this could be done, we first had to devise a way to change the url in the file changes because that would be the only way to force the client to download it again.\nI noticed that chrome always performs a remote request when playing video, even if it has cached it, so I thought this would be enough to detect a changed ETag in the response..\n. Actually it's my new \"ProgressiveRangeWriter\" ;-)\n. Yeah, I understand! \n. I tried with your changes only and it does not work. \nChrome is always requesting from the server:\n\n.

It's hard to find a regular library video that is served statically.\nEven if I disallow transcoding, they are all running through ffmpeg (either ffmpeg-directstream or ffmpeg-remux). How can I find a file that gets streamed statically or configure Emby to do so?\n. OK, after adding the ETag to the synced MediaSourceInfo I can confirm that caching works now!\nIn SyncedMediaSourceProvider I changed the following method:\nprivate void SetStaticMediaSourceInfo(LocalItem item, MediaSourceInfo mediaSource)\n        {\n            mediaSource.Id = item.Id;\n            mediaSource.SupportsTranscoding = false;\n            if (mediaSource.Protocol == Model.MediaInfo.MediaProtocol.File)\n            {\n                mediaSource.ETag = item.Id;\n            }\n        }\n. Another correction: \nHttpResultFactory.AddCachingHeaders\nThe header must be named \"Last-Modified\" instead of \"LastModified\"\n. I'm having these changes in my private branch since a long time and users will benefit from having precise information about the actual reason for failure.\nThis is also mandatory when we want to propagate auto-organize errors via the notification system (a planned feature if I remember correctly)\n. Sure, but when we start experimenting with range requests, this could raise wrong expectations, so I thought: better not show that.  (but we don't delete it - maybe some day things change...)\n. >  (but we don't delete it - maybe some day things change...)\nSorry, I meant to say the same: we should not delete it!\n. Something is wrong here...\n. Replaces #1507 \n. ## Testing the new feature\nHere are some procedures for testing the new capabilities:\nHint: For more fun, open two or more browsers displaying the auto-organize log simultaneously\nTest Realtime progress display\n\nPut one or more files into the auto-organize folder (from which you know that they are identified correctly)\nStart the Organize-Task\nWatch how all new files are added to the top of the list in real-time, displayed as \"In-Progress\" while they are copied\n\nTest instant dialog completion\n\nPut one or more files into the auto-organize folder (from which you know that they are NOT identified automatically)\nRun the Organize-Task and then open the Organize-Dialog for the file that couldn't be processed automatically\nAdjust the settings and click OK\nThe dialog will close and you can see that the file is being processed\nYou don't need to wait for the copying to complete anymore. Instead you can immediately proceed with another file\n\nTest dialog error handling\n\nPut one or more files into the auto-organize folder (from which you know that they are NOT identified automatically)\nRun the Organize-Task and then open the Organize-Dialog for the file that couldn't be processed automatically\nAdjust the settings to a non-existing value (like season 123 and episode 987) and click OK\nThe dialog will not close but display an immediate error message instead\nThus, you can fix the problem and try to click OK again\n\nConcurrency\n\nPut one or more files into the auto-organize folder (from which you know that they are NOT identified automatically)\nRun the Organize-Task and then open the Organize-Dialog for the file that couldn't be processed automatically\nAdjust the settings and click OK\nAt the same time (while the first request is being processed), try process the same file from another browser instance (or the same).\nThe second operation will be blocked (also, manual and ScheduledTask processing can't simultaneously process the same file anymore)\n. Just updated with the desired modifications!\n. Rebased...\n. Rebased and changed tab-selection to html SELECT element.\n. Rebased.\n. Rebased - everything fixed and working again!. Rebased and removed duplicate definition. Rebased.. Updated..\n. Even if we move this to a plugin for now, it would be better to have a fixed enum for this in the server core..\n. In this case, \"item\" is of type \"LocalItem\", so item.Id is populated by \"MediaSync.GetLocalId\" and this depends on the sync job id.\nThus, I assumed that the Id is unique...\n. Updated BaseNfoSaver.cs\n. Rebased.\n. Alternative to PR #1908 removing all ShortOverview stuff...\n. ## Benefits\n\nThe primary benefit is (nearly) instant seeking within a short range of the current playback position.\nPrimary use cases are things like skipping commercials or repeating scenes.\nDepending on the client't browser cache settings, it's also possible to repeat a long sequence without additional network traffic.\nLimitations\nThis feature doesn't help when skipping forward large timespans. In these cases it's difficult for html5 clients to determine the correct byte range to request on one side, and on the other side, the transcoding process might not yet have reached the skip destination.\nIn such cases, we are setting up a new transcoding session just like usual.\n. PS: To demonstrate the actual benefit and effect of this feature, I added two new \"Skip\" buttons to the video player. The left button skips back 5s and the right button skips forward 20s.\n. A few more remarks;\nIn order not to break any clients with this feature, the only viable solution seemed to me that a client must explicitly indicate that it can handle the feature. In our case that's these two aspects:\n- The media file has a duration (although it's still being encoded/remuxed)\n- The media is served via http range requests/responses\nSo I implemented the following procedure:\n- When the client player calls \"getPlaybackInfo\" it can add a new parameter \"CanQuickSeek\"\n- The server checks if all conditions for QuickSeek are met. If yes, it returns a streaming url containing the parameter \"tryquickseek=true\"\n- When the client requests a stream and the stream url contains \"tryquickseek=true\", the server re-evaluates all conditions and will then finally set \"StreamState.UsingQuickSeek\"\n- If the latter is true, the file will be served with a preliminary duration in the header and with support for range requests\n. A while ago I asked why we are using the mkv container for streaming anyway.\nThe argument (which I found reasonable) was: that sticking to MKV would allow the server to remux only instead of transcoding.\nI don't know much about HLS and if it can be used with remuxing.\nBut if you say that in the future we will no longer have any remuxing or transcoding to MKV, then we can drop that code indeed.... I'm fine with it. MKV has never been a good option for streaming anyway. \nI just wish we had come to that conclusion a little earlier.. :-). (I really pushed those ffmpeg guys a little to make them like my changes). Modified PR: Removed SyncJobUpdated server event. Wrong target branch... Thanks a lot for your effort to help us out in that matter.\nAlthough I didn't try, I believe that  it could have worked as a temporary fix.\nBut we need to think a bit further and from larger perspective, it's not a durable and reliable solution (1). Also it doesn't directly address the actual source of the problem (2).\nLet's look at aspect (1) first:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/12206314/detect-if-visual-c-redistributable-for-visual-studio-2012-is-installed\nThe previous code was following the reference above. But this does not describe the optimal way. \nDepending on Windows Installer and dependencies is not too reliable since the installer keys may change with newer versions.\nI don't even know if those keys would be the same when someone includes them into his setup via the merge modules.\nTo understand this better, there's one thing you need to know:\nFor the first time, VC libs remain compatible between two versions of Visual Studio\nNo need to install the VS2015 runtime. The 2017 version will cover both.\n(this does not apply to any other two VS versions)\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/porting/binary-compat-2015-2017\nWith this situation, we don't even know how long this compatibility will be kept. A Visual Studio 2019 could include a new  runtime that is still compatible, but it will be delivered with an installer having all different IDs internally. That's why it's not the best idea to do the detection via installer IDs.\nNow I am using the same detection mechanism as the vcredist installer packages themselves:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/ide/deploying-visual-cpp-application-by-using-the-vcpp-redistributable-package\nThis helps to avoid discrepanices in detection of installation status. (and it is also the MS recommended way).\nAbout the actual problem that this PR didn't address (2):\nThere's a bug in some of the VS 2017 redist installers in that they are not updating their version information to both registry locations (i.e. x64 and x86), just in one of them (one with WOW6432) and one wihout)\nThat's why I'm reading both values now and take the higher build number to compare.\nAlso I changed everything to use the VC 2017 redist.(since it's is just a slightly newer version of the 2015 dlls).. Thanks again for your help and identifying the problem.\nI'm closing.\n::edit:: I cannot close. @LukePulverenti must do it... ## Where to get those dlls?\nA number of users have copied the dlls from a Windows 10 installation.\nBut there's a better way to get the \"right\" dlls for the server version:\n\nLocate the installlation source from where you installed Windows Server\nIf it's an ISO, mount it anywhere\nLook for \"install.wim\" - usually in the \"sources\" folder\nIn fact this is just a zip file. Open it with a compression app of your choice\nThe wim file contains several numbers (e.g. 1,2,3,4) representing different editions of the Os\nCheck the \"windows\\system32\" folder under each number until you find the files you're looking for and copy them to your Windows Core installation\n. There is a msvfw32.lib but it is just a stub for dynamic linking to msvfw32.dll and suspect that it is similar for avicaps32. I guess, the reason is that these libraries are platform specific.\n\nSo no, we won't be able to compile this into ffmpeg, but in theory it might be possible to compile an ffmpeg version without these dependencies since we don't care about audio/video capabilities of the system we're running on. \nBut I would need to investigate if this is high or low effort.. One more note about the Skia installation:\nI don't know why we stopped distributing the ImageMagick dlls. \nImageMagick wouldn't require all those dlls like Skia, but: We would need to install the VC++ 2013 Runtime additionally (full package including MP stuff).\nAgain: All those runtimes could be merged into a single MSI package that could be installed silently.. One more note: An MSI based setup for installing the runtimes would also solve the problem of #3027 . Yes. All those and even a few more more issues could be addressed all at once with a single strike (MSI setup). Namely:\nFor Win Server Core\n\nInstalling the required VC runtimes (2015/2017) as part of the setup\nEnforcing specific bitness version on systems like core server\nFor missing dlls on Win Server Core\nEither provide a wizard that automates the process during setup by prompting to insert or mount the installation source or DVD during setup\nOr much simpler: Only detect whether these dlls are present. If not, open a document giving instructions how to install those dlls\n\n\n\nGeneral Windows Setup\n\nWindows Installer based setup (MSI)\nInstallation of Emby Server as a native Windows service (without NSSM)\nInstalling into the \"Program Files \" folder like normal applications (by default)\nUsing a folder below \"Program Data\" for data like normal applications (by default)\nChoosing a custom installation path\nChoosing a custom data path\n\nDid I forget anything?. This doesn't seem to be a question related to using Emby.\nIt's rather a question about how to use ffmpeg and the right place for such questions is https://ffmpeg.org/. Coulldn't find any unit test in that project... There may be opportunities for parallelization, but specifically downloading metadata is something that we must not do in parallel. Not even 2 simultaneous workers.\nThis is due to the fact that web servers are often limiting simultaneous requests, often just to just 2.\nOther metadata services have mechanisms to detect excessive downloading which may result in being blocked. For some metadata services, emby has it's own API key, so the worst case could be that a metadata provider would block emby as a whole for all users.\nA while ago we already had conversations with metadata providers about the load that emby is causing and we've worked together with another one to change its API in a way that emby can download series data with a single query instead of making single requests for each episode. So that's a real concern.\nThat's why the described method is not really suitable here.\nParallelization is still a good idea, but it would need to be done in a different way.\nWe must not parallelise by item but by operation instead. Like one worker scanning the file system, one worker identifying unknown items, one worker downloading metadata from PoividerA, one worker for ProviderB, another worker for downloading images etc.. There's just a handful of \"good\" metadata sites, adding more does not help here in general.\nBut metadata providers can be added as plugins now. So, for some special interest areas or coverage of a certain country or language, it might make sense to create a plugin to add a specific provider.\nAlso it wouldn't help to allow specifying a custom API key because most of those sites will limit requests to 1 or 2 parallel ones by origin - not by API key. If you were thinking that these 2 simultaneous requests would be shared among all emby servers, then you got me wrong. This is not the case.. > Why is it the case, I don't see any feature that would need that ?\nFeatures:\n- Remote Control: The server needs to know which devices are online\n- Synchronization: Clients apps need to check regularly if there's some content to synchronize\n\nCan we at least have an option to disable that ?\n\nWe are supporting Wake-On-LAN for local networks where the server may go to sleep (not just a single HD). Some routers are also available that support this and wake up your machine when a request is received on a certain port.\nBut Emby is a server application and when it is running it requires unconditional access to the file system. This includes the location of its binaries and all locations containing program data or temporary data. It's an incorrect assumption that it would just be some log entries written that are causing the HDD spin-up. Instead, this would be a neverending story: After preventing log entries being written, we would find out, that Emby is reading from the user database that may cause a file operation, then a client wants to check for new sync items to download, the server needs to update the list of active devices and this needs to be written to disk. Even for unsolicited scanning requests, it is inevitable to perform certain file operations.\nTo really achieve what you want - \"running Emby from memory\" - we would need to implement some massive changes that would also introduce a number of other drawbacks.\nSo bear with me - but your case is pretty exotic and does not justify the effort imo.\nI would recommend: Put Emby or its data on an ssd or some usb memory. \nYou should also consider: HD spinup and spindown may save energy, but it decreases lifetime and reliability on the other side.\n. Implementing push notifications is planned and will arrive soon. \nRegarding sync in general, introducing a configurable check interval would just add another factor of uncertainty to the story, while we're actually aiming to make it even more reliable.\nAn option that I could imagine instead would be one to fully disable sync for those who don't want or need it. But I'm just chatting here, that would need to be discussed internally.\n. > Can we look at what requests these are? Because if there is server activity coming in, then doesn't that imply the machine should be awake anyway? Thanks.\nIt seems he's referring to HD spin-up, not machine wakeup from sleep mode.\n\nThis is to avoid logging every HTTP request, which wake up the HDD, even when someone unauthorized try to poke my server.\n\nMost likely it won't just be the log messages causing HD spin-up. There are lots of other operations that may cause HD spin-up.\nGenerally I wouldn't recommend configuring HD spin-down anyway for HDs running server applications. This may cause other (sometimes hard-to-diagnose)  problems as well.\nFor media content HDs, it may be OK to spin-down, when you don't care about the delay this can cause for playback start.\n. What's special about log writing is that it's an operation where any caching is undesired. It is important to have have it written to disk as soon as possible; otherwise it won't be possible to diagnose the preceding operations in case of a crash.\n@MatMaul - If it's http scanning requests that are probing for Emby, a trivial straightforward solution might be to use a non-standard port instead of the default ones.. Im posting here for reference what I've replied in the other issue:\n\nEmby is a server application and when it is running it requires unconditional access to the file system.

Will be fixed after migrating to DownloadManager. should be included in one of the next versions. This is actually resolved now.. Can be closed.. You are using an incorrect version of ffmpeg. Did you install or configure a custom version?. ffmpeg 4.1 is not supported.\n\nWhy don't you simply use the ffmpeg version that is included with the Emby installation package?. On which platform are you?. I'm still curious: On which platform are you? Windows, Linux or else?. I kept the NewSeriesName and NewSeriesYear separate in the API for the following reasons:\n- A future implementation (or different client using the API) might want to allow explicit specification of the series folder name. Use cases may be trivial like to have \"The Good Wife\" instead of \"Good Wife\" but also language related. A series might have been identified as \"Crime Scene Cleaner\", but the user wants to use the original name \"Der Tatortreiniger\"\n- IMO an API should provide a reasonable amount of flexibility and not be arbitrarily limited exactly to the use case proposed at the time of creation\nIf my arguments still didn't convince, I'd like to remark that reducing the signature to nothing but the provider ids would require an additional metadata query at the server, because the current process is like this:\n- series = new Series();\n- series.Name = request.NewSeriesName;\n- series.Path = Path.Combine(request.TargetFolder, seriesFolderName);\n- series.ProviderIds = request.NewSeriesProviderIdsDictionary;\n- series.RefreshMetadata(refreshOptions, cancellationToken);\nSo, the name is required before metatada is refreshed.\nOn the contrary, if we would really pass the provider ids only, there is no 100% guarantee that the query by provider ids will result the exact same item that the user had searched by name in the UI!\n. I guess I misunderstood you. \nYou're just referring to having both NewSeriesProviderIds and NewSeriesProviderIdsDictionary, right?\n. OK, but could we make an exception for \"MusicAlbum\" and \"MusicArtist\"?\n. Because those values are immutable and auto-properties are unable to express this.\n. No. This restricts access to the setter only, but doesn't make the values immutable.\n. Immutability is not a functional requirement. Declaring those fields as readonly may affect the compilation but probably with little to none benefit regarding performance.\nThe primary reason for declaring those fields as readonly is to improve clarity of code and make it easy to understand.  We could find a number of fancy alternatives, but none of them would meet this requirement any better...\n. Well, this just returns all provider ids (= classes implementing IExternalId) that apply to the specific item type (= IExternalId.Supports(item) returns true)\nThis is the exact same list of ids that are shown in the metadata editor form.\nLet's compare the effect of this change to the previous implementation:\n1. We are only importing metadata ids that Emby can understand and process for a certain item. (The previous implementation would have imported a \"MusicBrainzAlbumId\" even for a TV series episode, but there's no reason to import that for a case where the id doesn't apply anyway). I also checked that there is an IExternalId defined for each of the previously hardcoded id strings. (except for TvRage, but that's history)\n2. We are now importing ALL provider ids that apply to the specific item, not only the hardcoded ones. (this even includes provider ids specified in plugins)\n. Correct :-)\n. ",

No, that doesn't seem to be an option? I have a season with every episode watched, and the checkmark on the detail page isn't a different color. I tried clicking it and it didn't toggle anything.\n. Oh, my mistake. I thought the log was /var/logs/emby-server.log but it doesn't seem like that's the main thing. It looks like they are in /var/lib/emby-server/logs.\nThis is the latest log from there with debugging enabled: http://pastebin.com/ucCxY3TK\n. It's not, every episode has a green checkmark badge and the season's checkmark at the top next to the thumbs and heart is white.\n. None of the shows have season folders, is that the problem? I used to use MySQL with Kodi and never used season folders. I just recently moved over to Emby (month or so?) and had it just scan the directory that all of the show folders are in.\n. Awesome! Thanks, I appreciate it!\n. This isn't fixed in 3.0.5768.7.\nAm I misunderstanding what marking a season as watched means? My assumption is that it would mark every episode in that season with the watched flag. Some reading elsewhere leads me to believe that's not the case?\n. Marking the whole show as watched does mark every episode as watched, none of the season buttons do it.\n. ",

Most subtitle download tools allow us to specify a parameter to determine the file encoding.\nEx: subliminal  ->     -e UTF-8\nThis means the OpenSubtitles API can receive a request to send the UTF-8 version of the file. This could be implemented in Emby subtitle download.\n. Is that difficult to implement? Even because it's already used in playback....\n. I tought that all traffic used in HTTPS port was encrypted. Isn't that correct?\n. Hello?\n. Is not all traffic encrypted today with HTTPS in port 8920 ???\n. That would be awesome.\n. True, very useful.\n. This is a problem when viewing an existing job. Even if the job is \"Medium\" or \"Original\", it shows as high, only when being looked at.\nThe worst comes when transcoding is off, and it doesn't let you choose the sync quality, using \"High\" instead of \"Original\"\n. Luke, the database is not returning items that have accented chars. I can reproduce it easily here... can you?\n. I don't if that can be done... that would envolve running removediacritics in DB SQL, and data is written in DB with accents.\nWhat do users gain with this removediacritics? English data doesn't have accents... so is that ONLY so people can type wrong \"f\u00e1st\" and bring it anyway \"fast\" ?\n. If the SQL query in https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/blob/445eba31a495b96c663245348e000b264105475a/MediaBrowser.Server.Implementations/Persistence/SqliteItemRepository.cs#L1998 could be made in a way that the DBMS also ignores the accents... everything would be OK.\nI guess MAYBE I found some alternative.... don't know if that can be implemented in Emby's SQLITE\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/14009261/sqlite-accent-insensitive-search\nhttp://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#collation\nResume: using a NOACCENTS collation.\nAnyway... the 2 solutions are possible:\n1. stop removing diacritics in search field\nOR\n2. modify the query so SQLITE use COLLATE NOACCENTS\nps: It is known that the LIKE used in SQL queries at first don't like COLLATIONS. So that can be difficult to implement. I still vote for solution 1, even because solution 2 demands a more strutural db change (bad)\n.

So that can be difficult to implement. I still vote for solution 1\n. Well... Personally I'm not a big fan of creating redundant fields in DB for things that could be settled with programming but, it's your call.\nIf you make this transparent to us users, and manage to always keep the accent-less version up-to-date every time the title changes, then OK.\nBut notice that : will you create redundant fields for anything that is searchable and can have accents? Movies...Episodes...Persons... ?\n. Thanks Luke, I'll test again next stable.\n. Will try to contact the providers...  :- |\n. oh... understood. Will track down those files and suggest there, can I do it?\n. @LukePulverenti , I only wished to do changes to 4 files related to image fetching for MovieDB.\nDon't understand why it got more than 30 commits. I Still have to learn more about GitHub.\n. Hi @Luke, can you tell me if this pull will happen next master?\nAs we speaked in a previous topic, I believe now the changes will be made at the correct places: TMDB images provider, not in a global way as you rejected before.\nTnx!\n. Cool! Professional coding... \ud83d\ude03\n. I've already posted that bug in forum. Seems easy, but nobody gave much importance\n. Thanks for fixing!!\n. I already created one feature request in forum about hiding episodes from searches. Still nothing so far...\n. Hey @LukePulverenti , I didn't notice the difference for the old search. What has changed?\nCan't you please make the search also find stuff in \"Original Title\"??? Is this difficult?. Hmmm yeah they are more organized than before. That's cool.\nI may be too demanding but... wouldn't be much better to allow admin to enable/disable which sections are searched? (Movies/Shows/Episodes/People/Artists...etc...)\nBecause: In my case I'll never search anything of a specific episode (don't see the point), but CPU and network are being spent anyway.. I understand. But still, this may need adjust, I believe.\nI consider it a little too small, and the style doesn't guide it's sizing at all, today.\n. Hi Luke. Is this pull going somewhere?\n. ",

    "mford1": "I think maybe the problem is I was using Tortoise Git.  I'll try again later.\n. Ok I tried several times but it just isn't working.  From what I'm seeing your files are not using the windows convention CR+LF but instead just have LF's in them.  When I check them in with CR+LF it's showing everything is different.\nWhat am I doing wrong here?\n. Thanks for the tips, I've never used git before so there's a bit of a learning curve.\nThe HintPath is just that, a hint.  It doesn't have to exist, it's really going to pull it from the GAC if it can't find it there.  This is just what's added by VS when you add a reference, I didn't add it manually or anything.\nI don't assume everyone works on Windows, but I do, and that's what my tooling did for me.  If I need to change my default settings in VS to always output LF only, then so be it, but I would like to know that up front.\nI'm using Git from the built-in MS provider for VS, so I don't see anything called a \"squash\" available.

I wasn't aware of that version, I just noticed that it didn't allow restarting the service and had been like that for quite some time so I thought I'd try to contribute.  I thought there might have been some issue restarting via command line and knew about the PS Restart-Service command.\nUnder what situations does the LocalSystem account not have the ability to start/stop services?  Who/what is modifying the default?  \nOne advantage of using PS would be that you can build up a script internally to execute rather than having to interact via command line or batch files.  You can certainly determine if the LocalSystem account has access to start/stop services before enabling the button if that's what you want, but I'm still curious why/how it was disabled for some people?\n. Ok, so by default it installs under the local system account, but the cases where it was failing was because the user changed it to be a different user then?\nIt's possible to add permissions to the service for a specific (non-admin) user to be able to restart it, I can work on that.\n.

Everything is reencoded.\nI can confirm that the mkv files that I tried is standard h264 files. If I remux them manually with ffmpeg .. -c copy .. Chrome plays them perfectly without the server reencoding.\n. Also, when I play mp4 files in chromium it reencodes to libx264 on the server.\n. @LukePulverenti Can you help me explain if this is caused by bug in the frontend or backend?\nAlso is there some way of forcing to streamcopy?\n. @LukePulverenti I tried the latest version now (3.0.5781.0). And the problem persists.\nTo reproduce this bug, use a linux on client and server. ( I have Ubuntu 14.04 on  both).\nUse Google Chrome (not chromium). Try to play any mkv in the web client. It will always transcode no matter what. I have tried with a lots of different shows and it transcodes on all of them.\nIf I do ffmpeg -i show.mkv -c copy show.mp4, it plays without transcoding.\n.

This issue is also mentioned here: http://emby.media/community/index.php?/topic/17950-webui-transcoding-please-stop/\nThis is a bug that manifests itself in all operating systems. So there is potentially many users affected by this. So I would argue that this is a serious bug. \nIs there anyone that can help figure out what is causing this?\n. @Deihmos This is the bug isn't it?\n. Ah that makes sense. If this is true then it should be really simple to implement. I will use Plex for now ;)\n. @psxlover In my case, any mkv file with h264/aac that is remuxed manually to mp4 with ffmpeg -i ... -c copy ... is playing fine in emby without transcoding. But I have found no mkv that plays directly in emby without triggering transcoding.\n. @psxlover @Deihmos \nI just tested with a mkv file with profile high@4.0 and it was transcoded just as the others I have tried.\n. Thank you so much. Now the web interface is usable as a plex replacement! @LukePulverenti \nIs there any plans for aac stream copy too? My poor i3 still has 1 core at 100% usage with only audio reencoding. Though its not a big deal, it would be fine to have as an option at least, although I understand that hls/dash streaming with different aac profiles is not entirely stable across browsers yet. Even chrome sometimes struggle with HE-AAC.\n. ",

(Not the first admin account as you state, the account selected by the user that allows admin elevation) You then launch the process, while still in the same elevated context, and end up running in the current user windows session, but under the admin account credentials.\nFrom this point it is impossible for this user to relaunch the app, as the app was actually installed in the admin account, not this account. The web server is now also running with admin privileges, from an admin account. Web server, remotely exploitable, running in an admin account...\nTo get back your objective:\n- Allow installs inside non-admin accounts, if elevation is ever required, drop back to this user context.\n- Run the network code with least privileges, certainly not as an admin.\n- Install in \"%programdata%\" for all users or in \"%appdata%\" for this user.\n- Install the VC runtime side-by-side, i.e. copy the DLL's next to your binaries in the install folder, do not run the redist.

Is that still needed?. @LukePulverenti I'm working on this, but should it be committed to the Emby repo, or the web-components repo?. I follow, but it might take a bit to understand and finish up. I'll check it out a bit today and more next week. Thanks for the tips!. Looks like this is part of Emby Server now! closing. Thanks @LukePulverenti!!. Yea, that's the worst part about removing jquery! Sounds great!\n. What are your thoughts about custom web-components for these types of components?\nA long while back when Polymer was in 0.5 dev preview I made a menu that took a javascript object and made a deep menu, not exactly a tree, but close. It would need to be completely re-written for Polymer 1, which I havent looked at in a long time but would be interested in looking at.\nhttp://nickbolles.github.io/nb-menu/\n. Awesome! These are almost exactly the reasons I haven't been actively using Polymer. \nI'll research web components some more and take a look at this later this week/early next week. Thanks for letting me help out! \n. What version of the emby server, and what browser are you using?\nThe intended functionality is that you hover over the image for 3 seconds and then the transparent popover displays. Mine (on server version 3.1.2.0 and chrome 55.0.2883.87, and frankly every other browser I have tried)  functions this way and the pop up menu also looks like this:\n\nSo it has the \"play button\" the \"kabob\", or \"mmore options\" button, the \"marked as played\" button and the \"favorite\" button. \nClicking on the picture before this popover comes up results in going to the details page for the element and clicking the play button directly plays the item right away. \n. This is essentially just a playlist, which emby supports perfectly. \nNow the request might be better to have a home screen section for playlists, which would greatly improve the usability of the playlist feature for me. \nEdit: also building out the playlist feature some more would be awesome, for example to drop off any watched items once you watch them.. I have been noticing this too, no hard evidence but thought I'd just chime in that I've seen issues where switching quality or audio or something or just starting a stream and going to another will stack up ffmpeg in task manager. Then transcoding performance will suffer and stagger. (Especially when my CPU is showing its age and capacity limits). Also, idk if this is possible because VLC and other players did the same thing. But seeking in recorded live TV is painful. I just had my Chromecast lose connection half way through a recorded football game and couldn't get back to the place I was at because it had to buffer it all it seems. .

    "TwoD": "No, that is not the case according to all the documentation, the code, or when actually testing it. \nEmby works fine with or without season folders. It just makes a mess of any other folder in there, while it should simply ignore unparsable folder names and look at the actual media files inside them.\nI read through the code in the sub-project which handles name parsing and the problem is not there, but likely in the code using it. Just downloading the report took ages because of all the binary blobs in there, and having to pull each sub-project individually (vs simple git submodules) and find where things are took longer than the time I had available to dig deeper right then.\nI may try digging through it again later if I get time to test more.\nThis bug currently makes finding media really annoying because of all the duplicates and missing/incorrect artwork and metadata.\n. @RedshirtMB It's not explicitly supported, no. But why the heck does it think any folder is a season? Surely a bug, no? I'd even be happier if it didn't traverse into folders it could not parse.\nAuto-organize is not a solution, I don't want to move files around when they are also tracked by other programs, and there's no technical or organizational reason to do so when only Emby (AFAIK) has issues with it.\nIf I can find the code doing the traversing of the folder structure, I will indeed try to fix this.\n. I didn't see the link to the code above, thanks.\n@ebr11, if simply laid out as \"a folder which is not a season is detected as such anyway\", it sounds like a pretty obvious bug to me. That sounded a bit sarcastic, but that's not intentional.\nI also maintain projects so I get the \"not supported\" part, somewhere you have to draw a line. The behavior I expected was either that the episode wasn't picked up, or that the folder was not parsed as any media-related \"entity\" and just an organizational detail.\nI'll put aside some time to figure out how navigate this source (to me it currently just looks like a bunch of random classes not doing much) and see if I can find a way to make it less keen on accepting anything as a season.\n. @LukePulverenti Thanks, this fixed some of the issues, but not all. It seems this is still broken for episodes numbered 9 and above. If I name the parent folder so it containsSXXE[01-08] they correctly get excluded from the Seasons listing, but S09-> produce weird seasons same as before (with the exact same folder contents).\nUpdate: The \"cutoff\" point in episode numbers seems to be differerent for different series, and possibly depending on what else is in the name. Got two instances of one E10 of a series, one with a slightly longer name and Emby only creates one extra Season for that one and correctly skips the instance with a shorter name. For the same series I also have two instances of E09, with the same naming schemes as for E10, and there Emby correctly skips both of them.. ",

From your main server you can connect with almost any device with a client (or the web interface, which is amazing) - even Kodi has a very good add-on. I use Emby to sort and store my media (videos, pics, music, books), and I have Kodi in the living room, and can sync (offline) my phone for videos I want to watch myself, or later (away from my server, for example on a plane).I have friends that use the DLNA component to watch their media using either a PS3, or even DLNA-capable blu-ray players across their local network.\nIn short, Kodi and Emby work together, not in competition. Emby is quite simply a very capable media server/manager; Kodi an awesome media player.\n. Great stuf!!

When my device tries to connect via Emby Connect, it does so using the VPN internal IP address.

Here is what happened (sorry if I am not explaining it well):\n- I had folder \"Newshow\"\n- renamed folder to \"newshow\" (mv /mnt/freenas/media/videos/tv/Newshow /mnt/freenas/media/videos/tv/newshow\" since I was in the process of renaming all my folders to underscore & lowercase\n- did a \"scan library\" in \"Manage Server -> Library\" to get the changed folder name to register\n- checked \"Metadata-Manager -> TV -> Newshow\" entry\n- noticed the \"path\" entry was still the capitalized \"Newshow\" but for \"Season 1\" and each episode underneath had the correct new lowercase folder name \"newshow\" \n- Symptom was that in the show overview no images were shown (presumably because emby was looking in \"Newshow\" instead of \"newshow\"). Season and Episode images were fine.\n- Doing a metadata refresh on the show resulted in the show overview images being redownloaded to /mnt/freenas/videos/tv/Newshow (fanart, landscape etc.) as to emby they were missing.\nWhile nothing serious I now had 2 folders where there should only be one. ~~This only happened when the new folder name was the same except for capitalization (So going from 'Newshow' to 'newshow' had this problem while going from \"The New Show\" to \"the_new_show\" correctly updated the show's root folder).~~ \nEdit: \nI spoke too soon: I had the same \"problem\" with other folders where the new folder name had added characters (\"My Movie (2008)\" -> \"my_movie_2008\") so capitalization is not the problem it seems. Movies had the old folder recreated and added a .nfo file as well. Manually deleting those again and doing a \"scan library\" fixed the issue (old folder names are not created anymore) and everything is working fine again. Maybe doing a emby-server restart inbetween helped? Maybe some sort of cache which caused the old folders to be recreated by emby?\n. Hi and thanks for the reply. Would be glad to test it. For the moment I renamed it to 'N.E.R.D' but I would just add another folder with the original name assigned by musicbrainz to test it.\n. Just tried a library scan with emby-server-beta-3.1.193~beta-1673 and it worked without a problem. Thanks for the quick fix. Metadata manager opens the folder subtree as well.\n. ",

Have I missed some setting?. Using Emby.zip from above I can replicate the error and agree with the conclusion that currently it only works if the *.mkv and the *.nfo has the same basename. Confirm the 3.2.26.0 release fixes movie.nfo however tvshow.nfo appears to remain broken.\nWould you like a new ticket or a continuation of this one.. Returning to try this again after a 5 month absence I am happy to report tvshow.nfo now works in 3.2.50.0. Screenshots for context.\nThis is how it should look (using the unsharded sample set linked above). 100% correct matching\n\n\nThis is how it actually looks (using the sharded sample set linked above). 0% correct matching\n. Just to close this down and summarise what has been posted here and what I have deployed and tested.\nSharded folders (referred to here  as complex) only work natively in Emby for movie sources.  Sharded folders do not work and will not ever work for TV sources.\nFor TV sources each letter shard should be added as a discrete source. \nFor example:\nusing the TV structure from my example zip  you would define each letter folder (e.g. #, A) as a different source.\nusing the movie structure from my example zip  you would define the base movie folder as a single source and all the shards will be analysed correctly\nThanks for the support.\n. Can we extend this ticket to allow defining a different or extra internal address please. When using docker in bridged mode the internal IP is shown as 172...* whilst the clients see the docker host private IP instead which by definition is a different subnet.. I dont profess to fully understand Emby setup in every detail but most home routers dont support split horizon DNS so if you use your WAN DNS address it will resolve to a public IP and not the private one.\nBest case scenario this causes all traffic to route into and out of the edge firewall but more likely it just wont work.\nI have a working setup here so I dont need support but I would suggest that these settings, especially for new docker users, would benefit for a deeper review, clarification and perhaps simplification.. A follow up with an even simpler example having identical symptoms (with or without URL only nfo makes no difference):\n. You are right this is not the naming conventions used for the paths but at the same time it is a very very common naming convention (probably the most common if you think about it). I would suggest that 1:1 Kodi structure compatibility would be a sensible end goal for any product in this space.\nI am working around it here with manual effort now which is less than ideal but https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/issues/3207 gives me hope this will be more powerful in the long term.. Is this related to https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/issues/3205 and if so should I close that one with this superseding it?. Is there any progress on this? I cannot see to find a slick way to refresh the data other than renaming a load of folders and then renaming them back (which is way too time consuming and wasteful).\nIs there a simpler way I can force Emby en masse to rescan and use the URL only movie.nfo data provided?\nIt is worth noting that this is made worse by the fact that at some time in the current beta cycle https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/issues/2559 cropped up again (seems fixed now) but it has left me with quite a few bad matches.. Can you suggest any interim way other than manually finding each bad match one by one and manually identifying it (since a fix is not in progress).. Polite re-ask of the above question.\nWhat is the correct way to recover from this bug without obliterating the database to start again and  losing all the watched information etc in the process.\nI simply want Emby to refresh all movies but pay attention to the URL only movie.nfo this time.\nEdit: still interested in this answer but on closer inspection I see that URL only movie.nfo seems broken again as well. Not always just some times. Is there somewhere we can engage more real time to hammer this out once and for all.. There are two scenarios this now:\n\nThe nfo contents are wrong due to human error and when fixed (within the nfo) are not picked up by Emby\nEmby ignores the nfo and tags the movie incorrectly (usually bug)\n\nScenario 1 is rare-ish but human error is human error and there should be a way to recover from it in Emby without having to artificially rename folders on disk to trigger a new movie index.\nIdeally these nfo changes should be detected automatically but if it has to be manual I would expect the intuitive way would be for one the Refresh Metadata options to to trigger a new movie index.\nScenario 2 is predominantly driven by bugs in handling URL only movie.nfo and tvshow.nfo. Unfortunately I seem to be the one spotting these and reporting them so I am suffering the most. It was broken and fixed after I reported it (thank you) in last release cycle and it broke and you fixed it during the last beta cycle (without me reporting it). Now I think I have found a one possibly two new test cases  where it doesnt work as expected.\nSo tl;dr you should be able to force Emby to properly try again to identify something and forget all its previous assumptions without leaving Emby itself.. For what it is worth I have a similar setup but using nginx.\nSetting the:\n\nLAN networks:\nComma separated list of IP addresses or IP/netmask entries for networks that will be considered on local network when enforcing bandwidth restrictions. If set, all other IP addresses will be considered to be on the external network and will be subject to the external bandwidth restrictions. If left blank, only the server's subnet is considered to be on the local network.\n\ndoes not appear to ever bypass the user needing authentication.\nPerhaps my syntax is incorrect as even taking this to the extreme by adding the entire IANA private IP address space 10.0.0.0/8, 172.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16 still has no impact.\nThere is a scenario where users think they are connecting locally but in fact NAT is presenting Emby with the external network IP however I can clearly seen my 10. address in the logs so for sure this isnt my specific issue.\n. Yes I have reconfirmed the sample data set provided above generates the same DUPE entries in both Version 3.6.0.84 beta and Version 4.0.0.0 beta. As far as I can tell this is the way it is currently setup, the default and the way it has always been configured here\n\nI am going to guess that since the movie.nfo is a URL type it is using the IMDB ID against OMDB and essentially bypassing TMDB.\n. The ttid for the IMDB movie reference\ne.g. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3920266/\nCan you replicate the bug with the provided zip file. I have tested it on multiple versions now and had it independently checked as well so I a quite confident it is reproducible with default 4.x install. I think you have found the source of the problem. It appears that in certain rare cases IMDB will end up with duplicates and in even rarer cases the fixed (i.e. merged) entry will take the later ttid rather than the earlier one.\nThe earlier ttid is then dropped and on the website the now old ttid URL is redirected to the new ttid.\nI have found a thread discussing one of the specific examples I happened to hit. https://getsatisfaction.com/imdb/topics/same-title-is-in-the-imdb-database-twice\nI think the path of least resistance would be to detect #DUPE# and present the Emby user with some better information.  For example we could name the movie as #DUPE or IMDB ID removed (or similar) and perhaps even insert a fuller explanation as the movie synopsis.\nEither way thanks for taking the time to debug this. I will leave this open in case you want to discuss this idea further or if you think it is not worth the effort please feel free to close as resolved.\n. ",

Was it finally a regression from some specific version change?\nI also see that you already created versioned docker tags; well done!\nBTW, I still do have the issue #2650, which is not very disturbing when I'm playing, but it is when I'm recording automatically (because I cannot change the audio stream after it has been recorded, ofc).\nAnyway, thank you so much Luke \ud83d\ude03 . Exactly the same issue after upgrading to 3.2.40.0. @LukePulverenti the issue is exactly the same. What do you exactly need a part from the specified in the original post? The current logs?\n. ",

Thanks for the response, is there any link i can look at the API in detail?\nOn the GITHUB wiki im not able to find something user related :/. Workaround for the few people who share the same issue:\nuse in the dotnet run command (dotnet embyserver.dll -config.....)\nthe parameter \"--fx-version\"\nas an example:\ndotnet --fx-version 2.1.0-preview1-25919-02 system/EmbyServer.dll -programdata /embyData\nThen it uses the custom dotnet version and it works.. https://hub.docker.com/r/nfxus/emby/ I build this docker image as a workaround till the emby dev team releases an official image :-). @nvllsvm I give it to you when i find it, this evening maybe.\n(its early development, dont expect too much). @nvllsvm https://github.com/RaymondSchnyder/docker-netcore/blob/master/Dockerfile\nHere, the file was already available, or did you mean something another?. @nvllsvm Yea xD\nIt works pretty good that way, do you have a idea how it could be better?\nBecause the documentation on how compiling emby for netcore is... a bit empty.. Did you try a newer Version of the framework?\nThere is 2.1 beta released i think\nEDIT: the one is use for my image is: \n2.1.0-preview1-25919-02\n. I can confirm this bug. It happens in my setup too.. That would open possibilities for easy illegal filesharing.\nI doubt they would implement that.. How much time do you need?\nwhen did you plan to do this?\nSome transparency on this please, i cannot use my emby premiere production right now because i need the ffmpeg from you, as the official one doesnt work anymore thanks to your modifications.. Transcoding with a vanilla 4.1 build isnt possible. Only DirectPlay.\nThe error message says that \"look_ahead\" is missing from the build.. @softworkz Because it is not included in my installation. I use the netcore zip.. But i will try ffmpeg 4.0.1 now, thanks. Now it works, i havent fully tested it yet (4.0.3 was the build i tested now). Thanks for the help, will document this in my notes for the future. @softworkz Sorry didnt saw your message there, im using Alpine Linux . ",

Trolling the source tree hasn't provide a way into solving the problem.. I think this is a user error Issue, not a defect/missing functionality.\nLooking at the source code, MediaBrowser.ServerApplication:MainStartup.cs checks to see if running as a service as part of its PerformUpdateIfNeeded() code. It would appear that if you are running MB as a service, you should not stop the service prior to doing the update. Updater.exe (which I can't see the source code for??)  is passed the service name to restart after the update completes.\nSo the solution is: don't stop the service prior to doing an update.\n. ",

I think you're missing my point entirely. perhaps another can be assigned to this ticket? No offense intended.\nI'm specifically -requesting- that a value be added for automatic folder naming under:\nAuto-Organize > TV > Season Folder Pattern\nfor release year (%y was an example for what could be used as the year variable name)\nas currently it only allows %s, which is season number.\nI don't really care how emby detects it in the library, but this is how I (and many others) store TV shows. (example: Show Name > Season X (YEAR) > Episode 1.mp4)\n. Ah yes, I see the issue.\nPerhaps look for episode 1, grab the release date - if no episode 1 is found when organizing, simply fallback to a non-year season folder?\neither way, I understand the issue, thanks for pointing it out. hopefully there will be a solution to it :)\n.

Hi Luke, No they were always there. In my guide data provider there is a setting to not show movie prefix but what that does is only not show it wmc guide I guess it does this because I have their application installed that does the import into wmc sees this setting and when it does the conversion to mxf removes it but this setting has no effect on the xmltv file that I or any one else downloads.\nSo that is why I have to use 2 more utilities before it gets imported into emby and it will be preferable if they weren't needed.

    "marmay": "Regarding the scaling, I made some fundamental assumptions in the code:\n- state.VideoStream.Width and state.VideoStream.Height contain the actual resolution of the video stream, so the values are not rounded to some resolutions that makes sense (e.g. 1920x1080) and do not take the aspect ratio into account.\n- The display aspect ratio is passed through into the output container.\nI do not know, whether those assumptions are correct. If they are not, then my code most likely breaks stuff.\nIf those assumptions are correct, however, I think it should do the right thing, which in my opinion is: If the requested output size or a maximum size are set, then set the output size to min( requested output size, maximum size ). If those values are different from the input size, add a scaling filter. One could argue, whether it would be better to set the output size to min( input size, requested output size, maximum size ), i.e. server does downsampling, but clients do the upsampling.\n. Sounds reasonable. I can isolate the changes and rebase the commit, if you want to?\nI'll also do some more testing regarding anamorphic pixels.\n. The field is mandatory, but I think that :0 is a sane default value, but I did most testing with /dev/dri/renderD128.\nAccording to ffmpeg documentation, this is the render node that is used for hardware acceleration. For dual video card systems, it may make sense to use :1 or something else instead.\nI think /dev/dri/renderD128 depends on the precise hardware that is used, i.e. I found /dev/dri/renderD64 as well, but :0 should be fairly portable.\n. Ah, sorry, I misread the documentation.\n:0 refers to the display, i.e. if the server runs without an X server, then this does not work.\n/dev/dri/card0 seems to be the best default value.\nBtw, thanks for making this such a nice experience.

    "bsdfirst": "I've had a dig around.  It appears to be a compile time option.  ffmpeg is either linked against an 8bit OR a 10bit libx264.  I can't see a way to force 8bit h264 when compiled against the 10bit library (which is the default in Arch).\nBasically, the whole thing is getting forced to 10bit (despite the high profile being 8-bit) because of this:\nIncompatible pixel format 'yuv420p' for codec 'libx264', auto-selecting format 'yuv420p10le'\nWe are already specifying -pix_fmt yuv420p but the libx264 codec is forcing a switch to the yuv420p10le colour space.  Which then causes and error because the high profile is also forced on the commandline.\nOne solution could be to abstract the -profile parameter to allow the user to choose between high and high10 in the config?  That may not be desirable though - I'm pretty new to Emby (okay...2 days now) but the philosophy seems to be \"just work\" without exposing lots of complex options to the user.\nI'll keep looking, but at the moment I don't see another obvious solution that won't break things as people shift to libx264-10bit.  (Short of shipping a statically compiled ffmpeg as part of the build.)\n. Yeah.  Being able to change the path to ffmpeg would solve the problem for advanced users (and those are going to be the users that have managed to install the 10bit version of libx264).  I suspect the problem will crop up again as the 10bit version of the library starts to become the default across other distros.\nI don't think there is a single easy answer.  On a positive note however, I have replaced the libx264-10bit package with the libx264 package.  It satisfies the same packaging depend for ffmpeg and installs the same library in the same location - so it's all good from a linking perspective.\nI've only tested on the commandline not in Emby proper, but that certainly seems to work.  So perhaps the short term answer is to check the libx264 version as part of your ffmpeg validation?\n. ffmpeg-enconders-8bit.txt\nffmpeg-enconders-10bit.txt\n.

    "mikey46656": "Hi. Thanks very much for taking a look at this. I did also put it in the community forum, but don't have the address handy (was done from my htpc). The IP address change sounds feasible, but the problem had been happening erratically for more than a month before it became \"permanent\", meaning not solvable by restarting anymore.\nAnyway, I've since found and installed Emby for WMC, which seems to be working perfectly, though it appears to be older(?). We use our htpc ~90% of the time for watching and recording TV, so I do want to stick with WMC/Win7. If you think there's a compelling reason to go back to the other Emby server then I'm willing to have a go at reverting and then trying to fix the (possible) IP problem, but otherwise, I'm willing to close the issue as long as Emby for WMC keeps working. A couple of times a week we use it to watch something from our collection of (legally) ripped DVDs, for which we love its library management and synopsis display, but new features are not really crucial to us.\nThanks again!\n-m\n.

This is the normal case for any beta/stable builds currently being published. (see documentation comments in the code for more details)\n\n\nWith regard to reading the value of EnableDebugLevelLogging,  we are using XPath navigation to query information in the DOM, so this is not as crude as attempting to manipulate the file as raw text.\n\n\nThe approach above was deemed to be the most sensible answer to the question \"how do we get early access to the system configured value of this setting, without adding unnecessary complexity to either the library itself or its caller?\" (i.e. adding dependencies on configuration managers)\n\n\nThe worst outcome with respect to the above is that for some reason in the future the location of this configuration setting changes, which would result in the initial severity defaulting to Info, which intentionally represents no change to the existing behaviour.\n\n\nAs this kind of change would be considered unlikely and unnecessary, it wasn't a convincing argument to overcomplicate the implementation.\n\n\nAll changes have been implemented in such a way that the existing implementation and behaviour remain unchanged, whilst any calls to leverage the new functionality are by default fail safe and unable to introduce new or unexpected exceptions.\n\n\nJames\n. As a further update, to gain some confidence in the changes and get some real-world feedback, I've created a customised build of 3.1.235-beta for Synology/XPEnology.\nThis includes this PR and a tweaked version of MediaBrowser.Server.Mono.exe, the changes to MediaBrowser.Server.Mono.exe are straightforward in nature and detailed below for reference.\n```\n//\n// Use new Constructor and

Hello @SvenVandenbrande - today's commits were to get the latest beta built on VS2017 using the MediaBrowser solution instead of the MediaBrowser.Mono solution. This was for Synology/XPEnology - i.e. a Mono target.\n. Hello\nThanks for the patch Ivan-L.\nLuke, what's the thinking behind persisting this to disk in the first place?\nThe data is volatile and is only useful during the lifetime of the Emby Server process.\nThere is perhaps an argument that it is useful should the lookup fail on first run and there is no address cached (persisted to disk), but on the flip side this just raises the possibility of using a wrong address for the initial timer interval.\nPerhaps a faster retry mechanism on failure (i.e. dynamically reduce the timer interval) would be an alternate and more effective approach, as the failure is likely to resolve itself. If the device does not have a functioning Internet connection, then the point is moot anyway.\nBest\n- James\n. ",

The issue then is that it appends the port after the external url, as shown.\nAll I am asking is for the ability to have an external url instead of an address:port, or for the ability to leave out the port, or for the ability to have the port come before the domain path.\nLet me know if you want me to further clarify!.

I swear I retested when I last commented and I don't think I've updated or restarted anything since, weird.\nSo, I'm guessing it's the chromecast app update even though the problem seemed like it was on server side.  Either way, I'm very happy to be able to watch subbed stuff on my tv again.  Thank you ^_^. The defaults work fine for single audio, it's when you have dual audio that things become a mess.  For example anime sources that have both Japanese w/ sub and English dub audios.  It's pretty common for dubbed anime DVD and Bluray releases.. @cayars that's exactly my point, I don't want to double it up on disk, I want to add a single folder twice.\nThere's some cases where I prefer the Japanese VAs but watching with my other half is easier with it being dubbed.\nActually, I've noticed that that it does occasionally get the wrong language even with the default set.  Not sure why.. > It would help the Wife Approval Factor a lot.\nThat is legitimately my biggest interest \ud83d\udc4d . @LukePulverenti Yes, I still want this feature\n@cayars You seem to have missed the point spectacularly.  The reason I want this feature is BECAUSE I don't want to rely on the default track selection in the file itself.  I want to have a single library that I add to emby as two separate libraries... Let me draw a diagram of sorts:\n\nLibrary 1: Dual audio media (dub)\nSource folder: /media-library/dual-audio\nOverride: Force audio: English\n\nOverride: Force subtitles: Signs\n\n\nLibrary 2: Dual audio media (sub)\n\nSource folder: /media-library/dual-audio\nOverride: Force audio: Japanese\nOverride: Force subtitles: English\n. 3.3.1.0.

D:. > We already have a double tap on the left/right side of the screen to fast forward and rewind. it is just not currently working on ios devices.\nThere is? When I do chromecast this functionality... isn't self-evident. Is it a \"hidden\" feature?. Any chance we can get this tied to a milestone or something? :) I'm itching for this!. AWWW YEAH!!!. I'm on 3.2.50.0, and this happens when I'm using a desktop browser to watch stuff. It seems to happen quite frequently really!\nAlso, I haven't switched to .NET Core just yet :). I just reproduced it on first try. Steps taken\n\nLoad a video (in this case \"How it's made\")\nMouse to window on other monitor (switching focus)\nMouse back to window running emby\nPress space to try and pause it, it then immediately takes me back to the media selection window, with some elements missing (only showing Next Up, not Continue Watching, but I have the controls along hte top).\n\nI think this is about focus switching.. Performing the same steps, except not having a video playing, seems to cause the page to scroll down, and when it hits the bottom, it goes to the \"Next Up\" section (only showing that).\nIt looks like they may be related... not sure.... But that doesn't explain why pressing space makes me go back, when I had not hit back before hand. I understand what you're referring to here, and I really don't believe that's what's going on here. The previous actions taken don't involve clicking on a back button, they involve playing a video, and maybe hitting fullscreen. So those are the functions that might be called if what I was experiencing, was as you described, but those aren't the functions that are happening when I hit space in these cases.. Yeah this is seriously still happening to me almost every time I press space, it just goes \"back\". It's at the point where I curse myself every time I press space now, because it's like Russian roulette, except almost every chamber has a bullet.. @LukePulverenti that seems very probable, but I am not yet seeing how, hmmm.. Occasionally, but I've been playing media mostly through Chromecast anyways, so I haven't tried it a lot in a browser recently.\nAre there any changes that might have \"fixed\" it in recent releases? I have updated my Emby install regularly. It's 3.3.0.0 right now!. Just happened to me again. Argh! :P. Yeah it still happens. Same as before. I'm not sure what to do about it at this point.... Just upgraded the Ubuntu install to 18.04, from 16.04, and this re-did how .NET core is setup, probably for the better. So far, I think spacebar may be working as intended.\nBut I'm going to test further before I can be sure...\nAm I the only one experiencing this?\nThere is one maybe related issue though. When I click on the video to pause it, pressing spacebar doesn't resume/pause it. As it seems to have lost \"selection\" of the pause/play button. Won't work again till I click on the play/pause button, then spacebar does work again correctly for pause/play.. Just upgraded to 3.5.0.0, and pressing space takes me back again. :(\nI don't think this is a regression, but it does seem to be present.\nThat being said, 3.5.0.0 has made moving through the web interface SOOOOOOO much faster now!. @LukePulverenti I most certainly do! You guys deserve my money, so I give it willing ;)\nWhy do you ask?\nAlso, your explanation makes sense, and uhh, is a weird situation indeed! HAH!. @LukePulverenti if you're talking about the EmbyConnect, online SSO/Federated auth, I don't use that. The first reason I use Emby instead of Plex, is because I only want internal auth, not online, for privacy reasons ;)\nThat is, unless I'm missing the point here?. Um, when I click that link and press space, it proceeds to the next steps for setting it up, then generate pin. Is that what you wanted me to test?\nI didn't have it connect to my Emby setup, just to be clear on that.. @LukePulverenti I don't think you understand my privacy concerns around doing that. I'm not comfortable doing that.. @LukePulverenti I thought this service was a federated/SSO external service provided by the biz behind Emby? If it is only going from my browser, to my server, directly, then I will try it out.\nIs there any facet of that tv.emby.media service that ever exits my premises, apart from the initial DNS resolution and page load?. @LukePulverenti thanks for clarifying! :) I appreciate you respectfully working through this with me.\nI've tried two videos with tv.emby.media, and it seems that spacebar defaults to the play/pause button thus-far, and does not switch to the back function.\nI also want to mention, in my earlier testing when it went \"back\", the way it went back was wonky. In that, the \"back\" page only partly loaded, and sometimes elements wouldn't load (like the background might be white sometimes), so I'm not sure if it's using the same function call as the back button itself. Despite the recent observations we've seen.\nHow many samples do you want me to gather for you?. @LukePulverenti it looks like it!\nBTW in Theater it doesn't seem to have music song queue manipulation ;) (click drag to change order, etc)\nAnything else you need from me at this time? Or wait to hear back on your end?. @LukePulverenti can't wait ;). Yeah I'll try it out! :D. Music playback seems to be stable with this build. Tried to break it a few ways, and it played just fine!. Yeah I put a slash in the game. What are the acceptable characters?. Well, I ended up using an ampersand (&) anyways, so that works ;P\nI can see the reasoning behind Windows filesystem limitations being the Lowest Common Denominator.. W00t!. Sweet!. Sorry, the issue didn't come back. I will come back with actually useful info if I see it again.. @LukePulverenti you're misunderstanding. I want the music playback to transition back to my phone, not continue on the Chromecast. Hitting \"No\" lets the playback continue on the Chromecast, but does not transition it back to my phone.\nAlso, you madman, you're so fast to respond!. @LukePulverenti that's fine, just trying to point out something that'd be nice to have somewhere in the queue of updates ;). This issue may be a focus thing. When I switch away to another app, so both screens are active, but use the second small screen to tell it to change song (with Chromecast), the Music stops again.. @LukePulverenti I'm going to have to retest and get you results, plus the results I promised you for the 4K stuff, heh. Sorry it's taking so long! XD. @LukePulverenti Okay so the LG v20 second screen control bug described above is gone, but there's two new bugs.\nSo, to be clear. When I connect my phone to my chromecast (video or audio), tell it to play, it plays and I can use the back/forward buttons on my second screen, and it doesn't \"crash\" or stop thinking a Media Player is playing. So that particular detail seems to be working now.\nAs for the new bugs.\n\n\nPause/Play doesn't seem to work on the LG v20 second screen when connected to the Chromecast and I'm playing music. This DOES work when I'm not connected to the Chromecast. Unsure what's going on here.\n\n\nWhen I (dis)connect to/from the Chromecast (video/audio), while music is playing, I stop being able to control the music, and this is on the LG v20 screen and I think the controls in the main app too. This seems to be something specific to connecting/disconnecting to/from the chromecast devices. When I connect the music does transition to the device and keep playing, I just can't interact with it or control it.. BTW a bunch of requests do get HTTP 200 code, but most of them seem to timeout.. @LukePulverenti the issue is subtitle scanning is taking upwards of like 10min-30min+. I believe these issues are related to why it takes so long. All other tasks typically take seconds to complete.. Why is it trying to re-download subtitles for media that already has them downloaded? That's what it looks like it's doing though.. \n\n",

    "Criena": "Ah, my bad. I scimmed through the issues, but only checking for \"^feature\". Considering there are quite a few people interested in this, I wonder why nothing is happening since 2015.. Basic Auth might be old, but it's also much more secure than advertising Web applications publicly.\nIf Emby has a security flaw, only internal users will be able to exploit it. Everyone else won't even get access to any part of Emby.. I'm currently doing that with an nginx in front of Emby. The downside is that the app doesn't support this and is therefore unusable if being outside the internal network. But for that I'm using the normal web interface.\nWould it be really such an issue to take the login credentials from an HTTP-Auth header opposed to from the current login form?. I don't see an issue with Emby requiring a user. Currently Emby takes the login credentials from the login form (username and password). If Emby would check whether an \"Authorization\" header was sent by the client (in my instance the reverse proxy, nginx) and use these credentials opposed to showing a login form, it should be fine. Emby then still has its user that it can base everything on. Just instead of using an HTML form to provide the username, it would come from HTTP header. The reverse proxy (in my instance nginx) can forward the authentication information to the Emby server. I'm doing this with other servers as well.\n. Just to make sure there is no misunderstanding... This approach means that the user who is logging in via HTTP Basic Auth would need to exist with Emby already in order for the mapping to work. It's just an alternative to the HTML login form.\nIndependent from that it might be interesting to get an LDAP integration for the backend, but that's a separate topic.. ",

Well 3.3.0.0 is the latest stable and 3.3.0.4 is the latest beta... \nSince you talk about repository package: I would guess that you are on the opensuse repo. This would mean you have a mono build. I have a .net core build from the deb package available here. I don't know if it makes any difference in this case, but actually the .net core builds are the way to go, because mono is deprecated.\nFurthermore: do those filenames have any special characters like punctuation, umlauts or whatever?. Ok...\nBecause you're getting your updates with apt it means you have some repo configured. The only repo I know is the opensuse repo which offers mono builds. The deb files you get here are .net core builds... and those are the ones I have installed.\nSee:\nhttps://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Aemby&package=emby-server. Just to double check: downgraded my server to stable version (.net core build) and I don't have the issue. I bet that it is only related to the mono build. \nFor installation of emby only refer to this site:\nhttps://emby.media/download.html\nand don't use other packages or repos.... By the way: if you really need the mono version for some reason you can get a zip here from github, maybe opensuse has a old build script or whatever.... This is not an issue as long as you are using a build from an UNOFFICIAL source. Try it with the builds provided by emby directly. If the issue persists then it could be reopened but for now this is just not our business and beyond the control of the emby team. . Yes.. @rofrantz Your description of the issue was with 3 or a couple of images. I've tested this on two systems, ubuntu and windows, and I couldn't reproduce the bug, so the only logic conclusion was that your build is faulty. Now @linussweden says that it only happens with 500+ images, which I didn't have tested. By the way I'm not part of the emby dev team. I'm only a contributer here. And I guess this was closed because it's a duplicate of #2999.... \"generic example\"\n3 photos or 500+ is a huge difference...\n3 photos would affect nearly everybody, 500+ photos in one folder is a very rare border case imho.... Sorry, I've created a new one at #3058. This one had a unnecessary if clause in it. I've made a git reset.. @LukePulverenti Thank you for the new build. It works and the quality of Live-TV looks great.. Can you please provide more details? What do you mean by device, a device running an emby app or the emby server?. I know it is dirty :/ but I didn't find any other way.. I'm now working on a binary reader do deal with the issue. Looks promising.. Yes it would probably be the best to do it in the plugin. I've implemented a reader in the emby-server for now. I've tested it a couple of times and it works. The advantage of it is that it could also handle missing mimeTypes of other plugins.\n3187. @LukePulverenti\nDon't you prefer this approach over  #3185 ?. ",

Most likely an issue with the FFmpeg version bundled with the software, will try to reproduce with a custom built binary with all encoders enabled.\n. Hello there,\nI no longer own the Haswell platform, but will retest on a Skylake based\nmachine.\nI'm sure that the error I encountered was related to how ffmpeg's encoder\nhandles some codec types , but to confirm, a test has to be repeated.\nRegards,\nDennis.\nOn Mar 25, 2017 11:20 PM, \"Luke\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHi guys, please be aware this is still an experimental feature for us, and\nas such, we are not yet going to have the answer for every possible issue.\nHave you tried experimenting with newer ffmpeg builds?

    "OronDF343": "Log: server-63625878715.txt\nI just set it up on my new PC, same as before. Still doesn't work for me. @LukePulverenti Yes. I've updated to 3.2.33.0 to confirm it.. I don't know much about UPnP internals, but I think either some sort of incompatibility is happening here or Emby isn't actually sending the UPnP request, since all other apps using UPnP on this network work.\nI am able to find the DLNA stuff in Wireshark, but none of it makes sense to me, and I suspect I'm not looking at the right packets.. 1) Checking if I can access Emby using my external IP, in the browser, on both HTTPS and HTTP (also tested my DuckDNS address)\n2) Checking on the router's admin pages if Emby (or its port numbers) is listed in the \"UPnP Settings List\" (where other applications such as qBittorrent show up if they are configured correctly).

The SOAPACTION is also missing the xmlns details.\n(NOTE: If you have noticed that each of these requests is to a different router, you are correct. Emby did not contact the correct router - It sent the request to a second router that extends the wireless network with WDS, a TP-Link Archer C2, to which my PC is now connected. However, this is a recent change in my networking setup, long after I first opened this issue. Therefore, that can be ignored for now, but this means that the UPnP issue most likely affects all TP-Link routers.). Have you seen my edit to my previous comment?\n Anyway, here is the XML: https://pastebin.com/ce2HbBFE\nIn addition to the edit above, the request URL from Emby may be incorrect. Original setup was to connect to the main router (TD-W9980 at 192.168.1.1) directly over Wi-Fi.\n. ",

Can you enable and disable the UPnP setting in advanced, restart your server and send your log.

Those two logs would be helpful to look at.. can you pastebin the xml from http://192.168.1.2:1900/gatedesc.xml ?. What was your original setup before? What happens when you turn off UPnP on this router? . A log would be great, and are you using a reverse proxy on your internal network?. ",

    "chowbok": "This would also solve a problem I brought up in the forums, which is that I have a few trailers that are unconnected with movies in my library, for various reasons.. Seems like then I have to duplicate their episode ordering errors if I want otherwise correct metadata on a particular episode. I can live with it, though.. I guess for me it would mainly be the provenance of the file; some movies have Blu-ray releases by different companies, I'd like to be able to note which one I'm using. I have movies where I merged the commentary track from a different edition; that'd be another thing I'd like to indicate and really can't with the existing metadata schema. Or if a movie cuts off or there's some other problem with the print. Also, there's currently no equivalent to IMDB's \"movie connections\" field; this could serve that function by listing sequels or remakes (even if they wouldn't be linked). Finally, this would be an acceptable workaround for Bug #3331 until that gets implemented.\nThese are just off the top of my head; I'm sure other people would find other uses for them.. Right, I deliberately didn't list things that would be better served as tags. Something like \"movies that take place in Chicago\" would be a fine tag; \"I copied the commentary from the Lion's Gate DVD and added it to the video from the Sony Blu-ray\" probably wouldn't be..

    "dominic-p": "Wow, thanks for the quick and insightful reply. I'm still pretty new to service workers. Could they be used to send an event or message to the main thread that's handling playback to start the next song? I could see it working like this:\n\nSong starts.\nA message is sent to the service worker to schedule a message/notification for when the song ends (based on song length)\nSong ends. The service worker sends a message to the main app to start the next song.\n\nOf course, if the user intervened in playback, any pending messages would have to be canceled.\nThoughts? Bad idea?. Ok, I'll look into the service worker API when I get some time.\nI know there's also a Wake Lock API that the W3C is playing with. If that gets supported, we might be able to simply acquire a CPU only wake lock when playback starts and release it when playback stops.. Makes sense. I've been exploring a few different avenues that could work.\n\n\nExtendableEvent.waitUntil() could be perfect, but I'm not sure how to make it work. See this discussion.\n\n\nThe W3C Task Scheduler API should also be able to solve the problem if it's ever adopted. Same with the W3C Wake Lock API. I think the later is implemented behind an experimental flag in Chrome for desktop, but I'm not sure about mobile (where we need it).\n\n\nThe most promising solution I found that could work now is to leverage the Push API. Basically, when the user starts playing a song, a message is sent to the server with the song's duration. Then, the server sends a push message to the client just before the song is set to end. Ideally, this would wake the client and allow it play the next song. There are 2 unresolved issues with this approach I can see so far: 1) I'm not sure if the push would actually wake the device or if it would just be queued for when the device wakes up (defeating the point). 2) I'm not sure if we can send a push message without a visible UI (which would annoy users).\n\n\nAnyway, I wanted to document what I found for now. If I have time to play with it some more I'll post here. But, we can leave the issue closed until we have something concrete/usable.. You may be right about that, but from what I've been reading, Service Workers are meant to be short lived. It would probably change their life-cycle/design philosophy considerably to enable playback. But, we'll just have to see how the landscape develops.. Sorry to post again on a closed issue. I had one other idea that could work. What if we live streamed the audio?\nThe server could dynamically generate a stream from the files in the playlist. We wouldn't have to worry about js being suspended because the audio source wouldn't need to be changed. \nThere are other advantages too including faster startup time and the ability to do fancy adaptive bitrate streaming if the bandwidth changes. \nThere seem to be quite a few different streaming protocols out there including the Web Audio API. This node package looks like an interesting take on the problem using Web Audio over Web Sockets. \nThoughts?. ",

SORRY! \n And regarding my transcode problems, it seems that with 3.2.19.0 I no longer have any problems transcoding 10bit files; except for a few movie files from way back when 10bit encoding was a bit (hehe) experimental. \nAlso, I'm not entirely sure that the new Emby version fixed the problem, or if it has to to with the fact that I made a clean install of Libreelec/Kodi for my Pi3 with only stable (non-beta)  add-ons.\nAnyway, you have my thanks :).

    "RacerXx": "Yes please. with 3800+ iptv channels already grouped from IPTV provider its hard to go through all 3800+ channels 5 at a time in emby. This should not be labeled as enhancement IMO but instead a priority. With the coming wave of IPTV and cord-cutters expect real demand for this. Not having channel groups or a way to edit individual channels epg (schedules direct or over the air epg (for local channels)) is a real downside and possible deal breaker for potential lifetime customers. Myself included. NextPVR already does all this and more and its free. Only thing emby has that nextpvr does not is linux. Cord-cutters like me are buying small-form factor mini-pc's\\servers such as the xu4 ( http://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php ) These little devices have powerful octa-core cpus running linux kernals.

Seems to scan ok when mounted. \nWell mounting it locally always worked but I was hoping not to have to do that all the time otherwise what is the point in hosting it on a remote server ?\nHey ho. . >  How does it change anything? it's just two different ways of importing an smb share into Emby.\nWell for one thing you have to extend permissions locally to the server to mount the share for another if I am to mount a share locally why would I need/want SMB browsing in the first place. I should just use NFS and be done with it. \nDon't get me wrong I am not criticising as such but being a Linux geek networking and data transparency is very much my thing. I should be able to move a back end server from one piece of physical hardware to another and not have any services be interrupted which becomes increasingly important when you start virtualising services.\nEither way, I think it is needed to mark that scanning a  SMB share do not work reliably and either remove that option from the configuration or find out a way to improve it. \nThanks. .

However when Stopping the episode, it only shows the Episode title.\nExample:\nUser has started playing Star Wars Rebels - The Last Battle\nUser has stopped playing The Last Battle\nNot a big deal, but I thought I should mention it as it does not conform to the other client apps reporting and may break \"stopping  playback\" notifications as previous to this fix, notifications were broken for all FireTV clients..

If that is outside the scope of Emby, please go ahead and close out this request.. Apologies, I did jump the gun a bit.  After clearing cache / cookies in chrome, it is now updating properly.

Well, apparently not that obvious to you, that \"obvious workaround\" was for us to get actual log from the command line and help identify the issue. But it seems you need to fix your attitude before you're able to fix this.. No wonder your service was failing to start, your sed command would also modify those 3 lines from the systemd unit:\nEnvironmentFile=/etc/conf.d/emby-server\nWorkingDirectory=/usr/lib/emby-server\nExecStart=/usr/bin/emby-server. Apparently the dotnet runtime expects curl to be built with openssl instead of gnutls, and I'm using the latter, that's why it's not happy. I guess I have no choice but to switch to openssl :(. Had time to try on the rpi 3, building curl against openssl instead of gnutls didn't help. I'll need to look further into it.. Ok, I get it now. The dotnet runtime expects curl abi 3, not abi 4 on armhf. I'll have to either disable versioned symbols, which I'd prefer but expect not to work, or ship a very old curl version, which contains all those nice vulnerabilities: https://curl.haxx.se/docs/vuln-7.15.5.html. Found a better way, rpmbuild can be overriden to ignore certain false positives regarding dependencies. The next beta and stable arm releases will install without complaining about this.. The rpm doesn't come from a repository so you need to download it and install it manually.. You're not looking at the right Dockerfile, we're not using any Debian-based distros as our base image.\nI've added iconv support to our ffmpeg build, could you please give the latest beta docker image a try?. While the arm CPUs from Marvell are indeed armhf capable, the WD firmware is armel and won't run armhf code. Did you try running your package on any of the arm models?. Docker images ship their own implementation of the C stdlib (glibc, musl, uclibc or whatever the case may be) and dynamic linker, which is why they can (in theory, because the linux kernel does not use hardware floating point, but not always true) run armhf code even if the host is armel, provided the CPU does have a VFP unit. Our deb packages don't ship the C stlib and use the system one instead, everything inside uses the armhf dynamic linker (ld-linux-armhf.so.3) while the WD firmware has the armel dynamic linker (ld-linux.so.3).. Possibly, but that's where the in theory comes in, I already tried on my EX2 Ultra to no avail, the dotnet runtime refused to work even with the right dynamic linker. I should give docker another try though, it's way easier to do the testing with it.. Now that I know there are x64 models, I tried adding wd packages to our builds, but I don't have any x64 wd device at hand. Would you be willing to give them a try?. FTR, the Arch Linux package uses skia-sharp60 (not skia-sharp), which is at 1.60.0, the logs should display that version during startup.

In any case I attempted to replicate this issue again and provide the logs, however, I can no longer replicate it. I do not believe there was any kind of error in my original execution since I tried it on two machines and executed identical commands (to what I am using now) and verified everything along the way (I also tried about 4 times). Today it is working fine - the service does not fail like it was and I can access emby on port 8096 as expected.

I am not going to lie, that is a very confusing scenario. \nIn my experience you can not create a symlink to a folder that already exist... So you are creating a folder named /media/TV, with nothing inside of it. Adding that to Emby as undefined content. Then going back and creating a symlink from the Videos/SeriesX folder to /media/TV? That is the part that is confusing me because you shouldn't be able to symlink to /media/TV as it already exists.\n Also in my testing just now, that will not work. If you use CLI and try to access that new /media/TV then you will see that the symlink is now inside of that folder, instead of that folder itself being the symlink.

So I just reverted these changes and everything came back to normal.\nIm curious to undestand how this happened since it happened only in Chrome and only in the Emby webUI. No other websites were affected afaik. (maybe there is a way to force the Emby webUI to use the material icon font??)\nAnyway, thanks for you help, Luke. I really appreciate the job you are doing with Emby. Thats exactly what I did to figure out the font was not being downloaded. No HTTP requests were being made when I was having this problem. As soon as I got rid of the /etc/fonts/local.conf file the HTTP requests to download the font started to show up in the network tab.\nI might be wrong, but I think Chrome tried to check if the material font was my local filesystem prior to requesting it from the network, then Fontconfig recieved this request, checked   /etc/fonts/local.conf to see if it was available and matched the requested font with Noto Sans, returning Noto Sans font to Chrome use to render the fonts that were supposed to be Material. \nOnly speculation from what I briefly read here and here, but I will take some time later today to look into that again.\nProblem is solved, so feel free to close the issue, Luke.

Isn't track selection completely client-side?. In case anyone is following along here, also posted in the Community.. Similar problems with files that have only AC-3 in them but devices (looking at you Apple) that can't play/downmix audio locally.. Just looking at this from a different angle, so was:\n\nThe apple tv example is not valid here\n\nin response to my:\n\nfiles that have only AC-3 in them but devices (looking at you Apple)\n\n?  If so, I was not looking at Apple for their TV but for their iPad and iPhone which also have limited codec support and could use (audio-only) transcoding.  But this is also going to be true for Chrome/Android devices that can't downmix AC-3 also.\nIn fact, other than advanced media playing software like Mplayer, VLC, etc. is anything capable of downmixing AC-3 to something more usable?\nIt seems like there is a whole class of situations where a downmix/audio-only-transcode from an AC-3-only audio file is needed.. Subject to the Allow audio playback that requires transcoding setting in a user's profile though?\nI read that as the setting that says \"allow transcoding of audio (but not video)\".\nHas that always been there or was it introduced just recently?. So, I recall seeing those transcoding settings and have set them because indeed, my Emby server does not have the horsepower to transcode video in real time.\nWhat I don't remember seeing before was specifically the Allow audio playback that requires transcoding.  Is that describing what I am interpreting it as?  That it will transcode the audio of an A/V media file if necessary?  Or is that only applicable to audio-only files like music?. > It is not guaranteed that all media will be playable in every app if you take away access to transcoding.\nUnderstood.  For the case of just needing to transcode/downmix audio, the server should be able to handle that and should be allowed so that the media item is playable.  For video, the server just cannot handle it so regardless, the user just cannot watch the media on the device they are trying to.. In any case, I will adjust user account settings and see if this resolves my problem of videos with only AC-3 being unplayable on certain devices.. I am still having problems with audio on chromecast devices.\nGiven a media file that has just an AC-3 track, it plays on my Android phone but I have only gotten it to play once (out of many attempts) on my chromecast connected directly to my 2-speaker television.  Other than that once, I get video only and no audio.\nFirst thing is probably for me to understand what is supposed to happen.\nDoes the chromecast actually know the device it's plugged into only has 2 speakers and report that to Emby?\nIs Emby supposed to be transcoding audio in such a case?\nHow can I determine if transcoding audio is actually happening in such a case?  Does Emby execute ffmpeg to do this transcoding?  Should I see it as a child process of the emby mono process?. ",

Once the file failed to play once it will happen over and over for this file.\nAlso, Emby does an excellent job otherwise in Firefox 57.

    "linussweden": "Bump!\nPlease fix this issue soon. Cannot be that difficult to look into and find the cause. I've experienced this bug for so long now, and I finally found this posting confirming that it is a known bug.\nIt is a very annoying bug. I do not want to completely re-organize my photo collection folders in order to work around the bug and view photos through Emby as all photos have been indexed already in various photo apps I use. Having to re-organize the folder would void all my indexes, tags etc in my photo collection.\n. Finally fixed!\nLooks like its working now. Tested in web UI (in chrome), android phone, ios ipad, emby theater windows desktop.\nI could not be happier. :)\n/Linus. This issue does exist in official builds, at least I think so.\nI downloaded my emby server from emby website a couple of years ago and installed it on Windows 10. I've had this bug since at least a year back.\nI've got my home videos and photos folder sorted by name, descending, no filter, so that the newest photos appears at the top. I've included photos from two phones. These phones sync all of their photos to a single folder each, so I've got two folders included in the library. The folder that contains more than 500 photos is the one giving me problems. \nThe photos are shown correctly as previews/thumbs but if I click on them they show the first picture in that folder in fullscreen instead of the correct picture. Only the oldest 500 pictures in that folder works correctly. Any photo but the oldest 500 is affected by the bug. \nI'm running emby server 3.3.1.0 and the bug is in this version. It's been in all updates for as long as I can remember. Perhaps it was once working correctly or I've not had more than 500 photos in a single folder before, I could not tell. I've only updated as far as I can remember from automatic updates that emby server downloads itself.\nOr perhaps I'm running an unofficial release and I just don't know it?\nThe bug is present in both web interface as well as in emby theater for Windows.\n.

Click to see the 1st picture and u'll notice that even if the preview is correct, the fullsize picture is wrong. I checked last night on Ubuntu after performing the latest updates of course and its still there :(. I have also ubuntu 16.04 and I see I have 3.3.0.0 and i did the apt-get update & upgrade last night.\nCould it be that they did not update the repository package maybe since I see that the latest version 3.3.0.4 ?. And yes its a home & video library. No special names and I've specified I'm on ubuntu 16.04 same as u. Updated again @LukePulverenti @gerrit507 emby (which indeed seems a Mono version) on a Ubunu 16 server.

Ok so I guess u would recommend the link from https://emby.media/download.html @gerrit507, right ?. Do u know if its possible to use the git repo and compile it on ubuntu or is this related to the big GPL licence issue and its not possible ?\nAny other proposal for an easy auto update linux repository is also appreciated.\n. ...apparently some devs are not capable to send thumbnail photo id and display the full size image of that exact photo.\nOn the good side they're over qualified for closing reported issues very fast even before they solve them with a futuristic statement \"fixed in the next release\".\nIt's been 4 months guys for a very simple problem guys. U dont have time for all reported issues ? Provide the sources so the community devs can help u or rip !\nPlex or any other decent app...here I come.... My bad indeed, issue can be closed.. Issue with no of photos = 3 is fixed; 4, 5, 6, ... 500 remaining not to mention that Luke closed it right away as a duplicate of #2999 which has 5 months.\nDo I need to open an issue for 501 photos or u finally understood 501+ means 500 or more and I provided a generic example.... Enabling this by default means you've already done some \"work\" and @rhazor discovery could f%$/\u20ac-up your project.\nAnd when I think that some people have the generous offer to even pay for this.\nUninstalling !\nThis info should go public !.

    "Firerouge": "Thanks for the tag @LukePulverenti , I think it would be more accurate to call this a Bug report however, the missing settings menu when streaming from a synced source breaks two other features in addition to the quality selection feature.\nIt's true that I wrote this in the style of an enhancement request, but that was only because this is the first and only version of Emby I've used, so I was uncertain what the intended, or proper functionality of the quality selection in this use case should be, so I instead documented how I'd expect this feature to function normally.. It actually looks like spacebar maps to whatever the previous button that was clicked in the web ui. \nSo if you click the fullscreen button, then press space, it'll exit fullscreen, click space again and it'll go fullscreen again.\nTo replicate space going back, all you should have to do is click the back button once, then space will continue to go back until you click another button in the UI.\nThis is the behavior I observed under Mac OS, Chrome 62, Emby 3.2.40.0. > Is there a good place where I can find info about developing a plugin?\nThe wiki has decent documentation on plugin development. Check out the getting started page, and read the rest of the wiki. \nYour C# knowledge won't be of much use, the language used by Emby is .NET and Mono.\nIf you're looking for more concrete examples, I found digging through the GameBrowser Plugin source useful. I believe it also defines additional metadata sources (for games) so you might be able to use it for reference.\nAs for the overall points regarding Metadata managing, there's definitely work that needs to be done, seasons of shows stored in different directories particularly struggle for example, the solution really shouldn't be just to rework your directory structures..

I've been using the \".sample\" naming trick to hide them.\nIf it matters, the library folder for the above files is /media/Movies/Movies, and upon further examination only a small fraction of \"sample\" files are appearing in Emby, despite having similar or identical names to files that are correctly ignored.\nIf you want an actual file to examine, let me know.. That specific one is Movie.Title.2010.1080p.BluRay.H264.AAC-RELEASEGROUP.mp4 in the same folder; the others are all similar -- in the same folder, movie title in the file name, nothing resembling \"sample\" in the file name..

Everything is now building under .NET Core - sort of...\nI also plan on replacing the binary blobs with libraries which re-implement class members, but just throw not implemented exceptions i.e. they will become dummy libraries; I'll be doing this purely to satisfy build time dependencies.\nOne thing I noticed when working on this is that your .net core releases are based around a small app host library called 'EmbyServer' , this does not appear to be published in this repository. I am re-implementing parts of this myself by examining it's members using Visual Studio; I have excluded this re-implementation from my repository for reasons I'll go into further down.\nSince the final build will include dummy libraries instead of your proprietary ones, the server wont run as is. Therefore I plan on implementing a function within my version of 'EmbyServer' to download the proprietary ones on first run and replace the dummy libraries with those.\nThis will satisfy 2 things:\n1) It will make open source nuts like me happy.\n2) It'll be build-able on .net core.\nI've explained my intentions with this here:\nhttps://github.com/dcrdev/Emby/issues/5\n(The gist being - I'll make it clear you wont support it, I'll make it clear that people absolutely should be purchasing premiere from you and I do not plan on removing any of your restrictions or advertisements.)\nHow do you feel about this? Is it something you'd be OK with? I'm asking and that's why I haven't published my re-implementation of 'EmbyServer' yet.. > I guess that is fine for now. As mentioned elsewhere we will gradually get them removed, so ideally it would only be temporary.\nGreat thanks @LukePulverenti - like you said hopefully should be temporary.. ",

    "CaiB": "Hi Luke,\nThanks for the reply, you've cleared up a few of the questions.\nIt seems like I was going about it a bit wrong. I'm trying to get Emby to deal with my current library format, and am cleaning up data in Emby afterwards, when I should be standardizing my library first.\nI don't think you addressed these though:\n- Is there a way to bulk-edit some fields in the metadata manager?\n- If Emby couldn't figure out what a show/season/episode was, but I manually find it on one of the supported metadata sources, how can I get it to grab the info based on that info? I've tried entering the ID in the corresponding field, then clicking \"refresh metadata\". All that does is get rid of the ID I entered...\n- Is there a good place where I can find info about developing a plugin? I'd like to make one to add a new metadata source specialized towards what I watch, and there currently aren't any plugins that support the site. I'm pretty familiar with C#, I just don't know where to get started working on a plugin for Emby. The wiki here seems really light on info.\nThanks!. Hi Luke,\nSorry for the delay, GitHub didn't send me a notification for some reason.\nI'm looking into building a plugin that will grab metadata from MyAnimeList.net, as their database is pretty complete and thorough. I also pretty much exclusively use the user ratings on there as reference (currently, a lot of shows/episodes are just 10s from the built in metadata sources, which is kinda useless).\nEventually once I get that working, I also want to extend the plugin to automatically set an episode as watched on my MyAnimeList.net profile when I watch that episode in Emby.. ",
    "rbrtribeiro": "Thanks for the reply Luke.\nNot sure what you mean by \"it's always possible to change\" but let me try to argue why that is an inhibitor for me and potentially multiple other users. \nMost of the media watched by me and by my media sharing small community is in a foreign language (we are from Portugal), which requires subtitles. Now, as you know, there multiple subtitle versions for the same language for the same media ( and even in that scenario some of them may not be synced which is another issue).\nObviously, I'm not willing to go through my entire media and handpick the correct subtitle version, so my friends need some way to download and select the correct subtitle for the specific media that they are watching. That is possible with that interface, however, I'm not willing to give admin access to all my friends, ergo, unfortunately, this issue becomes an inhibitor for me to use Emby.\nWith this in mind, my question is how feasible is this change?. Thanks for the clarification Luke. \nI took a quick look at the code and removed the canEdit blocking var for the Edit subtitles when building the item context menu in itemcontextmenu.js. It works for me but not sure if it's the proper way to do it...\nThanks. ",

If so, how do we know which physical path is mapped to which collection type as the Library/MediaFolders endpoint doesn't return the actual physical path (/mnt/user/Music) and the PhysicalPaths endpoint doesn't return collection mapping?\n. Confirmed that part is working, if I pass a known Emby path, I see log entry for xxx will be refreshed. I think the mapping is the main issue here, especially between docker containers, etc.. ",

Hi Luke,\nShort answer to your question, Yes.\nLong answer. I've make another example with a screen capture software to explain better the problem, including clicking in the text on the folder path:\nCreate a Library Test.\nAdd folder \"Y:\\Films\\Test 1\"\nAdd folder \"X:\\Films\"\nAdd folder \"X:\\Films\\Test 1\"\nClick in text over folder \"X:\\Films\" to check\nDelete \"X:\\Films\"\nThe app delete the folder \"X:\\Films\\Test 1\"\nYou can see this video (1:20) with the example: https://youtu.be/9Wr_4hpNM9Y\nRegards,. I cant upgrade now the server, I'll try in a few days, I'll inform you.. Hi,\nI check today this problem with version 3.2.70 and it seem work perfect. Thanks.

In the case of different naming of images, what about having an option to use whatever image found first in a folder as Primary? Preference could be given to square images as they would look better.. Here is an example of a folder with no images being retrieved:\n-rwxrwxrwx  1 dbogdanov  staff   5,6M 18 dic  2015 01 Elevator.mp3\n-rwxrwxrwx  1 dbogdanov  staff    10M 18 dic  2015 02 Gonadotropic Synthesis.mp3\n-rwxrwxrwx  1 dbogdanov  staff   6,9M 18 dic  2015 03 Subway 49.mp3\n-rwxrwxrwx  1 dbogdanov  staff   6,4M 18 dic  2015 04 Communication Off.mp3\n-rwxrwxrwx  1 dbogdanov  staff   7,4M 18 dic  2015 05 Approach On Tokyo.mp3\n-rwxrwxrwx  1 dbogdanov  staff   8,3M 18 dic  2015 06 Digital Delight.mp3\n-rwxrwxrwx  1 dbogdanov  staff   7,2M 18 dic  2015 07 Model Type A.mp3\n-rwxrwxrwx  1 dbogdanov  staff   7,6M 18 dic  2015 08 Radioactive Mist.mp3\n-rwxrwxrwx  1 dbogdanov  staff    80K 18 dic  2015 R-592113-1135831984.jpeg\n-rwxrwxrwx  1 dbogdanov  staff    61K 18 dic  2015 R-592113-1175257387.jpeg\n-rwxrwxrwx  1 dbogdanov  staff    63K 18 dic  2015 R-592113-1175257421.jpeg\n-rwxrwxrwx  1 dbogdanov  staff   8,0K 18 dic  2015 Thumbs.db\n-rwxrwxrwx  1 dbogdanov  staff   868K 18 dic  2015 iko-83-a.jpg\n-rwxrwxrwx  1 dbogdanov  staff   839K 18 dic  2015 iko-83-b.jpg\n. I guess showing a random image is better than not showing any image. The folder.jpg file should have a priority over non-standard filenames, but manually renaming those would be tedious for a large collection. If a user wants a different image from the one picked randomly (or alphabetically), she/he can rename it later, but at least some image will be shown.\nWhile picking a random image it can make sense to give priority to the ones that have a proper size.. Agreed, I am considering writing a script that would create folder.jpg selecting a random image in each folder. . ",

Yes. Hrm... Maybe this has something to do with the fact that I'm accessing my Emby server via an Apache proxy? Here's my virtualhost config.

I don't think so. I certainly never configured one.  I'll look to see if my browser is receiving any CSP headers in the morning.\nOn September 26, 2018 10:45:23 PM CDT, Luke notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nIs the proxy adding a CSP?\n-- \nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/issues/3422#issuecomment-424949081\n\n-- \nSent from my Android device with K-9 Mail. Please excuse my brevity.. No. I'm not seeing any CSP headers in any of the requests from browser to apache or apache to emby.. The bug does occur with the hosted app too. . I seem to be having some trouble with ffmpeg. I'll test this as soon as I can.. Testing blocked by #3470 . Yes, I still see this behavior at app.emby.media via Firefox and Chrome on Windows 10. I'll test under Linux in the morning. Still happening in Linux as well.. Sorry about the delay. Been really busy with work lately. I just tried it with the latest version available in the Arch Linux repos (v4.0.2.0). I can still reproduce this behavior. However, it did not occur when I changed subtitle tracks this time. I think it's because the video didn't stop, then start again like it usually did. I'll do more testing over the next few days, and see if I can narrow anything down more on my end. The action I took to trigger this behavior this time was to change the streaming quality. The file I used to test with only has one audio track, so I wasn't able to test that yet.. @softworkz No. This is the packaged version from the Arch Linux repos.\n@LukePulverenti Yup, that was it. I'm really surprised that didn't come up in my search results while I was trouble-shooting this issue. Thanks!. ",
    "kdschlosser": "OK so I was a little bored today. and I started mapping out the JSON structure from the API and this is what I have come up with thus far.\nI set it up as explained above. I have not yet added any examples of use for anything.\nbefore each element name I have placed the conditions that have to be met before that element will be returned. If there is a Type= in the condition this simply means this is the media type(s) you need to query for whether it be an enumeration request or a direct request. if you need to supply a field name in the Fields parameter as wee that is also noted in it. If there are any other conditions they have to be fulfilled as well. I did fond out that the API for the most part is set up so that if an object does not exist for that element it will not add the element to the returned data. There are exceptions to this but not many and those will return a null if the object does not exist. I also included the data type for the object that is returned for that element. The structure will be exactly as you see it. the nesting specifically. If you do not meet the conditions of an element that element will not be in the returned JSON data structure.\nEnumerations are pretty much the same thing as this whole structure with a condensed amount of information in it and there can be multiple structures in an enumeration array.\nThis is still not complete and I am continuing to read through the code to try and locate more elements that need to be added. If there is something missing and or incorrect please let me know.

I figured it was from an API change. to keep it more in form with the API should there be a Fields argument addition to include GenreItems that would return just the GenreItems? The same thing would also apply to any other changes of the like. To keep it in form with the API? because of how the API works where it will not return that fields if there is no contents to that field one could interpret the field not being there as there is no data. instead of it being thought of as an incorrect field name. the API does not bump back an error if a field is included that does not exist, and or the conditions have not been met to be able to return data. It simply does not return it. \nDue to the documentation not containing all of the available API commands and what conditions have to be met to get specific pieces of data returned it can leave someone guessing. \nI do not know if you get where I am coming from with this. It can draw a big question mark as to whether or not a call is correct or if there is simply no data to be returned. \nThis is a hard thing to deal with at this stage in the development of Emby because it can breaks apps that currently use the API but may not have a call correct if you all of a sudden start throwing errors for an improper call. or if you change the API to return a value of NULL if there is no data to be had. So getting together a complete list of every parameter/condition for each data set and making it available I think would be the best solution. it doesn't have to be a full on write up of each and every single bit. something like what i have outlined above would be sufficient i think. But also explain the fact that if there is no data for that field item it will not be returned. and if there is an improper field item it will react in the same manner.\nI sat there scratching my head wondering as to why when i was using the API and not getting the data returned and in the web front end it was showing the data that i was trying to get. LOL Then for hoots and ha ha's i decided to use Genres instead of GenreItems. I had gotten the GenreItems data set name from reading one of the other API connectors code. . ",

I mean, they are compiled against glibc, and my machine uses musl in place of glibc.\nThat is why I want to compile it myself.\nI am sure the binaries I pulled out of the Debian package are functional for an aarch64 system with the more conventional glibc.. I'm sorry. I believe I am wrong.\nYour binaries are compiled from c#?. Further investigation shows that it still utilizes glibc in system calls.. Most likely I cannot compile these binaries on my pi either due to the environmental complexity of c# compilation.\nWould you like me to close this issue?. Thank you for looking into this.. ",

    "benkap": "Hi, I don't know what is the logic behind it since i have old movies which this issue doesn't happen (TMDB ID is empty or with a valid ID) and i have recently added movies (past 2-3 weeks) which has '0' (Zero) in the TMDB ID section (and NFO) and vice versa (old with zero and new with empty/valid id).\nSo the answer is yes new added movies get's TMDB ID zero but not all of them, and i don't know on what condition this happen.. That's integrating havn't thought about it.. It's possible since i had other app for metadata...\nI now did the following:\n\nOn the newest movie I have added: I've check the movie directory - All files where owned by emby user and group except the .mkv and .nfo which where owned by root user. But this movie did not have this problem, It had a tmdb ID (as opposed to empty/zero ID where other providers ID are found). So that's not a good movie example but looks like you are right that other apps may add the .nfo data...\nI've located the next newest movie added that DID had <tmdbid>0</tmdbid> in it's NFO file (The movie added Jan  4 \"Jarhead (2005)\"). This time all files in the movie directory were owned by emby user and group (including .mkv and .nfo files).\nI've deleted the NFO file and immediately refreshed metadata from the UI with replace all metadata option on this movie. \nIn the new NFO file (verified by 'create time') there was still  <tmdbid>0</tmdbid> section in it. \n\nI hope that's help. Let me know if i can add more information. . Ok I identify manually 160 items (took a while) and confirmed that the issue cannot reproduce. I suspect (like you suggested) that this happened due to a combination of 1. Another app adding NFO files and 2. Filesystem level permissions that denied emby user access.\nThanks!. ",

These subtitles are downloaded from the internet, some translation team will insert some extra information such as team member info and some ads at the beginning of SRT file. However, the time of this extra info does not start at 00:00, which cause this ordering problem.\nI solved this by writing a python script to preprocess these files manually,  but I think it would be better if this procedure can be done by Emby.\nMaybe this feature can be implemented as an advanced option in subtitle menu?
