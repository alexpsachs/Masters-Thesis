    "fguillot": "Now, you can change the assignee directly from the board (available only in the master branch).\nThanks for the feedback.\n. Good idea, added on the todo list.\n. Hi,\nAutomatic actions are available is the last release of Kanboard.\nMore information here:\n- http://kanboard.net/documentation/automatic-actions\n- http://kanboard.net/news#2014-03-15\nThanks for your suggestion, it was a very good idea :)\n. @pcros With the last version of Kanboard, you can assign a specific color to a specific user. To do that, you have to use the \"automatic actions\". See http://kanboard.net/documentation/automatic-actions\nLater it will be possible to add more colors, probably something similar to Github Issues...\n. I have to improve the code first to allow multiple authentication backend. But it's definitively a good idea.\n. I will probably implement external authentication for the next release of Kanboard.\nI plan to have those providers for the first version:\n- Internal LDAP server\n- Google\n- Github\n- Microsoft\nIf you need other providers, just tell me.\n. I implemented the LDAP authentication in master: http://kanboard.net/documentation/ldap-authentication\nI will also add Google later.\n. Google authentication is now supported: http://kanboard.net/documentation/google-authentication\n. I have never used Novell eDirectory, to implement this behaviour I need to simulate that on my development environment (at least reproduce a similar environment with OpenLdap because Novell eDirectory is not free).\n- What is exactly the purpose of the Proxy User?\n- Do you know another open source project compatible with your setup? (maybe I can see an example of their implementation to help me).\nIl y a pas de forum en fran\u00e7ais mais tu peux \u00e9crire ici en fran\u00e7ais quand m\u00eame.\n. The LDAP connection will be improved later to be more flexible. Just be patient :)\n. The LDAP support have been improved since the creation of this ticket. There is now a specific user for authentication (proxy user) and the full name and the email address are fetched automatically at user creation. (see the doc for more details).\nPlease open a separate ticket for different issues thanks.\n. @ryebread157 Hi buddy, I just improved again the LDAP auth, this time I hope to satisfy everybody.\nNow you got 3 different ways to bind to the LDAP server: \"anonymous\", \"proxy user\" and \"user\". If you don't want a proxy user and a clear password use the last method \"user\" for ActiveDirectory. There is 2 examples in the documentation https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/ldap-authentication.markdown\n. I removed the possibility to change the project for a task to avoid this bug.\nI will add later a better way to move a task to another project.\nThanks for reporting this issue.\n. The software is not really made for that initially. That will occurs too many change. I prefer to keep the software very simple.\nThank you for your understanding.. Thanks, I fixed the different issues from your diff.\nI'm just curious, what tool did you use to do the automated code review?\n. Cool, I have to test that, thanks again :)\n. Definitively a good idea, added on the todo list.\n. I added a \"kiosk mode\", technically it's just a link protected by a random token.\n- Each link is unique for each project.\n- This link display a page with the board in read-only mode. \n- By default, the page auto-refresh is set to every 60 seconds, that value can be changed by a PHP constant for now.\n- There is no need to be authenticated or to create a specific user for that.\n- The link is displayed in the \"project\" menu page.\nThis change is available only in the branch master at this time.\n. Yes, it will be possible later.\n. I pushed an update in the development version, now you can define users access by project.\n- If a project doesn't have any assigned users, everybody have access\n- If a project have specific users assigned, only those users are allowed\n- Administrators have access to everything\n. I don't understand exactly what you means... Yes, a closed task is hidden from the board, but what the issue? Do you have a suggestion to improve that?\nYou can answer in french if you want (and thanks for the feedback).\n. J'ai ajout\u00e9 une page qui affiche la liste des t\u00e2ches compl\u00e9t\u00e9es, pour le moment c'est assez basique il y a juste un tableau tri\u00e9 par date de cl\u00f4ture. Plus tard, je rajouterais la possibilit\u00e9 de trier par colonne et de splitter les r\u00e9sultats sur plusieurs pages. Et le lien est affich\u00e9 en haut \u00e0 droite du board.\nPour le moment c'est dispo uniquement dans la branche master.\n. Bonne id\u00e9e, c'est ajouter dans ma todo list.\n. Salut,\nDans la derni\u00e8re version de Kanboard c'est d\u00e9sormais possible gr\u00e2ce aux actions automatis\u00e9es.\nTu peux par exemple assigner automatiquement une t\u00e2che \u00e0 l'utilisateur connect\u00e9 lorsqu'une t\u00e2che a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9plac\u00e9e dans la colonne \"Work in progress\". Tout cela est configurable.\nPlus d'informations ici:\n- http://kanboard.net/documentation/automatic-actions\n- http://kanboard.net/news#2014-03-15\nMerci du retour :)\n. Thanks for the contribution, it's merged :)\n. Thanks for the contribution, pull-request merged :)\n. I forgot \"mbstring\", I changed the requirements, now this extension is checked by the check_setup.php file and the README is updated.\nThanks for reporting this issue :)\n. merged, thanks again :)\n. Salut,\nJe viens d'ajouter la possibilit\u00e9 de sp\u00e9cifier un score pour chaque t\u00e2che (complexit\u00e9/story points). La complexit\u00e9 est affich\u00e9e en haut \u00e0 droite. C'est disponible uniquement dans la version de d\u00e9veloppement pour moment (branche master).\nJe vais probablement rajouter \u00e9galement un champ pour mettre un estim\u00e9 en temps.\nMerci pour le retour :)\n. Thanks for the contribution, it's merged in master :)\n. Salut,\nIl y avait bien un probl\u00e8me, la checkbox \u00e9tait toujours cach\u00e9e... D\u00e9sormais c'est corrig\u00e9 dans la branche master.\nMaintenant la checkbox \"administrateur\" devrait appara\u00eetre dans la page de modification d'un utilisateur.\nMerci d'avoir rapporter le probl\u00e8me.\n. Salut,\nJe viens de corriger le probl\u00e8me directement dans le syst\u00e8me de traduction pour \u00e7a fonctionne pour tous les appels de la fonction t().\nMerci encore pour avoir rapport\u00e9 le probl\u00e8me.\n. I added a \"RememberMe\" feature in the branch master.\nThanks.\n. There is currently a bug about the session timeout. It will be fixed on the ticket #217. I didn't got enough time to fix that yet, should be done soon.\n. Yep, It can be interesting to have that on the board.\n. @lparcq I added a filter by assignee on the board (only for the branch master).\n@rlemerlus I keep your idea, but I close this ticket.\n. Yes it's planned, at least on tablets like iPad or Nexus.\nBut at this time, I didn't find yet a proper solution to use the HTML5 drag and drop on touch devices.\n. Should work now with the development version. At least on Android tablets and iPad, no idea if that work with Microsoft Surface.\nYou can open a new ticket if there is some issue.\nThanks.\n. Pour le moment, non ce n'est pas possible il faudrait modifier la structure de la base de donn\u00e9es. Peut-\u00eatre pour les prochaines versions.\n. Duplicate of #85 \n. It's a feature of PHP 5.4 and it's clean.\nInstead of using <?php echo, I use <?=.\nFor PHP < 5.4, yes you have to enable short_tag, but <?= is always available for PHP >= 5.4.\n. Qu'est-ce que veux dire par un \"filtre sur les dates\" ? La possibilit\u00e9 de faire une recherche par date ?\nMais oui, c'est une fonctionnalit\u00e9 qui va \u00eatre ajout\u00e9 en plus d'un champ \"estimation\". Ces champs seront facultatifs.\n. Il y a d\u00e9sormais un champ \"Date d'\u00e9ch\u00e9ance\" dans la version de d\u00e9veloppement.\nJ'ajouterais les filtres un peu plus tard.\n. Il y a maintenant un filtre par date en plus d'un filtre par utilisateur sur le tableau. Pour l'instant, il n'y a pas de trie sur les dates, \u00e7a cache les taches qui n'ont pas de date.\nPour le bug sur les mois, ca devrait \u00eatre corrige sinon ouvre un nouveau ticket.\n. Je ne pense pas que je vais offrir la possibilit\u00e9 de restaurer la base de donn\u00e9es depuis l'interface. Je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re que se soit une intervention manuelle. De plus, plus tard je pense que j'offrirais la possibilit\u00e9 d'utiliser Mysql donc pour la restauration automatique c'est un peu plus d\u00e9licat.\nDe toute mani\u00e8re cela reste quand m\u00eame assez simple, un copier/coller de db.sqlite et c'est termin\u00e9.\nPlus d'infos ici: http://kanboard.net/documentation/sqlite-database\n. Qu'est-ce que tu veux en fait dans ton rapport au final ?\nUn truc de ce genre l\u00e0 : Date ; T\u00e2che ; ColonneAvant ; ColonneApr\u00e8s \nou encore Date ; T\u00e2che ; Nom de la colonne \u00e0 cette date\nJe pense que ce sera plus clair si tu donnes un exemple.\n. In the current development branch the task transitions are recorded in the database, you can export this data in CSV.\nBasically you got:\n- Task id\n- Task title\n- Source column\n- Destination column\n- Executer, the person that move the task\n- Date\n- Time spent in the origin column\nIt's also available in the task view. I think that fits your needs.\n. Merci :)\n. C'est d\u00e9sormais disponible dans la version de d\u00e9veloppement.\nMerci pour la suggestion :)\n. Thanks :)\n. Yes, I will add that for the next release.\n. Hi,\nIn the current development version, you can now reorder the column position for boards.\nThanks for the feedback.\n. I will make a new website soon with a better documentation.\nThe documentation source files will be available in Markdown format and anyone will be able to contribute.\n. Hi,\nI start to write some documentation, it's available here: http://kanboard.net/documentation\nThe syntax guide is available here: http://kanboard.net/documentation/syntax-guide\nThanks for the suggestion.\n. I merged #36, \"Story Points\" for me is like \"complexity\"/\"score\"/\"difficulty\".\n. It's done in the development version.\nWhen you click on the task number you go to the \"edit task\" page.\nWhen you click on task you go to the \"show task\" page.\n. Yep, it's already asked by someone else (see #22), It will be added soon.\n. There is a filter by assignee now on the board (branch master). It's pretty basic right now but it will be improved later.\n. Thanks, I merged your pull-request and made some improvements.\n. I just tried with Firefox 27, and it seems to work for me.\nDo you have any error messages or php errors?\nCan you try with the online demo to see if the problem come from your installation or something else, http://demo.kanboard.net/ and demo/demo123\nThanks.\n. Yes you are right, so I merged your pull-request. I improved my unit test but it's not entirely done, I don't cover all cases. I also need to improve the DnD...\nI close this issue because you finally found the problem.\n. thanks\n. thanks\n. D'apr\u00e8s le message d'erreur c'est le serveur apache qui crash. Je vois pas vraiment d'o\u00f9 cela pourrait venir.\nEst-ce que d'autres applications web en php fonctionne dessus ou c'est seulement kanboard qui pose probl\u00e8me ?\n. Du coup, \u00e7a fonctionne en d\u00e9sactivant eaccelerator ?\n. Je n'utilise pas eAccelerator mais la derni\u00e8re version de PHP 5.5 qui est livr\u00e9e directement avec un cache d'opcode. D'ailleurs le projet eAccelerator semble \u00eatre abandonn\u00e9, il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 jour depuis 2012.\nSinon j'ai cr\u00e9\u00e9 une entr\u00e9e dans la FAQ du site de web des fois que quelqu'un d'autre aurait le m\u00eame probl\u00e8me : http://kanboard.net/faq/issues-eaccelerator.\nEn tout cas, merci d'avoir rapport\u00e9 le probl\u00e8me.\n. LDAP support have been implemented in the branch master.\n. Kanboard utilise des transactions au niveau de la base de donn\u00e9es, une seule op\u00e9ration est effectu\u00e9e \u00e0 la fois.\nPar exemple, si un utilisateur d\u00e9place une t\u00e2che dans une colonne et que quelqu'un d'autre d\u00e9place la m\u00eame t\u00e2che dans une colonne diff\u00e9rente, le logiciel va enregistrer la position du premier mouvement et ensuite la position de second mouvement. Ce qui fait qu'au final on verra la t\u00e2che \u00e0 la position du dernier mouvement.\nLa chose qui pourrait \u00eatre am\u00e9liorer est de rafraichir le tableau automatiquement lorsqu'une autre personne fait une action.\nCependant dans les fait c'est quand m\u00eame rare de voir deux humains faire la m\u00eame action \u00e0 la m\u00eame milli-seconde.\n. Yes, I am working on that, for the next release I will add a \"automatic actions\" feature for projects. And you can define scenarios like that:\nWhen a task is moved to a specific column you can define an action:\n- Close this task\n- Assign to a specific user\n- Assign to the logged user\n- Move to another project\n- Probably more...\nAvailable soon :)\n. Hi,\nIt's now possible in the last release of Kanboard with automatic actions. Later, I will add a new button to duplicate a task to another project manually.\nMore information here:\n- http://kanboard.net/documentation/automatic-actions\n- http://kanboard.net/news#2014-03-15\nThanks for the feedback :)\n. Thanks :)\n. I like the idea.\nAre you agree if I add a new entry in the FAQ of kanboard (http://kanboard.net/faq), I mean a link to your project to tell people how to migrate from Wunderlist?\n. I added the entry here: http://kanboard.net/faq/wunderlist-import\nIt can be useful for someone else...\nThanks\n. Yes, I will add an \"import feature\" directly inside Kanboard but not now. I prefer to focus on adding the missing features asked by people, have a clean and robust code base and after that I will add feature like that: import from Trello, Wunderlist or whatever...\n. Can you tell me which version of PHP are you using? \nIf you use PHP < 5.4, do you have \"magic quotes\" enabled?\nThanks\n. I added a check to make sure that magic_quotes are disabled in the development version.\nThanks for reporting the issue :)\n. Thanks, merged in master.\n. The issue come from the password_compat library (the file vendor/password.php). It doesn't works correctly with PHP 5.3.3.\nI think I will setup a virtual machine with debian 6 to test and fix that.\n. I reverted the previous version of password_compat and it seems to works fine with Debian 6.\nYou can try with the branch master: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/archive/master.zip\n. Je viens de rajouter dans la version de d\u00e9veloppement la possibilit\u00e9 de modifier et supprimer des commentaires pour les auteurs et les admins qui eux ont acc\u00e8s \u00e0 tout.\n. - Dans la version de d\u00e9veloppement, j'ai ajout\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de dupliquer une t\u00e2che : dans la vue pour visualiser une t\u00e2che cliquer sur le lien \"Dupliquer\". Le formulaire est alors pr\u00e9-rempli...\n- La checkbox a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sactiv\u00e9e dans la page de modification. Par contre dans le formulaire de cr\u00e9ation elle sera am\u00e9liorer pour reprendre tous les champs de la tache pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente.\n. Je pensais \u00e0 une autre m\u00e9thode, ajouter la possibilit\u00e9 de dupliquer un projet avec les t\u00e2ches et actions automatiques.\nExemple:\n- Tu cr\u00e9\u00e9 un projet mod\u00e8le (un template) pour ton plan de test avec les t\u00e2ches/colonnes qui vont bien\n- Pour commencer une nouvelle s\u00e9rie de tests, tu duplique le projet et t'as un tableau \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat initial\n- Une fois termin\u00e9, tu peux supprimer le projet dupliqu\u00e9\n. Did you use one category per task or many categories can be defined for a single task? maybe tags are better?\n. Categories support have been added to the development version.\n- Each project have is own list of categories\n- Each task can be assigned to a category (optional)\n- A category can be assigned to a specific color with automatic actions (see https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/automatic-actions.markdown#i-want-to-assign-a-specific-color-to-the-category-feature-request)\n- On the board, people can apply a filter by category\n. Est-ce que tu aurais install\u00e9 kanboard sur un serveur windows avec la version fran\u00e7aise activ\u00e9e ? car il y eu un autre bug corrig\u00e9 par rapport \u00e0 cela https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/issues/68\nSi c'est le cas, tu peux essayer la derni\u00e8re version de master pour voir si \u00e7a corrige le probl\u00e8me. Sinon il me faut plus de d\u00e9tails sur l'installation (version de php/distrib linux...) pour pouvoir reproduire le probl\u00e8me.\nMerci.\n. J'arrive pas \u00e0 reproduire le bug...\n. In the development branch, regular users can create private projects (for now they can't manage user access).\n. Kanboard use Parsedown now, so the syntax ~~blah~~ is supported.\nI was waiting the support of HTML escaping in Parsedown to be able to use that in Kanboard (https://github.com/erusev/parsedown/commit/0a3fde3774ee7d53c5a2476688cef49f0faccff3)\n. I don't see how it can be implemented without changing the data model. The column_id, position, swimlane_id of tasks are unique to each project.\n. Closing this ticket because that will require too much changes.\n. I already think about that, but I just started to explore different approach to refresh the boards for multiple users in the same time. I'm looking for a technology simple to setup and reliable.\nBy example, it can be:\n- A stupid ajax polling than check the board every 30 seconds (works everywhere but not efficient)\n- Use server-side events javascript api (I didn't test with PHP, not sure if it's reliable)\n- Use websockets (need a separate program and require more configuration on the server)\nThe process is simple, when someone move a task, every connected users get a notification to refresh their board. And the client refresh only the necessary parts.\nI will be done, sure because I also don't like to refresh manually the board :)\n. It's implemented in the development version.\nI choose the Ajax polling version, every 10 seconds the board is updated when necessary. So if you open 2 different browsers on the same board and move a task, you should see the change inside the other window.\nThe board status is checked only if the tab is visible and only the board is updated not the whole page.\n. I will probably add a \"popup/overlay\" system for task editing, it's not too hard to implement and it will improve the usability. I want to keep the software simple, the goal is not to have a clone of Jira...\n. Now we have popover and many tooltips on the board. I think it's good enough right now, I would like to avoid adding to much complexity in the current code.\n. I close this ticket because I merged your pull request to have the label \"nobody\" less visible.\n. examples? Do you mean the top menu is lowercase and everything else is not? If you are talking about that, hum.. yes it's my sense of design, I know it sucks :)\n. I changed the case of text for the top menu.\n. Merged in master, I just changed a little bit the css...\nThanks.\n. J'ai fais quelques changements dans la branche master, cependant j'ai pas de windows sous la main, si tu pouvais tester et me dire si \u00e7a fonctionne \u00e7a sera cool :)\n. For that, I will allow to enter multiple date format (the localized format and the iso 8601 format with dash, underscore or nothing), so everybody will be happy :)\n. It's done in master.\nYou can now enter 3 date formats:\n- The localized format: 04/27/2014 (en_US)\n- The ISO8601 format: 2014-04-27 or 2014_04_27\n. Now, there is a public view for tasks in master.\n. I merged your pull-request. Thanks you very much, your are 100% right, I didn't catch that when I merged the comment pull-request...\n. I fixed the mysql schema in the same time: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/schemas/mysql.php#L132\n. For a first version, emails notification will be implemented like that:\n- Each user can choose to receive or not emails\n- You can select all projects or only some projects\n- An email is sent when something change for a task (position, new comment, new subtask...)\n- @poikilotherm I will probably use Swiftmailer for that\n. It's not very hard, I added a basic command line interface for kanboard. I can add a new command by example kanboard check-due-tasks and ask people to run that from a daily cronjob.\nhttp://kanboard.net/documentation/cli\n. @MaorBril probably a couple of weeks because I'm traveling a lot during this summer.\n. Email notifications are finally there, it's available in the development version.\nNotifications are sent on many events:\n- Task creation/modification/open/close\n- Comment creation/modification\n- Subtask creation/modification\n- New attachments\n- Due tasks\nNotifications must be activated on the settings page for each user, it's also possible to select only some projects.\n- The documentation for email configuration is there http://kanboard.net/documentation/email-configuration\n- For people who wants the cronjob for the due tasks: http://kanboard.net/documentation/cli\nIf you spot any bugs, don't hesitate to open a new ticket.\n. @marcosaccioly Now you can do it with the last version of master https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/email-configuration.markdown#how-to-display-a-link-to-the-task-in-notifications\n. Thanks you very much for your contribution, I merged your pull-request :)\n. Thanks :)\n. I added a css3 animation for that, after 7s the notification fade out. I'm not an expert in css3 but that seems to work.\n. I was a bug, It was my fault I break something in the code, it should be fixed in master.\n. I added icons for comments and description on the board. That provide a visual distinction for tasks without description or comments and it's easy to implement for me.\n. Should be fixed by the patch of @kiswa.\n. You just have to follow the documentation: http://kanboard.net/documentation/update (Uncompress the zip file and copy the file db.sqlite to the directory data of the new version).\n. I checked again the migration between the version 1.0.3 to 1.0.4 and that seems to work fine for me.\nHave you checked if the database file (db.sqlite) is writable after the copy?\n. What was the strange results? Because actually Kanboard doesn't use any caching system.\n. For the second point, it's normal board auto refresh across different windows/users are not yet implemented. It will be the case in future release.\nHowever, the software is not fully tested with Windows servers, apparently there is a lot of small issues like dates are not displayed correctly...\n. I added the \"no caches http headers\" in the development version. Should work better now.\n. Yes, the \"Remember Me\" is an auto-login feature, if the session is expired and you have checked the box before your are logged automatically. But if you click on \"logout\" explicitly, all cookies and session are flushed.\n. I like the idea of subtasks, each subtask can be assigned to a different person...\n. I'm ok to add this feature but I don't want to include any breaking changes.\nSo here a possible solution similar to the one above:\n- A task can have several participants/collaborators/members in addition to the current assignee system\n- Add a new table \"task_has_members\"\n- Add a new shortcut menu to add quickly a new member to the task from the board\n- From the task details, add a new page to add/remove members\n- Display on the board the number of members for each task with a tooltip on mouseover that list all members\n- Update board filters\n- Update notifications\n. The main reason that this feature is not yet developed is because the data model need to be modified. Actually the assignee is stored in the tasks table with a column owner_id (which is poorly named) and the best approach is probably to have a separate table for all assignees. That will require a lot of code refactoring, it's possible but takes time.\n. With the development version, you can pre-link oauth2 accounts if you know the Google or Github unique id of the user. The form is available in the user profile > Edit authentication.\n. With the last dev version you can disable the login form for specific users (edit profile).\n. done\n. Yes, sub tasks will be implemented.\n. Sub-tasks have been added in the development version.\n. Actually, there is nothing to remove a task. You are right, it's a missing feature, I will add that soon.\n. It's done in the master branch.\n. Good idea, merged.\n. Good idea, I will implement that.\n. Task links are in master now.\n. I made some changes in master, that should work. Remove all automatic actions for your project to be sure there is no conflicts between previous tests and create a new automatic action.\nThe best way to change the color for all your tasks for a given categories in the same time is to do that:\n- Choose the event: \"Task creation or modification\"\n- Choose the action: \"Assign a color to a specific category\"\n- Choose the color and the category\n- Do that for each category\nAfter that, go back to the board:\n- If your tasks already have the category assigned, just move one task on the board and all tasks should have the right color.\n- If you create a new task without choosing a color, the right color should be set automatically after saving the task.\n. hum, I understand now :) I will add a new action to do the opposite.\n. I pushed another update, now there is both actions and I changed the label to be more explicit:\n- Assigner automatiquement une couleur par rapport \u00e0 une cat\u00e9gorie d\u00e9finie\n- Assigner automatiquement une cat\u00e9gorie par rapport \u00e0 une couleur d\u00e9finie\n. I merged your pull-request.\nI also added at the bottom some missing translations for the current development version: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/app/Locales/de_DE/translations.php#L310\nThanks for your contribution :)\n. Yes it's a known issue.\nActually in the development version, the board is refreshed every 10 seconds by an Ajax request. If 2 people move a tasks almost in the same time (inside the 10s timeframe), the last change will be seen by everybody.\nI have to come up with a better solution, probably using Websockets to have something more real-time.\n. Websockets are definitely the best approach, I didn't start to work on it. I'm not sure that PHP is the best programming language for that. I would probably use a websocket server in Golang that act as \"notification bus\". In any case, a proof of concept have to be done before.\n. There is a date picker now in the master branch (patch of @kiswa).\n. Do you have the last development version? because it was an issue I introduced recently with Firefox. \nBut it should be fixed now, be sure the javascript and css are not cached in your browser.\n. Salut, tu peux me d\u00e9crire ton installation que je vois si je peux am\u00e9liorer \u00e7a, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 pouvoir reproduire ton probl\u00e8me ? (syst\u00e8me d'exploitation, version de php, h\u00e9bergeur...). merci du retour.\n. Un autre contributeur aurait trouv\u00e9 le probl\u00e8me, \u00e7a serait le session.auto_start qui est \u00e0 On. D\u00e9sormais Kanboard prend en compte ce cas et \u00e7a devrait fonctionner sans rien modifier (en supposant que se soit bien cela).\n. The priority is defined by the position on the board, tasks on the top are more important. For me, it's good enough, the software have to be simple.\n. Story points are used for people that want to follow a simplified Scrum methodology. Each task represent a story, and the story point is the complexity for each task. It's just a number, people use often the Fibonacci sequence.\n. This feature is now implemented in the development branch: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/board-show-hide-columns.markdown\n. Project cloning is now done.\n. Swimlanes have been implemented few days ago. It's under testing in the development branch.\n. This behaviour have been changed in the current development branch. Now by default all projects are private and you have to allow the public access manually.\n. I don't get the benefit to have your tasks in a calendar? might be useful only for tasks with a due date? Do you have some usage example?\n. I wrote a very quick prototype to estimate the complexity of that (branch ical).\n- For me, the easiest solution is to generate *.ics calendar events, seems to works well with Apple Calendar or any compatible calendar software.\n- The full Caldav server solution with http://sabre.io/dav/ is more complex and include a huge dependency. There are all features available, multiple users/calendars and read/write...\nSo having a read-only calendar for each user and each project should not be very hard. Those public endpoint can be protected by a token like feeds or public boards.\n. iCal feeds are now available in the development branch. You can synchronize your Kanboard calendars with almost any calendar programs Outlook, Apple Calendar + iOS, Google Calendar + Android...\nMore info here: http://kanboard.net/documentation/ical\nNote: I'm currently testing this feature...\n. I will review that this week, I'm on vacation don't worry :)\n. I have done a quick review and I have some minor concerns:\n- Use a more explicit class name for \"div-add\", by example \"board-add-icon\"\n- You can include the CSS for jquery-ui directly in the layout not in the middle of the template\n- When you change the language, the date format is not necessary the same, so the date picker output a wrong date when you are in french by example. A quick solution, is maybe to tell Jquery that the output format is the iso8601.\n- Don't remove the help message in the template task_edit.php and task_new.php\nThanks. \n. Thanks, I merged your pull-request in master.\n. It should be fixed in the development version.\n. La taille des fichiers n'est pas d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par Kanboard mais par PHP lui-m\u00eame. Il faut modifier le php.ini pour augmenter la taille.\nupload_max_filesize = 20M\npost_max_size = 20M\n. I removed this check in the development branch. Should be better now.\n. According to the error message, there is a mysql user error:\nAccess denied for user 'kanboard'@'www_php.synalinq.vlan' (using password: YES)'\nMaybe a wrong username/password or wrong permissions for the user?\nThe connection should work from the command line (if you want to test outside of kanboard): mysql -u mysql-username -h mysql-hostname -p mysql-database\n. Adding the support for postgresql should be easy, I just to convert the schema... added on the long todo list :)\n. I started to implement the Postgresql support, actually it's experimental. Everything is stored in the branch postgres.\n. Finally, I merged everything in master. Don't hesitate to open a new ticket if you find a bug. Thanks.\n. You can export tasks in CSV: go to \"Project > Tasks export\".\n. For me, importing from CSV files is easier than reading Excel files. Importation can be done like that:\n1. Upload the file\n2. Select which columns to import (match csv end kanboard fields) \n3. Run the importation\n. There is now a basic CSV import for tasks in the development version.\nMore complex solution (Excel import or automated import etc..) have to be done with plugins or with an external script.\n. It's now possible in the last development version.\n. Now in the master branch, only admins can see the list of users.\n. This why I started to add a template helper to generate links and urls. Progressively, I replace hardcoded links with the helper so it will be easier to generate nice urls.\nHowever, I want this feature to be optional, I mean installing Kanboard by copying and paste the source should works without any configuration. After that, some people can choose to add .htaccess or change their nginx config to have nice urls.\nFor the urls format, I don't know yet, I will probably need to define a list of routes or find a way to call automatically the controller/action according to the url.\nExample with automatic binding to controllers:\n/controller/action/param1_name/param1_value/param2_name/param3_value\nWith some possible shortcuts like /123 to go the task #123, or /p/12 or /p/myproject to go to project #12 and /b/myproject for boards.\nExample with a \"REST style\":\n/project/123\n/project/123/board\n/project/123/tasks\n/project/123/task/456\n/task/123\nI like the idea to have very short url...\n. Url rewriting is now in the development branch, see here for the doc: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/nice-urls.markdown\nKanboard is able to work indifferently with url rewriting enabled or not.\nNote: It's very alpha at the moment.\n. Yep, I need to improve that.\n. I changed the way projects list are displayed in the development branch. There is a select box at the top now.\n. I integrated the chosen Jquery plugin and that seems pretty cool.\n. Yes, I will implement a RSS feed because I'm also author of a RSS reader :)\n. RSS feed per project is now available in the development version. You have to enable the public access for the board to get the feed link (protected by the same token).\n. Pour l'instant non...\n. I just added a new option in settings to add default categories at project creation.\n. It should be fixed in the development version.\n. thanks, merged\n. I think that will be done for the next release. And the RSS feed will use the same data.\nThe activity will be recorded for tasks/comments/subtasks... For each action, we will be able to know who have done the action and when. Example: bob commented on the task #34 or bob move the task #33 to the column \"Work in progress\"\nOptionally those data might be exported as a CSV file, by example export all tasks activity between 2 dates.\n. Project activity is now available in the development version. It's not yet perfect but it's a good start. Reporting based on that will come later.\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I understand your point but I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited.\nThank you for your understanding. All right, I think it's time to have avatars in Kanboard.\nFor a first iteration, having the possibility to upload an image and fallback to a letter-based identicon would be a good start. Letter-based avatars are the default on Google and Apple products and I assume they are better UX designer than me :)\nNow the big question is where to place the avatar on the card? the bottom left seems to be the more appropriate.\n. Avatars are now available in 1.0.27, you have the choice between:\n- Letter based avatars (default)\n- Gravatar\n- Upload an image\n- Google avatar if you have the plugin GoogleAuth\n. Kanboard is not made to support offline usage (html5 client storage). However, if you really need do to that, you can install Kanboard on your local machine and synchronize the folder data with any tool like rsync/dropbox/etc...\n. see https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/issues/129#issuecomment-136027247\n. Actually, I don't have any plan to write an Android client by myself because I never write any mobile apps. I have zero experience in that. For me, using the web interface on desktops and tablets is good enough.\nBut if you want to write an Android app by yourself, I have no problem with that. I can also improve the api if needed.\n. I agree with the responsive design on mobile device, actually it's not too bad on my smartphone in landscape mode.\nMy concern, is how to display the board in portrait?\nFor the offline mode, it's more tricky, you have to handle the fact the application is multi-users, so you need to have a \"smart\" synchronization system. Maybe the first and easy step is to have a read-only access when the device is offline.\n. How do you slide or swap from one screen to another in javascript?\n. There is now a user api if someone want to create a mobile app. This api can be extended easily.\n. You can't move a task with the webhook, you have to use the API.\nHere an example in Python to move a task (id 28) at the top of the third column :\n``` python\n!/usr/bin/env python\nimport requests\nimport json\ndef main():\n    url = \"http://demo.kanboard.net/jsonrpc.php\"\n    api_key = \"be4271664ca8169d32af49d8e1ec854edb0290bc3588a2e356275eab9505\"\n    headers = {\"content-type\": \"application/json\"}\npayload = {\n    \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n    \"method\": \"moveTaskPosition\",\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"params\": {\n        \"project_id\": 1,\n        \"task_id\": 28,\n        \"column_id\": 3,\n        \"position\": 1\n    }\n}\n\nresponse = requests.post(\n    url,\n    data=json.dumps(payload),\n    headers=headers,\n    auth=(\"jsonrpc\", api_key)\n)\n\nif response.status_code == 401:\n    print \"Authentication failed\"\nelse:\n    result = response.json()\n\n    assert result[\"result\"] == True\n    assert result[\"jsonrpc\"]\n    assert result[\"id\"] == 1\n\nif name == \"main\":\n    main()\n```\nHere it's in Python, but that can anything else PHP, Golang, NodeJS or directly cURL from a shell script.\nFor other questions, only open tasks are shown on the board. If you want to hide a task, close the task or remove the task.\nAll those actions can be automated through the API. More info here: http://kanboard.net/documentation/api-json-rpc\n. Awesome, it's merged.\n. Thanks, merged.\n. Thanks, it's merged in master.\n. I merged manually this pull-request but I didn't test yet. If something is wrong, don't hesitate to submit another pull-request.\n. Thanks, It's merged in master.\n. I tested your pull-request but I prefer a \"flat design\", it's my personal taste. So for now, I keep your pull request open in case somebody want to merge that on its own fork.\n. I merged (and modified) your pull-request in master. Thanks.\n. Merged in master.\n.

You pull-request have been merged. Now the list of languages display the native words and there is no need to translate them now.\nThanks for your contribution.\n. Maybe not :) there is a bigger textarea on \"edit description\", and that change everything :)\nFor now I will keep the both pages, can be useful later if by example I decide to have a better Acl management for user permissions...\n. In the development version, this behaviour has changed: projects are available only to selected users and regular users can create private projects/boards.\n. For the next release, the API will be improved (fix inconsistencies and better documentation).\n. I removed the values array. There is an example for each call in master.\n. Awesome! tested and merged in master.\n. I tested your pull request but I'm not sure if having tooltips is the best choice, maybe popovers are more efficient. By example for subtasks, a popover can show the same template as the task view, same for comments and description.\nI want to improve that for the next version, so I think I will do some experiments on my side. My goal is to have a \"quick edition\" mode to be more efficient. And later, having the possibility to have keyboard shortcuts...\nHere a screenshot in case someone is interested to see the pull-request:\n\n. Yes it's a bug I introduced when I added the support for Postgresql. If you spot other bugs, don't hesitate to open a ticket.\nThanks.\n. And I also pushed a fix for that.\n. Yes, I saw that. I'm thinking about refactoring the Javascript part because it's sucks.\n. I made some modification in master, error messages should be gone.\n. Merged in master, thanks :)\n. Yes, it was fixed the day they contact me. But they wait the next release of kanboard to disclose the issue.\n. Metrics will be added to Kanboard, just be patient.\nBut the first step is to define which metrics are useful...\n. Lead and cycle time is now available in the development branch.\nSee https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/analytics-tasks.markdown and https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/analytics.markdown#average-lead-and-cycle-time\nNote: It's under testing at the moment.\n. I merged the pull-request of @levlaz \n. Merged in master, thanks :)\n. I increased the max length to 255. If you need more, the database column must be changed for Mysql and Postgres. Otherwise a textarea for a long markdown description can be added.\n. I don't want to duplicate all feature of tasks to subtasks, so if you need a longer description than 255 characters, use the task description or link the task to multiple tasks.\n. I think I found the bug, the problem come from the php function strftime the %G return the wrong year so I replaced that by a %Y and that seems to be correct.\nBy the way, I pushed a fix for that in master.\nThanks for the bug report.\n. Yes, it will be possible soon. The full name will be displayed if not empty otherwise the username will be shown.\n. It's done in the development version.\n. It's done in the development version.\n.

Actually, I want to keep that simple. However, I changed some behaviour in the development branch: only selected users have access to the project and standard users can create private boards. And the public access for boards can be activated manually for each project.\n. Actually, I want to keep that simple.

I just finish this feature. It's available in master.\nI used it for the last couple of weeks and that works pretty well. It's good enough for a first version.\nMore info here: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/github-webhooks.markdown\n.

It was a bug, I changed this behaviour in the master branch:\n- The session expire until the browser is closed\n- The \"persistent connections\" are created when you check the \"Remember Me\" field. Those sessions are created for 60 days.\n- When you explicitly logout all sessions are destroyed\n. In the last development version you can move a task to another project (not yet available in automated actions but that will be). And soon, you will be able to copy a task to another project.\n. @Zayon This plugin is using the external task provider: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-github-frontend. I'm closing this ticket. I let the community develop plugins to implement such feature.. Problem solved? what php/os version?\n. I just tested Kanboard 1.0.7 and the master version with Centos 6.5 and Centos 7. Everything seems to work fine.\nSomething else is probably wrong in your setup... the official php version for Centos 6.5 is 5.3.3 and you have 5.5.15. But that should work.\nIf you use Sqlite as database, are you sure that the file is not corrupted?\nIt's hard to help with so few information.\n. Do you know if the database is created correctly?\nYou should have a file db.sqlite in your data/ directory. If this file is corrupted, try to remove it and login again.\n. Sqlite is not recommended if you use a network filesystem like NFS (many cheap shared hosting companies use that). Otherwise, use Mysql or Postgres. But usually Sqlite is not too bad, especially on VPS with SSD hard-drives.\n. Nope it's not normal, I think a process is crashing continuously on your server and those files are core dumps. But that not coming from Kanboard. Maybe PHP...\n. Many possibilities are available to implement that:\n1. If you already have a STMP server like postfix, pipe everything to a script that use the Kanboard API.\n2. That can be a cronjob that check an IMAP/POP mailbox.\n3. That can be a third-party service like Mailgun that relay incoming emails to a Webhook: http://documentation.mailgun.com/quickstart-receiving.html\nThe last solution is very easy to implement but you have to use an external provider.\nFor creating task, the email subject can be the task title and the email body the task description...\n. I implemented the easiest solution in the master branch: integration with third-party services. You have the choice between 3 SMTP providers: Sendgrid, Mailgun and Postmark.\nMore information here:\n- http://kanboard.net/documentation/create-tasks-by-email\n- http://kanboard.net/documentation/mailgun\n- http://kanboard.net/documentation/sendgrid\n- http://kanboard.net/documentation/postmark\nIf you want to implement the solution 1) or 2) mentioned above, you can do that with an external script that use the API or the webhooks.\nAt the moment, this system works only for task creation. I will see later if I need to implement notifications reply or update tasks by email.\n@BlueTeck there is a library in the vendor folder to convert HTML to Markdown if you need it.\n. I just tested again with my own installation and that works for me.\n- Be sure to have the last version of master + composer install\n- Be sure the from address match the kanboard user email address\n- Be sure the recipient address match the project identifier, foobar+myproject@mypostmark.domain.tld\n- Be sure the webhook url is correct in postmark settings\n- The wehbook should send back a status code 200 OK and the body \"PARSED\"\n- In the debug log file, you should see those debug messages if the message is ignored: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/app/Integration/PostmarkWebhook.php#L32-L46\n- You can check the webhook response code in your webserver logs\n. I implemented a separate subtasks export in the development version.\n. I added the meta tag, so now we have the both methods.\n. - The plugin label means that should not be part of the core. I'm not currently working on that at the moment.\n- I add the label \"Work in progress\" when I start to work on that. Anyone can develop this plugin. The implementation can be different according to people needs.\n- The \"feature request\" label means that someone is interested by this feature. I leave it open to see if other people are interested.\n. Closing due to inactivity or lack of interest from the community.. The board definitively need to be improved to handle a lot of tasks.\n. I will fix that in the next couple of days by changing the way how the board is updated. Just be patient.\n. I just changed this behaviour in the master branch. Now, only the position of the selected task is sent over the network. Refactoring that, also allow to expose a task move through the Api.\nI tested quickly with 2000 tasks on the board and that work for me, however the speed depend of the client (javascript code) and the server (db operations). But there is a lot of room for performances improvements.\n. In the development version, now you can change the category directly from the board like the assignee.\n. Duplicate with #3 \n. Something similar is done in master now. There is a public view for tasks (read only). The task url use the project token...\n@moraxy thanks for helping people.\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I understand your point but I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited.\nThank you for your understanding. Merged manually in master.\nThanks.\n. @timjcraig I agree with the feature request but there is so much stuff to improve before, I will see how to implement that.\n. Basically, the feature is accessible programmatically for plugins but there is no user interface at the moment.\n. I just merged a pull-request about that: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/pull/487\n. With the last development version, it's possible to choose the sorting direction for comments.\n. Kanboard can run with Docker now: http://kanboard.net/documentation/docker\n. Yes, it's a bug.\n. I pushed a fix in master, should be better now.\n. I hope it's fixed now. I close this ticket.\n. If you are talking about column sorting it's available since your posted this message.\n. Duplicate with #426 \n. Now, there is a dashboard for that.\n. Merged, thanks.\n. I modified and merged your pull-request, changes are:\n- Fix and add more unit tests\n- Application default columns are always displayed in the form as indication for the user\n- Default columns are not in the database schema\n- Empty column name are ignored (if the user place a comma at the end by example)\n- Add French translations\n@moraxy fyi the class Config doesn't parse the config file, that only read the database, this file is just included here https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/app/common.php#L26\n. Because I didn't develop the feature yet. That will be available later. I'm also thinking about a timesheet integration...\nJust be patient :)\n. The time estimated and the time spent are now available in the development branch.\n. Finally I don't need that right now.\n. Unfortunately, you can't do that, there is no restriction when you move task.\n. How did you create a restriction?\n. Awesome :)\n. It's merged in the development version. Thanks!\n. Should be fixed now. Thanks to report that.\n. Merged, thanks.\n. There are many ways to implement tags, I opened a new issue concerning the implementation in the user interface #2331 \n. Tags are now available in the development branch.\n. Merged, thanks.\n. I remember now why It was commented, the behaviour is not the same across database drivers. With Sqlite I got true as result and with MariaDb I got false because the data are the same.\nAnd after reading the official php doc http://php.net/manual/en/pdostatement.rowcount.php\n\nthis behaviour is not guaranteed for all databases and should not be relied on for portable applications.\n\nSo it's probably better to not use rowCount(). I will do more tests and fix that.\n. It should be fixed now.\nI removed the rowCount() call for the method update() but I keep it for the remove(). Moreover, I run the unit tests across the different database types: sqlite, mysql and postgres. The test coverages is very far to cover everything but it's a good start.\n. Merged manually. Thanks.\n. Merged, thanks.\n. It's fixed in master. Thanks to report that :)\n. What Kanboard version? What environment? Apache/nginx/php/OS version.. ? The error is returned by which software Apache?\n. Editing a task is the only thing that doesn't work?\nCan you explain how you setup Kanboard? did you configure something specific?\n. It's weird, the error come from Apache and everything else works. Task edit from the board work but not from the task view.\nDo you have any errors in Apache logs? Do you have some specific security features enabled on your Apache? What Linux distribution is it?\n. You can also try with the development version just in case: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/archive/master.zip\n. Do you have mod_security enabled?\n. Ok cool.\nI removed the message with the user/password.\n. Actually it's not yet available but that would be a good idea. At least, allow regular user to remove only their own task. \n. I pushed an update in the development branch, admin can remove all tasks but regular users can remove only their own tasks.\n. I merged your pull-request. Thanks :)\n. I just write a quick summary here: http://kanboard.net/documentation/tests\n. Your hosting company use a custom PHP setup according to the error message: proc_open() has been disabled for security reasons.\nYou can try yo use another mail transport...\n. I kept your idea but I changed your patch.\n- Functions from the namespace Helper should be used only in templates.\n- Notifications can be sent from a script in command line or with an API call, there is not always a session opened.\nAnyway, this pull-request is considered merged.\n. Task attachments are stored in the data folder (uploaded files by users).\n. Doc updated in master. Thanks.\n. I planned to add Github webhooks to implement the ticket #211. Gitlab will be probably similar.\nI didn't get enough time to write some doc about contributing, some many improvements have to be done...\nBut it shouldn't be too hard, add a couples of public methods to the Webhook controller, parse the incoming payload and perform an action with that.\n. If you want to have a public action (available from outside with no authentication) just add your controller/action in the ACL class: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/app/Model/Acl.php#L19-L24\nIf have time this week, I will write an example for Github Webhooks. And after, maybe add some automatic actions do be able to do something like that:\n- When a commit is received from Github close the task / move the task to another column\n- When a new issue is open on Github create a new issue in that column\n- When a Github issue labeled X assign the category Y\n- Etc...\n. I wrote a basic prototype in master to handle Github Webhooks. Actually I just tested with push events, I'm able the close automatically a task with a commit message that look like Blabla #1234.\nThere is a new controller named Webhook to handle incoming requests. The method Webhook::github receive Github events. (https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/app/Controller/Webhook.php#L50)\nA new model, GithubWebhook parse the payload according to the event type and trigger a Kanboard event: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/app/Model/GithubWebhook.php\nAfter that, I just need to define a new automatic action in Kanboard to say: \"When a new Github commit is received then close the task\".\nIn Github settings, define your Webhook url has http://myserver/?controller=webhook&action=github&token=<mytoken>\nMany improvements and error handling have to be done, but the basics are there. It would be pretty similar for Gitlab. They send POST request with a Json payload.\n. I also recommend to use ngrok to test Github Webhooks from your local machine. It's awesome because you can replay any requests for debugging purpose.\nIn Kanboard, there is also a debug($myvar) function, that allow you to send anything to a file (by example Webhook payload). The output file is stored in the folder data, you can also do a tail -f data/debug.log.\n. Gitlab webhooks are now supported in the development version (under testing).\n. I don't know why nginx don't overwrite the header sent by php and why firefox merge both headers (probably written somewhere in HTTP/1.1 RFC). Chrome doesn't complains.\nAnyway, you can now disable the header through the config with:\nphp\ndefine('ENABLE_HSTS', false);\n. I made a fix similar to yours. But that does't touch to the class Core::Response\n. Now in the master branch, only admins can see the list of users.\n. What do you mean?\n- By default, everybody have access to all projects\n- If you allow only some users, only thoses users have access to it\n. Merged.\n. Adding a dashboard is a great idea but I have to improve some part of the code before doing that. By example the activity stream is not good enough see #292.\n. Actually I think I will implement only that on the dashboard:\n- List of assigned tasks to the logged user\n- Activity stream for all my projects\n- Board selector at the top with my projects\nAnd we can improve that later, will be good enough for a first version of the dashboard.\n. I added the dashboard (first version).\n. I'm ok with that. Merged in master.\n. I changed the Markdown parser to use Parsedown. So now, url auto-linking is supported directly by the library.\n. Le datepicker ainsi que le calendrier est maintenant traduit dans toutes les langues dans la version de d\u00e9veloppement.\n. Merged in master.\n. Merged.\n. Nope. Gravatar is now available in master. To enable this feature: \"Settings > Integrations > Gravatar\".\nNote: Avatars are only displayed on the activity stream and comments at the moment.\n. Done in master.\n. Project activity have been rewritten in master.\n. I don't have any oracle licence...\n. Since Kanboard is an open source software, I didn't plan to add Oracle support.. Fixed by @poikilotherm with his pull-request #363.\n. Fixed in master. Thanks.\n. Gantt chart is now available in the dev version.\n. It's now available in the development branch.\nThe author will be displayed in the From field, by example \"Bob via Kanboard\".\n. Yes, but there is a problem with that, if you apply a filter and drag and drop a task to another column, the position of the moved task is not accurate because other tasks are hidden.\n. The board handle the display at none now.\n. Unit tests fixed and pull-request modified. (considered merged).\n. I merged and modified your pull-request. The form is displayed only if there is already some comments on the page.\nNote: Do not use the php tag <?, use only <?php or <?= for templates.\n. Good catch guys, it's merged. Thanks :)\n. Thanks.\n. This thing have been changed recently by a pull-request.\nAnd for admins, that ask the current password as a confirmation just in case.\n. It's now possible with the development branch, see http://kanboard.net/documentation/duplicate-move-tasks for more information.\n. @lawre thumbnails are also available with screenshots\n. I send the http header X-Frame-Options to disallow iframe inclusion. I have to add an exclusion for public board...\n. I changed the code in the development branch.\nThanks.\n. Yes, I plan to add 3 new fields for tasks:\n- Time estimated\n- Time spent\n- Start date\nAnd that will be available in the CSV export.\n. It's done in the master branch.\n. @gmentat I just write a quick \"contributor guide\" if you want to contribute somewhere: http://kanboard.net/documentation/contributing\n. I merged and modified your pull-request.\n- I changed the icon for the status in progress to another one.\n- The shortcut form is displayed only when there is at least one subtask.\n- I updated the translations and the Acl class to allow regular users to toggle the status.\nThanks :)\n. There is already email notifications?\n. It's done in master.\n. Hi, do you have time to rebase your pull-request to the current master?\nI'm ok to merge your patch and add some unit tests.\n. Awesome, it's merged.\n. @poikilotherm I didn't have the chance to look at that yet... I don't even think how I can integrate a swimlane. So everything is open, just keep it simple.\n. @mheinzerling I tested your branch and it's pretty cool. Your release functionality is more advanced than a basic swimlanes system, why simple swimlanes are not enough for your usage? What happens to tasks when you close a release?\n. I think we can start by implementing swimlanes, for me it's enough. It's almost the same thing you already done in your draft.\n. We have swimlanes now...\n. I pushed a fix in master. Should be fixed now.\nThanks to report that.\n. The \"installer\" is a low priority for me. However, I added a new feature in the dev branch to invite people. In this way, new users can choose their own password, there is no need to set a password for them.. It's merged. Thanks :)\n. Custom fields are available through the plugin api (not the user interface). Anybody can create plugins that expose new fields in the user interface.\n. @moraxy the documentation is not yet updated for master, I removed the constant by a database settings.\n. Yes that will export the raw Markdown content, the problem is the description is a multiline content and can contains any kind of characters.\nWhy do you need to have the description in tasks export?\n. Thanks.\n. Not yet, but that can done manually:\n- Export the data directly from the database\n- Use the API\n. Thanks! I merged your pull-request :)\n. Thanks for the fix :)\n. Thanks!\n. This code is not merged.\nI'm sorry for the contributor, I don't even remember why I closed this pull-request. Probably, a mistake. I have nothing against that.\nThe code need to be improved to be included with the current master. I will try to update the code and see if that work well.\n. Merged manually in master.\n. Thanks! It's merged in master.\n. For Redhat, I think it's similar to Centos and by default SeLinux is enabled with a lot of restrictions. Usually I disable SeLinux or I allow Apache to write in data like that:\nbash\nchcon -R -t httpd_sys_content_rw_t /var/www/html/kanboard/data\nSee: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/centos-installation.markdown#centos-7\nThe problem can also coming from Acl rules on the filesystem or the parent directories that don't have the right privileges/users.\nThe check_setup just do a test with the function is_writeable()...\nDo you run php with a different user from Apache? Do you use nginx with php-fpm?\n. Unfortunately I'm not an expert with Redhat...\nI close this ticket, apparently it works with RHEL 7.\n. Thanks for your contribution, it's merged in master :)\n. I merged the other pull-request #342 \n. @majewsky did you already forgot to vacuum the living room? :)\n. I merged/improved the pull-request of @David-Norris in master.\nThe idea behind is described here: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/recurring-tasks.markdown\nWe will see later if that need some modifications or improvements.\n. Thanks, it's merged :)\n. It's merged, thanks :)\n. Thanks it's merged.\n. It's possible since January.\n. The smtp credentials seems to be wrong, look at the error message \"Failed to authenticate on SMTP server with username \"bcpuser\"\"\n. What browser do you use and which server environment do you use (php/os version) ?\n. Should be fixed now?\n. Teams have been implemented in the development branch. You could test this feature and report potential bugs if you would like to.\n. Thanks, it's merged in master.\n. I implemented a first version of the cumulative flow diagram in the development version:\n\nThe data to generate a graph like that was not recorded before, so the graph can be displayed with at least two 2 days of data...\n. It's now implemented in the development branch, I choose to adopt a simple method but there are several options available:\n- Receive notifications for all tasks (same as before)\n- Only for tasks created by me\n- Only for tasks assigned to me\n- Only for tasks assigned to me and tasks created by myself (the new default)\nAnd it's also possible to filter by projects.\nNote: it's under testing at the moment, if you spot any issue let me know.\n. Thanks, it's merged!\n. Thanks for the translation, it's now included in the current development branch :)\n. This ticket is too old, the mentioned code doesn't exists anymore, I close it.\nTry to install the last version from the zip file, open a new issue if there is a problem.\n. If you want to log php errors, you can configure the php.ini to log to syslog or a file.\nThe application itself is not supposed to throw any error. Except for emails, if something is bad configured, the error message will be written to the file data/debug.log.\nLater, I can improve that to use a real logging system but for now there is not enough stuff that output logs.\n. The development version use Monolog now, error messages can be seen in data/debug.log or in syslog.\n. Good catch! it's merged now.\n. It's a good idea (I like the preview system of Github). However I think you need to change some part of your code:\n- Don't create a new controller Ajax for that, but instead create a new method preview() in the controller App, make it accessible to everybody by changing the Acl model class.\n- Why do you return a response in xml, why not just return a html response?\n- You normally don't need to change something in the Core folder\nTry to make it generic to use the same system for task description and that will be ok.\n. I tested your branch and that seems ok for a pull-request :)\nFor the csrf token, you don't necessary need to worry about that for previews. By example, the js code can send a json payload instead of form data and inside the controller App::preview() you fetch the data with $this->request->getBody(). CSRF tokens are checked only with form post and for our case we don't do anything sensitive with the preview data.\nCurrently, I'm testing the current master in different environment to release the next stable version. This is the reason why I didn't merge anything recently.\nFor the next release, I will focus on improving the user interface and start to implement some reportings, so your patch is welcome.\n. Unfortunately, I don't plan to add a wiki inside Kanboard. I want keep that simple and I think there is already plenty of open source wiki available.\nI try to follow the philosophy \"One software do only one thing but well\".\n. I improved the JsonRPC client to be more convient to use, here some examples how to create or update a task:\n``` php\n$client = new JsonRPC\\Client('http://demo.kanboard.net/jsonrpc.php');\n$client->authentication('jsonrpc', '9e436e811eb314798505cd7d90566b9d69e8fb7004aa0401c9970990d609');\n// Enable debug output\n//$client->debug = true;\n// Create a task for the project #1 (positional arguments)\n$client->createTask('My new task', 1);\n// Same thing but with named arguments\n$client->createTask(['title' => 'Super task', 'project_id' => 1]);\n// Use the generic method execute()\n$client->execute('createTask', ['title' => 'My new task title', 'project_id' => 1]);\n// Change the title of the task #3\n$client->updateTask(3, 'New title for my task');\n```\nThe call $client->createTask(['title' => 'Super task', 'project_id' => 1]); was not supported before, it was the issue you reported. Now all kind of calls are supported by the client.\n. Yes the file was written for a recent Virtualbox version, you can remove those lines. It's there only for me to test with mysql. Kanboard doesn't need so much memory anyway.\n. With the current development version, a new automatic action allow you can send a task by email when a task is moved to another column or closed.\n. Actually, I prefer the idea of the ticket #92 for task linking.\n. Duplicate of #92\n. Merged thanks.\n. I merged your update. \nHowever the file was not properly encoded in utf-8, there was some weird characters: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/pull/364/files#diff-f035284ed7a13cb49dd897886398fd1dR559. \nI converted those characters...\n. To keep Kanboard simple, I won't implement this feature. You can still use the Markdown syntax to cite someone.\n. HTML5 allow multiple h1 or h2 in the page, it's just a heading. The easiest way for me is to improve the CSS to not break the layout.\n. I made some css improvements for that in master.\n. Someone has developed a plugin for that: http://kanboard.net/plugin/wysiwyg\n. It's available in the development version now. I merged the patch of @Typz, see #657.\n. Actuellement, le fuseau horaire est configur\u00e9 au niveau de l'application pour tous les utilisateurs.\nMais tu as raison, il faudrait que chaque utilisateur puisse avoir son propre fuseau horaire.\nC'est ajout\u00e9 dans la liste des am\u00e9liorations \u00e0 faire...\n. Cette fonctionnalit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 impl\u00e9ment\u00e9e dans la version en cours de d\u00e9veloppement.\n. I don't get what is the problem?\n. Subtasks are now displayed in the dashboard for the current development version of Kanboard.\n. @phardouin cela vient de l'autofocus qui d\u00e9clenche le clavier virtuel automatiquement sur firefox mobile. Pour le moment je peux pas changer ce comportement, je verrais par la suite sur comment am\u00e9liorer la version mobile.\n. I merged your pull-request but I need to try for a while to see if it's really useful.\n. What kind of information do you want to know? the most recent modified tasks? the last modified boards?\nFor the callback, there is a webhook for task creation or modification, that send the task data to an url each time something happens. But your software seems to be a desktop client, not sure if it's the right solution.\nIf you can give me some examples of what you would like to have, it will be easier to see how that can fit in Kanboard.\nGood luck with your project, one day I will try to do something in Qt :)\n. Closing due to inactivity.. I changed that in master. Thanks.\n. I don't think sending the user password in clear text by email is a good idea...\n. Another way to do the same thing is to have an invitation system, you send an invite and the user choose his own username/password.\nI keep that on my todo list.\n. Sorting and pagination have been added to the dashboard (development version only).\n. Yes I move external libraries to composer yesterday. The documentation is not updated yet.\nActually, the vendor directory is not commited to the repo. So you have to do a composer install\n. Should be fixed now, I just updated the documentation to use composer.\nNote: the this is the development version, sometimes it can be broken.\n. Duplicate with #426\n. Do you have any php errors in your logs?\n. Did you enable email notifications? if yes, try to disable notifications.\nIt's hard to say without any error message...\n. Maybe you guys can contribute to make the software compatible with mod_security.. How the tasks are displayed on the calendar, which date do you use? the due date?\n. And for the calendar itself, what do you use? http://fullcalendar.io ?\n. It's cool.\nWhat is the purpose of the ical url? Display the tasks in Google calendar or something like that? Apple calendar are compatible with that too?\n. Do you have any error messages in your logs?\n. Probably a Freebsd jails issue, I don't have any relevant experience with that. It's hard to help.\nNginx and php-fpm are running inside the same jail or there is a different jails for the web server and php-fpm? Did you try without any jails?\n. I just tested to install Kanboard (dev and stable version) on Freebsd 10 and that works for me.\nHowever my setup is different than yours, I didn't test with Nginx/php-fpm and Jails, just a standard installation with Apache/mod_php55.\nI wrote a quick guide for a basic setup here: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/freebsd-installation.markdown\n. There is now the notion of private projects with a single user, standard projects are intended to be used in a team.\nHowever, I made 2 improvements in the development version:\n- When creating a new project, the connected user is automatically added to the project members list\n- If there is only one user for the project, the task creation form automatically assign the task to the user\n. Probably next week\n. See https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/issues/455#issuecomment-126111707\n. I just fixed this bug, private projects should be also removed now (master branch).\n. Thanks, merged in master.\n. Yes, I made this choice in the past to disallow access to attachments in the public view.\n. The search is pretty basic, just a LIKE operator. I should probably use the ILIKE for the Postgresql driver.\nThe actual configuration of mysql and sqlite are case insensitive.\nThanks to report that.\n. I will implements that in picodb.\n. I will try to do that before the next stable release.\n. It's done in the master branch.\n. This feature is now available in the development branch. Click on the column title and choose \"create tasks in bulk\".\n. Cool, merged in master.\n. I pushed a fix for that.\nNote: the master branch can be instable sometimes :)\n. Should not happen anymore with a recent version.\n. I improved the mobile layout in the current development version. The application is more \"responsive\". It's not perfect but I can at least navigate without any problem with my smartphone.\n. It's done in the master branch: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/api-json-rpc.markdown#gettimezone\n. Le fichier log est dans data/debug.log mais pour le moment \u00e7a log rien concernant ldap. Je vais ajouter du logging pour \u00e7a des que j'aurais 5min.\n. Je viens d'ajouter le support pour LDAP TLS, en fait \u00e7a fait la m\u00eame chose que ton patch mais c'est activable avec une option de configuration.\nDans le config.php il suffit d'ajouter:\nphp\ndefine('LDAP_START_TLS', true);\n. Oui il faut mettre a jour, pour l'\u00e9diteur de code eclipse est peut-\u00eatre un overkill... vim ou sublime text marchent bien.. chacun ses preferences.\n. In Kanban/scrum, the priority is defined by the position (order in the column) of your task in the board. To keep Kanboard simple I prefer not to add another field for that.\n. Actually, the user interface in the development branch look like that (populated with random data):\n\nThe Kanboard logo is not visible anymore to have more space for the application content.\nYour logo is cool, but I don't think that fit in the current design.\n. Cool, I was ready to merge but why do you add octicons, we already have font awesome? Just for the markdown icon?\n. I pushed a fix to avoid the fatal error, however I can't really reproduce the issue.\nIf there is a migration error, a rollback is done and the sql error is displayed on your screen.\nBe sure to update the vendor directory with composer...\n. It's now available in the development version.\nThe sum of task complexity can be seen on the right of each column if the value is greater than 0.\n\n. Not yet, but should not be very difficult. I have to record some data in the database to generate the burndown chart easily.\n. yep\n. It's now possible to choose the default task color in settings but only globally not by project.\n. Why Json-RPC instead of REST?\n- I don't need to force the end-user to enable the mode rewrite to have nice url, however nice urls will be available later but optional. By default, you download the archive, unzip, done, nothing to configure.\n- The only thing I want to do is to execute a function on my server from a remote client and get a result, that RPC.\n- I don't need to define urls, handle http errors, I already have the code for a rpc server so the implementation was very easy.\n- The data structure is standardized in json\n- With some client library, you can have transparent function calls\n- I can probably handle batch requests instead of doing multiple http requests\nProbably a better explanation: http://www.simple-is-better.org/rpc/\nI don't exclude to have a REST api in the future but I have to implements nice urls first in the router...\n. I will change the api call to return the task id instead of a boolean, that will be easier for everybody.\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. This is now available in the development branch. (Yes, after all this time, finally!). Available in v1.0.39. The content is now hidden but only for content update events (master version).\n. It's now possible in the current development version. However, only admins can convert a private project to a normal project. Just uncheck the box \"Private project\" on the project edit page.\n. At the moment, the permission system is very simple. I will see how to add new role \"manager\" for the next versions, but since the beginning I try to keep Kanboard very simple.\n. Should be fixed in the last master, it was a bug introduced by recent code refactoring (categories duplication).\nThis feature is not yet fully covered by unit tests.\n. When the session timeout, you are redirected to the login page.\n. Thanks, it's merged.\n. Sorry, I'm closing this FR, try to keep it very simple for now.\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. The software is not really made for that initially. That will occurs too many change. I prefer to keep the software very simple.\nThank you for your understanding.. It's hidden on the board because there is no other boards to display. It's not hidden on the dashboard because you can go to the board through the dropdown.\n. I updated master, now you are redirected to the login form if the session is expired (when you leave a tab open on the board).\n. It's now changed in master.\n. It's done in master (currently under testing).\n. Keyboards shortcuts will come later, there is other improvements to do before that.\n. There some keyboard shortcuts implemented in the development version. You can save a form with Ctrl+Enter or Command+Enter (with OS X).\n. You have to configure the members of the project.\nThis feature has been improved in the current development branch. Creating a new project, add automatically the first user...\n. Yes, it's a feature :)\nWhen you are alone in your project, a new task is automatically assigned to you, but on the edit form is the same as before.\nSee https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/issues/385\n. Its' not a bug it's a feature :)\n- For subtasks, only the title and the time estimated are duplicated\n- For tasks, only some fields are duplicated https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/app/Model/TaskDuplication.php#L19-L30\nDuplicate the subtask assignee is probably a good idea, but the status is reseted.\n. Oui \u00e7a sera possible mais dans la prochaine version apr\u00e8s celle-ci.\nPour le moment je stabilise ce qui est dans la version de dev pour sortir une version stable, ensuite je pourrais ajouter des nouvelles fonctionnalit\u00e9s.\n. Pour le d\u00e9lai, une nouvelle version stable sort environ tous les mois. L\u00e0 je suis un peu en retard, mais dans quelques jours une nouvelle version va arriver.\nPour le calendrier, un contributeur travail sur un patch apparemment https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/issues/383#issuecomment-65430692\nLes fonctionnalit\u00e9s les plus populaires sont d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e en premier \u00e0 condition que \u00e7a reste dans l'esprit du logiciel. Le but c'est que \u00e7a reste simple, je veux pas que \u00e7a devienne une usine \u00e0 gaz.\n. In version 1.0.39, a very simple approach is used now, if a columns contains tasks, the menu entry to remove a column doesn't appear anymore. In addition, the number of open and closed tasks are shown in the table.\nI know that this is not perfect, but at least that prevent people to lost data if they don't read the confirmation message.. I introduced a drop down menu now to be able to add more filters.\n. Your patch doesn't seems to work when the session is auto started in the php.ini session.auto_start = 1. This is why the session is destroyed before. However, if session.auto_start = 0 that works.\n. I just tested and that seems to work for (comment creation).\nNote: The username of the comment author must be the same between Github and Kanboard and the task must exists before.\nOnly comments creation are handled by Github, comments update doesn't trigger any events on Github.\n. It's now possible with the current master. I changed the database schema and comments can be created without author.\n. It's now possible with the last version of master.\n. It's merged, thanks.\n. Nice library, but I don't want to include another dependency and the current tooltips are not too bad after all. \n. With the last development version, users can choose their own timezone and language.\n. There is now a new role \"project admins\", global reports can be added later easily.\n. If you download the archive http://kanboard.net/kanboard-1.0.10.zip or http://kanboard.net/kanboard-latest.zip you don't have to do anything, dependencies are included.\nBut if you download the development version https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/archive/master.zip, you have to use composer.\n. This feature is not yet implemented, the current api need to have a better design/architecture to handle that. Or maybe we should have a specifically designed api for user access from mobile clients and a simple authentication with the actual user/password instead of the very long api key.\n. @hussam789 probably for the next version, I want to test master and release a new stable version before making any important changes.\n. I started to implement the user api access in the development branch. At the moment, it's pretty basic, more procedures will be available later.\n- Differences between the application and user api: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/api-json-rpc.markdown#user-and-application-api\n- List of methods available through the user api: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/api-json-rpc.markdown#authorized-user-api-procedures\nIt's a work in progress...\n. Before Kanboard 1.0.10, I was using a \"modified\" version of password_compat that works everywhere. But now I handle the external dependencies with Composer, so we got the standard version that works only with PHP >= 5.3.7 (https://github.com/ircmaxell/password_compat#requirements).\nI was not thinking that so many people were using a so old PHP version. I'm also thinking to revert back this change, I should probably include my modified version instead...\nIf you want to use Kanboard with PHP 5.3.3:\n- Disable the check in the file check_setup.php https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/app/check_setup.php#L4\n- Get the the old vendor/password.php file from an old archive or from this gist https://gist.github.com/fguillot/7df83468fa1a8a7152bd\n- Include the password.php in the file app/common.php\nThis library is only used for local accounts, LDAP auth doesn't use that.\n. I reverted back the changes, so the next version of Kanboard will be compatible with PHP 5.3.3 (Centos 6.x and Debian 6).\n. I changed the code in master to use \"name\" as argument like described in the documentation.\nThanks to report that.\n. It's done in the development version with a dropdown menu on the task.\n. Why?\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. SMTP errors should be sent to the file data/debug.log and syslog.\n. Just to be sure:\n- Notifications are not send to you if you are the person who does the action, only to other members\n- Make sure everybody have an email address and notification enabled\n- People have to be member of the project to receive notifications\n- If you have no errors, that means the smtp configuration is correct\n- You don't need to turn anything on for the logging\n- If that doesn't work we need to investigate deeper...\n. It's now available in master. For each board, you can collapse/expand tasks.\n. Iframe inclusion is not allowed by default, you probably have to disable the HTTP header here:\nhttps://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/app/Controller/Base.php#L152\n. I added a new config option in the development branch:\nYou can disable the \"X-Frame-Options: DENY\" HTTP header like that (in your config.php):\nphp\ndefine('ENABLE_XFRAME', false);\nThis why you got a blank page and no error message, it's a security header used by web browsers to prevent this behavior. Just disable that with the option parameter, that should work with Owncloud.\n. It's weird, I upload excel files and that works fine with firefox/chrome/safari.\nFiles are not stored in the database but on the disk in data/files. However the web app force the file to be saved during the download but that shouldn't be a problem.\nWhat do you use on the client side? browser/os?\n. Thanks, it's merged.\n. If you know how to fix it, no problem, send a pull-request and I will merge it.\n. Fix Merged.\n. I tested your pull-requests and that seems to work. However, I will made some improvements in the code before to integrate that in Kanboard.\nWhere do you use the javascript library moment.js?\n. Your pull-request will be integrated for the next version. For now, I'm testing the current master for the next couple of days before to release a new stable version.\n. I solved partially this issue, the dashboard is more \"responsive\" now. If you have a screen < 1280px the dashboard is displayed on a single column.\nThe next step is to add an option in user settings to choose the preferred mode.\n. With the last development version, you can choose to hide or show any section of the dashboard. Just hide the activity stream section to have a single column view.\n. Thanks, It's merged in the master branch!\n. Thanks, your fix is merged!\n. In the current development version, I accepted a patch to have a new user role \"owner\" that means a standard user can manage users and some project properties.\nI will improve that for the next stable version.\n. Yes, the timestamp include the time, I should change that.\n. With the last version of master, due date don't contains the time anymore (reseted to 00:00:00).\n. It's on the roadmap.\n. I started to implement some keyboard shortcuts in master:\n- Ctrl+Enter or Cmd+Enter to save a form\n- b to open the board selector\n- n to create a new task from the board\n- s to collapse/expand tasks on a board\n. Thanks for the contribution, it's merged :)\n. It's probably a bug, I have done many refactoring recently but I maybe miss something.\nThe tasks should not be deleted, it's probably a wrong id somewhere, you can check in the database the value of the fields swimlane_id and the column_id. The value 0 is the default swimlane.\nExample to check the values of a missing task:\nsql\nSELECT column_id, swimlane_id, position FROM tasks WHERE id=1234;\n. Ok, it's a bug, I can reproduce the problem.\n. Should be better now. More testing have to be done and I need to reduce the number of sql queries.\nDon't hesitate to report other bugs :)\n. Yes, I fixed that yesterday, you should update the code again and also the dependencies with composer.\nI'm currently testing with my own instance to find other bugs after my different refactorings... unit tests can't catch user interface problems.\nI close this ticket, if you find something else just open a new one :)\n. To keep Kanboard simple, I think attachments to tasks are good enough.\n. It's weird? I use this feature everyday with Kanboard itself.\nDo you use the last version of master?\n. Can you tell me which automatic actions you are using with the parameters and the order?\nBecause I do exactly the same thing with this bug tracker...\n. Awesome, I just modified your patch to prefix the keys with \"filters_\".\nI just discover the double bitwise in javascript ~~(filterDueDate) :)\nThanks.\n. There is time tracking now.\n. cool, give me the week to review and test that.\n. I merged and improved your pull-request. Let me know if there is any issue.\n. Thanks, it's fixed in master.\n. Sorry, I prefer to keep Kanboard simple.\n. You can use links to have relations between tasks instead of using subtasks.\n. It should be fixed now in master.\n. A patch have been merged for that.\n. The due date a have to be a ISO-8601 format for task creation and task modification. However, when you get a task the date is shown as a unix timestamp.\n``` php\n$client = new JsonRPC\\Client('http://localhost/kanboard/jsonrpc.php');\n$client->authentication('jsonrpc', 'token');\n// Create a task with due date\n$task_id = $client->createTask(['title' => 'My new task', 'project_id' => 2, 'date_due' => '2015-01-20']);\n$task = $client->getTask($task_id);\nprint_r($task); // Display unix timestamp\n// Same thing here, the date must use the iso format\n$client->updateTask(['id' => $task_id, 'date_due' => '2015-01-14']);\n```\n- date_modification can't be set, it's done internally by the application\n- Other fields time_estimated, date_started, time_spent and time_estimated are not yet available through the api.\nOnly fields described in the documentation are available.\nThe API will be improved in the next version.\n. Those calls are exactly the same, I just tested with the version 1.0.10 and that seems ok for me.\nDo you have any errors?\n. No answer, ticket closed.\n. I took another approach, the \"task update\" event describe the changes made in the task now.\n. I splitted the sidebar with 2 menus. I will see after a while if it's better to use...\n. Thanks, it's merged :)\n. I never tested, but if you are the only user it should work.\n. Concerning the pull-request, the task duplication itself should not happen in the controller but in the model:\nhttps://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/app/Model/Project.php#L244\n- Actually, the board, automatic actions, categories and users are duplicated.\n- Coping tasks should be optional by example with a checkbox visible in the template.\n- Moving that logic in class ProjectDuplication is a good idea\n. Yes, you should be able to do it with the last version. A project manager can remove tasks of anybody in the project.\n. I'm ok with the fact of not showing tasks for inactive projects.\nBut I don't get the use case you describe about cloning the project for users?\n. I merged your patch, so I close this ticket now.\n. Awesome, give me the week to test and review that.\n. Why the links are specific per project, why not global to the application? That simplify a lot of stuff. \nCategories and swimlanes are specific per project because they can be different but you will always define the same link types \"blocked by/blocks this task...\", it's like task colors for me. \n. Jira have those links:\n\nI think those \"relations\" should be there by default, that cover most needs.\nI would prefer to have links global to the application, by example available from a new section in the settings page.\nMy concern is you have done a lot of works to make your pull-request, are you ok to change that? Maybe someone else have a different opinion? after all it's an open source software.\n. I close this pull-request, just open a new one when you will be ready.\nThanks.\n. I like the idea but we should find another library to do that, \"supa\" is a Java applet and I got many security warnings. There is probably something similar in Flash.\nJira also have a feature like that, I should take look.\n. I have a working prototype in pure Javascript based on the mentioned links above. That works only with Firefox and Chrome. I will release that soon if that work well.\n. Finally it's pushed into master. You can add a screenshot directly from the dropdown menu in the board:\n\nAnd after you just have to press CTRL+V:\n\nAt the moment, it's works only with Chrome and Firefox (tested with Mac OS X).\n. I tested on Windows 7, IE11, last Chrome and last Firefox, seems to work.\n. I cannot reproduce the issue, can you provide more information? Do you have automatic actions, categories or users in the source project?\nApparently the bug happens during the execution of the method resolveDuplicatedParameters(), that mean an automatic action cannot be duplicated. Can you describe which automatic actions are configured in your project?\n. Should not happen anymore with the last development version.\n. Ok my bad, I made a typo in the SQL query for the schema migration.\nYou should be able to fix that by adding a quote around the value 1 in the file app/Schema/Postgres.phpline 33 like that:\nhttps://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/commit/6ad98cb8551887b6f29b805e1853d314d55bcf06\nThe fix is in the development version. But if you want to stay on the stable, just can just change the sql query. (http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/datatype-boolean.html)\n. - Edit the file markdown.css\n- Execute the script ./scripts/make-assets.sh to generate css/js files\n. It's not a bug, it's described in the documentation: http://kanboard.net/documentation/creating-projects\nThere is no user management with private projects.\n. It's now the case with the last version of master.\n. There is now a start and end date for projects in the development version.\n. The problem with that is you override the default browser behaviour.\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/779689/right-mouse-click-in-web-applications-good-or-bad-idea\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/2055065/why-isnt-right-click-more-used-in-web-applications?rq=1\nHowever a dropdown menu that appears with a left click on the task id is maybe better (works on tablets). The context menu can display shortcut methods to update the task quickly.\n. If you know how to implements a simple dropdown menu that works on major browsers/tablets and that don't use too many external libraries, feel free to propose something.\nThere is also too many items now for the menu above the board, a dropdown menu is maybe a good idea.\n. I added a dropdown menu for tasks on the board in the master version. I'm testing that on my own installation...\n. Now there is a new type of users call \"Project administrator\" to create multi-users projects.\n. Teams have been implemented in the development branch. You could test this feature and report potential bugs if you would like to.\n. Thanks it's fixed in the dev version.\n. Awesome, can you explain quickly how to install the port? I would like to update the documentation https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/freebsd-installation.markdown\nThanks\n. Thanks, I merged your pull-request: http://kanboard.net/documentation/freebsd-installation\nI will update the doc when the port will be available in the official Freebsd port tree.\n. According to https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=196810 Kanboard have been integrated into the port tree of FreeBSD.\nI tested the package on FreeBSD 10.1 and I have one question: is it the responsibility of the user or the packager to make the directory /usr/local/www/kanboard/data writable by the user www?\nThanks again to maintain a FreeBSD port :)\n. For your information the dependencies php56-gd and php56-hash seems missing.\n. I didn't mentioned hash in the doc because with php packages on linux distros it's always included by default, so I don't even think about that. In FreeBSD, php extensions seems to be separated into more packages.\nFrom this list https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/ports.cgi?query=php56&stype=all&sektion=all, those packages can also be added:\n- php56-json\n- php56-ldap (optional only if people want to use ldap authentication)\n- php56-opcache (optional but recommended to improve performances)\nThanks\n. Thanks again for creating the package! I posted a news about that: http://kanboard.net/news/freebsd-port-kanboard\n. Yes, it's a bug. I don't get how I didn't catch that during my tests.\nIt's fixed in the master branch: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/commit/51d77786deae14cfa4a7afbf3b097424db8e187b\nNote: For now, there is nothing to handle Gitlab issue update in Kanboard, that will be improved.\nThanks to report that.\n. From the dashboard, you can see the activity stream of all projects where you are member.\n. Sub columns are not yet available.\nThe only way to simulate that is to add a column for each sub column: \"Analyze Doing\" and \"Analyze Done\" by example. But you are already doing that... \n. The calendar filters are now prefixed with the project_id in local storage. \n. Something is probably wrong with your installation, that means php didn't parse your files.\nIt's hard to guess what is wrong, you should give us more details to find the issue. How did you install Kanboard? Where? What is the environment? Do you have any PHP errors?\n. With the current development version, you can search globally in all projects you are member.\n. Actually there is no convenient way to have a global overview and that need to be improved for next versions.\n. It's not configurable through the user interface. It's defined directly in the source code, here: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/app/Controller/App.php#L61\n. Probably a nginx configuration problem. It's pretty hard to guess what is wrong in your setup.\nI use Kanboard everyday with nginx/php-fpm... Do you have any errors in your logs?\n. Actually it's not implemented, but that should not be very hard to add.\nThe ReverseProxy authentication is similar to that. https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/app/Auth/ReverseProxy.php\n. I made a plugin for SSL Client certificate authentication: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-client-certificate\nDon't hesitate to improve this plugin.\nThanks\n. Thanks, I merged your patch: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/commit/e6f7929f7780dc7ab06f6c4fbbbc86cd63115cd2\nI just modified the code to have translated text.\n. It's fixed in the last master version.\nThanks.\n. That will be very nice, just need to figure out how to make that in css/js...\n. Closing this ticket, hide column are already asked in #101 and swimlanes are implemented in master.\n. Actually, the project_id is used to check project permissions...\n. It's modified in master, if you omit the project_id an extra sql query is made to fetch the project_id from the task.\n. Fix merged.\n. Thanks, I merged your patch.\nI moved the inherited Parsedown class to a separate file and adapted the code to the last stable version of Parsedown.\n. Thanks it's merged, I also added the method getActiveMemberProjects() to be able to filter events from the dashboard.\n. Now, there is a calendar for each user that display tasks for all projects where your are member.\n. I merged and changed some stuff.\n. Merged.\n. Your patch doesn't work, when you display any page without a \"task_id\" param that return a 404, that works only for tasks related pages. You have to check if the \"task_id\" param is there to get the project_id from the task.\nI made this change directly in master.\nThanks.\n. I pushed a fix in the development branch: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/commit/7703d0459ab33b8b5ca0e49410fe5b8b8962a61c\nThat should fix the problem. However, I cannot reproduce your issue, you have probably a very old version of sqlite. Do you know which version of sqlite and php is it?\n. Subtasks are removed with a foreign key constraints.\n. @jeffshieldsdev It's now implemented in the last development version.\n. That will require too many changes, but you can duplicate automatic actions between projects.\n. I changed that in master. Thanks!\n. Thanks, it's merged.\n. Thanks, it's merged.\n. Thanks, it's merged.\n. The current version of the calendar show only tasks with due date for the moment.\n. Sorry about that, those files were ignored by the gitignore. I included the missing files in the repo.\nThat should work now.\n. Thanks, it's merged.\n. Or close all subtasks when a task is closed.\n. With the last development version, all subtasks will be closed when you close a tasks.\n. I cannot merge your pull-request. Can you send a new one with only your commits?\n. Thanks, it's merged. I just keep the percentage.\n. Yes, it's not the same array, but something similar can be done with a template helper function. You have to count manually the number of subtasks completed and return the percentage.\n. Sorry, but I don't plan to move to Bootstrap. The mobile view can be improved, I already improved the tablet layout with some responsive css.\nMoving to Bootstrap will introduce a new dependency, need to change all the templates, testing again everything for potential bugs... Why Bootstrap? Why not Zurb foundation? Why not just any css grid? or the next cool css framework of the moment? When Bootstrap 4 will be released everything will need to be modified again due to breaking changes.\nI want to keep this software simple to use and easy to maintain. There is already so much external dependencies. And personally, I'm tired to see Bootstrap everywhere.\n. What grid system do you recommend? There is thousands of projects for that...\n. If you want to redesign Kanboard or to create a theme, you can use a plugin to do that (only with the development version at the moment).\nYou can override any templates and use Twitter Bootstrap or anything else if you like too.\nMore information here:\n- https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/doc/plugins.markdown\n- https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-example-theme\n- https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-example-css\n. FYI, I started the development of this plugin. An email confirmation will be necessary to create the account and optionally a domain restriction.\n. The plugin is available here: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-registration (works only with the dev branch of Kanboard at the moment).\n. Yes, it's a good idea.\nWhat programming language do you want to use for that?\n. Don't hesitate to post a link to your project when you will be ready.\n. The dropdown on the page \"move to another project\" show projects where you are member. You have to be member of the project even if you are admin.\n. For the Swimlane, just add a method duplicate() like other stuff (categories...)\nThe task duplication should be optional during project duplication, the user should be able to choose or not to duplicate tasks with a checkbox by example. So you can do it in two pass without modifying too much the current code:\n1. Duplicate the project with all properties (one transaction: ProjectDuplication::duplicate())\n2. If the project is duplicated successfully, duplicate all task (TaskDuplication::duplicateToProject())\n. This feature is now implemented in the development version, each column can scroll independently. The board height is now the same height as the window.\n. One solution can be to lowercase the username for ldap authentication through Kanboard.\nWhat database type do you use? Sqlite, Mysql or Postgresql?\n. I modified the code in the dev branch:\n- By default all ldap username will be lowercase in the database to avoid duplicates.\n- To enable the previous behaviour, set the constant LDAP_USERNAME_CASE_SENSITIVE at true.\nI tested with ActiveDirectory and that seems ok, no more duplicates.\n. It's merged, thanks.\nFor the translations, I updated the doc: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/translations.markdown\n. It's now fixed in the last development version.\nThanks to report this issue.\n. @pconstans The dropdown menu display only projects where you are member. You have to be member of the project, go to project settings then user management and add your user.\n. I added the Bitbucket web hook in the current development branch based on Gitlab and Github hooks.\nHowever, only commits message seems to be supported by their webhook, I didn't find anything about the issue tracker.\nAt the moment, only closing a task from a commit message is supported (tested only with git, should work with mercurial too).\nThe documentation: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/bitbucket-webhooks.markdown\n. @bastiao issues hooks are for bitbucket internal issues tracker, not for external software.\n. There is also packages for specific versions instead of latest http://kanboard.net/kanboard-1.0.11.zip etc...\n. You can also call this url from a script with curl to know the last stable version curl http://kanboard.net/version.\n. Awesome, I added a new section \"Related projects\" in the readme: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard#related-projects\n. It's merged. Thanks.\n. It's merged. Thanks.\n. There is no release date yet.\nI want to add a couple of feature, fix all remaining bugs and test again.\n. I released the version 1.0.12 today.\n. Fixed. Thanks.\n. Fixed. Thanks.\n. Merged c92aae6\n. I plan to add to add more stuff in the calendar. So I try different configs...\nBy example, I need to have the subtasks time tracking in the calendar and for that I need a day view. And maybe also the closed tasks with the start date/completed date. The user should have the choice to display different things.\nThe development branch is a constant working in progress, it's not definitive.\n. Thanks it's merged.\n. Merged.\n. Merged.\nNote: include only necessary commits in your pull-request, don't include \"Merge pull-request...\", it's easier to merge. Thanks :)\n. Not yet, it's not a priority right now.\n. You have custom stylesheet now.\nI don't plan to add a theme system right now. I already do that with another open software and people don't maintain their themes over the time.\n. It's done in master: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/api-json-rpc.markdown#getversion\n. I updated the example in the doc.\n. It's definitively useful, you can send a pull-request :)\n. I merged your pull-request.\nIf you want to display the hours, just send another pull-request :)\n. I merged your pull-request but I have done some refactoring/simplification.\n. The CFD include all tasks now (in master).\n. Thanks it's merged.\n. You can also use the webhooks: http://kanboard.net/documentation/webhooks\nWhen a task is modified or created the application call an url on your server.\n. It's fixed in the development branch.\nThe problem was coming from a duplicate column name. In the translation file the column name \"K\u00e9sz\" was present two times.\nSo I renamed the column \"Done\" to \"Csin\u00e1lt\" with Google translate.\nDiff: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/commit/8fde5df4f829e9ea2c3a9262512a34a584e4b4e5\nThanks to report the issue.\n. I merged and modified your pull-request (move the function to the right place and the text can be translated).\nNote: Template helper functions go to app\\Core\\Helper.php.\n. It's fixed in master.\n. I merged the pull-request #666 to have custom css. In theory, you can do the something similar by overriding the default css.\n. You can already change the location of data stored in data by using those constants:\n- DEBUG_FILE\n- FILES_DIR\n- DB_FILENAME\nThe class FileCache is not used actually.\nI could also add another constant like DATA_DIR...\n. I just removed temporarily the complexity because there is too much stuff on a card now.\nDon't worry the complexity will be back, I just need to find how to display everything correctly.\n. I restored the task complexity, now it's displayed on the bottom left. And the task age is displayed on the top right.\nI also possible to scroll horizontally when the number of columns is too high. So there is no limit anymore on the number of columns. I tested with several screen resolution 1366x768, 2880x1800 and my ipad retina.\n. Thanks it's merged.\n. I added the missing translation.\n. Nice, I added your project in the readme file.\nI didn't test your script but if that works correctly, I have no problem to add this to the Kanboard cli.\n. There is now a new role \"Project Viewer\" with read-only access available in the development branch. You could try this feature and report potential bugs if you would like.\n. Merged.\n. You can collapse column or swimlane and you can enable/disable individual column scrolling.\n. It's weird, that works for me, did you update to the last master?\n. I just activated the drag and drop to change due tasks for user calendar.\n. It's already in the dev version, you can \"stack\" cards from the dropdown menu or by using the keyboard shortcut \"s\".\n. Fixed.\n. I added the dropdown menu in stacked mode.\n. Thanks, I added a link to your project in the readme file: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard#related-projects\n. I merged/improved the pull-request of @ashbike. You can toggle the compact mode by using the keyboard shortcut \"c\" or by using the dropdown menu.\nIn compact mode you might have some text overlapping if there are too much stuff on the card.\n. Nice!\nI added a link to your package in the faq https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/faq.markdown#how-to-install-kanboard-on-yunohost and in the readme https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard#related-projects\n. Duplicate with #635 \n. I modified your pull-request because there is an issue when you link a task from another project with different column names than the current task project.\n. Merci pour la traduction. Pour r\u00e9pondre aux questions :\n1. Le %s est erreur de typo, \u00e7a aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre %d\n2. Oui \u00e7a aurait pu \u00eatre cr\u00e9erau lieu de ajouter, mais dans le contexte du message qui appara\u00eet dans l'interface \u00e7a change pas grand chose.\n3. Le texte blocks est relatif aux liens des t\u00e2ches Cette t\u00e2che bloque la t\u00e2che X\n4. Pour les %b %e, c'est utilis\u00e9 pour formater les dates, les formats sont d\u00e9finis ici http://php.net/strftime\nJ'ai aussi mis \u00e0 jour la doc pour les traducteurs : https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/translations.markdown#date-and-time-translation\n. Nice job :)\n- Categories are there, so I don't want to remove this feature, it's actually used by people.\n- Tags can be complementary\n- I don't think we need to serialize this data, CSV format seems fine, there is no need to make an extra sql query to display all tags for a task.\n- However, we should be able to search for tasks based on tags and that need to be fast enough. Searching in the tag field with a LIKE operator might slow because you will do a full table scan.\n- The tag label should not be restricted with alphanumeric characters, people would like to use their own language (French, Portuguese...).\nI don't know what is the best solution, looking in other open source project might interesting to find some inspiration.\nBy the way, how do you apply a color to a label?\n. There is also some edge case with the CSV field method, by example if you have a tag \"user\" and another tag \"user interface\" and you want to get all tasks with the tag \"user\" by using \"LIKE %user%\" you will have the tasks tagged \"user interface\" too.\nBasically, I think there is 3 methods to store the tags:\n1. The CSV method (everything in one column, super easy to implement, autocomplete harder to implement)\n2. 3 tables: \"tasks\", \"tags\" and \"tasks_tags\" as a junction table (slower insert but ok, more complex, works in all case, should be fast with some index)\n3. A table \"tags\" with a foreign key \"task_id\" to the task table (not perfect but can work)\n. @ashbike if you have a working prototype with the \"csv method\", you can send a pull-request. So it will be easier to test/improve.\n. Yes the tags feature will use multiple tables but there is so many other things to improve before.\n. There are many ways to implement tags, I opened a new issue concerning the implementation in the user interface #2331 \n. Tags are now available in the development branch.\n. What about using css class instead of using inline css? by example \"board-compact-view\" and \"board-scroll-view\" or something else.\n. Basically, you just have to backup your data before and then copy the files like described in the documentation.\n. I think the next step for keyboard shortcuts will be to navigate through the task on the board with the arrows and j k.\nBe able to select multiple tasks can be useful too, example ctrl+shit+a to select all tasks in one column and move them to another column. Same thing with ctrl+mouse click.\n. You can also create multiple actions to assign a color to user.\n. The software is not really made for that initially. That will occurs too many change. I prefer to keep the software very simple.\nThank you for your understanding.. It's now fixed in the development branch.\n. If I understand correctly, you want to receive email notifications only for the assignee, right?\n. nope\nThe notifications code will be refactored to take into account several feature requests, but also to be more flexible and send more relevant notifications.\n. @fabdelgado It's now implemented in the development branch.\n. To hide a task from the board you just need to close the task.\nYou can also do that with an automatic action.\n. I'm not sure if including the html content inside the title attribute was a good idea. There was a bug with Chrome/Firefox when you add a link. I fixed that by using a single quote for the attribute.\n. There is probably more appropriate tools to encrypt sensitive data.\n. Do you have an idea why I cannot do a mouseover on tooltips for column description but I can do it with task footer tooltips?\n. I never notice any \"re-layout\", how I can reproduce the issue?\n. This bug is fixed in the development branch.\nNote: The due date doesn't contain the time, only the date.\n. Unfortunately, your feature request haven't been popular enough among other users so I'm this ticket.. What is the use case for that, do you have an example?\n. It's merged in master.\n. Should be fixed in the current development version.\n. The grouping is a good idea, it's more readable.\n. Need to be tested in master\n. Sorry, for me it's the same thing as subtasks.\n. I added the subtasks position in the master branch. There is no drag and drop but you can move up and down the subtasks.\n. Thanks, it's fixed in master.\n. Do you have any php errors when you upgrade from one version to another? What database do you use: sqlite, mysql or postgres?\nIt's maybe related to the maximum memory allowed for php, hard to say without any errors.\n. Now there is an automatic action to assign a color according to the column.\n. The template 'task/tags.php' seems to be missing in the pull-request.\n. Tags will be probably implemented in the future but differently (not with the \"csv\" way).\nThanks for making this prototype.\n. With the current development version, you can now see closed tasks in the board, however you cannot move those tasks.\n. Thanks for your contribution, it's merged in master.\n. Sorry, I don't get it, can you elaborate with a use case or an example?\n. I plan to add a section for working days/hours for each users. And be able to substract that time from the timesheet.\nA button with start/pause/stop will be very useful too.\n. @BlueTeck There is now a start/stop button for subtask timer.\n. @golharam for tasks there is only a field \"time spent\"\n. Same as Gantt chart, see #725\n. The page header seems to be broken when you enable the horizontal scrolling the header don't use the full page width.\n. It's done in the development version, you can use:\ndefine('DB_PORT', 1234);\n. It's fixed in the development branch. I moved the complexity to the bottom right.\n. I think we need to reduce the number of sql queries to display the board. The category name and description are in the same table, that can be fetched in a single query. After that there is probably a way to improve the variables passing to the template.\n. Merged and modified.\n. The activity stream is now available in the task view.\n. Actually, the purpose of isImage() is to display or not the popover. I mean a file that can be viewed in the browser. So it can be restricted to only some file types.\n. In the development branch, you have now a unique css class name for each board: board-project-id (by example board-project-1). You can also add some custom css from the settings page since I merged the pull-request #666.\n. It's already available, the dropdown is visible when there is at least one swim-lane.\n. I just changed this behavior in the current development branch. Now, you just have to check the box \"allow everybody\".\n. Thanks, it's merged.\n. Now, there is a tooltip for task title in the master branch.\n. Yes, this feature is under development. A budget management section is coming to use this data.\nAnyway this issue should be fixed.\n. 1) There is no plugin api at the moment. \n2) As you can see in the source code, there is no framework, it's just a MVC web application that use a couple of libraries...\n. Thanks, it's merged.\n. Thanks for the translation, it's merged!\n. I still having the same issue as before due to the fixed layout of the table:\n\nI don't see the flickering with my own boards, how many tasks do you have on your board?\n. Thanks it's merged.\nI see your point about the horizontal scrollbar. I didn't notice that because I use a macbook and I can scroll horizontally with the touchpad without using the scrollbars.\n. All people are members of the projects? Everybody have a valid email address and enabled notifications? No errors?\n. As far I know, the library use to parse the Markdown content doesn't support yet the checkboxes. That can probably done with a custom extension.\nHowever, you can still create subtasks, there are 3 different states: \"todo\", \"in progress\" and \"done\".\n. Thanks for the translation, it's merged!\n. The way it's currently made, that will require too much changes to implement that.\n. To be compatible with all versions of PHP, you could use a method to build the table name instead of a class constant. If you guys really need that feature, I let you make a pull-request.. On the settings page, you can define default categories for all projects. More information here: http://kanboard.net/documentation/board-configuration\n. At the moment there is no automatic procedure to migrate from one database type to another one.\nThat could be a great addition to the command line tool.\n. Yes, no problem.\n. Tickets related to the calendar should be posted to the calendar plugin bug tracker: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-calendar/issues\nThank you. The board is there for that.\n. You can already define those colors automatically with automatic actions. Have a look to the section \"examples\" of the page http://kanboard.net/documentation/automatic-actions\n. There is a new feature introduced in the current master, it's called \"task transitions\", that record all task column moves with the time spent in the origin column and the person that does the action.\n. Closed because there is task transitions now.\n. I just fixed that in the current development branch.\n. Probably early April for the next stable version.\n. it's due to the html escaping. I have to check if I can remove that without risking having code injection...\n. I removed the html escaping for custom css, should be fixed now.\n. It's now possible with the current development version by using plugins, see:\n- https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-example-automatic-action\n- https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/doc/plugins.markdown#extend-automatic-actions\n. Duplicate of #832 \n. Gantt chart is available in the dev version, see https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/gantt-chart.markdown\n. It's now possible in master branch, there is a new group \"project admins\" for that.\n. Sorry, for me it's out of the scope of Kanboard, this software focus on simplicity.\n. It's fixed in the master branch.\n. Fixed.\n. Just to be sure, did you rename the file config.default.php to config.php?\n. Thanks. It's fixed in the development version.\n. Yes, this bug is fixed in the current development version.\n. You can use any folder name or no folder at all. Do you have any php errors?\n. if you have an error 500, you should see an error in your log files (apache error logs)? What is your environment os/php version?\n. This feature is not yet implemented but I plan to add an optional 2 factors authentication. \n. There is now a bruteforce protection into the development version see\nhttps://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/bruteforce-protection.markdown\n. I think it's too overkill to include that into Kanboard...\n. Duplicate #340\n. Temporary, you can use the custom stylesheet to hide those metrics:\ncss\n.task-board-days { display: none }\n. The position \n. Merged and modified to avoid some code duplication and fix php 5.3 compatibility (don't use [ and ] for arrays).\n. PHP 7 is available on travis?\n. Can you enable the debug mode and copy the sql error here?\nAdd define('DEBUG', true); to the file config.php, that enable debug output to data/debug.log\n. Do you have the sql query in your debug.log file?\n. Finally I found the bug, it happen when you delete a subtask and change the position after that.\nIt's fixed in the master branch.\n. Is it a new installation or an update of Kanboard? if it's a new installation try to drop and create again the database.\n. No answer -> closed.\n. There is now web notifications for that in master.\n. The webhook system have been changed in the current development branch. Now, all internal events of Kanboard are sent to a webhook url if defined. That will be part of the next stable release.\nThe doc is here: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/webhooks.markdown\n. In your case, you can synchronize comments now.\n. The date is not translated on the budget view\n. Should be fixed in master.\n. Actually, I test only with Postgresql 9.4.\nIf you cannot upgrade Postgres, you can try to modify the code to make it work. The only place with a IF NOT EXISTS is the schema version table used by PicoDb. So by creating manually the table and commenting the line that should work. \n- https://github.com/fguillot/picoDb/blob/master/lib/PicoDb/Driver/Postgres.php#L42\n- CREATE TABLE schema_version (version SMALLINT DEFAULT 0)\n. Teams have been implemented in the development branch. You could test this feature and report potential bugs if you would like to.\n. Actually, I test the postgres version only with Postgresql 9.4. I don't test with all possible versions.\nThe column end is escaped with double quote: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/app/Schema/Postgres.php#L272\nIt's weird because quoted identifiers seems to be supported since a long time, at least since 8.2 http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/static/sql-syntax-lexical.html\nWhat version of Kanboard do you use?\n. @vsadriano I just tested the current master with a standard Ubuntu 14.04 and with Postgresql 9.3, that should be ok. If you have a blank page that means there is something else wrong, probably a php error a missing extension... check your error logs.\n. It's now available in the development branch.\n. Sending a task by email is now available in Kanboard 1.0.40. I'm sorry but I didn't see any improvements, renaming $rq doesn't change anything.\n. I renamed the class to TaskAssignColorColumn to be more specific.\n. What is the use case for that?\n. If you want to redesign Kanboard or to create a theme, you can use a plugin to do that (only with the development version at the moment).\nMore information here:\n- https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/doc/plugins.markdown\n- https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-example-theme\n- https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-example-css\n. Duplicate of #426 \n. Closing this ticket due to inactivity and lack of interest by the community.. With KB 1.0.25, when you can create a new project from another one. So it's like having templates.\n. Thanks, I fixed the typo.\n. @GrCOTE7 C'est un projet open source, tout le monde peut contribuer, il faut seulement respecter la philosophie du logiciel (rester simple). Un point de d\u00e9part serait peut-\u00eatre de jeter un coup d'oeil \u00e0 la doc pour les contributeurs: http://kanboard.net/documentation/contributing\n. @ArnaudAtlog Malheureusement, le logiciel \u00e0 pour vocation de rester simple et le nombre de fonctionnalit\u00e9s est volontairement limit\u00e9. Il reste la toujours le champ de description pour y mettre plus de d\u00e9tails.. See master.\n. The issue have been fixed in the development version. It was a PHP 5.3 compatibility issue.\nIf you don't want to wait the next stable version, you can apply the fix manually, the diff is here: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/commit/8330123f3469ebf963d1d7711fff2bf8b03c97c3\nThanks to report the bug!\n. Thanks, it's merged.\n. I will see how to add this feature by project. Should be easy to implement.\n. It's now possible in the master branch.\n. I merged #782\n. What is the os/php/version on the server? because I use Kanboard with my iPad without any problem.\n. I have to investigate and setup a vm to find the issue.\n. @AlgyTaylor I fixed a couple of bugs about Windows installations, the authentication was broken if you installed kanboard without a subfolder and if you use Internet Explorer. This issue is now fixed in the development version, the fix is here if you don't want to wait the next stable version: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/commit/81841c73c2fd05f3274fa790141aa9b838db9dd3\nI will do more tests on Windows platforms over the next days (Kanboard is mainly used on Linux/Unix servers).\nNote: I'm testing only with IE11, not older versions.\n. By the way, now there is a documentation about the installation on Windows with Apache: http://kanboard.net/documentation/windows-apache-installation\n. There is a burdown chart now in the dev version. For the moment, it's pretty basic but that can do the job.\nHere an example with sample data:\n\n. Yes, correct.\nEach time a task is updated, created or moved, the sum of story points for open tasks are recorded in the database for the given day and for each column. With that graph, you have the sum of points for all columns for each day.\nFor the moment, I want to keep this chart like that. I will see in the future if that need more information.\n. If you change the Javascript don't forget to rebuild assets: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/assets.markdown\n. Sorry about the delay, I will try to review/merge your pull-request this week-end.\n. I don't understand something, what is the purpose of opposite_task_link_id, why do you need to modify the schema? you already have opposite_task_id? That doesn't seems to be used anywhere, only at task link creation...\n. I merged manually your pull-request and changed some stuff:\n- The label grouping looks like your initial ticket #669\n- I removed the schema modification and use the unique index to find the opposite task link\n- The task links in the board tooltips is the same as before, I will see later to show the same table as in the task view...\n. I prefer to keep the table like that for now especially when you have a small screen.\n. There is now a special icon to move task on touch devices to avoid accidental moves.\n. I have to add a stylesheet optimized for print. I never thought that people would like to print the board.\n. I have added a print stylesheet in the development version but you might have some issues with boards with a lot of columns (doesn't necessary fit in the page).\n. Unfortunately, I cannot merge your pull-request, your fork is too old, your are 55 commits behind the current master.\nThe Brazilian translation is almost up to date, check here:  https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/app/Locale/pt_BR/translations.php\nIf you want to add a shadow and rounded corner around the card you are better to use the custom stylesheet, that doesn't require any code modification. By the way, don't modify directly the app.css this file is auto-generated, see http://kanboard.net/documentation/assets.\nThanks.\n. Thanks, it's fixed now.\n. What do you mean by \"programs\", a category?\n. Sorry, I prefer to keep Kanboard simple so this feature won't be developed.\n. The budget feature and the subtask time tracking have been developed for a specific company to fit their workflow. They pay for that and they accepted to give the source code of this feature to the community.\nHowever, it can be improved like you said.\n- Having a start/stop button to record the time spent (mentioned in another ticket)\n- Override the calculated time spent with the value entered in the form\n. It's now the case with the last version.\n. There is now a keyboard shortcut to reset all filters (key \"r\").\n. Currently, when you move a task in the calendar that change the due date and this date doesn't contains any time information. Before it was containing the time, but people complained so I changed that.\n. At the moment, you can also display subtasks time tracking information and subtasks estimates in the calendar (options in settings).\nIn the future, I plan to display more stuff in the calendar. By example, the tasks based on the start and close date or the tasks based on the estimate. Maybe add also a task time tracking...\nIt's a work in progress...\n. Tickets related to the calendar should be posted to the calendar plugin bug tracker: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-calendar/issues\nThank you. Duplicate -> closed\n. I'm sorry but I'm not able to reproduce your issue, can you describe the exact procedure? Do you have any error message?\n. Thanks, it's merged.\n. Don't worry, Kanboard will not become a bloated and a complex software.\nFeatures can be added if:\n- That improve something, by example make the user interface more efficient to use\n- Add a business value\n- Doesn't slow down the software\n- The source code is simple and doesn't bring too much external dependencies\nEverything else should be only improvements of the existing features.\nIf people wants a software very configurable with unlimited options there is Jira for that.\nI don't necessary implement all asked features. Same thing for the cool frameworks or libraries of the moment, I don't care about hipster technologies.\n. @mcbejn I cannot give a date, there is so many stuff to improve and my time is limited. But I agree this feature is interesting.\n. Hi guys,\nI started to implement this feature, at the moment the application is able to parse the Markdown content to detect @user mentions and link that to the profile of the user.\nWhat do you expect from this feature? What kind of notification the mentioned user should receive from a task or a comment?\n. User mentions are now available in the development branch, so you can try the feature and report potential bugs.\n. The first iteration of this feature is available in the new stable version: http://kanboard.net/news/version-1.0.23\n. See #2045\n. What do you mean by nothing? error 500, blank page? nothing in the error log of IIS?\n. You should see the exact error message in the IIS error log files. Maybe there is a php extension not enabled?\n. @diego-betto Thanks for the fix\n@sparkles645 It's now fixed in the development branch, thanks for reporting this issue.\n. Do you run this cronjob: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/cli.markdown#run-daily-project-summaries-calculation ?\n. The data to generate this chart come from the table \"project_daily_summaries\". Each time a task is updated, this table is updated.\nSo, to understand why your graph is not correct, you can check the values for a given date. You have the number of open tasks per column and per day in that table. I can't really analyze the issue without having access to your database.\nIt's more accurate to run the cronjob everyday, because the total will be calculated each day for sure even when nothing change on the board.\nNote: In the dev version there are a couple of changes about that, by example the total will include closed tasks.\n. Can you add the dump of the tables projects and columns so I should be able to regenerate the graph. At least for the project ids 9, 10 and 11. Do you know the project_id of your example?\nI suppose that your backlog column have the id 55, no tasks have been counted for that column.\nit's probably just a problem with the total column, I mean no calculation have been done for the some days.\nTry to run the cronjob just before midnight, after a couple of days the chart should be better.\n. closed tasks were not counted in the total column, now it's the case with the dev version.\n. Yes, I need to add this feature for the next version, at the moment admins can't reset the 2FA for a user.\nTemporarily, you can update the user profile directly in the database, a sql query like that should work:\nsql\nUPDATE users SET twofactor_activated=0, twofactor_secret='' WHERE username=?;\n( replace the username value)\n. It's now possible in the development branch.\n. The \u00ab and \u00bb are the French quotation marks (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillemet). I think they have been copy/pasted from the french translation by previous contributors.\nThe Spanish translation should use the Spanish quotation marks notation: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#Spanish\nI'm not Spanish but I think that should be  \u00ab and \u00bb without spaces according to Wikipedia.\n. The list of users can be very long and I didn't find a proper way of showing that.\n. Thanks for reporting this bug.\nI have done some cleanup/refactoring in the original code because the same issue was happening in subtasks. I also added a couple of unit tests for that.\nThanks again.\n. With the last dev version, you can search inside task description with the attribute description: description:\"my text to find\".\n. Because it might be slower.\n. You can do that in the current development version.\n. Do you have an example of description?\n. If you want me to fix the bug, I need to be able to reproduce the issue...\n. I'm not able to reproduce the issue. I can put your example in the task description or in a comment without any problem. However, the link seems to be broken, the domain name doesn't resolve but that nothing to do with Kanboard.\n. Check the apache/php error logs, you should see the exact error.\n. Thanks, it's fixed in master branch.\n. Yes, it's interesting. The most difficult part seems to build the query parser.\n. The same feature can be used directly on the board. Then the board could display dynamically the result of any query.\nHaving something similar to Github issues (search/filter box) will be very interesting.\n. To some extent, I'm thinking about replacing the filter box that looks like an input field by a search box. And a display mode toggle button. Then it will be easy to display the search result as a list view, a board view or a calendar view.\n. What about using a simple Lexer?\nAfter reading some articles I build a quick and dirty prototype to test the idea:\n``` php\n<?php\nclass Lexer\n{\n    protected $tokenMap = array(\n        \"/^(OR)/\"           => 'T_OR',\n        \"/^(assignee:)/\"    => 'T_ASSIGNEE',\n        \"/^(color:)/\"       => 'T_COLOR',\n        \"/^(\\s+)/\"          => 'T_WHITESPACE',\n        \"/^(\\w+)/\"          => 'T_IDENTIFIER',\n    );\npublic function tokenize($input)\n{\n    $tokens = array();\n    $offset = 0;\n\n    while (isset($input[$offset])) {\n\n        $result = $this->match($input, $offset);\n\n        if ($result === false) {\n            throw new Exception('Unable to parse query');\n        }\n\n        $tokens[] = $result;\n        $offset += strlen($result['match']);\n    }\n\n    return $tokens;\n}\n\npublic function match($input, $offset)\n{\n    $string = substr($input, $offset);\n\n    foreach ($this->tokenMap as $pattern => $name) {\n        if (preg_match($pattern, $string, $matches)) {\n            return array(\n                'match' => $matches[1],\n                'token' => $name,\n            );\n        }\n    }\n\n    return false;\n}\n\n}\nclass Compiler\n{\n    public function build(array $tokens)\n    {\n        $query = 'SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE ';\n        $conditions = array();\n    while (false !== ($token = current($tokens))) {\n\n        switch ($token['token']) {\n\n            case 'T_ASSIGNEE':\n                $nextToken = next($tokens);\n                $conditions[] = 'owner_id = '.$nextToken['match'];\n                break;\n\n            case 'T_COLOR':\n                $nextToken = next($tokens);\n                $conditions[] = 'color_id = '.$nextToken['match'];\n                break;\n        }\n\n        next($tokens);\n    }\n\n    return $query.implode(' AND ', $conditions);\n}\n\n}\n$lexer = new Lexer;\n$tokens = $lexer->tokenize('assignee:me color:blue');\n$compiler = new Compiler;\necho $compiler->build($tokens).PHP_EOL; // SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE owner_id = me AND color_id = blue\n```\nThe lexer parse the query and output all tokens:\n``` php\nArray\n(\n    [0] => Array\n        (\n            [match] => assignee:\n            [token] => T_ASSIGNEE\n        )\n[1] => Array\n    (\n        [match] => me\n        [token] => T_IDENTIFIER\n    )\n\n[2] => Array\n    (\n        [match] =>\n        [token] => T_WHITESPACE\n    )\n\n[3] => Array\n    (\n        [match] => color:\n        [token] => T_COLOR\n    )\n\n[4] => Array\n    (\n        [match] => blue\n        [token] => T_IDENTIFIER\n    )\n\n)\n```\nFrom there, the Compiler class can build a SQL query or use PicoDb to generate the SQL.\nHere are some reading:\n- http://nitschinger.at/Writing-a-simple-lexer-in-PHP\n- http://nikic.github.io/2011/10/23/Improving-lexing-performance-in-PHP.html\n- http://jwage.com/post/31623163785/writing-a-parser-in-php-with-the-help-of-doctrine\nI think this approach still simple enough and it's easier to understand than an external library than generate code from a grammar. What do you think?\n. With both methods you have to build a sql query based on the output array tree (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree).\nIt's always possible to improve the basic Lexer above to parse a subquery with another regex, by example  '/^(\\([^\\)]+\\))/' match everything in parentheses.\nThe thing I don't like is that php-peg generates php code and the result array is hard to manipulate to build the final sql query. I prefer to have less feature, maybe something too simple but with a code that I can understand...\nI will see if I can get some examples from other open source projects. Maybe I'm wrong...\n. Did you make any progress?\nIt's ok if you don't have time, I will try to improve my prototype and make it work in Kanboard...\n. It's rainy today, so I started to implement the \"advanced\" search query. At the moment, it's very alpha, there is only 3 criteria: \"assignee, due and color\", more attributes are coming...\nThe queries are inspired by the search syntax of Github Issue and your proposition. I don't support complex query with OR/AND and parenthesis to keep the code simple.\nYou can do queries like that: assignee:me due:tomorrow color:\"Light Green\" my task title or due:>=2015-07-01 assignee:\"John Doe\" etc... More example in the doc: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/search.markdown\nI will probably change the user interface to have a global search page and see if I can use the same system to filter tasks on the board.\n. This doesn't happen anymore with the last master.\n. I understand your point but not displaying that save some real estate on the card when category are not relevant.\n. You can already do that.\n- Go to Settings > Application > Custom stylesheet\n- Each board have a unique css class \"board-project-ID\", by example \"board-project-2\"\n- So each board can be customized and probably anything in the user interface\n. I added the label \"tips\"\n. Windows permissions management are always funny... Sometimes the issue come from the parent directory.\n. Duplicates #101 \n. You need to have at least 2 days of data to show the graph, is it your case?\n. I cannot reproduce your issue. Did you run a composer install?\nYou can use the nightly build package if you prefer: http://kanboard.net/kanboard-nightly-build.zip\n. This feature have been implemented in the development branch. Since there is a new option to disable automatic account creation for LDAP users, it's relevant to have a way to add remote users.\nRelated documentation:\n- https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/ldap-authentication.markdown#disable-automatic-account-creation\n- https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/user-management.markdown#local-and-remote-users\n. I cannot reproduce your issue. The url that you mention have nothing to do with the search, it's to check if the board have been modified by someone else.\nAre you talking about about the search box on the page ?controller=project&action=search&project_id=ID?\n. It's not a search box, it's just a field to add one or more filters.\nHowever, in the future that will be replaced by a search box as discussed in the ticket #816.\n. I prefer the cookie method because I can make that generic for all tables with sorting. Basically, the last column sorting order used can be stored independently for each table. So each time you display a table your preferred sorting option is used.\n. I don't want to duplicate all feature of tasks into subtasks to keep the software simple.\n. It's now available in the development version, see here: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/api-json-rpc.markdown#getalllinks\n. Issue seems to be solved.\n. Do you have any automatic actions defined that change the color?\n. I do not plan to add such feature. If you really need that, the best way is to contribute.. The auto-completion works with the task number now (master branch).\n. Awesome!\nI added your project to the list of related projects (https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard#related-projects) and I posted a link to your project in the last Kanboard news http://kanboard.net/news/version-1.0.14\n. It's not yet possible with the user interface but you can do it directly in the database if you really want to do it. In the table \"projects\" set the flag \"private\" to the value \"1\".\n. It's now possible in the development branch, see https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/editing-projects.markdown\n. Yep, that coming soon...\n. Basically, that will works like Hipchat and Slack integrations, notifications will be sent to a conference room.\n. It's now available in the master branch, for more information see http://kanboard.net/documentation/jabber\nAt the moment, it's only tested in local with the Prosody XMPP server.\n. That require more changes to the code. But I will see that later, when I will make the notifications more flexible. Because the same feature can be added to Hipchat and Slack.\n. With the last dev version, the jabber integration is now a external plugin and it's possible now to receive individual notifications.\n. See https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-jabber\n. It's now the case in master, you can change the assignee with the keyboard arrows by example.\nThanks.\n. Should be fixed now in the master branch.\n. The migration seems to block in the version 48. Try to run manually the sql queries of the version_48() https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/app/Schema/Mysql.php#L223-L227 then change the version number to 48 in the schema_version table and try to load again kanboard.\nThe migration process run each function one by one and if there is something wrong a rollback is performed.\n. Thanks for the pull-request, It's now merged in master! I improved some part of the code and added some unit tests...\n. Feature requests for budget plugins are here: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-budget/issues. It's too specific to be implemented. But you can add a link in the task description by example: file:///path/to/my/local/folder or file:///c:/path/to/thefile.txt if I understand correctly what you ask for.\n. The budget is based on the user hourly rate and the time spent on tasks, not status.. 1) Generate a new password with the function password_hash() from a PHP >= 5.5 shell:\n``` bash\n$ php -a\nInteractive shell\nphp > echo password_hash('admin', PASSWORD_DEFAULT);\n$2y$10$i1VwOewr1H8NGHisJutM/eFkudRoFjWE2PaTIbEUsphDcbZXgsyG6\n```\n2) Replace the existing password in the database:\nsql\nUPDATE users SET password='replace_me' WHERE username='admin';\n. When you remove a swimlane, all tasks goes to the the default swimlane (swimlane_id=0).\nI just tested on a new installation and that works, do you have any errors or something like that?\n. I added your project into the list of related projects: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard#related-projects\n. I will fix that in the next couple of days to use the application url if defined. Actually that detect automatically the web server url.\n. It's fixed in the master branch.\nThanks to report this issue.\n. It's already possible, see https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/cli.markdown#send-notifications-for-overdue-tasks\nThe only missing part is the configurable time.\n. It's now available in the development version, see here: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/api-json-rpc.markdown#createfile\n. Nope it's not possible. You can probably trick the authentication with a .htaccess and reverse proxy auth...\n. The doc was outdated, I updated the doc...\nThe installation process is not always fully automated and can require some manual configuration in the virtual machine. Adapt the commands according to the distribution...\n. It's weird, I'm not able to reproduce your issue. You should not have &amp; in the url.\n- After installing from scratch the 1.0.14, the redirect from the root folder is correct for me.\n- The redirect_query for expired session is working for me too.\nDo you have any specific settings on your server Apache/php.ini ?\n. Can you override the default php.ini values with a .htaccess?\nphp_value arg_separator.output \"&\"\nor try temporary to change the value in php, by example if you add a config.php file with:\nphp\nini_set('arg_separator.output', '&');\n. FAQ updated for this issue: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/faq.markdown#page-not-found-and-the-url-seems-wrong-amp\n. The event \"task.update\" contains a new field \"changes\" now (in master branch). See https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/webhooks.markdown#examples-of-event-payloads\n. Do you know if your reverse proxy forward authentication information to the php script in another way?\n. Maybe the solution is to have the possibility to use another HTTP header for the authentication.\n. To go trough your reverse proxy, you absolutely need to have a valid end-user account, right?\nWhy not configure your proxy to not handle authentication for the url jsonrpc.php? I don't know if it's possible...\nOtherwise, I have to modify the api to handle another header, by example X-Api-Key: xxxxx. But your api client also need to define a user/password to be authenticated on your proxy.\n. With the last master version, you can use a custom http header for the authentication now. See here https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/api-json-rpc.markdown#custom-http-header\nI don't know if your ruby client is able to do that, but that works with curl.\nOtherwise, since you need to have a valid user to go through your reverse-proxy, just disable temporarily the api authentication until I found a better alternative https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/jsonrpc.php#L7\n. Yep, your example is now included in the doc.\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. It's now fixed in the development branch.\nThe issue was coming from the translation file, the columns \"Ready\" and \"Done\" have been translated with the same word \"Klaar\". So I replaced \"Done\" by \"Afgewerkt\", I hope this translation is good enough (I don't speak Dutch).\nThe fix is there if you don't want to wait the next stable version: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/commit/46e9c1fb2ce969caec85df64b2b1d364e39a149c#diff-fc1530b6f5b1b021a1e37421a89a074dL169\nThanks to to report this issue.\n. The api have been updated in the development version, see the difference here:\n- https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/api-json-rpc.markdown#getactiveswimlanes\n- https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/api-json-rpc.markdown#getallswimlanes\n. The activity stream show only events from logged users.\n. The activity stream is to show actions of users, by example: \"Bob created the task #12\" and with the current api there is no user (no session) linked to the action.\nHowever, in the future I will add a \"user api\" to facilitate the creation of mobile clients, in this case the end-user will be identified in the same way as the user interface.\n. I didn't try yet but according to the library used, TLS should work: https://github.com/fabiang/xmpp#documentation\n. Closing this ticket due to inactivity and lack of interest by the community.. This feature is now available in master. (simplified version without links).\n. Duplicate with #516\n. How long is your filename? can you give me an example to reproduce the issue?\n. This issue have been fixed in the master branch.\nThe file name length is increased to 255 characters for Mysql, it was defined to 50 characters before. If longer than 255, the name will be truncated.\nThanks to report this issue.\n. Thanks to report this issue, it's fixed now in master.\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. With the last development branch, you can import automatic actions from another project.\n. Why not use the task description?\n. Sorry, I prefer to keep Kanboard simple so this feature won't be developed.\n. You can do that with automatic actions, choose the action \"Assign a color when the task is moved to a specific column\".\nIn the development version, the event \"task creation\" have been added in addition to \"move to another column\".\n. I added a logger for the XMPP integration. You have to update to the last master and update the composer dependencies as well. My library is now compatible with PSR-2 and PSR-3.\nYou should be able to see all debug message from the XMPP library.\nIf you would like to redirect the debug messages to stderr or stdout, just add that in your custom config.php:\n``` php\n<?php\ndefine('DEBUG', true);\ndefine('DEBUG_FILE', 'php://stdout');\n```\n. Thanks again for the translations.\n. Yes that happen when you have one or more automatic actions enabled, events fire multiple times.\nThe activity stream will be improved later to be more explicit about the changes made on the task. \n. You can probably use PHPStorm to facilitate the debugging otherwise there is only a debug file like mentioned above.\n. You can simply filter the board by assignee to do that.\n. Yes it's already available in the development branch and that will be released in the next couple of days if I don't find obvious bugs.\n. Are you sure that everything is installed correctly on your server? I cannot reproduce your issue with Win7 and IE11. I will try later with a Windows 8.1 virtual machine...\nYou must see a Javascript error somewhere in the console...\nDo you have the same issue with the demo version of Kanboard, http://demo.kanboard.net/ ?\n. This meta tag is now added in the master branch, thanks.\n. Go to the project settings > Public access > iCal feed\n. You can always send a pull-request.\n. By the way, I'm currently refactoring the notification code to be more flexible...\n. The notifications are more flexible now in the master branch... Don't hesitate to send a pull-request for any possible improvements.\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature, mostly for security reasons. Only files stored in the data folder should be writeable by the web server user.. It's now available in the master branch, the method createFile returns the file_id and doesn't use anymore the parameter is_image.\nSee https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/api-json-rpc.markdown#createfile\n. It's weird I don't reproduce the issue with PHP 5.6.9 on Mac OS... anyway it's fixed in master.\nThanks.\n. The tab index order for task forms is now improved in the master branch. You can switch between form fields in one tab.\n. The parameter is_image is now removed from the api call, it's only used internally to generate a thumbnail.\n. PR #3344 which implement this feature has been merged.. I'm closing this ticket. I let the community develop such feature as plugin.. Thanks, I merged your pull-request.\n. Yes, that works only with anonymous and proxy connections.\n. The CSP rules of Kanboard doesn't allow inline javascript and stuff like eval for security reasons.\n. Your js library seems to use the function eval. It's disabled to avoid potential XSS security issues. If you really need that, you can always adjust the csp rules of Kanboard.\nWhat are you trying to accomplish with that? \n. Which features do you need exactly? do you have any examples with use cases?\nIf the missing features can benefits to everybody, it's always possible to include that in the main version. However, that must respect the \"philosophy\" of the software: keep it simple.\nI already added some \"sponsored features\" in the past. So, it's possible but that should be included in the open source version to avoid maintaining several versions of the software. If you need a quote, you can contact me directly by email fred@kanboard.net\nIf you feel more comfortable to do the development yourself, you can send pull-requests to be merged upstream but if it's really specific to your business you will have to maintain your own fork.\nFinally, that depends of your needs.\nFor your information, the next stable version will be mainly improvements of existing features:\n- More flexible and more accurate notifications\n- Better time tracking\n- Reports\n- Budget section\n. There is a column \"reference\" in the table tasks, you can use that to store external ticket id.\nIt's actually used by the Github/Gitlab webhooks to synchronize issues in Kanboard. The url to the ticket is appended to the task description. The external id is shown on the card if not empty next to the Kanboard task id.\nHow do you load tasks into Kanboard from your external application?\n. I modified the API to facilitate that (only in master branch). Use the field \"reference\" to store your external id (ticket number or whatever, 50 chars max, must be unique for each project).\n1) Create a task with an external reference, here an example of payload:\njson\n{\n    \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n    \"method\": \"createTask\",\n    \"id\": 2094512567,\n    \"params\": {\n        \"title\": \"Task with external ticket number\",\n        \"reference\": \"TICKET-1234\",\n        \"project_id\": 1,\n        \"description\": \"[Link to my ticket](http:\\/\\/my-ticketing-system\\/1234)\"\n    }\n}\nThe url to your external ticket is defined in the description (in markdown format). You can do the same with the method updateTask.\n2) If you would like to fetch this task later with the api, use the method getTaskByReference. See https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/api-json-rpc.markdown#gettaskbyreference\nWith Kanboard the task_id is an autoincrement field, you cannot modify this field.\n. Can you copy/paste the original title here, so I can easily reproduce and fix that bug? Thanks\n. Thanks, it's fixed in the development version.\n. You can use the standard SMTP method with the stable version. With the development version (master branch) you can use directly the Mailgun API, see https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/email-configuration.markdown#mailgun-http-api\n. There is a new stable version approximately every month.\n. I don't know if that answer to your question: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/email-configuration.markdown#how-to-display-a-link-to-the-task-in-notifications\n. I added the link to the board in the notification templates, see an example here: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/app/Template/notification/footer.php#L6\n. There is a Markdown editor now.\n. You should use the method moveTaskPosition() to move the task to another column or position or swimlane. That will trigger the events that update the different timestamps.\nTo enforce that, I changed the method updateTask() in the development version. The arguments column_id and swimlane_id have been removed.\nThanks to report that.\n. I use it everyday and that works for me...\nWhat is your server environment/configuration, how can I reproduce the issue?\n. In the development version, I removed the field \"default_project_id\" because it's useless now. However, when you create a new user, it can be added to a project automatically and you can enable notifications in the same time.\n. Markdown escaping.. see this example of the Markdown parser used by Kanboard: http://parsedown.org/tests/escaping/\n. I downloaded your file from Google Drive then uploaded the PDF into Kanboard and it's ok, everything works for me.\nAccording to your screenshot, there is an error 500 returned by the web server. If you use Apache, you should see the error in the apache log files (error_log). It's probably the only way to see what is wrong.\n. Apparently, cookies doesn't provide isolation by port. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1612177/are-http-cookies-port-specific\nIn your case, you can setup a reverse-proxy configured with sticky session.\n. You can always hide a swimlane with the icon on the left.\n. The option is not there on the public board.\n. Empty swimlanes are not shown anymore in the public view (only in dev version at the moment).\n. phpunit -c tests/units.sqlite.xml tests/units/TaskFinderTest.php\n. Don't use the packaged version, but clone the repo with git to get the development version.\n. As a business, which risks do you have with the AGPL license?\n. I may change the license for the next version because your are not the first one to ask me that.\nBasically, I have been contacted by some large companies that want to try the software but they blacklist any versions of the GPL or AGPL licenses. It's always the same story, they ask if I can offer the software under another open source license or under a commercial license to get the OK from their legal team.\nSince I'm not ready to offer a commercial license (I mean paid licenses) because I prefer to increase the quality of the open source version at the moment. I don't exclude to release an \"enterprise version\" in the future if people ask for that...\nI will probably choose the MIT license because it's sweet and short, but I want to take some time to think about that. Software licensing is not so easy especially when you are not a lawyer...\nIf I compare with open source projects like Gitlab, they use the MIT license and they don't seems to have any problem with that.\n. I switched Kanboard to the MIT license. The next stable release will be distributed under MIT license, probably in the next couple of days.\n@ghostlurker Any feedback for the use of Kanboard in the corporate world is appreciated, that help to improve the software.\n. It's now fixed in the development version with the patch of @crwilliams.\nThanks to report this issue.\n. Thanks, so many bugs fixed in the translations!\n. Yes, it's done in the master branch.\n. See https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/issues/604#issuecomment-107087346\n. The first step will be to enable the debug mode to see where is the bottleneck: http://kanboard.net/documentation/config\nIn the debug file, you will see the time taken for each sql query and the time to render each page, but also the time to send emails.\nActually everything is done synchronously so:\n- Sending email notifications might slow down everything when enabled if your smtp server is slow. Sending an email can take a couple of seconds sometimes. It's the reason I added the support of the http api of Mailgun/Sendgrid/Postmark.\n- You may have a webhook and it take too much time to respond\n- Integrations like Hipchat/Slack/Jabber work in the same way, that contact a external system\nTry to disable/enable each feature that communicate with an external system to see.\nBut which databases are you using Mysql/Postgres/Sqlite? and how many tasks do you have on the board? how many users? Which operating system? if you use sqlite what kind of disk storage is it ssd/sata/nfs mount/network san?\n. I don't really understand how that can happen, the action \"show\" doesn't do any redirection except if you don't have the permission to see to project (forbidden page) or if the project doesn't exists (project not found).\nDo you have an idea how I could reproduce the issue? What is the difference between the project 1 and others? Are you administrator?\n. For the troubleshooting:\n- Be sure that each user have enabled notifications in their profile\n- Be sure that people have defined an email address in their profile\n- Check if the users are members of the project\n- The person that do the action will not receive any emails\n- In the debug file, you can see if there is an error during the process\n- You can try another SMTP settings, see https://support.google.com/a/answer/176600?hl=en\n  By example, you can change the port to 465 instead of 25.\nYou probably need to configure something in Google Apps settings to enable the SMTP access. \nhttps://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255\nhttps://support.google.com/mail/answer/14257\nFinally, just check in the debug file if there is an error message from Google SMTP server, I think they will return the url to their knowledge base.\n. I don't understand the need to have description/comments/due date or whatever for subtasks since you already have that for task? Why not just link tasks together?\nWhat is your use case?\n. Ok, so I close that ticket because that duplicate #176\n. Ticket #371 is about showing subtasks in the dashboard not the board.\nSubtasks are not displayed on the board, however you can see the status of each subtasks with the tooltip when you mouse over the subtasks progress status.\nI don't plan in the future to display subtasks on the board in the same way as tasks.\n. It's not a bug, it's the expected behavior, Javascript code is not loaded in the public view. You can always read the description by clicking on the task title.\n. In master, the task age is now hidden when the board is in compact mode. I don't have better solution right now. Maybe having avatar to save space will solve the issue.\n. I changed that in master, now the board size have the window height and there is individual column scrolling.\nNote: The scrollbar doesn't appear with some os like mac os\n. It's now available in the dev branch.\n. Correct. It's not yet documented because that might be changed/improved.\n- Login with a user that is admin or project admin\n- Go to project management > Users overview\n- Select a user and choose \"open tasks\"\n- You will see the list of open tasks across all projects for this user\n. The subtask timer add time to the time spent (rounded to 15minutes), you can also edit directly the time spent.\n. I cannot reproduce your issue, tested with postgres and sqlite... Just to be sure did you run composer install when you update from the git repo?\n. I fixed an issue related to that: If you define an task estimate or a task spent the subtask timer was not taking into account the existing values for the task.\nExpected behavior:\n- The task estimate will be overwritten only if subtasks have estimate defined (sum of subtasks estimates)\n- The task time spent will be the sum of all subtasks time spent if defined otherwise the existing value is kept\nYou can always disable the subtask timer in the application settings if that didn't fit your needs.\n. Can you please send me the result of the command of SHOW CREATE TABLE comments\\G to see the difference with my own setup?\n. I don't understand why but constraints are missing in your table.\nYou can probably fix the issue manually, by removing the first line of the migration 75 (app/Schema/Mysql.php) see https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/app/Schema/Mysql.php#L23\nAfter the schema migration your table should be similar to that:\nsql\nmysql> show create table comments\\G\n*************************** 1. row ***************************\n       Table: comments\nCreate Table: CREATE TABLE `comments` (\n  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\n  `task_id` int(11) NOT NULL,\n  `user_id` int(11) DEFAULT '0',\n  `date_creation` int(11) NOT NULL,\n  `comment` text,\n  `reference` varchar(50) DEFAULT '',\n  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),\n  KEY `user_id` (`user_id`),\n  KEY `comments_reference_idx` (`reference`),\n  KEY `comments_task_idx` (`task_id`),\n  CONSTRAINT `comments_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`task_id`) REFERENCES `tasks` (`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE\n) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=3 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n. That works for me, this feature works only if the focus is not in a form field.\n. I just changed that in the dev version, it was annoying for me too.\n. Duplicate of #861 \n. Duplicate of #530 \n. Duplicate with #236 \n. I don't test Kanboard on IE9, only IE11, Chrome, Safari and Firefox.\n. The same feature have been implemented in master but differently.\n. Sorry to answer so lately to your pull-request, but the shortcut \"b\" is already assigned to the board switcher and you should not build url in the Javascript code.\n. What is the purpose of that? use case?\n. At the moment, the ical feed export only tasks between -1 month to +2 months from today. If you have tasks older than 1 month they are not exported, is it your case?\n. I increased the date range, now it's -2 months to +6 months from today and updated the doc.\n. I merged manually your pull-request and improved the condition.\nThanks.\n. At the moment, there is nothing to migrate a sqlite db to mysql or postgres. \n. Merged, thx\n. The iCal feed contains tasks in the range -2 months to +6 months. See https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/app/Controller/ICalendarController.php#L92-L93. Anyone can write a plugin for that.\n. I implemented the solution B in master.\nFor projects you will have the urls of the board, calendar and the list view: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/api-json-rpc.markdown#getprojectbyid\nFor tasks: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/api-json-rpc.markdown#gettask\n. Instead of using task links, why not build something just for managing milestones?\nI look at several software and I like the simplicity of Github issue. You can create a milestone with a name, description and a due date. Any issue can be part of a milestone.\nIf we apply the same thing to Kanboard, milestones can be a new section, tasks associated to a milestone can come from any project. That allow us to display milestones differently on the calendar or in a probable future Gantt diagram. All milestones can be displayed easily on a single page so you got a roadmap view.\nJust an idea.\n. For me, managing milestones with links seems to be a workaround because you apply a different behavior to link marked as \"milestone\".\nPeople are able to rename the link labels or remove completely this kind of links from the settings page, and don't forget that link label are translated. So if someone remove all default link labels and create new ones, you got unexpected behavior because you assume that the id 9 is a milestone: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/pull/1009/files#diff-a804d0f2e444a8643d7763ccdae3dc9dR36 The end-user will not necessary understand why there is a different behavior for that kind of links.\nUsing a different data model for milestones can offer more flexibility in the future while remaining simple. Because a milestone is almost the same thing as a sprint, so you can easily attach some stats to your milestone/sprint such as the velocity or burndown chart. You can also display a progress percentage like Gitlab milestones etc. Basically, it's just a new table with 3 or 4 columns and new column \"milestone_id\" in the table tasks. The order of tasks can be the same order as in the board.\nFor the Gantt chart, add a new column \"estimate_start_date\" in the task table and reuse the \"estimated_time\" field, order the task by column/position and that's it. For the ui, I found this jquery plugin that can be easily improved https://github.com/thegrubbsian/jquery.ganttView\nSo let me think about that...\n. Closing this issue, I think you made your own plugin.. If you move a task from a project with no swimlane to a project with swimlanes, the default swimlane will be assigned to the task. If the default swimlane is disabled/hidden, you will see nothing on the board.\nI will try to implement #973 before the next release to improve usability.\n. It's now available in master, see http://kanboard.net/documentation/duplicate-move-tasks\nLet me know if you found any bugs.\n. I added the previous/current value.\n. Here an example if you would like to use the SMTP of Mailgun:\nphp\ndefine('MAIL_TRANSPORT', 'smtp');\ndefine('MAIL_FROM', 'the mailgun configured sender email');\ndefine('MAIL_SMTP_HOSTNAME', 'smtp.mailgun.org');\ndefine('MAIL_SMTP_PORT', 465);\ndefine('MAIL_SMTP_USERNAME', 'the mailgun email address');\ndefine('MAIL_SMTP_PASSWORD', 'your_mailgun_password');\ndefine('MAIL_SMTP_ENCRYPTION', 'ssl');\nOr use their HTTP API (faster than SMTP):\nphp\ndefine('MAIL_TRANSPORT', 'mailgun');\ndefine('MAILGUN_API_TOKEN', 'key-XXXX');\ndefine('MAILGUN_DOMAIN', 'your mailgun domain.tld');\ndefine('MAIL_FROM', 'your mailgun sender email address');\nIf something is doesn't work, enable the debug mode and check the log file.\n. It's now in the master branch.\nThanks for the suggestion.\n. Thanks, I fixed the typo in the development version.\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. Can you give an example?\n. Ok, I understand now, you didn't mention it was for the budget the first time.\nThe budget is based on the \"subtask timer\" table at the moment, this why it's not affected but that can be improved.\n. I changed that in the current development version.\n. With the version 1.0.25 you can choose your preferred date time format in application settings.\n. Closing duplicate.\n. This feature is available in the dev version.. Are you running the cronjob to calculate the stats everyday?\n. I changed x axis to category instead of timeserie in the master branch. That should fix this issue.\n. The color_id can be anything, that don't need to match any \"standard\" color name. Especially, if I add a color picker in the future.\nAdding a new api procedure to get colors is probably the best solution.\n. New API procedures available in master:\n- https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/api-json-rpc.markdown#getdefaulttaskcolors\n- https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/api-json-rpc.markdown#getdefaulttaskcolor\n- https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/api-json-rpc.markdown#getcolorlist\nAnd task properties contains a new item \"color\" with all color details of the task.\n. This feature have already been completely changed in the current development version.\nNow you have a global search for all projects and a search/filter box for board/calendar/list view. Here an example:\n\n. Feature requests for the budget plugin is there: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-budget/issues. Closing this ticket due to inactivity and lack of interest by the community.. Thanks, it's fixed in master.\n. Unfortunately, the number of features is voluntary limited otherwise the software will become too bloated. I cannot make a software that fit with the needs of everyone around the world.\nIf someone still interested by that, there is a custom role feature now and this system could be extended. Do not forget that Kanboard is a free and open source software.. Thanks to report this issue, it's fixed in master.\n. Basically, you would like to have the assignee dropdown and the estimate field on the form under the subtasks list, right?\n. It's now part of the dev branch.\n. That also works for me, basically you just have to copy and paste the Slack webhook url into Project settings > Integration > Slack.\nIf that really don't work and you think everything is configured correctly, enable the debug mode, and check what happen in the debug file, you should see the response of the API call sent to Slack.\n. The news posted on the website are not enough? http://kanboard.net/news/version-1.0.16\n. I added a simple changelog file in the repo that will be added to the next stable archive: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/ChangeLog\n. The swimlane layout has been changed in master, column headers are not duplicated anymore.\n. @gmalone Tags will be available later, just be patient, there is so much things to improve, thanks for the donation :)\n. I keep your pull-request on hold because some changes about groups will be probably made in the future. It's not yet completely defined, but a new group at the application level called \"super users\" or \"managers\" might be introduced. Basically, the same thing as admins except that cannot change the application settings.\n. There is now a new group call \"Project Administrator\" in the dev version just for that.\nSee https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/user-management.markdown\n. That doesn't seems to work for me, at least on Google Chrome and Firefox. If I understand correctly your pull-request, the background color of the dropdown should be the selected color.\nThe css style should be applied on the select element when the value is changed, not the option?\n. Ok that seems to work only on Windows platform.\nThe form helper have been modified that means all dropdown of the application will have a useless option element with a class \"color-ID\" that doesn't exists.\n. I changed the color selection in the development branch to use something that works on all platform: \n\n. You have to create a new extension to Parsedown (Markdown parser used by Kanboard).\nYou will probably need to touch this file: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/app/Core/Markdown.php\n. It's updated in master.\n. Now there is a filter for recently updated tasks in master: updated:recently or modified:yesterday etc...\nYou can also combine multiple filters together: assignee:\"Bob L'\u00e9ponge\" updated:recently column:\"Work in progress\".\n. Can you make a separate pull-request for the task milestone view and the dropdown menu? that will be easier to review. Thanks.\n. Actually, it's translated.\nThe function t() is used: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/app/Template/task/changes.php#L28 and the translation is there: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/app/Locale/fr_FR/translations.php#L911\n. Anyone that speak German can update the translation file.\nApparently the translation is there is the development version: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/app/Locale/de_DE/translations.php#L909\n. I just tested with my own installation and that works for me.\nJust in case, are you sure that the webhook url is correct? a slash seems to be missing: http://www.mydomain.tld/kanban?controller... should be http://www.mydomain.tld/kanban/?controller...\n. There is now a settings option to exclude or include closed tasks in the CFD.\n. I tried multiple times with the data you provided but I was unable to reproduce the error.\n- What version of Kanboard are you using, 1.0.16 I suppose?\n- What database do you use Sqlite, Postgres or Mysql?\n- Apparently you installed Kanboard on a windows server, what version of php do you use?\n. I finally reproduced the bug and it's now fixed.\nThere were 2 entries in the table for the same subtask and user, and Postgres was the only database to complaint with the error \"more than one row returned by a subquery used as an expression\". Postgres is definitively stricter and better than other databases.\nThanks to report this issue!\n. This automatic action is now available in the development branch.\n. This plugin allows you to import any Github Issues: https://kanboard.net/plugin/github-frontend. OAuth2 authentication implementation have been changed in the last development version. Issues like these should not happen anymore.\n. Duplicate of #1019. I tried with Chrome and Firefox 39 on Mac OS, that works for me, I will try later with Windows.\n. I reproduced both issues and it's fixed now in the master branch.\nThis feature is hack around the contentEditable element, so it's not perfect, that still a workaround.\n. I started to implement this feature in the development version.\nDoc: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/doc/ldap-group-sync.markdown\nAt the moment, only Kanboard groups (Admins, Project Admins, Users) are defined according to the LDAP groups. I tested only with Active Directory for now...\n. This feature is now available in the latest stable version: http://kanboard.net/documentation/ldap-group-sync\n. With the last development branch, there is now \"web notifications\" similar to Github and instead of receiving emails you have a list of notifications in the user interface. Then you can mark everything a read...\n. Email attachements are now supported for all email plugins (Mailgun, Sendgrid and Postmark). You have to use the latest version of each plugin, and at least Kanboard v1.0.39.. It's fixed in master. Thanks.\n. The doc have been updated.\n. I setup this morning an automated build on Docker Hub, try this image:\nbash\ndocker pull kanboard/kanboard\ndocker run -d --name kanboard -p 80:80 -t kanboard/kanboard:latest\nEverything is ok for me...\nThe doc have been updated: http://kanboard.net/documentation/docker\n. Thanks for your contribution, Kanboard is now translated into 19 languages!\n. Yes, it was fixed in the development version.\n. It's working for me, I also tested with the online demo, can you describe what is not working exactly in user calendar? How can I reproduce your issue?\n. Only tasks assigned to you will appear in your user calendar, is it the case?\n. Even with mysql, I didn't reproduce the problem.\n. I added a loading icon to indicate to the user that something is loading. And fixed the \"rapid switching\", that will have no effect, I mean the browser will not reload the page again if it's already trying to download the page.\n. I added new config parameters for that in the development branch:\n- https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/config.markdown#rememberme-authentication-settings\n- https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/config.markdown#session\n. There is now a settings to disable that.\n. Settings > Project Settings > Trigger automatically subtask time tracking\nor\nPr\u00e9f\u00e9rences > Param\u00e8tres du projet > D\u00e9clencher automatiquement le suivi du temps pour les sous-t\u00e2ches\n. Yes, this issue have been fixed in the development branch.\n. I don't really have time to develop this feature. If you really need that, the best way is to contribute.. Issues related to Gitlab should be posted here: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-gitlab-webhook/issues. What is not working exactly? are you sure that the settings you entered are correct? did you enable the debug mode like described in the troubleshooting section?\n. I don't really understand what you mean, there is no chat client in Kanboard, you have to use any Jabber client. Adium is just a jabber desktop client among many others.\n. You should try the new plugin system in the dev version. You can override almost everything. Let me know if something is missing that will be added over the time.\nhttps://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/doc/plugins.markdown\n. It's already there, see http://kanboard.net/documentation/rss\n. It's implemented here: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/app/Integration/Smtp.php#L55-L67 by using the library SwiftMailer.\n. According their documentation, the support of OAuth for Github Enterprise will be removed in November 2015: https://help.github.com/enterprise/2.2/admin/guides/user-management/using-github-oauth/\n. It's now possible to define custom urls for Github OAuth (in dev version only).\nSee https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/github-authentication.markdown#github-entreprise\n. It's now available in KB 1.0.25.\n. This automatic action is available in master (\"Close after X days in a specific column\") . See #2388 \n. It's now in master. The user and category dropdown populates the filter field automatically.\n. This view doesn't exists anymore in the last version of Kanboard. In the user calendar, you can see only projects where you are member.\n. Closing this ticket due to inactivity.. The height of the placeholder is now adjusted automatically.\n. It's now fixed in master.\n. What is telegram? https://telegram.org/ right?\n. I'm closing this ticket. I let the community develop a Telegram plugin.. The link was wrong and the documentation not updated. It's now fixed in the development branch.\nTo see closed tasks, just use the filter dropdown next to a search form and choose \"closed tasks\".\nThanks to report this issue.\n. Yes, when you enter an integer only that will search by task id and not by task title.\n. This behavior have been modified in the dev version. Now, if you enter an integer only that will search in task id but also in the task title.\nSee https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/search.markdown#search-by-task-id-or-title\n. Did you check if Github really call your web server? check the access log files of your web server, you should see the http request made by Github..\n. Open the developer tools in Chrome or Firefox and check the network tab to see what is going on.\n. I fixed a regression related to that a couple of days ago: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/commit/2eeb58ae0321f584652714080649302c3f83a831\nYou can try to apply the fix manually that should resolve your problem while waiting the next release.\n. I changed the color picker in master, that looks like that now:\n\n. It's not implemented.\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. You are both right, this bug have been fixed here: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/commit/2eeb58ae0321f584652714080649302c3f83a831\n. Did you check the timezone configured in Kanboard? by default it's UTC. Don't forget that Kanboard use the server time and not your machine time.\n. Sorry about my last comment I misread your issue. Yes, the time format is set to \"24h format\", that will be changed. It's a duplicate of ticket #982.\n. The \"Done\" column is just a title that can be changed at any time, if you don't want to close the task use a more specific filter in the search box.\n. Not yet available, in the meantime you can export the tasks in CSV and sum the column time spent/estimated.\n. It's now fixed in master. Thanks.\n. Yes, it's already reported here #1070 and #1075 and fixed here https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/commit/2eeb58ae0321f584652714080649302c3f83a831\n. There is no priority per project.\n. Sorry, I prefer to keep Kanboard simple so this feature won't be developed.\n. Did you check the apache error log to see if you have more details?\n. That may be related to your Apache settings, pretty hard to help without more details about your setup.\n. Are you sure that it's related to seamonkey? please provide more details about your setup to be able to troubleshoot something.\n. The issue is related to your server configuration, check if mod_rewrite is enabled and if you have the option AllowOverride All for the document root.\n. That works for me, please provide more details that will help to see if there is a bug with a specific environment...\n. It's available.\n. It's was already reported and fixed, see https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/issues/1063\nThanks\n. I will update the doc when I will have 5min to test with nginx.\n. This config is working for me: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/doc/nice-urls.markdown#nginx-configuration-example\n. That works for me, please provide more details if you need help...\n. It's now the changed in the master branch.\n. This feature doesn't exists at the moment. See ticket #1027\n. Duplicate with #236 \n. It's available.\n. Please provide details, examples/use cases... you speak Chinese for me.\n. Some people use the complexity field for that.\n. Closing this ticket due to inactivity and lack of interest by the community.. If you follow this documentation that should work: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/centos-installation.markdown#centos-7\n. 1. Check if php is correctly installed: create a phpinfo.php file with <?php phpinfo(); ?> and open it in your browser, that must works\n2. Check that DirectoryIndex directive in your Apache is correctly configured\n. You have now the \"open file\" translation in master.\n. It's the expected behavior at the moment. The columns are the height of the window. I didn't found better solution right now when using multiple swimlanes. Maybe I should set a max height...\nIt's not related to the \"hide column\" feature but to the individual vertical scrolling of columns and the fact that before a horizontal scroll-bar was in the middle of the screen when there is no task.\n. For the \"horizontal scroll-bar was in the middle of the screen\", see #949 (not really visible on Mac).\n- The goal is to have individual scrolling for each column and fix #949 in the same time, this why there is a column height now, when you have only one swimlane that works fine\n- Now, this approach needs to be improved when using multiple swimlanes, so I will probably set a max column height if there are only X (10) number of tasks in a column by example...\n. I changed that now.\n. @kingfisher77 just changed that in master\n. Merged with #2650 . There is already one automatic action to set automatically the start date?\nhttps://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/automatic-actions.markdown#i-want-to-set-the-start-date-automatically-when-the-task-is-moved-to-the-column-work-in-progress\n. Your code is too hard to review, spaces have been added/indentation changed...\n. These features are available.. It's now available on listing views.\n. Duplicate with #419 \n. Thanks for your contribution, Kanboard is now translated into 21 languages!\nI get some issues with the file encoding since everything have to be utf-8 encoded, after tweaking the file everything seems ok.\n. It's already reported and fixed, see #1080\n. - That never worked with Safari since beginning, if someone have a workaround...\n- You are right, it's broken at the moment with Firefox 40.0 on Mac OS, I will try to fix that in the next couple of days\n. - It's now fixed in master for Firefox 40.\n- This feature doesn't work with Safari due to this bug in webkit: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49141\n. Example? How to reproduce your issue? What is the exact problem?\n. If you enter something like tcp://jabber.example.office:5222 that should work. What is the issue exactly? error message?\n. - Do you have any php error visible in your log files?\n- Can you open the database with the sqlite3 command and read the data?\n- Are you using a low cost shared-hosting provider? if yes, are they using NFS to store your files?\n. Your issue seems to be related to your installation and not Kanboard.\n. Both issues you have mentioned are fixed in the dev branch. The progress is rounded and task closed are shown now.\nThe Gantt chart feature is not yet ready, the development still in progress.\nThanks.\n. Duplicate with #1055\n. This feature is not available, you can only configure what is described on this page: http://kanboard.net/documentation/notifications\n. It's now fixed in master.\n. It works for me with Firefox/Safari/Chrome/Internet Explorer under Mac OS and Windows.\n. It's v then c or v l, v b (do not press both keys in the same time)\n. The keyboard shortcuts you have mentioned above will work only where the \"view switcher\" is present. That will not work on the dashboard.\n. Did you try to define the url in settings > application url?\n. The error message is related to Apache and not Kanboard.\n. I already plan to have the documentation embedded into Kanboard itself.\n. The doc is now part of Kanboard.\n. If it's not required anymore, I closed it.\n. In the current development version a new role \"Project Admin\" have been introduced to solve this issue. It's a group to allow people to create multi users projects but they cannot change application settings.\n. I reproduced your issue and it's now fixed in master.\nThanks for reporting that.\n. Closing this ticket due to inactivity and lack of interest by the community.. Do you have anything in the Apache error log?\n. Already fixed, see #1064 \n. Which version of Kanboard are you using?\nIf you are using the last dev version, it's normal I removed the touch features to avoid accidental moves until I found a better solution.\n. There is now a special icon to move task on touch devices to avoid accidental moves. At the moment, this is only solution I found to be compatible with column scrolling, jquery sortable and touch events.\n@n1trux it was the first solution I tried but that was not working with individual column scrolling\nIf someone have a better solution, send a pull-request :)\n. Only open tasks are displayed/counted on the dashboard. This is the expected behavior.\n. The pull-request will be accepted if you respect the same logic as the existing code base. I think that should be similar to the project/column/category descriptions (display that in a tooltip).\n. Add a new migration: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/tree/master/app/Schema\n. Add the missing part to the existing pull-request if possible.\n. It's merged. Thanks\n. It's now possible in the development branch.\n. It's now fixed.\nThanks\n. If anyone is interested by this feature, feel free to implement a plugin.. It's now available in the master branch.\n. Are you using Windows? which browser?\n. This issue is fixed in the development branch. (tested only with IE11 at the moment)\n. Unfortunately, the number of features is voluntary limited to keep the software simple and that doesn't seems to be used by a lot of people.\nI don't even know how to setup a development environment to implement such feature. If anyone feel confortable to develop a plugin, contributions are welcome.. The last development branch allow multiple projects with the same name.\nSee the ChangeLog for more info: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/commit/adb35896d8c5bcc6673188921868e472ba35278e#diff-02f0b547c2779d25cff89672135f20e3R6\n. Did you set a slash at the end for the application url in settings?\n. You don't need to have a trailing slash for the ServerName in your Apache config. I was talking about the Kanboard configuration: settings > application > application url.\n. In the meantime, you can always write a simple script that poll regularly emails from your imap server and then call the api of Kanboard.\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. Yes, and what is the problem with that?\n. There is a toggle switch now in the dev version.\n. At the moment, there is no webhook for task link event.\n. This is now available in development branch.\n. It's very nice but I think that would be a good candidate for a plugin. In the current development branch, there is a very first version of a plugin api and I started to move some features to plugins to have a smaller code base.\nThe plugin documentation is here: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/doc/plugins.markdown\nTo add the menu is the sidebar, you can use the hook \"template:task:sidebar:information\" and the rest of the code can be moved easily.\nThere are some plugin examples here: https://github.com/kanboard/\n. It's fixed in the dev branch. That needs to be tested with several browsers but that should be ok.\n. With the last version, you can change the position of the columns by drag and drop.\n. Activate the debug mode to see if there is any error message in the log files. Did you link successfully your user account? the error is happening only at the login?\n. I think you have the same issue as the ticket #1179 \n. It's already there for the \"projects gantt chart\", but not the \"task gantt chart\".\n. It's already there:\n\n. At the moment, there is no event for deleted comments.\n. This is now the case with the current development version.\n. Which OS and browser is it?\n. It's fixed in the development branch. The scrollbar doesn't appears anymore on Windows.\n. Duplicate with #1113 \n. The dropdown menu has been improved (in master):\n\n. If you update KB, the horizontal scrollbar will appear only if horizontal scrolling is enabled, in compact mode that should not be visible.\n. Duplicate with #1153 \n. An issue related to Gitlab Auth have been fixed 2 days ago, a typo in external accounts template page prevents the link to be displayed.\nSee this commit https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/commit/a6f6790d085d3477b9e7f1ba20abd4a051439d2d for the fix (basically rename GITHUB_AUTH to GITLAB_AUTH. That should work after changing that.\n. - With the last dev version, Gitlab OAuth works only if you have enabled url rewriting (nice urls).\n- Gitlab doesn't seems to support callback url with query string parameters as mentioned above.\nSince it's not anymore a Kanboard issue I close this ticket.\n. @waja it's already there: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/doc/gitlab-authentication.markdown#known-issues (the doc will be synced with the website for the next release).\n. This issue is not related to Kanboard but to your PHP configuration.\nKanboard doesn't use $HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA. You should modify your php.ini with 'always_populate_raw_post_data' to '-1'.\n. users and categories dropdowns append the filters now instead of replacing evrything\n. +1\n. I'm busy to improve something else, if you want to send a PR, let me know how you want to implement that before to start coding it.\n. @BlueTeck sounds good\n. Duplicate with #1003 \n. See #176 \n. Ok, but you also changed the way to calculate the progress percentage.\n. I merged partially your pull-request to change the bar color based on progress. I will see later how to add an option to choose the progress calculation.\n. I think you have forked the wrong git repository. The version of Kanboard you have in your fork is too old. I cannot merge your pull-request because there are conflicts detected.\nBy the way, someone else already start to translate Kanboard in Dutch. You should update/improve the existing Dutch translations. (https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/app/Locale/nl_NL/translations.php)\n. In the task details, what are the defined start date and the due date? that should be 2th and 4th. Which settings did you use in calendar settings?\n. Tickets related to the calendar should be posted to the calendar plugin bug tracker: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-calendar/issues\nThank you. 10 seconds to move a task, there is certainly a problem. \n- Can you describe your server environment with more details (os,php version,database.., shared-hosting/vps/dedicated server)?\n- Can you enable the debug mode and look at the debug.log file when you move a task. There are all sql requests with timing information.\n- Do you have any external integrations enabled with Kanboard: jabber/hipchat/email notifications... ?\nYes I'm french :)\n. How did you configure email notifications and how many people are receiving the notifications?\nThat took 10 seconds to send one email:\n[2015-09-09 13:56:06] [debug] Email sent in 10.075862 seconds\nThe problem seems more related to your SMTP setup.\n. It's already in the dev branch.\n. I do not plan to add such feature. If you really need that, the best way is to contribute.. Issues related to Gitlab should be posted here: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-gitlab-webhook/issues. Duplicate with https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-gitlab-webhook/issues/16. What kind of authentication did you use? user access or application access? can you give an example of the request your are doing?\n. I just tried with Kanboard configured with LDAP and it's working for me. Both access method are working (user and administrative access).\nWhat happen if you run the curl command in verbose mode and what happen in the debug log?\n. You should try this workaround if you use Apache+php-fpm: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/doc/faq.markdown#authentication-failure-with-the-api-and-apache--php-fpm\n. My guess is the first time the process probably timed out and left the schema creation procedure in inconsistent state. It can happen on low cost and overloaded web hosting providers. Usually that take less than one second to create all tables.\nCan you give more details about your environment? os/php/webhosting provider?\n. There is now an alternative method to initialize the database the first time for Mysql and Postgres. \nInstead of running all schema migrations one by one which can slow down the process, it's possible to import directly the final SQL schema.\nThe procedure is documented here: http://kanboard.net/documentation/mysql-configuration (Section importing SQL dump)\nI think that will solve your issue.\n. This feature is available since a while now.\n. Unfortunately, the number of features is voluntary limited to keep the software simple and that doesn't seems to be used by a lot of people.. As I understand it, it's a duplicate of #426\n. What to you mean by \"doesn't really act the same as the filter on the board\"?\n. Your patch was causing some issues with the rest of the application, so I disabled the margin only for calendars. https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/commit/b16e7d187216b2928611c2312627bcebcf35a2ab#diff-828a8364a616a0c62da41f5a71b8a9e3R10\n. Do not send the minified file, I cannot even see your modification, push the source css file so I can merge your pull-request (same for #1220). Thanks.\n. You can do that now with Kanboard 1.0.25.\n. PR #2587 have been merged.\n. This issue come from the year 2038 timestamp bug: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem\n- If you run php compiled in 32 bits that will fail, you must use the 64 bits version\n- If you use Mysql or Postgres, I increased the size of the columns in the development branch so you can store 64bits timestamps (date > 2038)\nWith the last dev version, you can use Kanboard for another century :)\n. It's already there.\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. If you have time send the PR, I will add the automated tests.\n. Are you using Mysql?\n. It's now fixed in the development branch.\nThanks to report that.\n. You can already link tasks together and use the relation \"is a child of\". Or if you would like to convert a subtask into task it's a duplicate of #873.\n. Now, there is 2 tags for docker images:\n- stable: for the latest stable release\n- latest: for the development version\nBoth images can be downloaded from Docker Hub, see https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/doc/docker.markdown#use-the-stable-version\n. How can I guess? do you have any error, what did you investigate to solve the problem? did you check the log files? are you sure that the problem come from Kanboard and not your environment? what is not working exactly?\n. The best way is probably to put the web server in maintenance mode. It can be done easily with Nginx or Apache.\nUsually, people that are managing the server are the same people who performs updates, backups or any administrative tasks.\nUnfortunately, this is out of the scope for Kanboard at the moment.. Did you check for php errors in log files (apache..) ?\n. Fixed by the pull-request of @ukko \n. With Mysql the field is limited to 255 characters. If you need more than that, you are better to use a plugin (available only with the development version).\nI added an example of plugin to add a new stylesheet: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-example-css\nBasically, it's just a plugin with only one line of code, very easy.\n. I added the fa-fw class in the master branch.\nLet me know if you see other glitch like that.\n. :)\n. 1. Kanboard have to be translated in Farsi (https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/doc/translations.markdown)\n2. Add the Javascript translation in the Makefile (https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/Makefile#L9)\n3. Build the assets like described in the documentation: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/doc/assets.markdown \n. To translate the calendar, you just need to add \"fa\" in the list of files inside the Makefile and rebuild the assets.\nIf you have translated Kanboard in Farsi you can already send pull-request, I will modify the rest.\n. It would be better to add a new search filter by example start:>=date similar to the filter due:today...\n. Closing duplicate.\n. This bug is now fixed in master, the fix is here: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/commit/370361330aeb37f02e87ab78ae38521da774c957#diff-64bf774cdba3c65fdd9d79ba19efe108R96\nOther databases (Mysql and Sqlite) was ignoring silently this error.\nThanks to report that.\n. Issues related to Gitlab should be posted here: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-gitlab-webhook/issues. @nztebs correct, that need to be improved.\n. There is an example here: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/doc/ldap-group-sync.markdown#filter-kanboard-access-based-on-the-ldap-group\n. @mtruijen Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. How can I validate your bug fix? What are the steps to reproduce the issue?\n. If you are able to modify your patch to replace the method argument array $options = null by a flag $fire_events = true that would be great, so I can merge this bug fix. Thanks.\n. It's planned. And maybe later the possibility to upload plugins directly through the user interface.\n. It's now in master.\n. It's now fixed in master.\nThanks\n. Not necessarily, you don't have to guess where the link on the project will redirect.\n. I merged your pull-request. Thanks.\n. yep, It's now in master.\n. The swimlane layout have been changed in the development version, the column headers are not duplicated anymore.\n. - Can you describe with more details how you installed Kanboard? (server, os, php version, database type, hosting provider)\n- When you move a task somewhere else, did you see a loading icon in the bottom right?\n. Hum, maybe a date issue, do you have the same timezone configured in Kanboard settings and in your browser/local machine?\n. Effectively, after using using for a while it's not efficient. To create a task to another swimlane I have 2 more actions to do that I didn't need to do before. So I will change again the user interface, in master we have currently:\n\nSo I will do another change later this week to repeat the column header below each swimlane name.\nFor reference the current layout look like that for the last stable version:\n\nMy initial goal was to remove the space wasted on the left by the swimlane column name.\n@sparkles645 What is your use case to have so many swimlanes and why tags may be a solution for that?\n. I changed again the layout, so now column headers are repeated for each swimlane.\nHowever, I have to keep the column titles at the top for the first swimlane otherwise collapsing column doesn't work (css/html glitch)...\n@jtourt that use a little more space vertically but horizontally you can have more columns.\n. I think the page to add/edit custom filters should also be accessible from the action dropdown menu especially if standard project members are allowed to add filters (they don't not see the settings link).\nExcept the of comments on the code that sounds good.\n:+1: \n. I just changed that in the dev version.\nThanks.\n. I see more people doing the opposite, they import the Kanboard iCal feed in their preferred calendar software.\n. Closing this ticket due to inactivity and lack of interest by the community.. For new integrations, it would be better to create plugins after the next stable release.\n. Closing this ticket due to inactivity and lack of interest by the community.. Task links do not open anymore in a new tab on the Gantt chart views. (master branch)\n. With the last development branch, you can import automatic actions from another project.\n. the $reset variable is defined here https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/app/Template/project/filters.php#L64, you can replace the value by the one you want and remove it completely...\nBut the pull-request about custom filters will be merged soon, so you will be able to add your own set of filters.\n. With the last master, if you define the value status:all for the $reset variable you will see all tasks (open and close) when you select the menu \"reset filters\".\n. - sqlite: the performances of sqlite still very good especially if you use a ssd hard-drive, you don't have to manage a database server, backup are super easy just a copy and paste the file...\n- mysql: work better if you have a lot of concurrency (lot of users), it's also easier to setup a high-availability system with mysql or postgres...\nI didn't do any real-world benchmark yet but I would say sqlite = small team and mysql = large team. \nOtherwise it's just matter of personal preferences and deployment constraints.\n. It's not a bug, if you have a project with no swimlanes other than the default, and if you choose to hide the default swimlane there is nothing to show on the board anymore. That will not hide the column from the list view.\nHowever, the checkbox to disable the default swimlane should not be shown when there is no other swimlanes created to avoid confusion.\n. The concept of default swimlane has been removed in Kanboard 1.0.40. The layout of the list view has been changed as well.. The url displayed will use the value entered in the field \"application url\" otherwise if empty that will guess the url from the information provided by the web server. So check the defined value for the application url.\n. The trailing slash is now added automatically since a while.\n. Spark seems to be a XMPP client, there is already a plugin for Jabber?\n. I just added direct links to the list and gantt chart in both pages. (only in master at the moment)\n. I added a new config parameter in the dev branch to disable syslog. Changing this settings to false should avoid any code change.\nDoc Link: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/doc/config.markdown#logging\n. You can link tasks together across projects, all links are displayed in a tooltip on the board, maybe that can fit your need? or I misunderstand your request...\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. With recent versions of Kanboard, you can move task without drag and drop (accessible in the task view).. This issue has been fixed in the development branch.\nThanks.\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. Linking this ticket with #439 \n. I tested with Chrome Version 45.0.2454.101 (64-bit) and I didn't see any issue?\nKanboard doesn't use inline Javascript by the way.\n. @BlueTeck can you update your pull-request according to the comments of @nochso, thanks.\n. cool :) I will post a news on the website\n. Just posted a news: http://kanboard.net/news/framaboard\n. The translation file is badly encoded, it need to be converted in utf-8 to see special characters like \u00f8 correctly without to have to use html entities.\n. I converted the file master and now it works.\nThanks to report this issue.\n. @CoMPaTech Nice! I didn't even know that html2canvas existed.\n. If you really need that, the best way is to send a PR.. You can enable the debug mode, but at the moment there is not so much information about ldap sent to the log files (only connection error or missing php extension).\n. I added more debug info in the logs...\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. Sorry, I'm closing this issue, seems too complex and no body up-vote.\n. Unfortunately, the number of feature in Kanboard is voluntary limited. You could develop a plugin for your own needs.. I just changed that in the development branch. Now, duplicated tasks will be copied in the same column.\nThanks.\n. There is no configuration for that at the moment. It's probably too specific to your use case.\n. A new record is created in the transitions table only if a user session is opened.\nA user session is opened only when someone is using the user interface or when someone is using the api with it's own username/password (not when you are using the \"admin\" api access).\nThe reason is the transitions table contains the person who does the action (Executer).\n. I just added this feature in the dev version: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/doc/config.markdown#http-client-proxy\nThe next stable release will include that.\n. There is no column scrolling anymore.\n. I added this feature in the development branch. The same thing will be added to import tasks.\nAt the moment, it works but it's not yet tested with all major spreadsheet software (Excel, LibreOffice, Numbers, Google Docs...). That will be the case when the tasks import will be implemented.\n. @froschdesign It's just a basic CSV import, if people need something more complex like importing a Excel spreadsheet (*.xlsx) that should be a plugin or a separate script.\n. @froschdesign Why CSV import is part of the core? because several people are switching from one software to another one (KB) and providing an easy way to import existing tasks or users allow them to trying out the software quickly without having to search for external plugins. And it's not really a big deal for the CSV import at the moment, I can move that to a plugin very easily later if I change my mind.\nI already planned to move all existing integrations to plugins but before doing that I want to provide a better plugin API for the authentication, notifications, etc. Iterations after iterations the core becomes better.\n. Thanks, I fixed that.\n. The problem with your pull-request is your are calling continuously the method moveDown until that return false. That will generate a lot of SQL queries. There is probably a more efficient way to do that.\n. In the development version, column positions can be changed by drag and drop now, there is no moveUp/Down anymore.\nThanks for your contribution.\n. I added a new method to override the default CSP rules: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/doc/plugins.markdown#override-http-content-security-policy\nNote: the plugin api is not complete, it's the first draft, if something is missing it can easily added.\n. If I understand correctly, you have by example these boards:\n- CMS for customer X\n- CMS for customer Z\n- Package A\n- Package B\nThe customer X want a new feature but that involve a development in the package B, you would like to have one task in the board for the customer and the same task in the board of the package like that:\n- CMS for customer X\n  - Task 1: New feature Y\n- Package B\n  - Task 2: New feature Y\nThe task properties will be the same between the 2 tasks board (time tracking and position). Basically, it's like \"synchronizing\" the 2 tasks properties or having a single task attached to multiple projects.\nIs my understanding correct? If yes, this feature doesn't exists.\n- You can still use task links to keep track of the request: \"Task 2 on the board Package B is related to the task 1 on the board CMS for customer X\".\n- For the rest, I don't have a better idea at the moment, maybe developing a custom automatic action can do the job of synching the 2 tasks.\n. I just updated the .htaccess recently with a check on mod_version, seems to work with the default configuration of Debian 6/7/8, Ubuntu 14.04 and Centos 6/7.\n. By the way, I released 1.0.19 after you created your message (10 minutes ago).\n. Are you sure that the problem is not related to your server installation/configuration? did you flush the php opcache, close all user sessions? do you have any sort of magic proxy that alter the javascript like Cloudflare or stuff like that?\n. Yup, I was thinking about that, make sense after all. I will do the crazy search and replace.\n. This change have been made to the development branch.\n. @martinfrances107 did you regenerate the composer autoloader?\ngit pull && composer install && service apache2 reload\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. You can already do it: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/doc/search.markdown#search-by-swimlane\n. Nope\n. Why do you need that?\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. You don't need to change the permissions of the .htaccess for this fix.\n. Not yet, but anyone can develop a plugin fo that. Depends on what kind of integration you would like.\n. Closing this ticket due to inactivity and lack of interest by the community.. This is now available in the dev version, time spent and estimated are visible.\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. It doesn't work because that trigger the event task.move.swimlane. That need to be improved or new action may be created to handle that.\n. Won't be part of the core, if someone want that make a plugin.\n. Probably because you have done a composer update instead of composer install. Just revert the file: git checkout composer.lock and check with git status what else you have modified...\n. I cannot reproduce the issue even with a fresh install, did you disable all swimlanes? did you get any error during the execution of schema migrations?\n. This issue have been fixed in the master branch.\nThanks.\n. This issue is now fixed in the master branch.\nThanks to report that.\n. Can you test again with the latest stable version? Thanks.\n. @Chaosmeister Before Kanboard 1.0.19, thumbnails were generated on the fly, now they are generated during file upload. I added a fallback in the master branch for files uploaded before, the thumbnail will be regenerated if missing.\n. You should try again with the latest stable version. Kanboard lowercase the username by default, see: http://kanboard.net/documentation/ldap-parameters\n. If you disable the \"max column height / vertical column scrolling\" as it's seems to be the case in your screencap, the drop zone for the task is the top of the column, the placeholder is the same height as the task. I know that it's something to improve...\nCan you validate that if you enable the \"max. column height\" it works correctly?\n. This issue is now fixed in the dev branch.\n. - Enable the debug mode\n- Open the file data/debug.log\n- You will see the execution time for each SQL query and each HTTP request\n- If the page rendering time is greater than few hundred milliseconds that means something is wrong\n- Most often, that comes from a slow SMTP server when Kanboard is sending notifications or a slow Integrations... Do you have configured anything special in Kanboard?\n. @nekohayo Do you have any Javascript errors in the browser console?\nI don't really test Kanboard with Epiphany but if I remember correctly it's based on webkit so it should work.\n. - The draggable icon you are talking about should be visible only on touch devices. It's a quick and dirty workaround to avoid accidental moves on tablets, otherwise you move tasks if you need to scroll the viewport. I'm aware that it's not the best solution, but that works with Jquery sortable...\n- Now, the detection of touch devices is not very smart because that use only the jQuery helper $.support.touch, but that doesn't take into consideration if your machine is compatible with touch and pointer events. So you may see the icon even on a laptop (I cannot test with all possible devices of the world).\nCan you confirm those assumptions:\n- Running this command $.support.touch in Epiphany browser console returns true\n- Are you using a laptop compatible with touch and mouse events?\n. Ok, I will install a vm with Fedora/Gnome when I will have 5min to investigate.\n. I tested quickly with Epiphany on the last Fedora and the browser indicate that it supports touch events even if I'am on device that doesn't support touch events. I don't know why they have done that, a lot of stuff on the web will probably break...\nNow, the next step is to find a workaround for this issue...\n. It's returning true for me, even 'ontouchstart' in window or other methods are returning true.\n. http://kanboard.net/plugin/wysiwyg\n. Javascript is voluntary not loaded in the public board view. Why do you need to have description tooltip working if the public view? the description still visible by clicking on the task.\n. Need to be rebased.\n. It's now working on Windows with the last master. Thanks.\n. Do you want me to list your plugin on Kanboard's website?\n. See https://www.google.com/search?q=how%20to%20write%20a%20bug%20report&rct=j#q=how+to+write+a+good+bug+report\n. There is no effect, it's just a relation between 2 tasks with a label.\n. I added a check in master that should fix your issue.\n. Do you have any php errors? How is configured your reverse proxy setup? which software do you use?\n. Right\n. Can you check if your issue is solved with the last version of the master branch?\nThanks\n. Awesome :)\nSo I close this issue.\n. There is already a import feature in the development branch.\n. It's already fixed in master.\n. This is the expected behaviour, the dashboard show only open tasks. If you want to see closed tasks, you have to use the search form by using the query \"status:closed\" or if you want to see both \"status:all\".\n. Do you have tasks created in the date range you have specified?\n. Correct, it's based on the creation date.\n. Use the ISO8601 date format: \"2015-10-24\"\n. Note that Gitlab OAuth is working only if you have enabled url rewriting for Kanboard because Gitlab doesn't support url with query string arguments.\n. Gitlab auth have been moved to a plugin now. If you have any problem, open issues here: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-gitlab-auth\n. Teams have been implemented in the development branch. You could test this feature and report potential bugs if you would like to.\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. No\n. Thanks for submitting your pull-request and your patience. If you have time to fix the comments, I will be able to merge your pull-request and do more tests.\n. Closing, PR never updated.\n. It can also be done with a plugin.\n. This feature has been added into the development branch of Kanboard.\nTo make it work, the user must have an email address and Kanboard must be configured to send emails. This feature can also be disabled from the settings page.\n. By default nobody receive notification, people have to opt-in (user profile > notifications).\n. With valid SSL certificates you should not need to modify anything. But you should be able to install the missing certificate on the operating system to avoid manual modification of the application?\nI'm using PHP >= 5.6 on multiple operating systems and I don't have any problem as long as the certificate is valid.\n. There are more application and project roles now: see https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/doc/roles.markdown\n. You can add custom filters with plugins (see class FilterProvider).\n. Can you update the unit test Model\\TaskFilterTest.php?\nI'm not sure if it's really pertinent to search by link id (ex: link:42)? usually people don't know database id, for tasks or projects ok but links...\n. This issue is now fixed in master.\n. In this case it's probably better to add a new column in the export with the full assignee name.\nReplacing the column username by the full name remove a feature that may necessary by other Kanboard users.\n. Now in master, the export show the assignee name and username.\n. Yes, at the moment this settings is stored in the user session not in the database.\n. Available in dev.\n. The error handling of plugins have been improved in master, that will display a better error message now.\nHowever PHP errors still handled by the default PHP error handlers. In your case, your server configuration seems to generate an error 500 and probably output the exact cause in the event logger.\n. If you are talking about the public application url: Settings > Application Url\n. This bug is fixed in master. Thanks.\n. This issue is now fixed in master.\n. This is now available in the development branch.. If session.use_strict_mode is causing an error, you should check your php/server configuration.\n. You can probably do that by using a custom helper or write your own overdue notification.. - Can you confirm that: when the issue is occurring the small loading icon at the bottom right still visible?\n- Can you tell me how many tasks do you have on the board and which database driver you are using?\n- Can you give the duration on the HTTP request (latency) that save the new task position on the board? (Open the Chrome developer console > tab Network > Filter by XHR then move a task and look at the column \"time\" for the http request that contains ...controller=board&action=save...)\nThanks\n. And can you also tell me if you have any integrations configured (smtp server, slack, etc..)\n. Open a new issue if that happens again with the last Kanboard version.\n. - Overriding a template will only replace a default template by a another one, variables passed to a template are not changed.\n- Can you describe what you are trying to accomplish exactly? as you said you would like to add more details in the template app/overview but what kind of information do you want to add? where/how did you fetch this data?\nI can probably improve the plugin api, but I need to understand your use case before.\n. Same as #2109. This is a regression in the last release, that need to be fixed.\n. This issue have been fixed in the master branch.\nThe fix is here: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/commit/2fc402f6733573627ad25394d109b9f848ef04f6\nNote: the proposed fix by @ordilibre is wrong\nThanks to report that.\n. If you have access to Apache error logs, check there to see the exact error message. Otherwise, you have to proceed by elimination to find what is wrong. Try to remove the .htaccess, if it works put it back and find the instructions in the .htaccess that cause the issue.\n. I merged a pull-request that place the notification at the bottom of page.\n. I integrated your PR manually since I have done some code refactoring. Now, you can define the API token in the config file, that will override the one stored in the database.\nThanks.\n. It's regression due to previous refactoring, need to be fixed.\n. This bug is fixed in master.\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. At the moment, it's not possible that some changes in the code. Probably a good idea for a plugin.\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. The values shown by the chart are calculated daily by the cronjob or when you move a task. So, if you have stopped the server no calculation have been made.\nHowever, that should not show negative value, need to be fixed.\n. The negative values are now fixed in master.\n. Edit the subtask then change the time spent value?\n. Can you provide an example because I don't get it, what do you call a \"date stamp\"? which date?\n. Yes, at the moment it's saved in your session not in the database.\n. This now saved into the db.\n. Just by curiosity, can you explain or give an example why you are using a UUID like that? what is the use case? is it something common or very specific to your organization?\n. - If I remember correctly, if you define the constant LDAP_ACCOUNT_ID in your config file you can specify the LDAP attribute used to fetch the username instead of using the last RDN.\n- If you need to store your external uid, instead of changing the database schema, you can add a new user metadata named by example ldap_uid.\nNote: I will probably rewrite the authentication/authorization system in the future to allow people to create authentication plugins. That also means existing alternative authentication backend will become plugins (Google, Github, etc..). And specific database fields like github_id will be moved to user metadata (custom fields). \n. With the last version of the master branch, you must to define the LDAP attribute for the username. So you should not have any development to do, just define the constant LDAP_USER_ATTRIBUTE_USERNAME.\n. @lairdf Check the error log of your web server, you will see the exact problem.\n. Short answer, there is nothing related to Cucumber at the moment.\nJust to have a better understanding, are your talking about https://cucumber.io right?\nIf I understand correctly, you want to use Kanboard to write the spec and then generate/export somehow the Cucumber spec and maintain a sync between the two systems?\n. If anyone would like to develop a plugin for this, do not hesitate to contribute. There are already too many features requests and I prefer to focus on essential features.. Thanks to report this issue, it's fixed in the master branch of the plugin.\n. The selection of projects will be saved only if the checkbox \"Enable notifications\" is selected at the top, is it the case?\n. This issue should be fixed in 1.0.27.\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. Check if Kanboard is installed correctly, some files are probably missing.\n. This a bug in KB, there is no translation available for cs_CZ in full calendar, so that should fallback to english and not show chinese.\n. I fixed this issue in master. The fix is here: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/commit/bf2cf457c34c363918cbd55ae33ccf3f736c9244\n. Your code is not valid and it's breaking the unit tests.\nBy implementing this feature, your are changing the default behaviour of the ReverseProxy authentication method so that need to be documented and disabled by default for existing users of this feature.\n. The documentation have been updated. Thanks.\n. Even if the board is using table html tags, you should be able to scroll horizontally. The current layout is not really adapted for smartphone, developing a native app will be probably better...\nBut if you would like to work on that, you can create a plugin (or a pull-request if that doesn't involve any breaking changes) and override the default layout.\n. Closing this ticket, reopen if necessary.\n. Do you have any automatic actions configured in your project? if yes, which one?\n. I'm not able to reproduce the issue with this scenario:\n1. Configure a user with email notifications\n2. Create a new project\n3. Create some categories\n4. Add automatic actions \"Assign a color based on a category\"\n5. Create new tasks\n6. Change the category\n7. Watch the log files and emails but no errors visible\n. I'm using OS X with Safari/Chrome/Firefox and I don't see any scrollbar, can you make a screenshot?\n. This issue is now fixed in the development version.\nThanks.\n. I understand nothing, what is the problem exactly?\nTo install a plugin your just have to uncompress the archive in the plugins folder, that's it.\n. It's fixed in master. Thanks.\n. Your user need to be administrator or project administrator.\n. - Kanboard will run database migrations automatically for you when you update from one version to another one.\n- Always do backup of your data folder and your database before.\n- Always read the ChangeLog file to check for breaking changes to may apply to you (https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/ChangeLog)\n. You can simply describe publicly what you would like to do here, especially if you are planning to contribute back to the project.\n. Sorry to answer so lately,\n- 1) 2) 6) and 9) are already available if I understand correctly\n- 7) In the next release a new role \"Project Viewer\" have been introduced to have read-only access to projects\n- 8) Can be added in master easily\n- The rest can probably be added with plugins\n. There are conflicts detected in your pull-request, you should update your local branch with master.\n. By the way, you should refactor the method sendOverdueTaskNotifications, there is too much code in it and you should not depend of Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Input\\InputInterface in a model.\nAnd it would be better to send a separate pull-request only for the new translation so I can merge that one quickly.\nThanks\n. If you would like to have your pull-request merged into master you have to fix the issues mentioned in previous comments.\n- Send a pull-request by feature/subject, smaller PR are easier to review, here you have 4 or 5 different subjects in a single PR\n- The unit tests are broken with your changes, all tests must pass\n- There are 24 commits here, try to have one single clean commit by PR\nThanks for your cooperation.\n. Unfortunately, the number of features is voluntary limited to keep the software simple and that doesn't seems to be used by a lot of people.. C'est maintenant corrig\u00e9 dans la branche master, l'export est de nouveau compatible avec PHP 5.3.\nMerci d'avoir rapport\u00e9 le probl\u00e8me.\n. Duplicate with #2241. Please provide more details...\n. Can you describe your environment to try to understand where the problem come from? (browser/os and server). Thanks\n. I have the same configuration on my laptop and I can reproduce the issue with Safari.\nThe problem come from Safari, I need to investigate to understand why the browser append \".html\" at the end.\n. I pushed a fix in master and now it's working with Safari.\nThanks to report this bug.\n. Yes, this bug have been fixed in the development branch. A new release will be published soon with bug fixes.\n. @Unictu Here an example:\nWith the API:\nphp\ndefine('MAIL_FROM', 'postmaster@mydomain.tld');\ndefine('MAIL_TRANSPORT', 'mailgun');\ndefine('MAILGUN_API_TOKEN', 'key-something');\ndefine('MAILGUN_DOMAIN', 'mydomain.tld');\nOr with SMTP:\nphp\ndefine('MAIL_TRANSPORT', 'smtp');\ndefine('MAIL_SMTP_HOSTNAME', 'smtp.mailgun.org');\ndefine('MAIL_SMTP_PORT', 465);\ndefine('MAIL_SMTP_USERNAME', 'postmaster@mydomain.tld');\ndefine('MAIL_SMTP_PASSWORD', 'top secret');\ndefine('MAIL_SMTP_ENCRYPTION', 'tls');\n. @heenameena Did you check if your volume is correctly mounted in your container?\n. Closing duplicate.\n. Duplicate of #2650. Can you describe your environment (server and browser) to try to understand why it's not working?\n. You should try again with the latest stable version, several changes have been made for LDAP auth. I tested myself with username with a dot \"firstname.lastname\" and it's working correctly.\n. All breaking changes are documented in the ChangeLog and the documentation is up to date.\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. I write a plugin that handle Gogs webhooks: http://kanboard.net/plugin/gogs-webhook\n. The documentation have been updated in the development branch. Thanks.\n. Already look at it in the past but their API doesn't make it easily to integrate KB.\n. You should try again with the latest version of Kanboard (1.0.38). I'm not really able to reproduce your issue. Open a new ticket if the problem still there. Thank you.. It's available in 1.0.26.\n. You should try again, it's working fine now.\n. Duplicate with #570 \n. Filesystems on Linux are case-sensitive, so yes the way you define your plugins is important. However, ucfirst('myPlugin'); will returns MyPlugin not Myplugin.. I'm closing this ticket. I let people from the community to contribute to project to implement such feature. That might be also possible to create a custom plugin.. I'm closing this ticket. I let people from the community to contribute to project to implement such feature. That might be also possible to create a custom plugin.. Link added to the FAQ.\n. You should test again with the latest stable version, a lot of changes have been made for LDAP authentication. I have tested with users located in different OU and configuring the Root DN in KB, it's working fine for me. My test Active Directory server is configured with the default settings. \n. That depends, for me it's better to see the action first because it's what I want to achieve at the end.\n. And technically, it's easier to fetch the compatible events for a given action than the opposite.\n. Check the error logs of your web server and the Kanboard's ChangeLog.\n. This piece of code have been removed from the current development branch. The next stable version will use only what you have specified.\n. Closing this ticket because it's not relevant anymore with the last stable version.\n. No it's not possible right now, the public board doesn't apply filters.\n. In the development branch, the 2FA configuration page have been improved, it's enabled only if the code has been verified correctly.\nThanks.\n. If you are using the master branch, you can update, a huge refactoring have been made...\n. I merged your pull-request.\nThanks for your contribution.\n. As described here http://kanboard.net/documentation/bruteforce-protection, after 6 failures the account is locked down for a period of 15 minutes, you just need to wait.\nAt the moment there is no user interface to reset the failed login counter but that can be done manually in the database.\n. Thanks.\n. Plugins are not yet updated.\n. Should work now with the master branch of plugins.\n. When you have upgraded, did you flush the sessions?\nI'm also using the dev version with 2FA and I didn't have this issue.\n. You can flush the sessions by asking people to logout from the application or by removing all php session files on the server. If you use the default file storage of PHP, the location of session files is visible in the parameter session.save_path from a phpinfo php -i. By example, on Ubuntu, the location is /var/lib/php5.\nWhen you said \"Access Forbidden\", who is sending this error, the web-server (Apache/nginx) or the application? \n. I don't really understand what is going on, I still not able to reproduce your issue.\nSo what happen with this scenario:\n- update Kanboard\n- open a new incognito window (to start without any existing cookies and with a clean session)\n1. try to login with a user without 2FA enabled\n2. try to login with a user with 2FA enabled\nWhich case is working and which one does't work?\n. I'm not able to reproduce your issue with MariaDB or Mysql. With the latest version the schema migrations have been improved to be more reliable. I hope that this fix this issue. Otherwise, if the schema still not up to date, unfortunately you will have to fix it manually.\n. Can you check the log files of your web servers to see the origin of the error?\n. This log file is not really helpful, you should check the error log. Which web server do you have, Apache?\n. Looks good to me, if you have time to fix the comments I will be ok to merge.\nThanks.\n. Thanks!\n. At the moment, I think people use their own DockerFile when they want to customize the config, for example: https://github.com/blufor/docker-kanboard\nBut, I can easily modify the code to load the config.php from /data if not present in the default location. In this way, you will be able to put everything in a single volume. Do you think that will improve your deployment process?\n. It's now available in master, the next stable version will probably be released in the next couple of days.\n. This issue is now fixed in master.\nThanks to report that.\n. What do you have in the plugins folder?\n. The plugin system of Kanboard try to load all subdirectories in the plugins folder.\nApparently, your Synology NAS is creating folders @eaDir, see http://nerdlogger.com/2012/03/08/synology-nas-and-those-pesky-eadir-folders/\nI think you just need to remove these folders manually and that will work.\n. Which version of Kanboard are you using ? and from which version did you upgrade ?\nThe filenames that appears on the stack trace you have copy/pasted doesn't exits anymore. Slack have been moved to an external plugin.\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I understand your point but I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited.\nThank you for your understanding. I cannot reproduce your issue on my local machine. Can you tell me if you can reproduce the issue on demo.kanboard.net ?\n. You can attach metadata to tasks, you have an example here: http://kanboard.net/documentation/plugin-metadata\nBut your plugin will have to expose these data to the user interface. This part can be done with template hooks: http://kanboard.net/documentation/plugin-hooks By example, you can add a new section in the sidebar that link to another form.\nAt the moment, there is no metadata for comments but it's something that can be improved easily.\nIf you really need to create new columns in sql tables or create a new tables, you can use the schema migrations: http://kanboard.net/documentation/plugin-schema-migrations\n. Tickets related to the calendar should be posted to the calendar plugin bug tracker: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-calendar/issues\nThank you. There is already a basic check: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/app/check_setup.php\n. For each request, I added recently the check for the gd extension.\n. I cannot really reproduce what you are saying.\n. Since Kanboard focus on simplicity, it will be better to have a plugin for that. It's also possible to develop themes with the plugin api.\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. It's now fixed in the development branch. If you need the fix right now, you can use the nightly build.\nThanks to report this issue.\n. I published a new version that includes the fix: http://kanboard.net/news/version-1.0.23\n. It's now fixed in the dev branch.\nThanks.\n. As described in the documentation Kanboard is tested only with Postgres >= 9.3\nYou should enable the debug mode and look for the SQL error in data/debug.log or just check Postgres sql logs. Having the error message from Postgres will be really useful.\n. Thanks.\n. Just update your plugins.\n. Duplicate with #850. Your Postgres server is too old, as described in the documentation only the version >= 9.3 are supported.\nhttp://kanboard.net/documentation/postgresql-configuration\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I understand your point but I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited.\nThank you for your understanding. Drag and drop for subtasks is now available in the development version.\n. Your issue is not related to HTTPS at all, the error message indicate \"SQL error\" so it's related to the database.\nYou should enable the debug mode, watch the log file, and when the error occurs, copy and paste the exact SQL error message here, that will be helpful to understand the problem.\n. I cannot really move the position of the scrollbars because it's handled by the browsers and not by the application.\nYou can also switch in \"compact\" mode that remove the need to scroll horizontally.\nI don't know what kind of device you are using, but many touchpad allow you to scroll horizontally without having to go to the bottom of the page, at least Apple's laptops supports that. \n. This issue is now fixed in the development branch. It was happening only to people using PHP < 5.5 (5.3 and 5.4).\nThanks to report this bug.\n. If you cannot wait the next release you can apply the fix manually: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/commit/8ff2032ea3fa49972fe076166c831719131e829d (change the line 48)\nIt's better to have the most recent version of PHP but it's not always possible. \n. Unfortunately, we are unable to reproduce the original issue after all this time. You should try with the latest version of Kanboard and reopen this ticket if necessary.\nThank you. Check the section \"From the archive (stable version)\" in the documentation: http://kanboard.net/documentation/update\nLet me know if the documentation is not clear enough.\n. Yes, this is the expected behaviour at the moment.\n. There is no Word exports in Kanboard. The exports use the CSV format which is compatible with any spreadsheet software.\n. It's fixed now in the master branch. Thanks!\n. I merged your pull-request so I close this ticket.\n. Unfortunately, to keep the software simple the number of features is voluntary limited. I suggest to pin tabs in your browser with the most used projects.. You are right, my bad, I forget to update that.\nThe SQL should like that:\nsql\nINSERT INTO users (username, password, role) VALUES ('admin', '$2y$10$EIYcgiDba33chGTqlP4cYeXSF7WC5RJPr8eMGsx.8gVT1Q4OUgkay', 'app-admin');\nIt's now fixed in the development branch.\nThanks to report that.\n. It's not mandatory but recommended especially if you plan to have several users. With slow disk access you may have locking issues when there is too much concurrency. \nWhen a process wants to write in the database, the entire database needs to be locked during the operation. Other processes have to wait... For example, do not use Sqlite on a shared NFS mount.\nIn summary:\n- Sqlite = single user or small team\n- Mysql/Postgres = multiple users with a lot of projects\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. The WIP limit is for all tasks of the column regardless of the assignee.\n. When you say \"it's already the same that is saved.\", what do you mean? what is the problem exactly?\n. I cannot see your screenshots in Github issue.\n. Closing duplicate\n. Just read the documentation: http://kanboard.net/documentation/installation\n. La documentation a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise \u00e0 jour, merci !\n. If you use the master branch, you can update.\n. This issue is now fixed in the master branch.\nUsing '7' as value doesn't seems to generate the expected length of the session id. PHP on FreeBSD seems to fallback to SHA-1 anyway. It's weird because the function hash_algos() return sha512 correctly under FreeBSD. It's maybe a bug of PHP itself. \nExample of session id:\nSHA-512: PP7XtYhQG-y-DI5YevOc5NZ22qUmG2y8WJOa7rJqQfEO38iLqWhKK9ny7%2CEbz8R71GNAi0WW9rTF6HqvFtKN82\nSHA-1: UUsgC8URKBC0fZTHsL5s-1HSCNa\nSo, to have a better compatibility between different platforms, the value is now '1' for Kanboard. \nhttp://php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php#ini.session.hash-function\nThanks to report the issue.\n. Just for information, even under Linux or Mac OS, the value '7' doesn't seems to generate a 'sha512' session id.\n. This automatic action is now available in the development branch.\n. Closing this ticket due to inactivity.. Can you provide an example of file you are trying to import?\n. In Kanboard, there are 2 kind of notifications \"Project Notifications\" and \"User Notifications\".\nIn the page \"Project settings > Notifications\" you will see only something if you install plugins like Slack/Hipchat...\nTo enable email notifications for someone, go to \"User Profile > Notifications\" then select \"Email\".\n. Notifications are working even if you are administrator. However, you must be member of the project.\n. Try to change the value of LDAP_BIND_TYPE to proxy instead of user.\n. Check if the extension pdo_mysql is correctly enabled.\n. Thanks.\n. I added the currency in the master branch.\n. I increased the column length in the master branch.\nThanks.\n. This improvement is now available in the development branch.\n. Merging with issue #2951. The documentation have been updated. Thanks.\n. The page header have modified in the development branch. Now there is a dropdown menu for the user and each different part of the header are using a different css class. So you can change the logo, the title and the rest more easily.\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. Do you have any php errors in the log files?\n. You can also enable the debug mode then duplicate the same projects and see if you have any error in the log files.\n. It doesn't happen anymore with the latest stable version of this morning. Thanks.\n. This feature has been added to the development branch. Thanks.\n. It's available now... The code has been updated, thanks!\n. Did you try without the .htaccess?\n. Try to proceed by elimination to find what is causing the problem in the .htaccess:\n```\n\n    Options -MultiViews\nSetEnv HTTP_MOD_REWRITE On\n\nRewriteEngine On\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\nRewriteRule ^ index.php [QSA,L]\n\n\n\n\n= 2.3>\n            Require all denied\n        \n\n            Order allow,deny\n            Deny from all\n        \n\n<IfModule !mod_version.c>\n    Order allow,deny\n    Deny from all\n</IfModule>\n\n\n```\nTry to remove to FilesMatch section, then test, etc... so you can isolate and report the problem.\n. Do you know which Apache version is it?\n. I'm not able to reproduce this issue, I tried with:\n- Ubuntu Precise (Apache 2.2)\n- Centos 6.7 (Apache 2.2)\n- Ubuntu Xenial (Apache 2.4)\n. Closing duplicate\n. If you need to alter the table schema, the best way is to contribute upstream. You could do that with a plugin but you are going to override a lot of stuff.. I just pushed a fix for this issue.\nThanks for the detailed bug report.\n@Bakkoda your issue is probably not related to this one.\n. - When the folder name is lowercase, the skin.css url is not valid anymore, this why the css is not loaded. See: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-example-css/blob/master/Plugin.php#L11\n- If you rename the folder to css-inactive, you get an error because PHP cannot load the plugin.php file since the namespace declared in the file don't match with the filesystem.\n. I do not plan to add such feature. If you really need that, the best way is to contribute.. The problem being that the automatic action TaskAssignColorColumn was triggering update events when changing the color, so the TaskAssignColorCategory was also triggered to change again the color.\nAs a fix, automatic actions that change the color don't trigger subsequent events anymore. So, you should have the expected if you use the last version of the repo.\n. It's now fixed in the development branch.\nThanks!\n. With the last development version of Kanboard you can attach files directly to the projects.\n. I merged a pull-request that place the notification at the bottom of page.\n. Your suggestion has been taken into consideration and it's now part of the development branch of Kanboard.\nThanks.\n. There is a polyfill for older PHP, don't forget to do a composer install if you are using directly the repo.\n. It's available now in the version 1.0.24\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. Which database type are you using: sqlite, postgres or mysql?\n. Which sqlite version do you have? and which OS?\n. This issue should be fixed with the latest version of KB. The sorting is now using the column name instead of the id.. Thanks\n. As first iteration of this feature, you receive only one notification when you are mentioned, you are not subscribed to the thread (this feature doesn't exists yet).\n. Thanks\n. Thanks!\n. Just for my information, what type of database do you use? mysql or postgres or sqlite?\n. This issue has been fixed in the development branch. Thanks!\n. Are you sure that everything is configured correctly according to https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/doc/email-configuration.markdown\n. @levlaz Before to add the support of MS SQL in Kanboard, the database library (PicoDB) have to be tested against the current version of MS SQL.\nI'm ok with a plugin, however the database provider class probably need to be modified. \n. People can always extract the plugin in the same time they install Kanboard. Installing plugins from the UI is not mandatory because this feature can disabled.\n. After all this time, I didn't plan to add MS SQL server support. If anyone if interested by this feature, pull-requests are welcome.. Did you try with the port 587 and TLS ?\nhttps://support.google.com/a/answer/176600?hl=en\n. You have to enable the openssl extensions: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2205694/unable-to-find-the-socket-transport-tls-did-you-forget-to-enable-it-when-you. It's not implemented, can you explain why you need that?\n. Ok, I see. If I understand correctly, this is the default LDAP schema with a standard OpenLDAP installation.\nI will see how hard is it to make it work.\n. I understand your point, but task IDs in Kanboard are the auto increment field value that come from the database.\nIf anyone have any suggestions to tackle this point, create issues to https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-gitlab-webhooks.. Everything that contains an existing task id prefixed by the symbol #.\n. The first line of the debug file says \"User not found in LDAP server\", are you sure that everything is configured correctly, especially the user base DN?\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. I reverted back the last changes until I found the issue.\n. Try the last kanboard.\n. The screenshot feature doesn't require anything on the server, everything is done in the browser with Javascript.\n. I would be cool to publish the code of your plugin somewhere. By example, you can create a repository on Github. So, people can download and contribute/improve easily to your plugin.\n. I changed that in master.\n. fred@kanboard.net\n. This is now supported by the plugin (only in the dev branch): https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-google-auth#automatic-account-creation\n. Can you describe with an example what you suggest here https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-google-auth/issues\nThe approach implemented at the moment is a whitelist based on the email domain name.\nThanks\n. As described in the documentation, the schema migrations are executed automatically for you. Don't forget to backup your database.\nhttp://kanboard.net/documentation/update\n. Duplicate with #2090. Don't forget to update the vendor directory with composer.\n. I don't know which version of Kanboard you have installed (stable or dev). But if you use directly the repository, you need to run composer to update the vendor directory.\n. It's working for me, which browser do you have?\n. Not planned for me, you can write a plugin I guess.\n. This settings is saved in the local storage of your browser, so it's not persistent forever.\n. This feature have been removed in dev. The height is now the one necessary to display tasks.\n. You can define the kanboard url in \"Settings > application url\" to avoid the underscore.\nWhich web server are you using for Kanboard? do you use docker or anything special?\n. At the moment, this feature is not implemented yet for Gitlab/Github/Google auth. Someone have to develop the \"registration/sign up\" part. So there is only the minimum right now.\n. Closing this duplicate.\n. This feature is clearly missing from the user interface.\nAt the origin, it was developed to synchronize ticket automatically with some external systems and nobody express the need to update this field from the ui until now.\n. The reference field is now exposed to the user interface (only in the current development branch).\n. Your fork is probably too old or something else is wrong, the file app/Model/ProjectAnalytic.php have been removed recently.\n. This issue should be fixed with the latest version, do you still having the issue?\n. I can upload/download documents with filename in Chinese without any problem.\nThe issue may come from your os/browser. Did you see the correct filename in Kanboard? What browser/os do you use?\n. Seems to be a permission issue, double check the permission/owner of the directory data and the db.\n. Closing this thread to avoid cluttering the bug tracker. There is now a forum for open disussions: https://forum.kanboard.net/topic/2\nThanks. If you are talking about the text field inside the top right dropdown, it's appearing only if you have at least 10 items in the dropdown.\n. I just changed the behaviour in the dev branch, now the search box is always appearing in the project selector.\nIt's more convenient to use especially if you use the keyboard shortcuts, by pressing the key \"b\" then start to type the first letter of your project and then press enter. So you can switch quickly between projects.\nAnd, yes it was > 10 items to see the text field. On the board view, the project where you are currently is not part of the dropdown, so in your case you were seeing 9 items... Anyway, now the search box is always there.\n. Not yet, for now the focus is simplicity.\n. You have to modify the code.\n. This issue is not related to Kanboard but to your Mysql server configuration.\n. What type of database are you using? How are defined the foreign keys of the table subtask_time_tracking?\nThe table task_has_subtasks doesn't exists since a while. Maybe a migration didn't work as expected.\n. Closing this issue. The schema migration process need to be improved.\n. This problem have already been reported. It's now fixed in the development version and that will be part of the next stable version.\n. Fix available in 1.0.24\n. It was a bug, it's now fixed in the development branch. Thanks.\n. Duplicate with #919. This api call is used to move a task within the same board, not across projects.\nI added 2 new api calls for that:\n- moveTaskToProject\n- duplicateTaskToProject\n. Can you make a screenshot please?\n. The ldap filter doesn't support multiple placeholders, only one %s is supported.\n. That can be improved very easily in the code, instead of using sprintf() I can use str_replace() to replace all occurrences.\n. This feature is now supported in the development branch.\n. Adding the missing form element on the edit page is not enough. It's not available yet on the form because the task positions needs to be updated in the column source and destination.\nAnother approach might be to add a new page just to move a task by choosing the column/swimlane...\n. This feature is not yet implemented.\n. This feature is available with the last development version.\n. Closing this duplicate.\n. Which version of kanboard are you using and where did you see this error?\n. I added that in the documentation, thanks.\n. There is something wrong in your PR, it's not possible to do any merge. As you can see on Github, there are 1,485 files changed.\nThanks\n. I merged your pull-request. Thanks.\n. It's available in master, use the method \"getMemberGroups\".\n. Thanks!\n. fyi I started to simplify the page loading via ajax to avoid to pass a redirect variable everywhere. The dropdown menu will be there but I'm doing that step by step.\n. I think we have the dropdown almost everywhere now.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks it's merged!\n. Duplicate with #1019. Thanks!\n. You have to modify this file: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/app/Template/dashboard/projects.php or override the CSS.. Just pass the class name to the argument $class: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/app/Helper/Url.php#L45\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Nice!\n. PR merged. Thanks everybody!\n. Thanks!\n. Kanboard doesn't have such feature, you have do it manually at your own risk.\n. It would be better to make a plugin for that.\n. Closing this PR. Should be implemented as plugin. However, missing plugin API can be added to implement this plugin correctly.\n. These hooks have been merged now.\n. I'm not expert enough in Active Directory. You will have to dig into this problem by yourself to find a solution (and perhaps contribute!).. The software doesn't synchronize LDAP passwords in the local database. If you would like to go this way, it's probably better to have only local users.\nWhich problem do you try to solve?\n. Why? the purpose of LDAP authentication is to avoid to duplicate user credentials everywhere.\n. What do you suggest about that?\nKanboard focus on simplicity, the role and permissions system is voluntary simple.\n. There are custom roles now.. Closing this issue, discussion moved to the mailgun plugin bug tracker.\n@jtourt I added the subject cleanup part in the master branch of the plugin.\n. I don't believe that this feature exists yet.. It's now fixed in the development version.\nThanks.\n. Similar to #1998 . Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. http://kanboard.net/documentation/project-permissions\n. This is the expected behaviour, Kanboard do not synchronize all users at once, only when the user sign in. Otherwise it will take too much time for organization with a large number of users.\n. @elacour I merged your patch in master. This issue is now fixed.\nThanks\n. In the meantime, if everybody are using the same language, you can define the language at the application level in the application settings.\n. It's planned when avatar images will be implemented correctly.\n. it's now available in 1.0.26.\n. Github/Google/Gitlab have been pulled outside of the core few days ago and it's working only with the current master branch of Kanboard and the coming version 1.0.25.\nIt's not expected to work with 1.0.24.\n. Because this feature is already part of 1.0.24, you don't need a plugin. But with the next 1.0.25, this feature has been moved to a plugin.\n. you can now use KB 1.0.25 with auth plugins.\n. Sorry, I prefer to keep Kanboard simple so this feature won't be developed.\n. I squashed your pull-request because there are too many commits, anyway it's merged now. Thanks.\n. I haven't seen any webhook system on their documentation, only a rest api that require 2 http requests to send a message (1 for authentication and another one to send the message).\n. @rodrigok I will try with docker on my own machine. Thanks.\n. @rodrigok @ciroiriarte I write a new plugin for RocketChat: http://kanboard.net/plugin/rocketchat\nMostly a copy and paste of the Slack plugin.\n. what do you mean by smtp authorization?\n. Can you give me an example of implementation because I don't get it.\n. You can already do that: http://kanboard.net/documentation/email-configuration\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I understand your point but I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited.\nThank you for your understanding. With the last development version, only open tasks appear in the ical feed now.\nThanks.\n. The Docker image is using Nginx and php-fpm now.\nMaybe you should try it again.\n. This issue should be fixed in v1.0.39. . It's fixed in master. Thanks.\n. Adding tasks via the list view is now available in the development branch.\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. Just click on the column title.\n. Without context, it's hard to help, provide an example of code, please.\n. That won't works from a template. If you do $this->something->method() that will load a helper class (Kanboard\\Helper). I need to improve this part to be able to load custom helpers.\nHowever, you should be able to generate a link in the sidebar template: 'Hello:analytic/sidebar'. Then this link can point to a controller in your plugin, from there you can use your model and render another template that generate the right part of the page.\nHave a look to the plugin Budget, it's mostly the same approach.\n. Yes it works too but this part need to be improved.\n. This feature is available in recent version of KB.. You won't receive any notification for stuff done by yourself.\n. Closing, related to #1652\n. The routes was missing, just upgrade Kanboard.\n. unix timestamp\n. I fixed the issue in the plugin. There was a typo in the url (extra useless slash): https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-gitlab-webhook/commit/fd174c46ea744151e0fc74fa76cd1c9fd76b5e90\nThanks.\n. If you use the last version of KB, there is a loading icon for tasks.\n. ah ok, it's when you are creating a new task, yes there is nothing for that at the moment.\nThere is a loading icon when you move a task on the board...\nIt's added on my todo list.\n. Leave it open because it's synced to my own Kanboard instance :)\n. It's now available in the development branch for submit buttons.\n. Now, you can drag and drop subtasks, when you hover the \"move\" icon, the row is highlighted.\n. Issues related to Gitlab should be posted here: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-gitlab-webhook/issues. Duplicate with https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-gitlab-webhook/issues/5. Duplicate with https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-gitlab-webhook/issues/5. The best way to have RTL support is to contribute directly to the project.. This issue is now fixed in the development version.\nThanks.\n. Should be fixed in master. Thanks.\n. Just check if everything is installed correctly, should works. Otherwise post a bug report with all the information to reproduce the issue.\n. Do you still having the issue with the latest version?\n. It's very nice! I may steal some ideas :)\nHowever, we need to have some room for the project title that can be longer and the board switcher on the right.\nThe top header and the project page header are not the same templates, that will require more complex changes.\nBut I like the search box with the dropdowns, this one can be implemented easily for the next version.\n. For your information the search box with filters have been implemented in the development version.\n. v1.0.27 has a better user interface. Most of your comments have been taken into consideration.\n. @nttict-nick-b There is already the possibility to drag and drop files for tasks and projects. That use the HTML5 File API (See FileUpload.js). To upload a file a task ID is necessary. So the UI or the flow to create a task probably need to be modified.\n. In master, the project title and task title are now always displayed in task views.\n. Closing duplicate.\n. Thanks!\n. Duplicate of #2093 and #1976\n. Those keyboard shortcuts are now available on the task view page (master branch).\n. The size is not limited by Kanboard but by your web server/php configuration.\n. You could edit the template (app/Template/dashboard) in your installation or write a plugin.. You can already sort comments by date (the link is next to the \"Comments\" title).\n. It should be fixed in master now.\n. Can you make a screenshot?\n. I merged the PR of @nttict-nick-b in master.\nThanks everybody.\n. Closing duplicate.\n. You can use the command line utility of Kanboard: http://kanboard.net/documentation/cli\nExport tasks in CSV, pipe the output to the mail command and run that in a cronjob.\n. PR merged. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Not yet, this feature is missing.\n. This is now available in version 1.0.33\n. This issue is now fixed in the development version.\nThanks.\n. Duplicate with #1800 \n. Sorry, I prefer to keep Kanboard simple so this feature won't be developed. There is no date defined for subtasks btw.\n. If you are loading the fonts from an external web server, you are probably blocked by Content Security Policy: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/doc/plugin-overrides.markdown#override-http-content-security-policy\nYou probably need to add font-src.\n. Thanks, it's merged!\n. I just merged the exact same pull-request #1830.\nThanks\n. Thanks, it's merged!\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. Can you show an example of request or code you are using?\n. - The data sent to the API must be a valid JSON payload. From your screenshot of Postman, you seems to send data with \"form-data\" which is not correct.\n- The response sent by your web server seems to be a 302 redirect to /task/SiteLogin.aspx?..., this part is not related to Kanboard but to way your have configured IIS (maybe an authentication is required?).\n. You can disable syslog in Kanboard, the procedure is described here: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/doc/config.markdown#logging\n. Duplicate with #928. With the last development version, you can add local links that starts with file://. However, your browser won't allows you to click on the link, you will have to copy the URL manually.\n. This is the case on latest version of KB.. Yes, this bug have been already reported.\n. Fixed in 1.0.26\n. Should be fixed now if you update master.\nThanks.\n. The procedure getAllProjects is not allowed by the user API, you have to use the method getMyProjects.\n. Fixed in 1.0.26\n. You can also use the template hook template:layout:head to inject any html tag in the head section.\n. You can use this plugin to import Github Issues into Kanboard: https://kanboard.net/plugin/github-frontend. The ISO8601 format should always work...\nIt's working for me, which version of Kanboard are you using?\nDon't forget that the field \"start date\" must contains the time (2016-02-23 20:59) and the \"due date\" contains only the date (2016-02-23)\n. The demo doesn't exists anymore.\n. Dans la traduction \"pt_PT\", c'est traduit comme cela: \"Algoritmo de password para uso \u00fanico baseado em tempo\"\n- https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/app/Locale/pt_PT/translations.php#L1016\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm\nMerci !\n. This is a duplicate/similar to #2072. >/dev/null 2>&1 redirect stdout and stderr to /dev/null, that it's.\n. Drag and drop is available in the development version.\n. Which hosting provider do you use?\n. @connorbode Thanks :)\n. The time is not rounded anymore in version 1.0.33.\n@hivemind yes, that need to be changed\n. There is already plenty of documentation to install Kanboard in different environments. For a shared hosting provider, you just need to copy the files and configure the database.\n. Thanks for your suggestions.. Thanks!\n. The concept of default swimlane has been removed in Kanboard 1.0.40. Now you can change the order of the first swimlane created.. it is now.. From which version of Kanboard are you upgrading?\n. From which version did you try to upgrade?\n. You don't really the choice to fix the schema manually by looking at each migrations.\n. Sorry for closing the issue but I thought that the problem was solved since the time. Due to the amount of tickets, sometimes it can very difficult to help people individually, especially when you have few details about the problem/the configuration used or when I'm not able to reproduce the problem.\nYour data is not lost, however you have to manipulate the schema of your database manually to make it work again.\n- The error message said that migration 47 doesn't work because it's was already executed. (see https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/app/Schema/Mysql.php#L748)\n- You have to check to version number in the table \"schema_version\".\n- Maybe your are stuck at version 46 whatever reason, change manually to the value to 47 and refresh the page that should execute the rest of the migrations.\n. Yes, it's a duplicate of #1810 \n. You should upgrade your Kanboard version. This issue have been already fixed in the past.\n. I cannot really reproduce this issue at least with the last Docker image.\nCan you describe how you are running the Docker image and how you access it?\n. Did you configure the date format in application settings?\n. This issue have been fixed in Kanboard 1.0.29. Reopen this ticket if necessary.\n. Thanks\n. Can you try again with the version 1.0.26? this issue should be fixed.\n. The answer is there: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/issues/1532\n. I'm not able to reproduce this issue, I tried with:\n- Ubuntu Precise (Apache 2.2)\n- Centos 6.7 (Apache 2.2)\n- Ubuntu Xenial (Apache 2.4)\n. Provide your Apache configuration because I'm not able to reproduce the issue with the default configuration of Centos 6.7, Ubuntu...\n. Should be fixed in master even if I'm not able to reproduce the issue, probably because you have a very old version of Sqlite on Centos 5.10.\nCan you tell me which version of Sqlite you have?\n. It's not a bug and it was the expected behaviour.\nHowever, I changed that in the development branch. Now, for the category and users filters only the selected occurence will be visible in the search field. It doesn't append the value anymore.\nIf appending the value is necessary, the custom filters can be used instead.\n. Modify manually the template?\n. @jaiume Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. \n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. Ok, I reproduced the same issue on my machine but I don't understand why it was working on Docker Hub since it's an automated build.\n. The state parameter in now handled (in master branch).\n. In the development branch the filters have been improved. Query like status:open created:>=\"11 days ago\" are now supported.\n. Thanks!\n. You are using your curl request to do that? if yes that won't works, the crsf token won't be valid.\n. There is already a redirection to the original page. Need to validate if that works correctly with Google Auth.\n. From the actions menu, you can disable the \"max height\" to avoid blank space. \n. In the development version, individual column scrolling have been removed and the swimlane height is now the height necessary to display tasks.\n. This issue is now fixed in the branch master.\nThanks a lot for reporting that!\n. In version 1.0.48, you can create bulk subtasks.. I merged manually your PR and changed a little bit the code.\nThanks.\n. your config.php starts with the <?php tag?\n. Seems to be very similar to the reverse proxy authentication of Kanboard or to this plugin: http://kanboard.net/plugin/reverse-proxy-ldap\n. I don't really support migrations from sqlite to another db because it's a endless source of problems.\n. 3000 subtasks for one task or 3000 in total?\n. I'm not sure how you can manage 3000 subtasks with the user interface...\n. You can send your PR :)\n. I merged your PR, thanks.\n. In Kanboard 1.0.39, there is now a message to inform the user.. @EpocDotFr I created a new entry in the FAQ: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/doc/faq.markdown#authentication-failure-with-the-api-and-apache--php-fpm Thanks!\n. 1) Feature not available\n2) Only one assignee per task is possible\n3) Enable the notifications\n. Thanks\n. It's now fixed in master, thanks!\n. Thanks\n. The view switcher is now unified between pages, there is no \"back to board\" anymore.\n. PR merged thanks everybody!\n. It's now available in the current master.\n. Thanks for the fix\n. Looks great but I'm not really fan of having a regex inside the button link helper. There is probably a better way of doing that. Maybe adding $icon as first parameter is more appropriate.\nNot sure if we need to convert all header links to this design. What about starting only with view switcher and the filter dropdown?\n. Thanks for updating your pull-request.\nI was about to merge your branch even if there are some conflicts and I see that the buttons of dialog boxes are very small now. Is there a way to restore the original size?\nThanks\n. I merged some of your changes.\nThanks.\n. This template hook doesn't exists anymore but the issue was probably because $task was not passed in the original hook.\n. Thanks Dj\n. Writing a plugin to create a new theme is not very hard: \n- https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-example-theme\n- https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-example-css\n. You should probably use this helper: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/app/Helper/AppHelper.php#L23\n<?= $this->app->config('foobar') ?>\n. This feature is now available in the development branch: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/doc/api-external-task-link-procedures.markdown\n. It's now available in master.\n. You should check the log of your operating system (syslog or cron logs).\n. Duplicate with #2972. This hook is now available.\n. Do you still having the issue with the last master?\n. How did you install PHP 5.4 on a Centos 5.1? Did you use alternative RPM packages instead of the official ones? This operating system is so old that I can't even reproduce the problem.\n. At the moment, there is nothing to add a new command line command from plugins.\n. There is an example here to add new commands: https://kanboard.net/documentation/plugin-registration\n. \nIn the user section input field, if you type the first letter of the username, you should see an autocomplete box, is it the case?\n. Do you guys still having the issue with a more recent version of Kanboard?\n. Ok, so I close this issue. If you have a problem open a new ticket.\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. It's should be fixed in 1.0.27\n. The form is now improved in 1.0.27, there is no \"Enable notifications\" checkbox anymore. Notifications will be enabled when at least one method is selected.\n. Closing this ticket due to inactivity and lack of interest by the community.. It's now fixed in the development branch. Thanks.\n. These hooks are now available.\n. Did report the issue on the Yunohost bug tracker? it's probably related to the way they are provisioning the application.\n. - The CI build doesn't pass, there is a typo in your unit test.\n- Why do you need to have application metadata, is that not the same thing as the settings table?\n- What do you think about extending the abstract class Model\\Metadata to avoid code duplication?\nThanks for submitting a pull-request.\n. Unfortunately, we are unable to reproduce the original issue after all this time. You should try with the latest version of Kanboard and reopen this ticket if necessary.\nThank you. There are more logs from Kanboard if you use enable the debug mode. Maybe that will help you to find the problem.\n. This issue is fixed in more recent version of KB.. It's now available in the current master.\n. If you still need this feature, the best way is to contribute to the project or to develop a plugin.. Why is it wrong? the duration is shown in days?\n. Thanks for packaging Kanboard in Cloudron.\nI have no problem to have Cloudron in the doc (section installation), you can send a PR if you would like.\n. When you duplicate a project, you always duplicate the columns.\n. With v1.0.27, the comment form always appears at the bottom. You can also use the keyboard shortcut \"c\" or the menu on the left.\n. Kanboard doesn't supports sub-projects. To discuss about milestones, refer to the mentioned ticket above.\n. You can use http://domain.tld/t/123 to access to the task id #123\n. This issue have been fixed in the plugin itself. You can download the version 1.0.1.\nThanks.\n. Do you still having the issue with 1.0.27?\n. If you still have the issue, try with Kanboard 1.0.38. I was never able to reproduce the problem with the information provided. If the problem still there, reopen this ticket with absolutely all the relevant information to reproduce the problem.\nThank you. It's now fixed in the master branch. The SQL constraint was not correct.\nThanks!\n. Closing, see comments in PR\n. @mcorteel Thanks for submitting a pull-request and sorry about the delay of my answer.\nAs you can see, I also updated the activity stream to display the default avatar. Actually, that looks like that in master:\n\nSince everybody have different personal taste about the design, I prefer to keep it simple as it right now. \nBut, if you prefer your own design, you still have the possibility to make a \"theme plugin\". I will be happy to publish it on the website.\nThanks.\n. Agreed, what about using a css class for each font-size?\n. In dev, the number of font-size values have been reduced to 6 and that can be changed easily since I converted all vanilla CSS to SASS.\n. Thanks, it's now fixed in master.\n. If you really need this feature, the best is to contribute to the project by sending a pull-request.. Thanks guys. The avatar is now on the top right corner.\n. You sent the minified version of the CSS?\n. If anyone need this feature and would like to develop a plugin, do not hesitate to contribute. There are already too many feature requests and I prefer to keep the software simple.. Do you still have the issue because I'm not able to reproduce with the same browser version?\nDo you have Javascript errors in the console or anything else? Did you flush the browser cache, just in case?\n. @Kolesar Thanks for submitting a pull-request. I'm ok to merge your PR but some improvements have to be made:\n- Reduce the code duplication, especially in the class ActivityFilter\n- Add at least some unit tests for the new filters\nThanks!\n. Thanks for updating your pull-request.\nI was talking about the methods getContent() and decode(), it would be nice if you can avoid to duplicate that.\nThanks.\n. Yes I will check.\n. As you can see in the branch master, I have done a lot of code refactoring to make the filters more flexible.\nIf you want to add more filters, you just need to follow the current mechanism.\nThanks.\n. Unfortunately, the number of features is voluntary limited to keep the software simple. There are already categories and tags for tasks and that cover most needs.. 1) the task status is easy to fix\n2) no event is fired at the moment, that need to be implemented\n3) not sure about the notifications\n. Yes, I know. It's due to the new Markdown editor, the autocomplete have to be rewritten.\n. Probably next time, I need to find a better way to display the autocomplete with the new Markdown editor.\nThe user mention still there, only the autocomplete is missing.\n. Yes, I'm working on it, there still some development todo to make it compatible with Internet Explorer.. This is now available in v1.0.35, open a new ticket if you see any issue.\nThank you. Closing duplicate.. Can you rename the hook to template:board:task:icons instead of footer_icon? thanks\n. Closing due to inactivity or lack of interest of the community.. Need to be rebased.\n. Should be fixed in master.\nDuplicate of #1824 \n. Thanks!\n. It was mistake in the placeholders of the translation.\n. Thanks to report this issue. It's now fixed in master.\n. Probably a duplicate with #6.\n. Do you still having the issue because it's working for me?\n. This is coming from the library https://github.com/paragonie/random_compat, do you have at least openssl or mcrypt and /dev/urandom? \n. I updated the FAQ.\n. In the meantime, you can always upload a different image.\n. Unfortunately, I don't want to add one billion of configuration options and I will never be able to satisfy everyone.\nYou still have the name of the person next to the avatar and the possibility to use custom images. If you don't agree with this behavior, you still have the possibility to create a plugin and do your own stuff.. The web.config have been updated in the development branch, I just tested with IIS 8.5. Do not forget to install the rewrite module http://www.iis.net/learn/extensions/url-rewrite-module/using-the-url-rewrite-module otherwise IIS will return an error.\nThe web.config file is necessary only for URL rewriting, you can remove it if you don't need/want this feature.\n. You can now use the method searchTasks($project_id, $query) in master.\n. Don't forget to check the unit tests. The build was broken.\n. It was already reported and fixed, you should update your Kanboard instance.\n. Duplicate of #1885. It's fixed in master, Thanks.\n. No, removed and renamed files will stay there. You are better to clone the repo, then copy your data folder inside (see install/update doc).\n. I added your project to the list of related projects: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/doc/faq.markdown#where-can-i-find-a-list-of-related-projects\nThanks!\n. What is the screen resolution you are using?\n. I currently working on making Kanboard more responsive. It's in progress..\n. It was already asked in #896\n. Sorry it was #894\n. Where are the unit tests?\n. You added a new method but no test for this method. Anyway, it's merged now.\n. With the current development version, the syntax status:open created:<\"-100 days\" is now supported. The double quotes are required.\n. Probably because I prefer async communications.\nJust to try, I created a room on Gitter a couple of weeks ago. Maybe I should create a channel on Freenode.\n. I created a new IRC channel on Freenode #kanboard or  ircs://chat.freenode.net:6697/#kanboard\nI don't necessary answer right way even if my user is connected all the time.\n. Your config example has been added to the documentation. That might help other people. Thanks.. At the moment, this feature doesn't exists.\n. You could perform a search from the dashboard and then sort the tasks by priority.. At the moment, the date picker will always show the date in iso8601 format. However, when the date is displayed somewhere, you local format should be used.\n. You can already remove a project (project settings > remove) ?\n. In Kanboard 1.0.39, the status has been changed to \"closed\" instead of \"inactive\".. You should upgrade to 1.0.27, there are 3 ways now to create comments on the task summary page:\n- Use the link on the left sidebar\n- Use the keyboard shortcut \"c\"\n- Expand the comments section and write your comment\n. Your changes should be rebased with master.\n. I tested your PR, but tasks with no category don't appears on the chart. It would be nice if you could add some unit tests for the new methods.\n. Closing this PR until the comments are addressed.\n. Automatic actions doesn't do any form of validation but a new automatic action may assign a default category.\n. Did you solve your issue after all this time?. In Kanboard 1.0.39, the default assignee is now \"unassigned\" for team projects.. Duplicate of #1976.\nWhich version of Centos do you have? 5.1?\n. At the moment, groups sync is only supported with the overlay \"memberOf\" or the default settings of ActiveDirectory.\nI plan to improve this feature to support more LDAP configurations.\nCan you provide an example of how your users and groups are configured in your LDAP directory? (LDIF entries with groupOfNames)\n. - The sender name is the name of the person that does the action (the logged user, example: \"John Doe via Kanboard\")\n- The sender email address is the one configured in the config file, defined by the parameter MAIL_FROM.\nThis is not the email of a user because that offer the possibility to implement new features in the future, for example: \"reply to the notification and create a comment in Kanboard automatically\".\n. Kanboard 1.0.40 supports the Reply-To header that allows people to reply to the person that does the action.. This is the expected behaviour. All files are stored in the data folder even if you use Postgres.\n. Well, if you still need template hooks, the best way is to send a pull-request.. @levlaz The most simple way is probably to display an alert message that says \"There is no tasks yet..\".\n. This now fixed fixed in dev. Now that display an empty board instead.\n. You need to be authenticated to use the software. If you want to avoid another credentials, there are some plugins to use other authentication backends like Google or whatever, that require some configuration but you don't need to have a in-house developer.\n. If you want to migrate from Sqlite to Mysql or Postgres there are probably some command line tools, but the reliability of this operation is not guaranteed to work correctly. (search in the closed issues, some people already tried that).\n. @thob Yes, you can use mysqldump for example\n. The current translation system is so basic that it doesn't take into consideration the gender or the plurals. For me, changing the localization system it's not a priority right now. I don't know if gettext is able to that...\nIf you change the text to have \"Administrateur-trice\" everywhere, that will also increase the string length, French sentences are already too long IMHO.\n. I don't know anything about cPanel but maybe this link will help you: https://documentation.cpanel.net/display/ALD/Cron+Jobs\nJust put this command in the text field: http://kanboard.net/documentation/cronjob\n. Actually, I merged and modified your helper from your PR, UrlHelper::button() is available: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/app/Helper/UrlHelper.php#L43\nHowever, only few links use this helper at the moment.\n. Now, with the latest version of KB clicking on the background doesn't close the modal dialog.. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. This now implemented in the development branch. Thanks.\n. It's fixed in master. Thanks.\n. - Did you create a new project with the same name as the old one?\n- Since which version of Kanboard your database is created?\nIn the past, a unique constraint was defined on the project name. Sqlite doesn't fully support alter table. Maybe you have a old database.\nTry to enable the debug mode and do the same operation, you will see the exact error message from the database.\n. See #2045 \n. I made a couple of improvements after merging your pull-request.\nI also updated the installation instructions for people who needs a similar setup: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/doc/installation.markdown#installation-outside-of-the-document-root\nThanks\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. It would be better to include the Nitrous docs in the documentation folder instead of the main readme (like other providers).\n. This is not implemented at the moment. The main reason is comments are multiline text using the Markdown syntax and that doesn't fit very well with CSV.\nIf anyone need this feature, it could be implemented as a plugin.. Closing this PR because it's not mergeable anymore. You should put the logic that groups tasks in a specific method instead of changing the existing method. Try to send only files necessary to the PR, it's easier to review.\nThanks\n. Duplicate with #1575. You could send a pull-request or write a plugin if you need this feature.. https://kanboard.net/documentation/plugins\n. This is fixed if you download the latest version of Kanboard.. If you use SMTP, maybe you should set the transport to \"smtp\" (first config parameter).\n\nDatabase type and version: MongoDB Latest\n\nKanboard doesn't use MongoDB by the way.\n. Thanks, it's now fixed in master.\n. Thanks, the file have been renamed.\n. There are no rounding anymore.. In master, the color is now based on the full name now (PR #2066). But, I will test on windows...\n. This issue is now fixed (development and beta branch).\n. Feeds are now valid (dev branch).\n. The latest version of Kanboard add the support of background workers to delegate slower operations to another process. This feature still experimental but greatly improve the performances.\nHave a look to this page: https://kanboard.net/documentation/performances\n. Do not forget to update the unit tests. The build is broken due to your changes.\n. I don't get why that simplify theme creation?\n. All right. I close this PR because I cannot merge it anymore (sorry to review so lately).\n. No, it's not possible. This feature have been already asked in the past. But to keep the software simple, the number of features are voluntary limited. I'm sorry but at the moment there is no plan to add comments/description/files to subtasks.\n. Thanks to report this issue. It's now fixed in master.\n. This is now available in the development version.\n. Everything is possible, it's just question of time and priority.\n. In the version 1.0.34, clicking on the background do not close anymore the form so it avoid to lost accidentally entered information.\n. Yes it doesn't duplicate links at the moment.\n. FR for tags is #262 \n. Yes it was removed to simplify the ui but you can still add subtasks quickly by using the keyboard shortcut \"s\" or by clicking on the link on the left.\n. This is done in this PR https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-gantt/pull/7. You should try again with the latest version of Kanboard.. The last column is \"Closed\", put 1 or t or y.. What smartphone are you using?\n. That should be fixed in the development branch. Thanks.\n. Are you using LDAP group sync or not? only the basic LDAP authentication?\n. This issue is now fixed in the development branch. Thanks.\n. @fbartels Open a new issue with absolutely all information needed to reproduce the problem (config, environment etc...) Thanks.\n. All plugins must be updated.\n. The string between quote have to be the exactly the same as the link label (lower or uppercase doesn't matter), for example this query should work: status:open link:\"is a child of\" or status:open link:\"is a parent of\"?\n. This issue is now fixed in the development branch. Thanks.\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. You can see the column on the dashboard now.. This version of Kanboard is very old. You should upgrade.\n. I suggest that you update to a more recent version of Kanboard or read https://kanboard.net/documentation/performances\nIf you find a bug, don't hesitate to open a new issue. Thank you.\n. You can change the date format in the application settings.\n. 1. Yes, by using the filter in the search box, for example assignee:me\n2. No, all project members can move tasks on the board\n. @erpnedir this feature doesn't exists at the moment.. The toolbar is everywhere now in v1.0.35. Tickets related to the calendar should be posted to the calendar plugin bug tracker: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-calendar/issues\nThank you. Duplicate with #304\n. The Javascript code have to be modified to make it work.\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. This feature is not yet available.\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. I don't plan to add such feature. If you really need that, the best way is to contribute.. Subtasks are pretty much the same as checklists.. This now possible in Kanboard 1.0.39. From the board, you could click on the comment icon and then you could answer directly to another comment.. Having a user interface that works on mobile devices is mandatory nowadays. However, I'm not sure yet if making the application responsive is the best way. A native mobile application is faster and have a better integration with the OS. Short answer, yes it's planned, just need time to do it.\n. For you information, the current development version is more responsive than before. At least, this is usable on a smartphone.\nAll vanilla CSS have been converted SASS and the responsive stuff is handled by using SASS mixins.\n. @hubutz use a separate installation to test the nightly build because the schema of the database can change.\n. The version 1.0.33 is now considered responsive so I close this ticket. There still a lot of improvements that can be done (dropdown menus for example) but at least this is possible to navigate in the application with a smartphone.\n. Actually, the dashboard is already splited by projects in the latest versions of KB.. This issue is now fixed in the development branch.\nThanks!\n. Why? there are so many people who asked to have avatars... Making everything configurable increase the complexity of the software.\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I understand your point but I cannot make everything configurable.\nThank you for your understanding. At the moment, there is nothing that enforce people to activate 2FA.\nIt's not very hard to develop especially with the new Middleware system in master. The check can be made at login time. If the user do not have 2FA, redirect the user to the 2FA config page.\n. Can you get the exact error message from your Apache logs? Thanks\n. Bulk subtask creation is now available in the development branch.. The Markdown syntax impose to have one blank line between line, otherwise it will be the same paragraph. The Markdown rendering in the textarea is just a simple preview, it's apply only some styles.\nThe description field is rendered by the Javascript library SimpleMDE and the rendering in the task view is made by the PHP library Parsedown.\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. See https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-gitlab-webhook/issues/5\n. Sorry my bad, I read Gitlab instead of Github. This is the same scenario, the Github API have to be implemented in the plugin.\n. Please, move your ticket to the Github plugin bug tracker: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-github-webhook/issues\n\nThis will facilitate the work of the maintainers (bug triage)\nMake sure your ticket still relevant with the latest version of the software\nIf you are asking another feature request, do not hesitate to contribute, Kanboard is an open source project. Remember the famous quote from Linus Torvalds: \u201cTalk is cheap. Show me the code.\u201d\n\nThank you for your understanding. You have to put the absolute URL to your Kanboard folder: https://kb.mydomain.com/kanboard/ or if you  don't have a sub-folder put: https://kb.mydomain.com/\n. Are you using IIS on Windows?\n. I was not able to reproduce your issue, so try again with the latest version of Kanboard (1.0.38). If the issue still there, reopen this ticket with all the relevant information to be able to found the problem. \nThank you.. - You have to use the attribute subtask:assignee:, for example: subtask:assignee:\"My user B\"\n- This query assignee:\"My user B\" will return tasks assigned to User B\n- This query assignee:\"My user B\" subtask:assignee:\"My user B\" will return only tasks assigned to User B AND tasks with subtasks assigned to User B\n. This is now fixed in the master branch. Thanks.\n. Do you use the date picker or do you enter the date manually?\n. This problem have nothing to do with Kanboard. The issue is related to the way that Apache is configured on your own machine.\nGoogle the error message and you will find the answer to your problem (https://wiki.apache.org/httpd/ClientDeniedByServerConfiguration).\n. This feature is now supported in the development branch.\nThanks\n. This feature is now supported in the development branch.\n. This issue is now fixed in the development branch. Thanks.\nDuplicate with #2201\n. You can remove a task from multiple places in the user interface with the dropdown menu. With your modification, after removing a task the user is always redirected to the board. The user should be redirected to the board only if he is already on the board view or in the task view.\n. This issue is now fixed in the development branch.\nClosing duplicate with #2198 \n. In KB 1.0.34, the moved date doesn't change anymore if the task is moved in the same column.\n. Tickets related to the calendar should be posted to the calendar plugin bug tracker: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-calendar/issues\nThank you. Thanks!\n. You should use a plugin that run custom migrations: https://kanboard.net/documentation/plugin-schema-migrations\n. This is available now.\n. This is issue won't be fixed because it doesn't happens with Kanboard > 1.0.28. The task overdue event is not handled by the notification subscriber. You just need to upgrade to the latest version and that should solve your issue.\n. Thanks for submitting a pull-request. The code have been modified in the master branch.\nSorry for answering so lately.\n. The Markdown editor have rewritten in the development branch. Those type of errors should not happen anymore.. I don't know, it depends of your own workflow.... Closing this ticket due to inactivity and lack of interest by the community.. Same as #3067. Upgrade to 1.0.30, this issue should be fixed: https://kanboard.net/news/version-1.0.30\n. This is now part of master.\n. I close this issue, you can propose any improvements on the release process on this thread #2301\n. Thanks it's now fixed.\n. There are already a lot of requests to improve the user interface in this bug tracker. However, the goal of this software is not make a clone of Kanbanflow.. Fix is available in the latest tag (v1.0.30). Thanks.\n. Thanks\n. It's a very good idea. I will look how other open source projects are doing that. Any suggestions are welcome.\n. Your suggestions have been taken into consideration: https://kanboard.net/news/release-cycle\nWe will try like that and adjust if necessary.\n. Thanks\n. Thanks\n. Of course I'm ok to have automated tests with Selenium. They can be written in Python or PHP.\nDon't need to test everything because maintaining that is very time consuming. Testing the most important flow should be enough. If you would like to start the first baby step, go for it :)\n. Merged your PR. Thanks.\n. This issue is now solved in the dev branch.\n. This automatic action is now available in the development branch.\n. Don't forget to update all your plugins.\n. Some plugins are not compatible with the latest version of Kanboard, for example Milestone is only compatible with v1.0.28: https://kanboard.net/plugin/milestone You may want to ask to the author to update his plugin: https://github.com/oliviermaridat/kanboard-milestone-plugin\n. This issue have been fixed indirectly by some code refactoring. The current implementation avoid to make unnecessary SQL queries.\nThank you for submitting a PR.\n. When the conditions of the recurring task are met, a new task is created automatically. The original task contains the task id of the new task and the new task contains the task id of the original task.\n. A new version have been published to fix this issue, you can download the version 1.0.30: https://kanboard.net/news/version-1.0.30\n. What is the authentication flow for a user? I assume that is similar to OAuth2, right?\n. You could use the user metadata to store the unique user id so you don't have to alter the schema. Or choose the hard way, create a sql migration in your plugin to add a new column.\nI was also planning to write a SAML authentication plugin for Kanboard but I didn't start yet due to lack of time. Let me know if you need some modification in the core.\n. The easiest way to send emails with the docker image is to install a plugin like Mailgun/Sendgrid/Postmark or to configure the SMTP method by using a custom config file.\nYou can also extends the image to install ssmtp or or postfix to redirect mails to another smtp server.\n. You have to use the SMTP method, not sendmail.. Why sass instead of less?\n. If you would like to contribute to the project and convert the existing vanilla CSS to SASS and integrate that into the gulp pipeline, I'm ok for it. Just try to not break stuff.\nThanks\n. If you are using OSX, the only thing you need to install is probably nodejs/npm. PHP/Apache is already included with Mac OS. Otherwise nothing special, you just need php.\n. Your PR doesn't change the task position (column position of the table tasks). If you edit a task and choose another column with existing tasks you will end up with tasks with the same position.\n. This issue is now fixed in the development branch. Thanks!\n. Task description is using Markdown. There is already a custom extension to parse #123 and generate a link that to this task.\nOn the technical perspective having tags outside of the task description seems to be easier to implement. I don't need to parse anything and I can display an autocomplete field.\n. The first iteration of the \"tags feature\" is now available in the development branch. Many improvements will come up in next versions.\nhttps://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/doc/tags.markdown\n. Yes, some of those settings are stored in the database now.. The demo have been removed and will be replaced later.\n. You can signup for a free trial of kanboard hosting: https://kanboard.net/hosting there are also other providers that offer Kanboard...\n. I reverted the pull-request that introduced this bug.\n. I do not plan to add such feature. If you really need that, the best way is to contribute.. Actually, this is a feature :) You can link tasks between different projects.\n. The project name is now displayed (only in development branch).\n. There is no plugin for that at the moment. What is Cuttlefish?\n. Unfortunately, I didn't plan to add such feature to avoid too much complexity in the software.. Since you are using a very old version of PHP, check if the magic quotes are enabled: http://php.net/security.magicquotes\n. Did you have a look to this page: https://kanboard.net/documentation/performances ?\n. Hi, I merged manually your different pull-requests because I cannot merge as is.\n- If you would like to translate the documentation in Spanish, I created a new folder \"doc/es_ES\". You should put the Spanish translation here (do not overwrite the English files).\n- When you send your pull-requests, make sure that your local copy is up to date with the latest master, do not include old commits that are not related to the current PR (have a look to the Github documentation to send pull-request).\n- Do not forget to keep the Markdown formatting otherwise the rendering will be broken.\nhttps://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/tree/master/doc/es_ES\nThanks for your work!\n. There are custom project roles now.. Tags are already implemented in the master branch like discussed on the bug tracker.\n. Predefined texts are available in the development branch.. This is defined by your php.ini, you have to change those values and restart your web server:\n```\n; Maximum allowed size for uploaded files.\nupload_max_filesize = 40M\n; Must be greater than or equal to upload_max_filesize\npost_max_size = 40M\n```\n. I need more information to be able to reproduce the issue. (Server, OS, PHP version, etc...)\n. This feature doesn't exists at the moment. There is already a discussion open for this topic, see #426.\n. What is the SQL error message exactly?\n. You have to get the exact SQL error in your logs to be able to determine the root cause of the problem.\n. See https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/pull/2349#issuecomment-228112922\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. There is already a Markdown editor for tasks and comments.\n. See #176\n. For the budget plugin, you should open your feature requests here https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-budget/issues\nThat will be useful to see if other people are interested by your suggestions.\nThanks\n. Please, move your ticket to the Gantt plugin bug tracker: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-gantt/issues\n\nThis will facilitate the work of the maintainers (bug triage)\nMake sure your ticket still relevant with the latest version of the software\nIf you are asking another feature request, do not hesitate to contribute, Kanboard is an open source project. Remember the famous quote from Linus Torvalds: \u201cTalk is cheap. Show me the code.\u201d\n\nThank you for your understanding. Merged, see https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/pull/2349#issuecomment-228112922\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. You could use this example for a working example: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/issues/2080. The layout of the dashboard has changed and this is now sorted by priority.. Did you have a look to this page: https://kanboard.net/documentation/performances ?\n. This issue have been fixed in the development branch. Thanks!\n. Yes, It's known issue, duplicate with #2045\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. Why do you need this feature?\n. I merged manually your PR to fit with the latest changes in master.\nFor the next time, do not forget to update the documentation and update the integration tests.\nThanks\n. Actually it was the expected behaviour. Anyway, now the role is preserved if the user already exists. This change is available only in the development branch at the moment.\nThanks \n. - You should upgrade to the latest version of Kanboard\n- Is the data folder writeable by the web server user?\n- Enable the debug mode, monitor the log file, then upload a file, if something is wrong you should see an error message that tell you you what is the problem. \n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. You should provide some details and context, it's impossible to say what is wrong based on your message. Your issue is probably only a configuration problem.\n. The class UserNotificationType have been renamed UserNotificationTypeModel in v1.0.29. Maybe, you are using plugins that send notifications, you have to update all plugins to make it work with v1.0.30.\n. The toolbar is everywhere now if you download the v1.0.35.\nThank you. Your translations must be moved to the folder doc/es_ES like I said in the previous pull-requests. Here, you are overwriting the English translation. Thanks for your comprehension.\n. I'm not able to reproduce your issue, can you give me an example of LDIF entry for a user and another one for a group?\n. Kanboard is now capable of receiving and sending emails. This is pretty basic but the system could be extended with custom plugins.. Did you also set the mail transport in the user interface (Settings > Mail Settings) in addition to the config file? or only in the config file?\n. Issues related to Gitlab should be posted here: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-gitlab-webhook/issues. If you have a problem \"Unable to connect to the remote server\" this a network problem. This is not related to Kanboard.. Make sure everything is installed correctly.\n. Try with the latest version, it should not happen anymore.\n. If you really need that, the best way is to contribute by sending a PR.. Sorry but to keep the code base simple this feature request won't be developed.\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. Can you provide at least some logs or error messages? something to troubleshoot... I'm using myself Kanboard with Docker and I don't have any unexpected restarts.\n. Unfortunately, I don't know why your container is not working properly. I propose to try again with the last version of the Docker image and with the latest version of Docker. If the problem occurs again, reopen this ticket.\nThank you. See https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-timetable/pull/10#discussion_r69293788\n. Thanks to report this issue, it's now fixed in the development branch.\n. To create a new documentation translation: \n- Create a new folder \"doc/ru_RU\"\n- Copy the English Markdown files to the new folder with the same filename\n- Translate the file contents in Russian\n- You can view the results from the application itself:\n  - Set the application language to Russian\n  - Open the dropdown menu on the top right (username menu) > choose \"Documentation\"\n  - Or use any desktop Markdown viewer or even Github\nIs there a way to include only the Markdown files from the work you have already done? 300 files is a lot, this is probably better to keep that on a separate repository.\n. I was about to merge but why there are extra blank lines and spaces everywhere?\nThe page formatting is broken for most of the pages:\n\n. Thanks, this is now fixed in the development branch.. You should try to deploy agin, this issue have been already fixed. Thanks.\n. Do you have configured everything like described on this page: https://kanboard.net/documentation/plugin-directory ?\n. The Zip PHP extension or the zip command line utility?\n. Thanks!\n. I don't really understand your request, you want a new settings to set a due date by default for tasks? What is the use case for that, any example?\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. What was the date/time settings initially?\n. You should try a more recent version of Kanboard because the date and time settings have been improved to avoid bad configuration/confusion.. Do you have the SQL error message from your debug logs?\nProbably due to the very old version of Sqlite on your system.\n. The code have been modified in the development branch. It should work now.\n. I don't want to spam people by sending too many emails. I should probably setup a separate mailing list for the beta announcements.\n. I merged master into the branch beta.\nThe nightly build is back: https://kanboard.net/downloads\nOtherwise you can use the Docker image for testing.\n. Sorry about the very long delay, your PR is finally merged.. What did you enter in the field \"Application URL\" in application settings?\n. Thanks for submitting a pull-request, it would be nice to address the comments and make sur the automated tests pass, they are currently broken.\n. Your PR have been merged manually (cherry-pick the commits and squashed into a single commit).\nYou should make a branch for each PR to avoid unrelated commits.\nThanks.\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. You could use the plugin mentioned above. Otherwise seems to be the same feature request as #2892. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. In the development branch, I removed most of the sidebar titles. Otherwise, the title is wrapped inside a div with the class \"sidebar-title\" that allows you to apply any style.\n. PR merged, thanks!\n. The user creation form have been simplified in the master branch. I hope that is better than before:\n\n. This is now available in v1.0.38. Merci\n. This is now fixed in the development branch.\nThanks\n. There is no restriction on the file type, what happening exactly when you upload a jpeg file?\n. What's happening when you click on \"Save\", do you have any error in the Javascript console or in your application logs?\n. If you activate the debug mode, do you have any more information?. I was never able to reproduce your issue, so try again with the version 1.0.38. If the issue still there, reopen this ticket.. Not yet.\n. Can you get the exact error message from your web server logs? Are you using IIS?\n. @esquawk Did you solve your issue after all this time?\n. @chamunks Your issue is not the same as the original ticket, @esquawk has a problem regarding IIS on Windows.. Tickets related to Mailgun should be posted to the plugin bug tracker: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-mailgun/issues\nThank you. Tickets related to Mailgun should be posted to the plugin bug tracker: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-mailgun/issues\nThank you. Use the log driver \"file\", and watch the application logs with docker exec -ti my-container tail -f /var/www/app/data/debug.log.\nPHP-FPM doesn't seems to output to stderr the application logs, only the PHP errors are outputted correctly.\n. There is no negation in search query at the moment.. - Plugins can now use the method getCompatibleVersion() to indicate the compatibility with the application.\n- Now, a plugin is not loaded if an exception is raised. However, due to PHP limitations this system cannot trap all errors.\n- This API endpoint https://kanboard.net/plugins.json list the compatibility between the kanboard version and plugins versions.\n- The hosted version of KB allows only a subset of the plugins and all plugins are updated automatically for each tenant.. Because the board is refreshed only if the project modification date is modified and comment events are not taken into consideration at the moment (See class ProjectModificationDateSubscriber).\n. The description is visible in a tooltip (icon at the bottom).\n. In the folder app/Template/board. In the development branch, the search attribute ignore the case now. Some filters have to modified to ignore the case for the value.\n. Are you sure that all tables are exported correctly? the schema version is stored in the table schema_version.\nIf Kanboard try to apply all the migrations, that means is not able to get the current database version.\n. Good catch, yes you can convert the table to InnoDB. I will change the code to make sure that use InnoDB everywhere.\nThanks\n. Do not forget to update the CSS, otherwise that introduce breaking changes: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/assets/sass/_board.sass#L13\n. This is now available in the development branch. Thanks.\n. That already exists:\n\n. Right click seems to be disabled in the Markdown editor.\n. The text editor have been rewritten in v1.0.35 and CodeMirror is not used anymore. So this is working now.. The upstream XMPP library have to be patched, see https://github.com/fabiang/xmpp/issues/19\n. @kierun that's nothing to do with Docker, the library that handle the XMPP protocol do not support self-signed certificates. See the link posted above.\n. Duplicate with #176 \n. Duplicate with #1932 \n. Can you make a unit test to validate that your PR fix the problem?\n. Thanks for submitting a PR but the code have been completely refactored to avoid those issues.\n. Unfortunately, I didn't plan to add such feature to avoid too much complexity in the software.\nAny contribution, pull-request or plugin to implement this feature is welcome.. In Kanboard 1.0.39, the list of comments are displayed in a modal box instead of a tooltip. You should not have this problem anymore.. You have to use double quotes when there are spaces into the attribute value: due:\"+ 7days\"\n. Tags are now visible in list view. (v1.0.41). Can you write a proper bug report to be able to troubleshoot something? thanks.\n. Duplicate with #304\n. Please, move your ticket to the Gantt plugin bug tracker: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-gantt/issues\n\nThis will facilitate the work of the maintainers (bug triage)\nMake sure your ticket still relevant with the latest version of the software\nIf you are asking another feature request, do not hesitate to contribute, Kanboard is an open source project. Remember the famous quote from Linus Torvalds: \u201cTalk is cheap. Show me the code.\u201d\n\nThank you for your understanding. The due date do not contains the time. Actually the drag and drop into a time slot should not be allowed.\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. I added a new template hook: template:header:creation-dropdown\n. What version are you using? this issue have already been fixed in 1.0.31\n. You should publish the code of your plugin somewhere. If you would like to publish the plugin on the website follow this link: https://github.com/kanboard/website#how-to-add-a-new-plugin-to-the-list\n. You should try with a more recent version of Kanboard, the worker have been improved a lot since the time.\n. The text editor have been rewritten in v1.0.35 and CodeMirror is not used anymore. It should work now.\nThank you.. You should contact Heroku's support because I have no idea what could be the problem.. The new hook have been added into master.\n. I updated the documentation for Windows: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/doc/cronjob.markdown#configuration-on-microsoft-windows-server\nBasically, create a batch file and add a new task to the windows scheduler.\n. Did you rename the file config.default.php to config.php (or create a new config.php)?\n. The priority is now always displayed on latest version of KB.. It should not happens anymore with the latest version of Kanboard.. - Create a new class that inherit from the original one\n- Use your own class instead of the original by changing the container, something like that: $container['subtaskTimeTrackingModel'] = function($c) { return new YourClass($c); };\n. You have an example here for the formatters but the same concept can be used for models: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/doc/plugin-overrides.markdown#formatter-overrides. The OR operator is not yet supported.\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. > Shouldn't lines 1203, 1204, 1195, 1196 end in %d?\nThe %s is replaced by a html link in this case, not the task number in plain text.\n. I don't know how your NAS is working but the tags are available on Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/kanboard/kanboard/tags/\n. I think there is some sort of caching on your NAS.\nThe cause of the problem is probably related to the fact that I moved the Github repository to the Kanboard organization. I also removed and recreated the Docker repository on Docker Hub because there is currently noway to update the source git repository for an automated build.\nThe tags you are seeing are the one available before I recreated the Docker repository.\n. Interesting: https://github.com/docker/hub-feedback/issues/687\n. Closing this issue because I cannot do anything about it. Only Synology can do something.... Closing due to inactivity.. That means \"after one year no body manifested any interests to develop this feature/plugin\". Of course, external contributions are welcome, Kanboard still an open source software. Since doing bug triage is really time consuming, this ticket has been closed to reduce the amount of work.\n. The regression introduced by PR #2439 is now fixed in master. Thanks!\n. It's now fixed in the development branch. Thanks.\n. Unfortunately, I didn't plan to add such feature to avoid too much complexity in the software.. This is now available in the development branch.. The layout has been changed since you posted this ticket. It should be better now, if not, then contribute :). You should add some integration tests, see:\n- https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/tree/master/tests/integration\n- https://kanboard.net/documentation/tests\n. Well, don't hesitate to contribute guys.. In Kanboard 1.0.39, the default assignee is not the creator anymore.. What did you define in application url in global settings?\n. Thanks!\n. This is now available in Kanboard 1.0.34.\n. I'm not able to reproduce your problem.\nYou should try to check the logs for potential errors when the problem happens:\n\nCheck the browser console\nCheck the web server logs\nCheck the application debug logs\nUninstall incompatible plugins\nMake sure your environment is compatible with the requirements. Are you sure that everything is installed correctly because those constants are defined: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/app/constants.php#L10\n. Ok, I see\n. @turjotuohiniemi replace the constants by the real value like it was before and probably find a way to add a unit test to make sure that this issue doesn't happens again.\n. The fix is now available in Kanboard v1.0.33\n. The menu entry is now present v1.0.39. This is now available in Kanboard 1.0.40. According to the error message, your script cannot access to http://10.0.14.252:8000. This is not really related to Kanboard but to your environment.\n. I'm not able to reproduce the issue, do you have the problem only with a specific browser?\n. You don't need to have both status open and closed in your query, you just need to remove all status filters.\n. The filter assignee is only for tasks. However you can use the filter subtask:assignee:\"John Doe\" for subtasks.\n. What do you mean exactly? moving the top menu (new project, ... search) to the left sidebar?\n. The dashboard has been simplified a lot in v1.0.41. The goal is to have a more responsive design, for now the sidebar is gone.... Why the scrollbar is annoying?\n. This element have been completely rewritten by using a custom ui component (in dev branch). jQuery chosen plugin have been removed too.. Available in v1.0.36, other improvements are coming in next versions.. It's now available in the development branch.\n. If you are talking about Kanboard Managed hosting, you have to export your database (SQL dump) and send the copy to support@kanboard.net. But that will work only if you are using Postgresql.. You can use tags instead.\n. Oops, I already made a similar change in master.\n. It's merged in maser, Thanks.\n. At the moment, the application URL is only used for notifications (email, slack..) to generate links.\n\nAs workaround:\n1. You can host the application in the same directory as the one in the reverse-proxy ( https://go.fifthlayer.net/kanboard/ -> http://gitlab.fifthlayer.net:8100/kanboard/)\n2. Instead of mapping the application to a subdirectory in your reverse-proxy, you can use a subdomain https://kanboard.fifthlayer.net/ -> http://gitlab.fifthlayer.net:8100/\n. I didn't try it myself but I believe that should work.\n. You have to create another series of datapoint based on the estimated and spent values and add it to the graph.\n. - Add a new section in analytics\n- At the end of your template, include a Javascript file that draw the chart with C3\nYou don't need to integrate your javascript code into the application js code. It can be loaded separately.\n. You should try again with the latest Kanboard (1.0.38). This is working correctly for me with Edge. If the issue still there, open a bug with absolutely all the details to reproduce the problem.\nThank you. If you really need this feature, the best way is to contribute to the project and send a pull-request.. Yes, sometimes the internal implementation is modified. Putting back the old value should solve your issue.\n. The text editor have been rewritten in v1.0.35 and CodeMirror is not used anymore. So this is working now.\nThank you.. You don't have to remove the user.\n1) You can wait 15min, check the user profile as admin:\n\n2) If you don't want to wait, you can unlock the user by reseting his password from the user interface\n. I added in the development version the possibility of unlocking users from the user interface. That should solve your issue.\nThe locking duration should not be more 15min by default. However, if the user still trying a wrong password, he will be locked for another 15min. This option is configurable: https://kanboard.net/documentation/bruteforce-protection\n. For the reason, see https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/app/Template/board/table_container.php#L23\nIf you know a workaround, don't hesitate to contribute.\n. The text editor have been rewritten in v1.0.35 and CodeMirror is not used anymore. It should work now.\nThank you.. Yes, that trigger the \"edit task\" form now.\n. Can you try with the version >=1.0.38? Did you set the right permissions to the folder data if you use the local files storage?. That probably doesn't run on your workstation maybe because you are using PHP compiled in 32bits (see: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/app/User/Avatar/LetterAvatarProvider.php#L145, PHP_INT_MAX is not the same size in 32 or 64bits).\nIt's working fine on Unix/Linux (see travis-ci build), unit tests will require some modification to run on Windows/PHP 32bits.\n. Duplicate with https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/issues/2544\n. Thanks\n. Unit tests are broken.\n. This is now merged into master. Thanks!\n. Well, don't hesitate to contribute.. Your PR have been merged manually. Next time, put your translations into the folder \"es_ES\", make sure you don't overwrite English translations (check the diff of your PR) and don't forget to be updated with master. Thanks.\n. Use their Postgres add-on to store the data, dynos are ephemerals. . Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I understand your point but I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited.\nThank you for your understanding. This is now the case.. I prefer to keep this software simple. If you need these features, you are probably better to use Jira.. The first 2 commits of your PR have been merged into master.\nThanks\n. If you use the latest master, this issue should not happens, can you confirm that?\n. This is now fixed in the development version (better late than never).. There is no offline mode planned at the moment.\n. Well, you can already do that?. This system can also be improved by letting the end-user enter the email address he would like for the project in a text field. That simplify the process and this code can be removed.\n. With the latest version of KB you could define a custom project email address.. It's already fixed in the development branch.\n. The fix is now available in Kanboard v1.0.33\n. Do you have anything configured in IIS that restrict the access (login or password)? The same HTTP header is repeated 2 times (WWW-Authenticate).\n. - Start date for tasks or projects?\n- Which date format did you define in your settings?\n. In version 1.0.38, the configuration of the date time format has been improved to have mistakes that leads to validation errors.. Merged manually (Do not remove english translations in your pull-request).\n. I like the idea, however the process of creating the appliance should be automated to simplify releases. Software like packer might be a good choice: https://www.packer.io\n. Closing this ticket due to inactivity and lack of interest by the community.. Instead of having a condition, you should use the new \"reference\" hooks: $this->hook->reference('my-hook', $listing);. This is more lightweight...\nIn your plugin you can alter the variable $listing like that:\nphp\n$this->hook->on('my-hook', function(array &colors) {\n  // do something with $colors..\n  $colors['pineapple'] = 'Pineapple';\n});\nFor the hook name, model:color:get-list should be enough. And do not forget to update the documentation as well. Thanks!\n. Can you address the inline comments and I will merge your PR? thanks.\n. I fixed the issue yesterday, it should work everywhere now.\n. Closing this because it was only for the dev version.\n. In this mode, the source of truth is LDAP not Kanboard.. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. If you need that, the best way is to contribute.. I definitively need to buy a bigger screen :)\nIf someone is good in UI/CSS don't hesitate to contribute.\n. In version 1.0.37, the task form is larger. Other improvements are coming to improve the usability.\nThank you. The fix is now available in Kanboard v1.0.33.\nIf that doesn't works correctly enter the dates again and submit the form. Otherwise, if you still having problem, reopen this ticket.\nThank you\n. The fix is now available in Kanboard v1.0.33\n. I found a regression, the keyboard shortcuts don't seems to work anymore (collapse tasks).\n. What is your screen resolution?\n. Thanks for the screenshots, that really need to be improved.\n. In version 1.0.37, the task form is larger. Other improvements are coming to improve the usability.\nThank you. @Imbasaur this feature doesn't exists yet, contributions are welcome :). It should be fixed with Kanboard v1.0.33 otherwise reopen this ticket.\n. Thank you for raising this issue, it's now fixed in dev.\n. The fix is available here: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/commit/6bad0523e581c6af1ab06dce726e2af1a08d9017\n. The fix is now available in Kanboard v1.0.33\n. Thanks!\n. Merged manually.\n. It should works with Kanboard 1.0.34. Everything that not starts with http or ftp is considered a local file (your browser should be configured to open the right application according to the link type).\n. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. This is now fixed in the development branch. Thanks.. This issue is related to the configuration of your server, not Kanboard. According to the error message, PHP is not even able to write session files.. Which web server do you use, IIS? do you have the php extension \"gd\" enabled?\n. Usually, you just need to uncomment one line in the php.ini. But, unfortunately, I don't know how your hosting provider is working. This is probably better to ask them.. This issue has been already fixed, you just need to upgrade to Kanboard v1.0.33\nThank you\n. Which version of Apache do you use and which operating system?\n. The RewriteBase is now part of the .htaccess.. The text editor have been rewritten in v1.0.35 and CodeMirror/SimpleMDE is not used anymore. There is no keyboard shortcuts, it should work now.\nThank you.. Unfortunately, I didn't plan to add such feature to avoid too much complexity in the software.. Events for automated actions have to be added to the list in EventManager class: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/app/Core/Event/EventManager.php#L44\n. Duplicate with #2892 . Merged manually, thanks.\n. This fix is now available in Kanboard 1.0.34.\n. It should work with KB 1.0.34 otherwise reopen this ticket.\nThanks\n. This is issue is related to the configuration of your server, not Kanboard itself. You should open the error log of the web server and you will see the root cause of the problem.. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. This issue should be fixed in Kanboard 1.0.34. Generated links in the email message should be absolutes and not relatives (the application url in settings must be defined too). \nThanks\n. I'm closing this PR until the comments get addressed.\nNote: For your information a lot of changes are happening in the Javascript code.\nThank you for your understanding. Can you try with the latest version of Kanboard? Can you make sure the PHP sessions are correctly configured? There is no reason that does not work with Chrome.. I'm currently working on removing heavy Javascript dependencies. As of version 1.0.35, vendor.min.js is 1.1MB and the size will continue to decrease in the next releases.\nDo not forget, that your web server should compress those files, for example the compressed size is about 323KB. Moreover, this file could be cached for a long time by your web browser. This is just matter of configuring your web server (Apache/Nginx/IIS).\nThank you. Unfortunately, we are unable to reproduce the original issue after all this time. You should try with the latest version of Kanboard and reopen this ticket if necessary.\nThank you. Actually, this is \"known problem\". I understand that need to be addressed. The initial issue report was not mentioning filters which is why it was tagged as \"unable to reproduce\".\nThe way that positions are calculated (server side) and the way the new position is sent (client side) need be revised to take into consideration non visible tasks on the board. This is probably not a simple fix. This is an interesting problem to solve.. To be able to reproduce this issue, can you provide the Apache version that your are using and linux distro version?\n. If your shared hosting do not support mod_env, you can remove the SetEnv line and set to true the constants ENABLE_URL_REWRITE in your config file. The result will be the same.. Merged manually, thanks.\n. Yes, there is no soft delete, the record is removed from the database.\nThis is not possible to keep a log of a deletion at the moment. The table schema have to be improved because a reference to the project_id or the task_id is used. There is a delete on cascade between references, if a task is removed the log entries are also removed.\n. Attachments are now removed when you delete a project (in dev branch).. Can you provide a screenshot?\n. Icons in menu items are now clickable in version 1.0.37.\nThank you. Icons in menu items are now clickable in version 1.0.37.\nThank you. I merged the commit about the translation. Other commits are the same as the other pull-request.\nThanks\n. With Kanboard 1.0.34, clicking on the black background will not close anymore the form.\n. @AlgyTaylor With Kanboard 1.0.40, if you would like to test your config, the most simple way is to send a task by email from the dropdown menu.. @AlgyTaylor Sorry, I read too fast your 2nd post and I missed the point. Yes, having a button to send a test email could be a trivial feature to implement.. Merged manually. Please, include only the files you have modified (check the diff). Thanks.\n. The dropdown will show only events compatible with the selected action this why you see only 2 events.\n. - Yes, your code is too coupled to the Kanboard code and any change will break your provisionning script\n- As far as I know, there is no open ticket for that\n- You can implement the missing feature in the CLI or the API or both, if you choose the API it would be nice to have an integration test\nDo you really need to autologin feature with the cookie?\n. If you still need to have these features, the best way is to write your own plugin or send a PR. Adding new command line tools or new API calls is pretty straightforward.. Which version of master are you using and which version of the Jabber plugin?\n. You can now download the version 1.0.7 of the plugin to avoid this error. Thank you.. This is fixed in dev, thanks.. Thanks!\n. Nice work! I'm not a java guy but it would be nice to see people contribute to your project.\n. Closing duplicate.\n. At the moment, this is the expected behaviour. However, you can restrict a user to work only on a subtask at the time by changing the global settings: https://kanboard.net/documentation/project-configuration\n. Tickets related to the calendar should be posted to the calendar plugin bug tracker: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-calendar/issues\nThank you. This PR is in conflicts with #2717 which is merged. I don't speak Russian, so I cannot tell which one have the better translation.\n. Be careful when you send a PR, the diff shows 1720 files modified. It cannot be merged.\n. With Kanboard you can have multiple projects and you can use internal links to reference tasks across projects. Example: https://kanboard.net/documentation/task-links\nIf you use Gitlab, you could use the webhook plugin to copy issues from Gitlab to Kanboard. But at the moment, this is a one-way synchronization.\n. At the moment, it's a bit tricky to implement a feature like that.\nThe best way is probably to extend the custom project role available in the development branch. You can apply restrictions based on the columns, for example you can move tasks only between the column A and B.\nYou could implement a new restriction that force tasks to have internal links.\n. If you really need this feature, the best way is to contribute to the project to implement the missing part.. What behaviour do you suggest? how would you like to configure that for your users?\n. Thanks!\n. You should try again with the latest version, it's working for me.\n. If you want to reset the admin password by changing directly the database, you can use the method described here: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/issues/853\nHowever, if you do something wrong, it might be harmful for your installation.\n. I included your improvements in the development branch.\nThanks!\n. Do you use any plugins, if yes which one?\n. What is the format of the source image?\n. This issue have been already fixed in the past. Upgrading to a recent version of Kanboard should solve your issue. (see: #578, #1376)\n. According to your error message, PHP try to allocate a large amount of memory for no valid reason. \nUnfortunately, I cannot really guess where the problem is coming from, especially if you install KB successfully on another machine with exactly the same configuration.\nThis version of PHP is very old, maybe this is known problem with this version, you could try to upgrade to a more recent version. Disable unnecessary extensions...\nSorry to not be able to help you.. To add a new command, you just need to create a new class into the app/Console folder and register this class in CommandProvider. You could do the same from a plugin.. Duplicate with #944 . Same as #3098.. What did you put in your config file?\n. @fabryss I cannot really reproduce this issue. I'm using the debug mode myself. Something is probably wrong is your config file. You should put a copy here to allow people to troubleshoot something. Thank you. Can you try again with Kanboard 1.0.38? (Your issue might be related to your hosting provider.). This is already available, click on the overview tab and then you can attach a file to the project.\n. Actually, you can already receive notifications when a task is created. The project members have to change their settings to receive all notifications. However, receiving everything might be a little bit spammy.\n. Actually, you can already receive notifications when a task is created.

Thank you very much for your contribution. The translations have been integrated manually into the master branch: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/app/Locale/de_DE/translations.php\n. This is up to date. Thanks.\n. This is now possible in version 1.0.39. This is now fixed in v1.0.38. Can you provide the exact SQL error message? (this is visible in the debug logs when activated)\n. Do you still have the problem with the latest version of Kanboard (1.0.37)?. Unfortunately, we are unable to reproduce the original issue after all this time. You should try with the latest version of Kanboard and reopen this ticket if necessary.\nThank you. Closing, unable to reproduce. Try again with a more recent version of KB.. Thanks!\n. What about using categories?\n. Can you give more details about your environment (OS, PHP version, Browser, Kanboard version, etc.) ? Are you using PHP 5.3 with magic_quotes_gpc on?\n. This feature have been implemented in the development branch.. Task list is the now the same everywhere and with tags.. Tickets related to the calendar should be posted to the calendar plugin bug tracker: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-calendar/issues\nThank you. Duplicate of #2746. This is probably better to send a pull-request if you would like to have this feature.. Are you sure that the problem is coming from Kanboard and not your web server configuration? Did you watch the error log files of your web server?\n. That seems to be related to your Apache configuration (\"client denied by server configuration\"). Not by Kanboard itself. Did you try with the latest version of Kanboard?. What kind of tool do you use to add a photo using JFIF standard in your LDAP server?. Kanboard is working with PHP 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6 and 7.x\n. Why not sending a pull-request?. This is now merged.. Do you have this issue with the latest version of Kanboard? (1.0.39). I have never been able to reproduce this issue after all this time. You seems to be the only one to have this problem. Unfortunately, you will have to investigate by yourself and potentially submit a patch.. You have to change the php config file. You can do that by creating a new Docker image that inherits from the official one.\n. This is now included in the documentation. Thanks.. This is now working in version 1.0.37. Other improvements are coming to improve the usability. Some ui components have to be rewritten to be able to do everything with the keyboard.\nThank you. Thank you for your contribution but I took another approach to implement this feature. I added the close button for all inline popups.\n. In the development branch, a close button have been added to all inline popups in addition to the keyboard shortcut.\n. This is available in v1.0.35 now.. I do not plan to add such feature. If you really need that, the best way is to contribute :). Instead of adding an explanation, the label of the fields could be renamed:\n- Username -> Login\n- Name -> Full Name\n. The mobile view is improving release after release. This work is made by iteration and takes time. Some UI components need to be rewritten from scratch.\nIn Kanboard 1.0.39, the task creation form is better than before. At least, this is working correctly on my iPhone. I know that this is not perfect yet, but that still a on-going process.. This issue is related to your server environment, not Kanboard itself. The command line scripts should be executed from the kanboard directory.. Thanks!\n. Custom roles can now prevent task suppression.. Someone else updated the Italian translations almost in the same time as you. There are now conflicts detected on your pull-request. Can you update your pull-request to make sure that is accurate with master? Thank you.\n. The list view has changed a lot since your posted this message.. This is working as expected with the latest version. Reopen this ticket if you still have the problem.. The invitation feature have been added to the development version of Kanboard.. There is already a feature to reset the password for existing users. For new users, there is now a new feature (only in dev) that allow administrators to invite people. New users can choose their own passwords.. Issues related to Gitlab should be posted here: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-gitlab-webhook/issues. This is already optional.. Can you copy and paste your config file here?. Are you sure that vendor folder is up to date?. Thanks, I will check out.. Ok, feel free to send a pull-request. Thank you.. Unfortunately, Kanboard focuses on simplicity and the number of feature is voluntary limited.. Many people are not using this field to define story points or T-shirt size. I prefer to not enforce the value of this field.. Feel free to create a plugin :). Did you solve your issue since the time?\nIf you get this error that means the worker was not able to connect to the beanstalkd server. By default, the plugin assume the deamon listen on 127.0.0.1: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-beanstalk/blob/master/Plugin.php#L14. This is now implemented in the development branch. PDF attachments are opened in a new tab and rendered by the browser. Seems to work with Chrome, Safari and Firefox.\nThanks. This is already possible by using the custom filters.. This is now fixed in version 1.0.37.\nThank you. Actually, closing the modal box by clicking on the background was the default behaviour of previous previous of Kanboard. But people complains about that, because they could close a modal box with a form by mistake.\nSo, this feature have been removed, people can still close the modal box by using the keyboard shortcut \"Esc\" or the cancel link.\nHowever, a closing button was effectively missing, this is why this feature have been added into the current development branch.. Yes, having a confirmation before closing a modal box with a form would be the best approach.. The modal/dialog/confirmation boxes have been completely rewritten for version 1.0.37.\n\nImages are displayed with a \"slideshow\" and can be closed by clicking anywhere or Esc key.\nConfirmation dialogs can be closed by clicking on the background, or use Esc, or the close button.\nModal boxes with a form can be closed with the close button or Esc key, or cancel link.\n\nThank you. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. Duplicate of #2575 . Is it possible to update your pull-request without the Javascript changes?\nThank you. Commit #e244c9c is merged.. Thanks this is fixed now. This is probably better to develop features like that as external plugin. The forum is there: https://forum.kanboard.net/. You should provide more details about your issue because if you tell me that works everywhere except for one project, there is no way to guess the root cause of the problem.. No answer. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. Unfortunately, we are unable to reproduce the original issue after all this time. You should try with the latest version of Kanboard and reopen this ticket if necessary.\nTask A:\n\nTaks B:\n\nThank you. Duplicate with #2310.. I don't really believe the problem is coming from the C# stacktrace. You should provide more details, server logs etc..., there is too little information to be able to troubleshoot something.... Project templates are already available.\nWhen you create a new project you can choose to duplicate another project. The original project is your template.. Thanks, this is done in the development branch.. Duplicate with #919. At the moment, the creator_id is the current session user, if you use the user \"jsonrpc\" you will get 0. You could use a specific user for this.. Task IDs do not \"reset\", this is a auto-increment field in your database.. You should try again with the v1.0.38, a bug has been fixed regarding the default value in the example config file.\nSee issue #2955 (reopen if necessary). This issue have been fixed in v1.0.36 with PR #2875 \nThank you. The creation of the object GanttFormatter could be moved to a service provider and then you can create a new class that inherits from GanttFormatter. And finally, in your plugin, replace the formatter by your own object.. I made some changes in master, you can now override any formatter classes, there is an example here: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/doc/plugin-overrides.markdown#formatter-overrides\nAdding a plugin hook could work, but overriding the default class avoid to add hooks everywhere in the application, this approach is more \"object-oriented\".. Thanks!. This is up to you to configure your web server.\nSee: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/doc/installation.markdown#security. Which release page?. Unfortunately, this issue is not related directly to Kanboard but to your server configuration. Maybe, you should take a look to the official documentation of PHP.. This issue have been fixed in 1.0.36 by PR #2887 \nThank you. Thanks!. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. You can include KB in a iframe and do the authentication part with OAuth2 or whatever SSO system. But, I don't see the point of including KB in another Symfony app.. There is a generic OAuth2 plugin here: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-oauth2 It could be a good starting point.\n. Thank!. Can you provide all the steps to be able to reproduce the problem?. Which version of Kanboard are you using?. You can hide tasks on the dashboard based on the column. If you go to the project config > column > edit a column, there is a checkbox for that.. I'm closing this ticket. I let the community develop such plugin if anyone is interested.. Can you show your config file?. I didn't see any config file in your message.. - Check the Apache logs for errors\n- Check the browser console\n- Check if you have mod_security enabled\n- Check if all permissions are correct. Closing stale issue.. You could edit the file app/Template/board/view_public.php. Someone have to implement this feature.. This is now possible in master. PR #3063 has been merged.. This is now available in Kanboard 1.0.40. I cannot reproduce your issue either, here an example with the Python client:\n```python\n\n\n\npprint.pprint(kb.get_all_swimlanes(project_id=6))\n[{u'description': None,\n  u'id': 10,\n  u'is_active': True,\n  u'name': u'Default swimlane',\n  u'position': 1,\n  u'project_id': 6},\n {u'description': u'',\n  u'id': 12,\n  u'is_active': True,\n  u'name': u'Another swimlane',\n  u'position': 2,\n  u'project_id': 6}]\npprint.pprint(kb.get_active_swimlanes(project_id=6))\n[{u'description': None,\n  u'id': 10,\n  u'is_active': True,\n  u'name': u'Default swimlane',\n  u'position': 1,\n  u'project_id': 6},\n {u'description': u'',\n  u'id': 12,\n  u'is_active': True,\n  u'name': u'Another swimlane',\n  u'position': 2,\n  u'project_id': 6}]\n```. This feature doesn't exists yet. If you really need that, the best way is to contribute.. The doc have been updated.. Kanboard will never work with 5.2, PHP Namespaces are required and are available since PHP 5.3.. At the moment, there is no due date for subtasks. . Did you check that the column_id 2 belongs to the project_id 3?. You could get the columnId with the API call \"getColumns\".. Duplicate, see #2575 for explanation. Why is it really necessary?. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\n\n\n\nThank you for your understanding. Duplicate with #1804 . Yes, SwiftMailer has been updated in master.. This is now available in version 1.0.37.\nThank you. Actually you can have both local and LDAP users. However, the local users must be not be present in your LDAP directory. Kanboard try first to contact LDAP then the local database.. Try a recent version of KB, there is more logs. That will probably help you to find this issue.. I'm not able to reproduce your issue, I tested with the same version of MariaDB and I can copy/paste any Cyrillic characters.\nCan you check that the table tasks has the charset UTF-8? (SHOW FULL COLUMNS FROM tasks;) The column title should have utf8.. Closing this ticket because no answer.. Can you try with the latest version of Kanboard and watch the debug log file when the problem happens?. No answer. Each plugin have the responsibility the define their compatibility with the installed version Kanboard. When plugins are not compatible they are listed as such on the plugins page.\nSince PHP is a shitty programming language, I cannot catch all errors that could be generated by plugins.\nAt the end of the day, you should not update blindly your installation. You should always check that each installed plugin is compatible. (and of course, check the ChangeLog for breaking changes).\nI know that this is not perfect, but the plugin implementation is more like a hack to satisfy the increasing demand of new features.. This element is now sorted alphabetically in version 1.0.37.\nThank you. In the latest version, the sorting is now by name and not id.. You can sort by priority and position in v1.0.43. To avoid cluttering the bug tracker, there is now a forum for open discussions: https://forum.kanboard.net/. There is no report like this.. Nice, don't hesitate to submit improvements upstream on KB :). There is no complexity for subtasks, only for tasks?. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. To avoid cluttering the bug tracker, there is now a forum for open discussions: https://forum.kanboard.net/. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. This is fixed in dev. thks. This is now fixed in version 1.0.37.\nThank you. Unfortunately, the scrollbars are placed by the browser itself. I do not have the control on that.. Can you try again with the version 1.0.38 and with new default config file? A problem have been raised in issue #2955.\nThe message \"skipped because invalid scope\" has nothing to do with LDAP authentication. This is the API access token auth provider that have been skipped.. No answer. Thanks!. The actual behaviour that you described is the expected one.. People that are member of the project and have notification enabled.. At the moment, you can show or hide a column directly on the board by clicking on the title.. There is a dropdown menu that allows you to edit the task (ok 2 clicks).. When I click on a task I prefer to see the content, the subtasks, the comments, the links, not editing the task.. This is now available in the development branch.. Available in v1.0.39. Tickets related to the calendar should be posted to the calendar plugin bug tracker: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-calendar/issues\nThank you. The start date is now available via the API.. Thank you very much for these improvements. This is really appreciated since I'm not a native English speaker.. Which version of Kanboard do you have? (the version number on the settings page not the Docker tag). Can you try with the version 1.0.37?. This is now fixed in v1.0.38. The session is managed by PHP itself. Kanboard doesn't do anything special except setting up the cookie parameters to the current directory.\nCan you give more information about your installation because your example if ambiguous:\n\nGiven the 2 installations of KB, for example\n10.0.0.2/project1\n10.0.0.2/project2\n\nWhat is project1 and project2 for you? 2 different KB instances on the same domain?\n. I'm not really able to reproduce your issue. I installed 2 instances of Kanboard under the same domain on fresh ubuntu VM. The session cookies are correctly defined for each instance.\nFirst instance installed at http://mydomain/k1/:\n\nSecond instance installed at http://mydomain/k2/:\n\nI can use multiple sessions in the same browser window without any problem. Be logged as multiple users and I don't have any overlap.\nCan you provide the same information to compare?. Closing because no answer.. Do you have any PHP errors in the web server log files?. This is really weird. Do you have only those parameters in your config file?\n```php\n<?php\ndefine('DEBUG', true);\ndefine('LOG_DRIVER', 'file');\n```\nI will try to reproduce the problem with a VM and a fresh install of Debian Jessie.\n. @SwampFalc I was able to reproduce the issue on Debian Jessie.\nTry to change the default value of DATA_DIR to set an absolute path instead of a relative one, for example:\ndefine('DATA_DIR', __DIR__.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'data');\n. It should be fixed in v1.0.38. This is definitively a regression, this is now fixed in the development branch. The next release is coming at the end the week. Thanks!. This is fixed by PR #2970 . This is now fixed in master, next release is coming at the end of the week.. This is now available in v1.0.38. Can you try the version 1.0.37 and tell me if the problem still there?. It should be fixed in v1.0.38, let me know if there is any problem about that.. This is a regression due to some refactoring, this is now fixed in the development branch. Thanks!. This is now fixed in v1.0.38. I'm not able to reproduce your issue. Try the version 1.0.38 and please provide more details to be able to troubleshoot something.. Did you try with a more recent version of Kanboard? LDAP should not make any difference here, the system read the users from the database.. You didn't give me any details to be able to reproduce the issue. This is working for me with LDAP.. I have never been able to reproduce this issue after all this time. You seems to be the only one to have this problem. Unfortunately, you will have to investigate by yourself and potentially submit a patch.. This change have been already implemented in pull-request #2431.\nNote: templates should not contains any logic.. Thanks!. https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/assets/js/src/Gantt.js. Is it really necessary to implement such feature?. You could find these answers in the documentation: https://kanboard.net/documentation. This is up to you to define how you structure your projects into Kanboard.. This is now available in the development branch.. There is a separate export for subtasks.. This is now implemented by PR #3068 . This is now available in Kanboard 1.0.40. It should be fixed in v1.0.38, let me know if there is any problem with that.. You should try the latest version of Kanboard (1.0.38). This PR #2950 adds the support for modification date in comments.. All existing comments will have the same creation and modification date after the migration because the modification date field was not present before. If you modify a comment now, the modification will be updated.. Ah sorry, I misread your ticket. Can you explain why you need such feature?. It should be fixed in v1.0.38, let me know if I forgot something.. - Do you have any errors in log files (KB logs and web server logs)?\n- Is the files are present in the data folder?. To avoid cluttering the bug tracker, there is now a forum for open discussions: https://forum.kanboard.net/. Please, move your ticket to the Gantt plugin bug tracker: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-gantt/issues\n\nThis will facilitate the work of the maintainers (bug triage)\nMake sure your ticket still relevant with the latest version of the software\nIf you are asking another feature request, do not hesitate to contribute, Kanboard is an open source project. Remember the famous quote from Linus Torvalds: \u201cTalk is cheap. Show me the code.\u201d\n\nThank you for your understanding. Thank you, I merged manually your translations.\nIf you have some difficulties to create a pull-request, there is guide here: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/. Your translations have been merged manually into the development branch of Kanboard.\n\nWhen you send new translations, make sure that you use the latest version of Kanboard.\nPlugins translations are stored into the plugin code bases: https://github.com/kanboard (projects that starts with plugin-*)\n\nThank you!. It should be fixed in v1.0.39. I'm really not able to reproduce your problem. Can you provide more details? (potential errors in browser console, screenshots, browser version, something to troubleshoot, etc..). You should try again with the latest version of KB.. This issue should be fixed in Kanboard 1.0.39.\nC3js, the library that generate the chart was changing the order of the stack.\nIf that doesn't work as expected don't hesitate to reopen this ticket.\nThank you. Can you try the version 1.0.38 of Kanboard?. The docker image tagged as v1.0.38 is built automatically from this repository and the stable tag is build manually from the repo https://github.com/kanboard/docker\nI will try to improve that for the next release.. In the upcoming v1.1.1, the tag stable will be deprecated and only tagged versions will be available.. As of now, the Docker image contains the version number or the commit hash if using latest docker tag. Will be available after releasing v1.1.1.. This is probably a permission problem on the data folder. Can you check that the data folder is writeable by the IIS user?. Are you using LDAP or any kind of external authentication?. Depending of your configuration it could be the expected behaviour. Each time, the user login his LDAP profile is synchronized to Kanboard database.\nDid you enable LDAP group synchronization?. If you have enabled LDAP group sync, the source of truth is LDAP, each time the user will login, the data that come from LDAP will override the data in the local database.. Gantt chart issues should be moved to this bug tracker: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-gantt/issues. I don't think the problem is coming from the ldap_bind() parameters but from the SSL connections.\n\nIs the Kanboard config working without SSL? (port 389 instead of 636)\nThe code snippet above is executed on the same machine as Kanboard is installed?\nI would like to reproduce your issue, how can I setup a AD with SSL enabled? installing certificate service is enough?. Do you guys try these settings: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/doc/en_US/ldap-authentication.markdown#example-for-ldaps-ssl-encryption. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\n\nThank you for your understanding. In your scenario, the automatic actions and the recurrence will be executed, both system will modify the due date one after the other one. There is no mechanism to detect that you have configured both.. You should try with the version 1.0.38 of Kanboard because the implementation is completely different. Before it was using VueJS.\nIf you get the same result with 1.0.38, check the browser console if there are any Javascript errors.. The documentation has been updated. Thanks.. Thank you, I understand your concerns. But most of the time, duplicated tickets create more work in bug triage.... I'm not able to reproduce your issue with v1.0.38. Can you check if you have any Javascript errors in the browser console?. - Can you copy the HTML source code of the first screenshot to see what have been rendered?\n- Do you have the same behaviour for files attached on the project (not tasks)?. Ok, the 2nd HTML source tells me that you still have files from an old version of Kanboard. The remove link is rendered as:\nhtml\n<a href=\"/?controller=TaskFileController&amp;action=confirm&amp;task_id=70&amp;project_id=4&amp;file_id=1\" class=\"popover\" title='' >Remove</a>\nThe CSS class \"popover\" doesn't exists anymore.\nThis is probably due to the way you updated Kanboard.. Is the permissions of the data folder are corrects?. It should work regardless of the version of PHP.\n\nThe owner/group of the data folder are correct? the web server user is able to write in this folder?\nDo you have a custom config file? if yes, what is the value for the data folder, is the path absolute?. If you remove this line, the authentication will not use any password.\n\nThere is no reason that complex passwords should not work, how did you come to this conclusion? . Ok so I close this ticket.. There is no negation at the moment. Contributions are welcome.. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. Your PR is merged now.. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. Well, send a pull-request and we will see.... Is the LDAP user working correctly independently of Kanboard:\n\n[error] LDAP authentication failure for \"kanboardsystemuser\"\n\nThe error reporting has been improved in v1.0.39, maybe that will help you to find the problem. I assume that you checked the examples provided in the documentation: https://kanboard.net/documentation/ldap-configuration-examples ?\nFor your information, you just open sourced your LDAP password:\n\ndefine('LDAP_PASSWORD', 'dQA6CACom8EeGF');. Well, I cannot troubleshoot your LDAP configuration for you. Double check your config file according to the documentation.. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\n\nThank you for your understanding. You should take a look to the class ProjectRoleHelper. If some features are missing, you could send a pull-request.. You could make a prototype to validate that works correctly. I don't know what will be the behaviour if the file is replaced while in use.. This is now merged into master.. This is now fixed by PR #3046. Thanks!. Available in Kanboard 1.0.40. This is now fixed by PR #3047. Thanks!. Available in Kanboard 1.0.40. This feature is back in v1.0.41. I'm not really able to reproduce this issue with the information provided. The button will be disabled until you select files or drag and drop files. Can you provide more details? (screenshots, Javascript errors from the browser console if any). Thank you, I was able to reproduce the problem. It should be fixed now in the development branch.. Available in Kanboard 1.0.40. The fix is available in Kanboard 1.0.40. Thanks!. Thank you, your PR is merged. I just made some minor improvements.. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. The unit tests doesn't pass because this translation is empty: 'The email project must be unique across all projects' => '',. Yep, I modified the string. Thanks!. This behavior has been improved in the development branch.. Tickets related to the calendar should be posted to the calendar plugin bug tracker: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-calendar/issues\nThank you. You should upgrade to Kanboard 1.0.39 because this issue has been fixed if I remember correctly.. Why not use the URL location when you are on the task view page?. Nested groups is not implemented/supported. If you need this feature, send a pull-request.\nSee https://docs.kanboard.org/en/1.2.8/admin_guide/ldap_groups.html. Most plugins have been migrated to work with Kanboard 1.0.39. But you should see at least some of them. The software is doing an API call to https://kanboard.net/plugins.json. Perhaps, you could validate that your server is contacting correctly this URL.. As I said, the list of plugins is downloaded from Kanboard's website. Check that you server is able to communicate with the URL mentioned in my previous comment. This operation is done server side, what is happening in your browser console is completely different.. Fixed by PR #3071 . Available now in Kanboard 1.0.40. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin as discussed before.\nThank you for your understanding. Comments are already there and notifications too, what should be different?. Tickets related to the calendar should be posted to the calendar plugin bug tracker: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-calendar/issues\nThank you. 1. You should upgrade to the latest version. \n2. Take a screenshot of what is happening exactly. \n3. Watch the logs while the problem occurs.\n. What kind of firewall do you use? if you are using a system (web application firewall) that modify/alter the Javascript code on the fly, there is unfortunately not much that can be done at the application level (Kanboard).\nYou will probably have the same problem with any kind of web application that go through your firewall.\nPerhaps, you could disable some rules on your firewall or whitelist Kanboard.. I understand but unfortunately there is not much that can be done in the application itself.\nThe only thing that could done is to change the configuration of your Firewall. Or try to use HTTPS to avoid the content inspection of your Firewall.. - Is this the only SQL query that fail in migration 122? the other one are working properly?\n- Which version of Mysql are you using?. I updated the Mysql migration, can you try again if you still of version 121?. This is not the same error. What did you do the first time that fail? did you try to run SQL query manually?. @Busfreak I fixed the first error in this commit: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/commit/3d7a682ec794b7485fc979ca910e22c6438a3c26\nIf you retry with a fresh copy of your database, it should work?. @Kolesar So it fail here: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/app/Schema/Migration.php#L17\nDo you have entries with the column \"default_swimlane\" at NULL in the table projects? (before to run the migration). I merged manually your automatic action. Thank you.. The closed tasks are visible on the board only if you set the filter to status: closed.. The first log message you posted has nothing to do with LDAP authentication. This is the personal API access token authentication that is skipped.\nOtherwise, in debug log files you should have more information about LDAP.. Closing due to inactivity.. Not everyone have the same usage as you. I can find requests where people are asking the opposite. Sometimes, you would like to open link in the same tab and sometimes not. Since it's pretty hard to guess the intention of people, I prefer to leave the default behaviour of the web browser.. External task links are now opened in a new tab.. Duplicate with #1885 .

The user \"jsonrpc\" is not a real user, the transitions table requires a logged Kanboard user to create a record.. To avoid cluttering the bug tracker, there is now a forum for open discussions: https://forum.kanboard.net/. Fixed in PR #3680. To have more context and to understand the issue:\n\nLook at the schema migration code: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/app/Schema/Mysql.php#L13-L21\nLook the data migration: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/app/Schema/Migration.php#L7-L54\nThe error message says \"Duplicate entry 'Default swimlane-40' for key 'name'\"\nIf you look at the final SQL schema: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/app/Schema/Sql/mysql.sql#L488, you can see that you cannot have duplicate name for a swimlane into the same project\n\nBasically, the goal of this migration is to remove the concept of default swimlane. Perhaps, there is a edge case that have been forgotten.\nYou could check that you do not have a normal swimlane that have the same as the old default swimlane before the migration.. I assume that this problem is solved.. Your changes have been integrated into master manually by this commit https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/commit/5b7e137f769e352e0dddeff6c0c9a19602a8e4d9. Can you enable the debug mode and copy the exact SQL error here?. Can you copy and paste the logs visible in debug mode?. You have to use the shareable link of your Google document to see the title.\nThis feature is not able to access to private Google documents.. You could write a plugin that override the templates. See https://kanboard.net/documentation/plugins. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. See https://kanboard.net/documentation/performances. This is the main improvement of the version 1.0.41. If you really need this feature, you could create a plugin or contribute.. I tried your PR on a iPad but your changes breaks the compact/horizontal mode of the board.. Closing stale PR.. Please, can you make a proper bug report by using the provided template? (otherwise I will be forced to close your ticket). Which authentication backend do you use, reverse-proxy?. The API doesn't supports authentication in reverse proxy mode. Someone have to implement this feature.. Can you provide a screenshot/video/gif?. After all this time, I'm still not able to reproduce this issue. Try again with the latest version of KB. If the problem persist, try to investigate by yourself and submit a patch.. The old dashboard is back in latest version of KB.. Even if I like Golang, I don't really have the time right now to rewrite everything. Do not forget that there are dozen of plugins too (Gogs don't even have a plugin interface).\nSwitching to Go will simplify the installation (single binary) and probably leads to better performances. But I'm not sure that justify to put all the existing code to the trash.. @sailfish009 I know very well what is Golang, I already write several software in Go, you don't need to give a sales pitch. There are so many factors that you didn't take into consideration.. @RRRRoger Bulk operations are now available in the current development branch. As of now, this is only in the list view.. This is really constructive.\nEach time something change, there is half of people who like the changes and the rest that complaint because something has changed.\nBy the way, this post is really worth reading: https://nolanlawson.com/2017/03/05/what-it-feels-like-to-be-an-open-source-maintainer/. To avoid cluttering the bug tracker, there is now a forum for open discussions: https://forum.kanboard.net/. Please, move your ticket to the Gantt plugin bug tracker: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-gantt/issues\n\nThis will facilitate the work of the maintainers (bug triage)\nMake sure your ticket still relevant with the latest version of the software\n\nIf you are asking another feature request, do not hesitate to contribute, Kanboard is an open source project. Remember the famous quote from Linus Torvalds: \u201cTalk is cheap. Show me the code.\u201d. Sorry about that.. Duplicate with #85 . If you upgrade to the latest version of Kanboard, there is no concept of default swimlane anymore.. This feature doesn't exists.. Please, move your ticket to the Gantt plugin bug tracker: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-gantt/issues\n\n\nThis will facilitate the work of the maintainers (bug triage)\n\nMake sure your ticket still relevant with the latest version of the software\nIf you are asking another feature request, do not hesitate to contribute, Kanboard is an open source project. Remember the famous quote from Linus Torvalds: \u201cTalk is cheap. Show me the code.\u201d. Duplicate with #2575. Duplicate with #2495. The old dashboard is back in more recent version of KB.. The default columns are used only when creating a new project. That will never update existing boards.. Are your sure that everything is installed correctly? do you have errors in your logs?. Your problem is not related to Kanboard but to your migration from Sqlite to Postgres. The table structure that you copy and paste here might contains the answer to your question: creator_id intege,. It's up to you. It was left as is because Sqlite is too limited for alter table.\n\nThanks for your pull-requests by the way :)\nClosing this since you find the root cause of the problem.. Thanks!. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I understand your point but I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited.\nThank you for your understanding. What do you mean? the url seems ok.. You should check that you don't have arg_separator.output to &amp; in your php.ini\nIssues related to Rocket chat should be posted on the the plugin bug tracker: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-rocketchat/issues. Thanks your translations have been merged manually.. See: https://kanboard.net/documentation/ldap-authentication and https://kanboard.net/documentation/ldap-configuration-examples. Users have to login first. However, you can write a custom script the create the users in advance via the API.. Please, can you make a proper bug report?. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited.  I cannot make everything configurable. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. Yes, there is a typo in the doc, you have to call the script cli, not kanboard.. This is now available in the development branch.. Yes, you can already save your filters by using custom filters.. Are you sure that everything is installed correctly?. Same request as #3251. Do you know if the cronjob is running correctly?. The config of php-cli could be stored in a different place than the php-fpm or mod_php for some linux distro. You can check with php -m | grep pdo_mysql.. Please, move your ticket to the Gantt plugin bug tracker: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-gantt/issues\n\nThis will facilitate the work of the maintainers (bug triage)\nMake sure your ticket still relevant with the latest version of the software\nIf you are asking another feature request, do not hesitate to contribute, Kanboard is an open source project. Remember the famous quote from Linus Torvalds: \u201cTalk is cheap. Show me the code.\u201d. Are you sure that Kanboard is the right tool for that?. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\n\nThank you for your understanding. What is mysql2?. LDAP groups are imported only when they are used in Kanboard.\n\nIf you add a LDAP group to a project, this group should appear in the group management section.\nDuring the login, if a user is a member of this LDAP group, he will be added as a group member in Kanboard as well.\n\nIf this behavior doesn't work, enable the debug mode and watch the log file to see what is happening really.. Duplicate with #831. The fix is available in v1.0.43. Thanks @Busfreak for the PR!. There is now a basic print stylesheet in place. You can send pull-requests for improvements.. You could modify the templates here: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/tree/master/app/Template/notification. @izno You could write a plugin for a different notification type and change the way that email are sent. See https://kanboard.net/documentation/plugin-notifications. Adding a custom entry-point that chmod/chown the folder during startup could solve the issue or changing the permissions of the folder on the host could do the same.. There is now an entrypoint that chown the folders when the container is started. That should solve your issue.\nSee https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/docker/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh#L3-L4. I would prefer someone who speaks German to fix typos :). So yes, you could send another PR.. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I understand your point but I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited.\nThank you for your understanding. The number of events is hard-coded to 1000, you could bump the value if necessary: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/app/Model/ProjectActivityModel.php#L28. Duplicate with https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-gantt/issues/1. It should be fixed in version 1.0.43 and Gantt plugin v1.0.1. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. I cannot make everything configurable. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. Can you check if you can solve this issue in the same way as this ticket: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/issues/3115 ?. This constraint fail because there are 2 swimlanes with the same name inside the same project. This might happens during the migration 112.\nBefore you upgrade, can you check if you have any swimlane that you explicitly named \"Default swimlane\": SELECT name from swimlanes WHERE name='Default swimlane';. If you have any, rename the swimlane name to something else and rerun the migration.\nThe goal of this migration is to remove the concept of default swimlanes. All \"fake\" default swimlanes are converted to real swimlanes.\n. Is it possible for you to send me a sanitized version of your database? If yes my email: fred@kanboard.net (it will be easier to troubleshoot this issue). @SchmilK What I mean by sanitizing your db is simply remove or override any sensitive information that you could have in your db (people names, emails, passwords...). Except for the tables that seems to cause the issue.. @SchmilK I'm closing this issue since you manage to make it works.. By the way, the SQL migration has been improved to avoid this problem in the future.. As far as I know, the LDAP attribute to fetch groups in user profile is memberOf for Active Directory, not member (take a look to the option LDAP_USER_ATTRIBUTE_GROUPS). \nThere are a couple of examples here: https://kanboard.net/documentation/ldap-configuration-examples. I have never been able to reproduce this issue after all this time. You seems to be the only one to have this problem. Unfortunately, you will have to investigate by yourself and potentially submit a patch.. I'm closing this ticket for inactivity. I let people from the community develop such plugin.. If you are using this software in a corporate environment you are better to use LDAP authentication.\nIf you really need this feature, the best way is to contribute to the project or create your own plugin. The goal of this software is to stay simple, we cannot add one billion features to satisfy all possible use cases.. As mentioned, you could write a custom plugin for that.. There is no official Android application for Kanboard, you should contact the author of the application directly.. It's a false positive from your antivirus. Not a Kanboard issue.. Thanks!. - You should check the permissions of the plugins folder and subfolders. That must be writeable by the webserver user if you would like to install plugins from the user interface.\n- Just in case, put the absolute path in to the plugins folder in PLUGINS_DIR . Your should check that you have all requirements to install plugins from the user interface: https://kanboard.net/documentation/plugin-directory. Thanks!. In version 1.0.43, you can now sort by start date.. See https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/app/Core/User/UserSession.php#L179\nNote: It's more appropriate to post your questions on the forum instead of the bug tracker. Please, use the forum to ask questions, not the bug tracker.. The PR has been merged.. You will probably need to contribute upstream to implement what you need or use task metadata.. @kiselli Project tags are now removed when a project is removed (in master).. Fix available in v1.0.44.. The fix is available in Kanboard v1.0.44. Thanks.. You will have to create a custom Mail client class the replace the method getAuthorName() and override the default one with yours in the container emailClient (take a look at MailProvider class).. The wrong contextual menu was displayed, this is now fixed in master.. The fix is available in Kanboard v1.0.44. Thanks.. The fix is available in Kanboard v1.0.44. Thanks.. The fix is available in Kanboard v1.0.44. Thanks.. @inful getProjectByName returns only the first project because this API call has been implemented when project names were unique. It's not the case anymore.\nIf you still need this feature, send a patch that implement a new API call, for example getProjectsByName.. There are conflicts detected by Github that prevent me to merge your improvements, please make sure your fork is up to date with master.. There is a role \"application manager\" which different from \"project manager\": https://kanboard.net/documentation/roles. If this user is manager, just go to \"permissions\" and add the members that you would like.. Your changes have been manually merged and improved in master with this commit: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/commit/3cf9484644dc5002b396eb31a2065456ce0de5b7. @on-jz If you already implemented this feature, do not hesitate to send a pull-request :). This is now possible in the current master.. This is now available in Kanboard v1.0.44. Thanks!. Can you enable the debug mode and paste the complete SQL error here?. Can you make sure that all SQL migrations are executed properly? You seems to not have the migration 102: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/app/Schema/Postgres.php#L15. The fix is available in Kanboard v1.0.44. Thanks.. The fix is available in Kanboard v1.0.44. Thanks.. Nope, but pull-requests are welcome.. The best way to make Kanboard compatible with mod_security is to contribute.. The fix is available in Kanboard v1.0.44 and Calendar plugin v1.0.1. Thanks.. The fix is available in Kanboard v1.0.44 and Calendar plugin v1.0.1. Thanks.. Someone else also updated the pt_BR translations, you could check here if everything is correct: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/app/Locale/pt_BR/translations.php. Your translations are available in Kanboard v1.0.44. Thanks!. You are not supposed to copy a Docker container from one machine to another one. A container is not a virtual machine.\nYou should have all your data in a volume or/and in an external database. Copy the data to the new machine and spawn a new container.. The documentation has been updated.. As far as I know, nobody developed a CAS plugin.. The documentation to create plugins is available here: https://kanboard.net/documentation/plugins. Instead of removing users, you could disable this user if you want to keep a trace.. Before to install Kanboard, you should make sure that PHP is working correctly. The procedure on Centos is described here: https://kanboard.net/documentation/centos-installation and https://kanboard.net/documentation/installation. If you check your Apache logs you will find the exact source of the problem.. The upload file size is defined by your web server config, not Kanboard. There is already an old ticket about that: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/issues/2353#issuecomment-228126908\nConcerning, the permissions problem, the procedure is already described in the documentation: https://kanboard.net/documentation/installation and https://kanboard.net/documentation/ubuntu-installation. Closing stale PR. Cannot merge until the comments are addressed.. This is now implemented into the development branch.. The task id is the auto-increment field of the tasks table which is common to all projects.. You seems to have reached the limits of Sqlite. The SQL query have to be changed to handle a large amount of tasks. Do you know how many closed tasks do you have?. Did you take a look to this page? https://kanboard.net/documentation/performances. This is the expected behavior. The estimated time in the task is the sum of all estimated time in subtasks if one of the subtasks have a value defined.. Manually added time doesn't appears on the timesheet. Only, the subtask timer write to this table.. You changes have been merged and squashed, thanks!. It should happen very rarely. In your case in was after a migration from local accounts to ldap. You could uncheck temporarily the checkbox \"Remote User\" to update the username.. With the current development branch, you can now update the username of remote users if you are administrator.. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. Please, make a proper bug report by using the provided template.. Is it really important? Having too many features increase the complexity of the software.. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. You have an example with curl in the official documentation: https://kanboard.net/documentation/api-examples\nReplace the token by the one of your Kanboard instance.. This ajax call render the whole board because you still need to update column headers (number of tasks within the column, sum of complexity, turn the color to red, etc...). There are also some automatic actions that could change some properties of the task moved (color, assignee, etc).\nA better way is probably to render the board client side in Javascript instead of server side in PHP. This could be done by using VueJS or ReactJS. But it's a huge change (don't forget that the software in multi-languages and plugins could alter templates).. You don't need to use Docker, you could create a virtual host for each Kanboard instance.. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. This issue is now fixed in the development version of Kanboard. The PHP version has nothing to do with this problem.. This issue should be fixed in version 1.0.45.. Which old browsers are you talking about?. Your commits have been merged into master.. I tried your pull-request but I'm not able to see the difference in the user interface. What is required to test this fix? What is your screen resolution?. I tried again your PR but there are some regressions on iPhone.. Closing stale PR.. PR #3734 has been merged, can you check if the problem is solved on your side?. Unfortunately, Kanboard is not compatible with mod_security.. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I understand your point but I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited.\nThank you for your understanding. It should be fixed in version 1.0.45. Thanks. I have never been able to reproduce this issue after all this time. You seems to be the only one to have this problem. Make sure everything is installed correctly, the database schema must be consistent. Unfortunately, you will have to investigate by yourself and potentially submit a patch.. Why?. Units tests don't pass.. Unfortunately, I cannot merge if the unit tests don't pass or if you introduce breaking changes.. See https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/issues/712. I'm closing this ticket because I don't plan to create a contacts plugin for now. I let people from the community to create such plugin.. This is working as expected for me.\nThis feature doesn't hide the column on the board. This feature hide the tasks inside this column on the dashboard page.. Seems to be the same as #3299. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I understand your point but I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited.\nThank you for your understanding. If you need this feature, the best way is to contribute :). Duplicate with #85 . You have to install nodejs and npm to get external libs, see https://kanboard.net/documentation/assets. Did you copy your previous db.sqlite to the new install? if not, you will end-up with a empty db.. Closing, no answer.. I do not plan to add such feature. The best way to to be notified of a new release is to subscribe to the RSS feed or to follow the twitter account.. - Watch log files for errors\n- Check folder permissions\n- Make sure that everything is installed correctly. You cannot delete columns that contains tasks.. The Brazilian translation is up to date now: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/app/Locale/pt_BR/translations.php. I'm forced to close this issue because you didn't even fill the provided template. Try to upgrade to the latest version.... It's there now: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/app/Model/CurrencyModel.php#L51. Make sure your hosting provider is able to handle Cloudflare SSL certificate properly. Especially if you use OVH. If you have a shell, try curl -v https://kanboard.net/plugins.json. Edit the templates.. The bug tracker for the calendar is here: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-calendar/issues. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. Did you take a look to the error message?\nCode=\"49\"; Error=\"Invalid credentials\"; ExtendedError=\"80090308: LdapErr: DSID-0C0903A8, comment: AcceptSecurityContext error, data 52e, v1db1\nTake a look to this link: https://confluence.atlassian.com/kb/common-user-management-errors-820119309.html. Tracked on issue #3789 . You have to run this command with a process manager like supervisord or systemd. That will not return to the prompt.. The documentation of supervisord is there: http://supervisord.org/, just define a command for the Kanboard's worker: /path/to/cli worker. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. You should make sure that everything is installed correctly. One again, check your logs for any potential errors.. You should check the browser console. Maybe you should take some screenshot of what is really happening.... We cannot see your screenshots in Github.. You have your answer now.\nDid you installed any plugin or custom CSS stylesheet that could violate the CSP rules?. There is something that violate the CSP rules. Perhaps, a browser extension? Did you try in incognito mode?. If you use LDAP, enable the group sync, and assign a role to this group. People that belongs to this group will have access to this project with the specified role.. @creecros You could publish your plugin on the website if you would like.. You could use an external link for that.. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin or to contribute to the project.\nThank you for your understanding. Nope, see #1804 . I prefer to keep the software simple. If you need these features, the best way is to contribute to the project.. Your PR has been merged. Thanks.. You can have only one email client. If you need mailgun and a custom one, you could inherit MyMailClient from the Mailgun client class.. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I understand your point but I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited.\nThank you for your understanding. @krustymars You could send a PR like you did for the edit icon :). Update to 1.0.46 to suppress the PHP notice, see: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/ChangeLog#L28. Update to 1.0.46, see https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/commit/3ba8b0462c682a66eda0120c0ebbc37ee740e39c#diff-cbda73c855698dadfdbc565785891f1c. Click on the dropdown menu and choose enable/disable.. This issue is not related to Kanboard but to cPanel. Try to use quotes.... a2enmod is only for Debian based Linux distros. This doc is only about the Kanboard configuration part. Configuring Apache is documented in your Linux distro documentation.\nOf course, you can still send a PR to improve the doc.. This is now fixed in the development branch. Thanks. You can create user by using these api calls: https://kanboard.net/documentation/api-user-procedures\nThere is no logout because the API is stateless.. Did you configure the cronjob?. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. See https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/issues/109#issuecomment-45261488. Looks like you solved your problem.. This is now fixed in PR #3840.. - In the the method initialize() of Plugin.php, use something like $this->cli->add(new MyCommand($this->container));\n- MyCommand class should extends from Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Command\\Command\n- Take a look into other commands: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/tree/master/app/Console. You could override the default header template and check the name of the controller, take a look to the AppHelper class.\n. This issue has been fixed in v1.1.0. You should put the source code of your plugin into a Github repository. That will allow people to improve what you did.. nice. You guys could easily create a plugin if you really need this feature.\nThis software should stay simple. The goal is not to add one billion of features to satisfy all possible use cases.\n. Unfortunately this issue seems to be related to the configuration of your web server, not Kanboard.. You should check if you have a plugin that is not compatible with your kanboard version. Try to unable the error reporting of PHP and watch logs.. Closing stale issue.. This is now fixed in the development branch. Thanks.. PR #3344 has been merged.. What problem are you trying to solve?. I still don't know why you need to sprintf the password... For me, your are introducing a bug/breaking change.. Closing stale PR.. Closing duplicate.. You should make sure that all files are copied (follow the documentation on the website).. A check has been added into the form. But that could happen if someone click on the button \"Set start date\".. You could create your own plugin or send a PR if you need that.. Unfortunately, there is no plan to integrate Zimbra into Kanboard. If you need this feature, you could create your own plugin.. I don't believe that adding an automated action is the best approach. Adding a task status \"open/completed\" or a flag on the column to ignore the due date would be better.\nThis is a duplicate of #3099. Moving discussion to #3099.. Thank you for this PR. It will require some time before that gets reviewed.. Actually, I'm not sure how to merge this PR because this is a big change on Kanboard internals.\nAs of now, the assignee was stored into the column owner_id of tasks and all features are based on that (automatic actions, stats, plugins, etc). Some kind of migration might be needed to avoid existing Kanboard installation to be in a inconsistent state.. No change as big as this one occurs in the past. Database migrations could be used to move old assignees to the new table. But, all existing code as to be changed as well to use the new system. This is like rewriting a large chunk of the app. The risk of introducing regressions is pretty high.. Closing stale pull-request.\nUnfortunately, this PR cannot merged as-is without a migration from a single assignee to a multiple assignees mechanism. Everything that depends on assignees have to be updated as well to avoid breaking changes. It's a major overhaul.\nIf anyone wants to improve and update this branch. Don't hesitate to open a new pull-request.. Some people use the complexity field for that.. Duplicate with #3175. 1. There is already a logout button in Kanboard, perhaps it's disabled by your service provider.\n2. There is feature request for case insensitive username: #2444. What are you trying to optimize?\nYou could send a separate pull-request just for the translations.. The translation has been updated manually.. If you are using LDAP with group sync, the source of truth is LDAP not Kanboard, at each login the LDAP settings will override KB settings.. I don't plan to write any migration script from Windows to Linux. However, you could contribute to the documentation if you would like.. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. The best approach is probably to write a custom plugin.\nThank you for your understanding. You should check that the path in the database is the same as the path on the disk.. You already asked the same question here #3384. The provided .htaccess doesn't require anymore mod_version since a long time. Are you sure that your .htaccess is not coming from an older installation of Kanboard?\nSee https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/.htaccess. Indeed mod_version is required. The documentation has been updated. Thanks. This feature is already requested here: #2235. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I understand your point but I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited.\nThank you for your understanding. I cannot fork your project because you already forked from kanboard/plugin-mattermost and Github doesn't seems to allow that.. Have fun: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-matrix. Do you have to possibility to upgrade to a more recent version of Sqlite?. I don't really understand what your are doing but start to remove incompatible plugins, watch logs on the server, the browser console and you will find out the source of the problem.. You should probably check if the Apache module mod_setenvif is available.. This is now implemented in the development branch.. Are you sure that your issue is related to Kanboard and not your PHP installation? Check the log files... Your database seems empty. You should probably start over with a clean installation.. If you need this feature, you could create your own plugin. It's not something that I'm going to add into Kanboard.. You should take some screenshots because I don't really understand your problem.. Closing stale issue.. Thank you, I integrated manually your translation.

Closing invalid bug report.. - Check the browser console\n- Check logs on the server to make sure everything is installed correctly. Closing, no answer.. Well, if you read the error message, that says the application is not able to find the Javascript files. Probably because you defined a relative path.\nNote that those JS files must be accessible by your web browser as well.. Did you try to define the application URL in settings?. Thank you!. Open the browser console and look for errors. If you are using Cloudflare, try to disable the \"Javascript optimization\".. In the same way as the application, the best way is to dig into the source code.. Closing invalid bug report.. I'm not able to reproduce your issue. Are you using the user \"jsonrpc\" or a standard user? Does the user exists? Are you using any specific configuration?. No answer.. It should be fixed now in the development version. Thanks.. How do you expect people to solve a problem if you don't provide any information to reproduce the problem?. well, well.... This folder has been included intentionally in the repo since this commit https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/commit/9e2b2a32fd0e967ad3184e9a5d091a29953acb91\n\nThis is mentioned in the ChangeLog\nThat allow people to download a ready to use archive by using git-archive or the download link of Github.\n. The automatic action \"Close a task in a specific column\" is not triggered by the cronjob but when you move the task on the board to the specified column.. You could send a PR to make it protected instead of private.. Your PR has been merged.. You should probably make a theme instead, see https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-example-css. I don't really understand, according to the error message, the application is not able to establish a SSL connection to your LDAP server. But in the \"Steps to reproduce\" you are talking about Nginx config, this is unrelated?. Instead of changing the schema for Sqlite, a more generic solution for all supported databases should be implemented.\n\nIt could be simple as adding an config parameter that lowercase the username if enabled. There is an open feature request for that #2444.. This option already exists for LDAP authentication. This is a simple strtolower(): https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/app/User/LdapUserProvider.php#L168\nYou could do something similar instead of taking the risk of changing the schema.. Your solution have to work with all supported database anyway.. From a security point of view, I don't believe that a good idea.. @TheElbenreich @zorn-v Usually you don't want to allow the web server user to be able to write/overwrite/delete application source code files. You allow only what is really necessary. You could even put the source code outside the document root. Otherwise, someone could exploit a security issue in the software and overwrite any part of the application to place a backdoor...\nMoreover, allowing the application to update itself from the user interface will raise many problems and edge cases. Package managers, Docker containers and deployment automation systems like Ansible/Puppet/Saltstack are doing a better job.\n@urbalazs Updating Kanboard blindly could lead to some issue, especially if you don't read the ChangeLog.. I added the command in the development branch.. Did you take a look to issue #3537? Did you watch the logs and the browser console?. It should be fixed in master, can you try it?.

Why do you duplicate your own issue?\nDuplicate of #3548. You can close these projects if you don't want to see them on the dashboard.. You have some missing PHP extensions. I updated the list here: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/doc/en_US/requirements.markdown#php-extensions-required. Look likes the SQL migrations didn't run properly for some reasons. When you run the migrations, make sure you have only one process that access to the database.\nYou could try to rerun the migrations from the command line: ./cli db:migrate or execute the SQL manually, they are located here https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/app/Schema/Mysql.php. Find the one you are missing and apply them manually.\n. See #3316 and #712. Sending a pull-request for this should be pretty straightforward.. I merged your PRs. Thanks.. You have to install/enable the extension pdo_sqlite.. Do you know what is responsible disclosure? https://kanboard.org/#security. Did you even try to reproduce the XSS mentioned on Parsedown thread?\nKanboard send CSP headers that prevent the execution of inline Javascript.. You should ask your questions here: https://github.com/ashbike/csv2kanboard/issues. I didn't try but I assume it will work with PHP-fpm/fastcgi.\nSome related information in the PHP documenttion: http://php.net/manual/en/faq.installation.php#faq.installation.apache2. Kanboard doesn't do anything specific regarding threading.\nYou could update this ticket to let people know if that work.. This limit has been removed in the development version.. PR #3618 has been merged.. Automatic actions are only triggered when the event occurs. It won't change the color of existing tasks.. The bug tracker for the calendar is here: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-calendar/issues. Same difference:\n```\n$ php -a\nInteractive shell\nphp > var_dump(time() === strtotime('now'));\nbool(true)\n```. The installation instructions are here if you are lost: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/doc/en_US/installation.markdown\nBy the way, there is a forum here: https://github.com/kanboard/forum/issues. These users have to be member of the project.\nIf you have questions, the forum is here: https://github.com/kanboard/forum/issues. I merged manually your PR.\nMake sure that your fork is up to date with master before sending your PR (take a look to the diff).. Now, you can download directly the archive from GitHub on the release page:\nhttps://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/archive/v1.1.1.zip\nhttps://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/archive/v1.1.1.tar.gz.

See https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/issues/3393 and https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/issues/109#issuecomment-45261488. Looks like you have the same problem as #3354\nYour LDAP server returns Code=\"49\"; Error=\"Invalid credentials\"; ExtendedError=\"80090308: LdapErr: DSID-0C09042F, comment: AcceptSecurityContext error, data 52e, v2580.\nDo you have any specific security settings for ActiveDirectory?. You should enable the debug mode to see the exact SQL error.. Why did you change file permissions from 644 to 755?. Is it happening when someone else is moving the same task?. Is it a large board with a lot of tasks (>100) as mentioned in the initial issue?. Well, I'm not able to reproduce the issue on my side.\nI tested on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. I created hundred of tasks into each columns. Moved tasks around without problem. No plugin installed.\nSome troubleshooting on your side will be appreciated to tackle this issue. I'm wondering if this is related to jQuery-ui or a plugin that breaks something.. Yes, I saw your video. I do not have a Windows machine at the moment (I have to test with a virtual machine).. I updated jQuery to the latest version in the master branch. Can someone test the development version to see if that fix the issue on your side?. You should take a look to the logs to understand what is going on.. You should take a look to the Apache logs, perhaps your hosting provider is doing some weird shenanigans. Make sure mod_security is disabled.. I updated the documentation.\nIf something is not up to date or inaccurate, you could edit easily the documentation from GitHub user interface and send a pull-request.. Duplicate with https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/issues/2575. The colons must be part of the translated string because it can be different for some language. For example, in French we write Auteur : not Auteur: for the English string Author:. Quotes and or other punctuation marks are not necessary the same either.. These translations must be part of the plugin itself. The documentation is there: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/doc/en_US/plugin-registration.markdown#plugin-translations. Did you read the docs?. - To be able to install plugins from the user interface, you need to install the zip PHP extensions (https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/doc/en_US/requirements.markdown#optional-php-extensions) and make sure the plugins folder is writeable by the web server user (ie www-data if you use Ubuntu), and the config param PLUGIN_INSTALLER should be enabled (which is the case by default)\n- If you want to install the plugins manually, do to not download the archive provided by GitHub but the one available on the releases page. For example, you can download the Calendar plugin here https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-calendar/releases/download/v1.1.0/Calendar-1.1.0.zip. The folder hierarchy should looks like: your-kanboard-folder/plugins/Calendar.. Closing duplicate. I cannot find the string Sign up  in Kanboard core (only Sign-up which is already translated). Perhaps you are looking to translate the Registration plugin? (https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-registration/tree/master/Locale). Are you planning to update this pull-request?. The Vagrantfile has been updated to PHP 7.. @cl0ne Only the date formats defined in DateParser::getParserFormats() are supported. If you need something else, send a patch.. This limit has been removed in the development version.. Someone made a plugin: https://github.com/bdeshayes/Kanboard-plugin-DemoData. If you add a new hook, can you update the docs as well?. I just tried with your text file, but I'm not able to reproduce the problem either. I tested with MariaDB/ PHP 7.. Your pull-request cannot be merged because conflicts are detected. Please, make sure your fork is up to date with this repo.. Are you planning to update your pull-request?. No answer.. This is now fixed in PR #3837. Thanks to @sudoman . This issue should be fixed in version 1.2.4.. You can update the documentation by sending a pull-request. See https://docs.kanboard.org/en/latest/developer_guide/faq.html#how-to-update-this-documentation. What is the point of adding MSSQL support? this is not a free and open source software.. Closing stale pull-request.\n@lastlink The point is not being able to run MSSQL locally. I'm aware that Microsoft have a Docker image. This is about maintaining and supporting this feature on the long term. Throwing a patch might be a first step. But since the comments haven't been addressed after a couple of months that means no body is really committed to maintain this.. There are some docs here: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/doc/en_US/assets.markdown#how-to-build-assets-javascript-and-css-files\nFeel free to update the doc if necessary. These files are part of the source tree for the same reason as composer dependencies. This is to allow non-technical people to download Kanboard directly from GitHub.. I updated these translations. There are new untranslated strings if you would like to translate them:\n'Assign automatically a color when preset start date is reached' => '',\n 'Move the task to another column once a predefined start date is reached' => '',. This is updated now.. Closing this stale PR, send a new one when the comments will be addressed.. Can you try again with the latest development version? I restored the old behavior.. The documentation has been updated.. The documentation has been moved to a dedicated website now: https://docs.kanboard.org/. You should try to check the logs for potential errors:\n\nCheck the browser console\nCheck the web server logs\nCheck the application debug logs\nUninstall incompatible plugins. No answer.. What is your concern? Miniflux is not dead, Kanboard is not dead.\n\nMiniflux 2 has been rewritten in Go. Technologies evolves. Miniflux 1 received very few updates during last years. I maintained this software for almost 5 years and people can use it for free. \nThe source code still there, the software still works. Even if I don't maintain the version 1 to focus on the version 2, this is an open source software, anyone can fork the old version. There is even a migration script to upgrade to the version 2.\nAs of now, no rewrite has begun for Kanboard. I cannot exclude this possibility in the future considering all the advantages that a Go version could bring. However, since Kanboard is more popular, if a rewrite happen, I will not archive the project, pull-requests will continue to be accepted.. This is now implemented as PR #4043.. These translations are not used in the application, it was an example from a PHPdoc comment, see https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/commit/f269f4e398837bd8ce6f0c16313b13575f002dfc. Only these ones should be necessary:\n\nALTER\nCREATE\nDELETE\nDROP\nINDEX\nINSERT\nREFERENCES\nSELECT\nUPDATE\n\nBasically, you need to be able to run SQL migrations and perform CRUD operations.. Take a look to this plugin: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-registration#self-registration-plugin. This is working as expected for me. Perhaps, you have other automatic actions that conflict with that one?. @sudoman There is an existing function to localize numbers which is also exposed as n(). Of course it could be improved. Doing something like that could work: t('%s hours', n(5.25)).. @cl0ne Because the gettext php extension is not always available and I'm too lazy to change everything now. If I had to start over, I will probably use gettext.. I did the modifications mentioned above in master.\n@cl0ne Sure, if nothing breaks.. You should post that on the forum instead or make it a plugin. All issues are going to be closed at some point.. This is not likely to happen because the changes required for each database type are not the same. Take a look in migration files: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/tree/master/app/Schema. You have your answer in the documentation https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/doc/en_US/plugin-directory.markdown#plugin-directory-configuration\n. FYI, you will not receive notifications for actions made by yourself. \nMake sure that you didn't miss anything from the doc: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/doc/en_US/notifications.markdown#configuration. You should try to check the logs for more information:\n\nCheck the Mariadb logs\nCheck the application debug logs\n. Take a look to the documentation: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/doc/en_US/centos-installation.markdown#centos-7. Use the plugin issues tracker..

You get this API response because you sent a malformed request to the API endpoint.\n\nTake a look to the documentation, there are some examples: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/doc/en_US/api-examples.markdown#example-with-curl. This API call is reserved for the special user \"jsonrpc\". This is why you get a forbidden access. If you use your user credentials, try another procedure, for example \"getMe\" instead of \"getAllProjects\"\n (https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/doc/en_US/api-me-procedures.markdown#getme).. This is already escaped: https://github.com/fguillot/picoDb/blob/master/lib/PicoDb/Table.php#L536. Administrators can see everything, however if they want to work on a project they should be members of this project to be visible in the assignee list.. Well, instead of adding more Javascript cruft, opening the image in a browser tab could be enough. Pretty much all browsers allows you to zoom in/out.. I added a link to open the image in a new tab.. Duplicate of #3186. I was about to merge but I don't see your latest changes in the pull-request?. The task link will show up in notifications if you set the application url in application settings.. I cannot guess what is wrong on your side. You should give more details, take screenshots to make sure there is no misunderstanding, etc. . Your issue is not related to Kanboard itself but to the configuration of your web server (cPanel).. This is now fixed in the development version.. What do you mean by \"processed\" in this context?. Enable the debug mode, and watch log files to see the exact sql error. Probably the sql migrations that didn't run properly.. I don't really understand what you are asking for (weblink?). But if the task URL is not correct, you must define the application URL in the application settings.. Ok, I see. A picture is worth a thousand words.. Doing this in JavaScript will probably no work because of Cross-Origin/Same origin policy in browsers.. You could add your plugin to the list on the website: https://github.com/kanboard/website#how-to-add-a-new-plugin-to-the-list\nNote: Issues that are not bug/improvements/feature requests are going to be closed automatically.. You should try to check the logs for potential errors:\n\nCheck the browser console\nCheck the web server logs\nCheck the application debug logs\nUninstall incompatible plugins. Unfortunately, I do not plan to add such feature into Kanboard. I understand your point but I prefer to keep the software simple, the number of features is voluntary limited. (duplicate of #790).\n\nThank you for your understanding. This feature doesn't exists. Kanboard does not enforce that.. Yeah I'm aware of that, don't worry. This is just a bad settings for the bot.\nThe policy is: feature requests are closed if nobody manifest any interest to develop the feature after a while or if this is against the philosophy of the software (focus on simplicity).. Closing this PR because #3764 has been merged.. The length has been increased in the development version to 255 characters.. It should be fixed in the development version.. This issue should be fixed in version 1.2.4.. The description field is using the Markdown syntax, you have a quick summary here: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/doc/en_US/syntax-guide.markdown#syntax-guide.

All right, I did it for you.. This is not going to happen magically. If you need something that nobody else is willing to develop, you should consider contributing to the project.. This feature request was open for 2 years. People rarely develop huge feature requests during their spare time. More details about this in the FAQ: https://docs.kanboard.org/en/latest/developer_guide/faq.html. You can now use the plugin of @creecros if you need this feature.. The application check every few seconds if you are authenticated. This is done via an Ajax call. If your server is not reachable you will be redirected to the login page. This software doesn't work offline.. If you add new API calls, it would be nice to update the documentation as well (https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/doc/en_US/api-json-rpc.markdown#usage). @thylo https://docs.kanboard.org/en/latest/api/project_metadata_procedures.html. There is no desktop notifications.. You should make sure the path in the database table match the path on the filesystem.. - Check the log files for potential errors (web server and application)\n- Open the image link directly in your browser (?controller=AvatarController....) and watch logs in your browser and your server\n- Check the column avatar_path in the table users (same for other uploaded files)\n- Compare with what you have on the filesystem\n- Make sure the files and parent directories are accessible by the web server user. If you have installation issues, please use the forum https://kanboard.discourse.group/. You should be able to replace the editor by overriding the method textEditor() of FormHelper. \nhttps://docs.kanboard.org/en/1.2.3/plugins/helpers.html. This plugin is marked to be compatible only with Kanboard 1.0.38 https://github.com/kanboard/website/blob/master/plugins.json#L612\nLooks like the author is going to update his plugin: https://github.com/stinnux/kanboard-Timetrackingeditor/issues/22#issuecomment-375221480. As mentioned in the documentation, Kanboard is not compatible with mod_security.. Kanboard needs to perform Ajax requests regularly. The request that you mentioned is made every 60 seconds. You could modify the source code if you want to change this behavior: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/assets/js/components/session-check.js. Emojis are not really supported with Mysql. The database have to be re-encoded in utf8mb4 instead of utf8.. This is now available in the development version but you should probably wait the next stable version. Some plugins needs to be updated as well.\nNote: Do not make any changes manually in the database, otherwise the migrations will fail during the next upgrade (and you will be on your own to fix that).. You should ask questions on the forum. This place is reserved for bug reports.\nYou could send a pull-request but do not introduce breaking changes for existing users.. Actually, it was like that before but people start to complaint because clicking inadvertently on the background was closing the modal dialog and they were losing data entered in forms. To prevent this, some kind of warning need to be implemented, for example a message box that say \"hey you filled the form, do you really want to close this?\".. This is now implemented with the pull-request #4044.. You should ask questions on the forum. This place is reserved for bug reports.\nTo change the subject, you have to modify the source code by yourself. Take a look here: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/app/Model/InviteModel.php#L55. I don't really understand what you are asking for. You should provide examples.. There is no notion of \"merging users\". The behavior that you described depends on how you configured the application on your own server and how you use it.\nPlease, use the forum for that kind of questions.. You don't need the permission of anyone to create a plugin. Just do it :). You should post custom css examples on the forum. This issue tracker is reserved for bug reports.. You don't really provide any information to reproduce the issue.\nSee: https://docs.kanboard.org/en/latest/developer_guide/faq.html#how-to-make-a-bug-report. I am in the process of moving the documentation to https://docs.kanboard.org/ so I reflected the change here: https://docs.kanboard.org/en/latest/api/task_procedures.html#movetaskposition\nThanks. I believe this is related to the other issue that you opened before: #3776\nKanboard doesn't alter the file itself. When you upload an attachment, the file is just moved to the data folder with a unique name.. The instructions to add your plugin are here: https://github.com/kanboard/website#how-to-add-a-new-plugin-to-the-list. This behavior could happen if multiple process are altering the database schema in the same time.\nMore details here:\n- https://docs.kanboard.org/en/latest/admin_guide/upgrade.html#running-sql-migrations-manually\n- https://docs.kanboard.org/en/latest/admin_guide/faq.html#solving-database-migration-issues. The code has been updated but someone have to update the German translation now.. The German translation is now up to date. Thanks.. You just need to configure the cronjob. See https://docs.kanboard.org/en/latest/admin_guide/cronjob.html. This is an invalid bug report, see https://docs.kanboard.org/en/latest/developer_guide/faq.html#how-to-make-a-bug-report. Please, do no duplicate issues everywhere. You already created the same here https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-calendar/issues/15. This feature won't be changed because this is the standard behavior since this software exists. Altering the permissions of this role will introduce a breaking change for all Kanboard users.\nSince everyone manage projects differently, it's impossible to satisfy everyone. So, use custom roles.. PR #3851 has been merged.. Your PR has been merged.. I merged an squashed your changes: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/commit/b03357aef341ad55fe28b487131ff4acc851f554. https://docs.kanboard.org/en/1.2.2/admin_guide/mysql.html. This issue has been discussed here in the past: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/issues/3297#issuecomment-338335879\nThere are a lot of room for improvements:\n\nRethink how the board is rendered\nRethink how the task position are updated in the database\nAll operations that generate long I/O are executed synchronously: sending an email, a notifications (there is an optional background worker but it's a hackish solution because PHP...)\n\nAll these things are inefficient and slow. In addition to that, technologies used are almost considered legacy nowadays (PHP/jQuery).. Please continue the discussions on the forum as there are so many ways to improve the performances of the application.. This change has been made in the development branch.. Post your issue here: https://github.com/funktechno/kanboard-plugin-wiki/issues. Duplicate of #3570. Actually, it was like that before but it was taking too much space.. PR #3908 has been merged.. You must have at least PHP 5.6 (for the web server and cli).\nhttps://docs.kanboard.org/en/1.2.3/admin_guide/requirements.html#php-versions. You should post this issue here https://github.com/stinnux/kanboard-bigboard/issues. These strings are not the same, they have a different purpose. So this is not a bug.. It should be fixed now in master.. The error seen in your logs is relevant: SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 5 database is locked. Your Raspberry Pi has probably very poor disk I/O. You should try Nginx with PHP-FPM, and if possible use Postgresql instead of Sqlite.. Please, use the template to report bugs.. It's not possible in the current version and not planned (the data model is not adequate).\nPlease use the forum to ask questions.. Please, use this issue tracker for the calendar plugin: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-calendar/issues. Duplicate of #3366. Subtasks are already working as checklist, the only difference is you have 3 different states: todo, in progress and done. When you click on one subtask, it cycle to the next state.\nI don't see how the end-users are going to guess they have to press on shift + click. This won't be possible on tablets or smartphones.. You can use the plugin of @creecros for that.. PR merged thanks. This bug tracker has nothing to do with Framaboard. The feature that you are looking for has been added in Kanboard 1.2.1: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/releases/tag/v1.2.1\nYou should ask Framasoft to upgrade the application. Their bug tracker seems to be there: https://framagit.org/framasoft/Framaboard. PR  #3895 has been merged.. Metadata are only exposed to plugins: https://docs.kanboard.org/en/1.2.3/plugins/metadata.html. You should check your PHP installation, you are missing the ldap extension: [2018-05-15 15:22:36] [error] LDAP: The PHP LDAP extension is required. And.. what is the problem exactly?. I run gulp css, take a look to this page for the installation: https://docs.kanboard.org/en/latest/developer_guide/assets.html. The compilation works but the CSS doesn't seems to be taken into consideration when you open the print window in Chrome. Perhaps the Sass syntax for print media query is incorrect.. These indexes where not named explicitly/properly the first time. MySQL generated a name automatically. I have different index names on my side.\nThe migration 94 should have generated an error. MySQL didn't complains about removing inexistent indexes.\nThe SQL migrations system is not really bullet-proof.. Not at the moment but feel free to send a pull-request :). In my opinion, a border of 5px is too big. You can use the custom CSS feature for that kind of things. . This is the wrong bug tracker, the plugin bigboard is there: https://github.com/stinnux/kanboard-bigboard/issues. The cronjob should already work, see: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/docker/var/spool/crontabs/nginx. As mentioned above, this is not a bug. This is the way the Markdown syntax is defined.. I'm not able to reproduce your issue. Do you have any installed plugins? does all files copied correctly?. Ok so I'm closing this ticket. I let you find the faulty plugin and raise the issue to the plugin author.. If you want to remove a swimlane, you have to remove all tasks that belongs to this swimlane regardless of their status.. Unfortunately, this behaviour is not consistent across platforms and browsers. For example, the dark mode on macOS renders the fields identically as the light mode.\nUsing the CSS select { background: #FFF; } will be rendered differently in Firefox and webkit based browsers.\nI don't know how to fix this. You are probably better to use a custom stylesheet.. This how it's rendered by default on Mac OS with Dark mode enabled:\nFirefox:\n\nChrome:\n\nSafari:\n\nAdding select { background: #FFF; } to the select element, will render this:\nFirefox:\n\nChrome:\n\nSafari:\n\nEach browser seems to render differently the background for the select element. And this only on Mac OS, it didn't test on Windows or Linux.\nI'm not a CSS guru, so if you have a solution, send a pull-request.. \"Allow everybody to access to this project\" doesn't exists anymore, this issue is not applicable with latest version.. Tags and categories now supports color without having to define a custom style. Give it a try.. Duplicate of #3932 . Duplicate of #3505. The size of this field have been already increased in version 1.2.3. Take a look to the ChangeLog.. @ErrorFlexXx Looks like you need to configure LDAP groups, otherwise the role is null: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/app/Core/Ldap/User.php#L119-L121. I would prefer having this in the documentation instead of the readme. Same as other installation options: https://docs.kanboard.org/en/1.2.5/admin_guide/index.html. You could do something similar as the Heroku documentation page, there is an installation badge as well.\nYou still need to explain what is Yunohost and what are the limitations if any. What benefits people have to install Kanboard with Yunohost. Where the users can get help concerning the Yunohost package. Most people have no clue what Yunohost is, so writing few lines doesn't hurt.. If you would like to update the documentation, you can follow these instructions https://docs.kanboard.org/en/latest/developer_guide/faq.html#how-to-update-this-documentation Basically, just send a PR to https://github.com/kanboard/documentation. Closing stale pull-request. Comments not addressed.. It should be fixed now. Thank you. I'm not able to reproduce your issue. Do you have any errors in the browser console?. This working fine for me. Please, use the forum if you still have issues: https://kanboard.discourse.group/\nHere is an example:\n```php\n<?php\nrequire DIR.'/vendor/autoload.php';\n$client = new JsonRPC\\Client('http://127.0.0.1/jsonrpc.php');\n$client->authentication('jsonrpc', '9c086f276da572ef344362d904a234bfce6987c907b3bdf962b59d29781f');\n$result = $client->createTask(['title' => 'This is a test', 'project_id' => 1]);\nvar_dump($result);\n``. What is that???. Patchingconfig.default.php` seems to be a better fix than the initial proposition.. You can found a copy of the JSON-RPC library here: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/tree/master/libs/jsonrpc This one is not available via composer anymore. There are plenty of other libs that can do the same things.\nPlease, use the forum for questions next time.. Your plugin still there: https://github.com/andrewshadura/kanboard-plugin-matrix\nIf you are talking about the issue #3448, yes I removed the fork because I'm not the maintainer. Since your are the author of the plugin, this is better to keep the original repo where is it and have a reference on the website like other plugins: https://github.com/kanboard/website#how-to-add-a-new-plugin-to-the-list. Your issue is probably related to one of the plugins. Remove all them, and install only one at the time.\nBy default, Kanboard doesn't allow the execution of inline Javascript.\nIf you have any installation issue, please use the forum instead: https://kanboard.discourse.group/. If you don't mind, I would prefer having the documentation updated for Ubuntu 18.04 instead of a shell-script here.. Please, use the forum to suggest enhancements https://kanboard.discourse.group/. https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/releases/tag/v1.2.6. Doc updated: https://docs.kanboard.org/en/latest/plugins/hooks.html#template-hooks. Only the sender configured in your project will be accepted. For details, see https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-mailgun#kanboard-configuration\nIf you still have issue, please use the forum: https://kanboard.discourse.group/. @michaelvickersuk Thanks! You're on fire :). FYI, this is generated by this Makefile: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/Makefile#L67-L71 (You may want to add the new line there too).. The website is hosted on GitHub pages. GitHub allows only TLS 1.2 for security reasons (see https://blog.github.com/2018-02-23-weak-cryptographic-standards-removed/).\nIf running curl https://kanboard.org/plugins.json on your server doesn't work. That means you are probably using outdated packages/operating systems.. You can create a new one specifically for GitLab. Or, you can override the existing one. Create a class that inherit from this one and override the method  doAction(), then register your action. . Because until now, nobody had the need to remove application settings. If you need that for a plugin you can send a PR.. Just tried with Chrome and this is working fine for me. Do you have any plugin installed or browser extensions that may cause problem? any errors in the browser console?. See https://docs.kanboard.org/en/latest/user_guide/markdown_syntax.html#line-breaks. The build is not passing because there is a typo, a placeholder is missing:\nIncorrect number of %d in nb_NO translation of: Do you really want to remove this link with task #%d?\nFailed asserting that 0 matches expected 1.. I cannot merge if the tests don't pass.. Closing stale pull-request after 1 month of inactivity.. Closing stale pull-request.. Closing this PR. Sorry, I don't want to change the default behaviour. You can continue the discussion on the forum: https://kanboard.discourse.group/.. This is good enough. Thank you.. No.\nPlease, use the forum: https://kanboard.discourse.group/. This PR has been merged https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/commit/0deaeb58e60097b7f0882a05481253ff99a5a65a. Please, update your Kanboard instance to version 1.2.8. Your issue doesn't seems to be related to Kanboard itself but the poor disk I/O of your device. I would recommend to use Postgresql instead of SQLite.\nIn the future, if you have any installation issues, please use the forum: https://kanboard.discourse.group/. Kanboard v1.2.8 has been released with the fix mentioned above.. The doc has been updated. Thanks. I tested quickly your PR on a Galera cluster and that seems to work. I didn't test the SQL dump yet.\nMerged in this commit https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/commit/314ca5b82e8b1f7677dd039ec21967d7fb2a5231. Trying this locally, I do not have this problem with MariaDB 10.3 or MySQL 8.\nHere an example of docker-compose.yml:\nversion: '2'\nservices:\n  kanboard:\n    image: kanboard/kanboard:v1.2.8\n    ports:\n     - \"80:80\"\n     - \"443:443\"\n    volumes:\n     - kanboard_data:/var/www/app/data\n     - kanboard_plugins:/var/www/app/plugins\n     - kanboard_ssl:/etc/nginx/ssl\n    environment:\n      DATABASE_URL: mysql://kb:kb-secret@db/kanboard\n  db:\n    image: mariadb:latest\n    command: --default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password\n    environment:\n      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: secret\n      MYSQL_DATABASE: kanboard\n      MYSQL_USER: kb\n      MYSQL_PASSWORD: kb-secret\nvolumes:\n  kanboard_data:\n    driver: local\n  kanboard_plugins:\n    driver: local\n  kanboard_ssl:\n    driver: local\n\nYou can also try to load the schema manually, see https://docs.kanboard.org/en/1.2.8/admin_guide/mysql.html#importing-sql-dump-alternative-method\nOr, run the migrations manually: https://docs.kanboard.org/en/1.2.8/admin_guide/upgrade.html#running-sql-migrations-manually\n\nIf you still have installation issues, please use the forum: https://kanboard.discourse.group/. Looks like there is a typo that prevent the build to pass: Incorrect number of %d in ja_JP translation of: %s moved the task #%d to the column \"%s\"\nhttps://travis-ci.org/kanboard/kanboard/jobs/492231395. Feel free to update the docs: https://github.com/kanboard/documentation. I'm not able to reproduce your issue. You should provide more details (screenshots, logs, and installed plugins).. Can you take a look to the network tab? What are the response status code and the response body when you try to upload the files?. php\nfile_put_contents('/tmp/webhook.json', file_get_contents('php://input'));\nPlease, use the forum instead.\n. The answers to your questions are available on this page: https://docs.kanboard.org/en/1.2.8/admin_guide/plugins.html\nIf you have further questions, please use the forum: https://kanboard.discourse.group/.. There is more details about the error SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 2006 MySQL server has gone away in the MySQL documention: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/gone-away.html. The build doesn't pass because there is a typo: Incorrect number of %s in sk_SK translation of: Comment removed on task #%d\nFailed asserting that 1 matches expected 0.\nhttps://travis-ci.org/kanboard/kanboard/jobs/503951208. The build doesn't pass because there is a typo: Incorrect number of %d in it_IT translation of: %d invitation was sent.\nFailed asserting that 0 matches expected 1.. This is most likely issues in these plugins.\nFor example, in the Signal plugin the variable $user is used but not declared anywhere, see https://github.com/stratmaster/kanboard-plugin-signal/blob/master/Notification/Signal.php#L79-L86\nProbably a similar issue for Nebula plugin. $user is not passed to the template: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/app/Template/header.php#L8-L12 and https://github.com/kenlog/Nebula/blob/master/Template/layout/header/creation_dropdown.php#L39\nYou should report these issues to the plugin authors.. The bug tracker for the calendar is there: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-calendar/issues. What plugins are installed?. error_reporting should not be hardcoded\n. This text cannot be translated.\n. placeholders are not translated\n. You should not do that. That will work only in debug mode. Check if the link exists at the validation.\n. I got a fatal error here, should be \"TaskModel::STATUS_OPEN\"\n. Do not include js files here, everything should be in the app.js, see http://kanboard.net/documentation/assets\n. Do not hardcode urls in javascript, use data attributes and generate the url with the helper in php\n. console.log() calls should be removed\n. You don't need to do that, the assignee id is already present in the task data (field owner_id)\n. Remove trailing spaces\n. TINYINT(1) for a flag is enough\n. typo in 'Share with all Projectmembers'\n. Do not display the table header if there is no custom filters, the page layout is weird otherwise\n. For postgres, use the type BOOLEAN\n. You can probably do that with a single sql query instead of 2\n. Remove the trailing spaces\n. Can you remove the line completely?\n. You can default to array() instead of null so php knows the type at variable creation.\n. Instead of calling multiple times the method loadColors() you can add constructor that override the parent one and then load the colours from the database.\nExample:\nphp\npublic function __construct(Container $container)\n{\n    parent::__construct($container);\n    $this->loadFromDatabase();\n}\n. You can probably simplify this loop by using the function array_filter().\n. What is the purpose of !important? (yes I'm a dick in css)\n. The primary key is missing for Postgres.\n. Use the type BOOLEAN instead.\n. I'm not sure if the comment if the schema itself are really necessary. The column names are easily understandable.\n. Just to follow the existing convention, can you rename is_usable to is_active?\n. This syntax is not compatible with recent version of PHP, you should use something like:\nphp\n<?php foreach ($colors as $color_id => $color): ?>\n...\n<?php endforeach ?>\n. Don't forget to remove debug statements.\n. The title is missing here otherwise you will get a php notice.\n. This method and the one below are duplicated from the class ProjectActivity, there is probably a better way of doing that.\n. To avoid a regression, the config file have to be loaded from the root directory of Kanboard, not from app/config.php (.. is missing).\n(fixed in commits after yours)\n. You cannot call this method statically, instead use $this->projectUserRole->getUserRole(...\n. This line should not appear. You probably commit a conflict after your rebase.\n. The class name should have the suffix \"Api\" like the other ones to be consistent.\n. Single quotes are missing, that will generate a php notice. \n. The method ProjectModel::update() do not have the argument owner_id. See https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/app/Model/ProjectModel.php#L429\n. Be consistent with the existing code base, add spaces between the equals signs.\n. You should remove these useless comments.\n. For Postgres, it's probably better to use the type BOOLEAN instead (same as other flags). If you can make this change, I'm good to merge.\n. If you add a new argument, you should update the phpdoc of the method and specify the type if not scalar (array).\n. According to the signature of the method GoogleAuthenticator::getQrCodeUrl() the fourth argument is an integer not a boolean, the default is null.\n. Why do print stuff in the middle of the method?\n. The name of this parameter should be something else because you use that generate an issuer for the TOTP.\nYou should also check for the existence of the key SERVER_NAME, it's not always available, that will generate a PHP notice in certain conditions.\n. You should not have multiple HTML elements with the same ID.\n. Do not send \"work in progress\" code or mark the PR as WIP.\n. You can send these changes in a separate PR to be merged quickly, do not forget to update the documentation if you add new hooks.\n. You should remove the debug statements\n. What is it?\n. This file should not be here.\n. This change should not be part of your PR.\n. This line and the condition below is not necessary anymore.\n. Do not remove English documentation files!\n. Your PR should be in sync with the current master branch. This line should not be removed.\n. Why are you removing this condition?\n. This code is necessary otherwise you introduce a breaking change.\n. The name of this hook should be more specific because this is included between specific columns.\n. You can remove the 2nd argument if you pass nothing.\n. Why this file is there?\n. Why did you update the url? All images are in this repository.\n. The image links have to be relative, not absolute. Thank you.\nLos enlaces de imagen tienen que ser relativos, no absolutos. Gracias.. This one still wrong.\nThank you. There is no comment field in this table, where does it come from?. Same here. The Kanboard's code should not include code related to your plugin. I agree to improve this code to make your plugin compatible, but not to hardcode the name of your plugin here.. Can you remove this part for now? I prefer to put back this feature only if we introduce an alert box for modal box that contains a form.\nThanks. There is a mistake here, the placeholder %s is missing.. Thank you for reporting this bug but you forgot a return statement here, this function must always return an array. I fixed that in master, and now a test case ensure that no regression on this code will happen in the future.. The strings \"Created At:\" and \"Updated At:\" should be translatable.. You should use a BIGINT for Postgres as well, in this way we are ready for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem. Be careful, there is a typo here that prevent the migration to work :). This code doesn't seems to be properly indented.. This change doesn't seems to be related to this pull-request?. The status code should be set as second argument of the method html(), see https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/app/Core/Http/Response.php#L267. There is a typo here d% instead of %d (that prevent automated tests to pass).. Instead of using the time() function, can you use directly the helper $this->dt->datetime($task['date_due'])?. Kanboard should not be coupled and depends of any plugin.\nAnother way to do it is to offer the possibility to configure those filters via the user interface instead of using PHP constants. In this way, people do not have to manually change a config file on the server.\nIn the templates, you could use the helper $app->config('my_config_param', 'some default value'). Add new form fields in this template: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/app/Template/config/project.php. It should be color('default') according to the change you made in _variables.sass?. This curly brace is necessary.. Avoid inline styles, just use the tag <strong>.. 1. You should not use global variables. There is a class Kanboard\\Core\\Http\\Request for that.\n2. You should add tests\n3. You should update the documentation if you add new features (folder doc). I think Ubuntu Xenial have PHP 7 in the standard packages. The PPA should not be necessary, what about using php7?. typo here: venor. Some plugins like the Calendar, Gantt or Chat contains assets. If do curl http://example.org/plugins/Calendar/Assets/calendar.js I got a 403.. Your are still blocking the plugins folder?. It seems to work if Kanboard is installed at the document root, but people could install Kanboard into a subfolder like this: https://localhost/kanboard/. In this scenario I get a 403.. Why did you remove these actions?. This change is related to the other pull-request, why it appears here?. Are you planning to update your pull-request?. The class SessionStorage doesn't exists since Kanboard 1.2.\nYou have a starting point here to add this feature: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/app/Controller/AuthController.php#L73-L83\n. Using category- instead of tag- might be more appropriate because Kanboard have tags and categories?. Please, do not use inline if.. Please, add a space around the operator =.. The first and last parentheses are not necessary. Can you change is_null ( to is_null(?. Please, do not duplicate code.\nMove this method from AuthController to the BaseController and make it protected.. The placeholder %s is missing here.. You could update this PR until the tests are green or make a new one. It's up to you. Thanks. 188?. There is no need to have commented code.. Why do add this property here? it should be also added in other methods if really needed.. The footer is not really needed since you have added the link to the board and the task just above.\nYou may have overdue notifications for different projects.. The new translation key is Only for tasks created by me and tasks assigned to me, there is a typo here, tasks should be after the and.. This is a minor detail, but can you keep the code indentation consistent with the rest.\nThanks. To support user defined date format and ISO format, you should use the method getTimestamp() from the DateParser class instead.\nIn this way, createdRange:\"2017-12-09..2017-12-15\" and createdRange:\"09/12/2017..15/12/2017\" should work.. It should be \"enter\" not \"entered\". Take a look to this PR https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/pull/3963. You have to keep the default \"No color\", otherwise this is going to brake the existing behaviour for existing categories without colour.. Why do you remove these assertions?. Try this scenario:\n\nCreate a category with no color associated\nClick on \"edit category\", the dropdown shows \"No color'\nApply your pull-request to the code base\nClick on \"edit category\", the dropdown shows the first item in the select which is yellow, the \"no color\" option is gone\n\nThis is a regression for existing users when they will upgrade the application to a new version.. This is not a duplicate. Pay attention to the character case.. From where is coming the function get_last_insert_id()?. Ah ok. I don't even remember what I did :)\nGive me some time to test your pull-request on a Galera cluster.. ",
    "essembeh": "I'll have a look soon.\nThanks you very much for the dev ;)\n.

Maybe I should write this in a different issue, tell me.\nThe way we use Kanboard might be not very orthodox but all the tasks of a particular assignee have always the same color. So we would like to select only an assignee when creating a task (instead of selecting an assignee and a color as we have to do now).

    "nekohayo": "For the initial issue reported by essembeh, I might suggest mimicking GTK's new color picker (a simple palette in a table instead of overwhelming the user with choice): see the screenshot in https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/3.12/GtkColorChooserDialog.html\nThis is (AFAIK) using the Tango palette: http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Theme_Guidelines#Color_Palette\n. @poikilotherm any progress on that patch of yours? Would be great to have a color picker palette widget. Lately the combobx list has grown to way more colors and they're all textual, and not sorted logically, which makes the thing hard to use consistently.\n. Hi Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, I'm not sure I understand how this is supposed to work - there is no option in kanboard git master to set the expiration delay. Like @nicosomb, I want to keep the thing open all day, and yet I still need to re-authenticate (I'm using Google authentication, if that changes anything) multiple times per day. Could this ticket be reopened?\n. Well if \"persistent connections\" is meant to represent the connections that don't need to re-login, that's interesting... because in my case (with a google auth) there is nothing listed under \"Persistent connections\".\n. Actually, now that I think of it, maybe this is not what I actually want as a user... maybe the nicest solution would be to be able to edit/view tasks \"in place\", either as an overlay or as a \"sidebar\", avoiding the need to go back and forth between the \"board view\" and the \"task view\". I'd like to be able to just single-click on a task, it shows its details on the right of my board, and I can edit the details directly and it hit save... without ever leaving the board view and losing my context/focus... but this approach is probably more complex than having separate pages for everything ;)\n. Works as expected, thanks! :)\n. Hi Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, I think I know who gu-gu is, actually\u2026 this commit & merge request is most likely a mistake/misunderstanding, in case you're wondering what this is all about ;-)\n. Thanks, tested, it looks nice :)\n. @cknoll (or anyone else) can't someone in your group provide a patch for this instead? Typically better than throwing money at the problem (sometimes that doesn't change anything, the problem is usually time) or pressuring the developer.\n. Hi Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, I think your proposed approach makes sense. At least it would fit the current workflow problem I'm trying to solve: a university research group, where students have an official/primary professor assigned as their research director, and then that professor can have co-directors and lieutenants (research associates under the professor that help mentor the students). And yeah, while subtasks are great, I really need the multi-users thing to be visible on the board directly, otherwise I know it's not going to work in practice :)\nI think this could work in conjunction with issue #126\n. I would like to humbly request this to be reopened/de-merged from issue #1012. I still see plenty of situations where I would want more than one assignee globally. In practice/from what I see out there in the real world:\n- Very often, tasks (cards) don't actually have/use subtasks. They are not needed or are overkill for 99% of the usecases of people I'm dealing with\n- There are cases where projects are assigned with \"equal responsibility\" to two people. And no, the notion of \"teams\" won't work for that, because in those cases I'm seeing, the people are cross-teams.\n...and it would be very nice if it could have a visual avatar representation as suggested in issue #126.\n. @ptman wrote:\n\nIf more than one person are responsible, then in effect nobody is responsible. I think the current way is good, with one person responsible who is then able to create subtasks and assign them.\n\nThat's your perception based on how things work in your organization(s), but no, that is not sufficient. As I pointed out in my previous comments, there are real world organizational scenarios out there where people have an equal shared responsibility without being part of a \"team\"; that's cross-functional/interdisciplinary assignments. In my case they are a small group (think: less than 10 people) that work in different pairs depending on each task. I can't create a \"team\" or \"group\" for every possible \"pair\" and \"triad\", that's ridiculous, it doesn't help the users gain clarity.\n. @Philippe-Arnaud that's what works for you because you think of kanbard cards in terms of \"tasks\". It doesn't work in every organization when you think in terms of \"projects\". Please read my previous comment(s) on this thread.\n. > From my personal perspective, this changes the very core of the flow in Kanboard, breaking the beautiful underlying concepts of Kanban. [...]\nI disagree, I strongly believe it doesn't.\n\n[...] We think of tasks as tasks because they are created using a button labeled \"Add a new task\" and boards as projects since those are created using \"New Project\". At least I would try to avoid using a tool against its design.\n\nTry telling that to a manufacturing plant manager (y'know, where kanban board originated from). Or a medical clinic. Or a research lab. Or a very small consultancy group.\nThat the labelling of widgets on the kanboard UI does not fit reality is not a valid argument to me. I personally call kanboard's boards \"boards\", not \"projects\", because that's exactly what they are: boards. And the cards (\"tasks\") inside them are exactly what I'm saying: projects. And THEN those projects may or may not have subtasks, but that's up to the users.\nThere is nothing that you lose from having the optional ability to assign more than one person to a card. It's additive, not substractive, not a zero-sum game. Please don't impose your complexity/workflow/terminology onto everybody else. What you're doing is trying to force people to use this asphalted path: http://www.drewhajduk.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/2847766967_70b6bec449_z.jpg\n. Actually, I tried various ways to \"convert\" the tasks, including those conditions:\n- When the task is moved within the same column\n- When the task is moved across columns\n- When the task is modified\n...none of those seem to work to convert from color to category.\n. With 9378327, I tried the method you suggested (I had already deleted all the automated actions in board's prefs), and I tried my previous approach as well, none of them work: reordering a task within its column, or even across columns, does not make its category change (even after a refresh).\n. Actually, it does the reverse of what it says: setting the category auto-sets the color! Either you flipped something around in the code, or the wording is unclear (especially in French, \"Assigner une couleur \u00e0 une cat\u00e9gorie sp\u00e9cifique\" can be interpreted two ways with \"set a task of a given color to a given category\".\nClearer strings could be:\n- \"set a color based on the category\" and its opposite,\n- \"set a category based on the color\"\n...which doesn't solve the fact anyway that I have a bunch of colors that I want to convert to categories, not only the other way around ;)\n. Magnifique!\n. There is also the potential for this to create a more compact design, by replacing the full-length name labels in the board view by icons that contain either the (gr)avatar or, if no image is available, the first letter of the firstname with a unique color, like Google Documents does:\n\nThis would make it future-proof for a case where a task can have multiple people assigned/co-assigned to it, as per issue #85. Of course, the image above is just an example of the \"fake avatars with letters\" concept, the layout of them is intended to be much more compact (in a line) on the board view, like Trello does:\n\n. @mcorteel well, in terms of informativeness those gravatar identicons are useless compared to the letter-based ones; and, on a sidenote, I really cannot expect my users to ever bother setting up a gravatar account (vs me uploading a profile picture for them in the kanboard admin interface), they have zero interest in technology.\nThat said, \"gravatar for real avatars + fallback to letter-based identicons \u00e0 la Google\" would be a reasonable compromise.\n. @mcorteel I still think the following hybrid approach would make more sense, if you folks don't want to implement a standalone \"upload an avatar\" local system and want to keep the code to a minimum:\n- Gravatar enabled AND user has a registered gravatar associated with the email addres => show gravatar\n- Gravatar disabled OR user doesn't have a gravatar associated with the email address => Show the user's initial on a unique colored background\nIn other words: no identicon, those are useless (they were meant as decorations for blog commenting systems where the username is shown alongside the icon; they are not replacements for the username).\n. Hi @fguillot, finally got around to testing out 1.0.27 today, and it's very cool! However, there is a small bug: \"letter-based\" avatars are only displayed where there is no email address associated with the user account at all; in the case where the account has an email address set in it but does not use gravatar, the gravatar logo/default-image gets displayed instead of the letter-based one. It would be best if we could detect that there is no \"real\" gravatar for a given email address and fallback to letter-based depictions in that case.\n. Alright, there are now issues #2185, #2184, #2183 and #2172 about the remaining bugs I could find.\n. While that makes sense for changes done by others, it doesn't make sense to highlight tasks that were changed by myself... and also, once you go into the task details by clicking it, I'd expect the blue glow to be \"cleared\" until further changes occur by someone else.\n. Yes of course, and I appreciate the opportunity to test \"awesome in the making\". That's why I file bugs early and often so you get feedback before it's released onto the masses :)\n. Ah sorry, I was misled/under that impression because I didn't see the \"meta\" tag in the page's source view :)\n. Great, those tasks started showing up for me again! I guess I need to keep watching out for potential bugs as you imply it might not be 100% fixed, but it seems the remainder will be harder to catch now...\n. Hmmm... When I click on a task's title inside the board, I get an error message: \"Sorry, I didn't found this information in my database!\". The side-effect of this is that I can't close tasks at all.\nI haven't bisected or anything, but could your latest fixes have caused this?\nP.s.: there's a typo in there... it should be \"I didn't find\", not \"I didn't found\"...\n. Lol j'ai trouv\u00e9. The bug is that &project_id=123 is missing in the URL when you do that...\n. Thanks for your work on that folks :) I can see a use for this feature.\nOn the other hand, I still have a need for the ability to assign multiple users (not a team) to a task, as per issue #85 (+ issue #126 for the avatar representation). Loosely quoting from my last comment in 85:\n\nThere are cases where projects are assigned with \"equal responsibility\" to two people. In the environment I'm dealing with, the notion of \"teams\" won't work for that, because it's only 4-5 people\u2014they are essentially working in a cross-teams fashion.\n. I'd also be in favor of an option for this; while it makes sense in a highly agile environment, various teams I'm involved with are using kanboard to track long-term projects and the age/age-in-column metrics just don't apply in this scenario, it just creates information overload and issues like #948.\n. Not sure I understood properly, out of curiosity I tried setting the display: none; property on .task-board-days inside assets/css/src/task.css, or in assets/css/src/board.css, and it didn't work (tried a hard refresh with ctrl+F5)\n. Yep, that already helps a bit for this usecase, thanks!\n. Aaah, I didn't think of the hidden \"default swimlane\" at all. Shouldn't this be considered a bug that the task doesn't get into the first visible swimlane instead of going into a hidden swimlane?\n. Seems to work, woohoo!\nA small UX suggestion I can offer, but not a big deal and it's up to you: it might be nice to have a \"reminder\" of what the previous values were besides each field. For example, you could have\n\nCategory\n[ combobox ]\u00a0  (previously: foobar)\nWith the \"previously\" text in gray so it doesn't stand out too much. Or maybe do that as a tooltip on the combobox itself (so it only appears when the mouse goes over it, instead of being shown directly on the page). Otherwise you need to have multiple tabs open to know what were the previous parameters if you want to match them.\n. In addition to this UX nitpick above, found a possible perf bug: #1041\n. Thanks, the loading icon is a nice addition, and somehow the whole thing feels faster (strange!), but there seems to be a backend issue remaining, where sometimes the request gets completely ignored. Updated screencast: http://jeff.ecchi.ca/public/kanboard-2015-07-20-2.webm\nIn that one you can see that sometimes the loading icon/spinner doesn't appear at all, and at those times the \"swimlanes\" field doesn't change/reset properly... race condition?\n. Not totally sure, but this might be caused in part by\n- overflow-x: scroll;  in #board-container\n- padding-bottom: 20px;  in body\n- and some other stuff?\nIt should be noted that in addition to the per-column scrolls that were recently implemented in 1.0.18, there seems to still be a global vertical scroll that sometimes kicks on because of this; I'm not sure if that's intentional or not?\n. Yeah, it should work\u2026 in theory ;) this is Epiphany 3.16 with WebKit 2.8.5. Again, it works with the older kanboard release, just not the new one. No errors in the inspector's console.\n. @aquimi this is not the right place, this bug report about Epiphany has nothing to do with your issue. Open a separate ticket if you need to.\n. Just for the sake of completeness wrt the original issue: I have now tested Epiphany 3.20 with WebkitGTK 2.10.x, and the issue persists. Technically, it's not strictly the same as Blink/Webkit, so if you have time @fguillot it would be worth installing that browser to give it a quick shot and confirm the presence of the bug.\n. I think I may have found the \"issue\"... in Firefox the whole card is a draggable element, but in Epiphany the cards can only be dragged with the little pictogram/icon in their top-left corner, the one with four arrows that look like a visual metaphor for \"fullscreen\". This icon does not appear in Firefox.\nMy question is thus:\n- Why the difference in behavior across browsers?\n- Why would the \"only the icon is draggable\" behavior be desirable vs the traditional approach where the whole card is a drag source?\n. Ok then this sounds like user agent misdetection... Epiphany/WebKit might claim to be, for example:\nMozilla/5.0 (Fedora; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/602.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/8.0 Safari/602.1 Epiphany/3.18.0\nWhich is bullshit as we know, but apparently there's \"no choice\":\n- https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=721191\n  - https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=124229\n- https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=753610\n  - https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=142074\nProbably a dozen other User Agent issues exist... though I'm sure your input could be helpful for those bug reports.\n. > Running this command $.support.touch in Epiphany browser console returns true\nIn my case it returns \"undefined\". At the bottom of the webkit inspector in Epiphany there seemed to be a console so I tried entering that command, but noticed that while $ and support were autocompleted, touch was not. So there is no \"touch\" among the choices in .support...\nMy Thinkpad X201t is indeed touch and stylus-enabled, however the issue also occurs on my desktop computer (which has no notion of touch whatsoever).\n. I thought it would be easier to just install epiphany (or \"epiphany-browser\") under your distro of choice (especially as VM's aren't the fastest thing ever and you would still have to install the epiphany package after installing the OS), unless you're stuck on a LTS or something, but that's up to you ;)\n. You say it indicates that it supports touch events... how is that so, given that on my end $.support.touch always returned \"undefined\"?\n. Here is the issue in WebKitGtk, feel free to join the discussion: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=139681\n. I can confirm that if I rename the .htaccess to something else, it works without the trailing slash (but then you don't get pretty URLs).\n. So, I isolated the problem. The first ifmodule block/section is not a problem, but the second one (inside the filesmatch section) is the cause. Specifically, if any of those two (one, or another) is present, the 403 will occur:\n<IfVersion >= 2.3>\n            Require all denied\n        </IfVersion>\nor:\n<IfVersion < 2.3>\n            Order allow,deny\n            Deny from all\n        </IfVersion>\nThe last remaining IfModule doesn't trigger the issue.\n. This is Apache 2.2.29 with PHP 5.4.45 running on CentOS 6.7 (shared hosting by Hostgator).\n. Your approach is per-domain (assuming one is using Google Apps Enterprise). What about the whitelist approach I was describing, where you type in the email address of the google account you specifically want to whitelist for automatic creation? It seems to me the other \"per domain, if available\" approach is problematic in terms of security.\n. Interesting, with 1.0.27 it seems to work fine now. Might be just luck, unless you actually changed code related to this in recent times? Let's hope it's gone forever I guess ;)\n. Still, just for fun, here's what a wallpaper could look like when using the dark theme variant (though the CSS would need some more tweaks, such as dropshadows on the text for legibility, stronger borders, and possibly semi-transparent backgrounds for table cells):\n\n. For storage, don't provide options or pre-processed resizing, just leave them at the large native sizes and let the browser/CSS handle the scaling dynamically; that way it's going to be of much higher quality and hiDPI-compatible (ex: retina screens).\n. Oh, I probably need to clarify a bit my previous comment regarding one particular corner case (where some non-tech-savvy users might upload insane 8 megapixel images as avatars and expect the system to handle them): by native size I actually mean \"a single generous size, but not humongous\". So something like 512x512 would be a decent resizing+storage size compromise if the source image is significantly bigger than that. But for uploaded JPEG images below ~1024x1024 pixels, basically leave them untouched because it's not worth the quality loss vs storage size tradeoff.\nThe essence of my initial comment remains valid: keep only one \"good quality/resolution\" version in store and let the browsers handle the resizing on the fly, losslessly.. Oh, I think I just realized what this is about... the \"Save\" button actually means \"Upload\", not \"save the changes\". So it should be named accordingly, or that button should disappear once the image has been successfully uploaded already (unless the user picked a new local file from the file browser).\n. Ah, I found the issue: I had to go into the plugins/GoogleAuth directory and do a git remote update && git checkout v1.0.3\nSo I guess the essence of this bug report could now be: in situations where a plugin raises a fatal error like that, Kanboard should clearly indicate that it's plugin $foobar causing the problem.. ",
    "poikilotherm": "I'm doing some work on avatars in my personal feature branch. I already had some code in there to provide a nicer way to choose a color, maybe I'll open another feature branch for that and reapply my patch.\n. +1\nCould be implemented as an action on event.\nMaybe PHPMailer or Swiftmailer are an option to have a nice framework around the mailing stuff?

I'll see what I can do on this issue.\n. The term you are looking for is \"squashing\". When you have finished your development, make a new branch from master and do a git merge --squash <your-dev-branch-name-here>. Of course you would have to create a new PR for this.\nI think @fguillot does squashing before merging, too. Maybe don't worry then... ;)\nAnyway: this looks really promising! Thanks for your work!\n. Maybe related to #317, if that one could be improved with swim lanes, too?\n. Wouldn't it be nicer to have something like /kanboard/1/board/show to show the board? Or even nicer /kanboard/test/board when project no. 1 is called \"Test\" and default to action show? Remembering Project IDs is hard work... ;) \n(Maybe even shorter: /kanboard/test as a default to show the board?)\nTechnical question: what would you prefer? A sane default .htaccess and some doc on doing this in nginx or just hints how to do this stuff in Apache/nginx/...? Maybe some sort of setting like in WordPress/... that will generate strings or files for you? Most likely we would need a \"Link Generator\" or \"Rewriter\" for this anyway (a setting comes in handy...), as the UI links coded in PHP would have to be cleaned up, too.\n. This is definitly related to issue #290  and PR #333. I am working on some things, too (see feature branch), but this is on hold as long #333 is open. My intention was to allow avatars from LDAP, upload, etc. too, not just gravatar.\n. Whoops, this seems to be a duplicate of #124. Sorry for that!\n. @fguillot: Thanks for merging #312, this is already a huge step forward! I think I'll close this for now.\n. Hi,\ndo you have the PHP PDO sqlite support acitivated? 'could not find driver' is a strong hint on this.\nYou can check on this by taking a look into the PDO section of the output of <?php phpinfo(); ?> via your web browser.\nBeware that sqlite support and pdo_sqlite are to different pair of shoes.\n. Great! I was about to open an FR for that just now. I am eeger to see some demo, is this already in master or just in a private branch?\n. I think there are some plugins for Redmine that add the option on using webhooks when you do things in Redmine. Maybe you can extend the GitHub Webhooks feature recently introduced in Kanboard and reuse it for your purpose?\n. Do you just want to open a task and add comments? This is \"easy\".\nQuite hard to achieve in a free form based email would be stuff like close a task, assign it, ...\n. +1\nI think tags would be great, too. It would be a great relief to show tags on the board like on the normal kanban boards to see whether this task is a blocker, ... \n. Just working on this. Check out https://github.com/poikilotherm/kanboard/tree/feature_gravatar\n. I put my efforts on hold for the moment, depending on whether #333 will be merged or not.\n. Maybe it would be better to use swim lanes in your case...? See #317.\n. I have exactly the same issue you are running into: to many things to do and no good sorting / viewing option.\nI am thinking about developing a \"Swimlane View\" feature after my current dev activities. Would that help you, too? This would introduce the option to have all the classical Kanban board goodies like epics, components/products, ...\n@fguillot is there something in your dev pipeline for that? I don't want to reinvent the wheel on things that are already or in short term undergoing active development... ;)\n. Personally, I would like to see swimlanes implemented with some features on them:\n- Accordion enabled, so we can hide things if we want to\n- configure per board on what type of data item you like to have swimlanes (assignees, categories (allow to choose a subset!), task complexity, colors, ....?)\n- move tasks between swim lanes with drag & drop and change things according to the swimlane type\nFor the future maybe stuff like:\n- allow per swimlane WiP limits (not only board-wide ones!)\n- maybe allow mixed swim lane types? (does not make sense for every combination, but for some it does... and how shall we know... maybe for somebody it fits...)\n- public link per swimlane? (thus hiding parts of the board for the public)\n- allow per swimlane column definitions (which may alter from the board default)?\n- free form definition of swimlanes independent from data in a ticket?\n. Most certainly my feature wishes will solve #239, too. For swim lanes on data items you surely will sort things before displaying them. Maybe it would be a good idea to even allow ordering within a swim lane?\nNote to myself: try to solve this on the client side via jQuery...? Or do some AJAX...\n. My first intention actually was to put this inside Controller\\App, but I did not want to mess around with that quite important class... ;)\nAbout the response in XML: I'm not sure whether it is correct if an AJAX Request (XMLHttpRequest) is not returning a proper XML answer (actually, AFAIR the respondes only differ in the MIME types), but HTML. I'll do some searching about that and respond back.\nI edited the Core stuff (Request and Security classes) because of the CSRF token handling.\nAs the AJAX is doing a POST request, you need proper CSRF tokens set. I just use the one in the hidden input within the form, but this would get invalidated after the first request. If you would do another preview or try to save things, you are trapped...\nBut maybe you have a better idea for that? It's your code, there is a good chance I missed something.\nAbout generic: course! :D JS is already generic (should even already support multiple textareas within the form, but did not test that...), need to add CSS and proper divs in the Templates for the task stuff.\n. Done some more dev on this, following your hints. Please go on and give it a try... :) If you like it, I'll create a PR. Thanks!\n. I do not send any form data, but extract the val() of the textarea before sending it via AJAX. I'll go ahead and test your suggestions. You are quite right that we don't do anything nasty with App::preview().\nThanks for the info about the merging strategy. :)\n. ~~Nearly there... I think now there is only some minor CSS fixing for the responsiv design needed. If you try things with a small resolution, it gets a bit messy.~~\nDone.\nI will create a squashed commit for the PR later... The merging and rebasing of things has messed up the branch history quite a bit.\n@fguillot: could you please take another look on this if you like my changes so far?\nNow missing: locale updates... Writing a script for that in another branch. ;) (see my PR #393)\nBy the way: would you like me to write some unit tests for preview()? Dunno if you would like to have the AclTest expanded.\n. Hi,\nwhat kind of integration would you like to have? Just Links? Or more advanced stuff? Existing, parallel Wiki or new Wiki inside Kanboard?\n. At the time Frederic started Kanboard, he wanted to have simple Kanboard, nothing more. A wiki is often integrated into many project management softwares, but really don't think there should be one directly sitting in the code of kanboard.\nHowever, links are possible today, too. You can embedded any link you want inside a description or comment.\nWould like to have some sort of \"shortcut\" f\u00fcr wiki links as they are possible for tasks? (maybe like Interwiki links on MediaWiki?) Or just a configurable link in the top navigation, pointing to a wiki?\n. I'm not sure whether it is a good idea to use such a feature complete allround thingie, as it is also doing the preview stuff. As the Markdown formatted post will get parsed via Parsedown, I implemented the AJAX preview in the first place... The flavours of Markdown may give you a hard time otherwise.\nIt's actually not very challening to add a <div> to the template, display some icons and onClick do some JS/jQuery to insert things into the textarea...\n. @lathan: see my #357 \n. You often use colored cards for high/med/low prio tasks in addition or instead to the ordering... I have seen people using colored magnets on the card on a (offline) whiteboard, too.\n.

    "poVoq": "While ldap is also supported by it, a native OwnCloud (www.owncloud.org) login for Kanboard would be nice as it could then be directly included in the webinterface of owncloud via the \"webapp\" plugin even if ldap isn't used.\n. Seems like embedding Kanboard into Owncloud is pretty popular, but not everyone wants to set up an external authentification service.\nI think this gives some idea how kanboard could authentificate against Owncloud:\nhttps://doc.owncloud.org/server/8.1/developer_manual/core/externalapi.html\n(as it follows the OCS standard, it might work with other websites also in the future).\n. an option to have the cards sorted in the column according to priority could also be added, maybe as a filter?\n. Ok thanks, maybe it should be renamed complexity or something like that for those not familiar with the scrum method?\n. Great, thanks!\n. Tasks is a more or less separate feature from from the calendar in PIM software suites like Thunderbird (with Lightning) or Outlook. It just happens to be implemented with CalDAV also. I also think that this way it would be easy to have a simple kanboard based task-list displayed in Android etc.\nBut the main reason is to have all your important stuff in a single (offline) application, and being able to sync it with your kanboard would be cool.\nSometimes you might also have collaborators who are not really interested in using the kanboard itself and just want to have a todo-list and check them off in their PIM suite. While the \"managers\" uses the Kanboard to assign tasks etc.\n. I think iCal is read only, no? Closing tasks or adding new ones etc. through CalDAV with an external application would be quite neat.\n(Never the less, great work on the demos and the calender view, which is useful regardless).\n. Seem to work pretty well on mobile these days, and I like the simplistic look.\nIMHO, the lack of a framework should make it easier to include in other projects like owncloud, which is a big plus.\n. Yes with the new authentication system this should be possible no? Would be awesome if someone could write such a plugin and release a combined version on the owncloud app store.\n. ",
    "chlarsen": "Excellent little piece of software, small footprint, great stuff - provides freedom from Trello :-). \nHowever, I have a few issues with the LDAP login, which is really great to have. I am running OpenLDAP 2.4 on my FreeBSD server and use the email address defined in the OpenLDAP directory as user-friendly user\"name\". Currently, this does not go well with the simple definition of username in the kanboard config file. Ideally, the config file could let me define, which LDAP (unique) attribute is going to be used as username, giving a range of the cn, uid and mail attributes, for instance.\nThis would also involve a softening of the username restriction demanding alphanumeric characters, only, once I am logged in and want to change user details.\nFinally, I have my users sorted into LDAP groups that correspond to the applications users are allowed to login to. Hence, a filter field would be great to have - very much as seen in all those LDAP-enabled management applications (Redmine, dotProject, ...).\nThoughts?

Because as far as I can tell, the Remember Me function is the only one that sets a custom max-age of 60 days on its cookie /app/Auth/RememberMe.php#L37. Everyone else seems to use the default session time of 2 hours /app/Core/Session.php#L18.

While I agree that some form of import function would be nice, are Excel macros an option for you?\nBecause if so, I think this could be handled (somewhat) easily with the current JSON API. It probably wouldn't even require a lot of coding, since there already are working macro libraries for JSON parsing and API calling. Plus you could define your own Excel field <> kanboard field bindings, add custom filters, use Excel formulas, etc.\nOn the downside of course, it would mean more time spent in Excel and less in kanboard ;)\n. It's not just when moving between columns, it's also when moving a task in the same column.\nThe reason is in Model/Task/update(array $values)\nIt expects to get called with a full set of form values, however on the task.move.column and task.move.position events, all it gets is an array of\nphp\n(\n    [id] => ...\n    [column_id] => ...\n    [position] => ...\n)\nand because if (! empty($values['date_due']) && ! is_numeric($values['date_due'])) fails, date_due gets reset to 0. Couple of lines below that you can see that it's the same with score points if (empty($values['score'])), they get reset too.\nI'm guessing it's a bug, but I don't know enough about Kanban and its rules to be certain, maybe that's intentional? :smiley: \n. does app/check_setup.php complain about anything?\n. Security issues aside, maybe try pointing DB_FILENAME in app/common.php(or your config.php) to a likely world-accessable place like /tmp?\nIn the meantime you could always set DB_FILENAME to :memory:. It's obviously not very useful, but at least you could test if everything else is working. :worried:\n. Alright, I set up a brand new nginx + php5-fpm, and tested the last couple of versions and none of them worked, but I found a bug that might be the reason for it - or at least is the reason why it didn't work for me:\nThe session_set_cookie_params in app/Core/Session.php -> open sets the session-cookie's path to $base_path ?: '/'. This works, as long as Kanboard is running on its own subdomain (like demo.kanboard.net does). But I've been testing them as http://domain/6/, http://domain/5/, etc. Because of that, the cookie ends up being\nSet-Cookie: <...> path=/4/index.php/4; <...> and path=/4/index.php/4 obviously doesn't work.\nSo try changing Line 36 from $base_path ?: '/', to just '/', then clear all cookies obviously and try logging in again. The new session cookie should have a path of path=/\nNot sure if that actually fixes your problem when you've been running it as kanboard.tdl.com, but worth a shot I guess.\n. There's already an early ACL implementation in there. So, I guess what's left is making an UI for it, updating the database and then adding it to every action.\nNot extremely difficult, just very time consuming :confused: \n. This isn't quite clear from the documentation (see #160), but for some requests you need an extra values object:\njavascript\n{  \n   \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n   \"method\":\"createTask\",\n   \"params\":{  \n      \"values\":{  \n         \"title\":\"new task test\",\n         \"color_id\":\"yellow\",\n         \"project_id\":1,\n         \"column_id\":1\n      }\n   },\n   \"id\":85\n}\nwww.hurl.it is very nice for that I find, here's a prefilled set for demo.kanboard.net that should work, maybe recheck the auth token and definitly add a header with Accept-Encoding = deflate to it, or the server will reply in gzip :wink:\nAs for the documentation, I'm currently working on changing the 'swagger' API stuff from REST to JSON-RPC for some other thing, it should be pretty easy to adapt it to the Kanboard API from there and we'd have a fully functioning API doc with live testing :smiley: \n. If you've followed the Installation Instructions in the Documentation and it still doesn't work, try looking at the hints in issue #182 - particularly the possible fix for the bug that stopped it from working for me.\nOther than that, did it work with an earlier version or is this your first installation?\n. Highlight recently modified tasks on board #201\nTime span can be adjusted in config.php via RECENT_TASK_PERIOD\n. > 'Fatal error: Namespace declaration statement has to be the very first statement in the script in /home/xxxxxxxx/public_html/kanboard/vendor/SimpleValidator/Base.php on line 13'\nThat sounds like it might be an encoding issue, try \nshell\ncat -A vendor/SimpleValidator/Base.php\nand check if the <?php really is the first thing in the file and no $, ^M, etc. in front of it.\nNot sure if that could explain the blank page and empty error log, but reinstalling fixing it would sorta make sense.\n. Yeah that's a bot/trojan, definitely malware.\nI'd say either your passwords were recently compromised or someone found a vulnerability on your server. Anything else installed - maybe something like Wordpress, Joomla, etc.? Unknown FTP users set up?\n. The robots.txt in the root directory should be enough, given that it disallows anything. Although one could consider adding something like <meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex,nofollow\" /> to the templates to be extra sure. They can't index much anyway without a login, the read-only public link is hidden enough that they won't hit it by chance.\nThere are also multiple .htaccess files with Deny from all set, although that doesn't work on nginx which might be something worth looking into given nginx's increasing popularity.\n. I tested it with the current master and I'm getting a\n\nPHP Warning:  Unknown: Input variables exceeded 1000. To increase the limit change max_input_vars in php.ini. in Unknown on line 0\n\nafter dragging/dropping once the tasks hit somewhere between 320 and 350.\n1000 is the default for max_input_vars and kanboard sends 3 parameters per task as well as two single ones, so the default task limit would be about 332.\nAs a workaround you could try setting yours to 10000 or something equally high. If you're using the PHP built-in webserver, try\nshell\nphp -d max_input_vars=10000 -S <ip>:<port>\nSome more long-term solutions would be to either inform/restrict users, once they come close to the limit or only send changed tasks on update instead of all - thereby saving both time and bandwidth, I guess.\n. Depends on how user-friendly and pretty you want it :wink: there are two ways: A quick fix one and a prettier but more complicated one.\nFirst the quick fix, you're right about app\\Model\\Acl.php:\ndiff\n--- a/app/Model/Acl.php\n+++ b/app/Model/Acl.php\n@@ -18,7 +18,7 @@ class Acl extends Base\n      */\n     private $public_actions = array(\n         'user' => array('login', 'check', 'google', 'github'),\n-        'task' => array('add'),\n+        'task' => array('add', 'show'),\n         'board' => array('readonly'),\n     );\nBut you also need to change the board_task template:\n``` diff\n--- a/app/Templates/board_task.php\n+++ b/app/Templates/board_task.php\n@@ -69,7 +69,11 @@\n         <?php endif ?>\n     <?php if (! empty($task['description'])): ?>\n\n\n'><i class=\"fa fa-file-text-o\" t\n<?php if (isset($not_editable)): ?>\n'>\n<?php else: ?>\n'><i class=\"fa fa-file-text-\n<?php endif ?>\n         <?php endif ?>\n     \n\n```\n\nThis won't change the default public view\n\nexcept that the description icon now calls task->show instead of task->editDescription.\n_But_... this doesn't change the task_layout which means that anybody clicking on the description will see the full (although uneditable) task view:\n\nThe links all don't(or shouldn't) work for public visitors, but you might still want to present them a reduced layout. Changing that is certainly possible but would require a bit more template editing, at least layout.php and task_layout.php both of which currently still lack any ACL checks.\nThe prettier alternative to all that could be using the popover effects like the quick edit\n\nand restyling one of them to be read-only, which shouldn't be too hard either, but requires adding new templates and making sure there's no data leak which I hadn't had time to test yet :confused:\n. I don't know know if there's a config settings for this (yet), but if you don't mind hardcoding it, it's just one little change in app/Model/Comment.php apparently:\ndiff\n--- a/app/Model/Comment.php\n+++ b/app/Model/Comment.php\n@@ -49,7 +49,7 @@ class Comment extends Base\n                 User::TABLE.'.name'\n             )\n             ->join(User::TABLE, 'id', 'user_id')\n-            ->orderBy(self::TABLE.'.date', 'ASC')\n+            ->orderBy(self::TABLE.'.date', 'DESC')\n             ->eq(self::TABLE.'.task_id', $task_id)\n             ->findAll();\n     }\nASC = Ascending, DESC = Descending\nThe answering to one particular comment thing might be a bit more difficult, depending on how you want it to look. Simply including a line with a link at the top like This comment is a reply to comment #23 is not too hard, but displaying it for example as a comment-tree would be more work.\n. tests/units/Base.php is missing the Config.php requirement and your code is called in one of the first unit tests, this fixes it for me:\n``` diff\n--- tests/units/Base.php.old    2014-09-11 01:09:52.909581816 +0200\n+++ tests/units/Base.php.fix    2014-09-11 01:08:06.479250834 +0200\n@@ -33,6 +33,7 @@\n require_once DIR.'/../../app/helpers.php';\nrequire_once DIR.'/../../app/Model/Base.php';\n+require_once DIR.'/../../app/Model/Config.php';\n require_once DIR.'/../../app/Model/Task.php';\n require_once DIR.'/../../app/Model/Acl.php';\n require_once DIR.'/../../app/Model/Comment.php';\n```\nAlthough I'm not sure how good it is having to include it, since Model\\Config loads and parses the actual kanboard config.php which would make the unit tests dependent on a non-constant source. Maybe some sort of mockup or a copy of config.default.php would be neccessary?\n. I wonder who caused that bug.. :sweat_smile: (fguillot/picoDb#2)\nWell at least that explains why it originally was commented out, I guess.\n. If I remember correctly, the callback URL is the same because it checks for an extra code parameter which it only gets from GitHub. But I just did a clean install and it still works for me\nWhat's your setup, public server/localhost? Does it say anything about an external account if you go to kanboard > Users or correct number of users at GitHub > Settings > Applications?\nYou're right thou, just noticed the docs are a bit outdated because they still refer to the old page layouts. It should say Users > (your account) > External accounts. They also no longer copy your email and name from external accounts.\n. I haven't tested this yet and I hope I didn't misunderstand your problem, but did you try simply adding it to the ACL rules?\nMight be as easy as changing it to something like 'task' => array('add', 'readonly', 'remoteclose') or (you're right, probably better) add an extra 'gitlab' => array('issue', 'commit', ...<etc.>) and then just copy and adapt Controller\\Task::add.\n~~I don't know how Gitlab does it, but~~ GitHub sends its events as POST requests so you may have to play around with Core\\Request::getBody,  ::getValues, ::getHeader and so to validate and receive data, instead of getStringParam like Task::add still does.\nJust checked your first link, Gitlab uses POST, too. So once one of them works - the other one should be quick to modify as well.\n. Might just be a typo in jsonrpc.php\nTry changing Line 8 from use Model\\projectPermission; to use Model\\ProjectPermission;\n. Well if you want to, you could fork the repository, change jsonrpc.php, submit a pull-request and join the famous ranks of Contributors ;)\nThen again, we have to wait for @fguillot anyway and I'm sure he'll see this soon enough :)\n. You could use automatic actions (bottom of the page) to automatically change a task's color when a certain category is set.\n\n. Does it work if you add the new users to the project's List of authorized users (Project -> User management)?\nIt could be that it displays only Unassigned as an option - instead of every available user on the system - if the project is set to public with no user restrictions.\n. By demo do you mean demo.kanboard.net?\nIt's the same bug as #322 it seems: Filter by user only lists users with access to the project, and shows nobody if everyone has access.\nTry the Round the world project, I added demo1 and demo2 and can filter again:\n\n. It's missing in Model\\TaskFinder::getOverdueTasks() for some reason.\nTry adding \nphp\nTask::TABLE.'.description',\nin the columns() call.\n. That's already in the notification footer, you just need to set it in your config file apparently:\nHow to display a link to the task in notifications?\nAlthough there's also a Application URL setting in Settings > Application settings, not really sure which one of those two is more important here.\n. It's possible, but slightly more difficult than just adding an extra line. If you want to test it, you should be able to by\n- adding tasks.description, in the SQL query at Model/TaskExport::getTasks\n- adding e('Description'), to Model/TaskExport::getColumns\nNote: You have to insert them at the same index, i.e. add it after tasks.title, and e('Title'), for example, otherwise your csv file would have the wrong column names I think.\nAlso this would export it as raw Markdown I guess.\n. Does it happen in any textbox/field in particular or everywhere?\nIt seems fixed in v1.0.8:, no idea why though.\n``` markdown\nemail1 foo@example.com\nemail2 foo@example.com\nemail3 mailto:foo@example.com\nemail4 foo@example.com\nemail5 foo@...\nemail6 foo@...\n```\nhtml\n<p>\nemail1 <a href=\"mailto:mailto:foo@example.com\">mailto:foo@example.com</a>\nemail2 <a href=\"mailto:foo@example.com\">foo@example.com</a>\n</p><p>\nemail3 mailto:foo@example.com\nemail4 foo@example.com\n</p><p>\nemail5 <a href=\"mailto:foo@example.com\">foo@...</a>\nemail6 <a href=\"foo@example.com\">foo@...</a>\n</p>\n\n. Well.. sort of. There's no turn-key solution, but it's doable:\nYou could dump the project_activities table from the database, filter for task_id = ..., and use the data column - it's simply a serialize()-ed dump of the $task object, so you wouldn't even need to diff and watch for changes.\nPlus, it already tracks many task-related events(List) including column change.\nHowever:\n    - project_activities default size is 5000 elements, after that it starts removing old entries\n    - It's quite new, so everything that happend before v1.0.8 is missing\n    - Deleting a task removes every entry about it from the the database, including the project_activities entries\n. You could try adding a few calls to debug($message) to Model/Authentication.php.\nauthenticate($username, $password), validateForm(array $values) and Database::authenticate($username, $password) all seem worth a shot. Hopefully, that'll show whether it's something technical between browser and server or something in the code.\nIf that doesn't reveal anything, dunno.. maybe something like Wireshark?\n. That's certainly strange, but at least something to start with.\nTime for some backtracking I guess... yay? :neutral_face: \nThe only place validateForm gets called from is in User::check where it checks the data it got from the request object via Request::getValues. So unless somebody has a less boring idea, I'd say that's the next debug place.\nBest to just dump the whole frigging $_POST thing and throw in $_SESSION as well, in case the CSRF token is somehow missing. I know session management gave me a bit of trouble in the past when I had it running via cookies, but that has all been fixed afaik.\nStill weird though, since between getValues and validateForm nothing about the request data is changed.. so unless your FreeBSD jail is doing something strange with regards to $_POST it only leaves the token :worried: \n. CSRFToken it is, I guess.\nRemoving the && Security::validateCSRFFormToken($_POST) in getValues should work as a quick fix and as a way to check if it works.\nBeyond that, you could place another debug in Security::validateCSRFToken and check what $_SESSION contains. If it's empty, check if stuff like PHP's session.save-path maybe are locked off due to  jailing or something. The default is /tmp which should be fine and kanboard only changes it if actually configured to do so, but who knows.\n. ",

After installation you should have a composer.phar file. You can either rename it or simply run it by using php composer.phar install\n. you just execute that on the command line, in the directory where you checked out kanboard.\n. I think i've addressed all issues you had. \nAccidently another change was added to the pull request (https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/pull/2435/commits/035c6225b9b4db6765a60d475b676b5c739b23a7).\nI don't know how to remove it from the pull request, because this is a different feature.\n.

Can you have a look at it again? \n. I would really love to have this PR merged, so that i can release the Plugin. \nWhat needs to be done to have this merged?\n.

For example, one writing tests and the other writing working code. Or better yet, pair programming: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming\nIf you still disagree, how do you recommend displaying two software engineers \"pair programming\" (super, super common these days) on a task on your Kanboard? Make pair-combinations for all 7 people on the team? 28 of them? Or just have each task represented by one of the two developers?

    "BlueTeck": "I think this is solved in the master branch, isn't it?\n. If you click on the task number, a simple popup exists, but without comments, files etc...\n.

I have tested it, it looks nice, but here a 2 little things:\n- a card could link to itself, i think that shouln't be possible\n  . and one screenshot warning:\n  \ni will proceed with my test later.\n. I am not sure if I made is mistake or not ;) Got the following message: \nFatal error: Class 'SimpleLogger\\Logger' not found in /var/www/virtual/########.de/htdocs/todo_dev/app/ServiceProvider/LoggingProvider.php on line 15\nIn the fguillot-master i have no problem...\n. There is a priority field since 1.0.25\n. I have another little test/demo, with an ICS (iCal) Kalender, but it should work like the CalDav you need. I could upload a demo like #383 tonight or tomorrow morning. And later if @fguillot commentet on it, I could integrate both into kanboard.\nIt is working in Google Caledar, so it should work with Thunderbird etc, too.\n. That is correct, its readyonly. Here is the new demo, with ICS for download or to include it as webcalendar. But there is a little timezone bug if you dont use UTC+0 , #398.\nhttp:/##############/kanboard_calendar_demo/\nSource at: https://#################/php-kanboard-calendar/tree/master\n. I have started to integrate the demo into kanboard, see screens in #383 any further ideas?\n. Calendar View #490 \n. In this version it is not included, it is just a calendar view using fullcalendar.io\nIf have started to implement ical, but i was not so happy with it...\n. I think the first step is an mobile UI. The sync/offline data, is the second step.\n. I totally agree with you. I think Trello did it really nice and beatifull. I have used Trello, but I moved to Kanboard, because it is open source, and you could host it by your own, and also you could contribute to it. I think the first step should be a simple app, that only displays the data using the kanboard API.\nTo organize the ideas, I have created a GitHub repository. So everybody could brainstorm and develop an android app.\nhttps://github.com/BlueTeck/kanboard_android_app/issues\nP.S.: I have not so much Android experience too, but I will try my best ;)\n. I am not able do make a working RPC-API call in Java, does anybody had some experience with RPC in Java?\n. Yes, i have tried that one, but I was not able to make a call.. maybe it was a stupid mistake, but it doesn't work for me...\n. @levlaz what about notifications, share button from other apps? This is not possible in webapps, or am i wrong? In general i agree with your, webapp is the best, not my native android try.\n. I am currently playing around with with AngularJS and Kanboard:\nhttps://github.com/BlueTeck/kanboard_angular\n. There is also https://github.com/HarryCLucas/KanboardMobile. I think it is a nice solution. But i don't know what fguillot will design ;)\n. There are some analytics since a few month:\nhttp://kanboard.net/news/version-1.0.10\n. :+1: \n. If have tested 2) recently, works fine, until there is the first HTML Mail, that have to be transferred to markdown.\n. You could use the API to do that at the moment. (createTask)\n. There is a new Plugin System in the next Version, so you could add anything you want.\nhttps://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/doc/plugins.markdown\nBut a little bit of coding is needed. \nI already thought about a plugin or a core function that allows you to add custom fields via GUI. Like the wordpress custom fields: https://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Fields\n. Technically it is now possible with the metadata table :+1:: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/doc/plugin-metadata.markdown\n. A preview/thumbnail of attached images would be very nice.\n. What do you think about this?\n\n. at the moment kanboard supports image types, that are supported from php getimagesize https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/app/Model/File.php#L122 http://php.net/manual/de/function.getimagesize.php\nThis php command supports:\n[IMAGETYPE_GIF] \n[IMAGETYPE_JPEG] \n[IMAGETYPE_PNG] \n[IMAGETYPE_SWF] \n[IMAGETYPE_PSD] \n[IMAGETYPE_BMP]\n[IMAGETYPE_TIFF_II] \n[IMAGETYPE_TIFF_MM] \n[IMAGETYPE_JPC] \n[IMAGETYPE_JP2] \n[IMAGETYPE_JPX]\n[IMAGETYPE_JB2] \n[IMAGETYPE_SWC] \n[IMAGETYPE_IFF] \n[IMAGETYPE_WBMP] \n[IMAGETYPE_JPEG2000] \n[IMAGETYPE_XBM] \n[IMAGETYPE_ICO]\n. I have changed the layout, i think it looks much clearer, you could see the whole width of the picture, but not the full height, on hover, the image extends.\n\n. @lawre i thought about an option per project\n. I think the general option is a bad idea, i like this:\n\n\nYou could select one image from the attachments as cover. So not every task with images has a cover image. \n. as @fguillot said, its wirking fine with screenshots.\nregarding the cover image i am playing around with it, but it isnt finished. https://github.com/BlueTeck/kanboard/tree/cover_image\n. It is me again ;)\nThe coverimage is coming via plugin, first version is a little bit ugly but working via plugin. I will improve it in the next days.\nhttps://github.com/BlueTeck/kanboard_plugin_coverimage\n\n\nOnly working with the kanboard dev version or the next release.\n. First Version released:\nhttps://github.com/BlueTeck/kanboard_plugin_coverimage/releases/tag/0.1.0\nNeeds Kanboard v1.0.27 or the latest master\n. Sounds nice, maybe an option to turn this feature on and off would be cool.\n. It should be a little bit like github:\n- new table participants with task_id and user_id\n- if a user changes something on a task (rename, move etc) the user and taskid should be stored in this table\n- if a user is assigned, his user_id is also added\n- notifications should be sent to matching users is this table\n- in the frontend, there should be a button to remove and add yourself as participant\nAgree with it?\n. Or something like comments on a comment.\n. Just to understand: \nYou changed the name of a column, but instead of hitting the save button, you want to delete a column first?\n. Google Translate:\nsearch field in \"View another project\"\nhello,\nbecause my English disastrous ...\njust a quick note to report that everything seems to work as nickel FirefoxOS 1.3 (on ZTE Open C) and Firefox as browser.\nA little annoying point when you click (with your finger) \"View another project\" that appears above the virtual keyboard because it is the field of research that is enabled by default. This would be more convenient if this field of research did not cause the automatic display of the virtual keyboard.\nsee you soon,\nNB: great application by the way: 1:\n. I have enhanced the demo, you could view the calendar per project now, and if have added a ICS-Url, see #105 \n. I will include it into kanboard and make a pull request.\n. First impressions:\n\n\n. At the moment i am using the due date, other dates dont make sense in my opinion. you are right it is the fullcalendar.\nIn my dev version, all active task with due date will be displayed. The color of the event is the color of the task. If you click on the task, it will open.\nDone:\n- fix task color use the same css color as kanboard (done)\n- add filter (user, category (maybe column)  (done)\n- allow drag and drop to chage the due date  (done)\n- add translation for english and german  (done)\n- code clean up and comments  (done)\nPlanned:\n- include ical url, to include in google calender, outlook or other programs\n- better performance \nWhat do you think @fguillot ?\n. Dev-Screen with filters in sidebar:\n\n. The pull request is without the ical feature, i am not happy with that at the moment. Maybe later. But the Calendar should work fine :)\n. #490 \n. in dev branch now\n. Other Topic #129 \n. see #129 \n. Thanks\n. There is a priority field since 1.0.25\n. \nEdit: okay, so you need to update\n. I like it ;)\n. okay i will do it tomorrow or Saturday. \n. @lostsol95 there is already a feature request -> #547 \n. okay ;)\n. @fguillot what do you think about?\n. doesn't fit, i will make a new pull request\n. -> #470\n. At the moment you can't login, you have to use the \"master\" token. Token per user is requested here: #386 \nYou are very welcome to develop/contribute to the android app i have started 2 weeks ago. I am a beginner at android development, but I wanted to try.\n. Thank you very much, i will play around with it alter :)\n. From the news:\nChange about the minimum requirements\nThe version 1.0.10 requires at least PHP 5.3.7. That means a default PHP installation on Debian 6 Squeeze are not supported anymore.\nNote: I don't maintain anymore the official Docker image on Docker Hub. However you can always build your own image from the repository.\n. I think its clearer ;)\nAnd if you want enhance it, for example add a project owner flag, it isn't possible at the moment.\n. Fullcalendar needs moment.js (\"[...] necessary Moment and jQuery files.\")\nPlease let me know your improvements, so i can make it better next time ;)\nI dont wanted to change many kanboard files and implement new methods, i think you will do it now.\n. I will improve the coding by myself in the next days.\n. I have changed the code, but i will do more improvements later.\n. I will close this Pull Request and make a new one, because i developed in the master branch and I will contribute the german translation before release. So i have to organize my git better ;)\n. see #317 swimlanes\n. I had some new ideas, that i will implement:\n- use same filters like the board and save selection (localstorage)\n- refresh calander periodically like the board\n- swimlane/color filter\n. Removed Merge conflicts, added the things i wanted, now its your turn ;)\n. @oparoz the swimlane color option is a filter in the calendar view, so its correct here ;)\n. \n. :thumbsup: nice code enhancements :)\n. #542\n. see #92 \n. -> #105\n. I like it :+1: \nNote: The default links should be translated.\n. Works fine (Windows 7/ newest Chrome), but is it needed in the dropdown menu?\n. Right click or left click on the id or a little button is not important. Important is a way to archive your goal faster. Should i implement a menu like that (click on id or button) or do you want to do it by yourself?\n. If I use Jquery and not just CSS3 it should be working on all devices. I will make a prototype.\n. I am not sure if i should append the dropdown to every task due rendering (https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/app/Template/board/task.php) or if i should load the dropdown via Ajax if it is needed. I would prefer Ajax, any suggestions?\n. Click anywhere is also a possibility. Or it could be changed, click on the Id is the actual left click on the task, and left click anywhere on the task is the new menu. We habe also to define the functionsof the new menu (i.e. color, member, categorie).\nMy personal intent was to change color, category and user faster. This could be done by a better popover too.\nI have taken distance from my idea, to do it with jquery by myself. Jquery UI which is already used in Kanboard has a menu funktion, which is also usable via keyboad. http://jqueryui.com/menu/\n. Now work in progress :smile: \nhttps://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/commit/e582d4047b061f0c17e6366fed2bf1cabd624c10\n. Could be closed.\n. Issue could be closed.\n. Do you mean the popup, if you click on the task id?\n. I don't know the reason behind, but i am currently developing a new quick access dropdown menu -> #520 \n. working\n. -> #463 \n. :+1: and the same with columns. That would be the first version. Later you could change the Ajax call, so that hidden task aren't updated.\n. And it should be visible that the swimlane is empty and not hidden adnt he other way. +/- Icon for example\n. Yes, the icon and also rest is simple, you just need some time ;).\nIcons should be from font awesome (http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/).\n. I tried it, and it is working fine (just the +/- button is a little big and blue :smirk: )\nThe js code should be in /assets/js/src/board.js the app.js is compiled for release from the files in src.\n\n. Maybe we can get more space, compare 1 and 2 on my screenshot (quick and dirty):\n\nInstead of 2 rows we only have one row.\n. Very nice! \nWould work,  but i wouldn't set it in the beginning. @fguillot could give you the right place/order he did a lot of refactoring wuth my js code ;-) \n. In the current dev, you could see all your tasks in the dashboard, bt you mean all tasks right?\n. Its not a formatting thing, in the databease there are all unix timestamps. This one should appear in the calender. Do you see other tasks in the calendar?\n. I could reproduce it, i will debug tomorrow.\n. The problem is, that the calendar is not refreshing when switching the month. It is only pulling new data, if the filter is changing. So there is a bug in the merge of the calendar.\n. :+1: \n. it was a bug should be fixed in the dev version  #543 #523 \n. which Browser are you using? \n. In the current dev version some things about the project duplication were fixed. \nEdit: I am wrong. You mean task duplication not project duplication.\n. In the current dev version this is possible:\nhttp://#########/kanboard/?controller=task&action=show&task_id=3\nTask Nr. 3 is always accessible through this link.\n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. it is a \"random\" number.\nWiki: id - A value of any type, which is used to match the response with the request that it is replying to.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC\n. Thx\n. In the current dev Version this method does not exists, but there is getMembers Method. Please take a look into your jsonrpc.php file which method exists.\nDoc:\nhttps://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/api-json-rpc.markdown#getmembers\nApi-Methods:\nhttps://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/jsonrpc.php\n. In your Kanboard installation, you have an Endpoint, which is the jsonrpc.php. In this file are the methods specified, that could be used. (should be easy to read, even if you are not familiar with php).\nI don't know which kanboard version you have. But in the development version here on github there is not getAllowedUsers Method, but there is a method that seems to be similiar called getMembers.\nWhich knaboard version are you using? The newest release 1.0.11?\n. Yes the documentation is wrong here... \n. The Key is the userid.\nI already proposed a change #461, but @fguillot doesn't want it.\n. But also this is written in the docs:\n- Result on success: Key/value pair of user_id and username\nhttps://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/api-json-rpc.markdown#getmembers\n. Idea: display hours, if the number of days is lower then 0.\n. :+1: \n. Hi,\nyour parameters are wrong, try\njson\n{\n   \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n   \"method\":\"createComment\",\n   \"id\":\"1\",\n   \"params\":{\n      \"task_id\":\"4\",\n      \"user_id\":\"1\",\n      \"content\":\"Test\"\n   }\n}\nhttps://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/v1.0.11/docs/api-json-rpc.markdown#createcomment\n. A few days ago I implemented the API method getProjectActivity with the paramter start and end. With this you could get the activitys for example title has changed. (like the Activity Stream in Dashbard).\nCommit: 3704e33c668a63868efec504e3999a9edd123665\n. -> it is not pushed by the server, you have to pull it\n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. Maybe @fguillot could put it here: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/README.markdown#related-projects\n. :+1: good idea\n. But if there is no category, you can't click it ;)\n. It is already in the development version.\n. you could already change the due date by drag and drop. \n. feature see #436 \n. :+1: \n. ah okay\n. sry i didn't know that it is possible to link between projects.\n. Looks nice, but i think categories could be removed then, and it should be possible to filter/search by tags.\n. Yes that is an important step for keyboard shortcuts, if you could select tasks via keyboard.\n. :+1: \n. In Kanboard you have subtasks instead of a checklist. Isn't that the same?\n. Thx\n. Also in the Filter box, but it is the source from chosen js code.\n.chosen({no_results_text: \"No results match\"});\nsee https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen/pull/606\n. Thx\n. :+1: I have also noticed that and it would be very handy.\n. something like this, just a little change:\n\n. It's in the master branch now, issue could be closed.\n. There is no option, but you could change the code:\nhttp://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/8214aae1d6c60b3d6726729d7532d8ee0df629ce/assets/js/src/calendar.js#L33\n. I will make a new pull request, with better code that is using thumbnails. \nPlease look at #694 \n. Thanks :+1: \n. good idea\n@greg35 There is already an automatic action, that adds a comment when the task is moved to another column\n. Okay i will restrict the image types, because it is not working at the moment.\nExample:\nIf you upload a .tif file, you will get the open button behind the file (because of \"is_image\"), but my browser chrome is not able to display this.\nScreenshot from stable version:\n\n\n. I know that you want a backgound image, but there are also 2 pull request for \"official support\" of custom css: #618 #666\n. Did you check if the database field is long enough?\nPR from issue #176\n. Are they members of your project? \n. see #689 \nif you want to change it in the stable version see commit 313318a\n. There are tools in the internet for this:\nhttps://www.google.com/webhp?q=migrate+sqlite+to+mysql\n. 7 hours ago http://kanboard.net/news/version-1.0.13\n. THX\n. Already requested ;) #521 \n. Could you give me an example, why do you need every textarea as realtime collaboration textfield?\n. Duplicate #722 #698\n. You could remove it from your code: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/app/Template/board/task_private.php#L34\n. you could do it via settings\n\n. Is this really needed? I think the close task option is enough. Normally you close a task and don't delete it. \n. Its already in the current dev version.\n. I agree :-1:\n. Upgraded also and can't confirm your issue. \nMy Chrome Extension https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kanboard-quickmenu/akjbeplnnihghabpgcfmfhfmifjljneh uses this API call, and it works fine.\n. It was a feature :-) \n. Okay, if you want, we could remove it, but this pull request ist not the right way, i could do it by my own. i will change it with the #717 enhancement next week. \n. I have created a PR for that #782\n. This is possible: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/doc/search.markdown#search-by-the-due-date\nIssue could be closed.\n. see #646\n. And what should happen if mention a user in the description?\n. Did you read the help?\nhttp://kanboard.net/documentation/windows-iis-installation\n. here it is:\nhttp://kanboard.net/news/version-1.0.13\n. thx\n. duplicate of #725 and others\n.

Maybe this will help you: \nhttps://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/contributing.markdown#i-want-to-contribute-to-the-code\n. You're right. The Task-Move updates the board, but the response seems to be to slow in your system.\nhttps://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/assets/js/src/board.js#L242\n-> no problem in my system over the internet, its fast enough. Response time 200 ms.\n. -> #176 \n. Very nice, thank you :D\n. Subtask could be in the same table too (it would be very easy to implement #873 #943 #831 and others). \nInstead of adding is_milestone i would prefer a \"type\" field it is more flexible (like the wordpress post table https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types).\n. :+1:\n. see #262 #646 \n. Option A) new API method that returns kanboard/app/Model/Color.php->default colors\nOption B) enhance task method instead of color_id: \"Amber\" return\ncolor: { name : \"Amber\", background: '#ffe082', border: '#ffa000' }\n. With current version you mean the latest release, not your installed version, right? \nAutoupdater is also requested #894 \n. Could be found in your settings\n\n. At the moment it is not availiable.\n. After installing the web server may need to be restarted.\n. Regarding the cron job, there is already a command line interface https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/cli.markdown \nto collect daily information for analytics,\n(link #463)\n.

You could create tasks via email. -> see Documentation\n. Thats better :D\n. Are you using the dev version or stable? This change is only in the dev version at the moment.\n. There are already subtasks.\nhttps://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/docs/subtasks.markdown\n. -> like the Github Issue Filter\n.

See #176\n. +1\n. @fguillot what about bringing the task reference field to the frontend?\n. :-1: \nI agree with @85pando \nThe tasks are already grouped by swimlane.\n. Here it is: PR #1243\n. merged\n. Instead of changing the getMyProjectList Method, i would prefer a new method call getMyProjects (like getAllProjects). \nIf you agree you, there is already a PR #1246\n. will be reopened with images and better examples\n. Something like #873 ? Or did you mean something else?\n. That is already implemented. Try to click on the column name in board view.\n. @fguillot will add them\n.

You could try to experiment with the translation and replace characters /app/Locale/nb_NO/translations.php\n. But how should the board know if you want to move between swimlanes or if you want to move the task position in a swimlane?\n. By default this is not possible.\nYou could code something like this: https://github.com/ashbike/csv2kanboard\nOr in some database tools you could import/export data, so you could modify your user table.\n. In the next release you could do it with the new plugin system: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/doc/plugins.markdown#asset-hooks\n. Could confirm the probem of @alirz23. Click on plus to create a new task, cancel, try to collapse swimlane does not work. (latest Chrome; my installation and http://demo.kanboard.net/board/2)\n. :+1:\n.

You could use this plugin to overwrite texts without touching the core files:\nhttps://github.com/BlueTeck/kanboard_plugin_overwrite_translation\n.

Information : Updated for kanboard 1.0.7\n. Updated for Wunderlist 3.3.8 and kanboard 1.0.12\n. My import script is now deprecated. Since kanboard 1.0.19 introduced an exciting plugin system (even if it is in his alpha stage), this plugin must be used.\n. +1\n. Multiple categories could be an alternative to tags.\n. The markdown editor used by all the Stack Exchange network - which is simple and lightweight - is available as an open-source project here : https://code.google.com/p/pagedown/\nIt may be a solution.\n. Nevermind.\n. Whoops, apologize ^^ Thanks\n. ACHIEVEMENT GET!\n\nYou deserve it :) Everyone deserve it!\n. :-1: \n. Version 1.0-beta just landed: https://github.com/EpocDotFr/kanboard-wunderlist/releases/tag/v1.0-beta\n. Version 1.0 available.\n. Yup :smile: \n. Update: I also tested with your own JSON-RPC PHP client. Exact same problem whatever PHP version used: JsonRPC\\AccessDeniedException.\n``` php\n$client = new JsonRPC\\Client('http://wherekanboardisinstalled.com/jsonrpc.php');\n$client->authentication('jsonrpc', '{REDACTED}');\nvar_dump($client->getVersion());\n```\n. Thanks for your suggestion.\nIt works on the demo. All API methods are working. I don't get it.\nHere are additional informations about my configuration:\nVersion de l'application : 1.0.27\nVersion de PHP : 5.4.45\nPHP SAPI : fpm-fcgi\nVersion du syst\u00e8me d'exploitation : Linux 3.14.60-grsec-hosting-web-3.14\nType de base de donn\u00e9es : sqlite\nVersion de la base de donn\u00e9e : 3.8.10.2\nNavigateur web : Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:45.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/45.0\n. I upgraded PHP to 5.6.20, nothing changed (I host Kanboard on a shared host).\n. After investigations, it seems that with specific Apache PHP handlers some $_SERVER variables are not popularized, especially PHP_AUTH_USER and PHP_AUTH_PW (used by the Kanboard's JSON-RPC server).\nHere is a Stackoverflow anwser about this. Here is a part of the Symfony source code which deals with HTTP authentication.\nBoth are suggesting to add specific Apache configuration to handle this case:\napache\nRewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} ^(.+)$\nRewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]\nI added this configuration in the Kanboard's .htaccess, and now all is working! On jsonrpc.php, I'd print_r($_SERVER) after modifyng the aforementioned .htaccess, both PHP_AUTH_USER and PHP_AUTH_PW are popularized.\n1210 and #1859 have serious chances to be affected by this issue as well.\n(poke @fguillot)\n. This happens also for me in a random way on Firefox, regardless of the PHP and Kanboard version. A page refresh immediately fix this issue.\nHappens also on other websites, not only Kanboard.\n. Seems that the browser randomly fails to apply this CSS instruction.\n. Can you please make a pull request?\n. Thank you :). ",
    "EmmanuelMartin": "It is PHP 5.3.16 with  --enable-magic-quotes option reported by phpinfo() in \"Configure Command\".\nmagic_quote_gpc is reported as enabled.\nKanboard is running on an OVH mutu server. I have deactivated magic quotes in .htaccess and everything is fine now.\nThank you for your help (and sorry for the inconvenience). \n. Tags' mecanism is interesting but is not what we do with colours as long as we only have one category per task (and don't need more): it is used to distinguish projects.\nThis could be replaced with swimlanes or a multiproject view.\n. Great !\nWe can now do exactly what we need. Thank you !\n. ",
    "pslestang": "+1 after a fresh install on debian 6.0.4 / Apache 2.2.16-6+squeeze7 / php 5.3.3-7+squeeze15\n. It works, thank you very much.\n. ",
    "crabs-fr": "It works fine on B3 too.\nThank you for the work.\n. ",

From my personal perspective, this changes the very core of the flow in Kanboard, breaking the beautiful underlying concepts of Kanban. A task should have one and only one people being in charge.

    "levlaz": "This is an interesting idea, I am curious what the implications are for the task status. If they are not full clones and instead referencing the same card, does moving the card from work in progress to done move it on all of the boards? What about the case where the boards do not have the same column names?\n. @fguillot I am thinking on how to achieve this. On the UI side we could just do a nice multi-select widget like this http://www.erichynds.com/examples/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget/demos/ and allow users to select multiple assignees. \nThe problem in my opinion is with the data model. Currently it looks like the assignee is the task owner in the task table which is an integer value. We cannot place multiple integers into this table because that is nonsense. \nOne solution would be to make an association table like task_assignee and have that resolve the Many to Many relationship between tasks and assignees. \nAnother option would be to simply add a column such as \"collaborators\" into the tasks table and insert any user_id's into it as a CSV. We can them parse out the CSV list of user_id's and combine it with the owner_id to show all of the people that belong to this task. \nThe second approach seems a bit hacky, but I would love to hear your thoughts. :) \n. @paddymac841 there looks like there has not been much  movement on this feature. \n\nHave to implement this asap\n\nIf this is pretty urgent for your company then you can consider sponsoring this feature. \n. @fguillot I think Websockets are the best approach for this problem, do you have an implementation in mind?\n. @fguillot have you ever used Ratchet it seems promising. I think we should use the best tool for the job, but I think we can accomplish this with PHP using Ratchet which would make the code base more consistent IMO. \n. Perhaps it would make sense not to create a separate app but instead have the webapp be more responsive on a mobile device. The benefit of this is that it will run on pretty much any device without the need for a separate app. \nThis is especially nice for FirefoxOS, Android, Windows Phone and the upcoming Ubuntu phones since they all support HTML5 webapps pretty well. \n@fguillot Do you have any plans for a responsive mobile interface? If we were to create one would this be something that you would merge or would you prefer this to be a separate app all together?\n. @biazouk @BlueTeck Yes, this is a very important feature. Luckily it is possible to store data locally in web apps on FirefoxOS, android and other platforms. There is no limitation using this approach. \nFWIF everything in firefoxOS (including the operating system is a web app). Depending on how it is built, packaged, and deployed will provide various levels of access to local storage, notifications, etc.. \n. @biazouk I agree, it would be really nice because we could have one app that just works everywhere. :) \n. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\nHash: SHA1\nHi Frederic,\nThanks so much for taking the time to respond to this request!\nLandscape mode works great for me currently and I was thinking of the\nportrait mode as well.

Hey! Thanks for your comment. \n\n\nWere you getting any error messages? This worked for me on a clean install in my dev environment as well as on my production server where I am also hosting my kanboard in my home directory. \n. I also think that this would be a great addition. :) :+1: \n. This might make more sense to be a plugin. Although I can definitely see valid use cases for this, I think that anonymous issue adding is not a feature that most public boards would even want. \n@fguillot when you tag something as plugin does that mean that someone should start making a plugin or does it mean that you are planning on adding it to the kanboard org plugins?\n. I took a stab at this, but after using a couple of different approaches, there was no real clean way that I could see to do this. I think the best solution would be to have a proper \"installer\", this way in addition to creating users and changing passwords, you could also configure your database the first time that kanboard runs. \n@fguillot What do you think? Is there no \"installer\" for a reason, or is it simply because its a lower priority issue for you?. I think it would be better if we marked items as is_deleted rather than actually removing them from the database. The reason why is: \n\nStoring text in a DB is cheap, losing some unrecoverable data is expensive \nIn \"Don't make me think\" there is discussion on the UX pattern of letting the user do whatever they want and giving them a chance to recover, rather than continuously prompting them for anything that we deem \"dangerous\"  \n\nThis was especially true for me recently when I set up a new board and wanted to get rid of each column. Every time I hit delete column (even on an empty one) I was warned that I would lose all of my tasks (which did not exist). IMHO it would have been a better UX to just mark those columns, projects, tasks, subtasks, etc as is_deleted and not show them rather than prompting the user. \nOf course this would also require creating some sort of trash bin so that you could recover deleted items or even have the option of deleting them \"for real\". . Awesome! Thanks so much for accepting it! :) \nI have a quick question, I tried to look at doing this on the main task page as well (underneath the task-bar header) in templates/subtask/show.php but it looks like the array that is passed on this page is not the same array that is passed on that page. I tried to dig around but was not able to figure it out. Is it even worth doing on that page, if so, where is this variable defined. If we include nb_subtasks and nb_completed_subtasks then adding it to this page would be very simple as well. \nBest, \nLev\n. Thank you for the clarification, I was starting to do just that, I will work on it a bit more and submit a PR. :)\n\nOn Feb 1, 2015, at 3:00 PM, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Guillot notifications@github.com wrote:\nYes, it's not the same array, but something similar can be done with a template helper function. You have to count manually the number of subtasks completed and return the percentage.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/pull/568#issuecomment-72381158.\n. I was running into a similar issue when I was running kanboard inside of a container and accessing it through an nginx proxy. Can you elaborate on the nature of your kanboard configuration? I think this will help us troubleshoot why this is happening. \n. It looks this was updated in the last commit. Thanks! \n\nhttps://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/commit/22f44ef78820e75ce21913140b50d15c7213ccca\n. Even if you remove every user (which is not a valid use case, so it would have to be by mistake), the project owner can still see every project under ?controller=ProjectListController&action=show which would allow them to correct this error. . I want to work on this. @fguillot I can see a lot of potential future issues, would it make more sense to make this into a plugin?\n. Sounds great. I have Windows 2008 R2 server that i sometimes use for development. It has the last three versions of MS SQL installed so I would be glad to make sure picoDB works.\nThe plugin approach kind of creates a catch 22 since you need to \"install\" kanboard first before installing additional plugins.\nI guess it may not be a huge deal to temporarily have a SQLite database. In addition I suppose users could also install the plugin the old way. \nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn Jun 8, 2016, at 7:46 PM, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Guillot notifications@github.com wrote:\n@levlaz Before to add the support of MS SQL in Kanboard, the database library (PicoDB) have to be tested against the current version of MS SQL.\nI'm ok with a plugin, however the database provider class probably need to be modified.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n.

I had the same issue using the GitHub webhooks plugin (that was installed in the old way) removing the plugin fixed it. \n. @fguillot since it seems that having most plugins installed will cause the update to fail, would it make sense to just have a step in the upgrade process to automatically either: \n1. Try to upgrade all plugins and disable the ones that still don't work \n2. Just disable all plugins and tell the user to install them via the new plugin system\n. @fguillot I really like the approach that atom takes, they talk about it in depth in their blog: http://blog.atom.io/2015/10/21/introducing-the-atom-beta-channel.html\n. I had a heck of a time trying to get this working with phpunit, selenium, and firefox. Since I have done this extensively with python I will opt for that approach. Thanks! \n\nEdit:\nEr... turns out my issues had to do with incompatibilities with Firefox and Selenium. I would actually prefer to do these in PHP since there is not a lot of good examples out there and this could potentially help others write good PHP acceptance tests in the future. \nIn case anyone is curious, these two links are the best I was able to find: \n1. https://www.sitepoint.com/using-selenium-with-phpunit/\n2. https://phpunit.de/manual/3.7/en/selenium.html\n. Per the error: \n/var/www/html/app/common.php on line 3 \nthis is what is included on line 3 of common.php\nrequire __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';\n. This is happening because composer is not being installed or called by default. Sending a PR to fix this now. \n. @BlueTeck I think this may have to do with the name of the file. If you look at the makefile for plugin-budget https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-budget/blob/master/Makefile it has a specified archiving step. \nCan you try to add this Makefile to your repo and then: \nexport plugin=Coverimage\nexport version=1.0.29\nmake\nThis will be extracted as just Coverimage and should just work.\nBest, \nLev\n. This should already exist as long as a task has subtasks. \n\nDo you mean something else?\n. I will address keeping the same position. \n. Why not send a PR against the docs with these updates rather than making an issue?. Took a look at the schema, this would involve a DB change because the comments table does not track updated_date, only the date_creation. I think it would be useful to show both the created date and the updated date on the comment itself.. I use kanboard for multiple organizations and have about a dozen project boards. My solution to this is to create a bookmark for the boards that I care about in different browser profiles (I have one for work, personal dev, and side projects).\nThis feature would not really help me because I want my \"home\" board to be different depending on the context that I am in at the given moment. .

Advice around is to place a meta tag in header to allow for that, though we have no idea as how to deal with the Kanboard source code properly. \nThe message we get is as follows: \nRefused to load the script 'https://search-goo.com/plugin/prueba.php' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: \"default-src 'self'\". Note that 'script-src' was not explicitly set, so 'default-src' is used as a fallback.\nWe can't be sure of the implications of adding the meta content tag and allowing this 'search-goo' domain scripts to be used, though. Found it in this SO answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31211359/refused-to-load-the-script-because-it-violates-the-following-content-security-po and in this Google instruction: https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/csp/\nCouldn't fix it yet, though. Still searching for answers. \n. A task not assigned to me for which I completed a subtask weeks ago is visible now on my dashboard and there's nothing for me to do with it.\nSo what would be the user scenario in which that behaviour is desirable? . ~~Is there anywhere where we can have more informative messages, like a log? We have 'debug' enabled and there's nothing in the logs.~~\nThere's a log!

Does it clash with something that people would want to write in the description? Should it be possible to escape it?\n. Yes, autocomplete is a good point. It's really useful in order to not have slight variations of tags. Maybe some way to list all tags is needed as well?\n. This sounds like something that could help with many of the intended usecases for #85 \n. What's the ticket for the new dashboard? The old one had so much more functionality and showed more data. By default I think new users should get all notifications and then they'd need to reduce them if that's too much.\n. Ok, kindof the same. But I'd also like for several changes to be made at once in the UI, not just delaying notification in case there are more.. ",
    "seancarson": "In my opinion, I believe subtasks or a dedicated project board work best for sharing a common scope of work with a team or group.  In my experience Tasks with subtasks work great for small items, say parent tasks with no more than 1-10 steps such as templates or repeatable processes.  From my experience anything over that needs to have its on project board.    \nThe feature referenced in #2411 would allow for group communication around a Parent Task with group/team members communicating status and updates with the group via comments which would be automatically emailed to all defined CC field on the task.  The ability to add an Kanboard Defined Group to an Task CC field would also accomplish the same thing as assigning a group to a task as well.    \nA combination of a ParentTask\\Subtask, Task CC field and the ability to add Kanboard Defined Groups to the Task CC should cover must use cases.  \nSC \n. There is a way to do this right now in Kanboard. \n1. create a distro group in your mail system per team.\n2. Define a remote user with the distribution group email  and select disable login from form option.\n3. Assign said remote user to your board and begin assigning tasks to them.  Notification will then go to the users defined in the distribution group.  \nIm using this in place of Kanboard Defined groups that have task assignment and notification ability.\n. \nTest 22\n. So, After using Kanboard for some time I have been able to use kanboard a basic ticketing system.\n1.  All user that will submit tickets/tasks to your support board must be added to it.  Once this is done if you implement on of the plugins Sendgrid or PostMark user will be able to send emails to an plugin defined addreess and task will be created on your board under that user.  (Please see plugin documentation) \n2.  It would be good if a Requester Field could be added to the tasks objects but it not entirely necessary with creator and assignee already existing. Just depends on how you want to use both.  I think assignee is the most rebust option right now in kanboard, and could be used as the requester filed if it came down to it.  Analytics would be a bit throwed off though.\n3. The default filter is currently status:open.   In essence all users will be able to see all requests that have been added to the board.  For my use case thats ok, but this is different per each use case.  I have put in a feature request that would all board admin to set the default filter per board.   This would allow each users to see the tickets/tasks they created or requested depending on the filter you set.  creator:me or requester:me.  \nJust my observations.  \nThanks\n. Thank you for adding this.  This has been really helpful.  Please close request.  \nThanks\n. Also, here is my debug log after sending and email to my project\nroot@www:/var/www/html/kanboard/data# tail debug.log\n[2016-01-26 03:56:27] [debug] QUERY_DURATION=0.00073885917663574 ALL_QUERIES_DUR                    ATION=0.0046787261962891\n[2016-01-26 03:56:27] [debug] SELECT * FROM \"action_has_params\"   WHERE \"action_                    id\" IN (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)\n[2016-01-26 03:56:27] [debug] QUERY_DURATION=0.00064802169799805 ALL_QUERIES_DUR                    ATION=0.0053267478942871\n[2016-01-26 03:56:27] [debug] SELECT 1 FROM \"users\"  WHERE \"id\" = ?\n[2016-01-26 03:56:27] [debug] QUERY_DURATION=0.0006868839263916 ALL_QUERIES_DURA                    TION=0.0060136318206787\n[2016-01-26 03:56:27] [debug] SQL_QUERIES=6\n[2016-01-26 03:56:27] [debug] RENDERING=0.03521990776062\n[2016-01-26 03:56:27] [debug] MEMORY=1.79M\n[2016-01-26 03:56:27] [debug] URI=/kanboard/?controller=app&action=status&_=1453                    800806520\n. So I did what you asked and I still did not see anything close to the Receive Email entries detailed in your previous message.  I ran several combination of grep -a 'SendgridWebhook:' debug.log  along with grep -a 'sendgrid' debug.log and so one and found not corresponding entries to times I sent emails.  I still do however see them in the apache  access log.  \nI did notice one thing.  When I would go to Global Settings -> Plugins  I did not see any of my plugins listed intially.  I had to go and change my config file to fix.  I basically removed all of the paths which started like plugins or /data/files   and instead used the DIR.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'data'.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'debug.log'  terminology.  After I change the three entries. the plugins then appeared in the Settings -> Plugins section.    But even after this I am not receiving any entries in the debug.log nor are tasks being created on board from emails.  \nSC\n. // Enable/Disable debug\ndefine('DEBUG', 'true');\n// Debug file path\ndefine('DEBUG_FILE', DIR.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'data'.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'debug.log');\n// Plugins directory\ndefine('PLUGINS_DIR', DIR.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'plugins');\n// Folder for uploaded files\ndefine('FILES_DIR', DIR.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'data'.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'files');\n. My sending out bound still work fine as well.  This entry comes from a grep of the debug.log looking for sendgrid.  \n8 => 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://sendgrid.com',\n  'uri' => 'https://api.sendgrid.com/api/mail.send.json',\n[2016-01-29 01:11:11] [debug] Sending email to (My  Correct Email Address) (sendgrid)\n[2016-01-29 01:11:11] [debug] HttpClient: url=https://api.sendgrid.com/api/mail.send.json\n    8 => 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://sendgrid.com',\n  'uri' => 'https://api.sendgrid.com/api/mail.send.json',\n. The links are correct between sendgrid and kanboard.  I'm currently running kanboard 1.0.23-fix.  And the plugins are Sendgrid 1.0.2 and Budget Planning 1.0.3\nI will update to the must recent version of kanboard and see if that helps.\nSC\nSent from my BlackBerry - the most secure mobile device - via the T-Mobile Network\nFrom:notifications@github.com\nSent:January 29, 2016 7:29 AM\nTo:kanboard@noreply.github.com\nReply-to:reply@reply.github.com\nCc:seanacarson@hotmail.com\nSubject:Re: [kanboard] Kanboard not receiving email via Sendgrid Plugin (#1734)\nAs a reference, check out config.default.php.

So, I created a brand new server and followed the Ubuntu install instructions exactly.  I also used Postmark this time instead.   And now I do see Webhook entries for plugin=postmark.  The problem is now as it was before, tasks are still not being created  on the board.  I have verified that messages are being received and sent off to Kanboard by postmark.  I also added the PostmakWebhook: verification => in the receiveEmail function  and this appears in the debug.log as well.  \nBut I went a step further.  I Added the Postmak line to other parts of the function to see how it progressed and I didnt see any other beyond the \"in the receiveEmail\".  See below.  \npublic function receiveEmail(array $payload)\n    {\n       $this->logger->debug('PostmakWebhook: verification => in the receiveEmail function');\n         if (empty($payload['From']) || empty($payload['Subject']) || empty($payload['MailboxHash'])) {\n            return false;\n        }\n```\n    // The user must exists in Kanboard\n    $user = $this->user->getByEmail($payload['From']);\n    $this->logger->debug('PostmakWebhook: verification => User Must Exist Check');\n    if (empty($user)) {\n        $this->logger->debug('Postmark: ignored => user not found');\n        return false;\n    }\n// The project must have a short name\n$project = $this->project->getByIdentifier($payload['MailboxHash']);\n$this->logger->debug('PostmakWebhook: verification => Project must have a name Check');\n\nif (empty($project)) {\n    $this->logger->debug('Postmark: ignored => project not found');\n    return false;\n}\n\n// The user must be member of the project\n$this->logger->debug('PostmakWebhook: verification => User must be a member of the project');\nif (! $this->projectPermission->isMember($project['id'], $user['id'])) {\n    $this->logger->debug('Postmark: ignored => user is not member of the project');\n    return false;\n}\n\n// Get the Markdown contents\n$this->logger->debug('PostmakWebhook: verification => Get Email Content');\nif (! empty($payload['HtmlBody'])) {\n    $htmlConverter = new HtmlConverter(array('strip_tags' => true));\n    $description = $htmlConverter->convert($payload['HtmlBody']);\n}\nelse if (! empty($payload['TextBody'])) {\n    $description = $payload['TextBody'];\n}\nelse {\n    $description = '';\n}\n\n// Finally, we create the task\n\n$this->logger->debug('PostmakWebhook: verification => Task Creation Began');\n    return (bool) $this->taskCreation->create(array(\n        'project_id' => $project['id'],\n        'title' => $payload['Subject'],\n        'description' => $description,\n        'creator_id' => $user['id'],\n    ));\n    $this->logger->debug('PostmakWebhook: verification => Task Created');\n}\n```\nHere are the two lines in my debug.log after sending two emails properly formatted.  \n[2016-02-02 04:54:02] [debug] PostmakWebhook: verification => in the receiveEmail function\n[2016-02-02 04:58:39] [debug] PostmakWebhook: verification => in the receiveEmail function\nI must Also note that I did get one proper response early\n[2016-02-02 04:07:05] [debug] Postmark: ignored => user not found\nemail format: test+test123@mydomain.com \nThank You for your time.\n.

Not sure what I did wrong the first time but it is good now.  \nThanks\n. This is now resolved.  It appears it was related to the Application URL not being set right.  Because I have an sub folder in apache I should have added /kanboard/  to the URL.\n. In terms of your files not showing up try the following.  \ncd /var/www/html\nsudo chown -R www-data:www-data kanboard/data\nthis give apache owner rights to the kanboard/data folder which holds your files.  \nReference the documentation for Ubuntu 14.04 http://kanboard.net/documentation/ubuntu-installation\n. Good point nttict-nick-b.\n. +1\n. +1\n. Also, if it makes more since to set it globally a good location to place this feature maybe Settings > Project settings.  this is where all the other global project settings exist.\nI do think that per board is better and the most flexible option but if the design principle is global settings then so be it.  Either way this would be a good setting to have.  \nThanks\n.

Ok, thank you @fguillot .  And yes I do have the sub folder kanboard in my setup.  So when I add /kanboard to the application url links in emails work, but all my api/webhook calls fail with timeouts and such as @mordentware mentions above.  I noticed this when setting up email to task creation with Sendgrid and Postmark plugins.  \n. and Example of an Failed API call is below.  \nhttps://www.myurl.com/kanboard/?controller=webhook&action=receiver&plugin=sendgrid&token=67545fef6a0a3f43d60c7d57632d6e4af9930f064c12e72266b1c9b42381\nWhen I open this link in a Web browser I get an message that just says IGNORED. \nThis link is from Settings > Intergrations > Sendgrid\n. Well, the issue is now resolved.  After adding /kanboard/ to my application URL Emails now have  a working link and Sendgrid create tasks via email is now working properly.  Thank You for all your help.  \nSean Carson\n. You already have Move a task to another column and closing a task.  This is sufficent, but if possible category or color  triggers would be nice.  \nMy main ask though is the ability to place a event triggered task in a specific column and assign a specific category to it as well.  \nThanks\n. Got it, Thank you.\n. This is a duplicate of #2411 \n. Hello, take a look some of the request already made. \nKanboard as an Issue Tracking/Helpdesk System #1506\nAbility to Set Default Filters per Board #2222\nAbility to merge tasks #2223\nAbility to Select Destination Column and Catagory in AutoAction - move the task to another project #2264\nFeature Request: Abillity to Add CC field to Tasks #2411\nAs Both @mlbarrow and @fernandodiacenco stated you are not able to accept tickets from non project members.  It would be nice if users were autocreated as unregistered users or maybe even allow users by domain @doman.com.\n. This may help.  \nUnder KB Settings > Application settings\nmake sure your Application URL matches your hosting path. In my case I use apache  so my root is /var/www/html/kanboard  so my application URL is https://myurl/kanboard/ .  \nsecond check your apache configuration and make sure your permanent redirect are setup properly. If they are set it should be the same as your Application URL.    \nSC\n. Request from 2354.  \nHello,\nIf possible I would like to request that a CC or BCC like filed be added to tasks so that non creators and others not assigned to the task could be updated on task activity via email.\nFor Example. Tony Snow creates a task in kanboard. He assigns it to Jim Smith. Depending on how Jim and Tony have their notification settings they will both get notification on task activities. But say Tony wanted another person named Jill to be updated the tasks activities. This is currently not possible unless you create custom distro groups in your email server. and create users in kanboard with thoses custom groups as emails.\nThe CC function would allow Tony to Create the task, assign it to Jim and add Jill and or others as watchers/CCs of the task.\nThanks\n. As, I look at this further there is already a is a child of/is a parent of relationship already established.  This sort feature would be good to apply to this as well.  Which ever way your wanna go, I do not want to recreate the wheel.  \nThanks\nSC\n. If this is related to your dashboard view, and your seeing all your subtasks at once.  Consider creating a filter/search by swimlines.   See exerpt below from the documentation.  \nSearch by swim-lane\nAttribute: swimlane\nFind tasks by swim-lane: swimlane:\"Version 42\"\nFind tasks in the default swim-lane: swimlane:default\nFind tasks into several swim-lanes: swimlane:\"Version 1.2\" swimlane:\"Version 1.3\"\nSo in your case add the following to your search/filter field.  \nstatus:open swimlane:\"Work\"\n. will do next time.

    "NinjaPewPew": "I read all of the above, but I really don't understand why a simple sub-task with a specific assignee isn't enough. How would you be able to follow who done what in the task, if a \"group\" of some from is attached as responsible?\nEven if its just as some sort of history, who done what, a sub-task created by each responsible (and assigned to them) is much better. Even if you have a lot of \"pairs\" in your company, as @nekohayo mentioned, I don't see how having 2 sub-task is some sort of \"overkill\". At the very least it would be clear in the end who did participate and who didn't (for example if they were sick or whatever, but belonged to the \"pair\"). \n. I think some people forget that even in an team environment, you need a way to organize the different members of that team. Every team member has different skills and not everybody can do every task. A task should be something very specific and contained in on Kanboard Task (aka Card). Every team member takes the task they can do or someone else assigns task to them.\nThat is the Kanban methodology.\n. I hope this will come true :+1: \n. Glad this will happen. I like @mcorteel's idea with the cards.\nJust a little side note. I know Gravatar is quite popular in the private sector, but a lot of companies don't allow employees to register their company email address at external web services. So I think a mechanic to upload images would be greatly appreciated by many (me included).\n. 1.0.25 has added a priority attribute to tasks. That should be enough to signal someone that a task is important. Adding a Flag to task might just confuse people.\n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. Creat idea. I love the timer on sub task. Thats why I think it would be nice to have a automatically created default sub task.\n. It would be creat to be able to set a task limit based on assignees. I would also wish for a warning if you try to assign a task to someone at max capacity.\n. Probably connected with #1738. I assume the box should go down, but goes up instead. Thats why it appears above the selection box.\n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. If that is still a requirement for you, check out this KB plugin from @phsteffen. It allows you to replace the favicon with your own (amongst other things). . :+1: \n. We run our Kanboard preview version on the same server, just in a diffrent directory. If I'm logged in the production Kanboard (I use \"remember me\") and additionaly try to login to the preview Kanboard, I have the exact same issue. \nUsing a wrong username/password shows the error like it should, but using the right credentilas just redirects back to the login screen (without any error).\nI assumed that it has something to do with the remember me cookie and the session id that is stored in there.\n. Using https://myurl/kanboard always brings 403, but if I add a trailing slash to it, the site is displayed right away. Not sure if you tried that already.\nCan you post a screenshot from the error?\n. I totally agree that that would be useful. We always want to have a start date and a completed date, but in the current version the only way to achieve that is to close the task. I would love a way to set a task to done. That way the completed date could be set, without having to immediately close the task.\n. ~~I have the same issue, but with \"png\". It seems to be stuck at 0%.~~\n~~Edit: Forgot to mention, I use 1.0.27.~~\nEdit2: Never mind. Uploading does not work at all. Maybe something on my side.\n\n. I had this issue to. The error appears, because the date format in your settings does not match what is entered in the text box. Go to application settings and set the date format accordingly and it will work again without error.\n. I might not show it in the context menu, but it works just fine with the keyboard shortcut CTRL+V.\n. Automatic Action for re-opening a task would be pretty useful for us.\n. Is the source code available on github?\n. More or less the same as #2517.\n. In version 1.0.31 there is a warning telling you that setting the high or low priority to 0 will disable the feature. So this is either a feature or a bug. I think it kinda makes sense. Since if the highest possible priority is 0, there is no point in showing the selection.\n\n. Thanks. Question answered :)\n. I found the reason why it was removed #1932.\n. Dublicate #85 \n. Windows, Chrome/52, 1680x1050. Kanboard 1.0.31. Same issue, a lot of whitespace on the right.\n\n. The OR operator is not yet supported. Source #2519.\n. In 1.0.31 \"modified:recently\" does also not return any task. When I use \"modified:today\" as a test, it does show some task, meaning that \"recently\" stopped working.\n. To be fair, the sub task is automatically assigned to you, when you start the sub task. So it's not like you actually have to do anything.. The UI has been responsive for a while now. So using it on mobile devices is working just fine. I'm quite happy with it. Obviously there is a lot of personal preference involved, when talking about \"appealing\" UIs.\nI would love to hear what you mean with reorganizing the UI. You especially mentioned \"Grouping by functionality\". Maybe you can give me (and other interested parties) an idea about what you have in mind :-) . There is already a pretty long dissucsion going on for that feature since May 2014. You can find it in #85.. Couldn't you use the \"Custom Filter\" project setting for that? . If your personal anti virus software detects the URL as a phishing attempt, I would recommend adding a exception. See Kaspersky documentation for that.. Maybe that's an opportunity for you to contribute to the project! It seems to be a fairly easy change. Have a look at this file here.. We use Kanboard v1.0.41 and PHP 5.6.15 and the function still works. \nEdit: I just tested v1.0.43 on our server. It still works. I agree with @rautamiekka that it has something to do with your server.. I don't understand the question. You want to add more information, so far so good. But what information do you want to add? And why?. Good work :) The only thing that is missing, is a link back to your issue.\nPull Request resolves #3228.. I usually open the board view in a new tab and than jump from there via list to the other project. It takes a bit more \"effort\", but works fine. Doesn't even take long if you get used to it. . Both of these screenshots show different pages. The one is a \"board\" and the other the \"Dashboard\". That is the reason they do not look the same.. ",
    "krembo99": "I think that some people forget that the whole methodology is about collaboration of teams inside an organization  - not the single person's to-do-list. In many organizations, including mine , the tasks are collaborative by definition - and multidisciplinary  - and can never be performed by one single member, nor can be supervised by one for the simple reason that no one has the full set of skills required .  the team has the skill set , but not one individual. Assigning multiple users allows for example assigning two disciplines ( departments ) to collaborate on the same task ( via their heads .. ) \n. @NinjaPewPew  > That is the Kanban methodology.\nI think that you are talking strictly from a software POV.\nkanban was invented as an inventory control system in large manufacturing plants . \nMy organization is in fact, working with factories to install control systems for manufacturing and interfacing with real - life machinery and objects.\nTasks like \" install a 5 axis cnc machine\", or \"upgrade 60XX placement robot \" require hundreds of subtasks to be performed by a multidisciplinary team. \nThey can not be broken into smaller tasks because of the following reasons :\n1 - The teams and individuals already know their sub-tasks . There is no need to spell it out .\n2 - You would need to hire someone ( or more ) just to assign tasks all day ( and also assign the task of assigning the tasks )  .\n3 - where do you stop \"individual\" tasks ? at the machine level ? mechanism level ? screw level ?\n4 -  You will end up producing maintanace manual on the board .\n5  - and this is important  - you can not achieve same-time collaboration because each team member \"picks up\" their tasks when they are ready , they can, or they want ...\nOverall, in simpler mechanisms ( read : software ) this approach might work (scrum)  . but in larger and more complex projects ( Architecture, engineering , manufacturing , to name a few  ) - multidisciplinary teams are de-facto.\nEven simple tasks as \" move the large table \" can require 2 or 3 members . so what do you do ? assign it to the team leader , who then assign the task for each member individually ? you will end up assigning all task to the head of the organization for delegation - or in another case , all 3 team members report to moving the table at different times .\nJust like github ( and other collaboration systems ) encourage and support \" teams \" - so should this kanban board .

    "lawrenceweetman": "I totally agree with the OP. Those who disagree and say that a \"task\" should only ever be taken on by one person don't sound as though they've worked in a truly collaborative team, where even on small tasks collaboration like at-keyboard pair programming takes place (as defined in XP).. @dhornford - It sounds as though you are only viewing Kanban boards through the lens of a board displaying multiple projects being worked on by multiple teams. \nIf you're a single team (of, say, seven software developers) working on a single project then it's entirely feasible that you could have two people assigned to a task. For example, one writing tests and the other writing working code. Or better yet, pair programming: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming\nIf you still disagree, how do you recommend displaying two software engineers \"pair programming\" (super, super common these days) on a task on your Kanboard? Make pair-combinations for all 7 people on the team? 28 of them? Or just have each task represented by one of the two developers? What does that do for the Kanban principles of visualising workflow and having a transparent development cycle? Not use Kanboard?\nAt least it works for you, right?. @dhornford We do have separate boards. I'm specifically talking about a team board, where multiple team members work on one task. This happens in EVERY software team I know using any kind of board (Kanban, SCRUM, etc). \nPerhaps the issue here is that we work in different domains. In my domain, this feature is a necessity. In my domain, many people are trying to adopt Kanban. Your argument is for blocking the Software Engineering community from using Kanboard because the feature set is sufficient for your use case. That's a poor argument.. @dhornford \nThat's all fine. Commercial Kanban tools generally support it. For me it was the deal breaker when I was evaluating this tool.\nAs you say, it's up to the devs. Given that it's open source it's completely within my prerogative to create a fix and offer it back to the community, but unfortunately I don't have time right now so I haven't been able to offer. \nAll the best,\nLawrence .

    "NoodleBB": "\ud83d\udc4d It's an elementary feature.. Same problemes with the calendar view in Kanboard version 1.0.40\nBreaks in the displayed Taskbars. Doubled task bars. Some with a addition \"12a\" before the task number. It's heavily confusing.\n\n. Linked to: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-calendar/issues/3. Moved to https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-gantt/issues/11. @ChangePlaces: Do you have such a \"custom css\"?. @NinjaPewPew \nOn mobile devices custom UI-Widgets appear unreachable half outside the screen, or tasks are not dragable on the board. And also not in the calendar. The color-tag-popup sometimes scrolls, other times it moves out of the view. The behavior is unpredictable and there's no benefit. On the Desktop the widgets on create new task is not ergonomically ordered. The Board is very colorful, but total confusing, and partially badly readable (red text on purple ground, light grey on light blue, etc.). And making just little changes to 5 tasks take a lot of time, a lot of clicking and a mouse movements marathon. (Don't tell me about shortcut. The most of non-IT-users are using a mouse.) The current UI doesn't assists you, it's like a break. It is exhausting. - Btw. I found a css that reduced the massive color flash overdose. That improved the readability and reduced the confusion, but it can't recreate an elaborate UI/UX.\nWhat can be done better for example: When creating custom-ui-elements these should make the user experience better (Faster, easier, better readable, etc.). The color chooser is counterproductive. Would you give the users a native popup, then they could have the full list of colors with just on one click. (Overview). Without scrolling erratically around in an unsorted list. (Fast & direct). So what would be a better UI-Widget? When clicking on a color widget, it should bring up a color palette (like the date selector) where you can see all color-samples at once, and select it with one click. \u2013 Or other example: When there are these cool shortcuts - hovering in board view over attachment, sub-task- list-icon, brings up a preview-popup - why can't the date be modified, by just clicking on the date? It could bring up the date picker direct in the board view. - Result: 3 clicks reduced to 1.\nAnd dialogs should have one naturally flow direction. Currently it is more like a triangle. That's not good.  So build group of them. Sample: The keywords are \"tags\". The color is also a tag. The should be to side-by-side next to each-other and represent a logical group. Same with the dates. A group below the tags-group. Startdate on the left. End Date on the right. The Assignee is the person (or group) that does that task. So put it on the top. At the textline of the first field. This task has to be done by this guy. This is a group. Etc. When there's logical break separate it an use separator bar, to build separate blocks. Build the dialog in a flow from the top to the bottom. \nI've made a quick sketch, just show the concept. \n\nI'm sure, at the beginning there was a kind of ui concept. But when a project grows, and there's no specialist who's responsible for the task, it dissolves. At this point three hint's are not enough. It's like @krembo99 said \"As for now , the whole app is not consistent in UI\" You need an UI professional, who can invest he required time to completely overhaul the current UI and UX from the ground up. \nP.S.: There are different attempts (jitamin, presenter, Kibur style) on that problem. But each focuses just on a single aspect (jitamin -> action clutter, Kibur style -> colorcrash & readability), not one the whole project. But maybe you could invite one of these guys. @krembo99 has offered help for that topic in september.. The date selector plays hide & seek.\n\nBut he doesn't move even if try to pull em.\n\nWhen tapping the slider, there appears a text cursor. But the sliders can't be moved.\n\nI don't know what happens here, but when scrolling faster, the scroll view break off and moves away in the opposite direction.\n\nWhen dragging a Task you see the dark selection, but instead the view scrolls. Etc, etc. It's broken. And it seems, the UI was never testet systematically. \nDevice: iPhone 6S\nOS: iOS 10.2.1. @NinjaPewPew \nThank you.

Implementation completed, unit test written and passed, code pushed, enjoy the feature !\nYou can also provide me valuable feedback on my implementation, improvements and bugs.\nYou can try it as pull request #3431 on the kanboard official repository, or directly by cloning the branch feature85 in my fork of the repository at https://github.com/krustymars/kanboard. @asmwarrior : The update of the schema is already included in my branch ;)\nFrom what I observed in the code, the app apply schema updates at startup, so the procedure is to stop your current instance of kanboard, apply the branch, then restart your kanboard instance.\nIf you want to see the details of schema update I created it's in app/Schema/{$DBname}.php\nBasically one more table task_has_users taking couples {task_id, user_id} as primary key. Hi @tpimont , thanks for your feedback :+1: and I'm glad my work is useful for some people\nI've been waiting this feature for a while too once I deployed kanboard in my organization, and I finally decided to implement it myself after I left my organization, this is kind of ironic :smile: \nTo answer your request with a joke \"this is not a problem, it's a feature!\"\ntldr: the owner name already appears on the task header, the assignees letters appear in circles\nTo give you more insights : \nWith this implementation of the feature, 2 different notions appears now : the task owner (only one person, who was previously the person assigned to the task) and the task assignees.\nIn order to provide an implementation that fits the larger number of organizations use cases, I implemented the feature with the following specification in mind\n- the owner role is person responsible for the task being executed (it doesn't imply actually executing it himself)\n- the assignee role is the person actually executing the task (it doesn't imply he become the owner)\n- a user can be both a owner and an assignee on a task (being both responsible for the task, and actually executing it)\n- a task can have a unique owner or no owner\n- a task can have several assignees or no assignees\nThe use cases I intend to cover by doing so are:\n- \"managed team\" team where there is one person responsible for the task execution (the owner), but is not involved in executing the task. The assignees are the people who execute the task.\n- \"self organizing team\" team where all the assignees are responsible for the task execution and self organize to execute it.\n- \"leader organized team\" team where the owner and the assignees contribute to the task execution. The owner can be seen as a leader or a senior contributing to the task as the assignees do, and being the responsible for its good execution. He will be both registered as \"owner\" and \"assignee\" on the task to materialize it.\nFrom your feedback, I realize that it wouldn't be bad that the following assumption is made\n\"If a task has been assigned to an owner and has no assignee assigned, the owner becomes the assignee by default\"\nWhich will bring back the circled letters or avatars on your tasks where there is only one owner and no assignees, and avoid breaking previous behaviour on tasks with no assignees.\nWhat do you think about it @tpimont ?\nOther people, I'm also interested in your feedback please !. @tpimont \nyes I see\nWhat do you think of the proposition made in my previous message\n\nFrom your feedback, I realize that it wouldn't be bad that the following assumption is made\n\"If a task has been assigned to an owner and has no assignee assigned, the owner becomes the assignee by default\"\nWhich will bring back the circled letters or avatars on your tasks where there is only one owner and no assignees, and avoid breaking previous behaviour on tasks with no assignees.\n\nOr simpler, if there is no assignees and a owner, the task displays the avatar of the owner. This would avoid you to reassign all your tasks\n. @tpimont @rajo \nYes basically the 2 options here are\nOption 1 : modifying only the display, in order that a task with only a owner and no assignees will display the avatar of the owner. If assignees are added to this task, the avatar of the owner will disappear, unless he is also added to assignees of the task.\nOption 2: \n- assigning the owner as assignee by default to any new task, if no assignee has been selected in the assignee list. The user being both the owner and the assignee, is avatar will appear.\n- modifying the database update when the branch of the feature is applied, in order that any already existing task having a owner and no assignee will be added the owner as an assignee. The avatar of the owner will then appear, because he have became an assignee in the database\nI like option 1 very much because it's less work to do :laughing: . @tpimont indeed\nI let a little bit more time to other users to give their feedback or other propositions. @russellault\nThanks for your relevant feedback. Indeed, what you're proposing would be perfect, though it's a lot more work to be performed before all the users of kanboard can benefit from the multiple users in a task feature. I can totally see your proposition as the final result of the feature implementation.\nHowever in the meantime, a lot of kanboard users would like to have this feature, at least minimally implemented. It's a kind of balance between heaving to wait, and having the final perfect version of the feature. I think @fguillot might be the most appropriate person to say which balance would be desirable.\nIn my opinion, the proposition made by @tpimont is the more adequate as it avoids breaking anything, and let the feature be available for all users wanting to have it, and not involving a whole lot of additional development for me, my time to do it is scares at the moment.\nWhat do you think @fguillot ?. > In real world scenario, a task should not be created if there is no one to assign it to \nI see a lot of organizations (including mine) where tasks are created in bulk far ahead knowing who is going to execute them\n\nIf an assignee has not yet been selected, then the assignee should be the project manager ( or equivalent ) and the task is to find an assignee :-)\n\nThis would break functionality for people who automatize task coloration based on no one being allocated to it, for filtering tasks with no user allocated, and so on... The assumption \"the project manager is the assignee until one assignee is assigned\" doesn't hold for all organizations IMHO\nHowever no one forbids you to allocate the project manager to your newly created tasks when they are created, and then the user that finally will execute them. ;). @piltraspn\nYou can use it from my pull request if you don't want to wait for integration in the master\nhttps://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/pull/3431\n. @dixon22ma  indeed I didn't realize that a merge have been tried in the main branch.\nI just checked, the error is because some other PR involving an update of the DB scheme have been merged before mine, involving the DB version being updated. \nSo I have to update the DB version key in my implementation, hopefully no big deal here. I'll do it as soon as I have a little slot.. +1 on this request, it would be really a nice improvement for usability. Much asked feature in my team ;) \nI have implemented it on my instance of kanboard, seems like to work.\nBTW it was a long long time since I didn't produce any php, my eyes are bleeding :laughing: \n@fguillot\nI'll propose it to commit once I have checked what are your requirements for code testing and implemented the test.. Pushed and pull request #3344\nEDIT : I realize I've been mistaken between this issue and #900 quick task edit button in column view\nmy pull request implements #900, and not #2072 . sorry, I didn't knew commits made to a forked repo after a pull request were automatically added to my previous pull request, so I closed it, then reopened it when I realised :). @kent1D if you want to use it before it's merged to the master of official repository, you can checkout branch feature85 from my fork https://github.com/krustymars/kanboard, the changes are already there.. Thanks @nougel :) and thanks for the feedback\nIndeed, for the moment the notifications mechanism hasn't been updated in order to send notifications to assignees as they have been assigned. I already had a look at the code for it, it will come into a next update.\nFor the time being I prefer to priorize implementation related to the feedback of @tpimont in this thread https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/issues/85#issuecomment-327809032, as it's related to the very core functionality.. I realized the merge have been tried and failed because since I developed the feature some others PR have been integrated leading to the database scheme ID to change and conflicting with my DB schema update (see https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/issues/85#issuecomment-366680970)\nI'll update soon the db schema files to comply with this..

I also need this feature, I think a project user need to see the whole progress of every tasks. Thanks.. I'm not familiar with PHP language, but I just looked at the source code from this package https://kanboard.net/kanboard-1.0.41.zip, and in the file kanboard\\app\\Template\\project_header\\views.php, it has such content:\n<ul class=\"views\">\n    <li <?= $this->app->checkMenuSelection('ProjectOverviewController') ?>>\n        <?= $this->url->icon('eye', t('Overview'), 'ProjectOverviewController', 'show', array('project_id' => $project['id'], 'search' => $filters['search']), false, 'view-overview', t('Keyboard shortcut: \"%s\"', 'v o')) ?>\n    </li>\n    <li <?= $this->app->checkMenuSelection('BoardViewController') ?>>\n        <?= $this->url->icon('th', t('Board'), 'BoardViewController', 'show', array('project_id' => $project['id'], 'search' => $filters['search']), false, 'view-board', t('Keyboard shortcut: \"%s\"', 'v b')) ?>\n    </li>\n    <li <?= $this->app->checkMenuSelection('CalendarController') ?>>\n        <?= $this->url->icon('calendar', t('Calendar'), 'CalendarController', 'project', array('project_id' => $project['id'], 'search' => $filters['search']), false, 'view-calendar', t('Keyboard shortcut: \"%s\"', 'v c')) ?>\n    </li>\n    <li <?= $this->app->checkMenuSelection('TaskListController') ?>>\n        <?= $this->url->icon('list', t('List'), 'TaskListController', 'show', array('project_id' => $project['id'], 'search' => $filters['search']), false, 'view-listing', t('Keyboard shortcut: \"%s\"', 'v l')) ?>\n    </li>\n    <?php if ($this->user->hasProjectAccess('TaskGanttController', 'show', $project['id'])): ?>\n    <li <?= $this->app->checkMenuSelection('TaskGanttController') ?>>\n        <?= $this->url->icon('sliders', t('Gantt'), 'TaskGanttController', 'show', array('project_id' => $project['id'], 'search' => $filters['search']), false, 'view-gantt', t('Keyboard shortcut: \"%s\"', 'v g')) ?>\n    </li>\n    <?php endif ?>\n</ul>\nSo, there is a if condition check to decide whether we need to show the gantt char, so can we just remove this if condition check?\nBTW: from kanboard version 1.0.42, gantt is moved from kanboard main code base to a plugin, see: plugin-gantt, so the specified file may different.. Oh, for https://kanboard.net/kanboard-1.0.41.zip, it looks like this code is controlling whether the gnatt is shown or not:\nkanboard\\app\\ServiceProvider\\AuthenticationProvider.php, it's 92 line is:\n$acl->add('TaskGanttController', '*', Role::PROJECT_MANAGER);, which means only project manager can access to the gantt controller.

The 2177 you referred was fixed already.\nAnd there's no such browser as Mozilla, not been for, what, 15 years without checking.. I confirm it's exactly like that.\nIn my case the setup is this, copypasted from the setup status:\n- Application version: 1.0.40\n- PHP version: 7.0.16-4+deb.sury.org~xenial+1\n- PHP SAPI: fpm-fcgi\n- OS version: Linux 4.4.0-64-generic\n- Database driver: mysql\n- Database version: 5.7.17-0ubuntu0.16.04.1\n- Browser: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:52.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/52.0\n. I think a separate option to be notified of subtasks would be better, as it serves environments where the assignee of a subtask can be expected to change but won't bother env where that likely wouldn't happen.. I think Assigned Only would be more clear. Other than that it's a good idea, +1 from me.\nOfftopic tip: update your Kanboard and especially PHP.. @george-viaud Just noticed your at mention points to another user who has nothing to do with this.. The collapsed tickets are similar to that, but I found it useless. I don't know other ways, someone else has to take this further.. @ChangePlaces The only way I know is to edit the database directly. I tend to avoid the bulk creation since you have nearly zero control on the tasks that way, and editing each one afterwards is even worse than precisely creating them manually.. @RRRRoger You must be on some very old machine to be using ancient versions.. ^ @dhornford If you don't mind showing the script, I can hopefully at least improve it assuming it's a Bash script. I can't perfect or anything like that (most likely), but I know a fair bit having to use Bash scripting; when Bash gets too hard, I turn to Python.. Agree, +1. It's not just a matter of changing 1 or 2 lines with a few letters, though, it takes some redesigning of the database (I think each task has a column where the designated user is referenced, so either that'd have to be replaced by another table or use some character to separate the users in the field. While the latter ain't impossible, it's against database design principles, but performance ain't really a problem since not too many ppl would be assigned to a task, but programming-wise it might pose additional mandatory things, namely making self-repeating queries) and changing of fair count of references to the old design, for starters.. Fill the template, need the step-by-step instructions.. That's different from 1.0.40 where the first lane has them below the lane's name and the second has them above the lane's name; reversed from that pic. Could be changing the lanes did it, as I changed the lanes and columns in my software production project.. I'm leaning towards Web browser doing it wrong. It seems you're using Google Chrome, so try extracting Chrome Portable (Firefox Portable just in case) to some folder, make sure Chrome is completely closed, start the portable one and try the bug again. If it repeats all the same, it's not a browser issue.. Just toggling Kanboard debug fixed that ? PHP7 is a possible culprit since some things were deleted altogether, so many PHP pages not specifically tested with PHP7 are unlikely to work.. You're on Window$ 7 yet you're using rather ancient Firefox.. 'all latest versions' is a really useless way of saying which versions you're running.. Your PHP is quite old. I'm not sure, but I'd update it even if it doesn't make a difference with this issue.. ^ Good news.. Can you\n1) duplicate your database\n2) update that duplicate to the current Kanboard by downloading the repo\n3) try reproducing\n?. Do we have a real reason to worry about an extreme number like 9223372036854775807 ? If you're using the autoincrement column the way you're meant to, there's just absolutely no way to reach that number, especially in an SQLite db. Also, I'm not aware of any means to jump the autoincrement in steps other than +1 (think you could use your own number during INSERT or UPDATE, but that's just not sensible). Even if you jumped the increment, you'd likewise have to use extreme numbers to reach it, and I just don't see any sorta sense in that.. First, update your ancient PHP.. @asoete Just cuz Kanboard supports it (and CentOS being retarded as usual) doesn't mean it won't be a problem.. I'd be updating that ancient PHP.. > chcon -R\n\nchown -R\n\nYou'd be wise to have -v/--verbose flag there.. A good idea. I imagine this'll be expandable from just the allowed users.. This could be expanded with a checkbox or a button to toggle temporarily showing the completed tasks, but I see 2 problems with that:\n1) The database query result could grow massive under right circumstances\n2) The performance impact on the user could be orders of magnitude. EDIT: Go to https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/issues/3275#issuecomment-306045426 instead.\nNote: I can't speak for other than Apache Web Servers, and whether this works right away ain't guaranteed as I've never tried to restrict a website's file upload like you seek.\nYou have 2 options:\n1) Apache main config\n2) the .htaccess file Kanboard pre-ships\nThe Apache main config is fastest since it's read once into RAM on daemon boot up and queried first while the .htaccess is processed every single time the folder tree is accessed, but the .htaccess is far easier to use.\nIn the Apache config you need to use specific directives to target the Kanboard area, and which ones it depends. Instead, I'll tell how to do it the .htaccess way:\nAdd this line inside the <IfModule mod_rewrite.c> block as the last line:\nhtaccess\nphp_value upload_max_filesize 2M. ^ Most likely a filesystem permission problem, but you should check Apache's error log first. On Debian/Ubuntu when not using virtual hosts it's /var/log/apache2/error.log.. Just to be sure: the db ain't something like SQLite, but a dedicated system like MySQL ?\nFill the template, as well, your post doesn't tell much like this.. > PHP version: 5.4.16\nTry an up-to-date PHP for starters.. I'm sure cURL has verbosity flags, even better if debugging flags, try putting those to highest (usually done by repeating the flag but it can differ; I don't use cURL). Since you mentioned cURL, it's quite safe to say you're on a Linux or another NIX system, so check man curl thoroughly.\nOtherwise curl --help or curl -help or curl -h.. ^ You mentioned someone else than me.. What versions are you on for the computer you use yourself and the Kanboard host ? OS, PHP, Web Server.. Won't that just add more CPU usage ? And not everyone likes shadows, especially ones thye can't disable.. First up:\n- Your web browser version ?\n- Your Kanboard version ?. ^ 'Latest' ain't a valid version number/string.. I'd update PHP to at least 5.6 to avoid and rule out problems. It probly won't help with this case but you never know.. The precise implementation could be LDAP, MySQL/etc. .... I think you didn't even try to read it. It clearly states what it does, in a nutshell:\nphp\n/**\n * Translate a string\n *\n * @return string\n */\nfunction t()\n{\n    return call_user_func_array(array(Translator::getInstance(), 'translate'), func_get_args());\n}\nThe func_get_args() is used to get whatever unpredictable arguments the function is given, which is why it's not initialized with defaults.. Since it reads -pve in the kernel version string, is this an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxmox_Virtual_Environment machine ?. If something is blurred, it should be done only once instead of rendered every single time. Besides, it probly adds to RAM usage, not to mention CPU usage.. That should be done on a project or installation basis, otherwise use cases which don't use a due date will have to switch away from Kanboard.. ^ I mean an option in the global settings (\"installation basis\") and in the project settings instead of changing Kanboard to always require a due date.\nCode-wise I can't help.. ^ Does that require due date regardless of whether you'll use one ? Not everyone uses one, thus requiring without an option to change it is unacceptable.. Show which ones cuz I'm confident you're not installing the SQLite PDO driver correctly.. ^ Normally you'd install whichever package the php#-pdo-sqlite virtual package [reverse-]provides (apt-cache showpkg php#-pdo-sqlite or aptitude show php#-pdo-sqlite), where # is your PHP version, like 7.2 in PHP 7.2's case. On Ubuntu 16.04.x LTS that'd be php#-sqlite3, meaning php7.2-sqlite3 for PHP 7.2. If Apache doesn't auto-reload/reboot after installation, reboot it.\nI'm not sure but I think Kanboard had problems with PHP 7.2. The machine I'm running Kanboard on uses websites that require older and the machine's not under my exclusive command, so I can't tell.. ^ Try apt-cache search '.*php.*sqlite.*'. aptitude would be easier .... ^ Judging by a bit of googling, SQLite2 ain't available for PHP on Pi, so that php5-sqlite should do it.. ^ Try installing the php5-sqlite package, and if Apache doesn't auto-reload/reboot after the package installation, reboot it yourself.. You guys sure you have high enough level of logging enabled ? For Apache 2.4.x and for 2.2.x. 2.4.x is superior to 2.2 here as well. IMO in 2.4.x you should use LogLevel trace6 at max instead of 7 or 8.. And I just checked that both MySQL and SQLite (no idea about Postgre) have the BINARY keyword in the WHERE clause which is used to force case-sensitivity for that part of the query, so you could have the db default to case-insensitive and check a setting of case-sensitivity in Kanboard's config, deciding whether to use BINARY keyword.\nI've used that keyword in some cases in MySQL.. Problematic on Window$ if any files are locked in use; Web Server needs to be shut down first, then an external app needs to install the new files.\nOn NIX systems it's no problem and that's how apps are updated.. Surely there's a way to detect TaskBoardDate's presence through PHP and just use ternary conditional here like\nphp\n// an expression that will be added to the predefined filters\n// checks for the presence of TaskBoardDate plugin, adds a query, otherwise nothing.\ndefine('ADDITIONAL_FILTER', isPresentTBD ? 'board_date:<=today' : '');\ninstead of relying on the System Admin ? If the SA wants to change anything on this line, he will, and the additional comment should tell him how to interpret that TC.. ^ A plugin can't change Kanboard's config file, right ? In which case it'd have to be changed in the plugin's config.. ^ Indeed. In some cases changing config files ain't even available to Kanboard Admins.. ",
    "rajo": "@krustymars with your final assumption about owner and no assignee (in order to avoid breaking changes) I'd say this would be very useful then. Yes, I can confirm this behaviour:\nwe have a KanBoard instance running here, with ldap-auth against an AD. So far, so good. LDAP/AD-Users can login, and, once logged in, can be assigned to Projects etc. \nAlso, we can get groups from LDAP/AD and they could be used for assigning group memberships in a Project. \nBut: when changing the project permissions by granting permission to a ldap group, the (already existing-by-sync) users within this group will only be updated after their next login. So unless everyone logs in again, those people e.g. cannot be assigned to tasks etc.\nThis is especially a bit annoying, as one of the last releases removed the \"grant access to everyone\" and hence groups must be defined.\n. @tzeumer this works very well\n@fguillot could this workaround become an official solution?.

While true, the current \"Assignee\" drop-down is replaced by some form of multi-select, using a new data structure to store the multiple assignees; in this mode, the \"owner\" is completely ignored.\nWhen the project setting is switched from false to true, the owner of each task in the project is added as an entry for that task into the new assignees data structure. When the project setting is switched from true to false any task with only one assignee has that user set as the task's owner, any task with more than one assignee will have its owner set as undefined, and a warning confirmation dialogue pops up explaining what's about to happen.\nBecause \"Allow multiple assignees\" is false by default, upgrading causes no immediate functionality change, and changes only start happening when the setting is enabled for a particular project..

Remove the database\nRe-create it\nAnd add this line to your config.php file\n// Set max_execution_time into php.ini\nini_set ('max_execution_time', 300); // 300 seconds = 5 minutes\nThis is a momentary solution, apparently the scripts exceed the allowed time limit.. @mechingineer to order ... I'm happy to help ...\n@fguillot Will you commit these changes in the main branch? or is there a better solution?. ",
    "creecros": "For those interested, https://github.com/creecros/group_assign\nI welcome collaborators if anyone wishes to improve. Had no idea anyone was working on this and just stumbled into this thread, but I think this plugin offers a minimalist approach that won't break anything in the process.\nBasically added owner_gp to task table and built relationships for lookups. \n. I've never touched the calendar, so I'll have to do some research on that one. . @lastlink the 85? I'm not sure i'm following you. . Oh, Feature 85....I'm slow to catch up...hell i just realized this wasn't group_assign issue page.. @lastlink off the top of my head I think the plug-in would be easily modifiable to accommodate that but in its current state you would not be able to use both plugins at the same time...overrides...I'd have to figure out how remove those\nOr combine both . @lastlink \nhttps://github.com/creecros/Group_assign/releases/tag/1.1.1\nAdded a multiselect for additional assignees, which I labeled Other Assignees \n\n\n\nAlso, fixed previous filter, it will now find assignee:name or assignee:username (using ilike) inside the group or multiselect and return the correct tasks with assignees.\n. And with v1.2.0, users assigned to a task via Group or Multiselect will have the task in their Calendar.. https://github.com/creecros/opencomment\nComment-only functionality, tested for over a week, works. Could use help making a nice package with plugin like qualities if anyone wants to tackle.. Try this:\nhttps://github.com/creecros/AutoSubtasks\nmight do what you want.. Working on this. Mostly done for tasks. Someone with better html/css skills is welcome to improve upon layout. Using dompdf.\nhttps://github.com/creecros/Task2pdf. @fguillot .color-picker{width:230px} would fix, not seeing any issues anywhere by doing so. Try this:\nhttps://github.com/creecros/SendTaskCreator. @fguillot how do i do that?. thanks, yeah, I eventually found it and made a pr. Try this:\nhttps://github.com/creecros/SendTaskCreator. After seeing #3363, I also added an action to send to assignee as well. So, both features are included. Let me know though, haven't tested.. can you think of any reason why adding time() would kill the code.\ntested with a simple action of sending an email with the date due as the subject. works fine. I then tried time() as the subject, and it won't even send the email. sorry, I'm clueless. not getting any error messeges in the logs. . nevermind, im a tard....to much coffee, typo.. I did this for someone else a while back:\n- Added Filter to plugin: https://github.com/creecros/Creecros_Filter_Pack\n- Added Plugin to kanboard/website#110\n. Solved for him using a template override and updated plugin.. - Added Filter to plugin: https://github.com/creecros/Creecros_Filter_Pack\n- Added Plugin to kanboard/website#110\n. I took a look at it, if it makes you feel better...I couldn\u2019t figure out an easy way to do it, and don\u2019t need a feature like this, so stopped looking into it. I\u2019m a shitty coder though, so there\u2019s that.. Not easily, that I could find. The task table only has owner_id for assignment, and everything related is based on looking up that user id. Would need a way to determine  that a group was assigned, instead of a user, and then a way to iterate through each user in the group, to perform whatever function that relates to assignment. There is probably a simple way to do it, but I usually don't find simple solutions until I go through complicated ones. I design and manufacture health and beauty products...so I am clearly not a programmer by trade, but I will continue to look at it with no promises.. Started working this, I think adding the functionality might be doable for an amateur such as myself, in the form of a plugin. I \u201cshould\u201d be able to add the option in task creation and modification to assign a group, then display the assign group in task details and the board view, allow filtering and dashboard query. However, it will be an added field in the task table, thus actions such as automatic actions, aka plugins, would have to utilize it independently. So, for example, an automatic email to Assignee, will email only to assigned user unless the plugin author rewrites their plugin to utilize the new field. Make sense?. For reference and collaboration, https://github.com/creecros/group_assign\nI welcome any help or support in development. . Done. Enjoy.\nkanboard/website#28. I believe everything exists to do what you want to do as a plugin. You could use any editor of your choice by including the css and js needed and calling to them via:\nOverriding the templates you need\nAnd using your own helpers\nor use current hooks to Add the links to use the templates and helpers, maintaining the ability to use the markdown editor and adding the ability to use a different editor.\nBut I don't believe your issue is with the editor, its with how that information is being displayed back to you, so you'd have to think about that as well.. It's really the\n\nThat's not working as expected.. I take that back, I am also able to Duplicate a task:\n\nwhich goes against\n\n. @fguillot Do you want a plugin or a PR?. Added functionality to @BlueTeck 's Coverimage Plugin.. Tried how? Link code. https://docs.kanboard.org/en/latest/admin_guide/upgrade.html\nor if using docker:\nhttps://docs.kanboard.org/en/latest/admin_guide/docker.html. Agree with @fguillot , custom role should achieve very close to what you want, but from what I can tell, I do believe it is currently not behaving as expected #3787 . . if you take a look at the projectAccessMap, I think you could limit a Project Member the way you want. \nWould be similar to this plugin: https://github.com/creecros/opencomment\nBut instead of adding abilities, you'd be taking them away. . Your issue is with the plugin, which is where you should open the issue. NGINX?. probably the same issue: #3844 . Yes.\nhttps://github.com/creecros/SendEmailCreator\n. solved:\ntitle in plugins.json has to match name in Plugins.php \n. as for Comment Tooltip, it will show \"Update\" vs \"Up to date\" because plugins.json version for it is 0.0.1, but it downloads and installs 1.0.1, so plugin.json needs to be updated.. kanboard/website#39. Your \"Which result in:\" screenshot, most of those are not emails generated by the automatic action, but by the notifications system. I'd just turn the email portion of notifications off, that could get annoying, send those to rocket chat or something. . The clarifying answer to your question is, notifications and automatic actions are 2 separate things and your issue is not with the automatic actions, but with notifications. \nAnything that happens in a task, will trigger a notification, and if it is set to send by email, that's gonna make a lot of emails. I use rocket chat for those, keeps my inbox clear and delivers real time info in real time to a system that isn't my inbox. This is a user level setting, so it is set at each users end, as an admin, you would have to set each user up with send by email method turned off, or let each of your users set it themselves.\n\n. Then just use \"Web\". unix time is what it is looking for. i.e. 1538154826, the number of seconds since Jan 01 1970\nOr is that what you are referring to when you say you tried 'U'?. Nevermind, Unix is wrong, use MM/DD/YYYY, tested and works on 1.2.5\nused:\n\nresult:\n\n. it's not clear what you are referring to. I just figured out what you are referring too, and after hitting \"Save\"\n\nIt's pretty clear it saved.. Agree with @lastlink , users like to edit their own info, what if someone gets married and changes their last name?\npretty sure it would be a very simple plugin. \nHints: \n Example of changing default roles in the form of a plugin\n This will help you understand the role you seek\n The controller that Modifies users\n getApplicationAccessMap()\n* APP_USER\nI just did it for you, without doing it for you....sorta kinda.. here's how you would do it\nhttps://github.com/creecros/Bak2topbotm\n. only thing i couldnt figure out was making the \"bottom\" button appear before scroll starts....leave that to you.\n\n. Oh, I think it's in the css, hidden by default...change that for the bottom button and it should be there before the scroll. ya, that solved it, works perfectly now. added you as a collab, do with it as you please.. Like on the board? I think there are templates for issues, you should use them and add some detail to feature requests.. It's passing through this template:\nhttps://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/app/Template/project_header/dropdown.php\nvia:\n<?php if ($this->user->hasProjectAccess('ExportController', 'tasks', $project['id'])): ?>\n            <li>\n                <?= $this->modal->medium('upload', t('Exports'), 'ExportController', 'tasks', array('project_id' => $project['id'])) ?>\n            </li>\n        <?php endif ?>\nOnce it's with the controller, it passes back to export/'.$action before the export.\nSo, theoretically, you could build your own custom controller to point to a template to grab the values before export.\n. You must be misunderstanding me. I'm telling you how to add columns to the csv.. just the plugin. \nbasically, you need to override the template dropdown.php, so that instead of calling the controller ExportController.php, you will call NewExportController.php (which is a copy of the original controller, modified to then call your own custom NewTaskExport.php, which will replace this: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/app/Export/TaskExport.php. There, you really only need to add a few lines of code, one to get the metadata for each task: $metadata = $this->taskMetadataModel->getAll($task_id); and then a foreach loop within the current foreach loop to enumerate through each key value. \n. it's one way it can be done with the tools that have been provided to us, and less of a workaround compared to the amount of effort I have already put into the plugin you are referring to ;p. Maybe we see it differently, but nothing needs to change with the current models in this scenario. Is it not being respeceted? Everything you are saying it should do in the first comment, it's doing.. The controller ExportController is passing the data to the template in app/Export/TaskExport.php, which is building the csv file....\n. Disclaimer: I develop beauty products for a living, I make no claims of actually knowing what I am talking about.. and as proof of concept, without going all the way, i exported all the metadata under one column as a test:\n\n. i can share this code, should help you. I'll commit it later tonight to the plugin we are working on.. > I\u2019ve seen the \u201ccommon\u201d function passing the $data to \u201cresponse\u201d object and not to the any rendered template.. I will check this, thank you.\nIt's passing it in the \"common\" function to the template here:\n\nand notice, how the $data is defined here, in \"common\":\n\nboth of which rely on the values passed, project_id, from and to. \nActually $this->$model->$method coming from the export task in dropdown.php is translated $this->taskExport->export Which is the Template.. Seems to me that, that would be the way it should work. Close a task = Notify, Open a Closed Task = Notify.\nI prefer to actually never be notified, so I turn it off, and use Automatic Actions to email me about things I care about. . Sounds cool, you developing it?\nhttps://docs.kanboard.org/en/latest/plugins/index.html. \nProbably because it is a .csv?\nThere is really no information here to assist you.\n. I've thought about this before, and would even like to keep a \"relates to\" link to the task it came from. I might be inclined to make this a plugin.. it's not hard to add your own api procedures. Here is an example where I added custom API procedures for Subtask Due Dates: https://github.com/eSkiSo/Subtaskdate\nKanboard gave you the basics, it's up to you to fine tune it to your needs. Happy to help if needed.. I drag the card itself just fine.\n. are you on a mobile device? The card clearly is in drag mode with the dotted lines showing where it is about to be dropped.\n. I don't have any issue with how it currently works, but also see your point, it wouldn't hurt if the initial click was noticeable that the drag had initiated. . The dotted lines show where it is about to drop. Don't think you needed three issues for all these, and my guess is your on a mobile device. Switch to desktop mode on mobile, and it might improve your experience.\n. Try it on desktop mode, then report back. You should find that the dotted lines will appear where you are dragging, regardless of how long that column is.. Also, I agree with you on the column headers, would be nice if they didn't scroll out of view.. . @emahuni @rafacamargo123 \nI get what he is saying now.\nwon't make a difference what version you use, he is right, it's by design. \nwould need to check if draggable-placeholder element is visible, and if not, maybe highlight the columns background color or something like that, to show which column it is being dragged to. . Gotcha, I've never been able reproduce that portion. Figured he meant, that it went in the wrong column because he couldn't see where it is going.. Content-type?. It's been awhile since I used that feature, but I think I remember that a free mail gun account only allowed one sender or something similar to that. I believe I setup a forwarding rule from that one account.. Disable your css plug in and try again. Likely culprit.. worth a shot. I cannot reproduce though.\n. 20000 is the magic number? Always wondered.. That's very vague. Try to reset their password from an administrator account.. https://github.com/woahbase/alpine-kanboard\nMaybe that helps. Not sure i'd call that a bug, but, you could run only the jobs you require every 15 mins, and the ones related to sending emails daily.I don't use the overdue task notifications, but if that's the one sending emails, you could also turn the email portion of that off, and then use an automatic action to notify of ovderdue task via email, and set that one to run daily and the other every 15mins.\n. better explanation:\nTurn off email notifications (a user can change these though, FYI):\n\nrun this every 15 mins ./cli notification:overdue-tasks\nsetup auto action to send email of impending due date (this is a plugin):\n\nrun task related crons every day, i think its ./cli trigger:tasks i could be wrong\n. I don't believe it would be too difficult to add what you want to my plugin...just not sure I'd want to make the effort. I don't need it, and doesn't look like you even use it.\nHow I would implement:\nI'd record each time an email is sent for each task, to each tasks metadata\nI'd add a compare before attempting to send an email, comparing the date in meta and current time, if less than 86400 seconds, its not gonna send the email. \nRe-record the date when it jumps over 86400 seconds. \nnow, no matter how many times your running cron a day, emails for each task will only send daily, but checking how ever often as you like.. the other key difference is that it will notify of \"Impending\" due date.\nI can put it on my todo list, but I am actively working on a few other projects. If you use it, though, you should \u2b50\ufe0f it, better chance that I do it \ud83d\ude1b , not like anyone is paying me for this, and stars make me feel special.. also, make the feature request on the plugin issue board. I need reminders.. test this branch, let me know if that works. I don't have a test server set up properly to test it at the moment...so you can be the guinea pig\nhttps://github.com/creecros/SendEmailCreator/tree/creecros-test. Never mind, I tested, works perfectly. Was easier that I thought it was going to be. I did not add the functionality to subtasks, because there is no subtask metadata and you didn't actually ask for that...if someone requests it, I might be obliged. you should still star the repo, If you use it, \u2b50\ufe0f it.. It emails both the assignee and creator...that's why you got two emails . It's in the project config, under \"Predefined Content\"\n\n. \nI see you're using Docker.\nSystem Services for Docker, require you to restart your container.\nIf anyone figures a way around that, let me know. Been dealing with that for years.. Other plugins may actually not be setup properly, the release files have to be:\n- zipped properly\n- correctly setup in Plugin.php\n- Title and Name in plugin.php and json must match.\n- Few other variables.\nI could find the previous issues related to this, but, needless to say, it actually takes work to make sure the update function works as intended. I would say, it should be documented better for developers.\nAs far as Docker goes, a simple \"Restart\" to the container is all thats required, you don't need to recreate the container.. is your application URL setup correctly with the https://\n\n. Personally, I would disagree with this. . Sorry, not meaning offense, just a point of view. \nMy point of view: Closed tasks are closed, so they should be hidden, by default.\n. I agree with choice. Just not as a default. I could go through a lot of reason as to why that would suck, \"for me\", but better to just say it would pose an issue. . probably simpler to just use the configModel.\nEdit: So long as default remains as is \ud83d\ude1d . @vincowl \nYou could use use the configModel and add a default filter option in the application settings. In template/config/application.php add:\nhtml\n    <fieldset>\n        <?= $this->form->label(t('Default Filter'), 'application_default_filter') ?>\n        <?= $this->form->text('application_default_filter', $values, $errors, array('placeholder=\"status:open\"')) ?>\n    </fieldset>\nin UserSession.php, change the return in getFilters to:\nphp\n            return session_get('user')['filter'] ?: $this->configModel->get('application_default_filter', 'status:open');\netc...using this, the default would remain status:open unless someone actually changes that value in the settings, thus, it won't break or change any behavior unless desired.\ncould easily be a extension without the need for a PR as well.. @vincowl From a plug in perspective, I don't think I've yet to not figure out how to do something...given enough time. I am not working on anything new atm, just maintaining my current repos, so happy to help if needed. . Think it depends on definition of a month. Most people would probably have your definition, I know I do. But, there are a few different definitions\n1.) 4 weeks is considered a month\n2.) 30 days is considered a month\n3.) From current day of month to concurrent day of the next month is considered a month.\nThe current case logic is add->dateInterval('P1M') which I believe is 30 days.. https://kanboard.discourse.group/t/combine-tags-on-filter/105\nsimilar, or related...same answer.. Everything worked fine for me.\nWhat Browser are you using?. https://projects.nachostudio.ml/\nadmin\nadmin\ntell me if you have the same issues here.. ",
    "lastlink": "@mapeze you should give feature requests for plugins directly on their git repos rather than here. https://github.com/creecros/group_assign/issues. @creecros plugin looks great. I think we need an additional assignees plugin similar to the 85 that will have a multiselect like box w/ no limit to users & separate from main assignee. This will avoid database breaks by having it separate.. @creecros I think the plugin I mentioned would solve this issue, the group assigned to task would not make this issue closed. I agree that the group plugin as well as the pull request would be good starters to develop the multi assigned user plugin in a separate text input field from owner. I don't have a pushing need for this right now. I may end up eventually developing it if somebody else doesn't.. how would you integrate users from kanboard w/ your wiki then? any integrations for that?. You can use the instructions here to simulate it. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9540990/using-chromes-element-inspector-in-print-preview-mode. \nI think I may look into a pull request on some good print parameters.\nYou can also use @tzeumer hack in the settigs custom css by pasting it in this format\ncss\n@media print {\n   @page {\n        orientation:landscape;\n        -webkit-transform: rotate(-90deg); \n        -moz-transform:rotate(-90deg);\n        filter:progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.BasicImage(rotation=3);\n    }\n    #board-container { overflow-x: initial !important; }\n    .board-task-list { min-height: 0 !important; }\n    .task-board      { page-break-inside: avoid; }\n}. I might also hide the menu's in the css\ncss\n@media print {\n  /*Hide menu */\n  .menu-inline, .project-header, .menus-container { display: none; }\n}. This is my final hiding menu's from printing. May still need work\n```css\n@media print {\n@page {\n        orientation:landscape;\n        -webkit-transform: rotate(-90deg); \n        -moz-transform:rotate(-90deg);\n        filter:progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.BasicImage(rotation=3);\n    }\n    #board-container { overflow-x: initial !important; }\n    .board-task-list { min-height: 0 !important; }\n    .task-board      { page-break-inside: avoid; }\n/Hide menu /\n  .menu-inline, .project-header, .page-header, .menus-container, .sidebar, .alert, .alert-info, .dropdown > ul  { display: none; }\n}\n``. Could this not be done as additional assignees and be a separate field from owner? This way it would not conflict with having to move users over.. Couldn't a plugin solve this issue? Just an example project plugin with only schema migrations or project model calls that insert a project. What would be a good name for this?. probably need to encode the html entities using html_entity_decode();\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/php/func_string_html_entity_decode.asp. @drrobalan @fguillot Any updates on this? Will some of this be a pull request for the picoDb vendor?  https://github.com/fguillot/picoDb. @fguillot \"What is the point of adding MSSQL support? this is not a free and open source software.\"\nmssql now works on linux & you can run a docker container to quickly launch a db server. https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/mssql-server-linux/.

I created a pull request. https://github.com/kanboard/website/pull/13. It didn't seem to work for sqlite.. Most projects I've worked on the project members assign the stories to themselves, so this is typically the most common behavior trying to take some of the micromanagement off of the project manager. Although the custom roles should allow for the changed behavior if they are working properly.. most of the other integrations are plugins, I think if you really want support just build out your own plugin for this. I don't think there are lot of users using this. Since there are 3 different plugins each for Github/Gitlab/BitBucket it should be easier to setup. The key thing is gitbucket oauth support &/or there rest api.. Would it not be possible to make changes to the ui w/out rerendering the page?. Probably b/c you have way more hardware and resources dedicated for it that most of us running on shared web hosts.. Is this still an issue? Seems that there were recent improvements to this with the compact view vs expanded. I noticed that you can drag individual tasks and it will attempt to change each one w/out doing a page refresh. The popup task edit modal is still slow though.. @fguillot I think this should be closed, this functionality doesn't need to be changed. Also @TWConsult  hasn't made any other comments. There should be a maximum amount of time before auto closing an issue if the submitter doesn't clarify what they need.. I think it was due to having bigboard plugin installed w/ 1.2.4.  After having to manually delete the plugin folder for this a bunch of things started working again.. My experience with these so far is that the plugin creator didn't properly update their compatible version. Usually using a >= will solve updates in software..getPluginVersionshouldn't have the >=, but thegetCompatibleVersion`\ngetPluginVersion needs to match the version on https://github.com/kanboard/website/blob/master/plugins.json otherwise it will keep asking to update.. Could you provide screenshots of your install plugins & install plugins page?. My getCompatibleVersion is this.\npublic function getCompatibleVersion()\n    {\n        return '>=1.0.37';\n    }. It does look to be specifically an issue w/ AutoSubtasks. I would create an issue w/ them specifically.\nhttps://github.com/creecros/AutoSubtasks/issues. Both plugins have their own issues, Comment Tooltip doesn't show a link to it's home page on the installed page. Also the reason why the version is off is that comment tooltip in the plugin.json has version \"0.0.1\"\n\"comment-tooltip\": {\n        \"title\": \"Comment Tooltip\",\n        \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\n        \"author\": \"Enrico Frigo\",\n        \"license\": \"MIT\",\n        \"description\": \"Show task's comments as tooltip as in older kanboard version.\",\n        \"homepage\": \"https://github.com/enricofrigo/kanboard/tree/master/plugin-comment-tooltip\",\n        \"readme\": \"https://github.com/enricofrigo/kanboard/blob/master/plugin-comment-tooltip/CommentTooltip/README.md\",\n        \"download\": \"https://github.com/enricofrigo/kanboard/raw/master/plugin-comment-tooltip/releases/download/v1.0.0/CommentTooltip.zip\",\n        \"remote_install\": true,\n        \"compatible_version\": \">=1.0.35\"\n    }\nBoth of them also don't have the\npublic function getCompatibleVersion()\ndeclared in Plugin.php\nAs for documentation, I remember it stating to just look at the examples. People are welcome to submit documentation updates.\n. How far along is your mobile app coming @dvor? Are you close to distribution? I created an issue for user testing distribution. You could compare it with taigios kanboard mobile app that is open sourced.. @fguillot what command are you using to build it? So I can test & fix it. Ok, I validated and fixed w/ the gulp css command thanks. Should build now.. @fguillot Ok, I've fixed and tested that the media print is working.\nI updated the gulp css build & default to accommodate the difference for print.\nI made the discovery in layout.php that the default for media app.min.css was 'screen'. So I had to separate the .min completely to use the media print.\n        <?= $this->asset->css('assets/css/print.min.css', true, 'print') ?>\n. These are starting to sound a lot like sprints that end after their period is over. Would it not be useful to have dates attached to the swimlanes themselves as an option? start & end date.. I use my tags for many other things and this will eventually make a super long tag list. What I have been doing is using the milestone plugin for sprints & treating a story as a sprint/milestone/epic and attaching other stories to it as internal links. The swim-lane option as sprints may be nicer. I ended up have 4 swim-lanes w/ my current setup, one for milestones, one for active swimlane, one for backlog swim-lane, & one for epics. I do connect things to other projects like a theme/program project. I don't like using tags for this purpose though, but then again it goes to preference.. you have to reset the database id increment. mysql & postgres have different ways to do it. If you really want that maybe you should just delete & reinstall kanboard. Maybe you have an extension in chrome causing a bug.. I don't think this is planned behavior maybe if you're using ldap. This probably could be changed via a plugin.. ",
    "tuxayo": "If someone wants to work on this, it seems that #3431 is a good base (needs migration for existing data + maybe rebasing). @fguillot Would it help if you gives us a snippet of JS that would add callbacks and logs in strategic places? Then we paste it in the console when we reproduce the issue. So we could get you logs of instances of the problem.\n. Does anyone else knowing the code know what we should log/check with the inspector when we get the issue?. Something strange that might eventually hopefully help (or just add confusion)\n- I cloned my problematic board\n- The test board still had the issue\n- I closed all the tasks in the finished column (more than 3/4 of all tasks)\n- The issue was gone\n- I removed the status:open filter\n- the issue was still gone in the test board.

I confirm that v1.2.6 (with 14d1411) seems to have resolved this issue! :tada:\nOn my instance, I have never triggered this issue again since upgrading to this version.. @AlgyTaylor Can this issue be closed?. Bonus:\n- after the last step of the test plan\n- grab task\n- move it over the other column\n- if you are lucky (doesn't happen on the second instance that I tested on) you might be able to reproduce #3625 \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31. can this issue be closed? @emahuni .

    "oliviermaridat": "I would suggest that #92 is one solution to implement this feature.\n. Thanks!\n. For your information, I am working on an implementation of this: https://github.com/oliviermaridat/kanboard/tree/link\nNowadays I can link 2 tasks together, and update this link. I am working on the removing. Then I will need to work on the management of link (like categories).\n. The \"link\" branch is progressing.\nNowadays,  it it possible to:\n- link 2 tasks together, and update / remove this link\n- manage different link labels for each project\nLinks are displayed in the task show page as below:\n\nLinks can be edited as below:\n\nAnd to edit link labels:\n\nI need to do some UI updates, check performance, and eventually display the number of links in the board view.\nAny comments will be really appreciated :-)\n. Thank you for your help! This is now fixed. I have also added Mysql and Postgres schemas, but I didn't test them yet (and actually, I won't be able to test Postgres).\nPlease, notice that there is no default links at the moment. Therefore, before to test this feature, you need to add links (e.g. Precedes / Follows, For milestone / Contains, Child of / Parent of, ...) in the project.\n. Ok, I have almost finished this feature implementation. I have added the number of links of each task in the board view:\n\nNow, I intend to made some tests and try to clean / clarify everything before to propose it as a pull request. (arf, the commit logs will be quite ugly...)\n. Good one, thank you! I may be out for a while due to holidays (oh yeah!), but I will fix these issues.\n. It should be fixed by now:\n- A task can't be linked to itself anymore\n- The \"array to string conversion\" error seems to be removed \n- I have added the duplication of links when a project or a task is duplicated. For a task duplication, the link label of the original project is used. Note that when editing the new duplicated task links, only the link labels of the current project are available (which is quite logical). Actually, this is similar to linking 2 tasks from 2 different projects: it works, but one project is always using the link labels of the other project. I don't know yet if this is a real issue.\n. I am currently preparing the pull request, so:\n- I have made some enhancement and clarification in the UI to show / edit links\n- it is not possible anymore to have duplication of links\n- I have added a French translation for the link feature\n- oliviermaridat/kanboard/master is now up to date with fguillot/kanboard/master (wow, loads of updates!).\n- I didn't test this for Postgres...\nIt seems fine for me now. I will do a final check this week and then send a pull request.\n. I don't know why, but in my fork the file \"composer.lock\" is not updated... This is quite strange.\nA \"composer update\" instead of a \"composer install\" hide the issue, because the composer.json file is up to date.\n. \"composer.lock\" problem is now solved.\nMy pull request will contain a lot of commit messages, but I don't know to handle that more properly. So I will send a PR and hope to be accepted, or to receive indications to clean this :-)\n. Thanks for this explanation poikilotherm. My fork history is too messy for that at the moment, but I will use it next time.\n. Thanks for your testing ashbike!\n1. Good idea! I will keep it like that at the moment, this is already a big PR.\n2. If I am not wrong, .fa-link was used for attached file. I like .fa-code-fork, it avoids confusion with hypertext links. But I am fine with .fa-link.\n. It is ok now. Apparently, I had an old version.\nThank you and sorry.\n. Thank you BlueTeck for sharing your ideas and demo! Your demo seems very promising.\nIn my opinion, a calendar view can be really useful for a project manager, or to work on the planning of a project. Having a such view directly in Kanboard can be quite useful (even more if it is coupled with a kant diagram). But it seems to me even more useful to be able to display this calendar outside of Kanboard (in Thunderbird, Google Calendar, or any other app) for interoperability purpose, using CalDAV for example. \n. Hi busla,\nActually, kanboard can already do that using automatic actions: Check the last example of the doc.\nA UI enhancement may provide a more user-friendly way to do this, but the feature is already there if you need it.\n. Thank you!\n. And I confirm that this is fixed!\n. I confirm that it is gone.\n. > Note: the master branch can be instable sometimes :)\nI know, but I assumed you may need some beta test ;-)\n. Hi,\nIt seems to be covered by the \"tags\" feature request: #262.\n. The possibility to turn a private project to a normal could be more than useful.\nIt is common to create a private project by mistake, to create numerous of tasks in it, and then to be stuck when it is time to add users in it \"frack, this is a private project!\". \n. Great! Thanks!\n. \"Or I need to attach a file, and I describe this file in a comment.\"\nIs it better? \n. Ok thanks! (In French there is this notion of \"pi\u00e8ce-jointe\" for \"attachment file\", so \"join\" seemed a good candidate ;-D)\n. Hi jasonmoofang,\nApparently, you missed the introduction of Composer in Kanboard. As explained in the doc, now you need to launch \"composer install\" in command line after a pull in order to install/update the vendor dependencies.\nNormally, the stable versions include directly the vendor folder. So, depending of your needs, you may also use the last stable version instead of \"pulling + composer installing\" Kanboard.\n. Hi,\nIt seems similar to #423.\n. Sorry for the high number of commits, I don't know (yet) how to handle that more properly.\n. Thank you very much for all your comments. I checked and checked my code, but apparently not enough. I will see that asap.\n\nWhy the links are specific per project, why not global to the application?\n\nI made them specific per project because I thought they may be different depending of business activities (online shops project will have different links than development project) like categories. So, not exactly like task colors in my opinion. \nBut for sure this add more complexity. This is your call, what do you prefer?\n. Normally I have fixed all the issues you spotted. But the PR will fail, because I am using my proposed PR for simpleValidator (not to force your hand of course, task link validation can be done differently in kanboard if you prefer). \nThis will give me the time to think about \"global links\" ;-) I am very open and I am ok to change whatever you want. I just want to do it the best possible way.\n. I am working in a different branch (oliviermaridat/kanboard/link) to make link labels global to all project. Actually, this doesn't change many things in the code, but it will clearly simplify the management for the end-user. Anyway, it will still be possible to add a \"link label\" for a specific project. This offers simplicity and specificity :-) But if you don't like \"specificity\", feel free to remove it.\nMy only regrets is that I can't add that properly to the Controller/Config (too much pages to create), so I keep it in Controller/Link even it is accessible through the application Settings page.\nI am also working on clarifying the \"link\" and \"link label\" data models. I was never completely satisfied with it, but I didn't find how to do that properly. I have a new idea, so I will try it. This may allow to have a bidirectional link (like \"relates to\" which doesn't have any \"inverse\" link).\nBy the way, I plan to add these link labels by default:\n- relates to\n- blocks by / is blocked by\n- duplicates / is duplicated by (I don't see the point to have \"clones / is cloned by\")\n- is a child of / is a parent of\n- targets milestone / is a milestone for\nWhat do you think? Is it enough? Do you need more/less?\nI will send a new PR when this will be done.\n. Hi Torsten-K,\nI don't know how it works exactly (and I will be glad to have some hints there ;-D), but a quick answer to \"make it work now\" is: update app.css.\nApparently, all CSS files are merged (but I don't know when nor how) in app.css.\n. Assigning a due date to a project seems very useful, but generally, one project can have several due dates (e.g. to target v1, v2, ...). So, a roadmap feature (#424) seems to fit better this objective.\n. Yes, using an asynchronous method seems to be a better solution.\nIf I understand well, you could use the popover \"method\" that is used to display Subtasks, descriptions, comments, etc, for each task on the board view.\n. In my first PR to answer this ticket, I remarked that the part about \"grouping\" task link by labels has been discard. If possible, I would like to discuss this point.\nAt the moment, to display task links, we have something similar to:\n\nBut I would rather prefer to have something like that:\n\nI find it cleaner and more readable. It is also easier to copy/paste a quick overview of a milestone (or any other link) to somewhere else (e.g. a Word/Openoffice report).\nI know that the UI is all about feelings. So I will completely agree if you disagree with this ^^ But, just to know if this is a disagreement on the feature, or on the way to implement it.\n. Seems great! :thumbsup:\n. @iPublicis Unfortunately, before PHP 5.6, \"const\" accepts only static scalar (number, string or other constant like true, false, null, FILE) (see http://php.net/manual/fr/language.constants.syntax.php).\nSo, this code will fail priori to PHP 5.6:\nconst TABLE = DB_TABLE_PREFIX . 'some_table_name';\nAnd yes, that is a pity.\n. Hum.. Someone has any idea about this unit test failure?\n```\n1) TaskLinkTest::testValidation\nIllegal offset type in isset or empty\n/home/travis/build/fguillot/kanboard/vendor/fguillot/simple-validator/src/SimpleValidator/Validators/Unique.php:25\n/home/travis/build/fguillot/kanboard/vendor/fguillot/simple-validator/src/SimpleValidator/Validator.php:23\n/home/travis/build/fguillot/kanboard/app/Model/TaskLink.php:226\n/home/travis/build/fguillot/kanboard/tests/units/TaskLinkTest.php:123\n```\nThis is passing on my computer, so maybe I am missing something, but I am don't know where.\n. Ah ok, I didn't see that simpleValidator/Unique was revert back to only accept one field. I removed this validation check.\n. FYI: I am working on a PR for this.\n. Hi @fguillot, if you intend to merge this PR but if you need something more (or less) to do it, please, don't hesitate to ask me.\n. task_id and opposite_task_id are used in a task link to specify the two linked tasks. E.g. task 1 blocks task 2 / task 2 is blocked by task 1.\nWhereas opposite_task_link_id is used to specify a relation between two task link tuples. Like \"opposite_id\" for link labels. Actually, this relation can be retrieved with the task_link.id, task_link.task_id and the task_link.opposite_task_id and links.id / links.opposite_id. But this involves a quite complex SQL request. Especially because link labels can be bidirectional (like \"related to\"). I tried that in my first PR but it was very complicated, and I suppose this is why you discarded it.\nThat is why I propose to add opposite_task_link_id, which is filled during the creation of the two task link tuples, but which is useful to update the opposite task link tuple. I thought it was easier to implement and to understand.\nTo be honest, I tried many data models for that, and it was at least the first that didn't involve complex SQL requests. It can for sure be done differently, and maybe better.\n. Thanks fguillot! I tested it, and it seems to work just fine.\nI really like the idea of having the same look and feel for links and subtasks in the task view. In the current implement they are completely different and I fear it is therefore quite confusing for the user. Do you think we can keep a column order similar to the subtasks one? Label, task, Column, Assignee, Time tracking, Actions\n. Actually, if the subtask table fits small screens, the link table should fit also. If it get too large because of the \"label\" column, this column can be moved to a row (which has one bonus advantage: a label row can even summarize the time tracking of its tasks, which can be really useful for the blocks / targets milestone labels).\nFor readability, and because the concepts of subtask and link are really similar, I would prefer to display similar tables for subtasks and links in the task view.\nAnyway, it is your project and your decision. I argue for the sake of the controversy, but please, do as your prefer :-)\n. Eh, that's great. Great for you, great for Kanboard, and I am sure, great for the company.\nThe more I use this feature, the more I like it.\n- I tried a quick hack for \"Override the calculated time spent with the value entered in the form\", and it is really feasible.\n- In the graphic, a column \"Estimated Expenses\" (computed from \"time_estimate\" values) can be useful to check if the proposed tasks are out of budget or not.\n. Hi noktork,\nNormally, if you start typing the title of one of your task in the field, you should see the dropdown list. Once a valid task has been selected, the \"Save\" button becomes clickable.\n\n. I had the same reaction. Make this field work with both a task number and a task title could be great (see #669).\n. On the board, if you click on a task number, you will see a dropdown list allowing you to edit the task (and its due date) on the fly. Good enough?\n. It is available in the master branch: iCal subscriptions\n. In the dashboard (Kanboard home), select \"Project Management\" and then \"Users overview\".\n. In the dashboard (Kanboard home), select \"Project Management\" and then \"Users overview\".\n. Thank you for your response @fguillot. Yep, Github's issue milestone system is indeed very nice and simple. I will be glad to see something that simple to use in Kanboard :sparkles:\nI would prefer to use the existing Kanboard data model instead of adding a new section for milestone. A task already have title, description and due date like Github's milestone, and it is already possible to link tasks together, especially with a \"is milestone\" link. In my opinion, adding a new \"milestone\" section will add too much complexity and increase the code size uselessly.\nI like the idea of adding a new page \"Add a milestone\" to create a new task with only title, description and due date (other fields are hidden). And also a link to add easily a task to an existing milestone. And of course, I would really like to have a \"roadmap\" view, and to be able to see milestones in the \"calendar\" view (and I am glad to hear about the \"Gantt\" view ;-D). This is possible with a little more work.\nMilestones can already be recognised from simple tasks thanks to their \"is a milestone of\" link, however we can simplify this by adding a new field \"is_milestone\" to task. As a bonus, this allows to display a quick list of available milestones when adding a task to a milestone (like in Github).\nIs it ok if I improve my PR with these proposals?\n.

Clearly, the actual spirit of Kanboard is in line with what you said @fguillot (which is logical, because you are the spirit of Kanboard): prefer a new data model  than specialising an existing one.\nIn am more in line with the proposal of @BlueTeck. For me \"milestone\" and \"subtask\" are specialised tasks and we can even add other specialised types in the future. This vision implies to also add specialised links (I did not want to spent too much time, so I used link 9 \"is a milestone of\" in my PR, but this is indeed no enough). I do not have enough comparison to say what is the best approach.\nAnyway, I like your ideas about milestone, progress bar, Gantt ... !\n.

I have a new idea to provide specific behaviours to a link: adding options to links. 2 or 3 options only may be required:\n- starts after\n- ends before\n- \"special list\"\nstarts after\nFor example \"starts after\". If the link \"is a milestone of / targets milestone\" has the option \"starts after\", all tasks linked with \"targets milestone\" to another task called M will have a \"started_date\" after the \"started_date\" of task M. The best is to add a new \"started_date_computed\" field to task (or something similar) that can be displayed in addition to \"started_date\" in calendar and Gantt views. \nends before\n\"ends before\" will have the same behaviour but with \"due_date\".\nends before\n\"special list\" (yes, this is not very explicit, better name required) will allows to implement the \"Milestone\" view presented in the first message of this discussion. A link with the \"special list\" option will be removed from the \"Task links\" view, but will have its own way of listing its linked tasks.\nConclusion: \"is a milestone of\" will have the options \"starts after\", \"ends before\" and \"special list\"; \"is blocked by\" will have the option \"starts after\" only.\nWe may imagine to add new options, for example to \"not display in boards\" (for \"is a parent of\" link).\n. Just a question: who / what are the parts in your example? Is it \"dev1\", ... ? These are the name of the developers?\n. Just a question: who / what are the parts in your example?

You can check the syntax for all filters here: http://kanboard.net/documentation/search\nAs far as I know, there is no \"Recently updated\" filter.

If you have any ideas...\nI made some tests to use the \"is blocked by\" link to modify \"Start date\" in the Gantt view. It was very useful, but the inheritance was still missing.\n. @dedesite This is not perfect (yet ;-D), but there is a Milestone plugin, which does not change the start/due dates of tasks, but use internal links to display more properly the Gantt chart.\nHelp and comments are welcome!. I suppose you must use the great Framaboard service? Yep, unfortunately it does not support plugins... Is it a prerequisite for you or your company?. I have written a script for this: https://github.com/oliviermaridat/kanboard-sqlite2mysql. With a the Kanboard version of April 20116 it was working very well. It should still work, try it and let me know if you have any issue (not there but directly in the kanboard-sqlite2mysql script).\nThe only difficult part is when database column names are changed because SQLite does not allow to remove the previous column, therefore, we have to add these old column name to the new MySQL database, before to import the SQLite database in it.\nIf some column names have been changed since April, the script will not work properly. But the logs may tell you the issue and the fix to apply on the script.\n. Thanks for your reply @fguillot!\nI did not see yet how to move the GanttFormatter instantiation into a service provider. Anyway, I think an other solution may be to add a reference hook in TaskGanttFormatter::formatTask before to return the task data. Something like:\n```\n  private function formatTask(array $task)\n    {\n        if (! isset($this->columns[$task['project_id']])) {\n            $this->columns[$task['project_id']] = $this->columnModel->getList($task['project_id']);\n        }\n    $start = $task['date_started'] ?: time();\n    $end = $task['date_due'] ?: $start;\n\n    $data = array(\n        'type' => 'task',\n        'id' => $task['id'],\n        'title' => $task['title'],\n        //...\n    );\n\n    $this->hook->reference('formatter:task:gantt:task', $data);\n    return $data;\n}\n\n```\nCan you confirm? Do you have any preference between these 2 solutions?\nThanks!. Thank you @fguillot ! As you may have seen, I merged my patch in the Milestone plugin. I had to override completely the GanttTaskFormatter due to \"private\" methods, which may increase the risk of conflict between plugins, but at least, this is working.. Bonjour @Tony49,\nNormalement \"is a milestone of\" fait partie des libell\u00e9s cr\u00e9\u00e9s automatiquement. Il est normalement traduit en fran\u00e7ais par \"est une \u00e9tape importante incluant\" (ce qui est un peu pourri, admettons-le. Il existe un plugin pour modifier les traductions si besoin.). L'erreur qui appara\u00eet quand tu essais de re-cr\u00e9er \"is a milestone\" montre bien que ce dernier existe. Donc utilise plutot \"est une \u00e9tape importante incluant\".. That's a good idea!. To earn this kind of topics, Kanboad must really have reached a new step! Congratulations @fguillot , your \"minimalist\" project is going really well! For what it worth, I think you have always been wiser than anyone could expect in terms of architecture and features. If you doubt it: you can trust yourself. And nobody has never been forced to install the last version ;-)\nPlease guys, if you really like Kanboard, may I suggest than you propose something that fits your needs and the needs fixed by the new look?\n. Build is only not passing for PHP 5.3 DB=mysql... The job was more than 90% but then \"The job exceeded the maximum time limit for jobs, and has been terminated.\".\nTherefore, this is not a build failed but a build timeout issue.. I checked with ini_get(allow_url_fopen) and it is set to \"1\" (i.e. ON) on my configuration. So this is not the same issue for me...\nI manage to read some logs, and I have a \"[error] HttpClient: request failed\".\nNothing more yet.... By the way, I confirm that it also prevents from login using Google!\nThis is indeed probably related to the usage of fopen (see code of app/Core/Http/Client.php in doRequest), but allow_url_fopen=1 alone may be not enough. My provider may have changed something in my server configuration...\n```php\n$startTime = microtime(true);\n        $stream = @fopen(trim($url), 'r', false, stream_context_create($this->getContext($method, $content, $headers)));\n        $response = '';\n    if (is_resource($stream)) {\n        $response = stream_get_contents($stream);\n    } else {\n        $this->logger->error('HttpClient: request failed');\n    }\n\n```\n. Addind new Validators\\Required('date_due', t('The due date is required')), in two functions of TaskValidator.php is working like a charm.\n```php\npublic function validateCreation(array $values)\n    {\n        $rules = array(\n            new Validators\\Required('project_id', t('The project is required')),\n            new Validators\\Required('title', t('The title is required')),\n            new Validators\\Required('date_due', t('The due date is required')),\n        );\n    $v = new Validator($values, array_merge($rules, $this->commonValidationRules()));\n\n    return array(\n        $v->execute(),\n        $v->getErrors()\n    );\n}\n\n// ...\n    public function validateModification(array $values)\n    {\n        $rules = array(\n            new Validators\\Required('id', t('The id is required')),\n            new Validators\\Required('title', t('The title is required')),\n            new Validators\\Required('date_due', t('The due date is required')),\n        );\n    $v = new Validator($values, array_merge($rules, $this->commonValidationRules()));\n\n    return array(\n        $v->execute(),\n        $v->getErrors()\n    );\n}\n\n```\n. This doc \"Running tests\" may help to understand the test architecture.. Nice idea!\nA kind of \"plugin-github-webhook\" or \"plugin-gitlab-webhook\" but for Kanboard could be a solution for this.. I think that the \"Inactive swimlane\" feature was done for this purpose. \nMaybe you should use an active swimlane for your long-term backlog.. ",

    "ashbike": "Nice :+1: . Just checked out and it is working fine. Doing more testing.\nJust two small points (feel free to ignore :smile: )\n1. How about adding a menu item on the tasks on board? Like the screenshot below.\n2. Wouldn't FontAwesome .fa-link be more appropriate as icon than .fa-code-fork? Like the screenshot. \n\nI was playing with the task menu... this line around line # 49 app/Template/Board/task.php creates the menu item.\n<li><i class=\"fa fa-link\"></i> <?= $this->a(t('Add a link'), 'tasklink', 'create', array('task_id' => $task['id'], 'project_id' => $task['project_id'])) ?></li>\n. It does. You see an error while importing?\n. May be we can differentiate in this way:\n- Category : Just the way it is. System defined values. One can only select from what is available.\n- Tags/Labels : User defined. Somewhat Free form. Multiple values. \n. :+1: \n. :+1:  I was not able to find it at first glance. Actually, I saw this menu for the first time. It's handy. Just to help others:\n\n. Shortcut is already there. 's' \n. - Works on Windows 7 + Chrome Version 41.0.2272.118 m. \n- Does not work on Windows 7 + Firefox 37.0.1\n. Can this be achieved in this way? http://codepen.io/ashbike/pen/gbxwvz . \nClicking on the Swimlane name toggles all items under it. This just hides/shows items, no fancy stuff like ajax loading etc. Just JQuery.\n. The +/- icon part is simple. http://codepen.io/ashbike/pen/JoyRQy. Also, those icons can be absent for an empty swimlane. I will try the column part. That is bit complicated I think.\n. Created a quick prototype on my 'swimlane' branch https://github.com/ashbike/kanboard/commits/swimlane . Also, set up a demo server to try out at http://goo.gl/Y5PrgO .\nOne can show/hide swimlanes and hidden states are maintained across logins. If a swimlane does not have any task under it, then show/hide icons are not shown. \nI tried to create a quick prototype and majority of it is in JS which I'm not very familiar with. For now, i put the whole JS code in app.js (just to make my life easy). However, it should be organized.\nAny help towards organizing this JS code will be appreciated. It has some utility functions and two events (Ready & Ajaxcomplete). Take a look towards the end of app.js.\nColumn show/hide is bit complicated as it appears, so not focusing on it right now. \n. @BlueTeck Basically you moved the swimlane name to the same row as column names in case of hidden. What I did is, moved the swimlane name to the columns row. Now the row is much thinner if hidden. Also reduced icon sizes to normal font size and made them circular. I updated the demo. http://goo.gl/Y5PrgO \nI already figured out that the css/js sources reside in their corresponding src folders. What I wanted to know, how do I put the JS inside, say board.js. I'm sorry, but I'm just a beginer in JS and not sure where to put that code in. Just putting right under Kanboard.Board = (function()... would work? \n. Collapsible swimlane has been merged. \n. Will resend this pull request.\n. I see it fails again. NOt sure what's causing this. Any help will be appreciated. Also, I'm not very familiar with Git, hence landed up with multiple commits. \n. Hi @fguillot, I see that markdown is gone after changes. But I guess that should be there since you already have the markdown processor. How about this?\n1. In the Board Edit page, the table shows all boards, name, description etc. Instead of description, we will show the description icon there. Hovering on the icon one can see the description.\n2. The edit column will have the markdown capability with preview.\n3. Back to the board, one can hover on the column name and get the formatted description. However, I would like to have a small indicator there showing description is available. Otherwise user will not know about it. And all the columns might not have description, user will only know after pointing to it.\nLet me know your thoughts.\n. Thanks. It works.\n. Gets a merge conflict in app.css. However, building it from sources should be fine. Will ignore app.js and app.css now on.\n. :+1: :+1: \n. I think closing subtasks is better option. An warning message can be displayed saying all subtasks will be closed while parent task is closed (only if open subtasks exist). \n. Not sure. But, it got to be platform agnostic. I was thinking about php only, may be Java? Other option could be python but I'm not very familiar with it.\n. Let's start with PHP and then we will see. I will try to prototype 2-3 commands to start with.\n. Just noticed an odd behaviour. I am running under XAMPP. When Kanboard resides right under webroot, IE shows this error. Else it works fine. For example:\nhttp://localhost/ shows this error on IE \nhttp://localhost/kanboard works fine on IE \nFF & Chrome do not have this problem.\n. :+1:  :+1: \n. Was thinking about that. How about <1h, NNh if less than <24, and finally days?\n. :+1: That's what I was looking for. New to PHP. Any advice which file this function will go into? Then I will make changes and send another pull request.\n. Don't know why some work in progress got into it... closing and creating a new pull request.\n. @crash5 Correct. I don't know from where this \"new\" came in :). Fixed and created a separate pull request.\n. Just tried out the new release. Works good with custom styles. :+1: \n. I think it's just went missing unintentionally due to refactoring the Board for collapse/expand tasks feature. 'time spent on column' and 'complexity' was coexisting earlier.\n. Just a thought. Since there will be only one category, the complexity can come before it. (red circle). Or the time spent stuff can move to the footer (blue arrow) and complexity can come there. My monitor is 1366x768px and I put 9 columns to see how it comes along. It looks good!\n\n. :+1: \n. EDIT: After removing one column, the scrollbar vanished and it fits in nicely. So I think there is some logic in it. \nAfter playing with it a bit, somehow I'm not getting very comfortable with the horizontal scroll. I understand that too many columns can not fit into an window. At the same time, looking at the whole board has it's value. \nMay be a configuration option per user or global? Something like, show scrollbar if columns > 10. \n. Nice. :+1: \n. That's right. Category link should be there. \n. Sorry, I forgot the mandatory-on-dev-branch 'composer install'... After updating picodb and simple-validator they are showing up. \n. Very nice. :+1: \n. We are also having the same problem, not being able to have the complete view. I created a small patch for this (but I do think it could be done with much less code, thus cleanly) and submitted a pull request. It basically toggles between this new and old behaviour. \n. It's global as of now. But that should not be a problem since just hitting 'c' you can toggle (or from board 'Actions' menu). \n. I have a setup running on our test server http://goo.gl/PJD5pr. Check 'Test Project 1'\n. That's right. best part of Kanboard is, it's simple. Another menu item/hot key will definitely add functionality, but also makes it one level geeky :smile: .\n. By default it's horizontal scroll.\n. We connect to non-local mysql. It works fine.\n. @oparoz you mean serialize the tag array as json and then store? Most tagging input libraries take comma delimited tags, that's why i kept it csv.\n@BlueTeck Yes, filter/search should be there. But, I didn't implement it since I do not know it's future :smiley: . \nAbout the category, well, it may be redundant unless you want to have some system defined values.\n. - I think LIKE will not be a problem practically since number of rows will not be that high. For example, I just tried a count(*) with a like match of 3 words in 5 words scenario on 520,000 rows and 1,200,000 rows on my desktop mysql (default xampp installation) and get .450ms and 1.1s respectively. without LIKE it was .150 and .400ms. \n- Tag labels can be anything. Except perhaps a few delimiters like , ; | etc.\n- These colors are defined in css for now. It's a set of defined css classes like: .color-. However they can be made like github. Right now there is no tag management as such. You type and you have a tag. I didn't like the tag colors much since there is already a color associated with a task.\nThe other option may be, make the category a multiple choice. That may simplify everything.\n. @fguillot\nYes. I actually removed that possibility by doing LIKE ',mytag,' . \nFor autocompletion: I concatenated tag columns and then did a word count. (str_word_count()... in php space). That gives me an Associative Array with tag names in index and number of occurrence in values. So, I can use named keys for autocompletion, and the whole array to show how many tasks under each tag.\nI actually started off with # 2 but the queries got very complex and I had to create views and all. (Perhaps others can simplify it) . \n. @fguillot I sent a pull request.\n. :smile: I am asking the same question to myself. Why I didn't do that? \n. Created another pull request [ #668 ]  with changes suggested.\n. This is useful for bulk operations too. Like category/color change.\n. This certainly makes it more usable. However, an item is not closed if put on done (well, theoretically). Also, Done is just a name of that column and for example, we have something called \"Deployed\". And it varies from board to board making it more complex. Instead, how about showing the column name in My Tasks? Or any other thoughts?\n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. Problem is, nobody else will be able to see it since it's encrypted with your password. It will sort of become a personal note. Is that what you want? \n. This has got some problem which messes up dragging tasks. Will fix and test more.\n. :+1:  Though slightly off-topic, it appears Aaron Seigo (Core KDE contributor) find Kanboard 'a must-have tool' http://goo.gl/YU0Xsk and like the way it does things. \n. I can confirm the latest release 1.0.16 and the current Git version works fine. Just tested them.\n. Not sure, perhaps something wrong with Gitlab?\nThis works just fine and asks for authorization:\n```\nhttps://my.gitlab.host/oauth/authorize?client_id=XXXXXX&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A81%2Ftest&response_type=code\n Redirect URI: http://localhost:81/test. Or redirect URI: http://localhost:81/test/a=b works as well \n```\nBut, not this. It shows that invalid URI message.\n```\nhttps://my.gitlab.host/oauth/authorize?client_id=XXXXXX&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A81%2Ftest%3Fa%3Db&response_type=code\n*** Redirect URI: http://localhost:81/test?a=b\n```\nIt seems it does not like that ? separator. \nRunning against locally hosted Gitlab 7.14.1.\n. Removing the query string will not work with Kanboard since it doesn't know what to do after redirection. This is essentially a Gitlab problem, and if we want to fix it, it will just be an ugly hack. Hope Gitlab fixes it.\n. I don't understand french, so I used Google Translator :smiley: \nWhat I understand is, it's taking too much time in sending emails. This is a problem I saw earlier when we used SMTP to send email. It slows down board depending upon number of notifications, time to reach SMTP server etc. We do not have fast Internet connection.\nThe workaround for me was, use simple 'mail' [ define('MAIL_TRANSPORT', 'mail'); ]. I was using a Linux server so installed Postfix and configured it to send using our main SMTP server. This handled this problem nicely by immediately queuing up all the mails as Kanboard sent, then asynchronously processed them through our main SMTP server. Basically acting as a  superfast mail relay. That solved out problem.\nNot sure if this helps you, you may have to setup Postfix etc, but that's really simple. There are plenty tutorials available for this. Once done, Kanboard is very responsive.\n. :+1: \n. ",

Had the same issue. Can recommend swimlanes for this issue, as long as it is sufficient / you can accept having the same columns for all projects that are represented on the board. \n. With 1 0 1 3 - the \"Assign a color when the task is moved to a specific column\" complies with this FR. \nWith all the FR's currently open - I'll assist @fguillot  cleaning up by closing this one.\nTnx for implementing.\n. * + 1* (not a huge issue the way it is, but would be alot less scrolling with the suggestion) - we have 37 swimlanes in one board - and some boards might end up having even more. :)\n. Found a decent workaround for this one by changing my work-flow a tiny bit - I click the scroll button on the mouse to open a new tab with the ticket/task I want to edit - that way, the tab with my whole board and all the swimlanes does not reload. =)\n. IMHO, this would make KB less user friendly.\n. Haven't checked the Trello-functionality. Since the titles of the columns are repeated with swimlanes --> If I can't see the titles above, I'll just scroll down to see the next repeat below. How many tasks do you gave stacked in a single column in your board? Is this board swimlaned or not? (if not swimlaned this can be recommended, since you would then have titles below also) \n. Sqlite\n. Closing (duplicate)\n. tnx\n. That's cool!\n. - I fully recognize the \"crowded\" card situation.\n- Some sort of filter function would perform just as well as an indicator on the card itself.\nI'm no coder, but a \"drag bar\" for filtering values within a range - like Price, eg: \n$ 0\n<--------------------||||LOW|||---------------------------------|||HIGH||||------------->\n                                                                                                      $ 100\nwould perhaps do the trick - but I do not know how to implement.\n. :+1:\nOur monitors run 1920 x 1080 - we have established a practical limit of MAX 12 columns.\n. Here example w/ 1920 x 1080.\n- Really can't get comfortable with the forced horizontal scroll\n- Previous setup was better, IMHO.\nExample - we have a board listing months of the year for showing interdepartmental events/meetings and who's responsible for making the nececcary arrangements:\n\n. @ashbike:\n- Does it discriminate / toggle for each Project or does it toggle globally for all projects?\n  (the first would perhaps be of preference?)\nExample - from our use: \nI see maybe one-out-of-twenty something Projects where we could use the scroll feature (process with a ridiculous amount of steps)\nAll of our other Projects work great with the \"old behaviour\".\n. - Checked it out.\n- Worked great. :+1:\n- Personally I could live happily with this solution.\n- However, my concerns, and thus wishes to \"predetermine\" / child-proof the board behaviour a little bit - is in order to take considerations for some of our weaker users. \n- A few of our users can not be entitled as \"computer whizzes\". Though willing and eager to learn / contribute, the bar should not be raised too high (at least not all at once).\n- So far, KB is a real success in terms of UI / intuitive interaction.\nEDIT: I think I could trick them into learing that 'c' will lock the column size... so the solution looks good.\n. What is set as the default? \nHorizontal scroll or \"compact / locked column mode\"?\n. Just me thinking it should be the other way around?\nThat is: Compact mode as default, horizontal scroll to be activated by 'c'.\n(Just trying to consider 'what mode is used most often')\n. This is preserved in 1 0 1 3 - both with hotkey and as menu item - closing this one.\nTnx @fguillot for implementing.\n. > Categories are there, so I don't want to remove this feature, it's actually used by people.\nVery much so. :pray:\n:+1: tags, but as complementary.\n. Perhaps auto-suggest based on previously entered tags in the Project?\n\n. Documentation of upgrade here:\nhttp://kanboard.net/documentation/update\n. Tnx. =)\n. Tested With IE v 11.0.96 and that works just fine. I can live With that.\nSo - information for those affected - IE < v 11 (?) - compact mode will not work\n. @Sorasma \nHow about this as a solution: \n- Create two projects in KB. \n- One internal board, for users you trust, and one external board - where you allow users you don't trust / don't wish to see everything.\n- Don't use \"Allow all users\" on any of the projects - select those users who should have access one-by-one for all projects. \n- Don't activate public access on any of the projects.\n  That way, you stay in control of what information is available to whom.\n- If information security is still an issue, run the internal projects / boards on a dedicated local webserver with no external access.\n- KB has good documentation - reading up on the docs and testing it out in terms of features and capabilities before implementing and going \"live\" is a natual thing to do, so the original post seems a bit odd.\n. @dvr123 : Recognize the request - we're basically same number of users and implemented at about the same time as you describe. \nOur \"workaround\" for this:\n1. Add all the sub-tasks \n2. Then open them as separate tabs by clicking the scroll-button on the mouse \n3. Visit each tab and assign user, estimate time\nIt's not perfect, but it's more efficient than editing them one at a time as you input new subtasks.\n. Click the link with scroll-wheel = opens in new tab?\n. (1) --> Kanboard also has this filter - see screenshot below\n(2) --> Kanboard can filter out a users tasks, and then you see only the tasks assigned to this user\n(3) --> Can also sort by category (and color can be assigned through \"Automatic actions\" to specific categories)\n\n- Reading the docs and trying it out recommended.\n. +1\n. Can wait for next release. =)\n. Windows.\nFirefox 40.0.3\n. Same result with IE v 11.0.96\n. - Agree with @lbtw - I now have to do more scrolling - and the majority of the swimlane is blank space.\n- This alters the user experience.\n- Personally I enjoyed the board more when it  automatically \"contracted\" the height according to the size of the tasks in the swimlane \n- Especially swimlanes that are currently empty, or only contains one or two tasks in height take up a lot of screenspace\n. +1 for making it a setting, since keeping fixed height appears to be the direction.\nHaving issues getting accustomed with the fixed height - especially for boards with many swimlanes.\n. Thank you.\nTested - feels like home again. \n=)\n. Duplicate of #1153 - same issue\n. @mtruijen - suggestion: write the name of \"Requestor / Customer\" as the first word in the name of the task? - hence visible on the card? (searching for the customer will then list the tasks)\nIf not according to wishes or insufficient for the use case - and if treated by @fguillot  as a feature request - this perhaps brings us back to the discussions/suggestion of a custom field / tags  - ref #262, #646, #998 \n. - If you click down the scroll-wheel on the mouse, you can scroll to the right / left - without having to go all the way to the bottom to locate the horizontal scroll bar. \n. @BlueTeck \n- Personally I could live with defining the swimlane along with the task, but I'm more concerned for our users that are used to / \"trained\" to the having the \"+\" button closeby when they are viewing a swimlane... I don't wish to create confusion and frustration by changing their workflow. I recognize that this one isn't a leap, but it is still a change in how it has been working up until now. I believe the majority use the \"+\" sign when creating new tasks, based on what I've observed.\n- Still an issue with the column titles coming out of view when scrolling down. Floating column titles sound weird at first thought - or is that just me(?)\nSIDE-NOTE\n- The potential in a custom field / tag possibility - ref #262 , #646, #998  - would probably eradicate the need for so many swimlanes in some of our boards... (some boards have 30+ swimlanes, currently no way around that with our use case at the moment)\n. @fguillot \nDescription of use case:\n- Tasks on board organized by and possible to sort by the following dimensions:\n- User/assignee responsible - (a given duh!)\n- Category - determines the type of / nature of the task - \ncategories are typically across all \"global\" / interdepartmental boards as follows - and I'm paraphrasing here to express their intention and avoid abbreviations: \n- CATEGORY -  administrative (blah blah blah, paperwork, managerial domain) \n- CATEGORY -  planned work/operations (things you are supposed to be doing/working on)\n- CATEGORY -  interruption/failure (a.k.a. \"Oh, Shit\", mobilize and fix it - depending on how important it is) \n- CATEGORY -  MOM system (software, use what you've learned to prevent the same thing from happening again) \n- CATEGORY -  reported deviation/unwanted incident (computer says someone else say'd you have to fix this, HSE related)\n- We use Complexity to describe the priority of the task. \n  A \"1\" task is of highest priority, a \"2\" task is of lesser priority .... and so on for the (limited) range we use. Since complexity is viewed on the task card, it is easy to get a feel for what's important and what can wait when seeing the front of the cards. If you see a \"4\", then you know it's not that in a hurry to get fixed, some \"5\"s probably fall into the \"won't fix\" territory (if the world was perfect and you had unlimited resources you would fix it, but it ain't and you don't - so tough luck).\n- The swimlanes are currently being used to gather all tasks that relate to a single objects or asset. Example - all tasks related to factory # 1 is put in the swimlane \"Factory # 1 - (facility name)\" \n- When you need the overview of what to deal with next for that site/asset, you can just review the swimlane.\n- If tags were available, one could for example easily filter out all open tasks of category \"Oh shit\" for \"Factory # 1\".\n- In this way, tags would allow us to keep both the type of task (category) and also the asset/object dimension in the filtering - and we could remove many of the swimlanes without mixing it all / losing control of what related to what when you drill down with filters.\n- Some of our users have complained that so many swimlanes make the board large and hard to manage. They'd rather have an (asset/object) \"tag\" dimension to work with. (we actually did a survey on it) But mixing all the tasks together - (between all the \"factories\") - would create utter chaos on the board, so we need to keep tasks relating to different objects/assets separated - and that is where the tag feature comes in.\n- Hope this describes the use case in sufficient degree to make it understandable.\n- We are very grateful for the toggle - removing fixed height - ref #1159 - as people were about to be wearing out their scroll-wheels to move around. Now back in \"compact\" feel and only see what you've filtered out without the surrounding empty space.\n. - You can duplicate the project where you've defined the actions that you want. (Settings --> Duplicate)\n\n. - Sorry to hear of your loss of data.\n- You do get a warning - ref screeshot below - and if you've reviewed \"Completed tasks\" (in previous versions) or the \"List\" (in v 1 0 1 8) - with closed tasks, you know that the closed tasks are associated with the column they were in when they were closed.\n- If re-structuring an important board, perhaps a backup of the '\\data' folder beforehand is appropriate.\n- The user also has a responsibility in terms of behaviour / action approach - universal for all software use.\n- As a counter-measure for similar situations, we created a \"Sandbox\" board, so users / admins could check the consequences of their changes before applying it on the real board.\n  \n. Yeah, didn't catch. :)\n. EDIT :) : @robvoi - this Github issues list is the current list / only list  - sometimes when a version is released, it's commented with the news on Kanboard.net what will be focused on for next version. Except from that, FGuillot makes the priorities on what features to include and not. The up-side with one dedicated owner / main developer for the main version is that nothing radical happens and  things are kept close and on track. Downside is that the user-base has to show a little patience with certain features.\n. Suggestion - perhaps something like this?\nD = Days\nW = Weeks\nM = Months\nQ = Quarters\nY = Years\n- Default (D, W, M, Q, Y) for the Gantt view for the project can be chosen under \"Project settings\"\n- By default, the date range is shown based on the configured start and end date of the project, but can be manually entered by inputting dates and clicking \"zoom\"?\n\n. @mrajwadk  / @Lumin0s : fyi - reason for converting to lower caps --> see #578 \n. Confirmed.\n- With \"Set maximum column height\" active = not an issue, work fine moving tasks between columns\n- With \"Remove maximum column height\" active = issue is present, have to move task close to column title to make it \"catch\"\n. No special notification / mail setup on this instance.\n- Turns out - it's a hitbox issue in the menu - clicking the icon or just outside the text doesn't initiate the action - have to hit the text exactly to get the action.\n. Removing my comments as issue I encountered in #1380 was different and reason for it is discovered\n. ref #1142 (for background)\n- Icon meant as \"Move icon\"\n. - I reverted back to 1.0.16 for the (personal) instance that I use with a tablet.\n- The tablet browser (Firefox, Android) triggered the \"Move Icon\" - and I tried, but didn't get used to it. \n- With 1.0.16 it behaves like \"normal\" when moving the cards around, even on the tablet\n. :+1:\n. similar / related to #1437 (?) \n- also, guess you already seen the following based on what you say about friendly URLs:\n  https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/0e233673e32ffff50dd9392fb3c371a9fff8bf0a/doc/nice-urls.markdown\n. Related / same observation as #1381 \n. @Povezi -> you can change what shows up at the main board activity list by editing /app/Controller/app.php\nWe keep it at 200.\n\n. :thumbsup:\n. Public utilities, engineering, operations and maintenance.\n. @Busfreak \n Tnx for the feedback.\n I tested on 1.0.4.1, but was not able to reproduce it there.\n* Sticking with 1.0.3.5 for now - since I'm happy with it + it's the version running on our production server.. Closing this one since problem doesn't appear in later versions / not able to reproduce in 1.0.4.1. ",
    "SeAlgoAsoma": "The software would be simpler if it had a priority field. You made this system it much more complicated by leaving that out. What you're saying here is like refusing to include task titles, descriptions or deadlines and claiming that you're keeping the system \"simple\" by leaving fundamental things out. If you make your users jump through complicated hoops to do simple things, you're making it more complicated, not simpler. If you add a priority field, rather than make us jump through all kinds of craziness to create a priority scheme, that would make kanboard much simpler. Right now it is too complicated to use because of having to figure out how to do this without a field. \n. Where? I can't find it.\n. Oh, hold it, I guess that's a recent update. Looks like I'm at 1.0.23.\n. Ok. Upgrading was really, really, really bad advice. Like, never tell anyone to do that again. I had at least figured out a way to get it usable. Now I have nothing. The new version is totally broken. White screen. Error log says it's looking for files that are missing. This was a pain, sure, but now it's a complete disaster. \nSeriously. Never tell people they should update. I was minutes away from having it at least usable, and you just hosed me completely.\n. Yes, I need this too. Not being able to see at least a line or two of the description under the title in Board or List views (without having to click or hover to see them one by one) is a big problem, it would be much more productive if I could have details at a glance.\n. Yeah, that approach has its own drawbacks. I had wanted my clients' employees to be able to assign tasks to each other too, it's not just for my own use. \nAs it turns out though, as I posted elsewhere, mailgun intentionally strips all useful information from the emails I'm forwarding, tasks can't be forwarded through Mailgun unless you retype them by hand anyway, making this entire app and all the months I've spent trying to get it working in a usable manner a total loss for me.\n.

IMHO it's helpful to explain my usecase:\nI'm using KB as a personal kanboard using a single board for work-related tasks as well as private ones and some hobby stuff. I separate these tasks using categories like 'work', 'private', 'hobby' and so on.\nWhen at work, I filter for the category 'work' and start working on the items.\nThe thing is, I can work from home and vice versa. When I already filtered for 'work' and then apply a filter the category 'private', I want only private tasks to be visible so I can decide what to do next.\nI guess one could say that I'm using the categories in a GTD \"context\" way...\n. Thank you, that helps.\nFor the time being, I'll use a local patch I created that reverts to the old behaviour... Should that patch stop working, I'll use the custom filters instead.\n. Yeah, that kinda works, but it overwrites the initial \"status:open\", leading to the display of all closed items.\nI also miss the \"all categories\" filter, but at least I can recreate it using the custom filters.\n.

We end up with lists based on priorities in our PIM suites and it's simply not the best way to manage things.\nAnother solution would be to turn the JS part of Kanban into a Thunderbird extension.\n. Some inspiration perhaps, although they manage issues rather than sync them\nhttps://github.com/rauhryan/huboard\n. That would be great indeed. Some people don't want tot have to login every time they want to update a task they've just received a notification about or to reply to comments.\nA first step could be to do it via a pipe as it's easier than to have to connect to an external email account.\nSeveral projects do it this way. The pipe calls a parser which feeds the commands to the system.\n. IMHO, it's great to be able to do things via email commands and it's not that hard to implement if you have some documentation to go along with it.\nLike what TheBugGenie is doing\nhttp://issues.thebuggenie.com/wiki/TheBugGenie%3AIncomingEmail\n. I agree.\nWe already have private boards, next we need private tasks, then comments.\nBut it's all dependant on the ACL work being currently undertaken. Once we can define groups like developers or managers, then things should get easier.\n. I think that could work as a first step. There could be a switch somewhere in the user management area of a project to make sure the high level view is all they can get.\n.

It's the location Kanboard stores uploaded files as well as the sqlite database\n. I agree, but where did you see that it was broken? I've just looked at a test setup and the STS field shows one value, the one set in our Apache config.\n. Silly me, I was accessing the test site over HTTP. I can confirm the double headers on Firefox.\nSo, good news about being able to disable it in the next release :)\n. Update, I see 2 headers in Chrome\n. On Apache, it was due to a misconfiguration. We were using header add. Maybe there is something similar on NGINX?\n. Never mind, I was seeing a message after log in, saying that the user didn't have access to the page and I assumed it was because the user did not have access to his assigned project, but that's not what happened. The bookmarked URL was one for the admin.\nI've just performed various tests and everything worked as expected.\nSorry!\n. That's great news, but this is not what this ticket is about.

WebDAV would be nice or Owncloud support if there is an API.\n. Swimlanes would work for me. I like the specs defined by @poikilotherm. I would save the configuration per board and per user though. That way I could quickly see who's doing what and how much progress has been done by each team member without changing the view for everybody else.\nI also like the releases idea, together with epics, they could be used to group swimlanes per example.\nYou may want to read this blog post to see how another project is implementing swimlanes\nhttp://thebuggenie.wordpress.com/2014/10/06/planning-your-moves/\n. I agree, better safe than sorry\n. > Note: The username of the comment author must be the same between Github and Kanboard and the task must exists before.\nAh... That's going to be a problem for public Github projects as just anybody can comment on projects.\nWouldn't it be possible to import all comments and indicate that it came from a Github user?\n@fguillot (Github) @ 24/11/2014 \u00e0 11:37\n. Swimlanes automatic actions\n. With swimlanes this is even more crucial. Dragging a task from the default swimlane to one which is a couple of rows belows is a pain as we have to scroll down while holding it or do it in at least 2 steps.\n. Good job! :+1: \n. Would it be possible to get a keyboard shortcut like \"e\" ?\n. Excellent, thanks!\n. I'll try again when the chained actions are implemented. It could be that there is a conflict between various actions.\n. It only works if I assign the label after I've created the issue. If I add it before submitting the issue, then the category is not assigned in Kanboard. I'm also assigning a colour at the same time, so maybe that's getting in the way.\n. \n. For people reviewing, this is an implementation of https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/issues/383\n@BlueTeck - I think it's usually best to commit unrelated changes in separate PRs. It's easier for people to review that way. In this instance, the swimlane colour option is probably great, but in a separate PR, people would be able to make suggestions :)\n. Ah, cool :)\n. Thanks!\n. Maybe it's a format thing? I'm using 31/03/2015\n\n. The calendar is completely empty. I've checked the database and I can see the timestamps in the date_due column.\n. If I use a filter to only show tasks assigned to me, then I can see the tasks and when I put the filter back to \"Everybody\" then it stays, but as soon as I move away and come back then the calendar gets reset again.\n. I like @ashbike's suggestion. Gives people an opportunity to review the sub-tasks\n. Thank you.\n. Ah, you're right. So, it's broken on the one which is on the dashboard.\n. Works, thanks!\n. Merci!\n. That looks really good and would be very useful when using hooks. but I'm a little bit worried about robustness. How about storing something like a serialized object?\nAbout colours, I think it could work quite well if the main colours were replaced by shades of one colour per example, but overall, it's not too shocking. Pastel colours could maybe be used for the main tasks.\n. @fguillot - Maybe, but that means getting everybody to install the same browser extension or app, exchanging keys, etc. In the end, someone will just paste the password in a comment because \"it's too complicated\"\n@ashbike - Actually, you could share notes between project members. You simply encrypt the project's key using the key of each project member.The project's key is used to encrypt all \"private\" notes.\nLooking at https://github.com/owncloud/core/tree/master/apps/files_encryption , this might be too big of an addition though. In my quick search I couldn't find a PHP library which was flexible enough to handle shared keys.\n. I agree, it would save some time depending on how swimlanes are used\n. It's in \"task add\", but still missing from \"task edit\"\n. Yes, I'm talking about the search box sitting at the top of the board, in the middle. I get a \"No results match\" as soon as I type anything.\nThat project controller is never called. The only calls which are made, are made to the board controller.\nFiltering by \"due date\" or \"recently updated\" works, but that's not calling anything on the server side.\n. I've tested on Chrome and as an admin and same result. That field doesn't send any event to the server.\n. Maybe it's simply a misunderstanding about what the field can do.\nIt says \"More filters\". I assumed I could add some key words and only get the tasks containing those words.\nIf I go to Action->Search, then I can use the search field to get a list of tasks.\n. Great :). Closing this then.\n. > if you clic on the number of a task you already have some direct editing link\nYes, but when viewing the task itself, it's slowing us down to have to use the menu all the time, when we have a bunch of edits to perform.\n. When you hover over the end of the swimlane, then it should scroll until you move away from that point. There would still be a bit of scrolling, but if you time it right (don't wait too long before activating the scroll, but don't start immediately either), then it should be pretty usable.\n. ~~something added these past 3-4 days broke the routing I think. From the board, we're automagically redirected to the dashboard and the header is duplicated. Some task quick actions don't work well. It's impossible to edit tasks.~~\nThe cache needed to be flushed.\n. You're right. Got a 503 in another session. Restarted PHP and the problem went away. Sorry for the noise.\n. I agree. It was confusing to see Core as the \"vendor\"\n. All plugins have to be ~~deleted~~ updated or Kanboard won't work any more.\n. Thank you, for some reason, it was missing from the in-app doc I was looking at, but I can't reproduce the problem at the minute, so I must have been temporarily blind ;)\n. I'm also using plugins, so it may be that those have not been updated yet to support the new ACL feature.\n. :+1: Thanks for letting me know :) \n.

Testing with a user without 2FA, looking at the network tab, I see a POST to ?controller=auth&action=check which gives me a 302 to dashboard.\nI have a KB_SID cookie when I reach the login page and I get a KB_RM cookie after logging in.\nAt that stage, it's impossible to log out.\n. I've moved the plugins folder out of the root and it doesn't change anything.\nUsing another browser or an incognito window doesn't change anything.\nWith the latest update:\n- User with 2FA -> Redirect loop\n- User without 2FA -> Access denied\nDid permissions change recently. Maybe Kanboard can't access something and is throwing this error which has nothing to do with login?\n. Plugins used:\n- SubtaskForecast\n- Timetable\n- Budget\nMaybe, even without the files, the plugins DB tables can block things. No idea.\n. Checked the DB tables for changes introduced by 1.0.22. This has not happened:\n\nSQL table changes:\n    - \"users\" table: added new column \"role\" and removed columns \"is_admin\" and \"is_project_admin\"\n    - \"project_has_users\" table: replaced column \"is_owner\" with column \"role\"\n    - Sqlite does not support alter table, old columns still there but unused\n. Checked the schema version and I'm on 98, but nothing was updated past 93.\n. I've modified the version which triggered an update after a F5, but it silently fails. The version is updated to 98, but the queries are not run. There is nothing in the debug.log\n\nThat's on MariaDB 10, PHP5.6, FreeBSD\n. @fguillot - This is still happening on master. All schema updates silently fail and Kanboard becomes unusable until they're manually run.\n. I'm not sure this applies to what I'm seeing since the schema updates do work if I call them from a custom script reusing Kanboard methods and execute it from the cli. The online updater must be aborting for some other reason.\n. All good, thank you.\n. ### Additional features\n- Swimlanes would show up as milstones in the Gantt charts\n- Swimlanes should probably be hidden from the calendar\nSteps to reproduce\n\nPM decides to use swimlanes for milestones\nPM sets start and end date for each swimlanes\nPM can see milestones on the Gantt chart, above each group of tasks belonging to the swimlane\n. I agree with @donpatzone . It feels like a bug. It's been there for a long time and users are now used to a certain way of doing things. In terms of UI it doesn't make much sense to remove comments, but to keep the rest.\n. From my pov, the subtasks table should be the reference. The value should be either what the PM has entered if larger than what is in subtask_time_tracking.time_spent or what was calculated by the timer for all other cases. And the budget plugin should be updated to track the field in subtasks.\n. Same problem with end dates on 1.0.28.\n\nSteps to reproduce for @fguillot \n1. Set date format to dd/mm/yyyy\n2. Set the end date to 5th of June. Field shows: 2016-06-05\n3. Save. Task shows 05/06/2016 as it should\n4. Edit the task. Field shows 05/06/2016 as it should\n5. Save. Task shows wrong date: 06/05/2016\nPlaying with the date settings has no impact, the bug stays.\nPOST data is correct: date_due:05/06/2016\n. @nitr8 - Maybe you could provide a PR straight from Github?\nhttps://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/master/doc/requirements.markdown\n. Move content to https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/issues/1843\n. I vote for true tags (\"3 tables: \"tasks\", \"tags\" and \"tasks_tags\" as a junction table\").\nHashtags in descriptions are going to be problematic when someone references an issue using #1234566, but tags could be added to the description as hashtags when exporting to some text formats.\n.

If you're running sqlite and the configs don't differ, they should. BUT: You'll run into sync conflicts if you're using both computers simultaneously. Using this system you'll have to wait for a sync after making edits - so it's a system only to be used by a single user.\n. Why exactly do you want to sync the data folder and just put kanboard on a webhost or host it locally on one of the two computers?\n. Closed and up for ReDo by implementing a ProjectDuplication model\n. In that case I would make every part apart from the project board optional -> checkbox. Will get working on an appropriate ProjectDuplication model.\nTo streamline the issue, should duplication cascade model-wise, e.g. ProjectDuplication->duplicate() -> ModelDuplication->duplicate() -> Subtask->duplicate. I think that makes the most sense. This way every base model (Project, Swimlane, Task, Subtask etc) only handles their own duplication. The handling of finding e.g. each subtask for a task and starting Subtask->duplicate() is then done by TaskDuplication.\n. Moin! Did the error occur right after installation? Maybe it's an install error and the template is really not there. I guess you checked that first?\n. When in doubt, try turning it off and on again ;)\n. User has many projects with same workflow and board board setup. User creates a board he calls e.g. \"Template\". This board has the setup (Columns, Tasks, Subtasks etc) needed for each of these similar projects and is set inactive. User then clones \"Template\" and renames \"Template (Clone)\" to \"Project 1\".\nCurrent behaviour: All tasks from \"Template\" and \"Project 1\" which are assigned to User are displayed in the dashboard as assigned tasks.\nExpected behaviour: Only tasks from active \"Project 1\" are displayed in dashboard.\nSolution: Filter out Tasks from Projects which are set as inactive.\n. BlueTeck: Thanks. Should've searched more thoroughly.\nfguillot: Mark as duplicate, please\n. The single CSS files seem to all be merged into app.css. \nRemoving text-decoration: underline from .markdown h1 should lead to the desired results.\n. ./scripts/make-assets.sh is only contained in the github release. The kanboard.net stable version does not contain development scripts and comes bundled with composer dependencies. If you want do use development scripts, download the master or e.g. https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/archive/v1.0.11.zip\nBe advised that in order to run kanboard itself from that download, you'll need to run composer install or copy the vendor directory from the stable release\n. Project / Milestone / Task due dates are of increasing specificity, so they all have their own merits. While a roadmap feature might fit your objective better, a project due date is sufficient for mine.\n. +1! Would make life easier at least for color/category assignment. I'd drop user and just maybe status, which can be set directly from the board or achieved with an auto action for a column. Instead of those, add quick links to adding subtasks, comments and documents.\n. This! I've been looking for this! :D\n. Thanks for fixing\n. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery\n. To be exact: the project_id url parameter is needed in Controller/Base::beforeAction(). Controller/Task::show() just checks if the given task is contained within the given project.\nCould be solved with adding an OR check in the beforeAction to either pull the project_id directly if given or get it via the task. Will see if I can fit in a fix tonight.\n. Note: I just redid the check mechanism. The urls are unchanged, the project_id can be omitted though.\n. Whoops. Didn't mean to close.\nSorry for the messy commit history. I'm trying to get a clue about how to keep it clean.\n. Likely an error occuring and throwing a blank page. Set define('DEBUG', true); in config.php and check data/debug.log after reproducing the error.\n. Model/Task->remove() only removes the task and corresponding files. Subtasks seem to need adding, unless I missed the code fragment.\nedit: seems like I really missed the code fragment. In my local installation, subtasks are deleted just fine. Checked both in the UI and the database. Could it be your installation?\n. I couldn't reproduce your error, but as #553 shows you're also having other problems, I assume that it has to do with your installation of kanboard. I suggest you check the debug log and report back here with your findings.\n. Thank you\n. :+1: \n. As nearly everything else is PHP, I'd opt for a PHP CLI. :+1: \n. I didn't get the idea of doing it in 2 passes, the rest was already implemented. I guess that's workable, although ultimatively I'd prefer the ability of doing it in one pass and do a rollback if task duplication fails. I'll implement it this way for now. Just need to include the checkboxes for selecting which parts are to be duplicated and I'll post a pull request.\n. Everything implemented, writing the unit test\n. #575 \nAlso: Please generate new language files, had to use one new string.

Hello,\nI think that what your're looking for is located under Project Settings > Category Management.\nHere you can add/delete/edit categories that can be affected to the project's tasks.\n. Indeed,\nOnly an admin can modify project settings.\n. If this may help : \nI just tested with an xlsx file and a docx one under Win7/IIS/Kanboard 1.0.10\nGetting no problem to retreive them either via Chrome (39) or IE (10)\n. We have a project with a similar structure and we use swimlanes to represent that, hence we have 4 columns (waiting,doing,validating,deploying) and some swimlanes (which could represent your groups of columns) : development,server,database,documentation,...\nCould this solution works for your need, despite the fact that those informations would be displayed in an horizontal way ?\n. I see what you mean,\nI can not figure out a way to handle this with the current kanboard functionalities (eventually the tasks colors, you did not mention them but maybe they are already in use in your setup), so i can only agree with the FR.\nThe main drawback i can see is the one you pointed out in your original post about the column names, and maybe the consequences on the \"analytics\" functionality which uses column names.\n. Hi,\nAs far as i can remember it always have been shown on the task details page at the bottom right of the task (per example on the demo website (once logged in) : http://demo.kanboard.net/project/1/task/3 the complexity is 8).\n. Database is flushed many times per day so it should not last long i think.\n. Hi\nIt's been discussed in #1144 and is going to be added via #1178 \n. Hi,\nThere is an automatic action \"Assign a color when the task is moved to a specific column\" you can set to your project to have this behaviour.\n. That's exactly how i work : I created a \"template\" project (private and inactive) that i can duplicate when i want to create a new project with the same settings (categories, automatic actions, columns and so forth.\n. Could it be related to the 2038 timestamp bug ?\n. it's an issue related to the unix timestamp it could be quite global you can have more info on wikipedia \nI'm not sure it's the case here, that's why i'm just popping the idea.\nOn my setup (Windows, IIS) the limit date I can use is 01/01/2038, using the 2nd of january 2038 causes the same error you have.\n. +1\n. Looks very similar to #1245.\n. :+1: \n. What you're asking for looks similar to #1345, maybe having multiple level of zoom could fit the both.\n. :+1: \n. Hi there,\nI have foud out that this mail is sent when the description of the task is modified. I then receive 2 mails :  first one is the error mail and the second one is the mail with the description change.\nI will try from a fresh install of 1.0.20 to see if it's due to this version or if it comes from the migration i made.\n. Yeap i planned to make the migration soon so i'll see if this issue is fixed. The thing is that i'm not even sure it's an kanboard issue, looks like i'm the only one affected so it might be my install that is broken.\nI'll keep you up about this subject.\n. Hi,\nI installed the 1.0.22 version of kanboard (from the stable zip), I then copied the data directory (as well as config.php and web.config for IIS to work well) into it.\nMy problem is still there, every time a description is modified inside a task, two mails are sent with same object and one of them has the following error message :\nNotice: Undefined variable: changes in path_to_kanboard\\app\\Template\\notification\\task_update.php on line 3\nThe second has the correct description change with the new text in it.\nI'm using sqlite db on windows server does one of these two things can have such an impact ?\nUpdate : I figured out it only concerns projects with automatic actions, the only one we use is the action that \"assing a color based on a category\", hope this will help.\n. Hi, a few updates : \nwe did a migration into a mysql database (not without some troubles to keep all the data correct from the sqlite file).\nThe problem is still there : if a user modifes a task description then 2 notifications are saved, one without \"changes\" and one with \"changes\". 2 mails are still sent one of them containing the error message.\nIs it normal that a description change insert 2 rows in project_activities with event_name = task.update ? what kind of information can i provide to help with this ?\n. Oops I edited the wrong comment : \nYes, i have automatic actions : \"Assign a color based on a category\", it's the only one used but for 6 different color/category.\nI posted this but not on the last comment (my bad):\n\"Update : I figured out it only concerns projects with automatic actions, the only one we use is the action that \"assing a color based on a category\", hope this will help.\"\n. Once the category is set i am able to trigger the \"error mail\" by for example editing the task description.\nMy usual scenario is :\n1. to 6. like yours\n2. change description\n3. two mails are sent one with the error.\njust tested on 1.0.23fix1 and the error is still there.\n. This issue is not present anymore in 1.0.24 it might be related to the fix concerning color automatic actions.\nThanks.\n. If i remember well i followed the modifications in this commit https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/commit/f01e2f4b781651b2fbb9e1dc079c7eaaae14a4d2 about the file app/Model/ProjectPermission.php to make it work.\n. Tested it on our production installation with Chrome 47 on kanboard 1.0.22 install with MySQL/IIS and no problem here.\n. We achieved this some weeks ago with my team (with a MySQL server, should not be a problem to use the same with MariaDB).\n1. First we shot off kanboard to prevent writings in the sqlite file during the process.\n2. We then generated a dump with a firefox extension that is able to read sqlite files.\n3. We ran this dump to create a database in MySQL call kanboard-old, NB We had to be extremely careful with the JSON encoded fields to manage the quote and '\\' character correctly and escaped those.\n4. We created via Kanboard (by configuring it tu use MySQL) the default kanboard database. This was necessary due to the differences between types in SQLite and MySQL and the fact that the SQLite had some extra columns (due to the lack of ALTER TABLE).\n5. Then we used a tool able to compare MySQL databases (Toad if i remember well) that allowed us to convert the kanboard-old to the kanboard schema.\n6. We then pointed Kanboard on this database (kanboard-old) to test and when everything was ok, dumped kanboard-old in kanboard and dropped the old one.\nWe had some troubles with some characters in descriptions or comments and we needed to escaped them correctly but apart from that all went pretty well, kanboard was upgraded 2 times 1.0.23fix and 1.0.24 without any problem.\nHope this can help you.\n. #1801 for the original thread\n. duplicate of #1801.\n. with markdown syntax you can add ~~ before and after the text you want to strike\nlike ~~this~~\n. I made the #2066 modification locally but at first the problem was still there.\nThe workaround was to modify the int value aforementioned.\n. Hi\nI ran into the same problem with #2163. I'm not sure but I think it's because of 64bits and 32bits differences in PHP.\nCould you try the solution I used in the mentioned thread and see if this works for you ?\n. ",

    "mcorteel": "Gravatar also provides Identicons like this:\n\nThis would be really easy to implement and this way, each user would have a unique avatar when gravatar integration is active. We could then integrate more avatars. @fguillot  what do you think?\n. Something like that?\n\nEDIT: We could even take the opportunity to display a caret to the right of the task ID, which would make the dropdown menu more discoverable.\n. I don't think this requires an external library. I implemented my mockup this morning using this idea from stackoverflow. It just requires a small change in the function that displays the avatar.\n. I guess the rules could be as follows:\n- Gravatar enabled:\n  - User has an email address and a registered gravatar => show gravatar\n  - User doesn't have an email address or no registered gravatar => show identicon\n- Gravatar disabled:\n  - Show the user's initial on a colored background\nThis could all be overruled if we included a profile picture setting in Kanboard. But the advantage of the aforementioned solution is that it doesn't require important code changes (well I already have a branch that does this and I can submit a PR).\n. I agree, and it made me think about the dropdown menu. Why are \"Change assignee\", \"Change category\", \"Change description\" and \"Edit task\" different entries. Everything coud (and IMHO should) be in the \"Edit task\" form, which would greatly simplify this menu.\nBut this would be another ticket I guess.\n. @fguillot I am interested in improving the design of kanboard and the first major thing that gets in the way (for the toolbar) is the fact that icons are not contained in the <a> tag.\nThe idea I had for the URL::link() method was to detect a string like <fa-user> in the $label string and replace it with <i class=\"fa fa-user fa-fw\"></i>.\nIt wouldn't impact code readabilty IMHO, it would be completely backward-compatible and it would make a lot more sense if icons were contained in the anchor. This would also allow a much better styling.\nWhat do you think?\n. I did a proof-of-concept for this:\n\nI think it's leaner (but that's just me, what do you think?). This style could be used to make headers more homogenous. It also saves about 10px of valuable vertical space.\nIf you are interested, I can send a PR.\n. Thank! Yeah, I increased the margin a little. I also increased the font size because it was a little harder to read.\n\nI think it really helps with homogeneity too:\n\n. Also fixes #1439.\n. Yes, another parameter would be better. Also, maybe button would be a better name for the helper.\nI like the idea of homogenous headers, but we can start with the view switchers if you want. What about the actions dropdown? I think it will look a little out of place if it's the only link in the header.\n. OK, I made the changes. I pulled some of your commits when I reverted the changes to master state... I don't know if it makes a difference.\n. I used the existing .btn class in the header for the sake of homogeneity. I think it's weird to have different button designs and it should be addressed globally.\nI added a rule to adjust the font size and padding of buttons in .form-actions (to make them a little bigger).\n. Here is my design updated:\n\n. Like in github, I wanted to take advantage of events that don't need to display a content and make them smaller. This saves a lot of vertical space, so that we can display more activity.\nIf other users feel like you, we can just as easily have a fixed avatar size.\n. It's not that bad with a 32px avatar for everything:\n\nIt does look more natural.\n. I also adapted the comments for better integration.\n. There is nothing when the integration is disabled:\n\nIf the integration is enabled, the avatars are displayed:\n\n. This is just a redesign, I haven't changed anything else.\nThis follows the current avatar principle (if gravatar integration is enabled, it displays the avatar if available).\nDisplaying something when gravatar is disabled would be another pull request (I plan on making a proposal if this is merged, but it has to be merged first).\n. Please comment on issue #126 for that.\n. This is not the subject of this pull request, please comment on #126.\n. No, it's not. This is the topic of #126, which will in turn be the topic of another pull request (if and when this one is merged). I haven't changed the behavior here.\nBasically, you are telling the painter that you want another socket to plug in your toaster when he's asking you about the color of the walls. Please wait for the meeting with the electrician to talk about that.\nIf it helps, I do agree with you. It just isn't the right place to discuss this.\n. @fguillot I see that you are partially redesigning the activity feed with the new (awesome) avatar feature. Don't you want to consider this pull request?\n. Thanks, I will look into it!\n. What's really weird, is that the rule in Firefox is font-size: 1.0 when it should be font-size: 1.0em.\nFirefox obviously interprets it as 1px. But this rule does not exist...\n. Well, there are HTML tags that will cover most of the use cases (h1, h2, h3 and small). For other cases that don't have a semantic value (like tables or the project overview where the numbers on top are displayed with a bigger font), we should have the rule directly in the CSS.\nThe problem is not to have to many font-size rules, but to have to many font-size values IMHO.\n. I agree, #2066 fixes that by generating a color based on full name instead of initials. This way, people with the same initials still get a different background color.\n. But like @fguillot said, if you find yourself in this situation, you'd probably be better off using actual avatar pictures. Color+initals is just a fallback for users that don't have an avatar.\nBut I agree that the option to disable avatars entirely could make sense.\n. Sorry!\n. Yes, I think that would make sense. You could put a link on the website. It would help users to get help without overcrowding the bug tracker.\n. @phsteffen this is a very good idea. I wanted to do a theme plugin but I didn't know where to begin...\nWould you be open to the idea of a choice between different themes in the configuration?\nI can try to implement that if you want!\n. I opened issue #2107 to change button layouts (include the icon in the anchor), which would greatly improve the possibilities for theming.\n@phsteffen, could you please comment on this issue?\n. La langue fran\u00e7aise est certes assez mal faite \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, mais je ne crois pas avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu de logiciel faire cette distinction. Par ailleurs, il faudrait \u00e9galement changer \"utilisateur\".\nJe suis tout \u00e0 fait pour un d\u00e9bat sur l'inclusion de la r\u00e8gle de proximit\u00e9 dans la grammaire fran\u00e7aise, mais je ne crois pas que cette distinction soit la mani\u00e8re la plus efficace de repr\u00e9senter la diversit\u00e9.\nJe serais int\u00e9ress\u00e9 par les avis des francophones \u00e0 ce sujet ceci dit !\n. Oh, I didn't notice... Great!\nI will try to submit a PR to change the remaining icon links next week-end or so.\n. Because you cannot theme <i></i><a></a> as a button properly, but you can do that with <a><i></i></a>!\nAnyway, you're doing a great job with kanboard but I'm not using it anymore (I use the simple boards provided by phabricator instead) so I won't be bothering you with my ideas anymore :).\n.

I created a simple plugin for naming colors and appending a filter-dropdown in board view:\nhttps://github.com/Busfreak/kanboard-color_filter\nMaybe this helps?\n. Hi @eurodrew555,\nI have added the filter to the search-controller, overwriting app/filters_helper.\nMaybe we should insert it with a hook sometimes.\nNow you can filter for your colors in the dashboard and search-controller. No sorting but filtering over all the tasks, you have access to.\n. Hi @eurodrew555 \nThe plugin adds the color-filter to the dashboard (Farbkodierung, naming is done in the translation file of the plugin):\n\nWhen you choose a color, the filter is set showing all tasks you have access to with the selected color assigned to, no matter which project they belong to:\n\nThis ist done in the search-controller. There you can combine all kinds of filter, e.g. \nstatus:open assignee:me color:\"cyan\" color:\"green\" color:\"yellow\"\n. Adding the filter to the dashboard was a quick and dirty test, if that would help you with your issue. Sure, now we have it twice in the board/project view. Here the filter only works within the current board. For filtering over all tasks, you have to do it in the dashboard or search view.\nIf you and maybe other users like the way of filtering colors, then I would refine the plugin, so the filter appears in different views (and only once :smile:)\n. Hi @eurodrew555,\ntry the update. Filter will appear once only :smile:\n. modified for 1.0.22:\n\"Event removed: \"session.bootstrap\" use \"app.boostrap\" instead\"\n.

Hello @fguillot \nI have to ask again.\nI need to call my own function from within a template. The template is injected with a hook, so I can't give values from my controller to the template.\nCould it be a way to load a custom helper class?\nHow could I do this? With the function getClasses(), I only can load custom models, right?\n. Hello @fguillot \nThank you for your help!\nI don't know if it is a bug or a feature, but if I do something like\n$this->NameOfHelper->MyModel->MyFunction()\nfrom within a template, it will call MyFunction from MyModel without an error.\nNameOfHelper is the name of any existing helper :eyes: \n. Hi Timo,\nthe construct $this->container['MyModel']->MyFunction()\ndoesn't work anymore, I think since 1.0.26. But you can try\n$this->AnyExistingHelper->MyModel->MyFunction()\nI used it in my color-extension:\nhttps://github.com/Busfreak/kanboard-color_filter/blob/master/Template/task/color_picker.php#L2\nI thought about initiating my own container in the helpers, something like\nhttps://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/blob/2e320ceeadf5e134352a9bb83efff93964a40f81/app/ServiceProvider/HelperProvider.php\nbut this is still only a thought...\nHope that helps :-)\nMartin\n. You are perfectly right, @fguillot said, he has to change the helper system to load custom helpers.\nI haven't found out why $this->container[] doesn't work anymore in the templates.\nI think, we can change the documentation, when calling own classes/functions works in templates without this workaround.\n. :thumbsup:\n. You can create a plugin (http://kanboard.net/documentation/plugins), using ProjectMetadata (http://kanboard.net/documentation/plugin-metadata).\nThen you attach your own template to the hook 'template:project:sidebar' (http://kanboard.net/documentation/plugin-hooks) and with this you open your own form for editing the ProjectMetadata.\nOverwrite the template 'Template\\project\\filters.php' with a copy, overwriting the original with setTemplateOverride (http://kanboard.net/documentation/plugin-overrides).\nChange your copied template on line 94 and overwrite the t('Categories') with your own function reading the new Category name from the database.\nThat's it :smile: \n. try this one https://github.com/Busfreak/Category_label\n.

I agree with levlaz.\nThe way you released in the past would best fit to the \"release train model\" with three rails, master, beta, stable. You work on master like you do right now. We do the testing and language work on beta, until it is stable and the \"end user\" gets the build from stable. New features have to be introduced to master. This leads to a time gap in releasing new fetures, but right now it's the same. 1.0.28 is stable, 1.0.29 is beta... \n. maybe this issue: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/issues/2298 ?\n. Hi @fguillot !\nThis PR runs in merge conflicts now. Shall I resolve them?\n. After some events, lets say external audits, I create lots of tasks (50-80) in bulk, to work with the different submissions. This happens twice a year, but the work has to be spread over the whole year. If I want a task to be started, I assign it to someone and move it to the next (to be done) column. In the dashboard (my tasks) I then have lots of tasks, which are not started, and I can't focus on the work which has to be done now. This feature makes it very much easiser to keep the overview!\n. @macman31 \nYou are only partial right, because some tasks will be assigned to someone (me or someone else) when I know who will have to work with it. If I don't assign them I have to write it in the comment or so and assign it later, when it has to start. That's no real solution.\n. The conflicts have been resolved in a new PR: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/pull/2424\n. In the projects table the priority values are stored: start (eg. 0), end (eg. 3) and default. These values are numerical and a range. So it is not possible to change them from number to text directly.\nYou could try to assign your own label to a number and display this text instead of the number.\nFor this you have to create a plugin saving and editing text values for numerical values for a specific board, eg. in the metadata table. Then you have to overwrite the templates, where the priority is shown, call your own functions to overwrite the numbers coming from the database and so on.\nI did something similar overwriting color names:\nhttps://github.com/Busfreak/kanboard-color_filter\nGood luck :smile: \n. Great idea!\nBut you should put the translated files in the sub directory \"doc/es_ES\".\nSee https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/commit/75019b3a8e838f51bfac51bdbf9e6647faaaec1d\n.

Hi Vertumnus,\nyou can create your own plugin-table for this:\nhttps://kanboard.net/documentation/plugin-schema-migrations\n. @fguillot \nI changed it to boolean. But I have to resolve some new conflicts in translation before :-)\nThanks a lot!!\n. And all the hooks are gone.... Hi @fguillot \nthanks for the hint! I will do it.\nBut I have a problem getting the result back into ColorModel->getList.\nDebuging the function Core/Hook->reference shows that the params are transferred correctly to my function, but the result isn't transferred back from function Core/Plugin/Hook->reference, but the original $param. Do we need someting like\n\"$param = $listener($param);\" instead of \"$listener($param);\"\nin line 111 in the reference function?\nRegards\nMartin\n. @fguillot \nSorry, I got it now! There is a small but important \"&\" I neglected.\nCan you please merge now?\n. There has been a lot of time since the last update of german locales, why didn't you create a PR the way you like? But you are free to correct the spelling :smile: \n. and can you provide the solution to the community please?\n. Hi!\nSome hints for the beginning:\nThe movement is done by calling the controller app/Controller/BoardAjaxController with action save via JSON. The passed variables are\n\ntask_id\nsrc_column_id\ndst_column_id\nswimlane_id\n(new) position\n\nAll methods for positioning a task are declared in app/Model/TaskPositionModel.\nNow you need to analyse the actual filter, but I don't have experiance with that.\nHope that helps \ud83d\ude04 . I've tried the patch.\nResult is, that it works the same way with both, TheCloud's and woosting's example.\nBut in both cases Bean is separated from Aspargus. The new order, unfiltered, is:\nTheCloud:\n- Apple\n- Banana\n- Blackberry\n- Aspargus\n- Apricot\n- Bean\n- Broccoli\nwoosting:\n- Apple\n- Banana\n- Apricot\n- Aspargus\n- Blackberry\n- Bean\n- Broccoli\nSee PDF with details:\nTaskPositionModel.pdf\n. Perfect!\nThanks!\n. You can create your own CSS using this example plugin:\nhttps://github.com/kanboard/plugin-example-css. I was not able to reproduce your issue (with MySQL).\nYou should try again with the latest version of Kanboard (1.0.38).. well observed, thanks for the hint!. UUh, sorry.\nPR is updated to pass tests.\nI wanted to translate, but I had an issue with this.\n'The email project must be unique across all projects'\nis the error message to\n'The project email is optional and could be used by several plugins.'\nso it should be:\n'The project email must be unique across all projects'\nWhat do you think?. @skywalker89 \n\nhow can I do that (inbstall plugins manually)?\n\nTried reading the documentation?\nExample:\n\nhttps://github.com/BlueTeck/kanboard_plugin_coverimage/blob/master/README.md\nhttps://github.com/kanboard/plugin-google-auth/blob/master/README.md. @aljawaid \nThe error \"strict-transport-security: the site specified a header that could not be parsed successfully\" seems to deal with server misconfiguration, maybe self-signed ssl-certificate?\nOn a basic web-hosting server everything runs without a problem.. @aljawaid \nSorry with that conf. Not in detail. Try Dr. Google :-). Hi @whinote \nA plugin would be best.\nUse the hook \"template:board:task:icons\" to implement an icon in the right lower corner of the tasks and give it the action you need.\nSomething like this:\n\n. So tell me what it should do in detail.\nMaybe I think about it \ud83d\ude04 . Hi @RRRRoger, you are welcome to express your wishes and comments here!\n\nI have a plan how to do the up-/downvoting once for each user/task.\nThere is no sorting filter, this is done by moving tasks manualy. But I could implement sorting in the bord/column/dorpdown, but this has to be done manualy. I have to think about automatic sorting and do some tests.\nQuestion:\nIs it important to track who has voted? E.g. in the project activity?\nFurther discussion can be done here:\nhttps://github.com/Busfreak/kanboard_TaskVote\n@whinote you can close this issue to keep kanboard issues clean.. Hi!\ngive it a try:\nhttps://github.com/Busfreak/kanboard_TaskVote/releases/tag/v.0.0.1\nSorting is in the dropdown at top of a column, but also automatically after voting.. Hi!\nI cloned my installation (about two years of data) to test.\nI tried with the nightly build and it gave the error:\nInternal Error: Unable to run SQL migrations: Running migration \\Schema\\version_122, SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1093 You can't specify target table 'action_has_params' for update in FROM clause (You may have to fix it manually)\nWith the current master all works fine, because Fr\u00e9deric fixed this with the last commit.\nWith a second clone I tested running all 'ALTER TABLE' statements manually. This throws error\nCannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint fails (kanboard1.#sql-4b6_101a8, CONSTRAINTtasks_swimlane_ibfk_1FOREIGN KEY (swimlane_id) REFERENCESswimlanes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE)\nbecause not all tasks:swimlane_id have a partner in swimlanes:id, so constraint fails.\nPreventing this the function migrate_default_swimlane in Schema\\Migration.php has to run first. And this throws your last error, I think\nIntegrity constraint violation: 1048 Column 'name' cannot be null (You may have to fix it manually)\nMaybe you should have a look into your database, if all projects have an entry in the column 'default_swimlane'.. Hi Fr\u00e9deric!\nYes, fresh copy from database with git-clone after that commit migrated without problems.\nOne possible problem I think about is that for the new constraint in table tasks you have to do changes in the database schema. This is done in Migration.php. BUT in the table swimlanes the column name has to be NOT NULL. The data for this column you get from $project['default_swimlane'] and THIS can be NULL.\nIts only an idee \ud83d\ude04 \nMartin. I tested again with a new clone, KB 1.0.39, schema version 121.\nSetting one entry in table projects in column default_swimlane to NULL and then updating KB source to master leads to the error mentioned above:\n\nInternal Error: Unable to run SQL migrations: Running migration \\Schema\\version_122, SQLSTATE[23000]: Integrity constraint violation: 1048 Column 'name' cannot be null (You may have to fix it manually)\n\nSo, @Kolesar did you check your database?. Hi,\nyou should try updating to a newer version. We are currently on 1.0.41. On this version I can't reproduce your issue.. Why not using the hook 'template:auth:login-form:before' or 'template:auth:login-form:after'.\nThere you can display news or even links to where you want?\nSimple way to inform users when logging in.. see https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/pull/3194. So create a plugin (https://kanboard.net/documentation/plugins) and use the hook 'template:header:dropdown' (https://kanboard.net/documentation/plugin-hooks).. please have a look:\n- log in as admin\n- go to settings\n- go to Application settings\n- untick 'Enable \"Forget Password\"'\n- have fun. Very simple contacts plugin, beta stage:\nhttps://github.com/Busfreak/plugin-contacts\nIt's for my private use, so no documentation etc. available.\n\nIndividual list of items in system configuration\nList of Contacts in board configuration (but system wide available)\nSelection of contacts in task edit\nSymbol in task footer, if contact selected, with details in popover. This feature works as it should do.\nIt means hiding tasks in the user dashboard, first page after log in (controller=DashboardController&action=show) not in the projects dashboard.. https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-calendar\n\nhttps://github.com/kanboard/plugin-gantt. Ablaufdatum has always been Ablaufdatum in the german translation, so I didn't want to change it now.\n. Dashboard has always been dashboard in the german translation, so I didn't want to change it now.\nWhat would you prefer?\n. What would you prefer? Schwimmbahn?\n. see above\n. Hi Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric,\nyou are so right, sorry, i've overlooked!\nThank you and have a happy new year!. ",
    "ghost": "I am thinking about the same thing for about a week now. It would take a bit for me to get into serious app-developement, but I thought it might be worth it.\nI think some interested people like us could be able to pull that off together?!\nAlthough I could imagine that my ideas of this app may differ from yours. I was thinking a minimal app that can show/add/modify tasks of multiple projects and move them via pull-down menus. A must-have would be notifications/reminders (much like a usual todo-tool would show).\nI wondered how other planning-board-apps might do a responsive board view, since I imagine it's pretty hard to be able to swipe item's from columns to another while looking good on a small device (one column per screen). I only found one app (I didn't have a very broad research) to do so: Trello. And they seem to have implemented such a thing by themselves, seemingly without premade Android design elements. \nSince this seems pretty hard to do for me, and it also is not really my focus, I would set that aside.\nWhat are your thoughts on this?\nEDIT: At least a common library/object model for handling Kanboard-instances would be reasonable.\n. Me neither, but I wrote an Android app once in a group project ;-) Can't be too hard :)\n. I didn't have too much time for that either, but I found that there's a variety of libraries for this. The last one that seemed interesting to me is: http://software.dzhuvinov.com/json-rpc-2.0-base.html\n. Awesome, looks already good to me :) Thank you!\n. Usually in kanban, the priorities are set by the order of the tasks in a column (especially the backlog), like in a ranking. You than have the relative priority compared to all other tasks in the column which in my opinion adds more additional benefit and more detailed information than a \"low/high/medium\" kind of ranking.\nAt least this works fine for me. I also don't see that additional value fitting into the idea of a minimal kanban board.\n. Did you find the JSON-RPC doc for kanboard? That seems pretty straight foward, although I didn't manage to get that to work in a quick test either (sadly I didn't have too much time to put into that project until now).\nAlso there is multiple people feeling the need for an Android app and it might be clever to collaborate here.\n. I do :)\n. I have the same problem.  Can you point me to where the app.js file is at?\nReplaced both App.js in assets/src and app.js in assets\n. Hello, we are using kanboard since a week now and really like this application (IT department). I am working in a town hall and my intention (dream?) using this tool is to bring (step by step) the kanban and project management culture. Using this tool i would like to make aware my colleague (non IT department) of their own responsabilities and limit the work. We would like our non-IT colleagues or external providers to be able to see the whole board and status of a project and tasks assigned to them (this actually work) but something that is missing for us is a new role that prevent task modification/update/move between columns from a user whose task is not assigned. Because of my poor english i don't know if my description is clear enough....\nWe spend lot of time to fill the bords and unfortunately (because of the situation i described) we cannot actually permit our colleague to move/update task that are not assigned to them, it would be nice if they can see everything (+ notifications) but only interact with task assigned to them.\nWe are mainly managing IT projects but some non IT department have a role in these projects. There are also some external providers. As i said, a new role as described above would be really useful for us.\nBecause of this, we cannot open Kanboard to other users.\nI understand kanboard is a free and open source software that's why my request is not a request but just a description of what we think to be a limiting feature (in our organization of course).\nRegards,\nAlexandre \nMairie de Sallanches. Thanks !\n. Hi,\nMy kanboard is in french. But you can find this option,  in global setting of Kanboard app : in the menu \"agenda parameter\". \nThere a group options called \"Suivi du temps par rapport aux sous-t\u00e2ches\" (sorry I can't translate).\n. When GitLab triggers the webhook, it sends the assignee_id but the associated assignee data (name, username, avater_url).\nLooks like this should be fixed in GitLab first.\n. I've created an issue for GitLab: Issue assignee data should be posted to webhook\n. Looks like there's progress being made on the GitLab side of this issue. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/1633\n. is this a kanboard issue or a wamp issue ? or something else ?\n. so i will plan my retirement for 2038 lol ! the last deadline ! after apocalypse, all in the desert with dogs and guns ! does fguillot know the pb? is will there be an update ?\nps : i have tested in ganttProject, no pb, i have a task in \"1 janvier 20000\"...\n. hi,\ni've changed the php version of wamp to a 64bit one, but the issue still exists...\n. hi, i'm trying too with ovh, i have set-up htaccess for 5_4 php\nalways the same pb...maybe can you help me....\nthx!\ns\nhere the link\nhttp://braoffice.com/kanboard/\n. i'm creating log / pwd: test / test2038\nkeep in touch!\ns\n. hi, i have installed in wamp all these versions:\nhttpd-2.4.16-x64-vc11 (apache)\nmysql-5.6.27-winx64\nphp-5.6.14-Win32-VC11-x64 (thread version)\nand still the issue...\ni'm so now trying to build my own server, no choice....\nmaybe a vps, i don't know, i'm a newbie in this field...\nPS: what configuration do you have in demo.kanboard.net ?\nthx\ns\n. ok, wampserver must have php7 so i must wait, i will see that on linux,\ndo you know some good practices ?\n. ok...ubuntu install version is easier....thx! nice tool!\nhave fun developers!\ns\n. I cannot move tasks through the columns on the board using Chrome (v47).  Pressing F5 does not result in success.  On the other hand, I can move the tasks through the column in Internet Explorer 11\nKanboard is being hosted on an Ubuntu 14.04 server.\nHere is a short screencast showing the behavior:  http://screencast.com/t/z0r3RkZreY\n. These seems to have been a problem with my install of chrome.  The cards/UI works fine in both Firefox and IE.\n. Aha, now that's more appropiate, @fguillot \nFrom the single user/small team perspective, this information is a bit scary. Now I see, if you come from a big team, the documentation is more accurate.\nThank you!\n. I have installed from \"stable\" and it works. Thank you much for Kanboard, it looks crazy simple and usable.\n. too sad, but i know, this is a very rare scenario. i will browse through the plugins or we have to change our behaviour. thx and greetings\n. That's great !! If needed I could help with the UI design, even though there are plenty of free available template we could adapt. \n. \n. Maybe it could be implemented as a switch between daily view (current default view) and weekly view.\nSomething similar to instagantt:\nWEEKLY:\n\nDAILY:\n\n. I just pulled them down from the ZIP files linked to from the home page.\nIs the home page out of date?\n. Yes, it looks like they are. If you install everything from official website zips, it will be broken.\n. I am seeing the same behaviour. If you add a start date with a time, you get invalid date and the field is reset to 01/01/1970. However, if you do not add the time, the date is set correctly. \nWhen using the calendar picker for the start date, the time is automatically added.\nThis is for Task dates.\nMy date-time format is dd/mm/yyyy g:i a.\nHowever, if I change the date-time format to dd/mm/yyyy H:i the error stops\n. +1\nAs long as this isn't possible, we cannot use swimlanes effectively. Furthermore, we have to separate one project into multiple - which leads to less overview.. Merci Frederic. same problem here.

Ok great, thanks!\nAny feedback on https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/pull/166 ?\n. maybe this should be made more generic to allow giving various permissions to each user: manage users [i.e. current proposition, titled 'owner'], manage board, edit task, ...\n. Hello,\nJust rebased on master.\nBest regards,\n. The mouseover part needs a bit of JavaScript event handling, which is done only for task-board-tooltip class, in board.js. The column use the  column-task tooltip, which is setup in base.js.\nAdding the task-board-tooltip class changes this behavior on the board only (and defaulting to the title attribute in the content function).\nSome refactoring would be needed to support this everywhere, but I am not sure if that would feel natural for a tooltip: that's why I did not go in that direction.\nOn the other hand this is probably needed if the description includes links...\n\nOn 25 f\u00e9vr. 2015, at 03:47, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Guillot notifications@github.com wrote:\nDo you have an idea why I cannot do a mouseover on tooltips for column description but I can do it with task footer tooltips?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. With chrome at least, on a large board (500 tasks) there is some flickering / relayout: there is a placeholder for the task menu's bullet, which eventually is removed when dropit has finished.\nOn 25 f\u00e9vr. 2015, at 03:51, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Guillot notifications@github.com wrote:\nI never notice any \"re-layout\", how I can reproduce the issue?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. I have New and InProgress columns.\nI already have actions which automatically sets the assignee to the person who moves the task to InProgress, and clears it when the task is moved back to New.\n\nThis makes it more complex for manager to have somebody work on a new task (e.g. in meeting): with these actions, simply setting the assignee in column New will move the task to InProgress (and conversely)\n\nOn 25 f\u00e9vr. 2015, at 03:56, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Guillot notifications@github.com wrote:\nWhat is the use case for that, do you have an example?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. This patch makes the page flicker when loading, since the column are not properly size at first, then the correct table \"layout\" is set by Javascript.\n\nAlso, the 'public' view is not properly sized at all, with all column having different width.\n. Oups, I did not see that...\nThis can be fixed by simply putting back the 'overflow-x: auto' line on the #board-container element. However, this causes the scrollbar to appear 180px below the board, thus looking quite strange:\n    * When the board has few task, the scrollbar appears somewhere in the [vertical] center of the browser window\n    * When the board has many task and vertical scrollng is needed, the scrollbar appears only after scrolling all the way down\nTo avoid all this I also tried to use 'fixed' positioning of the header (which also ensures the headers are not moved when Chosen replaces the controls; this works great as far as horizontal scrolling is concerned, but also retains its fixed position when scrolling vertically: it does not move, and gets 'below' the board.\nI updated my change with this 'fixed' layout, but I am not sure how it can be properly fixed.\n. Closing this, please check #706 instead: it has only the table layout part, not any changes to the scrolling. I will see if i can fix the scrolbar issues (e.g. horizontal scrollbar appears in the 'middle' of the page if board is empty, and must scroll to the bottom of the page to get the scrollbar when there are many tasks).\n. Updated to get name & description in a single query, and use the 'categories' variable to pass everything to the template.\n. This is fixed now, the header does not move anymore.\nI have a board with more than 400 tasks (luckily, most of them in 'Done' or 'Backlog' columns :-) ), and i cannot miss the resizing of columns with Chrome on my Linux machine.\nThe other problem with this \"large\" board is that I need to scroll down to the bottom of the page to see the horizontal scrollbar. This is the problem I tried to fix as well in #688, causing the header regression. This patch addresses only the board layout/flicker issue, to avoid the header regression.\n. I don't think so: I removed this extra  as there is another one on line 53...\n. ",

Oh, and I figure you'll probably ask... yes, I verified the data directory is writable. Even turned off selinux temporarily to see if that was the problem. PHP's session.save_path is /tmp which is already writable by all users, so I don't see how that could be causing this issue.. ",

Because I assign work-steps an IDs derived from the date (like \"1409120a\" for the 1st experiment I did on 20th of Sept. 2014), alpha-numeric sorting would be useful as well.

If that can be done through a plugin thats perfect for me. \nKanboard already allows to assign child parent relations e.g. through the 'Add a link' feature.\nWhat I think would be great is to have a tree view of all items on a board (or all items in a single swimlane etc) that visually shows these links. Much like a tree view in your filebrowser that shows a directory tree.  \nSome ideas:\n- Maybe through a plugin it is possible to get all task in a swimlane, figure out their parent/child relations and display the items as a tree of items.\n- In the same view a user could create a new child item for a specific tasks. This would create a new task and in addition automatically adds the child - parent links (similar to what is already possible via 'Add a link'.\n- The cost/progress of each parent item can be defined as the cumulative cost/progress of all the child items and the parent itself.\n- For the default projects columns (Backlog, Ready, Work in progress, Done) the tree - view could  replace the backlog column: any item in the tree view has a corresponding item in one of the ther columns. That is, while all items move from Ready, via WIP to Done, the tree view shows item progress go from 0 to 100%.\n. See also #901 that describes the same thing\n. Whow, thats cool and is very visual!\nSomething like this would be very useful in creative sessions where projects are discussed by a team and new ideas are worked out from a vague course idea to detailed Tasks.\nWould be great if in such a view:\n- user could add an item \n- user could set the relation between two items.\n- do the above two in one go, e.g by right clicking an item and selecting 'add child' from a menu..\nThe view reminds me very much of a mindmap..... also very useful for creating Tasks in a brainstorm session.\n. Backlogs are typically used in projects to record (and prioritize) items that are not part of a project planning yet, but will be addressed at a later time.\nIdea: Add a 'special' backlog column to the board. One that spans all rows (swimlanes). \n- Items on the Backlog are not used in analytics: they are not yet part of a planning\n- Items on the backlog can be assigned to a swimlane by drag & drop, so that they become part of a planning\n- The backlog column can be hidden, for projects that do not want to use one.\n\n.

    "85pando": "In my opinion this would be a dupllicate, but as there is some implementation already present and the discussion seems more lively, i'd rather close #262. \n. Is this really needed? The tasks in one column are already grouped together as they are in one column. Adding the same color to all of them seems redundant.\n. Also, you can already do this via automatic actions:\n- move task to column\n- change color of task\n- do this with one color for every task\n. The only thing that would make sense here in my opinion would be to emphasize text with bold or italic in titles, but I'd rather agree with @froschdesign here, that this would disturbe the board.\n. So you are using the title more in the sense of \"displayed text\" it makes more sense to say that you want to be able to format it. For me titles have been just for displaying the topic of the note, all other information is in the description, which I was always glad about not having displayed directly on the note.\nWith your further description it is better understandable, what you want this feature for. Still I would prefer (knowing some of the people I work with) that this might (if implemented) be a board-wide option that can be disabled.\n. @rseabra See #1667 \u2026 Oh, you already did find that as well (This link is for everyone else).\n. Did you set MAIL_TRANSPORT to smtp?\nIn the config.default.php its in line 23\nphp\n// Mail transport available: \"smtp\", \"sendmail\", \"mail\" (PHP mail function), \"postmark\", \"mailgun\", \"sendgrid\"\ndefine('MAIL_TRANSPORT', 'mail');\n. @bdrayer I think this issue is broader than the the linked one. Solving this one here might solve the other as well.\nI just wanted to add this feature request as well.\nSome thoughts on this:\n- No notification on discussion: If I comment on a ticket noone / someone else is assigned to, I will not be notified of his answer. (Auto add to observer list? Have a box when posting a comment to add to observer list?)\n- It should be able to somehow \"follow\" a task \u2192 Observer list.\n- I would like to be able to add other persons to the observer list (Maybe only for task creator / project manager)\n. Colors is always a difficult thing to name. Maybe we should open an Issue with color names, where we also have the actualy colors there, so we can discuss about the naming of them.\n. Limette(ngr\u00fcn) would be a solution that tries to stay closer to lime. So that would probably be somewhat preferable.\nOne thing that still boggles me a little is that in my opinion light green is darker than green in the current setup:\n\n. @froschdesign\nThats true of course. Maybe at some point one wants to revamp the colors again to fix this.\n\nSo the consensus seems to be Limette for Lime?\n. @nickbe Etwa beim Einrichten der automatischen Aktionen werden nur die Namen angezeigt\u2026\n. corrected\n. @connorbode is totally right. The bugs seem to be too well hidden. \ud83d\udc7b\n\ud83d\ude31 But this will probably be a wontfix bug.\n. Interestingly, I just wanted to add the same issue (-:\nCould also be:\n- Radio Buttons with colored fields.\n- Coloring the fields in the dropdown menu (background color).\n- Just have the block of colors there like it is in \"edit task\".\n.

Personally I'd like to have a project-specific task IDs as well. Auto-increment task_id may stay as it is, how about adding another field, something like \"display task id\"? When creating a project, it's own display task id would start from 1, and be auto-incremented as well. Also I would add an option to specify a task ID prefix for a project. For example if I have WebApp and BackEnd projects, I'd like them to have task IDs WA-123 and BE-123. If no prefix is specified for a project, it's tasks ids would be just numbers, but independent of other projects. Basically, this is same as the separation of Issue ID and Issue Key in JIRA.\nPlease consider this proposal :)\n. ",

Hi BlueTeck: I believe the original Twitter message was asking for a thumbnail image to show up \"on\" the kanban card viewed within the overall board view.  The method Trello uses is to pick the \"last uploaded image\" as the representative thumbnail to go on the kanban card.\nHere is a sample image taken from my Trello board.  Notice the cards on the left do not have any images, the cards on the right do: \n. From a usability perspective, I think a general option to set the default behavior of displaying an image thumbnail on all cards would be useful, probably more useful that an option within each card for those of us who use hundreds of cards.\nBTW, thank you so much for picking this up BlueTeck\n. Fair enough.  It might work out well that way\n. BlueTek, can you make sure #511 is incorporated in your new feature?  I saw you commenting on #511, so I have my fingers crossed.  The only thing I'm worried about is it might not show up as the same type of object as a \"file attachment\".  thanks.\n. Trello, pasteboard and imgur all have this feature.  I know all the browsers access the clipboard for images differently, thus they only seem to work in Opera and Chrome now.

Sorry to a bit late update but the prototype of the parser is implemented. The parser code can be implemented minimal codes and flexible to change thanks to php-peg.\nThe following is the example of queries and their result.\nhttps://gist.github.com/yuichi1004/51ded0a963815124eaac\nCurrently I am planning to start implementing the search based on the following.\nhttps://github.com/yuichi1004/kanboard/blob/feature/task_query/docs/advanced-search.markdown\n. I think that works for simple cases. This approach gets complexed if we introduce phrasing or grouping like the following cause the tokenizer needs to be aware of its context.\nassignee:\"John Smith\" NOT (category:Research OR category:\"Bug Fix\")\nThe advantage of my prototype is minimal lines of code.\nhttps://github.com/yuichi1004/kanboard/blob/feature/task_query/app/Libs/KQLParser.peg.inc\nI think it's tradeoff between our code complexity and dependency to the 3rd party. I prefer to keep our code minimal so I took this approach but I am also comfortable to write our tokenizer.\n. I understand your point. I agree that PHP code generation process is the biggest cons of pho-peg.\nLet's start with something small and improve it later.\nI would start working with lexer based on your prototype.\n. ",

Thanks @fguillot for accepting/merging it in (and adding the unit tests and other housekeeping tasks). Sorry for some of the troubles encountered. For an enhancement, I specifically didn't do it, because I personally feel it goes against Kanban methodology, but I did have the idea if people need the ability to create multiple tasks upfront, it would be possible to add a new trigger status (Manual), and manually call duplicateRecurringTask in a loop to create many tasks in advance. With proper checks and balances, the loop can be for a either a set iteration (create 5 duplicate tasks), or until a specific due date is reached. Another enhancement would be instead of triggering from the first or last column or closing of the task, would be to add another trigger type and process it when moved to a column that has an automatic action setup. There were lots of ideas, however I wanted to get a base concept in first to see if/how it was accepted. Great work on Kanboard. Love it.\n. ",

If this were applied to the current project, it would at the very least look distracting. The main reason is that the two colors you're using don't exist anywhere in the current theme. I'd also argue that the current theme's rectangular layout and strict lines are completely at odds with the circle, the stylized \"K\" and \"B\", and the italics.\nI'm not saying it's bad, I'm saying it's completely out of place. Maybe it would make more sense if you drew a couple of theme mock-ups that match the logo.\n. To illustrate my point:\n\n.

I was facing the same issue on only one particular instance of Firefox. When I used a new Firefox profile I didn't face the issue. So it was obviously some setting being the culprit.

After searching a bit I went into about:config and found that there was a user-set dom.w3c_touch_events.enabled;1 which I promptly reset to the default of dom.w3c_touch_events.enabled;0.

The  third parameter in Kanboard\\Helper\\Asset::css gives you the possibility to set the value for the media attribute.\nWith your solution you must add 8 more methods for all other media types. (all, aural, braille, handheld, projection, tty, tv, embossed - screen and print is already there)\nIf you can not set the third method parameter for the asset helper, then the hook system is the problem and not the helper.\n. > Or you can rename config.default.php to config.php\nThis is also included in the docs: \n\nNote: You can also rename the template file config.default.php to config.php.\n\nhttp://kanboard.net/documentation/mysql-configuration\n.

This should be the standard implementation.\nGravatar or other services should be integrated via Plugin. (imo)\n. > This is just a redesign, I haven't changed anything else.\nThen we need to rethink here:\n- remove Gravatar from the core\n- implement the first letter of the name styled with CSS\n- add Gravatar via plugin\n. A deeper integration of the Gravatar service in the core is the wrong way!

Having too many features increase the complexity of the software.\n\nIf this question arises, then the answer is simple: Plugin! \ud83d\ude09 \n(Suggestion: Change the label \"feature request\" with \"plugin\" and add a label \"help wanted\".). @ToxyLT \nThis is already included in the requirements: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/doc/en_US/requirements.markdown#php-extensions-required\n\n\u2026if you add this command to the installation instructions.\n\nThe PHP-DOM extension is enabled by default and the command will not work on shared hosting.. @ToxyLT \n\nI understand that only computer professionals are living here on github.\n\nNo, I'm not a server administrator or the like. But if I want to install this or other applications myself, then I need some basics.\n\n\u2026it is only fair to other new users that they find installation instructions that work right from the beginning.\n\nAnd then we have the next problem: the install command will not work on a shared hosting server.\n\nPlease don't get me wrong, I like your intention, but not every topic can covered by the documentation. The documentation says you need PHP with some standard extensions, which are enabled by default in PHP! Why should the installation of these extensions be described then?\nIf something missing on your system, then look at the PHP documentation and you will find the install command: http://php.net/manual/en/book.dom.php. @ToxyLT \n\nSo obviously the export-function works wrong.\n\nI think \"wrong\" is not correct here, because the current behavior of import and export is not described and with the template for the import it works obviously as intended.\nIt's not consistent, but it's not wrong. \ud83d\ude09 \n@fguillot \nThe documentation for import and export is missing or I did not find it.\nBtw. why is this function in the core? Import and export are perfect candidates for plugins. This opens the door for more formats than CSV.. @ToxyLT \n\nWhat a pity!\n\nFirst: I am not the programmer or volunteer on this project, but please pay attention to your tone. This is an open source project and if you miss something, then you can ask for that or make a suggestion. (imo)\n\nI used the export function as backup for my project.\n\nBackup the database. The import and export function is the wrong way.. @TheFax \nKanboard uses Markdown and for a line break you need two spaces or more at the end of a line.\nReference:\n\nhttps://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#p\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#Example. \n",

Sounds silly but giving permissions to Users group solved the issue for me too.\nThanks.\n. Hi, how can I use this feature?\n. Hi, about question 1, can we set the project as the filter assigneee:me as default and cannot be deleted ?\nBW.\n. If the default filters can be defined per board per user role, and we have the option to lock the filter it would solve lots of my restriction and reporting purposes. \n+1 for this feature request\n. I vote up for a configuration for this feature. When there are lots of people using the boards, or managers do not recognize the members so good, names instead of initials or avatars would be better.\n. +1 for this.\nI am planning to use KB for production line monitoring. A functionality to print the task, which supports barcode included custom label templates would be super cool. \n. translations finished for tr_TR\n. After a few more tests, I understand that only the creator can delete tasks, which makes sense. So this is a nice to have feature. \n. Thank you very much. This helped me simplify the dashboard.. Hi Mustafa, I would like to keep in touch with you about KB modification.. One of the pros of Kanboard is its simplicity. The problem about the new dashboard is it just gives an opposite feeling right after login.\nOther than that, congrats for the excellent product.. This is one of the most requested feature. Definitely needed a lot.. You are correct, but it depends on the person looking at the board!\nGenerally, boss or managers want to see all peoples task on the board. But they don't want the employees see each other tasks. Also an employee can prefer to see only his tasks to  concentrate on them. If we have this restriction we can give all two parties the view they need.\nBecause we don't have this feature, currently two of the companies I recommended using kanboard creates projects per user! This is unnecessary in my view. Also it makes the usage of boss harder.\nSo, my vote is having this restriction ability.. ",

Both solutions is read-only with no user interaction.\nSolution 1 is with webix (please note that this costs $$): AllBoardView with JS\nSolution 2 is just HTML and CSS. For now it is predefined to 4 columns, but you can easily loop through your data and add columns dynamic. See the README.md for how to change the columns: AllBoardViewHTML\n. Agreed - the full overview of tasks and subtasks would be a great feature.

    "eurodrew555": "I've also submitted a related feature request at https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/issues/2943 to show the current number of open/closed tasks on the \"edit columns\" page. This would help in preventing deleting columns that contain tasks.. Thank you! Much appreciated.. This would be super useful !\n. Another approach - it would be great if there was a filter field for open tasks, so for example if I just wanted to see all open, red tasks across all projects I could use the filter \"color:red\"\n. Looks interesting @Busfreak however I'm looking for more ways to filter and sort the open tasks list view. Basically the problem I'm running into is I'm using Kanboard to manage multiple projects, and would like a quick way to see all the high priority tasks across all projects in one view, rather than having to go and check each project one by one.\n. Sounds good @Busfreak \nDo you know if this works with the open tasks list view?\nDoes it add a filter field to that list view?\n. This sounds like it should solve my issue, however when I install the plugin on the latest version of kanboard 1.0.22 the UI now has two \"Color Coding\" filters. When I select color:\"red\" in either of the drop down lists it still only shows tasks from within the current project. Also, how does this filter then work within the current project? Ideally I would like to be able to filter either within the current project, or across all projects.\n\n. Looks good to me! Thanks!\n. This is perfect. Thanks!\n. I've looked at the new tags to see if I could use them in place of the wildcard filters but it doesn't look suitable in the current implementation.\nTo use tags in the same way I would need to add a client tag to each task using an automatic action. Then I would search using tag:CLIENT-NAME\nAny comment on whether wildcard filters or automatic tags could be implemented would be really appreciated. I am really enjoying using Kanboard and being able to quickly search in this way would make it perfect! Thanks\n. I keep getting caught out by this as well. Frustrating to lose all your updates when you accidentally click outside the popup edit page!\n. This would be really useful. I have tasks for reference/info that I just keep open which is good for quickly getting to important info for a project. The only problem with this is these tasks show up in searches, etc when I would prefer they are just closed but visible on the board.\nWould be good if you could mark a task as completed which stays visible on the board but doesn't show up in open tasks, etc. Closing the task then removes it.\n. This catches me out from time to time as well. My preference would be to require the cancel button to cancel. Clicking outside the task form shouldn't close the form. \n. I'm running into the exact same problem as all my projects are prefixed with \"COMPANYNAME - \"\nThis would be perfect if it just matched any position rather than from the start of the project name.\nI have also submitted a separate request to sort the projects alphabetically..

After a careful consideration, such a pop-up will provide a second click-path to doing the same stuff which is available when clicking on the task ID. At the time I was \"voting\" this feature up, I thought that the modal dialog was removed (I always clicked on the small icon on the bottom right instead of the task ID). Now that I know that the functionality is there wouldn't it be better to increase the usability of the modal dialog instead of introducing a second way of doing the same thing?\nBy increasing the usability I mean that it appears when one clicks anywhere on the task so that one does not have to target precisely the small task ID.\n. Yepp, the link on the task id works just as the link that is now gone from the document icon on the bottom right. I expected the link on the task id to actually open the task detail view, instead of the quick edit popup, which is probably why I never paid any attention to it. Thank you for your remark.\nWhat is the rationale behind the removal/replacement of the link from the icon?\n. Nice, that will improve usability. Thank you.\n. An interesting idea, but after more consideration, it wouldn't quite work, because it would leave us without prioritization tool (swim lanes). Our target setup is as follows:\nThe columns are called only Doing and Done, but there are (in your case) 4 pairs (groups) of them, each called differently: waiting, doing, validating, deploying (again, in your case). Hence, the groups represent the activities, and the columns represent their progress. We use categories to implement task categorization (in your case development, server, database, documentation), and swim lanes to implement priorities.\nCurrently it works great with 8 columns by simply creating two columns and appending (Doing or Done) at the end of the name, However it is not a clean solution, hence the feature request. I hope it is valid and wished upon also by others and I offer my services as a tester at any time.\nCheers,\nel.nicko\nedit: grammar\n. ghostlurker, \nAFAICS AGPL does not restrict usage, only commercialization.

Thank you for the pointers. It's good to know that I'm the only one because a wrong server setup is easier to fix than hunting for an unknown bug I guess...\nThe server has no external integration but the storage part is pretty actual.

It seemed to me that after 1.0.28 ldap configuration over powered local configuration.

    "tranquility-base": "fguillot -- very nice software!!\nI'm just setting up kanboard for my sysadmin team (4 persons) and settled on this approach, at least to begin with (each person gets a unique color to identify their tasks). To help support this use of swimlanes, it might be nice to have automatic actions for the event of a task switching swimlanes. One action might be a warning dialog to confirm a swimlane switch, since a task jumping to another project should be rare.\n. Our situation: we're tying Kanboard in to our service/server alert system. If something goes wrong, a task is generated to notify us and to track its resolution. However, false positives occur, sometimes many at once if, say, a sensor is bad. Sometimes it's a real problem, but there are dozens of alerts and you only want to keep one of them. Or, there might be a legitimate problem (cranky LDAP server anyone?) that causes many spurious alerts due to dependencies. Even a simple misconfigured alert could do it (easy enough when you have hundreds to thousands). If you close the resulting tickets it skews your metrics something awful and makes your history difficult to search through. To get meaningful metrics and history you need to delete them instead.\nSame kinds of issue could come from automated build systems.\n. ",

Another way is to have an extra column named auto-close or whatever and an automatic action; if moved to column 'auto-close' close the issue. \n. TL;DR If html2canvas is a feasible solution for you we'll need indication how to find width of #gantt-chart div so to-be-written JS can temp. override body and slide-container. Rest is coding of a button that does that and fires at html2canvas. @fguillot \nFor those subscribed;\nI've made some milage on trying this out, but got stuck on one particular thing.\nIt's sort of making the screenshots, but in a more sophisticated way :)\nMain problem would be 'how-to-adjust-the-body-width' to the correct length. I've looked around but didn't find a good answer for it in the code/js. The 4000 was a lucky guess to show my current timeshift in a project. The container overflows are do-able with a print-button, as is the inclusion of the html2canvas code and the actual print javascript.\nProblem at hand, you need to make to gantt 'fit' on your screen. You can reproduce all the steps below in your browser using a CSS-inspector and the console.\nAdjust CSS for \n- body { width: 4000px; } (<- manual action)\n- div.ganttview-slide-container { overflow-y: auto; overflow-x: hidden; }\nInclude (or paste in browser console)\n- https://html2canvas.hertzen.com - for console, copy/paste the contents from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/niklasvh/html2canvas/master/dist/html2canvas.min.js\n- In your console enter the below, wait for it and print!\nhtml2canvas($(\"#gantt-chart\"), {\n                onrendered: function (canvas) {\n                var myImage = canvas.toDataURL(\"image/png\");\n                 var tWindow = window.open(\"\"); \n      $(tWindow.document.body).html(\"<img id='Image' src=\" + myImage + \" style='width:100%;'></img>\").ready(function () {\n         tWindow.focus();\n           tWindow.print();\n               });\n                }\n            })\nSample (partial) safari print preview (spanning feb-aug of this year):\n\n. Didn't know either, just found out by trying different things. The solution as pasted above works, if you concatenate the html2canvas and the additional javascript it already works and prints the gantt 'as you see it'.\nBut I think most users would like their whole gantt and not only the visible part. Thats why I put in the 4000px (but that just matches one board, not all)\n. Would this work? @jtourt @fguillot \nhttps://github.com/CoMPaTech/kanboard_plugin-done_column_highlight\nRough on the edges but might due the trick?\n. Trying to duplicate a project the debug log shows https://gist.github.com/CoMPaTech/33d50323b4347e82b9f7\nKanboard: 1.0.26 (from download, not git)\nFBSD 10 / Apache 2.4 (behind same version proxy)\n. First attempt at writing non-plugin contributions, but it reproduces the task distribution view for categories.\n. Re-applied to local branch ... off-topic but first commit included the generated js files, sorry\n. Just as a proof of concept; see https://github.com/CoMPaTech/plugin-theme_auto_day_night\nIt switches based on the current hour with regards to the users (set) timezone.\nStill looking if there is another way to 'configure' the plugin other than filling op the config file (is there  @fguillot)?\n. Pushed a newer version including the (now discovered how-to-do) settings on the configuration screen. So should be a valid concept now to be quickly used for demonstration.\nAlso fixed that if no user is logged in it takes the applications timezone to determine theme.\n. @fguillot struggling to understand what I abused / has changed within the last release.\nAs per https://github.com/CoMPaTech/plugin-theme_auto_day_night/issues/1 I did retrieve stored values from integrations.php within layout/head but there is no $this->config nor new Config($this->container) working.\nClues welcome!\n. Tnx, that seems to work just fine.\nFor anyone tracking, the other settings can be found as well that way (ie I'm looking up the Timezone set whenever the user hasn't), which can be found as\n<?= $this->app->config('application_timezone') ?>\n. @nekohayo @Chaosmeister @thob anyone feel like leaving this open or is the plugin usable enough (and/or trackable through the repo)?\n. It wasn't meant as a full-service plugin and indeed started some time ago as a proof of concept of what someone was asking about. Not sure if @fguillot ever took it as a full plugin\n\nOp 28 apr. 2017, om 13:43 heeft Mike Goodwin notifications@github.com het volgende geschreven:\n@fguillot https://github.com/fguillot I don't really think this issue should be closed, as whatever was offered by @CoMPaTech https://github.com/CoMPaTech, while a very interesting proof of concept, is incomplete and doesn't cover all of the elements (see CoMPaTech/plugin-theme_auto_day_night#3 https://github.com/CoMPaTech/plugin-theme_auto_day_night/issues/3), nor does it really serve the purpose of a plain \"Night theme\" in the sense that it attempts to do other things.\nIs it possible to cover/override all elements in Application Settings -> Custom Stylesheet ?

Not sure it does fix it.\nFirst, the initials are still the wrong way round (\"BS\" rather than \"SB\"), and my name on there is \"TT\" rather than \"AT\" (because I use my middle name rather than my first name). I know it sounds a minor point, but there will be other cases where people have prefered names (\"Bob\" rather than \"Robert\"), or like their initials in different orders (in some countries it's firstname-surname, in others surname-firstname).\nThe second problem is this. Take our theoretical company. It has 15 people with the initials 'MB' (Martha Blake, Martin Butler, Midred Baker, Matt Bullingdon, etc). First, there's a reasonable good chance that some people will still have the same colour background. Second, there will always be questions like \"is Martha Blake blue or teal?\", \"Who's yellow?\". Unless the person is that specific colour, or always wears that colour clothes (both unlikely), then the colour has no actual link with the person, so it's very hard to tell who is who.\nYou also get a similar problem to the one above if you rarely interact with those people. For example, my work only rarely overlaps with that of the two SBs (maybe once or twice a year?). I am definitely not going to remember which one is red and which one blue, because I can't remember what I had for breakfast yesterday, let alone something very abstract from a long time ago.\n.

Also correct!\nI just desrcibed the exact way to reproduce this issue.\nThe provided solution was only a workaround.\nThis definitely needs to be fixed.\n. Just copy the complete \"data\" folder to your new installation.\nit's really as simple as that, since the data folder contains all information needed for your kanboard projects.\n. On our Webserver (IIS) we added index.php to the standard-documents.\nSo IIS knows to also try index.php when www.domain.com/kanboard is called.\nCan you configure the standard-documents on your server?\n. I'm not very experienced with .htaccess files, but in this case it seems to enable some URL-rewriting and some safety for config files.\nyou could try to disable the URL rewriting in the .htaccess and see if this solves the problem.\nalso Kanboard URL-rewriting.\n. Hey,\nOur company started with Kanboard 1.15, also with mysql, and continually updated the kanboard installation with every update without any problems.\nYou could simply test if it works by copying the \"data\" directory to the newly extracted kanboard installation. I'd suggest keeping a safe copy of your complete production kanboard folder to be able to restore it if any issues occur.\nhowever all user-data is stored in the \"data\" directory and should be interchangable between different versions.\nWe delete that backup with every new successful installation :+1: \n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n. > Change sidebar style\n\nSeems non-elegant for the text to jump to another position when the cursor gets near.

Then the overlapping starts again.\na \"margin-bottom: 10px\" in every element looks great on most widths.\nbelow a width of 418px the ul class\"views\" starts wrapping itself. I'm unable to fix this through the css styles.\n\nThis does not happen with the filter box although the left Item of the wrapped filter-box is missing it's left border.\nupdated kanboardversion:\nApplication version: 1.0.32\nPHP version: 7.0.7\nPHP SAPI: cgi-fcgi\nOS version: Windows NT 6.3\nDatabase driver: sqlite\nDatabase version: 3.8.10.2\nBrowser: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/52.0.2743.116 Safari/537.36\n. :+1: \n. :+1: \n.

One thing to add here maybe:\nI updated from version 1.0.29 directly to 1.0.31. I'm unsure if this already happened before the update, but I always keep a backup of the previous version.\n. # deprecated\nread next posts instead.\n\nI updated the php and sqlite version through the iis web-platform installer to\nApplication version: 1.0.31\nPHP version: 7.0.7\nPHP SAPI: cgi-fcgi\nOS version: Windows NT 6.3\nDatabase driver: sqlite\nDatabase version: 3.8.10.2\nbut this still happens.\nI also tried to debug the query with var_dump() to see if I could find the error, but I'm unable to find the faulty query in the mass of the output: \nhttp://pastebin.com/gkqyyceb\nFor this output, I manipulated the Paginator.php:\n```\npublic function executeQuery()\n    {\n        if ($this->query !== null) {\n            echo '';\n        $array = $this->query\n                        ->offset($this->offset)\n                        ->limit($this->limit)\n                        ->orderBy($this->order, $this->direction);\n           var_dump($array);\n            echo '';\n            return $array->findAll();\n        }\n    return array();\n}\n\n```\n. so by var_dump-ing in the findall() method I was able to retrieve the query:\nSELECT tasks.id, tasks.title, tasks.date_due, tasks.date_creation, tasks.project_id, tasks.color_id, tasks.priority, tasks.time_spent, tasks.time_estimated, tasks.is_active, tasks.creator_id, projects.name AS project_name, columns.title AS column_title FROM \"tasks\" LEFT JOIN \"projects\" ON \"projects\".\"id\"=\"tasks\".\"project_id\" LEFT JOIN \"columns\" ON \"columns\".\"id\"=\"tasks\".\"column_id\" WHERE tasks.owner_id = ? AND tasks.is_active = ? AND projects.is_active = ? ORDER BY \"title\" ASC LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0\n. without ORDER BY \"title\" the statement executes while the leftjoin on \"columns\" is in the query. With ORDER BY \"task.title\" it always works.\n. works with 1.0.32\n. I think the user name at this position could be removed completely since the user menu is always available in the topleft corner.\n. Hey! We just switched to using the priority value. Can you share your plugin?. At the moment I use a simple SQL Statement if requested:\nsql\nupdate tasks\nset position=3-priority\nwhere 3 = numbers of priorities - 1 \n(we use P0 for Low priority and P3 for critical tasks).

Ah now I understand your issue.\nWell that's just how the filter works.\nIt does not look for subtaskassignments yet if you filter for your assigned tasks.\nCould be a featurerequest / improvement.\n. Subtasks should not appear in any swimlane at all.\nWhere do you see the subtasks? In Boardview (with all other swimlanes). Or dou you look at them in the dashboard?\nThe dashboard does not care about swimlanes and just displays all tasks that are assigned to you.\n. This can be closed with version 1.0.43..

Hey @fguillot \nWe're experiencing the same issue.\nWe're at 1110 closed tasks. Listview is still working.\nThe limit seems be 1000. 998 tasks are displayed correctly.\nthis also happens if the tasks are open. > You could uncheck temporarily the checkbox \"Remote User\" to update the username.\nHow would this update the username?\nI agree that the situations are rare but they do occur.\nHowever I did not see any drawbacks/sideeffects that would disallow enabling administrators to change the logins. Kanboard only supports incremental updates.\nSo you have to update from Version 1.0.31 to 1.0.32, then from 1.0.32 to 1.0.33 and so on.\n@fguillot maybe add this bit of information to https://kanboard.net/documentation/update. This also happens to me.\nI had an automatic action that moved tasks that were moved into this colum into another project. Now I can't delete the column.\nIn the boardview, the column shows 0 tasks.\nIn the Settings the column shows 14 open tasks.\nI will resolve this in the database..

I haven't had time to isolate the problem.\n. @dalenoe  Okay, so I took a look at the source and reread the docs, and it was a misunderstanding on my part. Gitlab auth is on a strictly per user basis. It is up the the user or admin to link their account. It does not create accounts. Did you link the account?\n. Made the changes.

    "databigot": "So, I'm trying to solve this too by hacking something together.\nOriginally I attacked the Notification code, but now I'm having second thoughts:\nI'm wondering if this could be solved by creating some actions such as \"app/Action/NotifyAssignee\" and \"app/Action/NotifyAdmin\" which could be triggered by setting up Automated Action on Event TASK::EVENT_ASSIGNEE_CHANGE.  \nWhat do you think?\n. @ftoulouse: I have thought about this before.  The problem, as i see it is that different projects may have different columns defined.  Therefore it would make it difficult to show them on the same board.  My feeling about this, is that the projects that I would like to see on the same board, actually fall into the same \"category\" of project, and having common columns across them is a desirable thing.  So, my approach is to actually define the structure for a \"category\" of project: automatic actions, columns, etc.  Then any project of that \"category\" shares the same structure and can be shown on a common board.\nAnyway, those are my thoughts.  I have not tried building it yet. \n. very nice @ftoulouse.  That was the one i forgot: \"swimlanes must match\".   I look forward to reading your proposed feature!\nAnother way to solve it would be to turn the current model on its head: make Boards the highest level entity, and then define the Projects within their Board.  The Board would define the \"layout\", having a defined set of Columns, Swimlanes, and automatic actions. A Project would be simpler, merely a \"child\" of only a single Board, and \"inherit\" the Colums, Swimlanes, unchangable!  may also inherit User set, and Automatic Actions.\nThis design would limit certain things: one project on multiple boards, project specific logic -- but it closely fits my requirements.\nAnyway, would probably require too much refactoring across the whole system.\n-databigot \n.

As the element \"task (title)\" is missing - it is not instantly visible to wich task the subtask belongs.\nExample: You have 30 assigned tasks for which you have to collect - as a subtask -  the requirements. So the subtask will be (30 times) \"collect requirments\". In the dashboard view it is not possible to distinguish between the different tasks, as there will be 30 times \"collect requirements\".\nThe combination from assignee and subtask title is not (logically) unique in a project, while the combination assignee-task-subtask title is a candidate for a unique statement.\nTo improve this, I would recommend to have an additional column \"task title\" after \"project\" in the dashboard element \"My Subtasks\"\n.

IMHO, a web responsive UI rather than a native app has more luck to be available with less effort, less testing (each size, eatch device, each version of OS, localizatiom, distribution/ delivery via app-stores) and with all features quickly available rather than a native app.\nPlus we don't know which super new device will be here in 2-3 years.\nAlso remember that via web UI, you develop once for all.\nNative apps make sense when you have to work with information within the device, that is when security profile of web is not enough because you want to access user's data.\nSo if you need to access in RW mode to addressbook, calendar, images and device owner contents on the device, then app is the right choice.\nIf the issue is performance and speed, then a good caching of static contents really makes the difference.\nSo this was my 2 cents voting for web UI :-)\n. edit: app/Template/task/description.php\nChange line:\n            <?= $this->text->markdown($task['description'], isset($is_public) && $is_public) ?>\nTo:\n            <?= nl2br($this->text->markdown($task['description'], isset($is_public) && $is_public)) ?>\n.

SOLVED issue on error: I missed config.default.php in the kanboard folder\nShould maybe return a different error in case configuration is not present\nAnyway, launching the cronjob via URL is imho still a good way to simple installation for who has not console access\n. Kanboard allows to create tasks sending emails.\nYou need to install and configure a mail service (such as mailgun plugin) and follow instructions.\nhttps://kanboard.net/plugin/mailgun\n. Thank you, I was thinking something similar too, but I'm adding a question for WIP.\nLet's say I have a WIP limit of 3 for a column in the default swimlane; if I create another swimlane, I would end up with a WIP of 6 in the column (3 default swimlane + 3 new swimlane)\nThe WIP should instead be calculated \"per column\", which sums the tasks for each swim lane.\nWith multiple projects you would end up with many swimlanes and you WIP of 3 multiplied by the number, but that doesn't encrease your WIP power (unless you hire new people when a project is assigned)\n. WIP is \"Work In Progress\", the root of the Kanban Board is limiting the number of things (WIP Limit) you can do before pulling another thing to work at.\nKanbard allow to set WIP Limit \"per swimlane\" column, while it should add it \"per project\".\n. I've been thinking a little of what would it be the right fix.\nLet's say you have elements:\n1,2,3,4,5\nAnd use a filter on \"odd\" you would see\n1,3,5 because these are your items while my items are pair.\nThen you decide to change you order between 5 and 3 because YOUR priorities\nare changed.\nWhat you would see is:\n1,5,3\nBut if you remove the filter the result would be 1,2,5,3,4\nSo my order priority isn't changed (2,4) but the overall project has\nchanged.\nSo the question is: what is the behaviour expected when no filters are\napplied of changes set when filter is on ?\nJulien\nIl giorno sab 28 gen 2017 alle 17:34 Willem Oosting \nnotifications@github.com ha scritto:\n\nIs this something we can expect to be picked up, it's pretty close to the\ncore and reproduces 100% (at least drop the unable to reproduce bug\nlabel)?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/issues/2681#issuecomment-275858274,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAH4ijC_QDWRsznY_S0jZqxn37bNnWuCks5rW24UgaJpZM4KBYfD\n.\n-- \n\nJulien Buratto\nAmministratore\nLinkas Srl\np: +390230321419  m: +393356359515\nf: +390240700321\na: Via Cartesio 2\n  20124 - Milan (MI)\nw: www.linkas.it  e: julien@linkas.it\nhttp://julien.burat.to/\n.

I've been thinking a lot of this issue and I came out with the simplest thing I could:\n\nissue) when a filter is applied, drag&drop actions bring to unexpected positioning of filtered items\nexpected) if I have filtered list 1,3,5,7,9,11 and want to move 7 one step up, I expect 1,3,7,5,9,11\nunexpected) sometimes if you drop 7 element between 3 and 5 and you get it somewhere else 7,1,3,5,9,11\n\nTwo things should happen really:\n1. Dropping an element must result in the right position when filter is applied, so the whatever are the hidden elements, the filtered order must be respected. No surprises to eyes :-)\n2. When filter is removed, the dropped item(s) should be put on top of the least brick\nEXAMPLE (fruits and vegs):\n- Banana\n- Apple\n- Asparagus\n- Bean\n- Apricot\n- Blackberry\n- Broccoli\nLet's filter out vegs:\n- Banana\n- Apple\n- Apricot\n- Blackberry => I want to move this between Apple and Apricot\nExpected filtered:\n- Banana\n- Apple\n- Blackberry => Filtered result is respected\n- Apricot\nExpected unfiltered:\n- Banana\n- Apple\n- Asparagus\n- Bean\n- Blackberry => Unfiltered: Blackberry in on top of Apricot (see below) \n- Apricot\n- Broccoli\nBlackberry is still between Apricot and Apple (as expected when filter is applied), but the overall order isn't changed because Blackberry is below all vegs between Apricot and Apple, ie attached to the last (less important) fruit, ie Apricot \n@fguillot could you please give me a hint where I can find the right files to change ?\nI could try to implement this and test for a while before proposing the change\nJulien. @woosting thank you for your thinking, the idea of \"on top of least\" and \"below the best\" is very worth!\nSo just to recap:\n- when filtered, position must be respected when moving\n- when unfiltered: \n-- if moved upwards, but below all hidden but on top of last shown\n-- if moved downwards, but on top all hidden but below first shown\n@fguillot I've a doubt: if you hide a column, drag&dropping becomes \"crazy\" even if no filters are applied, could this \"filter\" issue AND \"hidden column issue\" be part of the same overall problem ?. Anyway, just checking the code, it seems that the UI passes a position which is relative (to the filter), while ajax save action uses it as an absolute value...\nUPDATED: A part from any ordering behaviour, the issue seems to be the fact that TaskPositionModel does not take in account the fact that a filter is applied when tasks are moved.\nUPDATED: So I have a piece of code which seems to be working but unfortunately works only on filters based on users (assignee).

In my company we are testing and we haven't found any issue right know, so we are pretty happy and motivated :-)\nA more practical example would be appreciated. So just to explain the current patch (not 100% perfect, I agree) works like this:\nOriginally the move process was done by querying the list of tasks in a column, then shift the rest +1 and insert the item in the choosen position. Any filter was not taken in account during the move, but only in the view.\nWhat I've done is just to apply the filter also to the query of the move, so basically the new position is calculated by shifting +1 only the returning items to the filtered query.\nThis gives a problem: items not filtered are not considered at all so all the shown items are shifted +1 while the non-filtered items are not shifted +1\nBasically is like having a list of tasks (filtered) sliding on the other tasks (unfiltered)\nJ. I've tried to fix to a better status but don't have time these weeks, I might work on it during summer holidays.\nIf you feel that this patch doesn't break anyother piece of code, I could ask to pull it.. \nI my mind I was hoping for an help from @fguillot to definitely fix it  :-)\nSo as help it's not coming, let's push it like this and see if I can (or someone else) fix it before next release.. It seems that I made a mess with github and I'm not able to pull the request without pullin other things..\nsad :-(. @Kulicke-and-Soffa currently my changes are into a single pull-request that contains multiple changes and I don't know how to split into a single pull-request per each feature so I'm blocked.. @seanxlliu thanks! it seems that it was not included in 1.2.0 release.. was it accepted ?.

Infact we have noticed that setting colors on a expired tasks would changed the \"modified\" date so basically another action would not work as expected.. I would love to, but don't know how to separate PRs. Issue checked - old tasks dont include tags - ew tasks include tags. Sorry but I want to add columns to the CSV data, don't want to change the look and feel of the form asking for the start-end date for the query.\nTo me it appears that the code in ExportController calls \"common\" who passes $data to the HTTP \"response\" object which sends headers and transform the array \"$data\" into a CSV content.\nThis approach is not an MVC approach as all application's output should pass by View.\nHope that Frederic can help, maybe there is a quicker way @fguillot \n.

The AGPL license is basically an extortion license.

This could opens a ludicrous amount of liability for any network based system which even communicates with AGPL code (something yet to be tested in court, but could in theory be extended to include even web browsers).   I know of a company that this has happened to and it effectively devastated them (lost a round of funding, still in a legal battle with the troll who picked up the project).

No.  We have no plans or desire to provide this as a service (free or paid), or to include it in any other product or service offering.  This would be for internal use only on our internal network (i.e not available via the public internet).  We would, however, like to make integrations to internal tools (such as updates and pulls from our custom internal defect tracking system) to make it truly effective for us.  Given the language in the license and the understanding of our organizations attorney (who actually deals w/ open source quite a lot), the license\u2019s reach is overly broad and can require any integrations and any system to which said integrations have been made to be published or potentially subject to claims (putting our internal tools at risk and, potentially, anything that might connect with them).  While this may never be something planned by the current folks owning rights, someone else might later acquire rights and attempt to enforce them (which is something I have knowledge of occurring when a project was \u201ccommercialized\u201d by it\u2019s creator, AGPL introduced in a point release, and then later said \u201ccommercialization attempt went bankrupt and the rights for the software sold off to a patent troll).  That risk is not something that my organization is willing to accept.  Therefore, the only way my organization can use this is to do so under another license that doesn\u2019t include AGPL reference.  Any of the following could work: a change of the current open source license, availability under more than one license (GPL v2 or AGPL), or under a separate commercial use license.\n\nCheers\n\nOn Jun 22, 2015, at 2:08 AM, el.nicko notifications@github.com wrote:\nghostlurker, \nAFAICS AGPL does not restrict usage, only commercialization.

This machine can be a NAS (QNAP or Synology for example), a server or a simple raspberry Pi if you don't want to have a big computer for it.\nwhy do you want to put it on the same machine? (because you need it when you are on road or because you don't want to have an other computer for it?)\n. would be very interesting to mix both world.\nI actually use GLPI for inventory and I use Kanboard for ticketing because it's more user friendly and other users use it for the rest of tasks management of the company.\nIt would be great to make a plugin that can synchronize both solutions but there will be a huge work because many fields would need to be added on Kanboard side.\nI will try during my holidays to add some fields on Kanboard to fit my needs but synchronization with GLPI will need more programming skills that I have.\nIf someone with the necessary programming skills is interested to do the job, I will be happy to help with the design (I know both solutions and what fields need to be synchronized) and documentation.\n. @rvechere, we are a small company (about 40 users) and I am the only IT guy. I have tried to do other products for ticketing but nobody, but me, use it. GLPI is really interesting for ticketing but the kanboard view is more useful for me and other people are using kanboard for other things inside the company so they are more lickly to use it to fill a ticket.\nAt the beginning I have made 2 different projects for change request, and incidents management but it's confusing for users so I now only have 1 project for everything. \nI think kanboard is not ready for such use if you are a \"big\" company, with many IT guy and need to manage hundred tickets a day but it cover my needs. The only downside is that, for now, I can't link it to a resource (the computer with Serial Number XYZ for example) or create a ticket on a behalf of an other person.\nI have the same problem as you, I am a sysadmin with scripting skills but not programming skills (I understand PHP but have difficulty to write it, particularly when you use object programming, ...)\n. Hi,\nBecause it's perhaps not an ALL USERS need, it would perhaps be more interesting to add this as a Plugin.\nThere will be many advantage on this. The first one is to resolve the need of this ticket, the second is to make a plugin that will allow people to use it as a base (to develop an other plugin) for other special requirements.\nRegards\n. We use it to manage tasks for our production/R&D/SAV/Software_dev and I personnaly use it for IT ticketing (there is still some features missing for having a good ticketing system but I am the only IT guy so it's OK).\n. Hi,\nI think it can be seen as a duplicate https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/issues/1637. Perhaps a possibility to add many users with different functions. But I still think it must be as a form of a plugin.\n. Hi,\nThanks a lot I will try this next week.\nAn other concern is that it go to the default Swimlane (also if she is hided).\nBest regards\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-mailgun/issues/4\n. I also get a problem there with the move to other project action. I have 4 Swimlane (3 custom + 1 default) and get only 3 of them (2 custom + 1 default).\n. :+1: \n. Hi, I also add this problem, ... But forget to fill a bug for it there.\nIn my case I comment the line 40 of /PATH_TO_YOUR_KANBOARD_INSTALLATION/app/Schema/Mysql.php and it worked. It blocked because the column is already existing.\nfunction version_102(PDO $pdo)\n{\n    //$pdo->exec(\"ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN owner_id INT DEFAULT 0\");\n}\n. Me too\n. It would be a great improvement, possibly as a plugin.\n. Hi,\nNo need to install them, it's already installed but your Include line does the work. Thank you.\n. I did a migration from SQLite to MySQL a long time ago. Perhaps there is errors in my SQL schema, ...\nAny tools to check the SQL tables integrity?. someone has created a \"Default Swimlane\" on a Project, ... It's the reason of the upgrade problem.\nThanks a lot for your help. You will have to check in the table Swimlanes that there is no Swimlane with the name \"Default Swimlane\". ",

Not intending to offend you, but you see this only from your needs and perspective. A project management program needs to be a little bit more flexible.\nMotive for my request is very simple:\n1. Efficiency, project members can see and focus only on what they need to do, not what other needs to do.\n2. Avoid confusion, I think it's self explaining.\n3. Security of project data.\nAnd of course there are lots of other reasons, that can be punctual/project based reason. For example protecting some data about expenses and costs or other project based private data, that you need to discuss only with project managers. Sure, we can make new project for that only with project managers, but it's stupid to open a new project that is about another project.\nJust my 2 cents here.\n. @froschdesign sure, a plugin system sound very good idea. Can you build my above request? Can we talk about costs, etc?\nThanks\n. @sparkles645 thanks for the suggestion, it's a good option on a short run, but on the long run where you or me or anyone will start to have more and more projects this is just a shortcut that doesn't solve the problem. As I said, I'm offering to pay the cost for the requested feature to have it build inside kanboard so everybody can benefit from it. \nPlease let me know anyone here who can get it done. Thanks\n. @fguillot any news on this request? I stopped using Kandoard because of this issue \nThanks\n. Thanks @froschdesign I appreciate that :)\n. @dhornford @aljawaid @fguillot the Permissions for a Project & Users/Groups as an admin is a great improvement and I really appreciate it, but we are 1 single step behind, and that's a way to allow tasks to be view only by specific members. \nIn actual situation we can only limit users per project, but we can't limit them to view, open tasks that are not for them. If we have to work only with 1 single department per each project the above solution is ok, but in situations when multiple departments work on a client project (it, design, marketing, external assistants, etc..) and also offer option to client to view status of his project we can't make only one project per client because we will mix them together, and just moving one task from a column to another by accident will make problems. Not to mention that external assistants will have access to all tasks.....\nA simple implementation can solve all the above problems:\n1. Assign a task to a member ( we already have this). By default he will have access to edit/view this task.\n2. An option to allow to view and/or edit per task to: groups, members we do select. Can be 1 or multiple.\n3. For option#2 also to have option to give permissions to edit OR only view that task ( a simple checkbox with default = edit) \nOption nr2 will solve all the problems. We can tag a group or specific members who have access to see/edit that task, select permission for that task if the default option is not ok, DONE.. Good point @filhocf  , and maybe this feature will also be back into interest https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/issues/992#issuecomment-298234563 .

    "psy-q": "Take a look at #1158.. I have started on something. It seems to work so far. I will try to bring it into a form that would make an acceptable pull request.. Appears to be a duplicate of #2832. The issue is still there. It might be nice to have an approach similar to Trello, where clicking in the background allows dragging the entire page horizontally and vertically.. We have the same issue, and we do use LDAP group synchronization. Maybe Kanboard could keep track of whether a user that originally came from LDAP has been changed manually, and then ignore certain attributes (such as role)?\nMaybe this is also a duplicate of #2540.. Thanks for the reply. It doesn't look so good, though:\n\nI can't test without SSL because in our environment it's not allowed, but I'll try to scare up someone who could perhaps make an exception.\nYes, it was executed on the same machine. Once via Apache, once via command line. Both times it connected.\nI'm not sure about that because I'm a Linux guy and the AD infrastructure is in the hands of other people. But I'll try to find out.. I can meanwhile say that it works without SSL.. Yes, without SSL it works. The only change to the configuration above is to use port 389. All four attempts then work. Manager and admin group matching works, as does group searching in the permission field. I found the logs somewhere in the Kanboard directory (I don't have access to the server on weekends but can verify on monday. Also, you can enable debug mode in the config file).. I think you're asking about general LDAP configuration, but this ticket is about problems connecting with AD over SSL. You need the group filter string if you want to use groups, but not for authentication in general, that should work without. The reverse proxy settings should have nothing to do with LDAP as far as I know.. Thanks, adding the ldaps:// schema before the FQDN worked for me. From the name LDAP_SERVER I thought that constant was only for the server name, not for a URI. But with a URI, using port 636 and LDAP_START_TLS set to false, it works.. This seems to be a very hard thing to do for some reason. Even some dedicated drag & drop JavaScript libraries have not managed to accomplish this despite four separate attempts over the course of one year. \n\nI will research a little bit whether a solution that fits only Kanboard (not a general use case) would be doable.. I'm seeing something similar but I'm not sure if it's the same. If a user is manually set to admin but is also in the group that is specified as manager group, the manager role will overwrite the admin role on login.. This is getting increasingly inconvenient for us, since even e.g. manager roles assigned to a user who logs in via LDAP are overwritten with normal user privileges the next time the user logs in.. And/or maybe a new setting like \"Add new cards at [top|bottom] of the column\" might be useful? We answered a few user requests saying that cards weren't added because users don't realize that they're added on the bottom.\nOf course it makes little sense in the logic of Kanban because you should probably not add new work that is more important than any of the previous planned work, but I guess that's what people do.. Just separate them into different branches (don't do everything on master). It's good practice anyway because if you break the build you can tell which feature introduced the problem.. Ah yes, I just meant that many people choose an image that has been blurred (in e.g. Gimp) for the background, so it visually interferes less, but I wouldn't suggest doing the blurring inside the browser. Even though on many browser/GPU combinations that effect should be hardware-accelerated, but that's taking it way too far.\nMy idea would be similar to Trello, where you can upload any image and it is simply placed in the background and stretched to cover the whole area, aspect ratio permitting.. With the referenced PR the tables now have the correct IDs even with e.g. auto_increment_increment set to 4 and it should work fine on any cluster:\nMariaDB [kanboard]> show variables like '%auto_increment%';\n+------------------------------+-------+\n| Variable_name                | Value |\n+------------------------------+-------+\n| auto_increment_increment     | 4     |\n| auto_increment_offset        | 1     |\n| wsrep_auto_increment_control | ON    |\n+------------------------------+-------+\nMariaDB [kanboard]> select * from links;\n+----+-------------------+-------------+\n| id | label             | opposite_id |\n+----+-------------------+-------------+\n|  1 | relates to        |           0 |\n|  5 | blocks            |           9 |\n|  9 | is blocked by     |           5 |\n| 13 | duplicates        |          17 |\n| 17 | is duplicated by  |          13 |\n| 21 | is a parent of    |          25 |\n| 25 | is a child of     |          21 |\n| 29 | is a milestone of |          33 |\n| 33 | targets milestone |          29 |\n| 37 | is fixed by       |          41 |\n| 41 | fixes             |          37 |\n+----+-------------------+-------------+. creecros mentioned it should go into a new version_. I can revert the changes to version_46 and make a separate migration out of it, if you like?\nIt won't be possible to do in the mysql.sql dump of course. I don't know how a cluster reacts to loading that dump -- do the static IDs from the dump stay the same even though they are marked as auto_increment primary keys? I could test that next week.. I've seen it used elsewhere: https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/master/app/Schema/Migration.php#L70  I thought maybe you prefer to abstract it this way.. Great, thanks a lot!

    "iaanus": "+1\n. Hi Chaosmeister, all you said is correct, in fact I said the very same thing in my suggestion #3 above. My point is that having a column that will always be empty simply to create a drop area for closing bugs is a waste of horizontal space. If we could collapse a column (like you can collapse a swimlane) then it would be much better. I could live with that, even without #1.\n. Hi fguillot, I just upgraded to 1.0.18 and... wow, it's amazing how many improvements you put in every new release! Thanks a lot! The \"hide column\" feature is very much appreciated (although I'd rather call it \"collapse column\" since the column remain visible, which is good). Given this new feature, I'd like to replace this feature request of mine to this:\n- please allow moving a task into a hidden/collapsed column\n. Marking as closed. The feature has been implemented in v1.0.24.\n. A sort of \"bulk\" Close Tasks action has already been implemented. See #1056\n. Problem also present with Firefox 43 and 44.\n. I don't think the problem has anything to do with line 24 of file assets/js/src/Dropdown.js, but rather with the if-else block at line 29-34 of that file. That block checks if the dropdown extends down beyond the bottom of the canvas, in which case it displays the dropdown above and upward the anchor point. This behavior is incorrect when the dropdown is tall, since it makes the dropdown extend above the top of the canvas. \n. > First, the initials are still the wrong way round (\"BS\" rather than \"SB\")\nI also hate the AD/LDAP default setting of having SURNAME FIRSTNAME. To overcome this, I made a minor tweak in function createLdapUser() that swaps SURNAME and FIRSTNAME.

Confirming the issue. I went through the same sequence of events when trying to get plugins working with version 1.0.20.\nAfter performing a new installation and using config.default.php as the initial base for the config.php file, installing a plugin is not as simple as uncompressing the plugin archive into the plugin folder. Because the plugins folder is located at the root of the app folder, but by default, the PLUGINS_DIR variable points to the plugin folder being located under the data folder.\n// Plugins directory\ndefine('PLUGINS_DIR', 'data'.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'plugins');\nThis suggests that the plugins folder should be moved to under the data folder.  But that results in an error.\nThe fix is to change the PLUGINS_DIR variable in the config.default.php/config.php file to:\n// Plugins directory\ndefine('PLUGINS_DIR', 'plugins');\n. +1\n. How about user configuration?   You did not mention any details about user configuration.\nKanboard configuration\n1.Be sure that your users have an email address in their profiles\n2.Assign a project identifier to the desired projects: Project settings > Edit\n3.Try to send an email to your project: something+myproject@mydomain.tld\nNOTE: The sender email address must be same as the user profile email address in Kanboard and the user must be member of the project.\n\nAnother thing to check is that the sender address is the address that you expect.  Some automated systems may have a SENDER address that is different than the FROM address that email programs display.  For example, I discovered this when I configured Toodledo to send reminders to my Kanboard.  Toodledo is using Amazon Web Services to send emails, and each email is sent with a randomized sender address.   Check in the Mailgun logs and verify the sender address matches the email address for a user in your Kanboard, and the user is a member of the project.\nExample of sender address not matching from address:\n\n. It could be routing.  The config will vary depending on the version of Kanboard that you are running, as well as the version of Mailgun.\n- What is the string that shows in Integrations for Mailgun?  Settings / Integrations.  This is the string to  enter into Mailgun for the route.  (If you reply back here, leave off the token, of course.)\n- What is the version number of Kanboard?   Settings / About.\n- What is the version number of the Mailgun plugin?   Settings / Plugins.\nAt this time, there is no need to bother with opening up https on your firewall.  That is not the issue.  Http is working fine.\nThe question still remains if the email address for your user account matches the sender address.\nIn User Management, the email address showing beside your account is the same address that is in the Mailgun screenshot above?    (Just checking.)\nI think you are close.  Mailgun seems to be working.  Just need to get the route action right now.\n. The config.php Mailgun variables are only used for sending mail.  They are not used for receiving.  If you are only using the Mailgun plugin for receiving, none of the Mailgun variables need to be defined in config.php.\nIt's curious that Mailgun is not showing in the Integrations screen.  It should be.\nDelete the Mailgun folder under the plugins folder.  Download the latest release of the Mailgun plugin (v1.0.2) and extract into the plugins folder.\nCheck if that resolves Mailgun not showing in the Integrations screen.\nIn Mailgun, define your route action as follows:\nhttp://nas.idevlop.com/kanboard/?controller=webhook&action=receiver&plugin=mailgun&token=\n(insert your token at the end)\n\nIf that doesn't resolve the issue, turn on debugging in config.php.\n// Enable/Disable debug\ndefine('DEBUG', true);\nOnce debugging is set to true, send an email to the Mailgun address and wait about 6 minutes.  Then check in the data folder for a file named debug.log.  Debug.log is verbose.  Search for \"mailgun.\"  \nReminder: set debug to false when done debugging.\n. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, thank you for the prompt fix.  I have tested it, and it resolves the issues that I reported.\n. Thank you.  Closing issue.\n. Seems as though the database schema did not update the actions table when you upgraded. \nHere are a couple of options that you can try:\nOption 1:\n- Make a backup of your current data directory.\n- Fall back to the non-fix release.  http://kanboard.net/kanboard-1.0.23.zip  Use the upgrade instructions.\n- With 1.0.23 running, verify that the error no longer appears when moving tasks to the column that previously triggered the error.\n- If no error, then upgrade to v1.0.23-fix1.\nNot sure if this will work because it is unknown why the schema did not get updated when you upgraded from v1.0.22 to v1.0.23-fix1.\nOption 2:\n- Remove all of the automatic actions that you have defined, and recreate them again manually.\n. Option 3:   :)\nIf you are comfortable opening the database with a program like SQLiteStudio (http://sqlitestudio.pl/), you can try adjusting the database manually.\nOpen the actions table:\nChange the data from:  TaskAssignColorColumn\nChange to: \\Kanboard\\Action\\TaskAssignColorColumn\nIt should look like this:\n\n. Hmm.  Using a fresh test installation of Kanboard 1.0.22, and I tested with the string provided and had no issue with preview, saving, or editing.   \nPossible issue with your web browser or something unique to your installation/environment?   I tested in Edge and IE11.\n\n. Which database are you using?   MySQL, SQLite, or Postgres.\n. Click: Actions --> Settings\n-- Click: Automatic Actions\n-- From the dropdown list, select: Assign a color to a specific user\n-- Click Next Step....\n. Sorting was broken with commit 4003b122d085b58ad7acb31bafa44121ed94c37f (released in v1.0.23).  \nConsider the following board setup and task moves. All the steps below were done consecutively in the order presented.\n\nDrag T1 to under T5 (Position 5):\n\nDrag T1 to under T2 (Position 2):\n\nDrag T1 to under T4 (Position 4):\n\nDrag T1 to under T4 (Position 4) again:\n\nDrag T1 to above T2 (Position 1):\n\nDrag T1 to under T5 (Position 5):\n\n. If the file /app/Model/TaskPosition.php is reverted back to the version from release 1.0.22, sorting works flawlessly again.\n. Based on the information provided:\n- Tried upgrading kanboard today but failed. \n- Did not touch the original kanboard directory under /var/www/html. \nIt sounds as though the problem is that the Kanboard installation is in an inconsistent state, which is confirmed by the error message.  The database schema was updated, but the Kanboard files are an earlier version.\nHopefully you made a database backup prior to attempting to upgrade.\nA couple options:\nOption 1 - Restore the database back to prior to the upgrade. If the database is restored back, and the files are the same as before, then Kanboard should be back to a working state. \nOption 2 - Rename /var/www/html/kanboard to /var/www/html/kanboard-backup.\n               - Unzip the latest release to /var/www/html/kanboard.\n               - Copy /var/www/html/kanboard-backup/config.php to /var/www/html/kanboard/\nThe idea with option 2 is to get the latest release files in the proper place.  The cause of the error message is that /kanboard/app/Action/TaskAssignCurrentUserColumn.php is missing, which you confirmed by saying \"I did not touch the original Kanboard directory.\"   To resolve the error, you will need to have the latest release files in place, or restore back the database.\nNot sure why the upgrade might have failed.  Did you receive any error messages?\n. Hello. My name is Jason. I will assist you with this issue. \nAre you saying that you searched the debug log for 'Sendgrid' and found no entries?\nThese are the three possible debug lines that are written by the Sendgrid plugin:\n- SendgridWebhook: ignored => user not found\n- SendgridWebhook: ignored => project not found\n- SendgridWebhook: ignored => user is not member of the project\nIf you found none of the above, then there are other things to consider, such as the subject line is empty.\n- Edit the EmailHandler.php file in the plugins/Sendgrid folder.\n- Add the following line at the beginning of the receiveEmail function:\n$this->logger->debug('SendgridWebhook: verification => in the receiveEmail function');\nIt should look like this:\n``` php\npublic function receiveEmail(array $payload) \n{ \n        $this->logger->debug('SendgridWebhook: verification => in the receiveEmail function');\n     if (empty($payload['envelope']) || empty($payload['subject'])) { \n         return false; \n     }\n\n     $envelope = json_decode($payload['envelope'], true); \n     $sender = isset($envelope['to'][0]) ? $envelope['to'][0] : '';\n\n```\nSend an email in again and check the debug log.  Search for: SendgridWebhook.\nDid you find a line now?  If not, we can be confident that the plugin is not being called. That would be a curious head scratcher. But try the steps suggested above and let me know what you find.\n. As a reference, check out config.default.php.  That file should be your guide on setting the config variables.  It is possible for changes to occur with each release, so it's valuable to compare config.php with config.default.php any time you upgrade.\nThe values from the current release config.default.php:\nphp\n// Debug file path \ndefine('DEBUG_FILE', __DIR__.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'data'.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'debug.log'); \n// Plugins directory \ndefine('PLUGINS_DIR', 'plugins'); \n// Folder for uploaded files \ndefine('FILES_DIR', 'data'.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'files');\n- What version of Kanboard are you running?  (Settings / About)  1.0.24 is the latest version.\n- What version of the Sendgrid plugin? (Settings / Plugins) 1.0.2 is the latest version.\nThe plugins API in Kanboard is young. It is considered to be in ALPHA status, and there have been significant changes over the last couple releases. As a general rule, any time there is a new Kanboard release, check the plugins that you are using to see if they have been updated.\nIn your case, we have confirmed that the Sendgrid receiveEmail function is not being called.  Something basic is not working, \nDouble-check that the Kanboard webhook url displayed in Settings > Integrations > Sendgrid matches what you have entered in Sendgrid configuration page.   \nAnd let us know about the version numbers.\n. Either the FROM is empty, SUBJECT is empty, or MailboxHash is empty.\nModify the beginning of the receiveEmail function to look like this, and then check the debug log after sending in another email:\n``` php\npublic function receiveEmail(array $payload) \n{ \n    if (empty($payload['From'])) { \n        $this->logger->debug('Postmark: ignored => From not found');\n    return false; \n    } elseif (empty($payload['Subject'])) {\n    $this->logger->debug('Postmark: ignored => Subject not found');\n    return false; \n    } elseif (empty($payload['MailboxHash'])) {\n    $this->logger->debug('Postmark: ignored => MailboxHash not found');\n    return false; \n    }\n// The user must exists in Kanboard \n$user = $this->user->getByEmail($payload['From']);\n\n```\n. I ran into the same issue, and modified the EmailHandler receiveEmail function to make it more to my liking.  \nWhile waiting for an official fix, if you are feeling adventurous, give this a try.\n- Edit /kanboard/plugins/Mailgun/EmailHandler.php\n- Replace with the following.\n``` php\n<?php\nnamespace Kanboard\\Plugin\\Mailgun;\nrequire_once DIR.'/vendor/autoload.php';\nuse Kanboard\\Core\\Base;\nuse Kanboard\\Core\\Tool;\nuse Kanboard\\Core\\Mail\\ClientInterface;\nuse League\\HTMLToMarkdown\\HtmlConverter;\ndefined('MAILGUN_API_TOKEN') or define('MAILGUN_API_TOKEN', '');\ndefined('MAILGUN_DOMAIN') or define('MAILGUN_DOMAIN', '');\n/\n * Mailgun Mail Handler\n \n * @package  mailgun\n * @author   Frederic Guillot\n /\nclass EmailHandler extends Base implements ClientInterface\n{\n    /\n     * Send a HTML email\n     \n     * @access public\n     * @param  string  $email\n     * @param  string  $name\n     * @param  string  $subject\n     * @param  string  $html\n     * @param  string  $author\n     /\n    public function sendEmail($email, $name, $subject, $html, $author)\n    {\n        $headers = array(\n            'Authorization: Basic '.base64_encode('api:'.MAILGUN_API_TOKEN)\n        );\n    $payload = array(\n        'from' => sprintf('%s <%s>', $author, MAIL_FROM),\n        'to' => sprintf('%s <%s>', $name, $email),\n        'subject' => $subject,\n        'html' => $html,\n    );\n\n    $this->httpClient->postForm('https://api.mailgun.net/v3/'.MAILGUN_DOMAIN.'/messages', $payload, $headers);\n}\n\n/**\n * Parse incoming email\n *\n * @access public\n * @param  array   $payload   Incoming email\n * @return boolean\n */\npublic function receiveEmail(array $payload)\n{\n    if (empty($payload['sender']) || empty($payload['subject']) || empty($payload['recipient'])) {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // The user must exists in Kanboard\n    $user = $this->user->getByEmail($payload['sender']);\n\n    if (empty($user)) {\n        $this->logger->debug('Mailgun: ignored => user not found');\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // The project must have a short name\n    $project = $this->project->getByIdentifier(Tool::getMailboxHash($payload['recipient']));\n\n    if (empty($project)) {\n        $this->logger->debug('Mailgun: ignored => project not found');\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // The user must be member of the project\n    if (! $this->projectPermission->isMember($project['id'], $user['id'])) {\n        $this->logger->debug('Mailgun: ignored => user is not member of the project');\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Get the Markdown contents\n    // if (! empty($payload['stripped-html'])) {\n    //    $htmlConverter = new HtmlConverter(array('strip_tags' => true));\n    //    $description = $htmlConverter->convert($payload['stripped-html']);\n    // }\n    // else if (! empty($payload['stripped-text'])) {\n    //    $description = $payload['stripped-text'];\n\n    if (! empty($payload['body-plain'])) {\n        $description = $payload['body-plain'];\n        // JT 2015-10-30: Fix for a problem with mailto formatting.\n        // $description = preg_replace(\"/\\<mailto:(.*?)\\>/\", \"$1\", $description);\n        $description = preg_replace(\"/\\<mailto:(.*?)\\>/\", \"\", $description);\n\n        // JT 2015-10-28: Add linebreaks for better looking output in the browser\n         // $description = nl2br($description);\n    }\n    else {\n        $description = '';\n    }\n\n   // JT 2015-10-28: Remove reply and forward prefixes from the subject line\n   $simplified_subject = str_replace('FW: ', '', $payload['subject']);\n   $simplified_subject = str_replace('RE: ', '', $simplified_subject);\n\n    // Finally, we create the task\n    return (bool) $this->taskCreation->create(array(\n        'project_id' => $project['id'],\n        'title' => $simplified_subject,\n        'description' => $description,\n        'creator_id' => $user['id'],\n    ));\n}\n\n}\n```\n. @fguillot,\nYes, compliments on the new design are deserved.  Thank you for putting the action sidebar back in task view and improving the sidebar design.  Thank you. Thank you. The change to the actions menu in v1.0.25 rattled me (#1808), and it seems other people were confused by the new design (#1919), too.  But that's in the past.  The new design looks great!\n(As an aside, it's probably still being worked on, but clicking on \"change sorting\" in the comments section causes an  \"Internal Error: Action not implemented\" message.)\nEchoing BlueTeck's comment above, the letter avatar placement could benefit from fine tuning to conserve space.\n. Thumbs up.   I'm not currently using metadata, but this might help get me started.\nOne suggestion that springs to mind immediately, the ability to edit existing metadata. Not just remove/add.\n. Starting with version 1.0.25 most of the sidebar items were moved to the Actions menu.\nIn version 1.0.27 the side bar action items were brought back.\n- In v1.0.26, click the Actions menu --> Add a comment.  (#1919)\nor\n- Upgrade to v1.0.27 and the sidebar items will be back to where you expect them. \n. The problem is with your hosting environment, not Kanboard.\nI'll give you some advice that might help.  Create a new file in the root of your Kanboard directory named phpinfo.php with the following contents:\nphp\nphpinfo();\n?\nView the page and look for \"pdo_mysql\".  Check if it is listed on the page and enabled.\nhttp://yourhostname/kanboard/phpinfo.php\n. Following the link that was posted shows us that the hosting provider has pdo_mysql enabled on their frontend web server.  That's it.  We do not know that 1BlackHat's account is running from that particular server.  Even if his account is running from the same server, it's possible to customize PHP settings per domain/account.  So looking at phpinfo from any place other than the account having the problem tells us nothing.\nThe most likely scenario is that his web environment does not have pdo_mysql enabled, because that is what Kanboard is telling us after it performs a check.  1BlackHat, run phpinfo() from your web space, in the same folder where Kanboard is installed.\n. Is the \"Configure Command\" the only place that you see pdo_mysql?   There should be a section further down the page specifically for pdo_mysql.  See screenshot below.  If there is not a section for it, then it is not enabled.  \nI notice in the screenshot that you have a php.ini file in the Kanboard folder.  That is the loaded configuration file.  You can probably control enabling pdo_mysql on your own by adjusting that file.  I leave that as an exercise for you using the power of Google.\n\n. Well, we've come this far, might as well keep going.\nIt looks as though someone botched the final lines in the php.ini file.  The last two extension directives should be on separate lines.  Like this:\ndisable_functions=exec,passthru,shell_exec,system,proc_open,popen,curl_exec,curl_multi_exec,parse_ini_file,show_source\nextension=pdo.so\nextension=pdo_mysql.so\nOpen the php.ini file in a text editor, and add in some carriage returns so that the extension directives are on separate lines.\n. Try removing the extension_dir line.\nIf that doesn't work, try renaming the php.ini file to something else; php.ini.old\nI'm curious what happens with the file renamed.\n. It's working now.  Check the php info link and you'll see pdo_mysql is now enabled.  That's why you have now progressed to a MySQL error.  It is trying to connect to MySQL, but you have not properly configured the user for the database.\n1BlackHat, I've taken you far along the journey, but I must bid you farewell.  As has been demonstrated, you are running into problems with your environment -- not Kanboard problems.  There is much to learn with PHP and MySQL.  I wish you the best of luck on your journey.   - Jason.\n. Cheers.  I'm happy to hear that you were able to get Kanboard working finally. \n. The variables that you are creating are not seen by the method.  As a learning exercise, change your code to the following and see if it runs the same:\n$client->updateTask($banana = $taskID, $pie = $newtext);\nStudy the client example with named arguments on this page: https://github.com/fguillot/JsonRPC\n$client->updateTask(['id' => $taskID, 'description' => $newtext]);\nYou have been using \"positional parameters,\" which as the name suggests relate to the positional order that the arguments are specified.

The first goes into id.  The second goes into title.\nTL;DR: Use named arguments or specify arguments in the right order.\n. +1.  I would like this feature, too.\n. I've seen the same thing.  The issue is not consistent though, occassionally it redirects fine, but many times it redirect back to login page after logging in.  I haven't spent any time trying to figure out the problem; I just manually enter in the board url after being redirected back to the login page and carry on with my day.\n. Yes.\n. Tags.   Thank you.\n. Oh heck, I didn't mean to include 3 commits.  If you see what I'm requesting, I'll close this pull request.  Thank you.\n. It's a problem with Mailgun.  Concentrate on getting your Mailgun configuration working.  \"Even in Mailgun logs my email not there.\"   If your emails are not arriving at Mailgun, then you have a Mailgun configuration issue.  Review the Mailgun documentation for setting up DNS and MX records.  Check that your domain is verified in Mailgun.\nInstalling Kanboard on a different domain than the domain used for Mailgun is not an issue.\n. Try this:\nsudo chown -R nginx:nginx /usr/share/nginx/html/kanboard/data\nIf the error persists, try this:\nsudo chown -R www-data:www-data /usr/share/nginx/html/kanboard/data\nReference:\nhttp://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/nginx.html\n- For Debian/Ubuntu the default user is www-data for both Apache/Nginx, whereas for RHEL/CentOS the Nginx user is nginx.\n. #2243 - same issue has been reported previously.

C'est envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la m\u00eame organisation. Il n'y a \u00e0 ma connaissance aucune diff\u00e9rence notable entre son compte de messagerie et le mien.\nUne piste \u00e9ventuelle ?\nP.S. nous ne recevons pas les mails actuellement. Nous regardons si cela vient de la configuration. Mais cela ne devrait pas changer les donn\u00e9es du probl\u00e8me.\nMerci d'avance,\nThomas\n. Hello ashbike,\nThank you for your answer :)\n. ",

Hi,\nwhen editing a project, there is also a section to add/edit/remove columns. See http://kanboard.net/documentation/editing-projects\nI am not sure what you mean with percentage and tasks.

I look at the CSV and it does not store ISO-dates but the restrictions are ISO-dates are to be used. The exported CSV looks nothing like the template you can download when trying to import. So for me exports/imports using CSV are broken and I will have to look into using data from MySQL/SQLite directly it seems :(. ",

    "julesverhaeren": "My bad, hopefully I've fixed both pull requests now\n. Yeah that seems much better indeed! I'll try to implement that.\n. Okay I've got it working partially but I've ran into two problems:\n- (this might deserve a seperate bug/feature request issue:) The <=,>=,> and < operators do not seem to function in combination with tommorow,today and yesterday \n- if the start: filter would work exactly like due: then dates that have not yet been assigned a start date would not be displayed. This is really annoying if you want to have this filter on continuously since all tasks will disappear on creation. Would it be better to also display tasks that have no start date with this filter on, or is there another filter technique so that you can still see these tasks? Or perhaps a start date field on the creation forms should be added?\n. I've installed KB on my local machine and the same issue is appearing, php date() gives me the same date as the clock on my OS so that isn't the problem I think? I've also done a clean install from the kanboard-latest.zip from the website (environment is XAMPP on win8.1), but the issue persists.\n. My bad the timezone in Kanboard was still at UTC. However I do think that the gantt view (or better: kanboard as a whole) should behave reliably regardless of the timezone of the client. (which is not the case right now). I think everything displayed and edited should be based on the timezone set in kanboard, but this might be very difficult to realise?\n. found it to originate from picodb, so I'll continue there\n. Is there a reason that no pull request has been submitted with this patch? just tested it and it seemed to fix the issue\n. added a pull request with your fix so that fguillot can merge it in a single click\n. Thanks!\nI was trying to fit everything in a single row but that probably was too optimistic. Perhaps I should aim for smaller more easily implementable improvements. Have there been made any design guidelines? I couldn't find them in the documentation. \nFor example with the dropdowns, is there a reason the \"Actions\" , \"Filters\" and \"Display another project\" buttons all have a different styling (border/no border, gradient/no gradient)? I think it would look much cleaner if the looks of elements were unified.\n. @mcorteel Wow that looks really nice! I think it does become a bit crowded however, perhaps you could use (some of) those saved vertical pixels to create some space between the buttons and the column titles?\n. I don't think it is currently possible since the sub-tasks cannot be given a due date. It would be a nice feature however, so if anyone would be willing to implement it that would be great.\n. ",
    "yahesh": "I started using Kanboard quite recently and would vote for this feature. Swimlanes may e.g. present different criticalities of bugs in a bug tracker and assigning them different colours would be really helpful. As an addition it would also be really helpful to set the swimlane level of a task by its category (e.g. a bug might be automatically assigned the colour yellow in the swimlane \"medium\", while a security vulnerability might be automatically assigned the colour red in the swimlane \"critical\").\n. You get problems with PHPs way of handling certificates as soon as you're using a chroot environment. At least that's what I found out.\n. Hi there, do you have PHP 5.6+ running on your server? PHP 5.6 made mandatory certificate verification for TLS connections the default. Unfortunately the SwiftMailer library that's used to send mails is not ready for PHP 5.6.\nTo change that you have to open the file \"./vendor/swiftmailer/swiftmailer/lib/classes/Swift/Transport/StreamBuffer.php\". Within that file you look for the method \"_establishSocketConnection()\". Within that method you find the following code:\nphp\n$options = array();\nif (!empty($this->_params['sourceIp'])) {\n    $options['socket']['bindto'] = $this->_params['sourceIp'].':0';\n}\n$this->_stream = @stream_socket_client($host.':'.$this->_params['port'], $errno, $errstr, $timeout, STREAM_CLIENT_CONNECT, stream_context_create($options));\nBetween these lines you add some code so that it looks like this:\n``` php\n$options = array();\nif (!empty($this->_params['sourceIp'])) {\n    $options['socket']['bindto'] = $this->_params['sourceIp'].':0';\n}\n//!!! dirty hack to get SMTPS working\n$options['ssl']['verify_peer'] = MAIL_SMTP_SSL_VERIFY_PEER;\n$options['ssl']['peer_name']   = MAIL_SMTP_SSL_PEER_NAME;\n$options['ssl']['ciphers']     = MAIL_SMTP_SSL_CIPHERS;\n$options['ssl']['cafile']      = MAIL_SMTP_SSL_CAFILE;\n$this->_stream = @stream_socket_client($host.':'.$this->_params['port'], $errno, $errstr, $timeout, STREAM_CLIENT_CONNECT, stream_context_create($options));\n```\nNow you open up your \"./config.php\" and add some more configuration lines:\nphp\n//!!! dirty hack to get SMTPS working\ndefine(\"MAIL_SMTP_SSL_VERIFY_PEER\", true);\ndefine(\"MAIL_SMTP_SSL_PEER_NAME\",   \"smtp.mailgun.org\");\ndefine(\"MAIL_SMTP_SSL_CIPHERS\",     \"HIGH:!aNULL:!eNULL:!3DES:!MD5:!RC4:@STRENGTH\");\ndefine(\"MAIL_SMTP_SSL_CAFILE\",      \"<path to root certificate>\");\nNow find the root certificate of the CA that issued the TLS certificate of Mailgun.org and place it somewhere. Replace the \"<path to root certificate>\" value with the chosen filename for the CA root certificate.\nMore on the issue can be found here: https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard/issues/1408\nHope it helps.\nP.S.: The same problem (missing configuration for TLS peer validation) will also hold true for the \"mailgun\" transport as it uses HTTPS, obviously.\n.

    "phillc73": "Inspired initially by wanting to change the background colour of board cards to white, and the answers here, I've made quite a few changes to the layout, Happy to share. All changes made under Settings/Application Settings/Customer Stylesheet, rather than with the beta plugin option. I didn't use anything special like Stylish, just wrote things out by hand after finding the relevant elements using the inspector.\nMy changes essentially do the following:\n1. Solid colour header, full width of page, no margins. In the example CSS below, my header is green.\n2. Main page content with 20 pixel margins left and right.\n3. All links black, rather than blue. Change to grey with mouseover. No underlines. (Although the bold links for each section, e.g. Application Settings, do still have an underline as I haven't quite figured out which tag to alter for this yet.\n4. Board cards for many colours now have a white background. Yellow, blue, green, purple, orange, red, grey included.\n5. Board cards still have a coloured margin. Those for green, blue, red, purple and orange have been altered to deeper solid colours.\n6. Board columns have a grey background and the cards are tweaked to slightly have a top and right margin to show drop shadow.\n7. Changed the main project name in the header to white text (still should probably alter the logout text on the right to match). I'd also quite like to alter the KB logo to a Home icon at some point.

As I wasn't using any swimlanes on this specific project, what I was really trying to achieve was to hide the swimlane column in the List view. \nUnchecking \"Show Default Swimlane\" seemed like the logical way to achieve this.\n. The Application URL field defaults to:\nmydomainname.com\nI've not entered anything in here that I recall, although I may have in my frenzy of setup activity.\nI access the board at:\nmydomainname.com/kanboard\nThis is why I found it strange that the API endpoint showed something different. Even if I was accessing the board directly at mydomainname.com, perhaps the API endpoint should still insert the relevant trailing slash, to create a valid URL.\n. Sorry about that. Should have searched harder. I'll close this one.\n. I agree this is an annoyance, and I would like to see \"no dates\" ordered to the end for ascending order. However, I temporarily work around this by picking some too far in the future date (1/1/2020 usually). It's an added extra step which ideally wouldn't need to occur.\n.

    "sudoman": "I took a look into this issue. A schema change may be required to resolve this issue, as tasks without a due date have a date_due value of 0 and thus sort before the list of earlier due dates:\n````\nsqlite> select id,date_due from tasks where project_id = 6 and is_active = 1 order by date_due asc;\n...\n290|0\n291|0\n292|0\n261|1526529600\n263|1527825600\n````. @jpcanepa In order to help you with patching this issue, I created a script that adds an arbitrary number of tasks to a project:\n````\n<?php\n$project_id=1;\n$task_count=1100;\n$dbh = new SQLite3('./db.sqlite');\nfor ($i = 0; $i < $task_count; $i += 1) {\n$dbh->query('INSERT INTO \"tasks\" (\"title\", \"description\", \"color_id\", \"owner_id\", \"column_id\", \"priority\", \"date_due\", \"date_started\", \"time_estimated\", \"time_spent\", \"score\", \"reference\", \"project_id\", \"creator_id\", \"swimlane_id\", \"date_creation\", \"date_modification\", \"date_moved\", \"position\") VALUES (\"test'.$i.'\", \"\", \"yellow\", 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, \"\", 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 100);');\n\n}\n$dbh->close();\n````\nTo use the script, backup and remove your db.sqlite file, reload the page for your instance, log in as admin/admin and create a new project. change the permissions on db.sqlite so that you can edit it, then run the above script.. This problem exists for some versions of SQlite, but not all. I ran into this problem on Fedora (27?), but on Trisquel 8, which is based on Ubuntu Xenial 16.04, Kanboard doesn't produce that error. I compiled the latest version of SQlite (3.27.1) and was able to reproduce the error on my Trisquel 8 machine.\nTo reproduce the issue in SQLite, use my script above for creating entries in a DB, then run this script:\n````\n<?php\n// passes\n//$count = 999;\n// fails\n$count = 1000;\n\nclass MyDB extends SQLite3 {\n    function __construct() {\n        $this->open('db.sqlite');\n    }\n}\n\n$db = new MyDB();\n\n$sql = \"SELECT * from tasks where id in (?\";\nforeach (range(2, $count) as $x) {\n    $sql .= \", ?\";\n}\n$sql .= \");\";\n\n$stmt = $db->prepare($sql);\n\nforeach (range(1, $count) as $x) {\n    $stmt->bindValue($x, $x, SQLITE3_INTEGER);\n}\n\n$ret = $stmt->execute();\n\nwhile($row = $ret->fetchArray(SQLITE3_ASSOC) ) {\n    echo \"id = \". $row['id'] . \"\\n\";\n}\n$db->close();\n\n````\nIf you want to use a newer version of SQLite than the one installed in your system, you need to run it like this:\nLD_PRELOAD=/home/andrew/src/3rd-party/sys/sqlite3/sqlite-autoconf-3270100/.libs/libsqlite3.so.0.8.6 php test.php\n\n. @fguillot Thanks for merging my PR. : ) Did you intend to close this issue?. @fguillot: Do you think that the code should use %sh for encoding the number of hours? It doesn't print trailing zeros for hours that don't contain a fractional part and might have other generic uses in the code base, but it doesn't support replacing periods with commas like %.2f does according to locale. The time tracking code seems to increment time by increments of 0.01, so %.2f might be an okay option.. This pull request resolves #3668.. After looking at the strings in the code, it makes sense that the strings are slightly different, as one is used to insert a link, and the other is used to insert an integer.\n<?= e('%s moved the task %s to the swimlane \"%s\"',\n                $this->text->e($author),\n                $this->url->link(t('#%d', $task['id']), 'TaskViewController', 'show', array('task_id' => $task['id'], 'project_id' => $task['project_id'])),\n                $this->text->e($task['swimlane_name'])\n            ) ?>\nreturn e(\n                    '%s moved the task #%d to the swimlane \"%s\"',\n                    $author,\n                    $eventData['task']['id'],\n                    $eventData['task']['swimlane_name']\n                );.

I have to say, this is the an annoying issue for, me, having to search for task that got moved somewhere unexpected. Does nobody else have this issue regularly?\nI tried looking at the code to find the issue, but it do no understand where in the Controller code this happens, but then again, I do not have any knowledge about php. . in may case it is a private board, so no other users involved\n. did someone look at the video I attached more than a month ago?\nwhile maybe not relavant to all cases, it shows an issue like this on a fresh docker installation with only one board and only 9 tasks!\nonce the browser \"loses\" the dashed lines, upon mouse release the task is moved somehow ....\nI can reproduce this on firefox, vivaldi and edge (no other browser tested)\n. plain docker installation still has this issue, \nwhen bigboard plugin is installed, I cannot reproduce this anymore. unable to reproduce?  did you look at the video I attached?\n(as said above it might be not relavant to all cases, however it is reproducable  on windows 10 on edge, Firefox and chrome). ok I see. I  just tested Chrome (67.0) on android (8.0) phone, there it is happening as well, therefore I think it is rather browser related not operating system related,. I setup a VM with ubuntu and Firefox, there it is happening as well. with the latest docker image, it unfortunately still happens\nApplication version: master.0fc847f5723fb51b32a7141e8eb5017813b43687 \n. I also cannot reproduce anymore with a recent version of kanboard, so this looks ok now. . that's very good, thanks a lot, I will install  it next week. perfect, and with the new already implemented addition for RUNNING it covers all cases I had. I have the same issue, seen with Vivalidi Browser, Edge Browser\nand I believe, this https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/issues/3915 is about the same issue. still the same, no one lese having the issue?. without understanding the code, just looking at the behaviour,  I think the reason for this is that the total is seems to be kept in the same field for subtasks or task. whenever one edits the task the subtask info is lost, whenever time on the subtask is recorded the task info ist lost (however \"old\" subtask timings seem to be reactivated on my test, but I did no fully understand this)\nin conclusion, I think at the moment you cannot mix task and subtask timings\nonly a developer would be able to tell if this is an error or a deliberate design decision\n. actually this  works limited/partially, but is actually not consistent, \nsteps to demonstrate, tested on the 08-09-2018:\n1) add a new task set the due date to 31-08-2018 (in the past), leave start date empty\n   2) go to the task view and press start now\n      => you get a task with \"Due date: 08/31/2018 00:00\"  and \"Started: 09/08/2018 11:00\"\n 3) however, now try to modify the description of the task and save the task, \n    this is not possible anymore without changing the started date, as you get the error\n   \"The start date is greater than the end date\".

The short answer is that you can't change the width of the 'projects' column on your dashboard through a user setting.\nIt is set by a .css class called \".column-25\" which means that it takes up 25% of the available width on the table. Adjust your window size and you can see what happens to all of the columns as you make it wider or narrower.\nThere is a quick and dirty way to change it for your own installation, but there are consequences.\nConsider a Plugin or some custom Javascript to provide a drag to widen function.\n.

I have 1000+ users (although only 50 active ones) and it is quite complicated to browse through the pages to find a specific user account (created in batch thanks to the useful import function).\nRegards,\nS\u00e9bastien\n. Hello, I confirm the problem with version 1.0.27 on my Synology NAS\n. I agree with @joeaston. First priority are (real/searchable/filterable) tags.\nHashtags with auto-complete would be a great nice-to-have oriented on productivity if they are creating/affecting tags while typing the title or description of a task.\nAuto-complete (and auto-colouring of tags if their number is limited) would be nice for tags but necessary for in-text hashtags.\nLooking forward to testing the version 1.0.31 !\n. Hello, I agree this would be nice to have. In practice, we are satisfied with one date for the complete task if not too much sub-tasks. If there are too much and we need to be more precise with the schedulling, we create another task.\nNevertheless, if this feature is created, the notation used in Confluence to auto create tasks would be great:\ntask_text(free text)  @PIC(username) //due_date(YYMMDD)\nBTW, the field were the sub-task text is written in a bit too short...\n. Great feature! It has directly been adopted by  our Kanboard users. Thanks\nto the contributors.\nLe lun. 17 oct. 2016 15:02, Eskiso notifications@github.com a \u00e9crit :\n\nThis is now possible on 1.0.34, addon also already in Plugins Directory\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/issues/2347#issuecomment-254200692,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ARPcCW81KDcyYKGtFK39ENQPPd-by4Gnks5q03HQgaJpZM4I1Kp-\n.\n. Apparently, when a task is deleted, the entry is removed from the database. This seems to be normal in opposition to the task closure, where the task remains in the table but not in default filter view.\nNevertheless, it would be appreciated to have a trace of the deletion in the activity log of the project.\nWould it be possible to include in a future release?\n\nThanks in advance,\nS\u00e9bastien\n. Hello, got the same request from users. Solved the issue by providing an external report, build using an SQL request on the database. But it would be SO cool to have it directly in Kanboard!. Actually, maybe it would be more useful to propose to possibility to use the keyword OR in filters. Would solve the issue and would offer other possibilities.. Hello, I confirm this new behaviour of the application is not appreciated by our users. Many of them where pre-opening multiple tasks in multiple tabs during the review of tasks. Would be appreciated to get this feature unlocked in the next version.. I also got few complaints of users about the new dashboard, but I agree with @oliviermaridat, Kanboard is an incredibly rich and well architectured application that satisfies both end users and admins (I have rarely seen such a good acceptation rate amongst teams, from top management to drafter, young or old...). \nI am confident that based on our constructive comments and proposals, the solution will evolve, step by step, and we will get used to it. We will start to find advantages to the new view and will finally love it.\nSame for the users management page: as soon as search feature will be available (#1426), it will become much better than the previous table.\nThanks @fguillot for your hard and useful work!. Hello,\nAre there any examples of installations with this feature working properly (automatic closure of a task in a column after x days)?\nI'd like to have it working but without feedback, the investigation field is very broad.\nThanks in advance,\nS\u00e9bastien. You are right.\nMy cronjob was still pointing at ./kanboard instead of ./cli\nI missed the breaking change in the change log of 1.0.35 :-( \nI haven't had it running yet but I will let you know tomorrow if the issue can be closed.\nThanks anyway for your help.. I tried to run the job manually through\ncd /volume1/web/kanboard && ./cli cronjob\nbut I get the following message\nPHP extension required: \"pdo_mysql\"\nI checked - this PHP extension is activated.. \nAlso checked all other extensions required - all seems OK. Hello, thank you for your support. Indeed pdo_mysql is not listed.\n```\nadmin@crl1_abt_tisnas:~$ php -m | grep pdo_mysql\nadmin@crl1_abt_tisnas:~$ php -m\n[PHP Modules]\nbcmath\nbz2\nCore\nctype\ncurl\ndate\ndom\nereg\nfilter\nhash\niconv\njson\nldap\nlibxml\nmbstring\nmcrypt\nopenssl\npcntl\npcre\nPDO\npdo_sqlite\nPhar\nposix\nreadline\nReflection\nsession\nshmop\nSimpleXML\nsockets\nSPL\nsqlite3\nstandard\nsyno_compiler\nxml\nxmlreader\nxmlwriter\nzip\nzlib\n[Zend Modules]\n```\nI suppose I need now to figure out how to install pdo_mysql without messing up globally the server. As, in practice, pdo_mysql is installed and enabled (as shown above).\n. Great! It works! Finally! :-) Hope it will works also for @pcherkash on #3459.\nWe were close to the solution thanks to @fguillot \nThank you so much, @bdouxx !\nIt is such a relief not to have to close manually old tasks in some of our projects.\n.

Is there a plugin for switching template from user profile (for each user)?\nI made plugin for some changes on GUI, but I want to do that is configurable for each user. \n. Can we group activities?\nI made few changes about this.

Thanks for support.. I thought it is relation with LDAP because only LDAP users does not works. I did not investigate deep to detect what is the real problem.\nI enabled debug mode, of course, for detect what is the problem and I see only one interesting line, as I posted above.\nHowever, hopefully I have found workaround for now here, but really I do not know where I can start for investigate deep. Maybe latter when I have a little more time, but for now, maybe you know where is the problem, or where I can start investigating.. Thanks @Langlais115 I will check. \nLast time, when I add one new user to the AD, I must added user to KB manually. But this time, I did not use SQL command, just add user from Kanboard as remote user. It is not solution of course, but it is easiest workaround for now.. Try use ldapsearch command line to check for your user. It means, path to user, security group, organization unit, .... ",

I don't know if there are any security modules set up.\nI updated to the lastest version by renaming the folder on my web-server, creating a new folder with the latest version, and copying the \"data\" folder from the renamed folder to the new one.\nAfter that, I had to make a change to the \".htaccess\" file in the root folder in order to prevent an internal server error.\nI attached the .htaccess file (I renamed it here - on my web server the file is named \".htaccess\")\nhtaccess.txt\n. This issue still appears in version 1.0.36.. @fguillot \nHow do I check, if \"mod_pagespeed\" is enabled? I have a webspace at \"domainfactory\" and I have no access to the apache configuration.\nIn the forum of domainfactory, there is a thread where technicans of domainfactory say, that there are more problems than advantages with this mod. So as I understand, they don't have enabled this mod on the servers of their clients.\nNevertheless, after searching a bit, I found a hint, that \"mod_pagespeed\" can be disabled by inserting the following lines into the \".htaccess\" file:\n\n    ModPagespeed off\n\nI did that (in the .htaccess file in the kanboard root folder), but there is no change.. I just contacted my web hoster. \"mod_pagespeed\" is not installed and not available for my server.\nSo \"mod_pagespeed\" cannot explain the issue.. This issue seems to be solved in version 1.0.37 :-)\nGreat work - thank you :-). ",
    "Biniou180": "Maybe it could be possible to not limit the feature to a category?\nFor example: When a task is dropped into a swimlane, it assigns the task to a specific user.\n. Some users of framaboard.org are also interested by this :-)\nI would add also a special mention to the due date : it would be very convenient to modify it in place instead of opening each time the menu.\nAlso, why not think of adding this feature in cards in the board view too? (maybe would be useful for a lot of users?)\n. Some users of Framaboard are also interested by this feature.\nAn additional comment though: Is it better (easier?) to put this setting  in general preferences or in project preferences? (as it can be useful for a project with a lot of tasks, but painful with only a few tasks)\n. Hello, \nI just put a comment here to ask if this issue is planned in a future version by chance?\nI have just discussed with one of our users about this ticket, particularly the ability to reset the password by giving e-mail, as final users often not remember their username but definitely remember their e-mail :)\nThanks again!. You're right @85pando , I didn't take the time to search for source files. My bad!\nThanks for the link anyway :)\nPull request created.\n. Seems OK to me, i will check with our users. thanks :). hum... when searching in issues, i stumbled upon issue #2332 which seems to be the exact same problem.\nMy bad i didn't see it before, you can put this issue as duplicate, I will follow #2332 instead.\nThanks!\n. I've seen the modifications, it is indeed a lot better! :)\nThanks a lot! I will discuss with our users if they like the new list view (but from my point of view, it's ok like this)\nHave a nice day :-). Yes, it was my suggestion: Moving the top menu with \"new project\" [...] to the left, under the menu containing \"My project/task/subtasks/.../notifications\"; the same way the \"actions\" menu for a task has been moved under task menu since previous versions.\nJust a suggestion, if you think there is a better way, i'm okay with it :)\n. It's not that annoying, but some of our users have a lot of projects and are forced to scroll down to find them (I know they can use the search input, but I suppose they like using the mouse).\nAs there is no reason (?) to add a scrollbar as there is still a lot of space on screen, it was a suggestion to make the menu more accessible.\n. In addition to previous comments, further discussions with our users brought other remarks to enhance the project bar:\n- Why not enlarge the width of the bar? in case of long project names, it could be easier to read\n- Instead of displaying \"Display another project\", why not directly display the text search input (which is inside the drop-down today), and right next to it a button to open the drop-down list? It will spare some clicks for a user searching by text, and not change the behaviors for mouse users.\nA mockup from one of our users to illustrate the suggestion:\n\nThanks :)\n. Seems perfect for me ! :-)\nI will show a screenshot of the improvement to our users to see their reactions.\njust for completion sake:\n\nCan't wait to see this in production, thanks a lot :-)\n.

A million thanks !\n. @jtourt Thanks for replying. here are my settings and results. I have tried several thinks, with no result. Note however that Mailgun logs says the delivery is completed.\nMailgun domain info:\n\nMailgun log:\n\nKanboard settings:\n\n. Just noticed that the problem might be in the routing:\n1. example for routing used to be action=task, has now become action=receiver\n2. my initial setting uses http, instead of https. perhaps kanboard does not \"listen\" to http ? Anyway I changed that but it seems I will have to change something to my firewall as well, because server not available using https\n. Version of Kanboard: 1.0.23-fix1\u200b\nSettings/integrations: nothing appears for Mailgun. Only Google/Github/Gitlab authentication and Gravatar\nMailgun Plugin version: 1.0.1\n\nI am sending test emails from the same address that is defined for me as a Kanboard user.\nThe emails are sent to the Mailgun defined domain: mg.idevlop.com, for instance to kanboard+PROJ1@mg.idevlop.com, PROJ1 beeing an existing project identifier.\nThat obviously matches the defined Mailgun route.\nWhat is unclear to me is what to enter in config.php for the MAIL_FROM\nparameter, and why in the world that has anything to do with receiving\ntasks, since\n1) reception is made by http hook\n2) sender address should vary if several users are define in Kanboard.\n. @jtourt Many thanks. I reinstalled the plugin and it all works now. 8-D\n. The code above works.\nAt first I thought it was not working at all, but it was due to the fact I had deleted the \"Exchange user\" form the project, therefore the tasks were not showing up at all. I re-added the user, and the content showed up ok.\nFYI, Gmail format is kept (bold text...) while Exchange formatting seems lost.\n. And on a synology NAS, where there is a graphical interface for this, what command should be entered in the \"user defined script\" ?\nThanks !\n\n. Same issue with my Synology NAS. Version 1.0.26 works like a charm.\n. ",

This is now possible on 1.0.34, addon also already in Plugins Directory\n. Put the directory before debug.log exactly like the FILES_DIR but replace 'files' by 'debug.log'\n. I've created the tests, but pushed on another pull request =\\ sorry.\n. You need to backup the DATA folder and review the new config file (some stuff was added), what  you can do to expedite this is actually \"move\" the data folder to an outside location (kanboard_static for example) and then on the Config.php change the DATA_DIR to something like: \ndefine('DATA_DIR', '..'.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'kanboard_static'.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'data');\nThis way you only need to worry about the config.php, but to answer your question:\n- 1 : Rename your kanboard folder to something like kanboad_2\n- 2 : Extract the downloaded version, renamed config.default.php to config.php\n- 3 : Review and edit the new config.php\n- 4 : Enjoy\n. Thank you, got it working, injected it on the Plugin.php\n. I've also tried this and it also only works when i type the entire username (username, not name of user) and Save, but no recommendations appear\n. The problem does not appear to be on the configuration, but on the user you are using to login into kanboard, the so called \"my user\"\n. +1 on this, tried on master version and cant do for example:\nstatus:open tag:\"DM\" category:\"Cat1\"\nThis will not show anything, if i remove either the tag: or the category: it will show but not with both, with this push it works correctly, shows task that has both the category and the tag.\n.

Are you using a custom plugin now to track? In case you didn't, could you guide me a little bit to modify yours and make it work? (it doesn't work on my kanboard after setting everything up). yeah, super useful if implemented :). I think this feature would be awesome. Every project I open I write \"COMPANY - Name of project\", to be able to see the clients/customers.\nKanboard could have the option to assign clients or customers, and then, be able to see a list of all clients with their related projects. Not necessary to be a CRM, though, just simple options to understand the full picture.. I was going to open this exact issue, as I am working exactly in the same manner. \nAs a matter of fact, regarding this issue, there are other slightly related issues (I am opening a ticket for each one, I list them only to summarize):\n\nIn the user dashboard, when searching for tasks in column (eg: work in progress), the project, and swimlane order follows the same pattern described here, when it would be desirable to be alphabetic.\nIt would be desirable to have clients/customers assigned to each project, and have the possibility to list the clients with all their related projects..

Even creating them by hand doesn't make it work.\nThanks! . Hi! In my config file I have the default value from previous version (36, I think): define('DATA_DIR', 'data');\nNow I see the default values changed in last versions, so I guess this is the problem. I will try and post if it worked.. Hi!\nIt's solved now, the problem was the web server user, that wasn't able to write in this folder.

Hi,\nin my case the following settings were set while the error appeared to be present:\nDateformat:\nSet to (d.m.Y)\nDate- and Timeformat:\nSet to (m/d/y H:i)\nTimeformat:\n14:16(H:i)\nThese settings will produce the error.\nWhen changing the Date- and Timeformat to the following:\nDate- and Timeformat:\nSet to (d.m.Y H:i)\neverthing runs fine.\nConclusion:\nI think the Dateformat and therefore the Date-and Timeformat should be alligned to each other, or forced to be in sync somehow.\n. Hi Frederic.\nAs discussed yesterday. Here is my pull request to export the 'reference' also within the function \"task export\". Please review and correct in case I forget something.\nThank you very much.\n. ",

I think the file match rule for \"kanboard\" is causing the issue and is matching the kanboard directory without a slash instead of just the kanboard file.

I was wrong in that this solution is not working. From my understanding the files directive should have worked and not matched on the directory, so I am not sure what the best way to implement this is in the .htaccess file.

No additional edge cases and logic required (you do not need to think about what happens if a tickets get moved out of \"Done\" again whether the notification needs to be enabled or not)\n\nCon: You \"loose\" the information about the original due date. It is still available in the log I guess.\n\n\nVar B: Complex\n  Add new action \"Disable Due Date Notification if moved to column X\"\n\nPro: Solves the actual task\nCon: Hard to implement since this behaviour rises multiple other issues like what happens to comments & ticket updates and so on.

    "bonbonGuy": "I work around this 'feature' :) by adding an automatic action to add a comment log when moving into my WIP. However, i do agree this would be nice to have it always there regardless. \n. I second this as Templates would be great for individual tasks yes!\nI've been playing with something similar for auto generation of multiple tasks based on a template. (mimicking repeated process flow and promoting better estimations) It's a bit of a hack, but i wanted to work within the limits of the \"plugin\" space without altering core code. \nWhat i did was created a new project (called it Templates), each column specified a new set of tasks for each process. filled it with the tasks, and configured how i wanted them exactly.\nI then created an automatic action that can be triggered when a task is moved to a specified column doing the following:\n1. Generate the set of tasks from the template project / column by duplication [ to a specified column or other project]\n2. Assign them to the parents tasks assigned user\n3. Link the newly generated tasks back to the initial task by a specified link (i use milestone)\n4. (optional) move the parent task to another board for tracking. \nThis action can also be trigger by an action in the task menu (Generate tasks from task)\nIf this is of interest i would be happy to package it up as a plugin once i finish vetting it out. \n. Thanks for the reply,  More specifically i'm trying to hook into the C3 chart code. \n.

    "abouquet": "+1 !\nNot necessary cross project, but it should be good if it can be done inside a project :)\nI'm using the \"Tasks list\" feature.\n. ",
    "orware": "I can see his point regarding the Closed status (it gives a different meaning than Inactive in my mind...Inactive sounds more like the project died, whereas Closed indicates more that it was completed and done with).\n. I agree this would be a great feature (from the rough description above I think it's similar to an idea I was wanting to have back after we started using Kanboard earlier this year).\n. Related to this feature request: I don't necessarily need the group option myself, but something that would be nice is that if in addition to the assignee, we could specify a list of additional users that should be kept \"in the loop\" as the item is being worked on.\nUse cases:\n\nI currently operate within my own project in Kanboard, but occasionally I work on tasks that are related to our network/server folks and I'd like to keep them in the loop just for these tasks (since they aren't subscribed to my project's notifications). I'd like to be able to specify them to be notified as well (or perhaps as a group, but we're not actually using groups ourselves much at the moment).\nIf I'm working on a task for a specific user on campus, it would be nice to include them so they can be notified as I'm working on things for them too.. Just to add some extra comments on this since I had the same situation.\n\nI had an \"allusers\" sort of group, but the members of this group were other groups (each of those groups was a type of employee class, so we had \"administrators\", \"managers\", \"regular staff\", etc. groups nested inside of the allusers one).\nMy problem was two-fold.\nOne thing I wasn't aware of was that the basic Active Directory user I was using (the one I configured in my Kanboard login) actually didn't have the permissions needed to pull in the needed memberof information. Apparently, since memberof isn't a \"real\" property (it gets derived on the fly it seems) some special permissions are needed to query that info and this Server Fault page was helpful (though it's a little out of date so I had to do some figuring out on my own for our newer version of Active Directory Users and Computers): https://serverfault.com/questions/167371/what-permissions-are-required-for-enumerating-users-groups-in-active-directory.\nSo that solved my basic problem of the groups not being assigned properly.\nTo fix our allusers group issue (which I had set for the LDAP_GROUP_MANAGER_DN constant since I wanted all of our users to have that level of permissions by default that way they can create regular projects and assign permissions in addition to the private projects that regular Users get) I ended up modifying our allusers group so that users were directly added as members into this group since I didn't see an easy way to fix things without customizing things to use the adldap2 PHP package (which I think can do this sort of nested groups resolution automatically: https://github.com/Adldap2/Adldap2/issues/388).\nPart of the reason why it's a bit tricky to solve with the way the code is currently is because the memberof attribute doesn't show that the user is part of allusers through the nested group relationship (it only shows the actual groups the user is directly a part of so some extra work needs to be done to look at the groups the user is a part of, and search to see if those groups are a part of any other groups, maybe even in a recursive fashion depending on the level of nesting, and create a flattened list of all of the groups the user is a member of after doing all of that work).. ",
    "eskaryo": "This would be a great change. Having only Active and Inactive statuses is a little too two-dimensional for how this tool can be used. Statuses such as Closed, Template, On Hold, Cancelled could all be very useful. If user-creatable statuses were in play, that would only further improve the contextual value of a status assignment. I'm bringing this up for a team of 5 to help us focus and we've just today completed our first project tracked through the tool. We were sad when we realized our only option was to 'Disable' the project which sets it to inactive. We want a history of success and contextual value to the status assigned to the project. \n. This would be a very helpful feature. Would suggest you make sure you have the workers such as beanstalk configured and running as well as taking a look at converting to mysql- there is a script which will convert your sqlite db over to mysql and you should be on your way..

This gives us the chance to review projects and tasks later.\nThe projects remain in the overview.

Isn't this considered a bug if #2173 was supposed to solve this?. Well, source of truth works for every other webapp and program with LDAP-based Auth.\nJust Kanboard does not apply changed group-memberships to users. So yes it might not be possible to elevate users to managers in Kanboard. But if I add them to the LDAP-group that is configured for Kanboard-Managers they are not granted Manager-rights either.\nAfter this works in other services perfectly, LDAP does not seem to be the problem.\nE.g. we are running a wiki with ACLs based on LDAP-groups.

    "1BlackHat": "First of all -- THANKS to jtourt & andyhoyland for answering -- I was starting to give up hope.\nAs the pdo_mysql goes, after implementing jtourt's advice -- the resultant phpinfo does show that the pdo_mysql is present -- however, instead of pdo_mysql=enabled is shows pdo_mysql=shared (???).  See the screen capture below for all PDO statements:\n\nAs that goes, I'd be happy to share the URL so that this can get resolved -- and also assist what must be legions of users who deal with shared hosting environments.  What I don't want is to have the URL floating about in search engine results such as Google, Yahoo, & otherwise (which by the way is how I located this \"issues forum\" for Kanboard).\nThat much stated, if there's a way for me to private message and/or email the URL for further troubleshooting, I'd be glad to do so.\n. Jtourt,\nAgain... thank you so much for being willing to help out with this.  In comparing your screenshot above with the phpinfo file you had me create earlier -- I can see that there is no PDO section stated on it (for additional details, please see it directly.\nFurther, the php.ini which should be controlling it is attached -- the remote host server group wrote the file, and it's admittedly beyond my technical expertise... so I don't know if it's stated correctly or not -!?!\n\nWhat do you think?\n. Revised php.ini as advised -- to no avail... still results in the same error.  As that goes, please see the php.ini file to see that the corrections were implemented in the right way.\n. Tried removing the extension_dir = ./ and that resulted in the following error:\n\"Internal Error: SQLSTATE[HY000] [1045] Access denied for user 'u4756150_kantest'@'localhost' (using password: YES)\"\nIs there another suggestion, or should I just try renaming the php.ini to php.ini.old?\n. Jason,\n... and please note my gratitude for your assistance -- Most Appreciated.\n. @andyhoyland \nYes!!!\n...a bit of to and fro with the remote host support team, and the database connection was achieved. \nAlthough I initially expected the Kanboard installation to take 15 minutes or less, when all was said and done -- it took a total of 7 days.\nMy situation undoubtedly varied from many who will use Kanboard in a shared hosting environment -- but make no mistake -- it's not necessarily as simple as it seems.  Anyone intending to perform this install successfully (at least in a shared hosting environment) should be prepared to have patience and tenacity.\nIn conclusion -- it was JTourt's genius, the remote host support team, and determination on my own behalf to see the install through to the end -- that ultimately equated to SUCCESS.  Where the genius of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Guillot is concerned...Kanboard is leaps and bounds above other kanban programs, is very well thought out, and is THE BEST of it's kind where open source is concerned.\nIn closing (albeit I'm a few weeks out from payday) everyone reading this should remember the countless hours and tireless efforts put into programs like these by brilliant developers who love what they do -- and DONATE to support the cause!\nI, for one, applaud Kanboard and hope to see it remain in the lead ahead of the other contenders!  \nMost Appreciatively,\n1BlackHat\n.

That allows me to use any of those email addresses to email in tasks, but yes, then they are assigned to those \"fake\" users. I couple that with a automatic action which makes all tasks in my backlog columns unassigned so they don't end up on my ocerview pages to workaround thale issue of information overload on my projects. Certainly not ideal, and thus multiple email aliases would be a welcome feature. \nAnother thing I do is have several projects, one for each major category of tasks (areas of responsibility) to hold and vet tasks and ideas. I use a column in each to move tasks I will be actively working on to my active projects project and limit what is moved to keep me focused.

Will put this up, as soon as I get it working.\n. I have released this as a SAML plugin for Kanboard: https://github.com/trajche/SamlAuth\nWill do a pull request on plugins page when I have time.\n. You can use this: https://github.com/kanboard/plugin-example-css\nas an example to create a custom css plugin for your Kanboard.\n. @kgeil @fguillot I think a new 'hook' feature would be required in order to be able to develop plugins that are able to have callback upon certain 'actions'.\nSimple JS hooks example: http://www.velvetcache.org/2010/08/19/a-simple-javascript-hooks-system\nSimilar to the webhooks selection: https://kanboard.net/documentation/webhooks\nexcept that it would be called right away on the frontend.\n.

I investigated and was able to reproduce it in more detail:\nReproduction on v1.0.34\n\nMake a task as a member of category A\nPlace it on position 1 (IMPORTANT*)\nMake three tasks as members of category B\nPlace them on position 2, 3, 4 (in the same column as the first task).\nFilter the board on category B (making only the latter three visible).\nDrag the top task (th\u00e9n number 1, but formally - without filter - nr2.), one position down, hopping over the the task below it.\nWait (or press F5) to see the just moved task jump back to its original location.\n\n*The bug seems to be related to the relative position of the tasks that are filtered out of the view. So having a lot of tasks surrounding in between - but most of all above - the ones that are being manipulated in the filtered view seems critical to testing the issue.\nNota bene: I think a bug in ordering will scare of many users - as the ordering is for many (including yours truly) a core functionality of the board. My advice would be to give this a fairly high priority to fix but do not filter when placing this one high on your board @fguillot! :smirk:\nUPDATE:\nReproduction on v1.0.37\nSadly still the same behavior after upgrading: Have a task on a higher position on the board, filter it out in some way, and ordering the tasks (that are still visible) below it (the higher one filtered from the view) is not as expected. :weary:\n(See my previous post for a step-by-step reproduction scenario).. I tested a little further and discovered a critical detail:\n\nThe erroneous shift is always upwards (from the place where you drop the task)\nBy the same number of the number of 'filtered-from-the-view-tasks above the one dropped'\n\nI.e.: If there is one invisible (i.e. filtered) tasks above the 'drop-position' of a repositioned task; the dropped task shifts up one place up, relative to its actual drop-position. If there are two, the shift-up-after-drop is two correspondingly.  Three means three shifts up, etc.\nNota bene: This is actually very close to desired behavior. But..\n1. it should only happen when the dropped task moved downwards\n2. *the number of places shifted should only take into account the number of invisible (filtered) tasks that reside in-between the two not-filtered tasks the repositioned is dropped between. (now it seems to take them all into account).\nI hope I am making sense, as in \"logic\" I've exactly pinpointed the bug, just needs to be changed in the code. I'm expecting a very small change (the base-logic seems valid, but broken).\nI'll do some more testing if required (especially if requested by @fguillot or anyone else able to pick this up code-wise).\nP.S. I'm using SQLlite (default install out of the box), but I do not think it is related.. Screenshot explanation in the making... A moving gif says more than a thousand screenshots (well technically... aw never-mind.. :no_mouth: ):\nFiltering TWO tasks from above the drop-point:\n![UNdesired behavior due TWO filtered task][3]\n REFERENCES \n[3]:http://i.imgur.com/nrsTBz5.gif. > So the question is: what is the behaviour expected when no filters are applied of changes set when filter is on ?\nThis is how I see it:\nSay Johns tasks are orange and Maries tasks are gray. John filters the view (making grays invisible) and changes the order of the orange cards according to what he wants within his tasks pool (orange). Maries task order stays unchanged within her tasks pool (her view would be identical should she filter on her gray tasks).\nBut, of course, John (moving around a task) changes the overall - unfiltered - order. Luckily the only implicit uncertainty takes place within the two tasks where he drops his moved one in between (as there may be invisible tasks that he does not take into account). All other consequences of his move are explicit, as determined by the pre-move state of the system, and the change within orange being desired by John (if Mary does not agree on either of those; they should set up a meeting to discuss it..).\nFor the \"difficult\"/implicit part I argue that: The order of the tasks at the point of departure of the move are the best estimate of what is intended by the users after a filtered move.\nExpected behavior\nImagine the filter is on during all this, so the gray tasks can not be seen during the move of John/orange:\n\nI believe this is what was also intended by the original code of @fguillot and there only is only a small bug somewhere (either in his PHP code or in some javascript-drag/drop-indexing function). It would be a shame if left unfixed, as it renders Kanboard unfit for corporate usage where lots of filters (big teams) are used, and task-order is often mission critical for time-to-market reasons.\n REFERENCES \n. It has been over two weeks and not even the Unable to reproduce label got dropped? \ud83e\udd10\nSurely the vertical ordering and filtering are part of Kanboards core functionality?. > Actually, this is \"known problem\". I understand that need to be addressed.\nThanks for the acknowledgment and the elaboration on what is causing it! :relaxed:\n\nThe way that positions are calculated (server side) and the way the new position is sent (client side) need be revised to take into consideration non visible tasks on the board. This is probably not a simple fix. This is an interesting problem to solve.\n\nI understand that a fix (or implementation as @TheCloud puts it) won't be easy and probably requires some time before it can be addressed. But it does already give peace of mind knowing that the developer has it (somewhere) on his scope, so that when the opportunity does rise it won't be overlooked (albeit maybe not actively planned for now).\nI will study a little on the issue, but am afraid that my coding skills are not good enough to tackle it by myself (but who knows). If progress is booked in this part of the code by someone else, I am more than willing to test naturally!\nThanks again for responding @fguillot (and for your insights @TheCloud )!. @fguillot do you agree on the Expected behavior as depicted in my last gif?. @TheCloud that looks really promising!! I think you are correct! Implementing the behavior as laid-out by you would be a huge improvement (making filtered drag and drops functional)!\nOne thing to conceptually consider (while further extending your reasoning):\n\nWhen filter is removed, the dropped item(s) should be put on top of the least brick\n\nThis holds presuming the dropped item originated from below the \"least brick\" (as demonstrated in your example). When it originates from above the pair though it should be put immediately below the highest brick IMHO (assuming the old situation is the best guess for inter-group positional relation).\nAcknowledging this reasoning would turn the aforementioned quote into (interpreting the term \"brick\" as the items the dropped one is placed between):\n\nWhen filter is removed, the dropped item(s) should be put on top of the least brick when coming from below and should - vise vesa - be put immediately below of the highest brick when coming from above.\n\nI think this is better as it does not harm your logic in any way, but would additionally respect the position of the moved filtered (fruit) item relative to the filtered (veggies) that it had before the move.\nPut in terms of your EXAMPLE (fruits and vegs):\n\nBanana\nApple\nAsparagus\nBean\nApricot\nBlackberry\nBroccoli\n\nLet's filter out vegs:\n\nBanana  => I want to move this between Apple and Apricot\nApple\nApricot\nBlackberry\n\nExpected filtered:\n\nBanana\nApple\nBanana => Filtered result is respected\nApricot\nBlackberry\n\nExpected unfiltered:\n\nApple\nBanana  => Unfiltered: Banana in immediately below of Apple (see above)\nAsparagus\nBean\nApricot\nBlackberry\nBroccoli\n\nSo; taking the original position into account results in the smallest change in the secondary relative 'between group position' of the dropped fruit item's position relative to the veggies (although veggies were filtered from view), while - of course - primarily still respecting the 'within-group position' of the dropped fruit item's position in between the other fruits (as that was the reason for the filtered drag 'n drop to begin with).\nAlso see this visual explanation of the same concept.\nNote: Feel free to ignore all this if it would otherwise over-complicate implementation!. P.S. For those mainly following this discussion by e-mail notifications: I highly edited my previous comment so it is best read from the Github webpage directly. Its gist was unaltered though.. Good work!\n\nworks only on filters based on users (assignee)\n\nLuckily for me that is the main application for me filtering, but yes a generic fix would be even better!\nI am sure that @fguillot will help you score this one, since you are so close and seem to know what should be done when anyone could make the DB query changes corresponding to your fix!\n.  :laughing: Is that a matter of:\n\nExporting/Downloading SQL (backup)?\nManually editing that specific PHP file as laid out by you?\nFunctionally test (drag/drop 'n such)?\n\nAnd (if so):\n\nCan this be done on a running (live) system?\nIs there (also) a binary available that I can install in a test (container)?\n\nUPDATE: I'll try to simply do an install and \"patch\" the file as laid out by @TheCloud  and see what it will bring.. I donwloaded the patched 'TaskPositionModel.php' and swapped it with the current one after a fresh install.\nIt's behavior is much better! But not yet 100% correct.\n:thumbsup: No more within-group order-surprises (which is already much better then before). In other words: as long as the filter is active order is fine.\n:thumbsdown: Between-group order is not respected, which can be seen after the filter is lifted from the view (and all tasks are visible). So although the order within the categories are fine, tasks can hop over a task from another category (that was filtered). I have not yet detected the exact pattern yet.. but it seems pretty straight forward.\nPlease let me know if you need a more concrete example!\nHowever;  I do feel this can already be merged into the regular development builds as this is already a great step forward. With one note: This was a specific progression-test (specific to the intended goals). I have not performed any regression tests.. Your effort is highly appreciated @TheCloud , as is yours @Busfreak !\n\nA more practical example would be appreciated\n\nThe PDF generated by @Busfreak sums it all up! :) It shows exactly what I am seeing here on my end. The remaining issue becomes clear when comparing: expected order to the result of the Patched code (column4).\nWe are aaaaaaaalmost there though!. That indeed describes the behavior we're experiencing. Not perfect, but nevertheless much better than it was before!   . I'm eager to start using Kanboard having included the patched file (assuming the secondary issues left-over are too hard to tackle on short notice)!\n@TheCloud will you make a pull-request for @fguillot to take in, or how will this be continued/processed?\nOf course we can swap files manually, but I'm afraid that future (regular) development/updates may break its functionality.. Well, if you are willing to invest the time (when you possibly find it during the holidays) for a more complete fix, that would be even better of course!\nI've thought about the left-over issue too quite a lot. It is a tough one to crack. The positioning in the (filtered) views and eventual positioning in the (overall) list seem fairly separated, leading to a shift in order one way or another (the one having applied your patch being the least disruptive one IMHO).\nLet's, for now, give it some time to see if @fguillot is able to nudge this partial-fix into a more complete one (which would be \"the bomb\").\nI feel bad I am unable to actually help here.. If there is something I can do (e.g. explicitly test something), please let me know. For now, the best I can do is start using the patch on our production-server to have a \"real\" beta/stress-test and update you if anything else pops-up.. ",

That's a little... wrong as each task drag is literally a full page load!. well. some interesting points in the comments. i'd be for just returning a basic ajax response, including success. column task counts can be implemented client side, and would only need to be wrapped in some spans which jquery could target each of on a task drop event. the task count could be stored in a js var, or just counted dynamically. even the least efficient last option there is going to be heaps faster than returning the whole page.\nas for automatic actions, isn't the page updated every x seconds anyway? as user defined. . @amff1704 Interesting - was this from a sqlite database as well?.

Unfortunately i can't use it in production because we would like to stay in a stable channel.. \nSomething like this to delete files\n. Here it is...\nI am juste wondering if I need to push also the minification made from gulp or not (app.min.css). Should Fix #3466 . oh sorry.\nA problem of copy pasting and attention when I've sent the code.\nI will change it asap.. Strange I don't have it in Chrome 61.0.3163.100\nNeither in Firefox 55.0.3. Oh thanks\nI was a bit slow :( sorry. #3819 should put links : \n\non the tasks in the table\non the projects in the table\n\nAdd a footer in the email like other notifications with a link to the board. It\u2019s after creating ? Or after each save of tasls? For the documentation?. It would be nice to have one after 1st creation and a different one after each save. Maybe with just a different parameter?. Photoswipe may be better, with possibly less functionalities but better followed on Github ?. One thing also is that it would be great if it would be framework independent, Vanilla JS.\nIn case we decide one day to switch off from jQuery. Thank you ;).

Hmmm I actually receive one mail per project. Isn't it the case everytime?. To have it to calculate the url of Project in the notification. ",
    "loonies": "\"Workaround\" is pressing Esc key\n. What about notifications? You have web and email notifications that will\nnotify you on any change.. We (at our organization) are also experiencing this behaviour. I believe it's a UI issue. At times it's hard to get the \"selection\" rectangle to target the desired spot. The board in question has over 200 cards.. Fixed by commit ba0455d. Can you please reopen #2620 for continued discussion.. Did you try with the latest Kanboard version (1.2.5)?. Why are you closing task if you want them to remain visible i.e. open? Doesn't make sense.. I was only wondering why are you closing tasks if you want them on the board. Simply keep them open.\nFor example, our workflow is to close tasks in the Done column after predefined time frame using an automated task. This serves as a grace period if we need to follow up on a card for whatever reason. If there are no followups we don't want to clutter the board with unnecessary information. In case much later down the road we need to refer back to some information or follow up it's easy to pull a card via status:closed search term filter.. ",

Yes two years we're waiting someone to dev it :/ . thx a lot @creecros , we can build groups in kanboard, can't we assign a task easily to one of those groups ?. thx a lot for your help && engagement ;).

At that point a certain group that have budget legitimation needs to decide if that task can be done by the requester or not.

    "nepomuc": "@fguillot Thanks for the explanation. Well in my experience users who don't like a feature give way more feedback than users who don't even realise that it's there. Users just using your UI intuitively is basically the best result you can wish for, but those users usually don't give you any feedback at all. In this case we know it's very common for layer-boxes, modals, gallery-zoom-thingies etc. that you can close them by clicking on the background. So maybe it's worth thinking about it again, or maybe find an even better solution by implementing a recurity feature for layer-boxes which contain a <form>. Maybe by showing a alert which asks you if you really want to close the layer-box.. @fguillot I built a solution for that but I can't commit it yet, because I don't know how you deal with translating text in JavaScript. Can you tell me how I can make the text of the confirm available for translation?\n$(document).on(\"click\", \"#popover-container\", function(e) {\n  if($(this).find('form,input,textarea,select,option').length > 0) {\n            var r = confirm(\"Are you sure you want to close this layer-box?\");\n            if (r == true) {\n                self.close(e);\n            }\n        }\n        else {\n            self.close(e);\n        }\n    });. I already built something to address this topic @ https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/issues/2847. ",
    "sstiene": "I also need this feature.\nPerhaps it can be additionally realized as described here:\nhttps://www.teamgantt.com/resource-management-software/\nso that I have a tasks per day and hours per day overview over my team per project or for all projects.\nI already computed this numbers using the python API but it would be great to have this in the web GUI!. look at the \nhttps://kanboard.net/documentation/analytics\n-> Average time spent into each column\nBut I have a related question: I want to get the total amount of working hours spent on a project. The Idea was, that I sum up the spent hours of all tasks in the \"Done\" column but it seams that the API is not able to give me closed tasks and if all tasks have to remain open  the \"Done\" column will be overcrowded with tasks very soon.\nBTW.: Does it make sense to set up something like askbot for kanboard? \nhttps://github.com/ASKBOT/askbot-devel\nhttp://answers.ros.org/questions/.

    "LinuxLowell": "+1\nHaving the same issue... back to post it notes on my desk for the time being.\nApplication version: 1.0.36\nPHP version: 5.6.29\nPHP SAPI: cgi-fcgi\nOS version: Linux 2.6.32-673.26.1.lve1.4.18.el6.x86_64\nDatabase driver: sqlite\nDatabase version: 3.8.5\nBrowser: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/55.0.2883.98 Safari/537.36 Vivaldi/1.6.689.46. I have only tested in a shared environment.  It was running like champ for months but changed providers a few weeks ago.  I was performing cleanup yesterday.  As part of that cleanup I was able to close a lot of tasks and even update tasks.  However, I was not able to create tasks.  I think yesterday was the first time I tried to add tasks since the migration.\nBehavior\n- When mousing over the \"+\" sign at the top the column, it turns red.  When I click the \"+\", nothing happens. \n- When selecting \"Add new task\" in the menu, I get the create task dialog. I can complete it but when I hit  the \"Save\" button, I just get the animated wheel and \"Save\" (pic below).  I've let it run for quite some time.  I have to hit cancel and KB runs normally.\n\n- Tried \"Create tasks in bulk\" at the top of each column.  Nothing happens when I click the option.\nAttempted Troubleshooting\n- Tried multiple projects with the same result\n- Upgraded from 1.0.34 to 1.0.36 - no change\n- chmod the SQLite db from 644 to 777 - no change. So for kicks and grins (and I'm getting desperate) I also tried the following:\n\nTried in a different browser - this time IceCat (Firefox derivative) just to make sure it wasn't webkit causing the problem.\nChanged the server PHP version to 7.0\n\n`\nApplication version: 1.0.36\nPHP version: 7.0.14\nPHP SAPI: cgi-fcgi\nOS version: Linux 2.6.32-673.26.1.lve1.4.18.el6.x86_64\nDatabase driver: sqlite\nDatabase version: 3.8.5\nBrowser: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:45.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/45.0\n\n`\nNeither fixed the problem.  I notice the browser user agent reports as Windows.. interesting as I'm running Arch Linux on the desktop.. Starting using \"Deck\" which is a NextCloud app.  Don't like it as much so I thought I'd check back and see if this issue had been addressed.  \nI installed 1.0.43 and the problem remains.  The behavior changed a little bit when \"Add new task\".  When I hit \"Save\" instead of getting the indefinitely spinning \"working\" icon, it goes away after a few second and returns the the Add Task dialogue.  The task was not saved. Other than that, behvior is identical to what I described above. \nIf this is indeed a php/server config issue some pointers on things to check would be greatly appreciated.  I've gone through the recommended prereq's and install directions in the docs line by line and everything looks good.. @rautamiekka Not sure I understand the comment/ask.

Now it works fine with those changes. Does that shed any light on the issue?. @fguillot just tried 1.0.48 and I have the same issue. What info do you need from me to help debug this further?. Just to confirm, this issue is still present in the latest version 1.2.0. Thanks. Sure, either way it would be nice to be able to choose to get notified.. It's the latest in CentOS 7. But surely that's not the issue here? It worked before 1.0.40.. @izno does my patch fix your problem too?. Maybe that's something to do with my issue; comments moved to task_comments and I've done upgrades in place so I still have the directory \"comments\". I'll have to try a fresh install and migrate my config to it.. Tried a fresh install and still have this issue. To restore functionality I must patch app/Template/task/show.php (as mentioned in my first comment) and then restore the app/Template/comments directory from a previous version.

Same here, had to install all plugins manually in the new version\n. @skywalker89 \nJust upload plugins to \"plugins\" folder.\nWhen you unzip plugins, please make sure that each individual plugin have a proper parent folder with a plugin name, I have found out that some plugins I have found on github, do not have a parent folder, so had to create when before unzipping..

    "whinote": "Is this best implemented in a plugin or in the base code? Is this something that a plugin developer could write for a fee?\nOur team has been trying a few things in the base code but nothing has proven to be the same as what we saw in Trello. We like Kanboard and its features much more and the voting option would just extend our use of the application for other things in our office.. That is very close to how we intended this feature to work. We have developed our own work around but it exists mainly outside of the kanboard and is not as clean as it being natively developed inside the app. It would be really great to see something like this added into the application.\nWe were hoping to use it as an idea board of sorts. Users can vote on tasks and if there is enough interest and it is technically feasible it moves from the ideas column to planning and progresses through our development process. It is a way for users to see the devops lifecycle in action. They vote and give feedback with comments. Tasks are updated and statuses are changed by developers which notifies users of progress. It is an easy way to engage users without having to engage them at a specific time during conference calls and meetings. They can interact at times that are convenient to them.\nBy allowing them to down vote and provide comments we can also see why a particular idea or feature would be bad or impact other users even though one user may think it is beneficial.\nRRRRoger is using this specifically for a team and we do that as well but we want to bridge a huge gap with our user community that is spread all over the country by providing a way for them to steer the development ship without having to attend every meeting and conference call but still provide much needed interaction and feedback. Plus, there are times outside of meetings when inspiration hits and they can update the board themselves without having to reach out to my team to update a board they never see.\nWe would like the votes to be one per user per task whether it is an up or down vote.\nRRRRoger\u2019s mockup looks really good as well and sorting by votes would be really nice feature to have.\nThanks for considering this and thank you RRRRoger for providing additional input and including a visual aid!\nFrom: RRRRoger notifications@github.com\nReply-To: kanboard/kanboard reply@reply.github.com\nDate: Thursday, April 6, 2017 at 1:37 PM\nTo: kanboard/kanboard kanboard@noreply.github.com\nCc: Scotty Hinote willie.s.hinote@nasa.gov, Mention mention@noreply.github.com\nSubject: Re: [kanboard/kanboard] Add voting to tasks - Enhancement Request (#3053)\nI'm new to this community and i'm zero-technical so i can't technically explain in detail how it would work.

    "cose385": "Currently I can't contribute to Github, so I'll attache the file - this is for Croatian language (locale hr_HR):\ntranslations.zip\nThis is the first version which works, but there's still some work to do on missing translations for less used options.. If everything is properly set up - that file should be loaded only once and afterwards browser will use it from local cache and should be no problem in later usage.. Ideal solution would be to have completely separated .js for mobile browsers with minimal functionality - or maybe even different template set. I was just prepared to open similar task since I'm also missing this functionality and have to search in multiple rounds to cover title, description and sub-tasks (crucial data in tasks is split between those).\nSo my suggestion would be to extend your feature request to also include sub-task text and comments (beside titles and description).\nThat way it would search everything at once which is much faster - same default search behavior should be also implemented on the dashboard, when searching all projects.. Not quite - #2552 is referring to filtering to your tasks in the board view and this is about seeing subtasks in the Dashboard.. True that, but later discussion was focused primarily on filtering - dashboard was not mentioned afterwards.. Dear @Richard76000,\nlike many others - Kanboard is open source project built by contribution of volunteers. You didn't pay for the privilege of using it and you can't demand everything from anyone here. Your suggestion is just that - a suggestion, nothing more.\nYou can, however, join in as a volunteer and add missing functionality. If you are not the programmer or don't have time \"waste\" on this project - than you can, at least, be fair enough and acknowledge others who contributed.\nOr maybe the best thing of all both to fill your need and contribute to Kanboard - pay someone on Upwork (or similar site) who can program needed functionality and then donate result to this project..

Grease-Monky Solution works, many thanks.. ",
    "raffaelj": "@juergenniessen If you just want to hide something on your screen you can use a simple workaround by using custom CSS styles in your browser.\nAn example for the Firefox-Stylish-Plugin:\ncss\n@-moz-document url(\"https://your-public-link-with-long-token\") {\n  td.board-column-93 {display: none;}\n  th.board-column-header-93 {display: none;}\n  td.board-column-94 {display: none;}\n  th.board-column-header-94 {display: none;}\n}\nNow the columns with the specified IDs aren't visible anymore.. I found a second and easier solution. You don't even need a plugin. Just use a custom stylesheet inside the kanboard configuration:\ncss\n.public-board th.board-column-header-94,\n.public-board td.board-column-94\n{display:none;}. I think you deleted some of your text accidentally. I don't understand your intention right now. Now I see the problem.\nBut if you use Stylish you can de-/activate your custom styles with one or two clicks and you're able to hide and show your columns during a presentation.\nI thought about this nice2have problem again and now I have a third solution. If you use the Greasemonkey-Add-on you can use this code to hide and show any column by clicking on the header of a column:\nedit: the following script has some issues. Scroll down for a working example.\n```javascript\n// ==UserScript==\n// @name        kanboard_hide_column_2\n// @namespace   kanboard_raffaelj\n// @include     https://your-public-link-with-long-token\n// @version     1\n// @grant       none\n// ==/UserScript==\n/ temp class name for hiding some elements /\nvar className = \"hidden\";\nvar css = document.createElement(\"style\");\ncss.type = \"text/css\";\ncss.innerHTML = \".hidden * { display: none }\";\ndocument.body.appendChild(css);\n/ useful functions with code from http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/ /\nfunction toggleClass(el){\n  if (el.classList) {\n    el.classList.toggle(className);\n  } else {\n    var classes = el.className.split(' ');\n    var existingIndex = classes.indexOf(className);\nif (existingIndex >= 0)\n  classes.splice(existingIndex, 1);\nelse\n  classes.push(className);\n\nel.className = classes.join(' ');\n\n}\n}\nfunction hasClass(el){\n  if (el.classList){\n    if (el.classList.contains(className)) return true;\n  } else{\n    if (new RegExp('(^| )' + className + '( |$)', 'gi').test(el.className)) return true;\n  }\n}\n/ set/toggle hidden-class and small width for column header /\nfunction toggleColumn(){\n  var id = this.getAttribute('data-column-id');\n  if (hasClass(this)){\n    this.style.removeProperty('width');\n    //console.log(\"show column with id: \" + id);\n  } else {\n    this.style.width = \"2px\";\n    //console.log(\"hide column with id: \" + id);\n  }\n  toggleClass(document.querySelector('td.board-column-' + id));\n  toggleClass(this);\n}\n/ if click on column header --> toggle column width /\nvar selector = \".public-board th\";\nvar elements = document.querySelectorAll(selector);\nArray.prototype.forEach.call(elements, function(el, i){\n  el.addEventListener('click', toggleColumn);\n});\n``. OK, now I see the problem. I tested it in a new project without a second swimlane and it worked well.\nI'm sorry, but I don't have any idea how to manipulatecolspan` with pure CSS.\nIt would be possible with javascript but I realized that my quick Greasemonkey solution above has some issues, too.  The current version sets only the content of the first swimlane to display:none and the whole effect is resetted by the automatic page reload every view seconds.\nI thought it could be so easy :( Maybe I'll give it a try later.... @juergenniessen \nI don't like unsolved riddles so I created a gist with a greasemonkey user script:\nhttps://gist.github.com/raffaelj/032400ab56e816ca8489f6e49296a88e\nFeel free to use it.\nfunctions:\n left click on headline of column to collapse\n left click on collapsed headline to expand\nthe magic:\n eventListener click on .public-board th\n set cookie with comma-separated ids of columns\n  * push and pop current clicked id\n set some CSS and a class to collapse columns and hide content\n refresh page after each click to load user script again and apply styles to all column-ids stored in cookie\ntested with kanboard master repository from 12th March 2017\nand with Firefox 52.0.1 (32-Bit) on Windows 7 64 bit\nusing Greasemonkey 3.10\npreview:\n\n.

Hopefully it gets committed and pushed out to you soon; or you can just merge my patch manually..

What do you think about the \"Users\" group being implicitly created as group 0 or group -1, and implicitly adding that group ID to to the return of getGroups($userId). Oh awkward. Did you manage to fix this? Probably you'd have to go in with sqllite and tweak settings at that level, I'd imagine.\nI sort of think the current system is good, though. It Keeps It Simple, Stupid.

    "jpcanepa": "If the number of tasks is more than 1000, I think this is a duplicate of #3280. I agree with @inful that the current implementation does not make much sense. I think it was written with the assumption that projects normally don't repeat names. Today, the code just does a query for projects with the given name, and returns the first that the SQL engine returns, whatever that one may be (see getByName in ProjectModel, that is only used by this API, BTW).\nI'd vote for removing the original method and replacing it by @be-ndee propopsal of getProjectsByName that performs a \"like\" search to return projects that have the supplied string as part of their names. At least that behavior can be documented more consistently, I think. The current API doc for the getProjectByName (see here) kind of implicitly suggest the assumption is there is only one project by the supplied name.. I mean, no one is stopping you from opening a pull request, @samwaus. Go ahead, give it a shot! It's up the the maintainer (@fguillot) to merge it in, but no harm done in proposing a solution.. If I understand correctly, the issue is that whoever is emitting the SQL statement is trying to flatten all task IDs at the application level for the SELECT statement to pick the correct tasks, instead of using the SQL engine to determine the set of IDs. I'm assuming that the actual set of IDs is so that there exists an SQL query that would return all those IDs.\nIf this is indeed the problem, I can think of two similar solutions, both apparently supported by sqlite:\n\nWrite the task id list as a nested select statement, something like\nSELECT bla FROM ble WHERE somthing IN (SELECT id FROM tasks WHERE condition)\ninstead of using the list of IDs explicitly.\nAlong the same lines, create a view with the statement that would produce the list of ids that should go in the \"IN\" clause. \n\nDoes any of this make sense, or am I reading the problem all wrong? If so, I could try to explore the alternatives.. Looking through the code, this query seems to be coming from the getTagsByTaskIds method of the TaskTagModel. Looking for callers, you get that is called from both the TaskListFormatter and the BoardFormatter (which makes sense).\nIn both cases, the query to collect the task ids is executed in the caller, and the ids passed into the getTagsByTaskIds function. \nMaybe the way to go is to add a new method called something like getTagsByTaskIdsQuery which instead of receiving a list of task ids, it receives the query object that can be chained with the actual query for the tags.\nThere is a another call to getTagsByTaskIds from TaskExport. That one also collects the task ids through a query, but a much more complex one. I don't know enough as to know if that could be a problem.. If I understand correctly, the engine used to construct the SQL statements is PicoDB, by @fguillot. I think we need his feedback to determine how hard would be to use two sql descriptions to build a single query with a nested SELECT.. I think I know how to fix this, but I've been trying to reproduce the issue to no avail. @mpolak83, could you share your database file (anonymized if needed, like replacing all tasks description/titles with garbage)? . Thanks, @sudoman. I did the same thing (though directly in through the sqlite CLI), yet I could not reproduce the issue. I'll try your script anyway, just in case I missed something and report back..

Then we can register that in the time sheet what is tracked and manually added...\n\n\nHere it could be an example on real case scenario:\nI have 0.15h spent time tracked from a sub-task and 2h original estimated time:\n\nThen I can adjust the time spent in the sub-task manually to 1.15... it's registered as total time spent in the overview:\n\nBut this adjustment is not registered under Timetracking? Which can be kind of confusing...\n\nIn the yellow field overview it is 1.5h time spent \u2013 but then only 0.15h Timespent...\n- It should have been 0.15 tracked & 1h manually added. I've looked at the template hooks in the documentation:\n```\n$this->template->hook->attach('template:dashboard:layout', 'my_template:dashboard:layout', array(\n    'my_dashboard_var' => 'my_val',\n));\n```\n...but how can can I access the \"my_val\" in my template?\nAny hint is very appreciated.. ...just a clarification:\nThe link it selt is working fine to clear the \"web-notifications\", but trying to unchech the check-box will open the blank page and clear/markes everything on th list as read.\n\u2013 The green part: OK\n\u2013 The red part: Opens the blank page\n\n.

Instead we need an project option (enable backlog, enable done as separate column). Then, when creating swimlanes the backlog and done column are NOT included in the swimlane / column matrix. In templates we then can query for enable_backlog ==1 enable_done == 1\nProblem for me is, that I don't know, how the whole task positioning is done.

I don\u2019t think this is a security hole because I could only reproduce for projects I\u2019m a member OR for every project when the user is an application admin, hence has access to all of the projects even not being a member of them. When an admin user is not a member of a project, they just don\u2019t appear as a possible assignee on tasks opened on that projects nor the projects appears on projects selector for them, but as admin they can still see project management and manage every project. \nI tested this with a user with a role Manager and User and I could not open tasks from projects I\u2019m not a member. . This behavior happens because:\nOn kanboard/app/Controller/TaskViewController.php, method show is used the getTask() method to get the task to be shown. This method is defined on kanboard/app/Controller/BaseController.php:\nphp\n    protected function getTask()\n    {\n        $project_id = $this->request->getIntegerParam('project_id');\n        $task = $this->taskFinderModel->getDetails($this->request->getIntegerParam('task_id'));\n        if (empty($task)) {\n            throw new PageNotFoundException();\n        }\n        if ($project_id !== 0 && $project_id != $task['project_id']) {\n            throw new AccessForbiddenException();\n        }\n        return $task;\n    }\nThere is a check to see if the task\u2019s project id matches the project_id parameter, and an AccessForbiddenException is thrown if it\u2019s not equal. The problem is that this if also checks if project_id is different from 0: ($project_id !== 0 && $project_id != $task['project_id']), and project id is retrieved using $this->request->getIntegerParam('project_id');, which is defined on kanboard/app/Core/Http/Request.php and returns 0 if the parameter is not an integer. \nRemoving this $project_id !== 0 && from kanboard/app/Controller/BaseController.php would certainly get the behaviour you are expecting but I\u2019m afraid it might break another thing that calls this method when there is no project_id parameter on url. \nA more safe way to do this would be checkin directly in show() method of TaskViewController:\nphp\n    public function show()\n    {\n        $task = $this->getTask();\n        if ($task['project_id'] != $this->request->getIntegerParam('project_id')) {\n            throw AccessForbiddenException::getInstance()->withoutLayout();\n        }\nIf you prefer you may replace AccessForbiddenException with PageNotFoundException\nAlso, keep in mind that the same way we may break other methods from other controller by changing inside getTask, changing only inside show() from TaskViewController will change only this one. The others that does not check for project_id will keep showing tasks data. \nI\u2019m telling you this so you can change your Kanboard to behave the way you want, but I\u2019m not PRing this because I don\u2019t know for sure it will not break some scenario. I don\u2019t know why that project_id === 0 exception is there.

For document purpose, the commit that included that \"if\": https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/commit/2d5621af2f3678ce4959a450663f5657098144bc. Maybe this was related to #3625?\n@emahuni, did you update to v1.2.6? Does the issue happens in v1.2.6?. @creecros yes but the fact the placeholder is not shown shouldn\u2019t make the card end up in the wrong column.. prior to v1.2.6 you had the problem where your card sometimes disappeared, went to other swimlanes or columns, solved on issue #3625. I asked him if he had updated his kanboard because on current version, even without placeholder, you are sure your card will end up in te column you are hovering it with. \nI\u2019ve made a video showing that even with dozens of cards, the placeholder doesn\u2019t show but the card goes to the right column: https://photos.app.goo.gl/a9cDc6JNKSERRTgTA\nNot saying this is not an issue, just trying to help the reporter. It was very annoying when the card went to the wrong place . Apparently this bug was introduced by #4005\nRemoving the width: 300px from .select-dropdown-input-container selector gets the expected behaviour...\n\n. I thing this should be configurable, then. We use one project per team and we're currently running for over 2 years. We have exactly 2648 closed tasks and showing all tasks takes several seconds. Maybe putting this setting as a constant in config.php would be easier to implement and will solve your issue without messing with everyone's kanboards. Sorry to ask, but how many tasks does your project has?\nWe have a project with over 2000 tasks done, this behaviour would break kanboards usability, because browsers take many seconds to render all the tasks... I think a better solution would be to make the default filter configurable, at least globally, by instalation, maybe (config.php).. I have a swimlane with 127 tasks total and another with over 2500. Keeping only the smaller swimlane opened does not reduce tasks rendering time.\nI guess it is easier to implement at global level (can be a simple new constant on config.php), if it suits your needs, but I don't know what most users expect. . Ok I\u2019ll create the tests. Sorry about the braces. . @fguillot I've changed one test that already existed, adding a new action with a category_id = 0 paramenter and created another test with an action that takes an owner_id as parameter. This test creates 2 actions, one to a valid user and another to \"unassigned\".\nI wasn't sure if I could make this way or if I should've made separated test for each scenario, like\n\ntestCloneProjectWithActionTaskAssignSpecificUser\ntestCloneProjectWithActionTaskAssignSpecificUserUnassigned\ntestCloneProjectWithActionTaskAssignColorCategoryNoCategory\n\nBut I think those names would not make sense because the tests are named based on the action class name...\nPlease tell me what do you think is better and if necessary I change the code.\n. @loveprograming I had a similar problem and solved it by making a webhook that fixes my due dates. On kanboard/app/Template/project_header/dropdown.php, to decide if the \"Configure this project\" link will be shown on project dropdown menu, it is checked if the user has access to the ProjectEditController show method, but the link is to ProjectViewController show method:\nphp\n        <?php if ($this->user->hasProjectAccess('ProjectEditController', 'show', $project['id'])): ?>\n            <li>\n                <?= $this->url->icon('cog', t('Configure this project'), 'ProjectViewController', 'show', array('project_id' => $project['id'])) ?>\n            </li>\n        <?php endif ?>. I've found on commit 3043163747b13ce1942b2e55977cf7c5417021de that the file app/Model/ProjectUserRoleModel.php had this change:\n\nHowever, the file ProjectGroupRoleModel.php doesn't have this modification.\nWhen I made the same change to ProjectGroupRoleModel.php, I've got the expected behaviour. Found closed issue #2786 also about this problem and with same solution. What version of kanboard are you using? I tried and could not reproduce your issue...\nIf I hover the description preview:\n\nIf I click on the task:\n\nIf I click on the task's edit button:\n\n.

I suggest you to update your Kanboard instance.\nApparently it was fixed on this commit:\nhttps://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/commit/1268c0023d7085fb4d960b869bf79ef0ade0d212. I've added a new \"if\" instead of replacing the top \"if\" because the dropdown menu is still useful even with this project restriction. The dropdown shows other operations such as comment, add links, etc. that are not restricted by that custom role.\nThe \"edit\" option inside the dropdown on https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/0deaeb58e60097b7f0882a05481253ff99a5a65a/app/Template/task/dropdown.php#L4-L18 is already hidden by this same permission check. You can do so enabling public access:\nConfigure this project > Public access > enable public access\nA \"Public link\" will be generated. This is a read only view to your board, anyone with this link can view it. At this read only view there are no headers and other stuff, only the board and the tasks. But it will be read only. \nIf you have any further questions you can ask questions on the Forum. This is happening because you have short tags support enabled on your php server. This should only be On if you are using some old legacy system that was written using short tags. I guess it\u2019s not the case because you\u2019re using php7. \nJust disable it on php.ini:\n```ini\n; This directive determines whether or not PHP will recognize code between\n; <? and ?> tags as PHP source which should be processed as such. It's been\n; recommended for several years that you not use the short tag \"short cut\" and\n; instead to use the full <?php and ?> tag combination. With the wide spread use\n; of XML and use of these tags by other languages, the server can become easily\n; confused and end up parsing the wrong code in the wrong context. But because\n; this short cut has been a feature for such a long time, it's currently still\n; supported for backwards compatibility, but we recommend you don't use them.\n; Default Value: On\n; Development Value: Off\n; Production Value: Off\n; http://php.net/short-open-tag\nshort_open_tag = Off\n```\nBut if you can\u2019t change this setting on your server you could fix this by changing the only 2 files that could cause errors with this config on:\n\napp/Template/feed/project.php\napp/Template/feed/user.php\n\nChange \nphp\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\nTo \nphp\n<?= '<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>' ?>. This is already fixed altough its not released yet, even if you upgrade to 1.2.7.\nYou can either run Kanboard from master branch or apply the fix to your installation:\nhttps://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/commit/fdcda3f10d5248df000e78f952812ddf111877a5\n.

So my only chance is to follow the installation instructions by the letter. The above mentioned instructions for Ubuntu didn't work. I had to install the php-xml additionally. As I searched for this solution a few hours, it is only fair to other new users that they find installation instructions that work right from the beginning.\nI write this, because I find it worth, that more people (not only software programmers) can use this project management tool.. o.k. inconsistent!\nI used the export function as backup for my project. The import back into the data base (or a new data base) didn't work. So the export is obviously only usable for Excel or Calc and not for Kanboard. What a pity!\nI think it is very easy to make the two functions compatible by modifying the order of the columns for the export. Most likely it is no disadvantage for other uses, if the order is modified.. @froschdesign \nSorry, I didn't want to sound unfriendly (and don't know where I did). I'm not a native speaker of the English language, so please forgive me, if I used the wrong words.\nI appreciate fguillot's work and your support very much and thank you for your altruistic engagement.\nMy intuition was to support the software with my experiences as an inexperienced user. I know from my own work that it is always good to have people look at your projects who are not involved, because they use things differently than you expected.\nSo, keep it up and best wishes for the new year!. yes, hours. But if you ask so, I obviously missed something?. @fguillot Thanks! After I added the zip extension and restarted the computer, the plugins work now:\nsudo apt-get install php-zip\nSorry for the late answer -I was in holidays ;-). I'm only a simple user with no knowledge of data bases, so I took the easy way: I exported my only project to csv, emptied the \"data\" directory an began with kanboard from scratch. The import attempt led me to the next problem (see my other thread about import/export) as the no admin problem was the result of my problems with the plugins where I read in the forum that only managers can see the gantt view .... As the portable edition is an .exe-file I think it's only for Windows. But for Linux (Ubuntu / Linux Mint) sqlitebrowser is in the repositories and therefore easy to install.\nWhen I see it right, the modifications can be done also without sql-code directly in the sqlite browser under the \"browse data\" tab in the table \"users\". You have to open the data base (db.sqlite in the data-directory) with administrator-rights to be able to modify the data. Otherwise it is opened read-only.. ",

Update: I did some more investigation and it seems as if the problems comes from the combination with Lighttpd.\nI tested the setup on a Debian9 machine with Lighttpd and experienced the same problem. Then I replaced Lighttpd by Apache2 (still on the VM) and I could not reproduce the problem.\nI haven't tested Apache on the Raspi, though.

Thank you for your answers!\nI ended up installing apache after all and now everything works fine with that workaround.\nMaybe I'll try Nginx soon, I haven't used it before.\nNevertheless I think that the locked database is not what causes the issue here or at least that my original problem is not caused by the rasperry's IO, because I experienced the same problem on my Debian-VM. The raspberry is accessing peripheral storage devices, but the VM's host has a pretty good internal hard drive.\nAnother observation:\nBoth the apache server and lighttpd are running the same instance of kanboard. (Not at the same time, of course.) When switching between the servers, the error is persistent: While I do not see any problems with apache, after switching back to lighttpd it's the same task that is broken as before switching forth and back..

    "Kolossi": "@fguillot : I similarly get these errors (e.g. when trying to add a predefined content) on docker.\nThe proposed fix solved the issue for me at least.. I'm new here, but a recent and enthusiastic convert to kanboard (running under docker on my synology nas).\nIf it is indeed a sprint as @lastlink mentioned, why not just use a sprint tag on the tasks e.g. \"sprint_2018.01\" and then filter by the tag?\nOr use separate projects and \"Bigboard\" plugin?. My suggestion for tags was so that you won't have swimlanes, just tags which have no weight/baggage/piling when there are none matching.\nThe use of swimlanes here seems from the description a little ... shall we say \"nonstandard\".  Swimlanes usually get used for different priorities/sources (customer vs internal)/blocked.  They don't tend to \"pile up\".\nMaybe time to step back and reassess whether there's a better way to achieve the (no-doubt genuine) requirements than swimlanes rather than bend swimlanes to the will of this particular nonstandard usage?\nMy bigboard suggestion was to possibly use different projects rather than different swimlanes.  Projects already have the concept of start and end date.\nI get that neither tags nor projects work for you though, just a suggestion - I'll wind my neck back in.  :-). Have you tried\nBoard -> Menu -> Settings ->Predefined contents\nSeems to do all you ask? - once you've set some, they are choose-able under the new task description.\n. Hmm I hadn't seen that.\nBut it doesn't seem that /var/spool is hooked up to anything.\nIf I do crontab -u nginx -e then it gets placed in /etc/crontabs/nginx.\nI also tried adding\n* * * * * date >> /tmp/crontest.etc to /etc/crontabs/nginx (with crontab -e)\nand\n* * * * * date >> /tmp/crontest.var to /var/spool/crontabs/nginx\nand yes only /tmp/crontext.etc got created.\nSo it would seem from this that my proposed change would fix it up and /docker/var/spool should be removed?\nI don't think it's the case but perhaps it depends on the underlying docker host?  I run it on the Docker package on a Synology DS415+ NAS.  It would kind of defeat the object of docker if that were the case though.\nSo I guess the question is - \"is anyone running the current docker image and getting the daily background job running ok?\". ... the above all from within the container via\ndocker exec -it kanboard bash. UPDATE - Last night I had\n /var/spool/crontabs/nginx with 1 0 * * * ... schedule\n /etc/crontabs/nginx with 0 8 * * * ... schedule\nThe job fired only at 08:00. The bug is that the title attribute is used when it should not be, which is an issue when using a screenreader - in the same way that there's always a subset of uses that lead to any bug.\nOP has given good resources for someone to address this. If \"bugwatcher\" is automated, maybe that's why it thought it was a discussion?\nI'd agree with OP that this is a bug and wish I had the time to address it.. Can I comment here on a related note -  I've seen the previous replies, where it's said that the markdown rendering follows the standard regarding how to treat whitespace etc in the source.  I don't disagree with what's been said on that.\nBut what does seem to happen is that the text entered is rendered into markdown, and then the markdown decompiled back to a \"standard\" source and then resaved in place of the edited text.\nThis sometimes results in change in behaviour after a second edit.\nI would assert that the source text edited by the user should be left untouched with whatever whitespace or not they put in, but of course then rendered according to markdown standards.\nHowever - this is where I hope my comment is relevant!  If there is the ability to decompile some rendered text and turn it back into a markdown \"source\" - perhaps that should be used on any pasted text, which would allow a fix of gerald2545's issue.  Even if the text box is \"strictly\" following standard, I agree that it's poor that the ui doesn't cope well with pasted text.\nJust my 2c. ",
    "witsec": "We found a workaround that works for us for now, so I'm closing this one.. That could be an idea, yes. Although it would certainly help if I was able to hide those (active) backlog swimlanes through filters. Right now the tasks disappear when you filter on swimlane, but the swimlane itself remains visible.\nI could then edit the \"backlog\" when I change the filters, which would be a good solution for my issue.. We're more than happy to use filters and they hide tasks that don't match the filter, but the (then empty) swimlanes will still be visible, so that'll pile up real quick.\nThe bigboard plugin combines multiple projects into a single view. That isn't what we're looking for I'm afraid.. We were digging through the code and found a way that works great for us. The code code can be found here: https://github.com/witsec/kanboard (it's currently based on v1.2.3).\nIt's a bit quick and dirty now, because we simply wanted to see if this worked. It's not forked yet.\nThere's also a Docker container available, so you can quickly test it if you want: https://hub.docker.com/r/witsec/kanboard/\nWhat this does is when you use a filter with \"swimlane:texthere\", it hides all swimlanes that don't contain tasks anymore. This allows us to use the active swimlanes as backlog as well and also sort swimlanes in a certain order.\nIf such a functionality would be built-in, that would be awesome!. We also made another tiny change. If you create a new task, you can select the swimlane it should be part of. But when you edit a task, the option to change the swimlane isn't there. And so we've added that option there.\nWe found that sometimes tasks were in the wrong swimlane (by mistake). The swimlane it should have been part of was hidden because of swimlane filters (which hides empty swimlanes). You can now simply edit the task and change its swimlane and then when saved, the swimlane it should've been part of is automatically displayed again.. ",

    "emahuni": "ok, let me enable desktop mode thanks.. Yes I am using a mobile device, but that is besides the point.\nTake a look at this to understand what I mean: https://site.gitscrum.com\nThere is a time when the user waits between clicking, grabbing the card and moving it to its intended target. The board doesn't show these states clearly.\nNot all people need to understand the dragging process. The end-user must feel the product such that it's just intuitive to use. Most users click and wait trying to figure out if the card has been grabbed, then they move it... You actually do it everyday when lifting objects. You feel that the object has nudged a little so that signals you can safely move it; that's procedural knowledge you gained over the years. On the board however, we don't have such sensory feedback, so you use quick noticable visual cues to do that so that you don't give the user a congnitive load deciding on such micro interactions.\nWhat I am just saying is don't give the user an unnecessary cognitive load, that's a bad thing. They will hate the product.\nSo tilting the card, enlarging the card or something that's clearly visually noticable can aid to that fact. Most Kanban boards do this and it has become procedural knowledge, don't break that knowledge otherwise users will hate the product. \nAs is, this board design breaks that knowledge by not giving a clear visual signal to show that the card has been grabbed successfully. If it's there it is not noticable.. True.. I used three issues to address three different issues that can be closed independently. I closed the other one about card dragging #4024 \n, you resolved that one; it was mobile mode playing havoc as usual. But this one isn't out of the woods yet, please bear with.\nI think you miss-understood me. In your above example if that source column was very long such that you had to scroll down to the source task, moving that issue to the short target column isn't easy regardless of platform.\nThat's where the highlight whole column comes in (just a change of background color for the target column, nothing special). It would be easier and intuitive if the whole target column is highlighted as the drop target since in this case the user can't see the dotted lines (they are out of view, somewhere up there).\nAnother thing would be to put sticky column headers that stay visible when the user scrolls to the bottom on long columns. Column headers shouldn't scroll out of view <= that's a separate issue on its own, may I please open it :smile: ?\nAll this is to help address issues with an user-friendly and intuitive user-interface.\nRemember:\n- columns can be very long and tasks scroll out of view\n- dragging issues blindly to another column isn't intuitive.\n- tasks are not always dragged to the next column so user needs to know the target column\n- use it as a user not as the developer and you will understand what I am hammering at.. > Try it on desktop mode, then report back. You should find that the dotted lines will appear where you are dragging, regardless of how long that column is.\nUmmm it doesn't, I don't know whether this is a mobile browser issue or something, I did it in desktop mode, oh and desktop mode changes a lot of things by the way :+1: \n Could you show it in a capture as you did above? . oh i see where you are not getting me, you are doing the exact opposite of what I was explaining.\nDo this:\n- scroll your long column to the bottom until you can't see the short column tasks nor the bottom-most part where you can drag tasks to\n- then drag a task from the long column to the short column\n\nSince the short column is scrolled out of view, there are no dotted lines shown. \n\nThis is not an error, it's a design issue, whereby one doesn't know where they are dropping the task..

    "frederikmoellers": "Agreed, it's arguably a bug. I was unsure whether to call it a bug or a feature request, I guess it's somewhere in between (then again I though I'd get more attention with a supposed bug than with a feature request \ud83d\ude05).\nMy problem with the first proposed solution (run the cronjob for email notifications once a day) is that emails are then only sent once a day. I'd still like to be notified the moment a task is due (or at most 15min after). However, I don't want to be notified every 15 min (or even every day, for that matter). Also, it still generates one web notification every 15 minutes, which I find weird.\nIf actions were supported for individual tasks, I could imagine creating an action \"send email\" and another one \"push due date\" when the due date hits. However, I can only do that for a whole project, not an individual task (or subtask). That's the problem with the second solution. It only works for whole projects, if I understand correctly.\nMy preferred solution would be this: You have a configurable value \"Send due date notifications at most every ...\" (maybe for each project individually, maybe for the whole installation). Then the due date checker sends the first notifications and saves the time of the notification. Whenever it's run again, it checks whether a new notification is due and if yes, sends that one and updates the saved timestamp.\nHowever, I can imagine not many people feel a need for this feature. If that's the case I'll search for some workaround (maybe being notified once a day is enough if we set due dates a day earlier) and implement the feature myself when I find the time.. I do have the plugin installed. I don't actively use it yet because I only started using KanBoard very recently and I have not yet encountered a situation where I need it. For now I thought that the regular email notifications from KB itself are enough. Only just now I noticed that the plugin's actions apply to individual tasks instead of the parent project.\nThus, I would very much appreciate such functionality in your plugin, but I fully understand if you don't want to implement it for a single random person if you don't even need it yourself. I can try to make a pull request someday.. I just tested the new plugin and it seems to work fine :blush: \nI got 2 emails at the same time for the same task that passed its due date, but no additional mail afterwards (for a day). I'll try to see if I can find out why this happened, but so far I'm reall happy with the feature.\nThank you so much for implementing it!. ",

    "vincowl": "Seems that installed plugins list is right, whereas plugin's status list (Install, Up to date, Upgrade) is wrong. Could not already find a common specificity to the plugins which status is erroneous. I just tried to remove the docker container and recreate it since plugins are persisted in mapped volumes. Indeed, the problem seems to be solved, at least with Customizer. Other plugins are still wrongly marked as not installed (Broadcast Message for instance)... Strange..... So, why not adding a \"status:all\" default filter and an option in kanboard's setup to choose a default filter to apply instead of forcing the actual behavior ? Several issues seems to have a close need as this one : #4076, #3694, #3581, #3413, #3225\nMaybe a bit more explanation on this point of view ?. Did not take it as an offense ^^ Just 2 opposites points of view. If I have a \"Done\" column, as often done (maybe it isn't a best practice...), closed tasks should be seen in this column and then shown ... by default.\nSo : best compromise could be a way to let the user choose its default filter among pre-defined and customized filters ?. @loonies Where is it stated as a universal rule that visible task closely means being open ????? THAT is a non sense... Github is a public area where different opinions may be expressed. Being condescendant does not help at all to make things go further... Kanban is just a method that can fit various workflows or way of conceiving work traceability, not a set of fixed rules that fit one point of view. I understand and can conceive that this is not a common use... Ok, fine ! You disagree... Fine too ! I just don't understand how this comment helps....

I don't have so much tasks indeed. For such large projects, I use Gitlab.\nJust for my personal info, do the use of swimlanes reduces tasks' rendering ?\nFinally, it seems that everyone agrees to say that this optional default filter may be a good option. Would it be better to set it up at a global level or at the project's one ?. Ok. Thanks for this info. I didn't have a look at the page's structure.\nImplementation at global level would be perfect to me since all my projects in this Kanboard instance follow the same guidelines. But that would be a pain if projects are not consistent in a single Kanboard instance. If this global variable is not set, it should of course behave as is.\nTo have an idea of my needs, check the related PR (note the point that closed tasks should then be added to open ones in dashboard view). I just found out that I forgot to modify the tasks count in a project's overview.\n. @fguillot I have already done it. But as said in #4100, this project organization also implies to modify the overview dashboard to also count closed tasks in columns, and it means to change the default behavior, not just a way to change the filters. That's why @rafacamargo123's proposal seems ways better to me than simply just add a custom filter.\nIf default or unset value implies to keep the actual behavior then it won't have any impact on people. @creecros \nThanks a lot for these infos. I had no time before, but I will have a look at it in the next days. Indeed the solution is to design a plugin since I don't want to maintain a fork for this tool and prefer to take advantage of the community's improvements.\nI am lacking infos on how to do it and more precisely on what can be made or not. As I tried to explain, the need is not only limited to the filter aspect but also to the analysis part (I mean include closed tasks to statistics given on the analysis project's mode, but also on dashboards and overviews). How far can a plugin modify the actual behavior ? If this can be done, I will have a look on how to design a plugin.  Thanks !!. ",
