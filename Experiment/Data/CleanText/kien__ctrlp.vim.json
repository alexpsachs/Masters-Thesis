    "kien": "OK, I added this to the dev branch, check it out: https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/tree/develop\nLet me know if you find any problem.\n. Sorry, I don't think I understand what you're trying to say here. <up> and <down> should move the selection up and down in the match window. Does <down> behave differently for you?\n. Yes, I got it  (Github removed the <up> and <down> in your comment). As for the bug, the <up> and <down> mappings are basically just this:\nvim\nnnoremap <buffer> <silent> <up> k\nnnoremap <buffer> <silent> <down> j\nI'm guessing something in your setup changes this. You might be able to track it down with maparg() and mapcheck(), but if you just want to avoid <up> and <down> you can add this to your .vimrc, and ctrlp won't touch these 2 keys:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings = {\n    \\ 'PrtSelectMove(\"j\")': ['<c-n>', '<c-j>'],\n    \\ 'PrtSelectMove(\"k\")': ['<c-p>', '<c-k>'],\n    \\ }\n. Thanks Juan, looks like this is a problem with ncurses on OSX 10.6.3:\n\nInstead of their proper action, they all quit the program and printed -respectively- \u201cOA\u201d, \u201cOB\u201d, \u201cOC\u201d and \u201cOD\u201d on the stdout.\nhttp://www.uponmyshoulder.com/blog/2010/os-x-10-6-3-broke-ncurses/\n\nAnd using those keys in Vim will just enter insert mode and insert A, B, C, D.\nSo I'm not sure if I should try to find a work-around for that and include it in the plugin.\n. Nope, not hardcoded.\nPlease try this if you guys have time and let me know if it solves the problem for you:\nvim\nif has('mac') || has('macunix')\n    nmap <esc>[A <up>\n    nmap <esc>[B <down>\n    nmap <esc>[C <right>\n    nmap <esc>[D <left>\nendif\nAlso, here's a possible external fix:\n\nGo to your home directory, mine is at /Users/myname/\nOpen your .profile and add TERM=linux at the first line of the file.\nSave and quit\nType source .profile and enter\n\nAnd from the comment:\n\nFor the record, if you find that your .profile file does not exist then just go ahead and create it and it should work fine (it did for me)\n\nSource: http://www.techiecorner.com/140/arrow-key-not-working-in-vi-vim-mac-os/\n. OK, I've pushed a fix to the dev branch: https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/tree/develop\nLet me know if it works.\nThanks!\n. You mean using nnoremap instead of nmap? If it works I'll change it to nnoremap or nn for short.\nUnfortunately, there isn't any other way to fix this except disabling the <esc> key (buffer local) when in terminal.\n. OK I've pushed the latest changes to github, here's the relevant line with nn or nnoremap:\nhttps://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/blob/develop/autoload/ctrlp.vim#L673\n. Alright, I think this is a good enough workaround for this problem with ncurses, aside from doing it outside of Vim, or just not mapping <esc>. I'll go ahead and push this to master.\nIf anyone has any suggestion, feel free to comment.\nThanks everyone!\n. Also, I just want to clear this up, since @sorin-ionescu hinted toward it: this wasn't an issue caused by mapping keys with nmap, all the mappings in this plugin use nnoremap or nn from the get-go.\n. How do you think that? Can you explain how something like this can assume everyone uses a VT term? Honest question because I don't really see why:\nvim\nnn <buffer> <silent> <down> j\nIt's just like your typical vimrc line. And it's basically what this plugin uses for every key.\nAlso, the workaround is this, which applies to both xterm* and VT* terminals:\nvim\n    let lcmap = 'nn <buffer> <silent>'\n    if &term =~? 'xterm' || &term =~? '^vt'\n        for each in ['\\A <up>','\\B <down>','\\C <right>','\\D <left>']\n            exe lcmap.' <esc>['.each\n        endfor\n    endif\n. I'm sorry but that doesn't even make sense, detect what automatically?\nAnd it's really not up to me, this is a known problem with Vim in terminal, and ncurses, a lot of results on Google. Yes, other people have run into it when using arrow keys, and the oldest mention of this I could find was from 2003.\nAlso, as I posted above, I didn't come up with the workaround myself either. This workaround and similar ones, have been around for as long as this issue has existed, many years.\n. After changing wildignore or any setting that can potentially filter the results, you'll need to clear the cache by running :ClearAllCtrlPCaches, or pressing <F5> if you already have ctrp-p opened.\nIf that doesn't work, let me know.\n. OK, this looks like it's because of the glob I use to search for dotfiles which is .*, it seems to ignore wildignore for these directories and files. I don't see a way to fix this without removing the dotfiles search functionality altogether.\nSo for now you'll have to use this instead:\nvim\nset wildignore+=*/.git/objects/*\nI'll make some changes to the docs.\n. Also, thank you for reporting this. I've always had the */ for wildignore in my vimrc and just assumed that it'd work without it.\n. Good idea, thank you! I might as well make this an option for the user to change.\n. This has been added: https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/blob/master/doc/ctrlp.txt#L210\n. Hi,\nCan you record the error messages next time this happens? And the task you're doing with it at the time, and let me know your Vim version, which OS etc...\nAlso, not sure if this helps, but you can try reducing the value of g:ctrlp_max_files, the default is 20000. Then use it like that for a while and see how it goes.\nThanks!\n. Closing this for now as too-vague and possibly-unrelated. Please feel free to reopen if you get more infos on this, and if anyone else has this problem as well.\nThanks!\n. You're right. But so far on Twitter I found only 1 segfault tweet by SteveLosh... and then in a reply someone else said this worked fine for him, assuming both people are on OSX.\nWell, since I can't reproduce this, I doubt I can do much about it. I'll try to reduce the plugin's footprint as much as possible, but that's pretty much it. Just use what you like and what works for you.\n. That's great. Thank you! This just prompted me to check all the type() instances.\n. That sounds like something I might use myself, too. So yes, I'll consider adding it once I have some more free time.\nThanks for the suggestion!\n. This has been added and is on the dev branch: https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/tree/develop\nLet me know what you think.\n. Yep, I thought about clearing the cache automatically as well, but if the parent directory is large this might take too long, and if the user wants to force an update they can just use <F5>. I'll look into adding the new entry to the cache.\nPartial matching of dir names is problematic, I think. e.g. a dir name like data can be matched against existing data, database, mydata or death_note_abc etc... and they all can be anywhere in the dir tree or all at the root, with no way to tell which is the one the user really wants. So if you have an idea for this, let me know.\n. Pushed to master. New entry's added to the cache on-the-fly.\nThank you for the suggestions! Closing for now.\n. It's working for me. It doesn't work if you just execute that in the command line, though. So you'll need to put that into your .vimrc and restart Vim.\nAlso, with the current version, you can now use :ResetCtrlP after changing the options (from the command line) to update them without restarting Vim. You still need to put them into .vimrc if you want to keep them permanently, though.\n. Hi,\nCan you rephrase that? I'm not sure I understand what you mean. But if I get it right, then you need to change the g:ctrlp_persistent_input option. Set it to 0 to clear the value in the input field each time CtrlP is called.\ne.g. add this line to your .vimrc:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_persistent_input = 0\n. I'm sorry, I still don't understand what the problem is.\n\nSo, if I press ctrlp (ctrlp is still active) instead to activate the old one try (giving some errors) to open a new instance.\n\nCtrlP is supposed to close each time you open a file from it, or simply move away from the CtrlP window will trigger it to close. \nDoes it do that for you?\n. That sounds like <esc> isn't working. Can you use <c-c> or <c-g> (CTRL-C or CTRL-G) to close CtrlP?\nAlso, are you using Vim in terminal or are you using gVim/MacVim?\n. What does it show when you run :echo &term from Vim's command line? And what OS are you on?\n. This is a really odd behavior and most likely has something to do with the control sequences in terminal (again). So maybe I'll install iTerm and try something out. But for the mean time, I guess you'll just have to use <c-c> or <c-g> to exit CtrlP.\n. OK, I tried to reproduce this with iTerm 1.0 and Vim 7.2 on Snow Leopard but couldn't; <esc> seemed to work fine in both situations, matches and no matches. I guess there's something else in your setup interfering with the <esc> key.\nSo if you don't mind, can you capture the error message like this?\n1. Run :redir @a (redirect to register a)\n2. Call CtrlP and try to reproduce the error with <esc> and \"no matches\".\n3. Exit CtrlP with <c-c> or <c-g>\n4. Run :redir END\n5. Get the content from register a with \"ap and post it here.\n. Closing this for now as unreproducible and since it's a minor issue.\n. Does BundleInstall work if you set it to set wildignore+=.git/*,.hg/*,.svn/*? (without the preceding */)\n. You mean a history of the strings entered in the prompt?\n. Hmm... I usually only type a few characters (4- 5) to find what I want. So I'm not sure a history of these short strings would be really beneficial. Besides, there's already the g:ctrlp_persistent_input (remember the last string) option.\n. Come to think about it, Vim's command line also has a history which I use quite often. So maybe I'll add this (as a history of accepted input strings) and reassign <c-n> and <c-p> to it, just like the default mappings in the command line.\n. This has been added. Thanks!\n. Hi,\nDoes the problem occur if you don't use symbolic link for dir? Also, can you force close ctrlp using <c-c> or <c-g> when the problem happens?\nAnyway, I'll track this down and try to fix it once I'm little less busy. Thank you for reporting this and providing the infos!\n. Yes, you're correct, I did some tests earlier and noticed that as well. For some reason bufwinnr() returns -1 after using ... The weird thing's that it only does that in Vim 7.2, but not in 7.3 and 7.0.\n. That's awesome! Thank you!\nA simple fix is this, since we kind of need that chdir line now for the .. cmd. Let me know if it works for you:\nvim\nif exists('a:2') || ( bufnum > 0 && bufwinnr(buf) > 0 )\n. Oh I already fixed that in my working version. This should do the trick:\nvim\ntry\n    bun!\ncatch\n    winc c\nendtry\nAnyway, I think there should be a better way to solve the problem with bufwinnr(), since we need that bufwinnr() check to close CtrlP in case an user calls another instance of it while still inside the prompt. I'll try to come up with something once I'm done with some works here.\n. I've pushed a fix to the dev branch: https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/tree/develop\nLet me know how that works for you.\n. Pushed to master. Thank you again for all the help!\n. Looks like the # and % need to be escaped since they are special chars. I've pushed a fix to the dev branch:\nhttps://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/tree/develop\nLet me know if it works for you.\n. This has been pushed to master.\nThank you for reporting!\n. This sounds interesting. I'm not sure how marking the files would work, though. Also, because the listed files are matches of the same pattern, it might not be very useful.\n. I got a few ideas of how this could work but so far all seem pretty clunky. I'll definitely give this a shot, though.\n. Added to the dev branch. Let me know what you think.\nUsage: <c-z> to mark/unmark files, <c-o> to open them.\n. I just went ahead and pushed this to master. Thank you for suggesting this feature!\n. Awesome, thank you for donating time! I'll check it out and see what's best (probably will just integrate it instead of merging).\n. OK, looks like adding a new option for this is a little unnecessary. Also, hg locate returns the paths of the files relative to the repo's root, this will make opening files fail when user is in a subdir of the repo and g:ctrlp_working_path_mode is set to 1. git ls-files seems to work perfectly everywhere.\nI think I'll just add a few lines in the doc for these commands and how to set them up correctly.\nThanks!\n. Using --fullpath with hg locate will return paths with mixed \\ and / on Windows and makes opening files fail. I see your point, though, so I'll definitely try to find a fix for this and make it work.\n. Let me know how this works. Instead of hardcoding the commands, this will allow people to use something other than just hg, git or svn.\n. Sorry about that, I forgot to do a check for a:1 after removing another FindRoot call. Just pushed a fix.\nThank you for reporting!\n. Thank you! I'll add a note to the doc about this.\n. You can put either set autowriteall or set hidden in your vimrc to avoid this issue. There's some more info at :help edit_f. I'll add a warning to ctrlp. Thanks for the heads up!\n. Nope, I just use :hide when opening a file in the same window. The effect is the same as having set hidden.\n. This is actually a feature to prevent opening the same file twice by mistake. I'll add an option to toggle it. Thanks for the heads up!\n. It's g:ctrlp_switch_buffer.\n. That map will clear all caches every time CtrlP starts. If you want that behavior, you can simply put this into your vimrc:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_use_caching = 0\nIt's practically the same.\n. You can use <F5> inside CtrlP to clear the cache at anytime, so I think having an extra mapping to do basically the same thing is not necessary. Thanks for the suggestion, though!\n. Sounds like globpath() chokes on these volumes. So I think your best bet would be using g:ctrlp_user_command and set an external tool to use for listing files.\nYou can check :help g:ctrlp_user_command for the syntax.\n. It's because ctrlp currently prepends the opening cmds with :botright. There's no special reason to it, just my personal preference (it helps breaking the new window out of special buffers and narrow windows). I'll remove it and let the user decides. Thanks!\n. Thanks! But when searching for a keyword I often use something like /bo\\>. So it's not really a problem.\n. This has been resolved since v1.5.4. If hidden and autowriteall are off, Vim will show a Yes/No/Cancel prompt asking to save the buffer. Let me know if it still doesn't do that for you. Thanks!\n. Just added a save dialog. If Yes: save the buffer and open the new file in current window, if No: open in a new split, If Cancel: do nothing.\nLet me know how that works.\nThanks!\n. Just pushed a fix, let me know how that works. I think I explicitly tested this but a few versions back. Thanks for the heads up!\n. Yup, I've made it very simple to add extensions to ctrlp. Everything you need to know is here.\nBut I guess it's unlikely that someone will do this, so I'll give it a shot once I have some more free time.\nThanks for the suggestion!\n. Added along with another extension for quickfix. You can enable it with:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_extensions = ['tag']\nStart in tag mode with :CtrlPTag.\nIf you find any problem or see anything that can be improved, let me know.\nThanks!\n. c3b316a should take care of the updatetime complaint from easytags.\nThis tag extension only looks for tags files defined with the Vim's tags option. So you'll need to include the name and location of the tags file generated by easytags in this option. Try something like this for your vimrc:\nvim\nlet &tags .= ','.vim_tmp.'/easytags'\n. Assuming that the tags option is changed each time you switch to a different filetype, then I think pressing <F5> will update the results. Can you test that and let me know if it helps at all?\n. Let know me know how a4b8d4c works?\nThanks!\n. Do :echo tagfiles() and :echo taglist('.*') return anything before and\nafter running :CtrlPTag? What's the output of :echo tagfiles()?\n. I was able to reproduce this by setting path_mode to 0. However, it should\nstill work with absolute path like\n/tmp/.graudeejs/.vim/easytags/vim but somehow doesn't in your case.\nI'll investigate further and try to find a fix soon.\nOn Tue, Nov 29, 2011 at 2:14 AM, Aldis Berjoza <\nreply@reply.github.com\n\nwrote:\nOn Mon, 28 Nov 2011 10:42:27 -0800\nkien\nreply@reply.github.com\nwrote:\n\nDo :echo tagfiles() and :echo taglist('.*') return anything\nbefore and after running :CtrlPTag?

That'll require some non-trivial changes in how ctrlp does the whole pattern matching. Sounds really cool though, so I'll definitely look into it. As for seaching tags in current buffer, it's much more complicated, and I think tagbar and taglist already do it and do it better, so I probably won't make this.\n\n@claytron: Can you let me know how it works for you now?\nThanks!\n. Can you provide steps to reproduce the \"Tag not found\" error?\nFor the caching, I'll use something other than just checking for filenames.\n. Good idea, I'll try that.\nMy guess is that easytags changes the results returned by tagfiles() when\nswitching to a new buffer, hence the tags files are not found when CtrlPTag\ntrying to run :tag. So there's an option to not create a new buffer/split\nor tab (i.e how fuzzyfinder does it).\nAnyway, thanks for your time!\nOn Tue, Nov 29, 2011 at 2:42 PM, Aldis Berjoza <\nreply@reply.github.com\n\nwrote:\nFor sake of environment differences I suggest you take my vim config\n(clone, cd ~/.vim && make)\nrm -f ~/tmp/.vim/eazytags/*\n cd ~/.vim\nvim vimrc\nWait 4-5 seconds for EasyTags to generate tags\nnow when you open CtrlPTag select tag and press Enter it will show \"Tag\nnot found\" error.\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/issues/27#issuecomment-2919943\n.

Sure, I'm listening!\n\nOn Tue, Nov 29, 2011 at 9:09 PM, Aldis Berjoza <\nreply@reply.github.com\n\nwrote:\n@kied..... CtrlPTag really needs to show tags of current file by default.\nI don't think it would be hard to implement (want me to give some ideas?)\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/issues/27#issuecomment-2930218\n. @claytron: How does it work for you now? In addition to adding persistent caching, I also remove taglist() altogether and use readfile() for everything.\n\n@graudeejs: That could potentially lead to listing the wrong tags from the wrong file, and would be much slower than using ctags, for example. As for the problem with multiple tags with the same name, tag.vim now uses the tag-matchlist commands as a workaround.\n. It only does that if there's at least one other tag with the same name (there are 2 'index' in your case).\nThis should be good enough for now, as using the filename to identify the tag isn't reliable.\n. For people who don't use easytags and have more than one tag file, the filenames can also be the same, as their locations are relative to the tags files.\nIt's like this:\n``\ndir_a\n|- file.ext- tags (path to file is 'file.ext')\ndir_b\n|- file.ext\n`- tags (path to file is also 'file.ext')\n```\nAnd the tags option:\nvim\nset tags+=./dir_a/tags,./dir_b/tags\nThe listing would look like this:\n'mytag'    file.ext\n'mytag'    file.ext\nSo unless I'm missing something, there's no easy way out but using tag-matchlist.\n. It should be much faster now. I did a few tests with a tags file that has 200000 tags and it seemed to work reasonably well. There are probably a few ugly trade-offs, but at least it loads up in this extreme case.\nI also added a tag-count finder, with it you only get the matchlist prompt when the tags are actually identical.\n. Closing this as it's gotten really long and the main issues have been resolved.\nThanks everyone for the feedbacks!\nLastly, just to clarify, you also get the matchlist prompt (see in @graudeejs' screenshot) with :FufTag when jumping to a tag that has duplications. This is the default behavior of :tjump and :stjump. :FufTag just hides the duplications so that you don't know they are there, but if you select one, it'll show that prompt.\nSo what the tag-count finder does here is it helps switching to the :tag command when possible (differences in path/filename), since the :tag command accepts a count argument. And with this, the prompt only shows up in the rare cases where the duplicate tags have the same filename.\n. The s:normcmd() is there to do exactly that, preventing the new buffer being opened in windows created by plugins. These windows are often small or very small (NERDTree, Gundo, MiniBufExpl ...) and user obviously doesn't want them to be replaced by mistake.\nBut it looks like netrw is an exception, so I think I'll add an option to force :e for some plugins.\n. Just added an option for this. You can use this to add some exceptions to s:normcmd():\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_dont_split = ['Netrw']\nLet me know how that works for you.\n. I extended the option to include filetype as well. Let me know how this works:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_dont_split = 'netrw'\n. The parent directory is the directory where an object is located, or that's how it's generally understood.\nSo for most people, /some/path/to is the parent directory and /some/path is the nearest ancestor.\n. Thank you! This has been added. The only difference is / and \\ work like .. instead of updating on-the-fly.\n. Added. Thank you!\n. / or \\ can be used to search in subdirs. Also, / or \\  may be accidentally hit and if the project root's large and not yet scanned, it'll result in a long wait.\n. If you type a continuous part of the filename like that then quickly pressing <c-r> and/or <c-d> will help bringing up more accurate results.\nI can make it work better by default but the performance impact will be too big on large projects. Vim's very slow when it comes to searching in large lists, a few thousand items and it starts getting noticeable.\n. Thanks! But I don't think this should be a default behavior. s:maxfiles is the max number of files to scan for initially, the default is 20000. It can also be set to 0 for no-limit.\nIf you want to see more results, simply changing maxheight will be best. There's really no differences between that and limiting the maxheight yet showing more results (which you have to scroll to see them).\nEdit: Actually, using s:maxfiles also causes the startup time to skyrocket if the root dir is large, so it's probably not a good idea.\n. I think that's exactly the idea, if there are more results than needed to display then the extras should be removed.\n. I think I had this same idea when writing prompt.vim (which eventually evolved into ctrlp.vim). There was also a partial implementation as the now removed ctrlp_live_update option and the <c-^> mapping. I thought it was a little bit inconvenient to have to wait or hit something for the list to update.\nBut I see your point, so I'll definitely give this another try.\nThanks!\n. Added. You can enable/disable it or set the delay time with this option:\nvim\nlet  g:ctrlp_lazy_update = 0\nThe default delay time is 250ms.\n. The tricky part with using the previous result for subsequent filtering, is that the input string can be edited in different ways that make the previous result irrelevant. For example when using<del> <bs> <c-w>... in the middle of the previous string. So after a number of searches, there'll be nothing left to search.\n. Closing this as the logic has actually already been used (although differently) and only triggered when the number of items found is less than max_height.\nBut regardless, thank you for suggesting!\n. I don't think there's a good enough reason to have a new option for this. The only difference with using a larger max_height is that with this you don't see everything printed in the ctrlp buffer and need to scroll. Also, ctrlp restores the view after closing and you can't do anything else while it's open anyway (else it closes), so there's very little point in saving screen real-estate.\n. It's kind of a limitation. The larger the project the less accurate this\ngets.\nAs to how to remedy it, you can enter regex mode with  and search for\nthe literal user.rb using user.rb as the input.\nOn Wed, Nov 30, 2011 at 12:46 AM, Ben Mills <\nreply@reply.github.com\n\nwrote:\nI've been trying to use ctrlp at work and on our main large project (a\nrails project) I try to find \"user.rb\" and it matches things like\n\"app/controllers/status_controller.rb\".\nIs this a config issue on my end or an actual bug?\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/issues/40\n.

Does it happens if you comment out the gv\"vy line?\nAlso, try loading a minimal vimrc with no other plugin and see if it still happens:\nvim\nvim --noplugin -u {path/to/a/simple/.vimrc}\nAnd have only this line in the above vimrc:\nvim\nse nocp\nruntime! plugin/ctrlp.vim\nJust make sure the parent directory of plugin/ is in your runtimepath, for example ~/.vim or $HOME/vimfiles.\n. No, you're correct. I didn't know it does that. I'll push a fix soon.\nThanks for reporting this!\n. <bs> should delete the character. Are you using console Vim on Windows?\n. It happens with console Vim on Windows for me but works fine on Linux and OSX. Also, mapping delete to a different key works, so it's probably something with the <bs> key.\n. Looks like this is because <c-h> is mapped for moving left, while <c-h> is the Vim's keystroke for <bs> (like <c-m> for <cr>). The odd thing is that this seems to behave inconsistently between different Vim builds.\nSo the workaround is to not map <c-h> to left movement but instead to backspace. You can add something like this to your vimrc:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings = {\n    \\ 'PrtBS()': ['<c-h>'],\n    \\ 'PrtCurLeft()': ['<left>'],\n    \\ }\nIf you don't want to use <left>, just choose something else.\n. Nope, it loads instantly for me. There hasn't been any report of slow startup time either.\nCan you reproduce it with minimal configuration? Try starting vim with this:\nvim --noplugin -u path/to/a/simple/.vimrc\nAnd this as the content of the above .vimrc:\nvim\nset nocp\nruntime! plugin/ctrlp.vim\nJust make sure the parent dir of plugin is in your runtimepath, for example ~/.vim or $HOME\\vimfiles.\nIf it doesn't happen in this case, then maybe you can help me tracking down whatever is interfering with ctrlp by commenting out parts of your .vimrc. It might be an autocmd or something that does stuff when a new buffer/window is opened/created.\n. Pulled.\nThank you!\n. Nope, it's hard to tell which directory is \"troublesome\" without indexing it first.\nYou'll just have to wait for it to finish while having this in your .vimrc:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_clear_cache_on_exit = 0\nThis will tell ctrlp to keep the cache when exiting Vim.\n. Not sure if I want to have yet another option. Since enabling cross-sessions caching already solves this problem. And using the global wildignore for this is probably out of the question.\n. Works fine for me on Linux and Windows, haven't tried OSX yet:\n\nWhat Vim version are you using? If it's 7.0 or 7.1 then you'll just need to upgrade Vim.\n. Does it work if you have this in your .vimrc?\nvim\nset termencoding=utf-8\nset encoding=utf-8\nIt works for me on OSX (oddly only after a system restart):\n\n. It looks like the problem is with Vim's globpath() not expanding the path correctly when the path has one of those characters. I'm not 100% sure, though.\nI think you'll have to use the g:ctrlp_user_command option to get the list of files instead. You can add this to your .vimrc:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_user_command = 'find %s -type f'\nOr this to filter files that you don't want to be listed:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_user_command = \"find %s -type f | egrep -v '\\.(swp|swo|log|gitkep|keepme|so|o)$'\"\nLet me know how that works.\n. @marttt: that's a different issue and it's a known limitation of the ctrlp prompt. But if you update ctrlp to the latest, you can set the g:ctrlp_key_loop option to allow typing of accented characters. See :help g:ctrlp_key_loop for more details.\n. You can enable tag search with this option:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_extensions = ['tag']\nThen use :CtrlPTag to open ctrlp in tag mode.\n. Filtering those will slow CtrlPTag down when the tag file's large. It was what this extension did in an earlier version.\nI'll see if I can add the filter back without slowing it down too much.\n. Let me know how the latest commit works for you.\nNo idea if there's an option for ctags, but I think it shouldn't matter. Some users might actually want to have those tags in their tag files.\n. It's because of the globpath() function. No way to work around I'm afraid.\nIf you run :echo globpath(getcwd(), '*/') for example, it always shows the directory if using the wildignore+=cache/* format.\n. I already have a gitignore file locally. I'll add this to it myself and commit later.\nThanks!\n. Same questions as for your other issue. There hasn't been any such report of this. The mappings are very straight forward, it only adds : if you (or something in your configuration) type :. Do you map anything to : globally?\nAlso, let me know your Vim version and OS.\nThanks!\n. I see. Then please provide some details for your other issue. I'm closing\nthis one now as it's related to the other.\nThanks!\nOn Sat, Dec 17, 2011 at 1:26 AM, gjunkie <\nreply@reply.github.com\n\nwrote:\nI don't map anything to it globally. I've tried to reproduce the issue and\nhave been unable to, so this may have been an offshoot. Though I can say\nthat it happened while the other issue was happening as well with slow\nperformance.\nVIM: 7.3.87\nMac OS X 10.7.2\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/issues/54#issuecomment-3180782\n. This sounds like a problem with Vim & your configuration. In any case, please provide some details: What type of file do you have in the other buffer? How do you invoke ctrlp? Does it happen consistently? Does it happen with minimal configuration?\n\nYou can try starting Vim with this:\nvim --noplugin -u path/to/a/simple/.vimrc\nUse this as the content of the above .vimrc:\nvim\nse nocp\nruntime! plugin/ctrlp.vim\nMake sure the parent dir of plugin is in your runtimepath, for example ~/.vim or $HOME\\vimfiles.\nThen try to reproduce the problem.\n. Temporarily closing this one now for lack of information, and because it's probably unfixable within the plugin.\n. Thank you! But this makes <c-t> work exactly like <cr> when jump_to_buffer = 2, is that what you want? And when jump_to_buffer = 1, <c-t> just opens a new tab as usual.\nAlso, I actually mean to have the && md == 'e' condition there to limit it to just <cr> and not any other mapping. When users use <c-x>, <c-v>, <c-t>, they might really want to open the file in a new tab or new split, regardless of the current value of jump_to_buffer.\n. Pulled. And I took the opportunity to make this feature a little more robust. Let me know if you find any problem.\n. Added. The new option is g:ctrlp_cmd.\nThanks for the suggestion!\n. Also added. Thanks for the suggestion!\nThe new option is g:ctrlp_custom_ignore. Let me know how it works for you.\n. @fourcolors I'll need some details. What mode are you trying to use the custom ignore for (I suppose Files) and what exactly are you trying to ignore? Have you cleared the cache or restarted Vim? Delete the cache directory if you aren't sure.\n. Did you press <F5> in CtrlP or run :CtrlPClearAllCaches to clear the cache? If you want to be sure, delete the .cache/ctrlp dir in your home dir.\n. Pulled to my local repo. I'll push it out with the next batch of changes.\nThank you!\n. Thank you! I'm aware of this. It's mentioned in the docs here in response to issue #45.\nI think what I'm going to do now is just add the workaround to the script and get rid of that note altogether.\n. Hi Paul,\nThere's a custom ignore option you can use: g:ctrlp_custom_ignore\nRegarding the wildignore issue, some people may have .git in their wildignore and not just for ctrlp. In that case, it still breaks fugitive and there's nothing I can do to help it.\n. Yes, certainly.\nThanks!\n. Thank you! This should be fixed now.\n. Should be fixed now. Thanks!\n. The current implementation of the MRU list is similar to that of desktop applications. Changing it to recently-entered is simple, having this in your .vimrc will do:\nvim\nau BufEnter * cal ctrlp#mrufiles#list(expand('<abuf>', 1))\nI'll keep it in mine for a bit and see if it should be the default.\n. Oh I see. But the buffer list actually isn't fixed, it's sorted according to multiple criteria (not the first opened time). I won't change this as it would overlap the MRU list's functionality.\n. Thanks, guys! I appreciate it more than you know.\n. Reopening this so more people will see it. Also, thank you again for helping to track down the bugs in this feature!\n. Nope, it only accepts t, h or v and <c-o> only reuses a window if it's empty and is the only one in a tab.\nI'll see if I can rewrite the open function to allow a new option value.\n. <c-o> should be a bit smarter now. No new tab will be created unless t is used. For h and v, if the active buffer belongs to a plugin or is a help or quickfix window, <c-o> will try to find a normal buffer and split it, unless there's an empty window then it'll be used instead.\nThe new values for ctrlp_open_multi are tr, hr, vr. They work just like t, h, v with the exception of the first selected file replacing the active buffer in the current window. The logic above also applies.\n. OK, you can now do that by using tr, hr or vr without giving a number. t, h and v without a number work, too, but the first file will be opened in a new split or new tab (then the rest hidden).\nSo this will do what you want:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_open_multi = 'vr'\n. OK, this looks serious. But I doubt using pathogen would cause any problem. Almost everyone uses some sort of plugin/runtimepath manager nowaday, and this is the first report of these errors.\nDo you mind posting the output of :version?\n. Ok, could you try starting Vim with this?\nmvim --noplugin -u ~/simple_vimrc\nAnd this for the simple_vimrc, make sure plugin/ctrlp.vim is in your runtimepath:\nvim\nset nocp\nruntime! plugin/ctrlp.vim\nThen activate ctrlp with :CtrlP, :CtrlPBuffer and :CtrlPMRU.\n- If all of them works, try disabling parts of your Vim configuration (plugins, .vimrcs) to isolate the problem.\n- If it only happens with the :CtrlP command, then put this into the simple_vimrc and try again:\nvim\n  let g:ctrlp_user_command = 'find %s -type f'\n- But if none of the above helps, then I guess I'll just have to live with this. Can't fix if I can't reproduce it. It also seems to be a long standing problem with MacVim that happens seemingly out of nowhere:\n  http://vim.1045645.n5.nabble.com/MacVim-app-snapshot-22-td1215494i20.html\nAlso, sorry for the late reply! I wanted to wait a bit and see if there was anyone else with the same problem that could provide a solution or informations.\n. Yep, the counter isn't real time so when hitting a large directory, it stops at the last number. It looks like it hangs, but if you can use <c-c> to stop it, then it's probably still scanning.\nAs for speeding up this initial build, you can try disabling dotfiles scanning g:ctrlp_dotfiles = 0, enable cross-session caching g:ctrlp_clear_cache_on_exit = 0, and add some ignore rules to ignore the generated files.\nNote that using wildignore is faster than using the custom_ignore option, since this option can only be applied after the scan is finished.\nI'm going to close this now. If you encounter the crash again, try using OSX's find to get the list of files through the user_command option. And please feel free to reopen/comment on this.\n. I don't know what's going on in the background but from this old conversation, it might have something to do with MacVim itself and OSX: http://vim.1045645.n5.nabble.com/MacVim-app-snapshot-22-td1215494i20.html\nBut you can always try disabling your plugins to see if the error is plugin related.\n. This is because the ctags plugin changes Vim's  laststatus option upon BufEnter and BufLeave, while you have set laststatus=0 somewhere in your .vimrc. Changing the value of laststatus to 2 will fix this.\nI won't try to make a workaround for this in ctrlp as it'll lead to a slippery slope of never-ending workarounds.\n. Sorry, my mistake, set laststatus=1 also makes the problem appear. And =1 is Vim's default. I tested earlier with 2 splits so =1 was the same as =2 (both worked fine).\nAlso, the source of this incompatibility is from using winrestcmd() to restore the window layout.\n. 34aa84e should solve this problem by using :noautocmd to open the ctrlp buffer. I hesitated to use it until now because using this command will make it not possible for users to interact with the ctrlp buffer via autocmds. For example, after this commit, the vim-powerline plugin won't be able to apply a custom statusline to ctrlp via BufEnter.\nAlso, speaking of statusline, this should also fix the incompatibility between ctags.vim and ctrlp (issue #73).\n. There's a hard limit for matching only tag names. But this was unintentional. It should be fixed now.\nThanks for reporting!\n. @claytron: I just removed the hard limit for partial matching. It should work for you now as well.\n. Nope, not yet. But it sounds like it could be a nice improvement to <c-y>, so I'll definitely look into it.\nThanks!\n. With the recent changes, there are now 2 ways of doing this. Number 2's more in line with what you want, but 1's faster with deep directories:\n1) Using <c-z> to mark a file and use its path as the base dir:\n<c-p><c-d>filetxt<c-z><c-u>New Article/article.txt<c-y>\n|    |    |      |    |    |\n|    |    |      |    |    `- start creating the new dir and file\n|    |    |      |    `- clear the prompt\n|    |    |      `- mark it to get its parent dirs: content/articles\n|    |    `- find a file in content/articles/\n|    `- switch to matching only filename\n`- start ctrlp\n2) Using <tab> to auto-complete each directory:\n<c-p>co<tab>ar<tab>New Article/article.txt<c-y>\n|    | |    | |    |\n|    | |    | |    `- start creating the new dir and file\n|    | |    | `- auto-complete it to articles/ if possible\n|    | |    `- type the first chars of articles/\n|    | `- auto-complete it to content/ if possible\n|    `- type the first chars of content/\n`- start ctrlp\nThat is it, for now. If you find any problem or have any quesion, let me know.\nThanks!\n. Fixed. Broken in e42bb4c.\n. Yes, this is a feature and there's an option to override it.\nSo for nerdtree you can use this:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_dont_split = 'nerdtree'\n. It works fine for me on Windows and Linux. Not sure if anything could interfere with this.\nDoes anything in .git show? How about without the dollar signs? Or just using a forward slash at the end like this: '\\.yardoc/'?\n. You could try starting Vim with only ctrlp and nothing else. So start Vim with something like this:\nvim\nvim --noplugin -u path/to/a/simple/.vimrc\nAnd inside that .vimrc:\nvim\nset nocp\nruntime! plugin/ctrlp.vim\nlet g:ctrlp_custom_ignore = {\n  \\ 'dir':  '\\.git$\\|\\.hg$\\|\\.svn$\\|\\.yardoc$',\n  \\ 'file': '\\.exe$\\|\\.so$\\|\\.dat$'\n  \\ }\nJust make sure plugin/ is in your runtimepath, for example in ~/.vim.\nIf it works in this case, then you could try commenting out parts of your .vimrc, disabling plugins etc...\nAlso, this ctrlp_custom_ignore option doesn't work with the ctrlp_user_command option.\n. Does wildignore work for you then? The option would look like this:\nvim\nset wildignore+=*/.git/*,*/.hg/*,*/.svn/*,*/.yardoc/*,*.exe,*.so,*.dat\nAlso, could you try these out, just in case the returned directories end with a /?\n``` vim\nlet g:ctrlp_custom_ignore = {\n  \\ 'dir':  '.yardoc/',\n  \\ }\n\" Or this:\nlet g:ctrlp_custom_ignore = {\n  \\ 'dir':  '.yardoc',\n  \\ }\n```\nAnd before starting up ctrlp, run :echo g:ctrlp_custom_ignore to see if it's there.\n. Press <F5> in ctrlp to clear the cache. If you switch branches a lot and don't mind the scanning, just disable caching with let g:ctrlp_use_caching = 0.\n. @wmayner this wasn't actually an issue. The custom_ignore option has been pretty much bug-free since introduced. So I suggest double checking everything. Making sure the cache files are deleted, you're not using the default user_command, and node_modules isn't symlinked.\nThe 'dir', 'file', etc. are very specific. So if all else false or you don't want to dig further, just use the string format which applies to everything, instead of the dictionary format.\n. ctrlp has 2 different statuslines. The main one is the one you see most of the time, created with ctrlp#statusline(). The other one you only see briefly when scanning for files, created with ctrlp#progress(len).\nI can make them check for an option to use first.\nEdit: Removed the printf() example because it can't be used for the statusline.\n. Added a new option on the custom_statusline branch. See eae302f8.\nHere's a working example that recreates the default statuslines: https://gist.github.com/1610859\nLet me know if that's good enough.\n. Added. You can enable it with:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_mruf_relative = 1\nThanks for the suggestion!\n. Hmm, I'm pretty sure it still works. Can you describe exactly what doesn't work as you expect? Or do you still see some files outside the current working directory?\nAlso, the code is here, it's just a simple filter to remove files outside the cwd:\nhttps://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/blob/master/autoload/ctrlp/mrufiles.vim#L41-44\n. > And btw, g:ctrlp_mruf_relative could be removed from help file as it's not used anywhere in the code now.\nNo, it's in the code AND it's working fine. Did you check the link in my previous comment? {s:re} is g:ctrlp_mruf_relative.\nAlso, it would help if you provide a test case where it doesn't work, just open a new issue. Include in it the current working directory, the files you expect to not be included, and the exact steps to reproduce the problem.\nEdit: Oh ok, I see that you're using CtrlPMixed. The reason it doesn't apply to Mixed mode because it would nullify having MRU files in the mix in the first place. MRU files in the cwd are already covered by \"Files\".\n. You can use let g:ctrlp_match_window_bottom = 0. You might also want let g:ctrlp_match_window_reversed = 0 to show the results from top to bottom.\n. Nope, that's Vim's command line. We can't move it.\n. Yes, it's a feature. You can disable it with:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_jump_to_buffer = 0\n. 1 is the default. So if you want the opposite, set it to 0.\n. ctrlp uses the default CursorLine highlight group from your colorscheme. So if you want a different color, either edit your colorscheme or have a different CursorLine line in your .vimrc.\n. Could you help me test this patch, see if it works for you?\nhttps://gist.github.com/1624947\nSaving and restoring &l:tags was a fix for a compatibility issue with the easytags.vim plugin, which aggressively set &l:tags when a new buffer is created or opened. I can't reproduce this problem with the latest easytags.vim, however.\n. Great, thank you!\n. Yes, the order's straight out of Vim buffer list, so it's buffer-number. This is also the second time someone asks for this so maybe I'll look into adding it next. In the mean time, you can use the MRU list :CtrlPMRU while having this autocmd in your vimrc. It should provide what you need:\nvim\nautocmd BufEnter,BufUnload * call ctrlp#mrufiles#list(expand('<abuf>', 1))\nAlso, outside of ctrlp, you can use the Vim's <c-^> mapping to switch between the current buffer and the previous buffer.\n. OK, I decided to not add this, since the MRU file list already contains all the buffers. Instead, I've added an option to sort the MRU file list in most-recently-entered order:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_mruf_last_entered = 1\nIt'll do what you want originally but with :CtrlPMRU.\n. Should be fixed now. Thanks!\n. Yes, use let g:ctrlp_by_filename = 1.\n. We can't map <cr> and <c-m> differently, since <c-m> has the same keycode as <cr> (13) in Vim. The same goes for <esc> and <c-[>, among others. You'll have to choose other key for \"e\" if you want to use <cr> for \"t\".\n. Should be fixed now. Thanks!\n. Not sure if this should be bundled into ctrlp as I think most people don't need it. And you can probably do it with an autocmd:\nvim\nau BufReadPost * norm! zvzz\n. Right, I just assumed you only wanted to do that with new files. BufWinEnter will probably be better for opened files.\nEdit: Also, thanks for pointing out that BufReadPost doesn't work for those cmds. Closing this one now.\n. Probably won't be adding this. Too much for one plugin. There also isn't any useful <c-...> mapping left to use.\n. @d11wtq: For (1), there's the g:ctrlp_buffer_func option. See :help g:ctrlp_buffer_func. Just define some buffer local mappings with nnoremap <buffer> <silent> ... in the function.\nFor (2), there isn't a built-in function, but you can use something like fnamemodify(getline('.')[2:], ':p'). And this can only get the filename in filename related modes (files, buffers, mru etc...).\n. You can set the maximum number of files to scan with the g:ctrlp_max_files option. The default's 20000.\nTo stop a scan midway, press <c-c> (it should stop everything vimscript) then press <esc> to exit as usual.\n. That'd be too low. Personally, I haven't had any problem with 20000, no one else complains about it either. But I think cmd-t has this at 10000, so I might lower ctrlp's to that if there are more requests.\n. The counter isn't real time. So when reaching a large directory it stops until globpath() finishes the scan in that directory.\n. <c-c> pauses everything including the counter, so it might look like it's frozen, but you can still press <esc> or <c-c> again to close the prompt.\nHowever if it actually freezes Vim then there's really nothing I can do to address that. It'll be an issue between Vimscript and Vim, i.e. running globpath() in a large directory tree sometimes freezes Vim.\nAs for an alternative to using globpath(), check out :help g:ctrlp_user_command.\n. Let me know if this patch works for you:\n``` diff\n+++ b/autoload/ctrlp.vim\n@@ -155,7 +155,7 @@ fu! s:Open()\n endf\nfu! s:Close()\n-   try | noa bun! | cat | noa clo! | endt\n+   try | bun! | cat | clo! | endt\n    cal s:unmarksigns()\n    for key in keys(s:glbs)\n        sil! exe 'let &'.key.' = s:glb_'.key\n```\n. Could you provide steps to reproduce this then? Filetype of the file. It's already opened or new.

I don't get any highlighting at all when I just do :e project.clj without using ctrlp.\nEdit: I probably don't have the syntax file for clj which isn't shipped with Vim. Which one do you use?\n. Ok, I tried with this script: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2501\nThe syntax works with both :e and ctrlp in vim and mvim on OSX for me. I didn't try the latest mvim, though, since I'm still on Snow Leopard.\n. Alright, finally installed janus and was able to reproduce this. Apparently, the problem comes from some mapping conflicts between janus (or a plugin inside janus) and VimClojure. In my test case they are the \\rt and \\et mappings. When I disable all the mappings of VimClojure, the syntax loads without any issue.\nAnd so the fix, at least in my case, is have this in .vimrc.before for janus:\nvim\nlet maplocalleader = ','\nLet me know how that works for you.\n. The files can be from any directory, not just the cwd. So removing the leading part for only a few then adding them again will be problematic.\nAlso, you can switch to matching only filename by pressing <c-d>, this should help if the paths are too long.\n.

However, this patch doesn't account for commands after : (fail to open the buf), so I'll need to work it into the code and will commit later along with the others.\nThanks for the help!\n. This has been added. The new command is :CtrlPMixed.\nAs for mixing random extensions, it isn't feasible since there are too many differences.\n. Nope, because the opening commands, highlighting, matching etc are all different.\n. Probably won't add this. I tried having the +'s at the start of each line but I think they make the list feel a bit confusing and busy.

You can try setting the g:ctrlp_cmd option to the cmd that you use, i.e. CtrlPCurWD\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_cmd = 'CtrlPCurWD'\n. The mapping to :CtrlP exists because it's a restored session. But the lazy-load method you use doesn't load ctrlp along with it. So the best option's for you to use something different, because many plugins have default mappings as well, and this method wouldn't work well with them. But regardless, I'll make disabling the ctrlp's default mapping an option, maybe by leaving g:ctrlp_map empty.\n. It's not a completion menu. The prompt's created in  Vim's command-line and works as such. <c-p> and <c-n> are used for browsing the command history in the command line. They do the same job in ctrlp's prompt, browsing the input history.\nYou can remap the keys if you don't like the default. For example, this is probably close to what you want:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings = {\n    \\ 'PrtSelectMove(\"j\")':   ['<c-j>', '<c-n>'],\n    \\ 'PrtSelectMove(\"k\")':   ['<c-k>', '<c-p>'],\n    \\ 'PrtHistory(-1)':       ['<down>'],\n    \\ 'PrtHistory(1)':        ['<up>'],\n    \\ }\n. This doesn't work well on Windows because mkdir() can't create subdirs. But making it work on Windows breaks it for everyone else. Removed to re-implement it later.\n. Hmm, apparently I missed this part, it can create subdirs:\nmkdir({name} [, {path} [, {prot}]])\n        If {path} is \"p\" then intermediate directories are created as\n        necessary.  Otherwise it must be \"\".\n. There's no built-in way to do this. Not sure if I want to add it either. But you can write a function like this to do it:\n``` vim\nfu! s:call_ctrlp_extension(ext)\n    if !exists('g:ctrlp_builtins')\n        ru autoload/ctrlp.vim\n    en\n    cal ctrlp#init(ctrlp#{a:ext}#id())\nendf\n\" Then create some mappings:\nnn  l :cal call_ctrlp_extension('line')\nnn  s :cal call_ctrlp_extension('rtscript')\n``\n. Reproducible but the problem seems to be originated from either netrw or Vim. Here's the test case:\n- Runvim ~/test/sym3/*where sym3 is linked to another directory.\n- Vim starts with the netrw buffer. Immediately run:lsfrom Vim's command-line.\n  In the list,~/test/sym3is listed as a buffer number 2.\n- Run:CtrlPBuffer.test/sym3` is also listed as a buffer, since the buffer list's taken from Vim.\nRepeat step 1 and 2 then do this:\n- Run :b2. Vim returns \"~/test/sym3\" is a directory.\n  Run :ls again, the sym3 buffer is gone.\n  Run :CtrlPBuffer, test/sym3 also gone.\nEdit: ~/test/sym3 is still listed in the output of :ls when ctrlp isn't installed.\nScreenshot:\n\n. Vim 7.3.0 on Ubuntu 10.10, netrw Last change: 2010 Jul 28.\n. > Used :CtrlPBuffer to go to some buffer.\nDoes it happen if you use :buffer [buffer-number]? Try :edit [filename] as well, where filename's the filename of the buffer. Also, try starting Vim with vim --noplugin -u .empty_vimrc ~/.vim/snippets/* where the vimrc only has set nocp, then browse through the buffers with :bn or :bp.\n. Let me know if e7b08a3 changes anything.\n. Let me know how 6fe1e50 works. Thanks!\n. Should be fixed now. Sorry about the hiccup!\n. Hmm, so are you suggesting that the default fuzzy mode should work like regexp mode at first? I think I already tried to implement that once, but couldn't use it because of a problem with filtering the results (it was very slow), hence the current implementation separating fuzzy and literal strings.\n. Oh I see. But that'll have the same performance problem, I think. For example, the pattern with the smallest substrings and lowest priority, c.*o.*v.*e.*r.*\\..*e.*r.*l will match entries already matched by co.*ver.*\\.erl. So in one way or another, these entries will have to be filtered. And filtering in vimscript is really slow, any operation with large lists, large dictionaries is. The only way I see that can really improve this part is by doing it with a better language then send the results back to be displayed.\nBut to stay pure vimscript and portable, this is kind of it. Separate fuzzy and literal string modes where people can use co.*ver.*\\.erl or cover\\.erl when they need to.\n. OK, matching the whole string first is on the 1.7.0 branch. This is a near complete rewrite of the old algorithm. It gives better results by default but is noticeably slower when searching in large directories. I'm still undecided as to merge it or not. Let me know what you guys think.\n. @DelvarWorld: Yep, I think I'll just keep it as a separate branch, as I'd rather have the speed myself. And if not being fully fuzzy stops people from using the plugin, that's fine by me. I understand that you mean to encourage making the plugin better, but I'm pretty much done with this.\n. vim\nlet g:ctrlp_use_caching = 0\nlet g:ctrlp_clear_cache_on_exit = 1\n. This is expected and it's a limitation, I'm afraid. If the search string's long, it'll take more time to find the matches. As the string gets longer, the delay starts getting more noticeable. It also seems to be highly dependent on people's computers.\nSo you'll want to keep the string short and unique. If you want to match only filenames, you can press <c-d> to toggle filename-only mode, instead of typing out the letters and the /'s in the path. Another option's to use the lazy update option which tells ctrlp to only update the match window when typing has stopped:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_lazy_update = 1\n. I get an E420: BG color unknown error in gVim on Windows. I think a better solution would be using separate rules for GUI and non-GUI:\nvim\nexe 'hi CtrlPLineMarker '.( has('gui_running') ? 'gui' : 'cterm' ).'fg=bg'\nAlso, not sure if I want the prefix optional. Implementing's simple but unicode symbols don't seem to work very well on Windows, and it might cause problems on others where people can't open files.\n. Hmm, it'd still generate issues here from people who had problems using it, and I'd have to deal with those issues. Besides, after this change, there will be only one > for the selected entry. So it's probably not worth it for an extra option.\n. Looks like the colorscheme you're using doesn't set the Normal highlight group or does but ctermbg isn't defined.\n6a9f1e3 should workaround this.\n. Thanks! You can use the option shellslash to have / as path separator on Windows:\nvim\nset shellslash\nHowever, changing the code to silently treat \\ as / is a no-go at this point. There are too many things to consider.\n. I don't have access to Win7 at the moment but 1.6.9 works perfectly fine for me on WinXP. I'll try to setup a Win7 machine and test this once I have some free time.\nFor now, I think you should just use 1.6.3. There's very little difference between it and 1.6.9, except for new extensions and some new features. Most of the bugfixes are for the new stuff, too.\n. Could you guys help me test this patch? Kind of a shot in the dark, but these are the few changes in 1.6.9 vs 1.6.3 that can affect performance when typing.\nIt's against master.

I went ahead and committed this. If you find any problem later, let me know.\n@beaugunderson: I think that actually isn't this bug. ctrlp's just slow when there are a lot of files. You can find some related explanations/solutions here.\n. Thanks! But there's already an option you can use to set it:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_root_markers = ['.lvimrc']\nWith this, ctrlp will look for .lvimrc first and zoom to the first parent directory that has it.\n. They are all used. If the first one isn't found anywhere, ctrlp will then look for the next one. This option simply puts .lvimrc at the top of the queue.\n. Nope, it's not possible to set multiple user commands. Also, with what you're using, the second line just redefines the g:ctrlp_user_command variable and overwrites the value set by the first line. That wouldn't work in any case.\n. You'll have to change the AcceptSelection(\"e\") as well since <cr> is already used for it.\nSo this will do what you want:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings = {\n  \\ 'AcceptSelection(\"e\")': [],\n  \\ 'AcceptSelection(\"t\")': ['<cr>', '<c-m>'],\n  \\ }\n. @jonasdiemer: The functionality is still there, the above config only disables the <cr> key. So just use something for AcceptSelection(\"e\") and use that key to submit the ...\n. The results are already weighted based on the length of the match, the length of the path and filename, the last modified time, the parent directory... But because of the constraint of vimscript, all of these can't be done for the entire directory tree but only for the first few matches found. Hence it's inaccurate in large directories but accurate in a smaller test case. And theoretically speaking, it could be much more accurate in the large directories, too. But the performance would be so low that it'd render the plugin unusable. There are some further explanations in issue #110. I'm closing this now as duplicate, or just cantfix since it's not really a bug.\n. Make sure to set that option before plugin/ctrlp.vim is sourced. Either put it in your vimrc, or execute it before sourcing the plugin if you're doing this manually.\nIf you've already done all that and it still happens then please provide steps to reproduce the bug.\n. Hmm, I think you should open an issue on the janus repo then. Maybe someone over there will be able to help. This option works fine for everyone else, and here it sounds like it doesn't get set before the plugin is loaded.\nWish I could be more helpful but I have no clue where to even start to look into this in janus.\n. OK, I just installed janus and put let g:ctrlp_extensions = ['tag'] in .vimrc.before. The command CtrlPTag is available right from the start. So it looks like something else in your janus config is the culprit. You can try disabling plugins, commenting out parts of the .vimrcs etc... to isolate it.\n. If I understand it correctly, you want ctrlp to not pick up the langmap option? This means reseting the user's langmap option when entering the ctrlp buffer.

It should be possible to override the default highlighting after 75e31e9. I also added some descriptions at :h ctrlp-customization.\n. Yes, it's expected. And it's slow because it has to do the matching/comparing for a lot of files with 999 being the upper limit. If you want the window to fit the screen, use something like this instead:\nvim\nau VimEnter,VimResized * let g:ctrlp_max_height = &lines\n. You can use <c-^> (outside of ctrlp) to switch to the previous file. Or set this option and use :CtrlPMRU in place of :CtrlPBuffer:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_mruf_last_entered = 1\n. Make sure you clear the cache after setting the option. Run :ClearAllCtrlPCaches from the command-line or press <F5> in ctrlp.\n. I already made some changes that should (unintentionally) fix this, I think. Let me know if this doesn't return either -1 or an empty string:\n:echo synIDattr(synIDtrans(hlID('Normal')), 'bg')\n. Because not every colorscheme uses guifg=bg or ctermfg=bg for Ignore (molokai for example, uses a visible color for this group's foreground). So it's better using the Normal's bg directly.\n. This should be fixed in 75e31e9.\nIt's also now possible to change the default highlighting for every part of the prompt.\n. This has been brought up before. The consensus was that the matching couldn't be improved without decreasing performance.\nAs for a solution, you can type gemfile$ and switch to regexp mode by pressing <c-r>. This will bring up every file that ends with gemfile.\n. It only accepts the letters on the standard US-International keyboard layout, i.e. letters in the Latin alphabet, from a to z. I have no plan to support more.\n. I see, but my point's that it only accepts the standard letters. What can be typed with the keyboard (damn near everything) is irrelevant. If you have to type (pressed-then-released style) 2 or more keys to get 1 accented letter, it won't work even if the letter's supported. Also, the currently supported range's ASCII 32 to 126. This includes a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and the standard symbols and punctuations.\nI'll gladly accept something like this for accented letters, though.\n. I haven't tried them either but it seems all of these have been written by others. Although the yankring one doesn't seem to depend on YankRing.vim, but less dependencies is a plus, IMO.\nSo maybe it's time to close this, and let people who want to request new extensions to just open new issues.\n. Added. You can use <F5> to reformat the old MRU list.\n. Fixed in 93cb20d. Didn't pull your commit because tail is also used for commands, not just for line numbers.\nThanks!\n. Looks like you're using an older version of the plugin, namely v1.6.9. This has already been fixed in the latest version on github. You can get the latest zipball or tarball here.\nBut for v1.6.9, you just need to set a colorscheme that defines a background color and the error will go away.\n. The current version is 1.7.1 with this particular issue fixed in 75e31e9. And yes, vividchalk has ctermbg=none.\n. 1.6.9 was the only version that had this error. Make sure you update to the latest version on github (currently 1.7.3).\n. Mentioned in the docs.\n. Probably won't be adding this myself since I'm not familiar with cscope. Pull requests are most welcome, though. You can checkout the extensions branch for how to create an extension.\n. BTW, an extension for ctags had already been added long before this request. I still don't see me adding one for cscope, but if anyone wants to give it a shot, take a look at the ctags one, I imagine it'd be somewhat similar.\n. You just need to be more specific with the search string. It also helps to use filename mode (toggle with <c-d>), regex mode (toggle with <c-r>), or both at the same time. And make sure the cache for the current directory is up-to-date (press <F5> in ctrlp to update).\n. I'd just type something like contacts then toggle filename mode with <c-d>. If that wasn't enough, I'd then toggle regex mode with <c-r>, since contacts is a literal part of the filename.\n. This belongs in a user's .vimrc, I think. The default <c-p> mapping and the command used for it are already configurable. Adding this on top of that, and allowing the whole thing to be configurable as well will be a little over complicated, especially for something you can do with a mapping:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_map = ''\nnn <silent> <c-p> :sil! exe 'CtrlP'.['', 'CurWD', 'Dir'][v:count]<cr>\n. You want to match the last part of a path. Try [\\/]\\.[^\\/]\\+$.\nAlternatively, you can disable dotfiles searching with this:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_dotfiles = 0\n. This is most likely because Gemfile.lock is newer (in last modified time) than Gemfile, assuming they are in the same directory, with \"gemfile\" as the search string. Please see #132.\n. This isn't possible to implement with the current matching method. To get more accurate results you'll just have to switch to filename mode or regexp mode when searching. You can toggle filename mode with <c-d> and regexp mode with <c-r>. So for example, type foo.rb then press <c-d>, or type user.rb then press <c-r>.\nAlso, this may be useful for you.\n. Yes, people have been using those types of mapping long before ctrlp came into the picture. As for toggling modes with <c-d> <c-r>, it's not intuitive and needs some get-used-to, but nothing can be done about this, unfortunately. It's not that I haven't tried to improve it.\n. That's because ctrlp sets its local working directory each time it's invoked. You'll need to disable this with the g:ctrlp_working_path_mode option:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_working_path_mode = 0\n. Make sure you set that in vimrc and use <c-x> in :CtrlPDir.\nAlso, if you only want to change the working directory to ~/another_workspace then just use :cd ~/another_workspace. I don't see a point in opening it with CtrlPDir just to <c-x> and exit right away.\nAnd if you want to search in ~/another_workspace, then just use :CtrlP ~/another_workspace.\n. Thank you! I'm keeping the old commands for now and will remove them after a while, so that it doesn't break people's setups.\n. Yes, this behavior is expected. The custom_ignore and wildignore options only take effect when globpath() is used. And since you haven't defined a secondary command with g:ctrlp_user_command, globpath() is used when searching outside a repo.\n\nThe files matching the custom_ignore regex are actually ignored if I'm not in a git project. Otherwise they are shown. \nIs there any chance that the plugin doesn't use the custom_ignore while using a user_custom_command?\n\nDo you mean \"does\"? It already doesn't use the custom_ignore while a user_command is in use.\nBut if you want to ignore stuff while using a user_command, you'll need to include the ignore patterns in the command somehow. For some examples, checkout the s:wig2cmd() function at :help ctrlp-misc.\n. Exactly because of this:\n\nI really like the idea of using a custom command for git repos it is really useful because it makes the search very fast with big projects.\n\nI don't want to slow that down too much and lose that speed. So for git for example, I think it's faster to use the --exclude-from option of the git ls-files command. Here's what works for me:\nssh\ngit ls-files --exclude-from=ignoredfile -i\nWhere the ignoredfile contains this:\n*\n!*.log\n!*.png\n!*.jpg\n. > when I want to switch back and forth between them.\nWouldn't it be more appropriate to use buffer or MRU mode for that? In buffer mode and in MRU mode, the current file is excluded from the listing. If it's also excluded in find file mode, there won't be any way to select it again. But aside from that, it does kind of get in the way sometimes. So I'll see if I should factor the whole thing into an option for the 3 main modes.\n. Changed in 0b3173e because of this:\n\nIf a newer file does match 'coffee', regardless of it being the file you want or not, or of it being the worst match in the list, relying on MRU order alone will always make it the top choice simply because it's the newest.\n\nKind of forgot about this when I made that change. Sorry!\n. That's expected and simply can't be fixed. When the list gets really large, it all comes down to Vimscript's performance.\n. The list isn't unsorted. It's sorted according to the full path's length, the filename's length, the match's length, the last modified time, and the parent directory. So I don't think sorting alphabetically is going to improve it much. But in any case, if anyone wants to pick them apart and improve them, all the functions can be found in the Sorting section in autoload/ctrlp.vim.\nThanks!\n. > When try to access file xxx/color_variation, I thought cv is a good key to search it.\nSomeone else might use cv to search for user.csv, thinking it'd be a good search term. And if the first letter of a word had higher priority, the user.csv file might still win over the color_variation file because its path, filename, and match's length were shorter. Plus, to be honest, I haven't got any idea how to translate this to Vimscript. Doesn't look like it's worth the extra effort either.\nYou just need to be more specific with the search term, for example cova would probably do the job here.\n. You can just remap the keys.\nThis is the default:\nvim\n    \\ 'AcceptSelection(\"e\")': ['<cr>', '<2-LeftMouse>'],\n    \\ 'AcceptSelection(\"h\")': ['<c-x>', '<c-cr>', '<c-s>'],\n    \\ 'AcceptSelection(\"t\")': ['<c-t>'],\n    \\ 'AcceptSelection(\"v\")': ['<c-v>', '<RightMouse>'],\nJust switch <c-t> and <cr> and you're done:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings = {\n    \\ 'AcceptSelection(\"e\")': ['<c-t>'],\n    \\ 'AcceptSelection(\"t\")': ['<cr>', '<2-LeftMouse>'],\n    \\ }\n. Here's something I modified from dir.vim:\nhttps://gist.github.com/2170481\nIt requires af2847a which adds a new function. Place the file in an autoload/ctrlp/ dir in your runtimepath (not necessary inside the plugin's bundle, anywhere will work). Use the g:ctrlp_vcsdir option to change the VCS marker, the default is .git/.\nThis likely won't be bundled with ctrlp so feel free to modify it however you like.\n. Thank you! I updated the gist. It actually wasn't working at all because the cwd was never changed.\n. The plugin doesn't set this option, the user does. So check your configuration. Looks like you set g:ctrlp_custom_ignore twice in different types.\n. It's either the max_files limit (10000), or the max_depth limit (40) has been reached. You can change these limits with the g:ctrlp_max_files and g:ctrlp_max_depth options, respectively.\nIt's most likely max_files, since the views folder is only a few folders deep from the working directory. Assuming you haven't changed the default settings.\n. It works fine for me. Where do you put the let g:ctrlp_working_path_mode = 0? Make sure you put it in your .vimrc (~/.vimrc.before if you're using janus), and then either restart Vim or run :CtrlPReload.\nAlso, before starting ctrlp, run :echo g:ctrlp_working_path_mode to see if the setting has actually been set.\n. Nope, it's because you're using this to call ctrlp:\nvim\nmap <leader>f :CtrlP %:p:h<cr>\nThe path_mode option doesn't take effect when you call ctrlp like this. And %:p:h expands to the parent directory of the current file.\n. Hmm, the 1.7.0 branch is an experimental branch, it's buggy and slower than master. You shouldn't use it. It also doesn't have any change related to the invocation mapping (no changes in plugin/ctrlp.vim). And this option has been pretty much the same since 1.0. So just make sure you put the let g:ctrlp_map = '<c-;>' in your .vimrc and restart Vim.\nAlso, <c-p> is only used for completion in Insert mode. In Normal mode, <c-p> is just a duplicate of k.\n. If <F9> works fine then the plugin's mapping mechanism is working fine in your setup. There's a <c-p> mapping or not doesn't matter because it isn't used.\nSo the question is with the <c-;> key. I simply can't map it at all. For example, pressing <c-;> does nothing with this mapping:\nvim\nnnoremap <c-;> :echo 12345<cr>\nVim started with --noplugin -u blank.txt where blank.txt only has set nocp .\n:nmap shows n <C-;> * :echo 12345<CR>.\nI guess you'll just have to choose a different key to map. No idea how the 1.7.0 branch could possibly make the key work for you, though (it doesn't for me). In any case, I don't think this is a bug to be fixed.\n. You can use g:ctrlp_root_markers to set it:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_root_markers = ['.git']\n.git will be put in front of the queue and searched for before the defaults.\n. Seems to work fine for me. Please provide steps to reproduce and your configuration for both plugins.\nThanks!\n. Closing this now for lack of information. Plus ctrlp and minibufexpl work perfectly fine together in my normal environment and also when running Vim in default with just the 2 plugins. And since no one else has complained about this, I think it's probably something else on your end.\n. This has already been worked around with this commit cbbf039 in response to another issue. Next time, please update the plugin before filling bug reports.\n. A cache system already exists. Please read :help g:ctrlp_use_caching and the nearby options.\n. It's not possible, yet. But I'm going to add it, perhaps with a new key { 'sort': 0 }. For now, if you need to do some testing, try commenting out the cal sort(lines, 's:mixedsort') line in the Render() function.\n. 1. You can specify 1 directory: :CtrlP /var/www/some-site/some/path/inside. Can't do multiple directories and it's a little too late to implement that.\n2. You should do this with your vimrc. Just add some mappings for the commands.\n3. This can already be done with:\n   1. Run :CtrlP ~/dir-with-session-files/\n   2. Select a session file.\n   3. Type :so\\ % in the ctrlp prompt.\n   4. Press <cr>.\nBut the feature is too specific, I'm not going to write an extension for it or add it to ctrlp.\n. You can do completion like this ap<tab>as<tab>sty<tab>. Or if app/assets/stylesheets/ is the selected match, you can press <c-z> then type my_new_file.css and <c-y>. The second method is described in more details at :help ctrlp-input-formats|/f).\nHowever, expanding from ap/as/sty to app/assets/stylesheets/ with a single keypress is very problematic. I won't add it.\n. You can disable zooming to a project's root by setting g:ctrlp_working_path_mode to 0. This can't be changed if you're already inside the prompt.\n\nHow can I order CtrlP to search files only in current directory on demand?\n\nTry mapping something to :CtrlP . or :CtrlPCurWD and use that when you need to search in the current directory.\nAs for the / or \\, you have to submit them, not just type them out. They are also only of use when the path_mode option is 1 (in any other case they do nothing when submitted).\n. I have no idea. But it maybe that the cache just wasn't cleared and you were seeing an older index. You can use <F5> inside the prompt to refresh it.\n. This sounds great but it's very difficult to make it reliable enough to be worthwhile. I definitely won't add it. Besides, you can already list untracked files with git ls-files:\ngit ls-files . --cached --exclude-standard --others\nThis should work the same everywhere provided that you have Git installed, including on Windows.\n. ctrlp only looks for first matches. If report.cs isn't in the result list it won't get sorted. But the files in the result list do get sorted according to filename's length.\nThis is by design and can't be fixed.\nFor a solution, you can type report.cs<c-r> which should bring up every file ends with report.cs.\n. I suppose you have a lot of report.cs in paths as well (when in regex mode, report.cs is searched for literally, except the .). So try <c-d>, it should limit to matching only filenames.\n. Yes, I get that. ctrlp already does compare filename's length AND the length of the matched part, but this simply can't be done on the whole list.\nThe regex mode and filename mode are usually enough to workaround that. But in your case, you'll have be more specific with the search string. Since you have too many report.cs's, don't use just it. Try something like ^report.cs or ^report.cs$ in regex + filename mode.\n. Nope, it isn't supposed to work. The prompt is a pseudo-prompt and only the mappings that have been defined work.\nThere are a few built-in pasting actions you can use, however:\n- Paste the word under the cursor in the current buffer: <insert> or <F2>\n- Paste from search register: <F3>\n- Paste the content of the last visual selection: <F4>\n- Paste from clipboard: <F6>\nUpdate: As of v1.7.6, these mappings have been replaced with the <c-\\> mapping, with the exceptions of <Insert> and <MiddleMouse> now mapped to paste-from-clipboard.\n. It doesn't sort when the prompt is empty. But after you start typing, the results are sorted like in other file modes (shortest match, etc). I'll see if I should change it to 'never' sort.\n. > I would have thought the 'obvious' solution would be to show matches sorted by MRU. Is that possible?\nIn MRU mode, no sorting means the order is defaulted to MRU, but only MRU.\n. So I choose a middleground instead of relying solely on MRU order. Let me know how it works for you.\n. > if I type 'coffee' at the CtrlP prompt, the first choice will be the most recently used file that matches.\nIdeally, but it's really not that simple. If a newer file does match 'coffee', regardless of it being the file you want or not, or of it being the worst match in the list, relying on MRU order alone will always make it the top choice simply because it's the newest.\n. > I'm looking for the most recent match - period. If I have to type some more characters to get to my file, that's OK - because in most cases, I won't have to.\nThat settles it, I guess. I've added an option to disable sorting. But personally, I've always run into the problem in my previous comment (for a while, ctrlp used to not sorting files in MRU mode). It was why I changed this in the first place, since I use MRU a lot myself.\n. It's to keep the matching simple and relatively fast. There's really nothing else.\nAnd as I said before, I'm pretty much done with this part (won't be improving it, at least not significantly). If you want to take a stab at something different, check out the g:ctrlp_match_func option.\n. Thanks for the suggestion! I've added some default ignores. But if the max_files limit is lowered, more people will have issues like #163.\n. This would be too far away from what ctrlp does and how it works, it\nwouldn't even fit as an extension. You should just use grep.vim or ack.vim\netc. Also, this isn't the first time this has been suggested, but thanks\nnonetheless!\n2012/4/26 Enrique Garc\u00eda <\nreply@reply.github.com\n\nWould it be possible to make a ctrlp extension that allowed \"finding in\nfiles\" instead of just finding files by path? I'm thinking about typing\nstuff and having the equivalent of a \"grep -r stuff .\" happening on the\nctrlp buffer.\nThat's what I'm missing the most in my vim these days.\nI'd give this a try myself, but I know null vimscript.\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/issues/180\n. That's kind of how it works. .git has a higher priority than .bzr, and in this case .git is found first, at \"parent\". So parent is identified as the true root of the project. If you want it to look for .bzr first, use this:\n\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_root_markers = ['.bzr/']\n. OK, I'm closing this as the behavior is intended. For a while, ctrlp used to look for all markers in a directory then if nothing was found, moved up to the parent dir. But this allowed the user less control over which should be the root. It always zoomed to the first .git or .bzr no matter what.\nCurrently, if you want \"parent\" to be the absolute root, you can create a marker file parent/.root then put it in the option let g:ctrlp_root_markers = ['.root'] (add .root to .gitignore, too if you don't want it to be committed).\nAnd if you don't want that but the opposite, then use let g:ctrlp_root_markers = ['.bzr/', ...], where ... can be any VCS type you have under \"parent\". Place the ... type before .bzr/ if you have it under .bzr as well.\n. I solve this in some of the extensions by converting {\"title\": \"foo\", \"value\": 1 } to a string like foo<tab>|1| where <tab> is a tab character. Then in ctrlp#xxx#accept, parse the foo<tab>|1| string and get back the title foo and value 1. Also in ext_var, use { 'type': 'tabe' } so that the matching is only against the foo part.\nAn example of this is the line.vim extension.\nBut accepting a different type of variable for ctrlp#xxx#init will require a lot of code changes. Not sure if I want to do that.\n. Then add an id to each candidate, like so:\nvim\nlet s:list = [\n\\ { \"id\": 1, \"title\": \"foo\", \"value\": {...nested datas...} },\n\\ { \"id\": 2, \"title\": \"foo\", \"value\": {...nested datas...} },\n\\ { \"id\": 3, \"title\": \"foo\", \"value\": {...nested datas...} },\n\\ ]\nreturn map(copy(s:list), 'v:val.title   |v:val.id|')\nWhere the returned list looks like this:\nvim\nreturn [\n\\ \"foo  |1|\",\n\\ \"foo  |2|\",\n\\ \"foo  |3|\",\n\\ ]\n. Yes, it's not elegant to use s:list, but the alternative means a lot of code changes in the main script. Also, in newer Vim, you can use v:key instead of adding an id to each candidate.\nAnd if you want to ignore the |1|, |2|, |3| part when searching, then use { 'type': 'tabe' }.\n. OK, closing as I've decided against adding support for different var types. The entries have to be reformatted anyhow, let's just do it in the extensions. And s:vars are already used for caching in some extensions, it's really not a big deal to use more.\n. Thanks! I'll try to include this in filename mode instead of introducing a new mode. Will probably go with using ;.\n. I've added those to the readme on the extensions branch. There aren't enough for a separate page, I think.\n. It's molokai: https://github.com/tomasr/molokai\n. You can just remap the keys:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings = {\n    \\ 'AcceptSelection(\"e\")': ['<c-v>', '<2-LeftMouse>'],\n    \\ 'AcceptSelection(\"v\")': ['<cr>', '<RightMouse>'],\n    \\ }\nThe defaults are at :help g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings.\n. Please read :help g:ctrlp_max_height.\n. To be fair, vimscript itself is kind of hacked together. But anyway, thanks!\n. This has been asked and explained many times. The matching is as good as it gets. Please look into the old issues if you want to find out the reasons.\n. You can use wildignore and g:ctrlp_custom_ignore to filter stuff. Please read:\nvim\n:help wildignore\n:help g:ctrlp_custom_ignore\n:help g:ctrlp_dotfiles\n. Oh I see. Well, unless Vim provides MIME types recognition by default which it doesn't, this will have to be done manually (either in a plugin or in a vimrc file). But I don't think I want to do this in ctrlp, sorry!\n. > pretty useless for ctrlp to show files that Vim cannot even edit\nIt's not just for ctrlp but that's exactly what wildignore is there for. Every file listing plugin and many of Vim's commands and functions rely on this option. What you want is more than any existing plugin or Vim can provide, so by all means, write a new plugin. I'm pretty sure there is no MIME type detection plugin out there, yet, so it might be something worth making.\n. Hmm, it's a suggested solution to always enable the highlighting. If you have/want this highlighting disabled in a few buffers then maybe you shouldn't use these autocmds in the first place?\n\nCan you open the issue tracker on the repo?\n\nIt's closed because I don't want to provide support for it. The script's simply a rewrite of the older scripts with a few things added on top. If anyone wants to improve it, please send a pull request instead.\nThanks!\n. Pulled.\nThanks!\n. You can either use <tab> to auto-complete the directories in foo/bar/ (type f<tab>b<tab>). Or mark the foo/bar/baz.txt file with <c-z> then simply type bazooo.txt and press <c-y>.\nSince it can already be done, I won't merge this. Thanks for making it, though.\n. Then use the second method. It requires even less keystrokes: <c-z>bazooo.txt vs. <c-\\>D/bazooo.txt.\nThe description is at :help ctrlp-input-formats|/f).\n. Yes, all the parent directories will be created if not yet exist. So if you use baz/baz2/bazooo.txt then baz/ and baz2/ will be created under foo/bar/.\nAnd again, all of this can be found at :help ctrlp-input-formats|/f).\n. It's kind of too late for that. I've coded everything around the fact that the 3 default modes are permanent and the others are optional. It's not only the part in ctrlp#setlines().\nFor your problem, you can just map these 3 modes to a few mappings. And maybe reserve the <c-f> <c-b> for the extensions if you don't want to map them as well.\n. Thanks mattn!\n. ctrlp provides an option to rebuild its statuslines, g:ctrlp_status_func, which powerline uses. By the look of it, something triggers fugitive (script 128) to break, leading to its statusline feature breaking, which in turn breaks powerline and then finally ctrlp (script 187).\nSo before starting ctrlp with :CtrlP [dir], run :let g:ctrlp_status_func = {} and let me know if it fixes the problem. Also, run :echo g:ctrlp_status_func after you exit ctrlp and post the output here.\nAfter the above, restart Vim, this time run :let g:ctrlp_log = 1 and then proceed to reproduce the problem. After creating a few error msgs, exit ctrlp and go to the cache directory (should be $HOME/.cache/ctrlp), open the ctrlp.log file and post its content here.\n. OK, I can't reproduce this with the combo conqueterm + ctrlp + powerline + fugitive. I use the settings for conqueterm and powerline found here.\nGuess this will depend on you to track it down, then. The :CtrlP [dir] is handled with the SetWD function. With a [dir] argument, it should return at Line 4: cal ctrlp#setdir(a:1) | retu. It's odd though, because ctrlp#setdir is called later on anyway if you just use :CtrlP. Why doesn't it break then?\nIn any case, it's important to get all the error messages, especially the first ones that create the \"Press ENTER or type command\" prompt.\n. Just a guess, so let me know if this changes anything. For autoload/ctrlp.vim:\n``` diff\n@@ -1115,16 +1115,19 @@ fu! ctrlp#statusline()\n        \\ exists('s:marked') ?

If you have a working solution for your problem then just use it. There's no need to report it or contact me.\n. Implementing this in ctrlp would be a bit needlessly complicated, I think. You can easily solve your problem with a couple of mappings that map to :CtrlP %:h and :CtrlP without a <cr> (you can expand the path after :CtrlP with <tab>). So instead of cd'ing inside ctrlp, do it when starting ctrlp.\nAlso, you can use b:ctrlp_working_path_mode to set this option per buffer, and use the directory mode to change the working directory inside ctrlp.\n. Shouldn't that be let g:ctrlp_working_path_mode = 1?\n.

It looks great but it's a bit too much, I think. And by default, it doesn't actually solve the initial problem.\nI've added a custom pathshorten function, hope it's enough. I'm not pulling this because there isn't a good reason to have the option. Those lines are only for visually identifying the entries and aren't used for matching or much else. So there's little point in allowing users to reformat them.\n. Pulled to my local repo for future reference. Closing for now.\n. There isn't a way in ctrlp, plus I think this is something that you should do in your own Vim configuration. Try looking into local .vimrc files (people usually name them .lvimrc or .vimrc.local), also check out :help 'exrc'.\n. Can you let me know your OS, Vim version and most importantly the output of :echo &term?\nThis is related to how the arrow keys are handled by your terminal. Pressing the keys usually emits ^[ or <esc> followed by a sequence of characters: http://www.termsys.demon.co.uk/vtansi.htm#cursor\nThere isn't much that can be done to workaround this, but I can try including your &term on this line. If you're comfortable with editing the script, put your &term value on that line and let me know if it works.\nIf it doesn't work, then use <c-j> and <c-k> to move the selection instead of using the arrow keys.\n. Not sure if I want to change that since we can use the root_markers option for it. See my answer in issue #166.\n. Have you installed any Vim plugin before? Don't drop the entire CtrlP.vim folder into ~/.vim/plugin. The content of each of the plugin/, doc/, autoload/ folder is supposed to go into the corresponding folder under ~/.vim.\nAlso, I recommend looking into using a plugin manager early on. For example, vundle is a good one.\n. I see your point, but the text is actually a bit longer than that:\n\nExtract the archive to ~/.vim on Linux/MacOSX or $HOME\\vimfiles on Windows.\n\nIt's the little instruction that you see everywhere for extracting stuff. And it really means what it says, that is extracting the content of the archive into the ~/.vim directory. Just follow it to the letter.\n. Yes, it's because ctrlp only started to have extensions after 1.6.1. But again, for the love of everything, DO NOT unpack the entire directory structure (autoload, doc, etc) into the ~/.vim/plugin directory.\nI've made sure the ctrlp.zip archive doesn't have a subdir holding everything, so that you can do something like this unzip ctrlp.zip -d ~/.vim.\n. Have you done the following things?\n- Update the plugin.\n- Refresh the cache (<F5> while in the ctrlp window) after you've added the option. Restart Vim if you want to be sure.\n. OK, this works:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_custom_ignore = 'vendor/bundles/\\(DontIgnore\\)\\@!.\\+$'\nAnd this doesn't:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_custom_ignore = 'vendor/\\(bundles/DontIgnore\\)\\@!.\\+$'\nThe reason is because vendor/bundles also matches vendor/\\(bundles/DontIgnore\\)\\@!.\\+$.\nBasically, the second pattern means matching any \"vendor/\" not followed by \"bundles/DontIgnore\". A vendor/bundles alone fits this description, thus the entire vendor/bundles directory tree is removed when the scanner's scanning the vendor directory.\nSo the first pattern is the one you want.\n. How about you just try the thing out?\n\nThere are in fact, many folders in vendor/ to ignore, MyBundle is the only one to not ignore.\n\nDoesn't vendor/bundles/\\(DontIgnore\\)\\@!.\\+$ fit that perfectly? It matches any \"vendor/bundles/\" not followed by \"MyBundle\".\nHow do you think path matching is?\n. Oh, right, I missed this part: many folders in vendor/ to ignore.\nHow about vendor/\\(bundles\\)\\@!.\\+$\\|vendor/bundles/\\(MyBundle\\)\\@!.\\+$ then?\n. @balta2ar: Try \\v(\\.cpp|\\.h|\\.hh|\\.cxx)@<!$.\n. @balta2ar: Yeah, I missed a <. Already edited my comment right after but was a little too slow :)\n. @balta2ar: OK, it's a bit trickier than I thought. This should work, tested and all that:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_custom_ignore = { 'file': '\\v(\\.cpp|\\.h|\\.hh|\\.cxx)@<!$' }\nRestart Vim or run :unlet g:ctrlp_custom_ignore if you get the \"E706: Variable type mismatch\" error.\nBTW, not sure what's going on with github, I keep not getting any notifications for new comments, even for yours that mention my username.\n. @balta2ar: The notifications appear in my github inbox, there's just no orange boxes. I only saw your 3 days old comment when I checked the inbox for someone's comment that I also didn't see.\n. Please read :help ctrlp-mappings.\n. You should type templateemail without that whitespace in the middle. If you type it without the whitespace but still get the literal string behavior, then make sure you aren't in regexp mode (use <c-r> to toggle).\n. OK, I'm going to assume it was the whitespace. Either way, I'm closing this because the fuzzy has been working fine. The plugin has been around for almost a year, people would have flipped if something so basic wasn't working as advertised, don't you think?\nAlso, about the g:ctrlp_match_func option, it's meant to be used to employ an external matcher, something more powerful than the internal Vimscript one which is the major bottleneck in ctrlp. It's not meant to be a cop-out for the slightest of things, nor for the basic functionalities.\nOne of the little things that convinced me to expose the option was the Windows-only search tool \"Everything\", which can search in millions of files and directories, i.e. entire hard drives, extremely fast. Although I don't think Everything can be used with ctrlp, I still want to make it possible to use the power of such tools when the time comes and more of them are around.\n. They link to files in the same working directory, there will be duplicates\nif they are included. Why do you want to include them?\nI suppose you mean symlinks in the working directory but they link to files\noutside, in that case take a look at the g:ctrlp_follow_symlinks option.\nOn Thu, Jun 14, 2012 at 4:23 PM, georgexsh <\nreply@reply.github.com\n\nwrote:\nCurrently all same-root symlinks are excluded, ref b22ebbe\nI don't get reasons behind this behavior, though I'd link those symlinks\nto be included.\nMaybe addming another option to control it?\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/issues/215\n. OK, I can always let the follow_symlinks option take another value, say 2, to follow all symlinks indiscriminately. I just want to understand the reasons.\n\nCan you explain why you would want to include both of these?\n/root/working-directory/symlink\n/root/working-directory/mytextfile\nWhere /root/working-directory/symlink pointed to /root/working-directory/mytextfile.\nThey would appear like this in ctrlp, and select any of the files would open mytextfile:\nsymlink\nmytextfile\n. I see. Thanks! I'll add the value soon.\n. Actually, the counter isn't real time, it only gets updated when the scanning of a directory depth is finished. When it hangs like that it basically means it's still scanning, and that directory depth just has a lot of files.\nSo yeah, no way to workaround because that's just how the counter works.\nAs for speeding this whole process up, take a look at the g:ctrlp_user_command option. Also, after the first scan of a directory tree, the refresh will be much faster because the OS caches the results.\n. Thanks! Glad you like it!\nAlso, since you restart Vim often, check out the clear_cache_on_exit option, see if setting it to 0 helps.\n. It is not yet possible to do this with the default_input option, I'll enable it regardless but would it be simple enough? It would work with every command, including :CtrlP and those that already accept a directory or a buffer name:\nvim\nnn <silent> ,d :let g:ctrlp_default_input = expand('<cword>')<cr>:CtrlPBufTag<cr>\nUsing a command argument would be heavy on the coding side, but the mappings would look like these:\nvim\nnn <silent> ,d :exe \"CtrlPBufTag \".expand('<cword>')<cr>\nnn <silent> ,d :exe \"CtrlPBufTag -default-text=\".expand('<cword>')<cr>\nAlso, currently you can insert <cword> through using the <c-\\> mapping inside the prompt.\n. Thanks for the pull request! But this is kind of pointless. en and fini are the short forms of endif and finish, and they are just as valid, see :help :en and :help :fini. And being listed as a valid command in Vim's help is safe enough, I think.\n. Have you cleared the cache after setting the options? Try pressing <F5> inside the prompt or restart Vim, just to be sure.\n\nI thought these settings were supposed to help eliminate unwanted files from showing up in the results.\n\nThey are, and they have been working perfectly fine pretty much since introduction. The only problem people have had is not knowing about clearing the cache.\n. I also have had image files ignored with wildignore for a really long time now because I do web works, this line among others has worked without any problem in ctrlp and everywhere else:\nvim\nset wildignore+=*.zip,*.rar,*.gz,*.png,*.gif,*.jpg\nPlease try the following:\n- Update the plugin to the current HEAD of master.\n- Clear the cache with :CtrlPClearAllCaches.\n- Start Vim with minimal configuration like this:\nvim --noplugin -u path/to/a/simple/.vimrc\nUse this as the content of the above .vimrc:\n``` vim\n  set nocp\n  set runtimepath^=~/.vim/bundle/ctrlp.vim\n  runtime! plugin/ctrlp.vim\nset wildignore+=/tmp/,.so,.swp,.zip,.jpg,.gif,.png,*.pdf\n  let g:ctrlp_custom_ignore = {\n    \\ 'dir':  '.git$\\|.hg$\\|.svn$',\n    \\ 'file': '.png$\\|.gif$\\|.jpg$',\n    \\ }\n  ```\nThen try to reproduce the problem.\nAlso, try this both before and while using Vim in minimal configuration:\n1. cd into the app/assets/images/ directory.\n2. Try using tab completion: type :edit grid.p<tab> where <tab> is the <tab> key.\n   In both times, see if grid.p is auto-completed to grid.png or not.\n. Thanks! I'm going to go ahead and close this one now. For one, whatever the external source that causes globpath() to fail to obey wildignore probably isn't something I can address in ctrlp anyway. I mean if calling globpath(path, expr) suddenly isn't enough to apply wildignore then what is there to do?\nHowever, if you manage to track down the plugin or config that causes this, then please do leave a comment.\n. Ah, I thought of this before, but unfortunately Vimscript can't be run asynchronously. So no, it's not possible to build or rebuild cache in the background, or doing anything in the background for that matter.\nI think my closest attempt at this was to run the needed commands in another Vim instance through the client/server interface. I abandoned the idea because it was difficult to reliably implement for everyone. But if I remember correctly, it kind of worked.\nIf anyone wants to try, check :help remote_send. Basically, you just need to send the :CtrlP /path/to/build/cache<cr> string to the other Vim instance.\n. Alright, closing.\nAlso, as an addendum, to clear cache and rebuild, you can send :CtrlPClearCache<cr>:CtrlP /path/to/rebuild/cache<cr>. And to close the match window after the rebuild, send :winc c<cr>.\n. Close to a million entries is simply too many. ctrlp or vimscript can't handle that, at least with our current hardware. And I don't think there is any way to use vim's native tag jump in ctrlp.\nSo I suppose you just don't do it, don't use it for large tag files.\n. That'd require a pretty big code change, I think. Plus I don't really like making more special cases for the input.\nFor an alternative solution, you can use something like this:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_cmd = 'exe \"CtrlP\".get([\"\", \"Tag\", \"BufTag\"], v:count)'\nThen pressing <c-p> will run :CtrlP, 1<c-p> will run :CtrlPTag and 2<c-p> will run :CtrlPBufTag. So technically it's still 1 mapping, and for example, instead of typing <c-p>t anystring, type 1<c-p>anystring.\n. OK, closing. This won't be added. There's nothing in the current code that can support or extend into it. I probably won't accept a patch for something like f anystring or #f anystring either. It's a big code change for a rather small convenience.\nBut in any case, there'll need to be new unique and memorable identifiers for all the extensions, user made ones as well, i.e. the t, f, bt... that you suggest. This isn't much difference from predefining a bunch of mappings, in the sense that you have to memorize something. And if you have to memorize something anyway, then just memorize your mappings instead of the identifiers. And I hope that doesn't affect your workflow negatively.\n. Those are just the first files found in the directory. There's nothing special whatsoever. What you want is MRU mode, or Buffer mode would be suffice. Also, for that exact use case you have, you can just use Vim's <c-w>T, this will move the mistakenly opened split to a new tabpage instead.\n. No, they are just the ones that happen to be on the top of the returned list. And thanks for the idea, I'll think about it.\n. Thank you! I've made the current behavior optional instead. The new option is g:ctrlp_tabpage_position.\n. The basic usage on the homepage and in the readme should be enough, I think. All the pages link to each other anyway.\nFor your problem, please see #220. Most likely it's the cache. If it isn't then if you can, do some tests and help me track down the culprit.\nThanks!\n. You're correct, it's capped at the max height. That's pretty much how it works. The match window simply shows a few of the matches. To show more you can just change the max height option. I don't think I want to change this behavior now and make the window scrollable, mainly for performance reasons.\n. When g:ctrlp_dotfiles is disabled, all dotdirs under the working directory are ignored, no exception. The current file you are editing is in a dotdir or not doesn't matter. So basically what you want here is for ctrlp to make an exception for the directory of the current file being edited, and to disregard the g:ctrlp_dotfiles option in that case.\n\nI would expect that when g:ctrlp_dotfiles is disabled, ctrlp wouldn't look past a dotfolder for a root marker.\n\nOK, why would it do that? What if people genuinely want to root to .git? What you expect is for the finding root feature to unexpectedly break when the current file you're editing happens to be in a dotdir.\nIf you often have files you want to search for inside dotdirs, then just don't reset g:ctrlp_dotfiles. But if you insist on setting it to 0, then use something like :CtrlP %:h to start ctrlp in those special cases.\nThis isn't a bug as the ignoring works exactly as it should. And I don't think want to add an option for this because it's simple to workaround.\n. Latex isn't a default filetype so you'll have to set the arguments to use to call ctags as well. You can set them with the g:ctrlp_buftag_types option.\n. Duplicate of #196. You're supposed press Enter (<cr>) to submit the dots.\n. No worries! At least searching is a bit easier now thanks to this :)\n. I'm still undecided, but I might look into adding options for defining custom opening functions so that this can be configured.\nHowever, if I decide not to add any option, this can still be done within an extension. One that only shows files it has a special opening command available for.\n. I've added an option. This is probably as far as I'm going to go with this feature.\nHere's an example function to open HTML files in the default web browser from the <c-o> prompt:\n``` vim\nfunction! HTMLOpenFunc(action, line)\n    if a:action == 'x'\n    if fnamemodify(a:line, ':e') =~? '^html\\?$'\n        \" Get the filename\n        let filename = fnameescape(fnamemodify(a:line, ':p'))\n\n        \" Close CtrlP\n        call ctrlp#exit()\n\n        \" Open the file\n        silent! execute '!xdg-open' filename\n    else\n        \" Not a HTML file, simulate pressing <c-o> again\n        call feedkeys(\"\\<c-o>\")\n    endif\n\nelse\n\n    \" Use CtrlP's default file opening function\n    call call('ctrlp#acceptfile', [a:action, a:line])\n\nendif\n\nendfunction\nlet g:ctrlp_open_func = { 'files': 'HTMLOpenFunc' }\n``\n. @mMontu: no, the MRU list only records buffers that you open in Vim. But I'll see if it makes sense to allow adding items manually, since this probably won't be used for anything else.\n. @mMontu: I've added a new function:ctrlp#mrufiles#add(). You can call it, for example, after the file opening line in theHTMLOpenFuncfunction above. Usecall ctrlp#mrufiles#add(filename).\n. @mMontu: Sorry to disappoint you, but those are only visual cues :) For example, the top level folds with*have multiple functions, and the ones with-only have one function. The foldmethod is justmarkerwith the default markers{{{,}}}, enforced by the modeline.\n. Did you test with the same buffer in the first window and in the current window? Does it make any difference if you setg:ctrlp_switch_buffer` to 0?\nEither way, can you provide steps to reproduce and the window layout (the positions and the file/buffer of each window) you have when opening the entries? Take a couple of screenshots if you can.\n. I see. With the switch_buffer option on, the cursor will be moved to the first window that has the buffer when an opening command is issued. It's very similar to running :sb when Vim's switchbuf has useopen.\nThis is still kind of counter intuitive with :e, though. I'll change it.\n. > I can open the file manually and then use the :CtrlPMixed command to find the file like normal.\nHave you cleared the cache after setting the options? You can either press <F5> in the match window or run :CtrlPClearAllCaches from Vim's command line.\n. Yes, definitely. Now I just have to decide which other items should be on it.\n. @timc3 @screwzm Have you guys increased the max_file limit before clearing the cache? That's pretty important.\n. @screwzm by default, ctrlp also set its own local working directory. Take a look at g:ctrlp_working_path_mode and g:ctrlp_root_markers.\n. @screwzm a blank window containing a unnamed buffer including the first one when you start Vim normally, is always reusable by default.\n. @screwzm then it's probably not a normal blank window. CtrlP only avoids replacing a buffer if it's a special buffer (unlisted with a non-empty buftype other than \"help\"), or has unsaved changes without hidden or autowrite set.\n. That dialog is a Vim's built-in feature that's triggered automatically. See :help tag-matchlist and check the example output under :tselect. And because these commands only accept the tag name, it's really hard to differentiate 2 tags with the same name in different files.\nThe tag extension has a workaround for this, but apparently it doesn't always work.\nCan you provide a test case including the tag names, the filenames, the tag files and their locations?\n.

But I haven't updated my git installation for more than a year, so maybe that's the reason.\n. Great, thanks! I'll push this to master soon once I'm sure there isn't any side effect.\n. @jszakmeister can you provide a test case like Jeroen did in the 3rd comment?\n. Looks like you're using an older commit without the above fix. Make sure to update to HEAD of master, and let me know if you still see the issue.\n. I still can't reproduce it by following the steps in your test. And oddly enough, the old version can also get the tag count from your tags file (meaning no Vim's tag-matchlist dialog).\nWhat's the full path to file1.py and file2.py? And what does :pwd return after you open gVim?\n. Please try starting gvim with this:\ngvim --noplugin -u path/to/a/simple/.vimrc\nUse this as the content of the above .vimrc:\nvim\nset nocp\nruntime! plugin/ctrlp.vim\nJust make sure the parent directory of plugin is in your runtimepath, for example ~/.vim.\nSee if you still get the tag-matchlist.\n. It might be something that changes the tags option (see :help 'tags'), or the working directory. I'm honestly not sure.\n. Ah I see. Thanks! When cst is set, :tag uses :cstag which in turn performs :tjump. And :tjump always shows tag-matchlist when there are 2 or more similarly named tags.\nSince tag.vim only works with tags files, it might be a good idea to reset that option when using :tag.\n. You can by pressing <F5> in MRU mode. A bit hidden but this is mentioned in the doc at :help ctrlp-mappings.\n. In answer to your initial question, no, it's not possible. The prompt_mappings option is only meant for the mappings you see in the ctrlp-mappings section in the doc. You also shouldn't remap <space> because it's one of the keys used for inputting, and there isn't a way to map it only in one mode.\nYou may, however, use the followings which work in all modes, but be warned that you're not supposed to do this:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings = { 'PrtAdd(\".*\")': ['<space>'] }\n\" or\nlet g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings = { 'PrtAdd(\".*\")': ['<c-@>'] }\nOtherwise, just type .* directly.\n. This actually isn't a typo as I purposely changed it pretty early on. You can see this in the doc here, and here. The long form's kept in the code because I don't want to break people's mappings.\n. Yes, there isn't a way to change the autocomplete, otherwise I'd have done it as well. And technically you were right, there isn't a :CtrlPMRU defined, it's just an abbreviation of :CtrlPMRUFiles which I think is slightly more difficult to remember.\n. Those autocmds work fine for me. I also use some autocmds to restore cursor position and folds and never had a problem.\nCan you consistently reproduce this? If you can, please provide a test case including the buffers you have open, how you move away and reopen them with ctrlp.\n. If I understand your situation correctly, you have a .git directory at your home directory? And the svn project is in a subdirectory also under your home directory? If that's correct, just put .svn in the root_markers option:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_root_markers = ['.svn']\nAs for why, see my answers in issue #181. But now I think I might need to change this a bit. It seems like a lot of people expect it to work without the priority thing.\n. No, there's no other way with the plugin. But if you can, update your project and SVN install. From SVN 1.7, there's only one .svn directory at the root of the project: http://subversion.apache.org/docs/release-notes/1.7.html#single-db\nAnyway, I'll be making some changes to remove markers' priority so that people using multiple VCS'es won't have to put .svn, .bzr, ... in the root_markers option. This option will be reserved for the .root type of markers.\n. @danielb2: The number on the left is the total number of files found until the last directory depth.\nHow do you tell ctrlp to only search for .php files?\nAlso, the root_markers option is only for determining the local working directory inside ctrlp, it has no impact on the indexing. Unless of course the new root (with root_markers) is a parent directory of the old root (without root_markers), then the indexing being slower is simply because the parent directory has more files.\nP.S. I wasn't ignoring this, btw. For some reason I didn't get any notification for your comment, so I only saw it just now.\n. @prezjordan: It's an optional feature which you can disable. See :help g:ctrlp_working_path_mode.\n. No, it's not possible. This is pretty much what regexp mode is meant for: giving users control over the exact search patterns. You can just type app.*a\\.xml.\n. This simply can't be done. Vim is single threaded. Things can't be run in the background because there isn't a background to begin with. Everything happens in Vim happens in the same thread as your text editing actions.\n. Hmm, sounds like you have a different definition of \"background threads\". Things that you don't see running are not things running in a background thread. And I'm pretty sure the linters are simply fast enough so you don't notice the delay most of the times.\n. Oh I see. But it's simply impossible with Vimscript because Vim itself is single threaded.\n. AsyncCommand uses --remote. Basically, it runs the needed commands in another Vim instance. This also requires Vim built with +clientserver.\nThe top answer in the stackoverflow quesion also offers the same thing: :!gvim -c 'MyMake', this starts another Vim instance.\n. Well, I just don't think it's reliable enough to implement within the plugin. But yeah, try it in your own configuration if you want, see if it works for you.\n. Yes. But I'm not completely against the idea. It's just not on a todo list.\n. I can't reproduce and there has not been any issue related to ctrlp's buffer local options. Please test with a clean environment to make sure this is a ctrlp's problem.\n. Did you also test with a minimal .vimrc? Or with simply using :edit to open the files?\nMake sure you don't have a set number line somewhere in your .vimrc before the set rnu line.\nIt still looks to me like it has something to do with your configuration. A single set rnu in .vimrc works for me (like it does for someone else here). And given how often this option is highlighted as a cool feature of Vim 7.3, a lot more people would have reported this if it came from having set rnu alone.\n. No, there isn't a way. Spaces are a part of the search pattern because they can be in a filename.\n. I see. I did study fuzzyfinder while writing ctrlp, many of ctrlp's features are my own interpretations of fuzzyfinder's. So for the most part, I'm sure you won't miss much.\nCheers!\n. > Maybe mention in the doc that custom_ignore is ignored if user_command is used?\nIt's mentioned, or implied, in the doc under g:ctrlp_custom_ignore and under g:ctrlp_user_command.\n\nVariable type mismatch for: g:ctrlp_custom_ignore\n\nThe options are for users to set. This error can only happen if you set the option twice in one Vim session in different types. The plugin itself does not create g:ctrlp_custom_ignore.\nEdit: OK, I guess you probably don't even know that in Vim we can't set a variable in a different type without :unlet it first, otherwise you wouldn't have associated this error with the plugin as it is completely outside of the plugin's control. See :help E706, and think of the options as simple variables that you need to set.\n. Merged.\nCheers!\n. Can you share your full Vim configuration? Also, let me know the exact steps to reproduce these beginning from starting up Vim.\nLine 17 of BuildPrompt is a redraw command and E68 is related to syntax highlighting so the first problem might have something to do with the other buffers you have open (since redraw affects the whole screen). You can test this by opening ctrlp right after starting up Vim, and try to reproduce the error.\nFor the second problem, does the entire Vim window become jumpy or just the content of the non-ctrlp buffer(s) become jumpy?\n. What OS are you using on this computer? Do you have any customizations for amix's config?\nAlso, from the error msgs, it looks like this starts right from the init step to every action that calls BuildPrompt, including adding and deleting characters.\nI doubt this has anything to do with the cache, but you can try deleting the ctrlp.vim bundle and the cache directory, then clone the plugin again from here.\n. OK, I see. I'm going to need you to help me test these:\n- Instead of using amix's config, start gVim with minimal configuration like this:\ngvim.exe --noplugin -u path/to/a/simple/_vimrc\nYou can add the extra arguments to the gVim shortcut, it works the same as running from a command line.\nUse this as the content of the path/to/a/simple/_vimrc file:\nvim\n  set nocp\n  set runtimepath^=path/to/ctrlp/directory\n  runtime! plugin/ctrlp.vim\nChange the path/to/ctrlp/directory to the location of ctrlp on your system.\nAfter starting gVim, press <c-p> to open ctrlp, then try to reproduce the problem.\n- Instead of the above test, apply this patch and start gVim in your normal configuration, then try to reproduce the problem:\n``` diff\n  diff --git a/autoload/ctrlp.vim b/autoload/ctrlp.vim\n  index b27380d..7bb0627 100644\n  --- a/autoload/ctrlp.vim\n  +++ b/autoload/ctrlp.vim\n  @@ -529,7 +529,7 @@ fu! s:BuildPrompt(upd, ...)\n          \\ : ['CtrlPPrtText', 'CtrlPPrtCursor', base]\n      let hibase = 'CtrlPPrtBase'\n      \" Build it\n  -   redr\n  +   norm! :\n      exe 'echoh' hibase '| echon \"'.base.'\"\n          \\ | echoh' hiactive '| echon \"'.prt[0].'\"\n          \\ | echoh' hicursor '| echon \"'.prt[1].'\"\n  @@ -1597,7 +1597,8 @@ fu! s:insertstr()\n   endf\nfu! s:textdialog(str)\n  -   redr | echoh MoreMsg | echon a:str | echoh None\n  +   norm! :\n  +   echoh MoreMsg | echon a:str | echoh None\n      retu nr2char(getchar())\n   endf\n  ```\nAlso, make absolutely sure you're using the latest version of ctrlp by cloning it directly from here (the ctrlp's commit that amix's config points to is 3 months old).\nLet me know how it goes in each case.\nThanks!\n. I think the problem with the patch is the whitespaces (tabs vs. spaces, it happened before).\nAs for the errors, if ctrlp works in the first test, then something in your normal configuration is definitely conflicting with ctrlp.\nIf you're interested in tracking it down, you can try disabling each of the plugins and remove parts of your _vimrc and other configs etc... until you find the culprit. If you do find it, then please leave a comment or just open a new issue. If I can, I'll try to find a workaround for it regardless if it's a ctrlp's problem.\n. Hmm, sounds like it might be related to this powerline issue: https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline/issues/161\nI can't reproduce that, though so I'm not sure if it has something to do with the errors here.\nAs for the coloring issue, I think you should open a new issue with powerline since it is what powerline does. Other than calling a specified function, ctrlp doesn't have much say in how the custom statusline works or looks like.\n. It works fine for me and the code checks out, too. What mapping or command do you use to open ctrlp?\n. I can't reproduce this and I don't see how this part of the code can go wrong. It would be a much more widespread issue if it was straight up broken.\nCan you try deleting and cloning the repo again? And if that doesn't help, please do the following:\n1. Set let g:ctrlp_log = 1 in your .vimrc.\n2. Restart Vim and start ctrlp to try to reproduce the error.\n3. Exit ctrlp and go find the ~/.cache/ctrlp/ctrlp.log file.\n4. Post the content of the ctrlp.log file here.\nThanks!\n. Ping.\nI just need the error log because the E731 doesn't look like it's the only error message. It makes no sense to have this particular error with the current SetWD() function.\nAlso, just to avoid any interference, try starting Vim in minimal configuration like this when getting the error log:\nvim --noplugin -u path/to/a/simple/.vimrc\nUse this as the content of the path/to/a/simple/.vimrc file:\n``` vim\nset nocp\nset runtimepath^=path/to/ctrlp/directory\nruntime! plugin/ctrlp.vim\nlet g:ctrlp_lazy_update = 1\nlet g:ctrlp_max_files = 30000\n``\n. OK, I'm closing this for now due to lack of information. I can only see the E731 error happens there if somehow you use the olderautoload/ctrlp.vimfile with the newerplugin/ctrlp.vimfile, thus passing a Dictionary from:CtrlPto be used as a String with the olderSetWD()(line 3 of it had astrlen()` call).\nBut it makes no sense with the newer autoload/ctrlp.vim because the newer SetWD() always treats its main argument as a Dictionary. There's just no way to create an E731 there, even if trying.\nSo as I see it, it's either an old Vim 7.0 bug which I can't reproduce, or something is getting mixed up in your configuration. If you manage to grab the error log or find out something new or how to consistently reproduce this, please leave a comment and reopen the issue.\n. Hmm, I don't see a point in adding that one pair of movement mappings. The other mappings get a mention because they are somewhat unique to ctrlp, people don't expect and don't look for them.\n. Maybe because they are guessable (hjkl)? But if someone doesn't figure it out, they can always read the mapping help at :help ctrlp-mappings, which is what I prefer people to do.\n. Yes, you can. Check the bundled extensions for examples. Here's the syntax highlighting in bookmarkdir.vim:\nhttps://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/blob/master/autoload/ctrlp/bookmarkdir.vim#L86-99\n. Oh, I see. That's currently only possible with filename related modes (files, buffers, mru etc). It's a bit complicated to highlight matches in other modes because of overlapped highlightings so I just disable it.\nI don't have any plan to enable it any time soon.\n. Yes, that's the spot. But just enabling it like that won't work well in many cases (e.g. it highlights the wrong strings).\n. Well, it's kind of too late for such a big change, or inclusion. Besides, I prefer using a buffer from the very beginning, it's basically the reason ctrlp exists and is what it is. But using a menu to display the results is how fuzzyfinder does it, so if that makes or breaks it for you then you might want to give fuzzyfinder a try.\n. See :help g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings, and also read the note under it regarding <c-h> and <bs>.\n. :CtrlP ., or turn off the root finder with g:ctrlp_working_path_mode.\n. Actually, this is quite a bit different from 159 and is simpler to implement. I can just compare a filename with the patterns in the option and push it down the results list if it matches them.\nBut I really don't want to complicate the matching even more now. In one way or another, this option will have to be checked and compared with on every single change in the search string (i.e. on almost every keystroke).\n. > If 'undordir' is set, the files are created with the same extension as the original file, so wildignore can't be used.\nYou can ignore directories with wildignore, not only files. Try set wig+=*/undo/* (or when ssl exists and is off: set wig+=*\\\\undo\\\\*).\nAs for custom_ignore, because the rtscript extension looks directly for files under &rtp, ignoring directories alone (e.g. with { 'dir': '/undo/' }) won't work. You need something like let g:ctrlp_custom_ignore = '/undo/' which applies to everything (note that set wig+=*/undo/* does, too).\n. Merged. Thank you!\n. I suppose you use g:ctrlp_user_command?\n. What do you mean by \"won't search inside directories\"? Does setting let g:ctrlp_custom_ignore = '' change anything? What's the working directory inside ctrlp when you open it?\nI don't think this has anything to do with 258. He uses g:ctrlp_user_command to get the index from git ls-files.\n. It was because of a change I made to the default ignore rules that covered too much stuff. This should be properly fixed now in b7cb2f5.\n. :CtrlP app/decorators should open ctrlp in app/decorators and :CtrlP app/models should open it in app/models. This is the default behavior.\nYou probably have set autochdir somewhere in your config or a plugin or function that changes the working directory (outside of ctrlp) after opening a file.\n. Thanks! :)\nIf you want to use that autocmd or set autochdir later on, just use an absolute path with the :CtrlP command (since :CtrlP directory is basically :lcd directory). This probably applies to :CommandT, too.\n. It's the root finding feature. You can turn it off with the g:ctrlp_working_path_mode option.\n. This is a known limitation (of this type of prompt). I have to create a mapping for each and every key while the timeoutlen has to be set to 0. Because of these reasons it's not possible to type accented or multibyte chars that require multiple keypresses.\n. @lucapette: No, it's fine. I do take note of everything even if I don't post a reply :) Thank you!\nBut I'm still a bit undecided about the FAQ, actually. Right now, other than the issues with people not knowing about the cache, the other issues only ever show up once or twice, and they are pretty much \"how it is\" kind of things (either something with no workaround or a feature mentioned in the readme and in the help). If they keep showing up more, though, I'll probably put a few into a separate FAQ.md or a wiki page and put a link in the readme.\n. > Expected:\n\nVim opens with the CtrlP prompt open (vim -s enters the keys in the given file after the vimrc has been loaded)\n\nHmm, vim -s file is basically :source! file (note the !), so if you put :CtrlPMixed in that file, Vim will open with :CtrlPMixed in the command line, ready for you to press <cr> (this isn't your expected behavior). So unless every other terminals you've tested for some reason output the /tmp/ctrlp file with Windows' line ending (CR+LF), vim -s file won't ever work the way you expect it to work.\nIn any case, try just typing vim -c \"CtrlPMixed\", or without typing the -c part, just vim and then press <c-p>, instead of going through the extra step of putting the command into a file, which shouldn't work in the first place.\nClosing this because the expected behavior is an incorrect behavior.\n. No, the new line only works if it has a CR character in it like a Windows' line ending, with CR+LF (\\r\\n). The carriage return (CR) will be read as a <cr> in Vim. That's the only way vim -s file is going to do what you're expecting it to do. But on Ubuntu, the new line is only comprised of a LF (\\n).\nI think what you actually meant to use is vim -S file. There's a big difference between -s and -S. And -S does exactly the behavior that you're expecting -s to do here.\nBut anyway, it's up to each person to choose what to use, making sense be damned... old habits die hard and all that. If you choose to keep trying to use vim -s file then who am I to say otherwise?\n. What do you see in Vim when using -S? Also, try vim -c \"CtrlPMixed\".\n\nIf the CR character is not interpreted in the same way as \\n by vim -s.\n\nThat wasn't what I meant. What I meant was that a new line on Ubuntu only has a LF, so vim -s file should never work like you say.\n. Nope, that doesn't ring any bell. I'm sorry but I've no idea what's wrong with your environment at this point. None of the behaviors makes sense. I guess you'll have to settle with not being able to open ctrlp this way.\n. So far it's just yours. And that just adds to the mystery. Since first you said vim -s file worked fine (including with ctrlp) in all other terminals that you'd tested, while it should not. Now both -c and -S don't even work where -s worked. So everything is basically working backward on your set of terminals. And that's what I mean by \"your environment\".\n. Yes, -c and -S work fine for me on multiple OS'es including Ubuntu. Never had a problem.\n. Hmm, why? The tab completion inside the prompt isn't meant to be a replication of :e's. The resulting string is simply used as a search string to search for files and directories under ctrlp's current working directory, that's why it's relative.\n. > if you want to open ANY file you no longer have to think \"Is the file in my current directory or not?\".\nThat's not what ctrlp sets out to do. It doesn't and can't care about files outside of the working directory. Also, CtrlPMixed doesn't include CtrlPDir.\n. This is an intended behavior (done with the :hide command). When the changed buffer is hidden, the changes are not saved and also won't get lost.\nSo why do you want the confirmation dialog? I don't see any reason to have it at all.\n. I've changed this behavior a bit. Now instead of hiding the modified buffer and reusing the window, ctrlp opens a new split for the new buffer when hidden, confirm, autowriteall... are off.\nIf you find any problem with this change, let me know.\n. It's the root finding feature controlled by g:ctrlp_working_path_mode. Without setting it, it's defaulted to 'rc'. The behavior you're seeing is the 'c'.\nYou can use let g:ctrlp_working_path_mode = 0 to disable this feature.\nYour other projects probably have a root marker (.git, .hg, etc) at ~/code/project.\n. I'm not sure myself. The original screenshot was taken sometime last year. But it was likely one of the Proggy fonts or the ProFont at a larger size. If not, then I might have uninstalled it at some point.\n. It was definitely a pixel font, though. I was trying a lot of pixel and bitmap fonts at the time. I think I stopped using this one because of the small line space which made reading difficult.\n. Yes, I'm back to Consolas and Monaco now.\nAlso, thanks for the tip!\n. Added. You can check :help g:ctrlp_switch_buffer for details.\n. What tags file do you mean? And how exactly can scrapping a file list from a tags file be faster than say git ls-files?\n. Hmm, I guess you mean ctags-generated tags files, or similar... Well, the file list that can be scrapped from a tags file will be most definitely not the same as the index returned from globpath(), find, dir or git ls-files. So it simply can not be used as a direct replacement for those. Furthermore, I don't think scrapping and filtering a massive tags file for only a few files can be faster or more effective.\n. And not just filtering, whenever you wanted to update the file list, you would first have to run ctags on the entire code base to update the tags file...\n. Yeah, it's not really a bad idea, I just think it isn't very practical.\n. Thanks! But this is a user option. The most I can do with this type of information is adding new examples in the docs.\n. mdfind hardly fits the bill. It doesn't list hidden files by default, and the syntax you use only lists files that have file in their metadata (most likely in the filename). It only shows about 250 files in ~5000 total in my home directory.\n. Closing. This isn't exactly necessary and mdfind also doesn't work for what we need.\n. Added. Thank you!\n. Thanks! Just pushed a fix. Let me know if you find any other problem.\n. Hmm, can you be more specific? What exactly do you want to implement and how do you plan to implement it in Fugitive? I'm curious as to how something can possibly clobber the option, or more importantly, why does it even have to do that? Since ctrlp runs in its own buffer and has its own local working directory, pretty much having its own world.\nI'll certainly consider this but to have that particular ctrlp#custom(), there'll need to be a lot of changes. So what exactly do you want it for? Something to use in Fugitive to get the user_command feature for :Gstatus? I don't think I follow...\nAlso, <c-p> in Normal mode is a duplicate of k, so it's not hard to see why nobody has complained about that default (which can be very easily changed anyway, and the option to do this is plastered everywhere).\n. Oh I see. I thought you were talking about ctrlp's <c-p> mapping. I didn't know :Gstatus's <c-p> clobbered ctrlp's. But I still don't get exactly what this will be used for, and in which situation... I'm down with allowing more control, in any case.\nSo what if you could use a b:var which could be modified freely, with the git ls-files command that would be used in let files = split(system(...), \"\\n\")?\nvim\nlet b:ctrlp_user_command = ['.git', 'git --git-dir=/tmp/repo/.git/modules/submodule ls-files -oc --exclude-standard']\nAnd instead of using call ctrlp#custom({ 'root': '/tmp/repo/submodule', ... }) to open up ctrlp, just use :CtrlP /tmp/repo/submodule, since this only matters for find file mode. \nAn alternative to this is let b:ctrlp_working_path_mode = 0, lcd /tmp/repo/submodule, then :CtrlP.\nWould that work/be enough?\n. Well, fugitive would have to mess around with let files and call ctrlp#custom() otherwise, right? With a b:var, it wouldn't have to run another system(), while the git ls-files command would still be needed in any case.\nThe :CtrlP command started to take a path very early on, about a year ago today I think... Also, the fact that I mainly use git from console probably contributes to me not getting this. I don't have a clear idea of what :Gedit does, for example.\n. Then just do the usual saving & restoring for g:ctrlp_user_command, like this for example:\n``` vim\nfunc! CustomUserCmd()\n    if exists('g:ctrlp_user_command')\n        let saved_user_command = g:ctrlp_user_command\n    en\nunl! g:ctrlp_user_command\n\nlet g:ctrlp_user_command = ['.git', '...']\nCtrlP /tmp/repo/submodule\n\nunl! g:ctrlp_user_command\n\nif exists('saved_user_command')\n    let g:ctrlp_user_command = saved_user_command\nen\n\nendfunc\n\" Mapping for the status window\nnn    :call CustomUserCmd()\n```\nWhat do you think? It beats me having to modify ctrlp so that it takes options' values via function arguments, which I suspect very few people (if not nobody else) will probably ever need.\nI'll still proceed with adding support for using b:var, though, since among other things, it'll allow people to (more easily) overrule the above behavior should they want to.\n. Yeah, it's very often used to workaround problematic Vim's options or to create a more suitable enviroment. Like this particular one, for example:\n``` vim\nlet s:keepcpo = &cpo\nset cpo&vim\n...\nlet &cpo = s:keepcpo\nunlet s:keepcpo\n```\nFor the b:var change, I'll push it out soon after I can do some testing.\n. So I decided to bite the bullet and add support for overriding some options when calling ctrlp. Here's what the function call should look like:\nvim\ncall ctrlp#init(0, { 'dir': '...', 'opts': { 'user_command': ['.git', '...'] } })\nIf you find any problem with these changes, let me know. Thanks!\n. Thanks! But this should be done by the external matcher instead. There's no need to create a new option.\nHijacking the s:highlight() function like this also doesn't work well because the pattern sent to it is already reformatted, it isn't the same one sent to the external matcher.\n. I suppose you've solved your problem?\nAnyway, there's so much confusion regarding this option, and so many false bug reports, from both people who do and do not know of its existent. I'm really tempted to just disable or remove the feature altogether.\n. The path_mode = 'r' setting for ctrlp is only effective when a root (which should have a root marker) is actually found. If there's no root, ctrlp will use the current working directory, and I guess in your case it's set to the directory of the current file by the autochdir option.\nSo instead of a combination of autochdir and :e, you should use :e %:h/new_file.\n. OK, since I can't really test this, I'll trust you on it. I'll merge and push it out soon.\n. That's awesome. Thanks, @d11wtq!\nI encountered a few problems with the control mappings. For example, pressing <tab> (9)  throws an E471, and pressing <c-\\> (28) or <c-o> (15) does nothing.\n. Yep, that seems to fix it. But I just noticed, this stops working after toggling the focus with <s-tab> then back again. I tried adding another s:KeyLoop() call after toggling but this in turn causes errors when closing ctrlp. Any idea?\n. This solves the above problem for me, not sure if there's any side effect yet:\n``` diff\n+++ b/autoload/ctrlp.vim\n@@ -561,7 +561,7 @@ fu! s:BuildPrompt(upd)\n endf\nfu! s:KeyLoop()\n-   wh exists('s:focus') && s:focus\n+   wh exists('s:init')\n        redr\n        let n = getchar()\n        let c = type(n) == 0 ? nr2char(n) : n\n@@ -739,7 +739,7 @@ fu! s:PrtSelectJump(char)\n            let npos = match(lines, smartcs.'^'.chr, s:jmpchr[1] + 1)\n            let [jmpln, s:jmpchr] = [npos == -1 ? pos : npos, [chr, npos]]\n        en\n-       keepj exe jmpln + 1\n+       exe 'keepj norm!'

Here's an example from a different script:\n``` vim\nlet g:ctrlp_match_func = { 'match': 'MatchFunc' }\nlet g:path_to_binary = \"/path/to/binary\"\nfunction! MatchFunc(items, str, limit, mmode, ispath, crfile, regex)\n  \" Create a cache file\n  let cachefile = ctrlp#utils#cachedir().'/custom.cache'\n  if !( filereadable(cachefile) && a:items == readfile(cachefile) )\n    call writefile(a:items, cachefile)\n  endif\n  if !filereadable(cachefile)\n    return []\n  endif\nlet cmd = g:path_to_binary.' --limit '.a:limit.' --manifest '.cachefile.' '.a:str\n  return split(system(cmd), \"\\n\")\nendfunction\n```\nYou can check the help for the details on the arguments.\n. Yeah, it's an option to replace the built-in matching function.\nSo this isn't possible, yet, I think. With an extension, ctrlp still does all the matching and filtering. I might do something about this in the future, but it probably won't be anytime soon.\n. With how ctrlp does the matching, adding this will impact performance. So I'm not going to add it. It's a good idea otherwise, though.\n. vim\nlet g:ctrlp_show_hidden = 1\nIt's 0 by default now. I switched it off because people keep complaining about indexing time. Plus, ctrlp was one of the few finders (if not the only one) that showed hidden files by default.\n. There's a short changelog in the help file. But yeah, I guess I could be a bit more explicit with it.\n. ctrlp doesn't have this built-in. I'm not going to add it because it's not essential, and you can just be creative with the options. Use something like this in your vimrc, for example:\n``` vim\nlet g:ctrlp_buffer_func = { 'enter': 'MyCtrlPMappings' }\nfunc! MyCtrlPMappings()\n    nnoremap   c-@ :call DeleteBuffer()\nendfunc\nfunc! s:DeleteBuffer()\n    let line = getline('.')\n    let bufid = line =~ '[\\d+*No Name]$' ? str2nr(matchstr(line, '\\d+'))\n        \\ : fnamemodify(line[2:], ':p')\n    exec \"bd\" bufid\n    exec \"norm \\\"\nendfunc\n```\nThen pressing <c-@> in Buffer mode will delete the selected buffer.\n. It's partly because there aren't many usable mappings left to use. I'd also have to make something to allow changing the deletion command between :bd, :bw, :bun, otherwise people would be requesting it. Lastly, I think people should be using plugins dedicated to buffer management instead.\n. @amadeus Yeah, the snippet was written before the addition of No Name buffers. I've updated it a bit.\n. Does this happen everywhere or only in some directories? Does it happen with other commands like :CtrlPBuffer?\nWithout more information, it looks like it has something to do with the directory you are currently in. Line 1 of GlobPath is just a call to Vim's globpath(). The E16: Invalid range error otherwise makes no sense in the context of this function.\nYou can test by running :CtrlP path/to/an/empty/directory, where path/to/an/empty/directory is the path to any directory with no files and no sub directories.\n. Let me know if 10bbbfa changes anything.\n. Hmm, there's no h in spec/requests/static_pages_spec.rb, so wouldn't typing static_h or just h be enough to find the second file? If there are other files interfering then that's a bad example, I think.\nAnyway, I really don't want to make the matching more complex as it will impact performance. As for interpreting spaces as either underscores or spaces, take a look at the g:ctrlp_abbrev option.\n. It's a new option, so just update your copy.\nAnd yes, with the abbrev option you can replace the space entirely with the underscore. Example:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_abbrev = {\n    \\ 'gmode': 't',\n    \\ 'abbrevs': [\n        \\ {\n        \\ 'pattern': '\\(^@.\\+\\|\\\\\\@<!:.\\+\\)\\@<! ',\n        \\ 'expanded': '_',\n        \\ 'mode': 'pfrz',\n        \\ },\n        \\ ]\n    \\ }\nThe \\(^@.\\+\\|\\\\\\@<!:.\\+\\)\\@<! part is for keeping the space in some special cases.\n. Those indicators interfere with the matching. They also mess up the opening of the buffers because they are added at the source and become a part of the buffer names.\nPersonally, I'd just use :ls to get a more informative buffer list.\n. Just one small (negligible) issue. When in regexp mode, the indicators break the highlighting of the matched string:\n```\n\ndoc/ctrlp.txt [+]\n[===statusline===]\nr>> txt$\n```\n\nNormally txt should be highlighted.\n. Thank you! This is good enough for now. I'll try to fix the issue with the highlighting later.\nBTW, I've changed the format of the indicators to resemble the output of :ls.\n. There are 2 limits: max number of files g:ctrlp_max_files, and max directory depth g:ctrlp_max_depth. Try increasing them. Also, check your wildignore option and make sure temp* (or something along that line), isn't in it.\n. See :help g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings. But <c-x> can't be changed to just i because i is used for inputting the letter i literally. If you want to change <c-x> to <c-i>, then you'll also need to replace <tab> (also with the option) because <tab> and <c-i> have the same keycode.\n. It can be used to autocomplete directory names for @cd directory<cr> (change ctrlp's working directory), or for directory/filename<c-y> (create a new file).\n. You can rebuild the statuslines with the g:ctrlp_status_func option and change or move the parts however you like. See :help g:ctrlp_status_func for details.\n. They are indeed swapped. I'll correct it. Thanks!\n. It's regexp matched against directories and filenames literally when scanning. I suppose you've figured this out with the other issue (#290).\n. That's because the option is applied after globpath() returns the results. The cache won't contain the ignored files. So it's close but isn't exactly \"when scanning\" (as is normally understood).\nTo apply some ignore rules when globpath() is running, you should use Vim's wildignore.\n. What do you mean by \"not showing any option\"? Does ctrlp not start? Or ctrlp starts but there's no result?\nHow many files are in the same directory as the file you just open?\n. Set g:ctrlp_working_path_mode to 0 or an empty string. Or if you pull in the recent commits, you won't have to because ctrlp now uses a different default behavior.\n. How about let g:ctrlp_custom_ignore = $HOME.'/\\(Library\\|Music\\)$'?\n. It already is, the BufLeave event is included along with BufAdd, BufEnter etc. So just update your copy. I added this a long time ago, but if you haven't updated for a while, you might not have it yet.\nAlso, if you want to keep the last access order when typing the search string, then set g:ctrlp_mruf_default_order to 1. Otherwise the list will be sorted just like in the other modes.\n. You can use :CtrlP /var/www/myproject/bla/bla/theme.\n. The root_markers option must be a List: let g:ctrlp_root_markers = ['pom.xml'].\n. The default value is a List in the help file. The option's name is also plural. But yes, if issues like this keep coming up, I'll explicitly mention the var type, at least for some options.\n. Doesn't happen to me (but I'm not using Janus), and so far no one else has had this problem nor there has been any similar issue. So it's likely caused by something else in your Vim config.\nYou can try starting Vim in minimal configuration (without Janus) with just the 2 plugins. If it doesn't happen then try disabling the plugins or any configurations you have in Janus one by one, until you find the culprit.\nIn any case, can you provide more details and steps to reproduce? Does it happen all the time or only with some specific window layouts? From which window do you invoke ctrlp (nerdtree or an existing vertical split)? ... Take some screenshots if you can.\n. OK, this is almost definitely because (at least) one of the existing windows next to nerdtree has set winfixwidth. That's the only way I see running :vnew can crush every other window including nerdtree. There's nothing special about how ctrlp opens a vertical split (just a plain :vnew filename).\nClosing since this isn't a ctrlp's problem.\nYou can find out what set winfixwidth for your windows by grepping your Vim config for winfixwidth or wfw.\n. Both of the commands already include named, unsaved buffers. I'll see what can be done about unnamed buffers.\n. You can use the g:ctrlp_user_command option for this. For example, if you have the cscope.files file at a directory where you normally want ctrlp to start scanning from:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_user_command = ['cscope.files', 'cat %s/cscope.files']\nOn Windows, use type instead of cat.\nIf you want ctrlp to zoom onto the parent directory of cscope.files automatically:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_root_markers = ['cscope.files']\nFor using several files, you can use autocmds to change the options based on the current buffer:\nvim\nau BufEnter *.py\n    \\ let g:ctrlp_user_command = ['py.files', 'cat %s/py.files'] |\n    \\ let g:ctrlp_root_markers = ['py.files']\nIf I add a new option specifically for using file list files, it'll be very similar to g:ctrlp_user_command in this case and will require the same configurations. So I probably won't, to avoid redundancy.\n. All the past attempts to improve or make complicated the internal matching algo have resulted in lower performance. And performance is what Vimscript already severely lacks. Real improvements can only be done by using a different language. It's the main reason the g:ctrlp_match_func option was added.\nSo my answer to your question is I have no interest in improving the internal algorithm. And g:ctrlp_match_func will remain a user option.\n. See :help g:ctrlp_open_multiple_files.\n. Are you sure about that behavior? If you read taglist's help, Tlist_Auto_Open is only for automatically open the taglist window when opening Vim. If you check the code, this is the only place it is used:\nvim\n    if g:Tlist_Auto_Open\n        autocmd VimEnter * nested call s:Tlist_Window_Check_Auto_Open()\n    endif\nThis won't automatically open the taglist window when you open a file after Vim is already open.\nEdit: I didn't see your second comment when I started investigating.  Well, it isn't a bug in taglist, either, since it isn't a bug to begin with. It seems you're just expecting the option to work differently than its defined behavior.\n. No problem. Also, taglist hasn't been updated for 5 years now, I'd just leave those changes in the plugin or branch it, just to be safe.\n. <c-s> is reserved for terminal control flow. You should use <c-x> to split horizontally instead.\n. It's a known limitation of the ctrlp prompt. Try setting g:ctrlp_key_loop and see if you can type those letters. Check out :help g:ctrlp_key_loop for the details. There's currently no other workaround.\n. Update to the version on github. The last version is 1.78.\n. I can't reproduce this. I tried with having a few horizontal splits and a quickfix window at the bottom. The present of the quickfix window doesn't seem to make any difference.\nCan you provide the reduced .vimrc and take some screenshots before and after opening ctrlp?\n. Thank you! It seems that the problem lies with Vim being unable to correctly restore the window layout from the output of winrestcmd(), in the case where there's a window with set winfixheight and it's crushed by a :resize command run on a new window.\nI've pushed a workaround. Let me know if you find any problem.\n. You can do that in ctrlp but only in filename-only mode, which can be toggled on/off with <c-d>.\n. It definitely works for me. Are you using the latest version on github?\n. My email can be found in the repo with git log. There's no need for a personal email but thank you for the intention! I appreciate it.\n. However it would work, it would require rebuilding of the cache in the background. This can't be done with Vimscript in a single Vim session.\n. Would moving the match window to the top of the screen work for you? The top hit won't jump around if the match window is at the top. You can have this by setting g:ctrlp_match_window_bottom to 0.\n. Use g:ctrlp_mruf_exclude instead. g:ctrlp_custom_ignore and wildignore are only for ignoring files from globpath(). You should also check out :help ctrlp-options.\nBTW, instead of forcing ctrlp to ignore .vimrc, I'd investigate to find out why the file was always the most recent file because that's not normal. On ctrlp's side, a file's only added to the MRU list if it's opened as a buffer.\n. Looks like you're using this config line which is for Windows:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_user_command = 'dir %s /-n /b /s /a-d'\nJust switch to the one for Linux. But unless you want a different list, or want to do something special with it, you don't need to use g:ctrlp_user_command to get the files.\nAlso, check out :help ctrlp.txt, there are a lot more stuff and more details than in the readme.\n. It's because a lot of the times the tag file can be pretty big, reformatting the tag lines will take a long time. So I want to keep it simple and fast. There's no other reason.\n. Good idea, but aside from the highlighting, there's still the problem with the matching. Matching a filename including path is different from matching a tag or a line entry.\nYour proof works because coincidently the tag's and the line's lines have very similar formats. But if you throw files or buffers into the mix then filename-only mode won't work, and the entire tag line (the tagname and the extra infos) will be included when matching.\nOriginally, I also wanted the mixed mode to work with a command like this:\nCtrlPMixed --mode=files,buffers,tags,...\nBut I didn't and still don't think it's worth making, at least until I can figure out how to solve all the major problems.\n. Actually, ctrlp is more like a search interface than a command mode auto completion system, so I'm not sure it fits what you're looking for. But basically, it uses the user input as a search string on a predefined list of items and then returns the results.\nThe buffer is a just normal buffer with a few settings like buftype=nofile, nobuflisted... It's not a preview nor a quickfix buffer/window. There's no cmap because the mappings are Normal mode mappings, which you can find in the Mappings section.\nBut in case you want to create a simplified version of ctrlp so that you can (basically) have an extension without the core, you might want to read the Mappings section for getting user input, the MatchedItems section for searching, and the BuildPrompt section for displaying everything in autoload/ctrlp.vim.\n. There are already mappings to open entries in vertical or horizontal splits. Please read :help ctrlp-mappings.\n. You probably hit the max_files limit which is set to 10000 files. Try increasing it with the g:ctrlp_max_files option.\n. There's no other condition. So naturally files that are in deeper directories have higher chance of being excluded.\n. Press <F5> when ctrlp's open or use the commands (see :help ctrlp-commands).\n. Merged. Thank you!\n. Duplicate of #280. You can start with the .vimrc snippet in that issue.\n. Can you help me test to see if read/write when receiving SIGTERM is actually working for you?\nFrom outside Vim, create a text file /home/user/test/readwrite.txt containing only one line: read. Then put this into your .vimrc and restart Vim:\nvim\nlet g:rwtestfile = '/home/user/test/readwrite.txt'\nau VimLeavePre * cal writefile(readfile(g:rwtestfile) + ['write'], g:rwtestfile)\nAfter you run shutdown or kill the gVim process, check if the readwrite.txt file has this:\nread\nwrite\nBoth this and the MRU saving work fine for me with a kill pID, which also sends SIGTERM.\n. That's interesting. Thank you! I also just tried shutdown, and apparently the readwrite.txt file above isn't changed (write isn't appended) when using shutdown. So in any case, I'll need to find a workaround for this, possibly by saving the MRU list more frequently instead of only when exiting Vim.\n. I've added a new option: g:ctrlp_mruf_save_on_update, defaults to 1. If you find any problem with it, let me know.\nI don't like it but there's really no other way. Saving on exit doesn't work when using shutdown, even when the autocmd consists of only readfile() and writefile(). Also, saving on every update is what mru.vim and others do (e.g. fuzzyfinder), ctrlp also did it by default in the beginning. It's not out of the norm.\n. I've made some new changes. Now saving only happens when a new entry is added. Changing of order won't be saved until exit or when another entry is added. This will be just enough to prevent completely losing the new entries in case Vim isn't closed normally.\nAlso, this was before adding the option, but in your test script, if I add another sleep instance after killall in the inner loop, then in both cases all of the 5 files are always shown.\n. Thank you! But this feature already exists. You can remove non-existing entries by pressing <F5> in MRU mode.\n. Merged. Thanks @mattn!\n. Yes, the window isn't supposed to be scrollable except for a few extensions. The number of results is limited at the max height. This is intended for performance reason.\n. Fixed. Sorry about that!\n. Thank you! But you can already do this with the g:ctrlp_buftag_types option. No need to change the code to get it.\n. Fixed. Thank you for reporting! This bug had been there pretty much since the beginning I think. It happened when :cd into an empty directory then open ctrlp and use <c-y> to create a new file (or some sub dirs and a new file).\n. There's already an option to keep the cache:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_clear_cache_on_exit = 0\n. Just make sure the options are actually set. You can run :echo g:ctrlp_clear_cache_on_exit to check. The deletion happens at only one place, and it's just a simple if check for g:ctrlp_clear_cache_on_exit before running the clearing function.\nIn any case, try starting Vim in a clean environment like the following and see if it changes anything. From the console, run vim --noplugin -u path/to/a/simple/.vimrc and use this as the content of the .vimrc:\n``` vim\nset nocp\nset runtimepath^=~/.vim/bundle/ctrlp.vim\nruntime! plugin/ctrlp.vim\nlet g:ctrlp_use_caching = 1\nlet g:ctrlp_clear_cache_on_exit = 0\n```\nChange the runtimepath location accordingly.\n. Duplicate of #313. But good idea about adding an indicator for hitting max_files. I'll see what I can do.\n. Update to the latest version on github, currently 1.78. This has already been fixed.\n. There's an option for this. What you want is the second example at :help g:ctrlp_abbrev. Update the plugin before checking it out since it's a fairly new option.\n. That will replace all spaces with .*. You won't want that if you use special inputs like @cd path/. If you use those, start with the pattern from the help: '\\(^@.\\+\\|\\\\\\@<!:.\\+\\)\\@<! '.\n. Yes, it's intended, or was intended. If the option does take effect in Mixed mode then in most cases, it'll effectively remove all MRU files in the mix. But now that I see some people might actually want that, I think I'll enable it.\n. Files is the default mode because it's what the majority of people use ctrlp for. If Files isn't the default you want, you can easily change it with the g:ctrlp_cmd option:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_cmd = 'CtrlPMRU'\n. The last mode isn't saved cross session. It's only stored in a script local variable. There isn't a way to save then initialize it yourself. But you can use something like this to start LastMode with something other than Files:\n``` vim\nlet g:ctrlp_cmd = 'call CallCtrlP()'\nfunc! CallCtrlP()\n    if exists('s:called_ctrlp')\n        CtrlPLastMode\n    else\n        let s:called_ctrlp = 1\n        CtrlPMRU\n    endif\nendfunc\n``\n. Which closed issue do you refer to? But this slowness is typically because ctrlp can't handle the large file list. This is slightly more apparent on Windows. There's really nothing I can do about it other than to tell you to try limiting the number of files with theg:ctrlp_max_files` option, and updating ctrlp and gVim.\n. Have you read them or just put up everything you could find after I asked?\n46 wasn't a bug. It was a delay when starting up caused by the user having similar mappings.\n55 I even asked the person in another issue but he never provided the file that caused it.\n116 was fixed. It was fnamemodify() being slow, the same reason I've always tried to avoid using this function.\n331 is this issue.\nAlso, I want to add that I see every issue as something that I need to deal with, to be done. I will close and ignore the ones that I deem not worth following up, they may or may not be actual fixable bugs. But if there's a valid bug or a common problem I can identify, I always try to fix it or at least provide a solution for it as soon as I see the report.\n. CtrlP has a documentation which you can access by running :help ctrlp.txt. All the available options are documented in there.\n. You can use the CtrlPLinePre highlight group to change the color of the > marker.\nAlso, check out :help ctrlp-customization for the available hl groups.\n. An index from the results is worthless in term of identifying a string. There also isn't any way to get the actual index of the string in the initial list since the results are usually sorted. I think your best bet would be to add an identifier to the strings like this:\nfoo\n  bar1 (1)\nbar\n  bar1 (2)\n  baz\n. I suppose it is. You can just put them in a s:syntax() function in the extension. Also, use 'type': 'tabe' for the s:foo_var variable, then add the identifiers like this:\nbar1<tab><conceal_id_begin_char>1</conceal_id_end_char>\n. Yes, some of the sorting functions are disabled for other types. So use 'type': 'path' and make sure the conceal chars are unique then, maybe something like +++ 1 +++.\n. Well, it does match if you use 'type': 'path' because this tells ctrlp to treat the entries as directories and files. So you'll want to make sure the conceal_id chars are unique and unlikely to be searched for.\n. Ok, I'm going to close this. I won't be adding it.\n. I can't reproduce it. Can you try reproducing it in a clean environment? If not then can you narrow it down and find out what might be interfering?\n. Can you rephrase that? Not sure if I understand what you mean.\nAlso, this would have been a major problem for a lot of people if it was easy to reproduce. I think something else in your Vim setup is probably interfering. It might be an autocmd, or something custom.\n. It's because of the 'exit': 'ctrlp#exit()' key:value pair in s:git_files_var. You don't need that if you use the builtin ctrlp#acceptfile().\n. Looks like you're using an older plugin/ctrlp.vim file with a newer autoload/ctrlp/ directory. This might happen if you have multiple installations of ctrlp in different places.\nSo first remove anything you can find, then follow this guide to make a clean install.\n. OK, I'm going to close this. g:ctrlp_buftags and CtrlPBufTag are defined in the open and in the same file as the CtrlP command. The only way they don't exist while CtrlP does is if you're somehow using a really old plugin/ctrlp.vim file from before BuffterTag mode was added.\n. It's just the standard cursorline, you can change it by changing the CursorLine highlight group of your colorscheme.\n. Check out the g:ctrlp_buffer_func option then. You can put the :highlight commands in a pair of functions, and call one on enter and another on exit.\n. See :help g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings. Also, check out :help ctrlp-options and :help ctrlp-mappings while you're at it.\n. Thanks! But tag.vim doesn't have it because the :tag, :tjump... commands don't always jump to the tag's position (because of an outdated tags file, for example). I suggest you create a mapping for zvzz, like ,z, which can be used elsewhere.\n. If :tag fails, running zvzz blindly will open the folds and change the view of the current buffer.\n. Vim has the 'foldopen' option, but it only applies when the command is typed directly in the command line. I'll see if using feedkeys() can get around this.\n. Done. Let me know if you find any problem with this.\n. The reason for using feedkeys() is so that 'foldopen' will take effect automatically. There's nothing for zz. If :tag fails, running zz will still change the view of the current buffer regardless. So no, it's not safe. You'll just have to type zz manually.\n. Actually no, unless in a :try :catch, Vim will continue with the next command, in this case with zz whether it's in feedkeys() or not.\n. The problem with that is without :catch, the commands after :endtry won't be executed. I also don't like using :try with commands that involve opening of files because :try can stop an autocmd from firing if an error happens before it.\n. Can you describe it a bit more? What exactly are you trying to do for your plugin? You want to create some mappings with <leader>?\n. So you want to be able to literally type <leader>[c], for example, and it would take you to a file with c highlighted without having to press <cr>?\n. OK, so that'd be searchstring<leader>c or <leader>c to select an entry. That'd be very different but would it really be much better than say searchstring[c]<cr>? Or just [c]<cr>? Since you'd want the hotkeys to be unique anyway.\n. Still, it seems like a big change for speeding up a small task, that is selecting an entry already in the match window. You can also already press <s-tab> and type the first letter of the entries to jump to them, or just type a few more characters to narrow down the results. So I don't think I'm going to add support for this feature.\nTo simulate a keypress in general, try feedkeys() instead of normal!.\n. Oh I see. I just always consider adding things so that people don't have to modify the core to get what they want.\n. There's no option to hide specific buffers. If the netrw buffer shows up when you run :ls (it doesn't for me) and its buftype is empty, then CtrlPBuffer will list it.\nIn general, you can force a buffer from showing up by setting its 'buflisted' option to 0.\n. Then you can get that resultant file list and feed it to ctrlp through an extension. It should be simple. But I don't think I'm going to add such an extension to ctrlp. It isn't really that useful since a file list from grep is usually quite short.\n. Have you typed the name of a file you want to create into the prompt first?\nJust in case, check out :help ctrlp-input-formats, section f) for the details on how to use <c-y>.\n. <c-y> basically just does a :edit newfile for you. If :edit does throw an error, you'll see it.\n. Make sure you update to HEAD of master. There used to be stricter rules of when ctrlp reuses the current window.\nWith the current version, ctrlp will still open a new split (when using the default <cr>) if the current buffer is either having a non-empty buftype, is help or quickfix.\nYou can add exceptions to this with the g:ctrlp_reuse_window option.\n. Usually SYSTEM\\Rank.cpp will be at the bottom (or at the top, if you've changed the default listing order), unless the other found files are much newer since this matters more in MRU mode. And regexp mode simply eliminates all the other files that aren't Rank.cpp.\nAlso, in case it isn't obvious enough, by default ctrlp shows results from best to worst from bottom to top (of the match window) and highlights the best one at the bottom.\nBut in any case, I won't be making any more changes to the sorting algo, at least in the foreseeable future. So that's as good as it gets.\n. You can use <tab> to autocomplete the directory names under the cwd. Try it and see if it's what you're looking for.\nFor example, type @cd subd<tab> where subd is from subdirectory.\n. Actually, ctrlp isn't a word-completion plugin, it's a finder. I'll have to recreate the e-like or cd-like completion inside the prompt in some way. The basic completion with <tab> is meant for directories under the cwd, which is ctrlp's main concern.\nWith that said, I'll still look into implementing this and will add it if it's simple enough. But if it turns out to be more trouble than it's worth, then I'll probably drop it.\nFor the time being, you can do a @cd ~, @cd $HOME, or @cd / before doing the @cd subd<tab>.\n. Well, the difficult part here is ctrlp operates in Normal mode. The prompt isn't actually the command line nor it's in Insert mode where word-completion is readily available.\n. You just need to clear the old file cache. Check the document (or the readme) for the mapping and commands. If you like, you can also disable caching permanently or partially with the g:ctrlp_use_caching option.\n. It's limited that way so that searching doesn't become too slow too quickly. You can search the old issues if you want to find out more about this.\nIf trying different search strings bothers you too much, you can either set a bigger g:ctrlp_max_height which may help, or use g:ctrlp_match_func to setup a custom matching function.\n. The highlighting of the selected line is just the default cursorline. If Vim's cursorline is somehow not visible with your colorscheme/setup then there's nothing I can do to change that. It's entirely up to you to configure it.\n. The initial order doesn't make much difference since the results are sorted and mixed up when you search anyway. There's no way to tell whether a result is file, buffer or mru unless we do a check for each which can be expensive. Also, the current initial order isn't always file + buffer + mru, it's just shorter list goes first.\n. Well, mru usually already contains buffers, exceptions like unsaved buffers are rare. So a mixed mode for only buffer + mru wouldn't be much different from mru mode.\n. What do you mean by \"all have working directory as 'src'\"? What does :pwd return after you :cd into those repos? \nThe name of the cache file is based on the return value of getcwd(), so it should already be the full path. Your patch also doesn't actually change anything since dir is always getcwd() (a case where a:0 == 2 hasn't been used anywhere in ctrlp).\n. I believe this is an old issue of vim-powerline on Windows, the report used to be at Lokaltog/vim-powerline#161.\nThe vim-powerline issue tracker has been disabled and I don't remember the exact conditions, but it had something to do with the highlighting or folding in the current buffer, then simply echoing/redrawing would trigger error messages. The BuildPrompt() function just inevitably trips on the errors although none of the conditions was originated from ctrlp (so they couldn't be worked around).\nIt might help if you manage to fix that broken character in the font you're using that appears on the statuslines.\n. Makes me kind of wonder if it's a good idea to use :silent! when calling BuildPrompt() again to suppress the error msgs (harmless in this case), but that'll also make it more difficult to track down actual bugs in the future.\n. Vim has those options, splitright and splitbelow.\n. How often does it happen? When do you usually notice it after closing/starting Vim? Do you change your user account (thus change the home dir)? I'm going to need at least something.\nCtrlP itself only ever clear MRU if you press <F7> while in MRU mode, and there's a confirmation dialog. The caching has been unchanged for the last year and there hasn't been any related issue. You should check for external sources that can delete those cache files, starting with your Vim config.\n. Closing due to lack of information, plus I don't see any conceivable way ctrlp can mistakenly delete the cache file.\n. That's strange that it didn't happen in your last time exiting Vim. Can you post the output of :ver and any setting you have for ctrlp? Also, make sure your ctrlp bundle is up to date.\nI don't notice anything on the list, and ctrlp recreates the folders whenever something needs to be saved. Currently, this happens when pressing <F5> in ctrlp or exiting Vim.\n. That's normal. By default, any file that isn't a log file or cache.txt will be deleted upon exiting Vim. And .DS_Store is hidden.\nIf this starts happening again, you can try setting g:ctrlp_clear_cache_on_exit to 0, the clearing function simply won't be called.\n. @mMontu You can still avoid requesting cache updates by hand by having let g:ctrlp_use_caching = 0.\nBut in case you want to investigate at code-level, the main (and only) deletion function in ctrlp is ctrlp#clra(). It's called when exiting Vim if the clear_cache_on_exit option is set, running :CtrlPClearAllCaches calls it directly.\n. @whimdump I've pushed a change a couple of months ago that should prevent this kind of problem for good. Are you using HEAD of master of the ctrlp repo on github?\n. This can't be done with Vimscript because it's single threaded. It's not possible to do the loading while running something else to intercept the keystrokes. I'm unsure what we see when scanning the first time is either provided by Vim or by the OS, but it can't be replicated with scripting.\n. Yes, see :help g:ctrlp_mruf_exclude. You can use a pattern like this \\v\\.git/(COMMIT_EDITMSG|index).\n. These are left out because I want to list only the more unique mappings that people don't look for if they don't know the features exist.\n. It's because <c-s> and <c-q> are used for control flow in terminal. They can't be mapped. If you really want to use <c-s>, you'll have to configure your terminal to pass it to Vim. Otherwise, just use <c-x> everywhere.\n. Is there any reason for the s:MatchItPy() function to be in autoload/ctrlp.vim? You can just as well define it as a global function and put it elsewhere. This is basically what the g:ctrlp_match_func option is there for, it's so that you don't have to make change to the core.\n. Yes, you can use ctrlp#call(name[, args]) to call a function in the scope of autoload/ctrlp.vim.\n. If you're using g:ctrlp_user_command with a version control listing command then you'll have to commit the new files first or use a command that lists untracked files. If you aren't using this option, then make sure the new files aren't in an ignore list or are hidden files. Check wildignore and g:ctrlp_custom_ignore if you have them.\nNext time, if you think something is a bug, please provide details like steps to reproduce and your configurations. Don't use the tracker like a support forum when you run into a problem.\n. Don't change the help file, that does nothing. You're supposed to put the let g:ctrlp_max_height = 40 line into your .vimrc file. It's the same file that you put the line to load up pathogen.\n. Just use anything that's present in the paths you want to be ignored but not in the others. Use the whole paths if need be.\n. The problem with staying pure Vimscript and in a single Vim instance is that there's no way to avoid the waiting part, so auto-updating with CursorHold (forcing a wait) is out of the question. The modification time of a directory also isn't reliable for detecting changes.\nBut to minimize or eliminate manual updates, you can use the g:ctrlp_use_caching option. For example, use let g:ctrlp_use_caching = 200 to disable caching for directories that have fewer than 200 files.\n. You can remap the keys. See :help g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings.\n. If you don't select anything, you can close the ctrlp window by pressing either <esc> or <c-c>. If you want to close it from a script, ctrlp#exit() already calls s:Close() so there's no point for another function.\n. I see. Can you checkout commit 675faa7 and see if it still works for you? If it does work, then look into the change in 6c49f2a and let me know if you figure out something (try removing the bufnr or bufname or both) that works for you.\nThanks!\n. It's so that the closing function is called only once and it's through a BufLeave autocmd. It looks like this autocmd is never triggered for you. You can try to track down the cause, but if it's too much trouble, use this for now:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings = { 'Close()': ['<esc>', '<c-c>'] }\n. Duplicate of #368.\n. You probably have a new repo dir, like .git, in your home dir. Try let g:ctrlp_working_path_mode = 0, this will tell ctrlp to not try to find a root and just use the cwd.\n. It isn't there because I want to keep the readme brief, and there are a lot more at the suggested :h ctrlp-mappings.\n. No, both should work and they do for me. Where's the /tmp directory in relative to the directory you're indexing? Do you change any other option? What ctrlp version are you using? If you can consistently reproduce this, let me know how.\n. Oh I see. That's a known issue. It's because dirs and files are filtered separately with each pattern. Can't really avoid this unless I use the dir pattern to filter files as well, but this will make having different types redundant.\nSo it may seem inconsistent and odd when you notice it, but I think I'll just leave it that way. At least people will still have the option to ignore only dirs.\nAs for converting custom_ignore to wildignore, you can already use both, and for custom_ignore you can write complex regex while you can't for wildignore. A conversion will likely break it for a lot of people.\n. This isn't exactly a new idea, but understandably, everyone wants it. The problem is that there's no background thread in Vim and Vimscript. I'll have to either use a different language or start a new Vim just for the indexing.\n. That's partly by design. The height is to help speeding up the indexing and the searching. As a result, it becomes more difficult finding files further down the file list. This is usually fine since files further down usually have long paths and need more specific search patterns anyway. But with git ls-files, the files under config are returned after all the subdirs, so the config/routes.php is being placed closer to the bottom.\nThat's where you have your problem. I won't be making any change to the internal indexing and searching, so this won't ever really be fixed. But since you're already using g:ctrlp_user_command, you might want to look into using g:ctrlp_match_func as well.\n. I'm going to need a little more details. Which of the ignored files still show up? Can you post your full vimrc? Do you use g:ctrlp_user_command? What ctrlp version are you using? Post a step by step from when you save these options to when you open ctrlp. Also, try running :CtrlPClearAllCaches before opening ctrlp and see if it changes anything.\n. The OS shouldn't matter. So first, make sure you're actually rerunning ctrlp for the same directory, then find and check if any new cache file is written. The cache location is set by g:ctrlp_cache_dir, make sure this location is writable from Vim.\nIn any case, please post your full vim config and a step by step from when you open ctrlp the first time to the second time, and the location where you open it.\n. So it's the default value which is $HOME.'/.cache/ctrlp' on both. Check for the cache there.\n. Just press <cr>, or whatever key you have set to AcceptSelection(\"e\") with the g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings option. Provided that you're using a recent version, ctrlp won't avoid the current window unless the buffer in it has a non-empty buftype.\nThe <c-o> then r combo which works for you, does the same things that <cr> by default does.\n. OK, it looks like I might be too quick to assume you just didn't try <cr> but used <c-x>, or <c-v>, etc. instead (kind of made sense to me since you said <c-o>r worked). I took the liberty to look into your vimrc and found this line:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_split_window = 1 \" <CR> = New Tab\nSo there you have it. It's an old option that allows you to change how <cr> opens a file. Either comment it out, switch to g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings completely, or keep using <c-o>r.\nAnyway, if you've been aware of the config line and actually didn't try <cr>, then my apologies for the redundant post.\n. You can do this with the g:ctrlp_buftag_types option. There's no need to make changes to the code.\n. The other ctrlp mappings, specifically the <c-...> mappings, do they work? Can I take a look at your full Vim configuration? What happens if you open ctrlp immediately after starting up Vim? What happens if you comment out your mappings? What happens if you start Vim in minimal configuration with only ctrlp?\n. Having a higher priority only means that the marker is closer to the beginning of the List. So you can solve your problem with git and perforce by placing .git before .p4config like the following, no need to change the code:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_root_markers = ['.git', '.p4config']\n. It's not that simple. Using the formatted (i.e. the non-raw) list will leave behind duplicate entries which are MRU files in the cwd.\n. I've applied the option to the raw MRU list intead. Thank you for looking into this, anyhow!\n. This should be fixed now. Thank you for reporting!\n. The prompt and the match window are handled completely different in ctrlp. For one thing, you type everything in Normal mode instead of in Insert mode. It'll require a massive rewrite to allow for something like this, so no.\n. Either remove --exclude-standard or don't use g:ctrlp_user_command and hide unwanted files with the ignore options. But if you still want to use user_command, and removing --exclude-standard doesn't exactly do what you want, then read git ls-files --help and find out yourself whether or not you can get it to do what you want.\nOnce you use g:ctrlp_user_command, it's up to you to feed ctrlp the file list.\n. There's the g:ctrlp_default_input option with which you can create a command like this:\nvim\ncom! -n=? CtrlPDefInput let g:ctrlp_default_input = <q-args> | CtrlP\nThen just use :CtrlPDefInput profile.\nIt's an option because allowing :CtrlP search-string while already having :CtrlP path/ can complicate things quite a bit.\n. Other than in a few modes (Mixed, RTScript), I don't see how anything in ctrlp can create duplicates. All the internal actions are either removing or sorting.\nThe git ls-files -moc command you use, however, does create duplicates. It lists both modified files and cached files. You can test this by modifying a tracked file, then before adding the changes, run git ls-files -mc, you'll see the file showing up twice.\n. git ls-files -moc | uniq can still list duplicated files. Try it with a small repo so you can spot them more easily.\n. Well, uniq only removes successive identical lines, so it'll fail to remove duplicates if the lines simply aren't next to each other. But that aside, you can avoid the dupes by just not including -m, -oc already shows all the files, modified or not.\n. It's firstly because you've switched <cr> and <c-t>, and secondly because switch_buffer only applies for modes that handle files or buffers directly (the idea is from Vim's switchbuf).\nApplying this option to other modes will really complicate things. In Tag mode, for example, the commands for opening are just the :tag series of commands. I'd have to create something to replace them in order to apply switch_buffer.\nIf you only call the modes directly, you can probably use something like this:\n``` vim\nfunc! MyPrtMappings()\n    let g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings = {\n        \\ 'AcceptSelection(\"e\")': [''],\n        \\ 'AcceptSelection(\"t\")': ['', '<2-LeftMouse>'],\n        \\ }\nendfunc\nfunc! MyCtrlPTag()\n    let g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings = {\n        \\ 'AcceptSelection(\"e\")': ['', '<2-LeftMouse>'],\n        \\ 'AcceptSelection(\"t\")': [''],\n        \\ }\n    CtrlPTag\nendfunc\nlet g:ctrlp_buffer_func = { 'exit': 'MyPrtMappings' }\ncom! MyCtrlPTag call MyCtrlPTag()\n```\nThen use :MyCtrlPTag instead of :CtrlPTag.\n. Is there any reason to use git ls-tree -r HEAD | grep -v -e \"^\\d\\+\\scommit\" | cut -f 2 instead of git ls-tree --name-only -r HEAD, or just git ls-files?\nTo list files not yet committed with git ls-files you can use git ls-files . -co --exclude-standard.\nBut to call the fallback command directly, use this instead:\nvim\ncom! -n=? -com=dir MyCtrlPFallback\n    \\ cal ctrlp#init(0, { 'dir': <q-args>, 'opts': { 'user_command': 'find %s -type f' } })\n. Yes, ctrlp has some default ignore rules. If you want it to ignore something specific, you can use wildignore or g:ctrlp_custom_ignore or both.\n. ctrlp supports user-created extensions, so anyone knowing a bit of Vimscript will be able to write this. Take a look at the extensions branch and also :help ctrlp-extensions.\n. You can mark the bookmarks with <c-z> then press <F7> to delete them. This is mentioned twice in the docs, once in the ctrlp-mappings section, and once in the ctrlp-extensions section.\n. It may be that the cache location isn't writable in your new setup. By default, it's set at $HOME/.cache/ctrlp, you may have changed it with the g:ctrlp_cache_dir option. In either case, check this location and make sure you're the owner and have read/write permission to it.\n. What does :echo $XDG_CACHE_HOME return for you? There's no hardcoded base dir, but $XDG_CACHE_HOME is the other default and it's used if it exists.\n. Vim's /pattern has always done the job just fine for me. I'm not sure if a slight improvement will be worth adding this.\n. Neither. I simply want to avoid it being redundant. I'll look into this regardless.\n. @dusans expand(\"%\") is a function call. So the correct syntax is :execute \"CtrlPLine \".expand(\"%\"). But in this case, you can just use :CtrlPLine %.\n. You have to read that description in the context of the whole option. It means ctrlp's local directory is set to the directory of the current file, unless the current file is somewhere inside the current working directory.\nSo which parts do you think are difficult to understand? What do you suggest to make the description clearer?\n. I'm going to leave it as-is. It's not that difficult to understand once you know what each term means by reading the other settings. You need to do that anyway to know what c does, for example.\n. Yes, \"its local working directory\" means ctrlp has its own cwd. This is mentioned right at the top. And \"outside of ctrlp\" doesn't mean \"outside of vim\", it means exactly \"outside of ctrlp\". So the cwd used here is the non-ctrlp cwd.\n. I'd love to. I just honestly don't see how I can make this part any clearer. As in I don't know how. And since no one else has complaint in the past one year and a half, I'm inclined to believe that the majority of people understand it just fine.\n. My English isn't very good. If anyone cares enough to make any part of the help better, no matter how little, please go ahead and do so. Pull requests are always most welcome.\n. This will create a <c-@> mapping which you can use to toggle mruf_relative while in the prompt:\n``` vim\nlet g:ctrlp_buffer_func = {\n    \\ 'enter': 'PrtEnFunc',\n    \\ }\nfunc! PrtEnFunc()\n    nnoremap   c-@ :call ToggleMRURelative()\nendfunc\nfunc! ToggleMRURelative()\n    let g:ctrlp_mruf_relative = !g:ctrlp_mruf_relative\n    call ctrlp#call('s:Reset', {})\n    call ctrlp#call('s:PrtClearCache')\nendfunc\n```\nI'm still undecided about adding this in, and the most I'll probably add is the ToggleMRURelative function.\n. I've already made the change, just haven't merged it. Also, that snippet is supposed to go into .vimrc, so you can choose the key and use it in any case.\n. Crashes like that are usually caused by problems in the environment or bugs in Vim itself. Your best bet is to keep updating Vim and avoid using this setup. :Ggrep is also a third party command. Plus, see tpope/vim-fugitive#306.\n. That already exists. You can use ; in filename mode to filter the directories in front of the filename.\n. Oh I'm sorry, what you're proposing is a bit different. It's indeed nice to have. I'll look into improving the existing ;.\n. > maybe we can mark this somewhere in the help file.\nIt's mentioned in the help file, actually, under the ctrlp-input-formats section.\n. They are actually pretty much self-explanatory and extremely obvious once you do something that changes them. You don't really need to care what they indicate from the start (or at all) so I don't think documentation is necessary.\n. Yes, that's correct. The \"ring\" rotates when you use <c-f> or <c-b>. And prt changes when you use <s-tab>. It might be nice to have all these explained throughout but it's really not necessary. You don't need to understand them to use anything, and your first guesses are most probably correct.\n. Nothing unless you know what you're using <s-tab> for.\n. I can see that there's always someone who finds it confusing, at least at first.\nBut I also don't think it's worth documented. You don't need to understand the statusline to do anything. Plus the help is already long as it is, people barely read it.\n@jsit they aren't tabs because there are more than 3 extensions. And you'll see what <-> is once you use the feature that changes it.\n\nIs there an option to define the separator characters? I looked but didn't see one\n\nWell, you can create your own statusline with g:ctrlp_status_func. Change everything if you feel like doing so.\n. @lsiden using an option (g:ctrlp_status_func) to customize the statusline is a bit different from forking and making change directly to the code. The former is what I am saying and mean.\nWhy do you think there's an option in the first place? Why don't I just not add it and tell everyone to fork the project, like you're saying? The option is there precisely because I figured some people would want to change the statusline, that whatever I chose wouldn't satisfy everyone.\n@jsit is for aesthetic good enough a reason? Because that was the reason the <prev>={current}=<next> was chosen.\n. @lsiden I don't think I'm being sarcastic(?). I always try to be matter of fact with my responses. I don't speak English natively, nor as a secondary language, so I'm sorry if somehow I gave off the wrong tone.\n. Not exactly what this option is for, but you can use g:ctrlp_abbrev to make hyphens be read as underscores:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_abbrev = {\n    \\ 'abbrevs': [\n        \\ {\n        \\ 'pattern': '-',\n        \\ 'expanded': '_',\n        \\ 'mode': 'pfrz',\n        \\ },\n        \\ ]\n    \\ }\nCheck the docs if you want to know more about this option.\n. Have you looked into the options? What do you think of g:ctrlp_use_caching and g:ctrlp_clear_cache_on_exit?\n. Ok, closing. It seems you primarily just want to keep the cache file after exiting Vim. You can already tell ctrlp to do that, and you can also delete/update the cache whenever you like from both outside and inside of ctrlp.\n. No, it's not possible with ctrlp, but you can tell Vim to delete (or delist) a buffer when it's hidden:\nvim\nau BufRead * setl bufhidden=delete\nThose buffers will then only show up when you run :ls!.\nOtherwise, what do you think about tagging the active buffers (probably with an a like :ls does)?\n. You can remove all MRU files outside the project with g:ctrlp_mruf_relative. Mixed mode will then effectively only show files and buffers.\n. Well, there are good, full featured plugins for managing buffers, so why build it into ctrlp? But people keep requesting this from time to time, I think I may just add it. There's also a .vimrc snippet which you can use right now, in #280.\n. Mixed mode basically loads all three File, Buffer, and MRU modes and the mixing also takes some more time. So naturally, it's slower than each of the modes.\nAnyway, buffer deletion may take a while since there are a few things I want to do first. I've also been a bit busy lately. If you don't want to wait, you can just create a mapping to delete a buffer in Buffer mode. All you have to do is grabbing the buffer name from the current line.\n. You can mark multiple files with <c-z>. So instead of opening each file, mark them both then press <c-v>.\nOtherwise, I think it's best to do this outside of ctrlp. Try creating an autocmd or a mapping that opens the spec file of the current file in a new vsplit.\n. No, it'd require reformatting the tag lines or at least the results. Tags files are sometimes quite large so the matching is slow already. I don't really want to bog it down by unnecessary reformatting.\n. This isn't a problem with CamelCase. It's because of ctrlp limiting the number of matches (which is exactly the max_height). This is something I can't fix without further slowing down the internal matching.\nSo if it annoys you too much, you should look into using g:ctrlp_match_func. Otherwise, try toggling regex or filename mode when the file you're looking for doesn't appear.\n. Yes, and there are already a few scripts/extensions written for match_func by other people. burke/matcher in C and at least 2 others in Python if I remember correctly.\n. Those don't mean much without the circumstances of how you get them or at least the Line numbers. I also can't reproduce it. So if it happens consistently, please narrow it down and provide steps to reproduce.\n. That's because you don't escape ~ in the pattern you use for ctrlp_custom_ignore. In Vim, when used in a pattern, ~ matches the last given substitute string.\n. Using ctrlp just for that is kind of inefficient, but if you insist, try something like this:\n``` vim\nlet g:ctrlp_regexp = 1\nlet g:ctrlp_by_filename = 1\ncom! A cal feedkeys(\":CtrlP .\\\".expand('%:t:r').\".\".( expand('%:e') == 'h' ? 'cc' : 'h' ).\"\\\", \"t\")\n```\n. It really won't be simple. Everything is centered around the prompt since it was the first piece that I started writing ctrlp on. And what you're looking for is basically a way to bypass this prompt.\nAnyway, how about saving the two variables (if they exist) and then reset them to their previous values after the feedkeys call? You can put all this into a function and call it with :A instead of calling feedkeys.\n. See :h laststatus.\n. You can use g:ctrlp_buffer_func to set laststatus locally to the ctrlp buffer. Just set it to 0 when entering and back to your default when exiting.\n. Did you use something like this?\n``` vim\nlet g:ctrlp_buffer_func = {\n    \\ 'enter': 'Function_Name_1',\n    \\ 'exit':  'Function_Name_2',\n    \\ }\nfunc! Function_Name_1()\n    set laststatus=0\nendfunc\nfunc! Function_Name_2()\n    set laststatus=2\nendfunc\n``\n. Then there's no other way.laststatusis the only option.\n. A few problems I can see now:\n1. Migrating/Invalidating the old cache files after changing the setting.\n2. Appending the file's path when putting the parts together. E.g.subdir/file->path/to/subdir/file.\n. You'll need to have ctags installed and then set the location of the binary withg:ctrlp_buftag_ctags_bin. After that, you can run:CtrlPBufTagfrom Vim's command line to start ctrlp in buffer-tag mode. If you don't know how to do these things, just search around the web and do some reading until you do.\n. No, it's not possible. Also, the cache dir is used for not only File mode but other things as well, like MRU, prompt history, logs, other extensions... Separating these will require some pretty big changes. So what's your standard situation? And how would this help?\n. Yes, you can refresh cache for each project or directory by simply pressingin ctrlp when searching in that project.:CtrlPClearCachedoes something similar. You don't have to, and shouldn't use:CtrlPClearAllCachesall the time.\n. That means you already set it before somewhere and in a different var type. Just:unletit before setting it again.\n. It's a limitation of the internal matching written in Vimscript. There's an old discussion about this exact issue in #110. Filename and regex modes can be used as quick workarounds, otherwise you can tryg:ctrlp_match_func.\n. You're not supposed to be able to do that. When you paste that way, the text goes directly into the buffer making up the match window, which is non-modifiable. The prompt (where you want to paste into) is a pseudo prompt and you can only enter input into it through designated mappings. You can find the mappings for pasting at:h ctrlp-pasting.\n. It's because` is mapped to inputting \\ into the prompt. If you want to map something in ctrlp, use one starting with a modifier key (ctrl, shift, etc).\n. Mixed mode starts up slower. Changing a default also potentially forces a lot people to have to adjust their config. I generally only consider a change if it helps speed things up, avoid confusions, or is otherwise really necessary.\n. I'm aware of this but have always thought it's only a minor inconvenient, since you can quickly toggle by_filename with <c-d>. by_filename also dictates quite a few things, so I'll have to see if I can reasonably separate it.\n. Yes, it's like Shougo said, ctrlp only operates in Normal mode and j, k are already used for inputting j k.\n. Depending on where you place a mapping, it may be overwritten by another mapping or sometimes re-encoded, thus is lost. In this case, it's because Vim can't tell <c-s-...> and <c-...> apart, so they overwrite each other whenever one is defined. <c-p> is already used by ctrlp as the default mapping and loaded after .vimrc.\n. See :h g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings.\n. There should be documentation on how to write the custom glob function. But mostly this doesn't seem to fit in with the other g:ctrlp_user_command settings, replacing a function as opposed to running a command with system().\n. It's because Vim's new regexp engine is still being worked on.\nIf you search for new regexp engine: in this file: ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/patches/7.3/README , you'll find entries for bugs like only accepts up to \\{,10} Attempts to match \"^\" at every character, and a lot of {expression} not supported.\nIt's unreasonable to try to account for all of those bugs. You should use a slightly older version (~ 7.3.900) and wait until the new engine is stable to update Vim.\n. Reported to the dev mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/vim_dev/4L7p28MYIX0\n. @rene-aguirre what particular error did you run into? I haven't noticed anything else since 7.3.1223.\n. That sounds like it's the same error in OP.\n. @zdm that's an unrelated error that I don't think has much to do with ctrlp, or with the new regexp engine. See #248. Line 15 of BuildPrompt() is a :redraw command. So it's just as likely to occur at any random time you use :redraw anywhere.\n. Fixed in 53f3b2b.\n. It can't work with that. For example, with these entries:\nparent/submodule\nparent/submodule/.git\nparent/submodule/subdir\nThe pattern only matches the entry that has .git, so only the .git dir itself and everything under it are ignored.\n. Closing. This is impossible without specifying the submodule dirs.\n. Change it to a key that you know works to make sure PrtClearCache() is actually called. Also, you don't need to edit autoload/ctrlp.vim, there's an option for changing the mappings.\nSo try this, for example:\nvim\n  let g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings = {\n    \\ 'ToggleRegex()':        ['<F5>'],\n    \\ 'PrtClearCache()':      ['<c-r>'],\n    \\ }\n. From what you describe, it looks like <F5> is being intercepted before Vim and Vim is interpreting an escape sequence as multiple keypresses.\n. Closing. This is almost definitely an issue with your term config, and not anything vimscript.\nEven when you don't map <F5> (ctrlp was the last place), pressing <F5> still does just about the same thing, and which is distinctive to an escape sequence: ctrlp is closed and then a seemingly random action is performed.\n. So I completely forgot about <esc> being mapped can cause this. See #432. Also, since <F5> has never been reported before, it looks like your terminal may be doing something unusual, e.g. sending extra escape sequences.\n. Duplicate of this request #350.\n. If using mappings isn't ideal for you, you can try using local .vimrc, or .lvimrc as some people call it. But for setting a one-time value, you need to call the init function directly:\nvim\ncall ctrlp#init(0, { 'mode': 'ra' })\n. Closing. Specifying it when calling init() gives enough flexibility, I think.\n. It's because it's rather complicated to make the highlighting always work perfectly for the non-path types. So for now only 'path' is supported.\n. Yes, it's on my todo list for ctrlp. I'll definitely implement it, once things are figured out.\n. Yes, it's like Shougo said. And it only happens in the ctrlp buffer because the <esc> mapping is buffer local. To solve your problem, you can either try a different &term, or remove the <esc> mapping with the following setting, there's no other way:\nvim\n  let g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings = {\n    \\ 'PrtExit()': ['<c-c>', '<c-g>'],\n    \\ }\nOtherwise, don't use arrow keys but <c-j> <c-k> to move the selection.\n. See also #209.\n. Then maybe it's because timeoutlen is set to 0 by default. But this is required for the inputting to work. In any case, there's no other options. You can try remapping the moving selection functions to some other keys you can use if using <c-j> <c-k> is somehow not an option.\nAlso, the ctrlp plugin itself doesn't load with compatible set, so the problem shouldn't be reproducible in that setting.\n. Just a thought, but if you can, try setting ttimeoutlen to a non-negative number (e.g. 100) so that you'll have different delays for key codes (100) and mappings (0).\n. Reproducible. I'll push a fix out soon.\n. That's impossible. The prompt is created with command line's output and Vim's command line can't be moved.\n. In a larger sense, yes, anything is possible. What I mean is that it's impossible with the way ctrlp operates now which is only in Normal mode. I'd have to change to a completely different inputting method, and rewrite much of ctrlp's core, just so the input prompt could be moved to the top along with the match window.\nAlso, ctrlp's interface is directly based on cmd-t's and lusty explorer's, in both of these you can't move the input prompt. Only in plugins that use Insert mode for inputting, the input prompt can be moved. Again, I mean among the plugins that I know of.\n. It is possible. See :h ctrlp-input-formats.\n. No, there isn't since ctrlp isn't based on fuzzyfinder. Recursive is more desirable than single directory search which isn't much better than <tab> completion with :e, which in turn is similar to how filename completion works in the shell.\n. Since you mention it, if I was happy with unite back then, ctrlp would have never been released or even started. It's a good thing that unite has improved a lot and now has many features ctrlp has. And I mean that. I'll switch to a different plugin or a different editor myself, if it better suits my needs.\n. That's a custom statusline created by powerline (a Vim plugin), not ctrlp's default statusline. You'll have to look into powerline's documentation and themes if you want to change those colors.\n. By default, g:ctrlp_custom_ignore doesn't get applied when you use g:ctrlp_user_command. You can check the notes under :h g:ctrlp_user_command for more details.\n. There's an option for this: g:ctrlp_buftag_types.\n. I see. I didn't realize it's supported by ctags.\n. See #443.\n. That doesn't have anything to do with ctrlp or the ctrlp repo. Check your local setup, you're referring to a nonexistent commit.\n. @aufula You can try turning on g:ctrlp_key_loop and see if it works with your input method. If it doesn't then there's no other way, since each character need to be mapped in Normal mode.\n. You can try setting a bigger max height for the match window to get more results, and/or toggle regexp mode for exact matching. As long as the some_file.ext is found, it's placed first.\n. It's intended. You're not supposed to be able to scroll pass what is on the list. You can increase the max height of the match window if you want more results.\n. Because it's faster to list exactly the number of results needed to fill the window, than list more but they aren't visible and you have to scroll to see them.\n. Then just increase the max height. There's little difference, I'm not sure it's worth a new setting.\n. I can't see the images. Can you re-upload them somewhere else?\n. Also, running :syntax on doesn't change anything for me.\n. I see. It's still not reproducible. Can you simplify your config and find whatever that contributes to this? Also, what ctrlp version are you using? What's your Vim version? Does it happen when you run :syntax enable? What happens if you have this in your .vimrc?\nvim\nhi CtrlPLinePre guifg=red ctermfg=red\nThe highlight group for the > char is CtrlPLinePre, which by default uses your colorscheme's Normal group's background color as its foreground color.\n. OK, I think I found the cause. It's the :hi clear line that many colorschemes have. I use a modified, stripped down version of molokai which doesn't have that line, so even in minimum config, the issue didn't manifest.\n. It's not easy to avoid Vim's :tselect menu when using :tjump, since it's the default and the only behavior.\nI'm going to need you to provide a test case including the tag names, the filenames corresponding to the tags. Also, the 3 tags files and their relative locations.\nWhat do you mean by \"set currently searched string\"? Replacing :tjump would be even more complicated than avoiding :tselect.\n. The feedkeys() is only run once when you're done searching and are jumping to the tag. It's needed for respecting fold options. But what does it have anything to do with replacing :tj? And what do you consider smarter?\n. Oh I see. You can pass whole strings into the prompt with g:ctrlp_default_input.\n. It looks like there's no way to get the correct counts for use in :[count]tag. They desync with the counts on the menu as soon as there are 2 duplicates of the same tag in the active buffer. No way to recalculate and Vim doesn't provide any kind of reference.\nThis means using the :tselect menu in this case is unavoidable, but it's possible to enter the number for this menu automatically.\n. It's already doing that. But as I said, those numbers easily become unusable for :[count]tag.\n. That still has the desyncing problem, I think.\n. You mean you want it to highlight only the individual characters, not the entire matched string? This won't be simple since the matching is done with match() which only returns the first position.\n. It certainly does. Please go ahead with the pull request.\nThanks!\n. @aaronjensen some main functions in ctrlp are called with sil! to make it a bit more invisible/unobtrusive. So you may have to track down and remove a few of those instances for the messages to appear.\n. No, don't worry about that just yet.\n. There isn't such a function built in. But you can modify this. Just replace the exe 'lc!' with a return.\n. By default, buffers with buftype=nofile are avoided because they are often used by plugins to display information. You can control this behavior with g:ctrlp_reuse_window.\n. @Wolfy87 That option doesn't work like that. See :h g:ctrlp_reuse_window.\n. Yes, just enable g:ctrlp_mruf_relative.\n. Looks like you have data ignored with custom_ignore in your .vimrc here. If you want to keep that ignore rule, try something like \\(mnt/\\)\\@<!data.\n. That can potentially increase startup time exponentially with the number of buffers. Each buffer has to be compared with the others every time Buffer mode is used and the buffer list has been changed.\n. That will just add the extra step of generating the hash keys on top of everything. The comparison can simply be done directly with the tail.\nThe small number of non-uniques also isn't the issue. It's having to walk through the list to compare and find them, especially on the first time Buffer mode is open (all buffers are new), or on a subsequent opening when any number of buffers might have been added/removed/renamed.\n. I wrote this in my last attempt at shortening bufnames, which should explain my reluctance. It's basically something like that versus looping through the list once with fnamemodify().\n. No, ctrlp is a finder, there's no option to show all files. You have to search and narrow down the results.\n. If you don't want to touch the options, just create a mapping for :CtrlP ..\n. No, it's not possible because of the way the prompt is built.\n. This is intentional. Unlisted buffers and buffers with non-empty buftype (help, quickfix, etc) aren't included in the listing to reduce cluster. Not sure if I want to change that.\n. ctrlp has its own buffer-local mappings. Take a look at g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings if you want to change them.\n. Changing an option name will break people's config. I try to avoid it unless it's really necessary. This seems too arbitrary to warrant a change. Besides, it's not going to work anyway since the var type is not supported. It's a List, while session can only store String and Number types.\n. wildignore does get applied unless you're using g:ctrlp_user_command without setting the ignore key to 1.\n. That's really odd. wildignore only gets applied when indexing a directory. If the files are listed in the cache file then they can definitely be found in vim. Also, try this syntax for ignoring a directory set wildignore+=*/build/*.\n. Yes, you can change them with g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings.\n. I'm going to need more details. What's your config for ctrlp? What happens if you set g:ctrlp_max_files to 0, then run ctrlp and clear the cache with <F5>? What happens if you reset wildignore with :set wildignore&? Does this problem happen with any directory other than your project?\n. Without more informations, it seems to be because you've reached the max_files limit (default is 10000). You can try either setting it to a bigger number, or to 0 which means no limit. There are maybe too many files in the first few levels of directories in your project.\n. That's definitely max_files. It's ignored when the commands in user_command are being used. So if you want to make sure this problem doesn't happen when you aren't in a git repo, just set g:ctrlp_max_files to a bigger number or to 0.\n. g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings is the option for that. If you search for mappings in the help, you should find it mentioned quite a few times.\n. Does (or did) airline detect the present of ctrlp? If the ctrlp.vim script wasn't even loaded, then it probably wasn't its fault if something in airline didn't load as a result. Also, the welcome info can be cleared by changes to the statusline.\n. Removing on demand is currently not possible. But if the current buffer isn't supported, you can simply leave the result list empty. I don't see why the extension has to be removed. Take buffertag.vim for an example, there's no harm leaving it there when the buffer has a FileType not supported by ctags.\n. I think so, yes. And you can change the labels right from your extension's init function. They aren't used until after the result list has been populated. So first find the Dictionary defining the extension in g:ctrlp_ext_vars, then change the values of the naming keys.\n. 10 is just the default number of results in the match window. It'll show you different files once you start searching. So just type in a few characters of the file you want to search for.\n. This isn't what it is for, but yes, you can get that by setting g:ctrlp_mruf_relative to 1.\n. No, there isn't such a shortcut. If you really want that, try using feedkeys() in a mapping to do the <c-z> and <c-o> steps automatically. Check out g:ctrlp_buffer_func.\n. No, when you use user_command, wildignore and custom_ignore are not applied by default.\nCan you explain what you mean by \"assign some directories to index directory\"? Currently, you can only specify one directory tree with :CtrlP. There's not yet a way to specify multiple directory trees.\n. Well, for now, you can either use some clever ignore rules (try negative-lookahead) to ignore everything else, or setup some mappings that each open ctrlp for a specific subdir.\nThere's already a feature request for supporting multiple starting directories, so I'm going to close this.\n. I think I prefer to keep ctrlp as a finder. If you want to use only the opening mechanism, try using Vim's feedkeys(). Also, take a look here.\n. Yes, this is simply because <esc> is mapped, so it can't really be fixed. But there are some ways to workaround, you can check #432 and #209.\nAlternatively, don't use arrow keys to navigate but <c-j>, <c-k>, etc.\n. This is because ctrlp only lists the first results found. That is if the foo.file is indexed and cached. You can solve this by toggling either filename or regexp modes with <c-d> <c-r>, or increase the max result or max height values.\n. Make sure the file is indexed. Set max_files to 0. Also toggle both filename and regexp modes, use something like ^foo.file. If the file is indexed, then it can be found.\nBTW, max result doesn't work like max_files. Setting max result to 0 only sets it to 1.\n. The selection is a cursorline. So it's Solarized that has a cursorline color too similar to the background color. You'll have to redefine the CursorLine color group, either in .vimrc or in the colorscheme.\n. For the first question, use :CtrlP path where you can only specify one directory path at a time. For the second question, there's a Most Recently Used (MRU) mode that remembers the files you've opened. For more details, check out :h :CtrlP, :h ctrlp_working_path, :h :CtrlPMRU, and :h ctrlp_mruf.\n. If you use vim-airline, you'll have to change the statusline colors through the plugin somehow. For the non-statusline colors, then use .vimrc and/or the colorscheme.\n. That's one of the main purposes of the feature. It wouldn't be useful if the command wasn't used as soon as the user :cds into a subdir of their project because they had path_mode disabled for different reasons.\nSince you have a .git repo you want to be treated differently, I suggest putting a local .vimrc there to disable the user_command option.\n. Put it once, in the same directory as the .git dir. Just have a check for the cwd. If the cwd is a subdir, disable the option. An autocmd works, too, if you want this for every project.\nWhat you favor against is one of the things that make this feature worthwhile. Since the feature is basically \"using this custom listing command in this particular directory\".\n. Thank you! I'll check it out as soon as I can. It may be in a while, though, since I've been incredibly busy lately.\n. @kdurant I haven't been able to check it out yet. Plus it's still a work-in-progress.\n. It's already possible. Check out g:ctrlp_abbrev. Just expand _ or \\ to an empty string.\n. No, it's not always needed. You can prevent it from being called by setting g:ctrlp_clear_cache_on_exit to 0.\n. Can you provide steps to reproduce the error? Does updating Vim help? It looks like the parser confuses the colons in the Dictionary with operators.\n. Thanks! I can't reproduce it in Vim 7.1.0 to 7.4.0, but in 7.0.0. Looks like it's an old bug with the parser when Dictionary was new. I use ternary operators often, however, so I may have to change a few other places as well.\n. Natively, you can try g:ctrlp_lazy_update which should alleviate it somewhat. Otherwise, you'll want to look into using external, non-vimscript matchers through g:ctrlp_match_func. There are a few around.\n. That'd be the proper way, I think.\n. You can set either hidden, autowrite, autowriteall, or confirm. If none of these options is set, commands that replace the current unsaved buffer will fail with an error. To avoid this, ctrlp opens a new split.\n. Can you get the full error message, especially the error code, and provide steps to reproduce? Include details like which mode you're in, the filename you're trying to open, the current working directory, etc. Also, try starting Vim with as less configuration as possible, ideally with only ctrlp.\n. Thanks! You get those errors because you've either set debug=msg or debug=throw somewhere in your Vim config. When not set, bufnr() returns -1 when no such buffer exists, and the error is omitted. Similarly with expand().\n. Yes, creating a new file in a vertical split is the default. You can change it with g:ctrlp_open_new_file.\n. Yes, matching is plugin-wide so you can't define a matcher for a specific mode or extension. But it does sound like something good to have.\n. No, highlighting of match is only supported in extensions that list filenames. I may try to extend it after #488.\nThis is the same request/issue as #431.\n. Do the splits have open files? What are their filetypes? If possible, can you provide those files as well?\nIt may have something to do with syntax highlighting being slow in Vim in general, and BuildPrompt() running redraw.\n. Glad you've solved it. Also, it's worth noting that syntax highlighting performance can otherwise be improved by setting a small synmaxcol, and small minlines maxlines for :syntax sync.\n. Yes, there is, by setting g:ctrlp_mruf_relative. For more MRU options, you can search for ctrlp_mruf in the docs.\n. I think I'll prefer keeping the cursor visible, since the cursorline by itself is sometimes pretty hard to see.\n. Actually, ctrlp's cursorline is Vim's default, enabled by set cursorline in the ctrlp window. And I still think the default cursor being visible is generally a good thing.\n. Yes, I understand you mean that cursor. What I'm trying to say is that it helps seeing the selected entry when the cursorline is hard to see. But hiding it when keyloop = 1 is fine.\n. Yes, when in the ctrlp prompt, you can press <c-\\> then press f to choose c[f]ile.\n. It's an intended behavior of Mixed mode. All mru files and buffers that are in the cwd as the regular files are filtered out to avoid duplicates. So if that mru file also shows up in Files mode, it'll show up in Mixed mode.\nThe reason the buffer and mru filter isn't run against the full files list from Files mode is because the list is often big enough to significantly slow down the mixing.\n. 1) It's in a hidden directory (.config), so for it to show up in Files mode, you need to at least set ctrlp_show_hidden.\n2) It's the step that determines whether or not a file has duplicates that is slow, i.e. comparing the buffer, mru and file lists.\n. By default, hidden files and hidden dirs (dotfiles and dotdirs) aren't listed. So if it shows up on your other laptop then there's something different. Also, in a subdir or not, it's still under the cwd.\n. Doing it the expected way isn't any more complicated, but as usual I have to choose between that and speed with some rough edges. If I have time, though, I'll probably rewrite Mixed mode and make it more flexible.\n. This is great. Thank you!\nAs for the filename, I'm not sure what the language code for Chinese is. If it's \"cn\" then the filename should be ctrlp.cnx.\n. You can set either hidden, autowrite, autowriteall, or confirm. But I think I should also try making this part a bit smarter. Those options shouldn't have to be set when working with the current buffer.\n. CtrlP has a feature that by default will zoom into the directory of the current file if the cwd is different. When you open file1_dir1.txt in links/dir1/, Vim will instead load the file1_dir1.txt file in nolinks/dir1/. The directory of the current file will then be nolinks/dir1/, while the cwd is still links.\nSo disabling the aforementioned feature with g:ctrlp_working_path_mode will solve your issue.\n. May I ask you to provide steps to reproduce? Also, what's your Vim version? Have you tried with minimal configuration (i.e. only CtrlP installed)? There's no freezing nor even any delay for me when I try opening a file this way.\n. Does it happen consistently?\nAs for starting Vim with minimal config, run:\nvim --noplugin -u path/to/a/.vimrc\nContent of this .vimrc:\nvim\nset nocp\nset runtimepath^=~/.vim/bundle/ctrlp.vim\nruntime! plugin/ctrlp.vim\nWith ~/.vim/bundle/ctrlp.vim a clone of the ctrlp.vim repo.\n. I still can't reproduce it, with or without tmux. And I doubt there's much I can do anyway with ctrlp being a vim script bound to Vim. The search window is basically a buffer named ControlP in a horizontal split with a few local mappings.\nI think I'm going to close this as it doesn't seem to worth the effort tracking down. With only 2-3 times, it's simpler to just avoid triggering it.\n. <c-c> is one of the default mappings to close ctrlp. To create new file, use <c-y>.\nYou might want to check out :h ctrlp-mappings as well, for the other available mappings.\n. You're not supposed to touch g:syntax_on, it's Vim's job to set/unset it whenever you run :syntax on/off/enable. Forcing the variable on while syntax is actually off will throw syntax highlighting detection off, and likely cause unexpected behaviors. So try removing the second line.\n. CtrlP doesn't do anything font-related. But those lines look like the cursorline, just multiple of it. You can test by setting cursorline in the other buffer.\nThe only thing I can think of here is to try changing Vim's linespace option, or terminal.app's equivalent. And if nothing else works, I guess you might just have to use a different font.\n. Ok I'm closing this. I doubt there's anything reasonable that I can do from CtrlP here, since this is font and term specific.\n. I believe this feature already exists. You can press <c-o>a to mark all files in the match window.\n. Yes, <c-o>c.\n. Sorry I forgot, g:ctrlp_arg_map needs to be set as well to enable the additional choices.\n. Can you clarify point 1? What seems to be a bug? Toggle the marking is what <c-z> is supposed to do.\nAs for point 2, it's a good point. I'll look into adding it. I didn't think anyone would use <c-o>a all that much so it's still rather basic.\n. 2.1 doesn't happen to me. The markings are just Vim's signs.\n. This looks great. But how does it interact with CtrlP's existing tab-completion? Also, since they are closely resemble, is merging them feasible?\n. @axelson see :h ctrlp-autocompletion. You need to type something first.\n. It's not supposed to. CtrlPLine helps you jump to a line in a file you're actively working on, not to a line anywhere. This also provides a mean to exclude some buffers, and is similar to Vim's :bufdo in that it only works on listed buffers.\n. You're misinterpreting the log. The clock column (first column) is recorded when the operations finish. You should look at the second column if you want to know how long each operation takes. So utils.vim's load time is only 0.433 ms. It's the \"BufEnter autocommands\" that is taking close to 1s (878.612 ms).\n. The a, d, and x choices are already mentioned under the mapping help section. The x again under its option. I just don't feel like they are practical enough to be shown in the inline help, which I want to keep a little less busy.\n. What does this have to do with ignoring results from submodules with custom_ignore? s:findroot() is only for finding a cwd. So if this change works, it'll only prevent submodules from being used as a cwd. Is that what you want?\nBut I don't think this is something that should be enforced and hard-coded in. If you want the superproject to always be the root, just use the .gitmodules or any other file as the root marker. Check out g:ctrlp_root_markers.\n. After a closer look, I think this not only won't work (aren't folder and directory the same thing?), and won't \"fix\" #427 (which doesn't need fixing), but will also break root finding for people who want to use a file as the root marker.\n. MiddleMouse is mapped to pasting from the clipboard register + by default. Not sure if I want to change it to *. See :h quoteplus and :h 'clipboard'.\nThat aside, PrtInsert() only accepts few certain arguments, not just any random string. And 'MiddleMouse' should be '<MiddleMouse>'.\nBut being able to specify the register there with PrtInsert() would be nice. I think I might add it.\n. The command is run with Vim's system(). Your user_command also works fine for me on Windows. If it only just stopped working, then it's probably something in your environment that changed.\nClosing this as I don't think it is something I can fix from CtrlP.\n. The only difference in CtrlP is the argument for --git-dir being passed through shellescape() first with &ssl off. But even with shellescape() removed and &ssl on, just the system() call it still works fine for me.\nYou can try testing with a clean Vim configuration, different paths and cwds. And if nothing else works, try specifying the full path to git.exe like this: '\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\bin\\git.exe\" --git-dir=%s/.git ls-files'.\n. I can't reproduce this. The file count goes down when I add more entries into either wildignore or custom_ignore.\nDoes turning off follow_symlinks change anything for you? You can do a simple test to see if those extra files are from vendor by temporarily moving vendor out of zeus.\nAnyway, CtrlP relies completely on Vim's globpath() for the indexing. You have vendor in wildignore, so globpath() should ignore it entirely. However, custom_ignore can only be applied after globpath() has finished indexing. So if globpath() is already slowed down by indexing all those files, there's no helping it.\n. There's probably a symlink pointing to directory outside.\n. If you're already in the home directory, typing the extra ~/ will show you a NO ENTRIES message, because ~/~/.vimrc doesn't exist. And if you keep trying to open it, CtrlP will attempt to create the file including the path to it.\nI guess the same thing happens with those symbols, there are no files with them in their names.\nI don't think I should add workarounds to prevent cases like this. The NO ENTRIES is very apparent. Someone could make a typo, or type <c-y> by mistake, or any other things. I don't think they should or could be prevented.\n. Does setting g:ctrlp_key_loop change anything? It sounds like tilde and grave are used as \"dead key\" modifiers on your Linux setup, to produce characters like \u00e0 \u00e3.\n. It's because you're using CtrlPMixed which includes files, buffers, and MRU files. The /etc/hosts entry you see is a MRU entry.\n. No, :CtrlP only shows files.\nTo clear MRUs, press <F7> while in MRU mode.\n. How exactly did you do those? Checking if there's only one file then call the accept function right from the init function should do it. If you want to send <cr>, try using feedkey().\n. Actually, I don't think this is possible, at least not yet. The init function is called before the prompt is rendered to properly close it. And there's no other point to accept the file until a selection is made by the user.\n. And if you don't want the file list cached, you can turn that off as well with g:ctrlp_use_caching.\n. You'll probably have more freedom using a local .vimrc for the project, and put the settings there. If you don't want to do that, a simple mapping to :CtrlP ../ should be suffice, I think.\n. There isn't. But this does sound useful. Thanks for the suggestion!\n. BufferTag relies entirely on ctags for the results and hasn't been changed in a while. So check if ctags is installed and working properly on your system.\n. It's just Vimscript being slow when the list is too large. You'll have to employ an external matcher with g:ctrlp_match_func, preferably written in a faster language. Nothing else really helps.\n. The longer the search string is, the further down the file list the matcher has to dig for results. Over 100k entries is a lot for a List. As said in the other issue, you'll have to use an external matcher written in a more suitable language. There are at least a few of these matchers around, last time I looked.\n. It's probably the root finding feature. You can try turning it off with g:ctrlp_working_path_mode.\n. The root finding/zooming feature is the only thing that interacts with the file system when starting in Buffer mode. In File mode, the sorting compares modified times, so it also interacts with the file system regardless of the file list being cached.\n. You can call s:PrtClearCache() with ctrlp#call({name} [, {args}]). Or just simulate <F5> with Vim's feedkeys(). The extension's init will be called again.\n. It's preserved by default, unless nolim is set to 1 in the extension.\n. You can get it by setting g:ctrlp_by_filename to 1.\n. You've probably reached the max_files limit. The default value is 15000.\n. It's because the CtrlP buffer is opened with :noautocmd, mostly to avoid issues with plugins that do things when autocmds are triggered.\nI also use UltiSnips frequently but haven't run into that. I use an older copy from last year, not sure which revision or version.\n. There were actually some old issues with plugins changing things expecting the match window to be a regular buffer. It's why I want it to be more invisible.\nHow about adding a check for the correct buffer before running the iunmap's? Someone may use :noautocmd or eventignore anytime and change to a different buffer, which will raise the same errors from UltiSnips.\n. It's because you're setting prompt_mappings in buffer_func, and for when CtrlP is about to close.\nJust move the first prompt_mappings setting out of MyPrtMappings() and remove the buffer_func line. Or if you use MyPrtMappings() elsewhere, then just call MyPrtMappings() directly.\n. OK, I added this to the dev branch, check it out: https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/tree/develop\nLet me know if you find any problem.\n. Sorry, I don't think I understand what you're trying to say here. <up> and <down> should move the selection up and down in the match window. Does <down> behave differently for you?\n. Yes, I got it  (Github removed the <up> and <down> in your comment). As for the bug, the <up> and <down> mappings are basically just this:\nvim\nnnoremap <buffer> <silent> <up> k\nnnoremap <buffer> <silent> <down> j\nI'm guessing something in your setup changes this. You might be able to track it down with maparg() and mapcheck(), but if you just want to avoid <up> and <down> you can add this to your .vimrc, and ctrlp won't touch these 2 keys:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings = {\n    \\ 'PrtSelectMove(\"j\")': ['<c-n>', '<c-j>'],\n    \\ 'PrtSelectMove(\"k\")': ['<c-p>', '<c-k>'],\n    \\ }\n. Thanks Juan, looks like this is a problem with ncurses on OSX 10.6.3:\n\nInstead of their proper action, they all quit the program and printed -respectively- \u201cOA\u201d, \u201cOB\u201d, \u201cOC\u201d and \u201cOD\u201d on the stdout.\nhttp://www.uponmyshoulder.com/blog/2010/os-x-10-6-3-broke-ncurses/\n\nAnd using those keys in Vim will just enter insert mode and insert A, B, C, D.\nSo I'm not sure if I should try to find a work-around for that and include it in the plugin.\n. Nope, not hardcoded.\nPlease try this if you guys have time and let me know if it solves the problem for you:\nvim\nif has('mac') || has('macunix')\n    nmap <esc>[A <up>\n    nmap <esc>[B <down>\n    nmap <esc>[C <right>\n    nmap <esc>[D <left>\nendif\nAlso, here's a possible external fix:\n\nGo to your home directory, mine is at /Users/myname/\nOpen your .profile and add TERM=linux at the first line of the file.\nSave and quit\nType source .profile and enter\n\nAnd from the comment:\n\nFor the record, if you find that your .profile file does not exist then just go ahead and create it and it should work fine (it did for me)\n\nSource: http://www.techiecorner.com/140/arrow-key-not-working-in-vi-vim-mac-os/\n. OK, I've pushed a fix to the dev branch: https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/tree/develop\nLet me know if it works.\nThanks!\n. You mean using nnoremap instead of nmap? If it works I'll change it to nnoremap or nn for short.\nUnfortunately, there isn't any other way to fix this except disabling the <esc> key (buffer local) when in terminal.\n. OK I've pushed the latest changes to github, here's the relevant line with nn or nnoremap:\nhttps://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/blob/develop/autoload/ctrlp.vim#L673\n. Alright, I think this is a good enough workaround for this problem with ncurses, aside from doing it outside of Vim, or just not mapping <esc>. I'll go ahead and push this to master.\nIf anyone has any suggestion, feel free to comment.\nThanks everyone!\n. Also, I just want to clear this up, since @sorin-ionescu hinted toward it: this wasn't an issue caused by mapping keys with nmap, all the mappings in this plugin use nnoremap or nn from the get-go.\n. How do you think that? Can you explain how something like this can assume everyone uses a VT term? Honest question because I don't really see why:\nvim\nnn <buffer> <silent> <down> j\nIt's just like your typical vimrc line. And it's basically what this plugin uses for every key.\nAlso, the workaround is this, which applies to both xterm* and VT* terminals:\nvim\n    let lcmap = 'nn <buffer> <silent>'\n    if &term =~? 'xterm' || &term =~? '^vt'\n        for each in ['\\A <up>','\\B <down>','\\C <right>','\\D <left>']\n            exe lcmap.' <esc>['.each\n        endfor\n    endif\n. I'm sorry but that doesn't even make sense, detect what automatically?\nAnd it's really not up to me, this is a known problem with Vim in terminal, and ncurses, a lot of results on Google. Yes, other people have run into it when using arrow keys, and the oldest mention of this I could find was from 2003.\nAlso, as I posted above, I didn't come up with the workaround myself either. This workaround and similar ones, have been around for as long as this issue has existed, many years.\n. After changing wildignore or any setting that can potentially filter the results, you'll need to clear the cache by running :ClearAllCtrlPCaches, or pressing <F5> if you already have ctrp-p opened.\nIf that doesn't work, let me know.\n. OK, this looks like it's because of the glob I use to search for dotfiles which is .*, it seems to ignore wildignore for these directories and files. I don't see a way to fix this without removing the dotfiles search functionality altogether.\nSo for now you'll have to use this instead:\nvim\nset wildignore+=*/.git/objects/*\nI'll make some changes to the docs.\n. Also, thank you for reporting this. I've always had the */ for wildignore in my vimrc and just assumed that it'd work without it.\n. Good idea, thank you! I might as well make this an option for the user to change.\n. This has been added: https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/blob/master/doc/ctrlp.txt#L210\n. Hi,\nCan you record the error messages next time this happens? And the task you're doing with it at the time, and let me know your Vim version, which OS etc...\nAlso, not sure if this helps, but you can try reducing the value of g:ctrlp_max_files, the default is 20000. Then use it like that for a while and see how it goes.\nThanks!\n. Closing this for now as too-vague and possibly-unrelated. Please feel free to reopen if you get more infos on this, and if anyone else has this problem as well.\nThanks!\n. You're right. But so far on Twitter I found only 1 segfault tweet by SteveLosh... and then in a reply someone else said this worked fine for him, assuming both people are on OSX.\nWell, since I can't reproduce this, I doubt I can do much about it. I'll try to reduce the plugin's footprint as much as possible, but that's pretty much it. Just use what you like and what works for you.\n. That's great. Thank you! This just prompted me to check all the type() instances.\n. That sounds like something I might use myself, too. So yes, I'll consider adding it once I have some more free time.\nThanks for the suggestion!\n. This has been added and is on the dev branch: https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/tree/develop\nLet me know what you think.\n. Yep, I thought about clearing the cache automatically as well, but if the parent directory is large this might take too long, and if the user wants to force an update they can just use <F5>. I'll look into adding the new entry to the cache.\nPartial matching of dir names is problematic, I think. e.g. a dir name like data can be matched against existing data, database, mydata or death_note_abc etc... and they all can be anywhere in the dir tree or all at the root, with no way to tell which is the one the user really wants. So if you have an idea for this, let me know.\n. Pushed to master. New entry's added to the cache on-the-fly.\nThank you for the suggestions! Closing for now.\n. It's working for me. It doesn't work if you just execute that in the command line, though. So you'll need to put that into your .vimrc and restart Vim.\nAlso, with the current version, you can now use :ResetCtrlP after changing the options (from the command line) to update them without restarting Vim. You still need to put them into .vimrc if you want to keep them permanently, though.\n. Hi,\nCan you rephrase that? I'm not sure I understand what you mean. But if I get it right, then you need to change the g:ctrlp_persistent_input option. Set it to 0 to clear the value in the input field each time CtrlP is called.\ne.g. add this line to your .vimrc:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_persistent_input = 0\n. I'm sorry, I still don't understand what the problem is.\n\nSo, if I press ctrlp (ctrlp is still active) instead to activate the old one try (giving some errors) to open a new instance.\n\nCtrlP is supposed to close each time you open a file from it, or simply move away from the CtrlP window will trigger it to close. \nDoes it do that for you?\n. That sounds like <esc> isn't working. Can you use <c-c> or <c-g> (CTRL-C or CTRL-G) to close CtrlP?\nAlso, are you using Vim in terminal or are you using gVim/MacVim?\n. What does it show when you run :echo &term from Vim's command line? And what OS are you on?\n. This is a really odd behavior and most likely has something to do with the control sequences in terminal (again). So maybe I'll install iTerm and try something out. But for the mean time, I guess you'll just have to use <c-c> or <c-g> to exit CtrlP.\n. OK, I tried to reproduce this with iTerm 1.0 and Vim 7.2 on Snow Leopard but couldn't; <esc> seemed to work fine in both situations, matches and no matches. I guess there's something else in your setup interfering with the <esc> key.\nSo if you don't mind, can you capture the error message like this?\n1. Run :redir @a (redirect to register a)\n2. Call CtrlP and try to reproduce the error with <esc> and \"no matches\".\n3. Exit CtrlP with <c-c> or <c-g>\n4. Run :redir END\n5. Get the content from register a with \"ap and post it here.\n. Closing this for now as unreproducible and since it's a minor issue.\n. Does BundleInstall work if you set it to set wildignore+=.git/*,.hg/*,.svn/*? (without the preceding */)\n. You mean a history of the strings entered in the prompt?\n. Hmm... I usually only type a few characters (4- 5) to find what I want. So I'm not sure a history of these short strings would be really beneficial. Besides, there's already the g:ctrlp_persistent_input (remember the last string) option.\n. Come to think about it, Vim's command line also has a history which I use quite often. So maybe I'll add this (as a history of accepted input strings) and reassign <c-n> and <c-p> to it, just like the default mappings in the command line.\n. This has been added. Thanks!\n. Hi,\nDoes the problem occur if you don't use symbolic link for dir? Also, can you force close ctrlp using <c-c> or <c-g> when the problem happens?\nAnyway, I'll track this down and try to fix it once I'm little less busy. Thank you for reporting this and providing the infos!\n. Yes, you're correct, I did some tests earlier and noticed that as well. For some reason bufwinnr() returns -1 after using ... The weird thing's that it only does that in Vim 7.2, but not in 7.3 and 7.0.\n. That's awesome! Thank you!\nA simple fix is this, since we kind of need that chdir line now for the .. cmd. Let me know if it works for you:\nvim\nif exists('a:2') || ( bufnum > 0 && bufwinnr(buf) > 0 )\n. Oh I already fixed that in my working version. This should do the trick:\nvim\ntry\n    bun!\ncatch\n    winc c\nendtry\nAnyway, I think there should be a better way to solve the problem with bufwinnr(), since we need that bufwinnr() check to close CtrlP in case an user calls another instance of it while still inside the prompt. I'll try to come up with something once I'm done with some works here.\n. I've pushed a fix to the dev branch: https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/tree/develop\nLet me know how that works for you.\n. Pushed to master. Thank you again for all the help!\n. Looks like the # and % need to be escaped since they are special chars. I've pushed a fix to the dev branch:\nhttps://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/tree/develop\nLet me know if it works for you.\n. This has been pushed to master.\nThank you for reporting!\n. This sounds interesting. I'm not sure how marking the files would work, though. Also, because the listed files are matches of the same pattern, it might not be very useful.\n. I got a few ideas of how this could work but so far all seem pretty clunky. I'll definitely give this a shot, though.\n. Added to the dev branch. Let me know what you think.\nUsage: <c-z> to mark/unmark files, <c-o> to open them.\n. I just went ahead and pushed this to master. Thank you for suggesting this feature!\n. Awesome, thank you for donating time! I'll check it out and see what's best (probably will just integrate it instead of merging).\n. OK, looks like adding a new option for this is a little unnecessary. Also, hg locate returns the paths of the files relative to the repo's root, this will make opening files fail when user is in a subdir of the repo and g:ctrlp_working_path_mode is set to 1. git ls-files seems to work perfectly everywhere.\nI think I'll just add a few lines in the doc for these commands and how to set them up correctly.\nThanks!\n. Using --fullpath with hg locate will return paths with mixed \\ and / on Windows and makes opening files fail. I see your point, though, so I'll definitely try to find a fix for this and make it work.\n. Let me know how this works. Instead of hardcoding the commands, this will allow people to use something other than just hg, git or svn.\n. Sorry about that, I forgot to do a check for a:1 after removing another FindRoot call. Just pushed a fix.\nThank you for reporting!\n. Thank you! I'll add a note to the doc about this.\n. You can put either set autowriteall or set hidden in your vimrc to avoid this issue. There's some more info at :help edit_f. I'll add a warning to ctrlp. Thanks for the heads up!\n. Nope, I just use :hide when opening a file in the same window. The effect is the same as having set hidden.\n. This is actually a feature to prevent opening the same file twice by mistake. I'll add an option to toggle it. Thanks for the heads up!\n. It's g:ctrlp_switch_buffer.\n. That map will clear all caches every time CtrlP starts. If you want that behavior, you can simply put this into your vimrc:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_use_caching = 0\nIt's practically the same.\n. You can use <F5> inside CtrlP to clear the cache at anytime, so I think having an extra mapping to do basically the same thing is not necessary. Thanks for the suggestion, though!\n. Sounds like globpath() chokes on these volumes. So I think your best bet would be using g:ctrlp_user_command and set an external tool to use for listing files.\nYou can check :help g:ctrlp_user_command for the syntax.\n. It's because ctrlp currently prepends the opening cmds with :botright. There's no special reason to it, just my personal preference (it helps breaking the new window out of special buffers and narrow windows). I'll remove it and let the user decides. Thanks!\n. Thanks! But when searching for a keyword I often use something like /bo\\>. So it's not really a problem.\n. This has been resolved since v1.5.4. If hidden and autowriteall are off, Vim will show a Yes/No/Cancel prompt asking to save the buffer. Let me know if it still doesn't do that for you. Thanks!\n. Just added a save dialog. If Yes: save the buffer and open the new file in current window, if No: open in a new split, If Cancel: do nothing.\nLet me know how that works.\nThanks!\n. Just pushed a fix, let me know how that works. I think I explicitly tested this but a few versions back. Thanks for the heads up!\n. Yup, I've made it very simple to add extensions to ctrlp. Everything you need to know is here.\nBut I guess it's unlikely that someone will do this, so I'll give it a shot once I have some more free time.\nThanks for the suggestion!\n. Added along with another extension for quickfix. You can enable it with:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_extensions = ['tag']\nStart in tag mode with :CtrlPTag.\nIf you find any problem or see anything that can be improved, let me know.\nThanks!\n. c3b316a should take care of the updatetime complaint from easytags.\nThis tag extension only looks for tags files defined with the Vim's tags option. So you'll need to include the name and location of the tags file generated by easytags in this option. Try something like this for your vimrc:\nvim\nlet &tags .= ','.vim_tmp.'/easytags'\n. Assuming that the tags option is changed each time you switch to a different filetype, then I think pressing <F5> will update the results. Can you test that and let me know if it helps at all?\n. Let know me know how a4b8d4c works?\nThanks!\n. Do :echo tagfiles() and :echo taglist('.*') return anything before and\nafter running :CtrlPTag? What's the output of :echo tagfiles()?\n. I was able to reproduce this by setting path_mode to 0. However, it should\nstill work with absolute path like\n/tmp/.graudeejs/.vim/easytags/vim but somehow doesn't in your case.\nI'll investigate further and try to find a fix soon.\nOn Tue, Nov 29, 2011 at 2:14 AM, Aldis Berjoza <\nreply@reply.github.com\n\nwrote:\nOn Mon, 28 Nov 2011 10:42:27 -0800\nkien\nreply@reply.github.com\nwrote:\n\nDo :echo tagfiles() and :echo taglist('.*') return anything\nbefore and after running :CtrlPTag?

That'll require some non-trivial changes in how ctrlp does the whole pattern matching. Sounds really cool though, so I'll definitely look into it. As for seaching tags in current buffer, it's much more complicated, and I think tagbar and taglist already do it and do it better, so I probably won't make this.\n\n@claytron: Can you let me know how it works for you now?\nThanks!\n. Can you provide steps to reproduce the \"Tag not found\" error?\nFor the caching, I'll use something other than just checking for filenames.\n. Good idea, I'll try that.\nMy guess is that easytags changes the results returned by tagfiles() when\nswitching to a new buffer, hence the tags files are not found when CtrlPTag\ntrying to run :tag. So there's an option to not create a new buffer/split\nor tab (i.e how fuzzyfinder does it).\nAnyway, thanks for your time!\nOn Tue, Nov 29, 2011 at 2:42 PM, Aldis Berjoza <\nreply@reply.github.com\n\nwrote:\nFor sake of environment differences I suggest you take my vim config\n(clone, cd ~/.vim && make)\nrm -f ~/tmp/.vim/eazytags/*\n cd ~/.vim\nvim vimrc\nWait 4-5 seconds for EasyTags to generate tags\nnow when you open CtrlPTag select tag and press Enter it will show \"Tag\nnot found\" error.\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/issues/27#issuecomment-2919943\n.

CtrlPTag really needs to show tags of current file by default.\nI don't think it would be hard to implement (want me to give some ideas?)\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/issues/27#issuecomment-2930218\n. @claytron: How does it work for you now? In addition to adding persistent caching, I also remove taglist() altogether and use readfile() for everything.\n\n@graudeejs: That could potentially lead to listing the wrong tags from the wrong file, and would be much slower than using ctags, for example. As for the problem with multiple tags with the same name, tag.vim now uses the tag-matchlist commands as a workaround.\n. It only does that if there's at least one other tag with the same name (there are 2 'index' in your case).\nThis should be good enough for now, as using the filename to identify the tag isn't reliable.\n. For people who don't use easytags and have more than one tag file, the filenames can also be the same, as their locations are relative to the tags files.\nIt's like this:\n``\ndir_a\n|- file.ext- tags (path to file is 'file.ext')\ndir_b\n|- file.ext\n`- tags (path to file is also 'file.ext')\n```\nAnd the tags option:\nvim\nset tags+=./dir_a/tags,./dir_b/tags\nThe listing would look like this:\n'mytag'    file.ext\n'mytag'    file.ext\nSo unless I'm missing something, there's no easy way out but using tag-matchlist.\n. It should be much faster now. I did a few tests with a tags file that has 200000 tags and it seemed to work reasonably well. There are probably a few ugly trade-offs, but at least it loads up in this extreme case.\nI also added a tag-count finder, with it you only get the matchlist prompt when the tags are actually identical.\n. Closing this as it's gotten really long and the main issues have been resolved.\nThanks everyone for the feedbacks!\nLastly, just to clarify, you also get the matchlist prompt (see in @graudeejs' screenshot) with :FufTag when jumping to a tag that has duplications. This is the default behavior of :tjump and :stjump. :FufTag just hides the duplications so that you don't know they are there, but if you select one, it'll show that prompt.\nSo what the tag-count finder does here is it helps switching to the :tag command when possible (differences in path/filename), since the :tag command accepts a count argument. And with this, the prompt only shows up in the rare cases where the duplicate tags have the same filename.\n. The s:normcmd() is there to do exactly that, preventing the new buffer being opened in windows created by plugins. These windows are often small or very small (NERDTree, Gundo, MiniBufExpl ...) and user obviously doesn't want them to be replaced by mistake.\nBut it looks like netrw is an exception, so I think I'll add an option to force :e for some plugins.\n. Just added an option for this. You can use this to add some exceptions to s:normcmd():\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_dont_split = ['Netrw']\nLet me know how that works for you.\n. I extended the option to include filetype as well. Let me know how this works:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_dont_split = 'netrw'\n. The parent directory is the directory where an object is located, or that's how it's generally understood.\nSo for most people, /some/path/to is the parent directory and /some/path is the nearest ancestor.\n. Thank you! This has been added. The only difference is / and \\ work like .. instead of updating on-the-fly.\n. Added. Thank you!\n. / or \\ can be used to search in subdirs. Also, / or \\  may be accidentally hit and if the project root's large and not yet scanned, it'll result in a long wait.\n. If you type a continuous part of the filename like that then quickly pressing <c-r> and/or <c-d> will help bringing up more accurate results.\nI can make it work better by default but the performance impact will be too big on large projects. Vim's very slow when it comes to searching in large lists, a few thousand items and it starts getting noticeable.\n. Thanks! But I don't think this should be a default behavior. s:maxfiles is the max number of files to scan for initially, the default is 20000. It can also be set to 0 for no-limit.\nIf you want to see more results, simply changing maxheight will be best. There's really no differences between that and limiting the maxheight yet showing more results (which you have to scroll to see them).\nEdit: Actually, using s:maxfiles also causes the startup time to skyrocket if the root dir is large, so it's probably not a good idea.\n. I think that's exactly the idea, if there are more results than needed to display then the extras should be removed.\n. I think I had this same idea when writing prompt.vim (which eventually evolved into ctrlp.vim). There was also a partial implementation as the now removed ctrlp_live_update option and the <c-^> mapping. I thought it was a little bit inconvenient to have to wait or hit something for the list to update.\nBut I see your point, so I'll definitely give this another try.\nThanks!\n. Added. You can enable/disable it or set the delay time with this option:\nvim\nlet  g:ctrlp_lazy_update = 0\nThe default delay time is 250ms.\n. The tricky part with using the previous result for subsequent filtering, is that the input string can be edited in different ways that make the previous result irrelevant. For example when using<del> <bs> <c-w>... in the middle of the previous string. So after a number of searches, there'll be nothing left to search.\n. Closing this as the logic has actually already been used (although differently) and only triggered when the number of items found is less than max_height.\nBut regardless, thank you for suggesting!\n. I don't think there's a good enough reason to have a new option for this. The only difference with using a larger max_height is that with this you don't see everything printed in the ctrlp buffer and need to scroll. Also, ctrlp restores the view after closing and you can't do anything else while it's open anyway (else it closes), so there's very little point in saving screen real-estate.\n. It's kind of a limitation. The larger the project the less accurate this\ngets.\nAs to how to remedy it, you can enter regex mode with  and search for\nthe literal user.rb using user.rb as the input.\nOn Wed, Nov 30, 2011 at 12:46 AM, Ben Mills <\nreply@reply.github.com\n\nwrote:\nI've been trying to use ctrlp at work and on our main large project (a\nrails project) I try to find \"user.rb\" and it matches things like\n\"app/controllers/status_controller.rb\".\nIs this a config issue on my end or an actual bug?\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/issues/40\n. Pulled.\n\nThank you!\n. Added in my local version and will be available in the next commit.\nThanks!\n. I can't reproduce this. I tested in both gVim and terminal Vim on Linux and Windows, the content of \" stays the same before and after opening a file.\nThis is rather odd because the only register that CtrlP touches is v and it gets restored after gv\"vy. There's nothing that does anything with the \" register.\nCan you consistently reproduce this? Does it happens if you comment out the gv\"vy line?\nAlso, try loading a minimal vimrc with no other plugin and see if it still happens:\nvim\nvim --noplugin -u {path/to/a/simple/.vimrc}\nAnd have only this line in the above vimrc:\nvim\nse nocp\nruntime! plugin/ctrlp.vim\nJust make sure the parent directory of plugin/ is in your runtimepath, for example ~/.vim or $HOME/vimfiles.\n. No, you're correct. I didn't know it does that. I'll push a fix soon.\nThanks for reporting this!\n. <bs> should delete the character. Are you using console Vim on Windows?\n. It happens with console Vim on Windows for me but works fine on Linux and OSX. Also, mapping delete to a different key works, so it's probably something with the <bs> key.\n. Looks like this is because <c-h> is mapped for moving left, while <c-h> is the Vim's keystroke for <bs> (like <c-m> for <cr>). The odd thing is that this seems to behave inconsistently between different Vim builds.\nSo the workaround is to not map <c-h> to left movement but instead to backspace. You can add something like this to your vimrc:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings = {\n    \\ 'PrtBS()': ['<c-h>'],\n    \\ 'PrtCurLeft()': ['<left>'],\n    \\ }\nIf you don't want to use <left>, just choose something else.\n. Nope, it loads instantly for me. There hasn't been any report of slow startup time either.\nCan you reproduce it with minimal configuration? Try starting vim with this:\nvim --noplugin -u path/to/a/simple/.vimrc\nAnd this as the content of the above .vimrc:\nvim\nset nocp\nruntime! plugin/ctrlp.vim\nJust make sure the parent dir of plugin is in your runtimepath, for example ~/.vim or $HOME\\vimfiles.\nIf it doesn't happen in this case, then maybe you can help me tracking down whatever is interfering with ctrlp by commenting out parts of your .vimrc. It might be an autocmd or something that does stuff when a new buffer/window is opened/created.\n. Pulled.\nThank you!\n. Nope, it's hard to tell which directory is \"troublesome\" without indexing it first.\nYou'll just have to wait for it to finish while having this in your .vimrc:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_clear_cache_on_exit = 0\nThis will tell ctrlp to keep the cache when exiting Vim.\n. Not sure if I want to have yet another option. Since enabling cross-sessions caching already solves this problem. And using the global wildignore for this is probably out of the question.\n. Works fine for me on Linux and Windows, haven't tried OSX yet:\n\nWhat Vim version are you using? If it's 7.0 or 7.1 then you'll just need to upgrade Vim.\n. Does it work if you have this in your .vimrc?\nvim\nset termencoding=utf-8\nset encoding=utf-8\nIt works for me on OSX (oddly only after a system restart):\n\n. It looks like the problem is with Vim's globpath() not expanding the path correctly when the path has one of those characters. I'm not 100% sure, though.\nI think you'll have to use the g:ctrlp_user_command option to get the list of files instead. You can add this to your .vimrc:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_user_command = 'find %s -type f'\nOr this to filter files that you don't want to be listed:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_user_command = \"find %s -type f | egrep -v '\\.(swp|swo|log|gitkep|keepme|so|o)$'\"\nLet me know how that works.\n. @marttt: that's a different issue and it's a known limitation of the ctrlp prompt. But if you update ctrlp to the latest, you can set the g:ctrlp_key_loop option to allow typing of accented characters. See :help g:ctrlp_key_loop for more details.\n. You can enable tag search with this option:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_extensions = ['tag']\nThen use :CtrlPTag to open ctrlp in tag mode.\n. Filtering those will slow CtrlPTag down when the tag file's large. It was what this extension did in an earlier version.\nI'll see if I can add the filter back without slowing it down too much.\n. Let me know how the latest commit works for you.\nNo idea if there's an option for ctags, but I think it shouldn't matter. Some users might actually want to have those tags in their tag files.\n. It's because of the globpath() function. No way to work around I'm afraid.\nIf you run :echo globpath(getcwd(), '*/') for example, it always shows the directory if using the wildignore+=cache/* format.\n. I already have a gitignore file locally. I'll add this to it myself and commit later.\nThanks!\n. Same questions as for your other issue. There hasn't been any such report of this. The mappings are very straight forward, it only adds : if you (or something in your configuration) type :. Do you map anything to : globally?\nAlso, let me know your Vim version and OS.\nThanks!\n. I see. Then please provide some details for your other issue. I'm closing\nthis one now as it's related to the other.\nThanks!\nOn Sat, Dec 17, 2011 at 1:26 AM, gjunkie <\nreply@reply.github.com\n\nwrote:\nI don't map anything to it globally. I've tried to reproduce the issue and\nhave been unable to, so this may have been an offshoot. Though I can say\nthat it happened while the other issue was happening as well with slow\nperformance.\nVIM: 7.3.87\nMac OS X 10.7.2\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/issues/54#issuecomment-3180782\n. This sounds like a problem with Vim & your configuration. In any case, please provide some details: What type of file do you have in the other buffer? How do you invoke ctrlp? Does it happen consistently? Does it happen with minimal configuration?\n\nYou can try starting Vim with this:\nvim --noplugin -u path/to/a/simple/.vimrc\nUse this as the content of the above .vimrc:\nvim\nse nocp\nruntime! plugin/ctrlp.vim\nMake sure the parent dir of plugin is in your runtimepath, for example ~/.vim or $HOME\\vimfiles.\nThen try to reproduce the problem.\n. Temporarily closing this one now for lack of information, and because it's probably unfixable within the plugin.\n. Thank you! But this makes <c-t> work exactly like <cr> when jump_to_buffer = 2, is that what you want? And when jump_to_buffer = 1, <c-t> just opens a new tab as usual.\nAlso, I actually mean to have the && md == 'e' condition there to limit it to just <cr> and not any other mapping. When users use <c-x>, <c-v>, <c-t>, they might really want to open the file in a new tab or new split, regardless of the current value of jump_to_buffer.\n. Pulled. And I took the opportunity to make this feature a little more robust. Let me know if you find any problem.\n. Added. The new option is g:ctrlp_cmd.\nThanks for the suggestion!\n. Also added. Thanks for the suggestion!\nThe new option is g:ctrlp_custom_ignore. Let me know how it works for you.\n. @fourcolors I'll need some details. What mode are you trying to use the custom ignore for (I suppose Files) and what exactly are you trying to ignore? Have you cleared the cache or restarted Vim? Delete the cache directory if you aren't sure.\n. Did you press <F5> in CtrlP or run :CtrlPClearAllCaches to clear the cache? If you want to be sure, delete the .cache/ctrlp dir in your home dir.\n. Pulled to my local repo. I'll push it out with the next batch of changes.\nThank you!\n. Thank you! I'm aware of this. It's mentioned in the docs here in response to issue #45.\nI think what I'm going to do now is just add the workaround to the script and get rid of that note altogether.\n. Hi Paul,\nThere's a custom ignore option you can use: g:ctrlp_custom_ignore\nRegarding the wildignore issue, some people may have .git in their wildignore and not just for ctrlp. In that case, it still breaks fugitive and there's nothing I can do to help it.\n. Yes, certainly.\nThanks!\n. Thank you! This should be fixed now.\n. Should be fixed now. Thanks!\n. The current implementation of the MRU list is similar to that of desktop applications. Changing it to recently-entered is simple, having this in your .vimrc will do:\nvim\nau BufEnter * cal ctrlp#mrufiles#list(expand('<abuf>', 1))\nI'll keep it in mine for a bit and see if it should be the default.\n. Oh I see. But the buffer list actually isn't fixed, it's sorted according to multiple criteria (not the first opened time). I won't change this as it would overlap the MRU list's functionality.\n. Thanks, guys! I appreciate it more than you know.\n. Reopening this so more people will see it. Also, thank you again for helping to track down the bugs in this feature!\n. Nope, it only accepts t, h or v and <c-o> only reuses a window if it's empty and is the only one in a tab.\nI'll see if I can rewrite the open function to allow a new option value.\n. <c-o> should be a bit smarter now. No new tab will be created unless t is used. For h and v, if the active buffer belongs to a plugin or is a help or quickfix window, <c-o> will try to find a normal buffer and split it, unless there's an empty window then it'll be used instead.\nThe new values for ctrlp_open_multi are tr, hr, vr. They work just like t, h, v with the exception of the first selected file replacing the active buffer in the current window. The logic above also applies.\n. OK, you can now do that by using tr, hr or vr without giving a number. t, h and v without a number work, too, but the first file will be opened in a new split or new tab (then the rest hidden).\nSo this will do what you want:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_open_multi = 'vr'\n. OK, this looks serious. But I doubt using pathogen would cause any problem. Almost everyone uses some sort of plugin/runtimepath manager nowaday, and this is the first report of these errors.\nDo you mind posting the output of :version?\n. Ok, could you try starting Vim with this?\nmvim --noplugin -u ~/simple_vimrc\nAnd this for the simple_vimrc, make sure plugin/ctrlp.vim is in your runtimepath:\nvim\nset nocp\nruntime! plugin/ctrlp.vim\nThen activate ctrlp with :CtrlP, :CtrlPBuffer and :CtrlPMRU.\n- If all of them works, try disabling parts of your Vim configuration (plugins, .vimrcs) to isolate the problem.\n- If it only happens with the :CtrlP command, then put this into the simple_vimrc and try again:\nvim\n  let g:ctrlp_user_command = 'find %s -type f'\n- But if none of the above helps, then I guess I'll just have to live with this. Can't fix if I can't reproduce it. It also seems to be a long standing problem with MacVim that happens seemingly out of nowhere:\n  http://vim.1045645.n5.nabble.com/MacVim-app-snapshot-22-td1215494i20.html\nAlso, sorry for the late reply! I wanted to wait a bit and see if there was anyone else with the same problem that could provide a solution or informations.\n. Yep, the counter isn't real time so when hitting a large directory, it stops at the last number. It looks like it hangs, but if you can use <c-c> to stop it, then it's probably still scanning.\nAs for speeding up this initial build, you can try disabling dotfiles scanning g:ctrlp_dotfiles = 0, enable cross-session caching g:ctrlp_clear_cache_on_exit = 0, and add some ignore rules to ignore the generated files.\nNote that using wildignore is faster than using the custom_ignore option, since this option can only be applied after the scan is finished.\nI'm going to close this now. If you encounter the crash again, try using OSX's find to get the list of files through the user_command option. And please feel free to reopen/comment on this.\n. I don't know what's going on in the background but from this old conversation, it might have something to do with MacVim itself and OSX: http://vim.1045645.n5.nabble.com/MacVim-app-snapshot-22-td1215494i20.html\nBut you can always try disabling your plugins to see if the error is plugin related.\n. This is because the ctags plugin changes Vim's  laststatus option upon BufEnter and BufLeave, while you have set laststatus=0 somewhere in your .vimrc. Changing the value of laststatus to 2 will fix this.\nI won't try to make a workaround for this in ctrlp as it'll lead to a slippery slope of never-ending workarounds.\n. Sorry, my mistake, set laststatus=1 also makes the problem appear. And =1 is Vim's default. I tested earlier with 2 splits so =1 was the same as =2 (both worked fine).\nAlso, the source of this incompatibility is from using winrestcmd() to restore the window layout.\n. 34aa84e should solve this problem by using :noautocmd to open the ctrlp buffer. I hesitated to use it until now because using this command will make it not possible for users to interact with the ctrlp buffer via autocmds. For example, after this commit, the vim-powerline plugin won't be able to apply a custom statusline to ctrlp via BufEnter.\nAlso, speaking of statusline, this should also fix the incompatibility between ctags.vim and ctrlp (issue #73).\n. There's a hard limit for matching only tag names. But this was unintentional. It should be fixed now.\nThanks for reporting!\n. @claytron: I just removed the hard limit for partial matching. It should work for you now as well.\n. Nope, not yet. But it sounds like it could be a nice improvement to <c-y>, so I'll definitely look into it.\nThanks!\n. With the recent changes, there are now 2 ways of doing this. Number 2's more in line with what you want, but 1's faster with deep directories:\n1) Using <c-z> to mark a file and use its path as the base dir:\n<c-p><c-d>filetxt<c-z><c-u>New Article/article.txt<c-y>\n|    |    |      |    |    |\n|    |    |      |    |    `- start creating the new dir and file\n|    |    |      |    `- clear the prompt\n|    |    |      `- mark it to get its parent dirs: content/articles\n|    |    `- find a file in content/articles/\n|    `- switch to matching only filename\n`- start ctrlp\n2) Using <tab> to auto-complete each directory:\n<c-p>co<tab>ar<tab>New Article/article.txt<c-y>\n|    | |    | |    |\n|    | |    | |    `- start creating the new dir and file\n|    | |    | `- auto-complete it to articles/ if possible\n|    | |    `- type the first chars of articles/\n|    | `- auto-complete it to content/ if possible\n|    `- type the first chars of content/\n`- start ctrlp\nThat is it, for now. If you find any problem or have any quesion, let me know.\nThanks!\n. Fixed. Broken in e42bb4c.\n. Yes, this is a feature and there's an option to override it.\nSo for nerdtree you can use this:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_dont_split = 'nerdtree'\n. It works fine for me on Windows and Linux. Not sure if anything could interfere with this.\nDoes anything in .git show? How about without the dollar signs? Or just using a forward slash at the end like this: '\\.yardoc/'?\n. You could try starting Vim with only ctrlp and nothing else. So start Vim with something like this:\nvim\nvim --noplugin -u path/to/a/simple/.vimrc\nAnd inside that .vimrc:\nvim\nset nocp\nruntime! plugin/ctrlp.vim\nlet g:ctrlp_custom_ignore = {\n  \\ 'dir':  '\\.git$\\|\\.hg$\\|\\.svn$\\|\\.yardoc$',\n  \\ 'file': '\\.exe$\\|\\.so$\\|\\.dat$'\n  \\ }\nJust make sure plugin/ is in your runtimepath, for example in ~/.vim.\nIf it works in this case, then you could try commenting out parts of your .vimrc, disabling plugins etc...\nAlso, this ctrlp_custom_ignore option doesn't work with the ctrlp_user_command option.\n. Does wildignore work for you then? The option would look like this:\nvim\nset wildignore+=*/.git/*,*/.hg/*,*/.svn/*,*/.yardoc/*,*.exe,*.so,*.dat\nAlso, could you try these out, just in case the returned directories end with a /?\n``` vim\nlet g:ctrlp_custom_ignore = {\n  \\ 'dir':  '.yardoc/',\n  \\ }\n\" Or this:\nlet g:ctrlp_custom_ignore = {\n  \\ 'dir':  '.yardoc',\n  \\ }\n```\nAnd before starting up ctrlp, run :echo g:ctrlp_custom_ignore to see if it's there.\n. Press <F5> in ctrlp to clear the cache. If you switch branches a lot and don't mind the scanning, just disable caching with let g:ctrlp_use_caching = 0.\n. @wmayner this wasn't actually an issue. The custom_ignore option has been pretty much bug-free since introduced. So I suggest double checking everything. Making sure the cache files are deleted, you're not using the default user_command, and node_modules isn't symlinked.\nThe 'dir', 'file', etc. are very specific. So if all else false or you don't want to dig further, just use the string format which applies to everything, instead of the dictionary format.\n. ctrlp has 2 different statuslines. The main one is the one you see most of the time, created with ctrlp#statusline(). The other one you only see briefly when scanning for files, created with ctrlp#progress(len).\nI can make them check for an option to use first.\nEdit: Removed the printf() example because it can't be used for the statusline.\n. Added a new option on the custom_statusline branch. See eae302f8.\nHere's a working example that recreates the default statuslines: https://gist.github.com/1610859\nLet me know if that's good enough.\n. Added. You can enable it with:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_mruf_relative = 1\nThanks for the suggestion!\n. Hmm, I'm pretty sure it still works. Can you describe exactly what doesn't work as you expect? Or do you still see some files outside the current working directory?\nAlso, the code is here, it's just a simple filter to remove files outside the cwd:\nhttps://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/blob/master/autoload/ctrlp/mrufiles.vim#L41-44\n. > And btw, g:ctrlp_mruf_relative could be removed from help file as it's not used anywhere in the code now.\nNo, it's in the code AND it's working fine. Did you check the link in my previous comment? {s:re} is g:ctrlp_mruf_relative.\nAlso, it would help if you provide a test case where it doesn't work, just open a new issue. Include in it the current working directory, the files you expect to not be included, and the exact steps to reproduce the problem.\nEdit: Oh ok, I see that you're using CtrlPMixed. The reason it doesn't apply to Mixed mode because it would nullify having MRU files in the mix in the first place. MRU files in the cwd are already covered by \"Files\".\n. You can use let g:ctrlp_match_window_bottom = 0. You might also want let g:ctrlp_match_window_reversed = 0 to show the results from top to bottom.\n. Nope, that's Vim's command line. We can't move it.\n. Yes, it's a feature. You can disable it with:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_jump_to_buffer = 0\n. 1 is the default. So if you want the opposite, set it to 0.\n. ctrlp uses the default CursorLine highlight group from your colorscheme. So if you want a different color, either edit your colorscheme or have a different CursorLine line in your .vimrc.\n. Could you help me test this patch, see if it works for you?\nhttps://gist.github.com/1624947\nSaving and restoring &l:tags was a fix for a compatibility issue with the easytags.vim plugin, which aggressively set &l:tags when a new buffer is created or opened. I can't reproduce this problem with the latest easytags.vim, however.\n. Great, thank you!\n. Yes, the order's straight out of Vim buffer list, so it's buffer-number. This is also the second time someone asks for this so maybe I'll look into adding it next. In the mean time, you can use the MRU list :CtrlPMRU while having this autocmd in your vimrc. It should provide what you need:\nvim\nautocmd BufEnter,BufUnload * call ctrlp#mrufiles#list(expand('<abuf>', 1))\nAlso, outside of ctrlp, you can use the Vim's <c-^> mapping to switch between the current buffer and the previous buffer.\n. OK, I decided to not add this, since the MRU file list already contains all the buffers. Instead, I've added an option to sort the MRU file list in most-recently-entered order:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_mruf_last_entered = 1\nIt'll do what you want originally but with :CtrlPMRU.\n. Should be fixed now. Thanks!\n. Yes, use let g:ctrlp_by_filename = 1.\n. We can't map <cr> and <c-m> differently, since <c-m> has the same keycode as <cr> (13) in Vim. The same goes for <esc> and <c-[>, among others. You'll have to choose other key for \"e\" if you want to use <cr> for \"t\".\n. Should be fixed now. Thanks!\n. Not sure if this should be bundled into ctrlp as I think most people don't need it. And you can probably do it with an autocmd:\nvim\nau BufReadPost * norm! zvzz\n. Right, I just assumed you only wanted to do that with new files. BufWinEnter will probably be better for opened files.\nEdit: Also, thanks for pointing out that BufReadPost doesn't work for those cmds. Closing this one now.\n. Probably won't be adding this. Too much for one plugin. There also isn't any useful <c-...> mapping left to use.\n. @d11wtq: For (1), there's the g:ctrlp_buffer_func option. See :help g:ctrlp_buffer_func. Just define some buffer local mappings with nnoremap <buffer> <silent> ... in the function.\nFor (2), there isn't a built-in function, but you can use something like fnamemodify(getline('.')[2:], ':p'). And this can only get the filename in filename related modes (files, buffers, mru etc...).\n. You can set the maximum number of files to scan with the g:ctrlp_max_files option. The default's 20000.\nTo stop a scan midway, press <c-c> (it should stop everything vimscript) then press <esc> to exit as usual.\n. That'd be too low. Personally, I haven't had any problem with 20000, no one else complains about it either. But I think cmd-t has this at 10000, so I might lower ctrlp's to that if there are more requests.\n. The counter isn't real time. So when reaching a large directory it stops until globpath() finishes the scan in that directory.\n. <c-c> pauses everything including the counter, so it might look like it's frozen, but you can still press <esc> or <c-c> again to close the prompt.\nHowever if it actually freezes Vim then there's really nothing I can do to address that. It'll be an issue between Vimscript and Vim, i.e. running globpath() in a large directory tree sometimes freezes Vim.\nAs for an alternative to using globpath(), check out :help g:ctrlp_user_command.\n. Let me know if this patch works for you:\n``` diff\n+++ b/autoload/ctrlp.vim\n@@ -155,7 +155,7 @@ fu! s:Open()\n endf\nfu! s:Close()\n-   try | noa bun! | cat | noa clo! | endt\n+   try | bun! | cat | clo! | endt\n    cal s:unmarksigns()\n    for key in keys(s:glbs)\n        sil! exe 'let &'.key.' = s:glb_'.key\n```\n. Could you provide steps to reproduce this then? Filetype of the file. It's already opened or new.

I don't get any highlighting at all when I just do :e project.clj without using ctrlp.\nEdit: I probably don't have the syntax file for clj which isn't shipped with Vim. Which one do you use?\n. Ok, I tried with this script: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2501\nThe syntax works with both :e and ctrlp in vim and mvim on OSX for me. I didn't try the latest mvim, though, since I'm still on Snow Leopard.\n. Alright, finally installed janus and was able to reproduce this. Apparently, the problem comes from some mapping conflicts between janus (or a plugin inside janus) and VimClojure. In my test case they are the \\rt and \\et mappings.

The files can be from any directory, not just the cwd. So removing the leading part for only a few then adding them again will be problematic.\nAlso, you can switch to matching only filename by pressing <c-d>, this should help if the paths are too long.\n.

You can try setting the g:ctrlp_cmd option to the cmd that you use, i.e. CtrlPCurWD\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_cmd = 'CtrlPCurWD'\n. The mapping to :CtrlP exists because it's a restored session. But the lazy-load method you use doesn't load ctrlp along with it. So the best option's for you to use something different, because many plugins have default mappings as well, and this method wouldn't work well with them. But regardless, I'll make disabling the ctrlp's default mapping an option, maybe by leaving g:ctrlp_map empty.\n. It's not a completion menu. The prompt's created in  Vim's command-line and works as such. <c-p> and <c-n> are used for browsing the command history in the command line. They do the same job in ctrlp's prompt, browsing the input history.\nYou can remap the keys if you don't like the default. For example, this is probably close to what you want:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings = {\n    \\ 'PrtSelectMove(\"j\")':   ['<c-j>', '<c-n>'],\n    \\ 'PrtSelectMove(\"k\")':   ['<c-k>', '<c-p>'],\n    \\ 'PrtHistory(-1)':       ['<down>'],\n    \\ 'PrtHistory(1)':        ['<up>'],\n    \\ }\n. This doesn't work well on Windows because mkdir() can't create subdirs. But making it work on Windows breaks it for everyone else. Removed to re-implement it later.\n. Hmm, apparently I missed this part, it can create subdirs:\nmkdir({name} [, {path} [, {prot}]])\n        If {path} is \"p\" then intermediate directories are created as\n        necessary.  Otherwise it must be \"\".\n. There's no built-in way to do this. Not sure if I want to add it either. But you can write a function like this to do it:\n``` vim\nfu! s:call_ctrlp_extension(ext)\n    if !exists('g:ctrlp_builtins')\n        ru autoload/ctrlp.vim\n    en\n    cal ctrlp#init(ctrlp#{a:ext}#id())\nendf\n\" Then create some mappings:\nnn  l :cal call_ctrlp_extension('line')\nnn  s :cal call_ctrlp_extension('rtscript')\n``\n. Reproducible but the problem seems to be originated from either netrw or Vim. Here's the test case:\n- Runvim ~/test/sym3/*where sym3 is linked to another directory.\n- Vim starts with the netrw buffer. Immediately run:lsfrom Vim's command-line.\n  In the list,~/test/sym3is listed as a buffer number 2.\n- Run:CtrlPBuffer.test/sym3` is also listed as a buffer, since the buffer list's taken from Vim.\nRepeat step 1 and 2 then do this:\n- Run :b2. Vim returns \"~/test/sym3\" is a directory.\n  Run :ls again, the sym3 buffer is gone.\n  Run :CtrlPBuffer, test/sym3 also gone.\nEdit: ~/test/sym3 is still listed in the output of :ls when ctrlp isn't installed.\nScreenshot:\n\n. Vim 7.3.0 on Ubuntu 10.10, netrw Last change: 2010 Jul 28.\n. > Used :CtrlPBuffer to go to some buffer.\nDoes it happen if you use :buffer [buffer-number]? Try :edit [filename] as well, where filename's the filename of the buffer. Also, try starting Vim with vim --noplugin -u .empty_vimrc ~/.vim/snippets/* where the vimrc only has set nocp, then browse through the buffers with :bn or :bp.\n. Let me know if e7b08a3 changes anything.\n. Let me know how 6fe1e50 works. Thanks!\n. Should be fixed now. Sorry about the hiccup!\n. Hmm, so are you suggesting that the default fuzzy mode should work like regexp mode at first? I think I already tried to implement that once, but couldn't use it because of a problem with filtering the results (it was very slow), hence the current implementation separating fuzzy and literal strings.\n. Oh I see. But that'll have the same performance problem, I think. For example, the pattern with the smallest substrings and lowest priority, c.*o.*v.*e.*r.*\\..*e.*r.*l will match entries already matched by co.*ver.*\\.erl. So in one way or another, these entries will have to be filtered. And filtering in vimscript is really slow, any operation with large lists, large dictionaries is. The only way I see that can really improve this part is by doing it with a better language then send the results back to be displayed.\nBut to stay pure vimscript and portable, this is kind of it. Separate fuzzy and literal string modes where people can use co.*ver.*\\.erl or cover\\.erl when they need to.\n. OK, matching the whole string first is on the 1.7.0 branch. This is a near complete rewrite of the old algorithm. It gives better results by default but is noticeably slower when searching in large directories. I'm still undecided as to merge it or not. Let me know what you guys think.\n. @DelvarWorld: Yep, I think I'll just keep it as a separate branch, as I'd rather have the speed myself. And if not being fully fuzzy stops people from using the plugin, that's fine by me. I understand that you mean to encourage making the plugin better, but I'm pretty much done with this.\n. vim\nlet g:ctrlp_use_caching = 0\nlet g:ctrlp_clear_cache_on_exit = 1\n. This is expected and it's a limitation, I'm afraid. If the search string's long, it'll take more time to find the matches. As the string gets longer, the delay starts getting more noticeable. It also seems to be highly dependent on people's computers.\nSo you'll want to keep the string short and unique. If you want to match only filenames, you can press <c-d> to toggle filename-only mode, instead of typing out the letters and the /'s in the path. Another option's to use the lazy update option which tells ctrlp to only update the match window when typing has stopped:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_lazy_update = 1\n. I get an E420: BG color unknown error in gVim on Windows. I think a better solution would be using separate rules for GUI and non-GUI:\nvim\nexe 'hi CtrlPLineMarker '.( has('gui_running') ? 'gui' : 'cterm' ).'fg=bg'\nAlso, not sure if I want the prefix optional. Implementing's simple but unicode symbols don't seem to work very well on Windows, and it might cause problems on others where people can't open files.\n. Hmm, it'd still generate issues here from people who had problems using it, and I'd have to deal with those issues. Besides, after this change, there will be only one > for the selected entry. So it's probably not worth it for an extra option.\n. Looks like the colorscheme you're using doesn't set the Normal highlight group or does but ctermbg isn't defined.\n6a9f1e3 should workaround this.\n. Thanks! You can use the option shellslash to have / as path separator on Windows:\nvim\nset shellslash\nHowever, changing the code to silently treat \\ as / is a no-go at this point. There are too many things to consider.\n. I don't have access to Win7 at the moment but 1.6.9 works perfectly fine for me on WinXP. I'll try to setup a Win7 machine and test this once I have some free time.\nFor now, I think you should just use 1.6.3. There's very little difference between it and 1.6.9, except for new extensions and some new features. Most of the bugfixes are for the new stuff, too.\n. Could you guys help me test this patch? Kind of a shot in the dark, but these are the few changes in 1.6.9 vs 1.6.3 that can affect performance when typing.\nIt's against master.

I went ahead and committed this. If you find any problem later, let me know.\n@beaugunderson: I think that actually isn't this bug. ctrlp's just slow when there are a lot of files. You can find some related explanations/solutions here.\n. Thanks! But there's already an option you can use to set it:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_root_markers = ['.lvimrc']\nWith this, ctrlp will look for .lvimrc first and zoom to the first parent directory that has it.\n. They are all used. If the first one isn't found anywhere, ctrlp will then look for the next one. This option simply puts .lvimrc at the top of the queue.\n. Nope, it's not possible to set multiple user commands. Also, with what you're using, the second line just redefines the g:ctrlp_user_command variable and overwrites the value set by the first line. That wouldn't work in any case.\n. You'll have to change the AcceptSelection(\"e\") as well since <cr> is already used for it.\nSo this will do what you want:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings = {\n  \\ 'AcceptSelection(\"e\")': [],\n  \\ 'AcceptSelection(\"t\")': ['<cr>', '<c-m>'],\n  \\ }\n. @jonasdiemer: The functionality is still there, the above config only disables the <cr> key. So just use something for AcceptSelection(\"e\") and use that key to submit the ...\n. The results are already weighted based on the length of the match, the length of the path and filename, the last modified time, the parent directory... But because of the constraint of vimscript, all of these can't be done for the entire directory tree but only for the first few matches found. Hence it's inaccurate in large directories but accurate in a smaller test case. And theoretically speaking, it could be much more accurate in the large directories, too. But the performance would be so low that it'd render the plugin unusable. There are some further explanations in issue #110. I'm closing this now as duplicate, or just cantfix since it's not really a bug.\n. Make sure to set that option before plugin/ctrlp.vim is sourced. Either put it in your vimrc, or execute it before sourcing the plugin if you're doing this manually.\nIf you've already done all that and it still happens then please provide steps to reproduce the bug.\n. Hmm, I think you should open an issue on the janus repo then. Maybe someone over there will be able to help. This option works fine for everyone else, and here it sounds like it doesn't get set before the plugin is loaded.\nWish I could be more helpful but I have no clue where to even start to look into this in janus.\n. OK, I just installed janus and put let g:ctrlp_extensions = ['tag'] in .vimrc.before. The command CtrlPTag is available right from the start. So it looks like something else in your janus config is the culprit. You can try disabling plugins, commenting out parts of the .vimrcs etc... to isolate it.\n. If I understand it correctly, you want ctrlp to not pick up the langmap option? This means reseting the user's langmap option when entering the ctrlp buffer.

It should be possible to override the default highlighting after 75e31e9. I also added some descriptions at :h ctrlp-customization.\n. Yes, it's expected. And it's slow because it has to do the matching/comparing for a lot of files with 999 being the upper limit. If you want the window to fit the screen, use something like this instead:\nvim\nau VimEnter,VimResized * let g:ctrlp_max_height = &lines\n. You can use <c-^> (outside of ctrlp) to switch to the previous file. Or set this option and use :CtrlPMRU in place of :CtrlPBuffer:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_mruf_last_entered = 1\n. Make sure you clear the cache after setting the option. Run :ClearAllCtrlPCaches from the command-line or press <F5> in ctrlp.\n. I already made some changes that should (unintentionally) fix this, I think. Let me know if this doesn't return either -1 or an empty string:\n:echo synIDattr(synIDtrans(hlID('Normal')), 'bg')\n. Because not every colorscheme uses guifg=bg or ctermfg=bg for Ignore (molokai for example, uses a visible color for this group's foreground). So it's better using the Normal's bg directly.\n. This should be fixed in 75e31e9.\nIt's also now possible to change the default highlighting for every part of the prompt.\n. This has been brought up before. The consensus was that the matching couldn't be improved without decreasing performance.\nAs for a solution, you can type gemfile$ and switch to regexp mode by pressing <c-r>. This will bring up every file that ends with gemfile.\n. It only accepts the letters on the standard US-International keyboard layout, i.e. letters in the Latin alphabet, from a to z. I have no plan to support more.\n. I see, but my point's that it only accepts the standard letters. What can be typed with the keyboard (damn near everything) is irrelevant. If you have to type (pressed-then-released style) 2 or more keys to get 1 accented letter, it won't work even if the letter's supported. Also, the currently supported range's ASCII 32 to 126. This includes a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and the standard symbols and punctuations.\nI'll gladly accept something like this for accented letters, though.\n. I haven't tried them either but it seems all of these have been written by others. Although the yankring one doesn't seem to depend on YankRing.vim, but less dependencies is a plus, IMO.\nSo maybe it's time to close this, and let people who want to request new extensions to just open new issues.\n. Added. You can use <F5> to reformat the old MRU list.\n. Fixed in 93cb20d. Didn't pull your commit because tail is also used for commands, not just for line numbers.\nThanks!\n. Looks like you're using an older version of the plugin, namely v1.6.9. This has already been fixed in the latest version on github. You can get the latest zipball or tarball here.\nBut for v1.6.9, you just need to set a colorscheme that defines a background color and the error will go away.\n. The current version is 1.7.1 with this particular issue fixed in 75e31e9. And yes, vividchalk has ctermbg=none.\n. 1.6.9 was the only version that had this error. Make sure you update to the latest version on github (currently 1.7.3).\n. Mentioned in the docs.\n. Probably won't be adding this myself since I'm not familiar with cscope. Pull requests are most welcome, though. You can checkout the extensions branch for how to create an extension.\n. BTW, an extension for ctags had already been added long before this request. I still don't see me adding one for cscope, but if anyone wants to give it a shot, take a look at the ctags one, I imagine it'd be somewhat similar.\n. You just need to be more specific with the search string. It also helps to use filename mode (toggle with <c-d>), regex mode (toggle with <c-r>), or both at the same time. And make sure the cache for the current directory is up-to-date (press <F5> in ctrlp to update).\n. I'd just type something like contacts then toggle filename mode with <c-d>. If that wasn't enough, I'd then toggle regex mode with <c-r>, since contacts is a literal part of the filename.\n. This belongs in a user's .vimrc, I think. The default <c-p> mapping and the command used for it are already configurable. Adding this on top of that, and allowing the whole thing to be configurable as well will be a little over complicated, especially for something you can do with a mapping:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_map = ''\nnn <silent> <c-p> :sil! exe 'CtrlP'.['', 'CurWD', 'Dir'][v:count]<cr>\n. You want to match the last part of a path. Try [\\/]\\.[^\\/]\\+$.\nAlternatively, you can disable dotfiles searching with this:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_dotfiles = 0\n. This is most likely because Gemfile.lock is newer (in last modified time) than Gemfile, assuming they are in the same directory, with \"gemfile\" as the search string. Please see #132.\n. This isn't possible to implement with the current matching method. To get more accurate results you'll just have to switch to filename mode or regexp mode when searching. You can toggle filename mode with <c-d> and regexp mode with <c-r>. So for example, type foo.rb then press <c-d>, or type user.rb then press <c-r>.\nAlso, this may be useful for you.\n. Yes, people have been using those types of mapping long before ctrlp came into the picture. As for toggling modes with <c-d> <c-r>, it's not intuitive and needs some get-used-to, but nothing can be done about this, unfortunately. It's not that I haven't tried to improve it.\n. That's because ctrlp sets its local working directory each time it's invoked. You'll need to disable this with the g:ctrlp_working_path_mode option:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_working_path_mode = 0\n. Make sure you set that in vimrc and use <c-x> in :CtrlPDir.\nAlso, if you only want to change the working directory to ~/another_workspace then just use :cd ~/another_workspace. I don't see a point in opening it with CtrlPDir just to <c-x> and exit right away.\nAnd if you want to search in ~/another_workspace, then just use :CtrlP ~/another_workspace.\n. Thank you! I'm keeping the old commands for now and will remove them after a while, so that it doesn't break people's setups.\n. Yes, this behavior is expected. The custom_ignore and wildignore options only take effect when globpath() is used. And since you haven't defined a secondary command with g:ctrlp_user_command, globpath() is used when searching outside a repo.\n\nThe files matching the custom_ignore regex are actually ignored if I'm not in a git project. Otherwise they are shown. \nIs there any chance that the plugin doesn't use the custom_ignore while using a user_custom_command?\n\nDo you mean \"does\"? It already doesn't use the custom_ignore while a user_command is in use.\nBut if you want to ignore stuff while using a user_command, you'll need to include the ignore patterns in the command somehow. For some examples, checkout the s:wig2cmd() function at :help ctrlp-misc.\n. Exactly because of this:\n\nI really like the idea of using a custom command for git repos it is really useful because it makes the search very fast with big projects.\n\nI don't want to slow that down too much and lose that speed. So for git for example, I think it's faster to use the --exclude-from option of the git ls-files command. Here's what works for me:\nssh\ngit ls-files --exclude-from=ignoredfile -i\nWhere the ignoredfile contains this:\n*\n!*.log\n!*.png\n!*.jpg\n. > when I want to switch back and forth between them.\nWouldn't it be more appropriate to use buffer or MRU mode for that? In buffer mode and in MRU mode, the current file is excluded from the listing. If it's also excluded in find file mode, there won't be any way to select it again. But aside from that, it does kind of get in the way sometimes. So I'll see if I should factor the whole thing into an option for the 3 main modes.\n. Changed in 0b3173e because of this:\n\nIf a newer file does match 'coffee', regardless of it being the file you want or not, or of it being the worst match in the list, relying on MRU order alone will always make it the top choice simply because it's the newest.\n\nKind of forgot about this when I made that change. Sorry!\n. That's expected and simply can't be fixed. When the list gets really large, it all comes down to Vimscript's performance.\n. The list isn't unsorted. It's sorted according to the full path's length, the filename's length, the match's length, the last modified time, and the parent directory. So I don't think sorting alphabetically is going to improve it much. But in any case, if anyone wants to pick them apart and improve them, all the functions can be found in the Sorting section in autoload/ctrlp.vim.\nThanks!\n. > When try to access file xxx/color_variation, I thought cv is a good key to search it.\nSomeone else might use cv to search for user.csv, thinking it'd be a good search term. And if the first letter of a word had higher priority, the user.csv file might still win over the color_variation file because its path, filename, and match's length were shorter. Plus, to be honest, I haven't got any idea how to translate this to Vimscript. Doesn't look like it's worth the extra effort either.\nYou just need to be more specific with the search term, for example cova would probably do the job here.\n. You can just remap the keys.\nThis is the default:\nvim\n    \\ 'AcceptSelection(\"e\")': ['<cr>', '<2-LeftMouse>'],\n    \\ 'AcceptSelection(\"h\")': ['<c-x>', '<c-cr>', '<c-s>'],\n    \\ 'AcceptSelection(\"t\")': ['<c-t>'],\n    \\ 'AcceptSelection(\"v\")': ['<c-v>', '<RightMouse>'],\nJust switch <c-t> and <cr> and you're done:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings = {\n    \\ 'AcceptSelection(\"e\")': ['<c-t>'],\n    \\ 'AcceptSelection(\"t\")': ['<cr>', '<2-LeftMouse>'],\n    \\ }\n. Here's something I modified from dir.vim:\nhttps://gist.github.com/2170481\nIt requires af2847a which adds a new function. Place the file in an autoload/ctrlp/ dir in your runtimepath (not necessary inside the plugin's bundle, anywhere will work). Use the g:ctrlp_vcsdir option to change the VCS marker, the default is .git/.\nThis likely won't be bundled with ctrlp so feel free to modify it however you like.\n. Thank you! I updated the gist. It actually wasn't working at all because the cwd was never changed.\n. The plugin doesn't set this option, the user does. So check your configuration. Looks like you set g:ctrlp_custom_ignore twice in different types.\n. It's either the max_files limit (10000), or the max_depth limit (40) has been reached. You can change these limits with the g:ctrlp_max_files and g:ctrlp_max_depth options, respectively.\nIt's most likely max_files, since the views folder is only a few folders deep from the working directory. Assuming you haven't changed the default settings.\n. It works fine for me. Where do you put the let g:ctrlp_working_path_mode = 0? Make sure you put it in your .vimrc (~/.vimrc.before if you're using janus), and then either restart Vim or run :CtrlPReload.\nAlso, before starting ctrlp, run :echo g:ctrlp_working_path_mode to see if the setting has actually been set.\n. Nope, it's because you're using this to call ctrlp:\nvim\nmap <leader>f :CtrlP %:p:h<cr>\nThe path_mode option doesn't take effect when you call ctrlp like this. And %:p:h expands to the parent directory of the current file.\n. Hmm, the 1.7.0 branch is an experimental branch, it's buggy and slower than master. You shouldn't use it. It also doesn't have any change related to the invocation mapping (no changes in plugin/ctrlp.vim). And this option has been pretty much the same since 1.0. So just make sure you put the let g:ctrlp_map = '<c-;>' in your .vimrc and restart Vim.\nAlso, <c-p> is only used for completion in Insert mode. In Normal mode, <c-p> is just a duplicate of k.\n. If <F9> works fine then the plugin's mapping mechanism is working fine in your setup. There's a <c-p> mapping or not doesn't matter because it isn't used.\nSo the question is with the <c-;> key. I simply can't map it at all. For example, pressing <c-;> does nothing with this mapping:\nvim\nnnoremap <c-;> :echo 12345<cr>\nVim started with --noplugin -u blank.txt where blank.txt only has set nocp .\n:nmap shows n <C-;> * :echo 12345<CR>.\nI guess you'll just have to choose a different key to map. No idea how the 1.7.0 branch could possibly make the key work for you, though (it doesn't for me). In any case, I don't think this is a bug to be fixed.\n. You can use g:ctrlp_root_markers to set it:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_root_markers = ['.git']\n.git will be put in front of the queue and searched for before the defaults.\n. Seems to work fine for me. Please provide steps to reproduce and your configuration for both plugins.\nThanks!\n. Closing this now for lack of information. Plus ctrlp and minibufexpl work perfectly fine together in my normal environment and also when running Vim in default with just the 2 plugins. And since no one else has complained about this, I think it's probably something else on your end.\n. This has already been worked around with this commit cbbf039 in response to another issue. Next time, please update the plugin before filling bug reports.\n. A cache system already exists. Please read :help g:ctrlp_use_caching and the nearby options.\n. It's not possible, yet. But I'm going to add it, perhaps with a new key { 'sort': 0 }. For now, if you need to do some testing, try commenting out the cal sort(lines, 's:mixedsort') line in the Render() function.\n. 1. You can specify 1 directory: :CtrlP /var/www/some-site/some/path/inside. Can't do multiple directories and it's a little too late to implement that.\n2. You should do this with your vimrc. Just add some mappings for the commands.\n3. This can already be done with:\n   1. Run :CtrlP ~/dir-with-session-files/\n   2. Select a session file.\n   3. Type :so\\ % in the ctrlp prompt.\n   4. Press <cr>.\nBut the feature is too specific, I'm not going to write an extension for it or add it to ctrlp.\n. You can do completion like this ap<tab>as<tab>sty<tab>. Or if app/assets/stylesheets/ is the selected match, you can press <c-z> then type my_new_file.css and <c-y>. The second method is described in more details at :help ctrlp-input-formats|/f).\nHowever, expanding from ap/as/sty to app/assets/stylesheets/ with a single keypress is very problematic. I won't add it.\n. You can disable zooming to a project's root by setting g:ctrlp_working_path_mode to 0. This can't be changed if you're already inside the prompt.\n\nHow can I order CtrlP to search files only in current directory on demand?\n\nTry mapping something to :CtrlP . or :CtrlPCurWD and use that when you need to search in the current directory.\nAs for the / or \\, you have to submit them, not just type them out. They are also only of use when the path_mode option is 1 (in any other case they do nothing when submitted).\n. I have no idea. But it maybe that the cache just wasn't cleared and you were seeing an older index. You can use <F5> inside the prompt to refresh it.\n. This sounds great but it's very difficult to make it reliable enough to be worthwhile. I definitely won't add it. Besides, you can already list untracked files with git ls-files:\ngit ls-files . --cached --exclude-standard --others\nThis should work the same everywhere provided that you have Git installed, including on Windows.\n. ctrlp only looks for first matches. If report.cs isn't in the result list it won't get sorted. But the files in the result list do get sorted according to filename's length.\nThis is by design and can't be fixed.\nFor a solution, you can type report.cs<c-r> which should bring up every file ends with report.cs.\n. I suppose you have a lot of report.cs in paths as well (when in regex mode, report.cs is searched for literally, except the .). So try <c-d>, it should limit to matching only filenames.\n. Yes, I get that. ctrlp already does compare filename's length AND the length of the matched part, but this simply can't be done on the whole list.\nThe regex mode and filename mode are usually enough to workaround that. But in your case, you'll have be more specific with the search string. Since you have too many report.cs's, don't use just it. Try something like ^report.cs or ^report.cs$ in regex + filename mode.\n. Nope, it isn't supposed to work. The prompt is a pseudo-prompt and only the mappings that have been defined work.\nThere are a few built-in pasting actions you can use, however:\n- Paste the word under the cursor in the current buffer: <insert> or <F2>\n- Paste from search register: <F3>\n- Paste the content of the last visual selection: <F4>\n- Paste from clipboard: <F6>\nUpdate: As of v1.7.6, these mappings have been replaced with the <c-\\> mapping, with the exceptions of <Insert> and <MiddleMouse> now mapped to paste-from-clipboard.\n. It doesn't sort when the prompt is empty. But after you start typing, the results are sorted like in other file modes (shortest match, etc). I'll see if I should change it to 'never' sort.\n. > I would have thought the 'obvious' solution would be to show matches sorted by MRU. Is that possible?\nIn MRU mode, no sorting means the order is defaulted to MRU, but only MRU.\n. So I choose a middleground instead of relying solely on MRU order. Let me know how it works for you.\n. > if I type 'coffee' at the CtrlP prompt, the first choice will be the most recently used file that matches.\nIdeally, but it's really not that simple. If a newer file does match 'coffee', regardless of it being the file you want or not, or of it being the worst match in the list, relying on MRU order alone will always make it the top choice simply because it's the newest.\n. > I'm looking for the most recent match - period. If I have to type some more characters to get to my file, that's OK - because in most cases, I won't have to.\nThat settles it, I guess. I've added an option to disable sorting. But personally, I've always run into the problem in my previous comment (for a while, ctrlp used to not sorting files in MRU mode). It was why I changed this in the first place, since I use MRU a lot myself.\n. It's to keep the matching simple and relatively fast. There's really nothing else.\nAnd as I said before, I'm pretty much done with this part (won't be improving it, at least not significantly). If you want to take a stab at something different, check out the g:ctrlp_match_func option.\n. Thanks for the suggestion! I've added some default ignores. But if the max_files limit is lowered, more people will have issues like #163.\n. This would be too far away from what ctrlp does and how it works, it\nwouldn't even fit as an extension. You should just use grep.vim or ack.vim\netc. Also, this isn't the first time this has been suggested, but thanks\nnonetheless!\n2012/4/26 Enrique Garc\u00eda <\nreply@reply.github.com\n\nWould it be possible to make a ctrlp extension that allowed \"finding in\nfiles\" instead of just finding files by path? I'm thinking about typing\nstuff and having the equivalent of a \"grep -r stuff .\" happening on the\nctrlp buffer.\nThat's what I'm missing the most in my vim these days.\nI'd give this a try myself, but I know null vimscript.\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/issues/180\n. That's kind of how it works. .git has a higher priority than .bzr, and in this case .git is found first, at \"parent\". So parent is identified as the true root of the project. If you want it to look for .bzr first, use this:\n\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_root_markers = ['.bzr/']\n. OK, I'm closing this as the behavior is intended. For a while, ctrlp used to look for all markers in a directory then if nothing was found, moved up to the parent dir. But this allowed the user less control over which should be the root. It always zoomed to the first .git or .bzr no matter what.\nCurrently, if you want \"parent\" to be the absolute root, you can create a marker file parent/.root then put it in the option let g:ctrlp_root_markers = ['.root'] (add .root to .gitignore, too if you don't want it to be committed).\nAnd if you don't want that but the opposite, then use let g:ctrlp_root_markers = ['.bzr/', ...], where ... can be any VCS type you have under \"parent\". Place the ... type before .bzr/ if you have it under .bzr as well.\n. I solve this in some of the extensions by converting {\"title\": \"foo\", \"value\": 1 } to a string like foo<tab>|1| where <tab> is a tab character. Then in ctrlp#xxx#accept, parse the foo<tab>|1| string and get back the title foo and value 1. Also in ext_var, use { 'type': 'tabe' } so that the matching is only against the foo part.\nAn example of this is the line.vim extension.\nBut accepting a different type of variable for ctrlp#xxx#init will require a lot of code changes. Not sure if I want to do that.\n. Then add an id to each candidate, like so:\nvim\nlet s:list = [\n\\ { \"id\": 1, \"title\": \"foo\", \"value\": {...nested datas...} },\n\\ { \"id\": 2, \"title\": \"foo\", \"value\": {...nested datas...} },\n\\ { \"id\": 3, \"title\": \"foo\", \"value\": {...nested datas...} },\n\\ ]\nreturn map(copy(s:list), 'v:val.title   |v:val.id|')\nWhere the returned list looks like this:\nvim\nreturn [\n\\ \"foo  |1|\",\n\\ \"foo  |2|\",\n\\ \"foo  |3|\",\n\\ ]\n. Yes, it's not elegant to use s:list, but the alternative means a lot of code changes in the main script. Also, in newer Vim, you can use v:key instead of adding an id to each candidate.\nAnd if you want to ignore the |1|, |2|, |3| part when searching, then use { 'type': 'tabe' }.\n. OK, closing as I've decided against adding support for different var types. The entries have to be reformatted anyhow, let's just do it in the extensions. And s:vars are already used for caching in some extensions, it's really not a big deal to use more.\n. Thanks! I'll try to include this in filename mode instead of introducing a new mode. Will probably go with using ;.\n. I've added those to the readme on the extensions branch. There aren't enough for a separate page, I think.\n. It's molokai: https://github.com/tomasr/molokai\n. You can just remap the keys:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings = {\n    \\ 'AcceptSelection(\"e\")': ['<c-v>', '<2-LeftMouse>'],\n    \\ 'AcceptSelection(\"v\")': ['<cr>', '<RightMouse>'],\n    \\ }\nThe defaults are at :help g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings.\n. Please read :help g:ctrlp_max_height.\n. To be fair, vimscript itself is kind of hacked together. But anyway, thanks!\n. This has been asked and explained many times. The matching is as good as it gets. Please look into the old issues if you want to find out the reasons.\n. You can use wildignore and g:ctrlp_custom_ignore to filter stuff. Please read:\nvim\n:help wildignore\n:help g:ctrlp_custom_ignore\n:help g:ctrlp_dotfiles\n. Oh I see. Well, unless Vim provides MIME types recognition by default which it doesn't, this will have to be done manually (either in a plugin or in a vimrc file). But I don't think I want to do this in ctrlp, sorry!\n. > pretty useless for ctrlp to show files that Vim cannot even edit\nIt's not just for ctrlp but that's exactly what wildignore is there for. Every file listing plugin and many of Vim's commands and functions rely on this option. What you want is more than any existing plugin or Vim can provide, so by all means, write a new plugin. I'm pretty sure there is no MIME type detection plugin out there, yet, so it might be something worth making.\n. Hmm, it's a suggested solution to always enable the highlighting. If you have/want this highlighting disabled in a few buffers then maybe you shouldn't use these autocmds in the first place?\n\nCan you open the issue tracker on the repo?\n\nIt's closed because I don't want to provide support for it. The script's simply a rewrite of the older scripts with a few things added on top. If anyone wants to improve it, please send a pull request instead.\nThanks!\n. Pulled.\nThanks!\n. You can either use <tab> to auto-complete the directories in foo/bar/ (type f<tab>b<tab>). Or mark the foo/bar/baz.txt file with <c-z> then simply type bazooo.txt and press <c-y>.\nSince it can already be done, I won't merge this. Thanks for making it, though.\n. Then use the second method. It requires even less keystrokes: <c-z>bazooo.txt vs. <c-\\>D/bazooo.txt.\nThe description is at :help ctrlp-input-formats|/f).\n. Yes, all the parent directories will be created if not yet exist. So if you use baz/baz2/bazooo.txt then baz/ and baz2/ will be created under foo/bar/.\nAnd again, all of this can be found at :help ctrlp-input-formats|/f).\n. It's kind of too late for that. I've coded everything around the fact that the 3 default modes are permanent and the others are optional. It's not only the part in ctrlp#setlines().\nFor your problem, you can just map these 3 modes to a few mappings. And maybe reserve the <c-f> <c-b> for the extensions if you don't want to map them as well.\n. Thanks mattn!\n. ctrlp provides an option to rebuild its statuslines, g:ctrlp_status_func, which powerline uses. By the look of it, something triggers fugitive (script 128) to break, leading to its statusline feature breaking, which in turn breaks powerline and then finally ctrlp (script 187).\nSo before starting ctrlp with :CtrlP [dir], run :let g:ctrlp_status_func = {} and let me know if it fixes the problem. Also, run :echo g:ctrlp_status_func after you exit ctrlp and post the output here.\nAfter the above, restart Vim, this time run :let g:ctrlp_log = 1 and then proceed to reproduce the problem. After creating a few error msgs, exit ctrlp and go to the cache directory (should be $HOME/.cache/ctrlp), open the ctrlp.log file and post its content here.\n. OK, I can't reproduce this with the combo conqueterm + ctrlp + powerline + fugitive. I use the settings for conqueterm and powerline found here.\nGuess this will depend on you to track it down, then. The :CtrlP [dir] is handled with the SetWD function. With a [dir] argument, it should return at Line 4: cal ctrlp#setdir(a:1) | retu. It's odd though, because ctrlp#setdir is called later on anyway if you just use :CtrlP. Why doesn't it break then?\nIn any case, it's important to get all the error messages, especially the first ones that create the \"Press ENTER or type command\" prompt.\n. Just a guess, so let me know if this changes anything. For autoload/ctrlp.vim:\n``` diff\n@@ -1115,16 +1115,19 @@ fu! ctrlp#statusline()\n        \\ exists('s:marked') ?

Can't stop using it just to workaround this. \n  The same goes for :lcd, it's needed to make sure no working directory is clobbered.\n- It's an edge case compatibility issue, specifically with skwp/vim-ruby-conque, and the error actually comes from fugitive (which uses a naked readfile()).\nFor the error in the GUI, I noticed it when working on preserving v:errmsg so it should already be fixed in 80bc9cea8c.\n.

If you have a working solution for your problem then just use it. There's no need to report it or contact me.\n. Implementing this in ctrlp would be a bit needlessly complicated, I think. You can easily solve your problem with a couple of mappings that map to :CtrlP %:h and :CtrlP without a <cr> (you can expand the path after :CtrlP with <tab>). So instead of cd'ing inside ctrlp, do it when starting ctrlp.\nAlso, you can use b:ctrlp_working_path_mode to set this option per buffer, and use the directory mode to change the working directory inside ctrlp.\n. Shouldn't that be let g:ctrlp_working_path_mode = 1?\n. OK, just for completeness, guess it's actually what you meant but you should use double quotes instead of single quotes for the part after -c, otherwise 'let is interpreted as a mark :'l.\n.

Is the directory on a network share of some kind?\n. OK, since it only happens on one of your machines, it's either an environment thing or there's something wrong with your Vim's configuration. Either way, I'm going to leave this to you to track it down.\nIf your Vim's config is different on this new machine, you can try to isolate the problem by following the steps in my post here #46.\n. See :help g:ctrlp_open_multiple_files and :help g:ctrlp_arg_map.\n. If you don't mind I'd like to see your MyPathFilter function, and MyPathShorten as well if you have one.\n. It looks great but it's a bit too much, I think. And by default, it doesn't actually solve the initial problem.\nI've added a custom pathshorten function, hope it's enough. I'm not pulling this because there isn't a good reason to have the option. Those lines are only for visually identifying the entries and aren't used for matching or much else. So there's little point in allowing users to reformat them.\n. Pulled to my local repo for future reference. Closing for now.\n. There isn't a way in ctrlp, plus I think this is something that you should do in your own Vim configuration. Try looking into local .vimrc files (people usually name them .lvimrc or .vimrc.local), also check out :help 'exrc'.\n. Can you let me know your OS, Vim version and most importantly the output of :echo &term?\nThis is related to how the arrow keys are handled by your terminal. Pressing the keys usually emits ^[ or <esc> followed by a sequence of characters: http://www.termsys.demon.co.uk/vtansi.htm#cursor\nThere isn't much that can be done to workaround this, but I can try including your &term on this line. If you're comfortable with editing the script, put your &term value on that line and let me know if it works.\nIf it doesn't work, then use <c-j> and <c-k> to move the selection instead of using the arrow keys.\n. Not sure if I want to change that since we can use the root_markers option for it. See my answer in issue #166.\n. Have you installed any Vim plugin before? Don't drop the entire CtrlP.vim folder into ~/.vim/plugin. The content of each of the plugin/, doc/, autoload/ folder is supposed to go into the corresponding folder under ~/.vim.\nAlso, I recommend looking into using a plugin manager early on. For example, vundle is a good one.\n. I see your point, but the text is actually a bit longer than that:\n\nExtract the archive to ~/.vim on Linux/MacOSX or $HOME\\vimfiles on Windows.\n\nIt's the little instruction that you see everywhere for extracting stuff. And it really means what it says, that is extracting the content of the archive into the ~/.vim directory. Just follow it to the letter.\n. Yes, it's because ctrlp only started to have extensions after 1.6.1. But again, for the love of everything, DO NOT unpack the entire directory structure (autoload, doc, etc) into the ~/.vim/plugin directory.\nI've made sure the ctrlp.zip archive doesn't have a subdir holding everything, so that you can do something like this unzip ctrlp.zip -d ~/.vim.\n. Have you done the following things?\n- Update the plugin.\n- Refresh the cache (<F5> while in the ctrlp window) after you've added the option. Restart Vim if you want to be sure.\n. OK, this works:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_custom_ignore = 'vendor/bundles/\\(DontIgnore\\)\\@!.\\+$'\nAnd this doesn't:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_custom_ignore = 'vendor/\\(bundles/DontIgnore\\)\\@!.\\+$'\nThe reason is because vendor/bundles also matches vendor/\\(bundles/DontIgnore\\)\\@!.\\+$.\nBasically, the second pattern means matching any \"vendor/\" not followed by \"bundles/DontIgnore\". A vendor/bundles alone fits this description, thus the entire vendor/bundles directory tree is removed when the scanner's scanning the vendor directory.\nSo the first pattern is the one you want.\n. How about you just try the thing out?\n\nThere are in fact, many folders in vendor/ to ignore, MyBundle is the only one to not ignore.\n\nDoesn't vendor/bundles/\\(DontIgnore\\)\\@!.\\+$ fit that perfectly? It matches any \"vendor/bundles/\" not followed by \"MyBundle\".\nHow do you think path matching is?\n. Oh, right, I missed this part: many folders in vendor/ to ignore.\nHow about vendor/\\(bundles\\)\\@!.\\+$\\|vendor/bundles/\\(MyBundle\\)\\@!.\\+$ then?\n. @balta2ar: Try \\v(\\.cpp|\\.h|\\.hh|\\.cxx)@<!$.\n. @balta2ar: Yeah, I missed a <. Already edited my comment right after but was a little too slow :)\n. @balta2ar: OK, it's a bit trickier than I thought. This should work, tested and all that:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_custom_ignore = { 'file': '\\v(\\.cpp|\\.h|\\.hh|\\.cxx)@<!$' }\nRestart Vim or run :unlet g:ctrlp_custom_ignore if you get the \"E706: Variable type mismatch\" error.\nBTW, not sure what's going on with github, I keep not getting any notifications for new comments, even for yours that mention my username.\n. @balta2ar: The notifications appear in my github inbox, there's just no orange boxes. I only saw your 3 days old comment when I checked the inbox for someone's comment that I also didn't see.\n. Please read :help ctrlp-mappings.\n. You should type templateemail without that whitespace in the middle. If you type it without the whitespace but still get the literal string behavior, then make sure you aren't in regexp mode (use <c-r> to toggle).\n. OK, I'm going to assume it was the whitespace. Either way, I'm closing this because the fuzzy has been working fine. The plugin has been around for almost a year, people would have flipped if something so basic wasn't working as advertised, don't you think?\nAlso, about the g:ctrlp_match_func option, it's meant to be used to employ an external matcher, something more powerful than the internal Vimscript one which is the major bottleneck in ctrlp. It's not meant to be a cop-out for the slightest of things, nor for the basic functionalities.\nOne of the little things that convinced me to expose the option was the Windows-only search tool \"Everything\", which can search in millions of files and directories, i.e. entire hard drives, extremely fast. Although I don't think Everything can be used with ctrlp, I still want to make it possible to use the power of such tools when the time comes and more of them are around.\n. They link to files in the same working directory, there will be duplicates\nif they are included. Why do you want to include them?\nI suppose you mean symlinks in the working directory but they link to files\noutside, in that case take a look at the g:ctrlp_follow_symlinks option.\nOn Thu, Jun 14, 2012 at 4:23 PM, georgexsh <\nreply@reply.github.com\n\nwrote:\nCurrently all same-root symlinks are excluded, ref b22ebbe\nI don't get reasons behind this behavior, though I'd link those symlinks\nto be included.\nMaybe addming another option to control it?\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/issues/215\n. OK, I can always let the follow_symlinks option take another value, say 2, to follow all symlinks indiscriminately. I just want to understand the reasons.\n\nCan you explain why you would want to include both of these?\n/root/working-directory/symlink\n/root/working-directory/mytextfile\nWhere /root/working-directory/symlink pointed to /root/working-directory/mytextfile.\nThey would appear like this in ctrlp, and select any of the files would open mytextfile:\nsymlink\nmytextfile\n. I see. Thanks! I'll add the value soon.\n. Actually, the counter isn't real time, it only gets updated when the scanning of a directory depth is finished. When it hangs like that it basically means it's still scanning, and that directory depth just has a lot of files.\nSo yeah, no way to workaround because that's just how the counter works.\nAs for speeding this whole process up, take a look at the g:ctrlp_user_command option. Also, after the first scan of a directory tree, the refresh will be much faster because the OS caches the results.\n. Thanks! Glad you like it!\nAlso, since you restart Vim often, check out the clear_cache_on_exit option, see if setting it to 0 helps.\n. It is not yet possible to do this with the default_input option, I'll enable it regardless but would it be simple enough? It would work with every command, including :CtrlP and those that already accept a directory or a buffer name:\nvim\nnn <silent> ,d :let g:ctrlp_default_input = expand('<cword>')<cr>:CtrlPBufTag<cr>\nUsing a command argument would be heavy on the coding side, but the mappings would look like these:\nvim\nnn <silent> ,d :exe \"CtrlPBufTag \".expand('<cword>')<cr>\nnn <silent> ,d :exe \"CtrlPBufTag -default-text=\".expand('<cword>')<cr>\nAlso, currently you can insert <cword> through using the <c-\\> mapping inside the prompt.\n. Thanks for the pull request! But this is kind of pointless. en and fini are the short forms of endif and finish, and they are just as valid, see :help :en and :help :fini. And being listed as a valid command in Vim's help is safe enough, I think.\n. Have you cleared the cache after setting the options? Try pressing <F5> inside the prompt or restart Vim, just to be sure.\n\nI thought these settings were supposed to help eliminate unwanted files from showing up in the results.\n\nThey are, and they have been working perfectly fine pretty much since introduction. The only problem people have had is not knowing about clearing the cache.\n. I also have had image files ignored with wildignore for a really long time now because I do web works, this line among others has worked without any problem in ctrlp and everywhere else:\nvim\nset wildignore+=*.zip,*.rar,*.gz,*.png,*.gif,*.jpg\nPlease try the following:\n- Update the plugin to the current HEAD of master.\n- Clear the cache with :CtrlPClearAllCaches.\n- Start Vim with minimal configuration like this:\nvim --noplugin -u path/to/a/simple/.vimrc\nUse this as the content of the above .vimrc:\n``` vim\n  set nocp\n  set runtimepath^=~/.vim/bundle/ctrlp.vim\n  runtime! plugin/ctrlp.vim\nset wildignore+=/tmp/,.so,.swp,.zip,.jpg,.gif,.png,*.pdf\n  let g:ctrlp_custom_ignore = {\n    \\ 'dir':  '.git$\\|.hg$\\|.svn$',\n    \\ 'file': '.png$\\|.gif$\\|.jpg$',\n    \\ }\n  ```\nThen try to reproduce the problem.\nAlso, try this both before and while using Vim in minimal configuration:\n1. cd into the app/assets/images/ directory.\n2. Try using tab completion: type :edit grid.p<tab> where <tab> is the <tab> key.\n   In both times, see if grid.p is auto-completed to grid.png or not.\n. Thanks! I'm going to go ahead and close this one now. For one, whatever the external source that causes globpath() to fail to obey wildignore probably isn't something I can address in ctrlp anyway. I mean if calling globpath(path, expr) suddenly isn't enough to apply wildignore then what is there to do?\nHowever, if you manage to track down the plugin or config that causes this, then please do leave a comment.\n. Ah, I thought of this before, but unfortunately Vimscript can't be run asynchronously. So no, it's not possible to build or rebuild cache in the background, or doing anything in the background for that matter.\nI think my closest attempt at this was to run the needed commands in another Vim instance through the client/server interface. I abandoned the idea because it was difficult to reliably implement for everyone. But if I remember correctly, it kind of worked.\nIf anyone wants to try, check :help remote_send. Basically, you just need to send the :CtrlP /path/to/build/cache<cr> string to the other Vim instance.\n. Alright, closing.\nAlso, as an addendum, to clear cache and rebuild, you can send :CtrlPClearCache<cr>:CtrlP /path/to/rebuild/cache<cr>. And to close the match window after the rebuild, send :winc c<cr>.\n. Close to a million entries is simply too many. ctrlp or vimscript can't handle that, at least with our current hardware. And I don't think there is any way to use vim's native tag jump in ctrlp.\nSo I suppose you just don't do it, don't use it for large tag files.\n. That'd require a pretty big code change, I think. Plus I don't really like making more special cases for the input.\nFor an alternative solution, you can use something like this:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_cmd = 'exe \"CtrlP\".get([\"\", \"Tag\", \"BufTag\"], v:count)'\nThen pressing <c-p> will run :CtrlP, 1<c-p> will run :CtrlPTag and 2<c-p> will run :CtrlPBufTag. So technically it's still 1 mapping, and for example, instead of typing <c-p>t anystring, type 1<c-p>anystring.\n. OK, closing. This won't be added. There's nothing in the current code that can support or extend into it. I probably won't accept a patch for something like f anystring or #f anystring either. It's a big code change for a rather small convenience.\nBut in any case, there'll need to be new unique and memorable identifiers for all the extensions, user made ones as well, i.e. the t, f, bt... that you suggest. This isn't much difference from predefining a bunch of mappings, in the sense that you have to memorize something. And if you have to memorize something anyway, then just memorize your mappings instead of the identifiers. And I hope that doesn't affect your workflow negatively.\n. Those are just the first files found in the directory. There's nothing special whatsoever. What you want is MRU mode, or Buffer mode would be suffice. Also, for that exact use case you have, you can just use Vim's <c-w>T, this will move the mistakenly opened split to a new tabpage instead.\n. No, they are just the ones that happen to be on the top of the returned list. And thanks for the idea, I'll think about it.\n. Thank you! I've made the current behavior optional instead. The new option is g:ctrlp_tabpage_position.\n. The basic usage on the homepage and in the readme should be enough, I think. All the pages link to each other anyway.\nFor your problem, please see #220. Most likely it's the cache. If it isn't then if you can, do some tests and help me track down the culprit.\nThanks!\n. You're correct, it's capped at the max height. That's pretty much how it works. The match window simply shows a few of the matches. To show more you can just change the max height option. I don't think I want to change this behavior now and make the window scrollable, mainly for performance reasons.\n. When g:ctrlp_dotfiles is disabled, all dotdirs under the working directory are ignored, no exception. The current file you are editing is in a dotdir or not doesn't matter. So basically what you want here is for ctrlp to make an exception for the directory of the current file being edited, and to disregard the g:ctrlp_dotfiles option in that case.\n\nI would expect that when g:ctrlp_dotfiles is disabled, ctrlp wouldn't look past a dotfolder for a root marker.\n\nOK, why would it do that? What if people genuinely want to root to .git? What you expect is for the finding root feature to unexpectedly break when the current file you're editing happens to be in a dotdir.\nIf you often have files you want to search for inside dotdirs, then just don't reset g:ctrlp_dotfiles. But if you insist on setting it to 0, then use something like :CtrlP %:h to start ctrlp in those special cases.\nThis isn't a bug as the ignoring works exactly as it should. And I don't think want to add an option for this because it's simple to workaround.\n. Latex isn't a default filetype so you'll have to set the arguments to use to call ctags as well. You can set them with the g:ctrlp_buftag_types option.\n. Duplicate of #196. You're supposed press Enter (<cr>) to submit the dots.\n. No worries! At least searching is a bit easier now thanks to this :)\n. I'm still undecided, but I might look into adding options for defining custom opening functions so that this can be configured.\nHowever, if I decide not to add any option, this can still be done within an extension. One that only shows files it has a special opening command available for.\n. I've added an option. This is probably as far as I'm going to go with this feature.\nHere's an example function to open HTML files in the default web browser from the <c-o> prompt:\n``` vim\nfunction! HTMLOpenFunc(action, line)\n    if a:action == 'x'\n    if fnamemodify(a:line, ':e') =~? '^html\\?$'\n        \" Get the filename\n        let filename = fnameescape(fnamemodify(a:line, ':p'))\n\n        \" Close CtrlP\n        call ctrlp#exit()\n\n        \" Open the file\n        silent! execute '!xdg-open' filename\n    else\n        \" Not a HTML file, simulate pressing <c-o> again\n        call feedkeys(\"\\<c-o>\")\n    endif\n\nelse\n\n    \" Use CtrlP's default file opening function\n    call call('ctrlp#acceptfile', [a:action, a:line])\n\nendif\n\nendfunction\nlet g:ctrlp_open_func = { 'files': 'HTMLOpenFunc' }\n``\n. @mMontu: no, the MRU list only records buffers that you open in Vim. But I'll see if it makes sense to allow adding items manually, since this probably won't be used for anything else.\n. @mMontu: I've added a new function:ctrlp#mrufiles#add(). You can call it, for example, after the file opening line in theHTMLOpenFuncfunction above. Usecall ctrlp#mrufiles#add(filename).\n. @mMontu: Sorry to disappoint you, but those are only visual cues :) For example, the top level folds with*have multiple functions, and the ones with-only have one function. The foldmethod is justmarkerwith the default markers{{{,}}}, enforced by the modeline.\n. Did you test with the same buffer in the first window and in the current window? Does it make any difference if you setg:ctrlp_switch_buffer` to 0?\nEither way, can you provide steps to reproduce and the window layout (the positions and the file/buffer of each window) you have when opening the entries? Take a couple of screenshots if you can.\n. I see. With the switch_buffer option on, the cursor will be moved to the first window that has the buffer when an opening command is issued. It's very similar to running :sb when Vim's switchbuf has useopen.\nThis is still kind of counter intuitive with :e, though. I'll change it.\n. > I can open the file manually and then use the :CtrlPMixed command to find the file like normal.\nHave you cleared the cache after setting the options? You can either press <F5> in the match window or run :CtrlPClearAllCaches from Vim's command line.\n. Yes, definitely. Now I just have to decide which other items should be on it.\n. @timc3 @screwzm Have you guys increased the max_file limit before clearing the cache? That's pretty important.\n. @screwzm by default, ctrlp also set its own local working directory. Take a look at g:ctrlp_working_path_mode and g:ctrlp_root_markers.\n. @screwzm a blank window containing a unnamed buffer including the first one when you start Vim normally, is always reusable by default.\n. @screwzm then it's probably not a normal blank window. CtrlP only avoids replacing a buffer if it's a special buffer (unlisted with a non-empty buftype other than \"help\"), or has unsaved changes without hidden or autowrite set.\n. That dialog is a Vim's built-in feature that's triggered automatically. See :help tag-matchlist and check the example output under :tselect. And because these commands only accept the tag name, it's really hard to differentiate 2 tags with the same name in different files.\nThe tag extension has a workaround for this, but apparently it doesn't always work.\nCan you provide a test case including the tag names, the filenames, the tag files and their locations?\n.

But I haven't updated my git installation for more than a year, so maybe that's the reason.\n. Great, thanks! I'll push this to master soon once I'm sure there isn't any side effect.\n. @jszakmeister can you provide a test case like Jeroen did in the 3rd comment?\n. Looks like you're using an older commit without the above fix. Make sure to update to HEAD of master, and let me know if you still see the issue.\n. I still can't reproduce it by following the steps in your test. And oddly enough, the old version can also get the tag count from your tags file (meaning no Vim's tag-matchlist dialog).\nWhat's the full path to file1.py and file2.py? And what does :pwd return after you open gVim?\n. Please try starting gvim with this:\ngvim --noplugin -u path/to/a/simple/.vimrc\nUse this as the content of the above .vimrc:\nvim\nset nocp\nruntime! plugin/ctrlp.vim\nJust make sure the parent directory of plugin is in your runtimepath, for example ~/.vim.\nSee if you still get the tag-matchlist.\n. It might be something that changes the tags option (see :help 'tags'), or the working directory. I'm honestly not sure.\n. Ah I see. Thanks! When cst is set, :tag uses :cstag which in turn performs :tjump. And :tjump always shows tag-matchlist when there are 2 or more similarly named tags.\nSince tag.vim only works with tags files, it might be a good idea to reset that option when using :tag.\n. You can by pressing <F5> in MRU mode. A bit hidden but this is mentioned in the doc at :help ctrlp-mappings.\n. In answer to your initial question, no, it's not possible. The prompt_mappings option is only meant for the mappings you see in the ctrlp-mappings section in the doc. You also shouldn't remap <space> because it's one of the keys used for inputting, and there isn't a way to map it only in one mode.\nYou may, however, use the followings which work in all modes, but be warned that you're not supposed to do this:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings = { 'PrtAdd(\".*\")': ['<space>'] }\n\" or\nlet g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings = { 'PrtAdd(\".*\")': ['<c-@>'] }\nOtherwise, just type .* directly.\n. This actually isn't a typo as I purposely changed it pretty early on. You can see this in the doc here, and here. The long form's kept in the code because I don't want to break people's mappings.\n. Yes, there isn't a way to change the autocomplete, otherwise I'd have done it as well. And technically you were right, there isn't a :CtrlPMRU defined, it's just an abbreviation of :CtrlPMRUFiles which I think is slightly more difficult to remember.\n. Those autocmds work fine for me. I also use some autocmds to restore cursor position and folds and never had a problem.\nCan you consistently reproduce this? If you can, please provide a test case including the buffers you have open, how you move away and reopen them with ctrlp.\n. If I understand your situation correctly, you have a .git directory at your home directory? And the svn project is in a subdirectory also under your home directory? If that's correct, just put .svn in the root_markers option:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_root_markers = ['.svn']\nAs for why, see my answers in issue #181. But now I think I might need to change this a bit. It seems like a lot of people expect it to work without the priority thing.\n. No, there's no other way with the plugin. But if you can, update your project and SVN install. From SVN 1.7, there's only one .svn directory at the root of the project: http://subversion.apache.org/docs/release-notes/1.7.html#single-db\nAnyway, I'll be making some changes to remove markers' priority so that people using multiple VCS'es won't have to put .svn, .bzr, ... in the root_markers option. This option will be reserved for the .root type of markers.\n. @danielb2: The number on the left is the total number of files found until the last directory depth.\nHow do you tell ctrlp to only search for .php files?\nAlso, the root_markers option is only for determining the local working directory inside ctrlp, it has no impact on the indexing. Unless of course the new root (with root_markers) is a parent directory of the old root (without root_markers), then the indexing being slower is simply because the parent directory has more files.\nP.S. I wasn't ignoring this, btw. For some reason I didn't get any notification for your comment, so I only saw it just now.\n. @prezjordan: It's an optional feature which you can disable. See :help g:ctrlp_working_path_mode.\n. No, it's not possible. This is pretty much what regexp mode is meant for: giving users control over the exact search patterns. You can just type app.*a\\.xml.\n. This simply can't be done. Vim is single threaded. Things can't be run in the background because there isn't a background to begin with. Everything happens in Vim happens in the same thread as your text editing actions.\n. Hmm, sounds like you have a different definition of \"background threads\". Things that you don't see running are not things running in a background thread. And I'm pretty sure the linters are simply fast enough so you don't notice the delay most of the times.\n. Oh I see. But it's simply impossible with Vimscript because Vim itself is single threaded.\n. AsyncCommand uses --remote. Basically, it runs the needed commands in another Vim instance. This also requires Vim built with +clientserver.\nThe top answer in the stackoverflow quesion also offers the same thing: :!gvim -c 'MyMake', this starts another Vim instance.\n. Well, I just don't think it's reliable enough to implement within the plugin. But yeah, try it in your own configuration if you want, see if it works for you.\n. Yes. But I'm not completely against the idea. It's just not on a todo list.\n. I can't reproduce and there has not been any issue related to ctrlp's buffer local options. Please test with a clean environment to make sure this is a ctrlp's problem.\n. Did you also test with a minimal .vimrc? Or with simply using :edit to open the files?\nMake sure you don't have a set number line somewhere in your .vimrc before the set rnu line.\nIt still looks to me like it has something to do with your configuration. A single set rnu in .vimrc works for me (like it does for someone else here). And given how often this option is highlighted as a cool feature of Vim 7.3, a lot more people would have reported this if it came from having set rnu alone.\n. No, there isn't a way. Spaces are a part of the search pattern because they can be in a filename.\n. I see. I did study fuzzyfinder while writing ctrlp, many of ctrlp's features are my own interpretations of fuzzyfinder's. So for the most part, I'm sure you won't miss much.\nCheers!\n. > Maybe mention in the doc that custom_ignore is ignored if user_command is used?\nIt's mentioned, or implied, in the doc under g:ctrlp_custom_ignore and under g:ctrlp_user_command.\n\nVariable type mismatch for: g:ctrlp_custom_ignore\n\nThe options are for users to set. This error can only happen if you set the option twice in one Vim session in different types. The plugin itself does not create g:ctrlp_custom_ignore.\nEdit: OK, I guess you probably don't even know that in Vim we can't set a variable in a different type without :unlet it first, otherwise you wouldn't have associated this error with the plugin as it is completely outside of the plugin's control. See :help E706, and think of the options as simple variables that you need to set.\n. Merged.\nCheers!\n. Can you share your full Vim configuration? Also, let me know the exact steps to reproduce these beginning from starting up Vim.\nLine 17 of BuildPrompt is a redraw command and E68 is related to syntax highlighting so the first problem might have something to do with the other buffers you have open (since redraw affects the whole screen). You can test this by opening ctrlp right after starting up Vim, and try to reproduce the error.\nFor the second problem, does the entire Vim window become jumpy or just the content of the non-ctrlp buffer(s) become jumpy?\n. What OS are you using on this computer? Do you have any customizations for amix's config?\nAlso, from the error msgs, it looks like this starts right from the init step to every action that calls BuildPrompt, including adding and deleting characters.\nI doubt this has anything to do with the cache, but you can try deleting the ctrlp.vim bundle and the cache directory, then clone the plugin again from here.\n. OK, I see. I'm going to need you to help me test these:\n- Instead of using amix's config, start gVim with minimal configuration like this:\ngvim.exe --noplugin -u path/to/a/simple/_vimrc\nYou can add the extra arguments to the gVim shortcut, it works the same as running from a command line.\nUse this as the content of the path/to/a/simple/_vimrc file:\nvim\n  set nocp\n  set runtimepath^=path/to/ctrlp/directory\n  runtime! plugin/ctrlp.vim\nChange the path/to/ctrlp/directory to the location of ctrlp on your system.\nAfter starting gVim, press <c-p> to open ctrlp, then try to reproduce the problem.\n- Instead of the above test, apply this patch and start gVim in your normal configuration, then try to reproduce the problem:\n``` diff\n  diff --git a/autoload/ctrlp.vim b/autoload/ctrlp.vim\n  index b27380d..7bb0627 100644\n  --- a/autoload/ctrlp.vim\n  +++ b/autoload/ctrlp.vim\n  @@ -529,7 +529,7 @@ fu! s:BuildPrompt(upd, ...)\n          \\ : ['CtrlPPrtText', 'CtrlPPrtCursor', base]\n      let hibase = 'CtrlPPrtBase'\n      \" Build it\n  -   redr\n  +   norm! :\n      exe 'echoh' hibase '| echon \"'.base.'\"\n          \\ | echoh' hiactive '| echon \"'.prt[0].'\"\n          \\ | echoh' hicursor '| echon \"'.prt[1].'\"\n  @@ -1597,7 +1597,8 @@ fu! s:insertstr()\n   endf\nfu! s:textdialog(str)\n  -   redr | echoh MoreMsg | echon a:str | echoh None\n  +   norm! :\n  +   echoh MoreMsg | echon a:str | echoh None\n      retu nr2char(getchar())\n   endf\n  ```\nAlso, make absolutely sure you're using the latest version of ctrlp by cloning it directly from here (the ctrlp's commit that amix's config points to is 3 months old).\nLet me know how it goes in each case.\nThanks!\n.

If you do find it, then please leave a comment or just open a new issue. If I can, I'll try to find a workaround for it regardless if it's a ctrlp's problem.\n. Hmm, sounds like it might be related to this powerline issue: https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline/issues/161\nI can't reproduce that, though so I'm not sure if it has something to do with the errors here.\nAs for the coloring issue, I think you should open a new issue with powerline since it is what powerline does. Other than calling a specified function, ctrlp doesn't have much say in how the custom statusline works or looks like.\n. It works fine for me and the code checks out, too. What mapping or command do you use to open ctrlp?\n. I can't reproduce this and I don't see how this part of the code can go wrong. It would be a much more widespread issue if it was straight up broken.\nCan you try deleting and cloning the repo again? And if that doesn't help, please do the following:\n1. Set let g:ctrlp_log = 1 in your .vimrc.\n2. Restart Vim and start ctrlp to try to reproduce the error.\n3. Exit ctrlp and go find the ~/.cache/ctrlp/ctrlp.log file.\n4. Post the content of the ctrlp.log file here.\nThanks!\n. Ping.\nI just need the error log because the E731 doesn't look like it's the only error message. It makes no sense to have this particular error with the current SetWD() function.\nAlso, just to avoid any interference, try starting Vim in minimal configuration like this when getting the error log:\nvim --noplugin -u path/to/a/simple/.vimrc\nUse this as the content of the path/to/a/simple/.vimrc file:\n``` vim\nset nocp\nset runtimepath^=path/to/ctrlp/directory\nruntime! plugin/ctrlp.vim\nlet g:ctrlp_lazy_update = 1\nlet g:ctrlp_max_files = 30000\n``\n. OK, I'm closing this for now due to lack of information. I can only see the E731 error happens there if somehow you use the olderautoload/ctrlp.vimfile with the newerplugin/ctrlp.vimfile, thus passing a Dictionary from:CtrlPto be used as a String with the olderSetWD()(line 3 of it had astrlen()` call).\nBut it makes no sense with the newer autoload/ctrlp.vim because the newer SetWD() always treats its main argument as a Dictionary. There's just no way to create an E731 there, even if trying.\nSo as I see it, it's either an old Vim 7.0 bug which I can't reproduce, or something is getting mixed up in your configuration. If you manage to grab the error log or find out something new or how to consistently reproduce this, please leave a comment and reopen the issue.\n. Hmm, I don't see a point in adding that one pair of movement mappings. The other mappings get a mention because they are somewhat unique to ctrlp, people don't expect and don't look for them.\n. Maybe because they are guessable (hjkl)? But if someone doesn't figure it out, they can always read the mapping help at :help ctrlp-mappings, which is what I prefer people to do.\n. Yes, you can. Check the bundled extensions for examples. Here's the syntax highlighting in bookmarkdir.vim:\nhttps://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/blob/master/autoload/ctrlp/bookmarkdir.vim#L86-99\n. Oh, I see. That's currently only possible with filename related modes (files, buffers, mru etc). It's a bit complicated to highlight matches in other modes because of overlapped highlightings so I just disable it.\nI don't have any plan to enable it any time soon.\n. Yes, that's the spot. But just enabling it like that won't work well in many cases (e.g. it highlights the wrong strings).\n. Well, it's kind of too late for such a big change, or inclusion. Besides, I prefer using a buffer from the very beginning, it's basically the reason ctrlp exists and is what it is. But using a menu to display the results is how fuzzyfinder does it, so if that makes or breaks it for you then you might want to give fuzzyfinder a try.\n. See :help g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings, and also read the note under it regarding <c-h> and <bs>.\n. :CtrlP ., or turn off the root finder with g:ctrlp_working_path_mode.\n. Actually, this is quite a bit different from 159 and is simpler to implement. I can just compare a filename with the patterns in the option and push it down the results list if it matches them.\nBut I really don't want to complicate the matching even more now. In one way or another, this option will have to be checked and compared with on every single change in the search string (i.e. on almost every keystroke).\n. > If 'undordir' is set, the files are created with the same extension as the original file, so wildignore can't be used.\nYou can ignore directories with wildignore, not only files. Try set wig+=*/undo/* (or when ssl exists and is off: set wig+=*\\\\undo\\\\*).\nAs for custom_ignore, because the rtscript extension looks directly for files under &rtp, ignoring directories alone (e.g. with { 'dir': '/undo/' }) won't work. You need something like let g:ctrlp_custom_ignore = '/undo/' which applies to everything (note that set wig+=*/undo/* does, too).\n. Merged. Thank you!\n. I suppose you use g:ctrlp_user_command?\n. What do you mean by \"won't search inside directories\"? Does setting let g:ctrlp_custom_ignore = '' change anything? What's the working directory inside ctrlp when you open it?\nI don't think this has anything to do with 258. He uses g:ctrlp_user_command to get the index from git ls-files.\n. It was because of a change I made to the default ignore rules that covered too much stuff. This should be properly fixed now in b7cb2f5.\n. :CtrlP app/decorators should open ctrlp in app/decorators and :CtrlP app/models should open it in app/models. This is the default behavior.\nYou probably have set autochdir somewhere in your config or a plugin or function that changes the working directory (outside of ctrlp) after opening a file.\n. Thanks! :)\nIf you want to use that autocmd or set autochdir later on, just use an absolute path with the :CtrlP command (since :CtrlP directory is basically :lcd directory). This probably applies to :CommandT, too.\n. It's the root finding feature. You can turn it off with the g:ctrlp_working_path_mode option.\n. This is a known limitation (of this type of prompt). I have to create a mapping for each and every key while the timeoutlen has to be set to 0. Because of these reasons it's not possible to type accented or multibyte chars that require multiple keypresses.\n. @lucapette: No, it's fine. I do take note of everything even if I don't post a reply :) Thank you!\nBut I'm still a bit undecided about the FAQ, actually. Right now, other than the issues with people not knowing about the cache, the other issues only ever show up once or twice, and they are pretty much \"how it is\" kind of things (either something with no workaround or a feature mentioned in the readme and in the help). If they keep showing up more, though, I'll probably put a few into a separate FAQ.md or a wiki page and put a link in the readme.\n. > Expected:\n\nVim opens with the CtrlP prompt open (vim -s enters the keys in the given file after the vimrc has been loaded)\n\nHmm, vim -s file is basically :source! file (note the !), so if you put :CtrlPMixed in that file, Vim will open with :CtrlPMixed in the command line, ready for you to press <cr> (this isn't your expected behavior). So unless every other terminals you've tested for some reason output the /tmp/ctrlp file with Windows' line ending (CR+LF), vim -s file won't ever work the way you expect it to work.\nIn any case, try just typing vim -c \"CtrlPMixed\", or without typing the -c part, just vim and then press <c-p>, instead of going through the extra step of putting the command into a file, which shouldn't work in the first place.\nClosing this because the expected behavior is an incorrect behavior.\n. No, the new line only works if it has a CR character in it like a Windows' line ending, with CR+LF (\\r\\n). The carriage return (CR) will be read as a <cr> in Vim. That's the only way vim -s file is going to do what you're expecting it to do. But on Ubuntu, the new line is only comprised of a LF (\\n).\nI think what you actually meant to use is vim -S file. There's a big difference between -s and -S. And -S does exactly the behavior that you're expecting -s to do here.\nBut anyway, it's up to each person to choose what to use, making sense be damned... old habits die hard and all that. If you choose to keep trying to use vim -s file then who am I to say otherwise?\n. What do you see in Vim when using -S? Also, try vim -c \"CtrlPMixed\".\n\nIf the CR character is not interpreted in the same way as \\n by vim -s.\n\nThat wasn't what I meant. What I meant was that a new line on Ubuntu only has a LF, so vim -s file should never work like you say.\n. Nope, that doesn't ring any bell. I'm sorry but I've no idea what's wrong with your environment at this point. None of the behaviors makes sense. I guess you'll have to settle with not being able to open ctrlp this way.\n. So far it's just yours. And that just adds to the mystery. Since first you said vim -s file worked fine (including with ctrlp) in all other terminals that you'd tested, while it should not. Now both -c and -S don't even work where -s worked. So everything is basically working backward on your set of terminals. And that's what I mean by \"your environment\".\n. Yes, -c and -S work fine for me on multiple OS'es including Ubuntu. Never had a problem.\n. Hmm, why? The tab completion inside the prompt isn't meant to be a replication of :e's. The resulting string is simply used as a search string to search for files and directories under ctrlp's current working directory, that's why it's relative.\n. > if you want to open ANY file you no longer have to think \"Is the file in my current directory or not?\".\nThat's not what ctrlp sets out to do. It doesn't and can't care about files outside of the working directory. Also, CtrlPMixed doesn't include CtrlPDir.\n. This is an intended behavior (done with the :hide command). When the changed buffer is hidden, the changes are not saved and also won't get lost.\nSo why do you want the confirmation dialog? I don't see any reason to have it at all.\n. I've changed this behavior a bit. Now instead of hiding the modified buffer and reusing the window, ctrlp opens a new split for the new buffer when hidden, confirm, autowriteall... are off.\nIf you find any problem with this change, let me know.\n. It's the root finding feature controlled by g:ctrlp_working_path_mode. Without setting it, it's defaulted to 'rc'. The behavior you're seeing is the 'c'.\nYou can use let g:ctrlp_working_path_mode = 0 to disable this feature.\nYour other projects probably have a root marker (.git, .hg, etc) at ~/code/project.\n. I'm not sure myself. The original screenshot was taken sometime last year. But it was likely one of the Proggy fonts or the ProFont at a larger size. If not, then I might have uninstalled it at some point.\n. It was definitely a pixel font, though. I was trying a lot of pixel and bitmap fonts at the time. I think I stopped using this one because of the small line space which made reading difficult.\n. Yes, I'm back to Consolas and Monaco now.\nAlso, thanks for the tip!\n. Added. You can check :help g:ctrlp_switch_buffer for details.\n. What tags file do you mean? And how exactly can scrapping a file list from a tags file be faster than say git ls-files?\n. Hmm, I guess you mean ctags-generated tags files, or similar... Well, the file list that can be scrapped from a tags file will be most definitely not the same as the index returned from globpath(), find, dir or git ls-files. So it simply can not be used as a direct replacement for those. Furthermore, I don't think scrapping and filtering a massive tags file for only a few files can be faster or more effective.\n. And not just filtering, whenever you wanted to update the file list, you would first have to run ctags on the entire code base to update the tags file...\n. Yeah, it's not really a bad idea, I just think it isn't very practical.\n. Thanks! But this is a user option. The most I can do with this type of information is adding new examples in the docs.\n. mdfind hardly fits the bill. It doesn't list hidden files by default, and the syntax you use only lists files that have file in their metadata (most likely in the filename). It only shows about 250 files in ~5000 total in my home directory.\n. Closing. This isn't exactly necessary and mdfind also doesn't work for what we need.\n. Added. Thank you!\n. Thanks! Just pushed a fix. Let me know if you find any other problem.\n. Hmm, can you be more specific? What exactly do you want to implement and how do you plan to implement it in Fugitive? I'm curious as to how something can possibly clobber the option, or more importantly, why does it even have to do that? Since ctrlp runs in its own buffer and has its own local working directory, pretty much having its own world.\nI'll certainly consider this but to have that particular ctrlp#custom(), there'll need to be a lot of changes. So what exactly do you want it for? Something to use in Fugitive to get the user_command feature for :Gstatus? I don't think I follow...\nAlso, <c-p> in Normal mode is a duplicate of k, so it's not hard to see why nobody has complained about that default (which can be very easily changed anyway, and the option to do this is plastered everywhere).\n. Oh I see. I thought you were talking about ctrlp's <c-p> mapping. I didn't know :Gstatus's <c-p> clobbered ctrlp's. But I still don't get exactly what this will be used for, and in which situation... I'm down with allowing more control, in any case.\nSo what if you could use a b:var which could be modified freely, with the git ls-files command that would be used in let files = split(system(...), \"\\n\")?\nvim\nlet b:ctrlp_user_command = ['.git', 'git --git-dir=/tmp/repo/.git/modules/submodule ls-files -oc --exclude-standard']\nAnd instead of using call ctrlp#custom({ 'root': '/tmp/repo/submodule', ... }) to open up ctrlp, just use :CtrlP /tmp/repo/submodule, since this only matters for find file mode. \nAn alternative to this is let b:ctrlp_working_path_mode = 0, lcd /tmp/repo/submodule, then :CtrlP.\nWould that work/be enough?\n. Well, fugitive would have to mess around with let files and call ctrlp#custom() otherwise, right? With a b:var, it wouldn't have to run another system(), while the git ls-files command would still be needed in any case.\nThe :CtrlP command started to take a path very early on, about a year ago today I think... Also, the fact that I mainly use git from console probably contributes to me not getting this. I don't have a clear idea of what :Gedit does, for example.\n. Then just do the usual saving & restoring for g:ctrlp_user_command, like this for example:\n``` vim\nfunc! CustomUserCmd()\n    if exists('g:ctrlp_user_command')\n        let saved_user_command = g:ctrlp_user_command\n    en\nunl! g:ctrlp_user_command\n\nlet g:ctrlp_user_command = ['.git', '...']\nCtrlP /tmp/repo/submodule\n\nunl! g:ctrlp_user_command\n\nif exists('saved_user_command')\n    let g:ctrlp_user_command = saved_user_command\nen\n\nendfunc\n\" Mapping for the status window\nnn    :call CustomUserCmd()\n```\nWhat do you think? It beats me having to modify ctrlp so that it takes options' values via function arguments, which I suspect very few people (if not nobody else) will probably ever need.\nI'll still proceed with adding support for using b:var, though, since among other things, it'll allow people to (more easily) overrule the above behavior should they want to.\n. Yeah, it's very often used to workaround problematic Vim's options or to create a more suitable enviroment. Like this particular one, for example:\n``` vim\nlet s:keepcpo = &cpo\nset cpo&vim\n...\nlet &cpo = s:keepcpo\nunlet s:keepcpo\n```\nFor the b:var change, I'll push it out soon after I can do some testing.\n. So I decided to bite the bullet and add support for overriding some options when calling ctrlp. Here's what the function call should look like:\nvim\ncall ctrlp#init(0, { 'dir': '...', 'opts': { 'user_command': ['.git', '...'] } })\nIf you find any problem with these changes, let me know. Thanks!\n. Thanks! But this should be done by the external matcher instead. There's no need to create a new option.\nHijacking the s:highlight() function like this also doesn't work well because the pattern sent to it is already reformatted, it isn't the same one sent to the external matcher.\n. I suppose you've solved your problem?\nAnyway, there's so much confusion regarding this option, and so many false bug reports, from both people who do and do not know of its existent. I'm really tempted to just disable or remove the feature altogether.\n. The path_mode = 'r' setting for ctrlp is only effective when a root (which should have a root marker) is actually found. If there's no root, ctrlp will use the current working directory, and I guess in your case it's set to the directory of the current file by the autochdir option.\nSo instead of a combination of autochdir and :e, you should use :e %:h/new_file.\n. OK, since I can't really test this, I'll trust you on it. I'll merge and push it out soon.\n. That's awesome. Thanks, @d11wtq!\nI encountered a few problems with the control mappings. For example, pressing <tab> (9)  throws an E471, and pressing <c-\\> (28) or <c-o> (15) does nothing.\n. Yep, that seems to fix it. But I just noticed, this stops working after toggling the focus with <s-tab> then back again. I tried adding another s:KeyLoop() call after toggling but this in turn causes errors when closing ctrlp. Any idea?\n. This solves the above problem for me, not sure if there's any side effect yet:\n``` diff\n+++ b/autoload/ctrlp.vim\n@@ -561,7 +561,7 @@ fu! s:BuildPrompt(upd)\n endf\nfu! s:KeyLoop()\n-   wh exists('s:focus') && s:focus\n+   wh exists('s:init')\n        redr\n        let n = getchar()\n        let c = type(n) == 0 ? nr2char(n) : n\n@@ -739,7 +739,7 @@ fu! s:PrtSelectJump(char)\n            let npos = match(lines, smartcs.'^'.chr, s:jmpchr[1] + 1)\n            let [jmpln, s:jmpchr] = [npos == -1 ? pos : npos, [chr, npos]]\n        en\n-       keepj exe jmpln + 1\n+       exe 'keepj norm!'

Here's an example from a different script:\n``` vim\nlet g:ctrlp_match_func = { 'match': 'MatchFunc' }\nlet g:path_to_binary = \"/path/to/binary\"\nfunction! MatchFunc(items, str, limit, mmode, ispath, crfile, regex)\n  \" Create a cache file\n  let cachefile = ctrlp#utils#cachedir().'/custom.cache'\n  if !( filereadable(cachefile) && a:items == readfile(cachefile) )\n    call writefile(a:items, cachefile)\n  endif\n  if !filereadable(cachefile)\n    return []\n  endif\nlet cmd = g:path_to_binary.' --limit '.a:limit.' --manifest '.cachefile.' '.a:str\n  return split(system(cmd), \"\\n\")\nendfunction\n```\nYou can check the help for the details on the arguments.\n. Yeah, it's an option to replace the built-in matching function.\nSo this isn't possible, yet, I think. With an extension, ctrlp still does all the matching and filtering. I might do something about this in the future, but it probably won't be anytime soon.\n. With how ctrlp does the matching, adding this will impact performance. So I'm not going to add it. It's a good idea otherwise, though.\n. vim\nlet g:ctrlp_show_hidden = 1\nIt's 0 by default now. I switched it off because people keep complaining about indexing time. Plus, ctrlp was one of the few finders (if not the only one) that showed hidden files by default.\n. There's a short changelog in the help file. But yeah, I guess I could be a bit more explicit with it.\n. ctrlp doesn't have this built-in. I'm not going to add it because it's not essential, and you can just be creative with the options. Use something like this in your vimrc, for example:\n``` vim\nlet g:ctrlp_buffer_func = { 'enter': 'MyCtrlPMappings' }\nfunc! MyCtrlPMappings()\n    nnoremap   c-@ :call DeleteBuffer()\nendfunc\nfunc! s:DeleteBuffer()\n    let line = getline('.')\n    let bufid = line =~ '[\\d+*No Name]$' ? str2nr(matchstr(line, '\\d+'))\n        \\ : fnamemodify(line[2:], ':p')\n    exec \"bd\" bufid\n    exec \"norm \\\"\nendfunc\n```\nThen pressing <c-@> in Buffer mode will delete the selected buffer.\n. It's partly because there aren't many usable mappings left to use. I'd also have to make something to allow changing the deletion command between :bd, :bw, :bun, otherwise people would be requesting it. Lastly, I think people should be using plugins dedicated to buffer management instead.\n. @amadeus Yeah, the snippet was written before the addition of No Name buffers. I've updated it a bit.\n. Does this happen everywhere or only in some directories? Does it happen with other commands like :CtrlPBuffer?\nWithout more information, it looks like it has something to do with the directory you are currently in. Line 1 of GlobPath is just a call to Vim's globpath(). The E16: Invalid range error otherwise makes no sense in the context of this function.\nYou can test by running :CtrlP path/to/an/empty/directory, where path/to/an/empty/directory is the path to any directory with no files and no sub directories.\n. Let me know if 10bbbfa changes anything.\n. Hmm, there's no h in spec/requests/static_pages_spec.rb, so wouldn't typing static_h or just h be enough to find the second file? If there are other files interfering then that's a bad example, I think.\nAnyway, I really don't want to make the matching more complex as it will impact performance. As for interpreting spaces as either underscores or spaces, take a look at the g:ctrlp_abbrev option.\n. It's a new option, so just update your copy.\nAnd yes, with the abbrev option you can replace the space entirely with the underscore. Example:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_abbrev = {\n    \\ 'gmode': 't',\n    \\ 'abbrevs': [\n        \\ {\n        \\ 'pattern': '\\(^@.\\+\\|\\\\\\@<!:.\\+\\)\\@<! ',\n        \\ 'expanded': '_',\n        \\ 'mode': 'pfrz',\n        \\ },\n        \\ ]\n    \\ }\nThe \\(^@.\\+\\|\\\\\\@<!:.\\+\\)\\@<! part is for keeping the space in some special cases.\n. Those indicators interfere with the matching. They also mess up the opening of the buffers because they are added at the source and become a part of the buffer names.\nPersonally, I'd just use :ls to get a more informative buffer list.\n. Just one small (negligible) issue. When in regexp mode, the indicators break the highlighting of the matched string:\n```\n\ndoc/ctrlp.txt [+]\n[===statusline===]\nr>> txt$\n```\n\nNormally txt should be highlighted.\n. Thank you! This is good enough for now. I'll try to fix the issue with the highlighting later.\nBTW, I've changed the format of the indicators to resemble the output of :ls.\n. There are 2 limits: max number of files g:ctrlp_max_files, and max directory depth g:ctrlp_max_depth. Try increasing them. Also, check your wildignore option and make sure temp* (or something along that line), isn't in it.\n. See :help g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings. But <c-x> can't be changed to just i because i is used for inputting the letter i literally. If you want to change <c-x> to <c-i>, then you'll also need to replace <tab> (also with the option) because <tab> and <c-i> have the same keycode.\n. It can be used to autocomplete directory names for @cd directory<cr> (change ctrlp's working directory), or for directory/filename<c-y> (create a new file).\n. You can rebuild the statuslines with the g:ctrlp_status_func option and change or move the parts however you like. See :help g:ctrlp_status_func for details.\n. They are indeed swapped. I'll correct it. Thanks!\n. It's regexp matched against directories and filenames literally when scanning. I suppose you've figured this out with the other issue (#290).\n. That's because the option is applied after globpath() returns the results. The cache won't contain the ignored files. So it's close but isn't exactly \"when scanning\" (as is normally understood).\nTo apply some ignore rules when globpath() is running, you should use Vim's wildignore.\n. What do you mean by \"not showing any option\"? Does ctrlp not start? Or ctrlp starts but there's no result?\nHow many files are in the same directory as the file you just open?\n. Set g:ctrlp_working_path_mode to 0 or an empty string. Or if you pull in the recent commits, you won't have to because ctrlp now uses a different default behavior.\n. How about let g:ctrlp_custom_ignore = $HOME.'/\\(Library\\|Music\\)$'?\n. It already is, the BufLeave event is included along with BufAdd, BufEnter etc. So just update your copy. I added this a long time ago, but if you haven't updated for a while, you might not have it yet.\nAlso, if you want to keep the last access order when typing the search string, then set g:ctrlp_mruf_default_order to 1. Otherwise the list will be sorted just like in the other modes.\n. You can use :CtrlP /var/www/myproject/bla/bla/theme.\n. The root_markers option must be a List: let g:ctrlp_root_markers = ['pom.xml'].\n. The default value is a List in the help file. The option's name is also plural. But yes, if issues like this keep coming up, I'll explicitly mention the var type, at least for some options.\n. Doesn't happen to me (but I'm not using Janus), and so far no one else has had this problem nor there has been any similar issue. So it's likely caused by something else in your Vim config.\nYou can try starting Vim in minimal configuration (without Janus) with just the 2 plugins. If it doesn't happen then try disabling the plugins or any configurations you have in Janus one by one, until you find the culprit.\nIn any case, can you provide more details and steps to reproduce? Does it happen all the time or only with some specific window layouts? From which window do you invoke ctrlp (nerdtree or an existing vertical split)? ... Take some screenshots if you can.\n. OK, this is almost definitely because (at least) one of the existing windows next to nerdtree has set winfixwidth. That's the only way I see running :vnew can crush every other window including nerdtree. There's nothing special about how ctrlp opens a vertical split (just a plain :vnew filename).\nClosing since this isn't a ctrlp's problem.\nYou can find out what set winfixwidth for your windows by grepping your Vim config for winfixwidth or wfw.\n. Both of the commands already include named, unsaved buffers. I'll see what can be done about unnamed buffers.\n. You can use the g:ctrlp_user_command option for this. For example, if you have the cscope.files file at a directory where you normally want ctrlp to start scanning from:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_user_command = ['cscope.files', 'cat %s/cscope.files']\nOn Windows, use type instead of cat.\nIf you want ctrlp to zoom onto the parent directory of cscope.files automatically:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_root_markers = ['cscope.files']\nFor using several files, you can use autocmds to change the options based on the current buffer:\nvim\nau BufEnter *.py\n    \\ let g:ctrlp_user_command = ['py.files', 'cat %s/py.files'] |\n    \\ let g:ctrlp_root_markers = ['py.files']\nIf I add a new option specifically for using file list files, it'll be very similar to g:ctrlp_user_command in this case and will require the same configurations. So I probably won't, to avoid redundancy.\n. All the past attempts to improve or make complicated the internal matching algo have resulted in lower performance. And performance is what Vimscript already severely lacks. Real improvements can only be done by using a different language. It's the main reason the g:ctrlp_match_func option was added.\nSo my answer to your question is I have no interest in improving the internal algorithm. And g:ctrlp_match_func will remain a user option.\n. See :help g:ctrlp_open_multiple_files.\n. Are you sure about that behavior? If you read taglist's help, Tlist_Auto_Open is only for automatically open the taglist window when opening Vim. If you check the code, this is the only place it is used:\nvim\n    if g:Tlist_Auto_Open\n        autocmd VimEnter * nested call s:Tlist_Window_Check_Auto_Open()\n    endif\nThis won't automatically open the taglist window when you open a file after Vim is already open.\nEdit: I didn't see your second comment when I started investigating.  Well, it isn't a bug in taglist, either, since it isn't a bug to begin with. It seems you're just expecting the option to work differently than its defined behavior.\n. No problem. Also, taglist hasn't been updated for 5 years now, I'd just leave those changes in the plugin or branch it, just to be safe.\n. <c-s> is reserved for terminal control flow. You should use <c-x> to split horizontally instead.\n. It's a known limitation of the ctrlp prompt. Try setting g:ctrlp_key_loop and see if you can type those letters. Check out :help g:ctrlp_key_loop for the details. There's currently no other workaround.\n. Update to the version on github. The last version is 1.78.\n. I can't reproduce this. I tried with having a few horizontal splits and a quickfix window at the bottom. The present of the quickfix window doesn't seem to make any difference.\nCan you provide the reduced .vimrc and take some screenshots before and after opening ctrlp?\n. Thank you! It seems that the problem lies with Vim being unable to correctly restore the window layout from the output of winrestcmd(), in the case where there's a window with set winfixheight and it's crushed by a :resize command run on a new window.\nI've pushed a workaround. Let me know if you find any problem.\n. You can do that in ctrlp but only in filename-only mode, which can be toggled on/off with <c-d>.\n. It definitely works for me. Are you using the latest version on github?\n. My email can be found in the repo with git log. There's no need for a personal email but thank you for the intention! I appreciate it.\n. However it would work, it would require rebuilding of the cache in the background. This can't be done with Vimscript in a single Vim session.\n. Would moving the match window to the top of the screen work for you? The top hit won't jump around if the match window is at the top. You can have this by setting g:ctrlp_match_window_bottom to 0.\n. Use g:ctrlp_mruf_exclude instead. g:ctrlp_custom_ignore and wildignore are only for ignoring files from globpath(). You should also check out :help ctrlp-options.\nBTW, instead of forcing ctrlp to ignore .vimrc, I'd investigate to find out why the file was always the most recent file because that's not normal. On ctrlp's side, a file's only added to the MRU list if it's opened as a buffer.\n. Looks like you're using this config line which is for Windows:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_user_command = 'dir %s /-n /b /s /a-d'\nJust switch to the one for Linux. But unless you want a different list, or want to do something special with it, you don't need to use g:ctrlp_user_command to get the files.\nAlso, check out :help ctrlp.txt, there are a lot more stuff and more details than in the readme.\n. It's because a lot of the times the tag file can be pretty big, reformatting the tag lines will take a long time. So I want to keep it simple and fast. There's no other reason.\n. Good idea, but aside from the highlighting, there's still the problem with the matching. Matching a filename including path is different from matching a tag or a line entry.\nYour proof works because coincidently the tag's and the line's lines have very similar formats. But if you throw files or buffers into the mix then filename-only mode won't work, and the entire tag line (the tagname and the extra infos) will be included when matching.\nOriginally, I also wanted the mixed mode to work with a command like this:\nCtrlPMixed --mode=files,buffers,tags,...\nBut I didn't and still don't think it's worth making, at least until I can figure out how to solve all the major problems.\n. Actually, ctrlp is more like a search interface than a command mode auto completion system, so I'm not sure it fits what you're looking for. But basically, it uses the user input as a search string on a predefined list of items and then returns the results.\nThe buffer is a just normal buffer with a few settings like buftype=nofile, nobuflisted... It's not a preview nor a quickfix buffer/window. There's no cmap because the mappings are Normal mode mappings, which you can find in the Mappings section.\nBut in case you want to create a simplified version of ctrlp so that you can (basically) have an extension without the core, you might want to read the Mappings section for getting user input, the MatchedItems section for searching, and the BuildPrompt section for displaying everything in autoload/ctrlp.vim.\n. There are already mappings to open entries in vertical or horizontal splits. Please read :help ctrlp-mappings.\n. You probably hit the max_files limit which is set to 10000 files. Try increasing it with the g:ctrlp_max_files option.\n. There's no other condition. So naturally files that are in deeper directories have higher chance of being excluded.\n. Press <F5> when ctrlp's open or use the commands (see :help ctrlp-commands).\n. Merged. Thank you!\n. Duplicate of #280. You can start with the .vimrc snippet in that issue.\n. Can you help me test to see if read/write when receiving SIGTERM is actually working for you?\nFrom outside Vim, create a text file /home/user/test/readwrite.txt containing only one line: read. Then put this into your .vimrc and restart Vim:\nvim\nlet g:rwtestfile = '/home/user/test/readwrite.txt'\nau VimLeavePre * cal writefile(readfile(g:rwtestfile) + ['write'], g:rwtestfile)\nAfter you run shutdown or kill the gVim process, check if the readwrite.txt file has this:\nread\nwrite\nBoth this and the MRU saving work fine for me with a kill pID, which also sends SIGTERM.\n. That's interesting. Thank you! I also just tried shutdown, and apparently the readwrite.txt file above isn't changed (write isn't appended) when using shutdown. So in any case, I'll need to find a workaround for this, possibly by saving the MRU list more frequently instead of only when exiting Vim.\n. I've added a new option: g:ctrlp_mruf_save_on_update, defaults to 1. If you find any problem with it, let me know.\nI don't like it but there's really no other way. Saving on exit doesn't work when using shutdown, even when the autocmd consists of only readfile() and writefile(). Also, saving on every update is what mru.vim and others do (e.g. fuzzyfinder), ctrlp also did it by default in the beginning. It's not out of the norm.\n. I've made some new changes. Now saving only happens when a new entry is added. Changing of order won't be saved until exit or when another entry is added. This will be just enough to prevent completely losing the new entries in case Vim isn't closed normally.\nAlso, this was before adding the option, but in your test script, if I add another sleep instance after killall in the inner loop, then in both cases all of the 5 files are always shown.\n. Thank you! But this feature already exists. You can remove non-existing entries by pressing <F5> in MRU mode.\n. Merged. Thanks @mattn!\n. Yes, the window isn't supposed to be scrollable except for a few extensions. The number of results is limited at the max height. This is intended for performance reason.\n. Fixed. Sorry about that!\n. Thank you! But you can already do this with the g:ctrlp_buftag_types option. No need to change the code to get it.\n. Fixed. Thank you for reporting! This bug had been there pretty much since the beginning I think. It happened when :cd into an empty directory then open ctrlp and use <c-y> to create a new file (or some sub dirs and a new file).\n. There's already an option to keep the cache:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_clear_cache_on_exit = 0\n. Just make sure the options are actually set. You can run :echo g:ctrlp_clear_cache_on_exit to check. The deletion happens at only one place, and it's just a simple if check for g:ctrlp_clear_cache_on_exit before running the clearing function.\nIn any case, try starting Vim in a clean environment like the following and see if it changes anything. From the console, run vim --noplugin -u path/to/a/simple/.vimrc and use this as the content of the .vimrc:\n``` vim\nset nocp\nset runtimepath^=~/.vim/bundle/ctrlp.vim\nruntime! plugin/ctrlp.vim\nlet g:ctrlp_use_caching = 1\nlet g:ctrlp_clear_cache_on_exit = 0\n```\nChange the runtimepath location accordingly.\n. Duplicate of #313. But good idea about adding an indicator for hitting max_files. I'll see what I can do.\n. Update to the latest version on github, currently 1.78. This has already been fixed.\n. There's an option for this. What you want is the second example at :help g:ctrlp_abbrev. Update the plugin before checking it out since it's a fairly new option.\n. That will replace all spaces with .*. You won't want that if you use special inputs like @cd path/. If you use those, start with the pattern from the help: '\\(^@.\\+\\|\\\\\\@<!:.\\+\\)\\@<! '.\n. Yes, it's intended, or was intended. If the option does take effect in Mixed mode then in most cases, it'll effectively remove all MRU files in the mix. But now that I see some people might actually want that, I think I'll enable it.\n. Files is the default mode because it's what the majority of people use ctrlp for. If Files isn't the default you want, you can easily change it with the g:ctrlp_cmd option:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_cmd = 'CtrlPMRU'\n. The last mode isn't saved cross session. It's only stored in a script local variable. There isn't a way to save then initialize it yourself. But you can use something like this to start LastMode with something other than Files:\n``` vim\nlet g:ctrlp_cmd = 'call CallCtrlP()'\nfunc! CallCtrlP()\n    if exists('s:called_ctrlp')\n        CtrlPLastMode\n    else\n        let s:called_ctrlp = 1\n        CtrlPMRU\n    endif\nendfunc\n``\n. Which closed issue do you refer to? But this slowness is typically because ctrlp can't handle the large file list. This is slightly more apparent on Windows. There's really nothing I can do about it other than to tell you to try limiting the number of files with theg:ctrlp_max_files` option, and updating ctrlp and gVim.\n. Have you read them or just put up everything you could find after I asked?\n46 wasn't a bug. It was a delay when starting up caused by the user having similar mappings.\n55 I even asked the person in another issue but he never provided the file that caused it.\n116 was fixed. It was fnamemodify() being slow, the same reason I've always tried to avoid using this function.\n331 is this issue.\nAlso, I want to add that I see every issue as something that I need to deal with, to be done. I will close and ignore the ones that I deem not worth following up, they may or may not be actual fixable bugs. But if there's a valid bug or a common problem I can identify, I always try to fix it or at least provide a solution for it as soon as I see the report.\n. CtrlP has a documentation which you can access by running :help ctrlp.txt. All the available options are documented in there.\n. You can use the CtrlPLinePre highlight group to change the color of the > marker.\nAlso, check out :help ctrlp-customization for the available hl groups.\n. An index from the results is worthless in term of identifying a string. There also isn't any way to get the actual index of the string in the initial list since the results are usually sorted. I think your best bet would be to add an identifier to the strings like this:\nfoo\n  bar1 (1)\nbar\n  bar1 (2)\n  baz\n. I suppose it is. You can just put them in a s:syntax() function in the extension. Also, use 'type': 'tabe' for the s:foo_var variable, then add the identifiers like this:\nbar1<tab><conceal_id_begin_char>1</conceal_id_end_char>\n. Yes, some of the sorting functions are disabled for other types. So use 'type': 'path' and make sure the conceal chars are unique then, maybe something like +++ 1 +++.\n. Well, it does match if you use 'type': 'path' because this tells ctrlp to treat the entries as directories and files. So you'll want to make sure the conceal_id chars are unique and unlikely to be searched for.\n. Ok, I'm going to close this. I won't be adding it.\n. I can't reproduce it. Can you try reproducing it in a clean environment? If not then can you narrow it down and find out what might be interfering?\n. Can you rephrase that? Not sure if I understand what you mean.\nAlso, this would have been a major problem for a lot of people if it was easy to reproduce. I think something else in your Vim setup is probably interfering. It might be an autocmd, or something custom.\n. It's because of the 'exit': 'ctrlp#exit()' key:value pair in s:git_files_var. You don't need that if you use the builtin ctrlp#acceptfile().\n. Looks like you're using an older plugin/ctrlp.vim file with a newer autoload/ctrlp/ directory. This might happen if you have multiple installations of ctrlp in different places.\nSo first remove anything you can find, then follow this guide to make a clean install.\n. OK, I'm going to close this. g:ctrlp_buftags and CtrlPBufTag are defined in the open and in the same file as the CtrlP command. The only way they don't exist while CtrlP does is if you're somehow using a really old plugin/ctrlp.vim file from before BuffterTag mode was added.\n. It's just the standard cursorline, you can change it by changing the CursorLine highlight group of your colorscheme.\n. Check out the g:ctrlp_buffer_func option then. You can put the :highlight commands in a pair of functions, and call one on enter and another on exit.\n. See :help g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings. Also, check out :help ctrlp-options and :help ctrlp-mappings while you're at it.\n. Thanks! But tag.vim doesn't have it because the :tag, :tjump... commands don't always jump to the tag's position (because of an outdated tags file, for example). I suggest you create a mapping for zvzz, like ,z, which can be used elsewhere.\n. If :tag fails, running zvzz blindly will open the folds and change the view of the current buffer.\n. Vim has the 'foldopen' option, but it only applies when the command is typed directly in the command line. I'll see if using feedkeys() can get around this.\n. Done. Let me know if you find any problem with this.\n. The reason for using feedkeys() is so that 'foldopen' will take effect automatically. There's nothing for zz. If :tag fails, running zz will still change the view of the current buffer regardless. So no, it's not safe. You'll just have to type zz manually.\n. Actually no, unless in a :try :catch, Vim will continue with the next command, in this case with zz whether it's in feedkeys() or not.\n. The problem with that is without :catch, the commands after :endtry won't be executed. I also don't like using :try with commands that involve opening of files because :try can stop an autocmd from firing if an error happens before it.\n. Can you describe it a bit more? What exactly are you trying to do for your plugin? You want to create some mappings with <leader>?\n. So you want to be able to literally type <leader>[c], for example, and it would take you to a file with c highlighted without having to press <cr>?\n. OK, so that'd be searchstring<leader>c or <leader>c to select an entry. That'd be very different but would it really be much better than say searchstring[c]<cr>? Or just [c]<cr>? Since you'd want the hotkeys to be unique anyway.\n. Still, it seems like a big change for speeding up a small task, that is selecting an entry already in the match window. You can also already press <s-tab> and type the first letter of the entries to jump to them, or just type a few more characters to narrow down the results. So I don't think I'm going to add support for this feature.\nTo simulate a keypress in general, try feedkeys() instead of normal!.\n. Oh I see. I just always consider adding things so that people don't have to modify the core to get what they want.\n. There's no option to hide specific buffers. If the netrw buffer shows up when you run :ls (it doesn't for me) and its buftype is empty, then CtrlPBuffer will list it.\nIn general, you can force a buffer from showing up by setting its 'buflisted' option to 0.\n. Then you can get that resultant file list and feed it to ctrlp through an extension. It should be simple. But I don't think I'm going to add such an extension to ctrlp. It isn't really that useful since a file list from grep is usually quite short.\n. Have you typed the name of a file you want to create into the prompt first?\nJust in case, check out :help ctrlp-input-formats, section f) for the details on how to use <c-y>.\n. <c-y> basically just does a :edit newfile for you. If :edit does throw an error, you'll see it.\n. Make sure you update to HEAD of master. There used to be stricter rules of when ctrlp reuses the current window.\nWith the current version, ctrlp will still open a new split (when using the default <cr>) if the current buffer is either having a non-empty buftype, is help or quickfix.\nYou can add exceptions to this with the g:ctrlp_reuse_window option.\n. Usually SYSTEM\\Rank.cpp will be at the bottom (or at the top, if you've changed the default listing order), unless the other found files are much newer since this matters more in MRU mode. And regexp mode simply eliminates all the other files that aren't Rank.cpp.\nAlso, in case it isn't obvious enough, by default ctrlp shows results from best to worst from bottom to top (of the match window) and highlights the best one at the bottom.\nBut in any case, I won't be making any more changes to the sorting algo, at least in the foreseeable future. So that's as good as it gets.\n. You can use <tab> to autocomplete the directory names under the cwd. Try it and see if it's what you're looking for.\nFor example, type @cd subd<tab> where subd is from subdirectory.\n. Actually, ctrlp isn't a word-completion plugin, it's a finder. I'll have to recreate the e-like or cd-like completion inside the prompt in some way. The basic completion with <tab> is meant for directories under the cwd, which is ctrlp's main concern.\nWith that said, I'll still look into implementing this and will add it if it's simple enough. But if it turns out to be more trouble than it's worth, then I'll probably drop it.\nFor the time being, you can do a @cd ~, @cd $HOME, or @cd / before doing the @cd subd<tab>.\n. Well, the difficult part here is ctrlp operates in Normal mode. The prompt isn't actually the command line nor it's in Insert mode where word-completion is readily available.\n. You just need to clear the old file cache. Check the document (or the readme) for the mapping and commands. If you like, you can also disable caching permanently or partially with the g:ctrlp_use_caching option.\n. It's limited that way so that searching doesn't become too slow too quickly. You can search the old issues if you want to find out more about this.\nIf trying different search strings bothers you too much, you can either set a bigger g:ctrlp_max_height which may help, or use g:ctrlp_match_func to setup a custom matching function.\n. The highlighting of the selected line is just the default cursorline. If Vim's cursorline is somehow not visible with your colorscheme/setup then there's nothing I can do to change that. It's entirely up to you to configure it.\n. The initial order doesn't make much difference since the results are sorted and mixed up when you search anyway. There's no way to tell whether a result is file, buffer or mru unless we do a check for each which can be expensive. Also, the current initial order isn't always file + buffer + mru, it's just shorter list goes first.\n. Well, mru usually already contains buffers, exceptions like unsaved buffers are rare. So a mixed mode for only buffer + mru wouldn't be much different from mru mode.\n. What do you mean by \"all have working directory as 'src'\"? What does :pwd return after you :cd into those repos? \nThe name of the cache file is based on the return value of getcwd(), so it should already be the full path. Your patch also doesn't actually change anything since dir is always getcwd() (a case where a:0 == 2 hasn't been used anywhere in ctrlp).\n. I believe this is an old issue of vim-powerline on Windows, the report used to be at Lokaltog/vim-powerline#161.\nThe vim-powerline issue tracker has been disabled and I don't remember the exact conditions, but it had something to do with the highlighting or folding in the current buffer, then simply echoing/redrawing would trigger error messages. The BuildPrompt() function just inevitably trips on the errors although none of the conditions was originated from ctrlp (so they couldn't be worked around).\nIt might help if you manage to fix that broken character in the font you're using that appears on the statuslines.\n. Makes me kind of wonder if it's a good idea to use :silent! when calling BuildPrompt() again to suppress the error msgs (harmless in this case), but that'll also make it more difficult to track down actual bugs in the future.\n. Vim has those options, splitright and splitbelow.\n. How often does it happen? When do you usually notice it after closing/starting Vim? Do you change your user account (thus change the home dir)? I'm going to need at least something.\nCtrlP itself only ever clear MRU if you press <F7> while in MRU mode, and there's a confirmation dialog. The caching has been unchanged for the last year and there hasn't been any related issue. You should check for external sources that can delete those cache files, starting with your Vim config.\n. Closing due to lack of information, plus I don't see any conceivable way ctrlp can mistakenly delete the cache file.\n. That's strange that it didn't happen in your last time exiting Vim. Can you post the output of :ver and any setting you have for ctrlp? Also, make sure your ctrlp bundle is up to date.\nI don't notice anything on the list, and ctrlp recreates the folders whenever something needs to be saved. Currently, this happens when pressing <F5> in ctrlp or exiting Vim.\n. That's normal. By default, any file that isn't a log file or cache.txt will be deleted upon exiting Vim. And .DS_Store is hidden.\nIf this starts happening again, you can try setting g:ctrlp_clear_cache_on_exit to 0, the clearing function simply won't be called.\n. @mMontu You can still avoid requesting cache updates by hand by having let g:ctrlp_use_caching = 0.\nBut in case you want to investigate at code-level, the main (and only) deletion function in ctrlp is ctrlp#clra(). It's called when exiting Vim if the clear_cache_on_exit option is set, running :CtrlPClearAllCaches calls it directly.\n. @whimdump I've pushed a change a couple of months ago that should prevent this kind of problem for good. Are you using HEAD of master of the ctrlp repo on github?\n. This can't be done with Vimscript because it's single threaded. It's not possible to do the loading while running something else to intercept the keystrokes. I'm unsure what we see when scanning the first time is either provided by Vim or by the OS, but it can't be replicated with scripting.\n. Yes, see :help g:ctrlp_mruf_exclude. You can use a pattern like this \\v\\.git/(COMMIT_EDITMSG|index).\n. These are left out because I want to list only the more unique mappings that people don't look for if they don't know the features exist.\n. It's because <c-s> and <c-q> are used for control flow in terminal. They can't be mapped. If you really want to use <c-s>, you'll have to configure your terminal to pass it to Vim. Otherwise, just use <c-x> everywhere.\n. Is there any reason for the s:MatchItPy() function to be in autoload/ctrlp.vim? You can just as well define it as a global function and put it elsewhere. This is basically what the g:ctrlp_match_func option is there for, it's so that you don't have to make change to the core.\n. Yes, you can use ctrlp#call(name[, args]) to call a function in the scope of autoload/ctrlp.vim.\n. If you're using g:ctrlp_user_command with a version control listing command then you'll have to commit the new files first or use a command that lists untracked files. If you aren't using this option, then make sure the new files aren't in an ignore list or are hidden files. Check wildignore and g:ctrlp_custom_ignore if you have them.\nNext time, if you think something is a bug, please provide details like steps to reproduce and your configurations. Don't use the tracker like a support forum when you run into a problem.\n. Don't change the help file, that does nothing. You're supposed to put the let g:ctrlp_max_height = 40 line into your .vimrc file. It's the same file that you put the line to load up pathogen.\n. Just use anything that's present in the paths you want to be ignored but not in the others. Use the whole paths if need be.\n. The problem with staying pure Vimscript and in a single Vim instance is that there's no way to avoid the waiting part, so auto-updating with CursorHold (forcing a wait) is out of the question. The modification time of a directory also isn't reliable for detecting changes.\nBut to minimize or eliminate manual updates, you can use the g:ctrlp_use_caching option. For example, use let g:ctrlp_use_caching = 200 to disable caching for directories that have fewer than 200 files.\n. You can remap the keys. See :help g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings.\n. If you don't select anything, you can close the ctrlp window by pressing either <esc> or <c-c>. If you want to close it from a script, ctrlp#exit() already calls s:Close() so there's no point for another function.\n. I see. Can you checkout commit 675faa7 and see if it still works for you? If it does work, then look into the change in 6c49f2a and let me know if you figure out something (try removing the bufnr or bufname or both) that works for you.\nThanks!\n. It's so that the closing function is called only once and it's through a BufLeave autocmd. It looks like this autocmd is never triggered for you. You can try to track down the cause, but if it's too much trouble, use this for now:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings = { 'Close()': ['<esc>', '<c-c>'] }\n. Duplicate of #368.\n. You probably have a new repo dir, like .git, in your home dir. Try let g:ctrlp_working_path_mode = 0, this will tell ctrlp to not try to find a root and just use the cwd.\n. It isn't there because I want to keep the readme brief, and there are a lot more at the suggested :h ctrlp-mappings.\n. No, both should work and they do for me. Where's the /tmp directory in relative to the directory you're indexing? Do you change any other option? What ctrlp version are you using? If you can consistently reproduce this, let me know how.\n. Oh I see. That's a known issue. It's because dirs and files are filtered separately with each pattern. Can't really avoid this unless I use the dir pattern to filter files as well, but this will make having different types redundant.\nSo it may seem inconsistent and odd when you notice it, but I think I'll just leave it that way. At least people will still have the option to ignore only dirs.\nAs for converting custom_ignore to wildignore, you can already use both, and for custom_ignore you can write complex regex while you can't for wildignore. A conversion will likely break it for a lot of people.\n. This isn't exactly a new idea, but understandably, everyone wants it. The problem is that there's no background thread in Vim and Vimscript. I'll have to either use a different language or start a new Vim just for the indexing.\n. That's partly by design. The height is to help speeding up the indexing and the searching. As a result, it becomes more difficult finding files further down the file list. This is usually fine since files further down usually have long paths and need more specific search patterns anyway. But with git ls-files, the files under config are returned after all the subdirs, so the config/routes.php is being placed closer to the bottom.\nThat's where you have your problem. I won't be making any change to the internal indexing and searching, so this won't ever really be fixed. But since you're already using g:ctrlp_user_command, you might want to look into using g:ctrlp_match_func as well.\n. I'm going to need a little more details. Which of the ignored files still show up? Can you post your full vimrc? Do you use g:ctrlp_user_command? What ctrlp version are you using? Post a step by step from when you save these options to when you open ctrlp. Also, try running :CtrlPClearAllCaches before opening ctrlp and see if it changes anything.\n. The OS shouldn't matter. So first, make sure you're actually rerunning ctrlp for the same directory, then find and check if any new cache file is written. The cache location is set by g:ctrlp_cache_dir, make sure this location is writable from Vim.\nIn any case, please post your full vim config and a step by step from when you open ctrlp the first time to the second time, and the location where you open it.\n. So it's the default value which is $HOME.'/.cache/ctrlp' on both. Check for the cache there.\n. Just press <cr>, or whatever key you have set to AcceptSelection(\"e\") with the g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings option. Provided that you're using a recent version, ctrlp won't avoid the current window unless the buffer in it has a non-empty buftype.\nThe <c-o> then r combo which works for you, does the same things that <cr> by default does.\n. OK, it looks like I might be too quick to assume you just didn't try <cr> but used <c-x>, or <c-v>, etc. instead (kind of made sense to me since you said <c-o>r worked). I took the liberty to look into your vimrc and found this line:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_split_window = 1 \" <CR> = New Tab\nSo there you have it. It's an old option that allows you to change how <cr> opens a file. Either comment it out, switch to g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings completely, or keep using <c-o>r.\nAnyway, if you've been aware of the config line and actually didn't try <cr>, then my apologies for the redundant post.\n. You can do this with the g:ctrlp_buftag_types option. There's no need to make changes to the code.\n. The other ctrlp mappings, specifically the <c-...> mappings, do they work? Can I take a look at your full Vim configuration? What happens if you open ctrlp immediately after starting up Vim? What happens if you comment out your mappings? What happens if you start Vim in minimal configuration with only ctrlp?\n. Having a higher priority only means that the marker is closer to the beginning of the List. So you can solve your problem with git and perforce by placing .git before .p4config like the following, no need to change the code:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_root_markers = ['.git', '.p4config']\n. It's not that simple. Using the formatted (i.e. the non-raw) list will leave behind duplicate entries which are MRU files in the cwd.\n. I've applied the option to the raw MRU list intead. Thank you for looking into this, anyhow!\n. This should be fixed now. Thank you for reporting!\n. The prompt and the match window are handled completely different in ctrlp. For one thing, you type everything in Normal mode instead of in Insert mode. It'll require a massive rewrite to allow for something like this, so no.\n. Either remove --exclude-standard or don't use g:ctrlp_user_command and hide unwanted files with the ignore options. But if you still want to use user_command, and removing --exclude-standard doesn't exactly do what you want, then read git ls-files --help and find out yourself whether or not you can get it to do what you want.\nOnce you use g:ctrlp_user_command, it's up to you to feed ctrlp the file list.\n. There's the g:ctrlp_default_input option with which you can create a command like this:\nvim\ncom! -n=? CtrlPDefInput let g:ctrlp_default_input = <q-args> | CtrlP\nThen just use :CtrlPDefInput profile.\nIt's an option because allowing :CtrlP search-string while already having :CtrlP path/ can complicate things quite a bit.\n. Other than in a few modes (Mixed, RTScript), I don't see how anything in ctrlp can create duplicates. All the internal actions are either removing or sorting.\nThe git ls-files -moc command you use, however, does create duplicates. It lists both modified files and cached files. You can test this by modifying a tracked file, then before adding the changes, run git ls-files -mc, you'll see the file showing up twice.\n. git ls-files -moc | uniq can still list duplicated files. Try it with a small repo so you can spot them more easily.\n. Well, uniq only removes successive identical lines, so it'll fail to remove duplicates if the lines simply aren't next to each other. But that aside, you can avoid the dupes by just not including -m, -oc already shows all the files, modified or not.\n. It's firstly because you've switched <cr> and <c-t>, and secondly because switch_buffer only applies for modes that handle files or buffers directly (the idea is from Vim's switchbuf).\nApplying this option to other modes will really complicate things. In Tag mode, for example, the commands for opening are just the :tag series of commands. I'd have to create something to replace them in order to apply switch_buffer.\nIf you only call the modes directly, you can probably use something like this:\n``` vim\nfunc! MyPrtMappings()\n    let g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings = {\n        \\ 'AcceptSelection(\"e\")': [''],\n        \\ 'AcceptSelection(\"t\")': ['', '<2-LeftMouse>'],\n        \\ }\nendfunc\nfunc! MyCtrlPTag()\n    let g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings = {\n        \\ 'AcceptSelection(\"e\")': ['', '<2-LeftMouse>'],\n        \\ 'AcceptSelection(\"t\")': [''],\n        \\ }\n    CtrlPTag\nendfunc\nlet g:ctrlp_buffer_func = { 'exit': 'MyPrtMappings' }\ncom! MyCtrlPTag call MyCtrlPTag()\n```\nThen use :MyCtrlPTag instead of :CtrlPTag.\n. Is there any reason to use git ls-tree -r HEAD | grep -v -e \"^\\d\\+\\scommit\" | cut -f 2 instead of git ls-tree --name-only -r HEAD, or just git ls-files?\nTo list files not yet committed with git ls-files you can use git ls-files . -co --exclude-standard.\nBut to call the fallback command directly, use this instead:\nvim\ncom! -n=? -com=dir MyCtrlPFallback\n    \\ cal ctrlp#init(0, { 'dir': <q-args>, 'opts': { 'user_command': 'find %s -type f' } })\n. Yes, ctrlp has some default ignore rules. If you want it to ignore something specific, you can use wildignore or g:ctrlp_custom_ignore or both.\n. ctrlp supports user-created extensions, so anyone knowing a bit of Vimscript will be able to write this. Take a look at the extensions branch and also :help ctrlp-extensions.\n. You can mark the bookmarks with <c-z> then press <F7> to delete them. This is mentioned twice in the docs, once in the ctrlp-mappings section, and once in the ctrlp-extensions section.\n. It may be that the cache location isn't writable in your new setup. By default, it's set at $HOME/.cache/ctrlp, you may have changed it with the g:ctrlp_cache_dir option. In either case, check this location and make sure you're the owner and have read/write permission to it.\n. What does :echo $XDG_CACHE_HOME return for you? There's no hardcoded base dir, but $XDG_CACHE_HOME is the other default and it's used if it exists.\n. Vim's /pattern has always done the job just fine for me. I'm not sure if a slight improvement will be worth adding this.\n. Neither. I simply want to avoid it being redundant. I'll look into this regardless.\n. @dusans expand(\"%\") is a function call. So the correct syntax is :execute \"CtrlPLine \".expand(\"%\"). But in this case, you can just use :CtrlPLine %.\n. You have to read that description in the context of the whole option. It means ctrlp's local directory is set to the directory of the current file, unless the current file is somewhere inside the current working directory.\nSo which parts do you think are difficult to understand? What do you suggest to make the description clearer?\n. I'm going to leave it as-is. It's not that difficult to understand once you know what each term means by reading the other settings. You need to do that anyway to know what c does, for example.\n. Yes, \"its local working directory\" means ctrlp has its own cwd. This is mentioned right at the top. And \"outside of ctrlp\" doesn't mean \"outside of vim\", it means exactly \"outside of ctrlp\". So the cwd used here is the non-ctrlp cwd.\n. I'd love to. I just honestly don't see how I can make this part any clearer. As in I don't know how. And since no one else has complaint in the past one year and a half, I'm inclined to believe that the majority of people understand it just fine.\n. My English isn't very good. If anyone cares enough to make any part of the help better, no matter how little, please go ahead and do so. Pull requests are always most welcome.\n. This will create a <c-@> mapping which you can use to toggle mruf_relative while in the prompt:\n``` vim\nlet g:ctrlp_buffer_func = {\n    \\ 'enter': 'PrtEnFunc',\n    \\ }\nfunc! PrtEnFunc()\n    nnoremap   c-@ :call ToggleMRURelative()\nendfunc\nfunc! ToggleMRURelative()\n    let g:ctrlp_mruf_relative = !g:ctrlp_mruf_relative\n    call ctrlp#call('s:Reset', {})\n    call ctrlp#call('s:PrtClearCache')\nendfunc\n```\nI'm still undecided about adding this in, and the most I'll probably add is the ToggleMRURelative function.\n. I've already made the change, just haven't merged it. Also, that snippet is supposed to go into .vimrc, so you can choose the key and use it in any case.\n. Crashes like that are usually caused by problems in the environment or bugs in Vim itself. Your best bet is to keep updating Vim and avoid using this setup. :Ggrep is also a third party command. Plus, see tpope/vim-fugitive#306.\n. That already exists. You can use ; in filename mode to filter the directories in front of the filename.\n. Oh I'm sorry, what you're proposing is a bit different. It's indeed nice to have. I'll look into improving the existing ;.\n. > maybe we can mark this somewhere in the help file.\nIt's mentioned in the help file, actually, under the ctrlp-input-formats section.\n. They are actually pretty much self-explanatory and extremely obvious once you do something that changes them. You don't really need to care what they indicate from the start (or at all) so I don't think documentation is necessary.\n. Yes, that's correct. The \"ring\" rotates when you use <c-f> or <c-b>. And prt changes when you use <s-tab>. It might be nice to have all these explained throughout but it's really not necessary. You don't need to understand them to use anything, and your first guesses are most probably correct.\n. Nothing unless you know what you're using <s-tab> for.\n. I can see that there's always someone who finds it confusing, at least at first.\nBut I also don't think it's worth documented. You don't need to understand the statusline to do anything. Plus the help is already long as it is, people barely read it.\n@jsit they aren't tabs because there are more than 3 extensions. And you'll see what <-> is once you use the feature that changes it.\n\nIs there an option to define the separator characters? I looked but didn't see one\n\nWell, you can create your own statusline with g:ctrlp_status_func. Change everything if you feel like doing so.\n. @lsiden using an option (g:ctrlp_status_func) to customize the statusline is a bit different from forking and making change directly to the code. The former is what I am saying and mean.\nWhy do you think there's an option in the first place? Why don't I just not add it and tell everyone to fork the project, like you're saying? The option is there precisely because I figured some people would want to change the statusline, that whatever I chose wouldn't satisfy everyone.\n@jsit is for aesthetic good enough a reason? Because that was the reason the <prev>={current}=<next> was chosen.\n. @lsiden I don't think I'm being sarcastic(?). I always try to be matter of fact with my responses. I don't speak English natively, nor as a secondary language, so I'm sorry if somehow I gave off the wrong tone.\n. Not exactly what this option is for, but you can use g:ctrlp_abbrev to make hyphens be read as underscores:\nvim\nlet g:ctrlp_abbrev = {\n    \\ 'abbrevs': [\n        \\ {\n        \\ 'pattern': '-',\n        \\ 'expanded': '_',\n        \\ 'mode': 'pfrz',\n        \\ },\n        \\ ]\n    \\ }\nCheck the docs if you want to know more about this option.\n. Have you looked into the options? What do you think of g:ctrlp_use_caching and g:ctrlp_clear_cache_on_exit?\n. Ok, closing. It seems you primarily just want to keep the cache file after exiting Vim. You can already tell ctrlp to do that, and you can also delete/update the cache whenever you like from both outside and inside of ctrlp.\n. No, it's not possible with ctrlp, but you can tell Vim to delete (or delist) a buffer when it's hidden:\nvim\nau BufRead * setl bufhidden=delete\nThose buffers will then only show up when you run :ls!.\nOtherwise, what do you think about tagging the active buffers (probably with an a like :ls does)?\n. You can remove all MRU files outside the project with g:ctrlp_mruf_relative. Mixed mode will then effectively only show files and buffers.\n. Well, there are good, full featured plugins for managing buffers, so why build it into ctrlp? But people keep requesting this from time to time, I think I may just add it. There's also a .vimrc snippet which you can use right now, in #280.\n. Mixed mode basically loads all three File, Buffer, and MRU modes and the mixing also takes some more time. So naturally, it's slower than each of the modes.\nAnyway, buffer deletion may take a while since there are a few things I want to do first. I've also been a bit busy lately. If you don't want to wait, you can just create a mapping to delete a buffer in Buffer mode. All you have to do is grabbing the buffer name from the current line.\n. You can mark multiple files with <c-z>. So instead of opening each file, mark them both then press <c-v>.\nOtherwise, I think it's best to do this outside of ctrlp. Try creating an autocmd or a mapping that opens the spec file of the current file in a new vsplit.\n. No, it'd require reformatting the tag lines or at least the results. Tags files are sometimes quite large so the matching is slow already. I don't really want to bog it down by unnecessary reformatting.\n. This isn't a problem with CamelCase. It's because of ctrlp limiting the number of matches (which is exactly the max_height). This is something I can't fix without further slowing down the internal matching.\nSo if it annoys you too much, you should look into using g:ctrlp_match_func. Otherwise, try toggling regex or filename mode when the file you're looking for doesn't appear.\n. Yes, and there are already a few scripts/extensions written for match_func by other people. burke/matcher in C and at least 2 others in Python if I remember correctly.\n. Those don't mean much without the circumstances of how you get them or at least the Line numbers. I also can't reproduce it. So if it happens consistently, please narrow it down and provide steps to reproduce.\n. That's because you don't escape ~ in the pattern you use for ctrlp_custom_ignore. In Vim, when used in a pattern, ~ matches the last given substitute string.\n. Using ctrlp just for that is kind of inefficient, but if you insist, try something like this:\n``` vim\nlet g:ctrlp_regexp = 1\nlet g:ctrlp_by_filename = 1\ncom! A cal feedkeys(\":CtrlP .\\\".expand('%:t:r').\".\".( expand('%:e') == 'h' ? 'cc' : 'h' ).\"\\\", \"t\")\n```\n. It really won't be simple. Everything is centered around the prompt since it was the first piece that I started writing ctrlp on. And what you're looking for is basically a way to bypass this prompt.\nAnyway, how about saving the two variables (if they exist) and then reset them to their previous values after the feedkeys call? You can put all this into a function and call it with :A instead of calling feedkeys.\n. See :h laststatus.\n. You can use g:ctrlp_buffer_func to set laststatus locally to the ctrlp buffer. Just set it to 0 when entering and back to your default when exiting.\n. Did you use something like this?\n``` vim\nlet g:ctrlp_buffer_func = {\n    \\ 'enter': 'Function_Name_1',\n    \\ 'exit':  'Function_Name_2',\n    \\ }\nfunc! Function_Name_1()\n    set laststatus=0\nendfunc\nfunc! Function_Name_2()\n    set laststatus=2\nendfunc\n``\n. Then there's no other way.laststatusis the only option.\n. A few problems I can see now:\n1. Migrating/Invalidating the old cache files after changing the setting.\n2. Appending the file's path when putting the parts together. E.g.subdir/file->path/to/subdir/file.\n. You'll need to have ctags installed and then set the location of the binary withg:ctrlp_buftag_ctags_bin. After that, you can run:CtrlPBufTagfrom Vim's command line to start ctrlp in buffer-tag mode. If you don't know how to do these things, just search around the web and do some reading until you do.\n. No, it's not possible. Also, the cache dir is used for not only File mode but other things as well, like MRU, prompt history, logs, other extensions... Separating these will require some pretty big changes. So what's your standard situation? And how would this help?\n. Yes, you can refresh cache for each project or directory by simply pressingin ctrlp when searching in that project.:CtrlPClearCachedoes something similar. You don't have to, and shouldn't use:CtrlPClearAllCachesall the time.\n. That means you already set it before somewhere and in a different var type. Just:unletit before setting it again.\n. It's a limitation of the internal matching written in Vimscript. There's an old discussion about this exact issue in #110. Filename and regex modes can be used as quick workarounds, otherwise you can tryg:ctrlp_match_func.\n. You're not supposed to be able to do that. When you paste that way, the text goes directly into the buffer making up the match window, which is non-modifiable. The prompt (where you want to paste into) is a pseudo prompt and you can only enter input into it through designated mappings. You can find the mappings for pasting at:h ctrlp-pasting.\n. It's because` is mapped to inputting \\ into the prompt. If you want to map something in ctrlp, use one starting with a modifier key (ctrl, shift, etc).\n. Mixed mode starts up slower. Changing a default also potentially forces a lot people to have to adjust their config. I generally only consider a change if it helps speed things up, avoid confusions, or is otherwise really necessary.\n. I'm aware of this but have always thought it's only a minor inconvenient, since you can quickly toggle by_filename with <c-d>. by_filename also dictates quite a few things, so I'll have to see if I can reasonably separate it.\n. Yes, it's like Shougo said, ctrlp only operates in Normal mode and j, k are already used for inputting j k.\n. Depending on where you place a mapping, it may be overwritten by another mapping or sometimes re-encoded, thus is lost. In this case, it's because Vim can't tell <c-s-...> and <c-...> apart, so they overwrite each other whenever one is defined. <c-p> is already used by ctrlp as the default mapping and loaded after .vimrc.\n. See :h g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings.\n. There should be documentation on how to write the custom glob function. But mostly this doesn't seem to fit in with the other g:ctrlp_user_command settings, replacing a function as opposed to running a command with system().\n. It's because Vim's new regexp engine is still being worked on.\nIf you search for new regexp engine: in this file: ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/patches/7.3/README , you'll find entries for bugs like only accepts up to \\{,10} Attempts to match \"^\" at every character, and a lot of {expression} not supported.\nIt's unreasonable to try to account for all of those bugs. You should use a slightly older version (~ 7.3.900) and wait until the new engine is stable to update Vim.\n. Reported to the dev mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/vim_dev/4L7p28MYIX0\n. @rene-aguirre what particular error did you run into? I haven't noticed anything else since 7.3.1223.\n. That sounds like it's the same error in OP.\n. @zdm that's an unrelated error that I don't think has much to do with ctrlp, or with the new regexp engine. See #248. Line 15 of BuildPrompt() is a :redraw command. So it's just as likely to occur at any random time you use :redraw anywhere.\n. Fixed in 53f3b2b.\n. It can't work with that. For example, with these entries:\nparent/submodule\nparent/submodule/.git\nparent/submodule/subdir\nThe pattern only matches the entry that has .git, so only the .git dir itself and everything under it are ignored.\n. Closing. This is impossible without specifying the submodule dirs.\n. Change it to a key that you know works to make sure PrtClearCache() is actually called. Also, you don't need to edit autoload/ctrlp.vim, there's an option for changing the mappings.\nSo try this, for example:\nvim\n  let g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings = {\n    \\ 'ToggleRegex()':        ['<F5>'],\n    \\ 'PrtClearCache()':      ['<c-r>'],\n    \\ }\n. From what you describe, it looks like <F5> is being intercepted before Vim and Vim is interpreting an escape sequence as multiple keypresses.\n. Closing. This is almost definitely an issue with your term config, and not anything vimscript.\nEven when you don't map <F5> (ctrlp was the last place), pressing <F5> still does just about the same thing, and which is distinctive to an escape sequence: ctrlp is closed and then a seemingly random action is performed.\n. So I completely forgot about <esc> being mapped can cause this. See #432. Also, since <F5> has never been reported before, it looks like your terminal may be doing something unusual, e.g. sending extra escape sequences.\n. Duplicate of this request #350.\n. If using mappings isn't ideal for you, you can try using local .vimrc, or .lvimrc as some people call it. But for setting a one-time value, you need to call the init function directly:\nvim\ncall ctrlp#init(0, { 'mode': 'ra' })\n. Closing. Specifying it when calling init() gives enough flexibility, I think.\n. It's because it's rather complicated to make the highlighting always work perfectly for the non-path types. So for now only 'path' is supported.\n. Yes, it's on my todo list for ctrlp. I'll definitely implement it, once things are figured out.\n. Yes, it's like Shougo said. And it only happens in the ctrlp buffer because the <esc> mapping is buffer local. To solve your problem, you can either try a different &term, or remove the <esc> mapping with the following setting, there's no other way:\nvim\n  let g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings = {\n    \\ 'PrtExit()': ['<c-c>', '<c-g>'],\n    \\ }\nOtherwise, don't use arrow keys but <c-j> <c-k> to move the selection.\n. See also #209.\n. Then maybe it's because timeoutlen is set to 0 by default. But this is required for the inputting to work. In any case, there's no other options. You can try remapping the moving selection functions to some other keys you can use if using <c-j> <c-k> is somehow not an option.\nAlso, the ctrlp plugin itself doesn't load with compatible set, so the problem shouldn't be reproducible in that setting.\n. Just a thought, but if you can, try setting ttimeoutlen to a non-negative number (e.g. 100) so that you'll have different delays for key codes (100) and mappings (0).\n. Reproducible. I'll push a fix out soon.\n. That's impossible. The prompt is created with command line's output and Vim's command line can't be moved.\n. In a larger sense, yes, anything is possible. What I mean is that it's impossible with the way ctrlp operates now which is only in Normal mode. I'd have to change to a completely different inputting method, and rewrite much of ctrlp's core, just so the input prompt could be moved to the top along with the match window.\nAlso, ctrlp's interface is directly based on cmd-t's and lusty explorer's, in both of these you can't move the input prompt. Only in plugins that use Insert mode for inputting, the input prompt can be moved. Again, I mean among the plugins that I know of.\n. It is possible. See :h ctrlp-input-formats.\n. No, there isn't since ctrlp isn't based on fuzzyfinder. Recursive is more desirable than single directory search which isn't much better than <tab> completion with :e, which in turn is similar to how filename completion works in the shell.\n. Since you mention it, if I was happy with unite back then, ctrlp would have never been released or even started. It's a good thing that unite has improved a lot and now has many features ctrlp has. And I mean that. I'll switch to a different plugin or a different editor myself, if it better suits my needs.\n. That's a custom statusline created by powerline (a Vim plugin), not ctrlp's default statusline. You'll have to look into powerline's documentation and themes if you want to change those colors.\n. By default, g:ctrlp_custom_ignore doesn't get applied when you use g:ctrlp_user_command. You can check the notes under :h g:ctrlp_user_command for more details.\n. There's an option for this: g:ctrlp_buftag_types.\n. I see. I didn't realize it's supported by ctags.\n. See #443.\n. That doesn't have anything to do with ctrlp or the ctrlp repo. Check your local setup, you're referring to a nonexistent commit.\n. @aufula You can try turning on g:ctrlp_key_loop and see if it works with your input method. If it doesn't then there's no other way, since each character need to be mapped in Normal mode.\n. You can try setting a bigger max height for the match window to get more results, and/or toggle regexp mode for exact matching. As long as the some_file.ext is found, it's placed first.\n. It's intended. You're not supposed to be able to scroll pass what is on the list. You can increase the max height of the match window if you want more results.\n. Because it's faster to list exactly the number of results needed to fill the window, than list more but they aren't visible and you have to scroll to see them.\n. Then just increase the max height. There's little difference, I'm not sure it's worth a new setting.\n. I can't see the images. Can you re-upload them somewhere else?\n. Also, running :syntax on doesn't change anything for me.\n. I see. It's still not reproducible. Can you simplify your config and find whatever that contributes to this? Also, what ctrlp version are you using? What's your Vim version? Does it happen when you run :syntax enable? What happens if you have this in your .vimrc?\nvim\nhi CtrlPLinePre guifg=red ctermfg=red\nThe highlight group for the > char is CtrlPLinePre, which by default uses your colorscheme's Normal group's background color as its foreground color.\n. OK, I think I found the cause. It's the :hi clear line that many colorschemes have. I use a modified, stripped down version of molokai which doesn't have that line, so even in minimum config, the issue didn't manifest.\n. It's not easy to avoid Vim's :tselect menu when using :tjump, since it's the default and the only behavior.\nI'm going to need you to provide a test case including the tag names, the filenames corresponding to the tags. Also, the 3 tags files and their relative locations.\nWhat do you mean by \"set currently searched string\"? Replacing :tjump would be even more complicated than avoiding :tselect.\n. The feedkeys() is only run once when you're done searching and are jumping to the tag. It's needed for respecting fold options. But what does it have anything to do with replacing :tj? And what do you consider smarter?\n. Oh I see. You can pass whole strings into the prompt with g:ctrlp_default_input.\n. It looks like there's no way to get the correct counts for use in :[count]tag. They desync with the counts on the menu as soon as there are 2 duplicates of the same tag in the active buffer. No way to recalculate and Vim doesn't provide any kind of reference.\nThis means using the :tselect menu in this case is unavoidable, but it's possible to enter the number for this menu automatically.\n. It's already doing that. But as I said, those numbers easily become unusable for :[count]tag.\n. That still has the desyncing problem, I think.\n. You mean you want it to highlight only the individual characters, not the entire matched string? This won't be simple since the matching is done with match() which only returns the first position.\n. It certainly does. Please go ahead with the pull request.\nThanks!\n. @aaronjensen some main functions in ctrlp are called with sil! to make it a bit more invisible/unobtrusive. So you may have to track down and remove a few of those instances for the messages to appear.\n. No, don't worry about that just yet.\n. There isn't such a function built in. But you can modify this. Just replace the exe 'lc!' with a return.\n. By default, buffers with buftype=nofile are avoided because they are often used by plugins to display information. You can control this behavior with g:ctrlp_reuse_window.\n. @Wolfy87 That option doesn't work like that. See :h g:ctrlp_reuse_window.\n. Yes, just enable g:ctrlp_mruf_relative.\n. Looks like you have data ignored with custom_ignore in your .vimrc here. If you want to keep that ignore rule, try something like \\(mnt/\\)\\@<!data.\n. That can potentially increase startup time exponentially with the number of buffers. Each buffer has to be compared with the others every time Buffer mode is used and the buffer list has been changed.\n. That will just add the extra step of generating the hash keys on top of everything. The comparison can simply be done directly with the tail.\nThe small number of non-uniques also isn't the issue. It's having to walk through the list to compare and find them, especially on the first time Buffer mode is open (all buffers are new), or on a subsequent opening when any number of buffers might have been added/removed/renamed.\n. I wrote this in my last attempt at shortening bufnames, which should explain my reluctance. It's basically something like that versus looping through the list once with fnamemodify().\n. No, ctrlp is a finder, there's no option to show all files. You have to search and narrow down the results.\n. If you don't want to touch the options, just create a mapping for :CtrlP ..\n. No, it's not possible because of the way the prompt is built.\n. This is intentional. Unlisted buffers and buffers with non-empty buftype (help, quickfix, etc) aren't included in the listing to reduce cluster. Not sure if I want to change that.\n. ctrlp has its own buffer-local mappings. Take a look at g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings if you want to change them.\n. Changing an option name will break people's config. I try to avoid it unless it's really necessary. This seems too arbitrary to warrant a change. Besides, it's not going to work anyway since the var type is not supported. It's a List, while session can only store String and Number types.\n. wildignore does get applied unless you're using g:ctrlp_user_command without setting the ignore key to 1.\n. That's really odd. wildignore only gets applied when indexing a directory. If the files are listed in the cache file then they can definitely be found in vim. Also, try this syntax for ignoring a directory set wildignore+=*/build/*.\n. Yes, you can change them with g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings.\n. I'm going to need more details. What's your config for ctrlp? What happens if you set g:ctrlp_max_files to 0, then run ctrlp and clear the cache with <F5>? What happens if you reset wildignore with :set wildignore&? Does this problem happen with any directory other than your project?\n. Without more informations, it seems to be because you've reached the max_files limit (default is 10000). You can try either setting it to a bigger number, or to 0 which means no limit. There are maybe too many files in the first few levels of directories in your project.\n. That's definitely max_files. It's ignored when the commands in user_command are being used. So if you want to make sure this problem doesn't happen when you aren't in a git repo, just set g:ctrlp_max_files to a bigger number or to 0.\n. g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings is the option for that. If you search for mappings in the help, you should find it mentioned quite a few times.\n. Does (or did) airline detect the present of ctrlp? If the ctrlp.vim script wasn't even loaded, then it probably wasn't its fault if something in airline didn't load as a result. Also, the welcome info can be cleared by changes to the statusline.\n. Removing on demand is currently not possible. But if the current buffer isn't supported, you can simply leave the result list empty. I don't see why the extension has to be removed. Take buffertag.vim for an example, there's no harm leaving it there when the buffer has a FileType not supported by ctags.\n. I think so, yes. And you can change the labels right from your extension's init function. They aren't used until after the result list has been populated. So first find the Dictionary defining the extension in g:ctrlp_ext_vars, then change the values of the naming keys.\n. 10 is just the default number of results in the match window. It'll show you different files once you start searching. So just type in a few characters of the file you want to search for.\n. This isn't what it is for, but yes, you can get that by setting g:ctrlp_mruf_relative to 1.\n. No, there isn't such a shortcut. If you really want that, try using feedkeys() in a mapping to do the <c-z> and <c-o> steps automatically. Check out g:ctrlp_buffer_func.\n. No, when you use user_command, wildignore and custom_ignore are not applied by default.\nCan you explain what you mean by \"assign some directories to index directory\"? Currently, you can only specify one directory tree with :CtrlP. There's not yet a way to specify multiple directory trees.\n. Well, for now, you can either use some clever ignore rules (try negative-lookahead) to ignore everything else, or setup some mappings that each open ctrlp for a specific subdir.\nThere's already a feature request for supporting multiple starting directories, so I'm going to close this.\n. I think I prefer to keep ctrlp as a finder. If you want to use only the opening mechanism, try using Vim's feedkeys(). Also, take a look here.\n. Yes, this is simply because <esc> is mapped, so it can't really be fixed. But there are some ways to workaround, you can check #432 and #209.\nAlternatively, don't use arrow keys to navigate but <c-j>, <c-k>, etc.\n. This is because ctrlp only lists the first results found. That is if the foo.file is indexed and cached. You can solve this by toggling either filename or regexp modes with <c-d> <c-r>, or increase the max result or max height values.\n. Make sure the file is indexed. Set max_files to 0. Also toggle both filename and regexp modes, use something like ^foo.file. If the file is indexed, then it can be found.\nBTW, max result doesn't work like max_files. Setting max result to 0 only sets it to 1.\n. The selection is a cursorline. So it's Solarized that has a cursorline color too similar to the background color. You'll have to redefine the CursorLine color group, either in .vimrc or in the colorscheme.\n. For the first question, use :CtrlP path where you can only specify one directory path at a time. For the second question, there's a Most Recently Used (MRU) mode that remembers the files you've opened. For more details, check out :h :CtrlP, :h ctrlp_working_path, :h :CtrlPMRU, and :h ctrlp_mruf.\n. If you use vim-airline, you'll have to change the statusline colors through the plugin somehow. For the non-statusline colors, then use .vimrc and/or the colorscheme.\n. That's one of the main purposes of the feature. It wouldn't be useful if the command wasn't used as soon as the user :cds into a subdir of their project because they had path_mode disabled for different reasons.\nSince you have a .git repo you want to be treated differently, I suggest putting a local .vimrc there to disable the user_command option.\n. Put it once, in the same directory as the .git dir. Just have a check for the cwd. If the cwd is a subdir, disable the option. An autocmd works, too, if you want this for every project.\nWhat you favor against is one of the things that make this feature worthwhile. Since the feature is basically \"using this custom listing command in this particular directory\".\n. Thank you! I'll check it out as soon as I can. It may be in a while, though, since I've been incredibly busy lately.\n. @kdurant I haven't been able to check it out yet. Plus it's still a work-in-progress.\n. It's already possible. Check out g:ctrlp_abbrev. Just expand _ or \\ to an empty string.\n. No, it's not always needed. You can prevent it from being called by setting g:ctrlp_clear_cache_on_exit to 0.\n. Can you provide steps to reproduce the error? Does updating Vim help? It looks like the parser confuses the colons in the Dictionary with operators.\n. Thanks! I can't reproduce it in Vim 7.1.0 to 7.4.0, but in 7.0.0. Looks like it's an old bug with the parser when Dictionary was new. I use ternary operators often, however, so I may have to change a few other places as well.\n. Natively, you can try g:ctrlp_lazy_update which should alleviate it somewhat. Otherwise, you'll want to look into using external, non-vimscript matchers through g:ctrlp_match_func. There are a few around.\n. That'd be the proper way, I think.\n. You can set either hidden, autowrite, autowriteall, or confirm. If none of these options is set, commands that replace the current unsaved buffer will fail with an error. To avoid this, ctrlp opens a new split.\n. Can you get the full error message, especially the error code, and provide steps to reproduce? Include details like which mode you're in, the filename you're trying to open, the current working directory, etc. Also, try starting Vim with as less configuration as possible, ideally with only ctrlp.\n. Thanks! You get those errors because you've either set debug=msg or debug=throw somewhere in your Vim config. When not set, bufnr() returns -1 when no such buffer exists, and the error is omitted. Similarly with expand().\n. Yes, creating a new file in a vertical split is the default. You can change it with g:ctrlp_open_new_file.\n. Yes, matching is plugin-wide so you can't define a matcher for a specific mode or extension. But it does sound like something good to have.\n. No, highlighting of match is only supported in extensions that list filenames. I may try to extend it after #488.\nThis is the same request/issue as #431.\n. Do the splits have open files? What are their filetypes? If possible, can you provide those files as well?\nIt may have something to do with syntax highlighting being slow in Vim in general, and BuildPrompt() running redraw.\n. Glad you've solved it. Also, it's worth noting that syntax highlighting performance can otherwise be improved by setting a small synmaxcol, and small minlines maxlines for :syntax sync.\n. Yes, there is, by setting g:ctrlp_mruf_relative. For more MRU options, you can search for ctrlp_mruf in the docs.\n. I think I'll prefer keeping the cursor visible, since the cursorline by itself is sometimes pretty hard to see.\n. Actually, ctrlp's cursorline is Vim's default, enabled by set cursorline in the ctrlp window. And I still think the default cursor being visible is generally a good thing.\n. Yes, I understand you mean that cursor. What I'm trying to say is that it helps seeing the selected entry when the cursorline is hard to see. But hiding it when keyloop = 1 is fine.\n. Yes, when in the ctrlp prompt, you can press <c-\\> then press f to choose c[f]ile.\n. It's an intended behavior of Mixed mode. All mru files and buffers that are in the cwd as the regular files are filtered out to avoid duplicates. So if that mru file also shows up in Files mode, it'll show up in Mixed mode.\nThe reason the buffer and mru filter isn't run against the full files list from Files mode is because the list is often big enough to significantly slow down the mixing.\n. 1) It's in a hidden directory (.config), so for it to show up in Files mode, you need to at least set ctrlp_show_hidden.\n2) It's the step that determines whether or not a file has duplicates that is slow, i.e. comparing the buffer, mru and file lists.\n. By default, hidden files and hidden dirs (dotfiles and dotdirs) aren't listed. So if it shows up on your other laptop then there's something different. Also, in a subdir or not, it's still under the cwd.\n. Doing it the expected way isn't any more complicated, but as usual I have to choose between that and speed with some rough edges. If I have time, though, I'll probably rewrite Mixed mode and make it more flexible.\n. This is great. Thank you!\nAs for the filename, I'm not sure what the language code for Chinese is. If it's \"cn\" then the filename should be ctrlp.cnx.\n. You can set either hidden, autowrite, autowriteall, or confirm. But I think I should also try making this part a bit smarter. Those options shouldn't have to be set when working with the current buffer.\n. CtrlP has a feature that by default will zoom into the directory of the current file if the cwd is different. When you open file1_dir1.txt in links/dir1/, Vim will instead load the file1_dir1.txt file in nolinks/dir1/. The directory of the current file will then be nolinks/dir1/, while the cwd is still links.\nSo disabling the aforementioned feature with g:ctrlp_working_path_mode will solve your issue.\n. May I ask you to provide steps to reproduce? Also, what's your Vim version? Have you tried with minimal configuration (i.e. only CtrlP installed)? There's no freezing nor even any delay for me when I try opening a file this way.\n. Does it happen consistently?\nAs for starting Vim with minimal config, run:\nvim --noplugin -u path/to/a/.vimrc\nContent of this .vimrc:\nvim\nset nocp\nset runtimepath^=~/.vim/bundle/ctrlp.vim\nruntime! plugin/ctrlp.vim\nWith ~/.vim/bundle/ctrlp.vim a clone of the ctrlp.vim repo.\n. I still can't reproduce it, with or without tmux. And I doubt there's much I can do anyway with ctrlp being a vim script bound to Vim. The search window is basically a buffer named ControlP in a horizontal split with a few local mappings.\nI think I'm going to close this as it doesn't seem to worth the effort tracking down. With only 2-3 times, it's simpler to just avoid triggering it.\n. <c-c> is one of the default mappings to close ctrlp. To create new file, use <c-y>.\nYou might want to check out :h ctrlp-mappings as well, for the other available mappings.\n. You're not supposed to touch g:syntax_on, it's Vim's job to set/unset it whenever you run :syntax on/off/enable. Forcing the variable on while syntax is actually off will throw syntax highlighting detection off, and likely cause unexpected behaviors. So try removing the second line.\n. CtrlP doesn't do anything font-related. But those lines look like the cursorline, just multiple of it. You can test by setting cursorline in the other buffer.\nThe only thing I can think of here is to try changing Vim's linespace option, or terminal.app's equivalent. And if nothing else works, I guess you might just have to use a different font.\n. Ok I'm closing this. I doubt there's anything reasonable that I can do from CtrlP here, since this is font and term specific.\n. I believe this feature already exists. You can press <c-o>a to mark all files in the match window.\n. Yes, <c-o>c.\n. Sorry I forgot, g:ctrlp_arg_map needs to be set as well to enable the additional choices.\n. Can you clarify point 1? What seems to be a bug? Toggle the marking is what <c-z> is supposed to do.\nAs for point 2, it's a good point. I'll look into adding it. I didn't think anyone would use <c-o>a all that much so it's still rather basic.\n. 2.1 doesn't happen to me. The markings are just Vim's signs.\n. This looks great. But how does it interact with CtrlP's existing tab-completion? Also, since they are closely resemble, is merging them feasible?\n. @axelson see :h ctrlp-autocompletion. You need to type something first.\n. It's not supposed to. CtrlPLine helps you jump to a line in a file you're actively working on, not to a line anywhere. This also provides a mean to exclude some buffers, and is similar to Vim's :bufdo in that it only works on listed buffers.\n. You're misinterpreting the log. The clock column (first column) is recorded when the operations finish. You should look at the second column if you want to know how long each operation takes. So utils.vim's load time is only 0.433 ms. It's the \"BufEnter autocommands\" that is taking close to 1s (878.612 ms).\n. The a, d, and x choices are already mentioned under the mapping help section. The x again under its option. I just don't feel like they are practical enough to be shown in the inline help, which I want to keep a little less busy.\n. What does this have to do with ignoring results from submodules with custom_ignore? s:findroot() is only for finding a cwd. So if this change works, it'll only prevent submodules from being used as a cwd. Is that what you want?\nBut I don't think this is something that should be enforced and hard-coded in. If you want the superproject to always be the root, just use the .gitmodules or any other file as the root marker. Check out g:ctrlp_root_markers.\n. After a closer look, I think this not only won't work (aren't folder and directory the same thing?), and won't \"fix\" #427 (which doesn't need fixing), but will also break root finding for people who want to use a file as the root marker.\n. MiddleMouse is mapped to pasting from the clipboard register + by default. Not sure if I want to change it to *. See :h quoteplus and :h 'clipboard'.\nThat aside, PrtInsert() only accepts few certain arguments, not just any random string. And 'MiddleMouse' should be '<MiddleMouse>'.\nBut being able to specify the register there with PrtInsert() would be nice. I think I might add it.\n. The command is run with Vim's system(). Your user_command also works fine for me on Windows. If it only just stopped working, then it's probably something in your environment that changed.\nClosing this as I don't think it is something I can fix from CtrlP.\n. The only difference in CtrlP is the argument for --git-dir being passed through shellescape() first with &ssl off. But even with shellescape() removed and &ssl on, just the system() call it still works fine for me.\nYou can try testing with a clean Vim configuration, different paths and cwds. And if nothing else works, try specifying the full path to git.exe like this: '\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\bin\\git.exe\" --git-dir=%s/.git ls-files'.\n. I can't reproduce this. The file count goes down when I add more entries into either wildignore or custom_ignore.\nDoes turning off follow_symlinks change anything for you? You can do a simple test to see if those extra files are from vendor by temporarily moving vendor out of zeus.\nAnyway, CtrlP relies completely on Vim's globpath() for the indexing. You have vendor in wildignore, so globpath() should ignore it entirely. However, custom_ignore can only be applied after globpath() has finished indexing. So if globpath() is already slowed down by indexing all those files, there's no helping it.\n. There's probably a symlink pointing to directory outside.\n. If you're already in the home directory, typing the extra ~/ will show you a NO ENTRIES message, because ~/~/.vimrc doesn't exist. And if you keep trying to open it, CtrlP will attempt to create the file including the path to it.\nI guess the same thing happens with those symbols, there are no files with them in their names.\nI don't think I should add workarounds to prevent cases like this. The NO ENTRIES is very apparent. Someone could make a typo, or type <c-y> by mistake, or any other things. I don't think they should or could be prevented.\n. Does setting g:ctrlp_key_loop change anything? It sounds like tilde and grave are used as \"dead key\" modifiers on your Linux setup, to produce characters like \u00e0 \u00e3.\n. It's because you're using CtrlPMixed which includes files, buffers, and MRU files. The /etc/hosts entry you see is a MRU entry.\n. No, :CtrlP only shows files.\nTo clear MRUs, press <F7> while in MRU mode.\n. How exactly did you do those? Checking if there's only one file then call the accept function right from the init function should do it. If you want to send <cr>, try using feedkey().\n. Actually, I don't think this is possible, at least not yet. The init function is called before the prompt is rendered to properly close it. And there's no other point to accept the file until a selection is made by the user.\n. And if you don't want the file list cached, you can turn that off as well with g:ctrlp_use_caching.\n. You'll probably have more freedom using a local .vimrc for the project, and put the settings there. If you don't want to do that, a simple mapping to :CtrlP ../ should be suffice, I think.\n. There isn't. But this does sound useful. Thanks for the suggestion!\n. BufferTag relies entirely on ctags for the results and hasn't been changed in a while. So check if ctags is installed and working properly on your system.\n. It's just Vimscript being slow when the list is too large. You'll have to employ an external matcher with g:ctrlp_match_func, preferably written in a faster language. Nothing else really helps.\n. The longer the search string is, the further down the file list the matcher has to dig for results. Over 100k entries is a lot for a List. As said in the other issue, you'll have to use an external matcher written in a more suitable language. There are at least a few of these matchers around, last time I looked.\n. It's probably the root finding feature. You can try turning it off with g:ctrlp_working_path_mode.\n. The root finding/zooming feature is the only thing that interacts with the file system when starting in Buffer mode. In File mode, the sorting compares modified times, so it also interacts with the file system regardless of the file list being cached.\n. You can call s:PrtClearCache() with ctrlp#call({name} [, {args}]). Or just simulate <F5> with Vim's feedkeys(). The extension's init will be called again.\n. It's preserved by default, unless nolim is set to 1 in the extension.\n. You can get it by setting g:ctrlp_by_filename to 1.\n. You've probably reached the max_files limit. The default value is 15000.\n. It's because the CtrlP buffer is opened with :noautocmd, mostly to avoid issues with plugins that do things when autocmds are triggered.\nI also use UltiSnips frequently but haven't run into that. I use an older copy from last year, not sure which revision or version.\n. There were actually some old issues with plugins changing things expecting the match window to be a regular buffer. It's why I want it to be more invisible.\nHow about adding a check for the correct buffer before running the iunmap's? Someone may use :noautocmd or eventignore anytime and change to a different buffer, which will raise the same errors from UltiSnips.\n. It's because you're setting prompt_mappings in buffer_func, and for when CtrlP is about to close.\nJust move the first prompt_mappings setting out of MyPrtMappings() and remove the buffer_func line. Or if you use MyPrtMappings() elsewhere, then just call MyPrtMappings() directly.\n. ",

I just came to work. I'll work with it for few hours, then I'll let you know...\n. Ok, found a minor problem.\nWhen you work with multiple files, ctrlp caches tags for first file.\nWhen you switch to another file you need to Hit F5 for tags to be updated.\nI suggest doing that automatically when CtrlPTag is opened, because it will be annoying as hell to update tags every time I open ctrlp. Also that could prevent CtrlPTag from jumping to wrong line of code, if file was updated (I haven't tested, but I suppose it would jump to wrong line)\nI hit a bug..... CtrlPTag can't find tag... when I select any tag and hit Enter it opens Empty buffer saying: \"CtrlP: Tag not found.\"\n. Wow... this happens even if I delete tags file and EasyTags creates new (fresh) one\n. For sake of environment differences I suggest you take my vim config\ngit clone https://github.com/graudeejs/dot.vim\ncd ~/.vim\nmake\nrm -f ~/tmp/.vim/eazytags/*\nvim vimrc\nWait 4-5 seconds for EasyTags to generate tags\nnow when you open CtrlPTag select tag and press Enter it will show \"Tag not found\" error.\n. It works after last commit\nWill do more testing...\n. @kied..... CtrlPTag really needs to show tags of current file by default.\nI don't think it would be hard to implement (Need an idea on this?)\n. taglist('.*') return list of hashes.\nSimple algorithm would be check each element in list.\nAll you need to check is if filename keys value of each element (hash) match current files name\nThe result should probably be stored in other list. This would allow to implement quick switching to all tags mode and back to current buffers tags.\nI don't think it would be slow, but I'm VimL noob. Anyway, I think user will work with current buffers tags most of the time (also would be good to sort tags by weight according to filename path, similar to how file fuzzy searching is implemented now)\n. Another bug: Currently when you search for tag it show all tags. Now if there are multiple tags with same name but in different files, CtrlPTag can jump to wrong file (even if you manually [with arrow keys] select which tag you want to jump to)\n. It is now showing list of tags and from where they are, and asks me to enter number of tag that I want to open. No good.\nhttp://failiem.lv/thumb_show.php?i=svvoeax&n=not_so_good.jpg\n. Why not?\nMost of time while I work (as Rails programmer) I'll have more >1 tags with same name\n. I see\n. I still think removing \"parent\" makes it less confusing\n. Wow, that looks like some pretty big commit\n. OK, it works, I love it.\nThanks\n. Right... I'm working too much with rails lately.... :)\n. Very interesting\n. nope, it works perfectly fine even with over 250 buffers\n. No that's not the point. The point is that when I load session, ctrlp isn't even loaded until I hit ^C-P.\nBut since ^C-P is overriden (somehow, and I don't understand why), ctrlp will never get loaded and I get error, that CtrlP command is not found\nAbout the how overriding ^C-P happens. Overriding ^C-P happend when I edit some file and then run CtrlP and then save session. In session file ^C-P will be mapped to :CtrlP. However in my vimrc I've set it to \n<Esc>:call LoadIfNeeded(['ctrlp'])<CR>:CtrlPCurWD<CR>\nI hope you understand the problem here.\n. Thanks...\n.

Ok, found a minor problem.\nWhen you work with multiple files, ctrlp caches tags for first file.\nWhen you switch to another file you need to Hit F5 for tags to be updated.\nI suggest doing that automatically when CtrlPTag is opened, because it will be annoying as hell to update tags every time I open ctrlp. Also that could prevent CtrlPTag from jumping to wrong line of code, if file was updated (I haven't tested, but I suppose it would jump to wrong line)\nI hit a bug..... CtrlPTag can't find tag... when I select any tag and hit Enter it opens Empty buffer saying: \"CtrlP: Tag not found.\"\n. Wow... this happens even if I delete tags file and EasyTags creates new (fresh) one\n. For sake of environment differences I suggest you take my vim config\ngit clone https://github.com/graudeejs/dot.vim\ncd ~/.vim\nmake\nrm -f ~/tmp/.vim/eazytags/*\nvim vimrc\nWait 4-5 seconds for EasyTags to generate tags\nnow when you open CtrlPTag select tag and press Enter it will show \"Tag not found\" error.\n. It works after last commit\nWill do more testing...\n. @kied..... CtrlPTag really needs to show tags of current file by default.\nI don't think it would be hard to implement (Need an idea on this?)\n. taglist('.*') return list of hashes.\nSimple algorithm would be check each element in list.\nAll you need to check is if filename keys value of each element (hash) match current files name\nThe result should probably be stored in other list. This would allow to implement quick switching to all tags mode and back to current buffers tags.\nI don't think it would be slow, but I'm VimL noob. Anyway, I think user will work with current buffers tags most of the time (also would be good to sort tags by weight according to filename path, similar to how file fuzzy searching is implemented now)\n. Another bug: Currently when you search for tag it show all tags. Now if there are multiple tags with same name but in different files, CtrlPTag can jump to wrong file (even if you manually [with arrow keys] select which tag you want to jump to)\n. It is now showing list of tags and from where they are, and asks me to enter number of tag that I want to open. No good.\nhttp://failiem.lv/thumb_show.php?i=svvoeax&n=not_so_good.jpg\n. Why not?\nMost of time while I work (as Rails programmer) I'll have more >1 tags with same name\n. I see\n. I still think removing \"parent\" makes it less confusing\n. Wow, that looks like some pretty big commit\n. OK, it works, I love it.\nThanks\n. Right... I'm working too much with rails lately.... :)\n. Very interesting\n. nope, it works perfectly fine even with over 250 buffers\n. No that's not the point. The point is that when I load session, ctrlp isn't even loaded until I hit ^C-P.\nBut since ^C-P is overriden (somehow, and I don't understand why), ctrlp will never get loaded and I get error, that CtrlP command is not found\nAbout the how overriding ^C-P happens. Overriding ^C-P happend when I edit some file and then run CtrlP and then save session. In session file ^C-P will be mapped to :CtrlP. However in my vimrc I've set it to \n<Esc>:call LoadIfNeeded(['ctrlp'])<CR>:CtrlPCurWD<CR>\nI hope you understand the problem here.\n. Thanks...\n. ",

I modified code to handle few mapped key codes.\n. @kein could you please show me the code you modified? and please let me know way to reproduce.\n. I don't get any problems with your changes.\n\nkien++\n. For example\nvim\nlet s:foo_var = {\n\\  'init':   'ctrlp#foo#init()',\n\\  'exit':   'ctrlp#foo#exit()',\n\\  'accept': 'ctrlp#foo#accept',\n\\  'lname':  'foo',\n\\  'sname':  'foo',\n\\  'type':   'path',\n\\  'sort':   0,\n\\  'with_index': 1,\n\\}\nIf with_index is set as 1, passing index instead of string. How about this?\n. For example, Is it possible to be change to add conceal character to hide (1) ?\n. However, afaik, filtering entries does not work well without 'type': 'path'.\n. and I hope that ctrlp don't match characters following with conceal_id_begin_char.\n. Ah, It's bad!\n. This index should be index in a whole, not filtered.\n. Try to use type which using acceptfile ?\n. I'm using ctrlp-git. And this extension uses acceptfile to open the file.\nBut ctrlp-git does not close anything. So I wonder why current buffer is closed...\n. Just fixed! Thanks.\n. ctrlp have pseudo cursor & cursorline.\n\nSo it don't need to show vim's cursor.\n. Ah, it seems that the cursor will be visible when keyloop = 1.\n\n. I'm not talking about cursorline. I'm talking about blinking cursor displayed on the terminal.\n. ^M is not multi-byte character. It's CR-LF.\n. Hmm, @kien seems not actively. I don't mind to work for ctrlp.vim if someone want to use ctrlp.vim. But I want to hear him that he want that ctrlp.vim will be doing maintenance by other hands.\n. @gaving probaly, you don't know how ctrlp is conservative plugin.

If i go back to my current project it still hangs.\nIt doesn't seem to be crashing out on me now, although i use ctrl+c to stop the process when it hangs.  it gets to 846 before it stops.  Perhaps that is some clue for me to look somewhere.  \nAny ideas on next steps to see why this directory structure breaks?\n. Update.  Went back to vim after writing last comment and it appears the plugin is working now.  It is just very slow on the initial build of the buffer.  Any ideas what to look for in terms of problems files?\n. Found the directory that was causing the issue.  Loads of files generated by tests that weren't cleaned up.  would appear the number of files created caused the massive slow down.\nAll looks okay now.\nNot seen the same original crash again.

But thanks for the tip though.\n. No worries. I will give this a go next week and let you know how I get on.\n. I could seem to get the above instructions working.  Couldn't figure how to get ctrlp into my runtime path.\nHowever i ran ctrlp in a different directory than the project i am working on and it seemed to work fine.\nI created a new rails project and git inited it and ctrlp works fine. If i go back to my current project it still hangs.\nIt doesn't seem to be crashing out on me now, although i use ctrl+c to stop the process when it hangs.  it gets to 846 before it stops.  Perhaps that is some clue for me to look somewhere.  \nAny ideas on next steps to see why this directory structure breaks?\n. Update.  Went back to vim after writing last comment and it appears the plugin is working now.  It is just very slow on the initial build of the buffer.  Any ideas what to look for in terms of problems files?\n. Found the directory that was causing the issue.  Loads of files generated by tests that weren't cleaned up.  would appear the number of files created caused the massive slow down.\nAll looks okay now.\nNot seen the same original crash again.  Will keep you posted if i see it again.\n. ",

Just poking around in the code. Might actually be easier to fork the plugin, refactor the OpenMulti() function and do this by marking buffers and then using a key combination to close them (instead of open them). Evening project!\n. Just my $0.02, but I definitely prefer hidden buffers. Often I'll bounce between two buffers while I'm still in the process of editing (as I'm cross-referencing, for example), so this would be better as an opt-in thing.\n. If I understand what it's supposed to do, I can probably test it. I work with some romance and Nordic languages that include accented vowels like \u00e9 and \u00e8 and Nordic characters like \u00f0, \u00fe and \u00e6. Not sure if the idea is to allow those characters to be typed in ctrlp or not though. Currently they don't type correctly, at least on OS X's Terminal.app.\n. Holy crap it works :) I can type all those characters from European languages just fine with this patch merged in. I can't type Japanese Hiragana (\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u308f) or Katakana (\u30b3\u30f3\u30cb\u30c1\u30ef) using the Kotoeri keyboard on OS X, but that does some weird stuff where you have to type sequences of English characters in order to type a single Japanese character.\n. The fuzzy search doesn't trip on the multibyte characters neither.\n. @mattn I was saying that without your patch the characters can't be typed. With your patch (which I only tried after writing that first comment) I can confirm that the characters are typed as expected. I think it should be merged, since it's definitely a big improvement in the i18n department :)\n. @kien, no problem. I just tried the mappings you mention and got different behaviour. Tab does nothing (might be because I also have supertab installed), but <c-\\> brings up \"Insert: c[w]ord/c[f]ile/[s]earch/[v]isual/[c]lipboard/[r]egister?\" and <c-o> brings up the \"Open:\" prompt. I wonder if it makes a difference what Terminal is used.\n. @mattn @kien tested the update, tab now works, as do <c-o> and <c-\\>. The multibyte chars still work too.\n. I might take another stab at this. My extremely limited knowledge of Vimscript and of the source code in ctrlp tripped me up last time. Good to have some example code to go by :) I was aiming for something where you could <c-z> to mark a number of buffers (this already works out-of-the-box), then use some combination to delete those buffers. Starting with handling just a single buffer would be a good start though!\nI'm pretty bad at opening lots of buffers and then having the tedious task of closing the ones I'm no longer using.\n. I'm currently taking this snippet at looking to provide it as a plugin with the C-z functionality I was after too. Has anybody already done this and not linked to it here?\n@kien doing let g:ctrlp_buffer_func = .... in a plugin seems dangerous, since either the plugin will override a user setting, or the user will effectively disable the plugin by overriding this setting. Is there another way to let ctrlp know about the mapping function that is safe to do from shared code?\n. We're doing Hack Day for the next couple of days at work and I'm keen to use that time to add this functionality to ctrlp via an extension in a separate plugin. Some problems I need to solve are:\n1. Deleting multiple buffers that have been marked (solved).\n2. Finding a way to make sure let g:ctrlp_buffer_func = 'MyPluginFunction' doesn't break any user expectations with what they have in their own vimrc.\nHere's a work in progress version of the snippet that allows the use of C-z to mark multiple buffers and close them.\n``` vim\nlet g:ctrlp_buffer_func = { 'enter': 'CtrlPBDelete' }\nfunction! CtrlPBDelete()\n  nnoremap   c-@ :call DeleteMarkedBuffers()\nendfunction\nfunction! s:DeleteMarkedBuffers()\n  \" list all marked buffers\n  let marked = ctrlp#getmarkedlist()\n\" the file under the cursor is implicitly marked\n  if empty(marked)\n    call add(marked, fnamemodify(ctrlp#getcline(), ':p'))\n  endif\n\" call bdelete on all marked buffers\n  for fname in marked\n    let bufid = fname =~ '[\\d+*No Name]$' ? str2nr(matchstr(fname, '\\d+'))\n          \\ : fnamemodify(fname[2:], ':p')\n    exec \"silent! bdelete\" bufid\n  endfor\n\" refresh ctrlp\n  exec \"normal \\\"\nendfunction\n```\nI'm sure there are some bugs with it, but I have another day and half to work on this anyway.\n. Improved further and turned into a plugin. Pull requests welcomed. https://github.com/d11wtq/ctrlp_bdelete.vim\n. I'd be opposed to a non-Vimscript script personally. The big selling point for CtrlP over other solutions is that it will work with a vanilla Vim install. I tend to avoid plugins that depend on Ruby support etc (mostly because it's not compiled into Vim in all the places I use it).\n. Use :BundleInstall! with the bang, otherwise it will just keep your currently installed version, or just cd to the directory and update by hand.\n. Let's not start adding dependencies on Vim being built with Ruby/Python support. You can just use F5 to clear the cache. It would also be possible for you to do this yourself, if you wanted to run a separate process to watch the filesystem. Just write a .modified_time file or something that you can check for, then write a function that checks that file and decides if it needs to run :CtrlPClearAllCaches before running :CtrlP or not.\n. Does your project use multiple git repositories nested inside each other? Are apps and spec in a different git repo, higher up the directory hierarchy to wherever you opened vim?\n. @happypeter so basically just see ; as an AND operator? this;and that;and the other.\n. @lsiden have you changed ttimeoutlen in your vim config to something too low, perhaps?\n. Have you change ttimeoutlen in your vimrc, by any chance? Values too short in that setting will cause Vim to mis-interpret the arrow keys as ESC followed by A, B, C or D (since that's what the arrow keys actually send, just as a quick sequence). Vim needs a short amount of time to figure out of the initial ESC is part of a longer sequence, like an arrow key press, and if ttimeoutlen is too short, it doesn't receive the second part of the sequence in time.\n. I've also seen a plugin (I forget the name) that does 'save on mouse out' break the arrow keys in this way. A colleague uninstalled it, as it stopped him from using the arrow keys in insert mode.\n.

To do that, open ctrlp, then press ctrl-r to switch to regexp mode. Now type ^\\. and files beginning with '.' should be shown.\n.

Moved to https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim/pull/16\n. Moved to https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim/pull/17\n. @nfvs this looks useful. Would you like it merging into https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim since this fork appears to no longer maintained as of 12 months ago?\n. Moved to: https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim/pull/2\n. I use :CtrlPBuffer for that and have it mapped to <c-b>. So just <c-b> ENTER to switch between two open buffers. There's also MRU (most recently used) mode that will include files not currently open. Of course, the vanilla Vim way :b# ENTER is pretty quick too.\n. This won't get merged as the author has not been seen in a couple of years.\n. Thanks @kien!\n. ",

    "lervag": "True. An option is to remove the beginning of the line instead of the end of the line.\n. In changeset d869903 I did some minor updates where I added a path filter. The reason for adding the filter is that I have some problems with ctrlp using the full path names instead of some symbolic links I have, which makes the path names very long. If I apply the path filter first, most of my long file name problems dissappear.\nI know this might not be interesting for to pull. I also made a change to the file name shortener, in that I made it possible to use a custom function \"MyPathShortener\".\nTo summarize: You might want to look at this and see if the idea of giving the user an option to filter the path or file names is something you like. Perhaps an idea is to simply give a choice to use a custom function to filter the path names alltogether, which results in only one new option.\n. No problem. It might not be the best solution, but at the moment, my MyPathFilter function is defined in my .vimrc like this:\nfunction! MyPathFilter(str)\n  let newstr = fnamemodify(a:str,\n        \\ \":s?<some-path>?<target>?\")\n  let newstr = fnamemodify(newstr,\n        \\ \":s?<some-other-path>?<other-target>?\")\n  retu newstr\nendfunction\nAs you probably notice, this is almost kind of rude, but it actually works fine.\nTo be specific, what I do is that I change paths like \"/home/location/of/Dropbox/folder/+++\" to \"~/symlink\". This is because I have chosen to let my Dropbox folder live in a separate home folder, and use symlinks to the folder in Dropbox that I need or use often (this gives me a very clean \"~/\").\nSince the MyPathFilter actually does exactly what I need, I actually don't have a MyPathShorten function any longer. I just added it to demonstrate what I thought could be a good idea.\nAfter some further thought, I think the better idea is to let the user specify a user function for filtering all paths/lines, that is to allow a custom formatline function as an alternative to the one that you currently use to shorten the long lines. This allows the flexibility that at least I need, at the same time as it makes it much cleaner.\nIf you want, I could try to make a prototype implementation of this to show you more specifically what I mean.\n. So, now I just added the change I mentioned above, and I think it is much better. I have these lines in my .vimrc, and this gives me the flexilibity I needed. Since it also opens the possilibity to generally change how the ctrlp lines look, I might play more with this in the future.\n``` viml\nlet g:ctrlp_custom_formatline = 'MyFormatLine'\nfunction!

Hi! Sorry, I was away and could not respond for some days. I agree with your decision. Keep up the good work!\n. By the way: I really like your custom pathshorten. :)\n. Thanks!

After commenting out the two lines, everything works fine (though the cursor still jumps to the beginning of line each time when buffer is switched, but I guess this is a problem of vim itself). It looks strange but at least now it works. Thank you very much for your help and for creating such a beautiful plugin.\n. ",

Thanks!\n. @kien: I've browsed the plugin code a little, and got curious about your fold method. On autoload/ctrlp.vim, for example, some top level folds are marked with **, other with * and some with -. I've noticed that there is something similar on the lower level folds. Do you mind sharing your method? Is it enforced by some plugin you use?\n. Thanks for your quick answer! \nIt looked like as a fancy way for navigating through folds, which sometimes I miss.\nBut I will use your method as a start, along with 'fdc=1' to avoid getting lost on folds :-)\n. I don't like hidden buffers, as I prefer to always save the buffers. If there is an unsaved buffer, I'd rather prefer to be notified to check if I forgot saving some intended change or if I hit the keyboard by distraction and the change was an accident.\nIf there is some unsaved hidden buffers, a commit operation may end-up incomplete, or there may be a couple of hidden buffers that I'll only notice when trying to leave Vim, often when shutting-down my machine (sometimes in a hurry).\nI know It would be possible to use :ls to repeatedly  check if there are buffers on this condition, but it seems a waste of time.\nTo be honest I never really understood the benefits of hidden buffers. If you know a better approach to this please let me know.\nYou may just ignore this request if you feel that this change will not be helpful to others.\n. @kien: it works very well! Thank you very much for improving this amazing plugin!\n. I've reduced the .vimrc to an empty file and the problem still occurs. The empty .vimrc is needed at $HOME so Vim defaults to 'nocompatible'.\nScreenshots: \nhttp://imgur.com/N44eE\nhttp://imgur.com/N5OFy\nThis was tested only on gVim on ms-windows, maybe it just happens on this OS.\n.

But it is great to have it working.\nThank you very much!\n. OK, just a suggestion :)\nClearing the cache indeed solved the problem\nThanks!\n. Thanks! It indeed solved the problem!\nSorry for bothering you about something that was on an old issue - unfortunately the search tool doesn't showed any issue for keywords .., \"..\", upward, and nothing related for keyword \"directory\".\n. @lkraav, thanks for the tip!\n. It works very well - thank you very much!!\n. @kien, is there a way to add the selected file to the CtrlP MRU list if it is opened with the external tool?\n. @kien: it works like a charm! Thanks!\n. @kien: I've browsed the plugin code a little, and got curious about your fold method. On autoload/ctrlp.vim, for example, some top level folds are marked with **, other with * and some with -. I've noticed that there is something similar on the lower level folds. Do you mind sharing your method? Is it enforced by some plugin you use?\n. Thanks for your quick answer! \nIt looked like as a fancy way for navigating through folds, which sometimes I miss.\nBut I will use your method as a start, along with 'fdc=1' to avoid getting lost on folds :-)\n. I don't like hidden buffers, as I prefer to always save the buffers. If there is an unsaved buffer, I'd rather prefer to be notified to check if I forgot saving some intended change or if I hit the keyboard by distraction and the change was an accident.\nIf there is some unsaved hidden buffers, a commit operation may end-up incomplete, or there may be a couple of hidden buffers that I'll only notice when trying to leave Vim, often when shutting-down my machine (sometimes in a hurry).\nI know It would be possible to use :ls to repeatedly  check if there are buffers on this condition, but it seems a waste of time.\nTo be honest I never really understood the benefits of hidden buffers. If you know a better approach to this please let me know.\nYou may just ignore this request if you feel that this change will not be helpful to others.\n. @kien: it works very well! Thank you very much for improving this amazing plugin!\n. I've reduced the .vimrc to an empty file and the problem still occurs. The empty .vimrc is needed at $HOME so Vim defaults to 'nocompatible'.\nScreenshots: \nhttp://imgur.com/N44eE\nhttp://imgur.com/N5OFy\nThis was tested only on gVim on ms-windows, maybe it just happens on this OS.\n. It works like a charm.\nThanks you for correcting it so fast, and for sharing this amazing plugin!\n. I've been experiencing the same problem since I started using this plugin almost a year ago.

I still think it's nice to center, even if it doesn't land where it's supposed to.  Centering at least gives you a fair chance to find the actual tag in either direction.  Plus, it makes where to look for the cursor consistent.  At the moment, you have no idea where you're going to be.  And I'd like to avoid the extra keystrokes.\n. Would it be okay if I make this an option or is there someway to hook it to get the behavior I'd like?  I've been testing this for a little while, and I really like it.  It's a huge speed improvement to see the contents for a function right away, instead of having to center it myself.  In the case that the tags are off, I haven't run into a case where I've been unhappy with the result.  If the signature still matches, Vim still searches for the tag and finds it.  If the signature is off, it does expand the fold, but then I could see the target nearby.  And in most cases, Vim still found the right location via searching.\n\nIf you're really opposed, I'll happily run my patched version.  I just think it's a nice feature for users.  Thanks for all your help!\n. This does help with opening the folds.  Can we now safely add the centering?  Just calling sil! norm! zz didn't work, but wrapping it with feedkeys as well did:\ndiff\ndiff --git a/autoload/ctrlp/tag.vim b/autoload/ctrlp/tag.vim\nindex bb78744..f10d6c0 100644\n--- a/autoload/ctrlp/tag.vim\n+++ b/autoload/ctrlp/tag.vim\n@@ -111,6 +111,7 @@ fu! ctrlp#tag#accept(mode, str)\n    el\n        sil! cal feedkeys(\":\".cmd.\" \".tg.\"\\r\", 'nt')\n    en\n+   sil! cal feedkeys(\"zz\", 'nt')\n    cal ctrlp#setlcdir()\n endf\n. Right, I understood why you used feedkeys().  My goal was to still center the tag.  With the original way, wouldn't a failure in :tag cause an exception and stop execution?  I'm not sure how it works with feedkeys(), but at least you would have been pretty sure not to change the view on error since you'd never get to the line that does the centering.\nI appreciate your effort, but I'm not content to hit zz manually, so I'll maintain a forked version if that's what I need to do.

I wish the fix were a little more elegant, but we've got the two paths here.\n. I spent last evening this morning looking over error and exception handling in VimScript.

I still think it's nice to center, even if it doesn't land where it's supposed to.  Centering at least gives you a fair chance to find the actual tag in either direction.  Plus, it makes where to look for the cursor consistent.  At the moment, you have no idea where you're going to be.  And I'd like to avoid the extra keystrokes.\n. Would it be okay if I make this an option or is there someway to hook it to get the behavior I'd like?  I've been testing this for a little while, and I really like it.  It's a huge speed improvement to see the contents for a function right away, instead of having to center it myself.  In the case that the tags are off, I haven't run into a case where I've been unhappy with the result.  If the signature still matches, Vim still searches for the tag and finds it.  If the signature is off, it does expand the fold, but then I could see the target nearby.  And in most cases, Vim still found the right location via searching.\n\nIf you're really opposed, I'll happily run my patched version.  I just think it's a nice feature for users.  Thanks for all your help!\n. This does help with opening the folds.  Can we now safely add the centering?  Just calling sil! norm! zz didn't work, but wrapping it with feedkeys as well did:\ndiff\ndiff --git a/autoload/ctrlp/tag.vim b/autoload/ctrlp/tag.vim\nindex bb78744..f10d6c0 100644\n--- a/autoload/ctrlp/tag.vim\n+++ b/autoload/ctrlp/tag.vim\n@@ -111,6 +111,7 @@ fu! ctrlp#tag#accept(mode, str)\n    el\n        sil! cal feedkeys(\":\".cmd.\" \".tg.\"\\r\", 'nt')\n    en\n+   sil! cal feedkeys(\"zz\", 'nt')\n    cal ctrlp#setlcdir()\n endf\n. Right, I understood why you used feedkeys().  My goal was to still center the tag.  With the original way, wouldn't a failure in :tag cause an exception and stop execution?  I'm not sure how it works with feedkeys(), but at least you would have been pretty sure not to change the view on error since you'd never get to the line that does the centering.\nI appreciate your effort, but I'm not content to hit zz manually, so I'll maintain a forked version if that's what I need to do.  Thanks for all your help!\n. Bah.  I always forget that VimScript operates differently than most languages.  One last try here, and I'll give up trying to convince you.  What about something like this then:\ndiff\ndiff --git a/autoload/ctrlp/tag.vim b/autoload/ctrlp/tag.vim\nindex bb78744..fb6d9fe 100644\n--- a/autoload/ctrlp/tag.vim\n+++ b/autoload/ctrlp/tag.vim\n@@ -106,10 +106,17 @@ fu! ctrlp#tag#accept(mode, str)\n        en\n        let save_cst = &cst\n        set cst&\n-       sil! cal feedkeys(\":\".fnd[1].\"ta \".tg.\"\\r\", 'nt')\n-       let &cst = save_cst\n+       try\n+           sil! cal feedkeys(\":\".fnd[1].\"ta \".tg.\"\\r\", 'nt')\n+           sil! cal feedkeys(\"zz\", 'nt')\n+       finally\n+           let &cst = save_cst\n+       endtry\n    el\n-       sil! cal feedkeys(\":\".cmd.\" \".tg.\"\\r\", 'nt')\n+       try\n+           sil! cal feedkeys(\":\".cmd.\" \".tg.\"\\r\", 'nt')\n+           sil! cal feedkeys(\"zz\", 'nt')\n+       endtry\n    en\n    cal ctrlp#setlcdir()\n endf\nThat'll keep the zz from executing when :tag fails, but center the line if it does.  I wish the fix were a little more elegant, but we've got the two paths here.\n. I spent last evening this morning looking over error and exception handling in VimScript.  I see what you're talking about.  There's really no clean way to make sure the :tag command was successful.  Even checking v:errmsg seems wrong because an autocmd may have done a silent! ....  It's a real shame that there's no good way of coping with an error here. :-(\nThank you very much for taking the time to explain your position.

You can\ntest this by opening ctrlp right after starting up Vim, and try to\nreproduce the error.\nFor the second problem, does the entire Vim window become jumpy or just\nthe content of the non-ctrlp buffer(s) become jumpy?\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim/issues/248#issuecomment-7530512\n. the OS is windows 7, gvim73.46\ni just re-installed everything including gvim for windows and the amix\nconfig files.\nand the same question happend. ..\nreally frustrating...\nthanks anyway\n\nOn Mon, Aug 6, 2012 at 2:43 PM, kien <\nreply@reply.github.com\n\nwrote:\nWhat OS are you using on this computer?

Right now, I'm probably the only one to do that, but it's such a handy springboard, I'm debating ways to make it far more prominent. For example, remapping <C-W><C-N> to open that window rather than a blank one. Nobody really wants a blank window, right? Except now I've blocked people from doing <C-W><C-N><C-P> to start finding in a new window.\nEasy solution: make my <C-p> map invoke :CtrlP on the first line (and consider deprecating it long term). This works, but it misses the submodule case, plus things like .gitignore aren't respected (although I suppose you could argue that's a feature).

I have no idea.\n:Gedit : opens a buffer containing the output of git status.

I'm working on that now, but it's somewhat independent of the code I've posted, that's why I didn't go into details, though I'm happy to talk about the plugin as a whole especially once I can get a first working version.\nSo since the letter is chosen dynamically in my plugin's init function, I thought a mapping wouldn't work well. Furthermore, I'm capturing the leader key inside your ctrlp prompt, so it actually doesn't conflict with actual  mappings. So I figured the PrtFocusMap (or the KeyLoop) function was the more appropriate place to capture the input, though I'm totally open for suggestions.\n. Yes. To be clear, it would be c, I'm putting the brackets to show the user which key was picked for the hotkey, as well as for making it easy to do the regex highlight by finding the brackets (matchadd(grp, '[.]')).

Sending a  would be fine but I couldn't find out how to do it.\nIn a way this functionality is like CtrlP meets EasyMotion.\n. I think it makes a difference since I'm doing this plugin with speed in mind. I have mapped my leader to a very reachable key, while brackets aren't that much.

So there's no point in requiring an extra keypress (enter). Is there a way to send a  or ^M?

The file is not in the buffer list either.

The odd thing is: in the aforementioned directory, CtrlP will create a .txt file named as \"C%%WINDOWS%system32.txt\", which is the name of the working directory of my Vim. \n   I tried to use cd commend (in my _vimrc) after the line specifying the ctrlp_cache_dir, however, a new .txt file will be created in the 'C:~\\CtrlP' directory. \n3.  More on the wired .txt file: \n   -  Upon closing of the gVim session, the fill will get deleted. (I think this is the problem that leads to the re-initializing problem);\n   -  In the .txt file, there are only files names that are in Vim's currently working directory. If I change the working directory out of the current-working-directory and press CtrlP again, the same initializing process would come again. This would end up with creating another .txt file named in the same way. \nUp to this point, I hope it would be clear what the problem would be coming from.\nThanks for your help!\nAll the best, \n- Linfeng\n. So, I did as suggested but it made the things worse. After I commented out my previous specification for ctrlp_cache_dir and used the line suggested above, CtrlP would have to reinitialize again every time I escape to normal mode. \nTo be more precise, when I change my directory to my dropbox folder and press , it would take up to 10 seconds to initialize. If I were using the previous setting (let g:ctrlp_cache_dir='C:\\Users\\Linfeng\\Documents\\Vim-document\\CtrlP'), I will not have to wait for another 10 seconds if I escape to normal mode and then press . However, under the new specification, I would wait for the same 10 seconds after escaping to normal mode and press . This time, I would have to reinitialize within the same gVim session. \nAny idea why this keeps occurring?\n. So, what should be stored in the CtrlP cache directory? I have two directories, both containing a file called \"cache.txt\", and a temp-file named in a wired way (documenting the files in the CWD of Vim, when pressing Ctrl+P). And the temp file will be deleted after closing the gVim session.\nI found that in the two sub-directories, the \"cache.txt\" files will not get deleted. The will be appended to in stead. However, the temp file (e.g. C%%Image.txt), will be deleted after the ending of the session. \nI think this is where the re-initializing problem comes from. Is there a way to prevent Vim from deleting this file? I have tried to make a copy of the temp file and paste it back to the cache directory. And this would save the effort of re-initialization.\n. Great! This is a perfect heal! \nSo I added the following line to my _vimrc and it worked.\nlet g:ctrlp_clear_cache_on_exit = 0\nLastly, note that  is used to refresh the cache while one is in CtrlP console (correct me if I used the wrong name). That is,  and then press  will force a refresh of the cache. \nThanks a lot! \n. Hi Ludovic,\nThanks for pointing the format for the cache dir path, however, it does not solve the problem.

So, I did as suggested but it made the things worse. After I commented out my previous specification for ctrlp_cache_dir and used the line suggested above, CtrlP would have to reinitialize again every time I escape to normal mode. \nTo be more precise, when I change my directory to my dropbox folder and press , it would take up to 10 seconds to initialize. If I were using the previous setting (let g:ctrlp_cache_dir='C:\\Users\\Linfeng\\Documents\\Vim-document\\CtrlP'), I will not have to wait for another 10 seconds if I escape to normal mode and then press . However, under the new specification, I would wait for the same 10 seconds after escaping to normal mode and press . This time, I would have to reinitialize within the same gVim session. \nAny idea why this keeps occurring?\n. So, what should be stored in the CtrlP cache directory? I have two directories, both containing a file called \"cache.txt\", and a temp-file named in a wired way (documenting the files in the CWD of Vim, when pressing Ctrl+P). And the temp file will be deleted after closing the gVim session.\nI found that in the two sub-directories, the \"cache.txt\" files will not get deleted. The will be appended to in stead. However, the temp file (e.g. C%%Image.txt), will be deleted after the ending of the session. \nI think this is where the re-initializing problem comes from. Is there a way to prevent Vim from deleting this file? I have tried to make a copy of the temp file and paste it back to the cache directory. And this would save the effort of re-initialization.\n. Great! This is a perfect heal! \nSo I added the following line to my _vimrc and it worked.\nlet g:ctrlp_clear_cache_on_exit = 0\nLastly, note that  is used to refresh the cache while one is in CtrlP console (correct me if I used the wrong name). That is,  and then press  will force a refresh of the cache. \nThanks a lot! \n. ",
