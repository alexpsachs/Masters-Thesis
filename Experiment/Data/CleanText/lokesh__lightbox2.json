    "lokesh": "Fixed. Thanks for catching that.\n. Thanks for mentioning this.\nI'm writing the javascript in Coffeescript. All of Coffeescript's output is wrapped in an anonymous function already which makes this easy to fix. I aliased jQuery in that scope. See the compiled js below:\n(function() {\n  var $, Lightbox, LightboxOptions;\n$ = jQuery;\n. Thanks Jules for your help!\nI'm curious, what did you use for optimizing the images?\n. Thanks Kostin! I made your suggested edits in the source Coffeescript file. \n. Flash movies and dropdown menus often appeared above the lightbox overlay and this function temporarily hid them to prevent the problem. I will review this to see if the issue still persists.\n. @akamustang - Thanks for the idea. Implemented in the source Coffeescript file and added to master.\n. Rendering performance is good at the moment. Sub 10ms for almost all paints on a 2 yr old Macbook Air that I'm using. \nI don't want to hardcode width and height values in the javascript as people might switch out the default loading image with another that has different dimensions and not be aware or want to mess with the javascript code. We could preload the loader, close, and arrow images and get the dimensions but this would add a bit of code complexity.\nGoing to leave as is for now. Thought if performance becomes an issue, all of these items should be reevaluated.\nThanks @akamustang.\n. Unable to recreate problem overlay problem on iPad. Closing out this issue.\n. Modernizr and html5shiv compatibility in the latest version on master.\n@sibprogrammer - Thanks for the note.\n. Moved the reference to the loading and close images out of the javascript file and into the css. Preloading the image in css using the following technique:\nhttp://www.thecssninja.com/css/even-better-image-preloading-with-css2\nSee my commit:\nhttps://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/commit/953badfffffcfac749bc2a2f81aec88d08861052\n. Dropped the semicolons as they didn't serve a purpose as noted above. Thanks for the heads up.\n. @vikethehube - Added options for show/hiding the image number label and looping through image set once you reach the end or clicked the previous arrow from the beginning. Thanks for the suggestions and code. Latest is in mater on github.\n. Fixed in master. Thanks @ilyador.\nDoing some Github issues and PR clean up today.\n. Testing these changes tonight. Much needed. Thanks!\n. Working on the resizing of large images to fit in viewport problem though with a slightly different solution. I'm going to close this issue out and continue discussion here https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/pull/32.\nI'm also evaluating using css for fades and resize animations though a javascript fallback is still required for older browsers.\n. Working on a fix now. Going to close this issue as their another discussion on this topic here https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/pull/32\n. Going the HTML data- attribute route. I will be merging in this PR https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/pull/27 which will make HTML5 Validators happy. \n. Working on getting @TheConstructor's PR in which would support the old rel attribute syntax as well as a HTML5 valid data-lightbox syntax. Closing this PR in favor of https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/pull/27\n. Spriting the images will cut down on a couple of http requests and is a good idea for end users. I'm keeping the previous arrow, next arrow, and closing images separate in the main codebase to allow for easier customization. \n. I was never able to recreate this issue. Closing out. Doing some github cleanup. \nIf the issue still exists in the latest version of Lightbox on github > master, let me know. Thanks.\n. Closing out as there is limited demand for this feature. Thanks for submitting though @shakiba .\n. As @sarvaje noted, I am using the Compass framework's opacity mixin to generate the x-browser css. I'm going to leave as is since having an opaque background in IE8, though not ideal, is passable for this slightly older browser.\n. For simplicity, Lightbox will remain only for displaying images. There are some great alternative scripts for displaying html content.\n. Better late then never. I'm adopting most of your suggestions and working them into master manually. Thanks for taking the time to do this.\n. FAST! Thanks for that. Looks good to me. Will merge.\n. These days I value more and more, readable, consistent, and jshint happy code so these changes are appreciated.\n. Added support for data-lightbox alongside rel=\"lightbox\". See the latest in master. The commit is linked (the relevant bits are in lightbox.coffee):\nhttps://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/commit/c31a0eba6a5bd9c82c132dac8609a201974b1710\n. I made some edits and merged a few PRs. The script should now work with with the latest versions of jQuery.\nI tested the latest lightbox.js code with jQuery 1.10.1 and 2.0.2 successfully. Grab the latest from this github repo. I will be updating the demo page download links tomorrow.\nPlease reopen this issue if the problem persists. Thanks!\n. Thanks @duergar for the submission. I worked on a similar fix that I will be releasing in the next day or two. \nI'm closing this issue out as there is a similar discussion happening in https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/pull/32/\n. Adding in the upcoming release. Thanks for the feedback.\n. Added a 'fitImagesInViewport' option. Take a peek:\nhttps://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/commit/8e00c3086c7ca1f7ac5f316a5d7bd9f0903e2013\n. @OutPunk - Updating master with your suggestion. Thanks.\n. The reason for this issue was that there was an incorrect reference to the loader image. The jQuery selector was looking for '.loader' instead of '.lb-loader'\nThis is fixed in master on Github. I'll update the demo page in the next day or so.\nThanks for catching.\n. Implemented your change in the latest version of Lightbox on Github. Thanks @soyuka.\n. Good catch!\nI updated the screen.sass file which eventually compiles into screen.css. You can see the fix in place:\nhttp://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/#donate\n. Fixed in the latest code, check master branch on Github. I'll be updating the demo page in the next day or two. Thanks for catching this @nffdiogosilva.\n. I'm going to close this as there is the sass-convert command available for users who prefer the SCSS syntax. Though it is nice to have the css in multiple syntaxes ready to go, it's not worth the bit of extra overhead to maintain two different versions.\nThanks @danielsitek and @TheConstructor \n. Making edits to the Lightbox demo page now. Your comments have been noted. Thanks @tchalvak \n. Fixed in master branch. Thanks @outmanone.\nDoing some Github cleanup.\n. In v2.7.0 due out shortly I'm allowing the usage of the data-title attribute for generating the caption (as well as maintaining support for the title attribute) which will make it easier to embed links and other html in the caption.\n. @MOHS3N - Unclear about your question. Your best bet is to post your question on stackoverflow.com\nI'm reserving Github Issues for feature requests and bugs.\n. I'm avoiding embedding images in CSS as it might confuse some users who are unfamiliar with the practice and are looking to customize these images.\nI did move the reference to the loading and close images out of the javascript file and into the css. Preloading the image in css using the following technique:\nhttp://www.thecssninja.com/css/even-better-image-preloading-with-css2\nSee my commit:\n953badf\n. Everything here is great but I recently made the decision to move away from SASS and Coffeescript for Lightbox. It was a barrier to entry for many people.\n. Thank @XhmikosR!\nI'm working to get the rest of the issues resolved and PRs reviewed and put up a new version on the demo page today.\n. @XhmikosR - What tool are you using for image optimization? I need to introduce something into my normal dev workflow.\n. @XhmikosR - I was unfamiliar with jshintrc files. Sublimelinter supports them which makes me happy. Thanks for that and the other additions. \n. Thanks @Heleen. Your changes were merged in. I patched locally and then pushed up to github. I'll credit you in the Thank you section in the updated Readme. Going to get everything up later this evening.\nhttps://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/commit/b2655b3ba926fa52d464ad9c7a3b7c2668589417\n. @mwasson - Thanks for the edits. I particularly appreciate your 'albumLabel' addition for its clarity. Merging PR.\n. In bad form, I merged before I tested locally. I have limited experience with package.json files and was unfamiliar with the custom 'scripts' actions. Not an excuse, still my bad.\nYour edits look good. Worked for me on local.\nJust curious, any difference between the following you are aware of or is it just a style preference:\ncoffee --compile --output ./js/ ./coffee/\nover:\ncoffee --compile --output js/ coffee/\n. Lots of these changes moved into master and part of next release. Will credit properly for the changes. :beers: \n. Works on mobile. If you see an issue on a certain mobile device please create a new issue with details on how to recreate that issue. Thanks.\n. Just pushed your fix to master. Thanks for noting the issue and sending the fix. Appreciated!\n. Lightbox is for images only. There are plenty of good alternatives that support html content.\n. Thanks.\nThis doesn't seem to affect newer versions of Firefox. I tested with the following versions:\n- OSX Firefox 25\n- OSX Firefox 26\n- Windows 7 Firefox 27\n.

But both of those were difficult to maintain so I have offloaded everything to Stackoverflow.\nWith the exception of a Getting Started section and an Options table.\n. Since this is unlikely to be a common usage for the Lightbox script I'm going to close this Issue out as part of my Github Issues cleanup.\n. Adding the ability to display more than images is not on the roadmap for Lightbox2. Keeping the script simple. There are some great alternative scripts that allow yout to lightbox html content.

The latest version of Lightbox, 2.7.1, makes it easier to add links in captions.

More text.\">My image link</a>\nGrab the latest code: http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/\n. Latest release, 2.7.0, has a new option: alwaysShowNavOnTouchDevices\nIt is set to false by default but toggle to true to make sure arrows always display when viewing image sets on touch devices.\nGrab it here: http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/\n``` javascript\nvar LightboxOptions = (function() {\n    function LightboxOptions() {\n      this.fadeDuration                = 500;\n      this.fitImagesInViewport         = true;\n      this.resizeDuration              = 700;\n      this.positionFromTop             = 50;\n      this.showImageNumberLabel        = true;\n      this.alwaysShowNavOnTouchDevices = false;\n      this.wrapAround                  = false;\n    }\n```\n. Displaying non-image content is not on the roadmap for Lightbox. There are great alternative scripts that offer this.\n. Nice modification. But I don't think it has enough general purpose use for merging into master as the alt and title attributes should carry different data.\nhttp://www.wpromote.com/blog/seo/image-alt-vs-title-using-alt-title-attributes-in-image-tags/\n.

Closing out old, inactive issues.\nI am investigating improvements for mobile layout and interaction. Nothing set yet.\n. Does this problem still exists on the demo page with the latest version of Chromium?\nwww.lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/\n. @wb7 Thanks!\n. By default the wrapAround option is set to false.

Thanks.\n. The plan for Lightbox is to remain for images only. Keeping it simple.\nThere are many great Lightbox script alternatives that support displaying html content though.\n. Closing out old issues.\nI've taken note of the feedback regarding alt text and ARIA techniques. I'm working on a brand new version of the script, v3.0, and it will address accessibility issues from the start versus the current version which has mostly ignored them.\nSome of the accessibility issues I'm looking at:\n- Alt attributes.\n- ARIA roles.\n- Constrast ratios for type.\n- Keyboard inputs and tabbing.\n- Click/touch target size.\n. These features are out of scope of Lightbox which is dedicated to displaying images. There are plenty of alternative scripts that handle videos and html content in modals well.\n. I've added the ability to use the browser's native right-click to save the image in a commit today:\nhttps://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/commit/363c3cb8af8fae1b6f95d6679df976022290f878\nIt'll be in the next release v2.9.0 coming out at the end of the weekend.\n. Closing out old issues.\nIf issue is still relevant, please make a note and I will reopen and investigate. Thanks.\n. Closing out inactive issues.\nLooks like the original problem was related to a conflict with retina.js script.. Oops. Nice catch.\n. This is going into the next version 2.7.0. I've switched back from Coffeescript to plain old Javascript so I'm unable to merge your code. I'll move the edits over manually and give you proper credit. Thanks @copycut \n. Thanks for the edit. I'm reviewing your changes and seeing if I can recreate the issue you were seeing.\nThe default width and height of 250px are used as a starting point for the Lightbox container to animate from towards the size of the image to show.\n. Closing out old PRs. This issue looks to have been fixed as no recent reports have been seen.. I am unable to recreate your reported issue. Can you post detailed steps to recreate this issue. \nThanks. I'll reopen at that time.\n. I attempted to recreate this issue in Windows 7 Internet Explorer 11.0.9431.0 with no luck.

Sorry!\nHere is what I was trying to say for how to disable preloading:\n\nThe change is simple though. Remove the following line in the showImage() method:\nthis.preloadNeighboringImages();\n. I'm able to recreate this issue as well. I'm using Chrome v33.0.1750.152 in OSX. This is a tricky one. :bug: \n\nThe CSS values for the overlay at the start and end of the fade seem to be correct but Chrome sometimes does and sometimes doesn't render the element. Interestingly, I see this problem more often on my Macbook Pro w/Retina display versus my non-retina external display.\nIf you resize the window or have Developer Tools open and mouse over an element in the Elements panel the overlay will appear. I'm going to continue investigating this issue. If anyone makes progress, please post here. Thanks!\n. This might be related to be a Chrome browser bug.

The latest version of Lightbox, 2.7.1, allows the use of the data-title attribute instead of the title attribute. Try this instead. For example, it is now easier to add links in captions:\njavascript\n<a href=\"img/image.jpg\" data-lightbox=\"example\" data-title=\"<a href='http://google.com'>Link to google</a>.

Given the following link on the page:\nhtml\n<a class=\"example-image-link\" href=\"images/demopage/image.jpg\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">Example Link</a>\nYou can automatically start Lightbox once the DOM is loaded by running the following code:\n``` js\n$(function() {\n    lightbox.start($('.example-image-link'));\n});\n```\n. Closing out old issues.\nIf issue is still relevant, please make a note and I will reopen and investigate. Thanks.. Since this issue was reported earlier this year I have stripped much of the custom styling out of lightbox.css. The plugin does a better job of blending into to the existing page by utilizing existing fonts and colors.\nTo customize further, overwrite the rules in lightbox.css.\n. Were you able to resolve this issue? If not, can you post a link to the issue or the relevant code. Once you do that I will reopen and investigate. Thanks.\n. @msikio you can fix this by moving the other anchor tags that link to the images in the set below the anchor that is used to open up Lightbox.\n\nI can see why this is counter intuitive though. I will look to get an update in. Thanks.\n. You cannot rotate with Lightbox. This is something you should do with the images ahead of time in a graphics application.\n. @gshaxor this feature is not on the roadmap for Lightbox.\nIf you want to do it yourself I would add a another attribute to the image link, maybe data-rotate=\"90\", that you read with Javascript and use to apply a CSS transform. Goodluck!\n. @innerpeacelove can you post a link to a page where I can see the problem? Maybe you can create a jsfiddle or codepen example. I am unable to recreate the issue.

This is an old PR that rewrites the CSS with SASS. I wanted to chime in on why it wasn't merged for anyone who comes across it in the future. For this project I've opted to keep the barrier for usage and outside development very low. So this means no precompilers. At one point I had switched to Coffeescript which caused significant confusion for those unfamiliar with it.\nAlso, at this point, SASS is making way for PostCSS. And with the minimal amount of CSS in the project, it isn't worth it IMHO.\nFor features like this that aren't on the roadmap I keep the PRs open so they are visible for others who might be interested in utilizing the code.. This has been fixed recently and will be in the next release v2.9.0 coming out in 2 days:\nhttps://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/commit/7047214f77cfc8f892e8513426b57d45bf29e9cd\n. Looks like the linked jsfiddle does what you're looking for. The example could benefit from using css transforms to smooth out the animations but otherwise it works well!\nThis feature isn't requested enough to be in the main codebase though so I'm closing out this issue.\n.

I'm planning out v3.0 now and it will give developers much more control about how and when the script is initialized. It is unlikely to be a jQuery plugin as I am exploring removing the jQuery dependency altogether.\nYour feedback has been noted in the README.md's v3.0 brainstorming section. Thanks!\n.

I'm planning out what features to put in to the next major release, v3.0, and I'll add this to the list.\n. Chiming in on this older issue.\nIf anyone else is seeing this issue they can call lightbox.enable() instead of lightbox.init(). The enable method attaches the click events to the newly added images but does not construct any new DOM elements to append to the page.\nIn the next release I'll be adding a code check to prevent the duplication of the DOM elements. Multiple init() calls will not cause any side effects.\nhttps://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/pull/615. Resolved: https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/releases/tag/v2.10.0. Closing out old issues.\nIf you still need help, please post your question on Stackoverflow. See more details here: http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/#help\nGithub Issues is for bugs only. Thanks.\n. I'm closing this issue but keeping the following PR open:\nhttps://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/pull/522\nFor v3 which is still in planning stages I will likely remove all JS deps.\n. The lack of original context/right-click menu to save images has always bugged me as well. I decided to investigate the issue today.\nThe way I solved it is to listen for right mouse button down event on the div on top of the image and then quickly set the pointer-events to none so that when the mouseup and right-click events do occur the div is not listening and the event continues bubbling down through to the image.\nFix is incoming in the next version.\n. https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/commit/363c3cb8af8fae1b6f95d6679df976022290f878\nChanges will go out in next release.\n. @teo1978 The solution I have added https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/commit/363c3cb8af8fae1b6f95d6679df976022290f878 is a bit of a hack but it works well for desktop users w/mice. It doesn't adversely affect mobile touch users.\nThe ideal desktop solution, also a bit of a hack, but cleaner, would be to have the nav items be small and matching the size of their icons. So right-clicking the nav items would show the contextmenu for the icons and right-clicking anywhere else on the image would show the image's contextmenu. Then a mousemove event listener would be added to the image and we would detect which section of the image the mouse pointer is on and then use that data to apply a class to a parent that would be used to show/hide the specific nav arrow as required. On clicking the image, we would also check the mouse pointer position so we can determine if the prev or next action should be executed.\nThe problem is that this would be a breaking change so I am not planning anything this drastic in v2.x.\n. I haven't seen or heard of any incompatibility issues with jQuery 3.\nIf issue is still relevant, please make a note and I will reopen and investigate. Thanks.\n.

Thanks.\n. Take a look at this issue for some ideas how to vertically center Lightbox in the viewport:\nhttps://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/issues/172\n. This was actually a case of flawed documentation. The aspect ratio is maintained if one of the max options is set. I've updated the options description as well as added a comment in the source javascript for clarity. Thanks for catching.\nhttp://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/#options\nhttps://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/blob/master/src/js/lightbox.js#L307\n. Closing out old issues.\nOne point for the record:\nBreaking changes in non-major version bumps. Some history... Lightbox started before semantic versioning became the norm. When version 2 come out, it was a complete re-write, with a brand new feature set. It was branded as a Lightbox2. A new shiny thing. I am reserving major version bumps for these large branded changes. A couple of breaking changes did slip in during v2.x. But, I do not plan to make any more breaking changes till v3.\nFor fun, you can still take a peek at Version 1 here.\n. I appreciate all the discussion in this thread but I'm only keeping issues open that have actionable items as they are bug reports or feature requests.\n. @teo1978 just for you, I'm fixing it. It'll be in the next patch release. :-)\nThe enable and build methods required the body tag to be in the DOM. Simply delayed their execution till the document is ready.\n. Added a imageFadeDuration option. Incoming in v2.9.0:\nhttps://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/commit/6d5f99a65f189a5d2bd7bbfac4682fe36e62871e\n. I agree with all of the above! It requires multiple css edits to customize a simple border.\nThe reason for this complication is that when you are navigating a set of images you want to keep this 'border' visible while at the same time fading in and out the images. This is the reason that the images weren't originally given a simple css border.\nHere is how it looks now:\n\nHere is what it would look like with the removal of the white background on the outer container and the addition of css borders on the images:\n\nWith some Javascript magic it would be possible to allow a user to simply set css borders on the images and have the transitions render as they do now. Or even simpler would be to add Javascript options for border controls. I have opted again these approaches for simplicity.\n. @teo1978 Thanks for all the feedback. Again, you bring up some really good points.\n\n\"...straw man. You just removed the background\"\n\nI agree. That comparison was done in haste. \nI'm testing some changes that would allow users to set the border directly on the image and would continue to support the previous 'padding to expose parent container bg hack':\nhttps://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/commit/214361297f1dd5f0c19c1d80ff37c398cdda55cb\n. The Lightbox scripts were originally created in a desktop dominated world where mobile web usage was limited. And the lackluster mobile/touch experience shows that mobile was an after thought.\nI'm not planning any more work on the v2.x mobile web experience. Though I understand how this issue qualifies as usability issue if the dev creates a gallery and it is unclear to the user how to navigate between the images on mobile. I'm going to let it stand as is in v2.x.\nv3.0, which is in planning, will completely rethink the mobile experience. I'll be exploring gestural navigation for forward/prev navigation, tilt panning for panoramas, and making it clear visually that the image being viewed is part of a set, besides many other things.\n. By default the caption link should use the color that is set as your default a color.\n\nClosing as this is not a bug.\n. @eliz82 thanks for the follow-up and the details. You make some good points. I'll review solutions today.\n. Per your suggestions I'm updating the default link color in Lightbox captions. I'm defaulting to a light blue similar to the default blue link color:\n.lb-data .lb-caption a {\n  color: #4ae;\n}\n\nThanks again for all the feedback!\n.

This isn't common enough of a usecase to roll it into the main release but I'm going to keep this PR open so others can grab the code if they need it. Tested locally, worked!\n. I appreciate the security consideration but for now I will continue injecting the caption as html as Lightbox assumes it to be trusted data. If it is user submitted data via some other system outside of the script that could be malicious than I think it is fair to have the responsibility of sanitizing that data outside of the Lightbox script which is strictly for image display.\nAgain, thanks for the submission!\n.

The problem as stated is correct, there is no simple way to add an alt attribute to the displayed image.\nI've instituted a fix which adds a new data-alt attribute on the link. This approach is preferable to populating the alt attr with the title as those two items are distinct.\n\ntitle should have supplemental info, for example a caption or credits.\nalt should have text that could replace the image. It is not meant for supplemental info and the alt attribute should not repeat info provided in the title attr or surrounding content.\n\nThe addition of the data-alt option is queued up in the dev branch and should be released soon.\nhttps://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/pull/609\nThanks.\n.

Closing. Happy to re-open if more details are provided.. Yes, Lightbox works with jQuery v3.x. I just tested with v3.2.1. @carinp2 are you still seeing this issue?. Your proposal is much better than the current code. But after some testing, I noticed that preloading the images via CSS is altogether unnecessary. On DOM Ready the lightbox elements are appended to the body. Even though they are hidden with display: none, the images are loaded.\nhttps://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/pull/612. Can you post a link to where I can see the issue? or can you post more of your code?\nI haven't seen this issue before and need more info to recreate and debug. I'll reopen this issue once more context is provided.. Closing this issue as the feature is not currently planned. I'll be exploring this when the next major version is worked on. See the API section of the doc:\nhttps://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/blob/master/ROADMAP.md\n. Fix incoming in next release. Currently in dev branch. Thanks for reporting.\nhttps://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/pull/611. Resolved: https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/releases/tag/v2.10.0.

Looks good, I hope it can be added.\n. @lokesh: One can use http://spritegen.website-performance.org/ to quickly create the sprite.\nIn my opinion, this is a good improvement; -2 requests, -570 bytes for everyone that uses lightbox :)\nHere is my sprite, compressed and ready to use: \n\n.

This way it will be cross platform.\nYou can use https://github.com/arturadib/shelljs.\n. If you know bash then you know shelljs already.\nShell scripts aren't cross platform without more dependencies.\nBut now that I think about it you can simply use npm scripts in package.json.\n. I think the scripts aren't needed anymore; the npm run solution is truly cross platform.\nThe docs are more than welcome, though.\n. Anything to make installing the dependencies easier, is good in my opinion.\nFeel free to extend the script in package.json.\nAlternatively, we can simply use shelljs to do anything we need to, if the scripts get more complex, without worrying for platform compatibility.\n. :+1: \n. I split the patches in two branches and I added JSHint support too.\n. @lokesh: For image optimization, I use PNGGauntlet which is using optipng, pngout and deflopt. Then I use zopfli-png which is using zopfli (it's very slow especially with --i1000) and one last pass with PNGGauntlet.\n. @lokesh: Did you try the solution before merging? I forced pushed my branch with a fix in the coffee command but it seems you missed it.\n. @lokesh: Now everything should be ok. Sorry for the stupid typo :)\n.

Aren't SASS and SCSS files interpreted by the same engine and can be interchanged?\n. Did you use sass-convert as presented in http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#syntax or did you hand translate them?\nWhile I understand you prefer to have the same syntax for all files in your project, I would guess, that converting between scss and sass is easy and if the converter delivers usable results you can increases maintainability by using it.\n. Didn't want to learn something new for batching two commands.\nCan do a regular shell-script, if you like.\nNeed to add gem install compass to the documentation and maybe should transfer the whole description to some ReadMe\n. Currently npm run does not care for sass to css conversion right now. I guess this can be fixed, but wanted to mention.\nThe Ruby prerequisites could be provided through Bundler; if you're interested.\n. So, I did some ruby-things in #53 as sass seems to come that way.

If you're building responsively, then it's the order of the code in your CSS that effects the priority.  The !important tag shouldn't be necessary on the img rule.  Instead, place !important on the max-width: inherit so that it overrides the hard-coded inline CSS.\nIf all else fails, I wouldn't hard-code the plugin, because you'll lose that the next time the plugin is updated.

On M$ Win try Notepad++, on Linux gedit or Kate.\nAlternatively, search for this text \"Lightbox.prototype.changeImage\", that's in line 159.\n. My change might fix this for you, or give you the idea to fix it. See my comment in #82 .

I've looked into it and this are some facts:\n- When I enter the image address directly into my browser, a correct image appears.(both in Chrome and Firefox).\n- When I inspect the image via the inspector (Firebug, or the build in in Chrome), the image preview shows also a rotated image. (And the preview is usually raw.) See de enclosed images.\nChrome:\n\nFirefox:\n\nI suggest it is something with your server configuration. I've not jet figured out what exactly, but some facts that support this theory: When I send a custom request with my browser (via an addon), I receive also the rotated image. I have also tried to make a request without cookies and without referer, but it didn't change anything. But when I make a request with curl via the command line, I receive the right (not rotated) image. \nThis is all I've found out, I hope you can do something with it.\n. What do you mean with horizontal layout? Can you give an example?\n. You have included the lightbox script twice. You include lightbox.js AND lightbox.min.js.

In Firefox (and probably other browsers), when the image file itself is opened, the Exif orientation is honored and the image is rotated.  Thus the difference in rotation between contexts.\nThere is a simple solution that will give the correct orientation in any context, while preserving image metadata.  Set the Exif orientation to 1 (top-left), then rotate the image to the desired orientation.  You may need to be careful during the second step, as it is conceivable that some programs would alter the Exif rotation rather than actually rotating the image.  My preferred tool is Imagemagick's convert utility, which performs both operations with the -auto-orient option:\nconvert input.jpg -auto-orient output.jpg\nIf an Exif thumbnail is present, it will not be rotated by the above command.  There are several tools that can extract, insert, or regenerate Exif thumbnails.  If you don't update the thumbnail, it should be removed, for example with ExifTool:\nexiftool -ThumbnailImage= image.jpg\n. ",

It's sad to see that it was reported in 2014 and is still not fixed.\nBasically it seems that Lightbox doesn't take the height of the caption into account at all when computing the maximum image size, under the naive assumption that it will never exceed a given fixed height.\n. I've come up with a workaround for this, which is to apply the following stile after lightbox.css:\n``` css\n.lb-image {\n    border: solid 1px #888;\n}\n.lb-nav {\n    position: static;\n    overflow: visible;\n    width: 0;\n    height: 0;\n}\n.lb-nav a.lb-next {\n    float: none;\n    position: absolute;\n    top: 0;\n    right: 0;\n    width: 25%;\n    min-width: 60px;\n}\n.lb-nav a.lb-prev {\n    float: none;\n    position: absolute;\n    top: 0;\n    left: 0;\n    width: 25%;\n    min-width: 60px;\n}\n```\n. Seems a very poor solution to me. \nIsn't it much better to just not have a huge div on top of the image in the first place??\nI have done that. I attach the modified version I produced in case it may be of any help. Unfortunately, it's mixed with some unrelated changes, some of which destroy features that I didn't need (for example, I got rid of animations). Also I modified the compiled js directly. But if you take a diff between v.2.8.2 and mine and have a look, you may be able to isolate the part that addresses this issue. I'm not entirely sure, though, if it is compatible with maintaining your approach to not fixing #533 (it should be pretty orthogonal to that, but I don't remember for sure).\nlightbox2_modified.zip\nOh, there's also this piece of CSS that I applied on top of it. Most of it should be irrelevant to the issue at hand, but in case you quickly try my version \"out of the box\", it would probably give unexpected results without it\n```\n.lb-outerContainer {\n    background-color: transparent;\n}\n.lb-outerContainer, .lb-dataContainer, .lb-container, .lightbox .lb-image {\n    border-radius: 0;\n    -moz-border-radius-bottomleft: 0;\n    -webkit-border-bottom-left-radius: 0;\n    border-bottom-left-radius: 0;\n    -moz-border-radius-bottomright: 0;\n    -webkit-border-bottom-right-radius: 0;\n    border-bottom-right-radius: 0;\n}\n.lb-image {\n    border: solid 1px #888;\n}\n.lb-nav a.lb-prev, .lb-nav a.lb-next {\n    -webkit-transition: initial;\n    -moz-transition: initial;\n    -o-transition: initial;\n    transition: initial;\n}\n```\n. Note that this should be done in a way that does not prevent from fixing #524\n. >  I personally had absolutely no issue with upgrading to this latest version in my framework\nOf course, since as you say, you were already putting the script at the end of body.\n\nI prefer scripts being around  given performance reasons.\n\nGood for you, but a lot of other people prefer scripts in the <head>.\nActually I've never seen a library before that requires you to put it in a specific place.\nThis is not just about backwards compatibility (which is of course a big deal in itself). Not working unless the library is placed at the end of the body is a bug, whether it affects you in particular or not.\n. > However in this case the original author's doc states\n\n\nInclude the Javascript at the bottom of your page before the closing  tag:\nSeems pretty clear to me how to install the script.\n\n\nYeah, I forgot the part where it's actually documented.\nHowever that's just a bad design decision. There's no good reason for imposing an unnecessary and easily avoidable limitation that goes against widespread common practices (whether they are best practices or not)\n\nAnd a toaster not keeping food cold is also a bug if that's what you're hoping for it to do\n\nTo make a better analogy, this would be a freezer that only keeps food cold if you put it in the south side of the kitchen. It is advertised on the box, though, so it's perfectly reasonable.\n. And you are closing the issue because...?\n. What's not \"actionable\" about this? It should be actually pretty easy to fix.\n. > Here is what it would look like with the removal of the white background on the outer container and the addition of css borders on the images\nSorry but that's kind of a straw man. You just removed the background altogether and put a border, as if that was the solution to the issue, and showed it would look bad, hence you conclude that the issue can't be (easily) fixed without the result looking bad.\nAssuming you do want the white background (which I find awful, but that's another story), couldn't you just have a background the exact size of the image (rather than a few pixels larger to create a fake border) and a proper border??\nNo need for \"Javascript magic\", and also the background wouldn't have to be the same color as the border.\n\nI have opted again[st] these approaches for simplicity.\n\nThis is your software and of course you are free to opt for and against whatever you want, but please, please, don't blame \"simplicity\".\n.

Decorate previous methods\n``` js\noriginal['init'] = Lightbox.prototype.init;\n   Lightbox.prototype.init = function() {\n       var result = original['init'].apply(this, arguments);\n       var _args = args(arguments);\n       _args.unshift(result);\n       _args.unshift(this);\n       this.trigger('onInit', _args);\n   };\n   original['start'] = Lightbox.prototype.start;\n   Lightbox.prototype.start = function() {\n       var result = original['start'].apply(this, arguments);\n       var _args = args(arguments);\n       _args.unshift(result);\n       _args.unshift(this);\n       this.trigger('onStart', _args);\n   };\n   original['end'] = Lightbox.prototype.end;\n   Lightbox.prototype.end = function() {\n       var result = original['end'].apply(this, arguments);\n       var _args = args(arguments);\n       _args.unshift(result);\n       _args.unshift(this);\n       this.trigger('onEnd', _args);\n   };\n   original['changeImage'] = Lightbox.prototype.changeImage;\n   Lightbox.prototype.changeImage = function() {\n       var _args = args(arguments);\n       _args.unshift(this);\n       this.trigger('onBeforeChangeImage', _args);\n       //\n       var result = original['changeImage'].apply(this, arguments);\n       //\n       _args.unshift(result);\n       this.trigger('onChangeImage', _args);\n   };\n   original['showImage'] = Lightbox.prototype.showImage;\n   Lightbox.prototype.showImage = function() {\n       var result = original['showImage'].apply(this, arguments);\n       var _args = args(arguments);\n       _args.unshift(result);\n       _args.unshift(this);\n       this.trigger('onShowImage', _args);\n   };\n   original['sizeContainer'] = Lightbox.prototype.sizeContainer;\n   Lightbox.prototype.sizeContainer = function() {\n       var result = original['sizeContainer'].apply(this, arguments);\n       var _args = args(arguments);\n       _args.unshift(result);\n       _args.unshift(this);\n       this.trigger('onSizeContainer', _args);\n   };\n   ```\nLots of code, but notice they all have the same structure.\n   It just re-defines the original method, simply just triggering an event -- with the trigger method we just added at step 2 -- after each method call. \n   Only exception is the changeImage method, where we have an additional onBeforeChangeImage method, which was required for my specific case. You are free to add your own.\nNow here are some use cases of mine.\n1. Disable body scroll while lightbox is on\njs\n   Lightbox.on('onStart', function(event, result, self) {\n       $('body').css('overflow-y', 'hidden');\n   });\n   Lightbox.on('onEnd', function(event, result, self) {\n       $('body').css('overflow-y', '');\n   });\n2. Render lightbox image in iframe\nThis is really a specific case. I need to fetch images from a server which checks the referrer and disables any request that is not from its own domain. One solution is to use iframe to destroy the referrer (see referrer-killer).\n   To show the image inside the iframe, I swap the img after render:\n``` js\n// show iframe image instead of window image\n   Lightbox.on('onShowImage', function(event, result, self) {\n       var $img = $('#lightbox img.lb-image');\n   // use iframe\n   var $iframe = $img.next('iframe.iframify-lb-image');\n   var iimg = $iframe[0].contentWindow.document.getElementsByTagName('img')[0];\n   var $iimg = $(iimg);\n\n   $iframe.attr({\n       'width' : $img.css('width'),\n       'height': $img.css('height'),\n   });\n   $iimg.attr('src', $img.attr('src'));\n   $iimg.css({\n       'width' : $img.css('width'),\n       'height': $img.css('height'),\n   });\n   $iimg.fadeIn('slow');\n\n   // \n   $img.stop(true).hide();\n\n});\n   ```\n3. Preload images in iframe as well\nLightbox tries to \"preload\" the image and its neighboring images.\n   To also move this into iframe, I temporarily \"swap\" the Image object between the window and the iframe during the request, and revert it back.\njs\n   // temporary patch window.Image to iframe.Image\n   // to prevent preloader raising forbidden errors\n   var originalWindowImage = null;\n   Lightbox.on('onBeforeChangeImage', function(event, self) {\n       var $_img = $('#lightbox img.lb-image');\n       var iframeWin = $_img.next('iframe.iframify-lb-image')[0].contentWindow;\n       // patch window.Image\n       originalWindowImage = window.Image;\n       window.Image = iframeWin.Image;\n   });\n   Lightbox.on('onShowImage', function(event, result, self) {\n       window.Image = originalWindowImage;\n   });\nHope this helps anyone.\n.

The head should be redefined as \"only what is needed to load the above-the-fold page goes here\", where the word \"load\" has complete separation from \"display\" when it comes to body contents. \nEspecially when google, bing, etc require your page to load under 1 second to get a good ranking.

However, the function 'onload' will set the indexof currentImage before the currentImageIndex being chagned. The execute order is different between ie 8 and other browsers.\nAfter I put the 'this.currentImageIndex = imageNumber;'on the front of the 'var preloader = new Image();', it runs well in ie 8.. ",

Disallowing infinite sliders solved the issue. After scouring some other forums, it looks like a few others have had this problem with various slider plugins. I imagine it has something to do with how linking is handled for the edge photos of infinite sliders. I actually wasn't seeing duplicates of my interior images, just the exterior ones (e.g. if I had three photos in my infinite slider and tried displaying them in a Lightbox gallery, images 1 and 3 were duplicated, but image 2 was not)..
